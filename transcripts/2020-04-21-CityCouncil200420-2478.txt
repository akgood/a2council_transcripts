00:04:19.706: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, MAYOR. THE CITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SUMMER FESTIVAL WAS ABLE TO HAVE A VIRTUAL EARTH DAY CELEBRATION THIS COMING WEDNESDAY. IT WILL BE ALL-DAY LONG. IT'S A FAMILY FRIENDLY EVENT FROM, I BELIEVE IT'S 9 A.M. TO 8 P.M. SO YOU CAN FIND THE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ON THE CITY WEBSITE BY GOING TO ATGOV.ORG AND SEARCHING ON EARTH. ALSO, I HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPOST COLLECTION THIS YEAR. WHILE WE HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THE CARTS STARTING TOMORROW, THE STAFF HAS BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND TO YOUR REQUEST TO HAVE A DROPOFF LOCATION. SO STARTING TOMORROW, FROM 8 TO 4:00, MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, RESIDENTS CAN DROP THEIR COMPOST OFF ON THE PLAT ROAD LOCATION, JUST SOUTH OF THE DOG PARK ENTRANCE. I WANT TO ALSO REMIND YOU THAT ROAD CONSTRUCTION SEASON IS GOING TO BE STARTING SOON. WE ANTICIPATE THOSE PROJECTS TO START AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY, SOON AFTER THE STAY HOME, STAY SAFE ORDER IS LIFTED. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WHICH ROADS WILL BE AFFECTED, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF ROADS. YOU CAN GO TO THE CITY'S WEBSITE AGAIN AND SEARCH FOR ROAD RESURFACING AND YOU WILL COME TO A WEBSITE WITH A FULL LIST. I ALSO WANT TO INFORM YOU THE CITY STAFF HAS BEEN MEETING ALONG WITH THE MAYOR AND OUR EMERGENCY OPERATION PROTOCOL FOR SOMETIME NOW. AS WE DO, THAT WE ARE COORDINATING ALL THE DIFFERENT OPERATIONS OF THE CITY AND HAVE THAT INTERFACE INTO THE OTHER EOCs THAT ARE ACTIVE. WE ARE ALSO STARTING TO PLAN FOR WHAT REOPENING LOOKS LIKE. REOPENING WILL NOT BE THE SAME AS WE WERE BEFORE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS YOU CAN IMAGINE. BUT WE ARE PLANNING FOR THAT AND YOU WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT AS WE CONTINUE OUR PLANS. LASTLY, I DO WANT TO REMIND ALL THE RESIDENTS WHO HAPPEN TO BE WATCHING TO CONTINUE TO STAY VIGILANT ON THE STAY HOME, STAY SAFE INITIATIVE. IT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE, AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT IN THE -- IN THE NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AND INFECTIONS. THAT'S ALL.
00:06:31.138: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE NOW HAVE AN INTRODUCTION. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S PRESENTATION TO COUNCIL OF THE PROPOSED FISCAL YEAR 2021 CITY BUDGET. MR. CRAWFORD.
00:06:49.523: >> City Admin. Crawford: ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE THE PRESENTATION, MAYOR?
00:06:52.726: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE.
00:06:53.360: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANK YOU. OKAY. SO TONIGHT, I WANT TO -- THE PLAN FOR TONIGHT IS TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL '21 BUDGET PRESENTATION. AS A REMINDER, THERE'S A CHARTER REQUIREMENT THAT THIS PRESENTATION IS PROVIDED TO YOU AT THIS MEETING IN APRIL AND THEN YOU GET TO VOTE ON IT THE SECOND MEETING IN MAY. BECAUSE THE BUDGET IS A LARGE AND COMPLEX PROCESS AND IT'S TIME CONSUMING, THIS PRESENTATION TONIGHT REALLY REFLECTS THE WORK FROM OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS AND NOT NECESSARILY THE PAST FOUR WEEKS. YOU KNOW, THIS BUDGET WAS PREPARED REALLY DURING A TIME THAT WE HAD A CRISIS IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAD THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT COUNCIL HAD DECLARED. WE'VE GOTNIFICANT STREET RESURFACING WORK TO BE DONE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT YOU GUYS HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT'S UNSUFFICIENT IN STOCK, AND THE NEED FOR A THE WATER PLANT PARTIAL REPLACEMENT. IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THAT, WE HAVE THIS DISASTER OF A PANDEMIC. WHILE THIS PRESENTATION IS GOING TO REALLY REFLECT A BASELINE BUDGET, NOT REALLY INCLUDING THE CORONAVIRUS, I WILL END THIS PRESENTATION WITH A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN THE CORONAVIRUS, WHAT PROJECTIONS WE ARE SEEING AND THEN AFTER MY PRESENTATION TONIGHT, YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE -- THE EFFECTS AND THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE EFFECTS THAT WE ARE HAVING. SO MOVING ON, IN THIS PRESENTATION, THIS IS -- I WANT TO REMIND YOU, THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR OF A TWO-YEAR PLAN. SO THAT'S DEVELOPED BY TAKING EXISTING ACTIVITIES WE HAVE, AND MOVING THEM FORWARD A YEAR, AND THEN ADJUSTING -- MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE IT WAS THE SECOND YEAR IN THE PLAN. ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS -- THIS DOCUMENT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE, YOUR DRAFT BUDGET BOOK WHICH IS NOW AVAILABLE TO YOU, BOTH ELECTRONICALLY ON THE WEB AND A HARD CAPPY IF YOU HAVE REQUESTED THAT, ARE -- HARD COPY IF YOU HAVE REQUESTED THAT, ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE IN YOUR INBOXES OR ONLINE. AS A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS BUDGET, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL FUND FIRST. THE GENERAL FUND'S RECURRING REVENUES ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE 3.6% AND THAT IS DUE TO THE PROPERTY TAX INCREASE WHICH PROWILL JECT 3.8%. 1.7% OF THAT IS FROM NET NEW CONSTRUCTION AND INVESTMENTS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY. THE REST IS FROM THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, KIND OF INFLATION INCREASE. WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE STATE SHARED REVENUE OR WHAT WE CALL CVTRS IS FLAT AS A RECURRING BASIS. WE ARE GROWING INTO HAVING SOME NONRECURRING OR ONE-TIME REVENUES AVAILABLE AND THAT TOTALS $247,000 THIS YEAR, AS WE HAD THAT TAKE EFFECT IN FISCAL '21. SO THE TOTAL REVENUES ARE ABOUT $1.26 MILLION. AND THOSE ONE-TIME SOURCES ARE COMING FROM THE FIRE PROTECTION GRANT MONIES THAT WE RECEIVED, THE PORTION OF STATE-SHARED REVENUE THAT I JUST MENTIONED AND OTHER SMALLER REIMBURSEMENTS. SEPARATE FROM THAT, THIS YEAR WE ALSO HAVE THE CONTINUATION OF THE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY AND MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE REBATE THAT. IS ABOUT -- YEAH, ABOUT $2.35 MILLION WE ARE EXPECTING OF UNRESTRICTED FUNDS. THOSE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED BASED UPON THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BOTH IN COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS, AVA AVARIETY OF COUNCIL RESOLUTION THAT WAS DONE IN MARCH OF 2019. LASTLY, THE UTILITY RATES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET, REFLECT THE COST TO DELIVER THE SERVICES OF OPERATIONS, THE COST TO MEET REGULATORY REQUIRE. S AND THE COST NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE CAPITAL PROJECTS FOR THOSE UTILITIES. WHEN I TALKED ABOUT PRIORITIES A MOMENT AGO, I DID WANT TO SHARE THIS SLIDE WITH YOU WHICH SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE KEY PRIORITIES THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES THAT THE GENERAL FUND AND THE MILLAGE ARE SEEKING TO ADDRESS AND THESE ARE THE LEVELS OF FUNDING WITHIN EACH OF THESE. AS WE HAD OUR WORK SESSIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, THESE ITEMS -- STAFF COMMENTED ON HOW THEY WERE GOING TO USE THESE ITEMS AND I THINK MOST OF THAT INFORMATION HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED TO YOU, BUT I WANTED TO SUMMARIZE WHAT ALL OF THOSE -- WHAT THOSE IMPACTS WERE. IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON ANYTHING IN THIS PRESENTATION, THERE WILL BE A TIME I WILL DICUSS THAT AT THE END -- I WILL DISCUSS THAT AT THE END THAT YOU CAN ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. STEPPING UP OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND AND LOOKING AT THE TOTAL CITY BUDGET. THIS IS $468 MILLION, ABOUT 25% OF THAT IS IN THE GENERAL FUND, $114 MILLION. AND THE NEXT BIGGEST CHUNK IS IN OUR ENTERPRISE FUND AT $121 MILLION. ALL OF THE FUNDS MEET THEIR POLICY GUIDELINES FOR FISCAL '21. AND IF THIS BUDGE ELIMINATE WERE APPROVED AS RECOMMENDED, THE TYPICAL TAXPAYER WOULD SEE AN INCREASE IN PROPERTY TAXES OF $6.99 A MONTH OR ABOUT $84 A YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THAT, IF IT WAS APPROVED ALL -- ALL THE UTILITY RATES WERE APPROVED, THEY WOULD SEE AN INCREASE OF $5.36 PER MONTH OR $64 PER YEAR TO SUPPORT THE UTILITIES. ON THE GENERAL FUND, I WANT TO GO INTO THAT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL, SINCE THAT IS AN AREA THAT GETS A LOT OF DISCUSSION. THIS FIRST SECTION HERE, AT THE TOP, TAKES EXISTING OPERATIONS FROM LAST YEAR -- ORIFICE CAL '20 AND LET'S SET THEM FORWARD ADJUSTING FOR ECONOMICS. THERE'S A $500,000 RECURRING SURPLUS. THIS IS A GOOD POSITION TO BE IN AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS WHAT WE HAD. THAT IS A GOOD POSITION GOING INTO THIS YEAR. THE NEXT SECTION DOWN, LOOKS AT A STAFF -- MET WITH YOU OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IN YOUR WORK SESSIONS. YOU WERE PRESENTED A NUMBER OF STAFF REQUESTS FOR FUNDS. THE FIRST SECTION HERE LOOKS AT THE RECURRING REQUESTS AND AFTER LOOKING AT THOSE REQUESTS, I INCORPORATED SOME OF THEM, AND AFTER INCORPORATING THE ONES I HAD ALONG WITH THE REVENUES, THE $500,000 RECURRING SURPLUS IS STILL IN PLACE. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT SECTION DOWN, THE NONRECURRING, THERE WAS, AS I INDICATED EARLIER, THERE WAS $1.26 MILLION IN NONRECURRING REVENUES BUT I'M RECOMMENDING A USE OF 1,000,930 FOR ONE-TIME EXPENDITURES THAT WILL UTILIZE THE HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF RECURRING SURPLUS AND REQUIRE THE USE OF $164,000 OF FUND BALANCE. NOW, AS I INDICATED THE FUND BALANCE IS WITHIN POLICY GUIDELINES. WE'RE AT ABOUT 18% GOING INTO THIS FISCAL YEAR AND SO WE WOULD END THE FISCAL YEAR AT ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT SINCE IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT BEING PLANNED AND BEING REDUCED. I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE ITEMS BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE RECURRING ITEMS INCORPORATED IN THIS BUDGET. THE ONE WAS AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE BEBA. AS THE REVENUE WENT UP, THE CONTRIBUTION FOR THE VEBA TRUST WENT UP. I WILL TALK ABOUT FTEs IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MANNER IN A FEW MOMENTS BUT I WILL COVER A COUPLE -- I WILL MENTION A COUPLE OF THEM HERE. F■OR THEPOLICE DEPARTMENT,WE ADDED $269,000 TO COVER DATA ANALYSTS, PROVIDE SOME FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY POLICING, TRAINING, AND SOME EQUIPMENT. THE HOUSING COMMISSION WAS ALSO ADDING AN FTE. THIS WAS A PERSON REIMBURSED TO THE GENERAL FUND BUT I HAVE TO INCLUDE IT AS A COST AS WELL. SO THERE WILL BE REVENUE OFFSETTING THIS ONE. AND THEN THE CITY ATTORNEYS AND THE DISTRICT COURT HAD SOME STAFFING ADJUSTMENTS THAT NEEDED TO BE MADE. AND THOSE ARE THE LARGER ITEMS THAT ARE HERE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SMALLER ITEMS, ALL OF WHICH WERE RAISED DURING THE WORK SESSIONS AND ARE AVAILABLE WITH MORE DETAIL IN THE BUDGET IMPACT SHEET YOU RECEIVED OR I CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION LATER AT YOUR REQUEST. THIS NEXT SLIDE LOOKS VERY SIMILAR, BUT IT'S THE ONE-TIME PRIORITIES OR ONE-TIME REQUESTS. THE LARGEST ITEM HERE, THIS IS THE 1,000,930 THAT I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. THIS LARGEST REQUEST IS A COUPLE OF CAPITAL PROJECTS TO PAVE HOLLYWOOD DRIVE AND ANN ARBOR SALIM ROAD, BOTH TOTAL $654,000. THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT WOULD HAVE A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT AGAINST THEM. SO THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS WOULD LIKELY BE REIMBURSED IN THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY OWNERS, BUT THEY DO NEED TO BE FRONTED FROM THE GENERAL FUND IF WE PROCEED WITH THESE PROJECTS. THE NEXT BIGGEST ITEM IS FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. $364,000 REPRESENTS SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO DEVELOP SOME ARCHITECTURAL PLANS FOR A FIRE STATION TO DO RENOVATIONS AT STATION ONE AND PROVIDE MODERNIZATION OF THEIR SOFTWARE AND, AGAIN, SOME EQUIPMENT REPAIRS. IN OUR NONDEPARTMENTAL AREA, YOU MAY RECALL THAT WE HAD A SINKING FUND NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO SET ASIDE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE BUILDINGS THAT WE HAVE. THAT FUND HAS NOT BEEN -- WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FUND THAT AT THE FULL AMOUNT THAT WE HAD WANTED TO ON A RECURRING BASIS. I, AGAIN, DID NOT DO THAT HERE BUT I PUT IN $92,000 AS A ONE-TIME TO GET THAT UP TO THE LEVEL THAT WE WANT IT. IT WILL RECEIVE THE FUNDING THIS YEAR, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE -- I DID NOT PROGRAM AS RECURRING THAT AMOUNT. I HAVE AN OVERHIRE REQUEST OF $160,000, TO HELP WITH THE CITY'S ONGOING SUCCESSION PLANNING EFFORTS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS FOR STAFF DEVELOPMENT. ONE IS THE FUTURE CORE PROGRAM, IN COORDINATION WITH THE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. AND THERE'S ALSO A DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION INITIATIVE THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH AND THIS PROVIDES FUNDING FOR THAT CONTINUED SUPPORT. THE RECOMMENDED BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES $100,000 FOR THE RESIDENT-DRIVEN SIDEWALK GAP PROGRAM AND $75,000 TO SUPPORT THE ELECTIONS THROUGH THE ELECTION EQUIPMENT AND THE SATELLITE OFFICE. THE REST OF THE ITEMS, AGAIN, ARE IN THE IMPACT SHEETS. I WON'T REVIEW THEM INDIVIDUALLY BUT HAPPY TO DISCUSS THEM AT A LATER TIME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. IN REGARDS TO FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES, THIS CHART SEEKS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THE EMPLOYEES CHANGE MOVING FROM FISCAL '20 TO FISCAL '21. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT FISCAL '20, WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED, DURING THIS FISCAL YEAR, THERE WERE TWO FTEs ON THE FIRST LINE THAT WERE ALREADY APPROVED IN FISCAL '20. THOSE ARE NOW BEING ROLLED THROUGH HERE AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE IMPACT IS. AS I INDICATED EARLIER, THIS -- I'M RECOMMENDING ADDING THE POLICE DATA A ANALYSTS AND THE STAFF ADJUSTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF DEPARTMENTS. THOSE ARE THE TWO INCREMENTAL FTEs THAT I RECOMMENDED FOR ACTION. AND THEN I ALSO RECOMMENDED THE FOLLOWING FOUR LINES WHICH START WITH THE MID-YEAR AND -- THE HOUSING COMMISSION OCCUPANCY SPECIALIST, WHICH IS ALSO APPROVED MID-YEAR. YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE HOUSING COMMISSION INSTEAD OF THE ROLE OF OUR INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS HAVE OUR EMPLOYEES IN THE GENERAL FUND, BUT IT'S REIMBURSED FOR THOSE POSITIONS FROM THE FUND SOURCES. THAT IS THE CASE WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION, IN THIS CASE, AS WELL AS THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS WHICH IS ONE THAT THEY REQUESTED AND ARE WILLING TO REIMBURSE AND WE INCLUDED HERE. YOU HEARD A RESTRUCTURING OF IT AND THOSE TWO FTEs ARE INCLUDED HERE AND ENGINEERING ALSO HAD TWO, ONE IN THE GENERAL FUND AND ONE NOT. LASTLY, WE REMOVED TWO POSITIONS. ONE WAS FROM CTN AND ONE WAS FROM SUBSISTENCE PLANNING ANDED THREE FOR POSITIONS FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS OFFICE. THREE POSITIONS FOR TH THIS IS THE RECOMMENDED BUDGET FOR UTILITIES AND WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THE WATER RATE OF INCREASE IS UP A LITTLE BIT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR TO 6.5% AND THE SEWER AND STORMWATER ARE DOWN A LITTLE BIT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. SO NOT -- NOT DOWN THE INCREASE IS LESS THAN WHAT WAS THE -- THE INCREASE WAS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE BOTTOM LINE EFFECT OF THAT IS AN INCREASE OF 7.5%, TO OUR TYPICAL RESIDENT, FOR UTILITIES. THIS IS ABOUT $16 A QUARTER. AGAIN, STEPPING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE TOTAL CITY BUDGET, THESE ARE ALL FUNDS COMBINED. I WILL THOUGHT IT WAS USEFUL TO ILLUSTRATE WHERE THE LARGEST PART OF YOUR MONEY IS GOING. THIS BUDGET RECOMMENDS I'M GOING TO GO DOWN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM THERE, THE UTILITIES HAVE A $60 MILLION IN TOTAL. THAT IS YOUR LARGEST EXPENDITURE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AND OTHER NEEDS IN THAT AREA, AS WELL AS OPERATIONS. AND THEN POLICE, STREET REPAIR, AND PAYING DOWN VARIOUS DEBTS, MAKE UP SOME OF THE OTHER HIGHEST ALLOCATIONS OF RESOURCES IN THIS BUDGET. THE CITY HAS BEEN MOVING TOWARDS USING PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND REPORTING THOSE. I WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT THE CITY USES A NUMBER OF MEASURES INTERNALLY. THESE ARE USED IN OUR QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE REVIEWS THAT WE HAVE INTERNALLY. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN MOVING FORWARD WITH WHAT WE CALLED STORYBOARD METRICS, WHICH PROVIDES SOME INSIGHTS TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS THAT STAFF WORKED TOWARD AND HAVE BEEN ACHIEVING. THESE METRICS STILL NEED SOME UPDATING ON OUR WEBSITE, BUT I WANTED TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION AND GIVE YOU A EXAMPLE OF THESE. WE WILL TIP EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR PERFORMANCE MEASURES AS WE GO FORWARD. AND AS FAR AS NEXT STEPS IN THE BUDGETING PROCESS, THERE ARE A FEW KEY DATES THAT ARE COMING UP. THE MAY 4th COUNCIL MEETING IS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON THE FEES AND THE BUDGET ARE SCHEDULED, FOLLOWED BY MAY 8th N WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FOR ALL OF YOUR BUDGET QUESTIONS SO WE CAN RESPOND TO THEM APPROPRIATELY BEFORE YOU THEN CONSIDER THE BUDGET ON MAY 18th. IF YOU ANTICIPATE HAVING BUDGET AMENDMENTS WE ASK THAT YOU GET A DRAFT -- DRAFT THOSE AND HELP US GET THOSE TO US SO WE CAN HELP YOU WITH THEM, BY MAY 13th. THAT WOULD ALLOW US THE TIME TO ENSURE THEY ARE IN PLACE AND WE HAVE THEM PREPARED FOR PUBLICATION ON MAY 18th. AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT I WANTED TO COVER ON THE FISCAL '21 BUDGET. I DO NOW WANT TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS, SINCE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING ON IN THAT AREA AND WE WILL PROVIDE YOU MORE INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. SO WHEN ANN ARBOR LOOKS AT THE CORONAVIRUS IMPACTS WE KIND OF FIRST LOOK AT THE SHORT AND THE LONG TERM. THE SHORT TERM, WE ARE CONSIDERING FISCAL '20 AND FISCAL '21 AND WHAT WE SEE IMMEDIATELY ARE HIGHER NEEDS AND LOWER REVENUES. THE LONGER TERM, FOR FISCAL '22 AND BEYOND, WE SEE SOME LEVEL OF THOSE TWO FACTORS HIGHER NEEDS AND LOWER REVENUES LIKELY OCCURRING, BUT ALSO IF THE IF MANY MARKETS DON'T REBOUND, WE WOULD SEE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RETIREMENT BENEFIT CONTRIBUTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, IN THIS CASE, ANN ARBOR IS POSITIONED TO HAVE A WORSE FINANCIAL IMPACTS THAT MOST OTHER COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE NOT USED TO THAT IN THIS COMMUNITY, BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THE STABILITY OF THE UNIVERSITY, AND WE HAVE HAD -- WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUFFER -- WE DON'T HAVE A LARGE CONCENTRATION OF EMPLOYMENT IN OTHER AREAS, LIKE WE DID BACK IN PFIZER. WELL, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, IN THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT WE HAD, THE CITY HAS -- PARTICULARLY THE GENERAL FUND HAS A SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON SEVERAL SOURCES OF REVENUE, WHICH ARE BEING IMPACTED. THE REVENUES WE FOCUSED ON MOST CLOSELY ARE THE PARKS AND RECS FEES AND THOSE OPERATIONS ARE NOT REALLY OPERATIONAL RIGHT NOW. THE STATE-SHARED REVENUE, THE REVENUE FROM THE DOWNTOWN PARKING, PARKING FINES AND PERMITTING AND INSPECTION FEES. AS WE SAID, WE LOOK AT THIS OVER A 24-MONTH PERIOD. WE DO THAT BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING AN ASSUMPTION THAT ANY SEMBLANCE OF NORMALITY WILL LIKELY NOT OCCUR UNTIL AT LEAST IMMUNIZATION IS IN MACE AND INOCULATIONS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE NOW AND THE SCENARIOS, A COUPLE OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS THAT WE SEE IS THE IMPACT OF U OF M FOOTBALL SEASON THAT HAS IMPACT FOR US, PARTICULARLY LIKELY IN THE UTILITY FUNDS FROM THE REDUCED USAGE OF -- OF WATER. AS WELL AS SOME PARKING IMPACTS. BUT ALSO ANOTHER U OF M OPERATION, IF FALL CLASSES ARE MOVED TO BE ONLINE, THAT COULD ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE SENSE THAT THE PARKING REVENUES AND FINES THAT THE CITY HAVE WOULD ALSO BE IMPACTED. THAT IS REALLY -- THOSE RISKS TRANSPIRING WOULD REALLY EXTEND THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS RATHER SEVERE DOWNTURN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THROUGH ANY RECOVERY OR ACTUALLY NOT ANY -- BUT THE RECOVERY WE WILL HAVE FROM THIS, IT WILL BE A MARATHON AND NOT A SPRINT AND BECAUSE OF THAT, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE RETAIN OUR FISCAL CAPACITY BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE CHALLENGES NOT ONLY NOW, BUT IN THE MEDIUM AND THE LONG TERM. WE NEED TO  TO PACE OURSELVES FR THESE EVENTS. SO TO PROVIDE SOME PROJECTIONS, WE HAVE GOT TWO SLIDES HERE. ONE IS WHAT WE WILL CALL THE OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO. THIS SLIDE SHOWS THREE BARS ON THE LEFT, REPRESENTING ONLY THE REVENUES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. IT DOES NOT TIE TO THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT'S THE REVENUES WE SAW THE MOST VULNERABLE AND SO THE THREE ON THE LEFT ARE FOR FISCAL '20 AND THE THREE ON THE RIGHT ARE THE FISCAL '21 AND WHAT YOU SEE ARE BUDGETED AND PROJECTED AND THE DIFFERENCE. ON WE SEE A POTENTIALLY $4.5 MILLION LOSS OF REVENUES IN THESE AREAS IN '20, FOLLOWED BY ABOUT A $6 MILLION LOSS OF INFORMATION IN FISCAL '21. THESE ARE VERY LARGE IMPACTS FOR A CITY OUR SIZE. YOU MAY RECALL THAT OUR UNASSIGNED FUND BALANCE IN THE GENERAL FUNDS GOING INTO THIS IS ABOUT $16 MILLION. IF WE LOOK AT OUR PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO AT THE SAME FORMAT, THE FISCAL '21 IMPACT IS ABOUT $5 MILLION AND THE FISCAL '21 WOULD BE $11 MILLION. SO STAFF IS WORKING ON PLANS FOR THIS AND AS I SAID, WE WILL SHARE MORE INFORMATION IF WE HAVE -- AS WE HAVE IT. I DO WANT TO TAKE -- THAT IS ALL THAT I HAVE FOR THIS PRESENTATION, BUT FOLLOWING THIS, WE HAVE ARRANGED TO HAVE A FEW PEOPLE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS OF THE VIRUS HAS BEEN -- OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT INCLUDES PRESENTATIONED BY NEA HASRA AND PAM SMITH FROM -- I'M SORRY, FROM COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND PAM SMITH FROM THE WASHTENAW UNITED WAY AND FOLLOWED BY PAUL CRUDKOW FROM SPARK. THAT ALLE'S ALL I HAVE FOR THIS PRESENTATION.
00:28:09.301: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION AS DESCRIBED.
00:28:19.445: >> City Admin. Crawford: NIA, ARE YOU ONLINE? IF YOU ARE ON, NIA, CAN YOU PLEASE UNMUTE YOUR PHONE?
00:28:38.163: >> Clerk Beaudry: TOM, I'M MOVING THEM OVER TO THE PANELISTS, JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT.
00:28:44.036: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANK YOU.
00:28:46.772: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:28:48.073: >> HEY, TOM, THAT WASN'T THE SILENT TREATMENT. I WASN'T ELEVATED YET.
00:28:54.013: >> City Admin. Crawford: GOT IT. YOU HAVE BEEN PROMOTED.
00:28:58.283: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EXALTED IN OUR EYES. [ CHUCKLES ]
00:29:04.623: >> City Admin. Crawford: NEEL, YOU ARE ABLE TO START WHENEVER YOU ARE READY.
00:29:07.226: >> OKAY. THAT SOUNDS GOOD AND THEN I WILL HAND OFF TO PAM IN A FEW MINUTES. FIRST OF ALL ON BEHALF OF ALL THE PRESENTERS, THANKS, TOM TO YOU AND YOUR GREAT TEAM. DURING THE CRISIS, MAYOR TAYLOR AND THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, YOUR SERVICE IS IMPORTANT MORE THAN EVER. WE WILL START OFF WITH PAM, TERESA AND I MYSELF, TALKING ABOUT EACH OF OUR INSTITUTIONS' INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS AND WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT OUR COLLECT ENVIRONMENT RESPONSE AND NOT JUST AMONG THE THREE OF US, BUT INCLUDING THE CITY AND OTHER PUBLIC FUNDERS AS WELL. WE WILL TALK ABOUT EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS THAT WE ARE REACTING TO AND THEN SHARE SOME CLOSING THOUGHTS FROM THE COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE, AND THEN THE THREE OF US WILL HAND IT OFF TO PAUL KRE APP KO AND THEN HE WILL DO A DEEPER DIVE INTO ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AND RESPONSES. TOM, IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I WANT TO START WITH GOOD NEWS FOR CITY COUNCIL, WHICH IS THAT WE FOR THE LAST DECADE HAVE HAD A HIGHLY COORDINATED AND INTEGRATED SAFETY NET IN WASHTENAW COUNTY AND IN ANN ARBOR. IT'S KNOWN AS THE WASHTENAW COORDINATED FUNDERS, IT'S A PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNER SCHEPP THAT'S -- PARTNERSHIP THAT'S HIDELY DEVELOPED AND WON AWARDS. AND NOW WE CAN LEVERAGE NINE YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION OF THAT MODEL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HELPING THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WE DON'T HAVE St. JOSEPH MERCY PRESENTING TONIGHT BUT THEY ARE A FANTASTIC PARTNER AS A HEALTH SYSTEM. IT'S NOT JUST A FUNDER BUT OBVIOUSLY ON THE FRONT LINE OF THIS CRISIS. AND TERESA LATER WILL SHOW MORE ABOUT HOW PUBLIC FUNDING WORKS AND HOW IT'S RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS. I WANTED TO HAND OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE, PAM SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF UNITED WAY OF WASHTENAW COUNTY TO TALK ABOUT THE UNITED WAY'S SPECIFIC RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS SO FAR. AND TOM, YOU CAN FLIP THE SLIDE. THERE YOU GO. AS WE ARE WAITING FOR PAM, WE CAN SKIP AHEAD, TOM, AND I CAN START WITH MY -- WHY DON'T WE START WITH THE FOUNDATION. I WANTED TO SHARE WITH THE COUNCIL THAT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, THE FOUNDATION HAS DISTRIBUTED OVER $1 MILLION SO FAR IN GRANTS IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS. THAT INCLUDES SOME ALLOCATIONS TO THE UNITED WAY'S RELIEF FUND, WHICH YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT NEXT. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED WAY. WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE ONE FRONT DOOR IN TERMS OF AI A PHILANTHRC GIVING. WE NEED TO MAIN TAPE THE STRENGTH OF THE LOCAL NONPROFIT ECOSYSTEM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE LOCAL SOCIAL SAFETY NET. THE FOUNDATION IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON OLDER ADULTS AS A PRIORITY BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE AND ASSETS IN THAT ERA. EAREA.AND LATELY WE HAVE BEEN G ON NONPROFITS AND SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE FACING UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF CHALLENGE. THE FOUNDATIONS HAVE BROADLY PHILANTHROPIC INSTITUTIONS AND SO WE INVESTED IN THE COUNTY AND SPARKS SMALL BUSINESS RESILIENCY FUND AND CREATE WASHTENAW AID FUND, WHICH WE THINK IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE ARTS INDUSTRY IS SO CRITICAL TO THE ECONOMIC AND THE CULTURAL VITALITY OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND THE LAST THING I WILL MENTION BEFORE WE GO BACK ONE SLIDE, TOM, IS THAT THE FOUNDATION IS REALLY TRYING TO BLEND THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS, GENERAL DATA FROM A LOT OF SOURCES, INSTITUTIONAL FEEDBACK FROM DO DOZENS AND DO DOZENS OF NONPROFITS AND PUTTING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER AND MAKING ONGOING EVOLVING STRATEGIC DECISIONS ON HOW OUR -- (NO AUDIO).
00:33:06.365: >> Clerk Beaudry: YEAH, I BELIEVE SHE'S BEEN PROMOTED AND SHE SHOULD HAVE AUDIO AND VIDEO.
00:33:12.037: >> YAY! CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? THANKS SO MUCH, NEEL, AND THANK YOU, MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN YOUR COMMUNITY. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING AND PROUD TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE ANN ARBOR AREA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, AND THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SO MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT WHEN THE PANDEMIC FIRST HIT, WE ANNOUNCED A GOAL OF $250,000 AND WITHIN JUST DAYS WE KNEW THAT THAT WAS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH AS THE PANDEMIC UNFOLDED, AND WE INCREASED THAT TO $1 MILLION GOAL TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE FOR THE NONPROFITS AND PROGRAMS THAT WERE HELPING THE FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND THE FRONTLINE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE CRITICALLY AND VULNERABLY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. SO THE $1 MILLION FUND, I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU, IT WILL BE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED ON WEDNESDAY, THAT WE HAVE, INDEED MET OUR $1 MILLION GOAL. SO WE'RE VERY, VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE MOST PROUD OF IS WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE GRANT PORTAL BEING OPENED, WE HAD DISTRIBUTED ALMOST $700,000 OF THAT BACK OUT TO THE COMMUNITY TO THE HIGHEST NEED AREAS AND TO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE DOING FRONT-LINE CRITICAL WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY. ANOTHER THING THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU KNEW ABOUT IS VOLUNTEER WASHTENAW.ORG IS RUN BY THE UNITED WAY AND IT BRINGS TOGETHER THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NOT ONLY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, BUT EMU, THE EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AS WELL. SO WE MOBILIZE NOT ONLY THE COMMUNITY BUT WE ARE MOBILIZING ALL OF THE STUDENTS AS WELL. THE VOLUNTEER WASHTENAW.ORG WEBSITE, HAS A COVID-19 RELIEF FUND -- I MEAN, A COVID-19 RELIEF RESOURCE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO VOLUNTEER CAN. AND THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS 211 IS A 24-HOUR CALL SYSTEM FUNDED AND SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED WAY AND THE COUNTY AS WELL. WE HAVE HANDLED THOUSANDS OF CALLS ALREADY. PRIORITY CALLS WE CAN DELINEATE BY ZIP CODE FOR YOU, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. THE CALLS THAT ARE COMING IN RIGHT NOW ARE MOSTLY FOR FOOD, FOOD ACCESS AND HOUSING. THE DATA GATHERED IS CRITICAL FOR US TO KNOW WHERE TO PUT OUR FUNDS AND WHERE TO PUT OUR ATTENTION IN COMMUNITY, BECAUSE IT HIGHLIGHTS HOTSPOTS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL CONTINUE DOING, 211 CALL SYSTEM IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE, BUT IT IS ESPECIALLY ALWAYS NEEDED DURING TIMES OF CRISIS. SO I'M AT MY TIME, AND I'M GOING TO HAND IT OFF TO TERESA GILOTTI WITH THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
00:35:56.535: >> THANKS, PAM, THANKS, NEEL. WE ARE ALWAYS SO PROUD TO BE PARTNERING THESE TWO. THERE'S SO MANY COORDINATION AROUND A LOT OF DIFFERENT RESPONSE AND WE ARE AS MANY SECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STAY COORDINATED. ONE IS AROUND THE HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WAS A CONCERN WAS THE CONGREGATE SHELTER AT DELONIS AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION TO EXTEND THE WARMING SHELTER SEASON AND THE LOCATIONS AVAILABLE FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION TO GET THOSE POPULATIONS DOWN TO A SMALLER SIZE. THIS INCLUDES FIVE DIFFERENT SITES, INCLUDING A HOTEL FOR SOME OF THOSE AGITATIONS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY REVIEWING AND EXPLORING HOW TO -- WHAT'S THE BEST RESPONSE. SO WE ARE EVALUATING DIFFERENT SITES AND YOU WILY MAKING SURE IT FITS WITHIN THE LARGER SYSTEM THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE COMING IN FOR SHELTER, THAT WE ARE STILL ASSESSING AND PUTTING THROUGH THE PROCESS TO MOVE THEM INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. SO THAT'S ONGOING, AND WE'RE DOING A LOT OF CONTINGENCY PLANNING, IN CASE WE DO SEE FAMILIES THAT ARE DOUBLED UP NOW, PERHAPS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS LATER ON AS WE SEE CONTINUED UNEMPLOYMENT. WE ARE JUST TRYING TO THINK AHEAD ON THE HOUSING SIDE. ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SIDE AND YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM PAUL, AND SPARK. BUT WE ARE EXCITED TO HAVE PARTNERED WITH ANN ARBOR SPARK ALONG WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER AND THE WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENTREPRENEUR CENTER, AND THE THE RESILIENCY. WE HAD A A NAME CHANGE. WE HAVE ABOUT $1.3 MILLION IN THAT FUND. WE ARE STILL REVIEWING APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE COMMITTED $577,500 WHICH IS AMAZING. AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ALL OF THAT MONEY OUT THE DOOR BY THE END OF THE MONTH. SO WE ARE FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT. WE HAVE REVIEWERS AND PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROCESS. WE HAD MORE THAN 1400 APPLICANTS WITH REQUESTS EXCEEDING $4.7 MILLION. SO OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S GREATER NEED. THAT'S WITH AN APPLICATION PROCESS THAT WAS OPENED ABOUT TWO WEEKS. SO WE KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH MORE NEED THERE BUT WE'RE EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THAT PROCESS. THE OTHER ELEMENT THAT WE ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN AROUND BOTH COMMUNICATION AND RESPONSE TO INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR NEEDS AS THEY ARE ONGOING IS THE BARRIER BUSTERS NETWORK. IT'S 100 NONPROFIT PARTNERS AND IN THIS NETWORK, WE HAVE THE BARRIER BUSTERS UNMET NEEDS FUND THAT SPECIFICALLY HELP WITH HOUSING, ADDICTION PREVENTION, UTILITY PAYMENTS AND -- EVICTION PREVENTION, UTILITY PAYMENTS, TRANSPORTATION, AND WE TRIED TO EXPAND IT FOR THE COVID-19 PROCESS. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE UNITED WAY, AND OTHERS AND WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT AS FLEXIBLE. SO IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL FOOD NEEDS OR CHILD CARE NEEDS, WHATEVER IT IS, WE CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT. I WILL STOP THERE. I KNOW THERE WILL BE MORE TOPICS THAT CONTINUE ON AND I WILL PASS IT BACK TO NEEL. AREOR IS IT ME? ID TO REMIND YOU AS THE COORDINATED UP FUNDERS. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS ONE OF THE FOUR MEMBERS, THAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE ANNUALLY ABOUT $5 MILLION IN GRANTS THROUGH SYSTEMS CHANGE, PROGRAM OPERATIONS AND THE CAPACITY BUILDINGS IN FOUR KEY TARGET AREAS, THE AGING SECTOR, HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS, SAFETY NET HEALTH AND NUTRITION AND THE CRADLE TO CAREER WHICH IS EARLY CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN COMBINED. SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE MORE THAN 40 LOCAL HUMAN SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS EVERY YEAR, AND THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND OPERATIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND WE HAVE BEEN REALLY LEANING ON THIS NONPROFIT SYSTEM, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS TO DELIVER THOSE EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND THEY HAVE REALLY COME THROUGH. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING RESPONSE. YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH COORDINATED FUNDING IS WE HAVE REALIZED IN THIS CRISIS, WHILE PEOPLE HAVE APPLIED TO A FORMAL PROCESS, TO RECEIVE FUNDING, WITHIN THIS -- JUST THIS LAST QUARTER OF FUNDING, WE HAVE ACTUALLY KIND OF SAID, IF YOU JUST NEED THESE DOLLARS TO BE FOR OPERATIONS, GO ED HAD A. AHEAD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO RESTRICTED TO THE PROCESS, BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CLIMATE. IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE DONE THROUGH THE L LAST QUARTER OF FUNDING AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WILL BE RESPONDING TO THE COVID SITUATION FOR, YOU KNOW, THREE MONTHS, SIX MONTHS, A YEAR AT LEAST INTO THE FUTURE. SO HE WITH WANT TO HAVE THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING SO MUCH OF THE WORK AND THE RESPONSE BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY SO THEY CONTINUE THE WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING. NOW, I WILL HAND IT BACK TO NEEL.
00:40:57.635: >> AND I WILL HAND IT OVER TO PAM.
00:40:59.270: >> I MEAN TO PAM!
00:41:08.279: >> OKAY. THERE WE GO. UNMUTE. WE WANT TO ABOUT SOME OF THE BASIC THINGS GOING IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE HIGHEST AREA NEEDS OF FOOD AND ADULT VULNERABILITY AND HOUSING INSECURITY AS WELL. SO WE ARE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH FOOD GATHERS AND A NUMBER OF THE FOOD PANTRIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT OFF THE BAT WAS THAT THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN WAS INTERRUPTED. 40% OF FOOD GATHERERS DONATIONS WHICH OPERATES AS THE SYSTEM'S FOOD BANK, THEY SUPPLY 153 FOOD PANTRIES IN OUR COMMUNITY, THEY SAW THEIR DONATIONS DECREASE BY ALMOST 40% BECAUSE A LOT OF IT CAME FROM RESTAURANTS AND GROCERIES. THERE WAS -- AT THE SAME TIME, A PERFECT STORM OF A FOURFOLD INCREASE IN DEMAND. SO FAMIL FAMILIES THAT NEVER USD SECURITY BANKS OR PANTRIES NOW NEED FOOD. COUPLE THAT WITH A REDUCTION OF VOLUNTEERS IN THEIR WAREHOUSE. THEY USE 40 TO 50 VOLUNTEERS A DAY TO MOVE FOOD THROUGH THEIR WAREHOUSE, AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER, WE SIMPLY COULDN'T HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN A WAREHOUSE. GRATEFULLY, THE NATIONAL GUARD IS NOW ASSIST ASSISTING AND MOVD THROUGH THE WAREHOUSE SO WE CAN GET IT OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT IN COMMUNITY. WITH REDUCED VOLUNTEERISM, BECOMES AN INCREASE IN STAFF COSTS. SO A LOT OF THE GRANTS FROM THE UNITED WAY ARE HANDLING INCREASED STAFF COSTS BUT THEY ARE SEEING OVERTIME AND NOT ONLY OVERTIME, BUT THEY ARE SEEING A LOT OF ADDITIONAL STRESS AND LONGER HOURS ON THE STAFF THAT THEY DO HAVE AVAILABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXPANDED EBT BENEFITS SHOULD RELIEF SOME PRESSURE ON EMERGENCY FOOD, AND THE SYSTEM IN OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED TO THE FOOD SECURE  SECURITY SYSTEM TOE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. I WILL LET NEEL TALK ABOUT OLDER ADULTS AT THIS POINT.
00:43:04.295: >> THANKS, PAM, AND TO BE CLEAR TO CITY COUNCIL, ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS YOU ARE HEARING FROM ARE WORKING IN ALL OF THESE SPACES. WE ARE JUST SPLITTING UP WOULD IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT SUBJECT -- UP WHO IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT SUBJECT MATTERS. THE FOUNDATION IS PRETTY INVOLVED WITH OLDER ADULTS. THERE'S A LOT OF CROSSOVER NEED. WE KNOW FROM HOUR NETWORKS OF NONPROFITS AND HEARING FROM OLDER ADULTS THEMSELVES THAT FOOD SECURITY AND HEALTHY FOOD IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE BEING FACED BY OLDER ADULTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT -- I'M SURE YOU HAVE HEARD OF CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES AND THE ACUTE ISSUES THERE, BUT THERE'S A MUCH BROADER SET OF ISSUES GOING ON IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA. ONE IS WHETHER OR NOT AN OLDER ADULT IS AFFECTED BY CORONAVIRUS ITSELF, MAINTAINING HEALTH IS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING IN A PHYSICALLY ISOLATED. IT'S MAINTAINING GENERAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL BEING AND SPEAKING OF WHICH, SOCIAL ISOLATION, WHICH IS A GROWING PROBLEM NOT ONLY IN ANN ARBOR, BUT THROUGHOUT MICHIGAN, IS EXACERBATED. MANY OF THE ACO OLDER ADULTS DOT HAVE INTERNET OR BROADBAND, AND IT'S UP MORE. A LOT OF OLDER AULTIMATE DIDS HAVE FANTASTIC -- ADULTS HAVE FANTASTIC LIVES EXPERIENCE AND PRIDE. WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS THAT THAT MEANS SOME OLDER ADULTS WHO COULD USE OUR HELP COLLECT ENVIRONMENTALLY DO NOT REACH OUT. WE REALIZE WE HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE AND NOT JUST ASSUME THAT OLDER ADULTS WILL COME TO US WITH THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CAREGIVING BOTH PROFESSIONAL, AS WELL AS INFORMAL HAS BEEN STRAINED FOR A LONG TIME, AS FAMILIES HAVE DISPERSED OVER THE DECADES. AND SO, WE KNOW THAT THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVING NETWORKS HAVE SUFFERED FROM LOW RETENTION AND LACK OF AFFORDABILITY FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT. THAT'S BEING EXACERBATED AND WE WILL POINT OUT THAT IT'S GETTING MUCH HARDER AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS. THAT FAMILIES ARE HAVING MORE TROUBLE AND NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS, CARING FOR THE OLDER ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES. AND THEN THE LAST POINT I WILL MAKE IS THAT THE DISRUPTIONS BEING EXPERIENCED BY OLDER ADULTS WILL NO DOUBT EXTEND BEYOND THE PANDEMIC PERIOD. WHEN WE ARE IN RECOVERY AND SOME OF US ARE GOING BACK TO PHYSICAL OFFICES, THERE ARE STILL MANY, MANY ISSUES FROM TESTING TO ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, TO PHYSICAL MOBILITY, THAT WILL MEAN THAT MANY OLDER ADULTS WILL BE ON THE TRAILING END OF THAT RECOVERY CURVE AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO HAND OFF TO TERESA.
00:45:45.556: >> THANKS, NEEL. SO WELCOME ALL OF THIS IS IN INTERCONNECTED AND HOUSING IS CONNECTED TO FOOD AND ACCESS, ALL OF THESE THINGS. THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING VERY CLOSELY AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE TOO, IS WHILE WE HAVE THIS GREAT STATE EVICTION MORATORIUM THAT HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH MAY 15th AND ALSO, A MORATORIUM ON FEDERALLY-BACKED MORTGAGES WHICH EXTEND THROUGH AUGUST. DURING THAT TIME AS PEOPLE HAVE LOST JOBS, IF THEY HAVE BECOME UNEMPLOYED OR LAID OFF, WHILE WE DO HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT COMING IN AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A STIPEND, WE ARE ALSO ACCRUING BACK MORTGAGE PAYMENTS, POSSIBLY BACK UTILITY PAYMENTS AND THEY WILL SIEG SURGE AT A PT IN TIME. WE ARE CONCERNED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL RENTER AND THE LANDLORDS, ACTUALLY, WHO WON'T BE ABLE TO REV  RECEIVE THOSE FS TO MAINTAIN THEIR PROPERTIES. IT'S A WHOLE INTERCONNECTED SYSTEM AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS AN ISSUE NATIONALLY. LEGAL SERVICES AT SOUTH CENTRAL MICHIGAN IS PUTTING TOGETHER AN UPDATED DOCUMENT THAT THEY WILL BE SHARING OUT THIS WEEK, THAT SPECIFICALLY NOW HAS ACCESS TO THE DATABASE OF ALL THE FEDERALLY-BACKED MORTGAGES AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT MORE BROADLY FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND IF THE PROPERTY THAT THEY LIVE IN HAS THAT FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGE AND PROTECTION THROUGH AUGUST. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP IS A STRATEGY ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT THOSE RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS, AS THEY START TO GET BEHIND PERHAPS ON THEIR PAYMENTS, ON THEIR MORTGAGES AND HOW WE CAN KEEP THEM AS CLOSE TO CURRENT AS WE CAN SO WE DON'T HAVE THIS SURGE OF E EVICTIONS IN THE SUMMER AND THE EARLY FALL. IT'S ONE THE THINGS THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING NUTS TO CRACK BECAUSE IT'S EVERYWHERE AND IT'S THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND REALLY GOING TO NEED STATE AND FEDERAL SUPPORT, BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO WHAT WE CAN LOCALLY TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST APPROACH AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE WORKING ON. SOME THE C.A.R.E.S ACT FUNDING WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT SOME OF THAT. SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK COMING ON IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND WE CAN ROLL OUT SOMETHING COMPREHENSIVE PRETTY SOON. I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND THIS IS WHERE PAM IS GOING NEXT, WE DO SEE THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY IN THE HOUSING AREA IS BEING VERY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. SO THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE BARRIER BUSTERS FUND THAT HAVE BEEN USED HAVE BEEN USED THROUGH THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY CURRENTLY. WE ARE SEEING THAT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T HAVE TRADITIONAL LEASES. SO THEY ARE NOT PROTECTED BY THE EVICTION MORATORIUM. MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE A LEASE. MAYBE IT'S NOW MONTH-TO-MONTH. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS IN PLACE, PARTICULARLY IN THEY ARE UNDOCUMENTED. SO THAT'S AN AREA OF GROWING NEED THAT I JUST WANT TO LIFT UP. AND THEN HAND IT OFF TO PAM, WHO ISIIS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS OF COVID-19.
00:48:42.099: >> THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE COUNCIL'S ATTENTION AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS. I KNOW THAT WE ARE SENDING A LOT OF INFORMATION YOUR WAY THIS A QUICK MAPP MANNER, BUT WE FEEL S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THIS IN FRONT OF YOU AND ALL THREE OF US WOULD ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS AT YOUR LEISURE AT THIS MEETING OR ANOTHER TIME. FEEL FREE TO GET OUR EMAIL ADDRESSES FROM YOUR C STAFF. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DESPERATE IMPACTS OF THIS CRISIS. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT RECENTLY RELEASED A STATISTIC THAT WHILE AFRICAN AMERICANS MAKE UP 12% OF OUR POPULATION, OVER 48% OF THE WASHTENAW COUNTY CASES WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASED -- AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF RACIAL ATTACKS XENOPHOBIA ON AFRICAN AMERICANS. THERE WAS A NONPROFIT THAT HELD A CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE AND EQUITY AND THE COVID PANDEMIC. WE HAD OVER 300 PEOPLE ON A CALL, IN ZOOM MEETING, THAT REALLY WANTED TO DIG INTO THIS AND TALK MORE ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL AND HISTORICAL RACISM AND INEQUITIES THAT EXIST. THERE'S ALSO GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES AND ALTHOUGH THE EXAMPLE I'M USING IS FROM MANCHESTER, THIS HAPPENS ALSO IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. THERE ARE REAL POCKETS OF PROBLEMS WITHIN ANN ARBOR. MANCHESTER, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS NO PHARMACY. THEY JUST LOST ONE, THEIR LAST ONE. THEY HAVE NO GROCERY STORE. SO THEY HAVE A 15-MINUTE DRIVE IN ANY DIRECTION TO GET TO A GROCERY STORE. AND MORE THAN HALF DON'T HAVE BROADBAND FOR STUDENTS. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW QUICKLY PROBLEMS ESCALATE, WHEN THESE KINDS OF THINGS PILE UP ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER. WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT SOCIAL ECONOMIC DISPARITIES. AND IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, THERE ARE REAL POCKETS OF POVERTY. THERE IS EXCEPTIONAL NEED WITHIN WASHTENAW COUNTY. AND ALICE DATA. ALICE IS A REPORT. IT STANDS FOR ASSET LIMITED INCOME CONSTRAINED BUT EMPLOYED, IT'S A REPORT THAT WE DID THAT SHOWED OVER 37% OF THE POPULATION IN WASHTENAW COUNTY WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING AND THIS PAN TERMIPPANDEMIC HAS EXACERBAE SITUATION. THEY MADE NUMEROUS GRANTS TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE HELPING PEOPLE WITH ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE. JUST IMAGINE IF YOU WERE TRYING TO DO ANY KIND OF PAPERWORK ONLINE OR ANY KIND OF INTERNET FORM AND INTERNET WAS YOUR SECOND LANGUAGE. IT'S SO HARD ALREADY, LET ALONE HAVING ANOTHER HURDLE IN FRONT OF YOU. NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. I JUST WANTED TO PUT THIS IN FRONT OF YOU AS WELL. SO THE POVERTY RATE IN ANN ARBOR IS 22%, BUT A LARGE PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF STUDENTS. SO WE BROKE IT OUT BY AGE SO THAT YOU COULD IN ANN ARBOR, THERE ARE STILL 12%, 10% OF CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. ALMOST UP TO 15 TO 16, IN THE 12 TO 17-YEAR-OLD AGE RANGE. THE NEXT SLIDE SHOWS THE STUDENT GROUP. WE HAVE SENIORS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR LIVING IN POVERTY THAT NEED OUR HELP. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HERE DURING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN. WE ARE PROUD PARTNERS OF THE CITY WITH THE OFFICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB DURING THIS. NEEL WAS BEING HUMBLE, I THINK IN HIS TELLING, BUT THE DONOR AT THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION CONTRIBUTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT TO THE COVID RELIEF FUND AND SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BEFORE I HAND IT BACK OVER TO NEEL IS WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE. NOW MORE THAN EVER, IT'S IMPORTANT TO LIVE UNITED AND WE APPRECIATE ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT YOU ARE MAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CITY. SO TO THE MAYOR AND TO THE CITY COUNCIL, THANK YOU.
00:52:55.486: >> THANKS, PAM. AND FAR BE IT FOR TERESA, PAM AND ME TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BUT WE HAVE SOME FRIENDLY SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW YOU MAY WANT TO FRAME HOW THE CITY RESPONDS TO THIS. AND WE PUT OUR HANDS TOGETHER BUT PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS. WHILE WE CAN BUILD NEW THINGS IT'S BETTER TO LEVERAGE WHAT ALREADY EXISTS TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND MOST EFFECTIVELY WITH YOUR PUBLIC DOLLARS AND PAM AND I THINK ABOUT IT IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WITH THE PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS. YOU HAVE A COORDINATED FUNDING PARTNERSHIP THAT'S AN EXCELLENT PLATFORM FOR MAKING INVESTMENTS INTO THE LOCALS SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND IT'S WORKING RIGHT NOW. I ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO COLLABORATE STRONGLY. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT TOM HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC LIAISON, AND HOSTED A GREAT CONVERSATION AMONG SEVERAL MULTISECTOR LEADERS THAT HELPED US ALL KEEP INFORMED WITH ONE ANOTHER. THAT WAS PLAYING TO ONE OF WHY YOU ARE STRENGTHS AND IT WAS VERY COLLABORATIVE AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE. WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT COORDINATED FUNDING AND TERESA TOLD YOU ABOUT BARRIER BUSTERS. IT IS A GREAT WAY  AND AN EXISTING INVESTMENT BY THE CITY TO GET DOLLARS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST AND OVERSEEN BY CASE MANAGERS TO MAKE SURE THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING USED RESPONSIBLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND THE CITY HAS A LONG STANDING SET OF INVESTMENTS IN THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION AS TERESA HIGHLIGHTS AND THOSE CERTAINLY SHOULD CONTINUE AS HOUSING INSECURITY INTRODUCES NEW DIMENSIONS OF RISK DURING THE CRISIS. I REALLY LIKE TOM'S COMMENT THAT THIS IS A MARATHON AND NOT A SPRINT. WE HEARD FROM MULTIPLEST PERTS ON CRISIS SCENARIOS AT THE -- MULTIPLE EXPERTS ON CRISIS SCENARIOS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. YOU HAVE TO RETAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER CAPACITY FOR THE LONGER TERM BECAUSE THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF ANY CRISIS ARE LONG AND INTENSE AND THAT WILL BE EVEN MORE SO FOR AN UNHEARD OF CRISIS LIKE THE ONE WE ARE FACING. SO I THINK TOM'S ADVICE IS SPOT ON. AND THEN FINALLY, HOW WE ALL OPERATE IS, YOU KNOW, WE ALL HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS WHETHER THOSE ARE TAXPAYERS OR DONORS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE -- WE LOOK AT DATA, WHEN ALL OF US MAKE DECISIONS AS INSTITUTIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU RELY ON STAFF AND/OR EXPERTS WHO ARE ON THE GROUND, IN THE FIELD, PAYING ATTENTION TO THEIR EXPERTISE AND ABLE TO INFORM YOU ON WHAT YOUR BEST USE OF RESOURCE AND ACTIVITIES MIGHT BE. AND FINALLY, I WANT TO JUST EMPHASIZE AND I KNOW TERESA DOES TOO, PAM'S COMMENTS ABOUT EQUITY. AND WE HAVE LAID BEAR THE INEQUITIES IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AS WELL AS WASHTENAW COUNTY. AND SO AS YOU MAKE HARD DECISIONS AND ALL OUR DECISIONS ARE HARD AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES WE ALL ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP EQUITY IN MIND, BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THE DATA SHOWS THAT SOME ARE AFFECTED MUCH MORE THAN OTHERS AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT EVERYONE IS NOT SUFFERING. EVERYBODY IS, BUT THERE ARE INEQUITIES IN HOW THIS CRISIS IS AFFECTING PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND WITH, THAT ACTUALLY, WE WANTED TO SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE BIT AND I WANTED TO HAND IT BACK TO TERESA, TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OFFICE THE COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORK IN ADDITION TO THE COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PLAN.
00:56:08.212: >> THANKS, NEEL. I MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT OF THIS BEFORE, RELATED TO THE SMALL BUSINESS RESILIENCY FUND BUT AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NONPROFITS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE, IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR GOAL AS A GREAT EMPLOYER AND CONSISTENT EMPLOYER, IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO THEY DO EMPLOY NATIONWIDE ABOUT 10% OF THE NATIONAL WORK FORCE, AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO -- SOMETIMES WE SEPARATE NONPROFITS AND SMALL BUSINESS TOGETHER BUT AS FAR AS PEOPLE WHO ARE HIRING PEOPLE, DEVELOPING PEOPLE AND EMPLOYING FOLKS, THEY ARE KIND OF INTERTWINED. AND WHILE WE ARE A PART OF ADMINISTERING THE SMALL BUSINESS RESILIENCY FUND AND UNITED WAY WAS DOING THE NONPROFIT, WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN CONTACT AND REFERRING PEOPLE BACK AND FORTH AS THAT PROCESS WENT ALONG. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT IS GOING ON AND I'M SURE PAUL WILL GET INTO THIS IN JUST A SECOND THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST AND REQUEST OUTSIDE OF FUNDING, WHICH IS NUMBER ONE, OF COURSE, AROUND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM BUSINESSES. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I SHIFT MY BUSINESS TO SURVIVE IF THIS CONTINUES ON OR IF I HAVE TO FUNCTION WITH LESS STAFF OR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AT SPARK, AND AT THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER, AND THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP CENTER AND THAT GOES FOR THE NONPROFITS AS WELL, WHO ARE DOING ALL OF THEIR WORK REMOTELY, AND IT'S A HUGE SHIFT AND HOW DO WE MOVE TO THE NEXT STEP. I WILL HAND IT OFF TO PAUL, WHO WILL GET IN MORE DEEPLY NOW ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SIDE AND WHERE WE ARE.
00:57:44.541: >> HELLO. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO LOAD THE PRESENTATION. THERE WE GO. SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING US TALK WITH YOU TONIGHT. THESE ARE VERY CHALLENGING TIMES AND THE GROUP OF FOLKS THAT ARE MEETING WITH TONIGHT ARE WORKING VERY, VERY HARD TO MEET THE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE IMMENSITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING, AND HOW WE NEED TO REALLY BE SMART AND THINK THROUGH HOW WE ARE GOING TO RESPOND. SO A FEW POINTS ARE ON THE SCREEN. I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH A COUPLE OF THEM IN MORE DETAIL ON THE FOLLOWING SLIDE. BUT RELATIVE TO UNEMPLOYMENT, THIS IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF CLAIMS IN HISTORY OF MICHIGAN SYSTEM. FAR SURPASSING WHAT WE EXPERIENCED IN GREAT RECESSION IN 2008. WHAT IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THIS, IS THAT THE SHORTNESS OF THAT HAPPENING, THE GREAT RECESSION UNFOLDED OVER A NUMBER OF MONTHS, BUT I WILL SHOW YOU THAT A SECOND ON A SLIDE. OUR ECONOMY HAS EVOLVED SINCE 2008, WITH MANY MORE PEOPLE WORKING IN WHAT WE CALL THE GIG ECONOMY. MANY MORE PEOPLE WORKING IN FACE-TO-FACE BUSINESSES AS OPPOSED TO MANUFACTURING. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT IN THE PAST, SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION, WE HAVE EVOLVED IN PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT FROM BEING TWO-THIRDS MANUFACTURING TO -- TWO-THIRDS MANUFACTURING AND ONE-THIRD PROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL TO REVERSING THAT. SO THERE'S MANY MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYING THEMSELVES. THE FIRST WAVE OF COMPANIES WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED ARE REALLY THOSE PEOPLE FACING BUSINESSES. AND THAT'S DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE -- THAT WITH SOME OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMMING, LARGER SCALE BUSINESSES HAVE GONE TO THE BANKS FOR ASSISTANCE. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE ASSISTANCE WE HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTING, IS IT IS THE RESTAURANTS, THE RETAIL, THE PERSONAL CARE, THE FACE-TO-FACE KIND OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE REALLY COME FORWARD FOR THE PROGRAMMING THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON. IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORT, AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM IN A COUPLE OF SLIDES, BUT I THINK AS YOU HEARD, THE $350 BILLION THAT WAS FOCUSED ON CERTAIN CATEGORIES AND SIZES OF BUSINESSES WAS EXHAUSTED. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT CONGRESS WILL APPROVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TOMORROW, BUT JUST IN THE CASE OF OUR OWN SMALL PROGRAM THAT TERESA DESCRIBED, YOU KNOW, WE HAD $20 MILLION WORTH OF GRANT REQUESTS AGAINST ONLY HAVING $1.6 MILLION AVAILABLE. AND THE REVENUE LOSSES, I THINK, ARE REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE AS YOU THINK ABOUT WAYS TO IMPACT AND HELP BUSINESSES, THAT ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR CATEGORY, VERY SMALL BUSINESSES, THE -- OUR ABILITY TO HELP THEM IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED BECAUSE THE AVERAGE LOSS IN A MONTH'S TIME IS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF $50,000. AND AS WE POINT OUT HERE, THE RESTAURANTS ARE OPERATING AT 10% OF THEIR NORMAL REVENUE. WHAT HAPPENED AT SPARK, IS BECAUSE OF THE PLATFORM THAT THE PARTNERS HAVE PUT TO GO, THE PUBLIC SECTOR, OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS, OUR ACSEMAK PARTNER -- ACADEMIC PARTNERS WE HAVE A STRUCTURE IN PLACE WHO HAVE ALLOWED OTHERS WHO WANT TO SUPPORT AND PROVIDE MONEY TO HELP BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE, WE PROVA WAY FOR THAT MONEY TO GET TO THEM, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE STRUCTURE TO MANAGE THAT MONEY AS A FIDUCIARY. AND SO SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS WE HAVE THE FOUNDATIONS AND THEN WE HAVE AN MECD PROGRAM THAT I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT IN A COUPLE OF SLIDES. BUT THEN VERY COMMUNITY-MINDED INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING FORWARD AND SAYING, WE WANT TO DO THESE PROGRAMS, A2 HELPS, A2 NEIGHBORS ARE CONNECTING RESTAURANTS TO HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND SO IT'S A SMALL PROGRAM. MONEY COMES INTO IT. WE TURN IT INTO GIFT CARDS, WHICH THEN TURN INTO BENEFITS TO THOSE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS. SO WE ARE WORKING IN A VARIETY OF WAYS USING OUR PLATFORM TO HELP THE COMMUNITY DELIVER THESE RESOURCES. NEXT SLIDE, TOM. SO, YOU KNOW, I MENTIONED THE UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THIS IS JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THAT. THE SPIKE AT THE LEFT WAS THE GREAT RECESSION, AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THIS SLIDE IS THAT IT HAD THAT EFFECT OF THE BUILDUP OF UNEMPLOYMENT OVER TIME, TO GET TO THE PEAK OF JANUARY 24th, 2009. YOU GO TO THE FAR RIGHT SIDE, WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT NOT ONLY DID -- IS OUR PEAK NOW HIGHER IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN THAN IT WAS IN 2009, BUT HOW THE CLAIMS CAME IN RAPIDLY, ALL AT ONCE, IS QUITE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. SO BASICALLY, THE CLAIMS THAT WE HAD IN 2009, OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, WERE SURPASSED IN ALMOST ONE WEEK'S TIME, IN TERMS OF THIS RECESSION. THIS SCALE FOR US, WE DON'T HAVE A PICTURE IN WASHTENAW COUNTY UNEMPLOYMENT YET, WE WILL GET THAT SOON, BUT TO FRAME THIS FOR YOU, PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT AND STATE OF MICHIGAN IS ABOUT $4.75 MILLION. PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT ON THE UNIVERSITY IS NOT IN THAT CATEGORY, AND WASHTENAW COUNTY IS ABOUT $195,000. SO WE ARE ABOUT 4%. SO JUST IF YOU JUST SAY WE ARE TRACKING THE STATE, 4% AGAINST THAT UNEMPLOYMENT TOTAL WILL SAY WE MIGHT HAVE $15,000 INDIVIDUALS CLAIMING UNEMPLOYMENT RIGHT NOW WHO WEREN'T DOING SO A MONTH AGO IN WASHWASWASHTENAW COUNTY. WHEN WE GET MORE DATA, WE WILL SHARE IT WITH YOU. NEXT SLIDE, TOM. AND THIS IS JUST A SLIDE FOR YOUR BENEFIT, IS THE $2 TRILLION THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED IS BROKE OUT INTO THESE VARIOUS FUNDING STREAMS. AND WE HAVE KIND OF SUMMARIZED IT FOR YOU ON THE RIGHT. AND OBVIOUSLY, COMPONENTS OF THESE DIFFERENT STREAMS ARE GOING TO FLOW INTO WASHTENAW COUNTY IN DIFFERENT WAYS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- I THINK ONE OF -- JANE MIGHT HAVE POINTED OUT TO ME, OR SOMEONE ELSE ON THE COUNCIL, WAS THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL BLOCK GRANT MONEY COMING, AS WELL AS EDA MONEY, BUT TERESA WILL TELL YOU, WE DON'T KNOW -- WE DON'T KNOW THE RULES YET. THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT. NOW, TO CALIBRATE THAT FOR YOU $5 BILLION IN CDBG IS MORE THAN HAS EVER BEEN ALLOCATED IN RECENT YEARS. IT'S BEEN IN THE LITTLE $3.5 MILLION RANGE, I THINK TERESA, IF I'M NOT CORRECT. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. EDA HAS NEVER HAD $1 BILLION EVER. AND SO WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THE RULES ARE, BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO PURSUE THOSE AS A TEAM, WHEN THAT HAPPENS. NEXT SLIDE, TOM. IN TERMS OF THE CARE CASH, THE MONEY THAT'S GOING TO INDIVIDUALS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS DATA, BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE IT WITH YOU. THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS PUT OUT, COUNTY BY COUNTY AROUND THE UNITED STATES. FOR WASHTENAW COUNTY, THE CHECKS THAT ARE COMING AND COMING IN WAVES IF YOU WILL, WILL BE ABOUT $259 MILLION. YOU CAN SEE ON THE SCREEN, THAT'S ABOUT $1,800 PER HOUSEHOLD AND WE EXPECT 140,000 HOUSEHOLDS IN WASHTENAW COUNTY WILL BE RECEIVING FUNDING UNDER THE -- FROM THE CARES ACT. IN TERMS OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. IN S.NEXT SLIDE, TOM. YOU HEARD ABOUT THE PAY CHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM AND THE VARIOUS SBA PROGRAMS. WHAT WE ARE DOING AT SPARK, IS WE ARE WORKING WITH COMPANIES AND CONNECTING THEM TO THESE RESOURCES. I'M SURE YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE MEDIA. THERE'S SOME REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE RULES AROUND THESE PROGRAMS AND IS THE MONEY GETTING TO THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT IT NEEDS TO GET TO? AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS BEING DEBATED IN WASHINGTON AS WE SPEAK. BUT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A SENSE THAT IF THEY REFUND THESE PROGRAMS, WE'RE EXPECTING ANOTHER 310 BILLION IN THE PAY CHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM AND 60 BILLION IN THE ECONOMIC -- THE INJURY DISASTER PROGRAM. WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU, I DON'T HAVE A WINDOW IN WHAT ALL THE BANKS ARE DOING IN WASHTENAW COUNTY, BUT I DO HAVE A WINDOW INTO WHAT THE BANK OF ANN ARBOR HAS DONE. UNDER THE PAY CHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM, BANK OF ANN ARBOR HAS MADE LOANS TO 583 CLIENTS. FOR A TOTAL OF $195 MILLION. AND TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, BANK OF ANN ARBOR, IN THE PAST, WAS NOT A SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION LENDER, BUT WHEN THEY STRUCTURED THAT PROGRAM, THEY GAVE THAT AUTHORITY OUT TO COMMUNITY BANKS FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND TIM MARSHALL TOLD ME JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO, IF CONGRESS APPROVES THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING, THEY ARE IN LINE FOR ANOTHER $400 MILLION THAT THE BANK OF ANN ARBOR COULD LEND AND THAT WOULD BE ABOUT 125 MORE LOANS HE EXPECT THAT THEY WILL MAKE. SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE, THESE PROGRAMS YOU ARE HEARING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND AS WE GET MORE INFORMATION, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAS PNC DONE IN ANN ARBOR, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAS, YOU KNOW, OTHER INSTITUTIONS DONE, WE WILL TRY TO GET THAT TO YOU, BUT WE HAVE A -- YOU KNOW THE HOME GROWN COMMUNITY BANK, BANK OF ANN ARBOR AND THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THIS PROGRAM. SKIPPING AHEAD, TERESA TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT, TOM, IF YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT ONE AFTER THAT. WE -- BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE, TERESA INITIALLY CAME TO US AND SAID, YOU KNOW, THE COUNTY IS NOT REALLY IN -- HAS THE STRUCTURE OR THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES AND COULD WE HELP WITH THAT? SO THE COUNTY INITIALLY SEEDED THIS SMALL BUSINESS GRANT FUNDING AND WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO IS HIGHLIGHT AND THANK THE OTHERS ON THE SCREEN, THE COUNTY OBVIOUSLY TOOK THE LEAD IN THIS, BUT WE HAVE NOW BEEN ABLE TO GET GRANTS FROM NOT ONLY FROM NEEL'S ORGANIZATION, BUT FROM THE NEW ECONOMY INITIATIVE, FROM THE WILSON FOUNDATION, THE BANK OF ANN ARBOR, PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP CONTRIBUTED MONEY TO BE TARGETED TOWARD TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN PITTSFIELD. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, VERY, VERY GENEROUS, DOUG AND LYNN SONG PROVIDED $1 MILLION WORTH OF RESOURCES TO DO THESE KINDS OF ASSISTANCE. BUT THE NUMBERS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, THIS SLIDE IS A LITTLE -- AS OF NOON, I THINK, TERESA MENTIONED A LARGER AMOUNT. WE HAVE DONE 162 OF THESE BY NOON, BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER AT THE LEFT, 1400 APPLICATIONS, 4.7 MILLION REQUESTED AND WE ONLY HAD THE 1.3 MILLION AVAILABLE. AS WE GET MORE MONEY, IF WE CAN, IF OTHERS STEP FORWARD, WE ARE READY AND WILLING TO JUST FUNNEL THAT RIGHT OUT TO THOSE BUSINESSES. SPARK ALSO, NEXT SLIDE, TOM, THE STATE USES ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SPARK TO DELIVER SUPPORT AS WELL. THERE'S TEN REGIONS IN THE STATE. YOU MIGHT HAVE RECALLED THE REGIONAL PROSPERITY INITIATIVE WAS A STRUCTURE THAT WAS SET UP. WE QUARTERBACKED THAT FOR OUR WASHTENAW COUNTY AND FIVE OTHER COUNTIES. AND THE STATE -- THE STRATEGIC FUND BOARD APPROVED SOME FUNDING FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF MICHIGAN, $10 MILLION FOR GRANTS AND $10 MILLION FOR LOANS. AND WE -- WE HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERING THAT PROGRAM. WE ALLOCATED THE MONEY AMONG THE COUNTIES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THEY HAVE. AND SO WE DISTRIBUTED ABOUT $380,000 IN GRANTS IN TERMS OF -- NO, 327 IS THE EXACT NUMBER. SORRY ABOUT THAT. IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. AND SO WE WERE -- THOSE COMPANIES THAT CAME IN, BASICALLY HAD THAT MANY EMPLOYEES. THEY HAD LAID OFF THAT MANY AS TO HOW MUCH REVENUE THEY HAD LOST AND WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE 66 GRANTS OF $5,000 TO THOSE COMPANIES. THE LOANS, WE -- THE STATE SET A STRUCTURE THAT IT -- THE MINIMUM LOAN SIZE WAS $50,000, AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO SEND SIX LOANS TO THE STATE. THE STATE IS ACTUALLY MAKING THE DECISIONS. WE'RE -- WE PACKAGE THE LOANS UP AND THEN THEY HAVE THEIR OWN UNDERWRITING EFFORT TO FINALIZE THAT PROCESS. WHAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU, JUST TO CLOSE THIS OUT, ON THE NEXT SLIDE, IS WHERE THE APPLICATIONS CAME FROM. THIS IS FOR THE WASHTENAW COUNTY PROGRAM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, THAT BOTH TERESA AND I TALKED ABOUT, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT 63% OF THE APPLICATIONS ACTUALLY CAME FROM ANN ARBOR, SMALL BUSINESSES. AND 3% FROM YPSILANTI AND SCATTERED AMONG THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE COUNTY. NEXT SLIDE, TOM. AND THIS WAS -- AS I SAID THIS WAS SORT OF THE FIRST WAVE OF THIS, AND MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES, OTHER KINDS OF LARGER SCALE TYPES OF BUSINESSES KNEW THEY COULD GET MORE MONEY FROM THE PPE PROGRAM AND QUALIFIED. SO THEY WENT TO THE BANKS BUT WE RECEIVED IS 100% OF THE PEOPLE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSIST SO FAR, WE HAVE SOME MORE TO GO AS TERESA SAID ARE IN THE PERSONAL SERVICES CATEGORY. AND YOU CAN SEE, YOU KNOW, SORT OF THE BREAKOUT THERE OF THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT WERE SERVED. AND THEN IF YOU GO TO THE LAST SLIDE THAT I HAVE FOR YOU, BEFORE A SUMMARY, THE -- THE -- ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT THE RESTAURANTS, THE PERSONAL SERVICES, THE GYMS, THE REC CENTERS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE VITAL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITY, BUT THE TOTAL OF THOSE KIND OF BUSINESSES WITH 50 OR LESS EMPLOYEES, REPRESENT ABOUT 5% OF ALL THE BUSINESSES WITH 50 OR LESS EMPLOYEES. SO WHILE VERY IMPORTANT AND VISIBLE COMPONENT, THERE ARE -- THERE ARE MANY MORE BUSINESSES IN THOSE CATEGORIES AND WE SAW MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT CAME INTO US FROM THESE CATEGORIES. FINALLY, JUST ON WHAT WE'RE DOING AND I WILL CLOSE MYSELF OUT AND THEN I GUESS WE ARE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. GO TO THE LAST SLIDE. SO THIS IS WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON AND WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH YOU. OUR ROLE IS A BIT IN PRESERVATION. IT'S GOING TO BE RESTORING AND IT'S THEN GOING TO BE TRYING TO HELP COMPANIES GROW, COMING OUT OF THIS. SO WE AS TERESA SAID, WE ARE -- WE HAVE RESIDENT -- THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES PEOPLE CAN GO TO CONNECT TO FIND OUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT THIS, WHAT PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE TO ME. WE HAVE A PRETTY ROBUST WEBSITE ON THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. WE ARE CONTINUING WHEN ANYBODY CANS US, CAN YOU BE THE FIDUCIARY FOR SOME RESOURCES WOE WOULD LIKE TO GET INTO THE COMMUNITY, WE SAY ABSOLUTELY. THE TEAM AT SPARK HAS BEEN WORKING, DOING THAT. WE ARE ALL WORKING REMOTELY, BUT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AND GET THOSE RESOURCES OUT AS SOON AS THEY COME IN. AND JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU, THERE'S STILL HIRING GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ODD IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT WE ARE DESCRIBING, BUT OUR JOB BOARD RIGHT NOW HAS OVER 600 JOBS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO HIRE. SO, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP GOING IN TERMS OF THAT ACTIVITY. THERE'S STILL PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAD CAPITAL, WHO WERE GOING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS ARE STILL -- SOME OF THEM ARE STILL GOING FORWARD WITH THE PROJECTS AND YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR QUITE IS THE VOLKER CHEMICAL RESEARCH FACILITY AND THAT PROJECT IS STILL IF PLACE. KLA IS STILL BUILDING THEIR BUILDING AND THERE ARE THINGS LIKE THAT. WE ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON, YOU KNOW, WHAT WILL COME OUT OF THIS? AS WE ALL LIVE A DIFFERENT WAY AND COMPANIES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, SO THINKING ABOUT -- THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A MAJOR SUPPLY CHAIN, POTENTIAL RESET, WHERE WE MAY SEE OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTRACT COMPANIES TO PUT FACILITIES HERE AND BRING JOBS HERE, WHERE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN FAR AWAY, AND HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME GREAT DISLOCATION. WE THINK WE NEED TO GET OUR HANDLE AROUND WHAT THE CHANGES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE WORKING A LOT OF US ARE DOING AT HOME, AND WHAT THAT MAY MEAN FOR THE FUTURE FOR REAL ESTATE, FOR OFFICES, FOR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE -- VERY COMPETITIVE IN THAT WORLD, WHERE MORE WORK IS DONE AT HOME, AND PEOPLE HAVE CHOICES ABOUT WHERE THEY CAN LIVE. THE BUSINESS EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE WELL DESCRIBED. WE DESCRIBED THAT. AND JUST AT THE END, WE ARE VERY WELL KNOWN FOR OUR WORK WITH START-UPS. WE ARE -- START-UPS ARE NERVOUS BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS NERVOUS AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ABOUT HOW THEY CAN PRESERVE THEIR CAPITAL AND EXTEND THEIR LIFE AND GET THROUGH THIS TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN CONTINUE IN THEIR GROWTH PATTERN. SO THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS, AS MY COLLEAGUES SAID, YOU KNOW, TO THE DEGREE -- IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, WE HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF YOUR TIME. YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THAT YOU LIKE TO SHOOT OUR WAY, JUST PLEASE DO SO. AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO RESPOND. SO THANKS A LOT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
01:16:57.193: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. WELL, ALL, I AND I'M SURE I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US, ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PRESENTATION FOR LETTING, YOU KNOW, US AND THE COMMUNITY KNOW OF ALL THE ACTIVITIES, ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES, ALL THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, OF COURSE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THANK FOR THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFFS ARE DOING. THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE ALL -- WE ALL NEED TO BAND TOGETHER. WE ALL NEED TO DEPLOY WHAT RESOURCES WE CAN IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE GOOD OF THOSE -- FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF US, FRANKLY, AND SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU -- HAVE YOU WORKING WITH US. SO THANK YOU. IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBERS OR SUCH, PLEASE PROBABLY CHANNEL THEM THROUGH TOM, WOULD WILL GET THEM OUT TO THE TEAM. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. WE THOUSAND COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST.

OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS RALPH McGEE.
01:19:20.302: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, IT LOOKS LIKE RALPH HAS NOT JOINED US YET BUT THE SECOND SPEAKER IS HERE.
01:19:24.206: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JAN WRIGHT.
01:19:31.247: >> OKAY. SO YOU KNOW THAT I'M JAN WRIGHT. I'M ACTUALLY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF INTERFAITH COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE. I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUCH CHALLENGING TIMES AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE WOULD JUST MADE THE PRESENTATIONS ON COVID-19. I WAS AWARE OF SOME OF THAT, BUT MOST OF IT, I WAS NOT AWARE OF. IT'S WONDERFUL THAT THAT'S ALL GOING ON AND IT'S TERRIBLE HOW MUCH NEED IS NOT BEING MET. WHICH I'M ALSO AWARE OF. AGAIN, I NOW HAVE MORE INFORMATION. SO THE INTERFAITH COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE, STRONGLY BACKS THE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THE 2021 BUDGET REQUEST FOR PLAN IMPLEMENTATION. AS AN A20 PARTNER, WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN GIVING INPUT FROM THE BEGINNING AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE PLAN HAS INCLUDED INPUT FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND EXPERTS AND THE EXPERTS ARE ALSO MOSTLY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE KNOW THAT COUNCIL WILL BE WEIGHING SERIOUSLY, THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING, THE KNOWN EFFECTS AND THE AS OF YET UNKNOWN EFFECTS AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO DOING YOUR JOB RESPONSIBLY, AND WE APPRECIATE IT GREATLY. WE URGE YOU TO TREAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITH EQUAL URGENCY, EVEN WHILE YOU ARE DOING WITH THE PANDEMIC, AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING ASK. EVEN MORE THAN THE PANDEMIC, HOWEVER, THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS CREEPING UP ON US SLOWLY BUT WILL EVENTUALLY UNLEASH PROBLEMS FAR MORE SEVERE AND PAINFUL THAN THOSE CAUSED BY THE VIRUS. BOTH THE VIRUS AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS CALLS US TO RETHINK OUR PRIORITIES. THIS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE COMFORTABLE AND IT WILL ASK YOU TO TAKE LEADERSHIP FAR BEYOND WHAT YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT YOU WERE SIGNING UP FOR. EACH OF THESE CRISES GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS TRULY ESSENTIAL TO A HEALTHY, VIBRANT AND JUST COMMUNITY, A COMMUNITY THAT LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND. AS AN ORGANIZATION, INTERFAITH COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE BRINGS TOGETHER PEOPLE OF FAITH AND PEOPLE OF CONSCIENCE, TO WORK AGAINST SYSTEMIC VIOLENCE AND TO HELP CREATE A COMMUNITY IN WHICH COMPASSION AND RESPECT CREATE SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE KNOW THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE PLAN DEPENDS ON ALL OF US, NOT JUST ON COUNCIL, AND WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO DO OUR PART. BUT THIS FIRST AND MAJOR STEP DEPENDS ON YOU. WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO ADOPT THE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS REQUESTED FOR THE 2021 BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:22:26.989: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND THAT MR. McGEE HAS COME ON AND OFF THE QUEUE. IF YOU ARE LISTENING, PLEASE CALL IN AND WE WILL BE SURE TO, WOULD YOU IN. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRIS OLSON.
01:22:43.839: >> HELLO? HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:22:45.541: >> ABSOLUTEY THERE. ABSOLUTELY.ABSOLUTELY.
01:22:51.113: >> I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE PLANET REALITY PROJECT, WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO CATTALLIZING A GLOBAL SOLUTION TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS BY MAKING URGENT ACTION AND NECESSITY ACROSS EVERY LEVEL AND WASHTENAW COUNTY CLIMATE REALITY IS THE LOCAL CHAPTER WITH EVERY150 MEMBER -- WITH OVER 150 MEMBERS WE STRONGLY ENDORSE THE CLIMATE NEUTRALITY PLAN, AND THE 2021 BUDGET REQUESTED FOR PLAN IMPLEMENTATION. CLIMATE REALITY HAS BEEN A PARTNER WITH A20 AND WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN GETTING INPUT FROM THE BEGINNING AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE INPUT FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND EXPERTS. AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ADDRESSING THE CORONAVIRUS CLIMATE, AND WE URGE YOU TO TREAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITH CORONAVIRUS. IT'S ANOTHER HARD TO FATHOM THREAT THAT WILL WREAK WORSE HAVOC THAN THIS ONE IF WE DON'T ACT NOW. WE ARE CALLED TO RETHINK OUR PRIORITIES AND THIS WILL BE HARD AS DESCRIBED LAST MEETING'S PRESENTATION, BUT IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LIKE ANN ARBOR IN THE ABSENCE EVER FEDERAL ACTION TO TAKE LEADERSHIP. EACH OF THESE CRISES GIVE US THE OPTION TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS TRULY ESSENTIAL TO HAVE THE HEALTHY, VIBRANT AND JUST COMMUNITY. IT'S ALREADY BEEN A MODEL TO THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT MEANS BIG INVESTMENTS NOW, IT'S TRUE BUT IT WILL PUT OUR CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS AND BUSINESSES AHEAD OF THE TRANSITION THAT WE WILL BE MAKING TO A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. SOLAR AND WIND ARE BECOMING CHEAPER THAN FOSSIL FUEL. A 10 SECOND GOOGLE SEARCH FOUND THIS ARTICLE ABOUT THREE CITIES FROM 2015 THAT WENT 100% RENEWABLE AND SAVING MONEY AND THAT LINK IS IN A LETTER THAT I ALSO EMAILED YOU ALL IN SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. WE KNOW THAT THE SUCCESS OF THIS PLAN DEPENDS ON ALL OF US, BUT NOT JUST THE COUNCIL. THE FIRST MAJOR STEP DEPENDS ON YOU. WE STRONGLY URGE TO ADOPT THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. THANK YOU.
01:25:03.045: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS EVAN REDMONT.
01:25:16.625: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS EVAN REDMONT I LIVE ON WHITEWOOD STREET IN WARD 3 AND I URGE YOU TO PASS CA-10. I REVIEWED THE NOVEMB NOVEMBER 4th MEETING IN WHICH THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY WAS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED. CORRESPONDING TO THE RESOLUTION WHERE ACKERMAN, GRAND, RAMLAWI, GRISWOLD, NELSON, AND NOT ONLY WAS COUNCILMEMBER EATON ADDED AS A COSPONSOR BUT ALSO PROPOSED THE AMENDMENT THAT MOVED THE DEADLINE FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY FROM 2035 TO 2030. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID, QUOTE, IF WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS SERIOUS, THERE'S NO WIGGLE ROOM AND THE STAKES ARE HIGH. ALSO ALL YOU HAVE GOT IS YOUR WORD IN THIS LIFE. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, CALLED FOR, QUOTE, ROBUST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, END QUOTE AND THE NEED TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE. THE A20 DRAFT HAS RECEIVED MASSIVE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND CALLS FOR INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID, I HOPE THIS EMERGENCY DECLARATION REALLY MEANS SOMETHING AND I'M NOT ONE TO S SHY AWAY FROM RADIL NOTIONS. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH SAYS, "YOU IN REFERENCE TO THE PUBLIC HAVE TO PUSH US TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS. WE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, END QUOTE. AND THAT IS WHAT WE PLAN TO DO THIS EVENING. THE A20 DRAFT IS NOT PERFECT. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A PUBLICLY OWNED ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, INSTEAD OF RELYING ON FOR-PROFIT COMPANIES. ADDITIONALLY, I THINK THIS SHOULD BE AN AMENDMENT TO STOP THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. IT IS CLEARLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT AND I WORRY THAT THAT WE USE THE TERM "EXISTENTIAL THREAT" TOO MUCH THAT. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE I KNOW ARE PLANNING NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMACIMPACT. OUR OLD WAY OF LIFE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH SAVING THE PLANET AND THAT IS THE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL BE OUR LAST SHOT TO CURB THE WORST EFFECTS OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE, AND NOW WILL BE THE TIME THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER. WE WILL KNOW IF THEIR COVERING BODY HAS ENCOURAGED TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OR IF THEY ARE POLITICIANS THAT MAKES SWEEPING DECREES WHENEVER IT'S ADVAN ADVN STAGOUS.
01:28:02.057: >> FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR COUNTRY, PLEASE APPROVE CA-10. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:28:08.864: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. MR. McGEE, I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE WITH US NOW. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS RALPH McGEE.
01:28:22.411: >> HI, I WOULD ASK YOU TO -- MY NAME IS RALPH McGEE, I WOULD ASK YOU TO POSTPONE OR VOTE AGAINST THE CA-10, THE A20 PLAN, AND SEND IT BACK TO STAFF WITH SPECIFIC DIRECTION TO FOCUS ON COST EFFECTIVE ACTION THAT THE CITY CAN ACTUALLY DO. I'M DEFINITELY IN FAVOR OF FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THE REPORT HAS A MAJOR FLAW AND THE TIMING IS BAD. FIRST IT MAKES NO SENSE TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC FINANCIAL SITUATION AND THE INSTABILITY IT WILL BRING. IN ADDITION TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR BROUGHT EARLIER TONIGHT, PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY -- NOT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PAY ALL OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES. SO I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM JUST KEE KEEPING THE EMPLOYEES HAVE YOU NOW. SECOND SEVERAL OF THE ACTION ITEMS REQUIRES SERIOUS COOPERATION. STATE LEGISLATURE, DTE, REGIONAL TRANSIT OR THE UNIVERSITY, NONE OF WHICH HAVE SHOWN MUCH PROPENNITY ON THE SERIOUS LEVEL THAT THESE ITEMS REQUIRE. THIRD, THE PLAN HAS NO COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AT ALL. TAKE FOUR ITEMS IN THE REPORT, ELECTRIC BUSES AND ELECTRIC CITY CARS, PARK AND RIDE LOTS AND COMMERCIAL RECYCLING. TOTAL COST, $272 MILLION IS MORE THAN 25% OF THE TOTAL COST CONTEMPLATED. THAT WOULD BUY YOU A 2.3 REDUCTION IN OUR EMISSIONS. THAT'S 118 MILLION FOR PERCENTAGE. 11.8 MILLION FOR A TENTH OF A PERCENT AND $1.8 MILLION FOR EACH HUNDREDTH OF A PERCENT. THAT'S $1 MILLION FOR 100th OF A PERCENT. .001. FROM A COST BENEFIT STANDPOINT, THAT'S AWFUL. THINK OF ALL THE -- THINK HOW MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU COULD BUILD FOR THAT OR HOW MANY DOSOLAR PANELS YOU COULD PUT UP FOR $270 MILLION. I SAW AN MLIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO OBTAIN LOW INTEREST LOANS TO PAY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCIES AND SO ON. HOW ABOUT ALLOCATING SOME OF THAT $272 MILLION TO PAY FOR THAT. AND FINALLY, PLEASE DON'T CHARACTERIZE THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE ADOPTION OF THIS REPORT WHETHER ON COUNCIL OR REGULAR FOLKS AS NOT CARING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. WE DO CARE A LOT. BUT LET'S WORK ON THIS IN A WAY THAT MAKES FISCAL SENSE. THANK YOU.
01:30:50.792: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KEN GARBER.
01:30:59.968: >> YES THIS IS KEN GARBER, 28 HAVERHILL COURT. THANK YOU, VE EVERYONE, FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY IN THESE HARD TIMES ON A20, MR. McGEE MISREAD THE PLAN WITH THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT. HE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE WE ARE GETTING NEXT TO NOTHING FOR OUR MONEY. IT'S AN EASY ERROR TO MAKE. HE TALKS ABOUT $227 MILLION FOR JUST 2.3%, EMISSIONS REDUCTION. HE CITES FOUR DIFFERENT AREAS. WELL, THE ELECTRIC BUSES, YES, THE COST OF ELECTRIC BUSES IS HIGH PER VOLUME OF EMISSIONS SAVED BUT WE HAVE TO BUY BUSES ANYWAY. SO THE INCREMENTAL COST IS MUCH, MUCH LOWER. THE SAME THING FOR THE CITY EV FLEET. WE NEED VEHICLES REGARDLESS. SO LET'S MAKE THEM ELECTRIC. EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM COMMERCIAL RECYCLING ARE NOT COUNTED BY THE PLAN FORMALLY BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN OUTSIDE THE CITY. SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE NOT GETTING MUCH FOR OUR MONEY, BUT THE ATMOSPHERE IS BENEFITING. AND WE NEED PARK AND RIDE LOTS TO CONNECT TO TRANSIT. AND FOR EASY CHARGING WITHOUT THEM, TRANSIT DOESN'T WORK. SO THE IMPACT IS HUGE. BUT IT DOESN'T SHOW UP IN THE EMISSIONS FIGURES. CARBON NEUTRALITY IS REALLY VERY SIMPLE. SWAP OUT ALL GAS FURNACES AND GET THEM OUT OF CARS OR INTO BUSES MAKE OUR OWN CLEAN ELECTRICITY SOLAR ENERGY AND BY THE REST TO THE UTILITY WHO CAN SELL US THEIR CLEAN ELECTRICITY, AS OPPOSED TO DTE, FOR SEVERAL DECADES LEASED. AND THE PLAN DOES NOT PRESUPPOSE COORDINATION WITH DTE ONCE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATE IS ACHIEVED. THOSE ARE THE MAIN ELEMENTS. WE SHOULD HAVE BEGUN 30 YEARS AGO. WHEN WE COULD HAVE MADE A GRADUAL TRANSITION. INSTEAD, WE BURNED FOSSIL FUELS LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW AND THAT INCLUDES ME. NOW WE ARE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE TO CUT EMISSIONS ALL AT ONCE. THE A20 CHECKS ALL THE BOXES. I DON'T AGREE WITH ANYTHING AND IT MIRRORS SCRUTINY LIKE ANY PROPOSAL. MAKE CHANGES IF YOU MUST, BUT DO NOT WEAK TEN. A WEAK PLAN IS WORSE THAN NO PLAN AT ALL BECAUSE IT GIVES A FALSE SENSE THAT YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING. WE ARE TRULY IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. OUR GLOBAL CARBON BUDGET IS ALMOST GONE. WE ARE LOOKING AT DISASTER AND IRREVERSIBLE TIPPING POINTS.
01:33:38.093: >> 30 SECONDS.
01:33:39.127: >> WE HAVE STOLEN FUTURE FROM OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. DON'T TAKE THE ANNIHILALISTIC POSITION THAT SINCE THE PROBLEM IS SO BIG, WHAT WE DO IN LITTLE ANN ARBOR DOESN'T MATTER. WITH OUR HUGE PER CAPITA EMISSIONS, YOU AND I ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS. AND THE CORONAVIRUS JO UTILITY OUTBREA SHOWS NOT ONLY DOES EVERY CITY MATTER, BUT EVERY HOUSEHOLD MATTERS. PASS THE A20 PLAN AND LET'S GET TO WORK ON THIS THANK YOU.
01:34:10.759: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JIMMY RODGERS. MR. RODGERS, YOU MIGHT BE ON MUTE.
01:34:31.947: >> Clerk Beaudry: HERE SHE COMES.
01:34:33.682: >> MY NAME IS GINNY ROGERS, A WARD 4 RESIDENT AND A VOLUNTEER WITH THE CITIZEN CLIMATE LOBBY. OUR ORGANIZATION AND WE HAVE ENDORSED THE A20 CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. LAST NOVEMBER, YOU UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A BOLD RESOLUTION DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY, AND SETTING AN EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY THE YAO ERR 2030. IN FACT, YOU EVEN AMENDED THE RESOLUTION TO SET AN EARLIER TARGET DATE. I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT ACTION. CITY STAFF ALONG WITH MULTIPLE EXPERT ADVISORS WORKED EXTRAORDINARILY HARD OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. AND TONIGHT, YOU WILL VOTE ON WHETHER TO ADOPT THE PLAN. I'M ASKING YOU TO PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMITMENTS AND ADOPT THIS PLAN. PASSING THE RESOLUTION IN NOVEMBER WAS RELATIVELY EASY, BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING A BOLD PROMISE IF YOU ARE UNWILLING TO DO THE DIFFICULT WORK THAT IS REQUIRED OF YOUR GOAL? YES, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO TRANSITION OUR COMMUNITY OFF OF FOSSIL FUELS. BUT WE MUST COMPARE THAT WITH THE COSTS OF FAILING TO ACT. AND THE LONGER WE DELAY, THE MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE EXPENSIVE IT WILL BE TO WEAN OURSELVES OFF OF FOSSIL FUELS. I THINK THERE ARE MANY COMPARISONS THAT CAN BE DRAWN BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THEY BOTH DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING GUIDED BY SCIENCE, OF THE NEED TO ACT BEFORE THINGS GET BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO INTERVENE, AND THEY BOTH ILLUSTRATE THE INEQUALITIES IN OUR SOCIETY AND DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. CORONAVIRUS IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT GOING AWAY, AND WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY TO IGNORE IT. SO I WILL URGE YOU TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AND COMMIT TO THE HARD BUT NECESSARY WORK. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT I'M ALSO FULLY IN SUPPORT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT, AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS ANOTHER LOCK, NEGLECTED ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE KEN  DESPERATELY NEED MOE HOUSING RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:37:06.701: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JAN FOGEL.
01:37:15.076: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE JAN VOGEL BUT I HAVE THE NEXT THREE SPEAKERS.
01:37:22.350: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MIKE SCHERRBERG.
01:37:26.888: >> HELLO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND FOR THE STEPS THAT YOU ARE TAKING TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE AND COMPASSIONATE DURING THIS TROUBLING TIME. MY NAME IS MIKE SCHERRBERG. I HAVE BEEN ON THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. I TEACH ENERGY AND CLIMATE AT U OF M AND I'M THE GREAT LAKES REGIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE NAT NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERN WHICH EMPLOYS ABOUT 25 PEOPLE DOWNTOWN WOULD WORK ON CLIMATE RESILIENCY HERE AND AROUND THE REGION. I URGE YOU TO FULLY SUPPORT ANN ARBOR'S CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN. WE NEED TO FLATTEN THE CURVE OF COURTCLIMATE CHANGE AND COVID-1. CITY COUNCIL HAS ASKED THE IMPOSSIBLE OF CITY STAFF AND RESIDENTS BEGINNING WITH THE ORIGINAL PLAN, A LITTLE BIT BIASED SINCE I WAS ON THE TEAM THAT HELPED TO DRAFT IT BUT IT WAS NOT FOCUSED ON TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE UNTIL RECENTLY. OVER TIME, THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR WENT TO THE FRONT OF PACK TO PERHAPS THE MIDDLE, NOT BECAUSE OF LACK OF INTEREST FROM CITIZENS. THIS REMAINS A VERY HIGH CONCERN ON EVERY REASONABLY DESIGNED SURFACE AND FOCUS GROUP BUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INVESTMENT AND FOCUS. FORTUNATELY, WE NOW HAVE VERY STRONG LEADERSHIP AT THE STAFF LEVEL AND THEY HAVE PERFORMED THE IMPOSSIBLE. YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU AN AMBITIOUS YET ACHIEVABLE PLAN FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY. A PLAN DONE REMARKABLY QUICKLY YET WITH UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT EVEN IN THE FACE OF CURRENT P PANDEMIC. THIS WOULD CHANGE THE PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF ANN ARBOR IN POSITIVE WAYS AND LINK UP THE HOUSING CRISIS, SOCIAL JUSTICE AND CLIMATE ACTION IN A WAY THAT RESTORES ANN ARBOR TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE LEADING THE PACK. EVERY ONE OF US COULD PICK OUT A FEW DETAILS OF THIS PLAN, AND PROBABLY TAKE ISSUE WITH THEM. AND WE SURELY CAN'T DO EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF IT, AS SPECIFIC -- SPECIFICALLY AS OUTLINED, BUT YOU, SOME MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL, YOU CAN SET GOAL POSTS THAT SEEM TO CONSTANTLY MOVE BACKWARDS AS THE CLIMATE CRISIS HAS WORSENED. BEFORE THIS, NO PLAN SEEMS GOOD ENOUGH, BUT RECENTLY DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY, THE COUNCIL ASKED FOR A RESPONSE AND WE SET SOME CLEAR GOAL POSTS WITHIN SITE. IT HAS THE VISION AND THE PLAN IS READY FOR ACTION. IT WILL TAKE US SOME POLITICAL COURAGE, SOME LEADERSHIP, AND BACKING UP TO CLEARLY EXPRESS THE COMMUNITY VALUE OF CARBON NEUTRALITY AND CLIMATE JUSTICE WITH THE SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL CAPITAL TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THE PLAN IS READY, AND THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE IS CLEAR.
01:39:57.272: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:39:58.406: >> THE QUESTION IS IF THIS COUNCIL IS READY TO PULL TOGETHER AND TRULY MAKE ITS MARK ON THE CITY'S HISTORY BY FLATTENING THE GREEN HOUSE GAS CURVE. IT'S TIME TO ACT. THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION AND ME PERSONALLY AS A CITIZEN AND IT'S AN ENERGY COMMISSION MEMBER STRONGLY URGE YOU TO DON'T THE PLAN. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU ARE DOING FOR THE CITY.
01:40:17.659: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE HAVE ONE UNKNOWN NUMBER, 248 NUMBER, MS. VOGEL IF THAT'S YOUR NUMBER, PLEASE HIT STAR NINE AND MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN.
01:40:30.038: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THAT CALLER HAS THE HAND UP, BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHO IT IS. DO YOU WANT TO TRY OR DO YOU WANT TO MOVE ON TO THE OTHER RESERVED CALLS?
01:40:39.614: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN YOU CHECK THAT OFFLINE?
01:40:41.215: >> Clerk Beaudry: I CANNOT.
01:40:43.518: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. LET'S ROLL WITH THAT ONE AND IF IT'S -- IF IT'S ONE OF OUR ALTERNATES, WE WILL ASK THEM TO WAIT UNTIL THE END.
01:40:53.161: >> Clerk Beaudry: OKAY. HI, THIS IS THIS JANE VOGEL? NO NO, I'M JUST ANOTHER PERSON ON THE LINE.
01:41:02.136: >> Clerk Beaudry: YOU ARE NOT ON THE RESERVE TIME. THANK YOU.
01:41:06.941: >> YEAH.
01:41:07.642: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS NAN PLUMBER.
01:41:13.081: >> MAYOR TAYLOR -- GOOD EVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR, CITY COUNCIL, I'M THE NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR DEDICATION DURING THIS TIME. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY. WE REQUEST THAT A PARTICULAR ITEM, CA-720, ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF 415 WEST WASHINGTON STREET BE REMOVED FROM TONIGHT'S AGENDA AND TABLED FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCUSSION AMONG COUNCIL, STAFF, THE CONSERVANCY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. WE WANT YOU TO KNOW RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN DOWNTOWN. QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTS IS AT THE HEART OF OUR VISION FOR THE TREELINE TRAIL AND A SAFE, HEALTHY, PLEASANT, STABLE PLACE FOR EVERY CITIZEN TO LIVE IS ESSENTIAL FOR QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL. OUR PROBLEM WITH THIS RESOLUTION, IS BASED ON ITS ADVANCING ONE PARTICULAR USE, FOR THE PARCEL AT 415, WITHOUT A PROCESS FOR EXPLORING OTHER OR ADDITIONAL USES FOR THE SITE, INCLUDING THE TREELINE AND OTHER AMENITIES RELATED TO IT. NOW, WE'RE GLAD TO SEE THAT THE RESOLUTION DOES INCORPORATE ALLOCATION OF AN APPROPRIATE PORTION OF THE SITE TO FUTURE OF TREELINE TRAIL USE WHILE SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT UNDER THIS RESOLUTION, THE SALE OF THIS PROPERTY IS ONE WAY THAT SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING COULD ALSO BE ACCOMPLISHED. SO WE ARE ASKING FOR MORE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE EXPLORATION OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND BEST FOR THIS SITE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CONSERVANCY AND THE CITY COUNCIL. THERE ARE INFORMATIVE BUT NARROWLY FOCUSED COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS CONDUCTED BY SMITH GROUP. THERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP BUT WE ARE CONCERNED WITHOUT A MORE INCLUSIVE ASSESSMENT, THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE FREELINE AND THE OTHER DESIRABLE USES COULD BE AUTOMATICALLY PRECLUDED. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THIS BE REMOVED FROM THIS EVENING'S CONSENT AGENDA THAT DETERMINATION IS A POTENTIAL USE OF 415 WEST WASHINGTON BE DECLAYED UNTIL THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER ALL THE ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THAT COULD BE SHARED WITH THE PROPOSED TREELINE TRAIL AND COUNCIL AND STAFF PROVIDE FOR THE COLLABORATIVE REVIEW FOR THE USE OF THE SITE.
01:43:52.006: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:43:53.007: >> THE NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. NORMAN HERBERT AND JOE NEIL JOINED ME IN DRAFTING THIS MESSAGE TO YOU. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION.
01:44:03.518: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS TOM STALBERG.
01:44:08.923: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:44:10.791: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:44:11.292: >> HELLO. THIS IS TOM STALBERG. I LIVE AT 1202 TRAVER STREET. IT'S BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE 415 WEST WASHINGTON SITE IS NOT WELL SUITED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CITY COUNCIL DIRECTED THE REVIEW OF ABOUT 10 CITY OWNED SITES FOR POSSIBLE USE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE STUDY TO FOR 415 WEST WASHINGTON BECAUSE THE FLOODWAY AND THE ROADWAY, THAT THIS SITE IS NOT A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PLEASE MOVE ON TO SITES THAT ARE FEASIBLE. THE Y LOT WAS IN THE SAME STUDY THAT SEEMS TO BE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED ON WHAT THE CITY SHOULD BE TO MOVING FORWARD ON TO GET THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BUILT DOWNTOWN. LET'S GET TO WORK ON THAT. THE IMMEDIATE THERE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS ACTION ON 415 WEST WASHINGTON AND NEVER GIVEN NOTICE. THE SMITH GROUP NOTICED THAT THEY DID NOT FOLLOW THE STANDARD NOTICE PRO HE TOE KOHL THAT THE CITY OR THE PRIVATE DEVELOPER WOULD HAVE HAD -- WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO DO. 415 WEST WASHINGTON IS LITERALLY IN THE BACKYARD OF A FRIEND OF MINE. SHE WAS UNAWARE OF THE SMITH GROUP STUDY AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANY OF THE MEETINGS. SHE ATTENDED THE FINAL MEETING AT THE DDA OFFICES ON FEBRUARY 25th, ONLY BECAUSE SHE LEARNED ABOUT IT FROM ME THE DAY BEFORE. AND OTHER NEIGHBORS IN THAT AREA REPORT THIS IS AS WELL. THEY SHOULD BE FURTHER ENGAGED BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE NEXT STEP. ADVANCING PREENTITLING NOW DOES NOT MAKE SENSE NOW. THE PURPOSE OF THE PREENTITLEMENT PROCESS IS TO CREATE A LEVEL OF CERTAINTY. WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS WITH OUR OWN PLAN AND GET THAT APPROVED AND THE CITY CAN MARKET THAT TO DEVELOPERS WHO CAN ARE E LIE ON BUILDING THAT PROJECT. -- RELY ON BUILDING THAT PROJECT. FROM THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION, WHICH MUST ALSO APPROVE IT, WON'T ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. THAT PREENTITLEMENT GOAL. ALSO PROCEEDING FROM THE SMITH GROUP'S PREFERRED OPTION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THE OPTION WAS CREATED FROM A PROCESS THAT WAS FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. THAT PURPOSE WAS TO EVALUATE THE SITE FOR THE FEE TO GO TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A PLAN THAT WE CAN TOWARDS ENTITLEMENT WITH YET. ALSO THE PLANNING COMMISSION JUST REVIEWED A PROPOSED FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY ORDINANCE. THE PRESENTATION WAS THOROUGH AND WELL RECEIVED AND QUESTIONS WERE ASKED OF STAFF AND STAFF WILL ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS POSSIBLY MAKING CHANGE TO THE NEW ORDINANCE AND THEN BRING IT BACK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:46:41.208: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:46:42.143: >> AND THEN BE ENGAGED AND COUNCIL WILL HAVE INPUT. THIS MAY VERY WELL CHANGE BEFORE ADOPTED IF EVEN ADOPTED. I HOPE THAT SOME VERSION WILL BE ADOPTED, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE AND WE WON'T KNOW THAT FOR A WHILE. THIS SITE WILL BE SUBJECT TO THAT ORDINANCE, SO WORKING ON A PLAN FOR THIS SITE, BEFORE THAT ORDINANCE IS CREATED IS PREMATURE. THANK YOU.
01:47:09.770: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, MS. VOGEL. IS JAN VOGEL ON THE LINE?
01:47:17.478: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DO NOT SEE HER NUMBER.
01:47:19.680: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
01:47:26.954: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I HAVE ONE UNIDENTIFIED 734 PHONE NUMBER. BUT IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE MS. SAVABIEASFAHANI OR MS. VOGEL. DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY IT?
01:47:39.834: >> Clerk Beaudry: IS IT PERHAPS
01:47:44.905: >> Mayor Taylor: IS IT PERHAPS MR. COLEMAN?
01:47:49.410: >> Clerk Beaudry: I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
01:47:51.946: >> Mayor Taylor: PEOPLE ARE OBLIGATED TO SIGN UP IN ADVANCE, LET'S SEE IF IT'S MR. SAVABIEASFAHANI OR MR. COLEMAN AND IF IT'S NOT, THEN WE MOVE ON.
01:48:02.323: >> MY NAME IS BLAINE COLEMAN AND BEFORE ME IS MOZHGAN AT THE 313 NUMBER.
01:48:11.265: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU FOR THAT. MS. BEAUDRY, CAN YOU GET THE 313 NUMBER?
01:48:19.707: >> Clerk Beaudry: YEP.
01:48:21.275: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:48:22.710: >> Clerk Beaudry: HI, IS THIS MOZHGAN.
01:48:24.445: >> YES, IT'S ME.
01:48:27.047: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU ARE ON FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEASE. PROCEED AT YOUR CONVENIENCE.
01:48:31.752: >> HI, I'M CALLING ABOUT DC-1, THE RESOLUTION TO PUSH THE GELMAN CONTAMINATION TO EPA. I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY ON THE COUNCIL ABOUT JANUAR JANUARY 16th, 2020, WHEN MS. JONES TANAKA TOLD YOU IF YOU DO QUALIFY FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST, WHICH YOU ARE NOT STILL ON IT, IF YOU DO ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR, I IT, IT L TAKE A VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GET TO CLEANUP. SHE ALSO TOLD YOU, WE ARE REALLY, REALLY SLOW. THAT IS THE EPA TELLING YOU. IT COULD TAKE UP TO  30 YEARS TO CLEAN IT UP. IF AS A CITY OF ANN ARBOR REPRESENTATIVE, CITY COUNCIL OF ANN ARBOR, CONTINUE TO PUSH AND CONTINUE TO TALK AND CONTINUE TO ACT AS THOUGH THE EPA IS AN OPTION, YOU ARE BETRAYING THE PUBLIC. THE PUBLIC WILL BE LEFT FOR ANOTHER 30 YEARS OF DIRTY D DIOXANE CONTAMINATED WATER. PLEASE, YOU CAN SEE WHAT CORONA CAN DO TO A POPULATION TO NOBODY THAT CARES ABOUT IT. YOU CAN SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN. PLEASE, YOU ARE ABANDONING THE PUBLIC. ACT NOW TO CLEAN IT YOU RIGHT AWAY. CLEAN IT UP NOW. PUT AN INITIATIVE TO THE PUBLIC, CLEAN IT UP NOW. SHOW RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PEOPLE IN IT. YOU CAN SEE WHAT DISRESPECT FOR THE AND THE PEOPLE CAN DO TO A POPULATION. LOOK AT THE 42,000 DEAD IN CHINA, ONLY 4,600 DIED AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS OF THIS. LOOK. THIS IS A SOCIETY THAT NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF ITS PEOPLE INSTEAD OF PUTTING MONEY BEFORE EVERYTHING. CLEAN UP THE GELMAN CONTAMINATION. CLEAN IT UP! IT IS ABOMINABLE THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN CLEANED UP IN 50 YEARS. IT IS A SHAME TO OUR RECORD, TO YOUR RECORD, THAT IT STILL GOES ON. I AM SICKENED TO SEE HOW SLOW AND HOW TOTALLY USELESS YOUR BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ARE TAKING THIS TIME. I AM SICK OF IT. MANY, MANY PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS BEHAVIOR. KEEP PUSHING IT FOR EPA. YOU KNOW THE EPA HAS TOLD YOU WE WON'T DO IT. HOW MUCH CLEARER DO YOU WANT THE EPA TO BE? IT'S RIDICULOUS. IT'S RIDICULOUS! WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE FOR YOURSELF.
01:51:00.534: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:51:01.602: >> DO YOU SEE HOW ANGRY I AM? PEOPLE IN ANN ARBOR ARE TWICE AS ANGRY. (INAUDIBLE).
01:51:36.103: >> Mayor Taylor: DID WE HAVE A LOSS OF SIGNAL?
01:51:39.039: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:51:40.140: >> Clerk Beaudry: THAT'S THE TIME.
01:51:41.375: >> Mayor Taylor: OTHER COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:51:48.148: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE MAYOR'S STATEMENTS ABOUT OUR RECENTLY PASSED COLLEAGUE, GRAYDON KRAPOHL. I SERVED WITH GRAYDON FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. I WAS SAD TO SEE SOMEONE SO YOUNG PASS WHILE HE WAS STILL SO FULL OF LIFE. I FOUND HIM TO BE A TRUE GENTLEMAN, WHO HAD A SUBTLE SENSE OF HUMOR. HE DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO PUBLIC SERVICE, INCLUDING THE MILITARY AND PUBLIC OFFICE. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SERVE WITH HIM. HE WAS A BRAVE MAN WOULD FOUGHT A TERRIBLE DISEASE, WITH DIGNITY AND GRACE. MY SYMPATHIES GO OUT TO HIS DAUGHTER AND TO HIS WIFE AND I THINK THAT WE ALL SHARE THE GRIEF OF THE LOSS OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE. THANK YOU.
01:52:37.865: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:52:41.101: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. TURNING ATTENTION TO CITY BUSINESS, AS TH SPRING IS COMINA LOT OF RESIDENTS FIND THEMSELVES WITH EXTRA YARD WASTE AND I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT STARTING TOMORROW, APRIL 21st, ON MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, 8 A.M. TO 4 P.M., RESIDENTS CAN DROP OFFER BAGS OF YARD WASTE AT THE CITY'S PUBLIC WORKS FACILITY AT 4170 PLAT ROAD AND THERE YOU WILL SEE DUMPSTERRED DESIGNATED FOR YARD WASTE DUMP OFF. THANK YOU FOR THE RESIDENT OF THE THIRD WARD FOR THIS IDEA AND THANKS TO THE PUBLIC WORKS STAFF FOR MAKING IT HAPPEN.
01:53:29.283: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:53:30.350: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. I JUST WANTED TO ADD ON TO TOM CRAWFORD'S ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE CITY'S EARTH DAY FESTIVITIES THIS WEEKEND AND PARTICULARLY ON WEDNESDAY. ALLEN HABER IS ALSO HOSTING A VIRTUAL EARTH DAY CELEBRATION AND IT'S A COMPLICATED ZOOM LINK. SO IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN JOINING AT NOON ON WEDNESDAY, THE ALLEN HABER'S CENTER OF THE CITY EARTH DAY AND RELATED MUSIC, AND GUEST SPEAKERS, FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AND I WILL FORWARD THE LINK DIRECTLY, THE ZOOM LINK. THANK YOU.
01:54:15.229: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:54:16.063: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. FIRST, JUST SOME QUICK CITY-RELATED BUSINESS. IN YOUR PACKET THIS EVENING, UNDER F-3, THERE'S AN ANNUAL REPORT WHICH IS REQUIRED FROM THE STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCIL, WHICH I'M LIAISON TO, THAT HIGHLIGHTS A LINE REALLY WELL WITH OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING, FOCUSING ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CLIMATE ACTION. THEY ALSO PLAN ESPECIALLY WITH THE ADDITION OF A NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL MEMBERS THIS YEAR TO PUSH TO HAVE MORE YOUTH VOICES ON OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THOSE EFFORTS. I DID WANT TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ALONG WITH SOME OTHERS ABOUT THE LOSS OF -- FOR SOME OF US, OUR FRIEND, GRAYDON KRAPOHL. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING WITH HIM BOTH ON THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION AND ON COUNCIL. SO WHEN WE JOINED TOGETHER AT ORIENTATION, YOU KNOW, WE WERE ALREADY PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH ONE ANOTHER, BUT I REALLY TREASURE OR TIME ON COUNCIL TOGETHER, BECAUSE IT ENABLED ME TO GET TO KNOW HIM BETTER MORE AND THERE'S SO MANY THINGS YOU COULD SAY ABOUT THE LOVE OF HIS FAMILY AND HIS COUNTRY. ONE OF HIS NEIGHBORS TOLD ME THAT THERE WASN'T A MESSAGE THAT WENT OUT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEGOTIATION INITIALLY ABOUT HIS DEATH BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE WHO DID THAT FOR HIS NEIGHBORS. THE ATTENTION THAT HE BROUGHT TO VETERANS, EVEN AFTER HIS TIME ON COUNCIL. BUT I DO WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO A FEW THINGS ABOUT HIS TIME ON COUNCIL AND WHAT I TAKE AWAY FROM HIS SERVICE AND OUR WORK TOGETHER. GRAYDON'S DESIRE TO SERVE ON COUNCIL WAS REALLY BORNE OUT OF SOME LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM MINE AND, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW IT, EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY, HE WOULD SAY THINGS -- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR KIDS IN SPORTS. YEAH, MY DAUGHTER HURT HER FOOT. IT REMINDED ME WHEN I TREKKED THROUGH SNOW FOR SIX WEEKS WITH A SPOKEN FOOT AND YOU REALIZED THAT HIS EXPERIENCES WERE DIFFERENT, HE WOULDN'T SPEAK THAT AT THE COUNCIL NEIGHBOR, RIGHT? THERE WAS NO EGO THERE AND SO MANY OF HIS CONTRIBUTIONS WERE THINGS COMPLETED BEHIND THE SCENE AND IF NO ONE ACTUALLY BOTHERED TO RECOGNIZE THEM ON COUNCIL, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT HE WAS WORKING FROM A REALLY DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF LEADERSHIP AND MAKING SURE IT BENEFITED US ALL. HE ALWAYS CAME TO MEETING HAVING DONE HIS HOMEWORK BEING PREPARED, BUT DIDN'T NECESSARILY SPEAK. HE ONLY SPOKE IF HE HAD SOMETHING TO ADD. AND I THINK THAT MADE US LISTEN MORE WHEN HE SP SPOKE. HE BELIEVED IN THE SACRIFICES THAT HE AND OTHERS SACRIFICED FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. AND THE LAST THING I TOOK FROM HIM WAS THAT HE WAS ALWAYS VERY FORWARD LOOKING IN HIS VISION FOR THE CITY. HE WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO NOT ONLY SERVE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE TODAY, BUT ALSO WHAT THE -- THE DECISIONS WE MAKE HAVING IMPLICATIONS, 10, 20, 30 MORE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. SO I CERTAINLY CONTINUE DURING THESE TIMES TO TAKE THOSE LESSONS FROM HIM. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF OUTPOURING FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE DESIRE TO MEMORIALIZE HIM. WE WILL CERTAINLY BE WORKING TOWARDS THAT EVENTUALLY AND MORE PUBLICLY HONOR HIS MEMORY, ONCE THE TIME IS RIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY WITH A LOT OF INPUT FROM HIS FAMILY. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HIS FAMILY BEING I'M SURE WITH HIS INPUT REQUESTED THAT ANY MEMORIAL CONTRIBUTIONS BE MADE IN HIS NAME TO FISHER HOUSE WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT HE FELT A DEEP CONNECTION TO BECAUSE OF THEIR SERVICE FOR VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO DONATE NOW IN HIS NAME, THAT'S -- THAT WOULD REALLY SUPPORT HIS WISHES.
01:58:47.434: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:58:48.335: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES. I DIDN'T GET TO SERVE WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAYDON, BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT WHERE THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS COULD BE SENT TO AND I JUST WANTED TO GIVE MY CONDOLENCES TO HIS FAMILY, GRETA AND GRACE:  SUCH A YOUNG AGE TO LOSE YOUR FATHER. THAT JUST REALLY TEARS YOUR HEART. BUT I WALKED BY THE FISHER HOUSE YESTERDAY AND IT'S ALMOST CONSTRUCTED OVER THERE ON FLORA COURT. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE A GREAT ASSET AND A HUGE BENEFIT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO USE THAT. SO ON TO SOME CITY MATTERS. I HAVE JUST WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, APPLAUD OUR COMMUNITY WITH OBEYING THE SOCIAL DISTANCING. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE NUMBERS FLATTEN, FINALLY, THANKFULLY. AND FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE REACHED OUT TO US WITH CONCERNS ABOUT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY STILL CONGREGATING, NOT PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING, I HAD A MEETING WITH OUR POLICE CHIEF LAST WEEK, OUR MONTHLY WARD MEETING, AND WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION. WE TALKED FOR WELL OVER AN HOUR, AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE THEY WANT US TO SEND PEOPLE, TO CALL 911 IF THERE ARE ISSUES WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO JUST CALL 911. SO CONTINUE TO PLEASE DO THAT. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE THERE FOR. IF YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT NEEDS ATTENTION. AND WHILE WE ARE ON THIS TOPIC RIGHT NOW, I JUST --  A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT COMMENT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR FINANCES WITH A LOOMING RECESSION, WHO KNOWS HOW DEEP AND HOW LONG THAT WILL GO. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A DEBATE LOCALLY ABOUT HOW WE FUND OUR CITY OPERATIONS, WHETHER IT SHOULD BE A CITY INCOME TAX OR PROPERTY TAXES AND I'M JUST GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE OUR PROPERTY TAXES AS A WAY TO FUND OUR CITY OPERATIONS. I THINK IT WOULD BE A LOT HARDER TO TALK ABOUT NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET IF WE WERE FUNDED WITH A CITY INCOME TAX. I'M THANKFUL RIGHT NOW, THAT'S NOT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE TO FACE WITH THE TYPE OF TAX SYSTEM WE HAVE. ALSO I WANTED TO THANK, YOU KNOW, THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, FOR WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THAT WAS REALLY A GREAT PRESENTATION WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY. THERE'S BEEN MANY MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY ASKING US WHAT'S BEING DONE AND IT'S GREAT AND WE ARE HEARING THAT THE COUNTY IS STEPPING UP AND DOING SOME GREAT THINGS, FOOD GATHERS IS DOING SOME WONDERFUL THINGS, THE UNITED WAY IS STEPPING UP IN A BIG WAY AND ALSO SPARK. AND SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE OUR ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS COMMUNITY STEPPING IN AND FILLING IN THE GAP. SPARK HAS HELPED TO COMMUNITY% ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE HELPING FEED THE WORKERS AT THE HOSPITALS AND HELPING LOCAL BUSINESSES. BOTH WITH A2 HELPS AND A2 NEIGHBORS, IF YOU WANT TO REACH OUT AND CHIP IN, THOSE ARE GREAT ORGANIZATIONS WITH OTHERS THAT SPARK HAS STEPPED IN AND HELPED TO TAKE CARE OF THE 501C STATUS AND BECOME A FIDUCIARY CAPACITY OF FACILITATING THE FUNDS. GREAT TO SEE THAT. AND ALSO DURING THE PRESENTATION, IT WAS GREAT TO HEAR ABOUT THE EFFORTS BEING MADE TO HELP THE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE COMMUNITY, THE IMMIGRANTS, THE UNDOCUMENTED. IT WAS GOOD TO SEE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO THAT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION PAID TO PPP AND EVERYTHING ELSE, WHICH HAS FAILED TO MAKE IT TO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER TOPIC. BUT IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE COUNTY IS WORKING TO HELP PROTECT THOSE IN THE SHADOWS. SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THANK YOU.
02:03:40.794: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:03:42.996: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WANTED TO SHARE THAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND I HAD A CONFERENCE WITH THE POLICE CHIEF COX THIS WEEK, AND WE HAD HEARD FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT THE CLEARING OF ENCAMPMENTS, PLACED WHERE HOMELESS MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY ARE SHELTERING IN PLACE. WE MENTIONED THESE CONCERNS TO CHIEF COX AND SO I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT AS A POLICY, DURING THIS TIME, THE CITY WILL NOT BE DISTURBING ANY ENCAMPS WHERE HOMELESS RESIDENTS ARE SHELTERING IN PLACE. I APPRECIATE HEARING CONCERNS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK EVERYONE IN THE CITY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE SIGNIFICANT OF DISRUPTING SOMEONE'S LIVING SITUATION RIGHT NOW. SO I GUESS TO EMPHASIZE THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AGREES WITH THE CDC'S RECOMMENDATION THAT THE ENCAMPMENTS AND THE VALUE OF THEM IN HELPING HOMELESS PEOPLE BETTER ISOLATE AND PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19. AND THEN JUST BRIEFLY, I WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE POSITIVE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE PASSING OF GRAYDON KRAPOHL. AND I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT HIS CONTRIBUTION AS A PUBLIC SERVANT TO HIS NEIGHBORHOOD, TO WARD 4 AND TO THIS CITY OVERALL IS ON OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US TO FEEL GRATEFUL, FEEL GRATEFUL FOR HIS LIFE AND SO I LOOK FORWARDS TO THE OPPORTUNITIES, WHATEVER PRESENT THEMSELVES TO HONOR HIM. THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THAT THE FAST LIEU FW WEEKS I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A PROJECT OF INTER INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE, ABOUT HOW WE IN ANN ARBOR ARE COPING AND ADJUSTING WITH COVID-19. TODAY, I PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL PUBLIC INTEREST, I INTERVIEWED OUR ATTORNEY, MR. POSTEMA. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW OUR CITY GOVERNMENT IS FUNCTIONING AND COPING UNDER THE DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. I WANTED TO MENTION THAT. YOU CAN FIND A TRANSSCRIPTION OF THE INTERVIEW AT MY WEBSITE AND YOU CAN FIND THE VIDEO AT A2COUCOVID-19.COM. THANKS.
02:06:06.005: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. FUMS FIRST OFF, I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO --
02:06:11.377: >> Councilmember Lumm: FIRST OFF, I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE THOUGHTFUL SENTIMENT EXPRESSED ABOUT THE LOSS OF OUR FORMER COUNCILMEMBER GRAYDON KRAPOHL. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SERVE WITH GRAYDON AND I KNOW HE WILL BE MISSED BY ALL OF US. HE WAS SO COMMITTED TO OUR COMMUNITY, OF COURSE, HIS COUNTRY, AS HAS BEEN NOTED, AND HIS NEIGHBORHOOD, HIS EXTENDED FAMILY, AND SO MANY AND MANY ARE GRIEVING HIS LOSS. I TOO WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND MY SINCERE SYMPATHIES TO HIS WIFE, DAUGHTER, AND HIS EXTENDED FAMILY AND EXTENDED NETWORK OF FRIENDS. IT'S VERY SAD THAT HE LOST HIS -- HE FOUGHT A VALIANT BATTLE AGAINST CANCER BUT HE DID IT IN HIS OWN WAY, I BELIEVE. OBVIOUSLY HE WAS ILL WHEN HE WAS ATTENDING COUNCIL MEETINGS AND HE MANAGED THAT ALL VERY PRIVATELY, AND IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE HIM TO -- TO MANAGE HIS ILLNESS IN THAT WAY, AND TO NOT SKIP A BEAT, REALLY IN TERMS OF HIS DEDICATION AND HIS WORK ETHIC. SO HE WILL BE GREATLY MISSED AND, AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE MAYOR AND MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE COMMENTS THAT I TOO SHARE AND ECHO. I APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND NOTED THAT -- I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FISHER HOUSE, I -- I APPRECIATED ALWAYS SEEING GRAYD GRAY DON ANS WIFE GRACE AT MANY FISHER HOUSE EVENTS. THEY ALWAYS FEATURE A SPEAKER AND TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL STORY, AND SO I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION, IT'S FISHER HOUSE IS IN THE SECOND WARD. IT'S A WONDERFUL PROJECT, AND IT'S REALLY A RONALD McDONALD HOUSE SORT OF HOME FOR VETERAN HOSPITAL PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. HOW NICE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS IN HIS MEMORY TO THE FISHER HOUSE. A FEW ITEMS OF CITY BUSINESS. FIRST, I TOO WOULD LIKE TO THANK SPARK, THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, THE UNITED WAY, AND THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR ARE -- FOR THEIR PRESENTATION TONIGHT, WHICH REVEALED A HECK OF A LOT OF WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND THEY HAVE BEEN, OBVIOUSLY, A TREMENDOUS RESOURCE FOR SO MANY AND ALL OF THEIR OUTREACH AND SUPPORT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. I KNOW IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. IN TERMS OF SPARK, IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT THEY ARE FACILITATING THESE APPLICATIONS BY NETWORKING IN A HELPFUL WAY SO THAT THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY, THE RESILIENCY FUND, THE CARES ACT, AND OTHER FUNDING SOURCES, THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE GREATLY NEEDED FUNDS AND OBVIOUSLY, AS PAUL NOTED, THESE PROGRAMS ARE WELL SUBSCRIBED AND -- AND THE NEED IS JUST SO SIGNIFICANT. SIMILARLY, WITH THE -- THE -- THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND THE UNITED WAY AND THE COMMUNITY -- THE COUNTY COMMUNITY HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING -- HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED TO SUPPORT, AGAIN, MANY -- SO MANY IN NEED. MR. CRAWFORD, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION, THE BUDGET PRESENTATION, INCLUDING THE UPDATE ON THE RANGE OF THE POTENTIAL CORONAVIRUS IMPACTS. I WILL HAVE A LOT OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS LATER, BUT I THINK ONE THING THAT WE ALL WILL NEED TO KNOW -- AND WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY WAS VERY SOBERING. I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS, AND WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. OBVIOUSLY, WITH THE GENERAL FUND AND ALL THE PROJECTION NUMBERS EXCLUDE THE COVID IMPACT. YOU GAVE US THE OPTIMISTIC AND PESSIMISTIC SCENARIOS. NO ONE HAS A CRYSTAL BALL, CERTAINLY. BUT IF THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE ARE IN THE 5 TO $10 MILLION RANGE WE ARE PROJECTING, WE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T AFFORD A BUDGET WITH EXPENDITURES ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE UNLESS WE ARE WILLING TO DEPLETE OUR RESERVES. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WISE. THE RESERVES WILL BE MUCH LESS THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE, IF THE ROUGHLY $5 MILLION HIT THAT YOU ARE PROJECTING THIS CURRENT YEAR COMES TO PASS. SO KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE THINKING IN TERMS OF THE PLAN B AND THE PROCESS TO GET THERE, I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US. AND I GUESS, JUST LASTLY ON THE YARD WASTE, I -- I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING UP WITH THIS WAY, OPENING UP THE DROPOFF FACILITY FOR FOLKS TO UNLOAD ALL OF THIS YARD WASTE AND I HAVE BEEN NAGGING STAFF ABOUT, YOU KNOW, COMING UP WITH OTHER OPTIONS, ALTERNATIVES. I CALL THEM PLAN B ALTERNATIVES. THIS WAS ONE OF THEM, AND THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'M SURE WE HAVE ALL BEEN HEARING FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. I SURE HAVE. THIS WILL PROVIDE A SERVICE THAT OUR RESIDENTS REALLY NEED AND HEAVILY RELY UPON THIS TIME OF YEAR. AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN.
02:12:35.728: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:12:37.530: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU. THESE ARE VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TIMES FOR US. AND I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS MEETING TONIGHT HAS BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE THANKFUL FOR SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO GIVE A COUPLE OF PERSONAL THANK YOUS. ONE TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO JOINED US FOR OUR ZOOM CAUCUS LAST NIGHT, AND ALSO FOR THE STUDENTS WHO CALLED ME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY. SO I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW INTELLIGENT THEY WERE AND HOW THOUGHTFUL THEY WERE. THEY TRULY UNDERSTOOD THE SUBJECT. TWO RESOLUTION AREAS THAT I'M WORKING ON RIGHT NOW WITH STAFF. ONE IS WHAT I'M TERMING OUTDOOR SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCING THAT IS MOVING FORWARD AND IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO REACH OUT TO ME, EITHER BY PHONE OR SCHEDULE A ZOOM SESSION, I WOULD WELCOME THAT. ANOTHER RESOLUTION THAT I ASKED STAFF ABOUT IS TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON NEW MIDBLOCK CROSSWALKS UNTIL THE CROSSWALKS THAT WE HAVE HAVE ADEQUATE ILLUMINATION. WHEN WE HAVE CROSSWALKS WITHOUT ILLUMINATION, IT PUTS PEOPLE AT RISK, AND AS ONE CONSTITUENT REFERRED TO IT, IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SOPHIE'S CHOICE OF CROSSWALKS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT, A CHOICE. WE SHOULD HAVE A HIGH STANDARD. AND FINALLY, I WANT TO REPEAT SOMETHING THAT NEIL SAID EARLIER TONIGHT ABOUT MAINTAINING CAPACITY. I THINK IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE DETERMINE WHAT IS ESSENTIAL VERSUS NONESSENTIAL. AND THAT WE LOOK TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR THEIR AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM TO TRY TO MAINTAIN THEIR CAPACITY AND WE DO THE SAME THING. THANK YOU.
02:14:58.804: >> Mayor Taylor: ARE THERE FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. IT IS 9:18. LET'S RECONVENE AT 9:25, IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ BREAK ]
02:24:21.766: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'RE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE NOW COME TO THE CONCEPT A -- CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY RAMLAWI, AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:24:36.114: >> Councilmember Smith: I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-10. I THINK IT WARRANTS FURTHER DISCUSSION.
02:24:42.454: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-10. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:24:43.689: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PULL CA-7 AND CA-8.
02:24:57.169: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA?
02:24:59.304: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY, WAS CA-7 PULLED?
02:25:05.377: >> Mayor Taylor: IT WAS?
02:25:06.078: >> Councilmember Nelson:  CA-7 AND CA-WHAT?
02:25:11.416: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE CA-7, CA-8, AND CA-10 PULLED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. AYOU WILL IN FA -- ALL IN FAVORE CONSENT AGENDA, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED. THE CONSENT AGENDA IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-5, CA-7, 8, AND 10 HAVE BEEN PULLED. CA-SO, RESOLUTION ADOPTING THE LIVING A2ZERO ANN ARBOR CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER?
02:25:52.290: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. ON NOVEMBER 4th OF LAST YEAR, THIS BODY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO CCREATE A PLAN TO BECOME CARBON NEUTRAL. IN FOUR SHORT MONTHS, THE OFFICE HAS GIVEN US A PLAN. I CAN'T THANK MS. STULTS AND HER TEAM FOR WORKING TIRELESSLY AND COLLABORATIVE FOR WORKING WITH THIS PLAN. OF COURSE OUR WORLD HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THESE SAME FOUR MONTHS, COVID-19 HAS CHANGED OUR WORLD IN WAYS BOTH LARGE AND MINUSCULE. AND COVID-19 HAS LAID BARE THE BREAKS IN OUR SOCIETY. LOCALLY BEING REGIONAL, NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONAL. WHAT COVID HAS NOT CHANGED IS CLIMATE CHANGE. IT HAS NOT CHANGED THE FACT THAT GLOBAL EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES NEED TO DROP FROM 45% FROM WHERE THEY WERE IN 2010 IN THE NEXT NINE YEARS TO LIMIT WARMING TO 1.5 DEGREES CELSIUS. IT HAS NOT CHANGED OUR CLIMATE CHANGE TRAJECTORY OR LESSENED THE NEED TO ACT NOW THE. IN FACT, WHAT COVID-19 HAS DONE IS TO FORCE US TO RETHINK OUR SOCIETY, OUR CULTURE, HOW WE DO THINGS AND HOW WE GO FORWARD TOGETHER. AS WE DEVELOP THESE PLANS TO GET THROUGH THE PANDEMIC, CARBON NEUTRALITY HAS TO BE AT THE BASIS OF EVERYTHING WE DO COMING OUT OF IT. OUR ECONOMY NEEDS TO BE RESAMED TORE MORE EQUITABLE AND MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE. WE NEED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE VAST IMPROVEMENT IN ELECTRIFICATION, TRANSPORTATION, AND HOUSING. AND THAT THE ROOT OF ALL OF THESE EFFORTS IS EQUITY. WE CAN SIDE ABIDE A SITE WHERE WE LEAVE THE VULNERABLE AND THE POOR BEHIND AND THE A2ZERO PLAN IS ROOTED IN EQUITY. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. ADOPTING THIS PLAN GIVES US THE DISASTERLINE FROM WHICH WE WORK, THE STARTING POINT FOR THE CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE INITIAL WORK PLAN FOR WHAT WE CAN DO TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF BECOMING A CARBON NEUTRAL CITY BY 2030, THE A2ZERO PLAN WILL EVOLVE AS CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND DO. FUTURE CITY COUNCILS WILL HAVE TO MAKE VALUE JUDGMENTS ON PRIORITIES AND PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS AND THE IMPACTS OF THEM WILL CHANGE OVER TIME, AS CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WE WILL NEVER HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS ON HOW BEST TO DO THAT. THERE'S ALWAYS A VARIABLE THAT IS DEPENDENT ON SOMETHING OUTOF OUR CONTROL AS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE CANNOT PAUSE THERE'S UNCERTAINTY. WE HAVE TO TAKE THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE TO GET TO WORK. CLIMATE CHANGE DOES NOT GIVE US THE LUXURY OF TIME. WE CANNOT WAIT, EVEN TO ARE A FORTNITE TO GET READY FOR THIS EFFORT. WE NEED TO USE EVERY SECOND OF THE TIME POST-COVID-19 AND MAKE SURE THAT CARBON NEUTRALITY IS THE UNDERLYING TENANT TO EVERYTHING WE DO. AGAIN, IF WE ARE GOING TO MEET THE GOALS THAT THIS COUNCIL SET FOR THE CITY BACK ON NOVEMBER 4th, THEN THIS IS THE STARTING POINT AND NOT THE FINISH LINE. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN ME TONIGHT IN VOTING TO ADOPT THE A2ZERO PLAN SO WE CAN GET TO WORK. THANK YOU.
02:29:33.245: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:29:34.079: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AS I MENTIONED IN MY EMAIL, THIS AFTERNOON, THERE MAY BE A CONSIDERATION OF POSTPONING THIS ITEM TONIGHT, BUT IF IT'S NOT POSTPONED, I WILL BE PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT. AI WON'T DO THAT YET TO WE CAN HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION. THE RESOLUTION BEFORE US, ADOPT THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. THE MERRIAM WEBSTER IS TO ACCEPT FORMALLY AND PUT INTO FORMAL, END QUOTE FOR THE WORD ADOPTION. AND THE LAST REVOLVE CLAUSE REQUESTS THE ADMINISTRATOR, BEGIN OR BEGIN WORK TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE PLAN, PERIOD, END QUOTE. IN MY OPINION, THERE ARE QUITE A FEW REASONS WHY WE ARE NOT READY TO, QUOTE, PUT INTO EFFECT, END QUOTE, OR TO, QUOTE, IMPLEMENT ACTIONS END QUOTE. HERE ARE A FEW. ONE, WE DO NOT HAVE A FUNDING PLAN FOR THE CITY'S ACTIONS WHICH ARE AT LEASTSHOP MILLION$N AND UPWARDS OF $300 MILLION, WHEN YOU CONSIDER PARK AND RIDE AND THE SOLAR LANDFILL FACILITIES. AND THERE'S A WIDE DISPARITY AND WE DO NOT HAVE A FRAMEWORK OR MECHANISM TO PRIORITIZE THEM. THREE, THE CITY AND OUR RESIDENTS ARE FACING UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL IMPACTS FROM COVID-19. FOUR, WE ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY EMBARKING ON ANOTHER MULTIMILLION DOLLARS INITIATIVE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FIVE, THE PLAN INCLUDES LAND USE ACTIONS, DENSITY, AND MIXED USE IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER WITH MINIMAL EMISSIONS BENEFIT. SIX, AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST, IMPLEMENTATION LIKELY WILL REQUIRE A NEW CITY TAX MILLAGE ON TOP OF LIKELY NEW MILLAGES OF THE AATA AND RTA. THE CITY MAY HAVE TWO MORE REQUESTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE SOLID WASTE MILLAGE. PLEASE DO NOT GET WE WRONG. I'M NOT CRITICAL -- I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL OF DR. STULTS OR HER TEAM, TO THE CONTRARY, THEY DID AN OUTSANDING JOB IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND PROVIDED COUNCIL EXACTLY WHAT WE REQUESTED. NOW THE BALL IS IN COUNCIL'S COURT. FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT LISTED, I WILL NOT SUPPORT ADOPTING THE PLAN TONIGHT. TO ME, THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE THE FIRST TWO I MENTIONED. LACK OF A GENERAL FUNDING PLAN OR MECHANISM TO PRIORIZE ACTIONS. MY AMENDMENT FOCUSES ON THOSE TWO ACTIONS AS KEY DELIVERABLES BY STAFF BEFORE COUNCIL FARMALLY ADOPTS A PLAN. ARE MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE WOULD REPLACE THE RESOLVE CLAUSES AND I SENT YOU THE LANGUAGE THIS AFTERNOON. THE FIRST RESOLVE RECEIVES THE PLAN RATHER THAN ADOPTING IT AND EXPRESSES COUNCIL'S AAPPRECIATEIATION. AND THE SECOND RESOLVE [ APPLAUSE ] REQUESTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO DEVELOP A GENERAL FUNDING PLAN AND A FRAMEWOK FOR MECHANISM FOR COUNCIL TO USE IN PRIORITIZING FIVE LEVERAGE ACTIONS. I RECOGNIZE THIS WILL NOT BE A FIRM, FI FIXED QUOTE/UNQUOTE DOR RANGE. IT GIVES US A SENSE OF WHAT THE COST TO ANN ARBOR TAXPAYERS WOULD BE. AND A MECHANISM TORE FRAMEWORK TO PRIORITIZE IS ABSOLUTELY' ESSENTIAL. THIS IS NOT AN ALL OR NOTHING PROPOSITION. AND THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE, REQUESTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO BRING THE PLAN BACK TO COUNCIL, FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION WHEN THE FUNDING PLAN AND PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. AT THAT POINT, COUNCIL VOTES TO FORMALLY ADOPT THE PLAN AND IF ADOPTED, WE COULD BEGIN YOU'RE EARNEST IMPLEMENTATION. I'M NOT MOVING THAT DIRECTION RIGHT NOW, SO THE DISCUSSION CAN BE OPEN. IF IT IS COUNCIL'S PREFERENCE, THANK YOU, JEFFREY FOR SENDING THAT LATE NOTICE OF THE MOMENTS TO POSTPONE, I'M FINE WITH THAT, BUT IF NOT, I WILL BE MOVING MY AMENDMENT. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
02:33:54.038: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:33:54.973: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH T FOR INTRODUCING SO COMPREHENSIVE AND THANK YOU, DR. STULTS FOR GETTING THIS AND BEING HONEST ABOUT OUR PRIORITIES, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND HOW YOU ANALYZED THIS ISSUE. IT'S REFRESHING, SINCERELY. I WILL NOW CONTINUE TO DISAGREE WITH SOME OF IT, BUT I THINK 2020 HAS BEEN A LONG YEAR FOR ALL OF US, I IT'S HARD TO REMEMR THAT THE CRISIS OF THE DAY, WAS THE WORLD WAS ON FIRE. CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE EMERGING CLIMATE CRISIS STAND TO BE HUMANITIES GREATEST CHALLENGE. UNLIKE COVID, THIS CRISIS WON'T JUST LAST THE 24 MONTHS IT TAKES TO INOCULATE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. THE FIGHT TO HALT THE CLIMATE CRISIS WILL LAST THREE OR FOUR GENERATIONS. I THINK DR. STULTS RIGHTLY COMPARED THE MOBILIZATION NEEDED TO RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE AS EQUIVALENT TO OUR NATION'S RESPONSE TO WORLD WAR II. FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE PATH OF NATURAL DISASTER, HURRICANES AND OUR RESIDENTS, IT'S FLOODING. IT MAY SEEM LIKE WE ARE IN A FOX HOLE TRYING TO SURVIVE. BUT FOR THE REST OF US, OUR FIGHT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT, LIKE ROSY RIVETER, IT'S ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND CREATING NEW MATERIAL. AND RETOOL AND AD ADAPT TO AI CHANGING WORLD BUT FOR THE MOST OF US, IT WILL BE TRUE PATRIOTS BY PAYING TAXES AND BUYING BONDS. I WILL BE GLAD TO VOTE FOR THIS TONIGHT, IT'S THOROUGH. IT'S DELIBERATIVE, AND IT GETS US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN TEN YEARS. THANKS.
02:36:01.165: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:36:07.171: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WILL PROBABLY NEED TO SPEAK TWICE ON THIS BECAUSE I HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY AND I DON'T HAVE IT NECESSARILY IN ORDER OF THOUGHT THAT WOULD FLOW AS MUCH AS I WANT. BUT I WOULD JUST BEGIN BY SAYING, WE HAVE BEEN TOLD -- AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT DR. STULTS AND HER STAFF HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THIS. LET ME NOT FORGET TO SAY THAT TO BEGIN WITH, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT, AND IN THAT -- AND THAT'S BECOME PARENAPPARENT REAL QUICK. IT'S ALREADY BECOME OUTDATED. COVID-19 IS ALREADY INTRODUCED A WHOLE NEW SET OF ISSUES THAT WE WERE NOT CONTEMPLATING WHEN WE ASKED FOR THIS TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO COUNCIL. AS WE CAN SEE ALREADY, ONLY A FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS INTO THIS, IT'S ALREADY OUTDATED. WE HAVE HUGE FINANCIAL ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS PLAN. FINANCIAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE RELY ON STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MUCH OF OUR GOALS AND, YOU KNOW, SO I APPRECIATE THE PLAN, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A HOME RUN. I THINK IT'S A START, BUT IT IS A LOT OF FALLACIES TO IT AND I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS TO HITCH OUR WAGON ON THIS, WE FOUND THE ANSWER TO CLIMATE NEUTRALITY, IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE. IT FRANKLY DOES NOT FIT THAT. WE DON'T HAVE THE COMMITMENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WHO IS A CONTRIBUTOR OF ONE-THIRD OF OUR CARBON EMISSIONS. WE DON'T HAVE THE UPSTREAM AND THE DOWNSTREAM EMISSIONS CALCULATED IN THIS. WE ARE TALKING WITH EQUITY. I APPRECIATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH SAID, BUT THIS COULD BE THE OPPOSITE. THIS COULD ACTUALLY MAKE ANN ARBOR EVEN MORE UNAFFORDABLE. IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COST THAT RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES MUST INCUR INTO MAKING THE SWITCH OVER TO ELECTRIFICATION. IT'S A HUGE COST AND THAT IS NOT EVEN A PART OF THIS. TO SAY THERE'S NOTHING TO WORK ON OR WORK WITH AND GOOD FORWARD, BUT THIS IS NOT -- THIS HAS TO BE MODIFIED AS WE GO FORWARD. SO I WILL BE ALSO INTRODUCING THE AMENDMENT TO THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE IN THIS. I SENT THIS TO MS. BEAUDRY AND MAYBE THE SECOND TIME I SPEAK, I WILL ASK FOR IT TO BE BROUGHT OUT. WE HAVE A PLAN HERE. IT'S NOT A PERFECT PLAN BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT FOR THE PERFECT PLAN TO GET HERE TO START ACTING. AND SO I WILL SAY THAT AND I WILL STICK WITH THAT. I THINK WE DON'T ASK ENOUGH FROM OUR RESIDENTS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY LIVE. AND HOW THEY TRAVEL AND WHAT THEY EAT. WE ARE IGNORING MAJOR GREEN HOUSE GAS CONTRIBUTORS BY THESE SIMPLE MEASURES, BASIC, BUT IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO EAT LESS MEAT. WE NEED TO GET ON PLANES LESS. I MEAN, THIS IS JUST A FACT OF LIFE, FOLKS. THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH. YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT COVID-19, FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE ONLY -- THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF BENEFITS TO COVID-19. ONLY TWO THAT I HAVE COUNTED SO FAR. [ NO AUDIO ] POLLUTION. I MEAN, WE HAVE SEEN THE SATELLITE MEASURES ALREADY FROM CHINA, FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION, FROM THE EAST COAST, AND HOW MUCH LESS GAS HOUSE EMISSIONS THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST MONTH. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IN THAT. WE SAW CRUDE FALL TO  INTO A NEGATIVE VALUE. WE ARE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT WORLD AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKING PLACE HERE. WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE I BELIEVE WE HAVE REACHED PEAK ENROLLMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE NUMBERS ON CAMPUS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THEY ARE CUTTING $100 MILLION TO 400 MER$400 MILLION IN THEIR CA. A LOT OF OUR EMISSIONS MAY BE CUT IN OTHER WAYS. I WILL SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND LET MY OTHER COLLEAGUES SPEAK AND HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.
02:41:20.584: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRAND. YOU ARE ON MUTE.
02:41:26.023: >> Councilmember Grand: I SHOULD BE GOOD NOW. LAST WEEK I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING WITH THE CITY SCHOOLS COMMITTEE THAT I SIT ON AND DR. STULTS NOT WITH US, AND GOT TO TALK ABOUT WAYS THAT WITH OUR PLAN GOODING FORWARD HOW WE COULD COLLABORATE WITH THE SCHOOLS AND THE BOND THAT THEY HAVE AND TRY TO REACH EFFICIENCIES. I THINK THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF POTENTIAL PARTNERS, EXISTING PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE LOOKING TO US, WHO ARE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE COMING FORWARD AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR US TO TAKE THIS ACTION TO HELP ENCOURAGE THEIR ACTION. SO I THINK IT WOULD BE -- I THINK IT WOULD BE THINKING MORE IN THE SHORT TERM TO POSTPONE THIS. I THINK IT'S -- EVEN AS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SAID, DR. STULTS GAVE US EXACTLY WHAT WE ASKED FOR. WE ASKED FOR THIS UNANIMOUSLY, WITHIN 82 DAYS SHE DID UNPRECEDENTED COMMUNITY INPUT AND ENGAGEMENT, WHICH WE ASKED FOR. AND THEY ARE EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATIONS. I THINK MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY DO CAPTURE -- MAYBE IT WASN'T THE -- BECAUSE IT WAS BASED IN EQUITY. BECAUSE IT WAS BASED RESILIENCY. WE HAVE -- MAYBE WE TAKE CERTAIN STEPS SOONER THAN WE THOUGHT AND THAT'S THE WHOLE INTEREST OF HAVING A ITERATE LIVING DOCUMENT AND MAYBE WE TAKES MORE STEPS TOWARDS RESILIENCE HUBS THAT MAYBE WE WERE NOT GOING TO TAKE INITIALLY AND OTHER THINGS GO ON THE BACK BURNER. THERE ARE NEW IDEAS THAT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT -- WE HAVE A LOT OF MESSAGES IN FULL SUPPORT BUT WE ALSO GOT SOME THAT SAID YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT X OR Y OR Z AND I THINK THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF GOING FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN AND COMING FORWARD IN SUPPORT OF IT, NOT DELAYING, NOT ASKING FOR INFORMATION THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY KILL IT, BUT TO GET BEHIND IT, GO FORWARD, PUT WHAT WE KNOW WE CAN INTO OUR BUDGET AND THEN GIVE DR. STULTS AND HER VERY TALENTED STAFF THE ABILITY TO FIND FUNDS. THERE MAY NOT BE FUNDS AT THIS POINT. MAYBE THERE'S STIMULUS. MAYBE THERE'S ALL OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE GREEN ECONOMY STIMULUS PACKAGES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS PLAN IN PLACE AND THAT MIGHT EVEN BE A REQUIREMENT TO GET MONEY LIKE THIS, TO HAVE A CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. I HOPE THAT WE'RE GOING TO STICK TO WHAT WE ASKED FOR, MOVE FORWARD AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY TIMES TO ARGUE WITH THE ITERATIVE DETAILS BUT WITH APPROVING A BUDGET JUST A FEW WEEKS AWAY, I HOPE WE CAN TAKE THIS IMPORTANT STEP AND THEN CONTINUE TO WORK AT IT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO.
02:44:18.929: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:44:20.531: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WELL THANK YOU. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL WORK OKAY BECAUSE I'M HAVING REAL NETWORK TROUBLES OVER HERE. I GOT A LOOK AT COUNCILWOMAN LUMM'S SUGGESTIONS AND IT TAKES SOME OF MY CONCERNS AWAY THAT I HAD ADDRESSING THIS TONIGHT. A SPEAKER EARLIER WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT A VIDEO AND QUOTED ME AS SAYING I SUPPORT RADICAL NOTIONS AND I THINK PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT'S TRUE, THAT I DO. AND I HAVE FOR QUITE SOMETIME. WHEN WE FIRST PROPOSED CLIMATE ACTION, BACK IN 2012, I WAS BEFORE COUNCIL SUPPORTING SUPPOG RADICAL NOTIONS SUCH AS PRESERVING FARMLAND AND GREEN SPACE AND NEW CONSTRUCTION VIA ELECTRIC AND SO ON. WE HAVE HAD -- MUCH TO MY DELIGHT, KEN GARBER WHO SPOKE EARLIER IN FAVOR OF THIS PLAN, BROUGHT FORWARD A WELL-CRAFTED RESOLUTION TO DO JUST THAT, TO REQUIRE JUST THAT, AND IT KIND OF -- IT BOUNCED IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND KIND OF DIED AND I SENT THAT FORWARD TO LEGAL TO GET THAT GOING. THERE'S NO REASON WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 2022 TO REQUIRE THAT TYPE OF BUILDING AND NEW CONSTRUCTION. SO, YEAH, THAT'S A RADICAL NOTION. I'M ALL FOR IT. THERE ARE THINGS SINCE 2012, WE COULD HAVE HAD THEM DOING, AND IF THAT IS CONSIDERED RADICAL, THEN I'M FOR THOSE, AND THAT'S THINGS LIKE BANNING PLANE, TRAVEL, PRESERVING GREEN SPACE AND FARMLAND AGAIN, AND DOING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITH AS LITTLE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE AND UNIVERSITIES ARE ABOUT TO HAVE. AND NOT BEING DEPENDENT ON US BUT THEIR OWN CLIMATE ACTION PLAN BEING I'M SURE THEIRS IS IN A GREAT DEAL OF FLUX TOO. SO THOSE RADICAL NOTIONS THAT I SUPPORT ARE THINGS THAT UNFORTUNATELY -- SOME OF THEM ARE NOT IN THIS PLAN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PUT IN THE PLAN, WHICH IS WHY I LIKE COUNCILWOMAN LUMM'S SUGGESTIONS, AND THAT IS LIKE COUNTING AND NEW CONSTRUCTION, AND SOMEHOW ASSIGNING A CARBON LOAD TO OUR COMMUTERS AND POSSIBLY DOING A GRADE STUDY TO FIND OUT WHAT OUR BEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS IN THIS PLAN, AS WE MOVE FORWARD, AS I SPOKE TO -- AT OUR LAST MEETING TO PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS IN LIGHT OF OUR BUDGET WHOAS. AND SO I DON'T WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A FALSE SENSE OF DOING SOMETHING, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HOPE. THE INPUTS INTO SYSTEM, THEY ARE THERE, AND WHILE WE ARE LEADING AS A CITY AND WE HOPE THAT OTHERS FOLLOW, WE ALSO WANT BANKRUPT OUR CITY IN TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT ACCOUNTS FOR .00.001. CARBON ON THE PLANET. I THINK WE CAN PRIORITIZE THOSE EFFORTS AND THERE ARE THINGS IN HERE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE NECESSARY OR MAYBE COULD WAIT, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE NOTION THAT WHEN WE DALL DECLARA CLIMATE EMERGENCY, WE BACKED IT UP FROM 2035 TO 2030. AND WE PUT THE PRESSURE ON OURSELF. MY BIG ISSUE IS THE STORMWATER ISSUE AND ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND LOCAL FARMING AND MORE OF THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THAT IN THIS PLAN GOING FORWARD AND REPRIORITIZE IT, POTENTIALLY AND THAT'S WHY I THINK COUNCILWOMAN LUMM HAS SOME GOOD IDEAS WITH THOSE RESOLVE CLAUSES. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WE ASK ALL THE FOLKS THAT WE CONTRACT WITH, AND I DON'T MEAN LIKE ROAD BUILDERS BUT I MEAN FOLKS LIKE SPARK TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHO THEY INVEST IN AND THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT THEY INVEST IN AND TRY TO FOCUS THAT INVESTMENT ON THINGS THAT SUPPORT THESE CLIMATE -- [ NO AUDIO ] GOALS AND THAT WOULD BE HOWEVER THEY WANT -- HOWEVER WE WANT TO DEFINE THAT FOR THEM, BUT I THINK MOVING FORWARD AS WE COME OUT OF THIS BUDGET CRISIS, WORK EXTRA HARD TO SUPPORT THESE CLIMATE ACTION GOALS AND THEREBY MAYBE WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE PARTS OF THE PLANET THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL. SO I WILL REFE RESERVE THE RESTY TIME. THANK YOU.
02:48:46.430: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:48:47.731: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. IN NOVEMBER WE DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND WE ASKED STAFF FOR AN AMBITIOUS AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS OUR CARBON IN OUR COMMUNITY. STAFF HAS PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO RELATING ELABORATE PLANNING AND BROUGHT IT TO US. BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THAT PLAN. THE PLAN SPENDS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR AND REALLY HAS LITTLE IMPACT IN THE OVERALL CARBON IN THE COMMUNITY UNTIL THE YEAR 2026. WE CALL THIS GRAPH. THERE'S A DROPOFF BETWEEN 2026 AND 2027, BUT ONLY IF STATE CHANGES STATE LAW, THAT ALLOWS COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION AND ONLY IF AX ATA ACCOMPLISHES THE TRANSIT GOALS THAT WE HAVE SET FOR THEM. AND I THINK THAT WAITING FOR SIX YEARS TO SEE IF WHAT WE WANT TO HAPPEN HAPPENS, ISN'T REALLY A PLAN. I WOULD MUCH RATHER SEE THAT WE ACCOMPLISH FOR IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. IF WE GET TO 2026 AND VICE PRESIDENT ACCOMPLISHED THE CHANGE IN LAWS AND THE CHANGE IN MASS TRANSIT THAT WE SEEK, WE ARE LEFT WITH THREE YEARS BEFORE THE END OF OUR GOAL PERIOD AND WE WILL HAVE TO DO EVER SO MUCH MORE. I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE SENDING THIS BACK TO STAFF AND ASKING FOR CHANGES IN THIS PLAN TO BE MORE AGGRESS ENVIRONMENT ABOUTI. I SAW COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S AMENDMENTS AND I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THOSE INSTEAD OF POSTPONE THIS PLAN. I THINK WE SHOULD RECEIVE THIS AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE FINANCES AND THE PRIORITIZATION AND THE DETAILS INSIDE THE PLAN AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT SHOULD BE A LIVING PLAN BUT ADOPTING IT REALLY HAS A DIFFERENT CONNOTATION THAN WHAT THE CONCEPT OF A LIVING PLAN DENOTES. SO I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S AMENDMENTS. I HOPE SHE BRINGS THEM FORWARD AT THIS TIME.
02:51:31.962: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
02:51:33.664: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. I'M 100% BEHIND THE GOAL HERE AND I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF PROCESS QUESTIONS AND THAT IS, IF WE APPROVE THE PLAN TONIGHT, GIVEN THAT MUCH OF THE PLAN AND THE DOLLARS ARE NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL, I'M JUST WONDERING EXACTLY HOW THAT WORKS; AND SECONDLY, IF WE APPROVE THE PLAN TONIGHT, AND THEN WE APPROVE A BUDGET IN A FEW WEEKS, WILL THAT POSSIBLY OVERRIDE SOME OF WHAT WE HAVE APPROVED TONIGHT? AND I'M JUST TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. I'M NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE IN ANY WAY. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TONIGHT AND THEN FUTURE ACTIONS.
02:52:22.679: >> Mayor Taylor: DR. STULTS, PERHAPS?
02:52:28.785: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY UNDERSTANDING IS, NO, IT WOULD NOT OVERRIDE OR UNDERRIDE THE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS. IT'S A DIRECTIONAL STRATEGY, AND AS INDICATION, WE ARE WORKING ON SHOVEL-READY PROJECTS AND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IS USE THE PLAN'S DIRECTION TO SAY THESE ARE EXACTLY THE KIND OF PLANS WE WANT TO SEEK FUNDING FOR BECAUSE WE ARE ASSUMING THAT THERE'S SUPPORT FOR AT LEAST SOME OF THE CONCEPTS AND I'M TAKING COPIOUS NOTES HERE TO VALIDATE THAT. SO I WOULD DEFAULT TO ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD OR ANY OTHER PROCEDURAL THINGS THAT I MAY HAVE MISSED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS, NO, IT WOULD NOT DISRUPT.
02:53:06.023: >> Councilmember Griswold: AND SHOVEL READY IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THERE WILL PROBABLY BE STIMULUS MONEY.
02:53:13.163: >> EXACTLY.
02:53:13.497: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. AND THEN MR. CRAWFORD, WHAT -- WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE APPROVE A BUDGET THAT MAY NOT BE IDENTICAL TO WHAT'S BEEN LAID OUT IN THIS PLAN?
02:53:33.950: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, THE FISCAL '21 BUDGET IS CONSISTENTENT WITH THE PLAN AND THE RESOURCES -- THE INTENT IS TO HELP THAT PRODUCE -- START THE PRODUCTION OF THE OUT YEARS. WE WILL MORPH TO WHATEVER COUNCIL APPROVES. SO IF COUNCIL, THROUGH A BUDGET ADJUSTMENT CHANGES THE ALLOCATIONS AND WE'RE UNABLE TO ADJUST INTERNALLY TO REPLACE THOSE, THEN THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PLAN AND HOW WE WOULD STEP FORWARD. IT MIGHT DELAY THINGS OR REARRANGE THINGS. WELL, IT WOULD DEPEND.
02:54:12.823: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:54:14.691: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU WILL USE ONE OF MY TIMES NOW TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE PLAN, AS IS. WE DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY BACK IN NOVEMBER, AND THE RISE OF COVID-19 HAS NOT CHANGED THE FACT THAT A CLIMATE EMERGENCY EXISTS AND IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE -- OUR CHANGING CLIMATE IS OUR NUMBER ONE THREAT, OUR NUMBER ONE THREAT TO US AS A LOCAL COMMUNITY, AS A STATE, NATION, AND A GLOBAL SOCIETY. WE ARE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE NOW. AND WE KNOW THIS IS A FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP IN LANSING AND IN WASHINGTON. WHAT IT MEANS IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO TAKE REAL AND CONCRETE ACTION TO REFLECT CARBON NEUTRALITY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE. WE HAVE ASKED OUR EXPERTS. WE HAVE ASKED THE EXPERTS ON OUR STAFF. WE HAVE ASKED THE EXPERTS IN THE COMMUNITY TO BAND TOGETHER IN AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF -- IN INCREDIBLY SWIFT, BROAD AND DEEP PROCESS. TO GIVE US THEIR BEST SUGGESTION AT THIS TIME, ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TODAY, OF HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030. IF THERE ARE THINGS IN THE PLAN THAT WE WISH WERE DIFFERENT, AND THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE AND THAT DON'T MEET OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW BEST TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY, WELL, I'M A LAWYER, AND I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY CLIMATE SCIENTISTS HERE ON THE CITY COUNCIL. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY EXPERTS IN THE AREA. WE HAVE ASKED OUR EXPERTS WHAT TO DO, HOW WE SHOULD DO IT, HOW WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND WE HAVE GIVEN US THE PATH AND THE TIMELINE. AND IF WE BELIEVE IT IS AN EMERGENCY, AND WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030, WE NEED TO ADOPT THE PLAN -- NOT DITHER -- ADOPT THE PLAN AND MOVE FORWARD. ADOPTING THE PLAN DOES NOT -- DOES NOT AFFECT BUDGET CHANGES. IT DOES NOT OBLIGATE US TO WRITE A BILLION DOLLARS CHECK. WHAT IT MEANS IS WE HAVE A SET OF PROJECTS AND A SET OF GOALS AND A SET OF AREAS IN WHICH TO TAKE REAL AND CONCRETE ACTION. IT ESTABLISHES THE ABILITY FOR US WITH AN ADOPTED PLAN TO GO OUT AND GET GRANT FUNDING AND WORK WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS BECAUSE IT EXPRESSED OUR FULL AND DEEP COMMIT COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS REPRESENTED IN THE PLAN. FAILURE TO DO THAT, FAILURE -- AND TO DO ANYTHING LESS IS IN MY VIEW ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE AND I THINK ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:57:32.422: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE AMENDMENT WHICH, I SENT YOU EARLIER TODAY TO REPLACE THE EXISTING CLAUSES WITH THE THREE RESOLVE CLAUSES I SENT IT. IT SAYS THAT CITY COUNCIL RECEIVES THE PLAN. IN TERMS OF THE ARGUMENT THAT WE MUST ADOPT THE PLAN, IN ORDER TO GET ANY EXTERNAL FUNDING, I -- I THINK THAT'S AN OVERSTATEMENT, BUT IN MY CASE, IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE ADOPTION LATER. IN FACT, IT SAYS ONCE WE HAVE A DIRECTIONAL FUNDING PLAN AND A FRAMEWORK FOR PRIORITIZATION, COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER FORMAL ADOPTION. AND MY AMENDMENT SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE'LL APPROACH THIS LOGICALLY AND RESPONSIBLY WITH THE GENERAL FUNDING PLAN AND FRAMEWORK TO OPTIMIZE COST BENEFITS BEFORE WE START SPENDING ON -- THERE ARE SEVEN STRATEGIES AND 44 ACTIONS HERE AND I WILL NOTE THAT IT'S IMPLIED THAT ADOPTING A PLAN DOESN'T INFLUENCE BUDGET PLANNING LONG TERM. I COMPLETELY VIOLENTLY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY DISAGREE WITH THAT. THAT'S TO SAY -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PUT IT KINDLY OR GENTLY. THAT'S REALLY MISLEADING TO BE QUITE HONEST. THINK 40-20-20, I CAN RATTLE OFF ALL TYPES OF EXAMPLES. THIS PLAN HAS A AGAIN, 44 ACTIONS. MOST INVOLVE THE CITY AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OR THE FACILITATOR OF THE PROGRAMS, AND THE TOTAL PLAN COST IS A LITTLE OVER $1 BILLION AND EACH STRATEGY HAS A COST, THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF COST STRATEGIES BUT ROUGHLY IT'S $50 MILLION A YEAR. ONE OF THE SLIDES IN DR. STULTS' PRESENTATION, YOU LOOK AT YOUR SLIDE, THAT WAS SLIDE 24 FOR WHATEVER IT WAS WORTH, INDICATED THAT. SO TH THEY ARE ADOPTING, YOU ARA SAYING, YES, I'M GIVING THE GREEN LIGHT TO PROVIDING THIS DIRECTION TO STAFF, FOR A LONG-TERM FUNDING PLAN. THE -- IT'S ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A FUNDING PLAN IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS IN PLACE, AND, YOU KNOW, I RECOGNIZE WE CAN'T DO A DEFINITIVE TO THE DOLLAR KIND OF FUNDING PLAN, BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY -- WE CAN CERTAINLY DO A DIRECTIONAL FUNDING PLAN WITH RANGES AND TONIGHT IS AN EXAMPLE. MR. CRAWFORD PRESENTED OPTIMISTIC AND PESSIMISTIC SCENARIOS FOR COVID-19 FINANCIAL IMPACTS AND WE COULD DO THE EXACT SAME THING FOR EXTERNAL FUNDING BY THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AND WITH THAT, WE HAVE A SENSE -- SOME SENSE OF WHAT WAS ON THE ANN ARBOR TAXPAYER'S DIME, WHICH WHERE HE DON'T HAVE NOW. THAT WOULD BE VERY INFORMATIVE. I FOR ONE AM NOT GOING TO BE -- I DON'T THINK IT'S RESPONSIBLE TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING RECEIVEN STRATEGIES AND 44 ACTIONS, COSTING THE CITY UPWARDS OF $300 MILLION. THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN, WITHOUT HAVING SOME SENSE OF HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. I JUST THINK THAT'S FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE. I HAVE ALSO RECOGNIZED THE PLAN WILL BE FLUID AND INCREMENTAL, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO JUST GET GOING ON IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE WE EVER HAVE SOME REASONABLABLE HANDLE ON THE COST TO RESIDENTS. THAT'S WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS DO, AND THE SECOND RESOLVE SAYS THAT CITY COUNCIL REQUESTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR DEVELOP A FUNDING PLAN AND WE DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK OR A MECHANISM FOR COUNCIL TO UTILIZE IN EVALUATING AND PRIORITIZING HIGH LEVEL -- HIGH LEVERAGE ACTIONS AND FINALLY, RESOLVE THAT CITY COUNCIL REQUEST THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR PRESENT THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN FOR THE CITY COUNCIL FOR ADOPTION WHEN THE FUNDING PLAN AND THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK. I MOVE, AGAIN, THIS AMENDMENT TO REPLACE EXISTING RESOLVE CLAUSES WITH THESE THREE RESOLVE CLAUSES.
03:01:51.281: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THIS A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. LET'S HAVE A KNEW QUEUE ON THESE AMENDMENTS. I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU WERE ON MY OLD QUEUE, DO YOU WANT TO BE FIRST ON THE NEW? I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU. YOU ARE ON MUTE. SO YES. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:02:13.836: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST A QUESTION FOR OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO ASK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE FOR THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE TO BE EXECUTED AND PRESENTED BACK TO COUNCIL TO SATISFY THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE. LIKE, WHAT TYPE OF K TIME FRAME ARE WE LOOKING AT IN GETTING THAT?
03:02:36.759: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD WANT TO CONSULT WITH DR. STULTS, BUT THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE, I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME. WHICH ONE WAS THAT? WAS THAT THE FUNDING PLAN?
03:02:49.639: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I AM SORRY, IT KEEPS CUTTING OUT. I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.
03:02:56.045: >> City Admin. Crawford: I DON'T HAVE THE RESOLVE PLAN. TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR A MECHANISM FOR COUNCIL TO UTILIZE INVEIGH VAL WAIT.
03:03:08.625: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD WANT TO CONSULT WITH DR. STULTS BUT I WOULD BELIEVE WE COULD GET BACK TO YOU IN -- BEFORE YOUR BUDGET ADOPTION. MANY.
03:03:21.471: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND THIS WOULD BE TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMBINE THOSE TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES INTO ONE? IS THERE A REASON THEY ARE --
03:03:30.880: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHICH TWO? THERE ARE THREE.
03:03:32.315: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE SECOND AND THIRD.
03:03:34.617: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M REPLACING THE EXISTING WITH THESE:  BECAUSE I -- I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO PROVIDE -- THANKS FOR ASKING, THAT THIS THEN BE BROUGHT BACK FOR ADOPTION WHEN THE FUNDING PLAN AND PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK HAD BEEN DEVELOPED, BECAUSE WE -- WE HAVE NEITHER. SO I WANT -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE DIRECTION THAT THAT IS WHAT WOULD TRIGGER BRINGING THAT BACK TO US, WHEN THE INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED US.
03:04:05.181: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THESE RESOLUTIONS FORTH. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A SOLID BASE, A GOOD FOUNDATION BEFORE WE JUST GO FORWARD, BECAUSE I -- I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK. I THINK IT'S ONLY PRUDENT TO BE ASKING THESE THINGS, AND I WOULD -- I WOULD SUPPORT THIS AS LONG AS IT DID NOT DELAY THE ADOPTION IN THIS YEAR'S UPCOMING BUDGET. I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS IN PLACE, AND HAVE THIS IDENTIFIED AND ADOPTED, OR AT LEAST, LOOKED AT BEFORE WE FORMALLY ADOPT IT AND IT DOES BECOME FORMAL POLICY. AND AS YOU SAID BEFORE, GOOD LUCK ON TRYING THAT AFTER IT'S BEEN TRIED.
03:05:03.973: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:05:09.879: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. I'M GOING TO SPEAK WITHOUT THE -- YEAH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. I'M SPEAKING WITHOUT THE VIDEO BECAUSE MY CONNECTION IS VERY POOR.
03:05:18.588: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
03:05:19.455: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU. SO, YEAH, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THESE RESOLUTIONS, AS I INDICATED EARLIER. I THINK IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE. WE TAKE A LOOK AT, SAY, YOU KNOW -- I MEAN WE ALL KNOW, IT'S A FACT THAT HOW AS U OF M GOES, SO GOES THE CITY AND EVEN IN THIS CASE, WITHOUT DRASTIC ACTION ON THE CITY'S PART, LIKE FORMER MAYOR HEFJA DID, WHERE WE DRAMATICALLY CUT STAFF IN THE 2008 RECESSION, WHAT DO WE THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE? I THINK THIS IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE TO ASK FOR A SKELETON OUTLINE OF HOW TO PAY FOR THIS. EVEN SUGGESTIONS I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT. WAY, PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE ARE GETTING INTO. I THINK WHEN WE SAW OUR PRESENTATION OF COMMUNITY NEEDS EARLIER, WE SAW THAT, YOU KNOW, ALMOST -- I WOULD -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT FULLY A QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE IN ANN ARBOR -- EITHER THEIR KIDS RECEIVE, YOU KNOW, A FEDERAL FREE SCHOOL LUNCH OR THEY ARE IN SOME WAY CONSIDERED POVERTY AND NOT JUST IN ASSOCIATION WITH WASHTENAW AND ANN ARBOR. THAT'S FULLY A QUARTER OF US HERE IN THE CITY ARE QUESTIONING, HOW ARE WE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS? THAT MEANS A COUPLE OF US HERE ON COUNCIL ARE GOING TO SPEAK UP FOR THOSE PEOPLE AND I WILL BE ONE OF THEM. I'M HAPPY TO SEE WE ARE ASKING HOW WERE WE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS? YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S -- THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE, MOVING FORWARD ON THIS AND I WILL SEND THIS TO DR. STULTS MYSELF, BUT HOW DO WE GET THINGS INTO THIS DOCUMENT? HOW DO WE FIND OUT AND MAKE THE SUGGESTIONS? WELL, YOU KNOW, I READ THROUGH IT. I HAVE TAKEN INPUT FROM COMMUNITY, AND NEIGHBORS AND PEOPLE WHO SAT ON VARIOUS GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES HELP YOU FORM THIS DOCUMENT, DR. STULTS, AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO, YOU KNOW, REPREPRIORITIZE AND GET THESE THINGS INTO THE DOCUMENT. BEING INFLEXIBLE AND SAYING WE CAN'T ASK FOR A SPENDING GUYLINE BEFORE WE VOTE FOR IT, DOESN'T FILL ME WITH THE HOPE THAT THIS IS, INDEED A LIVING DOCUMENT AND WE DO, INDEED HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET THINGS IN THERE. THE NOTION THAT THIS IS AN ALL OR NOTHING THING DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU MAY ALL RECALL THAT I PROPOSED NET ZERO FOR ALL OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AND IT WAS SCOFFED AT AND VOTED DOWN BY THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW SPONSORING THIS RESOLUTION. SO I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A GUT CHECK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE UP TO HERE. THANK YOU.
03:07:53.409: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:07:56.012: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I JUST -- I JUST WANT TO VERIFY SOME THINGS THAT I FEEL LIKE I HEARD. A COUPLE OF THINGS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A LARGE DEGREE OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PLAN IS NOT FRONT LOADED. IT'S PUSH OFF INTO THE FUTURE AND WHAT I HEARD MR. CRAWFORD, THE CURRENT BUDGET IS FULLY FUNDING THE UPCOMING YEAR OF THE BEGINNING OF THIS PLAN. DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT, MR. CRAWFORD?
03:08:28.844: >> City Admin. Crawford: ALMOST ALL OF IT. YES. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF MINOR ITEMS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDES.
03:08:34.850: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO YEAH, I GUESS I WOULD SHARE THE SURPRISE AT HOW -- HOW THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN FRAMED. BECAUSE IF THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROJECT, THE START OF THIS PLAN IS FUN FUNDED IN THE CURRENT BU, IT DOESN'T STRIKE ME THAT IT'S A CALAMITY TO ASK FOR SOME EXPLANATION AROUND FUTURE FUNDING THAT IS UPCOMING. I GUESS THAT'S MY ONLY CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION, MR. CRAWFORD.
03:09:17.927: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:09:18.761: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM DR. STULTS, BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM MR. CRAWFORD ABOUT REALISTICALLY HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO GET THIS TOGETHER. I PERSONALLY FIND THE LANGUAGE A LITTLE UNCLEAR IN TERMS OF WHAT SOME OF THESE THINGS MEAN BECAUSE I THINK YOU GAVE US SOME COST PROJECTIONS AND YOU KNOW, TRADEOFFS AND PRIORITIZATION IN THE PLAN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS AND HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO GET THERE?
03:09:52.795: >>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND ONE THAT I'M NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER ON THE SPOT. I MEAN, I HAVE TO STEP BACK AND REALLY UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A BUDGET PRESENTATION AND THEN THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK. I HAVE IDEAS IN MY HEAD OF WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR BUST I'M NOT -- BUT I'M NOT -- I NEED TO TALK TO THE TEAM AND DO SOME RESEARCH AND REALLY UNDERSTAND THE ROBUSTNESS OF WHAT IS BEING ASKED SO WE CAN PRODUCE IT IN A WAY THAT FEELS COMPREHENCEY. SO I APOLOGIZE BUT I'M NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
03:10:21.223: >> Councilmember Grand: IF IT'S OKAY IF THE MAYOR, IF I CAN TURN THAT QUESTION TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU MEAN WITH THIS. I HONESTLY FIND THE LANGUAGE PRETTY VAGUE AND IT JUST -- IT SEEMS HONESTLY LIKE IT'S JUST THROWING A WRENCH IN THE PROCESS AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE DIFFERENT WHERE WE HAVE BUDGET NUMBERS AND PRIORITIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S PRIORITIZATION FOR WHAT IS GOING TO WITH THIS YEAR. SO I'M TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO ASKING US.
03:10:57.693: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S ASKING FOR A FUNDING PLAN. WE GOT LOTS OF NUMBERS. I REFERRED TO THE SLIDES IN THE PRESENTATION. YOU ASKED FOR EXAMPLES HERE YOU GO. STRATEGY ONE, HAS A $4.1 MILLION PLAN. NO FUNDING. STRATEGY TWO. WE ARE BEING ASKED TO ADOPT ALL OF THESE STRATEGIES $140 MILLION CLASS, NO FUNDING PLAN. AND STRATEGY FOUR, AND STRATEGIES FIVE AND 6, $3 MILLION COST, NO FUNDING PLAN. AND STRATEGY 7, $11 MILLION COST, AND THE TOTAL PLAN FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION OF 2.19 MILLION METRIC TONS, IT'S AGAIN, OVER $1 BILLION AND THE -- THERE WAS ANOTHER SLIDE THAT SHOWED IT'S ROUGHLY $50 MILLION A YEAR. AND, AGAIN, IT LACKS A FUNDING PLAN AND THE FUNDING SOURCES. THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING FOR -- YEAH, IT'S THE BASIC STUFF THAT WE ASK -- WE IDENTIFY, WHEN WE MAKE BUDGET AMENDMENTS. YOU ACTUALLY IDENTIFY A FUNDING SOURCE, WHENEVER WE APPROVE ANYTHING. WITH YOU NEED A FUNDING SOURCE. WE DON'T HAVE FUNDING SOURCES FOR THESE RECOMMENDATIONS, AND THAT'S WHY THE BUDGET AMENDMENT, I WILL READ IT AGAIN --
03:12:25.648: >> Councilmember Grand: YOU DON'T NEED TO READ IT AGAIN. I CAN READ IT.
03:12:29.418: >> Councilmember Lumm: THE FRAMEWORK OR THE MECHANISM TO -- THAT WE CAN UTILIZE TO PRIORITIZE THE HIGH LEVERAGE ACTIONS BECAUSE THERE'S A WIDE DISPARITY OF THE 44 ACTIONS. AND I THINK, AGAIN, THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY THEY ARE ESSENTIAL. AND THERE WERE REFERENCES IN THE PLAN TO -- THERE WAS NO SOLID WASTE WITH THE SOLID WASTE PLAN AND THAT WAS TOUGH TO FIND IN THE A2ZERO REPORT. THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO WHAT WOULD BE --
03:13:07.857: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I THINK -- I HAZARD A GUESS THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND SEES HER QUESTION AS ANSWERED.
03:13:13.262: >> Councilmember Grand: YES. WELL, NOT ANSWERED BUT, YOU KNOW THAT'S --
03:13:17.700: >> Councilmember Lumm: (INAUDIB.
03:13:18.434: >> Councilmember Grand: I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO CONTINUE TO ANSWER IT. I GOT THE ANSWER I'M LOOKING FOR. THANKS. SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET AMENDMENT -- OR THIS AMENDMENT TO THIS. I THINK IT REPRESENTS A PATTERN THAT I FIND PARTICULARLY TROUBLING WITH THIS COUNCIL WHERE WE ASK TO ARE SOME THINGS. WE HAVE OUR EXPERT STAFF GO OUT AND COME BACK WITH A PLAN, AND IN SOME CASES, -- NOT EVERYONE AT THIS BODY, BUT WE INSATELLITE OUR EXPERTS AND THEN WE OBSTRUCT AND WE DELAY AND THEN WE DON'T DO ANYTHING. AND IF THERE IS A CONCERN OF THIS COUNCIL NOT GETTING ANYTHING DONE, HERE'S EXHIBIT A. AGAIN, WE ASKED, WE STATE OUR VALUES. WE WANT TO SUPPORT IT BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT IT. THIS IS A WAY OF SUPPORTING IT, BUT NOT REALLY SUPPORTING IT. SO INSTEAD WHY DON'T WE SUPPORT IT AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD? SO I UNDERSTAND. I CAN SEE ALL OF YOUR FACES NOW. THAT YOU DISAGREE. I DON'T ASK YOU TO DISAGREE OR ARGUE WITH ME ABOUT IT. I KNOW WHICH WAY THIS IS GOING TO GO. CORRI CAN READ THE ROOM, BUT I'M NEVERTHELESS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADOPTING AND RECEIVING IF IT PASSES, I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS THIS EVENING UNTIL WE ARE READY TO PUT ON OUR BIG -- YOU KNOW, UNTIL WE ARE ACTUALLY READY TO PUT OUR MONEY WITH OUR MOUTH IS AND MOVE FORWARD, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING FOR FREE.
03:14:48.590: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:14:55.531: >> Councilmember Lumm: MY HAND IS STILL UP? SORRY.
03:14:57.833: >> Mayor Taylor: NO?
03:14:59.234: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
03:14:59.835: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:15:04.673: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF PLANS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE EITHER IDENTIFY A FUNDING SOURCE ON THE FRONT END AND PLAN TO IMPLEMENT IT LATER OR WE DESIGN A PLAN AND THEN FIND THE FUNDING SOURCE AS WE CAN. I THINK IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS, IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK AND FIND THE FUNDING SOURCE AS WE CAN. IF WE THINK THIS IS A CRISIS, THE FIRST STEP IS WHAT IS THE RESPONSE? AND THEN THE SECOND STEP IS HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT THAT? I THINK PRIME EXAMPLES ARE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS IN WHICH WE IDENTIFY ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL THAT WE WANT TO BUILD AS A CITY AND THEN OVER TIME WE STRUCTURED IT INTO A MATRIX AND A PLAN TO HELP EXPEDITE THAT IMPLEMENTATION AND I DON'T SEE THIS AS ANY DIFFERENT. I SEE IT AS A VITAL PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE, ONE THAT RESPONDS TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMCOMMUNITY NEED. I THINK ALSO, YOU KNOW, AS A CITY, WE'RE VERY DEPENDENT ON PROPERTY TAXES, AND THIS MEANS THAT OUR FINDINGS IS -- ARE EQUALLY DEPENDENT ON THE ECONOMY. AND BETWEEN NOW AND 2030, THERE WILL BE MANY CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMIC SITUATION. AND TO CONTINUE THE WORLD WAR II METAPHOR, EISENHOWER HAD A GREAT QUOTE ABOUT HOW PLANS ARE USELESS BUT PLANNING IS EVERYTHING. AND IF WE YOU KNOW, IF WE BUILD, YOU KNOW, A BELT AROUND OURSELVES ABOUT HOW EXACTLY WE NEED TO FINANCE THINGS ROLLED INTO THIS PLAN, WE RUN INTO THE RISK OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS. IT'S A LOT CLEARER THAN THE SCIENCE THAT PREDICTS OUR ECONOMY IN TEN YEARS. WE KNOW HOW TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRAL. HOW WE FUND IT IN THE NEXT SIX YEARS OR TEN YEARS IS OPEN TO MORE INFORMATION THAT WE WILL NEED. IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE APPROACH WON'T BE STRATEGIC. WE KNOW WHAT FINANCIAL TOOLS ARE AT OUR DISPOSAL AND I THINK THE FINANCIAL STAFF HAS THE ABILITY TO APPLY PRACTICAL STRATEGIES TO APPROACH THESE PLANS AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THIS WON'T BE OVERSIGHT. EVERY TOOL WE COULD POSSIBLY IMPLEMENT WILL BE SUBJECT TO COUNCIL SCRUTINY AND APPROVAL AND I'M CONFIDENT THIS COUNCIL WITH THIS BUDGET AND FUTURE COUNCILS AS WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IS AND WHAT FINANCIAL TOOLS WE WANT TO WIELD IN RESPONSE TO IT. I TRUST THEIR ABILITIES, OUR FUTURE COUNCIL'S ABILITIES TO SERVE THEIR CONSTITUENTS BASED ON THE FACTS OF THE GROUND AT THE TIME. I THINK IT DELAYS THINGS WITHOUT NEED AND WE HAVE A TON OF DETAIL ALREADY AND NOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE ACTION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:18:19.501: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WILL BE BRIEF AGAIN. I WILL SUPPORT THIS. TO THE THIS IS -- I DON'T THINK THIS IS A CHALLENGING REQUEST FOR SOMEONE OF OUR STAFF'S ABILITY. WE'RE ASKING FOR A TOTAL FUNDING REQUIREMENT THAT MIGHT INCLUDE MANAGEMENT RESERVES AND WE'RE ASKING TO IDENTIFY THE COURSES OF THE FUNDING. IF WE HAVE A TEN-YEAR PLAN TO REDUCE OUR CARBON TO ZERO THEN WE NEED A TEN-YEAR PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN TO ACCOMPANY IT, AND THOSE ALWAYS IDENTIFY FUNDING EACH STEP OF THE WAY. IT'S JUST THAT SIM  SIMPLE TO MA FORMER PROJECT MANAGER. IT'S NOT A BIG ASK AND I DON'T SEE IT DELAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE NECESSARY POLITICAL DELAYS, THE POLITICAL HAY THAT'S TRIED TO BE MADE OUT OF THIS. WHAT IT IS SHOWING IS THAT LET NO EMERGENCY GO UNWASTED TO TRY TO CONSOLIDATE YOUR POLITICAL STANCE IN THIS TOWN. THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR $500 MILLION BUDGET ARE ASKING FOR A PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS, YOU KNOW, ALMOST THAT AMOUNT AGAIN OVER TEN YEARS IS -- IS NOT AN OUTRAGEOUS REQUEST IN ANY -- BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. I THINK IT'S FULLY WORTHY OF OUR SUPPORT AND I THINK THE PLAN WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH IT. THANK YOU.
03:19:51.526: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:19:59.134: >> Councilmember Smith: YOU KNOW, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT. MY COLLEAGUES CAN THROW AROUND TERMS LIKE POLITICAL HAY AND MAKING CRISIS. I'M NOT RUNNING FOR ANYTHING. I DON'T CARE. WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS GETTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REALLY TREMENDOUSLY COMPLEX THING. IT'S PERHAPS THE MOST COMPLEX THING THAT THE CITY TRIED TO TACKLE. WE CAME UP WITH AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN IN 80-SOME DAYS, AND IT IS NOT A STANDARD PROJECT, YOU KNOW, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE. CERTAINLY WE DIDN'T START OUT WITH A PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR WORLD WAR II. THESE CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO CHANGE RAPIDLY. THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF OTHER ACTORS THAT WE DON'T CONTROL. THEY ARE GOING TO BE INFLUENCED BY DECISIONS THAT OTHER MAKE. WE HAVE TO REACT TO THAT. I THINK ADOPTING THIS RIGHT NOW SETS OUR COMPAT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WELWILL WE ADAPT AS THINGS CHAN? YEP. ARE THERE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS? I CERTAINLY EXPECT THERE WILL. CERTAINLY AS OTHER PLACES BEGIN TO FEEL THE CRISIS AND REALIZE HOW ACUTE IT IS. I WOULD IMAGINE IT WILL CHANGE FUNDING VERY DRAMATICALLY ACROSS THE BOARD. I THINK WE ADOPT THIS AND WE MOVE FORWARD WHEN WE NEED TO FIVE PIVOT TO DIFFERENT SOURCESR FUNDING AND WE WILL PIVOT. I THINK FUTURE COUNCILS ARE PERFECTLY ABLE TO MAKE VALUE DECISIONS ABOUT IS REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES BY THIS AMOUNT WORTH THIS MUCH MONEY THAT IS THEIR JOB. THAT'S OUR JOB. I WON'T SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. I'M DISAPPOINTING. RECEIVING REPORTS IS WHERE REPORTS GO TO DIE IN THIS CITY. I'M VERY BUMMED OUT BY THIS. THAT'S OKAY. WE ALL ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE BY OUR CONSTITUENTS AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT. SO I CEDE MY TIME.
03:22:16.605: >> Mayor Taylor: IF I CAN -- IT STRIKES ME THAT I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE MIDDLE GROUND HERE. I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE MIDDLE GROUND INTO ADOPTING THE PLAN, AND ASKING FOR THE FUNDING PLAN ON A -- A FUNDING PLAN BY SOURCE AND YEAR. I THINK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE RESOLVE THAT THEY DEVELOP A FUNDING PLAN BY SOURCE AND YEAR, AND DEVELOP THE FRAMEWORK OR MECHANISM FOR COUNCIL TO UTILIZE AND EVALUATE HIGH LEVERAGE ACTIONS, I THINK THAT THAT RESOLVE CLAUSE CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE EXISTING RESOLUTION LANGUAGE QUITE NEATLY. I THINK THE PLAN IS MEANT TO BE THE ITERATIVE AND IN REFERENCE TO THE FUNDING PLAN, IN THE RESOLVE CLAUSE WOULD MAKE -- IT WOULD MAKE SENSE. THE PROBLEM WITH THE AMENDMENT AS IT IS OFFERED IS JUST AS COUNCILMEMBER SMITH INDICATES, THAT IT SHIFTS US FROM ADOPTING THE PLAN TO RECEIVING THE PLAN AND WE AS A -- PERHAPS NOT WE AS THIS GROUP BUT COUNCILS BEFORE HAVE RECEIVED PLANS. I THINK THIS GROUP HAS RECEIVED PLANS, PERHAPS IF I RECOLLECT CORRECTLY AND THAT'S NOT A RECIPE FOR PROGRESS BUT THAT'S A RECIPE FOR STATUS QUO. ADOPTION OF A PLAN IS DIFFERENT THAN THE RECEIPT OF A PLAN. I GUESS AS I THINK WE PERHAPPED LOOKED TO STAFF TO TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DISTINCTION. THE EXTENT TO WHICH HAVING AN ADOPTED PLAN I IMPROVES OUR SCORING IN GRANT APPLICATIONS AND READIES US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SHOVEL READY PROJECTS IN THE EVENT OF A STIMULUS, HAVING A PLAN IN M PLACE HAS A BENEFITN AND OF ITSELF. I DON'T THINK THERE IS APRIL OBJECTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FUNDING PLAN. I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN OBJECTION TO THE PRIORITIZATION OF A TABLE OF SOME KIND. BUT FOR MY PART, THE FAILURE TO ADOPT THE PLAN IS THE KEY STICKING POINT. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:24:55.230: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
03:25:02.337: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO SURPRISE. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH SOME OF MY LEAGUES REPRESENTATIONS. WE ASKED FOR A PLAN TO COME BACK. IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO ADOPT. WE RECEIVE IT. ITS A LIVING DOCUMENT. THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WE ADOPT A PLAN THAT WE ALREADY -- MOST OF US ADMIT HAS SOME FALLACIES IN IT. WE ARE WASTING PRECIOUS TIME AND PRECIOUS RESOURCES GOING DOWN THE WRONG PATH. AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN AND CAUSE FOR PAUSE. WE ISSUED -- WE ALL IN AN 11-0 VOTE, DECLARED IT A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THAT'S OUR PLAN. WE ARE NOT BACKING AWAY FROM THAT. BUT TO TELL US THAT WE HAVE TO ADOPT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN PAHASTILY PUT TOGETHER, I'M SORY THIS TYPE OF PLAN TAKES MORE TIME THAN STAFF DID. THEY WERE GENIUSES IN WHAT THEY DO, BUT WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY AS POLITICAL LEADEERS AND THIS IS NOT ONLY THING THAT WE WILL BE TACKLING. I WILL NOT BANKRUPT MY CITY ADOPTING A PLAN THAT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY THOUGHT OUT. THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY, THAT IT KEEPS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. SO I'M SORRY. WORLD WAR II WAS THE NATION'S RESPONSE, IT'S NOT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S RESPONSE TO HITLER. IT WAS A NATION'S RESPONSE. UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T HAVE A FULL NATION RESPONDING IN THE WAY THAT THEY RESPONDED TO PEARL HARBOR, BUT TO USE THAT ANALOGY IS A FALLACY. I HEARD MY COLLEAGUES NOW, WHO ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THIS ASTACKING MEMBERS WHO WANT TO SEE -- ATTACKING MEMBERS WOULD WANT TO SEE A FUNDING SOURCE. BUT FOR THE FIRST YEAR ON COUNCIL, WE COULDN'T GET ANYTHING DONE UNLESS WE IDENTIFIED A FUNDING SOURCE. BUT NOW IT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK! SO, YOU KNOW, PLEASE WITH ALL THE PERSONAL ATTACKS, IT DOESN'T GET OUR COMMUNITY ANYWHERE. LET'S STEC'S STICK TO THE FACT,I DON'T WANT TO BANKRUPT MY CITY GOING DOWN THE WRONG PATH. ATTACK ME FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU WANT TO, BUT I WILL NOT SEND MY CITY DOWN THE TUBES. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:28:05.920: >> Councilmember Lumm: I TALKED A BUNCH OF TIMES. I PROBABLY INTEREST SHOULDN'T. PROBABLY SHOULDN'T. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK CONGRESS MEMBER RAMLAWI FOR HIS STRAIGHT TALK AND INTELLECTUALLY HONEST, THANK YOU. WE ARE ASKING FOR DEVELOPING A FUNDING PLAN AND THE ARGUMENT IS MADE THAT THIS IS YET TO DO. AND SO GO AHEAD, JUST, YOU KNOW, ADOPT THIS, MONUMENTAL PLAN. WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL BE FUNDED. THERE'S NO FUNDING PLAN BUT WE'RE GOOD TO GO AND IT'S -- IN ALL DUE RESPECT, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, IT'S NOT HIKE  LIKE T. THERE'S IMPLEMENTAL PLAN AND THERE'S NO PRIORITIZATION AND THAT'S WHY I'M REQUESTING IT WITH THIS AMENDMENT. THE CIP, IT'S AN INCREMENTAL PLAN, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE YEARS IDENTIFIED FOR WHEN THESE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN. IT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A WISH LIFT LIST BECAUSE THINGS HAVE BN THERE FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY ARE NOT UNDERTAKEN FOR VARIOUS REASONS BUT THEY ARE NEVER UNDERTAKEN UNTIL A FUNDING SOURCE IS IDENTIFIED AND EVERYTHING IN THAT PLAN HAS AN IDENTIFIED FUNDING COURSE. WE CAN'T MAKE ANY BUDGET AMENDMENTS WITHOUT ODDING A FUNDING SOURCE -- IDENTIFYING A FUNDING SOURCE. WE KNOW THAT DRILL. THINK ABOUT THIS IF IT IS OUR OWN MONEY. IT IS OUR CITIZENS' MONEY. WOULD YOU EXPECT A FUNDING PLAN. WE SHOULD PROVIDE THAT. IT'S REQUIRED. THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN ADOPTING THIS AND, NO, MR. MAYER,  MAYOR, WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING IS A MIDDLE GROUND. IT CHANGES NOTHING IN TERMS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ORIGINAL, YOU KNOW RESOLUTION. YOU DID THROW IN ONE OF MY RESOLVES I THINK MAYBE TO PLACATE ME, BUT IT'S LIKE PATTING ME ON THE HEAD. IT DIDN'T CHANGE IT IN TERMS OF THE SUBSTANCE. AND HENCE WHY HAVE THESE AMENDMENTS IN FRONT OF US. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
03:30:38.706: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:30:39.774: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK JANE AND ALI FOR THEIR CANDID DISCUSSION ON THIS AND I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO THE AMENDMENT. I WOULD SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT FOR PULLING TOGETHER OUR FUNDING PLAN AND THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK. I'M 100% BEHIND THE GOAL LIKE I THINK EVERYONE HERE IS, BUT THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PANDEMIC. I THINK ALI WAS RIGHT IN THAT THIS PLAN HAS BECOME OUTDATED ALREADY. I APPRECIATED WHAT TOM CRAWFORD AND NEEL FROM THE COMMUNICATE FOUND -- COMMUNITY FOUNDATION SAYING THAT THE RECOVERY FROM THE PAN DEM IS A MARATHON AND NOT A SPRINT. I WOULD LIKE TO RECONNECT AND BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE FUNDING PLAN AND THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE PLAN FOR CLIMATE ACTION. SO LIKE, WHEN I HAVE -- WHEN I HAVE BEEN OUT TALKING TO MAYBES JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT AFFORDABILITY IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT. THEY ARE WORRIED -- THEY ARE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THEIR SUMMER TAXES AND IF THE CITY COULD CUT THOSE IN HALF. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE PERSONAL FINANCES AND THE WATER RATES AND THE SIDEWALKS. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT LOCAL BUSINESS EVEN STAYING IN BUSINESS. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT SEWER OVERFLOWS, LEAKY BASEMENTS AND THE STORMWATER CRISIS AND, YOU THOUGH, ESPECIALLY IN JULY WHEN WE'LL GET HEAVY DOWNPOURS. THE PLUME, OF COURSE, HOW MUCH MONEY WE WILL NEED FOR THE DIOXANE PLUME AND THEY ARE TALKING MORE ABOUT COMMUNITY GARDENS AND PROTECTING OUR TREES AND SUPPORTING FOOD GATHERS FOR ALL THE GOOD WORK THEY DO IN THE COMMUNITY, FOR -- TO DECREASE METHANE GAS WHICH IS ACTUALLY, WE HAVE LEARNED IS WORSE THAN ASHON EMISSIONS. SO, AGAIN, I'M 100% BEHIND THE GOAL, AS WE ALL ARE, BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON THE FUNDING PLAN THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK. I'M HOPING THAT AAATA AND UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WOULD BE WILLING TO BUY A BUNCH OF EV BUSES AND WE DO KNOW THAT U OF M IS TAKING MORE TIME IN THE CITY TO DEVELOP THEIR PLAN WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A LITTLE TELLING. THANK YOU.
03:33:27.809: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD.
03:33:28.943: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, LET ME JUST GIVE MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS, IF I COULD. AT THE RISK OF MAYBE MAKING THIS GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, BUT FROM MY VIEW, THE PERFECT PLAN IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL NEVER GET, AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE COUNCIL TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WAITING FOR THE PLAN THAT YOU ALL AGREE TO. THAT JUST COMES FROM EXPERIENCE WITH WORKING WITH COUNCIL OVER SOME TIME. AND I WOULD L LEND SOME CREDENCE TO THE CONVERSATION AROUND THE FINANCING OF THE PLAN AS PART OF AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A PLAN. IT IS I RECOGNIZE WHETHER IT'S ADOPTED OR RECEIVED, SETTING THE DIRECTION FOR STAFF THAT YOU WANT TO GO IS HELPFUL, AND I THINK COUNCIL HAS MADE SOME GOOD POINTS THAT THE CORONAVIRUS HAS REALLY CHANGED THE SITUATION BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A MASTER PLAN LIKE THIS, FROM MY PERCEPTION, THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY CHANGE THE DIRECTION THAT YOU ARE GOING. IT CHANGES WHEN AND HOW. AND STAFF NEEDS TO RESPOND TO YOUR DESIRES TO NAVIGATE THAT TACTICALLY. SO I JUST WANTED TO OFFER THOSE COMMENTS.
03:35:00.768: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU FOR THE LIVELY DEBATE, EVERYONE. WITH RESPECT TO THE C.IP, JUST TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THINGS DIRECTLY, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE CITY HAS EITHER BUILT OR ANNEXED 300 MILES OF ROADWAYS, WE KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE CAPITAL GAINS. AND THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, DEVELOPED OUT OF THAT. SIMILARLY, AS WE INCREASE THE INVESTMENT IN GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE, SO TOO WILL CITY HAVE LESSONS LEARN AND APPLY METHODS LIKE THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, PRIORITIZATION METRIC, AND IDENTIFYING FUNDING SOURCES BUT IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN, THERE'S A NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS. BUT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, IT'S AN ANALOGY BUT JUST TO BE REALLY CLEAR, WE HAVE NO CONSTITUTIONAL ABILITY TO DECLARE WAR ON A FOREIGN STATE. WE DO HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ABILITY TO DO WHAT WE CAN WHEN WE CAN TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST AN IMPENDING CRISIS AND WE SHOULD, BECAUSE WE CAN. AND IF WE DON'T, IT'S GOING TO HURT FUTURE GENERATIONS, LIFE OR DEATH TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. AND ALSO, I'M NOT -- YOU KNOW YORK, IDON'T WANT TO READ TOO MO INTENT. AND FALLACY IS A NEGATIVE WORD. IF YOU ARE GOING TO ACCUSE DR. STULTS' WORK OF BEING RELIANT UPON FALLACIES THAT'S GENERALLY AN SATEL INSULTING TH, PLEASE BE VERY SPECIFIC SO WE CAN GET RESPONSES BACK FROM PROFESSIONALS WHO KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS. THEN, I WILL -- OH, I'M SORRY. THIS WAS ALSO A COMMENT ABOUT BANKRUPTCY, ABOUT THREE TO FIVE TIMES, THE WORD BANKRUPTCIES WAS USED. MR. CRAWFORD, WOULD YOU MIND TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MEANS THROUGH WHICH YOU WOULD AVOID BANKRUPTING THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. THAT FELT OVER THE TOP TO ME AND I TRUST YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T BANKRUPT OURSELVES.
03:37:13.601: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, WHAT I CAN SAY IS STAFF COMES BACK TO YOU WITH A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE PLAN FOR THE BUDGET AND THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION, IT INCORPORATES MUCH OF WHAT DR. STULTSS ASKED FOR. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A LOT OF FUNDS. I THINK IT WAS $27 MILLION THAT PRESUMABLY COULD COME FROM OTHER AREAS, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS BEING OUTDATED. WE HAD AN EVENT HAPPENED THAT CHANGES THINGS. THAT COULD HAPPEN. THAT CAN CHANGE AGAIN BEFORE THE YEAR IS OUT OR EVEN NEXT YEAR. THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FINANCES IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO THAT I SERIOUSLY, AND WE WILL NOT BRING YOU A RECOMMENDATION THAT JEOPARDIZEFINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE CITY. ZACK ZA>> Councilmember Ackerma THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
03:38:12.960: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:38:13.894: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I DO SUPPORT WHAT THE MAYOR WAS TRYING TO DO. I DON'T THINK IT WAS TRYING TO PLACATE. I THINK IT WAS TRYING TO COMPROMISE, WHICH MANY OF US STRIVE FOR. SO I THINK IT GIVES US THE CHA ON TO GET BEHIND A PLAN AND ALSO IF WE WANT MORE NUMBERS, THEN WE CAN ASK FOR THOSE. I COULD DEFINITELY SUPPORT THAT, WHILE I DON'T LIKE THAT. I THINK IT'S FAIR. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE ALSO CAN LOOK TO THE -- [  NO AUDIO ] AND WE ARE FIGURING IT OUT AS WE GO. THERE'S A CRISIS AND SO WE GIVE OUT SOME MONEY. WE HAD A GREAT PRESENTATION, BOTH AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR MEETING ABOUT WHAT LOCAL NOT FOR PROFITS, STATE GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, CITY GOVERNMENT IS DOING TOGETHER, COUNTY GOVERNMENT, TO BE RESPONSIVE TO A NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. SO I DON'T -- I THINK WE CAN HAVE A PLAN THAT IS A VISION AND FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE FUNDING AS WE GO AND IF WE WANT MORE EFFECT SYMPATHIES WE CAN ASK -- MORE SPECIFICS, WE CAN ASK FOR THEM, BUT I THINK WE SAW FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF WORTH OF PRESENTATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR MEETING EXACTLY HOW OUR COMMUNITY IS BEING NIMBLE IN RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS, AND HOW WE SEE EVERYDAY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEIR NEW FUNDING PACKAGES COMING OUT. EVERY FEW DAYS. AND FROM THE STATE. BUT TO QUESTION ALSO HAD A SOME OF US DON'T TAKE OUR FIDUCIARY DUTY TO THE CITY, YOU KNOW, AS A KEY RESPONSIBILITY OR THAT WE ARE SOMEHOW INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST, I THINK WE CAN TALK ABOUT CORE DEMOCRATIC VALUES AT THIS TABLE SINCE WE ARE ALL DEMOCRATS AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THEM. I THINK IT'S -- YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO STOP NAME CALLING BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE IN THIS WORK AND I BELIEVE IN ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE ASKED US TO COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND IT'S DISAPPOINTING IT LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT NOT.
03:40:35.603: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:40:45.112: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, SORRY. THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED NO ASK TOM CRAWFORD TO ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT -- ABOUT THE FUNDING PLAN AND HOW THAT FITS IN WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE -- THAT SOME OF THE RESIDENTS CONSIDER CLIMATE ACTION, LIKE SEWER OVERFLOWS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND ATLANTCLEAN WATER AND THE PLUME. YOUR COMMENT WAS SHORT. I WASN'T SURE THAT YOU GOT EVERYTHING OUT THAT WOULD MAKE THE POINT THAT YOU WERE MAKING WILL.
03:41:28.589: >> City Admin. Crawford: I SHARE THE OBSERVATION THAT THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX AND VERY LARGE PLAN AND IT'S NOT LIKE WHAT YOU TYPICAL DEAL WITH WITH THE CITY BUDGET. WE GET SOURCES OF REVENUE IN WITH DIFFERENT PURPOSES FOR THOSE FUNDS. THIS IS ONE THAT IS AS MUCH MORE OR OUTWARD FACING AS INWARD FACING. WE HAVE A ROLE AND DR. STULTS DESCRIBED AT THE WORK SESSION TO YOU HOW WE ARE A REGULATOR IN SOME PLACE AND INFLUENCE AND A DECIDER. THAT IS MORE PREVALENT HERE THAN IN OTHER GOALS YOU HAVE. I THINK DEVELOPING A PLAN WE CAN DO, IT WILL CHANGE AS QUICKLY AS THE FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGES, WHICH IS ALL THE TIME. BUT IS IT RESPONSIBLE TO HAVE A PLAN? ABSOLUTELY. WE WOULD BE DOING THAT ANY WAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ADDRESSING WHAT YOU WERE GETTING AT BUT I DO THINK THIS IS A VERY LARGE PLAN AND IT BEHINDS ITSELF TO TAKING CHUNKED OF IT AND SOLVING THAT PROBLEM. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THIS PLAN CAN GET EXECUTED IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC WAY. IN OTHER WORDS YOU PLAN, AND WHEN YOU HAVE UNEXPECTED FUNDING THAT ARRIVES, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GO AND YOU CAN EXECUTE FAST. YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEE HOW A PLAN LIKE THIS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED.
03:43:08.489: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:43:10.290: >> Councilmember Bannister: YEAH. NO, THAT WAS A GOOD EXPLANATION. AND I THINK MAYBE SOME OF THE RESIDENTS ARE WORRIED THAT THERE'S THAT THIS IS WILL UNLEASH SOME OF THE POLITICAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT WE NEED A LOT MORE DENSITY AND SO I'M -- THERE'S JUST SOME CONCERNS THERE ABOUT THAT OR -- OR SOME OF THE OTHER ASSUMPTIONS. THERE WERE LITTLE UNDERTONED ABOUT THE PLANS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED AS CLIMATE ACTION BY ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS.
03:44:00.207: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:44:01.842: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS TO MR. CRAWFORD FOLLOWING ON WITH COU COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTES QUESTIONS. I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS CLEAR TO BE ASKED IN TERMS OF A FUNDING PLAN, BUT THERE IS SO MUCH -- IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CITY AND THE TAXPAYERS AND JUST TAKE THE SECOND EXAMPLE, ALL THE APPLIANCES AND VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ABOUT $6 MILLION, JUST UNDER $6 MILLION TO CONVERT ALL CITY FACILITIES. WE'RE SAYING WITH THIS PLAN, THAT WE WANT TO ADOPT ELECTRIFY THE CITY FLEET BY 2025. 90% OF THE FLEET COULD BE TRANSITIONED. AND THOSE REPLACEMENT RATES AND COSTS WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE BUDGET. THAT'S ESTIMATED AT $4 MILLION. AGAIN, WE HAVE THE COMPOSTING PROGRAM. AND THAT'S A $26 M $26 MILLION T OVER TEN YEARS. THAT AND REDUCES IT BY .3 OF A PERCENT. AND THE COST IS 25 LDZ MANY TO DO THAT. ON AND ON. AGAIN, ALL OF THESE STRATEGIES HAVE A COST ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, AND IT SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT THIS IS MORE ABOUT THE EXTERNAL COSTS, BUT THERE ARE MANY COSTS, THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH OUR CITY TAXPAYERS WOULD BEAR, AND WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING -- WE'RE DEALING WITH SOME PUSHBACK BUT THERE'S DIFFICULTY COMING UP WITH A FINANCING PLAN AND I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO DO, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT.
03:46:01.762: >> City Admin. Crawford: MY POINT WAS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPROVE PORTIONS OF THE PLAN. IF WE COME UP WITH A FINANCE PLAN, YOU KNOW THAT MAY CHANGE BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE AT THE TIME THAT IT'S READY TO MOVE.
03:46:21.882: >> Councilmember Lumm: YOU MENTION AN INCREMENTAL PLAN, AND WE DON'T HAVE ONE. THAT'S WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR THE PRIORITIZATION. TODAY, THE INCREMENTAL PLAN DOESN'T EXIST. SO THAT'S WHY PROPOSE ONE OF THESE AMENDMENTS AS WELL.
03:46:42.936: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE'S BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S NO PLAN WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WE WOULD DO IN THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM TO BEGIN TO EFFECT THE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS IN THE PLAN. IS THAT TRUE? I GUESS DR. STO STULTS IS THE BT TO ADDRESS THAT. DON'T WE HAVE A PLAN IN OSI?
03:47:23.477: >> SORRY, I WAS WORKING ON THE PRPRIORITIZATION. WE HAVE THE CAP CAPACITY WE CANE FORWARD AND THE BUDGET ASK AND WE PUT TOGETHER ADDITIONAL REQUESTS AND I BELIEVE I WAS PULLING THIS UP, WE TYPED THIS UP IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WHERE WE OUTLINED EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE PROPOSING TO DO WITH BUDGET REQUESTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR AND I'M HAPPY TO REFORWARD THAT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS IT. JUST SINCE I HAVE THE FLOOR QUICKLY.
03:47:53.974: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
03:47:55.409: >> THERE'S A PUSHBACK ON ANY OF THESE THINGS. THE FUNDING WORK WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE ALREADY STARTING TO DEVELOP WITH MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES. I THINK THAT'S A PHENOMENAL. ANY PUSHBACK YOU HAVE IS MORE CLARITY SO WE CAN DELIVER WHAT THE COUNCIL NEEDS SO IT'S USEFUL AND THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO ILLUCIDATE MY RESPONSE AND TALK AND UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST. SO YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT AND DON'T FEEL THAT FRUSTRATION.
03:48:30.944: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:48:32.813: >> Councilmember Eaton: MAY I SUGGEST THAT WE VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT.
03:48:35.115: >> Mayor Taylor: ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:48:44.024: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO THIS IS --
03:48:46.059: >> Clerk Beaudry: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:48:47.160: >> Mayor Taylor: THIS IS A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT.
03:48:50.897: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  ON ALL THREE?
03:48:53.400: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES, THIS IS THE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:48:56.870: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM TO REMOVE THE EXISTING RESOLVE CLAUSES, TO RECEIVE THE PLAN RATHER THAN ADOPT THE PLAN, TO REQUEST THE FUNDING PLAN PRIORITIZATION.
03:49:11.051: >> Councilmember Eaton: I'M READY NOW. THANK YOU.
03:49:12.352: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY. I KNOW I ALREADY SPOKE TWICE, BUT THERE WAS A LONG DELIBERATION, I HAVE TO ASK OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, BECAUSE HAS CONCERNS OF THE DIRECTION THAT WE ARE GIVING STAFF. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TIME FRAME IS TO GET IN THIS PLAN SO WE CAN CONTINUE MOMENTUM FORWARD.
03:49:34.608: >> City Admin. Crawford: I DON'T REALLY HAVE CONCERNS WITH IT. I WILL -- I WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT WITH DR. STULTS ON THAT. I DON'T HAVE A TIME FRAME FOR YOU TONIGHT.
03:49:42.849: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  BUT IT DOESN'T IMPEDE OUR PROGRESS AS WE GO FORWARD? WE ARE NOT SHIFTING DIRECTIONS HERE.
03:50:03.403: >> City Admin. Crawford: NO, IT'S A MATTER OF PRIORITIES.
03:50:06.573: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE ARE NOT SLOW THINGS DOWN OR CHANGING DIRECTIONS.
03:50:10.477: >> City Admin. Crawford: I DON'T THINK SO. DR. STULTS, DO YOU THINK SO?
03:50:13.680: >> I DO THINK THAT IT'S WORK FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF, WE WILL HAVE TO PULL PEOPLE OFF OF OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, OF COURSE BUT I JUST WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT. SOME THINGS WE ARE WORKING ON WILL NOT MOVE AS FAST, BUT THAT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.
03:50:27.727: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU.
03:50:40.373: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, ARE YOU READY FOR THE ROLL CALL?
03:50:42.275: >> Mayor Taylor: I AM. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:50:49.116: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:50:49.716: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:50:54.254: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:50:54.855: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
03:50:57.958: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:51:00.694: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:51:03.497: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:51:09.336: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:51:10.170: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
03:51:10.770: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
03:51:16.610: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
03:51:17.077: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:51:18.478: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:51:30.790: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE. I SENT AN EMAIL TO MS. BEAUDRY EARLIER, AND THAT IS, ASKING FOR -- INSTEAD OF AT LEAST AN ANNUAL UPDATE TO CITY COUNCIL ON PROGRESS, I'M ASKING FOR A QUARTERLY UPDATE TO CITY COUNCIL ON PROGRESS.
03:51:56.750: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THIS A SECOND.
03:51:58.485: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD SECOND THAT.
03:51:59.786: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:52:04.324: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AS WE SAID A FEW TIMES ALREADY, IT'S A FLUID SITUATION. OUR FINANCES ARE FLUID. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS CURRENT PLAN WILL SHIFT AND MOVE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET MORE FREQUENT REPORTS TO CITY COUNCIL SO WE CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN TERMS THAT ARE NOT AS LONG AS ONE YEAR. IT'S JUST -- WE ONLY HAVE TEN YEARS TO GET TO THE CARBON NEUTRALITY IF WE ARE GOING TO GET TO OUR GOAL THAT'S ONLY TEN REPORTS, I DON'T THINK IT'S SUFFICIENT ENOUGH. IF IT DOESN'T OVERDO OR OVERBURDEN, IT DOESN'T CREATE TOO MUCH WORK FOR STAFF, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT TO COUNCIL ON OUR -- ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS TIME TO BURN BACK A LI -- YOU SL PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT. I DID POINT OUT FALLACY, IT'S A MISTAKEN BELIEF, ESPECIALLY ON UNSOUND ARGUE. I'M NOT CALLING ANYBODY ANYTHING ELSE. I WILL STAND BY THE NOTION THAT THERE'S SOME FALLACIES IN THIS PLAN, ONE THAT I'M SURE WILL GET WORKED OUT WITH TIME.
03:53:29.109: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:53:31.077: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD CONSIDER JUST AMENDING THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE BECAUSE I THINK -- I SUPPORT WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THAT -- I THINK YOU JUST ASKED TO REPLACE THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE.
03:53:47.260: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WAS IT THE LAST, I THOUGHT? THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE. INSTEAD OF ANNUAL UPDATES AT LEAST ANNUALLY.
03:53:56.403: >> Councilmember Lumm: OH, OKAY. I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT -- IT'S A DIFFERENT RESOLVE CLAUSE.
03:54:00.407: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY.
03:54:02.142: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S OKAY.
03:54:03.510: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, IF I MAY, I ACTUALLY HAD THE SAME QUESTION. I THOUGHT THE LAST AMENDMENT REPLACED ALL FOUR RESOLVE WITH JUST THREE. SO I DON'T THINK -- I DON'T THINK THAT RESOLVE CLAUSE THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO AMEND IS IN THE RESOLUTION ANYMORE.
03:54:20.727: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S NOT.
03:54:24.564: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, UM --
03:54:27.867: >> Councilmember Lumm: BECAUSE I REPLACED THE FOUR EXISTING WITH THESE THREE. IT'S A DIFFERENT ONE, I'M SORRY. IT'S A NEW ONE, I GUESS. SO WE WILL ADD IT BACK IN.
03:54:39.846: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IT BACK IN IF IT'S POSSIBLE.
03:54:48.188: >> Mayor Taylor: SO YOUR RESOLUTION IS TO ADD YOUR PROPOSED RESOLVE CLAUSE AS A FOURTH RESOLVE CLAUSE?
03:54:56.463: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THERE WAS -- INITIALLY THERE WAS FOUR.
03:55:05.905: >> Mayor Taylor: IT HAD BEEN MOVED. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, I ASSUME YOU WISH TO SECOND IT?
03:55:12.112: >> Councilmember Lumm: WOULD YOU READ IT? SORRY.
03:55:15.281: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I THINK YOU HAVE THE FLOOR STILL.
03:55:17.917: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF SOMEONE COULD READ THE RESOLVE CLAUSE THAT WE ARE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON.
03:55:24.190: >> Mayor Taylor: RESOLVED. THAT THEY BEGIN OR CONTINUE TO WORK TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE PLAN AND PROVIDE AT LEAST QUARTERLY REPORTS TO CITY COUNCIL ON PROGRESS.
03:55:34.467: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. I --
03:55:36.703: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT CORRECT?
03:55:37.871: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THAT IS CORRECT.
03:55:40.774: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
03:55:43.877: >> Councilmember Lumm: IOLOGYIZE I SUPPORT THE INTENT. I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS ONE. THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE I REPLACED IT WITH SAYS WE RECEIVED THE REPORT. THIS SAYS IMPLEMENT IT. SO THIS RUNS COUNTER TO THE INTENT OF MY REPLACEMENT AMENDMENT. I AM NOT COMFORTABLE DIRECTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO ADOPT OR IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AND ALL THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE PLAN, WITHOUT A FUNDING PLAN AND A FRAMEWORK OR MECHANISM FOR PRIORITIZING ACTIONS IN THE PLAN.
03:56:20.480: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I THINK AT THIS POINT, BASED ON THE ARE -- WHAT WAS LAST VOTED ON, I WILL RESCIND THIS. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. I FIGURED I JUST HAD IT IN QUEUE AND I DIDN'T REALIZE, THE IMPLICATIONS.
03:56:42.569: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE RESCINDING?
03:56:55.849: >> NO.
03:56:56.082: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I DO LET'S VOTE TO IT.
03:57:02.355: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. AMENDMENT? I GUESS I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, YOU ARE NEXT? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, YOU ARE MUTED.
03:57:19.772: >> Councilmember Grand: I'M GOOD VOTING.
03:57:22.742: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: LET'S IMPLEMENT THIS MAN, AND IT'S HAS A PLAN FOR THE MOMENT EXISTENTIAL CRISIS.
03:57:38.925: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON. ARE WE VOTING ON ADDING THIS AS A FOURTH RESOLVE CLAUSE? WE NEED TO CORRECT THE GRAMMAR OF IT.
03:57:47.433: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE VOTING ON IT AS A FOURTH RESOLVE CLAUSE. I BELIEVE THAT IN MY RECITATION, I CREATED A TYPO OR TWO.
03:57:56.309: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THERE WAS A TYPO.
03:58:00.547: >> Mayor Taylor: HE AFFIRMED IT. THE AMENDMENT AS PROPOSED AND EVERYBODY PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I MISS. RESOLVED, ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL REQUESTS THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR BEGIN OR CONTINUE WORK TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE PLAN, AND PROVIDE AT LEAST QUARTERLY UPDATES TO THE CITY COUNCIL ON PROGRESS.
03:58:23.570: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, MY QUESTION WOULD GO TO COUNCILWOMAN LUMM, THAT THE IMPLEMENT OF THIS PLAN WILL NOT HAPPEN UNTIL -- YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST -- IT JUST SEEM LIKE THAT -- THAT YOU ARE -- YOUR RESOLUTIONS KIND OF CHANGE THE DYNAMIC OF THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ASK THAT -- ASK FOR QUARTERLY UPDATES. WE ASK FOR QUARTERLY UPDATES FOR WATER QUALITY. I DON'T KNOW THAT I SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT THE CONSTANT UPDATING IS NECESSARY. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE WERE ALL GOING TO BE INVITED TO MEETINGS ABOUT THIS AND CHANGES THAT WILL BE MADE THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE EFFORT MOVING IN ORDER OR THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO SUPPORT THIS MOVING FORWARD, ARE GOING TO BE ASKED OF US BY OSI, AND SO YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE IT'S COMPLETELY NECESSARY AT THIS POINT. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT TO WITHDRAW IT. I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE DO ADOPT THIS PLAN AND VOTE ON THE PLAN AS A WHOLE WHICH I HOPE TO SHORTLY, THAT THE RECOGNITION IS THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THIS AND IF THE BODY SUPPORTS IT AS A WHOLE, THAT WE NEED TO BE CLOSER TO THIS PROJECT. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON AND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM WITH THIS, COUNCILMAN. BUT I SEE HOW IT IS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF SYNC RIGHT NOW. SO THAT'S FINE. WE CAN VOTE ON IT IF YOU WANT. I'M NOT SURE I SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF SYNC. I'M NOT SURE THAT IT -- YOU KNOW, IT'S HELPFUL AT THIS POINT, BUT,  YOU KNOW, EITHER WY IT FINE WITH ME.
04:00:01.934: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:00:04.170: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M GOOD.
04:00:05.471: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:00:06.339: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S INSISTENCE ON TAKING A VOTE ON THIS, AS I'M HERE THINKING AND LOOKING AND REREADING, I THINK I STILL SUPPORT IT. I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING I SHOULD BE WITHDRAW. IT ASKS TO BEGIN OR TIP WORK TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTIONS OUTLINED. IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT ADOPTION OF ANY KIND OF PLAN. I THINK THIS IS ASKING FOR A PROGRESS REPORT ON WHAT'S BEING DONE, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. I DON'T THINK OUR PRIOR VOTE NEGATED THE VIRTUE OF THIS AMENDMENT. I THINK IT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS OUR PROGRESS.
04:00:56.889: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:00:58.257: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THIS AMENDMENT AND VOTING FOR IT IS A VOTE TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN, A VOTE AGAINST THIS AMENDMENT IS A VOTE NOT TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN.
04:01:08.968: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:01:18.711: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT IS A PRIOR AMENDMENT FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED, IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE ADOPTION. IT ONLY SAYS THAT WE ARE GOING TO ADOPT IT, BRING IT BACK WHEN YOU HAVE A FUNDING PLAN AND WE ARE HAVE PRIORITIZATION PLAN. THIS ON THE OTHER HAND SAYS GO FORTH AND IMPLEMENT IT. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN SAYS VOTE FOR THIS, YOU ARE ADOPTING THE PLAN. SO IT'S A VERY -- ACTUALLY, I THINK THE -- YOU ADD THIS IN -- THAT'S WHY THE THREE RESOLVE CLAUSES I BROUGHT FORWARD -- IT WOULD NOW BE GIVING TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO STAFF, AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE OTHER RESOLVE CLAUSES DO NOT PRECLAUDE ADOPTION. IT'S ONLY SAYING HE WITH WANT -- WE WANT A FUNDING PLAN AND THEN BRING IT BACK. AND AS YOU HEARD FROM MR. CRAWFORD, HE CAN PROVIDE THAT FUNDING PLAN FOR THE PLAN. WE KNOW WHAT IS PROPOSED WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET, BUT WE KNOW THAT WE WILL GET A PLAN B FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THERE ARE A LOT OF UNKNOWNS NOW IN TERMS OF OUR REVENUE STREAM. SO MAYBE FOR THE FIRST YEAR, FOR THE CARBON ZERO PLAN, -- (GARBLED AUDIO).
04:02:54.006: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:02:55.141: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS MR. M POSTEMA ON WITH US?
04:02:59.145: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, I AM. I HAVE -- I WOULD ASK -- I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THIS CONFLICTING RESOLUTION AS OUR -- AS OUR -- I THINK THAT -- I THINK YOU COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS. ARE WE INTRODUCING A CONFLICTING RESOLUTION?
04:03:26.072: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, ULTIMATELY A RESOLUTION IS WHAT THE COUNCIL BELIEVES IT TO BE. SO IN THE END YOU HAVE RECEPTION OF A REPORT. YOU ALSO HAVE IMPLEMENTATION, BUT IN SOME WAYS, IT'S LIMITED BY THE PRIOR RESOLUTION. SO ARE THEY CONFLICTING TERMS? YOU ALL NEED TO DECIDE THAT. I THINK IN THE END, THE RESOLUTION IS GOING TO STAND. YOU ARE GOING TO APPROPRIATE A BUDGET TO DO THINGS. AND SO OTHER THAN THAT GUIDANCE, I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S CONTRADICTORY IN THAT SENSE, BUT I ASK BUT.
04:04:03.276: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I ASK BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO THE QUESTION EARLIER THAT MR. CRAWFORD WAS SUGGESTING, THAT GUIDANCE IS NECESSARY FOR STAFF AND SO ON AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT TO CRAFT LEGISLATION THAT DOESN'T CLOUD THE WATERS, ABOUT WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE MOVING FORWARD.
04:04:23.029: >> City Atty. Postema: AND AGAIN, I CAN'T GIVE MUCH MORE GUIDANCE ON THAT, NUMBER ONE, I'M NOT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND; AND NUMBER TWO, YOU ALL ARE THE COUNCIL. YOU ARE PROVIDING THE DIRECTION AND SO WITH THE RESOLVE CLAUSES. I THINK THERE'S REALLY TWO PARTS THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAS IN HERE. ONE IS A PROCEDURAL, THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A QUARTERLY REPORT. YOU KNOW THAT CERTAINLY COULD STAND ALONE IF PEOPLE WANTED IT. THE OTHER ASPECT, YOU KNOW, IS SOMETHING THAT THE COUNCIL IS GOING TO NEED TO INTERPRET. I CAN'T GIVE MUCH MORE GUIDANCE THAN THAT.
04:05:06.238: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EAT
04:05:17.950: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
04:05:18.551: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
04:05:23.189: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
04:05:23.789: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
04:05:26.659: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
04:05:31.397: >> Councilmember Bannister:
04:05:37.670: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER BANNISTER, YOUR VOTE WAS NOT RECORDED.
04:05:41.774: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
04:05:42.808: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
04:05:49.482: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
04:05:50.049: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
04:05:50.649: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
04:05:53.919: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:05:54.420: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION CARRIES. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED?
04:06:15.174: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:06:16.108: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. POSTEMA. I WILL READ YOU THE RESOLUTION NOW.
04:06:25.551: >> City Atty. Postema: I HAVE IT UP.
04:06:28.954: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO HERE'S HOW THE RESOLEVER CLAUSES READ. RESOLVE THAT THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL RECEIVES THE ANN ARBOR A2ZERO NEUTRALITY PLAN AND EXPRESSES THE APPRECIATION TO CITY STAFF FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE TO COUNCIL'S NOVEMBER 4, 2019 RESOLUTION. DOESN'T ADOPT. IT RECEIVES. THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE, ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL REQUESTS THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR BEGIN OR CONTINUE WORK TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE PLAN AND PROVIDE AT LEAST AN ANNUAL UPDATE TO COUNCIL AND CITY PROGRESS. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? ARE WE RECEIVING IT OR ADOPTING IT?
04:07:13.466: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, YOU ARE RECEIVING THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE RESOLVE CLAUSE SAYS. I GUESS THE -- THE EXACT LANGUAGE AND THAT'S WHY -- AS I SPOKE EARLIER, IT SAYS THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR BEGIN OR CONTINUE WORK. CERTAINLY -- CERTAINLY, THE BEGINNING OF THIS -- BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTIONS, THAT'S VERY PRELIMINARY. AND SO I -- AGAIN, MY GUIDANCE IS THE SAME. I KNOW IT'S -- I KNOW IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SATISFYING TO SOME, BUT AGAIN, I THINK THAT THERE'S -- THE LANGUAGE IS CRAFTED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. IT'S T THE INTENTION THAT HE HAS AND BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT IS NOT SPECIFIC. AND SO THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:08:12.224: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. A QUESTION FOR MR. CRAWFORD THEN. THE PLAN INCLUDES LAND USE ACTIONS. WOULD YOU THEN SEE THIS AS DIRECTION TO IMPLEMENT THE LAND USE ACTIONS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED IN THE PLAN INCLUDING INCREASED DENSITY, AND MIXED USES IN SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS A/K/A, YOU KNOW, DO AWAY WITH SIMPLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONING? THAT IS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS.
04:08:42.621: >> City Admin. Crawford: YEAH. A LOT OF ASPECTS IF NOT ALL OF THEM REQUIRE FURTHER COUNCIL ACTION BEFORE ANY SUBSTANTIVE THINGS HAPPENS. IT INVOLVES COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ON A NUMBER OF IT. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. STAFF IS -- STAFF IS GOING TO WORK. AND RIGHT NOW IT WILL BE ON THE FINANCING PLAN AND THAT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG. THE ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN WON'T -- EVERYBODY WON'T AGREE WITH, BUT THAT'S -- I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD WORK ITS WAY OUT, AS EACH KIND OF ACTION CAME FORWARD.
04:09:30.603: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU MAY HAVE TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL AND BRING IT FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT OR NOT ADOPT.
04:09:38.043: >> Councilmember Lumm: OR WE COULD BE PRESENTED WITH THIS, THE WAY WE ARE OFTEN PRESENTED RECOMMENDATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHENEVER -- YOU KNOW, WE HALTED WORK ON THE MASTER PLANNING CONSULTANT AND THAT WORK. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S BEEN HALTED, BUT IT HAS. I CAN SEE HOW -- I MEAN, THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR THAT. THERE ARE MANY OVERLAYS HERE WITH THE SOLID W WASTE PLAN THAT WE DIDN'T ADOPT AND YOU ADOPT ONE PLAN, IT IS THEN UTILIZED -- WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME AS A GREEN LIGHT FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN -- IN THOSE SAME AREAS. WE SEE THAT HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I -- YOU KNOW, IN ALL DUE RESPECT MR. POSTEMA, YOU SAID ASK WORK ON IMPLEMENTATION. I ASKED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND I ASKED WHAT THAT WAS AND GOT NOTHING IN RESPONSE.
04:10:53.352: >> City Atty. Postema: I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WOULD LOOK LIKE. THAT WOULD BE --
04:10:57.323: >> Councilmember Lumm: I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION.
04:11:05.197: >> City Atty. Postema: YEAH.
04:11:08.133: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:11:09.535: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I GUESS IN RESPONSE TO MR. POSTEMA, I APPRECIATE A LITTLE BIT OF A SIDE STEP ON YOUR PART, BUT I THINK THE RESOLUTION AS WRITTEN AND AMENDED CURRENTLY IS LINEAR AND CLEAR. WE WILL RECEIVE THIS REPORT. WE WILL GET A MATRIX PRIORITIZATION, A MATRIX OF SORTS AND A FUNDING PLAN BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HALT BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT IT AND SO I THINK WE CREATE TWO PARALLEL TRACKS BY WHICH WE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN, ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT AND WE ALSO RECEIVE THE -- THE FOLLOW-ON INFORMATION THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM HAS REQUESTED.
04:11:48.974: >> City Atty. Postema: RIGHT. IT'S NOT A SIDESTEP, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. IT'S A RECONCILIATION OF -- OF RESOLVE CLAUSES THAT THE COUNCIL IS -- IS IN REALTIME PUTTING FORTH AND -- AND VOTING ON AND LOOKING AT IT.
04:12:12.664: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO MANY MY INTERPRETATION OF BEING LINEAR AND WE ALSO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN, IS THAT AN ACCURATE READING AND INTERPRETATION OF IT AS WRITTEN HERE?
04:12:29.314: >> City Atty. Postema: THE LANGUAGE IS TO BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT AND THAT'S SEVERAL ACTIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT ACTION IS BEING TALKED ABOUT. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM TALKED ABOUT ONE, CONCERNING, YOU KNOW, HOUSING AND SO ON THAT HAS ITS OWN PROCESS THAT YOU ALL KNOW AND IT WOULD COME BACK BEFORE YOU. AGAIN, THAT'S THE BEST ANSWER I CAN HAVE GIVEN THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. SO IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE A SIDE STEP. IT WAS MEANT TO REALLY MAKE COHERENT OF SEVERAL COMPETING DESIRES HERE.
04:13:17.429: >> Councilmember Ackerman: FAIR ENOUGH.
04:13:21.366: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:13:22.501: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE ARE SPEAKING TO THE MAIN MOTION HERE?
04:13:26.905: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
04:13:27.473: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T DISLIKE THE NOTION THAT -- THAT, YOU KNOW -- IT KEEPS THINGS MOVING AND AS POSTEMA SUGGESTED, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER THAT INTERPRETATION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR IS, THAT IT'S MOVING FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSE IF WE DO ADOPT THIS IN ITS WHOLE NOW, WE ARE SAYING, HEY KEEP MOVING FORWARD WITH GETTING THAT BUDGET TO US OR WHATEVER, RIGHT? I MEAN, IT -- IT'S COMPLETELY UP TO THE INTERPRETATION OF STAFF'S ACTIONS AT THIS POINT, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S FINE. I HATE TO -- I GUESS -- I GUESS THE NOTION THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY. IT BUMS ME OUT BECAUSE I'M LOOLOOKING FOR WAYS TO TAKE THE BALL AND SHOW LEADERSHIP AND IF THAT LEADERSHIP IS BEING SHOWN BY SAYING, OKAY, COMMUNITY PARTNERS, TRANSIT, AND SO ON, WORK WITH US. IF THAT'S A WAY TO SHOW LEADERSHIP, THAT'S FINE. BUT I ALSO LIKE DIRECT ACTION BECAUSE I CAN CONTROL THAT DIRECT ACTION AND WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE KIND OF RESULTS THAT WE NEED FROM THAT ACTION AND SO MY BIGGEST CONCERNS TO THE WHOLE OF THIS IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CARBON REDUCTION EFFORTS IN HERE ARE NOT UNDER OUR DIRECT ACTION. THEY ARE UNDER OUR PLEAS AND VALUING OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS SAYING YOU HAVE TO ACT TOO. SO IT MAKES IT LESS THAN SATISFYING, A PLAN FOR ME TO SUPPORT, ALTHOUGH THE -- YOU KNOW, -- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. I APPRECIATE COUNCILWOMAN LUMM'S SUGGESTION THAT WE APPLY SOME MONEY TO IT, BECAUSE, I MEAN, WE JUST -- WE SIMPLY -- I FELT THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE SCHOOLS. WE SIMPLY CAN'T HAVE A BLANK CHECK FOR ENDLESS CLIMATE WORK, JUST LIKE WE COULDN'T HAVE THE BLANK CHECK FOR -- I REALLY FELT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A BLANK BILLION DOLLARS CHECK FOR THE SCHOOLS WITH NO SPENDING PLAN FOR IT. AND SO WE ARE KIND OF -- IT'S SORT AFF ANALOGOUS. IT'S ONLY ON OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, WHICH MAKES US EVEN, YOU KNOW, LESS EMPOWERED TO ACT IN OUR -- IN OUR OWN GOOD FOR OUR OWN GOOD AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. PEOPLE NEED HOPE IN THESE TIMES, THESE TROUBLED TIMES. YOU KNOW, I HOPE THAT THEY FEEL THAT OUR ADOPTION OF THIS GIVES THEM THE 40EN THAT THEY NEED. I SUGGEST THAT THE INPUTS ARE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING -- THIS IS SADLY GOING TO BE TOO LITTLE OR TOO LATE BEFORE WE OFFICIALLY HAVE ACTION. I WILL EXPRESS MY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THE GLOBAL DIFFERENCE THAT WE THINK IT IS. AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T, YOU KNOW, ACCELERATE THE GENTRIFICATION IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO PAY FOR IT WITHOUT ONLY INVITING THE ELIM WEALTHY O LIVE HERE, I'M SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT. ON A WHOLE, I SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT I NEED TO ACT AND SO I WILL LIKELY HESITANTLY SUPPORT THIS. IT'S A TERRIBLE TIME TO BE BRINGING FORWARD $300 MILLION THIS SPENDING WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT $10 MILLION AND MOVING FORWARD DEAF SILT, I WILL SAY THAT AND I -- DEFICIT, I WILL SAY THAT AND I FEEL MANY ASPECTS OF THIS ARE FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE. THANK YOU.
04:17:13.532: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE LUMM, BANNISTER NELSON ON THE QUEUE. IS THERE ANY STAFF -- YEAH. DOES STAFF FEEL LIKE THEY UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE AT THIS POINT?
04:17:23.942: >> ONE CLARIFYING QUESTION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I HEARD YOU SAY TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. I HEARD YOU SAID A PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK AND AN IMPLEMENTCATION PLAN. I THINK OF THEM AS DIFFERENT. I HAVE A PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK READY TO GO. AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN DOES EXIST FOR STAFF, WE DID IT WITH CURRENT BUDGET AND OUTSIDE BUDGET AND I WANT TO SAY WHEN YOU SAY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, CAN YOU PROVIDE MORE CLARITY, WHAT YOU MEAN SO I CAN MAKE SURE I PRESENT A PACKAGE THAT'S RESPONSIVE.
04:17:55.574: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE CAN TALK LATER. YEAH. THE FRAMEWORK OR THE MECHANISM AS I -- THE WORD I USED, SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE AND PRIORITIZE THE ACTIONS. THERE'S 44 ACTIONS, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THESE STRATEGIES ON AND ON AND THERE'S -- I'M LOOKING -- AND, AGAIN, THERE WAS A DISPARITY BETWEEN COST BENEFIT AND SO LOOKING FOR PRIORITIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT REFLECTS THE PRIORITIZATION OF HIGH-LEVEL ACTIONS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY THOUGHTFUL, THOROUGH, HELPFUL RESPONSES TO ALL THE QUESTIONS I -- I SENT YOUR WAY. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. QUICK QUESTION FOR MR. CRAWFORD. WILL YOU BE IMPLEMENTING ANY ASPECT OF THIS PLAN BEFORE YOU COME FORWARD WITH THE FUNDING PLAN FOR THE PLAN? I DON'T MEAN THE FUNDING PLAN FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. THE FUNDING PLAN FOR THE PLAN. AND THE PRIORITIZATION FOR THE PLAN.
04:19:13.919: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, I HOPE WE HAVE A FUNDING PLAN BACK SOONER AND THAT QUESTION BECOMES RELEVANT. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FUNDING PLAN, I DON'T KNOW -- LET ME TEMPER YOUR EXPECTATIONS SOME, PERHAPS. MUCH OF THE PLAN RELIES ON UTIOUTSIDE MONIES. THE IDEA THAT I CAN GIVE A PLAN TO YOU, HOW OTHER ENTITIES SPEND THEIR GOVERNMENT, WHETHER IT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THE AAATA. I HOPE YOU BEAR IN MIND THAT ANYTHING THAT I PROVIDE YOU TO IS KIND OF A THEORETICAL POSSIBILITY BUT IT REALLY WOULD BE UP TO -- FOR THAT TO BE A PLAN -- THAT'S WHAT I MEAN EARLIER WHEN I SAID, THESE THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN IN CHUNKS, AND IN REALITY, THEY WILL HAPPEN IN CHUNKS AS THEY WORK THE OPPORTUNITY. IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTING FOR THE FINANCIAL PLAN? IF IT IS THEN --
04:20:05.503: >> Councilmember Lumm: I -- I'M SORRY, IT'S GETTING A LITTLE FRUSTRATING, AND APPARENTLY THIS' A LOT OF CONFUSION. THE -- THE CITY'S ACTIONS -- HOW ABOUT THE CITY'S ACTIONS? THE CITY TAXPAYERS, I KNOW I ASKED FOR THE BREAKOUT FOR THE VARIOUS ENTITIES, I'M INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE CITY'S RESPONSIBILITY, OKAY? SO I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE EXTERNAL FACTORS RIGHT NOW. SORRY.
04:20:33.765: >> City Admin. Crawford: I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO -- BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OR AATA, OR THE COUNTY. AND I'M LOOKING FOR A FUNDING PLAN FOR THE CITY'S ACTIONS THAT ARE IN THE 150 TO UPWARDS OF $300 MILLION RANGE. THAT INCLUDES PARK AND RIDE. THAT'S RECOMMENDATION, RECOMMENDATION FOR THAT, AND THE SOLAR FACILITY, ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE THE CITY'S -- THAT THE CITY IS ON THE HOOK FOR FINANCING. WE DO NOT HAVE A FUNDING PLAN AND FUNDING SOURCES IDENTIFIED FOR THOSE THINGS.
04:21:13.538: >> City Admin. Crawford: OKAY.
04:21:14.205: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M FOCUSED ON THE IF I.
04:21:15.740: >> City Admin. Crawford: OKAY. GOT IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.
04:21:29.554: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE SAYING? COUNCIL MEMBER BANNISTER.
04:21:35.727: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR A RECONSIDERATION OF A VOTE ON MY. I'M MULTITASKING FOR A SICK RELATIVE OVER HERE, AND I THINK I MISSED SOME KEY CONVERSATION AND I THINK I OPENED UP THE CAN OF WORMS ON THIS AND I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD RECONSIDER MY VOTE AND MAKE IT A NO ON THIS PARTICULAR AMENDMENT.
04:21:59.918: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, PROCEDURALLY, COUNCILMEMBER, YOU DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECONSIDER THE VOTE AND -- BUT THE WHOLE MOTION NEEDS TO COME BACK.
04:22:10.028: >> Mayor Taylor: MY RECOLLECTION -- WAS THAT 7.4, MS. BEAUDRY?
04:22:17.535: >> Clerk Beaudry: I WROTE IT DOWN.
04:22:18.903: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN WE JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER'S VOTE WAS RECORDED IN ERROR AND IT WAS 6-5?
04:22:28.413: >> Councilmember Bannister: UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE WAS SIMILARLY --
04:22:33.551: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:22:35.787: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WAS GOING TO ASK, WE HAVE TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER, WAY BACK WHEN WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S AMENDMENT, COULD WE PIN DOWN A DATE FOR THE ASK IN THAT AMENDMENT? I THINK THAT A MOMENT AGO, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM CLARIFIED HER QUESTION, WHICH IS, SETTING ASIDE THE EXTERNALS, WHAT IS THIS LOOKING LIKE IN TERMS OF THE CITY'S COMMITMENT AND THE CITY'S IDEAS ABOUT COST? COULD WE -- I GUESS I'M PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT, ANOTHER RESOLVE CLAUSE, ASKING THAT THE FINANCIALS THAT ARE ASKED FOR IN JANE'S AMENDMENTS BE FIXED TO A DATE TO BE REPORTED TO UP COULD. CAN WE DO THAT?
04:23:28.306: >> City Admin. Crawford: COUNCIL , I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED TO -- THIS SEEMS TO BE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE. STAFF WILL WORK ON A FUNDING PLAN. WE WILL GET IT TO YOU AS SOON AS WE CAN. AND UNLESS YOU ARE CONCERNED THAT WE WON'T DELIVER, I DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR CONCERN REQUIRES OFFICIAL DIRECTION.
04:23:48.493: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANKS.
04:23:53.631: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? ROLL CALL VOTE, COUNCILMEMBER.
04:24:00.705: >> Councilmember Eaton: ON.
04:24:01.306: >> Councilmember Eaton: POINT OF ORDER, DIDN'T SHE MAKE A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION?
04:24:05.577: >> Mayor Taylor: SHE DID NOT. SHE ASKED ABOUT IT. I SUGGESTED THAT WE OBSERVE THAT HER VOTE WAS RECORDED IN ERROR, AND SHE CONSENTED TO THAT SOLUTION. MANY.
04:24:19.424: >> City Atty. Postema: THE ONLY OTHER POINT ON THAT, I THINK THAT THE CLERK WOULD HAVE TO INDICATE THAT SHE'S WILLING TO -- THAT SHE'S ABLE TO DO THAT PROCEDURALLY. TO ACCOMMODATE COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:24:32.470: >> Mayor Taylor: SHE --
04:24:33.004: >> Councilmember Eaton: I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S -- THAT FOLLOWS ROBERT'S RULES. I THINK FOR HER TO CHANGE HER VOTE, WE HAVE TO ALLOW HER -- ALLOW RECONSIDERATION.
04:24:43.581: >> City Atty. Postema: AND I THINK -- I HADN'T HEARD FROM THE CLERK ON THAT, BUT I THINK THAT -- MAYOR, I KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO EXPEDITE IT, BUT REALLY TO -- THE RECONSIDERATION COULD GO FORWARD VERY QUICKLY. AND SO --
04:25:05.870: >> Mayor Taylor: VOTE -- SO COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, SO YOU ARE BRINGING FORWARD A MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE AMENDMENT?
04:25:13.444: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
04:25:15.947: >> Mayor Taylor: SECOND?
04:25:16.481: >> Councilmember Eaton: I'M SECONDING THAT.

04:25:35.333: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO GO ON RECORD TO OPPOSE, I'M SORRY.
04:25:38.303: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY, TO OPPOSE THE RECONSIDERATION? MY APOLOGIES. LET US RUN THE RECONSIDERATION VOTE BECAUSE THERE IS A -- THERE IS OBJECTION. I'M SORRY THAT I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T CONCLUDE THAT. I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE WITH RESPECT TO THE RECONSIDERATION OF THE AMENDMENT STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.

04:27:33.584: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NOT ONLY DID I HAVE MY RAISED HAND ICON UP, I HAD MY HAND RAISED TO DISCUSS THAT VOTE, I WILL LET IT GO BY BUT I'M HAVING SOME PROBLEM WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE, STARTING WAY BACK WHEN COUNCILMEMBER ALI RAMLAWI OFFERED HIS RESOLUTION, OR HIS AMENDMENT, RATHER AND THEN IT WAS REFUSED TO  WITHDRAW IT. NOW THERE HAVE BEEN MANY TIMES IN THE MAST WHEN A RESOLUTION HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN BY ITS SPONSOR AND MAYOR TAYLOR, YOU SUGGESTED IT BELONGED TO THE BODY AND HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW THAT RESOLUTION AND I DISAGREE. SO THERE. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY.
04:28:17.128: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT RECOGNIZING YOU. IT WAS AN OMISSION. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? ROLL CALL VOLT, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
04:28:35.246: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.

04:36:50.907: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. CA-7, RESOLUTION TO DIRECT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION, AND PLANNING COMMISSION TO CREATE PROPOSED APPLICATION MATERIALS, REVIEW AND RECOMMEND DEVELOPMENT ENTITLEMENTS TO THE CITY COUNCIL FOR 415 WEST WASHINGTON TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF CA-7. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. YOU HAD TAKEN IT OFF THE QUEUE.
04:37:25.743: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. YES, I DID. AND I WOULD  DEFER TO MY WARD 5 COLLEAGUES.
04:37:38.923: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:37:39.823: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR SUPPORTING THIS TO THIS POINT. THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONSTITUENTS OF MINE WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE UP TO TODAY. WITH THAT, I HAVE TO ASK OUR STAFF A FEW QUESTIONS, BUT OBVIOUSLY, CA-7 PERTAINS TO 415 WEST WASHINGTON. LAST YEAR, I ASKED COUNCIL TO SUPPORT MY WISHES AND THE WISHES OF MANY TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES OF 415 AND SHARE THE COST OF EXPLORING THOSE OPTIONS WITH THE DDA. AND I WAS GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL FOR THE SUPPORT THAT COUNCIL GAVE. IN DOING SO, THE SPIT GROUP LEAD THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBILITIES AND THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THAT PROPERTY. I DON'T THINK IT'S AI MYSTERY THAT THE ISSUES ON THAT PARTICULAR CITY-OWNED PROPERTY. IT'S UNIQUE BECAUSE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR STAFF, IF THERE'S ANYONE AVAILABLE TONIGHT TO SPEAK ON THIS, WHO IS AVAILABLE TO SPEAK ON THIS TODAY?
04:39:10.914: >> BRETT LENART, HOUSING MANAGER. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE JENNIFER HALL AS WELL.
04:39:18.655: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR JOINING. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING UP SO LATE. HI, MS. HALL. HOW ARE YOU DOING? I HOPE YOU ARE DOING WELL. I HAVE BEEN REALLY PLEASED WITH THE SPEED THAT THIS IS PROGRESSING, BUT I AM FORTUNATE TO BE IN THE POSITION I AM TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROCESS, BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE THIS PROPERTY. WE DID HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE LAST MEETING HELD AT THE DDA OFFICES BACK IN FEBRUARY. I WAS THERE. I WAS AT THAT MEETING AND IT WAS FIRST TIME THAT SOME HEARD OF THE IDEAS AND THEY WERE TAUGHT OFFGUARD. SO THERE'S THIS COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND INPUT THAT I'M CONCERNED WITH. WITH WHAT THIS RESOLUTION CALLS FOR AND HOW MUCH COMMUNITY ENGAGE THERE IS GOING TO BE BEFORE ANYTHING IS DONE WITH THIS, IN A PREENTITLEMENT PROCESS.
04:40:38.368: >> SURE, I WILL TAKE THE FIRST STAPP ANDSTAB AND, JENNIFER, IFT TO FILL IN. WOULD YOU BE TASKING JENNIFER AND HOUSING COMMISSIONER AS THE PETITIONER AND ULTIMATELY US AS THE STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION THROUGH THE REGULAR FUNCTION TO LOOK AT WAYS TO REENTITLE THIS SITE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SOME OF THE NEXT STEPS OF THAT WOULD BE, OF COURSE, LIKE ANY PLAN, DEVELOPING A MORE REFINED PROPOSAL, WHAT THAT APPROACH LOOKS LIKE AS THE RESOLUTION INDICATES ARE WE GOINGED TO PURSUE UNDER A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OR A DIFFERENT ZONING DISTRICT? PUT TOGETHER A CONCEPT MAN THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF OUR ORDINANCE. AND LIKE ANY OTHER RESIDENT PLAN, WE WOULD START OFF WITH THE RESIDENT PARTICIPATION, THE REQUIREMENTS WHERE WE WOULD NOTIFY EVERYBODY PURSUANT TO THOSE REQUIREMENTS BASED ON THE SCOPE OF THAT PROJECT. ALL OF THAT HAPPENS PRIOR TO IN I FORMAL INITIATION OF THE ACTUAL APPLICATION PROCESS, AND THAT APPLICATION PROCESS WOULD THEN GO THROUGH THE SAME RIGOR AND TECHNICAL REVIEW LEADING UP TO A PLANNING COMMISSION PUBLIC HEARING WHERE, AGAIN, RESIDENTS AND THE PUBLIC WOULD BE NOTICED AS ANY DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL THAT HAS' PUBLIC HEARING AND ULTIMATELY, THIS WOULD GO TO THE CITY COUNCIL FOR THE ULTIMATE CONSIDERATION OF THAT BOTH VIA PUBLIC HEARING AND YOUR ULTIMATE DETERMINATION.
04:42:17.534: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THAT, AND IT'S GETTING LATE. HOPEFULLY WE GOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THIS. SO WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE THAT WE DON'T WANT A PREFORGONE CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT WILL BE PRESENTED TO COUNCIL TO CONSIDER. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY DECISIONS MADE TO THIS POINT THAT HAVE BOXED OUT OR BOXED IN ANY POSSIBILITIES? THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN, I BELIEVE, IS IN DENSITY, THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING, ET CETERA. IT'S A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT ABUTS THE DOWNTOWN, VERY CONCERNED WITH M MAINTAINING THE CHARACTERRISTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAVING -- CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAVING THE MASSING THAT'S APPROPRIATE. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THAT WOULD PRECLUDE ANY DISCUSSION AND INVOLVEMENT IN REDUCING SOME OF THE PROPOSED MASSING?
04:43:22.633: >> SO NOT YET, BUT THIS -- I THINK THERE'S A CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN THAT PROCESS. THAT IS THROUGH THAT -- THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT OCCURRED, THE PREFERRED OPTIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. I THINK THAT'S A GOAL HERE, IS TO IDENTIFY AND VALIDATE THOSE FINDINGS AND THE VIABILITY OF THAT AS A PROJECT. NOT ONLY DOES THAT INCLUDE YOU AS THE CITY COUNCIL AS THE FINAL ASHARBITER OF ANY SITE PLANS BUT ANY FISCAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THE PROPERTY BUT ALSO, I THINK I FAILED TO MENTION PREVIOUSLY, IT'S ALSO GOING TO, OF COURSE, THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION REVIEW FOR THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THAT PROJECT AND THE CONTEXT OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. THE SHORT ANSWER IS, NO, WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT. THE GOAL IS TO REALLY TAKE THIS PREFERRED OPTION AS  A JUMPING OFF POINT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION MORE DEFINITIVELY, IF FOR SOME REASON, THIS SORT OF FRAMEWORK IS NOT VIABLE THROUGH OUR APPROVAL PROCESS, OR AGREEABLE TO THE CITY AS THE LANDOWNER, THAT HAS OTHER IMPLICATIONS INTO THE VIABILITY OF IT, YOU KNOW, THIS -- THESE PREFERRED OPTIONS WERE NOT ONLY ARRIVED AT FROM A PHYSICAL AND ZONING REQUIREMENT BUT ALSO CONSIDERED A FISCAL ANALYSIS TOO. SO IN SHORT IF THIS RESOLUTION WAS ENACTED BUT IF IT SAYS IT'S NO MORE THAN TWO STORIES IN HEIGHT, WE WOULD REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT WITH CAREFUL CONSIDERATION WHETHER OR NOT IT REALLY IS A VIABLE PROJECT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DELIVER TO THE COUNCIL, WHICH WAS HOW IS THIS SITE AND THE PORTFOLIO OF ALL OF THOSE CITY-OPENED PROPERTIES ADVANCING, EITHER ON SITE OR KEEPING UP WITH RESOURCES.
04:45:21.151: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO IF I WAS ONE TO WANT THE HEIGHT RESTRICTION TO BE NO HIGHER THAN THE CHURCH THAT'S ON THE CORNER OF THIRD AND WILLIAM, OR -- OR OF LIBERTY, THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE INTRODUCED HERE TONIGHT OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSED AS WE GO FURTHER?
04:45:38.201: >> I MEAN, THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S DISCUSSED, BUT, AGAIN, WE'RE TRYING TO FIND SORT OF A -- BEST CONSENSUS OF DIRECTION TOWARDS ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS MORE DEFINITIVELY SO THAT WE KNOW HOW WE CAN USE THIS SITE. THIS PROPOSED PLAN DOES MEET AN APPROPRIATE -- I THINK IT'S LARGELY BASED OPEN THE D2 SCOPING, WHICH IS MASTER PLAN, AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE EVALUATED IT FOR. I THINK WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING MIGHT BE A MORE RESTRICTIVE ZONING APPLICATION. SO WE COULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT. SHOULD WE PROCEED HERE OR NOT.
04:46:21.578: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WOULD THIS BE DONE UNDER A PUD WHERE WE COULD BE ZONING IT, BUILDING IT, TO WHAT WE SEE AS BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AND WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY -- IT'S NOT A BY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT, THAT IS GOING TO BE BUILT UNDER D2 ZONING, IT COULD BE ANYTHING UNDER A PUD?
04:46:46.069: >> YEAH, OUR INITIAL THOUGHT IS THAT PUD IS PROBABLY OUR FIRST -- OUR FIRST APPROACH. YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE RESOLUTIONS DO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY. THE PUD GIVES US AS THE CITY SORT OF THE -- A BIT OF THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO BOX IN THE SITE DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US.
04:47:15.499: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU ALREADY TOUCHED ON A COUPLE OF THINGS, AND I'M SORRY THAT I'M LONG WINDED. YOU TOUCHED ON THE HISTORIC COMMISSION'S INVOLVEMENT IN THIS, AND THE PARAMETERS THAT THIS PROJECT WILL NEED TO FALL IN, WITH IT BEING IN THE HISTORIC COMMUNITY -- THE HISTORIC DISTRICT, CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS THAT THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE OR THE QUALIFICATIONS IT WILL NEED? HAD.
04:47:45.962: >> SURE. BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT, THE FINAL DETAILED BUILDING PLANS AND ARE ARCHITECTURE WILL REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM THE HISTORIC COMMISSION, PER THEIR CRITERIA, THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE AND HARMONIOUS WITH THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. JUST GENE GENERALLY SPEAKING, IS MAKING SURE IT'S A QUALITY, A SCALE, AND ARRANGEMENT THAT ARE HARMONIOUS BUT BUT THEY ARE CAREFUL NORTH TO IMITATE HISTORIC ARCHITECTURE. SO THE IDEAL PROJECT IS SOMETHING THAT THE COMMISSION FINDS IS HARMONIOUS AND IT'S CLEAR.
04:48:37.414: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND IT NEEDS THAT SEAL OF APPROVAL FROM THE HISTORIC COMMISSION?
04:48:42.953: >> IT DOES.
04:48:43.286: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST FROM THE INDUSTRY LINE CONSERVANCY IS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH VOICE TO THIS POINT. CAN YOU PERHAPS SHED A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT OF WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THE URBAN TRAIL INCORPORATED IN THE MASTER PLAN AND HOW THAT WILL BE RESPECTED THIS PROJECT GOING FORWARD, IN ADDITION TO THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS? NOW THAT, IS AN ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED ON COUNCIL EARLIER. IT WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE FIRST RESOLUTION, LOOKING AT 415 AND WE DIDN'T PUT IT AS A WHEREAS CLAUSE. CAN IT BE PUT BACK IN, IN THE PROTECTION OF THE CHIMNEY SWIFT AND, OF COURSE THE MASTER PLAN WITH THE URBAN TRAIL? SHOO SURE. I WILL TOUCH ON A FEW AND MAYBE, JENNIFER, IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. AS IT RELATES TO THE TREE LINE TRAIL, YOU KNOW, WHY SPEAK FOR THEM, IF THEY DIDN'T FEEL THAT THEY HAD ELEVATED ENOUGH VOICE. OUR INTENTION WAS TO ENGAGE WITH THEM. WE DID ENGAGE WITH THEM ON A SPECIFIC BASIS. THE PREFERRED RATIO THAT WE ENVISIONED HERE IS ABSOLUTELY REPLICATING THIS SITE'S RENDER AND ADOPTED TREE LINE MASTER PLAN. THAT TREELINE MASTER PLAN TALKS ABOUT WHAT WE ANTICIPATED HERE ON THIS SITE AND THAT BEING -- THAT SITE BEING SHARED WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT, WHICH THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH. I DON'T SEE THE CONCERN OF THAT ASSET OR THAT ASPIRATION BEING LOST BUT IF THAT WERE OF A CONCERN, KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CITY HAS THE ULTIMATE CONTROL OF THAT. WE COULD EVEN TAKE STEPS TO IDENTIFY AN EASEMENT AREA OF THAT TREELINE AREA, WHICH WE ARE PROPOSING TO BASICALLY MATCH THE FLOODWAY DESIGNATION EARLY IN THIS PROCESS. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT NECESSARILY HAS TO WAIT UNTIL THE PREENTITLEMENT DECISION. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD CONSIDER IN ADVANCE. TO BE SURE, IT COULD HAVE IMPACTS ON THE VALUE OF THE OVERALL PRO THE BUT NOBODY IS PROPOSING ANYTHING DIFFERENT. WE SEE THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE TREELINE TRAIL AT THIS SITE IS BENEFICIAL BOTH TO TREE LINE AND TO THIS SITE. AS IT RELATES TO THE CHIMNEY SWIFT HABITAT, THAT'S DEFINITELY STILL AN ASPIRATION AS PART OF THE PLANS. THE COMPLEXITY, WITH THE FLOODWAY AND THE FRINGE AND THE CHIMNEY, AND RECOGNIZING IMPROVEMENTS AS PART OF THE TREELINE, NOT ONLY THE SPACE, ALL OF THOSE FACTORS ARE SOME THE FACTORS THAT LEAD THE SITE TO NOT BE THE SHINING FAMILY OF A FEDERALLY FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. NONETHELESS, WE DON'T WANT TO FORECLOSE THAT OPTION RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHERE, YOU KNOW, IN AGAIN, HOW THIS SITE MIGHT BE USED IN THE PORTFOLIO OF ALL OF THOSE PROPERTIES, THIS COULD BE THE REALIZATION OF A COUPLE OF AFFORDABLE UNITS THERE. IFS NO THE UNITS REALIZED THERE, THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME RESOURCES TO COME OUST OF THE SITE TO SUPPORT THEM ELSEWHERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY. JENNIFER, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT.
04:52:36.986: >> I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE ARE BRINGING FORWARD BECAUSE IT HAS MORE CHALLENGES THAN ANY OTHER SITE, WITH LOTS OF COMPETING PUBLIC INTERESTS. I WOULD PERSONALLY PREFER IF WE HAD MORE DIRECTION FROM THE FIFTH COUNCIL WARD MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ON RESTRICTIONS. THAT COULD SAVE US A LOT OF TIMES IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE PROJECT. IS IT FEASIBLE? WE COULD SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON A PROJECT THAT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE FEASIBLE. I WOULD RATHER KNOW THAT UP FRONT. SO IF YOU DO HAVE --
04:53:35.645: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I ACTUALLY DO. I THINK THE HEIGHT IS A HUGE CONCERN AND SOME OF THE PROPOSED PROJECTED WERE FOCUSING ON DENSITY AND PACKING IN AS MANY UNITS AS POSSIBLE AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO FLY OVER THERE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE HEIGHT OF THE LEVEL OF CHURCH ROOF LINE, THE MARK. AND I FORGET WHAT OTHER BUILDING. IT WAS 55 FEET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT THE HEIGHT AND THE MASSING IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE, WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CREEK. SO SOME OF THOSE EXTREMELY DENSE IDEAS, PROJECTS, I DON'T THINK HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF HOPE OF GETTING THROUGH. I DID SEE SOME OTHER PROPOSALS THAT KEPT THE ROOFLINE IN LINE BE WITH WHAT I JUST SAID AND I WOULD STRONGLY URGE THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT WE GO.
04:54:46.282: >> GREAT. I ALSO WANTED TO ADD ONE THING. WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS, WE WERE TRYING TO ENGAGE AS LARGE OF THE COMMUNITY AS WE COULD. WE WERE LOOKING AT IT AS PUBLIC PROPERTIES THAT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE CITY WOULD HAVE INTEREST IN, IN PARTICIPATING IN. SO OUR SORT OF MAR MARKETING STRATEGY WAS SPECIFICALLY BROAD, AND NOT NEIGHBORHOOD ADJACENT SPECIFIC, AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING TO THE NEIGHBORS. I UNDERSTAND THAT. WE WERE ACTUALLY THINKING THAT COMES IN IN NEXT PHASE THAT WE ARE IN, WHERE YOU AS THROUGH WHAT BRETT MENTIONED WHERE YOU HAVE THE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT DISCUSSION WITH THE NEIGHBORS. IT WAS NOT -- DEFINITELY NOT INTENDED TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM PARTICIPATING. WE WERE TRYING TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE AS POSSIBLE.
04:55:42.538: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE EXTRA TIME TO SPEAK ON THIS, I THINK THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT WE HAVE RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM. NO, IN IF A A FACT, I KNOW IT I. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED THE LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT TEASE PROPERTIES. WE HAD -- THESE PROPERTIES. WE HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN ON CATHERINE AND 4th, WHERE WE APPROVED THIS -- TO BE LOOKED AT FURTHER AND THEN WE GET A BACKLASH FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS AREA. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE PROPERTIES IN DUALITY, LOOKING AT THEM, COMMUNITYWIDE AND MORE LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED BY THE REVELDMENT OF THESE PROPERTIES AND -- THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROPERTIES AND AS WE GO FORWARD, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO BOTH, NOT JUST ONE.
04:56:40.997: >> Mayor Taylor: WHO DO I HAVE IN THE QUEUE IN COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, I THINK. NO COUNCI COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMA.
04:56:49.405: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL DEFER TO THE WARD 5 COLLEAGUES BUT ALSO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IS IN THE QUEUE BEFORE ME.
04:56:57.413: >> Councilmember Lumm: I AM.
04:57:01.250: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YOU PULLED IT FROM THE AGENDA.
04:57:05.655: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
04:57:07.423: >> Councilmember Smith: NOT ONLY IS THIS MY WARD BUT IT'S MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT THE NOTICE AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT DIFFERENT STUFF. THERE'S EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION IN THE COMMUNITY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO 415. I THINK FOR ME AND BRETT AND JENNIFER, YOU CAN JUMP IN. I GET CONFUSED BY THE TERM PREENTITLEMENT. ARE WE DEVELOPING A SITE PLAN THAT'S APPROVED AND THEN MARKETED? YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET WHAT OUR END PRODUCT IS.
04:57:45.094: >> YES, ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS BEFORE WE POTENTIALLY MARKET THIS PROPERTY OR OTHER PROPERTIES FOR PARTNERSHIP, ANSWER AS MANY QUESTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS AS POSSIBLE INCLUSION OF THE RESULT PROCESS AND WHETHER IT'S THROUGH A PUD AND CONCEPT PLAN OR AN AREA PLAN WE A STANDARD ZONING OR A SITE PLAN, OUR GOAL AND OUR INTENTION IS TO NOT ONLY -- NOT SAY DOWN THE ROAD, WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PARTNER ON 415 WEST WASHINGTON BUT RATHER WITH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PARTNER ON 415 WEST WASHINGTON AND IT HAS THE APPROVAL FOR, X, Y, AND Z, SO FAR AS IT'S COMPLIANT WITH THESE STRENGTHS AND THESE GOALS AND OUR HOPE OUR ASPIRATION IS TAKING -- EVEN IF IT'S INCREMENTAL STEPS THAT WILL AS MORE VALUE AND PREDICTABILITY TO SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO TAKE ON A HOUSING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION.
04:59:03.072: >> Councilmember Smith: SO THIS IS GETTING TO THE SITE PLAN FOR WHAT WE WOULD APPROVE, TO SIMPLIFY -- THIS IS A SITE PLAN THAT COUNCIL VOTES ON ON AND WE SAY THIS IS WHAT WE WANT AND CAN YOU DO IT?
04:59:20.022: >> YES. AND OUR GOAL WAS TO ARM YOU WITH COMMUNITY CONVERSATION BEFORE WE START DOWN THAT PATH.
04:59:35.705: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU. I DEFER THE REST OF MY TIME.
04:59:38.441: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
04:59:47.450: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND ACKERMAN ARE IN BEFORE ME.
04:59:55.291: >> Mayor Taylor: BY THE HANDS RAISED YOU ARE NEXT. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, BY THE HANDS RAISED, YOU ARE NEXT. DOES ANYONE WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:00:08.938: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  AS A GROUP, WE ASKED STAFF TO PURSUE JUST THIS, TO HOUSE NEIGHBORS IN NEED, EITHER THROUGH THE DIRECT CONSTRUCTION OF UNITS OR AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THOSE UNITS AND NOW AS A GROUP OF LEADERS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A HUGE NEXT STEP WHICH IS TURNING OUR WORDS AND PROMISES INTO PL PLANS AND I THINK THIS IS AN EXCITING SHIFT OF HOW WE DEVELOP PUBLICLY. I'M ALWAYS CAUTIOUS TO USE THE WORD LIBRARY LOT. BUT I THINK THIS ENCOMPASSES A LOT OF LEARNS AS FAR AS WHAT CAUSED FRICTION WITH THE LIBRARY LOT PROCESS. WE AS ASKED DEVELOPERS AROUND TE COUNTRY ON WHAT MIGHT BE BUILT ON OUR PUBLIC OWNED LAND AND I THINK THAT RUBS SOME RESIDENTS THE LONG WAY. I WAS HAPPY WITH THE END PRODUCT OF THE LIBRARY LOT. I VOTED TO MOVE IT FORWARD A COUPLE OF TIMES BUT THIS IS REALLY RESPECTFUL TO THOSE RESIDENTS WHO DID HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT PROCESS, BECAUSE INSTEAD, IT PUTS A LOT MORE INPUT AND SAYS THIS IS WHAT THE COMMUNITY ASPIRES FOR IN REALISTIC TERMS AND NOW YOU COME AND PARTNER WITH US. I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE ACCOMPACCOMPLISHMENT AND THERE E DIFFERENT GOALS FOR DIFFERENT RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT'S GREAT. I WILL JUST SAY, LIKE, I'M EXCITED TO TAKE THIS NEXT STEP. YOU KNOW, I FOR ONE MADE A LOT OF PROMISES AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND IN THE NEWS AT THE COUNCIL TABLE AND I KNOW PROBABLY EACH OF YOU HAVE AS WELL. AND THIS IS A REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO TURN OUR PRO PROS INTO ANOTHER REACTION AND TO CREATE REALISTIC PLANS THAT BALANCE OUR NEED FOR HOUSING WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND WITH LONG-TERM PLANS LIKE THE TREELINE TRAIL, WHICH I THINK THESE WILL BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND NOT CONFLICTING. SO SUPER, SUPER EXCITED TO VOTE FOR THIS MOVING FORWARD AND REALLY APPLAUD THE CREATIVITY OF STAFF TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH A LONG HELD GOAL, BUT THROUGH A DIFFERENT VEHICLE THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BRING MORE COMMUNITY TOGETHER.
05:02:58.541: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DID I MISS YOU COUNCILMEMBER GRAND? FAIR ENOUGH, MY APOLOGIES COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:03:13.923: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I HAVE ENJOYED WATCHING THIS PROCESS GO FORWARD BECAUSE IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE IT WAS SOME STEPS THAT WE TOOK, THAT I WAS PROUD OF AS A COUNCIL AND I FEEL SORRY FOR MS. HALL, THIS THE FIRST PROPERTY IS THE ONE WITH THE LONG AND SORTED HISTORY OF COMPLEXITY AND INACTION. WHEN I LOOKED IT UP, I THINK THE FIRST RFP WENT OUT IN 2009. SO WE HAVE BEEN GETTING INPUT ON THIS SITE, FOR LIKE 11 YEARS, AT LEAST. SO I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF LESSONS THERE, IN ADDITION TO THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEENGAGEMENT TO SEE WHAT PEE WANT TO SEE AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE. THERE'S A GREAT PLACE FOR THE TREELINE. WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO. THAT'S WHY WE SPENT ALL OF THAT MONEY ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR THE TREELINE TO SHOW IT WHERE IT'S EXACTLY TO GO. IT'S INTO ERR DOWNTOWN. WE KNOW THERE'S WATER ISSUES BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE. IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I THINK IT ALSO -- IT'S A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD, AND IT'S A PLACE THAT I THINK IS REALLY DESIRABLE WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL WANT TO LIVE AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CREATIVE IDEAS, BUT, YOU NO H YOU KNOW, THERE'SS THIS CALL, NO WE NEED TO STEP FORWARD. I THINK 11 YEARS IS ENOUGH. I THINK WE CAN MOVE WITH THE SITE. I THINK IT'S RESPONSIVE TO THE TREELINE IN SHOWING THAT 30% OF THAT SITE GOES EXACTLY WHERE IT SAYS IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO IN MASTER PLAN.
05:04:52.688: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:04:54.189: >> Councilmember Nelson:  MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE TREELINE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PLAN AND I -- AND I GUESS I'M -- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY WEREN'T ENGAGED ENOUGH, UP TO NOW, IS THERE FOR FOR THEM TO STILL BE ENGAGED OR BY A DECISION TONIGHT, ARE WE SAYING LIKE IT'S THE 30 WHATEVER PERCENTAGE. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE AN OPINION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THAT IT'S ADEQUATE, BUT IT'S CONCERNING TO ME THAT -- I GUESS I -- I GUESS I'M CURIOUS -- I AND FORGIVE ME IF IT'S BEEN ANSWERED ALREADY. DO YOU FOLLOW MY QUESTION IS? IS THERE ROOM FOR THE TREELINE TRAIL TO BE -- TO CONTINUE TO BE PART OF DISCUSSION?
05:05:49.478: >> ABSOLUTELY. LIKE I SAID, THEY WERE ENGAGED SPECIFICALLY THROUGH THIS PROCESS. I CAN ONLY SEE FROM SOME OF THE CORRESPONDENCE I HAVE SEEN THAT THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT -- AT ITS CORE, PERHAPS THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF HOW DO WE USE THIS AS A RESOURCE TO REALIZE AS MANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN THE CITY. I'M EXTRAPOLATING THAT MAYBE THIS SITE IS NOT CONSIDERED IN THE OTHER SITES THAT WERE IN THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION. ABSOLUTELY WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM. THE EASY DECISION IS TO DEDICATE THAT MACE BUT THERE WILL BE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE NOT ONLY THROUGH THE REALIZATION OF ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WE WILL LOOK AT HOW WE ADVANCE THE TREELINE GOALS ON THAT SITE AS WELL. SO ABSOLUTELY WE WILL BE ENGAGED AS WE MOVE FORWARD, YOU KNOW. I THINK THE REALIZATION OF DEVELOPMENT ON THE SITE NOT ONLY SOLIDIFIES THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE TRAIL BUT PROBABLY IS THE POSSIBILITY TO ADD SOME OF THE IMPROVE OF THE TRAIL AND THEY WILL BE ENGAGED AS WE GO FORWARD.
05:07:02.217: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
05:07:14.663: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM. WE ARE AT A HALF HOUR ALREADY.
05:07:17.633: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I WILL COMMENT ON CA-7 AND CA-8. SO IN TERMS OF AND I APPRECIATE HEARING FROM OUR 5th WARD COLLEAGUES ON. THIS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ABOUT THE ENGAGE OF THE TREE LINE CONSERVANCY FOLKS. WE HEARD AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MEETING, THEY WANT MORE TIME AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCUSS AND COLLABORATE WITH THE CITY. AND THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED THAT AT THIS JUNCTURE. AS COUNCILMEMBER COUNCI COUNCILA THIRD OF THE SITE IS IN THE FLOODWAY, WHICH AS YOU INDICATED IS PROPOSED TO REMAIN AS OPEN SPACE FOR THE TREELINE. THE AND YET THERE'S DISCUSSIONS TO DETAIL THE SPECIFICATIONS AND TO GET FEEDBACK FROM THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY FOLKS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF USE WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THE PROPERTY. I'M NOT SURE WHAT ALL OF THEIR QUESTIONS ARE. OBVIOUSLY THEY STILL HAVE QUESTIONS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE MORE ENGAGED WITH US ON AND THEY CAN'T CURRENTLY HAVE ND THAT OPPORTUNITY FULFILLED AT THIS POINT. SO FOR 415 WEST WASHINGTON AND 350 SOUTH FIFTH. AND FOR THE FOLKS LISTENING, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH ASKED WHAT DID PRE ENTITLEMENT MEANS. IT MEANS SUBMITTING ALL THE APPLICATIONS AND THE DOCUMENTS THAT THE CITY REQUIRES FOR ANY PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT. 415 HAS, AS WE HAVE NOTED, FOR YEARS AND YEARS, IT'S BEEN A SITE IN DESPERATE NEED OF DEVELOPMENT. IT'S AN EYE SORE. IT'S A DIFFICULT PROPERTY. IT'S IN A FLOODPLAIN. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS AT REDEVELOPMENT OVER THE YEARS AND THE ONLY INTEREST HAS BEEN FROM THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY FOLKS FOR USE FOR THE TRAIL. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IN MY COLLEAGUES WANT TO POSTPONE THIS AND GET FEEDBACK FROM THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS. ANY MAJOR DECISIONS IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES WITH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, IS SO DIFFICULT IS PROBLEMATIC. THE PROPOSAL IS PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL. I DO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE SITE. I WAS ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD. AGAIN, FIRST THAT IT WOULD BE OPEN FOR OPEN SPACE ON THE TREELINE TRAIL AND BECAUSE SITE WILL LIKELY REQUIRE LOCAL SUBSIDIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THE ALTERNATIVE OF SIMPLY DEVELOPING OR SELLING THE PROPERTY AND USING THE PROCEEDS ELSEWHERE REMAINS AN OPTION. OBVIOUSLY THE CYCLING UP AND GETTING THEM BACK ON THE TAX ROLLS ARE POSITIVE. IN TERMS OF 350 SOUTH FIFTH, THE Y LOT HAD SEVERAL FAILURES AND CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE PROPOSED BUILDINGS. I DO THINK THAT THIS PROPERTY, 350 SOUTH FIFTH PERHAPS AS ANY OTHER IS A VIABLE CANDIDATE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOCATED NEXT TO THE BLAKE TRANSIT CENTER AND IT'S WELL SUITED WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE PROPERTY HAS A HISTORY IN ANN ARBOR OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE PRELIMINARY PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A THIRD OF THE UNITS AS AFFORDABLE AND THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION I ASKED STAFF. STAFF INDICATED THAT NO, THE LOCAL ONGOING SUBSIDY WOULD BE REQUIRED AT THAT MIX. ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE FOR THE Y LOT, THE LIKELY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THERE'S NO ONSITE PARKING. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S A BROADER CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE, BUT NOT TONIGHT. THAT ELS'S MY TWO CENTS ON BOTHF THESE, AND I CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE THOUGHTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THESE TWO. TWO CHANGES.
05:12:18.734: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
05:12:20.836: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAD A QUESTION FOR BRETT. IT THE MEMORANDUM INDICATES THAT THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS ARE ACTUALLY AN IMPEDIMENT IN THE AREA. DO YOU READ IT THAT WAY AS THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS ARE IN THE LIST THERE? DOES THAT READ THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY AN IMPEDIMENT?
05:12:42.357: >> SO I JUST WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR, OUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO PRESERVE THE COUNCIL'S DESIRE AND PRESERVE THAT HABITAT. BY DOING SO, THAT IS A IMPEDIMENT TO FLEXIBILITY AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE TIGHT BY LOCKING IN THAT ONE ASPECT OF THE SITE AND THERE MAY BE POTENTIAL COST ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING SURE THAT THAT STRUCTURE REMAINS STABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF CONSTRUCTION AND ITS LONG-TERM STABILITY. SO IT'S NOT AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE REUSE, BUT THE COST EFFECT ENVIRONMENTNESS OF THE SITE, THAT AND SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED BY ME AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE REASONS WHY AFFORDABLE HOUSING MIGHT BE CHALLENGING TO REALIZE ON THAT SITE, BUT AGAIN, I WANT TO BE CLEAR, WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ON THAT.
05:13:39.815: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK THAT WE NEED TO MAYBE HIRE AND ORNITHOLOGIST ON THAT. I WHEN MAYOR TAKER AND I RESEARCHED THIS AND COSPONSORED TO LOOK INTO CHIMNEY SWIFTS, THERE'S BEEN ALMOST NOTHING DONE SINCE THAT. AND THERE'S BEEN NOTHING DONE AS FAR AS ORNITHOLOGISTS AND HOW TO PROTECT THE CHIMNEY OR ANY RESEARCH INTO WHAT PEER CITIES DO FOR CLIMATE ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. SO I DON'T THINK -- I'M DISAPPOINTED AND SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT WE AREN'T -- THAT WE ARE ACTING LIKE THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS ARE AN IMPEDIMENT. GO AHEAD.
05:14:32.901: >> I JUST WANT TO BE -- I WANT TO BE CLEAR. OUR GOAL IS TO -- WE HAVE TAKEN THAT RESOLUTION AS DIRECTION AND AS TO HOW WE IMPLY THOSE PROJECTS. SO I -- I CERTAINLY APOLOGIZE FOR ANY SENSE OF FRUSTRATION THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN PROGRESS THUS FAR, BUT THAT RESOLUTION IS IMPORTANT IN THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERING THAT AND INCLUDING THOSE QUESTIONS AND ANALYSIS AS WE PRO ED.
05:14:57.759: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANKS. AND THEN I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION FOR JENNIFER HALL. I WAS WONDERING, WE HAD TALKED ABOUT A SURVEY THAT WAS IN PROGRESS OF LOW-INCOME RENTERS ABOUT WHETHER THEIR DOLLAR WOULD STRETCH SUFFICIENTLY IF THEY LIVED DOWNTOWN OR WHETHER THEY WOULD -- AND THE SURVEY, IF THEY PREFERRED TO LIVE FURTHER OUT WHERE THE DOLLAR MIGHT GO FURTHER. HAVE WE BROUGHT IN ANY NEW -- HAS THAT SURVEY COMPLETED YET?
05:15:32.627: >> WE HAVE A LITTLE UNDER 300 SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED, BUT THAT STOPPED WHEN THE STAY AT HOME ORDER STARTED BECAUSE WE WERE DOING MOSTLY FACE-TO-FACE DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE TO FILL THEM OUT. WE HAVE -- SO IT'S NOT DONE. I MEAN, WITH, WE COULD STOP WHERE WE ARE AT BUT I WOULD MAKE A FULLER STUDY. WE HAVE TALKED TO FOLKS MEDC ABOUT POTENTIALLY PARTNERING WITH THEM TO DO MORE RIGOROUS KIND OF ANALYSIS, AS OPPOSED TO SORT OF A SIMPLISTIC, YOU KNOW, SURVEY THAT'S NOT REAL RIGOROUS STATISTICALLY. THIS IS MORE -- IT'S INFORMATION THAT IS HELPFUL. IT'S JUST NOT AS RIGOROUS STATISTICAL ATHAT WILL SIS.
05:16:17.539: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, I'M INTERESTED IN THAT, AND GIVE US UP WHY DATES ON THAT ONE. AND SO, YEAH, MY TWO CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROJECT OVERALL IS THE PRINCIPAL OF THE IMMEDIATE ADJACENT NEIGHBORS NOT BEING FULLY ENGAMED ENGAGED IS A PRINI WOULD LIKE TO SEE UPHELD. IT MAY BE BETTER TO FOCUS ON THE Y LOT BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH BETTER FOR WHAT OUR GOAL OF TRYING TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING DONE. AND THEN LASTLY, I AM VERY -- THERE'S ANOTHER DISCONNECT WHERE WHEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY SPEAKS DURING PUBLIC COMMENT ASKING US TO REMOVE THIS FROM THE AGENDA, THAT -- I'M HAVING A DESCONNECT BETWEEN STAFF THINKS THAT WE DID INCLUDE THEM BUT WHEN THEY ARE THINKING THAT THEY DIDN'T, THAT ALSO IS SOMETHING FOR -- THAT I'M WEIGHING AND CONSIDERING AS WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
05:17:39.120: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:17:41.556: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I -- WOW, THAT WAS QUITE A -- QUITE A STRANGE DELAY ON MY END. I THINK YOU SAID HAYNER.
05:17:48.963: >> Mayor Taylor: I DID.
05:17:49.497: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. GREAT. I THINK THE CONCERN -- I THINK FROM RESIDENTS, THE CONCERN THAT WE ARE ALL SPEAKING TO HERE -- AND I WILL EXPRESS IT FOR MYSELF THAT WE WONDER OR I WONDER AT WHAT POINT IN THIS PROCESS OF CREATING THIS PREENTITLEMENT FOR THIS LAND DO WE TAKE UP THE INTEREST OF THE NEIGHBORS, THE TREELINE TRAIL, THE ORNITHOLOGY CROWD AND SO ON. WE LOOKED AT THIS FOR 11 SOME YEARS. COULD HAVE ABOUT AN AN REPORT CENTER OR A TREELINE PARK OR A TRAINZATION. THERE WERE A LOT OF IDEAS THAT CAME OUT AND NOW WE ARE AT THIS, WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE PREENTITLED TO BE THE SMITH, THE DENSEST AMOUNT OF HOUSING ON THIS SPACE AND PUTTING IN AN APPROPRIATE PORTION TO THE TREELINE TRAIL. AND SMITH GROUP DOESN'T PAGE NUMBER THEIR PRESENTATIONS SO I THINK IT'S PAGE 22 THROUGH 25, WHICH DISCUSSED THOSE VARIOUS OPTIONED AND I GUESS MY CONCERNS WITH THIS PREENTITLEMENT ARE. AT WHAT POINT DOES CITY COUNCIL -- I GUESS THIS IS A PROCESS CONCERN. AT WHAT POINT DO WE SAY, HEY YOU ARE OUR CLIMATE ACTION AND RESILIENCE PLANS YOU WILL CALL FOR MIXED USE AND THIS IS RESIDENTIAL CALE AND OKAY, IT MS IT MORE SAILABLE. AND AT WHAT POINT DO WE SAY THAT THE TAX REVENUE OF $1.1 MILLION IS DEDICATED SOLELY TO THE HOUSE FUND AND NOT JUST WOWED AWAY IN THE GENERAL FUND? AND SO AT WHAT POINT IN THIS PROCESS ARE THOSE KINDS OF DECISIONS MADE AND THOSE KINDS OF, I GUESS -- I KNOW IT WOULDN'T BE PART OF THE ENTITLEMENT AS A BID PRO E SIS. I THINK PEOPLE WANT MORE TO SAY WITH THE DISPOSITION OF THIS PUBLIC PROPERTY AND I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHEN THAT HAPPENS. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION FOR MS. HALL AND MR. LEONARD. ARE WE LOOKING AT THIS NOTION THAT YOU MAY COME BACK AND SAY SOMEBODY WANTS TO P BUY IF OUTRIGHT AND THEN WE SAY THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THAT MONEY, MAKE SURE IT GOES TO THE ATOABLE TRUST FUND OR WHEN DOES ALL OF THAT HAPPEN?
05:20:31.693: >> WELL, IN MANY MY MINE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS ALL OF THESE REALLY MESSY QUESTIONS AROUND DEVELOPMENT, AND YOU END UP TALKING TO ALL OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES THAT MADE -- WHETHER YOU TALKED TO THEM PREVIOUSLY OR NOT, IT DOESN'T MATTER. AT SOME POINT, WE NEED TO BRING SOMETHING BACK TO CITY COUNCIL THAT WILL HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO GET IT PASSED. SO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET TO THAT POINT, WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH ANY INTERESTED PARTY THAT WANTS TO WEIGH IN ON IT. LIKE THIS IS THE POINT WHERE THAT HAPPENS.
05:21:05.126: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY, YEAH, I'M NOT SURPRISED THE FULL BUILD OUT OPTION IS WHAT WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN IS SHOWING UP FOR THE PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT ARE REALLY PUSHING THAT MAXIMUM USE FOR RESIDENTIAL. WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS ANY TIME WE DISPOSE OF A CITY PROPERTY THAT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE REQUIRED USES ON IT THAT MEET OUR OTHER GOALS IN OUR CLIMATE -- WHETHER THAT'S CLIMATE ACTION PLAN OR THE MASTER PLAN AS IT SITS. I'M NOT SURE WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT THING BEFORE US BY MOVING THIS FORWARD TONIGHT. BECAUSE I CERTAINLY SUPPORT DISPOSITION OF THIS PROPERTY. I JUST -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY ON THE RIGHT THINGS AND THAT WE'RE GETTING THE RIGHT KIND OF BUILDING OUT OF IT. SPEAKING TO SWIFTS IF YOU LOOK AT -- I THINK IT'S PAGE 25, AND THEY TALK ABOUT THE D2 ZONING RECOMMENDATION, 150,000 SQUARE FEET, AND 173 UNITS, AND 9900 FLEX SPACE. AND THAT'S QUITE A LARGE BUILDING. THAT'S BEGIN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. BUT THE BUILDING ENVELOPE ENCOMPASSES THAT CHIMNEY SWIFT CHIMNEY. THAT MAXED OUT USE, DO WE ANTICIPATE THAT IF WE PREENTITLE IT FOR THE MAXIMUM THAT ANYONE WILL COME BACK WITH ANYTHING BUT THE MAXIMUM?
05:22:48.796: >> NO, I DON'T. BUT I WOULD ALSO ADD THE DIRECTIVE WE HAD FROM COUNCIL WAS TO COME UP WITH FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE OPTIONS AND TO COME UP WITH FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE OPTIONS FOR A SITE THAT YOU CAN'T ACCESS A LOT OF GRANT FUNDING MEANS THE WAY YOU MAKE IT FEASIBLE IS YOU HAVE TO INCREASE THE DENSITY. IF THERE IS NOT A DESIRE TO HAVE HIGHER DENSITY, THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE LOCAL SUBSIDY. IT'S REALLY THE CHOICE BETWEEN WHAT COUNCIL WANTS TO SEE ON THAT SITE, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE LOWER DENSITY, ITS VERY LIKELY THAT WE WILL SAY, OKAY, THE SUBSIDY FOR UNIT IS THIS HIGH. AND THEN YOU CAN WEIGH THOSE CHOICES AND DECIDE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO DO IT THERE. IT MAY NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE AT ALL BECAUSE THE LESS DENSE THE SITE IS, THE HARDER IT IS TO HAVE THAT CROSS SUBSIDY BETWEEN THE MARKET RATE AND THE AFFORDABLE OR EVEN IF YOU DID SOME OTHER USE THERE. AND EVERY WE ARE PUBLIC PURPOSE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, WHETHER IT'S PRESERVING THE CHIMNEY SWIFT AB HABITAT, WHETHER IT'S THE BROWNFIELD CLEANUP, ALL OF THOSE THINGS ADD COST. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS SITE SO DIFFICULT AND SO COMPLICATED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT'S FEASIBLE, BUT WE CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT. WE CAN MEET EVERY ONE OF THOSE GOALS. IT'S JUST GOING TO COME AT A CERTAIN COST.
05:24:30.031: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SURE I. I APPRECIATE THAT NOTION. I WANT TO MAKE THAT WE CAN HAVE THESE FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE REST OF YOUR EFFORTS, JENNIFER. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SALE OR THE LEASE OR THE TAXABLE VALUE OF THIS PROPERTY IS -- I DON'T WANT TO WAIVE 12 YEARS OF TAXES TO THE CITY, THAT WE DID THIS TO HELP AAHC, BUT WE WON'T REALIZE THAT FOR 12 OR 15 YEARS. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PROPERLY ENCUMBERING THE FUNDS TO GO TO WHERE WE WANT THEM TO GO AS WE CHARGE YOU TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE ABLY DONE. THAT'S ALL. I WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE AND I SUPPORT THIS NOTION. THIS IS WHAT WEED HER TO DO AND IF IT COMES BACK AND SAYS THE BEST THING TO DO IS TEL SELL ITD USE THE MONEY, THAT'S FINE. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I THINK YOU SUGGESTED THE LIBRARY LOT ANALOGY. THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE. I SHOULD SEE NO PROBLEM WITH DOING THE SAME THING FOR THIS PARCEL. THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND RAM LAW AND WE ARE AT 50 MINUTES.
05:25:48.242: >> Councilmember Eaton: OKAY. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. WE WILL GO FORWARD AND TRY TO DESIGN A SET OF WARA METERS TO OFFER TO A DEVELOPER AND IS IT CORRECT TO SAY THAT THE PREFERRED OPTION IDENTIFIED IN THE ATTACHMENT TO THE RESOLUTION IS WHAT WE ARE WORKING WITH WHEN WE TRY TO ESTABLISH THE ENTITLEMENTS.
05:26:16.838: >> YES, WE WOULD START WITH THE PREFERRED OPTIONS IN THE CASE OF 415 WEST WASHINGTON WHICH INCLUDES AS IDENTIFICATION OF THE TREELINE TRAIL IN THE APPROPRIATE PLACE. IT IS BELOW THE MAXIMUM FAR FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR THAT AREA. WE WOULD -- IF DONE THROUGH A PUD, WE MIGHT PUT TOGETHER THE CONCEPTUAL PLAN THAT REFINES THE PROJECT IN GREATER DETAIL TO MEET THE CITY'S ORDINANCE STANDARDS OF -- IT'S A PUD CONCEPT PLAN. WE WOULD ALSO PUT TOGETHER THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT WOULD ARTICULATE THE EXPEGGATIONS OF PUBLIC BENEFITS AND ANY RESTRICTIONS --
05:27:03.084: >> Councilmember Eaton: MY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION, THE ENTITLEMENTS ARE TO TRY TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE CONCEPT THAT'S IN THE PREFERRED OPTION.
05:27:12.526: >> YES.
05:27:13.194: >> Councilmember Eaton: OKAY. AND SO LISTENING TO THE NEIGHBORS WOULD LIVE CLOSEST TO THIS SITE, THEY DON'T FEEL AS IF THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPING A PREFERRED OPTION WAS ROBUST ENOUGH AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THEM. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE GOING FORWARD WITH A PRECONCEIVED NOTION THAT SHOULD HAVE TAPPED INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD SENTIMENT MUCH MORE THAN THIS PREFERRED OPTION SEEMED TO. SO PUTTING THAT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT. I ALSO TALKED TO A NUMBER OF THE BOARD OF THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY, AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY MET WITH STAFF A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO OR SO AND THEY HAVE COMMUNICATED TO ME THAT THEY DON'T THINK THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAD CONCLUDED. AND THEY ARE SURPRISED THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH A PREFERRED OPTION BEFORE THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CONSERVANCY HAVE CONCLUDED AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE REASON THEIR DIRECTOR ASKED US TONIGHT TO DELAY THIS. AND SO THESE TWO GROUPS, THE PEOPLE WOULD WILL LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH WHATEVER IS BUILT THERE, AND THE TREE LINE CONSERVANCY DON'T BELIEVE WE CONCLUDED OUR PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS. SO I'M REALLY HESITANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS. CERTAINLY WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS PROPERTY FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND I HAVE PROBABLY ONLY BEEN VOLUME OFFED IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OR SO, BUT NONE OF THOSE EARLILY EARLY DISCUSSIONS WERE CONCEIVED OF THIS. I THINK THAT'S WHY THE PUBLIC INPUT PORTION OF THIS REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE PASS THIS ALOD ALONG TO THE ENTITLEMT STAGE OF THE PROCESS. I WILL MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS TO ALLOW STAFF TO HOLD A MEETING WITH THE NEIGHBORS, THAT CAN BE NOTICED IN OUR USUAL FORM OF NOTICING OF DEVELOPMENT TO NEIGHBORHOODS AND TO CONCLUDE THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TREE LINE CONSERVANCY.
05:29:30.898: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LULL. CAN YOU FIND A DATE OPEN THAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
05:29:38.272: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD ASK STAFF HOW MUCH TIME THEY WOULD NEED TO HOLD THAT OUTREACH.
05:29:46.914: >> WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO START FOR PROBABLY A MONTH OR TWO AT LEAST, AND I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE THAT TO LOOK LIKE. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DELAYING MOVING FORWARD. THERE'S NO FUNDING ROUND THAT IS IMPACTED. IT'S ONE SITE OF MANY THAT WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD. SO YOU CAN DELAY IT FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT BUT IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN, IT WOULD BE HARDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET THAT INTENT, AS FAR AS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.
05:30:27.121: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE STAFF GO BACK AND MEET WITH THE CONSERVANCY AGAIN AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF HAVE CONCLUDED. I THINK THAT'S ONE OR TWO MEETINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MEETING MUCH LIKE THAT LAST MEETING, I THINK THAT WAS THE DDA OFFICES, EXCEPT GIVING THE NEIGHBORS WITHIN -- WHAT IS IT 1,000 FEET, A POSTCARD NOTICE OF THE MEETING IN ADVANCE AND THAT WOULD BE JUST ONE PETEING. SO WITH THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE, WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TIME TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE THINGS?
05:31:07.261: >> I THINK NOT -- NOT CITY COUNCIL MEETING IN JUNE. IT TAKES ABOUT A MONTH TO -- IF WE MET WITH FOLKS IN JUNE, THEN IT WOULD TAKE TO JULY TO BRING IT BACK TO CITY COUNCIL?
05:31:19.974: >> Councilmember Eaton: YOU THINK UNTIL JUNE TO MEET WITH THE NEIGHBORS?
05:31:22.910: >> WELL, I DON'T SEE IT NECESSARILY HAPPENING IN MAY PROBABLY.
05:31:29.884: >> Councilmember Eaton: OKAY. SO SUGGEST A DATE THAT YOU THINK WOULD WORK.
05:31:40.060: >> THE FIRST MEETING IN JULY.
05:31:47.001: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO JULY. THAT'S MY MOTION.
05:31:51.639: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY LUMM. I HAVE A QUEUE WITH RAMLAWI, HAYNER AND ACKERMAN. ARE ANY OF THOSE ON THE POSTPONEMENT? RAMLAWI?
05:32:01.815: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, ON POSTPONEMENT, YEAH. ONE OF THE THINGS I DON'T HAVE IS PATIENCE UNFORTUNATELY. I UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUES FRUSTRATION ON THIS AND CONCERNED. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A PREFERRED OPTION ALREADY, I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU THAT PREFERRED OPTION, WHAT MAY MA MATRIX WE UD TO THE PREFERRED OPTION. THAT GIVES ME CONCERN THAT WE ARE GOING INTO THIS WITH THE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT MAYBE WE ARE NOT ALL AWARE OF. SO I DON'T WANT TO ELABORATE TOO MUCH ON THIS, BUT I WILL LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES ON POSTPONEMENT.
05:32:54.101: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:32:54.969: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THIS IS ON POSTPONEMENT. THERE IS A MATRIX IN THE SMITH GROUP PRESENTATION THAT PRIORITIZES THIS AND, YOU KNOW, TREELINE TRAIL WAS THE THIRD CONNECTIVITY OF THAT TRAIL, IT'S A THIRD CONSIDERATION AFTER ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND MAXIMIZING AFFORD ABLE HOUSING UNITS AND I ASSUME -- IS THIS IS WHAT WE ARE BRINGING FORWARD FOLLOWING THAT GRID CHOICE AND IF WE PUT THAT OFF, IT WILL GIVE THE TREELINE GROUP AN ADDITIONAL SAY? AND BUILDING SCALE AND ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO THE NEIGHBORS ARE PRETTY LOW IN THAT MATRIX. I JUST -- I GUESS THAT'S WHY I BRING IT UP AT THIS POINT. IS THAT MATRIX PRETTY MUCH FINE WITH THIS ENTITLEMENT PROCESS? AND IS PUTTING IT OFF GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING AS FAR AS GETTING ADDITIONAL INPUT AND SATISFYING THE CONCERNS OF THAT INTEREST GROUP, WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH. I MEAN, AT SOME POINT THIS WAS GOING TO BE ALL AGREED. SO I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS POSTPONING IT, AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T SUBSTANTIALLY, YOU KNOW, BEHINDER THE PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD.
05:34:18.352: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:34:19.620: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THINK WE NOT ONCE BUT TWICE GIVEN STAFF DIRECTION ON THIS SITE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS DIRECTION, BUT A LOT OF THIS WAS TELEGRAPHED BY MS. HALL IN VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS. AND WE ALL SAW THIS COMING AND I THINK DELAYING THIS IS YOU KNOW, DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS. I HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL LONG ISLAND ENOUGH TO SEE MORE THAN ONE LAND USE PROCESS LANGUISH AND LANGUISH, AND THE WAY YOU GET A SITE TO LANGUISH FOR TEN YEARS, 11 NOW, IS JUST KINNOUSLY PUSHING THE PROCESS FORWARD WITHOUT MEANINGFUL CHANGE BEING ON THE MENU. SO I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS.
05:35:16.543: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:35:17.478: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S A RELATIVELY SHORT POSTPONEMENT, AND I DO THINK IT -- THE FACT THAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON DRILLED DOWN ON WHAT ENTITLEMENT MEANS, ITS NOT A SITE PLAN, OBVIOUSLY, BUT WE KNOW THAT RAW SQUARE FOOTAGE, AND THE RENDERINGS SHOW SIX STORIES. AND 173 UNITS AND THE AFFORDABILITY IS TO BE DETERMINED. THAT'S THE KIND OF SPECIFICITY THAT IF THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS AND THE TREELINE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THEY WERE ADEQUATELY HEARD, I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THEM. SO ITS NO THE A LONG POSTPONEMENT AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THAT POSTPONEMENT.
05:36:29.183: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
05:36:33.454: >> Councilmember Smith: HOW IS THAT? LIKE MY FRIEND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I LACK PATIENCE. THE SITE HAS BEEN VACANT, ABANDONED, NEGLECTED, FOR 13 YEARS. LET'S EITHER MAKE A DECISION OR CUT BAIT. IT'S SOMEONE OF THE TWO. I MEAN, WHAT'S -- I THINK I'M SPEAKING FOR MY ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD, WE ARE PRETTY FRUSTRATED EVERY TIME WE WALK INTO THE Y WHEN SOMEONE SAYS WHEN ARE WE GOING TO TEAR THAT DOWN? WHEN ARE WE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT? IT'S A REAL NEGATIVE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK WE HAVE SEEN THE POSITIVE BENNE BENEFITS OF REDEVELOPING EYE SORES AND PROBLEM REPORTS. WE HAVE TURNED A CAR WASH INTO THE MARK. WE TURNED A GAS STATION INTO ARGUS FARM STOP AND YET WE STILL HAVE THIS EYE SORE. I WOULD PREFER TO VOTE ON THIS AND MOVE ON.
05:37:43.524: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCIL COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI.
05:37:48.328: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PREFERRED OPTION WAS PROBABLY THE LEAST LIKED AMONGST THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS NOTION OF PREFERRED OPTION FRANKLY IS NOT DRIVEN BY COUNCIL OR THE RESIDENTS, IT'S DRIVEN FOR HIGH DENSITY AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SET OUT FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LAND. I'M TORN I CAN'T SEE MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. I'M JUST SURPRISED THAT THIS IS THE PREFERRED OPTION AND IF I SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT, IT'S TO TELL STAFF THE PREFERRED OPTION HAS VERY LITTLE CHANCE IN SUCCEEDING. I THINK WE SHOULD BE GOING DOWN A DIFFERENT ROUTE, A DIFFERENT -- LESS DENSITY, SOMETHING THAT RESPECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I DON'T SEE HOW THE PREFERRED OPTION GETS BY THE HISTORIC COMMISSION, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THIS PROPERTY. IT'S BLIGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC BENEFIT TO GO ALONG WITH REDEVELOPMENT. WE GET TO CLEAN UP THE CONTAMINATION, INCREASE HOUSING, AND PUT SOMETHING ON THE TAX BASE. AND THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS AND I THINK THIS HAS GOTTEN HIJACKED BY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT WASN'T MY INTENTION WHEN I FIRST BROUGHT THIS TO COUNCIL IS TO REDEVELOP THE SITE AND THEN THE HOUSING STOCK TO OUR COMMUNITY. IT WASN'T FOR MAXIMIZED DENSITY UNDER AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT IS NOT WHAT MY INTENTION WAS WITH BRINGING THIS SITE FOR REDEVELOPMENT AND NOW I'M -- IT'S GOTTEN CLOUDED. SO IT'S JUST VERY HARD FOR ME RIGHT NOW, AND THIS PREFERRED OPTION IS NOT COMING FROM COUNCIL, NOR FROM THE COMMUNITY. IT'S COMING FROM FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO WANT TO SEE HIGH DENSITY, EXTREME DENSITY ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE. AND THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT THE INTENT AND THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING THIS TO REDEVELOPMENT, NOT THIS PARTICULAR SITE.
05:40:17.077: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE COUPLE MONTHS DELAY TO GET INPUT IS NOT GOING TO DELAY THE PROJECT. IF WE APPROVE THIS TONIGHT, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BREAK GROUND THIS YEAR AND MAYBE NOT EVEN NEXT YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER ALL THE PIECES, A PLAN, FINANCING AND A PARTNER. SO A COUPLE OF MONTHS IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE WHEN THE CURRENT BUILDINGS COME DOWN OR WHEN A NEW BUILDING GOES UP, IN ANY SUBSTANTIAL FORM. I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE IN A HURRY, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIMELINES THAT WERE IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESENTATION A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THEY ARE ALL YEARS LONG. AND DOING THE PUBLIC INPUT PORTION OF THIS CORRECTLY IS NOT GOING TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL DELAY IN THE PROJECT. THANK YOU.
05:41:09.529: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:41:14.367: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WOULD ARGUE THE OPPOSITE, BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME LONG, WE CAN'T HAVE THE DELAY. WE HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD FOR PUBLIC INPUT. SO AT SOME POINT, YOU HAVE GOT TOTO DECIDE TO GO AND FOLLOW OUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION. THERE WAS PUBLIC INPUT. THERE WAS ACTUALLY IN MANY I WAYS SUPERIOR TO OTHER KINDS OF PUBLIC INPUT THAT WE HAVE SEEN BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT PUBLIC INPUT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WE DON'T USUALLY GET TO HEAR FROM. AND THEY SAID WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE HOUSING ON THESE TWO SITES. SO I WILL SPEAK TO THE OTHER SITE BECAUSE I THINK THAT ONE IS EVEN EASIER. BUT I THINK -- I DO WANT TO ACTUALLY COMMENT THE PUBLIC INPUT THAT THAT WAS DONE. IT WAS HELD AT MULTIPLE SITES. IT JUST WASN'T -- AND WITH AN EYE TO GET THE INPUT FROM THE NEIGHBORS THROUGH THE REGULAR DEVELOPMENT PROCESS GOING FORWARD. JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME VOICES THAT WE TYPICALLY HEARD FROM IN THE PUBLIC PERSON DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD CITE SIZE IT. IF ANYTHING, WE SHOULD BE THANKING STAFF FOR HEARING FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND DIFFERENT AGES, FROM, Y YOU KNOW NOT JUST THE SAME PEOPLE WE ALWAYS HERE FROM. AND THOSE PEOPLE SAID WE WANT HOUSING AND GO FORWARD AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE. SO IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE WHAT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE SAID THEY WANTED IT TO LOOK LIKE. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE INPUT IS INVALID.
05:42:59.005: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE POSTPONEMENT, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.

I WANT TO PUT IT OUT THERE THAT I CONTINUE TO EXPRESS THE CONCERNS THAT EVERY PARCEL WE HAVE REMAINING, EVERY INFILL PARCEL THAT WE HAVE ARE VACANT, EVERY PARCEL THAT GOES THE WAY OF -- NO OFFENSE TO THE ARCHITECT. IT GOES AGAINST THE TYPICAL BUILDING. IT'S WORKING AGAINST THE CLIMATE GOALS AND HOPEFULLY THE TRANSIT ORIENTED GOALS AND THIS IS A PERFECT SITE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A STAND ALONE BUILDING LIKE THIS. A COMMERCIAL BUILDING LIKE THIS. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT SITE FOR A MIXED USE TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT TYPE PROPERTY AND SO -- AND ALL THE TIME, WE -- WE IMPINGE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS BY -- YOU KNOW, THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ZONING AND THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE. AND THIS IS OUR ONLY -- REZONING IS OUR ONLY CHANCE TO REALLY SAY THAT CLEARLY AND SO I HAVE NO DOUBT THIS WILL BE SUPPORTED AND PASSED BUT I WON'T VOTE FOR IT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING BETTER THERE. THAT'S MY PREROGATIVE.

05:53:07.780: >> Councilmember Eaton: I UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS BEING PROPOSED, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE MOVING OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TARGETS TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MORE AFFORDABLE. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE CHANGE FROM 50% AMI TO 60% AMI. I UNDERSTAND THIS WILL PROBABLY PASS BUT I WILL BE VOTING NO.
05:53:32.939: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:53:33.806: >> Councilmember Ramlawi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
05:54:32.932: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:54:36.869: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I UNDERSTAND WHERE FOLKS ARE COMING FROM WITH THIS, AND THE EFFORT IS BROADLY CHARACTERIZED AS BEING CONSISTENT WITH OUR OTHER MOVES TO DEFINE AFFORDABILITY AS 60% OF AMI, BUT I HAVE TO AGREE WITH COUNCILMAN EATON THAT, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO HOLD THE LINE AND EVEN 60% IS NOT AFFORDABLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND SO WE HAVE A SITUATION WITH THE DDA, IF THEY ARE CHARGED TO WORK AT -- AT 50, THAT'S A SPECIAL EXCEPTION BECAUSE WE CAN TELL THEM TO DO THAT AND SO I -- I APPRECIATE THE NOTION THAT IT'S LOWER. I WOULD MAKE IT EVEN LOWER, IF I COULD. SO I -- I UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING THAT RAISES THAT AND I FRANKLY, THINK THAT WE SHOULD START CALLING IT -- WE SHOULD CHANGE OUR LANGUAGE AROUND THIS, AND WE SHOULD START CALLING IT LOW-INCOME HOUSING INSTEAD OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE EVEN 60 IN WASHTENAW COUNTY IS NOT AFFORDABLE FOR MANY, MANY PEOPLE.
05:55:43.069: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK ZAZAZA>> Councilmember Ack THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I LIKE THE DDA TO CONTRIBUTE MORE FINANCIALLY AND THE EFFORT IN OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSE HOUSING, IT'S ACROSS ALL THE OTHER PLANS THAT WE TRACK AND THE METRICS THAT WE TRACK AROUND AFFORDABILITY. THIS 10% THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING REPRESENTS THE ANNUAL INCOME. IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT FOR THE AVERAGE WORKER THAT DOESN'T MAKE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR OR NOT. I THINK IT'S GOOD. I THINK IT'S SMART. I THINK IT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY AND I WILL SUPPORT IT.
05:56:29.515: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:56:30.950: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, I WOULD JUST ECHO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI STATED THAT THIS ALLOWS THE -- THIS IS BEING PROPOSED IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE DDA GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS CHANGE ALLOWS THEIR DOLLARS TORE SPENT, THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RELATED PLAN STUDIES, PROCESSES, ALL OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS BEING RECOMMENDED. I DO HEAR COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S CONCERN. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE -- AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND I ATTENDED MEETING BACK IN EARLY MARCH WHEN IT WAS A DDA BOARD MEETING AND WE ATTENDED AS PARTNERSHIP COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND, AGAIN, THE -- THEY UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDED THIS BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW THEM TO LEVERAGE THIS FUNDING THIS NEEDED WAYS. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU.
05:57:37.850: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? THIS CHANGE WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE CAN HAVE IN THE DOWNTOWN. AND THEREFORE, I WILL VOTE IN FAVOR OF IT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR -- I'M SORRY, ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.

05:58:49.355: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MOVE TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED JET ONE MORE TIME, AT LEAST. I THINK IT'S PREMATURE RIGHT NOW TO TAKE A VOTE ON THIS, WITH ONGOING TALKS WITH OUR ATTORNEYS AND I MOVE TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED TO MAYBE THE FIRST MEETING IN JULY.
05:59:12.311: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
05:59:18.017: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU, I WAS HAVING TROUBLE CONNECTING AT THE START OF OUR MEETING BUT I WAS GOING TO ASK AT THE START OF THE AGENDA TO JUST PUSH THIS OR REMOVE IT FROM THE AGENDA AS ONE OF THE SPONSORS BUT A POSTPONE IS GOOD. I KNOW WE KEEP KICKING IT DOWN THE ROAD AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT KICKING IT DOWN THE ROAD BUT I THINK WE KNOW FROM OUR BRIEFINGS THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SET THIS OFF UNTIL WE HAVE SOME PUBLIC HEARING AND OTHER THINGS HAPPENING. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I WILL SUPPORT THIS AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN CONTINUING TO PASS THIS RESOLUTION DOWN THE ROAD, BUT IT'S THERE FOR A REASON AND SO IS THIS POSTPONEMENT.

06:02:23.369: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
06:02:25.738: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION, MR. POSTEMA. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND COUNCILMAN GRISWOLD'S CONCERN OVER THE PREVIOUS EXTENSION OF THESE CONTRACTS BECAUSE WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS. AND I WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT I SINCERELY HOPE WE CAN WRAP THIS UP SOON AND I ALSO CONTINUE TO WISH FOR A MATTER OF MECHANISM TO RECOVER THESE COSTS SOLELY BORNE BY THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THE OTHER INTERVENING PARTIES AS THE RESULT OF A POLLUTER'S ACTIONS. AND I WOULD ALSO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REACH OUT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SAY YOU ARE WELCOME TO HELP US RECOVER THESE COSTS AT ANY TIME. THANK YOU.

COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
06:03:34.673: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP TO ME BY A COMMUNITY MOBILE. THIS IS SORT OF AN EVIDENCE OF LIKE TALK TO YOUR COUNCIL MEMBER WHEN YOU ARE NOTICING SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WORKING RIGHT FOR OUR COMMUNITY. SO PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE FOOD ASSISTANCE, IT'S A FEDERAL SNAP PROGRAM, BUT IT'S ADMINISTERED BY THE STATES. PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE FOOD ASSISTANCE ARE USING EBT CARDS AND MICHIGAN HAS A REGULATION PRESUMABLY TO PREVENT FRAUD, THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU CANNOT USE THESE CARDS OVER THE PHONE OR ONLINE TO PLACE ORDERS, AND IN THE CURRENT TIMES, IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT THIS RESTRICTION IS A HUGE OBSTACLE FOR FAMILIES AND PEOPLE GENERALLY WHO ARE NEEDING TO PLACE ORDERS SO THEY CAN PICK UP FOOD OR HAVE FOOD DELIVERED. IT'S -- IT'S JUST A BIG OBSTACLE. AND I ALREADY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH OUR STATE REP -- OUR STATE REPRESENT IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THIS. HE'S ALREADY PASSED ON THE ISSUE TO GOVERNOR WHITMER. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE RESOLUTIONS TRYING TO RAISE THE VISIBILITY OF THE ISSUE AND TELL EVERYBODY, LOOK, THIS IS IS REALLY A PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT. SO I ASSUME THAT THIS IS NOT PARTICULARLY CONTROVERSIAL AND WE CAN ALL GET BEHIND THIS. THANK YOU.
06:05:07.065: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.

06:05:21.146: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:05:22.915: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SAME FOR ME, IF YOU COULD ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADD TO OUR POLICY BUT I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT THERE'S EVEN CONVERSATIONS THAT -- FLOATING AROUND ABOUT NOT LETTING INTO GROCERY STORES AND THAT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY FOR FOLKS FOR PEOPLE ON SNAP IF THIS WAS NOT IN PLACE. JUST AS MUCH AS WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE NOT TO GO SHOPPING ON THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF THE MONTH BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE BENEFITS COME OUT AND THE SNAP FOLKS ARE ABLE TO GET IN THIS AND PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCTS WITHOUT THEM BEING MISSING FROM THE SHELVES AND SO THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
06:06:03.188: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
06:06:05.324: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, IT'S GOOD OF YOU TO THINK OF THIS AND ADDRESS THIS AND BRING THIS FORWARD. AND TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YES, THIS IS ORD ORDINARILY THET OF LEGISLATIVE POLICY RECOMMENDATION THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD OR INITIATED, WHATEVER REFERRED TO THE POLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE, BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY AN URGENT NEED TO ADDRESS THIS AND I APPRECIATE THIS -- THAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON TOOK THIS ACTION AND IS MAKING THIS RECOMMENDATION AND HAS SPOKEN WITH OUR STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND THEY ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS AS WELL. THANK YOU.
06:06:51.770: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
06:06:54.706: >> Councilmember Grand: REAL QUICK. THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. I ALSO -- I KNOW THAT VARIES BY DIFFERENT STATES. SO ACTUALLY IN MICHIGAN, I LEARNED THAT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THE MONTH THEY ACTUALLY THE SNAP BENNETT S SO YOU CAN GO SHOPPING WHEN YOU CAN. I HAVE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK IN FOOD SECURITY TO TRY TO AVOID BUYING ANYTHING THAT HAS A. WWIC SYMBOL IF SUPPLIES ARE LOW.

06:08:16.488: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS FOR A CREDIT UNION BRANCH BUILDING ON WEST STADIUM. THIS IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE AREA LAND USES. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. I WOULD NOTE -- I THINK IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT WEST STADIUM AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT PREVIOUSLY, IS ONE OF THE POTENTIAL TRANSIT ZONING DISTRICT CORRIDOR CANDIDATES AND I ASK THAT THE PROJECT WAS PERMITTED UNDER THE ORDINANCE DRAFT FROM THE FALL. THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THIS CREDIT UNION BILLING WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED FOR FIVE SEPARATE REASONS. NOT ONE, BUT FIVE REASONS. WHICH SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THE DRAFT IS PROBABLY OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE AND THAT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO THESE CORRIDORS WILL NOT WORK. IT ALSO SUGGESTS, AS THE SWAYINGS -- WE HAVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION FOR THE PROJECT ON SUMMIT DID THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL AS WE CHANGE DEVELOPMENT ROLES IN WHAT WE DEMAND OR I THINK WE WILL NOT SEE ANY PROJECTS AT ALL. THANK YOU.
06:09:30.162: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZAZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I TOOK THIS MORE IN LINE WITH MR. HAYNER THAT. THIS AREA WAS RIGHT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND MIXED USE AND WALKABILITY IN THE AREA. THAT SAID, WE HAVE THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS TODAY. I THINK THIS WILL PROVIDE A SERVICE TO RESIDENTS AND THEY ARE WORKING WITHIN OUR LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT EXISTS TODAY AND I WILL NOT TELL THEM KNOW. CREDIT UNIONS PROVIDE A GREAT SERVICE TO MANY PEOPLE, IN THIS CASE PUBLIC SERVANTS. THANKS.
06:10:08.567: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATION TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?

06:10:21.880: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETES AND REFERRALS. MOVED BY LUMM, SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS. MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT, ONE SHOULD CALL THE TELEPHONE NUMBER AND ENTER THE MEETING ID ON YOUR SCREEN. CALLERS WILL BE CALLED ON ONE BY ONE BY THE CITY CLERK, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND THE YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT. PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA, AND MUTE ANY TV OR OTHER SOUNDS. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK AND THE CLERK WILL KEEP TIME AND ANNOUNCE WHEN 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING. WHEN THE TIME IS UP, YOU WILL BE PLACED ON MUTE SO WE MAY MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. IS THIS ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
06:11:28.480: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE HAVE ONE CALLER. 534.
06:11:44.062: >> THANK YOU. I KNOW -- (NO AUDIO). AT THE LAST COUNCIL MEETING, WHERE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI RAISED THE ISSUE THAT MAYOR TAYLOR, YOU SHOULD BE APPOINTING TO SOMEBODY TO THE MANNING COMMISSION. THE CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THAT SPOT HAS BEEN  UNFILLED FOR NEARLY A YEAR. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN CONTINUES TO FILL IT PER THE RULES FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT IS A SEAT DOESN'T GO UNFILLED IF YOU FAIL TO NOMINATE SOMEONE. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN SERVED FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE ON COUNCIL WHO ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF SERVING THAT POSITION AND GIVEN THAT IT'S ALMOST A YEAR, THAT YOU NOMINATE SOMEBODY FROM COUNCIL FURTHER, AT THAT LAST MEETING, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN MADE SOME INACCURATE STATEMENTS REFERRING TO THE GARNET BUILDING WHEN HE SAID THAT C1A WAS PROVEN TO BE A VIABLE ZONING DIS STRICT FOR THAT PROJECT. IT APPEARS THAT HIS CHOICE OF THE WORDS PROVEN MEAN THAT SIMPLY HE'S ASSERTING SOMETHING AND THAT -- THUS THAT IS PROOF. HE'S ACTUALLY QUITE WRONG THAT THERE'S BIN A BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT PROVED THAT HE IS WRONG. IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO A LETTER FROM SUSAN FREELANDER, ON NOVEMBER 17th OF 2017, THAT HAS NEVER BEEN REFUTED BY ANYBODY AT THE CITY AT ALL, EXCEPT A SIMPLE DENIAL WITH NOTHING TO BACK IT UP.
