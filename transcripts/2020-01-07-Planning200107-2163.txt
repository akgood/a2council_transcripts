00:00:16.399: >> GET THE MEETING STARTED. WELCOME TO THE JANUARY 7TH MEETING. WELCOME, EVERYONE. WE'LL BEGIN THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING WITH A ROLE CALL.
00:00:33.084: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  MEMBER ACKERMAN? WE HAVE A QUORUM.
00:00:44.495: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME. DO WE HAVE ANY INTRODUCTIONS THIS EVENING?
00:00:50.668: >> WE DO NOT.
00:00:51.369: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ANY CHANGES TO THE AGENDA? ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] BEFORE US WE HAVE THE MINUTES OF DECEMBER 17TH, 2019. DO WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE? ANY DISCUSSION OR CHANGES FROM THE MINUTES FROM DECEMBER 17TH? ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? AND THEY ARE APPROVED. WE MOVE ON TO REPORTS. WE'LL BEGIN WITH A REPORT FROM OUR CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:01:27.271: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO OUR BOARD AND ALL OF THE GUESTS. ALSO, I BELIEVE, HAPPY BIRTHDAY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:01:36.113: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS SOLD YOU OUT. ONLY TWO ITEMS OF NOTE FROM LAST NIGHT'S CITY COUNCIL MEETING RELEVANT TO THIS BODY. FIRST, AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD, THE CITY WAS MOVING TO ANNEX A LARGE NUMBER OF PARCELS IN ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP INTO THE CITY. THEY ARE WITHIN THE CITY'S ANNEXATION BOUNDARY, WHICH HAS BEEN OUR PRACTICE TO TRY TO ANNEX TOWNSHIP ISLANDS IN THAT AREA OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW DECADES. THE STATE BOUNDARY COMMISSION ACTUALLY RECENTLY VOTED TO REJECT ALL OF THOSE ANNEXATIONS. THE CITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT DID, THOUGH, VOTE TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE CITY ATTORNEY TO APPEAL THAT DECISION. RELEVANT TO THIS BODY IS REZONING UPON ANNEXATION WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR ALL OF THOSE PARCELS. THE OTHER ITEM -- [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ]. THE OTHER ITEM TO MENTION, WHICH WILL BE COMING TO PLANNING COMMISSION SOON IS THE ISSUE OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS. AIRBNB, VBRO, ARE ALL PRETTY DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS THAT HAVE REALLY CHANGED THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY, AND ANN ARBOR HAS EXPERIENCED A LOT OF CHANGE AS A RESULT, SOME LOCAL INVESTORS, SOME OUT OF TOWN INVESTORS, SOME RESIDENTS JUST RENTING OUT THEIR HOMES ON GAME DAY WEEKENDS, BUT, IN ANY CASE, IT'S TIME TO MOVE SOME REGULATIONS FORWARD. COUNCIL GAVE DIRECTION TO CITY STAFF AND SUBORDINATE BODIES LIKE THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO PURSUE A PARTICULAR SET OF -- OR A PARTICULAR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. THE ZONING COMPONENT OF THAT WILL BE COMING TO THIS BODY, AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE IT BACK TO COUNCIL BY JULY 30TH.
00:03:28.426: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  GREAT. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A REPORT FROM MR. LENART?
00:03:35.733: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WE DO NOT.
00:03:37.101: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. AND THEN VARIOUS CORRESPONDENCES TO THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE -- ONE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS WE RECEIVED IS FROM SCIO TOWNSHIP, GIVING US NOTICE THAT THEY ARE UPDATING THEIR MASTER PLAN. ALL RIGHT. AT THIS TIME, IT IS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS A TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON THE AGENDA FOR THIS EVENING. SO IF YOU HAVE AN ITEM THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA FOR THIS EVENING, YOU MAY STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:04:19.744: >> THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. TODAY, I REMEMBERED TO WEAR MY HEARING AIDS, BUT I WOULD -- I NEED ALL OF THE HELP THAT I CAN GET, SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IF ANY OF YOU USE YOUR MICROPHONES. SO FAR, I HAVE HEARD VERY LITTLE, SO THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY REQUEST. THANK YOU.
00:04:36.961: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING?
00:04:43.834: >> BY THE WAY. THIS IS NOT ON.
00:04:45.736: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I BELIEVE WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, WE'LL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING. WE HAVE TWO ITEMS THAT ARE -- OR ONE NEW ITEM AND ONE RETURNING ITEM, FISCAL YEAR 2021 THROUGH 2026 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN FOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL, AND THE MICHIGAN GOVERNMENT AND SCHOOLS CREDIT UNION WILL ALSO BE RETURNING TO THE MEETING, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22ND AT 7:00 P.M. ALL RIGHT. AND MOVING ON TO REGULAR BUSINESS, THE FIRST ITEM BEFORE US, 9A, IS THE STANDARD AT ANN ARBOR SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THE PETITIONER WILL ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THEY WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE BOARD. FROM THERE, WE'LL GET A STAFF REPORT, A PUBLIC HEARING, AND THEN WE'LL GO TO DISCUSSION. SO, I WILL HAND IT OVER TO THE PETITIONER.
00:05:48.098: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME. I'LL DO MY BEST. MY NAME IS JOHN, AND WE ARE HERE TO PRESENT THE STANDARD. THE SITE ITSELF, I THINK EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH, BUT IT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE CURRENT OR FORMER DTE SITE, AND IT SITS BETWEEN WILLIAMS, MAIN, AND PACKARD, AND TO THE EAST SIDE THE ALLEY ACTUALLY DIVIDES THE SITE. WE ARE GLAD TO BE HERE. IT'S BEEN KIND OF A LONG ROAD. WE HAVE SIX OR SEVEN, I WAS TRYING TO COUNT, NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS. SO WE HAVE REALLY USED THAT PROCESS, AS I THINK WE ALWAYS DO, TO BENEFIT THE PROJECT AND TRY TO GET INPUT FROM EVERYBODY. AND I THINK FOR THE MOST PART WE HAVE DEFINITELY TRIED TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS AS WE HAVE GONE AROUND THE PROPERTY AND HAVE GONE OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME. THEY HAVE, AS I THINK JEFF DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN THE REPORT, KIND OF VARIED FROM SMALL ISSUES TO LARGER ISSUES, AND AS WE WORKED THROUGH EACH DIFFERENT SCHEME THAT WE LOOKED AT, WE KEPT TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. SOME WERE SUBTLE. SOME WERE LARGER. TYPICALLY, A LOT HAD TO DO WITH THE WAY THE ALLEY WAS WORKING, HOW WE WERE GOING TO PROVIDE FOR, FOR INSTANCE, FOR AMAZON TO MAKE A DELIVERY FOR PACKAGES, HOW WE HAD INGRESS AND EGRESS OUT OF THE PROPERTY, AND SO I'LL KIND OF WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE A RESULT OF THAT. OKAY, FIRST THING, WHICH BUTTON MAKES IT ADVANCE? I TRIED THAT. OKAY. LET'S TRY IT OUT.
00:07:23.227: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  IS THERE A MOUSE UP THERE?
00:07:24.261: >> YEAH.
00:07:33.070: >> THERE'S THE MOUSE. [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ] [ LAUGHTER ].
00:07:36.473: >> IT'S OKAY, I CAN TALK FAST, BUT -- IT'S NOT THESE. OKAY. BEAUTIFUL. SOMETIMES TECHNOLOGY IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE WANT TO MAKE IT. JUST REALLY QUICK, THE TEAM INTRODUCTION IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REALLY RUN THROUGH, BUT WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE JASON AND ERIC HERE FROM LAND MARK PROPERTIES, AND IF ANY QUESTIONS COME UP, THEY CAN ADDRESS THOSE. I'LL TRY TO TAKE IT ON THE ARCHITECTURAL SIDE, BUT I HAVE JOSH FROM OUR OFFICE AS WELL. HE'S THE ASSOCIATE IN CHARGE OF THE PROJECT, AND SCOTT AND JONATHAN ARE HERE AS OUR CIVIL ENGINEERS, AND SCOTT WILL PROBABLY ADDRESS SOMETHING ONCE I KIND OF RUN THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF THE ARCHITECTURE. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TOO FAR TO FIND OUR STRUCTURAL ENGINEER, WHICH WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH. IT'S DARVIS AND ASSOCIATES, AND IT IS ACTUALLY BOB DARVIS, WHO WAS MY PROFESSOR IN SCHOOL, AND HE'S STILL ACTIVELY WORKING, AND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK TOO FAR, BECAUSE, AS I AM SURE MANY OF YOU FAMILIAR, HE'S RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE SITE. LAND MARK HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL COMPANY TO WORK WITH AND WORK FOR. I FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE EMBRACED THE TEAM ASPECT. I CAN TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, THEY ARE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER DEVELOPERS.  THEY HAVE A WHOLE PHILOSOPHY ABOUT THE WAY A PROJECT IS BUILT, NOT ONLY FROM THE DESIGN PERSPECTIVE, THEY HAVE ARCHITECTS ON BOARD. THEY HAVE AN INCREDIBLE CONSTRUCTION TEAM ON BOARD. WHAT IT REALLY MEANS FOR US AND FOR THE COMMUNITY IS A PROJECT IS VERY WELL THOUGHT THROUGH BEFORE IT EVEN COMES TO YOU OR BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS CONSTRUCTION, SO WE HAVE BEEN REALLY ACTIVE, KIND OF GOING BACK AND FORTH AS WE HAVE WORKED THROUGH THE PROCESS. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPERTIES THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE, YOU KNOW, ALMOST FIVE -- JUST A LITTLE OVER 5 BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT WITH OVER 60 PROPERTIES. THEY ARE BASED IN ATHENS, GEORGIA, BUT THEY DO WORK ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THE SITE ITSELF REALLY, I THINK, IS KIND OF DIVIDED INTO THIS HALF BLOCK PARCEL, AS I HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT, WITH FRONTING THE BULK OF IT FRONTING ON MAIN STREET. AS JEFF'S REPORT KIND OF ALLUDED TO, IN 2015, THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE ZONING THAT EFFECTIVELY TOOK IT FROM D1 TO D2 AND ALLOWED FOR A TOWER ELEMENT TO BE PLACED AT THE CORNER WITH A LOWER SCALE ELEMENT KIND OF FOLLOWING THE REST OF THE PROPERTY ON THE SITE. BASICALLY, WE ARE MEETING THOSE TWO DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS, 120 FEET AND 60 FEET FOR THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT, AND WE TRY TO FIND A WAY TO WORK THE ARCHITECTURE SO THAT IT WOULD BREAK IT UP ALONG SOME OF THE LONGER FACADES, WHICH, FOR THE MOST PART, ARE REALLY THE MAIN STREET FACADE. THE PROJECT, FROM A PARKING PERSPECTIVE, IN KIND OF THINKING THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS FROM A FIRST FLOOR PERSPECTIVE, AS YOU SEE HERE, IS ALL OF THE KIND OF ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PARKING ARE KIND OF BASICALLY LOCATED IN THE BACK OF THE BUILDING ON THE ALLEY, AND THEN ON THE THREE STREET FRONTS, THERE IS EFFECTIVELY ACTIVE ARCHITECTURE, WHETHER IT'S RETAIL, HOUSING, OR LOBBIES, THEY ARE REALLY LOCATED ON THOSE FLOORS, OR I MEAN ON THAT LEVEL, AND THEY REINFORCE THAT STREET FRONT. WE THEN TRIED TO RETURN THE RETAIL, AND SOME OF THOSE USES, AS MUCH INTO THE ALLEY AS WE COULD SO THAT THAT KIND OF HARD CORNER WOULD SOFTEN UP WITH SOME ACTIVITY. THE PARKING HAS TWO ACCESS POINTS TO IT. THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH AS FAR NORTH AND AS FAR SOUTH, AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THE PARKING STACKS ON TWO LEVELS, AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET YOU IN AT TWO DIFFERENT POINTS. THE MAIN REASON IS SO THAT THE TRAFFIC IS KIND OF PUSHED AS FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER ON THE ALLEY ITSELF WHEN THERE IS INGRESS AND EGRESS GOING IN AND OUT OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE. IT KIND OF WALKS YOU THROUGH THAT. AS YOU GO UP, YOU EFFECTIVELY GET TO A LEVEL THAT HAS THIS AMENITY LEVEL LOCATED ON IT, AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT, AND AS WE GO UP EVEN FURTHER, IT TURNS INTO THE TOWER ELEMENT. THE TOWER ELEMENT IS SOMEWHAT OF A U-SHAPED BUILDING, BUT FROM THE STREET FRONT, I THINK IT HAS THE PRESENCE OF KIND OF A LARGER, TALLER BUILDING.  AND THAT REALLY TAKES US INTO THE COURTYARD AMENITIES, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THOSE TWO LITTLE CREVASSES. THE FIRST ONE LOOKS TO THE ALLEY SIDE IN SOMEWHAT AN OVERLOOK THAT LOOKS TO THE EAST, AND AS WE GO THROUGH SOME OF THOSE AMENITIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN THOSE, THEY ALSO RECUR, AND I'M TRYING TO GO THROUGH THESE FAST. YOU CAN ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS, BUT TIME IS LIMITED. THE MAIN AMENITY DECK, WHICH HAS A SMALL HOT TUB POOL LOCATED ON IT, IS LOCATED ON THE ACTUAL MAIN STREET SIDE, SO IT ACTUALLY LOOKS TO THE WEST, AND THE OTHER ONE ACTUALLY PEEKED TO THE EAST, AND THAT HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT AMENITIES BUT MAINLY FOR THE RESIDENTS TO HAVE A PLACE TO KIND OF MEET AND GREET THAT'S OUTSIDE. IT COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM HANGING OUT IN HAMMOCKS TO PLAYING PING-PONG. ALL OF THAT IS KIND OF RECESSED VERY FAR BACK. WE HAVE DONE TREES ON EITHER SIDE OF A TRELLIS ELEMENT, WHICH ARE PROBABLY ACTUALLY WHAT YOU WOULD SEE A LITTLE BIT OF FROM THE STREET SIDE. THERE YOU ARE GETTING A VIEW OUT FROM THE STREET. ANOTHER VIEW OF THAT, TRYING TO CONCEAL BASICALLY THE ACTIVITIES, KIND OF FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYBODY. I'LL LET SCOTT REALLY QUICKLY ONE THROUGH ANY QUESTIONS HE HAS, AND THEN I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO JUMP INTO THE ARCHITECTURE, BUT WHY DON'T YOU FIRST TAKE IT ON THE CIVIL SIDE, SCOTT.
00:13:08.305: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS SCOTT BETSELL. WE ARE THE SURVEYORS AND ENGINEERS FOR THIS SITE PLAN FOR THIS EXCITING NEW PROJECT. USUALLY, I HAVE A BIGGER ROLE IN PROJECTS, BUT THIS IS REALLY A VERY URBAN TYPE OF A PROJECT, WHERE THE BUILDING IS THE BIG SHOW AND FILLING PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE SITE. THE SITE ITSELF IS 1.16 ACRES, AS YOU ARE AWARE. THERE IS AN EXISTING BUILDING THERE THAT WOULD BE REMOVED. THAT WAS BUILT IN 1982, AND IT'S ABOUT 64,000 SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE ON THREE STORIES. IT HAS A GARDEN LEVEL AND THEN TWO STORIES ABOVEGROUND. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AT THE SITE. IT WASN'T REQUIRED AT THE TIME, AND THERE IS ABOUT 41 SPACES OF SURFACE PARKING RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO NATURAL FEATURES ON THIS SITE THAT ARE -- AT ALL THAT WOULD BE REMOVED OR THAT EVEN EXIST. STREET TREES ARE THE ONLY REAL VEGETATION. SOME WILL BE REMOVED ON PACKARD. SOME WILL BE RETAINED. UTILITIES, IT'S REALLY WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE IN THIS CASE. WE HAVE NEW UTILITIES THAT SURROUND THE SITE. THERE IS NO OFFSITE UTILITIES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED, SO WE ARE GOING TO BE REMOVING SOME EXISTING OLD LEADS THAT EXTEND OUT INTO MAIN AND PACKARD THAT WILL GET BAND-AID TREATMENT. THE PERIMETER AROUND ALL SIDES WILL AT LEAST, WITH ONE LANE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING AND AN ADDITIONAL CURB BE REMILLED AND RESURFACED AT THE COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT. WE WILL BE PROVIDING STORMWATER MANAGEMENT IN THE FORM OF UNDERGROUND DETENTION TO TODAY'S STANDARDS, AND TRAFFIC, THEY WILL BE GENERATING SOME TRAFFIC, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT TRAFFIC, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S THERE EXISTING AS WELL. SO, EXISTING RIGHT NOW, THIS OFFICE HAS A CAPACITY TO HOUSE 160-180 EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PROBABLY MOST ALL COMMUTERS. THE TYPE OF LIFESTYLE THAT IS GOING TO BE ENJOYED BY MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE, WE EXPECT TO SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH LIMITED VEHICLES, AND SO WE ARE PROVIDING 102 SPACES, 90 ON THE TWO DECKS AND THEN SOME SURFACE PARKING IN THE REAR. WE DON'T EXPECT TO SEE, AND THE CITY STAFF CONCURS, ANY REAL DEMONSTRATED CHANGE IN TRAFFIC, AND IT ACTUALLY MAY EVEN BE LIGHTER DURING THE PEAK-HOUR PERIODS BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF CLIENTELE THAT THIS BUILDING MAY HAVE VERSUS THE TYPE THAT COMMUTE IN EVERY DAY AT 8:00 AND LEAVE AT 5:00 EVERY DAY. SO, THE TRAFFIC HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE. AS I SAID, THE CITY HAS APPROVED OUR PLAN. WE EVALUATED -- WE EXPECT A LOT OF PEDESTRIAN MOVEMENT, SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME, REALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER, DOING A FULL-BLOWN PEDESTRIAN MOBILITY TYPE OF AN INVESTIGATION, LOOKING AT CROSSWALK TIMING, OF ALL THINGS. LIKE, IS IT GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR THE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE? THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME OVER 400 BEDS, AND THOSE PEOPLE -- AND PRESUMABLY MIGRATING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS, PREDOMINANTLY PROBABLY TWO DIRECTIONS. SO WE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT THAT, AND WE HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR SOME MINOR CROSSWALK SIGNAL ADJUSTMENTS. I THINK THE CITY HAS PROBABLY TAKEN THOSE AND WILL PROBABLY EVALUATE THOSE ON A WAIT AND SEE TYPE OF BASIS. LANDSCAPING, AS YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN, IS REALLY LIMITED TO STREET TREES. WE HAVE A LITTLE LESS THAN A DOZEN NEW STREET TREES IN RAISED BED PLANTERS AND CAST IRON SURFACE GRATES. A BIG IMPROVEMENT WILL BE THE STREETSCAPE ALONG WILLIAMS STREET. WE HAVE PULLED THE BUILDING BACK AN ADDITIONAL -- HOW MANY FEET?
00:17:12.182: >> SEVEN.
00:17:12.949: >> SEVEN AND A HALF FEET TO ALLOW FOR 16 FEET CLEAR.
00:17:16.786: >> CORRECT.
00:17:17.120: >> THAT WOULD AFFORD THE ABILITY TO HAVE SOME SIDEWALK CAFE AND JUST MORE ROOM FOR PEDESTRIANS. OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOME MORE PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY AT THIS CORNER THAN THERE HAS BEEN IN THE PAST, SINCE THIS OFFICE BUILDING HAS EXISTED. SO THAT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT. ALL IN ALL, I THINK WE ARE PRETTY HAPPY WITH THIS PROJECT. WE THINK THAT IT IS A NICE BENEFIT TO DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. WE'LL BE ADDING THE SIDEWALK ON WILLIAMS TO ENHANCE THE STREETSCAPE, PROVIDING STORMWATER MANAGEMENT THAT DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW, ENHANCING THE ALLEYWAY IN THE BACK WITH LANDSCAPE AND RESURFACING, AND OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE HEARD THE L.E.E.D. BENEFITS, SOLAR, AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:18:02.766: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. KHAN, DO YOU HAVE A STAFF REPORT FOR US?
00:18:10.707: >> I JUST WANTED TO ADD A FEW OF THE DETAILS. AS WAS MENTIONED, 218 DWELLING UNITS ARE PROPOSED, WHICH INCLUDES 421 BEDROOMS OF A VARIETY OF TYPES, STUDIOS, ONES, TWOS, THREES AND FOUR BEDROOMS. AS SCOTT MENTIONED, 90 OF THE PARKING SPACES ARE PROPOSED TO BE BELOW STRUCTURE. WE ARE ALSO SEEING A TOTAL OF 84 BICYCLE PARKING SPACES PROPOSED, AND ABOUT 6,500 SQUARE FEET OF GROUND FLOOR RETAIL THAT WILL FRONT ALONG WILLIAM. I ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT PETITIONER IS GETTING 200% OF THEIR FLOOR AREA FROM THE STANDARD ALLOWABLE FLOOR AREA FOR THE D2. THE RESIDENTIAL AREA ALLOWS PREMIUMS TO ADD ANOTHER 75% OF THAT. A GREEN BUILDING PREMIUM ALLOWS SOME ADDITIONAL SQUARE FOOTAGE, AND AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM FOR TWO DWELLING UNITS WILL ADD AN ADDITIONAL 6,000 SQUARE FEET OF FLOOR AREA. I DO WANT TO MAKE MENTION THAT THE PETITIONER HAS ATTENDED THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. ON DECEMBER 19TH, 2018, THE PETITIONER PRESENTED THEIR INITIAL PROJECT AND RECEIVED A NUMBER OF COMMENTS. SINCE THEN, THE PETITIONER HAS HIRED THE ARCHITECTS FROM CHICAGO, WHO CAME UP WITH A DIFFERENT CONCEPT. THEY ATTEMPTED TO BREAK UP THE FACADE INTO SMALLER COMPONENTS AND REVISED THE FACADE ALONG SOUTH MAIN STREET TO REMOVE SOME OF THE CAVE-LIKE STRUCTURES, COMPLETELY REVISED THE FACADE ALONG PACKARD SO IT'S NOW PARALLEL WITH THE SIDEWALK, AND ADDITIONALLY THE REVISED PLAN USED BUILDING MATERIALS CONSISTENT WITH CITY CODE, SUCH AS BRICK, METAL AND GLASS. THE PETITIONER PRESENTED REVISED PLANS TO THE DRB ON NOVEMBER 13TH AND RECEIVED COMMENT. THE PETITIONER ADDRESSED MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY ENLARGING WINDOW OPENINGS, CREATING GREATER WINDOW CONTRAST, CREATING MORE SYMMETRICAL WINDOW PATTERNING, AGREEING TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC ART AND WORKING WITH US ON COLOR. THE PETITIONER DID AGREE TO WORK WITH US TO ACCOMMODATE PUBLIC ART IN POTENTIALLY A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS, AND I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO US. THE PETITIONER AGREED TO SHIFT THE BUILDING 7.5 FEET SOUTH FROM WILLIAM STREET TO ACCOMMODATE A 16-FOOT WIDE SIDEWALK. THAT WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR STAFF, WHICH WANTED TO ACCOMMODATE PEDESTRIANS, LANDSCAPING, AND DOORS THAT MIGHT BE OPENING UP, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR OUTDOOR CAFES, TO CREATE A VERY SPECIAL PLACE, AND THE PETITIONER AGREED TO ACCOMMODATE THAT, WHICH WAS A BIG DEAL AND A BIG CHANGE FOR THEM. SO WE DO WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THAT. STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROVAL OF THE SITE PLAN, BECAUSE IT COMPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL ORDINANCES, STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS. IT WILL NOT CAUSE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE NUISANCE AND WILL NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE.
00:21:46.256: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE CAN ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES. PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION.
00:22:09.045: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS ETHEL POTTS AT 1939 JACKSON AVENUE. I ATTENDED AND I SPOKE AT SOME OF THE PUBLIC MEETINGS, AT LEAST ONE OF THE PUBLIC MEETINGS ON THIS DEVELOPMENT BACK A WAYS, AND SOME OF THE -- A FAIR NUMBER OF THE NEIGHBORS WERE ALSO PRESENT, BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN IMPROVED IN THIS, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL. THE ONLY CAR ACCESS TO THIS BIG BUILDING IS STILL THE ALLEY, WHICH IS SHARED WITH THE RESIDENTS OF THE HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD ACROSS THE ALLEY. THESE ARE HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL HOMES. ACCESSING THE 102 PARKING SPACES IN THE PROPOSED BUILDING, WHICH IS OFF OF A 16 TO 18-FOOT WIDE ALLEY, THIS WON'T WORK. GARBAGE TRUCKS ARE NOW PLANNED TO BE ADDED TO THE CARS, THE DELIVERY TRUCKS, MOVING VANS, AND THESE ARE ALL BLOCK NEIGHBORS FROM ACCESS TO THEIR GARAGES AND BACKYARDS. THEY WILL REALLY BLOCK THE ALLEY IF THEY BACK UP OR TRY TO TURN AROUND. THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS THREE MAJOR STREETS ON THREE SIDES, BUT IS PROPOSING FOR AN ALLEY AS THE ONLY CAR ACCESS TO THE BUILDING. THIS D2 -- THERE IS A D2 ZONING CHARACTER OVERLAY FOR MAIN STREET, AND THIS REQUIRES THE PROPOSED BUILDING TO BE NO LESS THAN 30 FEET FROM RESIDENTIAL ZONING. THE HISTORIC DISTRICT RESIDENTIAL ZONING IS ONLY THE WIDTH OF THE ALLEYWAY, ONLY ABOUT 18 FEET, WHICH VIOLATES THIS CODE. ALSO, CONSIDERING THE FRONTAGE OF THESE THREE MAJOR STREETS, MAIN, PACKARD, AND WILLIAM, THE NUMBER OF TREES BEING PROPOSED IS QUITE MEASLY. WHY DON'T YOU WANT MORE TREES ALONG THESE IMPORTANT STREETS? AND OUT OF 218 DWELLING UNITS, ONLY TWO ARE PROPOSED AS AFFORDABLE. WHY DON'T YOU WANT MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS?
00:24:20.109: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:24:25.048: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS -- I LIVE AT 451 SOUTH 4th AVENUE, AND I WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS ON AN EVERYDAY BASIS, AND THERE ARE MANY WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THIS DESIGN, AND I DON'T WANT TO QUESTION ANY OF THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST CONTINUE WHAT MRS. POTTS HAS SAID ABOUT THE ALLEYWAY. I THINK THIS IS A DISASTER. I SENT OUT A NOTE, SO I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. IT SEEMS TO ME, I LOOKED AT THE TRAFFIC EVALUATION, IT SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE MAIN ISSUES, WHICH IS THAT THE ENTRANCE ON ONE SIDE IS NOW ON A STREET THAT ONLY HAS TWO SINGLE LANES AND A BICYCLE PATH, BECAUSE THE BICYCLE PATH WAS NOT PLANNED AT THE TIME THAT THIS WAS PLANNED. THERE ARE NO TURN LANES ON EAST WILLIAM, AND IT'S RIGHT OPPOSITE THE ENTRANCE TO THE FOURTH STREET GARAGE. IT'S A DISASTER IN THE MAKING. RIGHT NOW, THE STREET IS BACKING UP, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TURN LANES, AND THE OTHER THING IS, ON THE OTHER SIDE IS PACKARD, WHICH, IF YOU LIVE IN THE AREA, YOU KNOW ALMOST EVERY DAY, JUST AROUND THE PLACE WHERE THIS COMES OUT, IS FILLED WITH FIRE TRUCKS AND AMBULANCES GOING TO BAKER COMMONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE EMERGENCIES THERE, SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY. SO, AND THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HAVING JUST AN ENTRYWAY AND EXIT INTO AN ALLEYWAY IN THE BACK IS A DISASTER. THERE ARE GOING TO BE UBERS GOING IN AND OUT. YOU SAY THERE ARE ONLY GOING TO BE A FEW CARS. FIRST OF ALL, I THINK YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL STILL OWN CARS. BUT LET'S SAY THAT MOST OF THESE KIDS DON'T HAVE CARS. THERE ARE GOING TO BE UBERS GOING IN AND OUT, PIZZA DELIVERIES ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT, ALL OF THIS RIGHT UNDER THE NOSES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ALLEY, BUT ALSO CREATING ALL SORTS OF CONFUSION, AND I HAVE A FEELING A LOT OF -- PEDESTRIANS. SO I WISH THIS WOULD BE RETHOUGHT IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S GOING ON, AND PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT EAST WILLIAM RIGHT NOW WITH TWO SINGLE LANES WITH NO TURNS ON TO MAIN STREET. IT'S BLOCKING UP EVEN, YOU KNOW, ON A NORMAL DAY. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN DURING RUSH HOUR? THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE PEOPLE LIVING THERE WHO ARE GOING TO BE GOING IN AND OUT, BUT THERE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE DELIVERY TRUCKS. LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED AT THAT BIG BUILDING ON HURON, WHERE ONE LANE OF HURON IS ALWAYS BLOCKED BY DELIVERY TRUCKS, AND SO FORTH. SO, PLEASE, CONSIDER THAT. THERE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE TRUCKS BLOCKING THE ALLEYWAY THAT DELIVER THINGS TO THE BEER VAULT, ET CETERA.  SO I THINK THAT THIS IS THE MAKING OF A DISASTER. THANK YOU.
00:27:17.787: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:27:21.124: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M CHRIS CROCKETT. I LIVE AT 506 EAST KINGSLEY.
00:27:30.266: >> WE CAN'T HEAR YOU.
00:27:32.535: >> I HAVE BEEN TO EVERY SINGLE MEETING ABOUT THIS BUILDING, AND THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS MADE, BUT IT STILL COULD BE BETTER. IT IS A DISMAL GRAY AMIDST SOME BEAUTIFUL WARM BRICK BUILDINGS. I WAS HOPING THAT AT THIS NOTEWORTHY CORNER, THE DESIGNERS OF THE BUILDING COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS MORE IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT OF ANN ARBOR. THIS IS NOT. IT'S UGLY. THE COLOR IS UGLY, AND I HOPE THAT THAT CAN BE CHANGED. I TOO SHARE THE MISGIVINGS ABOUT FEWER CARS BEING USED. THIS IS A STUDENT DORMITORY. WHILE IT MAY BE TRUE THAT STUDENTS WILL MOVE HERE AND POSSIBLY WALK TO CLASSES AND WALK ELSEWHERE, BECAUSE THEY ARE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE, THAT'S NO GUARANTEE. HOWEVER, THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT THERE WILL BE A MULTITUDE OF DELIVERIES AND PICKUPS. I LIVE NEAR THE CORNER OF HURON AND STATE STREET AND DIVISION IN THE OLD FOURTH WARD HISTORIC DISTRICT. HURON IS IMPASSABLE. IMPASSABLE, EVERY MORNING AND EVERY EVENING, BECAUSE NO ONE EVER FACTORED IN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH ALL OF THE DELIVERIES, ALL OF THE UBERS, ALL OF THE LYFTS, AND ALL OF THE OTHER INCOMING AND OUTGOING TRAFFIC FROM THE HUGE STUDENT RESIDENCES IN THAT BLOCK ON HURON FROM STATE TO DIVISION. YOU CANNOT GET THROUGH. I'M USUALLY ON FOOT WHEN I'M DOWNTOWN. THERE ARE SOME RARE OCCASIONS WHERE I HAVE BEEN IN A CAR IN THE EVENING, AND IT TAKES FOREVER JUST TO GO AROUND THE BLOCK. THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM, AND ALREADY WE ARE SETTING OURSELVES UP FOR A HUGE PROBLEM AT THIS INTERSECTION, WHICH IS ALREADY MORE HEAVILY TRAFFICKED THAN THE AREA CLOSE TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I WENT TO THE DESIGN REVIEW MEETING, AND THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT PUBLIC ART. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE IS MENTION OF IT TONIGHT, BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING. THIS BUILDING REALLY CRIES OUT FOR SOMETHING TO MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL. PUBLIC ART IS THAT OPPORTUNITY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, AND WE STILL DON'T SEE IT TONIGHT. JOHN KATARSKI, WHO IS A NEW APPOINTEE TO THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD, ESPECIALLY EMPHASIZED THIS. SO I HOPE THAT PUBLIC ART IS DEFINITELY A PART OF THIS DESIGN. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF ACTIVATING THE ALLEYWAY. THAT ALLEYWAY COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS. PUBLIC ART COULD MITIGATE THAT.
00:30:29.045: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS PETITION? SEEING NO ONE -- OH. COME ON UP.
00:30:44.894: >> I'M DIANA. I LIVE AT 541 SOUTH FOURTH AVENUE. MY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN COVERED TONIGHT, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THERE ARE ONLY TWO AFFORDABLE UNITS WHEN THE CITY IS LOOKING TO DO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, TAKE AWAY PARKING IN KERRYTOWN, ET CETERA.  WE NEED MORE OF THOSE, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT ALL WORKS, BUT HOW ABOUT FOUR? AND THAT REALLY I HOPE THAT PEOPLE GO OVER THERE, AT WILLIAM AND FOURTH, AND WATCH THE BUSSES TRYING TO TURN INTO THE STATION AND THE BIKE LANE, WHICH IS A NICE IDEA, BUT IT'S GOING TO WREAK HAVOC. IT ALREADY HAS. I HAD TO BACK UP IN ORDER TO LET A BUS TURN A CORNER AT WILLIAM AND FIFTH JUST YESTERDAY. ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.
00:32:05.107: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:32:13.983: >> I WASN'T GOING TO DO THIS TONIGHT. KAREN WHITE, 2719 CRANBROOK, BUT I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS THAT ARE IN THE PRIME MARKET FOR THIS KIND OF HOUSING, ONE WHO LIVED AT THE PLACE AT THE CORNER OF HURON AND DIVISION, WHICH, INDEED, IS AS MISERABLE AS EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SAYING. IT'S EVEN MORE MISERABLE, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE A KID IN AND OUT. THERE IS NO PLACE TO PARK A VAN. THERE IS NO PLACE TO LOAD. I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT THE KIDS WHO ARE GOING TO LIVE IN THIS KIND OF BUILDING COULD JUST AS EASILY RECREATE ON THE ROOF, AND THAT YOU COULD DO A DRIVE RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THIS BEHEMOTH WITH FOUR LANES SO THAT THERE ARE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO PARK UNDERNEATH. YOU KNOW, JUST ESSENTIALLY A FIRST-FLOOR ARCH. AND THE BUILDING CAN JOIN UP ABOVE IT, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE SOME PLACE FOR LOTS OF VEHICLES TO STAND AND PICK UP PEOPLE AND IDLE AND LOAD, AND I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT IN THERE RIGHT NOW. SO, THANKS.
00:33:30.259: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE STANDARD AT ANN ARBOR SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. DO WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER WHO WILL MOVE? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
00:34:00.022: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND TO THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE COME OUT TO THE DEVELOPER FOR ALL OF THE REVISIONS AND OF COURSE TO STAFF FOR THE REVIEW. I GUESS, FIRST, I WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE TIME AND DILIGENCE THAT HAS GONE INTO REVISING THIS PLAN OVER THE YEARS NOW. I THINK THIS, THE INITIAL PLAN SET OFF A LOT MORE FLAGS THAN KIND OF MY SENSE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S POSITION NOW, WHICH I THINK IS A SIGN OF YOUR DILIGENCE, AND CHANGING ARCHITECTS MID-COURSE, I AM SURE, IS NOT CHEAP BUT APPRECIATED. I THINK I'M ALSO ENCOURAGED BY THE MIX OF UNIT TYPES IN THE BUILDING. IT'S REASSURING TO SEE THAT NEARLY 60% ARE TWO BEDROOMS AND BELOW. YOU KNOW, OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TEN YEARS, WE HAVE SEEN THE MODE OF CONSTRUCTION BEING THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX-BEDROOM UNITS, WHICH REALLY CATER TO A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE, WHICH IS STUDENTS. I THINK THIS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE A MUCH MORE DIVERSE AUDIENCE BY AGE. I THINK SOMETHING THAT I HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY IS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T MIND DEVELOPMENT BUT DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT WE SEE DOWNTOWN, IS GREAT, A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS; WHERE CAN I DOWNSIZE AS AN EMPTY NESTER? WHERE CAN MY KID MOVE BACK TO TOWN AND FIND HOUSING TO LIVE HERE AND WORK HERE? SO THAT'S -- THAT'S ENCOURAGING. I WANT TO TURN TO THE BUILDING DESIGN FIRST. I'M GLAD TO SEE, YOU KNOW, TWO PIECES OF, YOU KNOW, REGULATORY LEGISLATION WORKING THEIR WAY INTO REALITY NOW, FIRST THE 2015 REZONING. I THINK THAT WAS WISE AND PRUDENT, AND ALSO THE BUILDING MATERIALS. I THINK THE MATERIALS WE ARE GETTING HERE ARE MUCH BETTER, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, CHANGED AND AMENDED SINCE 2015. I THINK THE FIVE-STORY AND 60 FEET DOWN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THIS IS MUCH, MUCH IMPROVED FROM THE POTENTIAL 12 STORY THAT YOU WOULD SEE ACROSS THE BOARD, AND I KNOW THAT IT -- AS THAT WAS WORKING OUT, IT CHANGED THE SALE PRICE OF THE PROPERTY AS WELL. THE RUMORS THAT WERE CIRCULATING ABOUT HOW MUCH THIS PROPERTY SOLD FOR WERE ASTONISHING BEFORE I THINK SOME OF THOSE REALITIES CAUGHT BACK UP. I WANT TO FIRST ASK ABOUT THE COLORING. WE HAD A RESIDENT BRING THAT UP TONIGHT, AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT STANDS OUT TO ME AS WELL. COULD YOU -- COULD THE ARCHITECT MAYBE TALK US THROUGH THE PALETTE, HOW IT WAS SELECTED, AND I GUESS WHY IT'S DEFENSIBLE.
00:37:05.107: >> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK, YOU KNOW, JUST FIRST OF ALL, WHAT I CAN DO IS KIND OF PASS AROUND THE MATERIALS, SO EVERYBODY CAN GET A SENSE. I MEAN, FOR THE MOST PART, ALTHOUGH THE RENDERINGS SHOW ONE THING, I THINK THE REAL MATERIALS ARE USUALLY VERY HELPFUL. THE GLASS IS VERY KIND OF TYPICAL GLASS THAT YOU WOULD SEE. IT'S GOING TO BE REFLECTIVE, BUT IT GENERALLY TAKES ON A CHARACTER THAT'S GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO THIS, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY GREEN. IT'S BASICALLY JUST CLEAR GLASS. THE FRAMES AND THE STOREFRONT AND THE CURTAIN WALL AND THE WINDOWS, WHICH THIS BUILDING HAS ALL OF, IS VERY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT. IT'S NOT AN INEXPENSIVE FACADE WITH THE MATERIALS THAT ARE USED. IT WILL BE A DARK BRONZED METAL, LIKE YOU'RE SEEING HERE, AND WHERE YOU DO SEE A LIGHT SURFACE OR A COLORED SURFACE, IT'S PROBABLY EITHER THE OFF-WHITE OR THE SLIGHTLY BLUISH GRAY THAT YOU SEE WITH THIS COLOR, WHICH REALLY OCCURS KIND OF AT THE CORNER ELEMENTS, WHEN IT WRAPS AROUND, AND THEN ALSO AT SOME OF THE ENTRY ELEMENTS. A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE BUILDING IS THEN THIS COLOR, THE LIGHTER COLOR THAT WE SEE OF BRICK, OR WHAT WE WOULD SEE AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING, WHICH IS A DARKER BRICK. AND WHERE THE BUILDING HAS EVOLVED FROM IS IT PROBABLY WAS LIKE THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF THIS BEFORE, WHERE IT WAS VERY DARK, AND HAD LIGHTER ELEMENTS WITHIN IT, AND ONE OF THE REACTIONS THAT WE GOT FROM SEVERAL OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS CLEARLY WAS THAT IT WAS TOO DARK, AND WHEN IT WAS TOO DARK, I THINK THERE WS -- THERE WAS A REQUEST THAT WE INTRODUCE A COLOR. WE WENT THROUGH PROBABLY SIX DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF SUBMITTING DIFFERENT THINGS. WE DID WORK WITH STAFF IN SOME OF THOSE INTERIM MIDDLE STAGES, WHERE WE ALSO THEN WENT TO A SCHEME THAT KIND OF WENT A LITTLE MORE EARTH TONE AND GOT TO BE A LITTLE MORE TAN, AND THAT GENERALLY WASN'T WELL RECEIVED, BECAUSE -- AND THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL FOR US. WE COULD SEE WHERE THERE ARE OTHER BUILDINGS IN THE CITY THAT HAD DONE SOMETHING ELSE, AND AT THAT POINT IT ALMOST GETS TO BE A BLAND BUILDING, AND I THINK THAT WAS KIND OF SOME OF THE CONCERN. AND THEN SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE THAT CAME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING HAD ASKED US TO REALLY GO WITH VIBRANT COLORS. I DON'T MEAN THAT NEGATIVELY, BUT JUST TO REALLY TRY TO PUNCH IT OUT AND TO GIVE IT SOME COLOR, AND WE DID LOOK AT THAT, AND THAT RANGED FROM BEING A LOT OF REDS TO ORANGES TO GREENS, AND IT JUST SEEMED LIKE WAY TOO MUCH, AND SO WHERE WE SETTLED WAS KIND OF ON THIS SOFTER BLUER GRAY. I MEAN, I DON'T CONSIDER THIS A GRAY. IT DOES HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BLUE. YOU COULD SAY IT HAS A LITTLE LAVENDER. WE SETTLED ON THAT BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY IS A COLOR THAT LANDMARK HAS USED ON OTHER BUILDINGS VERY SUCCESSFULLY IN OTHER CITIES. SO IT'S NOT A TRADEMARK TO THEM, BUT IT IS A COLOR THAT THEY LIKE TO USE ON THEIR PROJECTS, AND AFTER GOING THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT SEQUENCES, HONESTLY, ALTHOUGH THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY PLEASE EVERYBODY, IT SEEMED TO PLEASE ALL OF US FROM THE DESIGN PERSPECTIVE, THAT WE WERE GETTING A NICE OVERALL PALETTE THAT WORKED, AND THERE WERE SEVERAL NEIGHBORS WHO WERE VERY HAPPY WITH IT AS WELL. BUT I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T THINK THERE IS A PERFECT ANSWER, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
00:40:19.101: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: UH-HUH, NO, I THINK THAT'S FAIR, AND I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE FAIRLY SUBJECTIVE, AND I DON'T CARE TO BE THE JUDGE OF THAT. I GUESS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET A SENSE OF HOW MUCH ENGAGEMENT OF THE NEIGHBORS THERE WAS, FOCUS GROUPING OR JUST INPUT, ABOUT THE COLOR PALETTE. WAS THIS DEVISED, YOU KNOW, BY LANDMARK IN CONSULTATION WITH STAFF? WHICH IS A VERY DIFFERENT OUTPUT THAN IN CONSULTATION WITH NEIGHBORS.
00:40:48.030: >> IT WAS DONE IN CONSULTATION WITH -- FIRST, IT WAS WITH THE NEIGHBORS, AND THEN WE WENT THROUGH STAFF TO SEE IF WE THOUGHT THAT THAT MIGHT WORK, AND THEN WE GOT FEEDBACK FROM THE NEIGHBORS THAT THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY STILL HAPPY WITH IT. AND I THINK CHRIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST REPRESENTATIVE FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. SHE WAS VERY OUTSPOKEN, AND I UNDERSTAND HER PERSPECTIVE A HUNDRED PERCENT, AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY TRIED TO ADDRESS IT. YOU KNOW, INITIALLY, WHERE WE STARTED IS THERE WAS A FEELING IT WAS SUPER DARK, AND THERE JUST WASN'T A NEED FOR ANOTHER DARK BUILDING, AND IT IS A CONFUSING PROCESS BECAUSE SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO CAME OUT WHO DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE DARK THEN FOUND OUT THAT WE HAD DONE THE HUB BUILDING, AND THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS DARK, BUT THAT WAS CLOSE TO WHAT WE HAD. SO IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO FIND THAT RIGHT BALANCE. I THINK A REAL BUILDING VERSUS A RENDERING IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, AND ONCE YOU HAVE A CHANCE -- THIS IS OUR JOB. THIS IS WHAT WE DO. THIS IS WHAT WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN. WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THAT PERFECT BALANCE, BUT IN THE END, IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO KIND OF THE WAY THAT WE DETAIL IT AND PUT IT TOGETHER. SO, ABSOLUTELY, THERE WAS INVOLVEMENT BACK AND FORTH, AND WE SHARED THESE DRAWINGS BACK AND FORTH, BUT I'M NOT HERE TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE CHRIS IS HAPPY WITH WHERE WE ENDED UP.
00:41:57.099: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  FAIR ENOUGH. OKAY. AND I WOULD BE -- ACTUALLY, CAN YOU HOLD UP THE BRICK AGAIN? IS THAT THE FULL DEPTH, OR IS THAT JUST A SAMPLE?
00:42:06.975: >> THESE ARE THE FULL SIZED BRICKS. THEY ARE JUST NORMAL SIZED BRICKS. WE ARE NOT DOING JUMBO BRICKS OR ANYTHING STRANGE.
00:42:15.484: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  AND THE DEPTH OF IT, IS IT JUST PANELLING?
00:42:19.154: >> IT'S A FULL DEPTH BRICK APPLIED ON PANEL WITH A MORTAR JOINT. THE FIRST TWO STORIES ARE REGULAR EMBEDDED BRICK LIKE YOU SEE HERE ON THE WALL.
00:42:30.465: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  AND I'M CURIOUS, THERE'S A QUESTION FOR THE ARCHITECTS ON THE COMMISSION ABOUT THE DARK COLOR AT GROUND LEVEL AND KIND OF HOW DOES THAT CREATE A WELCOMING OR, YOU KNOW, OPEN PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE, SO A QUESTION TO YOU ALL, IF YOU CARE TO ANSWER LATER. ON THE PARKING, I DO SEE THIS AS A NET BENEFIT, IF THIS IS JUST 102 CARS. THAT'S BETTER THAN THE NUMBER OF COMMUTERS CURRENTLY ON THE LOT, SO I DO SEE IT AS A NET BENEFIT. I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE E.V.s. ARE THERE ANY INCENTIVES TO PUTTING IN E.V.s? DO THEY COUNT AS GREATER NUMBER OF SPACES? IS THERE ANY MATERIAL ADVANTAGE IN INCLUDING E.V.?
00:43:19.281: >> SHARED PARKING IS INCENTIVIZED, BECAUSE THEY CAN COUNT ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES TOWARD MEETING THEIR REQUIREMENT, BUT CURRENTLY NOT E.V. SPACES.
00:43:28.490: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. I THINK THAT IS A GOOD ONE FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT AS WELL. AND THEN IS THE REST OF THE STRUCTURE WIRED FOR E.V. SHOULD THE SWEEPING REVOLUTION COME?
00:43:38.567: >> YES, YES.
00:43:39.668: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  ALL RIGHT.
00:43:40.736: >> WE WORKED WITH LANDMARK TO FIND THAT RIGHT BALANCE, SO THE FOUR IS REALLY WHAT THEY THINK THEY NEED NOW, BUT WE ARE ACTUALLY PUTTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN WITHIN THE ELECTRICAL TO PROVIDE FOR IT IN THE FUTURE. WE JUST HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO RUN IT. SO WE DON'T WANT TO JUST RUN THE CONDUIT TO SOME RANDOM PLACE. WE'D RATHER LEAVE THE ABILITY FOR THAT FUTURE TO BE THERE. SO WE ARE FUTURE PROOFING IT BY TAPPING INTO THE PANELS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT AND HAVE IT AT BOTH LEVELS ON THE PARKING STRUCTURE.
00:44:09.197: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  COOL. WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, SOLAR PANELS, I COULDN'T FIND THE PLAN FOR THE ROOF IN THIS SITE PLAN. WAS THAT PROVIDED? DID ANYONE ELSE FIND THAT?
00:44:19.141: >> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS -- WAS THAT IN THE SUBMITTAL, JOSH? YEAH, I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN THERE.
00:44:26.882: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  DO YOU KNOW WHICH SHEET?
00:44:28.550: >> IT WOULD BE ON THE ARCHITECTURAL PLANS.
00:44:30.452: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OH, OKAY. SO IN OUR PACKET, WHAT WOULD THAT BE UNDER? YOU DIDN'T SEE IT EITHER? OKAY. I THINK SO -- OKAY. SOMETHING THAT --
00:44:48.103: >> THE FIRST, FIRST PAGE.
00:44:50.372: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: FIRST, FIRST PAGE.
00:44:52.274: >> YEAH, RIGHT THERE.
00:44:53.942: >> ARCHITECTURAL PLANS, SO THE NUMBER OF --
00:44:57.012: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OH, YEAH. SO 1 PERCENT OF ANNUAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS GOING TO COME FROM THIS NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE BUILDING. CAN YOU TALK THROUGH -- I MEAN, THAT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF SURFACE AREA PROVIDING, YOU KNOW, A SMALL AMOUNT OF YOUR ELECTRICAL CONSUMPTION. CAN YOU TALK THROUGH ANY INTEREST IN EXPANDING THAT?
00:45:21.603: >> WELL, I THINK IN THE AREA THAT'S SHOWN RIGHT NOW IS THE SMALLEST THAT WE CAN MAKE IT TO ACHIEVE THE 1%. IT ACTUALLY COULD FLUCTUATE UP TO TWICE THAT SIZE, DEPENDING ON WHICH PHOTOVOLTAIC PANEL THAT WE END UP GOING WITH. WE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE A LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM WITH THAT. FOR US, THE REAL ISSUE IS WE NEED THE MAJORITY OF THIS ROOF FOR THE MECHANICAL UNITS. WE HAVEN'T SHOWN THAT UP THERE, AND THAT'S PREDOMINANTLY WHERE OUR PROBLEM COMES IN. WE HAVE LIMITED SURFACE TO PUT IT. ON THE LOWER LEVEL ROOF, WE CAN'T PLACE IT, BECAUSE IT CAN'T PROJECT ABOVE THE 60-FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT. THIS IS A UNIQUE PROBLEM IN ANN ARBOR. THIS ACTUALLY IS A VERY UNIQUE BUILDING. THE FIFTH FLOOR YOU CAN'T GET TO WITH AN ELEVATOR FROM ONE OF OUR LOBBIES. WE ARE VERY LUCKY IN THAT THERE IS A TOWER NEXT TO IT SO THAT THAT ELEVATOR CAN GET TO IT. ANN ARBOR HAS, WHATEVER THE HEIGHT IS, IS A GLASS CEILING THAT NOTHING CAN KIND OF GO THROUGH. YOU COULD SAY, WELL, JUST PUSH YOUR BUILDING DOWN, BUT IT'S ALREADY A FIVE-STORY BUILDING AND 60 FEET. THAT'S A PRETTY REASONABLE EXPECTATION.
00:46:24.933: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: RIGHT, NO, I THINK THAT'S A --
00:46:27.435: >> WE HAVE PUT A CONDUIT IN, AND WE WOULD FUTURE-PROOF TWO DIFFERENT PLACES FOR THE LOWER ROOF, SHOULD ANN ARBOR REVISE ITS RULES, WHICH WE UNDERSTAND MIGHT POSSIBLY HAPPEN.
00:46:37.846: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY, YEAH, I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ITEM THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT, IS WAIVING SOLAR PANELS BEING CONSIDERED PART OF HEIGHT, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE JUST KICKING OURSELVES. I SEE A COUPLE OF OTHER COMMISSIONERS ITCHING TO ASK QUESTIONS. I'LL LEAVE IT THERE. OTHER CONCERNS ARE AROUND ALLEY AND ACCESS, AND THEN SOME QUESTIONS AROUND ART AND PARKS, BUT I WANT TO SHARE THE FLOOR.
00:47:01.603: >> AND JUST ON THE 1%, TOO, I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF SUSTAINABILITY, SINCE, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY HAD MENTIONED THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE GREATER NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT IS CURRENTLY GOING TO BE REQUIRED, THAT'S BECAUSE THIS PROJECT HAD ALREADY BEEN STARTED BEFORE THAT WAS PASSED, BUT IT DOES INCLUDE L.E.E.D. SILVER, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT NOT GET IF YOU CHOSE THE AFFORDABLE OPTION. SO IT'S A GIVE AND TAKE, SO I IMAGINE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF IT, JUST AS THE SOLAR IS. THE SOLAR IS A GREAT THING TO FOCUS ON, BUT TO ACHIEVE L.E.E.D. SILVER, WHICH IS NOT EASY -- CERTIFIED IS PRETTY REASONABLE FOR A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING, BUT SILVER IS NOT EASY FOR A BUILDING LIKE THIS. IT IS ALL A MATTER OF US DECIDING WHICH POINTS WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER, AND UNFORTUNATELY, SOLAR IS NOT THAT BENEFICIAL WHEN IT COMES TO L.E.E.D., THE WAY THE POINTS STRUCTURE IS. IT'S A CRAZY NUMBER TO GET THAT NEXT LEVEL. AND SO WE KNOW THAT SOLAR IS IMPORTANT. WE WANT TO INCLUDE IT. WE WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT. EVERY DAY, IT GETS BETTER, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S GREAT THAT LANDMARK WOULD BE A OWNER THAT INTENDS TO HANG ON TO THE PROPERTY, BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST CASE TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO COULD BELIEVE IN A PAYBACK.
00:48:15.543: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:48:18.480: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:48:19.381: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THANKS. AND I'LL JUST START BY ADDRESSING THE TWO THINGS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, WHICH WERE ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND WHAT OUR CODE CALLS FOR AND THE HEIGHT LIMIT ASSOCIATED WITH SOLAR AND WHETHER THOSE COUNT TOWARDS THE OVERALL HEIGHT, AND THOSE ARE TWO OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE MEETING IN NOVEMBER, SO THERE ARE THINGS IN THE WORKS, AND ACTUALLY, MR. KHAN IS WORKING ON BOTH OF THEM, SO THAT'S GREAT. AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO HAVE CONDUIT, PARTICULARLY ON THE 60-FOOT ROOF. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE GOING ON THERE THEN? NO? BECAUSE OUR CODE DOESN'T ALLOW IT TO GO ON, SO THERE'S NO MECHANICALS THERE. SO THAT IS -- AND IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF YOUR BUILDING, NOT SHADED BY THE TOWER, SO THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE WE WOULD WANT SOLAR PANELS. I UNDERSTAND WE CAN'T ASK YOU -- IT'S NOT ALLOWED IN OUR CODE RIGHT NOW. I THINK IT'S SUPER WISE TO PUT CONDUIT THERE, BECAUSE I FULLY EXPECT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR BODY WILL TAKE UP VERY SOON. ON THE E.V. INFRASTRUCTURE, AGAIN, PREDOMINANTLY PULLING FROM THE INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED AMONG O.R.C. AND SO I KNOW THAT'S LESS THAN HALF OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, BUT YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF LIKE THE COSTS OF BUILDING IT IN FROM THE GET-GO VERSUS -- RIGHT, SO RUNNING THE CONDUITS SO THAT YOU HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY, EVEN IF YOU DON'T PUT THE WIRES IN THAT CONDUIT, RIGHT, THAT IS SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, THE EXISTING BUILDING -- IT'S SAD TO SAY THAT IT'S 1982, WHICH ISN'T THAT OLD, RIGHT? I MEAN, THAT'S A SHORT LIFE FOR A BUILDING. THIS BUILDING, I WOULD EXPECT TO BE THERE MUCH LONGER, AND SO EVEN IN 40 YEARS, LIKE I WOULD FULLY EXPECT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PARKING THEIR CARS, THEY ARE GOING TO WANT ACCESS TO E.V. CHARGING, AND SO MAKING THAT IN THERE NOW I THINK IS VERY WISE. LET'S SEE. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU TALKED THROUGH PREMIUMS, BECAUSE YOU DID USE A RANGE OF THE EXISTING PREMIUMS TO GET THERE, SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD ADDRESS, JUST IN TERMS OF HOW YOU GET TO ALMOST 400% F.A.R. WHICH, AGAIN, GIVEN THE LOCATION OF THIS, I APPLAUD YOU FOR GETTING AS MUCH F.A.R. AS YOU POSSIBLY COULD, AND BY USING THOSE COMBINATIONS OF PREMIUMS. SO, UNDER THE OLD PREMIUMS THAT ARE NO LONGER IN EFFECT, BUT THIS WAS TAKING PLACE BEFORE THERE, JUST IN CASE YOU'RE IN THE AUDIENCE OR ON TV AND CARE ABOUT THIS, THERE'S PREMIUM FLOOR AREA THAT'S AWARDED FOR BEING RESIDENTIAL, WHICH THAT IN ITSELF IS NO LONGER VIABLE. THERE'S PREMIUM FLOOR AREA AWARDED FOR BEING ESPECIALLY SUSTAINABLE. THIS IS THE L.E.E.D. CERTIFICATION. AND THEN FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND SO THE -- EVEN THE SOLELY -- LIKE THE SUSTAINABILITY ASPECT, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THAT NO LONGER IS ONE OF THE PREMIUMS THAT'S AVAILABLE, SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S PART OF THIS. AM I WRONG ABOUT THAT? OKAY. SO, THE -- I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHERE THAT PUBLIC ART MIGHT GO, LIKE, WHAT THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN AROUND THAT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS ONE WAY TO LIVEN UP THE BUILDING. I AM OKAY WITH THE COLOR PALETTE, I THINK. I WON'T BE THE ONLY PERSON TO SAY IT'S GREAT THAT IT'S NOT BROWN, BUT I'M WONDERING WHERE YOU'RE THINKING OF PUBLIC ART AND WHAT THE PROCESS IS FOR THAT IN YOUR MINDS.
00:52:10.445: >> HI, ERIC LEE, LANDMARK PROPERTIES. SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY ENGAGED WITH THE ANN ARBOR ARTS CENTER TO HELP US MANAGE A LIKE PROCESS THAT WILL INVOLVE LOCAL ARTISTS IN ANN ARBOR TO PICK AN ART PIECE THAT WILL GO ON THIS BUILDING. WHERE WE ARE ANTICIPATING PUTTING THE ARTWORK NOW IS ACTUALLY AT THE CORNER OF PACKARD AND THE ALLEY. THERE IS AN OPEN GREEN SPACE THERE, AND WE ARE ENVISIONING PUTTING A 3D SCULPTURE TYPE PIECE OF ARTWORK THERE. THAT IS DRIVEN BY COMMENTS, BOTH FROM THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD AND MEETINGS WITH THE NEIGHBORS, AND FROM MEETINGS WITH THE ANN ARBOR ARTS CENTER THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW, WE EXPLORED SEVERAL DIFFERENT OPTIONS, BUT WE THOUGHT THAT CORNER WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO PUT SOMETHING TO KIND OF LIVEN UP THE BUILDING, AND, YOU KNOW, ACCESS FROM THAT AREA. SO, WE -- WE HAVE BEEN -- WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH ANN ARBOR ARTS CENTER ALREADY AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EXECUTING AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM TO HELP US MANAGE THAT PROCESS, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT LOCAL TO ANN ARBOR, WE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A LOCAL GROUP HELP US NAVIGATE THAT PROCESS WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.
00:53:24.152: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. SO THE PUBLIC ART ISN'T ANTICIPATED NECESSARILY TO BE SOMETHING WALL MOUNTED, SINCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR CORNER, OR IT COULD BE ON THE WALL IN THAT TRIANGLE?
00:53:35.596: >> IT COULD BE. WE ARE STILL KIND OF EXPLORING THAT. IT COULD ALSO BE KIND OF A PEDESTAL-MOUNTED OR, YOU KNOW, A PEDESTAL SCULPTURE AS WELL.
00:53:46.107: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. OKAY. IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE LIKE MORE THAN HALF BAKED. LIKE, IT'S NOT JUST LIP SERVICE THAT THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD. I APPRECIATE THAT. I'M NOT THE PUBLIC ART PERSON HERE, SO I APPRECIATE THAT. LET'S SEE. SO, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BIKE PARKING AND SOME OF THE PEDESTRIAN STUFF. THAT'S WHAT I OFTEN TALK ABOUT. AND FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL ON-STREET, LIKE CLASS C BICYCLE PARKING, BECAUSE I REGULARLY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO PARK MY BIKE ON SOUTH MAIN. IT'S USUALLY MY BIKE CHAINED IT LIKE A STREET LAMP OR A LAMP POST THERE. SO I THINK PARTICULARLY THAT YOU'RE ADDING RETAIL AND HAVING THOSE -- HAVING THE BIKE COOPS ON THE STREET I THINK IS GOING TO BE A GREAT ADDITION. THANK YOU FOR GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT THERE. FOR THE REQUIRED PARKING THAT YOU HAVE INSIDE, THE -- FIRST OF ALL, THE LOCATION OF THE WHATEVER IS OFF OF MAIN STREET, RIGHT NEXT TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE, WHAT I TAKE IS THE FRONT ENTRANCE, I THINK IS REALLY, REALLY GREAT. WHAT I'M WONDERING IS WHY THERE'S NOT A DOOR ON THE INSIDE AS WELL SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO -- IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A RAMP THAT GOES DOWN, AND SO I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT -- IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S GREAT CHANGE, BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WOULD MAKE IT -- YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO BEING LIKE MY IDEAL BIKE PARKING LOCATION, IF YOU COULD JUST GO FARTHER. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT.
00:55:27.708: >> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TURN THAT OVER --
00:55:31.312: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YEAH, I FIGURED THAT'S LIKE TAG TEAM TO THE ARCHITECTS.
00:55:34.882: >> IT'S REALLY ONLY THAT WE WOULD LOSE SPACES, AND IT COMES DOWN TO THAT. TO PUT ANOTHER DOOR IN, IT WOULD WIPE OUT BIKES IN THAT ROOM.
00:55:45.626: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S BIKES ON EITHER SIDE. IT'S MORE LIKE THE EAST WALL. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S NOTHING ON THE EAST WALL.
00:55:53.367: >> YEAH.
00:55:54.502: >> THERE'S JUST A GRADE CHANGE, SO YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE RAMPS, AND YOU'RE NOT AT THE CORRECT ELEVATION TO ACCESS THE BIKE PARKING ROOM.
00:56:01.676: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT
00:56:02.877: >> IF YOU TOOK THE ONES ON THE TOP RIGHT CORNER AND TURNED THEM 90, THOSE THREE AGAINST THE WALL --
00:56:10.251: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  MICROPHONE.
00:56:11.819: >> WE NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER RAMP.
00:56:13.020: >> I'LL BET IT'S A LITTLE SKETCHY, BUT IF YOU ELIMINATE THE ONES ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND GO OUT TOWARDS THE EAST WALL, THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO GET THE DOOR ON THE SOUTH WALL. IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT, I THINK IS REALLY --
00:56:26.267: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I DON'T WANT A BIKE ROOM TO BE UNUSED, RIGHT? YOU DON'T WANT THAT EITHER.
00:56:30.638: >> NO.
00:56:30.872: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO I MEAN IF THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN ELSEWHERE, I'M JUST THINKING LIKE -- MAYBE I'M CHANNELING THE FIRST APARTMENT THAT I HAD IN DC, WHERE YOU WALKED IN AND THEN YOU COULD CONTINUE ON THE OTHER SIDE. BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET RIGHT ON TO THE ELEVATORS, RATHER THAN WALK BACK FROM OUTSIDE. I LIKE THE ACCESS AT THE FRONT DOOR. I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC AND SENDS THE EXACT MESSAGE THAT WE WANT TO BE SENDING, WHICH IS THESE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT WE WANT LIVING IN THIS BUILDING, RIGHT, THAT AREN'T GOING TO BE USING THE ALLEY FOR THEIR CARS, THEY ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING THEIR BIKE. SO I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC. IT'S JUST I THOUGHT THAT WAS POTENTIALLY THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY. AND THEN I'M CONFUSED ON THE ONE THAT'S IN THE PARKING GARAGE HOW YOU ACTUALLY GET -- ARE YOU SNEAKING BETWEEN THE TWO COMPACT PARKING SPACES TO GET TO IT? THIS IS ON I THINK THE LOWER LEVEL.
00:57:26.627: >> CORRECT, YEAH. THERE'S A CORNER. I MEAN, THERE'S STILL ENOUGH ROOM TO -- IT'S REALLY SMALL HERE.
00:57:35.269: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YEAH.
00:57:35.836: >> SO, ESSENTIALLY, THERE'S A FIVE-FOOT WIDE PATH THAT YOU COULD ACCESS THAT. BUT YOU CAN GO DIRECTLY -- THE BASEMENT IS NOT TRULY A BASEMENT. IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY A COUPLE OF FEET BELOW GRADE.
00:57:47.381: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY.
00:57:47.949: >> SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE FRONT LOBBY TO GET TO THAT AREA. SO, BECAUSE THE BASEMENT IS AT -- THERE'S LIKE FIVE FEET OF GRADE CHANGE ACROSS THE SITE, SO THAT LOWER LEVEL IS ONLY A COUPLE OF FEET DOWN FROM GRADE. SO THAT RAMP THAT TAKES YOU DOWN FROM OFF OF THE LOBBY TAKES YOU ESSENTIALLY TO THE ELEVATION OF THAT PARKING AREA.
00:58:07.468: >> OKAY. SO I'M LOOKING AT -- YEAH, I THINK I'M LOOKING AT THE SAME ONE THAT YOU HAVE HERE. THIS IS THE LEVEL THAT HAS LIKE THE MAIL ROOM ON IT, RIGHT? AND YOU HAVE GOT THE STAIRWAY IN THE MIDDLE. SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT -- MAYBE I'M JUST SEEING SOLID WALLS, BUT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY --
00:58:24.518: >> THE PLAN IS KIND OF CUT FUNNY.
00:58:27.521: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY.
00:58:28.122: >> BUT, ESSENTIALLY, YES, FROM GRADE, YOU CAN REACH THAT WHOLE BACK AREA, THE VEHICULAR PARKING AND THE BIKE PARKING AREA OFF OF GRADE, WHICH IS WHAT THE RAMP OFF OF THE LOBBY TAKES YOU TOO.
00:58:43.371: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY. NOW I'M SEEING HOW THEY HOOK UP. GOT IT. BUT THERE IS NOTHING FROM -- I MEAN THERE IS NO ACCESS, HONESTLY, MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING ON BIKE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE TRYING TO ZIP TO THE EAST SIDE OF CAMPUS, POTENTIALLY, OR MAYBE SOMEWHERE ELSE, NORTH CAMPUS OR SOMETHING, BUT THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GET TO THE EAST SIDE ON THE BUILDING. IS THAT RIGHT?
00:59:07.862: >> THEY COULD GET TO IT ACTUALLY THROUGH THE PARKING GARAGE ITSELF.
00:59:10.931: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY. EITHER THEY COME UP THAT RAMP, RIGHT?
00:59:14.402: >> RIGHT.
00:59:14.669: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY. GOT IT. AND ON THE LEVEL THAT'S SHOWING WHERE THE LOBBY IS, NOT THIS ONE, I THINK, IT'S THE ONE WHERE YOU'RE SHOWING THE UP RAMP TO THE PARKING LEVEL, THERE'S SOMETHING JUST NORTH OF THE COMPACT SPACES MARKED 30 SPACES. IS THAT LIKE STORAGE UNITS OR SOMETHING?
00:59:35.523: >> YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT HERE?
00:59:36.891: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YEAH, OR WHAT IS THAT?
00:59:39.160: >> THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL BIKE PARKING ROOM. THAT'S BIKE PARKING OFF OF THE ALLEY, AND THEN FROM THERE, THERE'S A RAMP THAT GETS YOU UP INTO YOUR ELEVATOR LOBBY.
00:59:48.035: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT.
00:59:49.003: >> IT SEEMS TO ALL OF US THIS IS A FLAT SITE, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T. IT'S SO BIG. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON.
00:59:56.977: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO YOU HAVE THREE BIKE ROOMS. IS THAT WHAT I'M READING? AH, SO THIS IS
01:01:04.879: >> I WANT TO POINT OUT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE A RED LINE THAT GOES ACROSS, AND EARLIER ONE OF THE CITIZENS HAS SAID THAT. THERE IS NO BUILDING TO THE EAST OF THAT RED LINE. WHAT IS EAST OF THAT RED LINE IS A PARKING SPACE FOR AMAZON TO BASICALLY BE ABLE TO LOCATE AND ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES, AND THAT'S THE AREA THAT WE INTEND, AS WELL AS SOME OF THE SHARED VEHICLE SPACES, THAT'S THE AREA THAT WE INTEND TO BE RELATIVELY ACTIVE, BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS REQUESTED OF US TO PROVIDE AN AREA. IT'S NOT REQUIRED, BUT TO PROVIDE THAT AREA FOR AMAZON OR U.P.S. TO BE ABLE TO PARK THEIR VEHICLE. SO IT'S TOUGH, BECAUSE IF WE PROVIDE IT, SOME PEOPLE GET CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED IT. YOU KNOW, NOW THAT WE ARE PROVIDING SOMETHING ELSE OFF OF THE ALLEY, BUT WE ARE AT LEAST GIVING A PLACE FOR THE VEHICLES TO GO OFF OF THE ALLEY. WE KNOW, SOME OF THE CONCERN THAT NEIGHBORS HAD ON THE ALLEY ITSELF WAS THIS CONCENTRATION OF 100 PARKING SPACES. I MEAN, THAT -- SO THE BEST THING WE COULD DO, AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY CHANGED, WE SWITCHED IT, IS THAT IT'S ON 50, TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS, TWO DIFFERENT IN AND OUT POINTS, TWO DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE COMING FROM THE RIGHT OF THIS PLAN, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GO SOUTH. IF YOU'RE COMING FROM THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THIS, THERE'S A CHANCE THAT YOU MIGHT GO NORTH. BUT IF SOMEBODY IS IN THE ALLEY, YOU ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE TO GO BACK AND FORTH. THE ALLEY ITSELF IS A BENEFIT, AND IT'S A WONDERFUL THING TO HAVE, AND I UNDERSTAND THE NEIGHBORS' CONCERN THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF ADDED TRAFFIC. WE THROUGH THE TRAFFIC STUDY ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THIS CONCENTRATION OF TRAFFIC, AND IT'S RESIDENTS, AND SO THEY REALLY COME AND GO AT VERY DIFFERENT TIMES. AND EVEN THE RESIDENTS THAT ARE GOING TO LIVE HERE ARE GOING TO HAVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF SCHEDULES. SO PART OF THAT WAS TO GIVE MORE BREADTH TO THE ALLEY BY WIDENING IT. THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE SETBACK. WE HAVE PUSHED BACK THE BUILDING ANOTHER 20-30 FEET EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT. WE HAVE PROVIDED THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS. WE THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE IT FOR AMAZON AND U.P.S.  THAT PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO BE THE ISSUE. WE THINK THAT WITH UBER AND LYFT, IT'S VERY HARD. THEY ARE NOT AS TRAINABLE, SO WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU AND SAY WE HAVE PROVIDED IT, BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A PERFECT SOLUTION TO THAT.
01:03:26.887: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YEAH, I THINK THAT THAT'S A -- I THINK THAT THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE THE UBER/LYFT PROBLEM, WHETHER IT'S ON WILLIAM OR ON MAIN. I MEAN, HONESTLY, IF IT'S ON PACKARD, I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EMERGENCY VEHICLES ON PACKARD, BUT THERE'S JUST A LOT LESS TRAFFIC PARTICULARLY THERE, SO I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT THAT BEING BLOCKED.
01:03:49.109: >> RIGHT.
01:03:49.376: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YEAH. I -- THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I THINK OUR CODE NEEDS TO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT -- IN TERMS OF REQUIRING THIS, OR BETTER PLANNING ABOUT WHERE CURBSIDE PICKUP/DROP-OFF THINGS HAPPEN. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT OUR CODE CURRENTLY TALKS ABOUT, AND I'LL -- YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM ME AT THE COMMISSIONER PROPOSED BUSINESS AT THE END, TO ADD THAT TO OUR LIST.
01:04:16.170: >> IT'S TRICKY BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE SITE IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARKING ON THREE SIDES OF IT.
01:04:22.142: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  WHICH TO YOUR POINT, USING THE BENEFIT, THAT IS SUCH -- THIS IS GOING TO BE A REALLY GREAT BLOCK TO WALK ON BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY CURB CUTS. I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY FANTASTIC. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S SOME PEOPLE -- THERE'S SOME SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRAINABLE, AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM, AND SO --
01:04:42.930: >> RIGHT, AND I THINK ONE OF THE CITIZENS HAD A GREAT POINT ABOUT WHY AREN'T WE SENDING THE TRAFFIC OUT ON ONE OF THOSE OTHER THREE STREETS, AND PACKARD AND WILLIAMS WOULD BE A TRAFFIC PERSON'S NIGHTMARE, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THAT LONG, SO TO SEND A TRAFFIC VEHICLE OUT THAT CLOSE TO AN ALLEY WOULD NEVER BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE, AND THEN TO SEND IT OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF MAIN STREET, JUST FROM AN URBAN PLANNING PERSPECTIVE, WOULD REALLY RUIN THE POTENTIAL FOR MAIN STREET.
01:05:08.422: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  MOVE IN, MOVE OUT, WHERE ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT? BECAUSE MOVE IN, MOVE OUT TENDS TO BE CONCENTRATED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERIOD.
01:05:16.430: >> RIGHT.
01:05:16.830: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  RIGHT? SO THAT LOADING ZONE ISN'T GOING TO FIT MULTIPLE MOVING VANS.
01:05:24.438: >> THERE'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A STAGING PLAN FOR ALL OF THE SPACES ACROSS THE BACK, BECAUSE AT THOSE MOVE IN AND MOVE OUT POINTS, LANDMARK CURRENTLY DOESN'T EVEN FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO NEED THESE PARKING SPACES. THEY NEED SOME, BUT THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO NEED THE FULL NUMBER. SO THE ABILITY TO HAVE OUR LOADING ZONE, HAVING THE SHARED PARKING SPACES, AND THEN USING THOSE OTHER OUTDOOR PARKING SPACES ON A TEMPORARY BASIS, WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO PETITION THE CITY OR ANYTHING FOR A SPACE IS REALLY WHERE THE MOVE IN AND MOVE OUT OPERATION WOULD HAPPEN. WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER LOADING AREA, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE WHERE TR TRASH PICKUP IS, WHERE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE VEHICLES GOING IN AND OUT, SO WE PLAN ON USING THAT PROCESS AND ALL OF THEM ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE ELEVATORS TO THE BUILDING.
01:06:10.250: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. AND JUST TO GET YOU GUYS TO SAY IT, THEN, IF LANDMARK DOESN'T THINK THAT THEY NEED ALL OF THESE SPACES, THE REASON YOU ARE REQUIRING THEM IS BECAUSE OUR CODE REQUIRES IT.
01:06:24.098: >> CORRECT.
01:06:24.398: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  AND I KNOW YOU'RE PROVIDING ONE ADDITIONAL SPACE MORE THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED, AND THAT IS IT.
01:06:29.036: >> YES.
01:06:30.604: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY THE -- MATCHING IT, AND ALSO AGAIN THAT IT IS SCREENED FROM THE STREET, BUT DO YOU HAVE SPACES LIKE YOU SAY HERE, PARTICULARLY, THE SURFACE SPACES THAT CAN BE USED FOR THOSE VEHICLES. I THINK THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND KIND OF NOTING THAT, AND HOW THOSE SPACES WILL BE USED MORE FOR THAT KIND -- THOSE DROP-OFF THINGS WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT TO ME, SO THAT'S HELPFUL INFORMATION TO HAVE. I -- YEAH. I'M DONE. THANKS.
01:07:01.435: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
01:07:04.872: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I JUST WANTED TO MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, SO FROM THE COMMENTS WE GOT EARLIER, I'M NOT SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO LIVE IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT TO THE EAST OR OTHER NEIGHBORS ARE YET CONVINCED THAT THERE AREN'T GOING TO BE SOME IMPACTS TO THEM BY THIS INCREASED TRAFFIC FROM THE ALLEY, AND SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE TO WORK ON THAT, BUT CERTAINLY JUST TO BE OPEN TO THAT. NOW, IS THE ALLEY ALREADY PAVED, OR IS IT GOING TO BE PAVED OR REPAVED OR --
01:07:41.008: >> THE ALLEY IS ALREADY PAVED, AND ANYTHING THAT WOULD NEED TO BE PAVED WOULD JUST BE A PART OF THE PROCESS.
01:07:46.380: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. ALL RIGHTY. THE OTHER THING I JUST WANTED TO MENTION WAS I THINK WE ALL WANT TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASED SOLAR PANELS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THE HEIGHT LIMITS ON THAT BUILDING, I REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT, AND THERE WOULD INDEED BE A LOT MORE DISCUSSION, EVEN THOUGH SOLAR PANELS ARE SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY MIGHT BE IMPORTANT, BUT YET IF THEY DO INCREASE THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING, THEN I THINK YOU WILL PERHAPS HAVE SOME NEIGHBORS WHO WOULD AGAIN COME OUT WITH CONCERNS. SO, JUST TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. I THINK THE -- THIS BUILDING WAS OR THIS SPACE HAS CERTAINLY HAD A LOT OF ATTENTION, BOTH FROM PLANNING COMMISSION AND ALSO FROM THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORS AND CITY COUNCIL, OF COURSE, AS WELL. AND SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COMPROMISES MADE, WHICH -- WHICH MEANS THAT PROBABLY NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE HAPPY. PERSONALLY, I LIKE BROWN, SO I'M -- THAT'S A VOTE FOR BROWN. I ALSO KIND OF LIKE THE PICTURES THAT CAME IN OUR PACKET. I WAS LIKE, SO, WHY DID YOU MOVE AWAY FROM SOME OF THOSE? MAYBE IT WAS THE SHADING OR THE TIME OF YEAR FOR SOME OF THOSE. I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T YOU JUST COMPROMISE IT AND PUT UP A BIG PINK AND BLUE BUILDING AND SEE WHERE WE GO FROM THERE? BUT I DO WANT TO SAY, IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ART, I'M HOPING, PERHAPS ALSO, THAT YOU MAY, AS YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT PERHAPS HAVING SOME CAFE AREA OR SOMETHING ON THE WILLIAMS STREET SIDE, MAYBE THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SORT OF PUBLIC ART POSSIBILITY, POSSIBLY EVEN JUST CHANGING THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT MIGHT GO THERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT ON YOUR BUILDING, BUT JUST, YOU KNOW, THINGS WHICH KEEP FOLKS' ATTENTION, BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ALSO FOUND IS THIS PARTICULAR PART OF MAIN STREET, ON THIS SIDE AS WELL AS THE OTHER SIDE, I HAVE OFTEN HEARD FOLKS IN THE D.D.A. SAY THAT IT BECOMES DEAD AFTER A CERTAIN TIME OF DAY, SO IT'S NOT LIKE PUTTING UP THIS BIG BUILDING, EVEN WITH ALL OF THESE AMENITIES, IS GOING TO CHANGE NECESSARILY IF THERE'S NOT SOME LIVELY ACTIVITY AND OTHER THINGS ALSO BEING PLANNED.
01:10:10.257: >> AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PACKARD STREET, RIGHT BY PACKARD AND THE ALLEY, THAT WHOLE ACTIVATION OF PACKARD IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE REQUEST FROM THE NEIGHBORS. THEY ACTUALLY WANTED THAT. THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY WANT OUR AMENITY THERE, BUT THEY LIKED THE IDEA OF THE LOBBY AND THE TRAFFIC. THEY LIKED THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS AN AMENITY THAT WAS ACTIVE, AND THEY KIND OF, HONESTLY, LIKED THE IDEA THAT THAT HAD THE ABILITY TO CHANGE AT SOME POINT, THAT IT WAS EFFECTIVELY A KIND OF RETAIL TYPE SPACE THAT COULD EVOLVE OVER TIME IF SOMETHING WANTED TO CHANGE, IF THERE WAS A USE THAT MADE SENSE FOR IT.
01:10:44.491: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  RIGHT. ANY PLANS AS YOU LOOK AT YOUR WHOLE BIG BLOCK -- I KNOW YOU HAVE MENTIONED THE CAFE, BUT ANY OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE MIGHT BE ANY KIND OF SEATING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? I DON'T KNOW, ANY --
01:11:00.907: >> WELL, THAT IS THE WHOLE IDEA IN KIND OF MOVING THE BUILDING BACK. WE ALREADY HAD 16 STREET ON MAIN STREET AND MORE ON PACKARD, BECAUSE THERE WE HAD GREEN SPACE, SIDEWALK, GREEN SPACE, BUILDING. ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S MORE URBAN WITH SOME OPENINGS, A NEW STREET SCAPE AND PLANTER. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE KIND OF GONE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE CITY ON, TO WORK OUT THE STREET SCAPE AND THEIR RECOMMENDATION. THE NUMBER OF TREES, I THINK THEY ARE ACTUALLY BALANCED PRETTY GOOD. YES, AT FIRST THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LOOK AS FULL, BUT ONCE THEY DO GROW, I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO A NORM FOR WHERE THE TREES WOULD GO. AND THE IDEA IS WITHIN THAT 16-FOOT SPACE, IT'S REALLY SET UP SO THAT THERE CAN BE OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AND SEATING. THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE NORMAL CITY PLANNING PROCESS. AND AT THE CORNER, YOU CAN SET THE ENTRANCES BACK. IT'S SET BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THREE FEET, SO AT THE CORNER, WE EVEN ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE SPACE. NOT ONLY 16 FEET ON THOSE TWO SIDES ON THE CORNER, IT GOES BACK TO 19, ALMOST 20 FEET THERE.
01:12:10.277: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. SO AT THIS POINT, YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ANY GIANT CLOCK ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR BUILDING OR ANYTHING.
01:12:17.284: >> NO CLOCK.
01:12:18.285: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY.
01:12:20.987: >> WAS THAT A REQUEST?
01:12:22.889: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  YES. WE COULD ALWAYS USE MORE CLOCKS.
01:12:28.428: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:12:29.362: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  I'LL TRY NOT TO REVISIT SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. WITH REGARD TO THE STREET FRONT ACTIVATION, IS THE GLASS THAT YOU SHOWED EARLIER, IS THAT WHAT THE RETAIL GLASS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE?
01:12:44.344: >> THE RETAIL GLASS, THIS HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE TINT TO IT, BECAUSE IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY -- THE RETAIL GLASS WILL BE THIS GREEN CHARACTER, BUT IT WILL BE THE COMPLETELY CLEAR ONE.
01:12:52.986: >> WONDERFUL.
01:12:54.254: >> YEAH
01:12:54.488: >> BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET, WHERE THERE WASN'T THAT VISIBILITY. AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO THE PEDESTRIAN MOBILITY ANALYSIS, YOU MENTIONED LOOKING AT THE CROSSWALK TIMING. I DON'T KNOW IF A RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE TO STAFF OR DISCUSSIONS AROUND PROHIBITING RIGHT TURNS ON RED. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S COME OUT OF THE PEDESTRIAN ACCESS AND SAFETY TASK FORCE, AND I BELIEVE IT'S STILL PERMITTED THERE AT THE CORNER. COULD YOU DISCUSS THAT?
01:13:23.416: >> YEAH, I THINK SCOTT COULD TALK ABOUT THAT.
01:13:27.053: >> WE CAN REVISIT THAT. WE CAN COME BACK TO THAT.
01:13:35.262: >> THERE IS NO TURN ON RED THAT WAS INSTALLED AT THE CORNER OF WILLIAMS AND MAIN IN THE LAST 30 DAYS.
01:13:43.270: >> CHECK. YOU MENTIONED THE COURTYARDS EARLIER, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE -- I MEAN, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WOULD BE A DESIRE TO HAVE NOT TOO MUCH, YOU KNOW, FOLKS LOOKING IN ON THE FOLKS IN THE HOT TUB, AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME OF THE TREES MAYBE, BUT IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERHAPS -- I MEAN, ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT COURTYARD IS SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE GLIMPSE IN OR THERE'S SOMETHING THAT ACTIVATES THAT SPACE TO MAKE IT INTERESTING EVEN FOR THE PERSON WHO IS ON THE OUTSIDE, AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT BY ENCOURAGING MAYBE IVY GROWING OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALSO THEN CREATE SOME ADDITIONAL WARMTH TO THAT BUILDING. IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD ADD THAT ELEMENT?
01:14:30.216: >> I THINK WITH THE PLANTERS, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT WE COULD CONSIDER. IT'S JUST A WAY OF FINDING SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY CLIMBING. RIGHT NOW THE INTENTION IS YOU HAVE TREES AND A TRELLIS, BUT THE TRELLIS ITSELF IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD ALSO PUT A CLIMBING TYPE OF VAN OR SOMETHING TO GO AND GROW ON.
01:14:46.032: >> I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT. I THINK I CONCUR WITH SOME OF THE STATEMENTS AROUND THERE NOT BEING NECESSARILY VERY MUCH WARMTH TO THE BUILD. I THINK THAT THERE ARE JUST SMALL LITTLE ELEMENTS LIKE THAT THAT MIGHT BE BE ABLE TO ADD IN A LITTLE BIT TO IT, WHICH THEN, GOING TO THE PUBLIC ART ASPECT, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MORE OF A SIGNATURE PIECE ON THAT ONE CORNER OR SOMETHING THAT'S COMING IN WITH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ARTS CENTER, BUT IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO ALSO LOOK FOR JUST SMALLER PIECES, JUST SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE, AND IF WE THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU WALK BY LITERATI WITH THE WORDS ON THE WALL OR THE LITTLE FERRY DOORS, IT'S SOMETHING THAT TAKE PEOPLE BY SURPRISE THAT COULD LIVEN UP A SPACE, SO IF YOU COULD LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES JUST TO ADD SOMETHING FOR INTEREST, IT MAKES THE BUILDING MORE SPECIAL FOR EVERYBODY AND FOR THE COMMUNITY.
01:15:47.827: >> AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT LANDMARK HAS BEEN OPEN TO THAT. AT FIRST, IT STARTED AS A PARTICULAR MAYBE A PIECE OR A WORK, WHERE COULD IT BE FOR IT. THAT GREW OUT OF A NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP, BUT I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH DESIGN REVIEW AND EVERYBODY ELSE, EVERYBODY STILL LIKES THAT, BUT THEY LIKE THE IDEA THAT IT MAY STRETCH DOWN THE ALLEY. SO I KNOW THAT LANDMARK IS COMPLETELY OPEN TO IT, AND AS WITH ANY ART, WE ARE HOPING THAT WHAT'S SELECTED IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BLOW US ALL AWAY AND MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE WEREN'T ANTICIPATING, BUT THE IDEA WOULD BE IF WE COULD STRETCH THIS OUT AND GET THE BIGGEST IMPACT OUT OF IT.
01:16:27.534: >> I THINK MY IMPRESSION IS SOMETIMES WE HAVE STRUGGLED WITH PUBLIC ART AND SIGNATURE PIECES IN OUR COMMUNITY. I'LL JUST LEAVE IT THERE. AND I ALSO SECOND THE COMMENTS REGARDING THE BIKE PARKING. IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH THE BUILDING, THAT JUST MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE PLEASANT TO BE ABLE TO GO IN FROM THE FRONT AND THEN EXIT BACK INTO YOUR HOME. IT'S LOVELY. COULD YOU DISCUSS -- AND THEN FINALLY, COULD YOU DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT MORE THE DELIVERY SPACES. I MEAN, I THINK, OBVIOUSLY, WITH THE UBER AND LYFT, WE ARE GOING TO SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT, FOLKS BEING DRIVEN TO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING WHERE THE ADDRESS IS. BUT I'M NOT -- IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE ALLEY SIDE OF THE BUILDING LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF -- IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A LOBBY OFF OF THE FRONT.
01:17:24.390: >> UH-HUH.
01:17:24.691: >> IS THERE A SPACE OFF OF THE REAR OF THE BUILDING THAT IS PLEASANT FOR RESIDENTS TO WAIT THERE, IF THEY ARE WAITING FOR A PIZZA OR --
01:17:31.164: >> THERE IS.
01:17:31.731: >> OKAY. COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT MORE?
01:17:33.933: >> I MEAN, BUILDING IS KIND OF UNIQUE, FIRST OF ALL. IT REALLY HAS TWO LOBBIES.
01:17:38.938: >> OKAY.
01:17:39.205: >> THERE IS A TOWER LOBBY, WHICH ON THE DRAWINGS, EVERYBODY -- I'LL CIRCLE IT RIGHT NOW, IF YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE SCREEN. THERE'S A TOWER LOBBY, WHICH IS LOCATED TO THE NORTH OF THE MAIN STREET ACCESS POINT, AND THEN THERE'S THE LOWER PORTION LOBBY, WHICH IS LOCATED ALL THE WAY RIGHT AT THE KINK, WHEN WE GO DOWN PACKARD. THEN FROM EITHER OF THOSE TWO, HERE, THERE'S AN ACCESS POINT TO GO IN AND OUT TO THE REAR AREA, AS WELL AS THE ONE THAT JOSH KIND OF WALKED YOU THERE YOU AT THIS OTHER REAR AREA. THE REAR AREA ACROSS THE ENTIRE BACK IS BASICALLY LANDSCAPED, OR IT'S PARKING, OR IT'S THE LOADING. IT'S THIS DROP-OFF AREA. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A LOADING DOCK. IT'S ACTUALLY JUST INTENDED TO BE A DROP-OFF AREA, AND BASICALLY, DEPENDING ON WHAT THE VEHICLES ARE THAT COULD FIT IN THERE, RIGHT NOW IT'S BASICALLY SET UP THAT YOU COULD HAVE A REGULAR SIZED U.P.S. TRUCK AND PROBABLY A UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE TRUCK THERE, AND THEN THERE ARE SPACES THAT RUN ACROSS THE BACK UNTIL YOU GET TO THE SHARED PARKING SPACES THAT WE HAVE. WHAT WE WERE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT BEFORE IS BETWEEN ALL OF THOSE, THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE VEHICLES TO COME IN AND OUT. I'M COMPLETELY SURE THAT WE COULD MANAGE THE UBER -- I MEAN TO MANAGE THE U.P.S. DELIVERY SYSTEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO TODAY, IF THEY WOULD JUST STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC ON PACKARD. THEY MIGHT, BUT WE ARE GIVING THEM A PLACE TO GO, AND IT WOULD SEEM TO MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF SENSE THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT, AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF UNDERSTANDING AND TRAINING THAT IT WOULD WORK.
01:19:15.068: >> I'M NOT SO MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE. I'M THINKING MORE OF THE DELIVERY, AT LEAST BEING ABLE TO ROUTE SOME OF THOSE DELIVERIES. I MEAN, I WOULD CONCUR THAT WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO TRAFFIC DOWNTOWN THAT WE HAVE NOT YET FIGURED OUT WHEN IT COMES TO NEW FORMS OF MOBILITY AND DELIVERY GALORE. SO, TO THE DEGREE THAT I JUST WASN'T SURE IF THAT BACK AREA FOR THE RESIDENTS, IF THAT WOULD FEEL LIKE A SPACE THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING.
01:19:47.967: >> DEFINITELY.
01:19:49.002: >> OKAY.
01:19:49.269: >> I MEAN THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS BACKSPACE, THE WHOLE STRETCH, ALMOST 70% OF THAT BUILDING, IT'S EITHER THAT IT'S OUTDOOR WALKING, A SIDEWALK, OR LANDSCAPING AGAINST THE WALL. SO THAT WHOLE SECTOR IS A VERY, VERY GREEN SECTOR. THEN WE GET TO THAT BIG TRANSFORMER THAT JUST GOT BRICK AROUND IT THAT WE ARE KIND OF STUCK WITH IT THAT IS EXISTING. AND THEN WE HAVE THE LOWER AREA. SO WE DON'T ENVISION THAT, AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS ASKED FOR BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD, IS THAT WE ACTUALLY WOULD COVER THAT AREA. IT USED TO BE KIND OF MORE OF AN OPEN COURTYARD, AND THAT WAS BENEFICIAL TO EVERYBODY, SO THAT WAS ALREADY PLACED INSIDE. AND THEN EVENTUALLY, WHEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT -- THE OTHER ISSUE IS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK WITH THE BEER DEPOT, BECAUSE THEY JUST PARK THEIR TRUCKS RIGHT NOW. IT'S JUST A LITTLE TOO CONVENIENT. THE NICE THING OF HAVING A PROPERTY HERE THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY WELL MANAGED IS THEY CAN BE KIND OF ENCOURAGED TO FOLLOW THE RULES ON WHERE THEY NEED TO PARK.
01:20:46.292: >> OKAY.
01:20:47.393: >> SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.
01:20:52.098: >> IT DOES. THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO EDUCATION. SOME PEOPLE COME TO THIS NATURALLY AND SAY THEY WILL TELL THE DELIVERY DRIVER TO DROP THIS INTO THE ALLEY SIDE, BUT IF THERE'S A WAY TO EDUCATE THE RESIDENTS WHEN THEY GET A TOUR TO BLATANTLY RECOMMEND IT.
01:21:13.786: >> ONE WAY TO WORK WITH UBER AND LYFT IS TO GET THE DROP SPOT SET IN A SPECIFIC SPOT, SO IF THEY TYPE IN THE WORD THE STANDARD, IT MIGHT COME UP WITH THAT OPTION AS A DROP-OFF, JUST LIKE YOU GET STRANGE PLACES AT THE AIRPORT AND DIFFERENT PLACES, SO WE CERTAINLY WOULD WORK WITH THEM TO DO THAT, TO GO THROUGH THE ALLEY.
01:21:35.942: >> AND FINALLY, COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO GET L.E.E.D. SILVER. YOU MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, THAT SOLAR PANELS DON'T RANK VERY HIGH, BUT WHAT DOES? WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR POINTS?
01:21:47.954: >> IT'S KIND OF ACROSS THE BOARD. SO, IF WE -- WITH -- JUST JOSH, I WANT TO CHECK. REMIND ME, HOW MANY POINTS DID WE GET FOR THE SOLAR PANELS? RIGHT, SO IT'S -- AND WE ARE SHOOTING FOR 60, RIGHT? [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ]. WE NEED 50, BUT WE HAVE TO SHOOT FOR 60 SO IF SOMETHING DOESN'T COME THROUGH -- WE ARE USUALLY SHOOTING FOR FIVE POINTS OVER, AND THAT'S USUALLY WHERE WE END UP BEING CERTIFIED. SO, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT GETS YOU AN IDEA, AND THEN TO REALLY, REALLY, REALLY INTRODUCE A LOT OF THE SOLAR PANELS, PERHAPS AS MANY AS WE DID ON HOOVER AND GREEN, WHICH, YOU KNOW, WE HAD A BIG HUGE FLAT ROOF WE COULD DO IT ON, WE GET THREE POINTS. WE GET MORE POINTS FOR JUST BEING IN AN URBAN AREA THAN ANY OF THOSE, SO THAT IS A BIG PART OF IT. BASICALLY, WE DON'T HAVE THESE CONCERNS FOR TRAFFIC. WE DON'T HAVE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL OF THE EXTRA PARKING. THE E.V.s, THE SHARED VEHICLES ARE SOME OF THE PLACES WE GET IT, BUT MOST OF THE STUFF ACTUALLY COMES THROUGH HOW WE BUILD THE BUILDING. SO, FOR INSTANCE, THERE WILL BE RECYCLED CONTENT. I'M SORRY, I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU GUYS ENOUGH. THERE WILL BE RECYCLED CONTENT AS A BIG PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS THAT ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BUILDING. THERE ARE CERTAIN BENEFITS FOR USING DIFFERENT PANELED SYSTEMS LIKE WE ARE USING ON THE EXTERIOR BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AS MUCH WASTE OF MATERIAL AND WE GET A BETTER ENERGY SYSTEM. A BIG PART IS THE ENVELOPE, THE WAY THE BUILDING IS INSULATED AND ENCAPSULATED AND A BIG PART OF IT COMES DOWN TO THE COOLING AND HEATING SYSTEMS THAT WE USE IN THE BUILDING. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO GET ANYWHERE ABOVE L.E.E.D. SILVER, BECAUSE THERE'S JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM. SO WE HAVE OFTEN TRIED TO GET TO GOLD, AND THAT'S WHERE IT GETS VERY DIFFICULT. IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR A SINGLE TENANT, LIKE AN OFFICE OR AN INSTITUTIONAL THING. IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE, BUT IT JUST GETS TO BE MORE DIFFICULT. SO IT'S REALLY THAT WHOLE ENVELOPE IS PROBABLY WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE OTHER POINTS ARE COMING FROM.
01:23:43.603: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:23:44.971: >> AND THAT WILL BE A PART OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE, AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T THINK AS MANY PEOPLE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT IN ANN ARBOR IN THE PAST, BECAUSE THE RESIDENTIAL PREMIUM WAS SUCH A BIG BONUS. MANY PEOPLE TOOK CARE OF SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF BEING GREEN, AND WE HAVE DONE THAT ON OTHER PROJECTS, BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE CERTIFIED L.E.E.D.
01:24:15.668: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:24:16.702: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: ONE OTHER POINT I WANT TO BRING UP ON THE ART, AND I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE NEIGHBORS ALL THE WAY ALONG, I HAVE TO SAY I WAS SURPRISED, IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS A LEFTOVER POLYGON TO ME, AND THAT YOU'RE PLUGGING IN THE ART THERE, AND FROM THE KIND OF TOWN PERSPECTIVE, I WOULD RATHER SEE SOMETHING ON ONE OF THE CORNERS ON MAIN, BECAUSE THEN MORE PEOPLE GET TO SEE IT AND ENJOY IT, AND I -- IF I WERE TO CHOOSE, AND I COULD JUST BE THE QUEEN HERE, I WOULD SAY THE CORNER OF MAIN AND WILLIAM, BECAUSE IT IS THIS BIG DIVIDE THERE ON WILLIAM, AND D2 RUNS FOR A LONG WAY. IT'S A LONG SKINNY WEIRD DOG LEG IN TERMS OF THE D.D.A. AND IF WE ARE EVER GOING TO GET PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES TO START POPULATING THAT LONG, SKINNY DOG LEG, THEN WE HAVE TO START MAKING FUN INTERESTING THINGS TO BE ABLE TO CROSS OVER THAT MAGIC LINE AT WILLIAM, BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE NORTH OF THERE IS REALLY FUN, AND THEN NOBODY EVER CROSSES, AND SO I FEEL LIKE WE DO NEED THINGS TO ENTICE PEOPLE TO CROSS, AND SO I -- I MEAN, AGAIN, YOU ALL HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH NEIGHBORS. I DON'T WANT TO SORT OF COMPLETELY UP-END ALL OF THAT, BUT I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO MAYBE INSERT THAT INTO THE PROCESS, IN TERMS OF HOW THE NEIGHBORS THINK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THAT CORNER -- WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE TO CROSS THE DIVIDE THERE, BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE A FEW BUSINESSES DOWN THERE, AND I THINK THERE COULD BE MORE, AND IF WE CAN JUST GET PEOPLE TO KIND OF GET ACROSS THAT FIRST OBVIOUS, YOU KNOW, GAP, THEN THINGS LIKE WHAT COMMISSIONER BRIGGS WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT, JUST WAYS TO CAPTURE PEOPLE'S INTEREST IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. I WAS JUST GLAD FROM THE D.R.B. COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE MORE OF A CORNER ELEMENT AND ALL OF THIS STUFF, BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WANT TO GO THERE AND CHECK IT OUT. SO I WOULD PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, BUT I DO FEEL LIKE KIND OF IN TERMS OF THE STRUCTURE OF OUR DOWNTOWN AND WHERE WE WANT TO GO IN TERMS OF WALKABILITY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE RESIDENTS NOW KIND OF LIKE WAY DOWN THAT AT THE END, AND I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF -- SO WE HAVE THIS KIND OF PIECE DOWN AT THE END, AND WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, THE PART UP OVER HERE, AND I THINK WE NEED TO FILL IN THAT GAP, AND IF WE HAVE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF PURELY RESIDENTIAL, THEN THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING INTERESTING ON THEM FOR PEOPLE TO WANT TO KIND OF GO ACROSS THERE. SO, AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO LIKE UP END THINGS, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND DIALOGUES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN HAPPENING, BUT I WOULD VOTE FOR SOMETHING THAT GETS PEOPLE TO CROSS THE STREET. OTHERWISE, I THINK IT'S A GOOD LOOKING PROJECT. I LIKE GRAY, PERSONALLY, SO I THINK IT'S SUBJECTIVE AND TOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. I LIKE THE DARK AT THE BOTTOM. I THINK IT GIVES IT LIKE A SENSE OF FOUNDATION ACTUALLY FOR ME PERSONALLY. SO, THAT'S -- I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD. THANK YOU.
01:27:21.087: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:27:22.021: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  MOST OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO ASK HAVE ALREADY BEEN ASKED, SO MAYBE I WOULD JUST SECOND CONCERNS ABOUT UBER AND LYFT AND AMAZON PACKAGES, THE KINDS OF STORIES THAT WE ARE HEARING FROM OTHER SIMILAR DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING DOWNTOWN THAT I AM SURE YOU ARE ALL AWARE OF. AND I WANTED TO JUST MAYBE UNDERLINE THE COMMENT THAT CAME EARLIER DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ABOUT THE TWO UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SO THIS MAY BE KIND OF MORE FOR THE DEVELOPER THAN FOR THE ARCHITECT, BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE MORE THAN TWO UNITS, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF A GESTURE TO THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE TO PROVIDE MORE THAN THAT, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE WOULD PRODUCE AN UNDUE BURDEN. SO I JUST WANTED TO LOG THAT COMMENT. THANKS.
01:28:17.443: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:28:18.477: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: WHILE WE ARE ON THAT POINT, ACTUALLY, AND MAYBE THIS IS MORE OF A QUESTION FOR STAFF, BUT I WAS WONDERING WHY 80% OR LESS OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME, WHY IT COULDN'T BE 60 OR 65%. IS THERE A REASON WE PICKED 80?
01:28:34.760: >> THAT NUMBER, 80, WAS PICKED PROBABLY DECADES AGO, AND SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT THE JUSTIFICATION WAS AT THAT POINT IN TIME.
01:28:46.839: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: SO THAT'S JUST A CITY -- WHEN IT'S AFFORDABLE, IT'S DESIGNATED AT 80%?
01:28:53.012: >> THAT WAS THE DEFINITION THAT WAS CHOSEN AT THE TIME, AND AS YOU KNOW, CITY COUNCIL MADE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT BRINGS THAT NUMBER DOWN TO 60.
01:29:02.855: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: OKAY, BUT WE WERE OPERATING UNDER THE OLD STANDARD, SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE, SO THAT'S WHY. OKAY. ON THE -- THE STAFF REPORT SAYS THERE'S A TOTAL OF 6,000 SQUARE FEET OF OPEN SPACE ON THE GROUND LEVEL. IS THAT PRIMARILY ALONG THE ALLEY, AND IS THAT JUST UNPROGRAMMED, THAT NICE PICTURE THAT YOU SHOWED, THAT NICE COURTYARD, THAT IS ON THE SECOND COURTYARD? THAT'S PRIVATE?
01:29:29.949: >> THOSE ARE RAISED UP, SO THAT IS NOT INCLUDED.
01:29:32.985: >> IS THERE GRASS BACK THERE? I GUESS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY --
01:29:36.989: >> NO, IT IS LANDSCAPED. THAT ENTIRE AREA IS GOING TO BE LANDSCAPED, INCLUDING THE SPACES BETWEEN THE PARKING. ALL OF THAT WILL BE LANDSCAPED.
01:29:44.430: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: WILL THERE BE BENCHES? OR WHAT ARE YOU --
01:29:47.500: >> WE WEREN'T PLANNING TO DO ANY OF THAT. THAT'S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY.
01:29:50.469: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: I DON'T KNOW IF THE ALLEY WILL BE A PLACE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO HANG OUT. IT SEEMS WIDE ENOUGH. OH, YEAH, PEOPLE ARE WALKING THROUGH, HANGING OUT. LIGHTING, WHAT KIND OF LIGHTING IS GOING TO HAPPEN THERE.
01:30:04.884: >> BASICALLY ALL OF THE LIGHTING THAT WE ARE PUTTING ON THE EXTERIOR, THAT'S ANOTHER POINT WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO GET POINTS FOR, KEEPING IT DARK SKIES, SO IT'S ALL SHOOTING DOWN. WE MAY EVEN PUSH SOME OF THAT MORE INTO THE AMBER RANGE. NONE OF IT WILL BE IN THE BRIGHT WHITE RANGE, WHERE IT'S SO STARK, BUT WE HAVE REQUIREMENTS WHERE WE CAN'T EXCEED ONE FOOT CANDLE OFF OF THE PROPERTY LINE, SO IT'S PRETTY LIMITED. WE'LL HAVE LIGHTING THAT WILL MEET CODE ON THE ALLEYWAY. D.T.E. HAS THE SUBSTATION ON THE OTHER SIDE AND IT HAS LIGHTING ACROSS THE BACK, BUT OUR INTENTION IS TO LIGHT THAT AND MAKE IT VERY SAFE.
01:30:44.690: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: GOOD. SAFETY WAS MY CONCERN.
01:30:47.927: >> (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) -- I DIDN'T REALLY ONE THROUGH THAT, BUT ALL OF THE ENTRY POINTS HAVE ACCESS AND SECURITY. THE BUILDING ITSELF HAS SECURITY, AND IT'S REALLY WELL MANAGED.
01:30:54.967: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: OKAY. AND JUST A COUPLE OF MORE THINGS. OH, THE PARKING SPACES YOU HAVE DESIGNATED BACK THERE IN THE ALLEY, ARE THOSE GOING TO BE DESIGNATED AS LIKE SHORT-TERM PARKING? IS THERE ANY CONCERN THAT LIKE A RESIDENT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SPACE IN THE GARAGE WOULD JUST PARK THERE LONG TERM?
01:31:16.922: >> RIGHT NOW THE INTENTION IS WE HAVE TWO SHARED VEHICLES, AND THEN THE REST ARE JUST NUMBERED PARKING SPACES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY OF MOVING IN, BUT WE DON'T HAVE FROM THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS, WE HAVE ONE EXTRA SPOT, BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY ON THE OTHER SPOTS NOT TO ASSIGN THEM. SO OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT NEEDS TO BE PARKING, AND WE CAN'T SAY IT'S A LYFT SPACE OR PLACE TO PICK UP, AND JEFF, YOU COULD ALLUDE TO THAT. I ASSUME PARKING IS PARKING, AND THIS IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THE CODE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO ADDRESS AS TIMES CHANGE, YOU KNOW.
01:31:52.424: >> THAT PARKING IS PRIVATELY CONTROLLED. IT IS OFF A PUBLIC ALLEY, BUT IT WOULD BE UP TO MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE HOW TO REGULATE IT.
01:32:01.300: >> OKAY.
01:32:01.567: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: SO YOU WOULD PROBABLY NOT NECESSARILY ASSIGN IT. IT COULD JUST SORT OF BE FLEX PARKING, OR YOU COULD ASSIGN IT.
01:32:06.705: >> WE COULD TO AN EXTENT, BUT I THINK IF WE ARE NOT GOING TO ASSIGN IT AND WE KEEP A COUPLE OF SPACES, THEN THEY WOULD SAY IT'S GOING TO BE USED FOR LYFT OR UBER.
01:32:16.649: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: OKAY.
01:32:17.783: >> AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF SNEAKING UP ON ALL OF US, AND WE ARE ALL TRYING TO CATCH UP AND KEEP UP.
01:32:23.322: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: YEAH.
01:32:24.189: >> BUT IT'S A REALITY, AND IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
01:32:28.227: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: NO.
01:32:30.329: >> WE UNDERSTAND.
01:32:31.130: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: I GUESS ANOTHER FOR THE RECORD COMMENT, WHEN I READ THE TRAFFIC STUDY SAID THERE WERE GOING TO BE NO INCREASED INTERACTS, I CAN'T FULLY BELIEVE THAT -- IMPACTS, I CAN'T FULLY BELIEVE THAT. MAYBE THAT NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE WILL OWN CARS IS HOPEFULLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BUT I CAN JUST ENVISION SO MANY UBERS AND LYFTS DROPPING PEOPLE OFF, MAYBE IN THE ALLEY. ONE OTHER THING, I ALSO LOVE THE BIKE PARKING, BUT THEN YOU GET IN THE BUILDING, AND I'M GUESSING, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT MOST DEVELOPMENTS ARE, THE ELEVATOR WILL BE WHAT PEOPLE WILL PRIMARILY GO TO. THE STAIRS ARE MOST LIKELY LIKE FIRE STAIRS. IS THERE ANY WAY TO MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON MAYBE THE SECOND OR THIRD FLOOR TO TAKE THE STAIRS? I SAW ONE ON THE PACKARD END, AND THAT'S THE LOWER SIDE OF THE BU BUILDING, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GLASS --
01:33:28.987: >> THE STAIRS ON THE INSIDE, WE WILL DO A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO MAKE THEM ATTRACTIVE. THAT'S NOT A QUESTION. IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND, BUT ALL OF THE BIKE SPACES ARE EFFECTIVELY ACCESSIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE. YOU JUST HAVE TO PICK YOUR PATH, AND THERE MAY BE A RAMP OR SOMETHING INVOLVED, BUT TO GET TO THOSE, YOU'RE NOT GOING UP AND DOWN, AND WE'LL WORK TO SEE IF WE CAN SNEAK ANOTHER DOOR IN OUT OF THE THIRD ONE. THE OTHER TWO I THINK ACTUALLY WORK PRETTY WELL.
01:33:55.414: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: YOU CAN PROMISE THE STAIRS WON'T BE TYPICAL, STAIRS THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE UNLESS THEY ARE FORCED TO. I HATE THE IDEA OF PEOPLE, YOU LIVE ON THE SECOND OR THIRD FLOOR, AND YOU SEE THE ELEVATOR, AND THAT'S JUST THE EASIER OPTION, IF THE STAIRS CAN BE AN EASIER (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) --
01:34:11.096: >> THE STAIRS ARE BASICALLY RIGHT NEXT TO THE ELEVATOR.
01:34:14.032: >> RIGHT NEXT TO IT.
01:34:15.400: >> AND THE STAIRS THAT WE USUALLY DO ON A BUILDING LIKE THIS, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THEY ARE PANELED IN WOOD. THEY ARE FIRE STAIRS, BUT WE DO USUALLY DO A REALLY GOOD OF TRYING TO DO THE INSIDE AS SOMETHING THAT HAS A NICE FEEL TO IT.
01:34:28.313: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: OKAY, GREAT.
01:34:29.615: >> SO IT'S KIND OF DONE WITH SENSIBLE, DURABLE MATERIALS.
01:34:33.185: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: DOES THERE HAVE TO BE A FIRE DOOR, OR CAN IT BE ON THE INSIDE --
01:34:39.858: >> IT DOES, YEAH.
01:34:40.993: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: THE ONE OTHER THING REGARDING PUBLIC ART, I DID NOTICE IN ONE OF THE RENDERINGS, ON -- THERE WAS SORT OF LIKE A BEER DEPOT, A MURAL ON THAT ONE SIDE. I MEAN, SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE COOL. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON DOING ANYTHING ON THAT WALL OR IF THAT WAS JUST IN THE RENDERING.
01:34:57.843: >> WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BEER DEPOT SIGN IN FRONT OF OUR WALL.
01:35:03.182: >> I THOUGHT THAT WAS --
01:35:05.017: >> THAT'S OUR FREE PUBLIC ART.
01:35:07.352: >> MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY ON THAT FOR HOPS, A PAINTING.
01:35:11.056: >> WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING SOME OF THE ART BEING ATTACHED TO THE WALL, AND THAT COULD BE IN THE FORM OF A PAINTING OR SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT WE GET EVERYBODY'S OPINION. I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE GOING TO GET A DIRECTION, BUT THAT MIGHT BE --
01:35:24.703: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: RIGHT, A SUGGESTION. IN GENERAL, I ALSO REALLY LIKED THE COLORS, BUT GRAY IS MY FAVORITE COLOR. SO, THAT'S IT.
01:35:33.378: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:35:39.051: >> MAIN STREET FACADE, SO THE DARKEST -- I'M COOL WITH. TALKING ABOUT UNITS VERSUS RETAIL, SO YOU ALLUDED TO THE DIFFERENT GLASS, IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT, MAIN STREET RESIDENTIAL VERSUS WHAT MAIN STREET RETAIL LOOKS LIKE FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
01:36:03.508: >> YEAH, LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET TO -- SO, HERE YOU CAN SEE IT GOING ACROSS THAT ENTIRE FRONT, AND IT'S SUCH A LONG BUILDING THAT I THINK THIS ELEVATION, WHEN YOU LOOK AT MAIN STREET, PROBABLY DOES THE BEST JOB. OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU LOOK ON THE LEFT OF THAT, THERE'S THE TOWER, AND WE TRY TO BREAK THE TOWER INTO A CORNER ELEMENT, AND THEN WE HAVE THE DARK BRICK THAT KIND OF RUNS ACROSS. AS WE DO THAT, WITHIN ALL OF THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE STOREFRONT, BUT THEN WHEN WE SWITCH TO THE LOWER PART OF THE BUILDING, WHICH KIND OF CONNECTS ACROSS HERE WITH THE TREES AND THE TRELLIS ON THE TOP, THEN WE ACTUALLY SWITCH TO A FULL BEDDED LIGHTER BRICK, AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE OF A RESIDENTIAL STYLE WINDOW. IT'S STILL BIG, BECAUSE THOSE ARE VERY TALL UNITS. IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY TO GET A UNIT THAT'S BASICALLY GOT A RETAIL HEIGHT SPACE, WHICH IS PHENOMENAL. WE ARE KEEPING THE ACCESS POINTS TO THE INSIDE, SO THAT SECURITY IS STILL SOLID AND WE ARE NOT BREAKING THE SECURITY FOR THE WHOLE BUILDING, WHICH IS REALLY RIGHT NOW KIND OF SET UP TO BE AT THE TWO ENTRY POINTS, AND THEN WE TRANSITION BACK TO THE DARK MATERIAL UNTIL WE GET TO THE CORNER, WHICH BENDS HERE, AND THEN WE HAVE THE LIGHTER MATERIAL WITH THE STOREFRONT AND THAT WRAPS AROUND. IN THOSE LIGHTER MATERIAL AREAS, WE ACTUALLY HAVE STOREFRONT AND CURTAIN WALL, SO WHEN WE GO UP ABOVE, IT BECOMES CURTAIN WALL. I AM SURE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED TYPE OF GLASS MATERIAL.
01:37:34.333: >> UH-HUH, THAT'S HELPFUL. JUST CLARIFYING THAT IS HELPFUL. I'M ACTUALLY NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT TRAFFIC AND UBER AND LYFT, AND THIS COMES DOWN TO KIND OF TWO POINTS FOR ME. FURTHER DOWN SOUTH MAIN, WE SEE TWO NEW LARGE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT I HAVE NOT HAD A LARGE FRICTION WITH THE DROP-OFFS ON MAIN STREET, AND SEEING THAT MAIN STREET BETWEEN HURON AND ANNE WITH THE D.D.A. IMPROVEMENTS, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT DOING THE BUMPOUT AT THE COURTHOUSE SO THAT THEY CAN DO THE DROP-OFF AND IT'S A RIGHT TURN ONLY LANE. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GOT TWO LANES GOING NORTH, ONE IS RIGHT TURN ONLY FOR THE BLOCK, DOES THAT AFFORD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE -- SO I ACTUALLY SEE A POTENTIAL FOR STREET TRAFFIC REENGINEERING ON MAIN STREET TO REACT TO THIS, AND SOMETHING JUST HAS TO COME FIRST. SO I'M NOT ACTUALLY NOT TOO CONCERNED WITH HOW MAIN STREET MIGHT REACT, AND WE MIGHT SEE A ONE-LANE MAIN STREET MOVE A BLOCK SOUTH, BECAUSE OF THE DENSITY OF ACTIVITY BECAUSE OF THIS PROJECT. SO I THINK HAVING AN OPEN ALLEY, I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE -- WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO SUCCESSFUL ALLEYS THAT CAN MANAGE -- I THINK THERE'S A BIG GARBAGE ISSUE DOWNTOWN. I THINK THERE'S TRAFFIC AND LOADING ISSUES DOWNTOWN, AND THIS IS GIVING YOU THE ROOM TO DO A LOT OF THOSE THINGS THAT OTHER HISTORIC ALLEYS DON'T AFFORD. SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT EFFORT TO KIND OF CONSIDER WHAT YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH, WHICH IS NOT BREAKING UP THAT MAIN STREET, TWO SHORT RUNS ON THE OTHER TWO SIDES, WHICH BECOME CONFLICT POINTS IF YOU HAVE GAPS. SO I APPRECIATE IT. AND THAT'S IT. THANKS.
01:39:23.875: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO, A COUPLE OF COMMENTS FROM ME. SO, IN REGARDS TO THE ALLEY, SO I LIVE TWO BLOCKS FROM THIS BUILDING, AND THIS ALLEY IS LIKE REALLY USED. NEIGHBORS FROM PACKARD TO -- WHETHER THEY ARE USING IT FOR A CUT-THROUGH OR WHATEVER THEIR REASON IS, THE ALLEY IS SUCH THAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE -- THE USE OF IT IS GOING TO CON CONTINUE, AND ESPECIALLY WITH NEIGHBORS LIVING IN THIS BUILDING. IT'S GOING TO BE A PRETTY HEAVILY USED AREA, AND WITH REGARDS TO PUBLIC ART, YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH IT, BUT, YOU KNOW, JUST LOOKING AT THE WALL THERE, THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR WALL ART THERE, AND SO I GUESS I'M HOPING THAT LANDMARK WOULD COMMIT TO DOING SOME PUBLIC ART ALONG THE ALLEY, JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO WIDELY USED. RESIDENTS ARE GOING TO BE USING IT, SO I'M HOPING TO HAVE SOME COMMITMENT IN THAT REGARD. I AM SURE THE ANN ARBOR ARTS CENTER IS HAPPY TO HELP YOU PUT UP MORE WORK. I AM SURE THEY WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET MORE ARTISTS INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY. SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY NEEDED, AND MY HOPE IS BEFORE THIS LANDS AT CITY COUNCIL, IF COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN CAN MAKE SURE -- YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL PUBLIC ART. WITH A BUILDING FOR THIS SIZE TO HAVE ONE REAL PIECE, IT SEEMS LIKE WE COULD DO A LOT BETTER HERE, AND BEING THAT THE ALLEY IS SO WELL USED, I THINK THAT'S A GREAT SPOT TO INVIGORATE THAT ALLEY AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF ALLEYS BEING USED IN OTHER CITIES, AND THE HOPE IS DOWN THE ROAD, THAT WILL BE THE CASE IN ANN ARBOR. SO, QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE TRAFFIC STUDY. WAS THE TRAFFIC STUDY DONE WITH REGARDS TO -- OR DID IT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE RECENTLY OCCURRED ON WILLIAM, WITH REGARDS TO THE BIKE LANE?
01:41:20.358: >> SCOTT WILL COVER THAT.
01:41:26.164: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OR LET'S START WITH WHEN WAS THE TRAFFIC STUDY DONE.
01:41:31.469: >> I WOULD SAY IT WAS COLD. IT WAS AFTER -- IT WAS AFTER STATE STREET REOPENED. WE HAD TO WAIT, BECAUSE, REMEMBER, STATE STREET WAS CLOSED
01:41:46.051: >> SEPTEMBER?
01:41:46.851: >> WHICH TOTALLY CHANGED THE DYNAMICS OF PEOPLE GOING NORTH AND SOUTH IN THE CITY. SO WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL STATE STREET REOPENED. I THINK THAT WAS THE END OF JANUARY OR FEBRUARY, ABOUT THAT TIME.
01:42:01.199: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY.
01:42:02.267: >> YES. SO THE BIKE LANE WAS TOTALLY CONTEMPLATED AT THE TIME AND ACTUALLY ENTIRELY PLANNED AT THAT POINT. IT WAS READY FOR A SPRING START, SO THAT WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THEY CONSIDERED THE TRAFFIC MOVEMENTS AND FLOWS AND PATTERNS.
01:42:16.982: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. SO THAT WAS MY CONCERN, OF JUST, YOU KNOW, THAT HAS DRASTICALLY CHANGED WHAT WILLIAM LOOKS LIKE. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF POSITIVES. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME NEGATIVES IN THAT REGARD. WAS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL -- I DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY CONFINE THE TRAFFIC STUDY, BUT WAS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO ANY PRECAUTIONS OR ANY OTHER ACTIONS THAT THE CITY OR THE DEVELOPER SHOULD TAKE FOR -- IN REGARDS TO TRAFFIC SAFETY AND SUCH? YOU KNOW, WITH THE ALLEYS, THE WAY THEY ARE STRUCTURED, ESPECIALLY EXITING ON TO PACKARD WHERE YOU HAVE AN INTERSECTION RIGHT THERE, A CROSSWALK, WAS THERE ANY, WITH REGARDS TO ONE WAY, THE OTHER WAY, MAKING IT -- DOING ANY CHANGES THERE?
01:43:00.959: >> NO, NOT ACTUALLY ON PACKARD. ON WILLIAMS IT WAS SUGGESTED, AND WE HAVE DONE THIS IN OTHER PLACES, SUCH AS 611 EAST UNIVERSITY, WHERE PEOPLE WERE PULLING OUT OF THAT DEVELOPMENT THERE ON TO THE SIDEWALK. IT'S SUGGESTED THAT A MIRROR BE PUT UP SO THAT A DRIVER CAN SEE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
01:43:20.111: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY.
01:43:21.079: >> YEAH, ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THE WILLIAM STREET ENTRANCE IS A LITTLE MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN PACKARD, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE PACKARD, YOU GET A BETTER VIEW. YOU HAVE GOT A LONGER SHOT. I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK AT THE DRIVEWAY GOING ON TO PACKARD AND TO THE LEFT YOU CAN SEE A HUNDRED YARDS. TO THE RIGHT, YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD VIEW ALL THE WAY TO THE INTERSECTION. PULLING OUT BETWEEN THE BEER DEPOT AND THE NEW BUILDING IS A LITTLE MORE PROBLEMATIC, AND THAT'S WHERE IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT A MIRROR BE PUT UP.
01:43:50.608: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:43:53.878: >> UH-HUH.
01:43:54.179: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND THEN ANY IDEA WHAT THE PLANS ARE FOR RETAIL? YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SEEN SOME BUILDINGS ON SOUTH MAIN THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT THAT HAVE HAD EMPTY RETAIL SPOTS. IS THERE A PLAN AT THIS POINT FOR RETAIL?
01:44:06.124: >> WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC TENANTS LINED UP AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE INCLUDED THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, GREASE TRAPS AND PLANNING AND WHATNOT FOR THE RETAIL SPACE THAT EXISTS TO BE UP TO 80% RESTAURANT BUT DON'T HAVE ANY ACTUAL TENANTS YET.
01:44:25.777: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. AND I THINK OVERALL, BASED ON, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS BUILDING SINCE THE SUBMISSION HAPPENED, ACTUALLY, PROBABLY IN THE LAST YEAR, THE INITIAL SUBMISSION. SO DESIGN-WISE, I THINK IT LOOKS A LOT BETTER, SO I COMPLEMENT THE DESIGN TEAM ON THAT. BASED ON WHAT I INITIALLY SAW, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY GET THROUGH DESIGN BOARD WITHOUT SOME COMMENTS, AND OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T, SO THANK YOU TO THE PETITIONER FOR MAKING THE CHANGES THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:45:02.080: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  JUST ONE SMALL COMMENT. THANKS FOR INCLUDING THE DARK SKIES COMPLIANT LIGHTING. JUST ONE LITTLE PIECE TO POSSIBLY LOOK AT, IF IT CAN BE INTEGRATED AT ALL, THERE'S SO MUCH GLASS ON THAT CORNER, WHICH I LOVE AESTHETICALLY, BUT THE MORE I LEARNED ABOUT BIRD DEATHS AND COLLISIONS IN URBAN BUILDINGS, IF ANY OF YOUR TEAM WANTS TO LOOK AT IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO PREVENT THOSE SMALL COLLISIONS, THAT WOULD BE A GREAT THING TO LOOK AT. THANKS.
01:45:38.550: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:45:39.551: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. QUICKLY, I THINK THE ALLEY AT WILLIAM IS A GREAT SPACE FOR A MURAL. I THINK IT WOULD REALLY LIVEN IT UP, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ANY DIRECTION. I WOULD ECHO THAT. AND I THINK ALSO -- I THINK COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL HAD A GREAT POINT ABOUT WILLIAM AND MAIN, ABOUT REALLY HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING SIGNATURE THERE THAT INVITES PEOPLE TO CROSS THE STREET AND, YOU KNOW, INTERFACE WITH YOUR BUILDING MORE AND THAT PART OF DOWNTOWN MORE. WE RECENTLY MADE A SIMILAR REQUEST TO VICK VILLAGE SOUTH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF DOWNTOWN, AND BETWEEN PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL, THEY WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MAKE A BIG IMPROVEMENT THAT ADDED A LOT OF QUALITY AND CHARACTER TO THE CORNER OF THEIR BUILDING, WHICH IS IN AN ICONIC LOCATION AS WELL. SO MAYBE DON'T REPLICATE WHAT THEY DID BUT TAKE NOTES. I RESPECT THAT YOU'RE MIRRORING KIND OF THE MAIN STREET AT PACKARD AND MAIN STREET AT WILLIAM. I THINK IT WORKS FOR PACKARD, JUST BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE SHORTER, BUT IT'S A LOT OF THE SAME AT WILLIAM AND MAIN, AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO REALLY -- SOMETHING TO REALLY BRING THAT TO LIFE WOULD BE GREAT. AND THEN TO PUT A FINER POINT ON TO COMMISSIONER ABRONS' LOB, A QUESTION TO THE DEVELOPER, WOULD YOU PUT FOUR UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO THIS BUILDING? [ LAUGHTER ] [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ].
01:47:07.572: >> I MEAN, SO, FROM A -- I MEAN FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT, WE ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO BALANCE, YOU KNOW, HAVING A PROJECT THAT'S ECONOMICALLY VIABLE WHILE COMPETING WITH CONSTRUCTION COSTS, THE NEED TO HAVE A VERY SUSTAINABLE BUILDING, WHICH ALSO INCREASES THE COSTS OF THE PROJECT AND THE MATERIALS THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, REQUIRED IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AND SO WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO -- IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE ON THIS PROJECT IN TERMS OF DESIGN AND AESTHETICS, BUILDING DESIGN AND UNIT MIX TO MAKE A PROJECT THAT WORKS. AND SO WE CAN, YOU KNOW, TRY AND EXPLORE THAT FURTHER, BUT, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SAY THAT DEFINITIVELY RIGHT NOW.
01:48:07.398: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. DO YOU HAVE AN ANTICIPATION OF WHAT RESIDENTS WILL BE FOR A ONE BEDROOM?
01:48:16.307: >> I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER RIGHT NOW, BUT WE HAVE STUDIED THE ANN ARBOR MARKET PRETTY EXTENSIVELY IN TERMS OF --
01:48:24.782: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: 2,200?
01:48:25.984: >> -- UNDERWRITING. THAT'S PROBABLY IN THE BALLPARK. SO, YOU KNOW, WE --
01:48:32.924: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIKE AN IMPACT, SO TWO ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE UNITS WOULD BE AN IMPACT OF ABOUT $24,000 A YEAR.
01:48:40.198: >> THAT SOUNDS IN THE BALLPARK. THAT SOUNDS IN THE BALLPARK.
01:48:48.773: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. CAN YOUR --
01:48:52.210: >> I MEAN, IT'S NOT QUITE A FAIR COMPARISON THOUGH, BECAUSE THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AN AFFORDABLE UNIT HAS TO BE A MINIMUM OF 600 SQUARE FEET, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER THAN WHAT WE ARE PLANNING FOR, SAY, A STUDIO UNIT IN THE BUILDING. SO, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS WILL HAVE AN OUTSIZED IMPACT ON THE REST OF THE UNIT MIX BECAUSE OF THAT MINIMUM SIZE REQUIREMENT AS CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED IN THE CODE. SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S QUITE EXACTLY THE ECONOMIC DIFFERENCE.
01:49:26.244: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY.
01:49:28.012: >> IF THAT MAKES SENSE.
01:49:30.348: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  I GET IT. BUT YOU ARE INCLUDING 10% OF YOUR UNITS ARE ONE BEDROOM, AND ARE THOSE AROUND 600 SQUARE FEET?
01:49:40.958: >> THEY ARE ALL SMALLER.
01:49:43.294: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THEY ARE ALL SMALLER THAN 600?
01:49:44.962: >> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT PORTION OF THE CODE, HONESTLY, IT'S GONE AFTER THIS, OR MAYBE A FEW OTHER PROJECTS. IT'S JUST OUTDATED, UNFORTUNATELY. THE SIZE IS REALLY BIG. 600 SQUARE FEET IS A REALLY, REALLY BIG ONE BEDROOM.
01:50:00.778: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  IT'S BIGGER THAN MY ONE BEDROOM.
01:50:03.715: >> SO, RIGHT NOW, THOSE ARE TWO SPECIFIC UNITS THAT ARE LARGER THAN ANY OTHER ONE BEDROOMS. I WISH THERE WAS AN ABILITY TO DO FOUR STUDIOS OR SOMETHING ELSE, BECAUSE THAT STILL WOULD ACCOMMODATE THE GOAL. YOU WOULD GET MORE UNITS, BUT THE SQUARE FOOTAGE COULD BE MUCH SMALLER, AND IT'S THE SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE AS OTHER UNITS IN THE BUILDING, SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO PULL A FAST ONE ON ANYBODY.
01:50:25.603: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY.
01:50:26.904: >> THINGS HAVE JUST REALLY SHRUNK, AND IT'S MORE ABOUT OFFERING ALL OF THESE AMENITY SPACES TO EVERYBODY TO SHARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR LIVING AREA.
01:50:34.846: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION WHEN WE SIT AT A DIFFERENT TABLE. I SIT OVER THERE, SO...
01:50:42.186: >> AND I MEAN, I DIDN'T -- AND I MEAN THAT IN A SERIOUS SENSE. WE WILL LOOK INTO IT LEGITIMATELY.
01:50:48.025: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU.
01:50:50.728: >> CAN I ASK MY QUESTION? IF WE DO LOOK INTO IT, SINCE I'M THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT, IS IT POSSIBLE TO COME BACK WITH A SMALLER, PRACTICAL-SIZED UNIT FOR CONSIDERATION, IF THERE WERE MORE OF THEM?
01:51:04.909: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  I WOULD LEAVE YOU TO DISCUSS THAT WITH STAFF AND CITY ATTORNEY, PROBABLY.
01:51:11.549: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I THINK STAFF WILL TRY TO DO EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO TRY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
01:51:15.686: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE REQUEST.
01:51:17.822: >> AND I, FOR ONE, WOULD SAY THAT AS LONG AS IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN WHAT YOU HAVE OFFERED IN THE BUILDING, I THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT, AND I KNOW THINGS ARE CHANGING, BUT THAT DOES SEEM BIG TO ME, SO JUST IN TERMS OF STAFF'S HEARING WHAT ONE OF US HAS TO SAY. I WOULD SAY IF THEY MEET WHAT, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE ALREADY OFFERING, THEN THAT SEEMS TOTALLY LEGITIMATE TO ME. BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE A HOLE IN OUR CODE, FRANKLY, WHEN I HEAR THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT IT'S 600 SQUARE FEET.
01:51:50.121: >> I'M PRETTY SURE SOMEONE IS GOING TO BRING IT UP IN COMMISSION-PROPOSED BUSINESS.
01:51:53.925: >> I MEAN, IT'S ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF.
01:51:56.861: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THAT'S TRUE.
01:51:57.929: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: MOVING FORWARD.
01:52:01.432: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL RIGHT. READY FOR A VOTE? ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. THANK YOU.
01:52:12.777: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THOSE SAMPLES. I THINK YOU'RE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST, AND THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL, SO THANK YOU.
01:52:24.755: >> THANK YOU.
01:52:28.993: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS 2511 NEWPORT ROAD ANNEXATION AND ZONING, THE LOHMANN PROPERTY, FOR CITY COUNCIL. WE WILL BEGIN WITH A STAFF REPORT.
01:52:49.647: >> THIS SITE IS LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEWPORT ROAD, NORTH OF BURR ROAD. THE SITE IS ON THE HURON WATERSHED. PETITIONER REQUESTED A 1.55 ACRE PARCEL IN ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP. THEY ARE REQUESTING THIS PARCEL SINCE IT IS WITHIN THE CONTIGUOUS BOUNDARIES OF THE CITY. THE OWNER HAS REQUESTED WATER AND SANITARY SEWER SERVICE FROM THE CITY SINCE THEIR SEPTIC SYSTEM HAS FAILED. STAFF RECOMMENDS THIS PETITION BE APPROVED BECAUSE THE PROPERTY IS WITHIN THE CITY'S UTILITY SERVICE AREA, AND THE PROPOSED R1A ZONING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADJACENT ZONING, SURROUNDING LAND USES AND RECOMMENDED PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES SINGLE-FAMILY DETACHED USES.
01:53:43.367: >> IF THERE IS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE HEARING. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE LOHMANN ANNEXATION AND R1A (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT) ZONING (2511 NEWPORT ROAD). MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ANY DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER WOODS.
01:54:11.195: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  SO, MY QUESTION IS GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN GAVE US EARLIER, COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US HOW WE ARE TO PROCEED ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM, GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME LEGAL ISSUES?
01:54:31.248: >> I'M HAPPY TO. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ANNEXATIONS THAT WE WORK WITH AT THE CITY. ONE, OUR OWNER-INITIATED ANNEXATIONS, SUCH AS THIS, WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER NEEDS WATER, SANITARY, TYPICALLY, AND SUBMITS A PETITION, PAYS A FEE. THOSE ARE PETITIONS THAT ARE NEVER CONTESTED.
01:54:50.201: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY.
01:54:51.135: >> SEPARATELY, WE HAVE A SECOND WAY THAT WE GO ABOUT ANNEXING TOWNSHIP ISLAND PARCELS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THROUGH A CITY-INITIATED PROCESS, AND THAT INCLUDES CITY STAFF IDENTIFYING PARCELS THAT WE THINK MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO BE ANNEXED, AND SUBMITTING OUR OWN APPLICATION MATERIALS TO THE STATE BOUNDARY COMMISSION, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT COMMISSION ENTIRELY FROM THE OTHER PROCESS THAT YOU SEE REGULARLY, IN TERMS OF THESE OWNER-INITIATED ANNEXATIONS. SO WHAT MEMBER ACKERMAN MENTIONED WAS THAT WE HAD SUBMITTED PETITIONS FOR OUR SECOND ROUND OF ANNEXATIONS, AND THE CHAIR OF L. A.R.A. LICENSING AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS, DENIED THE PETITION FOR ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP PARCELS AND PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP PARCELS. SHE APPROVED THE PETITIONS FOR SCIO TOWNSHIP, BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE ARE VACANT PARCELS, AND WE WOULD NOT BE REQUIRING CONNECTION TO WATER OR SANITARY IN THOSE CASES. THE BOUNDARY COMMISSION ITSELF RECOMMENDED AGAINST ANNEXATION FOR ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP AND FOR PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP, BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF THE CITY FORCING PEOPLE TO CONNECT IF THEY HAD FUNCTIONING UTILITY SYSTEMS, LIKE WELL AND SEPTIC. SO, TWO DIFFERENT ROUTES.
01:56:28.532: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY.
01:56:29.600: >> YOU'LL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO SEE MORE OF THESE TRICKLE IN, THESE OWNER-INITIATED ANNEXATIONS, AND I THINK THE ROUND TWO PETITIONS, AS COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN POINTED OUT, WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT STORY.
01:56:46.951: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. THANK YOU. THAT WAS HELPFUL.
01:56:50.955: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
01:56:51.956: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: YEAH, I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION.
01:56:55.826: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA, IT'S 2731 NEWPORT ROAD ANNEXATION AND ZONING, TALPOSE-KNIGHT FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE'LL BEGIN WITH A STAFF REPORT.
01:57:18.849: >> IT'S IN WARD 1. PETITIONER HAS REQUESTED ANNEXATION FROM ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP AND R1A ZONING FOR THIS 1.3 ACRE PARCEL. THERE IS A SINGLE-FAMILY HOME ON THE PARCEL. STAFF RECOMMENDS THE PETITION BE APPROVED BECAUSE THE LOTS ARE WITHIN THE CITY'S WATER AND SEWER SERVICE AREA, AND THE RECOMMENDED ZONING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADJACENT ZONING AND SURROUNDING LAND USES, AS WELL AS THE CITY MASTER PLAN.
01:57:49.547: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. IF THERE IS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU'LL HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SEEING NO ONE, I'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE 2731 NEWPORT ROAD ANNEXATION AND R1A (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT) ZONING. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER WOODS. DISCUSSION? SEEING NONE, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. MOVING ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION, THIS IS THE TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO ANY ITEM AT ALL. IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM. SEEING NO ONE, WE'LL MOVE ON TO COMMISSION-PROPOSED BUSINESS. COMMISSIONER MILLS.
01:58:53.377: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THANK YOU. MR. KHAN, COULD YOU PLEASE ADD TO OUR -- HAVE MR. LENART ADD TO OUR LIST OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AT SOME POINT LOADING AND DELIVERY ZONES AND UNDERSTANDING -- I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND POTENTIALLY THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE NONMOTORIZED -- I DON'T KNOW, JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON, PARTICULARLY IN THE D1 AND D2 DISTRICTS, I THINK WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. AND WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE.
01:59:26.844: >> WILL DO.
01:59:30.981: >> THANK YOU.
01:59:31.615: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:59:32.583: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I WAS REALLY ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT O.R.C. IS TALKING ABOUT WAIVING SOLAR PANELS AS PART OF THE HEIGHT CALCULATION AND ALSO INCENTIVIZING E.V.  THE OTHER ONE THAT I HEARD TONIGHT IS MAYBE RE-EXAMINING L.E.E.D. AS THE CRITERIA WE USE FOR INCENTIVIZING BONUS F.A.R. OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY DETERMINATIONS NOW, BUT IT SOUNDED AS THOUGH THE DEVELOPER WAS SAYING THEY GET A LARGE NUMBER OF THEIR 50 SOME POINTS BY JUST BEING IN AN URBAN AREA, AND BY DEFINITION, ALL OF THESE PROJECTS WILL BE IN URBAN AREAS, AND SO IF WE WANT TO BE INCENTIVIZING CERTAIN SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS, MAYBE L.E.E.D.

02:00:24.201: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT, I BELIEVE PREVIOUSLY PART OF THE REASON WHY MANY OF THE PETITIONERS DID NOT DO THE L.E.E.D. CERTIFICATION WAS DUE TO THE COSTS, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY HAD TO DO. THE COSTS WAS ONE OF THE BIGGER ITEMS, SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT, IF IT'S JUST -- MAYBE THERE ARE SOME OTHER METRICS THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE.
02:00:47.157: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  LIKE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COST OF ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING IN L.E.E.D. PROGRAMS, AS OPPOSED TO --
02:00:55.733: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  MAYBE THEY COULD OFFER AFFORDABLE UNITS IN LIEU OF THOSE COSTS, SO SOMETHING TO LOOK AT. FURTHER COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS? COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:01:06.176: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  THE 600-SQUARE FOOT MINIMUM FOR THE AFFORDABLE UNIT, IS THAT ALREADY A NONISSUE IN THE NEW -- HOW DOES A NEW PREMIUM -- IS THERE A MINIMUM IN THE NEW PREMIUM THAT'S LOWER? OR THERE'S NO MINIMUM?
02:01:18.188: >> I'M AFRAID I DID NOT WORK ON THAT SECTION OF CODE, SO IT'S SO NEW THAT I HAVE NEVER USED IT. SO I'M AFRAID I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO ANSWER.
02:01:30.367: >> MAYBE I COULD GO DO THE RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT. I JUST THOUGHT IF ANYONE KNEW, I WAS CURIOUS.
02:01:36.974: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  MY RECOLLECTION IS BUILDING CODE WOULD BE WHAT GOVERNS IT, THAT INSTEAD OF T
