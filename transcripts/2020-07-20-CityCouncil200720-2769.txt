00:05:31.332: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA. MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AGENDA IS APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATION TODAY FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR.
00:05:47.848: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, MAYOR. A COUE O ITEMS. I WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT THE LIVERIES ARE BACK OPENED AFTER BEING CLOSED FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS. OF AN IMPORTANT NOTE I WANTED TO SHARE ON BEHALF OF THE CLERK AND COUENCOURAGE OUR VOTER WHO HAVE INDUSTRY BALLOTS TO TURN THEM. IN THE DEADLINE FORHE BALLOTS TO BE RECEIVED IS AUGUS AUGUST 4th AT 8 P.M. THEY HAVE TO BE RECEIVED AT CITY HALL BY THE CLERK. WE ENCOURAGE WHEN YOU ARE READY TO GET THOSE IN. LASTLY, I WANTED TO BRING ADNISTTOR COMMUNICATION REGARDING THE FINANCIAL UPDATE FOR THE CITY. THE COVID REPORTS SUMMARIZED WHAT HAPPENED SINCE LAST MONTH. THE WATER AND SEWER FUNDS OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR, WHAT WE CAL FISCAL '20 AND '21 ARE PROJECTED TO BE WITHIN $500,000 OF EACH FUND. SHORTFALL -- REVENUE SHORTFALL. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER THAT BY DEFERRING SOME CAPITAL PROJECTS. THOSE DECISIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE SMALLER THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION, THE LOCAL AND MAJOR STREET FUNDS RECEIVED MONIES FROM THE STATE. WE ARE NOT SURE YET WHERE THOSE -- THE STATE IS GOING TO BE IN FULFILLING THEIR PLAN TO SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR ROAD REPAIR. IF THEY DO NOT FULFILL THAT, THEN WE DO HAVE SOME CAPITAL OJECTS WE COULDEFER BUT AT THIS TIME THIS PROJECT HAS NOT BEEN DEFERRED. LASTLY THE GENERAL FUND, YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT OPERATING FUND, FISCAL '20 WAS EXPECTED TO HAVE A $3.8 MILLION LOSS IN REVENUE. YOU ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO -- THROUGH YOUR BUDGET PROCESS, TO EXPEND SOME FUNDS INISCAL '20. THROUGH THE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN, WE NOW ANTICIPATE THAT FISCAL '20 WILL BE ABOUT $2.1 MILLION USE OF FUND BANCE. SO THAT'S -- IN MY VIEW, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, COMPARED TO WHERE WE STARTED FROM. WE ESTIMATED WE WOULD END THE YEAR WITH ABOUT A 15% UNDESIGNATED FUND BALANCE. RANGBUTTILL NOTELOW OUR OF OUR RANGE LIKE WE ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. FOR F FISCAL '21, THERE'S A REVENUE SHORTFALL THAT WE ANTICIPATED. YOU RECALL WE STARTED THAT YEAR WITH A BALANCED BUDGET. SO THE $6.5 MILLION WAS A CHALLENGE THAT WE HAD. IF WE CONTINUE THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE AND THE FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN, THAT WE IMPLEMENTED ALL ID THIS YEAR, WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER ALL THE $6.5 MILLION. SO THAT'S THE PLAN AT THIS POINT. I DO WANT TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT THE CITY HAS APPLIED FOR A CARES ACT FUNDING THAT'S ELIGIBLE TO CITIES. THE FIRST PORTION OF THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR -- IS FOR APRIL AND MAY POLICE ANDIRE EXPENDITURES. WE ARE ESTATING A REIMBURSEMENT OF 3.5 TO $5 MILLION. IF THAT COMES IN, THAT WOULD BE AROUND SEPTEMBER. SO WE ARE NOT EXPECTING ANY -- I WOULD NOT SUGGEST ANY CHANGES RIGHT NOW IN OUR FINANCIAL SITUATION AS FAR AS SPENDING MONIES BUT WE ARE EXPECTG SIGNIFICANT GRANT FROM THE STATE IF THIS COMES THROUGH. BECAUSE OF OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE SECOND WAVE AND WHAT THE REVENUE PICTURE MAY LOOK LIKE FOR '22, WE DON'T REMAIN IN A POSITION TO SPEND FUNDS AT THIS TIME IS MY RECOMMENDATION. THAT'S THE LATEST UPDATE ON THE REPORT. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, IT'S ATTACHED AND'MAPPY TO FOLLOW UP LER WITH Y. THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
00:09:53.193: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. I HAVE LOST VIDEO. CAN PEOPLE HEAR ME?
00:10:00.334: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.

DIAL STAR NINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. CLERK WILL R IDENTIFY YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS STEPHANIE MERCIER.
00:11:20.914: >> MS. MERCIER.
00:11:21.314: >> GOOD EVENING. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:11:23.617: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN. THANK YOU.
00:11:24.951: >> GREAT. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS. I'M STEPHANIE MERCIER, A RESIDENT OF THE 4th WARD AND I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF IMPACT INVESTMENT FOR A NATIONAL NONPROFIT FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORBLE HOUSING ALIGNED WITH SERVICES. THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WORKS IN 48 STATES INCLUDING MICHIGAN TO PROVIDE CONSULTING, TRAINING, POLICY AND LENDING TO ADVANCE INNOVATION AND HELP CREATE QUALITY, SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN. MY ROLE ON IMPACT, I HAVE SEEN THE EVIDENCE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT ENSURING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH THE SERVICES NEED SUSTAIN IT, HELPS TO BUILD THRIVING COMMUNITIES. I HAVE SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND HERE IN ANN ARBOR AS THE HOUSING COORDINATOR FOR THE HOUSING COORDINATE FOR WASHTENAW COUNTY. I HAVE SEEN THEY TRANSFORM THEIR LIVES, HEALTH, INCOME, C STABILY AND FAMILY AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. IT'S FOR THIS REASON THAT I'M HERE TO SPEAK INAVOR O DC-6, THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE. BACK IN 2007, AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2004, BLUEPRINT TO END HOMELESSNESS, A TASK FORCE WAS FORMED TO EXPLORE LOCALLY VIABLE SOLUTIONS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AND RELATED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDED THREE THINGS. INCREASING PUBC EDUTION ABOUTOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUES, CREATING A 20-YEAR MILLAGE TO FUND HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND ESTABLISHING AND ENNOWMENT THAT ONCE THE MILLAGE HAD EXPIRED WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN PERPETUITY TO FUND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. WE ARE HERE TONIGHT TO DISCUSS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE RECOMMENDED 20-YEAR MILLAGE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RELATED PPORTIVE SERCES. RENT PLING CONDUCTED BY A TOP RED POLLING FIRM EPIC MRA SHOWED 77% OF THOSE POLLED WERE IN FAVOR OF SUCH A MILLAGE. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE MILLAGE LANGUAGE AS PROPOSED AND SPECIFICALLY SOME HAVE BROUGHT UP THE CONCERN THAT IT WOULD FUND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. SINCE THIS IS AN AREA I HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT, I WANTED TO ADDRESS TH SPECIFICALL AS YOU KNOW, THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING X CREDIT PROGRAM IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM IMPOLITICALMENTED AT THE STATE LEVEL BY MISHDA. IT'S TYPICALLY ABOUT 85% OF THE TOTAL. IT REQUIRES APPLICANTS TO DEMONSTRATE THEY HAVE FUNDING FOR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, FOR THE ENTIRE TERM OF THE AFFORDABILITY COMMITMENT PERIOD THEY HAVE APPLIED FOHICH AT MINIMUM IS 15 YRS BUT CAN BE LONGER. THERE'S NO RELIABLE NEW REVENUE SOURCE FOR --
00:13:55.335: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:13:56.369: >> SO NOT HAVING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FUNDED AS PART OF THE MILLAGE WOULD ACTUALLY PUT IN JEOPARDY CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. SERVICES ARE ALSO A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF MAXIMIZING IMPACTS FOR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. ANN ARBOR IS AHRIVING COMMUNITY BUT RESOLUTION DC-6 IT ENSURE THAT WE BUILD UPON THE STRENGTHS FOR ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, REGARDLESS OF INCOME LEVEL, AND MOVE TOWARD BUILDING A MORE EQUITABLE AND VIBRANT FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING. [ SILENCE ]
00:14:40.313: >> Clerk Beaudry: I THINK WE LOST MAYOR TAYLOR.
00:14:50.957: >> Councilmember Ackerman: MAYOR PRO TEM LUMM, DO YOU WANT CALLHE NTPEAKER AND KEEP US MOVING?
00:14:57.564: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD BE HAPPY TO. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S BACK. ARE YOU THERE CHRISTOPHER.
00:15:04.337: >> Mayor Taylor: I AM, INDEED.
00:15:06.439: >> Councilmember Lumm: THE JOB OF A MAYOR PRO TEM.
00:15:12.245: >> Mayor Taylor: WELL DONE. LINDSAY CULKA, MY APOLOGIES.
00:15:26.293: >> Clerk Beaudry: MS. CHULKA, CALLER 697. GO AHEAD.
00:15:28.895: >> YES. GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS LINDSAY CHULKA AND I'M A WARD ONE RESIDENT TO ASKING YOU TO VOTE YES ON DC-6, I'M CALLING YOU TO SPEAK TO Y AN UNDERGRADUATE OF U OF M, AN ADVOCATE FOR THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY AMEBULE OF ANN ARBOR'S TENANT UNIT AND WASHTENAW OUTREACH AND A YOUNG PERSON WHO CARES ABOUT THE PLACE I CALL HOME. IF THE PANDEMIC WAS NOT HAPPENING, THE PUBLIC WOULD GATHER SIGNATURES TO MAKE SUR IS WAS PRESENT ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. THIS IS SOMETHING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE AS A CITY. AT LEAST GIVE US THE CHANCE TO UTILIZE OUR VOTE IN NOVEMBER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT THIS MILLAGE. AND SPOILER ALERT, WE DO! A RECENT POLL CONDUCTED BY PARTNERS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THOSE THREE OUT OF FOUR RESIDES. PLEASE DON'T ACT AS A GATEKEEPER. I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT -- EVERY CANDIDATE I TALKED TO EXPRESSED CONCERNED ABOUT AFFORDABILITY IN THE CITY. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE THAT YOU WILL ACT UPON THIS CONCERN THAT IS ALSO HELD BY THE COMMUNITY. YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE DETAILS OF THIS MILLAGE BETTER THAN I DO, BUT I MUST EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOCIAL FUNDING ALLOCATION. THE THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL AFTER DRESSING HOMELESSNESS IS EFFECT ENVIRONMENT BUT IT CAN NOT BE HOUSING ONLY. FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SERVICES IS A CRUCIAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE UNDERLYING HOUSING SECURITY. I LIVED HERE FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS BUT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MUCH LONGER AS THE CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES AND MEMBERS CONTINUE TO ACT IN THE ENTER OF THE RICH, AND HONESTLY, I WON'T WANT TO -- OR I WON'T HAVEN INTEREST IF WE CONTINUE TO LIVE DOWN THIS RACIAL AND ETHNIC HOMOGENOTIPPIC NAYITY. I CHALLENGE TO CONTINUE SEEKING OUT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND
00:17:26.546: >> May Taylor: ANK YOU.. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ANTHONY SCOTT.
00:17:49.335: >> HELLO, TY COUNSEL SIX THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME -- CITY COUNCIL, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. I'M CURRENTLY HOMELESS. I'M A 61-YEAR-OLD MAN. A THINK DC-6 IS A STEP FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN WASHTENAW COUNTY. I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU LET THIS MILLAGE PASS, WE WILL LESSEN THE HOMELESS AND GIV MORE OPPORTUNITY TO PEOE OF MY AGE AND THE HOMELESS POPULATION TO CALL HOME AND NOT ON THE STREETS OR THE DOORWAYS AND NOT BE A NUANCE TO THE CITY. I BELIEVE THIS MILLAGE IS A 100% YES. OF U AS CITIZENS THE RIGHT FORLL A HOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
00:18:42.755: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. HAD OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KATIE DORCH.
00:18:50.930: >> HI. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
00:18:52.699: >>ayor Taylor:OU BET.
00:18:55.401: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES.
00:18:56.136: >> OKAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MY NAME IS KATIE DORCH AND I HAVE A HOME IN WARD 4. AND I AM -- I WOULD LIKE TO READ YOU A LETTER FROM OUR ATTORNEY. I REPRESENT A GROUP OF ABOUT 50 OR SO SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO READ A LETTER FROM OUR ATTORNEY PAT NNON, LLPN THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT SHORT-TERM RENTAL USAGE WOULD QUALIFY FOR A LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE TREATMENT UNDER THE NEW ORDINANCE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CITY HAS INDICATED TO YOUR GROUP, THAT THE CONTINUATION OF SHORT-TERM RENTAL USES WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE TREATMENT UNDER THE NEW ORDINANCE PROHIBITING SHORT-TERM RENTAL. I FURTHER UNDERSTANDHAT THE BASIS FOR THIS POSITION IS THAT THE CITY IS NOW CHARACTERIZING THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL USES AS A COMMERCIAL USE IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONE. THAT'S NOT A HOME BUSINESS. MY FIRST REACTION IS TO DISAGREE WITH THIS POSITION. THE CRITICAL DETERMINATION WITH RESPECT TO LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE DATA AND THE RIGHT TO NTUE THE U IS WHETHER THE USE W LAWFUL AND PERMITTED PRIOR TO THE IMPOSITION OF THE NEW ORDINANCE. IN THIS CASE, IT APPEARS THAT SHORT-TERM RENTAL USES WERE NOT ONLY LAWFUL, BUT WERE KNOWN AND RECOGNIZED BY THE CITY. ASSUMING THAT IS THE CASE, THE USES SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE STATUS AND SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. THCITY APPEARS TO BE CHANGING THEIR INTERPRETATION AFTER THE FACT A PART OF AN EFFOR TO NEGATE LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE ORDINANCE. THIS APPEARS TO BE A DIRECT ATTACK ON YOUR LEGAL RIGHT TO CONTINUE PREVIOUSLY LAWFUL USES FOLLOWING A POSITION OF A NEW ORDINANCE. LAWFULY. WAST PERMITTED AND REGULATED AND TAXED. OR IF THE USE WAS NOTPROOF LULLSLY LAWFUL, WHY DO THEY NEED A NEW ORDINANCE AT ALL? THE RECHARACTERIZATION OF THE PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTABLE USE AS AN UNLAWFUL NOW COMES OFF AS A TRANSPARENT EFFORT TO SIDE STEP YOUR RIGHTS TO CONTINUE THOSE USES, AS LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USES. THE HEART OF THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE LEGAL NON-CONFORMING IS PROPERTY OWNERS WHO REPLIED ON AN ORDINANCE WHEN THEY GRADUALLY, OVER TIME ELIMINATE THOSE USES FROM CERTAIN ZONING CLASSIFICATIONS. THE CITY'S APPROACH APPEARS DIRECTED AT THE IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF THE PREVIOUSLY PERMITTED USE, RATRHAN A GRADUAL REDUCTION.
00:21:30.490: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:21:31.691: >> PRARATHER THAN THE GRADUAL ELIMINATION AND APPEARS TO VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF OWNER WHO LAWFULLY USED THEIR PROPERTIES FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL PURPOSES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
00:21:45.672: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. HOFFMAXT SPEAKER IS NOAH
00:21:57.784: >> SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I HAD THERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:22:03.056: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:22:04.590: >> GREAT. GREAT. I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE ORDINANCE TO REGULATE SHORT-TERM RENTALS. BE READI A SEPARATE LETTER TO PAT LENNON, ADDRESSED TO MR. POSTEMA AND WHICH WAS EMAILED TO THE CLERK ON JULY 16th. MR. POSTEMA, OUR FIRM REPRESENTS NOAH HOFFMAN AND OTHER RESIDENTS THAT RENT HOMES IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS. SHORT-TE RENTAL ORDINANCE.SED AS DISCUSSED HEREIN, IF THE CITY PROCEEDS WITH IMPOSING THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE, IT SHOULD MODIFY IT AND TREAT EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES AS LEGAL, NON-CONFORMING USES AND ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE. WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE IS NOT FAIR TO OUR CLIENTS OR TO OTHERS THAT HAVE USED AND CONTINUE TO USE THEIR PRERTIES FOR SHORT-TER RENTAL PURPOSES. THESE CITIZENS INVEST IN THEIR PROPERTIES TO RENT THEM AND HAVE PAID HIGHER TAXES DUE TO THEIR QUASI COMMERCIAL STATUS. THE INCOME FROM SHORT-TERM RENTALS HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE A CRITICAL PART OF THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND A CRITICAL SOURCE FOR MAINTAINING THEIR PROPERTIES. IN SOME CASES, THE LS OF RT PALL INCOME, COULDEAD TO THE DECLINE OF MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS AND IT COULD BE DEVASTATING AND LEAD TO FORECLOSURE. BEYOND THE OBVIOUS FAIRNESS ISSUES, THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE AND THE IMPACT RAISES SERIOUS LEGAL ISSUES, SPECIFICALLY YOU ARE CLIENTS AND OTHERS THAT CAN DOCUMENT THE LAWFUL USE OF THEIR PROPERTIES FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL PURPOSES SHOULD CONTINUE THE USE WE ARE INFORMED THAT THE CITY REPRESENTATIVES HAVE T TOLD OUR CLIENTS THAT IT WOULD NOT APPLY AS LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USES AND URGE THE CITY TO EXEMPT PROPERTIES USED FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL PURPOSES. YOU WILL SEE THAT THE RECENTLY DECIDED MICHIGANUPREME COURT CASE, REHUM vs. SPRING LAKE. IT HOLDS THAT EXISTING LAWFUL SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES ARE ENTITLED TO LEGAL NON-CONFORMANCE LEGAL STATUS. IF IT WAS LAWFUL PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF A NEW ORDINANCE, THEN THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS A RIGHTO CONNUE USING THEIR PROPERTY FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS AFTER ACQUISITION OF THE NEW ORDINANCE. THE INVOLVED SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES ARE ALL CURRENTLY LAWFUL USES AND THEY SHOULD ALL BE ENTITLED TO LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE STATUS AS SUCH IT THEY SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE THEHO-TERM RENTAL USES. THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO USE THEIR PROPERTIES FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES IS CRITICAL. THEY ARE ALL LONG-STANDING SUPPORTERS OF THE CITY AND ALL HOPE THE CITY WILL RESPECT THEIR RIGHT TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT USE OF THEIR PROPERTY. UNFORTUNATELY IN THE CITY  TAKES AY THEIR RIGHTS, AND THEY WILL LIKELY SEEK LEGAL ACTION.
00:25:09.976: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:25:20.086: >> THANK YOU.
00:25:21.120: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HEIDI POSHER.
00:25:23.923: >> HI, I'M HEIDI POSHER. 204 BROOKLY I'HERE LIKE NOAH REPRESENTING A GROUP OF NONRESIDENTS, SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS. I LIVE AND OWN OTHER PROPERTIES IN WARD 4. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR HAS DETERMINED THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS SHOULD BE FURTHER REGULATED BEYOND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN UP TO THIS POINT. AND UNTIL NOW, ALL RENTALS, WHETHER FOR ONE DAY OR 365 HAVE BEEN REGULATED, INSCTED AND TAXED VIA TITLE 8 OTHE CITY CODE. THE CITY ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW DETERMINED THAT THE BEST WAY TO REGULATE SGRs IS THROUGH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE CODE. HERE'S THE PROBLEM, THE NEW ORDINANCE REPRESENTS SI ANYTHING AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN HOW THESE RENTALS WILL BE REG REGULATED. IT EXPLICITLY BANS NONSIDENT OCCUPIED SRT-TERM RENTALS IN SOME AREAS OF THE CITY. UNDER THIS ORDINANCE APPROXIMATE APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE WILLS LOSE THEIR PROPERTIES. RECENTLY THE STATE OF MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT, HELD THAT WHEN A DENITION OFEGAL OPERATIONS, LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS MUST BE GRANTED FOR THOSE PREVIOUSLY OPERATING LEGALLY. DESPITE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, THE CITY STAFF HAS NOW DETERMINED THAT ALL NONRESIDENT OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS HAVE BEEN SEPARATING OPG ILLEGALLY. WELL, WE DISAGREE AND THAT'S BASED ON STACKS OF DUMT FRO E CITY THAT CONFIRM REGULATION, INSPECTION, TAXATION, ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE OCCURRED TO THIS POINT UNDER TITLE 8 OF THE CITY CODE. I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. THE NEW INTERPRETATION DOES NOT NTALS UP TO THIS POINT,RNED ALL REGARDLESS OF DURATION. WHEN CHALLENGED OPEN THE WEAKNESS OF THIS ARGUMENT, BOTH STAFF AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL HAVE STATED, THAT THEY REALIZE THIS IS FUZZY LOGIC AND THAT THE -- AND THAT THE CITY EXPECTS TO BE SUED BECAUSE OF IT. THIS IS THE CRUX OF OUR ISSUE. THE CITY'S POSITION SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY INTEND TO USE THIS TRUMPED UP ARGUMENT TO BAR US FROM RIGHTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR US BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. WE WILL HAVE TO SUE IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE AND BENEFIT FROM THESE RIGHTS. THTHIS IS TANMOUNT TO GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. WE REQUEST COUNCIL REQUIRE STAFF ESTABLISH A WORKING GROUP TO DETERMINE HOW OUR RIGHT TO LEGAL CONCONFORMING STATUS WILL BE GRANTED AND AUTHENTICATED. WE WILL BE WORKING FOR THIS FOR ALMOST A YEAR. COUNCIL HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE. IZETH NELS, YOU AREY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE, I'M ASKING YOU SPECIFICALLY TO PROPOSE A FORMATION OF A WORKING GROUP TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. ALSO, I'M HIGHLY IN FAVOR OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
00:28:34.146: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:28:34.747: >> THANK YOU.
00:28:35.514: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LOLA EDEFASO.
00:28:45.424: >> HELLO?
00:28:47.126: >> Mayor Taylor: HELLO, PLEASE PROCEED.
00:28:49.662: >> MY NAME IS LOLA EDEFASO, I'M A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR AND A TAX PAYING MEMBER OF WARD 2. I'M A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN, AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK AGAINST THE ORDINANCE AGAINST SHORT-TERM RENTAL. ABOUT A COUE OF YEARS AGO, A BEGAN TO GET CLOSE TO THE AMERICAN DREAM, WHICH WE ALL SEEK AS PART OF THIS ONE NATION, AND IN THAT PROCESS, MY HUSBAND AND I APPLIED A RENTAL PROPERTY IN ANN ARBOR. WE LOOKED THROUGHOUT THE CITY'S WEBSE. WE CLED MANY OF THE CITY OFFICES FOR GUIDANCE ON WHETHER WE ARE ABLE TO PROCEED IN THE MANNER THAT WE WANTED TO AND WHAT ARE THE RULES AND LAWS WE NEEDED TO FOLLOW. THE FEEDBACK WE GOT FROM ALL AVENUES WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO REGISTER OUR PROPERTY AND HAVE IT INSPECTED, WHICH WE HAVE DONE. AND WE HAVE DONE AT FOR EVERY YEAR THAT WE HAVE OWNED THIS PROPERTY. AND NOW, THE CY IS SAYING THAT WE CAN NO LONGER OPERATE AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHERE THAT DECISION IS BASED. THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTY IS A LIVELIHOOD FOR US, AND SUPPOR OUR FAMILY. ORDINANCE AS DRAFTED, IT LOOKS LIKE THE CITY HAS MODELED, WHAT THE CITY OF AUSTIN HAS DONE WITH SHORT-TERM RENTAL AND IT'S NOT WORKING OUT WELL FOR AUSTIN. IN THE SAME WAY THAT MY -- THE SPEAKERS BEFORE WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED, THIS IS SET IN A URT FOR A LEGAL BATTLE BETWEEN SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS AND THE CITY COUNCIL IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE RULES AND LAWS IN AUSTIN IS ALREADY IN THE COURTS AND THE STATE OF TEXAS IS POISED TO VOTE INTO LAW A MEASURE THAT WOULD UNDO WHAT THE CITY OF AUSTIN HAS DONE. SO THE CITY OF AUSTIN HAS WASTED THE TIME AND MONEY OF ITS CITIZENS TO PUT INTO ACTION AND ORDINANCE THAT  IT CANNOT DEFEND AND IT BREAKS MY HEART THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS AND UNFAIRLY TREATING THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY WHO ARE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AND WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE RULES ANDE HAVE PAID TAXES AND WE HAVE HAD OUR --
00:31:20.346: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS. --
00:31:22.748: >> PROPERTIES INSPECTED IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DO. AND SO THIS CHANGE OF RULE MIDSTREAM FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME IS A MAKE OR BREAK DECISION OF OUR LIVELIHOOD, WHEN WE HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. I'M ASKINHAT MY COUNCILMEMBER, JANE LUMM, SHE PROPOSE THAT THIS ORDINANCE GO BACK AND WORK WITH THE TEAM OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND CURRENT OWNERS TO COME TO A RESOLUTION THAT WILL WORK FOR THE CITY AND THE CURRENT OWNERS. CLERK TIME.
00:32:00.219: >>ay Taylor:HE NEXT SPKER IS BEN RANTON.
00:32:04.590: >> HELD LOCAL. THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS. I'M PLEASED TO SPEAK TO YOU. MY NAME IS BEN RANTA. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS AND LEAVE ON DEXTER DRIVE. FOUR YEARS AGO, I INVESTEDN MOST O MY SAVIN IN BUYING AND RENOVATING A HOME IN ANN ARBOR, KNOWING ALL THE WAY ALONG THAT I WAS IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE CITY FOR MY RENTAL PROPERTY. I WANT TO SPEAK YOU TO ABOUT MY OPPOSITION OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE TO AMEND TITLE 7 WITH REGARD TO SHORT-TERM RENTALS. MEMBERS OF COUNCIL, CITY OFFICIALS VE GONE OECORD ATING THAT TIR GOALS TO MAINTAIN THE SANCTITY OF THE COMMUNITY CHARACTER WITHIN THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. WHAT IS IMPLIED HERE, IS OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS TO REMAIN MOSTLY WHITE, EDUCATED AND AFFLUENT. THIS IS INHERENT RACISM. ANY SUCH LANGUAGE IN THIS ORNANC WITHEGARD TOAYBE MAINTAINING COMMUNITY CHARACTER SHOULD BE REMOVED. IT SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ALL ANN ARBOR CITY ORDINANCES. FIRST, A QUESTION. EXCUSE ME. WHY IS THE ORDINANCE BEING ADDED TO THE PURCHASING AND CONTRACTING SELLING PORTION OF THE CITY CODE? I HOPE IN YOUR DELIBERATION YOU ADDRES THIS QUESTN. THE ALL TO MEMBERS AND CITY STAFF HAVE CHOSEN TO LUMP SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THE KEY TERM IS RENTAL. A TERM THAT COUNCILMEMBER AND STAFF USE ON A REGULAR BASIS. ALL SHORT-TERM RENTALS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE CHARACTERIZED AND LICENSED AS RTALS BECAU THEY AR RENTAL PROPERTIES. THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN RENTAL PROPERTIES IRREGARDLESS OF THE LENGTH OF STAY BY TENANTS. THE CITY IS ENFORCING THE ZONING. WHY IS THERE A NEW FOR A NEW ORDINANCE? COUNCIL AND STAFF HAVE NOT STATEA T VIEW THE SITTION AS IT IS. ALL THIS HAS RESULTED IN INCONSISTENT AND POTENTIALLY DISCRIMINATORY, WHERE IT'S BASED SOLELY ON THEIR STREET ADDRESS. THIS -- THE JUST AND FAIR ACTION TO TAKE NOW IS TO REJECT THIS ORDINANCE. SEND IT BACK TO STAFF AND CREATE AEGAL NON-CFORMING USE STATUS FOR THE OWNERS IN THE ORDINANCE.
00:34:39.044: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:34:40.446: >> OKAY. I HAVE TWO ASKS TONIGHT FROM CITY COUNCIL. FIRST, MAKE A MOTION TO REJECT THIS ORDINANCE AS WRITTEN, AND SEND IT BACK TO STAFF BEFORE THIS FIRST READING. NOT ALL CONSTITUENTS' VOICES HAVE BEEN HEARD ON THIS. SECONDIOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PLEA TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, DO THE RIGHT THING. BE COURAGEOUS. DO A COURAGEOUS THING AND MAKE A MOTION TO FORM A WORKING GROUP WITH PARENTANTS FROM ALL PERSPECTIVE -- PARTICIPANTS FROM ALL PERSPECK ENVIRONMENTS TO WORK THROUGH THESE COMPLEX ISSUES BEFORE THE FIRST READING OCCURS. EVERYONE ON THIS COUNCIL HAS SHOWN EIR -- [ NO AUDIO ]
00:35:21.253: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CAROL SECALLA.
00:35:35.267: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T
00:35:36.135: >> Mayor Taylor: IFOU ARE. THERE, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE TO RAISE YOUR HAND, PLEASE. CAROL SCULLA. MOVING ON, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAN ECZECH YELLE. -- DAN EZEKIEL.
00:36:18.710: >> I'M DAN EZEKIEL, 524IFTH STREET. THANKS FOR LETTING ME ADDRESS YOU AND THANKS FOR ALL YOU DO FOR OUR COMMUNITY. IT NEEDS TO BE SAID EVERY TIME, WE SOMETIMES DISAGREE ON SUBSTANCE BUT WE ARE AWARE THAT YOU ARE ALL GUIDED BY YOUR BEST UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS IN OUR COMMUNITY'S INTEREST AND YOU DO YOUR BEST TO IMPLEMENT THAT. THE HOURAN VALLEY GROUP'S STANCE ON SOLID WAS ISSUES IS GUIDED BY THE REDUCING, REUSING AND RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT WE SEND TO THE LANDFILLS. SOMETIMESI HAVE COME TO YOU TO TAKE ISSUE WITH VARIOUS POLICIES YOU WERE CONSIDERING BUT TONIGHT IS DIFFERENT. I'M HERE TO CELEBRATE THE AION THAT Y WILL HOPEFULLY BE TAKING HERE TONIGHT WHEN YOU APPROVED PAY PLAN TO REPAIR OUR MRPH AND CONTRACT WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO OPERATE IT. I WANT TO TELL YOU FOUR GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE. NUMBER ONE THE CITY WILL SAVE A TON OF MONEY. $550,000 PER YEAR OVER THE CURRENT CONTRACT TO PROCESS RECYCLABLES. IT ALSLESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE PROPOSAL FROM  ANTERRA, THAT COUNCIL REJECTED IN DECEMBER, THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED TO OUR RECYCLABLELY TRANSSUPPORTED TO A MRPH. NUMBER TWO, THIS FACILITY WILL MAKE A HUGE POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR REGI'S CARN EMISSIONS SINCE OUR MRPH WAS CLOSED AS A SORTING FACILITY. SEVERAL TOWNS HAVE CUT BACK OR ELIMINATED THEIR PROGRAMS. OUR RESTARTED MRPH WILL ATTRACT CITIES THROUGHOUT THE RION AND HELP THEM RESTART THEIR STALLED PROGRAMS WITH THE ALL THE CBON EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT COME WITH THAT. THAT WILL PROBABLY BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CARBON REDUCING INITIATIVES YOU MAKE THIS YEAR. NUMBER THIS, THIS FACILITY WILL CREATE AS MANY AS 20 NEW GOOD-PAYING UNION JOBS. THAT'S HOW THE COMMUNITY BELIEVES WORKERS SHOULD BE TREATED. FOUR, FINAL Le, IT'S GREAT FOR THE CITY TO PARTNER WITH THE LONG-TERM NONPROFIT MISSION-DRIVEN RECYCLING ORGANIZATION RECYCLE ANN ARBOR ON THIS PROJECT. MUCH LIKE HOW THE CITY PROFIT, TO RESTORE THE CITY-OWNED MICHIGAN THEATER DECADES AGO. THIS IS REALLY AN EVENING TO CELEBRATE, ONE OF THE BETTER ONES IN THE 40 PLUS YEARS OF RECYCLING IN ANN ARBOR.
00:38:53.465: >> PLEE PROVE CA-9 ANDECONDS. THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU.
00:39:08.980: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. SCALLA ARE YOU THERE?
00:39:10.182: >> Councilmember Griswold: SHE SENT ME AN EMAIL THAT SHE PRESSED STAR NINE.
00:39:15.087: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THERE'S A CALLER, BUTT'S NOT THE MBER WE HAVE LISTED FOR HER. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TRY THAT CALLER?
00:39:21.460: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, PLEASE. Crk Beaudry: HI, CALLER 815 IS THIS CAROL SCALEA.?
00:39:28.300: >> YES AND YES. YES, I AM.
00:39:30.268: >> Mayor Taylor: VERY GOOD.
00:39:31.470: >> THANK YOU.
00:39:32.237: >> SORRY ABOUT THAT. I HAD TO SWITCH PHONES.
00:39:36.174: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
00:39:37.542: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME ISAROL SCALA, AND I'M A HOMEOWNER IN THE 4ARD. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT REGARDING THE PROPOSED SHORT-TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE AND I WOULD ASK COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATION. TWO FRIENDS BUY HOMES AT THE SAME TIME TWO YEARS AGO LOOKING TO EVENTUALLY RENT THEM SHORT-TERM. ONE HOME IS IN A RESIDENTIAL AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, THERE WOULD BE NO CONSIDERATION BY EITHER AS TO THE LOCATION OF THE HOMES BECAUSE THERE ARE WAS NO RESTRRESTRICTING TO RENTING IT S LEGAL. BOTH DID DUE DILIGENCE AND BOTH INVESTED HEAVILY IN RENOVATIONS. AFTER TWO YEARS ONE OWNER IS TOLD, YOU CAN'T SHORT-TERM RENT ANYMORE, BECAUSE YOU HAVEHE UNFORTUNATE LUCK WITHOUT ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF BUYING IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA. THE OTHER OWNER GOES ON HIS WAY, CONTINUES TO RENT HIS HOME AND HOLDS HIS INVESTMENT. WHY? BECAUSE HE HAS THE GOOD FORTUNE AND LUCK TO HAVE BOUGHT IN A MIXED SCOPE WITHOUT ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WOULD BE A WIN FOR HIM. NEITHER BUYER HAD THE BENEFIT OF A POLICY, A RULE, OR AN ORDINANCE THAT WOULD HAVE LED THEM TO BUY IN A PROTECTED ZONE, AND ENSURED THEIR RENTAL CONTINUANCE. THIS IS DISCRIMINATORY. IT'S PREFERENTIAL AND IT SMACKS OF FAVORITISM AND BAD GOVERNANCE. THANK YOU.
00:41:00.392: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROMOUIL? MS. BEAUDRY, CAN YOU ENABLE ME TO LOWER HANDS, SEE HANDS AND LOWER HANDS. THANK YOU. MS.  -- COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD, I BELIEVE.
00:41:24.649: >> Councilmember Griswold: GOOD EVENING. IAVE STATE MANY, MANY, TIMES MY CONCERNS AND FRUSTRATION WITH DANGEROUS CROSSWALKS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. BRADLEY PARSONS RAISED THE ISSUE WITH THE MDOT-CONTROLLED CROSSWALK ON HURON NEAR THAYER WHICHAS THE SITE OF A VERY SERIOUS PEDESTRIAN CRASH LAST JANUARY. AT THIS POINT, A JURY TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR AUGUST. I HAVE ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE. I HAVE TALKED TO THE MAYOR. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DON'T HAVE A MOBILITY COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT, BUT IT'S REALLY TRUST A FOALITY AS I'M CONTINUING TO WORK TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. I HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH STAFF, AND WITH OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR TOM CRAWFORD BECAUSE STAFF HAS GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE MDOT IS SAYING, THE IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN 2021. THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. TODAY, I WROTE A LETTER TO PAUL AJEGBA AND CCED A NUMBER OF ELECTED OFFICIALS AND STAFF IN LAND SENG. WWE CAN -- LANSING. WE CANNOT ACCEPT THAT THIS DANGEROUS CROSSWALK WILL REMAIN FOR ANOTHER YEAR. WE MUST APPLY ALL THE POLITICAL PRESSURE THAT WE CAN. I'M ALSO VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IN 2019 BY 25%, AND INSTEAD OF A RESPONSE OF LET'S GET TO GO AND FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. INSTEAD PEOPLE ARGUED WITH ME ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS REALLY AN INCREASE IN THE PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATE. I WOULD AO LIKE TO MTION THAT THE "NEW YORK TIMES" HAD A BOOK REVIEW WHY INTELLECTUALS SUPPORT DICTATORS, I THINK THERE'S A LESSON HERE FOR ANN ARBOR AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE READ THIS. I POSTED IT OUT ON MY FACEBOOK. SUBTITLE IS THE SEDUCTIVE LURE OF AUTHORITARIANISM. I AM CONCERNED THAT WE ARE SIMPLY ACTING LIKE LEMMINGS AND NOT DELIBERATING. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, I WANT TO COMMEND HER FOR HER ABILITY TO WORK WITH EVERYONE AND ADVOCATE FOR HER CONSTITUENTS, THIS TO BE A NEGATIVE TRAIT, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS WHAT DEBBIE DINGLE, OUR CONGRESSWOMAN IS MOST PROUD OF IS, AGAIN DISAPPOINTING TO ME. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND OUR CONSTITUENTS DESERVE IT. THANK YOU.
00:44:32.537: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. MY APOLOGIES.
00:44:34.806: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST WANTED TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT STARTED TODAY IN WARD 4, SOUTH MANN ASPHALT.
00:44:47.352: >> Mayor Taylor: I CAN'T HEAR YOU. CAN ANYBODY ELSE HEAR YOU? ALL RIGHT, I'M CONTINUING TO HAVE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. PLEASE PROCEED. MY APOLOGIES.
00:44:54.192: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, OKAY. YEAH, PROJECTS IN WARD 4 STARTED TODAY. SOUTH MAIN STREET ASPHALT PASS AND BOARDWALK DRIVE. AND THERE'S ANOTHER CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING THAT WILL START JY 27th. WATER MAIN CONSTRUCTION ALONG SOUTH BOULEVARD, RESIDENTS SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A NOTICE ABOUT THIS. I POSTED ABOUT IT IN MY NEWSLETTER AND THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE LOCALLY, WE ARE WATCHING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN PORTLAND AND I -- I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I A - WIL AND GETH TO MAKE SURE THAT EVENTS LIKE THAT WOULD N HAPPEN HERE. I -- I KNOW THAT WE PROBABLY ALL SEE THE SAME WAY ON THAT. I HAVE HEARD MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY EXPRESSING ALARM AND FEARS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF CONTROL WE HAVE LOCALLY WHEN THINGS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ARE NOT GOING EAYE WOULD WAN SO WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION. THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO SHARE. THANKS.
00:46:00.358: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:46:01.860: >> Councilmember Grand: A FEW THINGS. CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME OKAY? I KNOW I HAVE BEEN HEARING SOME ECHOES. ONE, STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCIL SEPTEMBER AN EMAIL TO EVERYONE TODAY ABOUT DC-6 IN SUPPORT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I READ IN THAT WAS AN OBSERVATION BY JESSE SCHWAB AND IT REMINDED ME SHE WAS SELECT AS ONE OF THE FIVE WASHTENAW COUNTY, YOUNG CITIZENS OF THE YEAR. SHE'S A MEMBER OF SAC AND SO CONGRATULATIONS TO JESSE. WE HAVE A LOT OF TREMENDOUS YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY. NUMBER TWO, THIS ASK AEADS UP. AT THE AUGUST 6th MEETING, I WILL BE BRINGING FORWARD BALLOT LANGUAGE THAT I HOPE YOU WILL ALL SUPPORT TO -- TO BRING FORWARD RANK CHOICE VOTING WHEN THAT IS AVAILABLE THROUGH STATE LAW. I'M AWARE THAT IT'S OPPORTUCURRENTLYNOT AVAILABLE TW BUT THE LANGUAGE WILL BE SET UP SO THAT IF THE STATE DOES MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES, THEN WE WILL BE CUED UP TO BE ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT CAN HOLD OUR MAYORAL AND COUNCIL ELECTIONS BOTH PRIMARIES AND THE GENERAL USING THE RANK CHOICE VOTING. I BELIEVE IT HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY. IT INCREASES PARTICIPATION, AND IT'S MORE DEMOCRATIC. SO I'M -- YOU KNOW, I WELCOME -- I KNOW THE MAYOR PLANS TO COSPONSOR IT WITH ME BUT I WELCOME OTHER COSPONSORS AN I EXPECT TO HAVE INITIAL LANGUAGE AT THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AT THE END OF THE WEEK AND I HOPE IT GETS OUT A GOOD TWO WEEKS BEFE THE MEETING. I DO UNDERSTANDHERE MAY BE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT TIMING BUT I WANTED TO GIVE OUR ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE MILLAGES THAT ARE ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING, AND THOUGHT THAT HONESTLY IT WAS BETTER TO PUT THAT ONE OFF AFTER THE PRIMARY ELECTION TO TAKE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT POLITICS OUT OF IT. SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THAT. D I JUST WANTED TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. THANK TO MATT THOMAS FROM THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR HELPING ME SO FAR AND THE MANY ADVOCATES IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT I SEE HAPPENING. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAV BEEN REALLY UPSETTI ME IN OUR COMMUNITY OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS ESPECIALLY -- AND I -- I DIDN'T WANT TO MENTION IT BUT I KEEP FEELING ANGRY AND THEN HORRIFIED, AND NAUSEOUS AND THEN ANGRY AGAIN. BECAUSE THERE WERE A COUPLEF THINGS. COLLABORATION. THAT WAS USED AS AN EXCUSE IN MY MIND TO -- BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER ON HER CAM PEN LITERATURE TO MISLEAD VOTERS. SHE TOOK A QUOTE FROM A FORMER PLANNING COMMISSION, WHO IS NO LONGER ON THE PLANNING COISSION, SCOTT TRUDEAUND THOUGHT SHE WAS SUPPORTING HIS CAMPAIGN WHEN THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. WHILE IT MAY NOT BE ILLEGAL, AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT TO SHOW COLLABORATION, KICKING SOMEONE OFF THE LAPPINGG COMMISSION DOESN'T SHOW COABORATION. THAT'S JUST NOT T CASE. I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER WOULD APOLOGIZE TO BOTH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND FORMER PLANNING COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU FOR THOSE ACTIONS AND I WAS WAITING TO SPEAK TO SEE IF IT WOULD HAPPEN AND I DIDN'T HEAR IT. I FELT LIKE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SAY SOMETHINGECAUSE I WAS REALLY DISTURBED. EVEN IF IT'S NOT ILLEGAL, WE KNOW THAT --
00:50:00.965: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT.
00:50:06.738: >> Councilmember Grand: WE SHOULDN'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CAMCOMMENTS AND PUT IT ON THEIR CAMPAIGN. THERE'S ONE LINE THAT HAS NOT BEEN CROSSED AND THAT'S GOING AFTER YOUR CHILDREN. YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE SAFE FROM COMMENT. AND TODAY, AND REALLY YESTERDAY, THAT LINE WAS CROSSED, WN -- WHEN JEN AYERS DAUGHTER WAS CALLED OUT. AND FRANKLY SEXUALIZED IN A WAY THAT WAS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE, JUST FOR MS. AYERS HAVING A PICTURE OF HER FAMILY ON HER WEBSITE. SHE WAS ACCUSED OF USINGER DAUGHTER IN A WAY THAT SICKENED ME AS A PARENT AND AS A PERSON, AND THAT MESSAGE WAS CALLED TO BE TAKEN DOWN, AND IT WASN'T. AS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT WHO TO VOTE FOR, AND VOTE FOR, PASE D'T LOOK AT THE ANN ARBOR POLITICS SITE --
00:51:21.446: >> Councilmember Hayner: SERIOUSLY, HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO GO ON?
00:51:25.249: >> Councilmember Grand: AND I CALL ON MY COUNCILMEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE ON THAT SITE --
00:51:30.822: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S BEEN LONGER THAN TWO MINUTES, IF YOU CAN WRAP UP.

00:52:02.286: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AGAIN.
00:52:03.221: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE ARE ELECTED TO TAKE ON THE BUSINESS OF THE CITY. AND MRS.  -- COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, PLEASE KEEP THIS BS OUT OF OUR MEETINGS. OUR MEETINGS GO ON LONG ENOUGH. AND IF WE CAN JUST TAKE CARE OF WHAT WE'RE ELEED TO TA CE ND KEE THIS CASHAGE OUT OF OUR MEETINGS, I APPRECIATE IT. DON'T BRING THE GARBAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA INTO OUR MEETING HERE. KEEP IT WHERE IT BELONGS IN THE SEWER THAT IT FINDS ITSELF. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN OUR MAYOR. WE HAVE DESERVE A BETTER LEADER AND WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE. ALL EVER THIS WAS STARTED YEARS AGO AND IT CONTINUES TO PERPETUATE AND WE HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO AND WE HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO TAKE CARE OF THESE THINGS. I WASN'T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING BUT I'M NOT GOING TO HEAR THIS AT THE STARTF THE MEETING. LET'S GET TO BUSINESS. KEEP HAD A JUNK OUT OF HERE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY NEEDS TO HEAR IT, WANTS TO HEAR IT OR IT HELPS TO TAKE CARE OF ANYTHING THAT WE GOT ELECTED TO TAKE CARE OF. LET THE VOTERS DECIDE IN TWO WEEKS WHO THEY WANT TO SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, MS. GRAND. ENOUGH IS EUGH. WILL.
00:53:32.777: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL PASS. I THINK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID. I'M EQUALLY -- EVERYONE BUT THE MAYOR HAS HAD THE DECENCY TO LAY LOW IN THIS ELECTION AND NOT GO OUT THERE AND GO CRAZY ENDORNG PEOPLE BUT YOU KW, TO -- IT'S OFFENSIVE, MS. GRAND. IT REALLY IS. WE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT. [ ECHO ]
00:54:01.973: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:54:02.873: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THINK THIS ESCALATED VERY CLICKLY. I THINK THIS WAS A COMMENT MADE AND A RETORT MADE AND THAT'S IHINK THAT'S REASONABLE, AND WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE ENDORSING PEOPLE, WE ARE ALLOWED TO AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOUR NAME IS APPEARS ON OTHER PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN LITERATURE AND THAT'S FINE. I WILL LEAVE IT TRE. D I THINK THERE'S A BOOGIEMAN OF THE MAYOR BEING A BETTER LEADER. WE ARE ACTUALLY 11 OF US ELECTED LEADERS AND EACH OF US OWNS OUR OWN WORDS AND OUR OWN ACTIONS. WE DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR THE SUPPOSED LEADERSHIP OF THE MAYOR, BUT I THINK HE DOES A FINE JOB. EACH OF US IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR OWN WORDS AND BEHAVIOR AND PASSING THE PUCK BUCK UP TO THE MAYOR IS, I THINK, YOU KW COWARDLY AND A REJECTION OF YOUR OWN DUTIES AND IT'S DR. GRAND AND SHE HAS A Ph.D. IN PUBLIC HEALTH FROM UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.

CA-9, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A SERVICES AGREEMENT AND LAND AND BUILDING LEASE WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR, FOR MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITYRANSLOADG, REEQUIPPING A RECYCLABLES PROCESSING. MOVED AND SECONDED.
00:57:53.737: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WANTED TO TAKE THIS TIME TO PUT SOME LIGHT ON THIS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE COUNCIL MAJORITY HAS HAD A HAND IN IN SAVING OUR MRF. ONE THAT WAS TOLD TO US COULD NO LONGER BE REVIVED AND BECOM A LOCAL ASSET AND BE A PART OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY DECIDED TO TA DIFFERENT ROUTE A LO AND BEHOLD, HERE WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO DO WHAT WAS TOLD WOULD BE TOO COSTLYR IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE STAFF THAT WENT BACK AND WORKED ON THIS WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND AT LEADERSHIP AT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO WORK OUT AN AGREEMENT TT IS MUTUALLY DESIRABLE. AND THE BENEFITS WILL COME AND WE WILL SAVE 20 UNION JOBS. WE WILL SAVE ON THE CARBON EMISSIONS BY SORTING AND TRANSPORTING THAT HERE LOCALLY AND NOT T SENDS IT DOWN TO CINCINNATI. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN OURSVES ESSENTLLY. WE AREOING TO RE-INVEST IN RSELVES AND BECOME A REGIONAL LEADER ONCE AGAIN IN RECYCLING AND REDUCING OUR WASTE AND LIGHTENING UP OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE MAYOR AND OTHERS WON'T PUT OUT AS A SUCCESS OF THIS COUNCIL, BUT ONE THAT I WILL LEAVE JUAN DAY FROM CNCIL BEING -- LVE E DAY FROM COUNCIL BEING PROUD OF. WHEN I JOINED COUNCIL, I WAS TOLD IT WAS A LIABLE AND NOW WELLBORNED THAT LIABILITY INTO AN ASSET. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT HAPPEN.
00:59:53.390: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:59:54.992: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I AM ALSO GLAD THIS WAS PULLED OUT, BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT EVENT AND DECISN FOR ANN ARBOR AND CERTAINLY WORTH MENTIONING AND SPEAKING TO. IT'S A TEN-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO REOPEN THE MATERIALS FACILITY AND PROCESS THE CITY'S RECYCLABLES. THE HISTORY HERE, AGAIN, IT' IMPORTANT AND THE MRF WAS CLOSED IN 2016 BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY CONCERNS AND BECAUSE OF THAT TIME, RECYCLE ANN ARBOR HAS BEEN USING IT FOR TRANSLOADING ONLY AND THEN IN DECEMBER, COUNCIL DIRECTED RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO NEGOTIATE A TEN-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO REOPEN THE MRF AND PROCESS OUR RECYCLES AGAIN. THERE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THAT COULD B DONE SAFELY AND THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RISKS AND I SHARED THOSE CONCERNS. YOU ASKED SEVERAL QUESTIONS WE T WE ARE VOTING ON TONIGHT. STAFF'S RESPONSES WERE THAT THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT REOPENING SAFELY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND THE CITY DOES NOT BEAR THE RISK AND THE LIABILITY. GIVEN THAT, I'M NOW COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THIS AGREEMENT. THE AGREEMENT IS REASONABLE. RECYCLE ANN ARBOR PAYS THE UP FRONT COST, O HAVING THE RECYCLABLE EQUMENT AND RECYCLE ANN ARBOR RECOVERS THAT COST OVER THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD. THE CITY IS GUARANTEED THE BEST PERIOD OF ANY USERS OF THE FACILITY AND WILL RECEIVE A HOST FEE OF $13.50 FOR EVERY TON OF RECYCLABLES. THE CITY ALSO SHARES IN THE REVENUE FROM T RECYCBLE MATERIAL, D A RPONSE TO OTHER ONE OF MY QUESTIONS, STAFF PROJECTS THAT COULD BE ABOUT $400,000 ANNUALLY, ALTHOUGH WE KNOW RECYCLING MARKETS ARE QUITE VOLATILE. I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO CALL THIS ITEM OUT TONIGHT, AS DID COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. IT IS AN IMPORNT DECISION AND MILE POST FOR ANN ARBOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR NEGOTIATING AN AGREEMENT THAT THEY BELIEVE ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS RAISED IN DECEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:02:27.177: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:02:28.378: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS. I HAD A NE LONG CONVERSION WITH A GENTLEMANHO HAS AHE LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN COLLECTION OF WASTE AND RECYCLING. AND I KNOW THE SCALE PROJECT IS WELL UNDERWAY AT MRF. HE EXPRESSED MANY CONCERNS THAT WHEN THIS IS UP AND ACTIVE AND IT BECOMESOTENAL TO BE PART OF THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN AND HAVE OTHER FOLKS FROM EASTERN WASHTENAW COUNTY USE OUR FACILITY WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF OUR HOPES, HE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS THAT THAT SCALE IS TOO CLOSE TO THE GATE AND THESE TRUCKS WILL START QUEUING  O ON THE ROADND HE SAW IT AT OTHER IF A SATELLITITIES -- FACILITIES WHEN HE DROVE FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT. I WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. IN ANTICIPATION OF BRINGING THIS BUILDING UP TO SPEED AGAIN AND GIVING TRAFFIC FROM OUTSIDE OF THE CITY THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNED THAT THE FOLKS ON THAT AFF HE ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE DRIVEWAYS AND THERE WAS A REQUEST THAT WE LOOK INTO CREATING AN ADDITIONAL SIDING OR OFF LANE OUTSIDE OF THE GATES WHERE THE TRUCKS CAN QUEUE UP, BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I KNOW IT'S GNGOWN T SCA ERE, BUT I WANTED TO PASS THAT ON. IT WAS A RESIDENT AND A KNOWLEDGEABLE RESIDENT'S CONCERN THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH EVERYBODY. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL GET THIS UP AND RUNNING AGAIN AND I THINK THAT IT'S A VERY VALUABLE ASSET THAT WE HAVE HERE AND I THINK RA IS GETNG A GOODEAL ON THI AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE SOME RECYCLING BEING DONE AGAIN. OUR NEXT BIG THINK TO TACKLE IS THE ISSUE WITH COMPOST. I WOULD LIKE TO GET INTO THE COMPOST, BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT PLAY INTO THE A2ZERO PLAN BUT ACTIVELY REDING THE COMPEOP INHE SOLID WASTE WIL-- MPOST INHE SOLID WASTE WILL DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE SOLID WASTE. THANK YOU.
01:04:52.856: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:04:53.824: >> Councilmember Smith: YES, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A SPECIAL THANKS TO MS. MACHIESKI AND HER STAFF AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND NO UNPROFIT MISSION DRIVEN PARTNER MEND FENCES AND PUT TOGETHER AN AGREEMENT THAT IS, I BELIEVE, A WIN/WIN FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S NOT JUST A GOOD DEAL FOR RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. IT'S AI GOOD A GOOD DEAL FOR THY AND THE RESIDENTS. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE SINCE THE MRF CLOSED SEINCE 2016,NOW TT PEOPLE EXPECT ANN ARBOR TO PROVIDE THIS. METHYLED WE ARE ABLE TO DO THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO MERELY ECHO WHAT MR. EZEKIEL SAID THIS EVENING. WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THIS. MOVING FORWARD THIS IS A BIG DEAL. A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, THE WORKING GROUP ON SOLID WTE, HAVE P CNTLESS HOURS INTO THIS STAFF HAS PUT COUNTLESS HOURS INTO THIS AND I'M THRILLED FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS. THANK YOU.
01:06:08.966: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:06:11.501: >> Councilmember Bannister: AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSIONER, ALONG WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, I ALSO WANT TO ECHO THE EXCITEMENT AND THE CELEBRATION THAT WE HAVE REACHED THIS AGREEMENT, AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT IT'S ANTICIPATED AS M EZEKI SAID, 250,000 TO $550,000 SAVED A YEAR BY RESTARTING OUR MRF. AND WE CAN -- WE'LL HAVE A HUGE EFFECT ON OUR CARBON EMISSIONS, TNOT ONLY FOR ANN ARBOR BUT WASHNAW COUNTY A WESTERN AND EASTERN DETROIT AREAS THAT CAN BRING THEIR RECYCLABLE MATERIALS TO OUR RENOVATED MATERIALS, RECYCLE FACILITY AND THE POTENTIAL TO NEW GOOD UNION JOBS AND THEN JUST -- IT'S VERY EXCITING WHAT SORT OF -- HOW THIS IS IN KEEPING WH OUR CORE VALUES OF REDUCING, RESEUSSING, RECYCLING, AND SO THIS TRULY IS A GREAT DAY TO CELEBRATE AND THIS MAYBE ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ENVIRONMENTAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS YEAR AND OF MANY OF OUR TERMS ON COUNCIL. RECYCLE A ARBOR A EVERYONEND TO WHO WORK ON THI OVER THE YEARS.
01:07:45.762: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:07:47.330: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR DOING THE HARD WORK OF NEGOTIATING THIS CONTRACT AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED AN I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH RECYCLE ANN ARR. BELIEVE THAT'S IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO CONTRACT WITH THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN OUR MISSIONING, WHICH IS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT GOES INTO LANDFILLS AND I'M ALSO HAPPY TO HAVE LEARNED THAT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR WAS THE LOW BIDDER ON OUR RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING PICKUP BID THAT RECENTLY WENT O SO I THINK WE WILL CTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR LONG-TIME PARTNER AND I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT. THANK YOU.
01:08:33.343: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:08:36.346: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL SOUND LIKE A PARROT ON A LOT OF IT. AS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ARTICULATED RECYCLING MARKETS ARE INEDIBLY VOLATIL AND THEY SAW A CHANGE IN OUR MARKET AND POTENTIAL NEW PARTNERS THAT WILL MAKE OUR LOCAL RECYCLING PROFITABLE, AND TOOK -- AND CAPITALIZED ON THAT AND BROUGHT IT TO OUR ATTENTION AND CREATED WHAT I TRUST WILL BE A SUSTNABLE BOTH EIRONMENTALLYARD, BU ALS FINANCIALLY. AND THEN A HUGE THANKS TO STAFF FOR THEIR OPEN MINDEDNESS AND THEIR INNOVATION BUT ALSO THEIR STEWARDSHIP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US DOESN'T ASSUME RISK ON THE TAXPAYER AND THE RESIDENT BUD, T INSTEAD PLACES MORE ON THE PARTNER. SO THANKS ALL AROUND TO THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE NONPROFIT PARTNER, RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. I'M EXCITED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND HOPES IT PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
01:09:46.750: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:09:47.784: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I AT HAV ALRDY BEEN STATEDOU AND JUST POINT OUT THAT JUST LIKE A2ZERO, THIS REPRESENTS A RESULCULTURE OF WORKING TOWARDS. WE HAVE A SOLUTION THAT REFLECTS THE VALUES OF OUR COMMUNITY. I BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL. IT'S NOT EASY TO DO ANDOPE TH WE CAN DUPCATE THI EFFORT IN MANY OTHER AREAS. SO, AGAIN, THANK YOU.
01:10:24.421: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I GRESS IN PERHAPS CLOSING, I'M INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT AND I KNOW THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES TTAVE GALVANIZEDHE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY MORE SO THAN THE PROSPECT OF REOPENING THE MRF AND REVITALIZING THE RECYCLING PROGRAM, THE LOCAL RECYCLING PROGRAM HERE. AND I'M JUST DELIGHTED THAT STAFF HASORKELOSELY WITH OUR LAL PARTNER AND OUR LOCAL EXPERTS AND RESEARCH LOOK FORWARD TO A RECYCLING PROGRAM THAT IS REVITALIZED, LOCALIZED AND POISED TO SUCCEED. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? POSED?S OF AYES] IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO A SET OF PUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUCK LICK TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL -- THAT IS TO SAY THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. TO SPEAK AT A PUBLIC HEARING, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. TO SPEAK AT ONE OF THE THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS TODAY, CL 877-853-5247. THAT IS 877-853-5247. ENTER THE MEETING ID, 263208392, (982)632-8392. AT THE TIME OF THE PUBLIC HEARING, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE AND YOU WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF WHY YOU ARE TELEPHONE NUMBER. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK AND PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CLERK WHEN YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS AND ASK YOU TO WRAP UP YOUR REMARKS A THE THREE-MUTE POINT. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE), ZONING OF 4.5 ACRES FROM PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT) TO C3 MMG PLYMOUTH ROAD MIXED USE REZONING 3611-3621 PLYMOUTH ROAD. IS THERE ANYON WHOOULD LIK TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:12:59.008: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER ENDING IN 693.
01:13:00.877: >> MY NAME IS WENDY CARMAN. I LIVE AT 2030 GEORGETOWN AND I WALK TO THIS SITE SERAL TIM AEEK. ACCESS PROBLEMS.IFFICULT THESE ISSUES WERE ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ORIGINAL PUD IN 1978. THE PUD ALLOWED THE CITY TO CONTROL THE USES TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF VEHICULAR TRIPS LOW. THE DEVELOPERS WISH TO REZONE THE PROPERTY TO C3, WHICH HAS THE FOUR-STORY HEIGHT LIMIT BUT T ANNED PROJE APPROVAL TO ALW ONE BUILDING TO HA SIX STORIES AND GET SPECIAL EXCEPTION APPROVAL FOR A RESTAURANT DRIVE UP WINDOW WHICH IS ALSO NOT ALLOWED IN C3. THEY COULD HAVE HAD WITH SOME CHANGES  THE SIT PLAN AND WHY WOULTHEY D THAT? BECAUSE A CHANGE FROM YOU HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO AGREE TO THEIR REQUEST, HOWEVER, IF YOU CHANGE THE ZONING TO C3, THE OWNERS HAVE AI WILL BLANK CHECK TO PURSUE ALTERNATE C3 DESNS WIOUT BEING REZONED. C3 ALLOWS MORE INTENSE USES THEN JUST A RESTAURANT AND A MOTEL OR HOTEL YES, THEY HAVE SWEETENED THE POT BY OFFERING NOT TO BUILD A GAS STATION TO USE SOLAR PANELS AND TO PUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. THESE ARE INCENTIVES TO OBTAIN E C3 ZONING BUT THEY DON'T ADESS THE PROBLEMS THESIS. THE UDC SAYS THE C3 ZONING DISTRICT IS TO CREATE USES THAT REQUIRE GOOD VEHICLE ACCESS. GOOD AUTOMOBILE ACCESS IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL TO THE C3 DISTRICTS AND YET THE SITE DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE SITE PHOTOS YOU WILL SEE HOW CLOSE THE DRIVE OF THE SIT OPE TO PLYMOUTH ROAD IS TO THE SOUTHBOUND ENTRANCE RAMP OF 23. A CAR OR TRUCK MUST CROSS FIVE LANES OF TRAFFIC AND GET INTO THE SIXTH LANE INTO I IN ORDER O SO. A REAL PROBLEM AT PEAK HOURS WHEN THE LANES ARE FULLY STAFFED. BECAUSE THE DRIVEWAY OF OFF OF GREEN ROAD IS NARROW AND HAS TO BE USED BY TRUCKS TONLOAD. THE ADDITIO OF MORE TRUCKS WILL KE THE TRUCK PARKING PROBLEM BIGGER AND ADD TO MONTH ARE CONFUSION ON THE SITE.

AND I COMMEND YOU ON HAVING AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. I SEE A GREAT NEED IN THAT. IN TIMES OF COVID, WE TRIED TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH AMOUNT THAT WE CAN CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE OUR PROJECT IS NOW OUTSIOWN, OBVIOUSLY, JUST IN TERMS OF SHEER NUMBERS AND THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. I WANT TO SAY WE DID GIVE AN HONEST EFFORT TO GIVE EVERYTHING WE COULD TO APPEASE THE BOARD AS OPPOSED TO SAYING YOU DO HAVE CONTROL HERE. YOU ARE LIMITING THE USE AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE DEDICATED EFFORTS OF MAYOR TAYLOR AND THE LABORERS IN THE HURON VALLEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE RESPONSLE AREA WITH THE WASHTENAW COUNTY, HAVING A UNANIMOUS CONTRACTING POLICY JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTING POLICIES ARE BECOMING THE NORM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IT WOULD BUILD AS A TRAILBLAZER IN MICHIGAN IF COUNCIL WERE TO ENACT THIS ORDINANCE TONIGHT. I WANT TO SPEAK TO TH TS. IT BUILD ON THE CURRENT STDARDS THATHE CITY HAS IN A NUMBER OF UNIQUE WAYS OF THE FIRSTLY THIS IS DESIGNED TO HAVE ROPROPER STEWARDSHIP OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND THERE'S A BID AWARDING PROCESS, THE CITY CAN BE ASSURED THAT IT'S DONE SAFELY ITSKS RESPECTE CONTRACTOR TO PLEDGE THAT THEY WILL NOT MISCHARACTERIZE THEM AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THIS ENSURES THAT THEY ARE NOT INELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION. AND IT ENSURES THAT CONTRACTORS ARE RELIABLE PARTNERS AND TAKES INTO BEING THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL HISTORY. AND IT WILL ACT IN GOOD FTH AND SHOD BE THE BE MINIM THE CY SHOULD CONSIDER IN AWARDING TAXPAYER FROMS FROM THE CONTRACTS. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE CITY STAFF THAT ARE DETAILED IN THE PUBLIC RESPONSE MEMO, FIRSTLY THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO FEWER BIDDERS. IT DOESN'T LOWER THE NUMBER OF THE CONTRACTORS BUT RATHER THOSE WHO APPLY. AND IT'S MORE LIKELY TO APPLY BECAE OF THIS POLIC SENDLY THATHIS POLICY WILL INCREASE COSTS BY RAISG THE STANDARDS OF CONSTRUCTION AND FACTORING WORKPLACE SAFETY INTO CHRISTMASES, THEY ARE SAVING MONEY OVER THE LONG RUN TO AVOID THE INT NEED TO REPLACE SUB. CONSTRUCTION. I HAVE SEEN THE TEMPLATE MID FORM THAT STAFF HAVE PREPARED HASN'T THIS WOULD NOT BE A SESSIGNIFICAN AITION THE IN THE REVIEW PROCESS.

MOVEDY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. WILL SECONDED BY BANNISTER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF B1. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:24:53.489: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HAVE COMMENTS I WILL SPEAK ONCE TO BOTH THE ZONING AND THE SITE PLAN, BUT FIRST AND AGAIN, I HOPE MR. MARCUS IS AVAILABLE AND I SEE MR. LART. I'MURE THA Y BOTH HEARD THE COMMENTED MADE DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. THE ONE SPECIFIC LeHAS TO DO WITH THE INTERNAL TRAFFIC PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AS A PROBLEM AND I WILL NOT THAT I'M O IN THIS AREA ON A REGULAR BASIS AND IT IS A PROBLEM. ANYONE WHO FREQUENTS THIS STRIP MALL, SEES THE DELIVERY TRUCKS PARKED IN THE ACCESS ROAD OFF OF GREEN AND WHAT IT DOES TO THE INTERNAL TRAFFIC FLOW. I'M WONDERING MR. LENART AND I SEE MR. MARCUS IS HERE, AND MAYBE MSDELEO. YOU COU SPEAK T-- BECAUSE THE ISSUE WAS RAISED THAT THE C3 ZONING DOES NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS SITE. YES, THERE WERE THINGS PROVIDED, RESTRICTIONS ON GAS STATION AND MARIJUANA BUSINESS, MONEY FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSI TRU FUND WCH IS WONDEUL AND SOLAR PANELS BUT THE INCENTIVES, AGAIN, DO NOT ADDRESS THIS TRAFFIC, THE INTERNAL TRAFFIC PATTERN PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE SITE, HAS NOW -- NOW AS EXISTS AS PROPOSED DO NOT WORK. WHO WANTS TO SAY THAT? MS. DEO.aylor:S. LEONARD O
01:26:35.324: >>HANK YOU. THANK YOU, COUNCIL. IT IS -- THIS IS A DELICATE SITUATION, IF YOU. THE PROPOSED USE IS A HOTEL. IT'S NOT UNLIKE THE EXISTING USE AND THE RES RESTAURANT IS THE SAME. THERE WAS A PREVIOUS RESTAURANT THERE. SO T - THISARTICULAR DELOPMENT DOES N --  IS TH NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXACERBATING ANY TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AND BYLL ACCOUNTS -- AND PLEASE DO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. THE TRAFFIC ISSUES ARE NOT GENERATED FROM THE -- THE SUBJECT SITE, AND SO IT WILL TAKE A LOT MORE COOPERATION FROM SEVERAL OTHER LANDOWNERS, IF TH FEEL THAT THERE IS AO A TRAFFIC PROBLEM TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN INTERNAL CIRCULATION SYSTEM. THE CITY'S TRAFFIC REGULATIONS APPLY TO THE ENTRANCES TO THE SITE, AND WHAT THE -- WHAT THE EVIDENCE SEEMS TO BE IS THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT THERE ARE CIRCULATION ISSUES WITHIN SITE, BUT IT IS NOT ANSSUE EVER COECTION TO THE PLIC STREETS, IF THAT MAKES SEN. WE HAVE RAISED THE SUBJECT WITH THIS DEVELOPER, BUT HE AND THAT TEAM IS NOT IN A POSITION TO SPEAK FOR THE OTHER PROPERTY OWNERS, AND THEIR LAND USES REGARDING CIRCULATION.
01:28:01.477: >>ouncilmemberumm: THANKS. SO I WILLFFER SOME COMMENTS THEN. THANK YOU. THAT WAS MY QUESTION THANK YOU. MY COMMENTS SPEAK TO BOTH THE ZONING AND THE SITE PLAN. AND I INDICATED PREVIOUSLY AT THE JUNE 15th MEETING THAT I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON THE PLYMOUTH ROAD ZONING. I THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A IMPROVEMENT TO T SITE AND IT'S A SITE THAT, TO BE HONEST, HAS BECOME PRETTY STALE, AND, AGAIN, THE DEVELOPER HAS NOW OFFERED $75,000 TO THE -- IT'S AS A AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION AND A FEW RESTRICTIONS ON FUTURE LAND USES. MY CONCERNS ARE TRAFFIC AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PLANNED PROJECT MOFICATION, AGN TO THE TRAFFIC, AND AS WE KNOW, TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN THIS PLYMOUTH GREEN AREA IS ALREADY A PROBLEM. THE PEAK VOLUME IS -- I ASKED ABOUT THIS, AND THE NUMBERS ARE BIG! THE PEAK VOLUME IS 3,400 VEHICLES AN HOUR. THAT'S, NEEDLESS TO SAY, A L. AND TS DOES ADD TO THE PROBLEM, AND UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES NOT COME WITH ANY MITIGATING ACTIONS, LIKE, FOR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THIS MS. DELEO, AND I WILL NOTE TOO, THAT THE ONE POSSIBLE MITIGATING ACTION THAT STAFF HAS SUGGESTED WAS A QUOTE, RIGHT IN RIGHT OUT DESIGN, BUT THE DEVELOPER DID DECIDE AGAINST THAT. AND A WHEN I SEE LANGUAGE AND RESPONSES THAT THERE'S ENOUGH TRAFFIC VOLUMES TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL CONTROLS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REQUIRE THEM, END QUOTE AND THE ADDITIONAL THAT TELLS ME THAT THERE'S GOING ERMS OF TH PNNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS, THE REQUEST HERE IS FOR SIX STORIES AND 76 FEET COMPARED WITH THE C3 MAXIMUM OF FOUR STORIES AND 50 FEET, AND THAT IS A BIG VARIANCE. THAT'S A 50% VARIANCE. AND WHEN I SEE A MODIFICATION REQUEST OF THAT MAGNITUDE, IT SUGGESTS T ME THATHE UNDERLYING ZONING MAYOT BE APPROPRIATE. AGAIN, AS I SEE IT, I SEE PLUSES AND MINUSES AND I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN HEARING MY COLLEAGUES' THOUGHTS. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
01:30:24.853: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THINK IT WOULD BE PRUDENT FOR US TO INTRODUCE THE PROPOSED STUSUBSTITUTE REZONING ORDINANC. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE BEST OPTION ON THE TABLE. AT THIS TIME, MS. BEAUDRY, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND CIRCULATING THE VERSION THAT MR. LENART SENT ON FRIDAY THE 17th TO COUNCIL, I WILL MAKE A MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE. PLEASE NOTE THAT THAT SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION- EXCUSE ME, ORDINANC WOULD KICK THI BACK TO FIRST READING, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO SCHEDULE A SECOND READING AGAIN, BUT I THINK IT'S -- IT'S A SUPERIOR PROPOSAL THAT DESERVES OUR CONSIDERATION. ONCE THERE IS A SECOND AND WE VOTE ON IT, I WILL MAKE MORE COMMENTS.
01:31:16.638: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERN, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. ZD.>> Councilmember Ackerman: EXCELLENT. THIS HAS A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS THAT THE PETITIONER IS VOLUNTEERING TO PROPOSE ON THE PROPERTY. THE FIRST IS THAT A HANDFUL OF DIFFERENT USES TO BE PROHIBITED ON THE SITE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH I THINK WILL MITIGATE THE FEARS OF ALL THE NEIBORS A TSE TURE USES THAT ARE GOING TO BE PROHIBITED UNDER -- WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE FUELING STATIONS, VEHICLE WASHES, MARIJUANA SECURE TRANSPORTER, MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESS AND MARIJUANA INFUSED PRODUCT PROCESSOR AND WAREHOUSE AND STORAGE. VERY AUT DEPENDENT US WOU BE PROHIBITED IN THE FUTURE. THE SECOND CONDITION IS THAT UPON THE DEVELOPMENT MOVING FORWARD, THE CITY WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE DEVELOPER $75,000 IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTIONS NO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK THESE IMPROVEMENTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVESND WEHOULD ALWAYS CONSID THE BESTPTION ON THE TABLE.
01:32:27.042: >> Mayor Taylor: THIS IS SUBSTITUTION FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? IT'S FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMRAYNER. Councilmemberayner:  I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS QUESTION S. HOW IS IT THAT WE COME UP WITH THESE -- WE HAVE THESE ZONING CLASSIFICATIONS OR REZONING REQUESTS THAT THEN REQUIRE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER EXTREME MODIFICATIONS TO IT, LIKE THIS 50% OVER THE HEIGHT AND SO ON, IS THERE NOT A NING CATEGORY TT WOU FIT WHAT IS BEING PLANNED OUTSIDE OF A PUD RIGHT NOW? IS IT JUST THAT THIS IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR ZONINGS OR WHY IS IT THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR A CHANGE, BUT THE CHANGE -- THEN THEY ARE ASKING FOR MODIFICATIONS ON TOP OF THE CHANGE. IT  SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WE HAVE A LOT. I'M WONDERING WHAT WE HAVE IN R ZING THAT DOESN'T ALLOW ESE TO MOVE FORWARD IN A SOMEWHAT BUY RIGHT MANNER.
01:33:35.644: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M BRETT LENART, I'M THE PLANNING MANAGER. I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON SOME OF THIS FOR STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION TO EVALUATE THE C1A AND C1A/R DISTRICTST YR FOSURE THEITY'S ORDINANCE HAS EVOLVED OUT OF, I WOULD SAY A HISTORY AND LEGACY, WHERE OUR ZONING DISTRICTS WERE ACTUALLY INTENDED TO PROHIBIT MIXED USE. WE HAD A LOT OF -- WE HAVE A LOT OF SINGLE USE DISTRICTS OVER THE HISTORY OF OUR ORDINANCE, AND THIS, -- FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PUD WHEN IT WAS OGINALLY CREATED THIS LOCATION, THE PUBLI BEFIT FOR IT WAS TO ALLOW MIXED USE BECAUSE AT THAT TIME, OUR ZONING DISTRICTS ACTUALLY DIDN'T ALLOW BOTH A HOTEL AND A ENTRANCE WITHIN THE SAME ZONING DISTRICT BECAUSE WE WERE KIND OF SO DISTINCT IN OUR ZONING PATTERNS AND WHICH USES SHOULD GO WHERE. AND SO OVER TIME, WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF STEPS TO, I THI, MODERNIZOUR COD TO AOW MIXED USE, BOTH DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL USES WITHIN OUR DISTRICTS BUT ALSO ACTUALLY BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL IN A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS. BUT I WOULD SAY, IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, AND IN SOME OF THE -- ACTUALLY IN SOME OF THE OTHER AGENDA ITEMS YOU WILL SEE THIS EVENING, PART OF SOME OF THOSEOTH MORENAL COMMERCIAL DTRICTS AND SINGLE PURPOSEISTRICTS FRANKLY HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE SORT OF CONVENTIONS OF INVESTMENT, FINANCING AND DEVELOPMENT THAT WE AND OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE EXPERIENCED. SO THAT'S A LONG WAY OF SAYING THAT I THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY A SIGNAL THAT IT'S TIME FOR US TO ELUATE SEVERAL OF OUR ZONING DISTRICTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT BALANCE IS, VERSUS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SOME OF THE REAL ECONOMICS OF DEVELOPMENT.
01:35:34.162: >> Councilmember Hayner: MR. DELACOURT, I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THIS AND A COUPLE OF OTHER TOPICS HE SAI FOR T FUTURE USE THAT IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE THAT IT MOVE TO A C3 ZONING, BUT THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT -- AND I ASSUME THAT THIS EXISTS IN THIS CASE WHERE THE PROJECT MODIFICATIONS APPLY ONLY TO THIS PROJECT; IS THAT CORRECT? IS IT ALWAYS LIKE TT?
01:36:02.324: >> YES, IT'SERY DEVELOPMENT SPECIFIC. IT HAS TO BE THAT WAY. IT SETS UP SOME TRADEOFFS, IF YOU WILL, COMPONENTS THAT THE CITY MIGHT DETERMINE TO BE BENEFICIAL IN EXCHANGE FOR RELAXING SOME DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TO BEGIN WITH. IN THIS CASE, IF COUNCIL WERE TO PROCEED WITH THIS REZONING THIS TO C3 AND ENTUALLY APPROVE A SITE PROJECT MODIFICATION, THOSE ARE SPECIFIC TO THIS SITE PLAN IN THE C3 ZONING DISTRICT IN THAT SCENARIO. IF DIFFERENT PROJECT CAME UNDER THE C3, IT WOULD STILL HAVE ALL THE POSSIBLE USES AVAILABLE TO IT IN THE DISTRICT, BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITHHE DISTRICT STANDARDS OR MAKE THE SIMILAR WOULDANT A SCIFICA SIMILAR -- WE VELOPMENTROPOSAL FOR PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS.
01:36:54.543: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
01:36:56.278: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:36:57.379: >> Councilmember Lumm: ANOTHER QUESTION TO FOLLOW ON TO MR. HAYNER'S QUESTION. AS WE ALL KNOW, THIS IS WHERE -- WE'RE LOOKING AT A CHANGE IN ZONING FROM P T C3, CONDITIONAL REZONING, C3 REZONING, BUT COULDN'T -- COULDN'T THE SAME TYPES OF CHANGES TO THE PROPERTY HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT CHANGING THE ZONING, BUT BY MAKING A SITE PLAN CHANGE AND CHANGES TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS?
01:37:26.875: >> CHANGES TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS WOUL BE A RONING, WHEREVER THEY ARE MODIFIED THEY HAVE THE SAME EFFECT OF MODIFYING THE ZONING FOR THAT PROPERTY, WHILE THEY MIGHT -- THEY ARE JUST THAT, MAYBE PERHAPS MODIFYING THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, THEY ARE, IN FACT, A REZONING BECAUSE YOU ARE EXCHANGING THE PUD WITH ONE CEL SET OF SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS FOR AEW.
01:37:51.666: >> Councilmber Lumm: SYOU COULDN'T JUST CHANGE THE --
01:37:53.401: >> THROUGH THE PUD. YOU COULD SEEK THAT.
01:37:55.704: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT. SO YOU COULD MAKE THESE CHANGES WITH A PUD.
01:37:58.874: >> SUBJECT TO YOUR ACTION.
01:38:00.709: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT. OKAY. THANKS.
01:38:03.011: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? THIS IS NOW STILL FIRST READING I GUESSLL IN FAVOR ON FIRST READING? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED AT FIRST READING.
01:38:26.868: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:38:30.105: >> Councilmember Eaton: IT'S OF NO CONSEQUENCE. Mayor Tlor: THAT'S OKAY ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:38:45.053: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:38:45.654: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.

01:39:01.202: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.

01:39:32.834: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. MR. LENART, DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE POSTPONE THIS UNTIL WHEREVER THE REZONING COMESACK R I SECOND READING? IS THAT A MON FROM NOW?
01:39:43.244: >> YES, I WOULD BECAUSE THE SITE PLAN WOULD NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNK CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROPOSAL.
01:39:52.387: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST. I PROPOSE TO MOVE THIS TO SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST.
01:39:59.127: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED. ALLSCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? MOVED TO SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST. B-2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:312(20) OF CHAPTER 14 (PURCHASING CONTRACTING AND SELLING PROCEDURE) OF TITLE I OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. DISCUSSION OF B-2. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:40:25.620: >> Councilmember Lumm: I DID NOT SUPPORT THIS AT FIRST READING AND MY POSITION DID NOT CHANGE. I AGREE COMPLETELY CAN CITY STAFF WHO OPPOSED THIS ORDINANCE AS PROPOSED. STAFF WROTE TO US THAT THEY WERE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR CONCERNS THAT QUOTE, ADOPTION WOULD LEAD TO FEWER BDERS HHE COSTS A LONG BID PROCESS AND DELAYED D/OR INCOMPLETE PROJECTS. END QUOTE. VIEFEWER BIDDERS, HIGHER COSTS D LONGER BID PROCESSES AND DELAY AND/OR IOMPLETE PROCTS. WOULD HEAVILY FAVOR LARGE ORGANIZATIONS OVER SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS, END QUOTE. I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT. DISADVANTAGING THE SMALLER AND LIKELY MORE LOCAL BIDDER AND CONTRACTORS. THOSE ADVERSE IMPACTS ARE NOT UNEXPECTED WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT WHAT THIS ORDINANCE IS DOING. IT'S AING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN WITH 15 NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON BIDS AS SMALL AS $25,000. STAFF ALSO SUGGESTED THAT IF COUNCIL IS INCLINES TO ADOPT THIS, IT MAY BE ECONOMICALLY AND PRACTICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO EXCLUDE ROAD AND RELATED CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS UTITY-RETED CONSTRUCON PRECTS. IHINK THAT MAKES SENSE. AND I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING IF MY COLLEAGUES SHARE THAT VIEW. IF SO, WE COULD ASK STAFF, THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AND I KNOW MR. WILHELM AND I BELIEVE MR. HORNIER ARE HERE TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, WHETHER WE SHOULD AMEND THIS TONIGHT OR SEND IT TO SFF FOR REVW OF THEIR FURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE ABSENCE OF CHANGES LIKE THIS TO MAKE THIS LESS ONEROUS AND BURDENSOME TO CONTRACTORS AN BIDDERS AND MORE COSTLY TO TAXPAYERS, I WILL NOT SUPPORT THE ORDINANCE TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
01:42:33.314: >> Mayor Tayr:COUNCILMBER RA LAW.
01:42:34.282: >> Councilmeer Ramlawi:  Y KNOW, I CAN'T SPEAK ANY BETTER ON THE MATTER THAN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM JUST DID, FOR THE SAME EXACT REASONS AND I DON'T THINK SHE MISSED A POINT. I WOULD LEAN ON STAFF TO CARVE OUT AND GIVE THEM THE -- THE BIGGT AMOUN OF HEARTBURN AND PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, UNTIL THOSE COULD BE MADE BUT I THINK MY COLLEAGUE SPOKE TO IT EXTREMELY WELL, AN AND I THANK HER FOR TT.
01:43:17.725: >>ayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:43:19.794: >> Councilmber Eaton: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT STAFF HAS PRESENTED US AND I -- I RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES LISTENING TO STAFF ON THESE MATTERS BUT THESE ARE THE SAME THINGS WE HEAR REPEATEDLY -- [ BACKGROUND NOISE ] AND WE TRY TO RAISE THE BAR ON A FEW YEA AGO, I BROUGHT FORWARD  RESOLUTION TO BETTER ENFORCE OUR PROVEILING WAGE -- PREVAILING WAGE ORDINANCE AND WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD CHASE AWAY BIDDERS AND IT WOULD BE SO BURDENSOME AND REPEATEDLY, WE HAVE LOOKED AT OUR EFFORTS TO ENFORCE R PREVAILING WAGE ORDINANCE AND IT DIDN'T DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT WERE WARNED ABOUT AT THAT TIME. ALL WE ARE DOING WITH THIS, IS THAT WE ARE SETTING A SET OF EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO DO BUSINESS WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AND I THINK THESE REPRESENT OUR BASIC CE VALUES. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME UNKNOWNS HERE. CERTAINLY, IF ALL OF THESE HORRORS COME TO FRUITION, WE SHOULD PROBABLY COME BACK TO LOOK AT IT. I THINK IT'S ALL REALLY QUITE HYPOTHETICAL NOW. I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL END UP W, IFHE ADVTAGE GOES TO AIGHT BIDDER WHO CUTS CORNERS AND MISTREATS EMPLOYEES, RESPONSIBLE BIDDERS WILL NOT BOTHER WITH BIDDING ON WORK WITH THE CITY. WE WANT THE RESPONSIBLE BIDDER. WE WANT THE WORK DON'T RIGHT AND THE EMPLOYEES TREATED WELL AND I THINK TT THIS IS -- [ GARBLED AUDIO ] THANK YOU.
01:45:11.739: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:45:15.043: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE PLACE THAT THIS IS COMING FROM AND CERTAINLY INTEND TO SUPPORT IT. I KNOW THAT WHILE NOT WELCOMED BY STAFF, I DO BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENT A THO THAT COMNIES AND BIDDERS WE WANT TO WORK WITH ARE ALREADY -- WILL ALREADY HAVE IN PRACTICE OR THEY WILL BE PRETTY TWEAKING AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON ALLUDED TO IN THE PAST, WHEN WE HAVE MADE SOME CHANGES THEY HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN WELCOMED, BUT I THINK IT IS -- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS WHE ITS OUR JOB, I THK TO PH BACK AND LAY OUT THE VALUES THAT -- THAT WE WANT TO SEE IN TER TERMS OF FAIR LABR PRACTICES. I APPRECIATE THE COSPONSORS BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT IT. RAMLAWI. Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
01:46:12.166: >> Councmember Ramlawi THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYR.

AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO PHAPS MAYBEOSTPONEHIS UNTIL THAT COULD BE DONE?
01:46:43.297: >> City Admin. Crawford: MR. HOR NING IS HERE TO SPEAK TO THIS ITEM.
01:46:46.334: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. THE CHANGES TO THE ORDINANCE WOULD NOT BE SIGNIFICANT. IT WOULD JUST BE A COUPLE OF LINES EXEMPTING UTILITY AND RURAL-RELATED PROJECT. WE COULD HAVE IT READY BY NEXT MEETING, IF THAT'S WHAT COUNCIL WOULD LIKE TO SEE.
01:47:07.989: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.

01:47:47.662: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:47:50.998: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHAT -- WHAT IS IT EXACTLY WE'RE TRYING TO CARVE OUT HERE? THERE'S A GROUP OF VENDORS THAT WE WANT TO EXCLUDE FROM THIS? AMAMI NOT UNDERSTANDING THIS? WHY ARE WE POSTPONEMENT IT? TO DO WHAT EXACTLY?
01:48:09.083: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, DO YOU WANT TO REFERENCE THE RATIONALE?
01:48:12.386: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD RATHER HAVE STAFF EXPLAIN IT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO WHAT EXACTLY THEY WOULD LIKE TO CARVE OUT, BY GIVING STAFF ADDITIONAL TIME TO BE ABLE TO HAVE COUNCIL WEIGIN O THAT ADDITIOL LANGGE. IT SEEMS TO BE DISADVANTAGE -- IT GIVES US A DISADVANTAGE TO A AGREE THAT I'M NOT COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING; WHEREAS, IF THERE WERE EXCEPTIONS MADE, THEN I COULD SUPPORT THIS MEASURE.
01:48:39.680: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GUESS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHAT WOULD BE THE BENEFIT OF ACCEPTING CERTAIN VENDORS FRO THESEABOR PRACTICES, THESE BIDDING PRACTICES.
01:48:51.259: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, IT'S IN THE ATTACHMENT HERE, AND THE STAFF'S RESPONSE TO AND THE CONCERNS WITH THE WAY IT IS CURRENTLY.

01:49:04.605: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, IN RESPONSE TO A QUEION, DOESHE STF HAVE ANY SUGGESTED PROVISIO AND SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS AND CONCERNS WERE LISTED. SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO ALLOW STAFF TO GO WORK UP THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN WE CAN REVIEW THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN THIS COMES BACK TO US. I DO THINK, YOU KNOW, MOST NOTABLY,TAFFXCLUDED SUGGESTING -- AND IT WAS NOTED, THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE UTILITY-RELATED MATTERS, THAT WAS ALSO IN A RESPONSE. AND I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS CHANGE IN THE DEFINITION OF RESPONSIBLE BIDDER BECAUSE I ASKED ABOUT THIS, IT HASN'T BEEN CHANGED AT ANY OTHER REQUIREMENT AS A PREVAILG WE, AND I -- AND RESPONSE WAS CORRECT. IT DOES NOT. SO I DO THINK GIVEN THE -- SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED, THAT WE OWE IT TO STAFF TO GET THIS RIGHT, AND SO CERTAINLY SUPPORT POSTPONING TO THE FIRST MEETING IN AUGUST. AND I WOULDIKE T MEE WITH STAFFS WELL.
01:50:19.113: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:50:21.549: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THE POSTPONEMENT, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN KINDS OF CONTRACTS FROM THIS ORDINCE. SECTION 14.3 OF THE CHARTER SAYS THAT WHEN BIDDING OUT CONTRACTS FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS FOR SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS, WE GRANT THE CONTRACT THE LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDER. THIS ORDINANCE DEFINES WHAT RESPONSIBLE BIDDER MEANS FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN SPONSIBLE BIDDER UNDER SECTION . ONE DEFINITION FOR ROADWORK AND ONE DEFINITION FOR OTHER KINDS OF WORK. I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO CARVE OUT THAT TYPE OF EXCEPTION. WE ARE DEFINING WHAT THE TERM RESPONSIBLE BIDDER IN THE CHARTER MEANS A I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS -- THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO IT.
01:51:31.819: >> Mayor Taylor: FOR MY PART, I WOULD VOTE AGAINST THE POSTPONEMENT FOR THE REASON I WOULD VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSED CHANGE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS ORDINANCE PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTRACT OUR VALUES. I THINK THAT THE WORK THAT -- YOU KNOW, I LOOK FORWARD TO WORK BEING PERFORMED FOR THE CITY BY BIDDERS AND CONTRACTORS THAT ARE -- ARE IN THE MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ORDINANCE. I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD THING FOR THE COMMUNITY AND I'M GLAD THAT WERE -- IOP THAT WE ARE GOING TO MOV IT FORWARD. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:52:11.225: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE AN AMENDMENT. I WILL ALLOW THE VOTE TO OCCUR FIRST. I HAVE HAVE AN AMENDMENT.

01:52:59.874: >> Councilmember Eaton: I ACTUALLY HAD JUST PREMATURELY RAISED MY HAND FOR THE QUESTION.
01:53:05.813: >> Councilmber Lumm: I GOING BE SEN SENDING YOU AN AMENDMEN. MS. BEAUDRY, I'M SENDING IT TO YOU AND IF YOU WOULD SEND IT TO COUNCIL, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. D I IS SEE MR. WILHELM AND HORHORNING. I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE HAS RECEIVED IT. THIS IS TO ADD THE REFERENCE TO THOSE TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO 1:312 (20) A AS NOTED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN ABOUT THE RELATES PROCTS. HA EVERYONE RECEIVED I THIS IS A MAJOR RECOMMENDATION BY STAFF TO EXCLUDE ROAD-RELATED CONSTRUCTION AND UTILITY-RELATED MATTERS. AS NOTED BY STAFF, IT MAY BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO INCLUDE RELATED CONSTRUCTION, AS WELL AS UTILITY-RELATED CONSTRUCTION. . HORNING OR MR. WILHELM OR BOTH, IF YOU WLD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THIS? I THINK EVERYONE HAS SEEN IT.
01:54:44.879: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT THE --
01:54:48.282: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S ADDING --
01:54:50.150: >> Mayor Taylor: I SEE DOWN BELOW.
01:54:52.887: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S ADDING WORDS IN PARAGRAPH A. THE WORDS HIGHLIGHTED IN RED.
01:55:00.628: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:55:14.308: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MR. HORNING SAK TO THI
01:55:19.813: >> I THINK IS IMPORTANT THAT THE RCP THAT WAS ADOPTED BY OAKLAND COUNTY AND WASHTENAW COUNTY SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE UTILITY AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION. SO THE POLICIES THAT THE COUNTIES APPROVE, DO NOT APPLY TO ROAD CONSTRUCTION OR WATER RESOURCE COMSSNS BECAU THEY ARE LEGLY SEPARATE ENTITIES. TO UNLESS THOSE SEPARATE ENTITIES DECIDE TO ALSO ADOPT THE POLICIES, THEY DO NOT APPLY. IF YOU READ THE WASHTENAW COUNTY RESOLUTI TT WAS PASSED, IT SPECIFICALLY SPEAKS TO CONSTRUCON, THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW BUILDINGS AND ADDITIONS TO EXISTING BUILDINGS AND REHABILITATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS AND SO ALL OTHER ASPECTS ARE EXCLUDED IN WASHTENAW COUNTY'S VERSION. IF YOU LOOK AT OTHERS AROUND THE STATE, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY HAS ONE, AND THEIRS APPLIES TO THE -- THEIR LANGUAGE EXACTLY. CONSTRUCTION AND REAL PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS. SO THAT WOULD NOT INCLUDE UTILITIES AND ROADS, AS FAR AS I KNOW.
01:56:47.668: >> Mayor Tayr: COUNCILMEMB LUMM, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. HORNING.
01:56:53.107: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. EATON.
01:56:53.807: >> Councilmember Eaton: I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. SO IN THE CASE OF THE COUNTY'S POLICY, THEY'RE EXCLUDING LOAD AND UTILITY CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE A ST SEPARATENN ENTY T OVERSEES THOSE PROJECTS AND THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO BIND THE ROAD COMMISSION TO A POLICY THAT THEY PASS.
01:57:16.563: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
01:57:17.965: >> Councilmember Eaton: AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM HERE. WE DO OUR OWN ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND WE DO OUR OWN UTILITY WORK; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:57:24.338: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
01:57:26.840: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO FOR -- BASED ON THAT DISTCTION, I'M GOI T OPPOSE THIS AMENDMENT. THANK YOU.

MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF C1? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S AROVED. C-2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE), ZONING OF 4.5 ACRES FROM R5 (HOTEL DISTRICT) TO C3 (FRINGE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT) 2800 JACKSON ROAD HOTELS, 2800 JACKSON ROAD. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF C-2. COCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. Councilmeer Ackerman: THANK YOU. IS IS FIRST READING OF A REZONING FROM R5 TO C3. THE PARCEL IS LOCATED AT 2800 JACKSON. THE FORMER SITE OF THE NOW DEMOLISHED MICHIGAN INN. THE CURRENT R5 ZONING DISTRICT IS LIMITED TO ONLY HOTEL CONSTRUCTION. AND WITH 216 HOTEL ROOMS TO BE BUILT IN A FOUR-STORY BUILDING. THE PROPOS C DISICT ALLS Y NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL USES IN THIS CASE THEY SEEK TO BUILD TWO FOUR-STORY HOTELS WITH A TOTAL OF 435 ROOMS AND THE INCREASE OF 19 POSSIBLE HOTEL ROOMS. STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROVAL TO THIS REZONING AND PROJECT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION BECAUSE IT COMPLIES WITH OUR MASTER PLAN AND WILL PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE AS HOTEL A COMMERCIAL REAESTATE MAETS AND NEEDS CHANGE OVER TIME. PLANNING COMMISSION HAD A RICH DISCUSSION OVER MANY MONTHS ABOUT THE PR PROPOSAL AND IN THE COURSE OF DISCUSSION, THE COMMISSION WAS ABLE TO SECURE FOUR MAIN AMENDMENTED AND UPDATES AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SITE. LIVING HOU SWAIL. ADDITION OF ANSO THE WATER RETENTION. INCLUDE NATIVE PLANTINGS THAT WILL HELP WITH WATER RETENTION AND CLEANING WHEN IT REENTERING THE A ACT WITH -- AQUIFER. AND WITHHE ADVICE OF ONE OF OUR LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, WE WERE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE PLANTINGS THAT WILL PROVIDE FASTER COVERAGE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT YEARS AND YEARS FOR THE PLANTS TO GROW HE TO PROTECT TOROTECTTHE VIEW FROM THE ROAD. AND SIGHT LINES, THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CURB CUTS TO ACCESS THIS NEW SIDEWALK. THE PETITIONER HAD ORIGINALLY HAD HIGHER PLANTINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BLOCKED THE VIEW OF THE MOTORISTS FROM SEEING PEDESTRIANS. THAT WAS LOWERED. AND THEN FINALLY,HEUILDING THAT IS MOST IMMIATE TO ACTION, WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE ARCHITECT TO REDESIGN THE FRONT, WHICH IS A MUCH MORE INVITING FACADE ON JACKSON, MAJOR THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH THIS PROPERTY WOULD BE DEVELOPED. ORIGINALLY, THE FACADE FACING JACKSON JUST LOOKED LIKE THE BACK OF A HOTEL BECAUSE IT WAS THE BACKF A HOTEL. AND NOW IT WILL BE A MUCH MORE -- MUCH IMPROVED. THAT IS EVERYTHING FROM MEL. -- FROM ME. I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.
02:03:35.842: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAAWI.
02:03:39.679: >> Cncmemberamwi: ANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. YEAH, I APPRECIATE THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.

SO WE'LL SEE WHAT COMES NEXT. THANK YOU.
02:04:14.781: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:04:15.916: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. I HATE TO BE TOO DETAIL ORIENTED BUT YOU STATED THAT E -- THE HEE OR THE BUSHES NEAR THE ROAD, NEAR THE PEDESTRIAN CROSSING HAD BEEN REDUCED, DO YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO 36 INCHES OR 30 INCHES?
02:04:39.072: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I DON'T SPECIFICITY. MR. LERT?
02:04:45.779: >> Couilmember Griold: ONE OF THE REASONS I'M AING THAT QUESTION. THE STANDARD IS 36 BUT WITH MORE AERODYNAMIC AND SMALLER CARS, 36 DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU ANY --
02:05:04.498: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S 24 CH TALL.
02:05:07.667: >>AND THENTENTIONAS TO CHANGE THE SPECIES TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD COMPLY WITH SOMETHING OVER LONGER TERM AND MORE ONGOING MAINTENANCE THAN TO MEET THE CITY CODE REQUIREMENTS. CAUGHT THANK YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
02:05:22.549: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL I FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYE IT IS APPROVE. C-3, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND TITLE VII (BUSINESSES AND TRADES) OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR BY ADDING A NEW CHAPTER WHICH SHALL BE DESIGNATED AS CHAPTER 97. SHORT-TERM RENTALS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NEON. SCUSSION OF C-3 COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:05:53.480: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO COMPLIMENT THE CITY STAFF FOR BRINGING THIS ORDINANCE BACK FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE REQUESTED, IN SPITE OF THE PANDEMIC, AND THANKS TO YOU, MR. DELACOURT AND TO YOUR ENTIRE TEAM. IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHY WE BEGAN THIS DISCUSSION TALKING ABOUT REGULATINHORTERM RENTS A YEAR AGO. SHORT-TERM RENTALS OF PROPERTIES HAVE GROWN DRAMATICALLY IN ANN ARBOR AND WITH THAT GROWS THE ADVERSE IMPACTS, NUISANCES, IMPACTS ON NEIGHBORHOODS AND REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF PERMANENT HOUSING. INCREASED TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECAME CLEAR FROM OUR RESIDENCE THAT SOMETHING INTO EDED TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF REGULATION. IN MY VIEW, THIS ORDINAN IS A VERY REANABLE AND POSITIVE STEP FORWARD. FROM HAVING NO REGULATION AT ALL AND NOT EVEN KNOWING WHO AND WHERE THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS WERE, TO HAVING A SOLID REGISTRATION, AND PROCESS THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CITY THE INFORMATION IT NEEDS TORE PROPER OVERSIGHT. WHILE HAVING A ROBUST REGISTRATION AND LICENSING SKIM IS CERINLY IMPORTANT, I BELIEVE TH THE ASPECTFHIS ORDINANCE THAT WILL HAVE THE GREATEST POSITIVE IMPACT IS PROHIBITING NONOWNER OCCUPIED RENTALS NONRESIDENTIALLY ZONED DISTRICTS. I MAY BE WRONG, BUT IT'S THAT SITUATION, NONOWNER OCCUPIED RESIDENTS THAT IS THE SOURCE OF MOST OF THIS ISSUE. THEY WOULD B PHIBITED AND LIEVE THAT WIL REST IN LESS NUISANCE COMPLAINTS AND LESS REDUCTION IN PERMANENT HOUSING STOCK. PERSONALLY BEING I BELIEVE STRICTER REGULATIONS MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE, SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS ON SPACING, LOCATION ARE OR LIMITING THE NUMBER OF RENTAL DAYS THAT THIS IS A GOOD START, AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT. NOT SURPRISINGLY, WE ARE GETTING PUSHBACK ON LEGAL THREATS FROM THE SHORT-TM RENL OWN WHO BENEFITED UNREGULAR LATED WILD WEST ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY WERE OPERATING IN PREVIOUSLY. I DO HEAR AND UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS BUT ON BALANCE, I'M MORE COMPELLED BY THE NEEDS OF OUR RESIDENTS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AT FIRST READING TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
02:07:59.539: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:08:00.473: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULDIKEO ASK MR. DELACOURT TO CE AND GIVE US MAYBE A THREE-MINUTE SYNOPSIS OF HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE AT WITH THIS ORDINANCE FROM WHERE IT BEGAN WITH COUNCIL INITIATED RESOLUTION TO LOOKING TO THE -- IF HE'S HE. SO TO BRING US UP TO SPEED.
02:08:28.601: >> I WOULD BE GLAD TO. I APPRECIATE IT. OBVIOUSLY, I THINK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM KIND OF LAID OUT THE HISTORY OF IT. SO I WON'T REPEAT ALL OF THAT, BUT STAFF WAS ASKED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SEVERAL MONTHS OR POTENTIALLY EVEN ABOUT A YEAR AGO, AND WE DID HOLD A SERIES OF PUIC EAGEMENT MEETINGS, ERE WE LISTENED TO A LOT OF FOLKS ON THEIR THOUGHTS ON SHORT-TERM RENTALS, THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THEM AND LAND USE AND SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO THEM. AND TRUTHFULLY FROM MY STANDPOINT, I HAVE BECOME 180 ON THIS FROM WHERE WE STARTED. WE HRD FM A LOTF FOLKS CLING THOSE WITH SHORT-TERM RENTALS ABOUT THE DESIRE TO CONTINUE OPERATION AND THE INVESTMENT AND A LOT OF ISSUES ARE SURROUNDING THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS WITHIN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS BUT WHAT BECAME CLEAR TO STAFF, THE MORE WE LISTENED TO THAT AND THE MORE WE TALKED ABOUT IT, WAS THE LAND USE REGULATIONS IN RELATION INTENT OF RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS IN THE CITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SHORT-TERM RENTALS FELL ON THE SIDE OF RESIDENTIAL LAND USE OR MORE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH A COMMERCIAL LAND USE. THE MORE WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND THE MORE WE LOOKED AT IT, THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROCESS OR THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL METHOD BY WHICTHESE PRORTIES ARE LEASED, IS SIMILAR IN OUR MINDS TO A COMMERCIAL USE OR MUCH MORE SIMILAR NO A COMMERCIAL LAND USE THAN A RESIDENTIAL LAND USE. WE ALLOW COMMERCIAL LAND USES WITHIN RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS BUT ONLY WHEN THEY ARE SECONDARY AND ACCESSORY TO A PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL LAND USE AND THAT'S THE SAME CONCLUSIOE CAME TO HERE, UNLIKE AN OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTY OR A PROPERTY THAT'S OCCUPIED BY A TENANT, UNDER A STANDARD LEASE FUNCTION WHERE THAT TENANT BECOMES THE OCCUPANT OF THE PROPERTY, EVEN BY THE TERMINOLOGY USED BY THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL INDUSTRY, THESE FOLKS ARE GUESTS, AND THE OCCUPANCY  THE PROPEY DOES NOT TAKE PLACEIMILARLY TO A LONG-TERM LEASE OR OWNER OCCUPIED SITUATION. SO THE MORE WE LOOKED AT IT, THE MORE OUR RECOMMENDATION CAME DOWN TO THAT SIMPLE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A COMMERCIAL LAND USE AND A RESIDENTIAL LAND USE IN THAT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A HOME, A RESIDENCE IN THE CITY, THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN OCCUPIED OR A TENANT- OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM PA --OCCUPANT, OR A TENANT IT CS INTO THE LAND OF COMMERCIAL LAND USE. THAT'S WHAT GUIDED OUR DECISION AS FAR AS A RECOMMENDATION THAT WOULD PROHIBIT SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND NONOWNER OCCUPIED STRUCTURES WITHIN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS AND LIMIT THEM TO ZONING DTRICTSHERE COMMERCI LAND USES AREORE NORMALLY ACCEPTED OR PERMITTED BY THE ORDINANCE. SO THERE'S MY THREE-MINUTE VERSION. I WILL STOP THERE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY.
02:11:30.083: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:S THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I WILL RESERVE COMMENT IF THERE'S A NEED FOR A SECOND THANK Y.
02:11:40.960: >> Councilmber Nelson: BER THANK YOU. I HAV A QUESTION ABOUT -- I'M LOOKING AT THE ORDINANCE NOW. IN TERMS OF DRAWING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE AND A NON-PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE, I'M CURIOUS -- I'M NOT SEEING IT HERE, BUT I READ ONEF THE DOCUMENTS THAHE IDEA IS THAT PROPERTY OWNER WOULD BE ISSUING US OR PRESENTING A SWORN STATEMENT THAT THEY ARE, IN FACT, A RESIDENT OF THE DWELLING. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER METHODS OF VERIFYING OR CONFIRMING THAT, IN FACT, THEY ARE THE -- THAT THIS IS, IN FACT,HEIR PRIIPAL RESIDENCE.
02:12:33.112: >> I CAN ONLY RELATE TO IT IN LONG-TERM OR TRADITIONAL LANDLORD TENANT RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE WE DON'T CERTIFY AND AN OWNER OCCUPIED SITUATI.HERE'S WE DO RELY ON A MULTITUDE OF THINGS INCLUDING HOMESTEAD EXCEPTIONS AND OTHER TOOLS TO TRY TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS AN OWNER OCCUP OCCUPANT OF THE PRO. THERE'S NO ONE PERFECT METHOD BUT WE USE A MULTITUDE OF WAYS TO DETERMINE THAT AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO BE SIMILAR IN THIS INSTANCE AS WELL.
02:13:08.715: >> Councilmeer Nelson: SO IF I OWNED A HOME THAT I WANTED TO USE AS PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE, SHORT-TERM RENTAL UNIT, I WOULD -- IN ORDER TO GET A LICENSE, I WOULD -- I WOULD PRESENT EVIDENCE TO YOU THAT I'M TAKING THE HOMESTEAD EXCEPTION ON MY TAXES AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT -- WHAT OTHER GUESS HAVEOMMUNICATIONITHAN, I OPLE WHO ARE -- AND I KNOW THAT YOU AND I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS. WE PASS AN ORDINANCE LIKE THIS, THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COMPLY WITH, IT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO BE RUNNING AFOUL OF THE LAW, BUT, YEAH, I'M SORT OF CURIOUS ABOUT VERIFICATION OF THAT. I MEAN, I THINK THE PROCESS, THE APPLICATION FOR THE LICENSE ON THE APPLICATION ITSELF WILL REQUIRE SIGNATURE STATING THAT THEY ARE THE OWNER OCCUPANT OF THAT PROPERTY, IF THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT IN A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT. WE DON'T NEED THEM TO PROVIDE. WE CAN CERTAINLY DOUBLE CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOMESTEAD PROPERTY, BUT THAT IS NOT 100% % BULLETPROOF IN THIS, JUST BECAUSE IT'S HOMESTEED DOESN'T AN THEY NECESSARILY LIVE THERE. OR THEY COULD HAVE -- THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF WAYS TO HAVE IT HOMESTEADED. THERE'S NO BULLETPROOF WAY TO MAKE SURE, LIKE YOU SAID, WE WILL REQUIRE SOME KIND OF STATEMENT ALONG WITH THE APPLICATION, THAT THIS IS THE -- AN OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTY AND THAT THEY ARE SUCH, WHEN THEY MAKE THE APPLICATION FOR THE LINSE OR THEIRGENT. BUT WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME WE WILL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE AND THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL NOT BE SURPRISINGLY 100% HONEST WITH US ON THAT, BUT THAT IS NOT DISSIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ISSUES WE DEAL WITH ON LONG-TERM RENTALS AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS -- WHEN WE FIND BETTER METHODS, WE WILL ADD THEM TO OUR APPLICATION PROCESS AS WELL.
02:14:58.324: >> MAYOR?
02:14:58.724: >> City Admin. Crawford: MR. MAR K IS HERE IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. BUT JUST SO YOU ARE AWARE WHEN A RESIDENT CLAIMS A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE EXEMPTION, WE DON'T ACCEPT THAT ON OUR FACE. I'M NOT SURE WE WANT TO SHARE ALL OF OUR TOOLS AS AS FAR AS HOW WE LOOK IF THEY ARE A PRINCILESIDENCE B WE ME SURE THATHAT I THE CASE.
02:15:21.914: >> I'M GLAD TOM SAID THAT.
02:15:26.619: >> THANK YOU.
02:15:27.854: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:15:29.155: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THOSE TOOLS ARE. I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. I HAVE DIDN'T SUPPORT THIS WAY BACK WHEN WE VOT TO SEND OFF STAFF TO CHOOSE THIS THIRD AND MOST ONEROUS OF OPTIONS. I HAVE SOME FEARS ABOUT THIS AND I ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE KIND OF WALKING THE LINE BETWEEN LOOKING OUT FOR THE HEALTH, SAFETY AND THE WELFARE OF CURRENT RESIDENTS AND ANYBODY THAT COMES TO TOWN IN THAT WE HAVE SHORTERM NONRESENTIAL ANDE ARE ANTICITING THAT IF WE PASS THIS, WE WILL REQUIRE THE LICENSING AND I THINK THAT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE AND THE INSPECTION OF NONRESIDENTS, BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS IN 2C OF 7654, WE SAY THAT IF IT'S A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE OR A SHORTERM RENTAL WE DON'T REQUIRE INSPECTION. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN CLAIM THAT ONE IS A COMMERCIAL USE AND ONE IS NOT A COMMERCIAL USE IF WE ARE NOT INSPECTING BOTH OF THEM.
02:16:37.390: >> GO AHEAD, I'M SORRY.
02:16:39.525: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S ONE OF MONEY CONCERNS I I.VE WITH US BEFORE.
02:16:45.798: >> I WOU LIK TO POINT OUT THAT THE REASON FOR THAT DISTINCTION IS BECAUSE IT'S SIMAR TO OUR LONG-TERM AND OUR STANDARD RENTAL ORDINANCE, IF IT'S AN OWNER OCCUPIED STRUCTURE NOW, THE ASSUMPTION OF THE ORDINANCE IS THE OWNER TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT PROPERTY. IF YOU OWN YOUR PROPERTY AND YOU LEASE A PORTION OF IT WITHOUT, WHETHER IT'S FOR A LONG-TERM SIX SHORT TERM, UNDER THISER IT' REGULATION, THE CITY DOES NOT INSPECT IT. SO WE DO NOT CURRENTLY INSPECT RENTAL PROPERTIES, LONG-T. RENTAL PROPERTIES WHERE THE OWNER IS PRESENT. IT'S THE HOMEOWNERS' RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE -- THE PROTECTION -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IS SIMILAR TO A RESTAURANT OR ANOTHER ONE. INVITINGHEUBLIC IN WITHOUT VING A RESPONSIBLE PARTY WOULD ACTUALLY LIVES THERE. NOW MAYBE THAT'S A DISTINCTION THAT SHOULD NOT BE DRAWN, BUT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE INSPECT LONG-TERM RENTALS. IF WE WOULD CHANGE IT FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS THEN I WOULD SUGGEST WE CHANGE IT FOR LONG-TERM RENTALS AND DO A CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR THE NONSHORT-TERM OR LONG-TE RENTALS F LACKF A BETTER TERM. THE REAS IT'S IN THE ORDER INNOCENCE THIS WAY, IT'S -- ORDINANCE, THIS WAY IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PROCESS.
02:18:01.407: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF WE ARE ISSUING A LICENSE IN SOME SENSE, WE ARE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT PROPERTY, BUT WE ARE NOT DOING THE INSPECTION. SO I THINK THAT'S -- I THINK THAT'S A GRAY AREA FOR ME, THAT I AL -- I NO HE ONE OHEHIS. CALLERS AND I HAD THE SAME THOUGHT MYSELF. WE SPOKE TO THE NOTION THAT WHERE DOES THIS BELONG AND AREN'T WE MAKING IT A ZONING ISSUE VERSUS A USE ISSUE? AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING TO ME, BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ARE E A RESIDENTIAL USE VA LO-TERM USE. IT'S NOT A MANUFACTURING CONCERN OR A RESTAURANT OPENING UP OR A SALES OFFICE OR WHATEVER. AND SO I -- I HAVE MORE -- I DON'T THINK THIS IS CORRECT IN THE FORM IT IS BEFORE US.
02:18:49.955: >> AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY, ONE THE DISTINCTIONS WE DO MAKE IS WE CAN FIND NOWHERE UNDER THE SHO-TERM RENTA OR THE AIRBNB SCENARIO WHERE IS THE GUEST IS CONSIDERED A TENANT. THEY DO NOT SIGN A LEASE WITH THE OWNER THE PROPERTY. IT'S A THIRD-PARTY AGREEMENT. AND MAYBE I'M PARSING TERMS HERE BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY SPECIFIC THAT PART OF THE REASON FOR OUR RECOMMENDATION IS BECAUSE UNDER THE SHORT-TERM PROCE, IT IS NOTIMAR T A TENANT WHO TAKES OCCUPANCY OF THE PROPERTY. THEY SIGN A USE AGREEMENT WITH AIRBNB, BUT THERE'S NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OWNER AND THE GUEST.
02:19:32.365: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT SEEMS SEEMS LIKE A SEMANTIC ARGUME. THESE IS THAT YOU ARE TAKING TEMPORARY TENANCY OF THIS PROPERTY. I SEE MR. POSTEMA SHAKING HIS HEAD THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITH TENANT RIGHTS AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS, AND THAT'S FINE, BUT I THINK WE ARE SPLITTING HAIRS HERE. AND SO ONE THE CONCE CONCERNS, W THAT'S BEEN DRIVING THIS AND I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH RENTALS CAN BE A REAL NUISANCE. I KNOW WE HAVE SOME RESIDENTS IN THE WARD ONE WHO HAVE A MISFORTUNE OF HAVING A FULL-TIME, NONOWNER OCCUPIED OWPARTY HOUSE NEXT TO THEM AND M SYMPATHETIC TO THAT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE AIRBNB, WHATEVER THE HE CA MY KCK , THE LEASIN OR T USE MECHISM DOES PROVIDE FOR THAT AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE A POSTING AND A LISTING AND THE NEIGHBOR WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND OUT JUST WHO IT WAS, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS HOUSE, SHORT OF CALLING THE POLICE, WOULD PROVIDE SOME SECURITY FOR THAT. I MEAN, THE PLATFORMS THEMSELVES HAVE -- HAVE METHODS TO CONTROL THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR, SUOSEDLY. YOU KNOW, AND I ALSO WONDER, IF THE VAST -- AND THIS CAME UP BEFORE AND I ACTUALLY NEVER GOT AN ANSWER, IF THE VAST MAJORITY OF NUISANCE CALLS ARE FOR TRADITIONAL COLLEGE-TYPE RENTALS OR SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I WOULD GUESS THAT JUST BASED ON THE VOLUME OF TRADITIONAL NTS IN THI TOWN, THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPLAINTS CE FROM THOSE RENTALS AND NOT SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I THINK WE'RE GOING A LITTLE OVERBOARD HERE WITH THIS AND I DON'T SUPPORT IT IN ITS CURRENT STATE.
02:21:18.070: >> AND JUST FROM A STAFF POINT OF VIEW, TO CLARIFY, WE GET VERY, VERY FEW IF ANY NUISANCE COMPLAINTS ABOUT SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THAT SNOT WHAT DRIVES O IN FACT, IF WE H ZERO NUISANCE CALLS WE WOULD MAKE THE EXACT SAME RECOMMENDATION TO YOU. JUST FROM A STAFF STANDPOINT, I KNOW EVERYBODY ON COUNCIL HAS HAD A ORDINARY FROM A LOT OF FOLKS, BUT OUR RECOMMENDATION IS -- HAS NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE -- THE AMOUNT OF NUANCE CALLS WHATSOEVER. THIS IS STRICTLY AER REVIENG THUSE, AND HOW IT'S STRUCTURED. THAT LINE THAT WE HAVE THAT YOU CANNED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING. IT'S NOT A THIN, SIMPLE LINE. IT'S NOT A BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE, BUT WHEN THE STAFF LOOKED AT, IT WE ARE MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS FALLS ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF THAT LINE AND LONG-TERM RENTALS FALL ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE. BUTHAT -- THAT RECOMNDATION STAYS THE SAME, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF NUANCE CALLS WE GET OR NOT.
02:22:20.599: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE RENTALS THAT ARE EXISTING AND IN THE FUTURE -- THOSE IN THE RESINTIAL ZONED NEIGORHOOD -- I SHARE A DRIVEWAYAND I WAS TALKING TO MY NEIGHBORS ABOUT THIS AND I WOULD NOT LOVE IT IF THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO ME TURNED INTO -- THAT SHARED OUR DRIVEWAY, TURNED INTO HAVING 300 NEIGHBORS A YEAR INSTEAD OF ONE NEIGHBOR A YEAR AND WE'RE FORTUNATE, WE ALWAYS HAD GOOD NEIGHBORS. WE TRY TO BE NEIGHBORLY. SO I GET IT. I UNDERSTAND WHY WE DON'T WANT THESE IN A RESENTIAL SITUATION. THE SAME TIME, I THINK WE CAN CREATE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR LIKE MARIJUANA DISPENSARY, WHERE YOU COULD GO TO THE NEIGHBORS AND SAY DO YOU HAVE ANY INPUT OR CONSIDERATION IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA, IT COULD CONTUE TO EXISTS AM RENTAL OR SHORT-TERM RENTAL. IT SEEMS LIKE A WORK AROUND THAT MIGHT BE TOLERABLE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING OUT OF THE GAME IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREA AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL EVER KNOW BECAUSE I SUSPECT THAT WHAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN, IF THIS PASSES, THE FOLKS THAT ARE NOW OPERATING DISCREET SHORT-RM RENTALS ARE NOT GOING APPLY FOR A LICENSE AND NOT GOING TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE A SHORT-TERM RENTALS UNTIL THEY ARE BUSTED, AS IT WERE. I HAVE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS DRIVING FOLKS UNDERGROUND. THANK YOU.
02:23:55.961: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, GRISWOLD, ACKERMAN, SMITH AND GRAND.
02:24:01.266: >> Councmember Griold: YE I DO HE SE CONCERNS BECAUSE ASE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE AIRBNB OWNERS, OUR ZONING IS NOT REAL SPECIAL IN TERMS OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL. IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN SAY, THAT'S DEFINITELY COMMERCIAL. AND THAT'S DEFITELY RESIDENTIAL. GIVEN THAT AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN A FINANCIAL CRISIS RIGHT NOW, AND MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO DO AS LIVELIHOOD HARM AND CREATE AS LITTLE DISRUPTION AS POSSIBLE. SO I WOULD BEFORE AN OPTION THAT ALLOWED SOME GRANDFATHERING WITH BROKE THE CRITERIA, WOULDOUU LOSE THE GRANDFATHERING. BUT I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE WE CAN DO THE ELEM AMOUNT OF HARM T WOULD DO AT THE CURRENT TIME. THANKS.
02:25:00.292: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK THZAZACK THANK YOU MR. MAYD THANK YOU
02:25:07.433: >> Councmember Ackman: ANKOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE INPUT ON THIS ISSUE. I PROBABLY HAVE A DOZEN PLUS PHONE CALLS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT RETURNING THEM. THIS CAME AT A TIME WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF BANDWIDTH TO RETURN MANY PHONE CALLS. I APOLOGIZE TO THE STAFF FOR NOT FINDING TIME TO SHARE THIS FEEDBACK EARLIER I HAV SOME CONCERNS AROUND THE EQUITY OF ALLOWING THESE OPERATIONS IN MIXED USE OVER RESIDENTIAL AREAS I THINK MY CERTAIN AND ANXIETY AND FEAR IMPAT HAS ON HOUSI SUPPLY.S THE WE EXIST IN A HOUSING SHORTAGE EVERY DAY, EVERY MONTH WE DON'T BUILD NEW HOUSING WE CAUSE PEOPLE TO BE PRICED OUT OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THE MORE UNITS OF HOUSING THAT ARE BOUGHT UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHORT-TERM RENTAL, THE LESS HOUSING STOCK IS ON THE MKET FOR RENTERS TO RENT AND HOMEOWNERS TO BUY AND ROOT INTO OUR COMMUNITY, THE PEOPLE GO WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY, THE PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO RETIRE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND I DO HAVE SOME CONCERN A TO IF THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS, IS THIS SOMETHING WE WANT IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS? AND UNDERSTAND IF WE PUT IT LEGALLY USE, THAT ALLOWS COMMERCIAL, MAKES SENSE. BUT IF WE WENT ASK HOMEOWNERS TOIVE THETOLIVE NEXT TO THIS AND WE WANT RENTERS TO LIVE NEXT TO THIS. AND THE HOTSPOTS ARE NORTH CAMPUS, THE MEDICAL CENTER, DOWNTOWN CENTRAL CAMPUS, AND UTH STATE STREET WHERE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS GROWTH OF FOOTAGE THAT ONCE WENT ALONG WITH OFFICE SPACE. AND THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO BE MT CONCERN ABOUT THE HOUSING SUPPLY. I HAVE PAUSE ABOUT THE LOCATIONS AND I GUESS I WILL LEAVE IT THIS FOR NOW.
02:27:57.202: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:27:58.604: >> Councilmember Smith: I DIDN'T SUPPORT THIS AT FIRST READING AND I WON'T SUPPORT IT TONIG. COUNCILMBER ACKERN, DEFTLY EXPLAINED MANY OF MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. IT BOILS DOWN TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE. I THINK WE ARE SETTING OURSELVES UP TO DO A LOT OF HARM TO INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY BY GOING DOWN THIS PATH, AND RELY, WT'S HAPPENING IS PEOPLERE SLEEPING IN A HOUSE. SAME AS THEY WOULD, WHETHER THEY ARE RENTING IT OR OWNED IT, OR A GUES YOUOULD CAL IT COMMERCL. I THINK THAT'S TRYING TO GET TOO FINE TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO REGULATE THIS. I THINK THIS IS DRACONIAN. I THINK THERE'S A MUCH EASIER WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS AND IT'S TO, YOU KNOW, LICENSE, INSPECT, REQUIR THE PUBLICATION OF A LOL AGENT SO NEIGHBORS CAN CONTACT. I THINK, YOU KNOW, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD MADE THE POINT THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE AT A TIME WHERE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN -- BEEN CALLING US ABOUT THIS STUFF THIS IS, YOU KNOW, EITHER THEIR ENTIRE LIVELIHOOD OR A HUGE PORTION OF IT, AND WE ARE SET TO WIPE THAT OUT. AND SO I WOULD EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE INITIGATION FOR A AWFUL LONG TIME ABOUT THIS. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE DOING THAT. I WOULD SUPPORT PULLING TOGETHER ATE TASK FORCE THAT WORKS WITH SOME OF THESE FOLKS TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND. I CANNOT VOTE TO TAKE THIS LEVEL OF ACTION. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT IT'S COME TO THIS. THANK YOU.
02:29:56.855: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:30:01.793: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK LIKE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. I SEE A LOT OF PROS AND CONS. BY THE TIME OF A COUNCIL MEETING, I KNOW EXACTLY WHICH WAY I'M VOTIN ON SOMETHI, CAUSE I TUGHT ABOUTT. AND THIS, TO ME, I KEEP GETTING PUSHED AND PULLED TO EITHER SIDE. I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS, LIKE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN DOES, ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD DO TO OUR HOUSING SUPPLY. I HAVE REALLY NOT AS ABOUT CONCERNS AT ALL AUT NEHBORHOOD -- CTAINLYOT NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER. NOT EVEN REALLY SEMICOMMERCIAL USES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE SEE OTHER COMMERCIAL USES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY ARE OFTEN SOME OF THE MOST BELOVED ENSURE SUBSTITUTIONS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH HAVING  BNGING IN THAT KIND OF USE THAT IS JUST HOUSING INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HOUSING SUPPLY AND I ALSO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, I DO SEE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN OUR COMMUNITY. MAYBE NOT AN INFINITE NUMBER AND I WISH WE HAD GONE TO A PLACE WHERE WE COULD THINK ABOUT HOW WE COULD REGULATE THAT GROWTH IN SOME WAY, BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THIS COMMUNITY FOR SHORT-TERM STAYS AT THE MEDICAL CENTER, IN PARTICULAR, AND I'M -- I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THAT NEEDHAT'S BEG MET AND INOWHAT SHT-TERM RENTALS OFTEN BRING PEOPLE INTO OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BEEN EXPOSED TO OUR COMMUNITY AND THEY MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT MOVING HERE OR THEY'RE HAVING THEIR HOUSE REP RENOVATED AND SOMETIMES IT ALLOWS US TO KEEP PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHICH IS A GOOD THING. SO MY BIGST CONCERN ISHE IMPA ON HOUSING SUPPLY, BUT I WISH WE COULD GO WITH SOMETHING THAT REGULATES THAT AS COUNCILMEMBER SMITH MENTIONED, WHERE WE HAVE AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE PERSON THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN CONTACT IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH BEHAVIOR AT THAT SITE. THAT'S NOT CALLING THE POLICE RST. RIGH BEUSE I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE TO THAT AS A COMMUNITY AS WELL. I DID HAVE JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR MR. DELACOURT. I WAS LOOKING AT THE TEXT. I KNOW THERE WAS A THERE WAS A STATEMENT ORMAIL ABOUT REVING DID I T CLARK -- THE COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER, AND WHEN I LOOKED AT THE TEXT I STILL SAW IT IN THERE. DID THAT GET EDITED?
02:32:58.703: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. DELACOURT YOU ARE ON MUTE.
02:33:00.338: >> GOT IT. IT HAS NOT. IT NEEDS TO. AS I DISCUSSED IN THAT EMAIL, THE USE OF THAT TMINOLOGY WAS A MTAKE ON OUR PART OF STAFF AND SHOULDN'T BE INCLUDED ANYWHERE IN THIS. WE -- IF THERE'S NO AMENDMENT MADE TONIGHT, TO STRIKE IT FROM ANY PART OF THE RECORD, OR THE ORDINANCE, WE INTEND TO BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND READING IF THIS MOVES FORWARD. GANZ OKAY. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. I'M TRYING TO TING T ELIMITE THT WORD FRO MY VOLU VOCABULARY.
02:33:36.141: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:33:37.008: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE RAISED IN NOT SUPPORTING THIS RIGHT NOW, AND THIS IS FIRST READING, NOT SECOND READING, SO IT WE WILL BE COMING BACK AT THIS AGAIN IF IT DOES GET SUPPORT. I'M JUST PPLEXED AS TO THE MOST ARDENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPONENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE MUCH LONGER THAN THE REST OF THIS, DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH SHORT-TERM RENTALS, THESE SHORT-TERM RENTALS GOING INTO SINGLE FAMILY HOME AREAS, DRIVINGP THE CT O HOUSING FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE NEARBY. I MEAN, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S NOT MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED. YOU KNOW, IF FOLKS ARE LOOKING TO STAY SOMEWRE, WHERE THEY AREENOVATING THEIR HOUSE, THEY ARE PROBABLY NOT STAYING FOR THREE DAYS, BUT PROBABLY FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AND THIS ORDINANCE DOESN'T PROHIBIT THAT. IF THEY WANTED TO RENT A HOUSE FOR 31 DAYS OR 32 DAYS, THEY ARE ALLOWED TO. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS RENT IT FOR MORE THAN 30 DAYS. YOU KNOW, SO FOR ME, THERE'S A STRONG CORRELATION AND IT' NOT SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN YET, BETWEEN THESE SHORT-TERM RENTALS BEING USED AS VEHICLES OF INVESTMENT IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND DRIVING UP THE COST OF LIVING. IT'S BASICAL 101. YOU DON'T NEED A MASTER'S DEGREE FROM ROSS, I THINK, TO UNDERSND THIS AND IF YOU DID YOU WILL MHT BE BRAIN WASHED TO THINK AGAINST IT. BUT THAT IS MY WITHIN, THAT THIS RIGHT HERE IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE RUNAWAY COSTS OF HOUSING WHEN WE -- WHEN WE -- YOU KNOW, SET THE PRICE BASED ON RENTAL INCOME. I MEAN THAT'SOWEAL EATE I PRED. IT IS PRICED ONHAT YOU CAN RENT IT FOR. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. THESE WILL STILL BE PERMITTED. THEY WILL BE PERMITTED IN MIXED USE ZONING AND AREAS OF YOU ARE COMMUNITY THAT ALLOW FOR THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BUT THIS WAS A -- YOU KNOW, -- THIS IS PART OF THE NEW GIG ECONOMY, THE NEW SHARING ECONOMY AND IT'S TAKEN A MINUTE FOR GOVERNMENTS TO RESPOND IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY TO -- TO THIS TYPE OF BUSINESS. AND IT IS A COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY. IT'S NOT THE TYPES THAT BECOME BELOVED. SORRY TO DR. GRAND THAT THIS IS -- THESE THINGS DO NOT BECOME THE NEXT SELMA CAFE. AND SO I WILL RESERVE MY COMMENT UNTIL SECOND REANG. M P PERPLEXED BYHE INDIVIDUALS THAT ADVOCATE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WHEN THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE, THAT ARGUMENT IS NOT THERE.
02:36:58.410: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. ACKERMAN.
02:36:59.043: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES, I REALIZE THAT I NEVER ACTUALLY STATED OUTCOME THAT I WANTED WITH RESPECT TO MY ANXIETY. AND NOW IS ACTUALLY BECAUSE -- IT'S MORE REGULATION, NOT LESS. THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO -- WE ARE GOING TO PAN THEM IN SINGLE FAMILY, AND -- BAN THEM IN SINGLE FAMILY AND ALLOW THEM IF WE REGULAT THEM SOME AAFTER FLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS WE SHOULD REGULATE NEIGHBORHOODS THE SAME WAY. AND THAT WAS THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE. BECAUSE I DON'T -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL OVER TIME LIMIT SUPPLY OF HOUSING. AND THE TYPE OF HOUNGHAT WE NEED OFTENILL BE EITHER -- EITHER EXISTS NOW OR WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS. SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT POINT.
02:38:05.343: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, SMITH AND LUMM ON FIRST READING. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:38:10.315: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, LIKE THE REST OF US, WE HAVE ALL HRD LOT FROHE ARESIDENTS AND THE OWNERS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND IT DOES -- THE THINGS THAT CONCERN ME IS THAT IT DOES TEAM LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF LOOSE ENDS WITH THE ISSUES AND SO I WOULD SUPPORT AN OPENING UP THE PROCESS AND HAVING A WORKING GRO TO LOOK AT THE ISSUES AND THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE HERE, TO GET MORE INPUT -- AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF LAWSUIT POM POTENTIAL HEE AND THAT'S SOMETHING FOR T CIND THE RIDENTS ANDHE OWNERS TO AVOID AND SO I SUPPORT OPENING UP THE PROCESS AND FORMING A WORKING GROUP AND ALSO NOT AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD SAID AND OTHERS SAID, NOT LIMITING THE LIVELIHOODS OF THESE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. I THI THAT'S A REALLY BADDEA AND SO IF WE FOCUS ON THE ISSUES AND HAVE A WORKING GROUP THAT SHOULD WORK OUT MORE THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE FACING WITH THIS ISSUE. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:39:36.935: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE THINKING OF SOME OTHER PEOPLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT I THINK -- I THINK EVEN IF CONVERSATION AROUND THIS ISSUE STARTED AROUND THE TOPIC OF NUISANCE, THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE TOPIC THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOW. I DON'T -- I DON'T HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER. I'M ONLYHINKING IN TERMSF THE RESIDENTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO LIVE HERE YEAR ROUND AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE STUCK ON THE IDEA OF LIVELIHOOD LOST WHEN WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE AMASSED EXTRA PROPERTIES THAT DON'T LOSE THEIR VALUE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THEM AT THEIR HIGHEST VALUE AND EXTRACT THE GREATEST PROFIT MARGIN FROM THEM. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE MONEY WITH MY HOUSE IF I ALLOWED PEOPLE TO COME IN AND DO DRUGS IN IT, BUT I DON THINK THA TH WOULD BE LEG. AND I'M NOT MAKING THAT COMPARISON. I'M JUST SAYING THAT FOR MANY OF US, THE HIGHEST -- THE HIGHEST PROFIT WE CAN MAKE OFF OF OUR PROPERTY MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT. I GUESS THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS WHEN I LOOK AT THE MAP AND I LOOK AT THE MIXED USE STRICTS, I'MEALIZING THAT ORDINANCE WOULD MAKE IS PRETTY LOMINGICAL. I -- IT'S TRUE THAT IT IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON DOWNTOWN SECTORS MORE THAN OTHERS, BUT QUITE A BIT OF THE DOWNTOWN IS ALREADY NOT PARTICULARLY OPEN TO RESIDENTIAL USE ANYWAY. AND SO THE -- I THINK THE CONCERN IS THATHILE THESE ARE WANT TO RETAIN THOSE AREAS OF HOUSING AS WELL. WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A MARKET FOR ST Rs AND THAT THERE'S A VALUE TO ALLOWING THEM IN THIS TOWN, IN SOME AREAS. I THINK THAT THIS IS A PRETTY ELEGANT WAY OF SIMPLY RESTRICTING THEM AND SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE CAP. LIKE, THEY CAN ONLY EXIST IN THESE PLACES. I ACTUALLY HAVE A QSTION F MR. DELLA ACOURT OR MAYBE IT'S MR. LENART -- DELACOURT OR MAYBE IT'S MR. LENART. IF THE ZONING IS WHAT DEFINES WHETHER THIS IS PERMITTIBLE OR NOT AS A NON-PRINCIPALLED RESIDENCE. IS THERE A PROCESS, IF I'M A PROPERTY OWNER AND I FEEL STRONGLY THAT MY PROPERTY WOULD DO FE AS AN STR AND MAYBE I HAVE ALL THE ZONING AROUND ME, WOULD BE -- WOULD PERMIT IT, BUT I'M ON AN ISLAND, COULD I GO TO PLANNING AND REQUEST A CHANGE IN ZONING TO PERMIT ME TO A NON-PRINCIPALLED RESIDENCE STR. IS THAT A PROCESS I COULD GO FORWARD WITH?
02:42:34.011: >> WELL, IN THEY, THE LAST PART Y DESCRIBED, YES. ANYBODY CAN ASK FOR A REZONING. THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY WITHIN A SUBDIVISION OR A PLATTED RESIDENTIAL AREA GETTING AN INDIVIDUAL REZONING, I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT, BUT IN THE SCENARIO YOU PAINTED IF YOU HAVE AN ISOLATED ISLAND OF A SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY, WHERE THIS WOULD BE MITED TO OERCCUPIED ONLY, AND WERE TO REQUEST A REZONING, I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THOSE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE THAT WOULD BE FEASIBLE, I'M GUESSING VERY, VERY RARE IN THE CITY.
02:43:10.281: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING, WE HEARD ARGUMENTS THAT STRs ARE FUNCTIONING GREAT IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND PEOPLE ARE -- IO UNDERSTANDHATEOPLE WHO ARE WHO OWN THESE AND MAINTAIN THESE STRs ARE MAINTAINING EMO A H HIGH STANDARD. THEY ARE NOT A BRIGHT ON E NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HEARD THE ARGUMENTS THAT THEY ARE SO WELL MAINTAINED THAT THEY ARE AN ASSET TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY ARE A PART OF. THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS, IF WE MAKE THE DISTINCTION, E --F THE DIVIDINGINE BETWEEN PERMISBL OR NON-MER MISSABLE IS THE ZONING. PROPERTY OWNERS -- NOSE THE LIKE THEY ARE LACKING A PATH. IF YOU CAN -- IF YOU CAN REQUEST A REZONING, THEN THERE'S A PATH. THERE'S A PATH TO COME TO THE CITY AND SAY, I WOULD LIKE A REZONING AND IF I GET A REZONING, THEN, MY NON-PRINCIPALLED RESIDENT STR IS PERMITTED. AM I MISUNDERSTANDING SOMETHING?
02:44:07.738: >> NO, NO, BY ALL REASONABLE YOU CAN ASK. I THINK THE S SCENARIOS WHERE MY OF THESE ARE LOCATED ON WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THESE. NOWHERE IN THE CITY AND I THINK THE WORD -- I FORGET WHERE IT IT WAS UD ITHE CITY OR THE STAFF ISECOMMENDING THAT THESE BE BANNED. IF YOU -- ANY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY WHERE YOU HAVE AN OWNER OCCUPANT, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER USE THAT'S SECONDARYO. ACCESSARRY, WHETHER IT'S OFFICE, OR -- AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE OWNER OCCUPANT OR THE TENANT OCCUPANT THEY CAN BE USED FOR THE SHORT RENTAL. THEY CAN STILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AVLABLE ANYWHERE WITHIN THESE DISTRICTS AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL FOR THOSE FOLKS TO MAKE I AREVENUE ON. IF FOLKS HAVE BOUGHT THESE PROPERTY WITH THE SOLE INTENTION OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED. BUT THERE'S NO PROHIBITION AGAINST LONG-TERM RENTAL. IT'SOT A MONEY LOS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. BUT THEY ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM RENTING THESE PROBLEMS. IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO TURN AROUND AND SELL THEM OR THEY HAVE NO RENTAL USE FOR THEM WHATSOEVER. IT JUST HAS TO BE MORE THAN 30 DAYS WHICH ALSO ADDRESSES A LOT OF CCERNS THATEOPLE HE EXPRESSED AUT THE TYPE OF FOLKS WHO WOULD USE THESE FOR FAMILY WHO HAVE LONG-TERM MEDICAL CARE, OR OTHER USES. IT'S NOT THAT WE ARE SAYING THAT IT HAS TO BE SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR. AND IT JUST HAS TO BE 30 DAYS AND THERE HAS TO BE A MORE TRADITIONAL LAND LORD TENANT RELATIONSHIP. THERE'S NO BANNING OF THESE WHATSOEVER. AND I WANTED TO -- WHILE I'M HERE AND I HAVE A MOMENT, I WILL ADDRESS ONE OTHER THING. I THINK THE CONVERSATION -- WE HAD A SIMILAR CONVERSATION WELL, IT'S JUST PEOPLE SLEEPING IN BEDS. IT'S THE SAME THING AS RESIDENTIAL. THE MORE WE TALKED ABOUT IT, -- THAT'S SIMILAR TO SAY IF IT'S JUST PEOPLE SITTING AT THE TABLE VING DINNER,T'S NOT A RESTRANT. NOBODY ISIVINGHE AND ALL YOU YOU DO IS HAVE PEOPLE OVER FOR DINNER AND CHARGE THEM TO DO SO, THAT'S A COMMERCIAL USE. IF YOU DON'T ESTABLISH OCCUPANCY FOR A HOME, AND WE BELIEVE IT'S SIMILAR THAN IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN AND OUT OF A HOUSE NOR DINNER AND DON'T HAVE ANYBODY LIVING THERE PERMANENTLY, OR UNDER A TENANT RELATIONSHIP. WE HAD THA CONVEATION AS LL. I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
02:46:44.095: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT. I WOULD MAKE. ANY RESISTANCE IN HAVING STRs OR LIMITING THEM IN ANY WAY IS EVIDENCE OF OUR COMMUNITY BE INTOLERANT TORE V TO VISITOR ORE INTOLERANT TO US. PRESUMABLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VISITING HERE AND HAVE THE MEANS TO PAY FOR LODGING HERE, I MEAN WE ARE NOT A TOWN THAT IS UNWELCOMING TO VISITORS AND TO ME THERE'S NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO IS VISITING HERE OR STAYING IN AN STR AND HOL.ONE WHO IS STANG IN A THE FACT THAT WE'RE DISCRIMINATORY AND THERE'S SOME RACIAL CONNOTATION. I FIND THAT PUZZLING. WE WELCOME CROWDS AND CROWDS OF GUESTS FROM ALL OVER. HOW MANY TIMES A YEAR? AND THE IDEA THAT -- TO -- I JUST -- I -- IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. IT REALLY DOESN'T. I MEAN, THE HOUSING ISSUE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT WHO IS IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE WANT TO HAVE LIVE HERE. WE WANT -- WE WANT MORE HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE HERE AND GO TO SCHOOL HERE AND WORK HERE. THE FACT THAT HOUSING SUPPLY IS TAKEN AWAY BY THE PEOPLE WOULD WOD BE COMING HEREORHREE DAYS AT A TIME, THIS IS WHO HOTELS ARE FOR. THIS IS WHAT HOTELS ARE FOR AND LIKE I SAID, I STRONGLY SUPPORT RELYING ON THIS MAP AND OUR ZONING AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY HOPEFUL. ANK YOU.
02:48:24.695: >> Mayor Tlor: COUNCILMEMB LUMM.
02:48:25.629: >> Councilmember Lumm: THA YOU. MY LAST TIME. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. YOU TOUCHED ON SO MANY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL POINTS AND I'M GLAD I'M FOLLOWING YOU BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THIS THROUGH AND PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT. I APPRECIATE YOUR HELPFUL AND IMPORTANT CLARIFITION MR. DECOURT BECAU THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE AND MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT BANNING AND WHAT THIS MAY REPRESENT AND I THINK PRINCIPALLY, I -- AND I VERY MUCH AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS. I AGREE WITH HIM, AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, AND NCERN ABOUT RUCING PERMITTHE HOUSING STOCK. AND I HEAR THE CONCERNS. BUT I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS AT FIRST READING SO WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE. I THINK IT'S CRITICAL WE GO TO A SECOND READING AND HEAR FROM EVERYONE. SO THANK YOU.
02:49:36.800: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:49:38.936: >> Councilmember Ackerman: REMEMBERING THAT IT'S FIRST READING,  I WILL CONNECT WITH STAFF OFFLINE. I WILL ONLY BE ON COUNCIL FOR A LIMITED TIME MOVING FORWARD AND I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE PART OF IMPMENTING NEW RELATIONS THAT TREAT HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS DIFFERENTLY. AND SO I WOULD WANT TO EXTEND THESE REGULATIONS TO THE MIXED USE DISTRICTS BECAUSE, AGAIN, IF THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE WANT HOMEOWNERS TO LIVE NEXT TO WE SHOULDN'T WANT RENTERS TO LIVE NEXT TO IT 50 ETHER. IF IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'TANT THEMHEM TO TAK U HOUSING STOCK, WE SHOULDN'T WANT THIS HOUSING STOCK TO TAKE UP FOR POTENTIAL RENTERS. AND 55% OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE CITY RENT THEIR HOUSING. MAJORITY OF PEOPLE RENT THEIR HOUSING. THESE ARE YEAR-ROUND -- THESE ARE YEAR-ROUND RESIDENTS AS WELL, WHO DESERVE THAT REPRESENTATION. SO I WILL CONNECT WITH STA FLINE, AND HOPULLY IT DOESN'T CONSTITUTE A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE, BUT I WANTED TO GIVE PEOPLE A HEADS UP.
02:50:42.733: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:50:44.702: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST BRIEFLY, TWO THINGS. ONE, HAVE WE GIVEN ANY CONSIDERATION TO REQUIRING LIABILITY INSURANCE TO OPERATE A SHORT-TERM RENTAL? AND THE SECOND THING I WILL SAY BROADLY IS THAT I THINK IELPS FOR U TO EXAMINE -- GO BACK AND LOOK WHEN WE ASK STAFF TO COME UP WITH THIS, WHAT WERE OUR EXPLICIT POLICY OBJECTIVES FOR CONSIDERING REGULATION OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND I THINK WE NEED TO WEIGH CONSIDERATION OF THESE CHANGES AGAINST WHAT OUR POLICY OPTATIVES WERE. THANK YOU. -- POLI OECTIVES WERE. THANK YOU.
02:51:21.839: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I WILL VOTE YES THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT'S FIRST READING. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETING INTERESTS ON THIS. I AM MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST WITH RESPECT TO -- THE IMPACT OF THE USE WITH RESPECT TO AFFORDABILITY AND SO WE'LL LITTLE MORE INFORMATION TO BUTTRESS THAT BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS IS A -- I'M GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS SUBJECT AND THAT'S WHY I'M VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS FIRST READING. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:51:58.375: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I DO HAVE SOME -- I WANT TO ASK AFF. YOU KW, WE HRD CONCERNS FROM PEOPLE IN -- ON THE -- YOU KNOW, ON THE STR SIDE THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH STAFF AND WORK OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. MAYBE WE -- YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE IS A WAY TO CLARIFY ABOUT 30 DAYS OR, YOU KNOW, GET SOME THINGS. SOES, MR. DELACOURT, I WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU BEFORE I VOTED.
02:52:29.907: >> WE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STR OWNERS DURING THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. WE HAVE ALSO SAT DOWN WITH ANYBODY WHO HAS REQUESTED A MEETING FOR US. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST ONE OR TWO, BUT NEIGHBOR WHO IS -- ANYBODY WHO REACHED OUT TO US AND ASKED US TO MEET,ND DISCS IT, WE HAVE BEEN GLAD TO DO SO. LIKE I SAID, WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK WE HAVEN'T HEARD A SINGLE POINT OF VIEW ON AT THIS POINT. IF WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND REVISIT WITH VOKES, I WOULD ASK FOR SOME- YOU KW,OMEERY SPECIFIC DIRECTION ON WHAT  IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR, BECAUSE I THINK AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE HEARD FROM MOST IF NOT ALL THE VOICES. WE HEARD THEM ALL. I KNOW SOME OF US ARE FRUSTRATED THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THEIR CONCERNS BUT I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE LISTENED AND HEAR FROM ERYBODYND WE WILL CONTINUE THAT BETWEEN NOW AND SECOND READING.
02:53:37.408: >> Councilmember Grand: AND ALSO FROM STAFF, YOU KNOW, SEEING THAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO GO FORWARD, MAYBE JUST CONTINUE TO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION ON THE -- ON THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE OF THIS, SED ON THE CIMS W HEA THIS EVENING.

AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT'S A -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MINORITY CANDIDATES AND -- AND ANY CANDIDATES AND WOMEN AS THE MODIFIED ROONEY RULE NOW STANDS IN THE NFL. I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM A RESIDENT EARLIER WHO MENTIONED THAT THERE'S -- IN LEGAL CIRCLES THERE'S SOMETHING SIMILAR CALLED A MANS FIELD RULE THAT GOES EVEN FURTHER AND SO I HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT THAT ONE. I'M NOT A LEGAL SCHOLAR, AND I'M NOT A FOOTBALLAN EITHE I REAY HOPE WHEN IT' WRITTEN BY OUR ADMINISTRATOR, IT CASTS THE WIDEST NET FOR THE TYPES OF FOLKS THAT WE WANT TO INTERVIEW FOR THE CRITICAL POSITIONS IN THE CITY. THANK YOU.
03:11:30.913: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT ISPPROVED. DC-5, RESOLUTION AFFIRMING WASHTENAW COUNTY RESOLUTION DECLARING RACISM AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN WASHTENAW COUNTY. MOVED BY GRISWOLD, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION OF DC-5. COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:11:59.909: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I TNKT'SMPORTANT TT WE SUPRT THE COUNTYOMMISSION AND THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND I'M PROUD TO BRING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO STATE THE OBVIOUS IN TERMS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY AND BIRTH RATES. WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THAT, UTILITY-RELATED I WANT TO READ THE LATEST STATISTICS AS OF COVID PANDEMIC. 33% OF WASHTENAW'S TOTAL CASES AND 41% OF HOSPITALIZATIONS HAVE BEEN IN BLACK RESIDENTS, THOUGH THEY MAKE ONLY 12% OF WASHTENAW'S POPULATION. IT IS OBVIOUSLY THAT THERE AREC, DISPARITIES. MANY OF OUR MINORITIES ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THEY ARE OUT THERE ON THE FRONT LINES RIGHT NOW AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THISIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE . THANK YOU.
03:13:11.480: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:13:12.481: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE CONSIDER GOING AWON ALONG WITH E COUNTY RESOLUTION TO AFFIRM THIS COMMITMENT. I AGREE THAT IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, THAT RACISM IS A PUBLIC HLTH CRISIS AND I THINK POVERTY IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AND UNTIL WE ADDRESS BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES IN THE COUNTY, WE WON'T HAVE THE KIND OF OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT. AND, YOU KNOW, IN MANY WAYS, IT'S CLEAR THAT RACISM IS USED AS AHE TOOL TO KEEP PEOPLE APART, TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY REAZE THATHE REALHER PROBLEM IS POVERTY AND CLASS AND THE REAL PROBLEM IS GREEDY PEOPLE AND CAPITALISM REQUIRES RACISM AND IT REQUIRES POVERTY TO FUNCTION AT ITS MAXIMUM UTILITY. I HOPE WE CAN KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT I STRONGLY BELIEVE THESE TWO ARE STRONGLY INCLINEDND CLASSIVIDES AS MUCH ASACE HERE IN THE COUNTY AND I'M GLAD THAT THE COUNTY COMMISSION BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND THAT WE WILL AFFIRM IT TONIGHT AND I WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT POVERTY THAT KEEPS EVERYBODY DOWN.
03:14:31.427: >> Mayor Taylor: COMMISSIONER GRAND.
03:14:32.495: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WILL BE OBVIOUSLY SUPPORTING WE'RE RELY MAKING ANUT THAT AFFIRMATION OF WHAT THE COUNTY IS DOING. WHAT IMPRESSED ME SO MUCH ABOUT THE COUNTY RESOLUTION, AND I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH COMMISSIONER BRAY BACK ABOUT IT, THEY PUT A LOT OF TEETH AND ACTION INTO IT, SO IT WAS NOT JUST SAYING,ES, WE AFFIRM THAT RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BUT THEY PUT GOALS IN TERMS OF BUDGETS AND ALLOCATIONS AND HOW THEY COULD BEGIN TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT WAYS THAT THEY SPEND MONEY THIN IT' CLEAR THAHERE'S AAND I T OF EVIDENC OUT THERE THAT REGARDLESS OF THE INTERSECTIONALLITY OF A LOT OF THESE ISSUES LIKE POVERTY THAT THERE ARE INTERJENNERRATIONAL IL IMPACTS OF RACISM AND I'M HAPPY TO DOHIS, B I ALSO TNKS CONTINUE TO HOPEFULLY LOOK THROUGH OUR POLICIES WITH AN EQUITY LENS THAT WE THINK ABOUT -- ABOUT RACISM AND OTHER -- WELL, INCLUDING RACISM AND -- IN THAT LENS AND THAT BUDGETING BECAUSE I THINK WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE COUNTS RESOLUTION IS THAT ITEALLY DOES AFFIRM THAT THAT BUDGETS ARE MORAL DOCUMENTS AND IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS STRUCTURAL RACISM AND THIS -- AND RACISM AS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, YOU HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY BEHIND IT.
03:16:16.932: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND -- I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:16:19.568: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE WASHTENAW COUNTY BRD OF COMMISSIONERS AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FOR BRINGING THIS REGARD AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR.
03:16:45.094: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WOULDIKE TO THA THE COUNT FOR TAKING A LD ON THIS AND I'M HAPPY THAT WE AS A BODY IS MOVING IT FORWARD. THAT BEING SAID, AND HERE IN AREA CONTEXT, OF COURSE, STRUCTURAL RACISM HAS CREATED SO MUCH, YOU KNOW PAIN AND DEVASTATION IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT IS WELL AND TRULY A PUBC HEALTH CRISIS AND IT' RIGHT AND PROPERTY THAT WE SAY SO AND WE DO OUR PART TO COUNTERACT IT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-6, RESOLUTION TO ORDER ELECTION AND TO DETERMINE BALLOT QUESTION FOR CHARTER AMENDMENFOR THE 2021 AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, FOR DC-7. HE WANT TO -- FOR MYSELF -- PARDON ME, D6. AT T RISKFTEALING SOM OF COUNCILMEMBER SMITH'S THUNDER, I WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BACKGROUND ON THIS. YOU KNOW, THE NOTION OF A HOUSING MILLAGE HAS BEEN BANDIED AROUND FOR QUITE SOMETIME AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BE PART OF STRIVING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, BUT I THINK TT T - IT IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE -- THE REAL LEAD WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE HERE BY THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE. THEY HAVE DONE THE POLLING WORK THAT THEY HAVE -- YOU KNOW, CONTRIBUTED TO US. THEY HAVE DONE THE VISIONING ON THIS. THEY TALKED IT OVER WITH THE COMMUNITY AND PROVIDERS BEFOHAND. AND THEN THEY BROUGHT IT FORWARD AS A TOPIC THAT IS RIGHT BEFORE THE -- RIPE FOR OUR WORK. YOU KNOW, I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER SMITH WHO TOOK THE LEAD ON DRAFTING THE BALL MEASURE AND TN WORKED ON WITH MYSF AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. I THINK WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT SUFFERED FROM THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE STAKES ARE INCREDIBLY HIGH. ALTHOUGH WE ARE A WELCOMING COMMUNITY, WE -- AS WE ALL KNOW, WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DEVES FRO YOU KNOW,Y AND THAT PIDDLELESS DISGRACEFUL REDLINING AND THE SOLUTION TO THAT IS THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF NEW PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGHOUT ANN ARBOR AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET THOSE THINGS UNLESS THERE IS MUNICIPAL MONEY HIND IT. AND THE WAYO ACHIE MUNICIPAL MONEY IS THROUGH A MILLAGE AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BRING IT FORWARD, YOU KNOW, TEACHES, NURSES, OFFICE WORKERS, TRADES PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, RESTAURANT STAFF, RETAIL EMPLOYEES LIKE THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO WORK IN ANN ARBOR AND THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO LIVE HERE AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO NOW BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF HOUSING. THIS MILLAGE PROPOL, I TNK IS GOING TO BE, I HOPE PASSES AND GOES BEFORE THE VOTERS. IF IT GOES BEFORE THE VOTERS I'M CONFIDENT IT WILL BE PASSED AND I'M CONFIDENT WE AND OUR SUCCESSOR COUNCILS WILL USE THAT MONEY TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE OUR COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT IS WELL AND GOOD A IS FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
03:20:31.186: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. A COUPLE OF THINGS IS I APPRECIATE STAFF AND ALL THE HELP THEY HAVE GIVEN US IN TRYING TO TWEAK THIS LANGUAGE. IT'S TAKEN AN AWFUL LOT OF US TO GET THIS TO THE POINT THAT IT IS. MS. BEAUDRY, COULD YOU FORWARD THE AMENDMENT I PROVIDED. IN DISCUSSING THIS WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON OVER THE WEEKEND, I'M PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THI WHICH WOULD MAKE ONE CHANGEO THE CHARTER SECTION OF THIS. THAT IS THANK YOU, JACKIE. SECTION 8.25 IS ADDING A CLAUSE TO THE LAST SENTENCE, MAKING THAT READ -- ADDING THE PHRASE AND PROVIDING SOCIAL SERVICES NOTO EO EXCEED 25% OF THE MILLAE REVENUES OF SUCH HOUSING. THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WAS HAD TO TALK ABOUT HOW SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE TO KEEP THEM IN THESE HOUSES AND TRE'SECESSARY EXIBILITY TOROVIDE SOME OF THAT, BUT THA YOU MR. CRAWFORD FOR SUGGESTING THAT LANGUAGE. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT AS THE NEW LANGUAGE IF I HAVE A SECOND.
03:22:05.347: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON S. THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? NOT FRIENDLY. TAYNER, ACKERMAN AND RAMLAWI IN THE QUEUE. I WILL CLEAR THAT QUEUE AND MOVE TO THE AMENDMENT. COUNCIL MEMBER SMITH, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR, WITH RESPECT TO THE AMENDME. Councilmemb SmithE INTEION OF THISS TO BUILD, ACQUIRE, MAYBE TAKEN UNITS, SOME OF THE VERY LOW-INCOME UNITS AS MS. HALL CAN ATTEST REQUIRE SERVICES TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THOSE UNITS. AND I THINK WE WANTED TO PROVIDE IS FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT, BUT HAVE THE BULK OF THIS MILLAGE GO TOWARDS MAKING HOUSING AVAILABLE.
03:23:01.470: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTHers DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:23:04.773: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THOSE WOULD BROUGHT THIS TO COUNCIL. FORTUNATELY, MANY OF THEM COULD NOT WEIGH IN ON THIS UNTIL FRIDAY OR LATER. WE DIDN'T HAVE AVAILABILITY ON THISEING ABLE TO WORKITH O COLLEAGUES ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT MATTER AND A MATTER THAT COMES UP ON EVERY CONTINENT AND EVERY COUNCIL MEETING THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOES NOT ESCAPE ONE COUNCIL MEETING. AND SO I'M EXTREMELY D DISAPPOINTED FOR OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS NOT BEING ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS AND THIS WAS PUT ON THE AGENDA IN THE 11 11th HOUR. I WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH STAFF OVER THE WEEKEND AND THIS MORNING AND I ALSO HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE TONIGHT. AND ONE OF THEM, DEALS WITH THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE HERE BUT STAFF HAS PREPARED US AN AMENDMENT TO INTRODUCE TONIGHT TO REDUCE THIS AMOUNT FROM 25 TO 20%:  I FEEL THAT -- AND I'M SORRY, YOU CAN C ME OFF ANY TIME, MAYORAYLOR. I'M IN UNCHARTERED WATERS HERE IN HOW TO INTRODUCE A SECOND AMENDMENT TO THIS AMENDMENT IF IT'S PERMESSIBLE AT THIS POINT.
03:24:37.699: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU WANT TO AMEND THE 25 TO 20?
03:24:41.236: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S CORRECT.
03:24:42.938: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S AN AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. IS THE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:24:54.516: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE SPIRIT AND THE INTENT OF THIS MILLAGE IS TO BUILD HOMES AND TO MAINTAIN THOSE HOMES AND THE BRICK AND MORTAR ASPECTS. IN THIS PERCENTILE, 60% ANDE LOWER OFTEN NEED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO INCLUDE IT. BUT I WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING THE HOMES AND NOT NECESSARILY RELY ON THIS MILLAGE MON TO PRODE SERVICED THAT ARE PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO PUT PEOPLE INTO HOMES AND BUILD AS MANY MANY UNITS AS POSSIBLE AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE AS MANY HOMES BUILT AS POSSIBLE WITH THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE NEED FOR SUPPORTIV SERVIS AND I FEEL THAT 20% SHOULD GIVE US BOTH BUT, OF COURSE THESE ARE ARBITRARY NUMBERS THAT WE ARE PULLING OUT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF JENNIFER HALL IS HERE CAN EXPLAIN WHETHER IT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT OR IF THERE'S CONCERNS WITH ANY OF THESE AMENDMENTS. ARE THERE ANY STAFF MEMBERS TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT IS NECESSARY.
03:26:28.543: >> Clerk Beaudry: WAS THERE A SECOND TO T AMEMENT OF THE AMENDMENT.
03:26:39.054: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, I THOUGHT. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:26:43.125: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WHAT IS THE DOLLAR NUMBER?
03:26:46.461: >> Mayor Taylor: 25 TO 20.
03:26:49.097: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WHAT IS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THAT 5%.
03:26:53.902: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S 8 MILLION.
03:26:54.770: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OVER 20 YEARS? WHAT IS THE ANNUAL?
03:26:58.340: >> Couilmember Lumm: YES, OF 50 MILLION. SO 25%, 38, SORRY TO CHIME IN.
03:27:15.157: >> City Admin. Crawford: $325,00 0.
03:27:17.159: >> Mayor Taylor: $325,000.
03:27:17.726: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. YEAH, I WL HAVE TO TURN TO STAFF TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THIS POPULATION'S PROJECTED NEED IS AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT $325,000 IS. MS. HALL, WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT?
03:27:32.541: >> YES, ABSOLUTELY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAPITAL FUNDING AND SERVICE FUNDING IS THE CAPITAL FUNDING IS UPLOAD IN THE THE FRO END OF THE PROCESS, AND SO WHEN YOU ALLOCATE FUNDING TO THE PROJECT FOR CAPITAL, IT IS SPENT QUICKLY AND UP FRONT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT, WHEREAS SERVICES, YOU DO NEED AS A -- ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MENTIONED IN THE PUBLIC SPEAKING TIME, IF YOU ARE DOING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS AND SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSEHOLDS, DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COMMITMENT FOR 15 YEARS OF SERVICES BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY IT OUT UP FRONT. YOU COULD ALSO JUST ALLOCATE IT YEAR-BY-YEAR AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THE MILLAGE MONEY COMES IN, IT WILL NATURALLY, ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING BE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOCAPITAL ANDRADUALLY INCREASE AS Y GET FARTHER DOWN THE YEARS TO HAVE MORE AND MORE SERVICE DOLLARS AS YOU HAVE MORE PROJECTS COME ONLINE. I DON'T THINK THAT 20% OR 25% IS A BARRIER AS LONG AS WE CAN USE FUNDING FOR SERVICES. I DO THINK AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, THIS WILL HAVE TO BE A WHOLE PRETTY DISCUSSION AND GOING AFTER THE BUILDINGS ARE BUILT.
03:28:54.589: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON 25 TO 20.
03:29:00.795: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL PASS.
03:29:04.032: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:29:04.933: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SORRY, I WILL JUST SAY IF EITHER NUMBER WORKS, THERE MAY BE A TRAMENT STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IF -- A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IF VOTERS MAY BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THAT.
03:29:21.917: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE, ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT, 25 TO 20.
03:29:27.989: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE ARE VOTING ON WHETHER IT WILL BE 20T THIS POINT?
03:29:32.494: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. 25 TO 20, THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU OFFERED.
03:29:38.667: >> Councilmember Grand: ALL RIGHT.
03:29:39.834: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A QUESTION.
03:29:41.636: >> Councilmember Grand: I'M VOTING NO BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY AND I THINK 25 GIVES US MORE OF THAT.
03:29:54.316: >> Mor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE.
03:29:56.384: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
03:29:56.985: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:29:59.688: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:30:00.388: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:30:00.989: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:30:04.693: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:30:05.293: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
03:30:08.229: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:30:11.032: >> Councilmember Bannister: YE
03:30:16.838: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:30:19.407: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:30:20.075: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:30:21.643: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT, THAT IS PUTTING A CAP OF 20% ON THE SERVICES. IS THAT NOW FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. EXCELLENT. FURTHER DISCUSSI OF THE MAI MOTI AS AMENDED I HA HAYNER, ACKERMAN, RAMLAWI ON THE MAIN MOTION, AND THEN I WILL POP BACK INTO THE QUEUE, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IF I MAY.
03:30:49.838: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAJOR. I HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS A PAGE LONG, BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED IT SEEMED LIKE CEPT F COUIL. A LOOK AT TS, WE HAD AN EPIC MRA POLL AND WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE, EVERYONE GOT TO HOOK AT THIS BEFORE WE DID. AND NOT COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE, AND UNUSUAL. THE -- WE HAVE HEARD MUCH ABOUT THE SERVICE INDUSTRY-TYPE FOLKS WOULD WANTOIVEERE ANDORK HERE, O DO WORK HE BUT CAN AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. I MEAN, I HAVE -- I HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE VAGUENESS OF THIS BALLOT MEASURE. IT DOESN'T REALLY -- I MEAN IF I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY, AND I MEAN THESE ARE ALL QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE ASKED THESE QUESTIONS HAD I HAD THESE BEFORE ME IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHO RECEIVES THESEUNDS? ARE ESEENERAL FUND FUNDS THAT ARE COMING TO US? ANYBODY WANT TO ANSWER THAT? IS THIS JUST A GENERAL FUND?
03:31:53.034: >> City Admin. Crawford: AS A MILLAGE, WE WOULD PUT ALL THE PROCEEDS INTO A SPECIAL MILLAGE -- A SPECIAL REVENUE FUND FOR AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE. SO ALL THE FUNDS WOULD BE GOING TRANSPARCY, WE COULD SHOW AND LATER ON DESCRIBE HOW -- WHERE ALL THE MONIES WENT.
03:32:09.384: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SINCE THIS IS 60% AMI AND LESS, I ASSUME THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE DEDICATING AND I ASSUME THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE DEDICATED TO THE -- CREATING THE BUDGET FOR DISBURSING THESE FUNDS; IS THAT CRECT? TH THIS WILBE DEDICATED FOR THE -- THE BUDGETING COMES THROUGH THE HOUSING COMMISSION OR THE CITY COUNCIL.
03:32:36.578: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT WOULD DESCRIBE EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE USED. YOU COULD HAVE A NUMBER OF GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES.
03:32:44.519: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THE USE BEFORE US TONHTOO?
03:32:47.622: >>O.
03:32:47.856: >> Cncilmemb Hner:  SO WE ARE TALKI ABOUT PUTNG THIS ON THE BALLOT WITHOUT DEFINING THE USE?
03:32:52.560: >> Councilmember Smith: THE USE WILL BE DEFINED -- WE WILL BRING THAT FORWARD AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE TO GET THIS ON THE BALLOT.
03:33:03.404: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU MEAN IT COULDN'T BE POSTPONED TO THE XT MEETI TOET THE U.
03:33:11.346: >> Councilmember Smith: IT'S SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND IT GIVES US LITTLE TIME TO TURN AROUND AND MAKE ANY CHANGES. IF THIS IS TO BE POSTPONED, I WOULD SUGGEST WE HAVE A SPECIAL MEETING NEXT MONDAY NIGHT TO ADDRESS IT SPECIFICALLY.
03:33:26.127: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I CERTAINLY HAVE MORE THAN THREE MINUTES WORTH OF Q&A HERE ABOUT I'M -- I CAN'T SPEAK TO EVERYONE'S SCHEDULES BUT I WOULD CONSIDER POSTPONING IT SO I CAN GET MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED. I JUST THINK IT'S A LITTLE -- IT'S PRETTY VAGUE RIGHT NOW, TO BE HONEST. HERE'S THE TYPICAL CONCERN. IF THIS IS USED TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE WALPESIDENT OR IT HAS TO BE DISPERSED THROUGH THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION? SO THE SERVICE INDUSTRY FOLKS AS AN EXAMPLE, WOULD WANT TO LIVE HERE, ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE TO APPLY JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE WOULD FOR ACCESS TO THIS HOUSING? THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I HAVE FOR THE FUTURE. I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT, YOU KNOW, 60% OF AMI AND IE A -- YOU KN, YOU ARE ASKINGEOPLE WHO, YOU KNOW, FAMILIES, PERHAPS LIKE MINE WHO EARN 60% OR LESS OF AMI, TO FUND OTHER FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY FOR THIS, WHO MAY EVEN EARN MORE THAN A FAMILY WHO IS MAKING 55 OR 50 OR WHATEVER THE PERCENTAGE OF AMI IS. AND I FIND THAT KIND OF TROUBLESOME THATE ARE GOING TO TAEVERYBY AND RAISE EVERYBODY'S TAXES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET THEMSELVES IN THE QUEUE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF TYPES OF FOLKS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I KNOW THERE'S A NEED AT ALL LEVELS. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THIS -- WITHOUT HAVING A USE LANGUAGE THAT O GIVES ME ANY CONDENCE THATE ARE JUST NOT CREATING $150 MILLION FUND THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE IF WE HAVE A PARTNER LIKE AVALON WHO HAS PURCHASED PROPERTIES OVER THE YEARS, CAN THEY COME TO US AND SAY, HEY, WE NEED $6 MILLION TO RENOVATE ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES AND THEN THE TAXPAYER IS BUILDING THE EQUITY OF AVALON'S HOLDINGS BECAUSE WE USED THE MILLAGE MONEY. IT SAYS WE CAN USE IT FOR MAINTENANCE AND I UNDERSTAND ONGOING MATEN IN AND I UNDERSTAND ACQUIRING A PROPERTY AND HAVING TO MAINTAIN IT, TO BRING IT UP TO A STANDARD THAT IT QUALIFIES FOR A H.U.D. PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAV MAINTENCE IN THIS WHERE WE GOACK A FIX UP A BUNCH OF PROPERTIES THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PURCHASED AND ARE PART OF THIS SYSTEM, YOU KNOW, UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. AND I GUESS MY POINT BEING THAT I'M ON THIS COUNCIL AND I DON'T TRUST THIS COUNCIL WITH SPENDING DECISIONS LIKE THIS. THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN. LOOK AT WHAT WE DID WITH THE MENTAL HEALT MLAGE. WE HAVE A NONBINDING AGREEMENT OFOW WE ARE GOING TO USE IT THAT GETS STRUGGLED WITH YEAR AFTER YEAR. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE VAGARIES OF THIS MILLAGE LANGUAGE.
03:36:15.630: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:36:17.432: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH. I HAVE A FEW MORE AMENDMENTS, I WOULD LIKE TO BRING FORTH, IF IT'S OKAY WITH THODY. I NT AN EMAIL TO MS. BEAUDRY WITH A LIST OF THEM. WE ALREADY TOOK CARE OF ONE. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE OTHER THREE. I DON'T KNOW IF MS. BEAUDRY WILL SEND OFF ONE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE FORMAT, BUT IT WLD BE ATHER AMEMENT AND --
03:36:50.631: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, SORRY. WE VOTED ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT, BUT WE DIDN'T VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT.
03:36:56.838: >> Mayor Taylor: IT WAS FRIENDLY.
03:36:58.439: >> Clerk Beaudry: WITH THE 20%?
03:37:00.241: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
03:37:01.042: >> Clerk Beaudry: OKAY. THANK YOU.
03:37:10.385: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE BODY, I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD AMENDMENT FOUR IN THE LIST OF AMENDMENTS AND THAT'S TO ADD A SIXTH WHEREAS CLAUSE, WHEREAS IT IS THE CITY'S INTENTION, IT WILL CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE GENERAL FUND MONEY TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSG FUND REGDLESS OF ANY ADDITIONAL MILLAGE MONEY. I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO DOUBLE DOWN ON OUR COMMITMENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T -- DO CURRENT FUNDING WITH THIS MILLAGE, THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE DECISION TO WHAT WE CURRENTLY CONTRIBUTE TO T AFFORDABLE HOUSINGUND.
03:37:55.696: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THIS A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? IS THAT A YES OR NO, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:38:12.146: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD THER THAN A WHEREAS CLAUSE YOU I CANMAKE IT A RESOLVE CLAUSE.
03:38:22.056: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APOLOGIZE. THAT'S A GREAT POINT, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. THAT PUTS SOME TEETH IN IT. I WOULD MOVE TO HAVE IT AS A RESOLVE CLAUSE AND NOT A WHEREAS CLAUSE. I APOGIZE.
03:38:35.503: >> Mayorayr: IS THAT A FRIENDLYMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT?
03:38:40.108: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NUMBER FOUR?
03:38:45.179: >> Mayor Taylor: NUMBER FOUR?
03:38:54.188: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:38:55.456: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT REALS:
03:38:57.925: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:39:02.330: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S NOT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
03:39:04.999: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I WILL LEAVE IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES TO TALK ABOUT THIS LAST AMENDMENT.
03:39:13.508: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:39:14.775: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING $6 TO $8 MILLION A YEAR OUT OF THCOUNITY AND IN SUBSTITUTION IN MY MIND, OF THE COMMITMENTS WE ALREADY MADE WHICH PALE IN COMPARISON TO THIS DOLLAR A.M. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S NECESSARY TO CONTINUE TO BUDGET FOR BOTH. I THINK THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES -- THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COMMUNITY AND NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE GENERAL FUND MONEY OR MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE REBATE MONEY OR WHATEVER IT IS, THO ARE THE SAME, COULD BE USED IN A MANNER THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED FOR OUTSIDE SOCIAL SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE BIG DEMANDS FOR WHAT WOULD BE CALLED EMERGENCY SERVICES OR CALLS TO SERVICE FOR SOME OF OUR HOUSING COMMISSION PROPERTIES AND I THINK THAT THOSE MIGHT BE -- YOU KNOW, THAT -- TT RT OF THING. THATONEYOULD BE BETTER MMENT ON THAT. YOU KNOW, DEALING WITH THOSE ISSUES AND I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS. I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TEN TIMES, A TENFOLD INCREASE ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE ARE SPENDING. HOW MUCH DO WE NEED? I DON'T SUPPORT THAT RESOLUTN.
03:40:25.012: >> Mayor Taylo FURTHER SCUSSION OFHE AMENDMENT AS AMENDE I HAVE GRISWOLD AND THEN LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:40:30.851: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I THINK LUMM WAS BEFORE ME.
03:40:34.188: >> Mayor Taylor: HMM. NOT ACCORDING TO THE RAISED HAND BUT OKAY.
03:40:37.858: >> Councilmember Griswold: WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:40:40.995: >> Councilmember Lumm: GO AHEAD.
03:40:41.662: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS MILLAGE COME FORWARD WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBILITY OF PASSING. AND WE ARE OFF TO A TERRIBLE START RIGHT NOW AND I SAY THAT BASED ON BEING ON THE PREVAILING STARTING IN 2001, WITH THE BONDS TO EXPAND HURON AND PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH FORTUNATELY FAILED. IF WE ARE COMMITTED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO A SUCCESSFUL MILLAGE, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE A WORKING SESSION AND A MEETING, A SPECI MEETING NEXT MONDAYIGHT, WHILE A TREMENDOUS OUNT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES, WE HAVEN'T BROUGHT THE PUBLIC ALONG. WE HAVEN'T BROUGHT COUNCILMEMBERS ALONG. AND WE NEED TO DO THAT TO ESTABLISH A FIRM FTING TO GO OUTHERE AND PRESENT THIS MILLAGE TO THE PUBLIC. WE CANNOT HAVE THE KIND OF DISCUSSION WE ARE HAVING TONIGHT AND EXPECT THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE CONFIDENCE IN US, AND THAT'S WHY I RECOMMEND THAT WE MEET AGAIN NEXT MONDAY NIGHT WHEN WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION WHEN WE HAD A CHANCE TODUCATEHE PUBLI AND WE CAN HAVE AN EXCELLENT BUY-IN THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN.
03:42:26.834: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:42:28.402: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL RESPOND TO THAT WITH A QUESTION TO STAFF. I GUESS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. FIRST, WOULD THIS  [ GARED AUDIO ] BE ABLE TO DEVELOP -- USUALLY WHEN WE BRING FORWARD A MILLAGE PROPOSAL, THERE'S A RESOLUTION OF INTENT ON THE USE OF THE FUNDS AND I THINK THAT'S A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS, THAT NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED. COULD THAT BE DEVELOPED FOR THE SPECIAL NEATING. MAYBE THIS COULD BE DEVELOPED MORE THOROUGHLY AND VOTE ON THIS AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING. I DON'T SEE MR.  -- YES, THERE HE IS. MR. POSTEMA, I I JUSON'T S YOUR FE.
03:43:21.555: >> City Atty. Postema: I AM HERE. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM --
03:43:27.795: >> Councilmember Lumm: SORRY. SO THE USE, IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT, AND THEN ALSO IF YOU WOULD SPEAK TO THE -- BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE TIMING. IF YOU COULD CLARIFY ONHAT. MBERIGHT BEFORE YOU ON MYLME SCREEN IS MR. THOMAS WHO HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND SENT YOU INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. AND I WILL ASK HIM TO TALK FIRST ABOUT THE TIMING ISSUE.
03:43:53.354: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
03:43:54.221: >> THE TIMING OF IT IS ESSENTIALLY THAT WE NEED THE FINAL LANGUAGE CERTIFIED TO THE CLERK BY THE 12th TUESDAY BEFORE THE ELEION. JACKIE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THIS WOULD BE AUGUST 11th. SO WHAT THE RESOLUTION WILL DO IS DIRECT JACKIE SO SEND IT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR HIS REVIEW -- FOR HER REVIEW. AND WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL EITHER GIVES IT A THUMBS UP OR A THUMBS DOWN AND THEN COUNCIL WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT ON HIS OR HER RECOMMENDATIONS WHERE YOU CAN OVERRIDE THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND VOTE TO PUT IT ON THE BALLOT REGARDLESS OR AMEND IT, BUT IN EITHER FORM, IT WOULD NEED TO BE IN THE FINAL FORM TO JACKIE BY AUST 11th. SO WE CAN'T -- WE CAN'T PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY HOW FAST IT WILL BE TURNED AROUND AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. , WHETHER IT WOULD BE SOME TIME TO DO SO.
03:44:59.753: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.

I'M TRYING TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION FROM THIS BODY. IT SEEMS LIKE THE BIG -- THE PARTHAT'S HOLD US UP IAVING A NONBINDING COUNCIL RESOLUTION, ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF USE. FOR THE MILLAGE FUNDS, HOW COUNCIL INTENDS TO SPEND THEM. IS THAT CORRECT? Mayor Taylo RIGHT NOWE HAVE AN AMENDNT ON THE FLOOR, WITH RESPECT TO ADD AGO APRIL ADDITIONAL RESOLVE CLAUSE.

IF THERE'S A DESIRE TO GET THIS I HEAR ENOUGH FROM THE GROUP THAT THERE'S A DESIRE TO HAVE MORE QUESTIONED ASKED THAT THAN WILL BE ANSWERED TONIGHT. MAY I SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE A SPECIAL -- THAT WE ADDRESS SOME AMENDMENTED THARE MAYBE RESOLVLE TONIGHT AND THEN WE POSTPONE UNTIL THE A SPECIAL MEETING TO BE HELD A WEEK FROM TODAY WHEN WE WOULD CONSIDER THE MATTER IT WOULD GIVE STAFF A FAIR MEASURE OF COMFORT THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE, TURN IT AROUND AND GET IT PACK TO US IN TIME FOR US TO CHANGE IT, IF WE NEEDED TO. IS THAT CORRECT? LET ME SUGGEST THAT THAT IS WHAT WE END UP DOING. THAT DOES NOT -- WE HAVE THIS AMENDMENT ANY OTHER AMENDMENT THAT COUNCILMEMBER WHES TO BRING, I HAVE ONE THAT -- TO TWEAK SOME LANGUAGE THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BY MR. McDONALD EARLIER THAT I THINK WILL BE FRIENDLY. LET'S CLEAN IT UP AND TAKE IT FROM THERE.
03:49:28.522: >> Councilmember Smith: SO WE ARE CURRENTLY LKINGT --

03:50:02.389: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO MAKE MYSELF CLEAR. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING BUT THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY CLARIFY ANYTHING FOR ME. WE KNOW THAT SAY, IN THE CASE OF TYPES OF DEVELOPNTS, THAT THEY KE THOSE CONIBUTIONS TO THE AAFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND. I'M NOT CONSIDERING IN ANY BAY THAT THAT WOULD END. YOU KNOW, LIKE A PUD, ARE OR VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE AFFORDAB HOUSING TRUST FUND. I DON'T TNK THIIS CLEAR THIS AMEMENT, IS IT MEANT THAT THERE WAS NO CONSIDER THAT WE STOP THAT TYPE OF SPENDING. SO WHY ARE WE CLARIFYING THAT WE DON'T STOP THAT, OR THE CONSTANT CONTRIBUTIONS? WE DON'T REALLY ARE YOU REFERRING  THOSE MADE BY PRATEEVELOPMENT OR THOSE MADE UNDER THE NONBINDING 40/40/20 PLEDGE OR WHAT?
03:51:11.725: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF I CAN RESPOND? I'M NOT SURE.
03:51:17.064: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
03:51:17.731: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S TO SIGNAL TO THEOTERS A OTR COMMUNITY OUR IENT IS NOT TO VACATE OUR CURRENT COMMITMENT TO FUNDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE KNOW THAT THE NEEDS ARE TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE.T WREGE E AGAIN, IT'S JUST A SIGNAL AND TO STRENGTHEN THIS BALLOT LANGUAGE AND THE INTENT. IT'S NOT LANGUAGE ON THE BALLOT, BUT IT GIVES THE -- THE COMMUNITY A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WENTEND TO DO WITH THIS AITIONAL MON. ITS NOT TO OUR WEREN'T COMMITMENTS BUT TO ADD TO IT. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE VAGUENESS BUT IT'S MORE OF SIGNALING OUR INTENT RATHER THAN BEING BEING FURTHER PRESCRIPTIVE AS YOU ARE WISHING FOR, BUT PERHAPS WE CAN SESSION.INHE OUR WORK LET ME SUGGEST THAT WE MOVE ON ON THIS AMENDMENT.
03:52:40.380: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WAS GOING TO ASK CONSIDERING THIS AMENDMENT AND ALL AMENDMENTS THE POSSIBILIT-- [ GARBLED AUDIO ] ON HOLD NOW, SO COUNCIL MEN NOW AND NEXT MONDAY, THE 27th, CAN SUBMIT QUESTIONS AND STAFF CAN PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND THAT WE HAVE HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY T THAT O THERE AS A POSSIBLE I SUGGESTION.

SITTING HERE, IT TRUST ME THAT WE ARE POSTPONINGO THAT WE CAN HAVE ME ROLUTION LANGUAGE ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD INTEND TO DO. WE ARE NOT REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE OF THE ACTUAL BALLOT LANGUAGE BUT WE ARE AS A POLICY MAKING BODY IS TRYING TO BETTER INFORM VOTS HOW WE WOULD SPEND THAT MIAGE SHOULD WE PASS IT. THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE AND WE HAD LOTS OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT THAT. SO I JUST -- WANTED TO POINT OUT NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WEREN'T SITTING OPEN THAT SIDE BEFORE AND NOW ARE THAT IS THERE IS A UTILITY IN WANTING TO EDUCATE VOTERS ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD SPEND MILLAGE FUND SULD THEY COME IN OUR HANDS FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE.

04:01:13.660: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION.
04:01:16.196: >> ME TOO!
04:01:18.465: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S DO THIS -- LET -- NEW IS USED ELSEWHERE IN THE MEASURE. LET'S -- THIS WAS LANGUAGE SUGGESTED BY MR. MONALD TO TACK BACK TO THEREVIOUS USAGE OF NEW. PERHAPS THIS WESTBOUND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. DOES NEW MEAN NEW CONSTRUCTION OR NEW TO THE CITY'S HOUSING STOCK?

BUT IT COULD BE THAT THE HOUSING IS CONSIDERED NOW MARKET RE HOUSING BU WE MAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN T FUTURE WHERE WE ACQUIRE SOMETHING THAT IS NOW MARKET RATE HOUSING AND IT -- WE'RE MAYBE STRUCKING OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. WE COULD ACQUIRE MARKET RATE PROPERTY AS AN EXAMPLE, AND CONVERT IT TO AFFORBLE HOUSING BEUSE WE CA AFFD TO DO SO. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS LANGUAGE LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE MARKET RATE HOUSING AND CONVERT IT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND HOW IF THAT WOULD LIMIT OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACQUISITION. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? I'M NOT A LEGAL SCHOLAR BUT --

04:11:16.695: >> Mayor Taylor: NO, NO, I WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. WHERE ARE WE, DC-7. RESOTION TO ENCOURAGE GOVERNOR TO OPTIMIZE MICHIGAN EXECUTIVE ORDER 2020-134 - EVICTION DIVERSION PROGRAM FOR COVID-19-RELATED DEBTORS AND RECONSIDER RESCISSION OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 2020-118. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION OF DC-7. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:11:40.252: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL TRY TO BE BEF. THANK YOU FOR ENTERTAINING THIS POLICY, AND ATING THIS TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT. BEFORE THE COVID PANDEMIC AFFECTED THE UNITED STATES. WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF AN EVICTION. IN THETATE OF MICHIGAN $17,000 EVICTIONS WERE ALREADY HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE MONTH. IF YOU LOOK NATIONALLY, THERE ARE NUMBERS THAT SAY THAT EVERY MINUTE FOUR HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEING EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS ONLY GOING T COMPOD AND GET A LOT,OT WORSE. IN THE MIDST OF THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT THAT'S OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE NECESSARY CLOSURES THAT HAVE HAPPENED AROUND THE STATE. SO TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THAT, THE GOVERNOR RIGHTLY IMPLEMEND MORORIUM OLL EVICTION HEARINGS SHE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO LANDLORDS COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH EVICTION PROCEEDINGS IN THOSE MONTHS. RECENTLY, THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS CHANGED THE DIRECTION OF THEIR POLICY, WHERE THEY WILL -- THE GOVERR HAS RESNDED THE MORATORIUM AND REPLACED IT WITH A DIVERSION PROGRAM AND THAT DIVERSION PROGRAM TAKES ADVANTAGE OF $60 MILLION FROM THE FEDERAL CARES ACT, AND WHAT IT DOES, ANY TIME A LANDLORD MOVESMOVES TO EVICT A TANT, THEY WILL GO TO THE COURT AND THEN THROUGH A PROGRAM THROUGH THE SUPREME COURT, IT WILL BE COVERED THROUGH THE POOL OF $60 MILLION THAT THE GOVERNs HAS SAVED OVER TIME. I UNDERSTAND THE WIN/WIN THAT THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO STRIKE, NOT ONLY ARE YOU ABLE TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING KICKED OUT OF THEIR HES BUT YOU ARE GETTINGASH IN TH HANDS OF LLANDLORDS BY COVERING THE BACK RENT. NOR FOR ANYONE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS, THEY HAVE TO BE EVICTED AND GO TO COURT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF EWILL VICTIMMION. AND IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW WHAT EXACTLY THE PROCESS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS VI EVICT. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ABSOLUTELY CANNOT AFFORD INTENSIVE PAPERWORK AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION RIGHT NOW. FOREMOST, LL THE GERNORAND CONSIDER CONTINUING THE MORATORIUM FOR CLEANER AND PROTECTS MORE PEOPLE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC BUT ALSO AGAIN, NATIONWIDE EVICTION EPIDEMIC THAT WAS ONGOING, BEFORE THE COVID CRISIS. AND THEN SECOND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOVERNOR WORKS DILIGENTLY WITH THE MICGAN SUEME COU, TO MAKE SLUR THAT ACCESS TO THE EVICTION DEVERSION PROGRAM IS ABSOLUTELY AS EASY AND STREAMLINED AS IT CAN BE. YOU KNOW, I THINK SOME IMPROVEMENTS AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROCESS PROVIDES SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE THAT EASIER FOR INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF THE CARE AND I HOP THAT SIMAR STREAMLINING CAN BE DONE TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED BECAUSE THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND EVERY STATE AROUND THE COUNTRY IN VERY SHORT ORDER COULD BE SEEING THE MASSIVE FLOOD OF HOMELESSNESS, WHICH WE WILL DO EVERYTHING AWE CAN TO PRENT.
04:15:41.393: >>ayor Taylor:OUNCILMEMBER HAYNER
04:15:42.795: >> Couilmember Hayne  I KNOW IT' JUST SORTF A POLIC REQUEST BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AND I'M SUPER -- I'M JUST -- I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT WE AS A CITY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY LIKE SOME CITIES IN OTHER STATES DO TO EXTEND THEIR OWN EVICTION MORATORIUM AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE OFITHHELD A LOT OFOWER FROMND THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND IT'S DISAPPOINTING BUT I -- I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO ASK HER TO CONTINUE TO EXTEND THIS EVICTION MORATORIUM AND THE OTHER GOALS OF MAKING IT EASY FOR -- HOW ARE YOU SO  SUPPOSEDO DO PAPERWORK WHEN YOU ARE OUT ON STRE. IT'S BACKWAR APPROACH AND $60 MILLION WILL GET PERSONNED THROUGH PRETTY QUICKLY AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET OUR FOLKS IN LANGUAGE SIN THAT THAT MORATORIUM NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT ALL THAT ULTIMATELY MAKES ITS WAY BACK TO THE BANK AS A MAE IT'S SOMETHINGHAT WE NEED TO REACH OUT INDIVIDUALLY AS COUNCILMEMBERS TO THE VARIOUS SUBCOMMITTEES UP THERE IN LANSING THAT HAVE SO MUCH CONTROL OVER THE BANKS AND ASK FOR SOME RELIEF ON THE BANKS' BEHALF TOO. THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
04:17:07.479: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YO WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THANK MR. CRAWFORD MR. FORNIER.

04:20:45.397: >> Councilmember Bannister: THE BTONOESN'T WORKO WELL. I THINK THE STAFF HAS CLARIFIED IN THE EMAILS BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE 25 RESIDENTS OUT THERE WHO WOULD LIKE A VERBAL CONFIRMATION WITH THE BARTON DRIVE, THE NIXON, TRAVER, AND JACKSON ROAD PROJECTS THA WE HAVE POSTPONED UNTIL DECEMBER, I WOULD LIKE MR. POSTEMA OR MR. CRAWFORD TO CONFIRM THAT THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IF IT BE PASSED TO THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER.
04:21:42.254: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE PROJECTS ARE NOT APPROVED AND APPROVED IS IN THE LANGUAGE AND SO THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE CONSIDERED AS A FUR PROJECT.
04:21:55.901: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
04:22:00.706: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:22:01.707: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. NOW, I THINK THEY WERE SCHEDULED TO CE BACK IN NOVEMBER WOULD THAT EXCLUDE THEM FROM THIS MILLAGE MONEY, IF THOSE PROJECTS WERE VOTED ON IN NOVEMBER?
04:22:31.937: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WILL ASK MR. HUPY OR M HUTCHINSON TO RESND. I CAN JP IN HERE. THIS I NICK HUTCHINSON, CITY ENGINEER. THOSE -- THOSE RESOLUTIONS WERE POSTPONED TO DECEMBER, ACTUALLY, NOT NOVEMBER. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF -- THAT THOSE PROJECTS WOULD ALL BE ELIGIBLE TO BE COVERED UNDER THIS MILLAGE AS IT'S ITTEN RIT NOW.
04:23:06.905: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION AND I APOLOGIZE, THE HE IS   11th HOUF IT, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ASKED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ONGOG PAYMENTS THAESIDENTSHE WILL BE MAKING. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR COUNCIL TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE ASSESSMENTS IF THIS MILLAGE WAS TO PASS INTO FORGOING COLLECTIONS ON ASSESSMENTS IN INTO EFFECT A BEYOND SO PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING TAXED AND PAYING FOR A MILLAGE THAT WAS -- YOU KNOW, PAYING FOR AN ASSESSMENT FROM A PRIOR YEAR AND ON TOP OF IT, THIS NEW MILLAGE. I AN, THI SEEMS TO BE DOUBLE DIPPING THERE IF THAT WAS TO BE THE CASE, AND I JUST WOULD LIKE SOME DIRECTION FROM STAFF ON WHAT'S LEGAL AND WHAT IS NOT LEGAL AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE PAYING ASSESSMENTS UNTIL 2028, AND YET WE'RE COLLE COLCTING ON IT. I UNDERSTAN I DESCRIBES PROJECTS THAT ARE APPROVED BUT AGAIN WOULD THERE BE ANY WAY FOR COUNCIL IN THE FUTURE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE? I DON'T KNOW IF MR. POSTEMA OR THE ATTORNEYS, YOU CAN GET BACK TO ME LATER ABOUT, IT BUT THAT'S AN ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE.
04:24:50.809: >> YES, IF I CAN JUMP IN HERE, COUNCILMEMBER, WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE ISSUE OF WHETHER TO MAKE RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS OUT OF THE MILLAGE MONEY. I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE GETTING AT, AND THERE WOULD BE SO DIFFICULTY WITH THAT. WE CAN FURTHER ADVISE YOU IN THE FURE ON TT, IF THAT'S SOTHING YOU WANTO PURSUE.
04:25:15.734: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, IT'S MORE ABOUT THE FORGIVENESS ON THOSE FUTURE PAYMENTS FROM PAST ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE ONGOING. BUTZ BU I CAN G TT ADVIC I GUESST A LATER POINT.
04:25:35.620: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:25:36.521: >> Councilmember Griswold:  IN ADDITION TO THE THREE NAMED PROJECTS, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT OTHER SIDEWALK PROJECTS ARE ON HOLD, INCLUDING STIMSON. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT CAN GO FORWARD THIS YEAR AND AT IS THE MAXIMUM ASSESSED VALUE FOR THE SIDEWALK ON STIMSON. IS THERE A REASON WE CAN'T PUT THAT IN THIS SUMMER? THAT'S A GENERAL FOR STAFF.
04:26:18.096: >> I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME OF WHAT WOULD BE THE NUMBERS TORE STIMSON.
04:26:23.468: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WAS THINKING IF THEY WERE UNDER $2,500 PER PROPERTY, THEN IT WOULDN'T MATTER WHETHER WE DID THIS YEAR OR DELAYED UNTIL AFTER THE MILLAGE POTENTIALLY PASSES.
04:26:42.420: >> I THINK THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MAY HAVE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS, BUT IT WOULD BE MY UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE WENT A BUILT IT THIS YEAR, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE UNDER THE CURRENT CITY CODE, WHICH MEANS WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS.
04:26:54.799: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M JUST THIING THAT ONE OF THE OPTIONS WAS TO SET A MAXIMUM ASSESSED PER PROPERTY OF $2,500 AND I WAS WONDERING IF THE ASSESSMENTS ARE LESS THAN $2,500, AND THEN IT WOULDN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER WE DID IT FINANCIAL STANDPOINT BUT FROM A PEDESTRIAN STANDPOINT THIS IS A CRITICAL SIDEWALK GAP.
04:27:29.701: >> I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK UP THE NUMBERS BUT I BELIEVE BASED ON MY MEMORY RIGHT NOW THAN THEY ARE GREATER THAN $2,500.
04:27:37.542: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. GREAT. I CAN GET BACK TO YOU OFFLINE. I WANTEDO MENTION SETHING TH I FOUND TODAYND THAT IS A COUNCIL RESOLUTION FROM OCTOBER 2nd, 1995, AND IT WAS A RESOLUTION TO SPEND $13,000 OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND TO FILL A SIDEWALK GAP, AND I WON'T MENTION WHERE IT IS. BUT -- SO THERE IS PRECEDENCE FOR DOING THIS. THANKS.
04:28:08.339: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOUR HAND WAS UP. DID YOU INTEND TO BRING IT DOWN?
04:28:12.010: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I LOWERED IT BECAUSE KATHY WAS ASKING THE QUESTIONS I WANTED ANSWERED. I GUESS I -- TAG ME ON WITH WHATEVER OFFLINE COMMUNICATION IS HAPPENING ABOUT STIMSON. I MEAN HAVING PASSED THROUGH THAT CORRIDOR A FEW TIMES -- MORE THAN A FEW TIMES, I WOULD BE SURPRISED HOW MANY -- HOW MUCH THE ASSESSMENTS WOULD BE. DO YOU KNOW -- I KNOW YOU ARE SAYING YOU GENERALLY REMEMBER IT'S PROBABLY OVER $2,500. DO YOU REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD H MANYROPERTIE WOUL BE ASSESSE FOR THAT PARTICULAR STRETCH THE SIDEWALK?
04:28:53.151: >> I BELIEVE IT'S THREE.
04:28:54.986: >> Councilmember Nelson: THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE TO ME.
04:28:59.524: >> AND THEN THE PROPERTY THAT'S OCCUPIED BY THE SALVATION ARMY ON THE SOUTH SIDE.
04:29:05.230: >> Councilmember Nelson:  ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
04:29:07.532: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? FOR MY PART, I'M PRETTY EXCITED THAT THIS IS GOING FOR YEARS. WE WANTED NO GROW OUR SIDEWALK NETWORK AND WE HAVEN'T HAD THE RESOURCES TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT, YOU KNOW, SIDEWALKS ARE AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE NON-MOTORIZED PLAN ANDILLING IN SIDEWAL GS IS IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFIT, AND QUALITY OF LIFE BENEFIT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VOTERS PASS THIS MILLAGE AND WE ARE FILL IN THE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT WILL BE PRETTY COOL. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:30:02.820: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WANTED ASK STAFF, THE MONEY COMES FROM THE STREET AND BRIDGE MILLAGE, AND IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF SIDEWALK MILLAGE WAS T PASS, THAT WLD ACTUALLY FREE UP THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS COMING FROM THAT OTHER MILLAGE AND PERHAPS PUT MORE MONEY BACK INTO THE STREETS AND BRIDGES. CAN WE GET CLARIFICATION IF THAT IS THE CASE AND --
04:30:30.381: >> YES, THAT IS INDEED THE CASE.
04:30:34.252: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO AS WL.OULD HAVE A BENEFIT THERE
04:30:40.992: >> City Admin. Crawford: I BELIEVE HE WAS ASKING IF THE STREET FOR THE SIDEWALK IS INSTALLING NEW SIDEWALKS VERSUS REPAIRS I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT NEW SIDEWALKS PERFECT PRIVATE PROPERTIES WOULD BE COMING FROM THERE. I WAS THINKING THAT WAS THE GENERAL FUND.
04:30:58.943: >> CURNTLY, THE EXISTING STREET BRIDGE AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE CAN PAY FOR PORTIONS OF NEW SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE NOT OTHERWISE ACCESSIBLE. SO IF THE NOW SIDEWALK MILGE WODHANG THAT WOULD FREE UP RE MONEY FROM THE STREET MILLAGE.
04:31:31.709: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:31:33.077: >> Councilmember Lumm: A QUESTION FOR YOU, MR. HUTCHINSON. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STREET, BRIDGE AND THE SIDEWALK PORTIOWAS FOR REPAIRSND NOT NEW CONSTRUCTION. DID WE EVER CHANGE THE LANGUAGE. IT'S NOT BEING CHANGED IN WHAT WE JUST APPROVED.
04:31:54.499: >> THE LANGUAGE AND WHAT WAS JUST APPROVED IS THE SAME LANGUAGE AS IT WAS IN 2016 ESSENTIALL THE LY THING WE CHANG IN THERE IS IF THE NEW SIDEWALK MILLAGE PASSES, THEN WE WOULD NO LONGER USE THE STREET BEING, BRE AND SIDEWALK, WE WOULD NOT USE THAT MONEY FOR CONSTRUCTING NEW SIDEWALKS.
04:32:20.758: >> City Admin. Crawford: NOT TO EXTEND THIS, MAYOR, BUT PERHAPS WE COULD TAKE THIS -- RESPOND TO THIS HATER. LATER. THE KNOP ACCESSIBLE PIECE REFERS TO CITY LAND OR OTHER PARCELS. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I BELIEVE THE STREET FOR THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY COULD ONLY BE USED FOR REPAIRS, UNLESS IT IS FOR A NONACCESSIBLE PROPERTY WHICH WOULD BE A CITY OR OTHER TE GOVERNMENT ENTITY. IS THAT JUST TO CLARIFY?
04:32:54.559: >> THAT'S -- THAT'S NOT CORRECT. THE CURRENT MILLAGE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE MILLE CA BE USED ADJACENT TO TAXABLE PARCELS FOR THE PORTIONS THAT ARE NOT OTHERWISE ACCESSIBLE. SO IT DOES NOT REPLACE ASSESSMENTS BUT IT CAN BE USED TO BUILD SIDEWALKS FOR THE -- FOR THE PARTS OF THE -- OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE -- THAT WE DON'T GENERALLY ASSESS FOR.
04:33:32.897: >> Mayoraylor: COUNCILMEMBER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
04:33:35.066: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I KNOW WE CAN'T GO BACK, BUT THE MEMO FOR THE STREET, BRIDGE AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE, TALKS TO THE -- SPEAKS TO THE REPAIR OF THE SIDEWALKS. JUST POINTING THAT OUT.
04:34:02.193: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? DC-3 IS APPROVED. -4. RESOLUON OF INTENTN THE USE AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE NEW SIDEWALK MILLAGE FUNDS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF DS-4. COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER?
04:34:26.217: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT WE STRIKE LINE SEVEN, OPTION B AND TTOM OF THIS DOCUMENT.A AT E
04:34:39.163: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND?
04:34:48.272: >> Councilmember Nelson: JEFF, CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT YOU ARE STRIKING?
04:34:52.143: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, TO FULLY FUND AND REPLACE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW SIDEWALKS TH WE HE TO GET TO,YSOMETHING AMENDMENTS IN THE CITY CODE WILL NEED TO BE MADE TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE AND THAT'S SAYING THAT THIS MILLAGE WILL BE USED SOLELY FOR 100%. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ASSESS AT ALL. SO RECEIVEN WAS CAPPING OR CONSIDERING A PERCENTAG THINK'M PUTNG FORWARD THAT WE JUST SAY IT COMPLETELY REPLACES THE NOTION OF ASSESSING. I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE A CONCERN, BUT I -- I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE REPLACE IT FULLY.WAY AND MY CONCERN IS THAT THE DDA AND THE BROWNFIELD GET A LITTLE CRISIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN ASK THE DDA TO CONSIDER USING THEIR SLICES OF THIS AND THE STREET MILLAGES OF THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR FOR SIDEWALKS IN THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO ADD TO THIS, BUT I HOPE THAT' WHAT 'S USED FOR, SINCE THEY ARE CUTNG THEIR LITTLE BIT OUT OF THAT MILLAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ABOUT IT IS, BUT IT MIGHT BE SUBSTANTIAL. I GUESS MY FIRST MOTION IS TO STRIKE SEVEN AND LEAVE SIX IF THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SEPARATELY.
04:36:20.331: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:36:21.399: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE GOING TO JUMP RIGHT IO THAT BUT SINC WE'RE THERE, WILL EAK ON THAT MOTION TO OPT FOR OPTION A, WHEN SPEAKING WITH STAFF, I UNDERSTAND AND PERHAPS MR. WILHELM. IS HERE AND WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT GOING WITH ONE OR THE OTHER OPTIONS AND THINK IT'S OBABLY BES TO HEAR IT FROM MR. WILHELM. IF HE CAN EXPLAIN WHAT THE ADVANTAGES ARE DISADVANTAGES OF GOING WITH OPTION A OVER OPTION B IS AND WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF WE WENT WITH OPTION B.
04:37:08.479: >> MAR AND COUIL, VER QUICKLY, OPTION B WOULD CONTINUE TO SPECIAL ASSESS A PORTION OF NEW SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION, AND THIS BECOMES A POLICY QUESTION BUT WE BELIEVE THAT PART OF THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THE NEW SIDEWALK MILLAGE IS TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT COME ONE THAT SPECIAL ASSSMENT PROCESS, RESIDENT OBJECTIONS AND THE POLITICS THAT COME WITH RESIDENTS BEING ASSESSED FOR NEW SIDEWALKS WHICH WE HAVE RECENTLY SEEN THEY OBJECT TO, AND BELIEVE THAT THEY DON'T DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM. WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THAT OR NOT, BY GOING WITH OPTION A, YOU WOULD ELIMINATE THAT PROCESS TIRELY. WOULD THE RESIDENTSTILL HAVE AN ABILITY TO P PROTEST OR IF THERE'S NATURAL FEATURES OTHER THAN THE FINANCIAL ASSESSMENTS WHAT RESOURCE DO RESIDENTS HAVE IN OBJECTING TO IN YOU SIDEWALKS?
04:38:11.308: >> I BELIEVE THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES BUT I WOULD DEFER TO MR. HUTCHION, TO ADDRE THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY.
04:38:19.116: >> YEAH, AND I WOULD COMPARE THAT, IN THAT CASE TO ANY OTHER CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT THAT WE DO, BE IT ROAD RECONSTRUCTION, UTILITY PROJECTS, YOU KNOW KNOW, IF THERE'S ISSUES BE IT NATURAL FEATURES OR OTHER CONCERNS WITH THE RESIDENTS, WE WOULD WORK WITH THOSE RIDENTS TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS ROUTE THE SIDEWALK IN SUCH A WAY TO IMPACT NATURAL FEATURES. SO WE WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS IN WORKING WITH RESIDENTS THAT WE DO ON ALL OF OUR CAPITAL PROJECTS.
04:38:55.786: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WOULD THEY STILL NEED COUNCIL APPROVAL, AND WE HAVE THESE OUTSTANDING COMPLAINTS AND REGARDLESS IF THEY HAD THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS ARE NOT.
04:39:13.437: >> THEY WOULD NEED TO COME TO -- THEY WOULD INTO ED TO APPROVE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS BUT THAT WOULDE T OYIECE OF THA TH COUNCIL WOULD NEED TO APPROVE.
04:39:27.251: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
04:39:30.087: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HUTCHINSON, DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE DIFFERENCE IN SIDEWALK -- THE NUMBER OF YARDS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS CHANGE. THAT'S A POORLY PHRASED QUESON. OPON B, THERE'S MORE MONEY FOR SIDEWALK MILLAGE, FILLING THE SIDEWALK GAPS WITH OPTION B THAN OPTION A, CAN YOU GIVE AN ESTIMATE AS TO HOW MUCH MORE UNITS OF SIDEWALK WE'LL HAVE WITH OPTION B ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAN WITH OPTIO A?
04:40:05.790: >> I DON HAVE THAT DETAILED OF INFORMATION AT MY FINGERTIPS BUT I WOULD SAY THE PERCENTAGE OF PROJECT COSTS CURRENTLY PAID FOR BY SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY LOW. LOOKING BACK AT THE DATA OVER LAST FIVE YEARS SO, IT'S REPRESENTED ABOUT -- I BELIEVE IT WAS 5 TO 6% OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT. SO IT WOULD NOT COMPLETELY REPLACE THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS WOULD NOT CREATE AN EXTREMELY LARGE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO THE SIDEWALKS. THERE WOULD BE SOME CCLING B IT WOULDN'T BE HUGY -- IT BE ENORMOUS.
04:40:58.943: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC WILL RECEIVE PROPER NOTIFICATION AND WE RAN SOME PROBLEMS. IT WAS NOTDMINISTEREDY THE CI, BUT I THINKHE MICHIGAN FITNESS FOUNDATION. I WANT AVOLUNTARY IDENTIFY THAT AND SAY THAT THE STEAM SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROJECT WAS AMENDED AND CERTAIN STREETS SCHOOL WE REMOVEDROM THETO PROJECT AND TRAVER WHERE IT WAS THE LONGER PATH TO SCHOOL AND CHILDREN DID NOT USE IT FOR SCHOOL, BUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PREFERRED THAT IT BE A DROPOFF ZONE FOR THE CHILDREN AND THAT REALLY CLOUDED THE PROJECT. THESE -- T FOUR-STEP PROCESS GOING FORWARD CAN WE ENSURE THAT ANY SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM AGGRESSIVELY NOTIFIES ANY AFFECTED PROPERTY OWNERS?
04:42:12.416: >> ANY PROJECT THAT WE DO, WE LL ENGAGE THE NEIGHRHOOD, TH ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS EARLY AND OFTEN IN THAT PRO E SESSION MEETING.
04:42:20.624: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. GREAT. I THINK WE -- GO AHEAD.
04:42:24.061: >> I WAS GOING TO SAY FOR ANY FORMAL SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT WE MIGHT ENGAGE IN IN THE FUTURE, THERE'S NOTHING ON TAP, BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF THA PROGRAM CAUSE, AGA, THAS A FORMAL PROGM RUN BY THE STATE. BUT THOSE PROJECTS ARE RELATIVELY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.
04:42:46.717: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANKS. AND I THINK THERE WERE SOME LESSONS LEARNED AND AT LEAST AS COUNCILMEMBERS, WE WILL BE BETTER PREPARED TO WORK WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THEUTURE.
04:42:58.796: >> Mayor Tayr: COUNCILMEER HAYNER.
04:42:59.630: >> Cncilmember Hayr: WEE STILL SPEAKING TO A VERSUS B; IS THAT CORRECT?
04:43:02.933: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:43:03.434: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT TO YOUR QUESTION, MR. MAYOR, THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD WE LOSE IF WE DIDN'T GO WITH B, WITH THE $2,500 CAP ASSESSMENT. THE REPLACEMENT OR THE REPAIR PROGRAOMETIMES THEARE REPLACES. I THINK WE PAY ABOUT $500 A SQUARE TO OUR VENDOR FOR THAT AND SQUARE -- YOU KNOW, PER SLAP, WHICH IS FIVE LINEAR FEET, AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME PERCENTAGE OF 25 LINEAR FEET. IT'S ONLY 6 OR 7% OF THAT. YOU ARE BICALLY SAYG, IT'S LESS THAN A SLAB COMING OUT OF EACH PROJECT, RIGHT? OR A COUPLE OF SLABS -- OR SQUARES RATHER. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S SUBSTANTIAL. I THINK THE BENEFIT OF -- OF HAVING THIS PROGRAM GO AHEAD AND MOVE IN THERE AND PRIORITIZE OUR SIDEWALK GAPS AND ACT ON THEY ARE PRIORITIES IS IMPORTANT. I DON'T -- I GUESS MAYBE I WILL JUST REAL QUICKLY SINCE I HAVE I THINK IS GREAT THAT WEO IT, ARE -- THAT THE DEVELOPERS ARE STILL OBLIGATED TO DO THEIR FRONTAGES, BUT I -- I KNOW THERE'S NO DELINEATION OF THE PRIOR IT, AND I THINK IT WILL FOLLOW THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN AND THE CAPITALIZATION PLAN PLAN THAT CORRECT?
04:44:28.218: >> YES.
04:44:28.485: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST A NEW SOURCE OF FUNDS.
04:44:31.388: >> YES.
04:44:31.655: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.

04:46:24.001: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:46:26.303: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I'M CERTAIN THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO SO PASS THIS ON, BUT I AM MORALLY OPPOSED TO VOTING FOR IT. SO I WILL BE VOTING NO.

04:47:17.521: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY AORNEY.
04:47:20.924: >> City ty. Postema: I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT MR. CRAWFORD SAID EARLIER, AND ABOUT THE WORK OF THE CLERK. THE ISSUE IS OUT THERE, SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE READ TODAY THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN ASKED TO TAKE A CASE THAT WAS DECIDED LAST WEEK, ABOUT WHETHER BALLOTS THAT ARE POSTMARKED PRIOR TO 8 P.M. ON ELECTION DAY CAN BE COUNTED. THE COURT OF APPEALS ANSWERED THAT QUESTION LAST WEEK, SAYING NO, THEY CANNOT BE. THAT HAS BEEN THE POSITION FOR A LONG TIME, BUT THE -- THE ARGUMENT IS OUT THERE. I WILL NOTE THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION WAS 2-1. AND SO THAT IS BEING -- THE SUPREME COURT IS BEING ASKED TO RULE ON THIS. THE ARTICLE INDICATED THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING ASKED TO RULE ABOUT THIS QUICKLY, BUT BY LABOR DAY. AND SO -- BUT WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO DO WITH IT, WE'LL CERTAINLY KEEP EVERYBODY POSTED ONHAT, BUT RIGHT NOW THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING PEOPLE TURN INTO BALLOTS, IF THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEM, OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE THAT CHOICE TO TURN THEM IN AT THE CLERK'S OFFICE, BUT THAT ISSUE IS IMPORTANT THAT T THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE R GETTING THEM IN TO THE CLERK'S OFFICE AT 8 P.M. ON ELECTION DAY. AND, AGAIN, IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE PART OF THE ELECTION COMMISSION. OBVIOUSLY, JACKIE BEAUDRY DOES THE BULK OF THE WORK AND HER STAFF. YOU SEE THEM DOWN THERE AT THESE TIMES PROCESSING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BALLOTS AND IT'S JUST A VERYOODROCESSO WATCH, AND I THINK ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET THOSE BALLOTS IN IF THEY ARE COMPLETED. IS IT IMPORTANT MESSAGE AND I THINK THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR FOR MENTIONING THAT.
04:49:30.554: >>ayor Taylor:WE HAVE THE MOON FOR TLERK'SLL RIGHT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MOVED AND SECONDED. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED?

CLERK CALLER 646, YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
04:51:01.244: >> YES, HELLO. HELLO, MAYOR TAYLOR, COUNCILMEMBERS AND CITY STAFF, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE HOUR, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DONE ON BEHALF OF ANN ARBOR. MY NAME IS KEVIN GRUTOWSKI AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SHORT-TERM RENTAL REGULATION. DISAOINTMENT IN TH TONE ANDTREME TENOR EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS OF COUNCIL AND STAFF, COMPARING CIVICALLY MINDED MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY WHO HAVE AND OWN RENTAL PROPERTIES, WITH DRUG DEALERS IS FLAT OUT OFFENSIVE. NO ONE SHOULD EVER CONNATE SHORT-TERM RENTALS WITH SELLING OCESSES. SOME UNHOLY PURSUIT OF BUT I MORE CONCERNED WITH THE UNDERLYING SENTIMENT WHICH IS INSULTING. REGARDING THE FINANCIAL LIABILITY OF LONG TERM FOR SHORT TERM HOW CAN CITY STAFF MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE FINANCES OF PRIVATE CITIZENS AND RECOMMEND POLICIES ON THOSE ASSUMPTIONS. GIVEN THE STATE OF THE WORLD WITH COVID-19, HOW CAN YOU ASSUME THAT THEY MUST BE ABLE TO TO GO PND SAL TELL THE SIMPLY BY PLACING THIS ORDINANCE IN TEEN TITLE 7 BUSINESS AND TRADE STAFF HAS CIRCUMVENTED THE PLANNING COMMISSION, MADE UP OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS, THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, WHICH RESULTS -- REGULATES THE PROPERTY AND LAND USE AND THE HOUSING CODE, WHICH REGULATES RENTALS LIVING IN E CITY. ONN ISSUE PURPORTED TO BE BASED ON ZONING AND HOUSING. REGARDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE M MARKET FORCES ARE COMPLEX AND GO YARD BEYOND .002% OF ANN ARBOR'S 50,000 PLUS HOUSING UNITS THAT NON-OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALSEPRESENT. I WOULD ASK WHAT DATA IS BEINGED WHEN DETMINING THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL'S IMPACT ON THE HOUSING MARKET BUT I WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT WAS ADMITTEDLY PURE CONJECTURE. THOSE CONCERNS ARE WHOLLY IGNORES AND UNFORTUNATELY NEVER ACTED UPON WITHOUT MEANINGFUL ACTION, IT'S HOLLOW L SERVICE. BY LIMITIN THEPTIONS AVAILABL TO VISITORS YOU ARE INFACT TURNING AWAY MANY PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD HOTEL SUITES. WE HAD A REF REFUGEE FAMILY PLAD WITH US, WHO COULD NOT AFFORD A
04:53:30.860: >> IT WOULD HAVE NEAR UNIVERSAL SUPPORT. EVEN SETTING THAT ASIDE HOW IS THIS NOT THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF NON-CONFORMING USE. PLEASE TAKE A DO NO HARM APPROA. THANKOU F YOUR TIME.
04:53:54.985: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
04:54:09.866: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER ENDING 205. DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT.
04:54:12.435: >> THIS IS JOE SPALDING IN CALIRNIA, WHE MY RENT IS 1725 FOR A 600-FOOT STUDIO AND IT ABSOLUTELY CAN HAPPEN OVER THERE IN ANN ARBOR. THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING, ACTUALLY. I'M CALLING TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE COUNCIL TO MOVE TO HAVE AN AGENDA ITEM INVOLVING A TECHNOLOGY CE OTTES FOR CITY COUNCILMEMBERS AS WELL AS DE COUNSELING CODE OF ETHICS. I MEAN SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING SOME OF THE VIDEOS I HAVE PUT UP, YOU CAN SEE THEM AT FACEBO FABOOK.COM/ANNARRFORFOREVERY ONE. ERE'S WAYOO MANY EXALES O COUNCILMEMBE TALKING ON THE PHONE WHILE PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING, WHICH IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE RULES. IN ADDITION, COUNCILMEMBERS ARE BLOCKING PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ON CHANNELS THAT THEY USE TO COMMUNICATE OFFICIAL COUNCIL BUSINESS. AND THAT'S QUESTIONABLE THEIRST AMENDMENT CHILLING IN ADDITION THE DISCUSSION ABOUT LANZINI'S PAGE IS CORRECT, AND I'M SLIDE ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT IN THIS AGNE -- AND I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT IN THIS LANGUAGE, THAT TALK FREQUENTLY ON THIS PAGE WITH ZERO PUSHBACK AND COUNCILMEMBERS FREQUENTLY DO GO TRE. THAT IS WHERE THEHICKEN DISCUSSION IS AND SPEAKING OF THE CHICKEN DISCUSSION, WHEN THAT DISCUSSION FROM THAT PAGE WAS READ OUT HERE A FEW MONTHS AGO, SIX OF YOU AND ANYONE CAN GUESS WHICH SIX, AND MAYBE NOT JEFF, BECAUSE INJURE CAMERA WAS OFF, WERE TEXTING BACK AND FORTH. SO WHEN I COME BACK TO TALKING ABOUTENOLOGY,OCIAL MIA, AND VIDEOONFERENCINGOLD OF ETHICS, I'M JUST ASKING FOR SOME BASE LEVEL PROFESSIONALISM AND ALL OF YOUR VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS AND IF YOU HAVE OPPONENTS, THEM TOO, THEY ALL ACT THAT WAY WHEN THEY ARE AT WORK. WE ARE NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING THAN YOU, YOU PUBLIC SERVANTS. THANK YOU. I YIELD MY TIME.
04:56:24.501: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.

ELECTEPOSITIONS AREILLEAL WITH PEOPLE OF GENERATIONAL AFTER FLUENT RATHER THAN THOSE ON THE RECEIVING END OF POORLY SOUGHT OUT POLITICAL RESPONSES TO AN EVER PRESSING NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ONE CANNOT RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL IN THE STATE THEY DO NOT LIVE IN. WE WANT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PRESENT THE IMMEDIATE MMUNITY BUTF PEOE WHO HAVE RE EXPERIENCES ARE BEING PUSHED OUT AND FORCED TO LEAVE ELSEWHERE, EVEN IF THEY CONTINUE TO WORK AND GO TO SCHOOL IN THESE AREAS, ARE THEIR INTERESTS TRULY BEING REPRESENTED. AS FROM THE VALUABLE PERSPECTIVES HOW CAN WE FIND EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS AND MANY OF THEM ARE WORKING CLASS AND BLAC INDIGENOUS PEOPLE O COLOR. WE ARE ASKING FOR INCLUSION. FROM THE VERY PEOPLE WHO PROFESS TO BE OUR ALLIES, WOULD EXPRESS THEIR AWARENESS OF THEIR PRIVILEGE AND THEN CLAIM THEY LEARNED FROM THEIR STORIES AND OUR EXPERIENCES. SOCIOECONOMIC DIVERSITY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS ANY RACL ENEAT NICK DIVERSITYST PRODUCES ANY ET ETHNIC DIVERSITY. I DON'T WANT YOUR MIND ON MYSELF. AND I RECENTLY MADE FRIENDS WITH A WHOM WHOSE ECONOMICALLY STABLE BUT HER MOTHER WAS FORCED OUT OF ANN ARBORUE TO A RSE IN HER RENT. HER MOTHER LIVES IN THE SAME APARTMENT COMPLEX THAT I LIVE IN NOW THAT I NEED TO LIVE. I WILL STILL PAY MORE THAN 30% OF MY INCOME INTO LIVING EXPENSES. IT'S DOABLE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY ECONOMIL. I' A AMONG ONE OF THOSE WHO NOT ONLY ENDORSE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE  MILLAGE YET I Y AWAIT IT TO PLANT SEEDS IN ANN ARBOR. I YIELD MY TIME.

05:03:46.876: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR, AND I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY PASSIONATE OUTBURST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING. I HAD NO INTENTION TO SAY THAT, DURING FIRST SET OF COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, IEAR IT ON MY SLEEVE AND I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE. I'M ALWAYS GOING TO WEAR MY -- I'M ALWAYS GOING TO WEAR MY HEART ON MANY I SLEEVE AND SOMETIMES THAT GETS THE BEST OF ME. BUT I DO WANT TO EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUES WOULD WANT TO USE COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF A MEETING TO HAVE INAPPROPRIATE CONVERSATIONS AND START MEETINGS OFFER IN A WAY THAT ARE DISPARAGING AND FRANKLY BENEATH THIS BODY. WE HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR HAVING LATE MEETINGS BEING LONG MEETINGS. WE HAVEEEN CRITICIZED FOR NOT ACTING ON ENOUGH OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE OUTSTANDING, AND I DON'T BELIEVE HAVING THOSE KIND OF COMMENTS MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF A MEETING GARBLED MEETING ANY GOOD.IF WE HAVE COME POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, THEN WE WAIT UNTIL THIS TIME WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR SAY AND WE HAVE DONE THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE AND THEN WE CAN START ATTACKING EACH OTHER POLITICALLY IF WE WANT. I THINK IT'S A HUGE DISSERVICE AND BENEATH THIS BODY TO TAKE THE COMMUNICATE AT THE START OF A MEETING, THE WAY IT WAS STARTED TODAY. AND I WILL DO MILL BEST TO KEEP MYSELF COMPOSED COMPOSED, BUT IT PROMISE COULD KEEP MYSELF COMPOSED IF OTHERS DRAG THIS BODY THROUGH THE MUD.
