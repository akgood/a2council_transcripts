00:00:32.563: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY INTRODUCTIONS THIS EVENING?
00:00:37.668: >> I WILL BE FILLING IN FOR BRETT LENART TONIGHT. I'M CHRIS CHANG IN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT.
00:00:46.677: >> Chair Milshteyn: WELCOME. PLANNING COMMISSION AGENDA. MOVED BY MILLS AND SECONDED BY GIBB-RANDALL. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING, WE HAVE THE FEBRUARY 4th, 2020, MEETING MINUTES. DO I HAVE A COMMISSION THAT WILE THEM? MOVED BY BRIGGS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. MOVING ON TO REPORTS FROM PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES, WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE'LL BEGIN WITH OUR CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:01:22.780: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. IT'S BEEN A LONG WEEK. A COUPLE ITEMS OF IMMEDIATE RELEVANCE. FIRST, THERE WAS THE ANNEX AT NEWPORT AND IT BRINGS ANOTHER SINGLE FAMILY HOME INTO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. ADDITIONALLY, CITY COUNCIL ESTABLISHED -- VOTED TO ESTABLISH A CITY COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE. THIS IS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF CITY COUNCIL WITH FUNCTIONS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. WHILE, THE RESOLUTION ITSELF IS POORLY WRITTEN AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THEIR SCOPE OF WORK IS. ONE COULD ASSUME THAT IT WILL SUBPLANT POWER FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND CITIZEN VOLUNTEERS AND PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF SELECT CITY COUNCILMEMBERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE CITY COUNCIL MAJORITY VOLUNTARIES 7-4 TO TERMINATE THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR OVERSEES A PROFESSIONAL STAFF OF 750 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES HERE AT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. 40 DEPARTMENTS OF OVER $400 MILLION BUDGET. WE ARE A COMPLEX, LARGE, IMPORTANT, MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION, THAT DOESN'T HAVE A CAPTAIN OR A RUDDER AT THIS TIME. IT WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR WAS FOLLOWING THE RULES, DOING HIS JOB, FOLLOWING THE POLICY DIRECTION OF CITY COUNCIL. IT'S AN UPSETTING EVENT. I THINK TO PUT IT IN THE BEST CONTEXT, WE HAVE A FORM OF GOVERNANCE HERE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR THAT IS FOUNDED ON THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM, WHICH AROSE IN THE LATE 1800s AND EARLY 1900s TO FIGHT AGAINST NEPOTISM, TO FIGHT AGAINST EVERY ELECTION OR PLACING PROFESSIONAL CIVIL SERVANTS WITH POLITICAL ALLIES WHO WOULD BE MORE FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN POWER. AND MR. LAZARUS DIDN'T DESERVE TO BE FIRED. HE WAS AN UPSTANDING PROFESSIONAL. BUT MORE THAN JUST ONE ACTION, IT REPRESENTS A 15-MONTH TREND OF CERTAIN COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PASS LEGISLATION THROUGH RESOLUTION, ORDINANCE AND HAVE INSTEAD DECIDED TO TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO REPLACE THE CITY ADMINISTRATION ITSELF. IT'S WITH A HEAVY HEART I SHARE THAT NEWS. I THINK IT'S A BIG BLOW TO TRANSPARENT AND FAIR GOVERNMENT IN ANN ARBOR, BUT IT'S WHERE WE ARE.
00:04:03.040: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT. PLANNING COMMISSIONER -- OR I'M SORRY, PLANNING MANAGER.
00:04:08.812: >> NOTHING TO REPORT.
00:04:09.813: >> PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? COMMISSIONER WOODS?
00:04:15.252: >> Commissioner Woods: I WANTED TO REPORT FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE, WHICH MET LAST NIGHT, AND PART OF OUR DISCUSSION WAS IN REGARDS TO THE MOBILITY COMMITTEE, WHICH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN JUST REFERRED TO. OUR QUESTION IS -- AND I BELIEVE THAT WE'LL BE SEEKING INFORMATION ABOUT THE REDUNDANCY OF WHAT WE DO AND THAT OF THIS NEWLY CREATED COMMISSION -- COMMITTEE OF THE -- SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL. AND SECONDLY, MANY ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WERE ACTUALLY QUITE SHOCKED AND CONCERNED THAT THE CREDENTIALS WERE QUESTIONED OF THOSE OF US WHO ARE ON THE COMMITTEE AND MINIMIZED AND WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS VERY INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS HERE. WE ARE NOT GETTING PAID. IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY TO READ OUR PACK ELIMINATES, NOT ONLY ON THAT COMMISSION BUT ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS SUCH AS THIS ONE. AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT SOMETIMES COMMENTS COMING FROM THE CITY COUNCIL TABLE WILL, INDEED, BEGIN TO MAKE CITIZENS OF OUR COMMUNITY FEEL THAT THEIR EFFORTS AND THEIR INPUT IS NOT WELCOMED, NOR IS IT SEEN IN THE -- IN THE LIGHT OF WHERE IT'S BEING -- WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. SO CERTAINLY, I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT CONCERN AS WELL.
00:05:50.013: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. ANY OTHER REPORTS FROM COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? ALL RIGHT. WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS? WE DO HAVE SOME CORRESPONDENCES THAT WE RECEIVED. THEY ARE PART OF OUR PACKET. NOW IS THE TIME FOR AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. IF THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WHO WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON OUR AGENDA FOR THIS EVENING, THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. PLEASE COME UP TO THE PODIUM BEING STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND YOU WILL HAVE UP TO THREE INN MANY MANY -- MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA. SEEING NO ONE. WE MOVE TO THE PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR OUR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING. MR. CHANG.
00:06:34.825: >> WE HAVE 950 GREENE STREET. THAT'S A REVISED LAND SCAPE PLAN, TREE MITIGATION PLAN, SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. THAT'S TWO LANDMARK TREES WERE DAMAGED DURING CONSTRUCTION AND PROPOSED TO BE REPLACED BY PLANTING AN ADDITIONAL TEN TREES ON SITE. 16 TREES IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, WHICH IS THE LAWN EXTENSION AND MAKING A FREE FRONT FUND CONTRIBUTION OF $9,648 FOR THE 48 INCHES OF TREES NOT PLANTED. SITE PLAN WAS ORIGINALLY APPROVED IN 2019 FOR THIS 1.63-ACRE PARCEL ZONED BUSINESS SERVICE WHICH IS C2B. WE ALSO HAVE 200-202 HURONVIEW BOULEVARD ADDITION TO BARN SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THIS IS A PROPOSED THREE-STORY, 496 SQUARE FOOT ADDITION TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE BARN TO BE USED FOR OFFICE USE. ON THIS .6-ACRE PARCEL THAT'S ZONED OFFICE. JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, IT SAYS IN THE POSTING THAT IT IS A 543 SQUARE FOOT ADDITION. I ARE A ED TO YOU THAT IT WAS 496 SQUARE -- I READ YOU TO THAT IT IS 496 SQUARE FEET AND THAT IS THE CORRECT ADDITION, AS FAR AS FLOOR AREA.
00:07:42.859: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. AND THAT IS SCHEDULED FOR OUR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING, MARCH 3rd, WHICH IS A TUESDAY. SO WE'RE BACK TO OUR TUESDAY SCHEDULE AT 7 P.M. MOVING ON TO REGULAR BUSINESS, THE FIRST ITEM BEFORE US IS 3874 RESEARCH PARK DRIVE SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. OUR PROCEDURE IS THE PETITIONER WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. WE WILL THEN MOVE ON TO A REPORT FROM CITY STAFF, AND THEN PUBLIC COMMENT, PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WE'LL GO TO DISCUSSION AND A MOTION AND A VOTE. SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER.
00:08:17.594: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M MARK PASCO FROM STANTECH AND HERE TO TALK ABOUT 3874 RESEARCH PARK DRIVE AND WITH ME IS TIER ONE TEAM OF THE OWNER, HOBBS AND BLACK AND JOE VIGG WITH VIGG CONSTRUCTION, AND MYSELF AND SANDRA FROM STANTECH. SO OUR SITE IS OVER ON 3874 RESEARCH PARK DRIVE. HOPEFULLY YOU HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE PACKET AND IT'S ROUGHLY A 5.6-ACRE SITE. OH, I GUESS THE ARROW DOESN'T WORK. IT'S SOUTH OF 94, EAST OF STATE STREET, NORTH OF ELLSWORTH IN THE RESEARCH PARK. THERE'S AN EXISTING 27,000 SQUARE FOOT. WE ARE PROPOSING A 79,000 SQUARE FOOT OFFICE AND RESEARCH USE. SO FROM THE ZONING MAP, YOU CAN SEE THE LOCATION AND WE'RE PROPERLY ZONED AND THE LOCATION, ONCE AGAIN, IS SOUTH OF 94. I THINK YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT AREA. SO OUR CONCEPT PLAN SHOWN, BLOWN UP HERE. SOME OF HIGHLIGHTS, ONCE AGAIN, 79,000 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING. WE HAVE GOT A SHARED DRIVE EXISTING DRIVE THAT WE ARE USING. WE ARE ADDING AN EMERGENCY ACCESS DRIVE ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE SITE FOR THE FIRE MARSHAL AND SAFETY. WE HAVE GOT UNDERGROUND DETENTION, ENHANCED BIORETENTION ON THE SITE, AND I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS. WE MEET ALL THE STANDARD ZONING CODES. WE WORK WITH STAFF TO RESOLVE ALL OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT THIS TIME. SO WITH ME IS TOM AND HE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BUILDING.
00:10:23.353: >> GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NAME IS TOM PHILIPS WITH HOBBS AND BLOCK BLK DOWN THE STREET HERE. SO THE BUILDING IS KIND OF -- KIND OF THE OVERALL CONCEPT OF THE BUILDING IS TO MAKE IT KIND OF A NEXT GENERATION COMBINATION R&D BUILDING AND OFFICES AS MARK MENTIONED. SO GIVEN THAT THIS SITE HAS SOME KIND OF INTERESTING CHALLENGES, ARCHITECTURALLY, AND IT HAS A -- ONE OF OUR GOALS WAS TO HAVE A -- PROVIDE NUMEROUS LOCATIONS WHERE PEOPLE COULD -- MULTIPLE TENANTS COULD HAVE ENTRIES AND LOADING IN THE SAME BUILDING. SO WE DESIGNED IT TO BE FLEXIBLE. IT WILL BE ATTRACTIVE AND HAVE KIND OF A HIGH-TECH APPEARANCE AND STANDOUT A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS COMPARED TO A LOT OF OTHER BUILDINGS. SO WE -- WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BET MORE CHARACTER THAN YOU SEE -- BIT MORE CHARACTER THAN YOU SEE IN A LOT OF BILLINGS. WE DESIGNED SUSTAINABLE FEATURES INTO THE BUILDING AS WELL, AS FAR AS SUN SHADES, ADDITIONAL INSULATION, A WHITE ROOF, AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO RECYCLED CONTENT OF SOME OF THOSE FINISHED MATERIALS. HERE YOU ARE SEEING SOME OF THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE IDEA WHERE YOU CAN SAY IF THERE'S MULTIPLE TENANTS. THIS' OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE TENANTS TO CREATE ENTRIES KIND OF THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING, INTERDISPERSED WITH ACCESS WITH OVERHEAD DOORS. THIS WOULD BE A -- A -- LIKE I SAID, AS I MENTIONED AN R&D USE. THIS YOU ARE SEEING SOME OF THE SUN SHADES. THE BUILDING SKIN IS ESSENTIALLY A UP 50Y FORM. -- UNIFORM. IT'S THE MATERIALS THAT ARE MOVING IN AND OUT AS YOU GO AROUND THE BUILDING. GENERALLY, IT'S -- WE WOULD BE USING INSULATED HIGH PERFORMANCE GLASS, AS YOU GO ALL EXPECT, AND WE USED A LITTLE BIT OF CURTAIN WALL ACCESS AS WE FACE THE ROAD. SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE SITE IS WE DON'T HAVE ANY DIRECT ACCESS OFF OF RESEARCH PARK DRIVE. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE MORE TRADITIONAL OFFICE SPACE POTENTIALLY FACING THAT DIRECTION. I WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO MARK. THANK YOU.
00:12:54.604: >> YES, WE JUST COPIED THE SITE DATA OFF THE PLAN SHEETS TO SHOW WHERE WE MEET CODE AND IT'S ALSO REINFORCED IN THE STAFF REPORT. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS, BUT THAT'S -- THAT'S OUR PRESENTATION. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
00:13:14.624: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR STAFF REPORT, MR. CHANG.
00:13:18.394: >> YES, JUST A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD. THEY ARE ADDING OR PROPOSING 220 PARKING VEHICLES, PARKING SPACES ON SITE. 24 OF THOSE ARE BEING DEFERRED. THEY DO BEAT THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF PARKING REQUIRED. THEY ARE REMOVING ONE 18-INCH HONEY L LOCUST THAT TREE WAS PAT OF THE ORIGINAL LANDSCAPE PLAN. IT WAS NOT A HIGH QUALITY TREE. BUT THEY HAVE MITIGATION THROUGHOUT THE SITE AND THEY HAVE A 5-FOOT WIDE PUBLIC SIDEWALK THAT WILL BE FRONTING ON RESEARCH DRIVE. AII'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
00:14:00.170: >> Chair Milshteyn: IS THERE ANYONE WHO WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS. SEEING TO ONE I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE 3874 RESEARCH PARK SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER WOODS.
00:14:30.633: >> Commissioner Woods: WELL, I WILL JUST START US OFF. I JUST -- CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING, WHAT YOUR BUILDING PLAN WOULD LOOK LIKE?
00:14:40.109: >> SURE, I'M CAM McCAUSELAND, THE PRINCIPAL PARTNER IN THE PROJECT. WE ARE BUILDING THIS ON I ASPEC A SPECSPACE IS. TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO IS LEAVE THE FLOOR OUT OF THESE BUILDINGS. SO THEY ARE REALLY FLEXIBLE. WE TYPICALLY HAVE SOME COMBINATION OF OFFICE AND LAB OR SOME LAB OR WAREHOUSE SPACE THAT MIGHT OCCUR WITH THESE. SO WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE GOING TO NECESSARILY HAVE IN THE BUILDING.
00:15:06.069: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. SO IS THERE ACTUALLY ACCESS BETWEEN THE INSIDE OF THE BUILDING AND THE OFFICES OR DO YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE TO REACH ANOTHER --
00:15:16.779: >> NO, THERE WILL BE THEIR OWN ENTER REINTO THEIR OWN SUITE. THE BUILDING IS REALLY DESIGNED WHERE WE COULD HAVE MULTIPLE TENANTS OR IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE A SINGLE TENANT BUILDING. WE ARE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT IS GOING TO OCCUR WITH THE POTENTIAL TENANCY OF THE BUILDING.
00:15:32.228: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. AND CAN YOU JUST TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ARE RECYCLING AND SUSTAINABILITY KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU ARE DOING WITH THE BUILDING.
00:15:42.872: >> THAT IS WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF MY SPECTRUM. THAT WOULD BE HIM.
00:15:46.976: >> SURE. YES. IN TERMS OF RECYCLING, WE WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR TENANTS TO DO RECYCLING ON SITE. SO THAT REALLY IS AN EASY THING TO DO. IT'S HANDLED IN THE SCREENED AREA FOR THE DUMPSTER AND SO ON TO HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR THAT. THE BUILDING ITSELF IS GOING TO HAVE UPGRADED, LIKE, ROOF INSULATION. AGAIN, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A BUILDING SHELL. SO THE AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DESIGN NOW TO BE CONSTRUCTED WILL BE SUSTAINABLE IN NATURE. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MASONRY, METAL PANELS WITH THE HIGH RECYCLED CONTENT, A WHITE ROOF THAT WILL HELP WITH HEAT ISLAND EFFECT, AND L.E.D. LIGHT FIXTURES TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE LIGHT FIXTURES AND THEN THOSE FIXTURES WILL BE SENSITIVE TO AMBIENT LIGHT IN TERMS OF BEING DIRECTED DOWN ON THE SITE. SO WE ARE REALLY -- IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A LEAD PROJECT BUT WE ARE USING A LOT OF THE LEAD CONCEPTS AND THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.
00:16:42.231: >> Commissioner Woods: ANY PLANS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES CHARGING, THINGS LIKE THAT?
00:16:45.702: >> THAT TYPICALLY WOULD COME LATER WITH THE TENANT, BUT WE WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY ON SITE TO ADD ELECTRICAL VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS.
00:16:53.876: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. THANK YOU. AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD THAT ANN ARBOR IS SEEKING TO REDUCE OUR FOOTPRINT.
00:17:00.817: >> OH, ABSOLUTELY.
00:17:01.851: >> Commissioner Woods: AND I THINK WE PROBABLY HAVE QUESTIONS WHEN BRAND NEW BUILDINGS ARE COMING INTO BEING HOW YOU WILL FIT INTO THOSE GOALS.
00:17:09.625: >> YES, I WOULD SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS THAT -- OF THIS TYPE IN ANN ARBOR, OF INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS, BECAUSE, A LOT OF THE BUILDINGS, LIKE IN SOME OF THE OLDER AREAS ARE DECADES OLD AND THIS IS ALL NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE MECHANICAL SYSTEMS WILL BE HIGH EFFICIENCY AND THE L.E.D. LIGHTING IS COOLER AND USES LESS POWER. ALL OF THOSE FEATURES WILL BE IN THIS BUILDING AND WILL REALLY MAKE IT STAND OUT IN THE MARKET, WE THINK.
00:17:44.026: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:17:45.428: >> THANK YOU.
00:17:46.496: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:17:47.563: >> ONE THING TO NOTE WITH THIS, JUST TO ADD TO THAT, IS THAT WE ARE KNOCKING DOWN A 50-YEAR-OLD VERY ANTIQUATED BUILDING THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, THAT'S QUITE INEFFICIENT IN ITS CAPACITY AS IT SITS TODAY, AND IS REALLY BEEN -- AND THERE IS SOME ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, SMALL BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO STORMWATER RETENTION OVER THERE AND STUFF. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ALSO DOING WITH THIS PLAN IS NEW UNDERGROUND RETENTION. SO IT'S IT'S A MAJOR RENOVATION OVER THERE.
00:18:20.696: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:18:25.301: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANKS. I THINK GENERALLY THIS BUILDING, THE PLAN DEFINITELY FITS CLEARLY WITHIN OUR CODE. I APPRECIATE THE DEFERRING OF PARKING UNTIL YOU -- YOU KNOW, YOU COME TO A POINT WHERE YOU THINK YOU NEED IT. THE COMMENT THAT WAS JUST MADE OR THE QUESTION ABOUT E.V. CHARGING AND YOU SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE CAPACITY ON SITE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? LIKE, IS IT YOU ARE SIZING THE ELECTRICAL HOOKUP OR YOU ARE RUNNING CONDUIT. CAN YOU TELL US MORE SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY YOU ARE READY?
00:18:57.700: >> SURE. WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR IN THE DESIGN PROCESS TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT LOCATIONS FOR CHARGING STATIONS, BUT TYPICALLY, WE WOULD HAVE CAPACITY IN OUR SERVICE FOR THE BUILDING THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR THAT. AND THEN NORMALLY WE COULD HAVE SOME CONDUIT LOCATIONS AS WELL, BUT I DIDN'T POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR YET.
00:19:20.423: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD LOVE -- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR YET. US UNDERSTANDING, LIKE, HOW MANY KIND OF SPOTS YOU ARE ANTICIPATING AND HOW THAT KIND OF COMPARES TO YOUR OVERALL LOAD. RIGHT NOW WE ARE CONTEMPLATING AN E.V. ORDINANCE THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOMETHING, AND SO UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU ALL ARE THINKING ABOUT IT WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE. BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR, I UNDERSTAND.
00:19:43.913: >> AND WE CAN ENGAGE BACK WITH YOU FOLKS AS WE FIGURE ALL OF THAT OUT, FOR SURE.
00:19:49.285: >> Vice Chair Mills: ARE YOU THINKING AT THIS INTER POINT, YE 200 SOME PARKING SPACES. HOW MANY CHARGERS.
00:19:57.026: >> TWO, WITH MAYBE SOME CAPACITY FOR ADDITIONAL ONES IF WE NEED IT.
00:20:00.696: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY, I CAN'TEN HELP I CAN'T HELP BUTNOTICE THAT YOUY LARGE ROOF. WHY NO SOLAR?
00:20:13.709: >> AGAIN, IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS PART OF THE PROGRAM AT THIS STAGE, BUT, AGAIN, WE COULD S SEE APHETER AE TENANT INTERESTED IN THAT. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A SHELL OF A BUILDING THAT'S REALLY READY FOR A FUTURE TENANT. IT WILL BE A HIGH HIGH-TECH BUIG AND SOLAR IS SOMETHING THAT COULD COME ALONG.
00:20:38.634: >> Vice Chair Mills: IS THAT PART OF THE DESIGN THAT YOU ARE STRUCTURALLY READY FOR IT? ARE YOU ELECTRICALLY READY FOR IT? BECAUSE IT'S FAR CHEAPER TO -- WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING IT NOW, RIGHT?
00:20:47.743: >> OH, YEAH, IT WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH ROOF CAPACITY. THE ROOF ALREADY IS GOING TO SUPPORT IT, THE ROOF TYPE, WE WILL USE AN ADHERED TPR, OR MEMORY ROOF. IT'S JUST THAT WE ARE NOT THERE YET IN THE PROGRAM. YES, WE DEFINITELY COULD INCLUDE THE LOAD CAPACITY FOR SOLAR, WHICH IS NOT EVEN VERY HIGH. IT'S MINIMAL.
00:21:12.301: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND IT'S MORE LIKE, ARE YOU RUNNING THE CONDUIT -- AGAIN, LIKE MAKING IT SO THAT IT CAN BE PLUGGED IN EFFECTIVELY FROM THE ROOF? I -- WHAT I WOULD JUST SUGGEST, THERE'S A COUPLE OF US THAT CITY ON THE CITY'S CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMISSION, AND THAT ROOF TOP COULD BE SUPER VALUABLE TO SOMEONE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE YET, BUT YOU ARE BUILDING A BRAND NEW BUILDING NOW, AND SO YOU ARE STARTING FROM SCRATCH. EVERYTHING THAT WE TALK ABOUT GENERALLY IN THE CITY IS RETROFITTING, RIGHT?
00:21:40.997: >> RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
00:21:42.331: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND SO YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NOW. I UNDERSTAND IF THAT DOESN'T FIT IN YOUR PROGRAM, THOUGH YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR -- WHAT -- DO YOU TEND TO OWN THE BUILDING LONG-TERMO WHAT ARE IS THE KIND OF MODEL FOR THAT?
00:21:56.846: >> YEAH, SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION, BECAUSE WE OWN ABOUT 400,000 SQUARE FEET, MOSTLY IN PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP AND MOSTLY IN RETROFITTED BUILDINGS. OBVIOUSLY THIS -- WE OWN MOSTLY THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT, SINGLE STORY, FLEX BUILDING AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR -- AS WE TURN TENANTS OVER, WE ARE ABSOLUTELY SEEING A NEED FOR E.V. CHARGING. IN FACT, WE ARE WORKING ON A PROJECT RIGHT NOW THAT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME E.V. CHARGING ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AND YOU ARE JUST GOING TO -- THERE'S NO QUESTION, IT'S COMING. HOW MANY OF THOSE? YOU KNOW, WE -- IT COULD BE TEN YEARS, WE MAY HAVE THE WHOLE PARKING LOT MIGHT HAVE TO BE CHARGED IN SOME CAPACITY. SO THERE'S NO QUESTION WE WILL ADD IN SOME WAY. WE WILL HAVE IT HERE. IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH AND WHERE. AGAIN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FLOOR PLAN OF THAT BUILDING, PARKING, ALL ALONG THE PERIMETER SO, YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO PUT IT STRATEGICALLY IN THE RIGHT SPOTS. THE UTILITIES WILL ONLY GO INTO A CENTRAL ROOM RIGHT NOW AND THEY WILL BE DISTRIBUTED IN THE FUTURE DEPENDING ON HOW THAT -- THE TENANCY OF THE BUILDING REALLY TAKES PLACE.
00:23:03.179: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH, I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT AND I DON'T KNOW TOTALLY WHAT IT INVOLVES TO LIKE PUT -- BUT DRAWING AND FIGURING OUT WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO GET WIRES TO THE ROOF FOR THE SOLAR PANELS BECAUSE I -- YOU ANTICIPATE OWNING THIS BUILDING I'M IMAGINING FOR --
00:23:16.826: >> A SINGLE STORY BUILDING, IT IS VERY SIMPLE. WE HAVE ONE ELECTRICAL SERVICE BUILDING AS CAM JUST SAID. ITS A MATTER OF RUNNING THE CONDUIT UP TO THE ROOF. IT'S NOT LIKE A HIGH-RISE WHERE YOU HAVE TO RUN SOMETHING THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
00:23:35.478: >> IT WOULD HAVE SAND FLOOR SO WE CAN PUT PLUMBING ALL OVER THE BUILDING. ELECTRICAL ALL OVER THE BUILDING. AND IN THE ACCESSIBILITY TO THE ROOF WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, JUST SUPER STRUCTURE WHERE WE COULD GO AND PUT -- DO ANYTHING WITH IT. WE WANT TO MAKE IT AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHO THE TENANT WILL BE. WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA BUT YOU HAVE TO BE SUPER FLEXIBLE. YOU KNOW, WE END UP IRRELEVANT THATTING UP THESE BUILDINGS -- END UP TEARING UP THESE BUILDINGS ALL THE TIME. THE AVAILABILITY TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IS PROBABLY THE BEST CASE SCENARIO TO DECIDE WHAT WE REALLY WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE ULTIMATELY.
00:24:14.116: >> Vice Chair Mills: JUST SO I CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THESE BUILDINGS OPERATE, TYPICALLY, WHO PAYS THE UTILITIES?
00:24:20.489: >> THE TENANT.
00:24:22.191: >> Vice Chair Mills: THE TENANT PAYS THE UTILITY AND THEY ARE PAYING THE RENT?
00:24:25.928: >> YES.
00:24:26.228: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. AND YOU ARE DESIGNING THIS TO BE ULTRA EFFICIENT.
00:24:30.266: >> MM-HMM.
00:24:30.566: >> Vice Chair Mills: ARE YOU WORKING -- LIKE, DOES THAT COMMAND -- IT'S A NEW BUILDING, SO I'M GUESSING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN AN EXISTING BUILD, BUT DOES THAT COMMAND HIGHER RENT BEING ABLE TO SELL TO YOUR TENANT THAT IT'S UBER ENERGY EFFICIENT OR HOW -- LIKE, I'M JUST CURIOUS, AGAIN, BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PUSHING FOR. HOW IT WORKS AS A BUILDING OWNER.
00:24:52.888: >> LET ME TAKE THAT.
00:24:53.989: >> SURE. SO I'M THE BUILDER, JOE VIG. WE KNOW EACH OTHER. NICE TO SEE YOU. AND I'M A PARTNER IN THE PROJECT AS WELL. AND I THINK THE QUESTIONS OR THE SUGGESTIONS ARE REALLY GOOD ONES BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE FINDING, YOU KNOW, BEYOND OUR OWN DESIRE TO BE SUSTAINABLE, THE TENANTS ARE DEMANDING IT AND SO WE WANT THIS BUILDING PREPPED FOR KIND OF CARBON NEUTRALITY WILL. YOU KNOW, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR ABILITY TO DO DEALS WITH NEWT FUTURE TENANTS IS GOING TO ESSENTIALLY HINGE ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER THINGS LIKE SOLAR AND OTHER MODERN TECHNOLOGY. E.V. CHARGING STATIONS AS TOM MENTIONED TOO, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BECAUSE HE'S NOT SPENDING OUR MONEY BUT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, WE WOULD WANT TO BE AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF STATIONS. WE RECOGNIZED IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, WITHIN ONE TENANT LEASE, WE MAY HAVE A PARKING LEASE THAT IS ENTIRELY FILLED WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WE WOULD HOPE. AND I WOULD SAY THAT OUR MOTIVES, ARE, YOU KNOW, THE SAME AS YOURS AND THAT IS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THIS RIGHT, AND TO PREP THIS BUILDING WITH, YOU KNOW, KIND OF ALL THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED AND THEN FROM A SUSTAINABILITY PERSPECTIVE, WHAT WE ARE FINDING IS THE TENANTS ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY ASPECT OF IT, BUT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IT FROM THEIR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE REALLY DEMANDING THAT THEY WORK IN SUSTAINABLE WORK PLACES. YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF, INDOOR AIR QUALITY, IN TERMS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND JUST GENERALLY KIND OF MOVING TOWARDS, YOU KNOW, AN OVERALL GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY. SO WE ARE TRYING TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF THAT, AND TO DIFFERENTIATE WITH THE BUILDING OF THIS BUILDING TO BUILDING TODIFFERENTIATE IT FROF OBSOLETE BUILDINGS IN THE MARKET.
00:26:58.147: >> Vice Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. THANK YOU.
00:26:59.315: >> THANK YOU.
00:27:00.115: >> Vice Chair Mills: THIS IS ONE WHERE WE CERTAINLY DON'T REQUIRE SOLAR PANELS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT, BUT I THINK YOU HAVE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE IN THINKING ABOUT SOLAR CARPORTS, RIGHT? LIKE, THESE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING A BIT ABOUT HERE AND WHILE YOU ARE -- WHILE YOU ARE DOING IT NOW, IT'S WAY CHEAPER. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE NUMBERS FOR E.V. CHARGING. IT'S WAY CHEAPER TO LAY THE CONDUIT.
00:27:22.071: >> OH, YEAH.
00:27:23.672: >> Vice Chair Mills: WHILE YOU GOT THAT ALL RIPPED UP THAN TO TRY TO COME BACK AND FIGURE OUT WHERE TO PUT --
00:27:28.544: >> I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD DIALOGUE TO HAVE WITH ANY PETITIONER, JUST SO THEY ARE MINDFUL OF THESE STRATEGIES, SO THAT YOU DON'T -- TO CAM'S' POINT YOU DON'T HAVE TO RETROFIT BUILDINGS WHEN THEY ARE FIVE YEARS OLD.
00:27:42.257: >> YES THANKS.
00:27:45.961: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:27:47.329: >> Commissioner Briggs: A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING MADE FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY AND THE DESIGN EFFORTS AS WELL. ONE QUESTION JUST TO EDUCATE ME A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF YOU SAID IN THE REPORT THAT YOU CONSIDERED A GREEN ROOF BUT ULTIMATELY DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED THAT WAY. KIND OF WHAT GOES INTO THAT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS?
00:28:13.389: >> TYPICALLY FROM KIND OF AN ENGINEERING STANDPOINT, GREEN ROOFS ARE -- THERE'S' WHOLE'S AE SCALE WITH LEED AND THE IDEAS THAT COME WITH LEED AND THERE'S A HIERARCHY. SOME OF THEM ARE GREAT IDEAS. GREEN ROOFS ARE KIND OF AT THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVY. THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF MAINTENANCE. THEY OFTEN STRUGGLE TO STAY ALIVE. SO THERE'S JUST A -- AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN BETTER OVER THE YEARS. THEY WERE WAY WORSE TEN YEARS AGO. THE SOPHISTICATION LEVEL IS MUCH HIGHER THAN IT USED TO BE, BUT KIND OF BENEFIT THAT YOU GET FROM A GREEN ROOF IS NOT -- FOR YOUR MONEY IS NOT AS HIGH AS SOME OF THE HAD OTHER SUSTAINABLE CONCEPTS THAT YOU COULD INVEST IN AND SOME OF THOSE ARE MORE EFFICIENT MECHANICAL SYSTEMS, INSULATION.
00:29:01.837: >> BUT LET ME JUST ADD TO, THAT BECAUSE WE'RE -- I'M A CONTRACTOR.
00:29:06.375: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH.
00:29:07.009: >> AND WE DO A LOT OF SINGLE BUILDINGS. WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF LIVING ROOFS AND WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY EVEN BE OPPOSED TO THAT AS A STRATEGY. BUT THE CHALLENGE FOR CAM AND I, YOU KNOW, ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT KIND OF PRACTICAL R.O.I. CHALLENGE, THE BIGGER ISSUE IS THE VAST MAJ MAJORITY OF OUR TES ARE RESEARCH TENANTS, SOME ARE BIOTECH AND SOME ARE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PARTICULARLY WITH A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY TENANTS, WITH LIVING ROOFS, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN WITH MOISTURE INFILTRATION INTO THE BUILDING. AND SO, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE SINGLE -- CAM DEALS MORE WITH THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT ISSUES BUT ONE OF THE SINGLE BIGGEST TENANT CONCERNS IS WHAT KIND OF BUILDING ENERGY, PARTICULARLY ROOF SYSTEM, AND SO FORTH, ARE YOU GIVING US? YOU KNOW, TO WEIGH ANY POTENTIAL INFILTRATION ISSUES INTO THE BUILDING. AND TOM BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT IN TERMS OF THAT R.O.I. ANALYSIS, BUT REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE OWNERS' POINT OF VIEW, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD BE OPPOSED TO THAT INVESTMENT, BUT A LOT OF OUR TENANTS ARE. AND NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE ADVERSE TO GREEN ROOFS, BUT IT'S MORE OF A CONCERN OF MOISTURE INFILTRATION.
00:30:22.618: >> Commissioner Briggs: GOT IT. THANKS FOR THAT. AND THEN ONE PIECE, I'M SURE YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY MEETING OUR CODE. THE PIECE I DIDN'T SEE BUILT IN AROUND THE SPACE, GIVEN THE TYPES OF TENANTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE IS ANY SORT OF OUTDOOR SPACE FOR THE TENANTS TO GO TO.
00:30:38.600: >> SO OUR ORIGINAL PLAN HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN EXPANDED SCOPE BEYOND THIS BUILDING. YOU KNOW, WE WOULD ENVISION AT SOME POINT, MAYBE WITH THE ADJACENT LANDOWNER THAT EXISTS TODAY OF HAVING A CENTRAL SPOT, AND THE TENANTS COULD AGGREGATE AND STAY ON SITE AND NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO DRIVE OFFSITE CREATING TRAFFIC ISSUES AND THE LIKE. SO IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD ASPIRE TO, BUT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO INCORPORATE THAT PROBABLY IN POTENTIALLY A FUTURE PHASE AND/OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER THAT HAS THE VACANT LAND AROUND IT.
00:31:12.100: >> WE WOULD LOVE TO SOME PEDESTRIAN AREA OUT THERE AND SO FORTH.
00:31:17.072: >> Commissioner Briggs: EVEN JUST A NICE PLACE TO GO OUT, IF YOU ARE STARING AT YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN, IT'S NICE TO GO OUTSIDE AND SIT OUTSIDE THAT IS NOT A PARKING LOT.
00:31:28.884: >> FOR THOSE WHO KNOW THE SITE. IT'S THE MOST FORELORNE PARK AND IT'S NEVER GONE ANYWHERE AND THERE HAVE BEEN ARTICLES WRITTEN ABOUT IT. AND IT'S A -- THERE'S ONLY SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT. AND SO WE THINK WE'RE IMPROVING THE SITUATION SUBSTANTIALLY, YOU KNOW, WITH WHAT WE ARE CONTEMPLATING. WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO FILL IN ALL OF THOSE PIECES IN THE NEAR FUTURE, BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE ONE STEP  AT A TIME.
00:31:59.982: >> YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT, CAM AND I CUT OUR TEETH WITH THE AV IS FARMS DEVELOPMENT AND AT THE TIME THAT WAS BEING BUILT, THERE WERE STRATEGIES NOT REQUIRED BY CODE IN TERMS OF STORM WA WSTORMWATER RETENTION E PATHS AND ALL OF THAT. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO OBLIGATION TO BUILD THOSE THINGS, THEY ULTIMATELY TURNED INTO REALLY IMPORTANT TENANT AMENITIES THAT SOLE THE PARK. YOU KNOW, THEY WERE THE DIFFERENTIATOR COMPARED TO ALL THE REST OF THE INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN THAT CORRIDOR. SO WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT IF THERE'S JUST A SEA OF ASPHALT, THAT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY UNAPPEALING TO THE -- YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THE EMPLOYEES THAT WILL BE IN THE BUILDING. SO WE NEED TO KIND OF, YOU KNOW, PREP FOR AMENITIES ON SITE.
00:32:47.496: >> Commissioner Briggs: THANKS.
00:32:48.830: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:32:50.732: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WANT TO KEEP GOING ON THAT INTEREST PO. THAT WAS A LOT OF -- ON THAT POINT. THAT WAS A LOT OF WHAT I WROTE DOWN. THE TENANTS ARE DEMANDING HEALTHY BUILDING AND YOU MENTIONED DOOR QUALITY AND THERE'S ALSO BUILDINGS OR WORKPLACES THAT SUPPORT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OR COMMUNITY BASES. I WAS GOING TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT AN OUTDOOR SPACE. I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT IT.
00:33:11.920: >> AND WE'RE ENGAGING THE OTHER LANDOWNERS WITH THE PARK MORE OR LESS SAYING THIS PARK IS BROKEN. ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS OVERHAUL AND ADD SOME OF THESE AMENITIES.
00:33:25.167: >> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME AS AN OPPORTUNITY. COULD YOU CREATE A WALKING TRAIL AROUND ALL THREE OF THOSE BUILDINGS.
00:33:34.109: >> ABSOLUTELY.
00:33:34.476: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WOULD RECOMMEND IN THE INTERIM BECAUSE I'M SURE IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO COORDINATE IF YOU COULD PUT A COUPLE OF BENCHES OUTSIDE, I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE, LIKE, SOME SORT OF OUTDOOR SPACE. HAVING WORKED IN, LIKE, OFFICE BUILDINGS THAT GET REALLY COLD, IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GET OUTSIDE AND SIT FOR A FEW MINUTES TO WARM UP. EVEN JUST LIKE BENCHES WOULD BE GOOD.
00:33:53.328: >> AND WE DO FEEL THAT THIS BUILDING IS THE CATALYST FOR THAT ENTIRE PARK TO GO.
00:33:58.333: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH.
00:33:59.768: >> IF IT'S EVER GOING TO GO, IT'S RIGHT NOW, ROO EIGHT?
00:34:02.437: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: AND I THINK IT WILL BE. I LOVE THAT YOU PULLED IT UP TO THE STREET AND EXPANDING AND REDOING THAT SIDEWALK. AND I'M SEEING THAT SIDEWALK AND THEN THE GRAVEL, LIKE ACCESS DRIVE, JUST NATURALLY SORT OF SEEMS TO ME LIKE A START --
00:34:14.483: >> WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE ROAD IMPROVED IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING. [ LAUGHTER ]
00:34:18.286: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ALL OF US WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR ROADS IMPROVED.
00:34:22.290: >> REQUEST, REQUEST.
00:34:22.791: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ABOUT HEALTH CERTIFICATION FOR BUILDINGS LIKE FITWELL AND WELL.
00:34:29.064: >> SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME.
00:34:30.432: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: FITWELL IS A BUILDING CERTIFICATION SYSTEM, THEY ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THAT A NONPROFIT IN NEW YORK RECOMMENDS AND THE WELL CERTIFICATION AND THEY MAY LOOK INTO THAT AND GET FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES.
00:34:45.714: >> AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD PROACTIVELY DO AS WELL. I MEAN, TOM BROUGHT UP THE POINT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, KIND OF USING EVEN THOUGH THE LEED CERTIFICATION STANDARDS AS DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR THE BUILDINGS.
00:34:57.492: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH, FITWELL IS SOMETHING GOOD. FITWELL IS PRETTY GOOD WITH OFFICE SPACES. SO IT MIGHT BE -- AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, F-I-T-W-E-L-L. IT'S RUN BY THE CENTER FOR ACTIVE DESIGN IN NEW YORK. OH, THE ONLY OTHER THING, THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT COMES WHEN YOU ARE TALKING TO THE TENANTS, BUT I SAW THAT YOU HAD BIKE RACKS AND LIKE BIKE STORAGE, WHAT ABOUT LIKE A SHOWER FOR, YOU KNOW, LIKE PEOPLE COMMUTING TO WORK?
00:35:26.388: >> SO THAT GENERALLY BECOMES PART OF THE TENANTS REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. I WILL TELL YOU -- PRETTY MUCH IN TERMS OF THEIR PROGRAMS, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH A STANDARD REQUIREMENT NOW. YOU KNOW, A SHOWER, MAYBE EVEN A LOCKER FACILITY. YOU KNOW, WHAT WE ARE FINDING, IF YOU LOOK AT A CROSS SECTION OF OUR TENANTS RIGHT NOW, THAT NUMBER THAT WORKOUT AT LUNCH OR THAT BIKE TO WORK EVERY DAY WHEN THE WEATHER IS ACCEPTABLE AND SO FORTH, IT'S GROWING AND GROWING. SO THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, WORKING WITH VARIOUS ARCHITECTS TO KIND OF BUILD OUT A PROGRAM THAT'S ATTRACTIVE TO THEIR POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES.
00:36:06.728: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: AND RENTS INCREASE.
00:36:08.263: >> IT'S THE SINGLE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE TENANTS HAVE IS RECRUITING AND TRAINING EMPLOYEES AND THESE STRATEGIES ARE CRITICAL.
00:36:17.606: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH. THEY ARE DIFFERENTIATORS. OKAY. COOL. THANKS.
00:36:22.844: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:36:23.912: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ON THAT NOTE AND THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR STAFF. ONE THING AS SOMEBODY WHO BIKES AROUND A LOT, THIS STRETCH BETWEEN EISENHOWER AND RESEARCH PARK DRIVE, YOU HAVE A REALLY NICE WAY, ALL ALONG STATE STREET, THERE'S BIKE LANES, ALL THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN YOU HIT THAT INTERSECTION AND IT IS NO MAN'S LAND, SCARY TERRITORY, BECAUSE OF THE HIGHWAY AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING. AND I BIKE ALL OVER AND I BIKED IT ONCE AND I'M LIKE I'M NEVER DOING THAT AGAIN. I FELT COMPLETELY VULNERABLE THERE. THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM BUT WHAT I'M WONDERING IS FROM PERHAPS EVEN COMMISSIONER WOODS OR MR. CHANG, TO HEAR ABOUT -- IF THERE ARE ANY PLANS AFOOT IN TERMS OF THAT SECTION OF STATE. BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN STUDIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE, AND I THINK THAT THIS --
00:37:12.861: >> WE HAPPEN TO HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON IN THE ROOM HERE. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING -- MARK -- YEAH. MARK HAS BEEN REALLY SPEARHEADING. THIS IS GOING ON FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS AND WE HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT EFFORT WITH MARK, BUT TRYING TO SPEAR HEAD REALLY A CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PRO E SIS. ONE, IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE FOR PEDESTRIANS AND BIKERS THAT IS VERY CONCERNING. AND THE SECOND, IT'S AN IMAGE ISSUE. WE HAVE HEARD IT AGAIN AND AGAIN, PARTICULARLY FROM OUR TENANTS THAT THIS IS THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. WHEN YOU EXIT OFF OF 94 ON TO STATE STREET, YOU SHOULD FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE ARRIVED SOME PLACE VERY SPECIAL, LIKE AS THOUGH YOU SHOWED UP IN PALO ALTO, OR WHEREVER. AND THAT JUST -- YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THAT. I DON'T WANT TO STEAL YOUR THUNDER BUT MARK HAS ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING -- AND WE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTED TO AND GOTTEN SOME FUNDING FOR STUDIES BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS TO THIS POINT.
00:38:09.084: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IF YOU COULD TELL US MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW AND PERHAPS IF THERE'S ANY WISDOM ON THIS END OF THE TABLE TOO, IN TERMS OF OTHERS --
00:38:16.191: >> SO IN ANN ARBOR, I'M PRIMARILY IN THE B2B WORK AND THE GREAT LAKES TRAIL NORTH OF HERE, BUT YOU MENTIONED EISENHOWER OR ELLSWORTH? ELLSWORTH ON --
00:38:29.971: >> FROM EISENHOWER SOUTH.
00:38:32.007: >> FROM EISENHOWER TO ELLSWORTH.
00:38:33.908: >> OTHER THAN THE STATE STREET IMPROVEMENT CORRIDOR DOWN THROUGH THERE THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT AND APPLIED FOR FUNDING.
00:38:42.984: >> AND SPARK AS WELL. SO PHIL SANDTER FROM SPARK HAS TAKEN THIS ON AS A PERSONAL MISSION AND HE'S PULLED TOGETHER LIKE, MARK, CAM, MYSELF, AND PROBABLY HALF A DOZEN MAJOR PROPERTY OWNERS ON THAT CORRIDOR, AND SPARK IS TRYING TO INITIATE KIND OF COORDINATED STRATEGY OF, OKAY, INCLUDING ENGAGING IN THE UNIVERSITY AS WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO HERE? THE CHALLENGE IS, MOST OF THE PROPERTY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IN RIGHT-OF-WAYS AND THINGS THAT WE DON'T CONTROL, BUT THEY ARE REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE SUCCESS OF ALL THE PROJECTS AROUND THERE.
00:39:19.921: >> AND THEN YOU HAVE TWO MUNICIPALITIES AT THE SAME TIME AS WELL. SO IT'S AN ISSUE.
00:39:23.391: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT'S RIGHT.
00:39:25.560: >> BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU, THAT ACCESSIBILITY, ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE FREEWAY NEEDS TO HAPPEN.
00:39:31.132: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEAH.
00:39:32.367: >> AND ALL THE WAY TO ELLSWORTH.
00:39:34.169: >> IT'S A STRUGGLE.
00:39:35.136: >> WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE STATE STREET IMPROVED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MICHIGAN AVENUE, BUT THAT'S A 30-YEAR MISSION THAT'S NEVER BEEN ACCOMPLISHED EITHER.
00:39:43.678: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT. I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS FOR ANY PUSHING, NUDGING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN -- FROM MANY PARTS OF TOWN, YOU CAN MAKE IT REALLY CLOSE BUT THAT LAST STRETCH IS ROUGH! AND I THINK THAT YOU ARE RIGHT, THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WORKING IN A PLACE LIKE THAT AND ATTRACT PEOPLE AND KEEP PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, GIVING THEM OPTIONS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING. AND SO THE PORE THAT WE CAN TRY TO BE ABLE TO PUSH THAT PROCESS ALONG AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THAT FITS RIGHT IN ALL OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS. YEAH, KEEP IT GOING AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO ADD FROM THIS CITY'S END IN TERMS OF PERPLANS YOU NO HE THAT MAY BE AFOOT IN TERMS OF SOUTH STATE.
00:40:34.763: >> YEAH, SO THE NON-MOTORIZED PLAN RECOMMENDS SIDEWALKS ALONG RESEARCH PARK DRIVE WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED ON THIS DEVELOPMENT. THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN BEING THE SHORT-TERM RECOMMENDATION PROPOSED INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS AT STATES AND ELLSWORTH WHICH THEY HAVE ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTED A ROUND ABOUT. SO THEY MET THE SHORT-TERM. BUT AS FAR AS THE MIDTERM RECOMMENDATIONS, THEY PROPOSE A TRAFFIC COURT OR A STUDY ALONG STATE STREET BETWEEN EISENHOWER AND ELLSWORTH AND THE LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATION PROPOSES INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS NORTH AND SOUTH OF I-94 SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, COMMISSIONER GIBBS RANDALL. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHEN DO WE HAVE THE FUNDS AB THE TIME AND MOVE FORWARD.
00:41:13.568: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND I KNOW IF -- IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, THAT'S PART OF OUR POTENTIAL DESIGN CORRIDOR AS WELL, AND IF THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE PROGRAM, THEN IT SEEMS LIKE PROVIDING REAL ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION OPPORTUNITIES NOT JUST IN NAME, BUT IN ACTION FOR BIKERS, WALKERS, WHATEVER IT IS, THAT THAT REALLY, I THINK, NEEDS TO -- THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS COVALENCING HERE.
00:41:44.165: >> WE ARE HEARING IT LOUD AND CLEAR FROM THE TENANTS AND THEY REALLY -- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IN A PERFECT WORLD, THEY ALL WANT TO BE IN DOWNTOWN NASH ANN ARBOR FA PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU HAVE A 50,000 SQUARE FOOT USER, THEY WANT TO COME AS CLOSE TO THAT POSSIBILITY AS THEY CAN. IN TERMS OF URBAN DENSITY AND BIKE LANES AND NOT HAVING TO JUMP IN A VEHICLE AND DRIVE SOMEWHERE TO GO TO LUNCH.
00:42:11.759: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT.
00:42:12.760: >> SO THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE KIND OF IN OUR MASTER PLAN, I GUESS BEYOND THIS BUILDING BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGING ALL THE OTHER PROPERTY OWNERS IN THAT PARK AND TRYING TRYING TO ASQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES WITH BEING MINDFUL OF THAT. OUR END GAME IS REALLY TO CONVERT THAT FROM A SUBURBAN INDUSTRIAL PARK MODEL SO MORE OF SOMETHING THAT MORE REFLECT ARES KIND OF A WALKABLE URBAN EXPERIENCE.
00:42:40.154: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: GREAT.
00:42:41.122: >> IT'S A LONG PROCESS.
00:42:42.390: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WE TOTALLY GET THAT.
00:42:44.459: >> BUT ANY ADVOCACY, ANY HELP THAT WE COULD GET FROM THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED.
00:42:55.336: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:42:56.337: >> Vice Chair Mills: THIS IS A QUICK FOLLOW-UP. IF THAT'S IN YOUR LONG-TERM VISION, DOES OUR CURRENT ZONING IN THAT AREA SUPPORT THAT IDEA OF THIS AS A WALKABLE INDUSTRIAL PARK?
00:43:06.848: >> I THINK -- I THINK SO. I MEAN, I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR ZONING, RELATIVE TO, SAY, EVEN PITSFIELD TOWNSHIP,  IT PROVIDES GREATER DENSITY AND THE POSITIONING OF THE BUILDINGS AND SO FORTH. I THINK IT CREATES A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A KIND OF URBAN ARCHITECTURE THAN THE TRADITIONAL SUBURBAN ARCHITECTURE, WHERE YOU HAVE -- I MEAN WHEN WE FIRST STARTED DOING BUILDINGS IN AVIS FARMS, LIKE, THE FLOOR-TO-AREA RATIOS, THE LOT COVERAGE WAS 10% OR 15%. IT'S KIND OF CRIMINAL THAT YOU HAD ALL OF THIS LAND, YOU ARE BUILDING ALL OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN YOU ARE NOT PUTTING ANY DENSITY ON THE LAND THAT YOU HAVE IMPROVED. THAT, I THINK, YOU HAVE DRAMATICAALLY CHANGED THAT STRATEGY.
00:43:57.598: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOOD. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING WHERE OUR CODE IS NOT GIVING US -- THERE COULD BE MARKET FORCES, YOU KNOW, AND SOME OF THIS JUST TAKES TIME. THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT, BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GOES TOWARDS WHAT A LOT OF OUR MASTER PLANS ARE CALLING FOR. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST HELPFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ZONING IS SUPPORTING WHAT THE MASTER PLAN CALLS FOR AND WHAT THE VISION OF FOLKS IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU KNOW.
00:44:26.060: >> AND, I MEAN, JUST KIND OF GLOBALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE SOME OF THESE THINGS TOO, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS IF YOU KIND OF COMPARE ANN ARBOR TO THE SURROUNDING MUNICIPALITIES, ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE COST IN TERMS OF LIKE, SEWER WATER CONNECTION FEES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, I THINK HAVE EATEN UP BUDGETS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GO TO PARK AMENITIES. I MEAN, THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT, BUT EVERYBODY ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THOSE AMENITIES, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE THEM, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET TENANTS AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
00:45:03.097: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:45:05.166: >> Commissioner Briggs: ANOSMIA ONESMALL REQUEST WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF SOME FREE TIME. GIVEN THE THINGS YOU SAID TONIGHT, I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO JUST WRITE A GENERAL LETTER ABOUT KIND OF YOUR THOUGHTS FOR THE CORRIDOR OR THE DESIRE TO SEE AMENITIES IMPROVE ALONG STATE STREET.
00:45:32.260: >> I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT.
00:45:33.961: >> Commissioner Briggs: I KNOW WE ARE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THAT. I'M ON THE TRANSPORTATION ADVOCACY AND IT'S A LONG TIME, BUT WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF JUST -- JUST BLUNTLY, WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF PUSHBACK ABOUT THE BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN IMPROVEMENTS ESPECIALLY ON CORRIDORS. THIS IS SEEN AS AN AUTOCENTRIC, CARRY CORRIDOR. THERE ARE NOT ANY IMPROVEMENTS ANTICIPATED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, BUT I WOULD -- IT WOULD JUST BE HELPFUL FOR, I THINK, OUR CITY COUNCIL TO RECOGNIZE --
00:46:04.258: >> SHOULD WE ADDRESS THAT TO CHRIS?
00:46:06.761: >> Commissioner Briggs: I WOULD LOVE IF YOU WROTE IT TO CITY COUNCIL AT LARGE AND COPIED THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AS WELL. IT'S UP TO YOU, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NOT NOW. IN THE FUTURE SOMETIME.
00:46:18.606: >> I CAN TELL YOU --
00:46:20.475: >> Commissioner Briggs: PAST THIS PROJECT.
00:46:21.976: >> WE WERE SORT OF INITIAL MEMBERS OF THIS STATE STREET CORRIDOR PROGRAM THAT THE SPARK GUYS PUT TOGETHER AND IT'S -- IT'S A BIG ISSUE. WE HAVE A HUGE INVESTMENT UP AND DOWN STATE STREET. NOW WE ARE COMING INTO ANN ARBOR FROM MOSTLY PITTSFIELD AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THE DYNAMIC OF THE PRODUCT TYPE IN PITTSFIELD. SORRY. YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW THE AVAILABLE DEMAND OPPORTUNITIES.
00:46:51.072: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH.
00:46:52.073: >> BUT STATE STREET FROM, YOU KNOW, EITHER NORTH OR SOUTH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT INTERSECTION.
00:46:58.880: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH.
00:46:59.514: >> WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY. BUT YOU DON'T WANT US TO ADDRESS IT SPECIFICALLY TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION?
00:47:05.486: >> Commissioner Briggs: JUST -- IT'S NOT -- YEAH, IT'S NOT A BIG RUSH. IT'S NOT A BIG RUSH. JUST THE THOUGHT THAT I THINK SOME OF THESE IDEAS CURRENTLY ARE PERCEIVED AS -- AS JUST COMING FROM -- YOU KNOW, COMING FROM AN ADVOCACY COMMUNITY OF BICYCLISTS AND IT WOULD BE NICE FOR SOME FOLKS TO HEAR THAT IT'S OF INTEREST TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. SO NO RUSH. JUST A THOUGHT.
00:47:31.946: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ]
00:47:41.222: >> Commissioner Sauve: THE CONVERSATION ABOUT MIXED USE RAISES WHAT WE PREVIOUSLY PASSED FOR RESTAURANTS ON OFFICE DISTRICTS. NOW THIS IS FOR RESEARCH AND ADJACENT TO O.R.L., IT WOULD BE INTERESTING FOR COMMISSIONER PROPOSED BUSINESS THAT WE START LOOKING AT THOSE ZONING DISTRICTS FOR THAT IP TYPE OF MD USE. IT'S INTERESTING TO GET YOUR FEEDBACK AS YOU LOOK AT THIS SITE AS A WHOLE, HOW WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO EVALUATE A SMALL PERCENTAGE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A RESTAURANT DISTRICT BUT TO MAKE IT MIXED USE AND WALKABLE COMMUNITIES. JUST THIS CONVERSATION RAISES THAT. SO GETTING YOUR FEEDBACK, AS YOU PROGRESS, IT MIGHT BE ON OUR AGENDA TO LOOK AT.
00:48:24.198: >> YES, WE ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT. AND AS YOU KNOW, WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW, PARTICULARLY WITH THE LARGER TENANTS IS THEY ARE PROVIDING ALMOST THEIR OWN FOOD SERVICE OPERATION, YOU KNOW, IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR SPACE, BUT AS EVERYBODY SAID, WHEN YOU GO TO WORK, YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO TO THAT CAFETERIA-TYPE EXPERIENCE. YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS MORE ORGANIC EXPERIENCE OUT AT THE FOOD TRUCKS OR WHEREVER.
00:48:45.987: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THE FOOD TRUCKS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, BUT IT MIGHT BE IF YOU HAD A COFFEE SHOP AS A TENANT THAT ALL THE OTHER TENANTS COULD BE SERVICED FOR A RESTAURANT. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE WITHIN A TENANT SPACE TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, PRIVATE SERVICE. SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING AS WE START LOOKING AT THESE RESEARCH PARKS AS THEIR OWN MIXED USE AMENITY COMPLEXES, SOMETHING TO LOOK AT.
00:49:08.709: >> IN THE TWO NEW HOTEL FACILITIES THAT ARE KIND OF THE GATEWAY INTO THIS PARK AS WELL, HAS PART OF THAT APPROVAL. THEY HAVE THE ANNEX BUILDING THAT'S THERE AS WELL. AND I THINK WITH THAT, IT WAS TO CREATE THAT TYPE OF EXPERIENCE AND WE'RE HOPING TO BENEFIT FROM THAT AS WELL.
00:49:28.529: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS?
00:49:29.897: >> Commissioner Woods: SO WHILE WE'RE GIVING YOU HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS -- [ LAUGHTER ] NO, JUST KIDDING. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW AS YOU TALK ABOUT WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO ALONG THAT WHOLE STATE STREET CORRIDOR AND YOU MAY HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAS ALSO BEEN A PARTNER AT THE TABLE. I'M NOT SURE, BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT. AS I VISION WHERE YOU ARE, CERTAINLY THE U OF M BUSES GO DOWN AS FAR AS I GUESS EISENHOWER AND TURN AROUND AT WOLVERINE TOWER AND THEN GO BACK. AND WE KNOW THAT THEY CARRY A LOT OF PASSENGERS. SOMEHOW HAVING A BUS THAT ACTUALLY COMES DOWN INTO YOUR AREA GIVEN THAT YOU ARE DOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND YOU MAY BE -- THERE MAY SOMEBODY OPPORTUNITIES WORKING WITH FOLKS UP AT THE MAIN
