00:02:26.991: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU, MR. FOURNIER WE ARELL DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU. SO, RESUMING A PRACTICE WE HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED WHEN IN CHAMBERS, WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET DONE PREVIOUSLY BY ZOOM, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A COUPLE OF INTRODUCTIONS FROM COMMUNITY GROUPS. FIRST, WE HAVE THE SEPTEMBER 2020 CONSTITUTION WEEK PRLAMATION. I UNDERSND THAT WE HE REPRENTATIVES HE TODAY, A I WOULD LIKE TO READ THE PROCLAMATION AND THEN TURN THE FLOOR OVER. BEFORE DOING SO, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY MYSELF A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CONSTITUTION WEEK. IT IS, OF COURSE, I THINK RIGHT, FITTING AND PROPER THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THE CONSTITUTION. IT IS THE DOCUMENT THAT FOUNDS OUR COUNTRY. IT WAS AT E TIME OF COURSE IF I ROLLECT CORRECTLY, THE FIRST WRITTEN CONSTITUTION AND CARRIES WITHIN IT THE EXPRESSION OF RIGHTS WHICH WERE THEN AND REMAIN, YOU KNOW, LAUDABLE AND FUNDAMENTAL TO CIVIL SOCIETY. I THINK IT ALSO IS IMPORTANT THAT WE, AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR CONSTUTION, RECOGNIZE THAT AT THE TIME AND FOR MANY YEARS THEREAFTER, AND CONTINUING ON IN ITS EXPRESSION, YOU KNOW, THAT IT WAS -- THAT THE CONSTITUTION [ OFF MIC ] SLAVERY AND WAS A DOCUMENT THAT WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON QUITE FAMOUSLY DESCRIBED AS COVENANT WITHHELL. REFLECTED THE WHITE SUPREMACY THAT WAS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FOUNDING OF THE COUNTRY. IT CONTAINS WITHIN IT SEVERAL COUNTERMAJORTARIAN ELEMENTS, THE MATTER IN WHICH WE ALLOCATE DISTRICTS AMONG CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES, THE MANNER IN ICH WE ALLOCATE SENATORS, AND, OF COURSE, FAMOUSLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL ELECTIONS, THE WAY THAT WE ELECT THE PRESIDENT, THAT SAY TO SAY BY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. THE CONSTITUTION IS THE DOCUMENT AT THE BASE OF OUR COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT. IT IS A DOCUMENT THAT IS CAPABLE OF CHANGE, AND WE KNOW TT WE AL LOOK RWARD IO WHAT IS INDEED MORE PERFECT UNION, AND THE CONSTITUTION IS THE STRUCTURE BY WHICH WE'LL ULTIMATELY GET THERE. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO READ THE PROCLAMATION FOR CONSTITUTION WEEK. WHEREAS, SEPTEMBER 17, 2020, MARKS THE 233RD DRAFTING OF THE CONSTUTION OF THENITED ATES OF AMERA BY CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, AND WHEREAS IT'S FITTING TO RECOGNIZE THE ENDURING DOCUMENT ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF ITS CREATION, AND WHEREAS THE PUBLIC WILL GUARANTEE THE PROCLAMATION EACH YEAR BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER -23r A COTITUTION WEEK,THEREFORE, I, CHSTOPHER TAYLOR, MAYOR OF ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, DO HEREBY PROCLAIM SEPTEMBER 17TH-23rd 2020 AS CONSTITUTION WEEK AND ENCOURAGE ALL RESIDENTS TO TAKE NOTE OF THE OBSERVANCE. MS. CLARK, THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
00:05:40.884: >> YES. THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. THANK YOU FOR THE PROCLAMATION, AND I ALSOANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK COUNCILMEMBERUMM FOR HELPING US ARRANGE FOR THIS OBSERVANCE. I AM SHARON CLARK, AS INT INTRODUCED. I'M A MEMBER OF THE SARA CASWELL ANGEL CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN DAUGHTERS OF THE REVOLUTION. DAR IS A NONPFIT, NONPOLITICAL VOLUNTEER SERVICE ORGANIZATION. OUR MISSION IS THREEFOLD. IT'S TO PROMOTE HISTORICAL PRESERVATION, EDUCATION, AND PATRIOTISM. TO THAT END, EVERY YEAR, WE PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE THE CELEBRATION OF CONSTITUTION WEEK. THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO APPRECIATE OUR CONSTUTN AND CELEBRATE I. I WILL MENTION TWO AMONG THOSE. IT HAS ENDURED FOR 233 YEARS AND PROVIDED THE STRUCTURE FOR OUR FEDERAL STATE FORM OF SELF-GOVERNANCE, THROUGHOUT WARS, SOCIAL UPHEAVAL, TERRORIST ATTACKS AND EVEN PANDEMICS. SECOND, THE FRAMERS DID HAVE THE FORESIGHT TO PROVIDE FOR AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SINCE 1787, WIKIPEDIA INFORMS ME THAT 11,000 AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. MOST HAVE DIED IN COMMITTEE 33 HAVE MADE IT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE STATES FOR RATIFICATION, BUT ONLY 27 HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN RAT RATIFIED. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS ARE THE 13th AMENDMENT, WHICH ABOLISHED SLAVERY, THE 14th AND 15th AMENDMENTS,HICH EXTENDECIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING TO MALE PERSONS, AND THE 19th AMENDMENT, WHICH EXTENDED THE RIGHT TO VOTE TO WOMEN, WHICH WE ARE CELEBRATING THIS YEAR AS IT'S CENTENARY. AS PART OF THIS CELEBRATION, I RE-READ T CONSTITUTION, ALONG ND WITH ALL OF THE 27 AMENDMENTS. AND THIS EVENING, I WOULD LIKE US TO CELEBRATE THE CONSTITUTION AND ASK OUR FELLOW CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR TO JOIN US IN CELEBRATING IT THROUGHOUT BE,  CRSE, THE 1h-23rd,H WILL AND I ANK YOU.
00:08:22.713: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. FOURNIER, THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
00:08:30.687: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR. I WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE A PRESENTATION TO TENTATIVE REEMENT WITHHE ANNTO ARBOR POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WILL RECALL IN JUNE THAT THE POLICE CONTRACT WAS ON CITY COUNCIL'S AGENDA AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT MONTH, AND ON CITY COUNCIL'S INSTRUCTION, WE WENT BACK TO RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL, AND SO WE MET TH THE POLE UON ON JULY 29TH ANALSO AUGUST 19TH, AND WE WERE ABLE TO REACH A NEW TENTATIVE AGREEMENT, YOU KNOW, LANGUAGE OF THE CONTRACT WAS WRITTEN, TOWARD THE END OF AUGUST, SHARED WITH THE UNION THEN, AND WE HAVE BEEN BRIEFING CITY COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL BUDGET AND LABOR COMMITTEE ON THE 31st, IEFED ON SEPTEER 1ST,ND OC WERE THAT IWHAT BRINGS U HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF COUNCIL. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE NEW CONCESSIONS AND ECONOMIC CONCESSIONS THAT ARE A PART OF THIS NEW AGREEMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNION ON THE USE OF PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE. IN THIS TENTATIVE AGREEMENT, THE CITY AEED TO GIVE THE POLICE CHIEF THE RIGHT TO WAIVE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE FOR MAJOR DISCIPLINE TYPES, INCLUDING EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE, MISHANDLING OF A WEAPON AND MISHANDLING OF EVIDENCE. IF THE CHIEF DOES CHOOSE TO USE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE FOR THIS TYPE OF MISCONDUCT, THE CHIEF HAS A FOUR-YEAR WINDO TO LOOK BACK IN THE DISCIPLINARY RECORD OF AN OFFICER. RIGHT NOW, IN THE EXISTING CONTRACT, IT'S A TWO-YEAR WINDOW. SO IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY ALREADY STATES THAT TERMINATION IS THE PRESUMED DISCIPLINE WHEN IT IS FOUND THAT AN OFFICER HAS INTENTIONALLY LIED IN A STATEMENT OR A DOCUMENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO, THIS IS PRETTY MAJOR REFORMO PROGRESVE DISCIPLINE IN THE POLICE CONTRACT. ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT COUNCIL INSTRUCTED US TO NEGOTIATE WAS THE DISCLOSURE OF POLICE PERSONNEL INFORMATION TO ICPOC. I DO WANT TO REPORT THAT THE UNION DECLINED TO BARGAIN ON ANY PROPOSAL RELATED TOETNG RECORDS. EW POLIC PERSONN THE CITY BELIEVES THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS FOR THIS ISSUE MOVING FORWARD THAT MIGHT HELP RESOLVE IT IN THE MEDIUM TERM. I WANT TO POINT OUT WE DO THINK WE HAVE THE LEGAL ABILITY TO DISCLOSE POLICE OFFICER NAMES THROUGH THE F.O.I.A. PROCESS. HOWEVER, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO USE THIS POWER AND USE THIS PROCESS AS PART OF A STRATEGY TO GET A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE SOLUTION WITH THE UNION AT A FUTURE DATE. SO, THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION FOR THE COUNCIL ON IN THE FUTURE, BUT IT IS NOT ACTUALLY A PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE UNION ALSO AGREED TO FORM A COMMITTEE TO WORK ON A PROPOSAL TO REFORM BINDING DISCIPLINARY ARBITRATION, AND THAT IS PART OF THIS CURRENT TENTATIVE AGREEMENT. YOU KNOW, THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE TO A LAYPERSON, BUT WHEN YOU COME TO THESE KIND OF AGREEMENTS, BOTH THE UNION AND THE CITY ARE REQUIRED TO MEET AND BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH, AND HAVING DISCUSSED THIS ISS WITH TH UNN, I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING IDEAS TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO BINDING DISCIPLINARY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGR AGREEMENT. SO, WE BELIEVE THERE MAY BE A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE PATH FORWARD, BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO HOLD UP THE REST OF THIS AGREEMENT TALKING ABOUT THIS ONESSUE THAT CAN GETRETTY COMPLICAT D WHERE THE NOTIATIONS COULD DRAG ON FOR A WHILE, SO WE AGREED TO SIDE-BAR IT AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TENTATIVE AGREEMENT. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE UNION ASKED FOR, UNDER THE CURRENT AGREEMENT, THE UNION HAS THE ABILITY TO BANK UP TO 160 HOURS OF COMP TIME, AND ANYTHING THEY OUT ON A QRTERLY BASISN CASH THEY HAVE ASKED FOR THE RIGHT TO CASH THAT COMP TIME OUT ON A MONTHLY BASIS. WE AGREED TO THIS. IT HAS NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE CITY. IT DOESN'T CHANGE A POLICE OFFICER'S ABILITY TO ACCRUE COMP TIME. IT JUST ALLOWS THEM TO CASH IT OUT ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS. THE NAME OF THE EQUIPMENT AND CELL PHONE ALLOWANCE, TO JUST CALL IT AN EQUIPMENT ALLOWANCE. AGAIN, THIS HAS NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE CITY, AND WE DID KEEP IN THE CONTRACT A STATEMENT THAT SAYS POLICE OFFICERS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO ANSWER THEIR CELL PHONES FOR WORK PURPOSES, AND SO WE AGREED TO MAKE THAT CHANGE. ANOTHER CHANGE IS USUALLY WHEN WE COME TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, THE UNION RATIFIES THE AGREEMENT FIRST AND THEN IT COMES TO CNSEL. GIVEN THA THE COUNCIL DOWN VOTED THE FIRST AGREEMENT, WE WOULD ASK THE UNION TO BE THE FIRST BODY THAT RATIFIES. SO WE AGREED TO DO THAT. WE ARE BRINGING THE AGREEMENT FORTH TO CITY COUNCIL AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING. THE CONTRACT WILL BE PUBLIC WHEN THE AGENDA FOR THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING IS PUBLISHED LATER THIS WEEK, AND SO IT'LL BE OHE AGENDA FOR SEPTEMBER 21ST, AND AFTER CITY COUNCIL, SHOULD CITY COUNCIL RATIFY THE AGREEMENT, THEN THE UNION WILL BE REQUIRED TO HOLD A VOTE ON THE AGREEMENT BY OCTOBER 19TH. AND SO TAKEN TOGETHER, ADDING THIS ON TO THE PRIOR TENTATIVE AGREEMEN THIS IS WT THE WHOL DEAL LOOKS LIKE. THE CHIEF GAINS NEAR COMPLETE CONTROL OVER TRAINING, WHICH WE THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONC CONCESSION. THE CHIEF WILL GAIN COMPLETE CONTROL OVER SPECIALTY ASSIGNMENTS, THE TYPE OF SPECIALTY TRAININGS AND ASSIGNMENTS THAT POLICE OFFICERS GET, A THE CHIEF BEING ABLE TO HAND THOSE OUT AT HIS OR HER DISCRETION IS IMPORTANT FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING PURPOSES. WE GOT SOME POWERS ON DISCIPLINE. THE CHIEF MAY NOW SUSPEND AN OFFICER WITHOUT PAY FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS. IN THE CURRENT CONTRACT THAT IS IN EFFECT RIGHT NOW, THE CHIEF ONLY CAN DO THAT FOR FIVE WEEKS, AND THE CHIEF MAY ALSO EEND NEW OFFICER'S PROTIONARY PERIOD BY UP TO SIX MONTHS. SO IF WE HA AN OFFICER WHO WE WANT TO MAYBE EVALUATE A LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE THEY BECOME FULL-FLEDGED EMPLOYEE OF THE CITY, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCALE THAT BY UP TO SIX MONTHS IN ANY AMOUNT IN BETWEEN, SO THAT THE CHIEF CAN FURTHER EVALUATE. AND THEN, IN ADDITION TO THAT, OF COURS WE HAVE THE CONCESSIONS AT WE GOT INHIS LATEST ROUND OF BARGAINING. THE CHIEF MAY WAIVE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE. HE MAY EXTEND PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE TIMELINES TO FOUR YEARS FROM TWO YEARS FOR MAJOR DISCIPLINE, AND THE UNION AND THE CITY AGREE TO CONNUE BAAINING ON AN ALTERNATIVE TO BINDING ARBITRATION FOR DISCIPLINARY PURPOSES. IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC IMPACTS, THIS IS A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT STILL, WHICH IS A STANDARD CONTRACT LENGTH FOR THE CITY. AAPOA MEMBERS ARE RETAINING A 2.5% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR EACH YEAR OF THE CONTRACT. WE ARE ALSO EXTENDING OUR 12-WEEK PAID PENTAL LEAVE POLICY TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS A BENEFIT THAT NON-UNION EMPLOYEES GET AND THAT WE ARE OFFERING TO OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS. THAT'S AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR MEMBS OF THE COLLECTIV BARGAINING UNIT, BUT IT'S A BENEFIT FOR THE ENTIRE CITY AND ENTIRE ORGANIZATION. AND WE ARE ALSO INCREASING BOTH THE UNIFORM ALLOWANCE AND THE EQUIPMENT ALLOWANCE BY A HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH FOR EACH MEMBER. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PROVIDE FOR UNIFORM AND EQUIPMENT ALLOWANCES REALLY ONLY COVERS A FCTION OF THE COS THAT OICERS PAY OUT OF POCKET, AND SO THIS AMOUNT ALSO HASN'T BEEN INCREASED IN QUITE SOME TIME. I THINK IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A DECADE SINCE THESE ALLOWANCES HAVE BEEN INCREASED, SO WE AGREED TO INCREASE THEM. SO, I ALSO WANT TO TAKE JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES AND WALK CALLED CHECKTHEPOLICE.ORG, WHICH KIND OF HAS SIX CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING POLICE UNION CONTRACTS. I KNOW A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WERE DISCUSSING THE STANDARD IN JUNE, WHEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT WAS PUT FORTH, AND SO I WANTED TO KIND OF STEP THROUGH THOSE SIX CRITERIA BRIEFLY AND DISCUSS HOW OUR NTRACT HANDL EACH OF THE SO, THE FIRST STANDARD THAT CHECKTHEPOLICE.ORG TALKS ABOUT, THEY SAY THAT A CONTRACT SHOULD NOT ALLOW FOR THE DISMISSAL OF A WHEN I TAKES TOO MANY DAYS TO T COMPLE. OUR CONTRACT ALLOWS US TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL INSTANCES OF MISCONDUCT AT ANY TIME, AS LONG AS WE NOTIFY THE UNION MEMBER THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS HAPPENING WITHIN 21 DAYS OF US BECOMING AWARE OF IT. NOT WITHIN 21 DAYS OF IT HAPPENING. AND EVEN THEN, IF WE FEEL THAT INFORMING THE OFFER WOULD JEOPARDIZEHE INVESTIGION, WE DON'T HAVE TO INFORM THEM THAT IT'S HAPPENING. THE CONTRACT ALSO SAYS THAT WE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION IN 14 DAYS, BUT IN REALITY, IF WE NEED MORE TIME, THE CITY MAY EXTEND THE INVESTIGATION TIMELINE AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IF MORE TIME IS NEEDED. AND SO WE REALLY HAVE BROAD FLEXIBILITY THROUHE CONTRACT TO INVESTITE MISCONDUC COMPLAINTS, AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE DO SUBSTANTIALLY MEET THIS FIRST STANDARD OF THE CHECKTHEPOLICE.ORG RECOMMENDATIONS. THE SECOND STANDARD THAT THE ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDS IS THE CONTRACT SHOULD NOT PREVENT POLICE OFFICERS FROM BEING INTEOGED IMMEDTELY AFTER BEING INVOLVED IN ANNCIDENT O OTHERWISE RESTRICTING HOW, WHERE, OR WHEN THEY CAN BE INTERROGATED. OUR CONTRACT SAYS THAT IF AN OFFICER IS INVOLVED IN A MISCONDUCT INCIDENT, THEY ARE TAKEN BACK TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT RIGHT AWAY, AND THEY ARE SUBJECT TO INTERVIEW IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT, AND THAT IS -- THAT'S ALSO IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICIES AND  OUR PRACTICE AND OUR POLICIES HERE ARE VERY STRONG IN THAT REGARD. IT IS WORTH NOTING ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE CITY, AND NOT JUST POLICE OFFICERS, HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED GARRITY RIGHTS, WHICH ARE 5th SELF-INCRINATION. GAINST R PUBLIC PLOYEES, THEARE NFERRED BY THE COURT. ANY EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY AN EMPLOYEE IN A DISCIPLINE REVIEW PROCESS CANNOT BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT. THAT CANNOT BE BARGAINED AWAY IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. T OUR ALITY TO REVIEW, WE DO THAT, THE CONTRACT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT, OUR CITY POLICIES ALLOW US TO DO THAT, SO WE THINK THAT WE SUBSTANTIALLY MEET THIS STANDARD. CHECKTHEPOLICE.ORG ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT THE CONTRACT SHOULD NOT ALLOW OFFICERS TO ACCESS INFORMATION THAT CIVILIANS DO NOT GET PRIOR TO BEG TERROGED. R PRACTIC IN THE DARTMENT IS THAT -- I'LL START WITH THE CONTRACT LANGUAGE. THE CONTRACT SAYS THAT OFFICERS WILL BE ABLE TO REVIEW RECORDS, BUT OUR PRACTICE AND OUR POLICY IS THAT THEY ONLY GET TO SEE THEIR OWN BODY CAM FOOTAGE AND POLICE REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE AUTHORED TO REFRESH THE MEMORY OF T EVENTS. SO THEY N'T GET ACCES TO OTHER OFFICERS' BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE OR OTHER INVESTIGATORY DETAILS. AN ARBITRATOR WILL OFTEN COMPEL THE CITY TO MAKE THOSE DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE AS PART OF AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING, AND THAT IS ENFORCED AS PART OF THE ARBITRATION PROCESS, BUT RIGHT OFF THE BAT, THE OFFER IS REALLY ONLY ABLE TO SEE RECORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES AUTHORED, AND SO WE DO THINK THAT OUR CONTRACT SUBSTANTIALLY MEETS THIS STANDARD AS WELL. THE FOURTH STANDARD IS THE CONTRACT SHOULD NOT REQUIRE CITIES TO PAY COSTS RELATED TO MISCONDUCT, INCLUDING GIVING OFFICERS PAID LEAVE WHILE UER AND/OR THE COST OF SETTLEMEN. SO, POLICE OFFICERS, LIKE ALL CITY EMPLOYEES, HAVE WHAT'S CALLED QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. THAT'S BEEN GRANTED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. IT CANNOT BE BARGAINED AWAY IN A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. OUR CONTRACT REALLY LIMITS, HOWEVER, HOW MUCHONEY THE CITY CAN PAY IN THESE INSTANCES, AND I'LL READ THIS SECTION OF THE CONTRACT. IT SAYS INDEMNIFICATION AND DEFENSE WILL NOT BE PROVIDED FOR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S OWN WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WHERE THE EMPLOYEE FAILS TO COOPERATE OR ASSIST IN THE EMPLOYEE'S DEFENSE. ESSENTIALLY WHAT THATEANS IS THATF THE CITY THINKS THAT WHAT THE OFFICER DID IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THEIR NORMAL JOB RESPONSIBILITIES OR THEY WERE SHOWING WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR THEY WERE SHOWING GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WE REALLY HAVE THE OPTION AS TO WHETHER WE PARTICIPATE IN QUALIFIED IMM IMMUNITY, AND THAT'S REALLY AS CLOSE IN AS YOU CANET T LIMITING THAT RIG AS POSSIBLE. WE DO OFFER OUR POLICE OFFICERS PAID LEAVE WHILE THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION. THAT'S A DUE PROCESS ISSUE, YOU KNOW, SUSPENDING SOMEBODY WITHOUT PAY PRIOR TO A FORMAL FINDING OF MISCONDUCT IS PUNITIVE, BEFORE YOU'VE ACTUALLY PROVEN MISCONDUCT, AND SO THERE'S AN EMPLOYEE RIGHTS ISSUE THERE, BUT WHAT WE DO DO IS IF AN OFFICER IS ON PAID LEAVE AND THEIR MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT THEY DID, IN FACT, COMMIT THE ACT OF MISCONDUCT, WE REQUIRE THE OFFICE [ OFF MIC ] THAT THEY WERE PLACED ON. AND SO, IN EFFECT, THE ONLY PEOPLE WHOSE PAID LEAVE WE ARE PAYING FOR ARE OFFICERS WHORE ACED UNDERNVESTIGATION AND THEN WHORE EVENTUALLY CLEARED. AND SO, YOU KNOW, GIVEN THAT CLAWBACK PROVISION IN THE CONTRACT FOR PAID LEAVE, AND GIVEN THAT I THINK WE'VE REALLY NARROWED IN OUR OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND HEMMED THAT IN AS CLOSE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD AS WE CAN, WE DO THINK TT THE CY CONTRACT SUBSTANTIALLY MEETS THIS STANDARD AS WELL. THE FIFTH IS WHETHER THE CONTRACT PREVENTS INFORMATION ON PAST MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS FROM BEING RECORDED OR RETAINED IN AN OFFICER'S PERSONNEL FILE. OUR CONTRACT DOES NOT REQUIRE INSTANCES OF POLICE MISCONDUCT TO BE PHYSICALLY REMOVED FROM AN OFFICER'S PERSONNEL FILE, NOR DOES IT REQUIRE THESE RECORDS TO BE DESTROYED, AND THERE ARSOME POLICE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE PROVISIONS LIKE THAT, SO IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW, IT IS NOTABLE THAT OURS DOES NOT, AND THE CITY'S PRACTICE, IN FACT, IS TO RETAIN ALL DOCUMENTS IN THE PERSONNEL FILE. AS THIS RELATES TO PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE, LIKE I SAID, THE NEW TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WAIVES PROGSSIVEISCIPLINE FOMAJOR MIONDUCT TYPES INCLUDING EXCESSIVE USE OF F FORCE, MISHANDLING OF A WEAPON, MISHANDLING OF EVIDENCE, AND, OF COURSE, INTENTIONAL LYING CAN ALREADY RESULT IN TERMINATION BY CITY POLICY. CAUSE WE HA BEEN ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THIS WAIVER OF PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE, THE CITY CONTRACT ALSO DOES MEET THIS STANDARD. THE FIFTH STANDARD IS THAT THE CONTRACT SHOULD NOT LIMIT THE CITY'S ABILITY TO DISCIPLINE POLICE OFFICERS. YOU KNOW, TO AN EXTENT, THIS IS IN THE EYE OFHE BEHOLDER. HOWEVER,E FEEL THAT AS A -- AS MANAGEMENT, WE HAVE BROAD ABILITY AND APPROPRIATE ABILITY TO DISCIPLINE THE OFFICERS. LIKE I SAID, IN THIS NEW CONTRACT, THE CHIEF HAS THE ABILITY TO SUSPEND A POLICE OFFICER FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS WITHOUT PAY. AN OFFICER WHOSE DISCIPLINE IS MORE SERIOUS THAN THIS COULD BE INVOLUNTARILY TERMINATED. THE CONTRACT STATES THAT POLICE DISCIPLINE MAY NOT BE FACTORED INTO PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINARY ACTION IF IT IS MORE THAN 24 MONTHS OLD, BUT THE NEW CONTRACT LANGUAGE, AGAIN, HAS THIS WAIVER OF PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE FOR MAJOR MISCONDUCT AND ALLOWS THE CHIEF TO EXTEND PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINARY TIMELINES TO FOUR YEARS, IF, IN FACT, THE CHIEF DOESN'T WANT TO WAIVE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE FOR MAJOR MISCONDUCT. SO, YOU KNOW, THE 24 -- EXCUSE ME, THE 24-MONTH WINDOW WOULD STILL EXIST FOR SOMETHING LIKE AN OFFICER WHO HAS EXCESSIVE TARDINESS OR AN OFFICER WHO, YOU POLICE VEHLE OR SOMETHING LIKEA THAT, FOR LESS MAJOR DISCIPLINE, BUT FOR MAJOR DISCIPLINE, WE HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY TO DISCIPLINE OFFICERS, AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE OF THESE NEW CONCESSIONS, WE THINK THAT THE CITY CONTRACT DOES SUBSTANTIALLY MEET THE STANDARD. AND, FINALLY, THE LAST STAAR IS THAT THEONTRACT SHODOT LIMIT THE CAPACITY OF CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT STRUCTURES AND/OR THE MEDIA TO HOLD POLICE ACCOUNTABLE. AGAIN, YOU KNOW, THE CITY'S POSITION IS WE FEEL THE CONTRACT WOULD BE IMPROVED IF THERE WAS SPECIFIC MENTION OF THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, IF THERE WAS A SPECIFIC CARVEOUT FOR SHARING DISCIPLINARYNFORMATION WI THE POLICE ERSIGHT COMMISSION, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE POLICE OFFICER. WHAT THAT'S REALLY ABOUT IS HOLDING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE APPLYING DISCIPLINE APPROPRIATELY, AND WE THINK THAT THAT OVERSIGHT WOULD BENEFIT THE CONTRACT, BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THAT, SO WE DON'T MEET THAT STANDARD. BUT IN TERMS OF DCLOSURE T THE MEA, THE EVALUATION OF THESE DISCLOSURES ARE MADE ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, WHICH IS A STATE LAW, AND IT REQUIRES DISCLOSURE IN INSTANCES WHERE THE CITY DETERMINES THAT THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS OUTWEIGHED -- OUTWEIGHEDY THE PUBCISCLOSURE IS INTERE OF NONDISCLOSURE. IN THOSE INSTANCES, WE ARE, IN FACT, LEGALLY REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THE DOCUMENTS, AND THE CONTRACT CANNOT LIMIT DISCLOSURE IN THOSE INSTANCES, AND, THEREFORE, IT'S REALLY A NONFACTOR IN DETERMINING WHAT GETS RELEASED TO THE MEDIA. SO WE THINK THAT WE PARTIALLY, PARTIALLY MEET THE STANDARD OF THE CHECKTHEPOLICE.ORG RECOMMDAONS. AND SO, UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF AGENDA ITEMS, I WILL RELINQUISH TIME, BUT I WANTED TO GIVE THE BENEFIT OF THIS BRIEF TO CITY COUNCIL AND TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AGAIN, THE NEW CONTRACT LANGUAGE WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING, AND IT'LL BE AVAILABLE NOT JUST TO THE PUBLIC AS LL. MRS OF THE
00:28:46.001: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (CELL PHONE RINGING IN BACKGROUND.)
00:28:52.041: >> THERE ARE SOME RAISED HANDS. IF THE MAYOR'S -- IF THE COUNCIL IS WILLING TO ALLOW IT, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS. IF WE WANT TO MOVE ON, I CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS IN WRING AFR THEFACT. IT'S UP TO --
00:29:05.988: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES. I'M INCLINED TO MOVE ON, BUT IF FOLKS HAVE QUESTIONS THAT THEY THINK ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO BE ASKED AT THIS TIME, THEN I GUESS -- COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:29:17.900: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. IT'S A QUICK QUESTION. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING, ONE OF THE FEW POINTS YOU BROUGHT UP WAS THIS CHALLENGE IN NGGE OF HOW WE REFER TO TH CELL PHONE ALLOWANCE. I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHY, LIKE, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE HOW WE DESCRIBE THE CELL PHONE ALLOWANCE.
00:29:33.649: >> FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE, BUT I KNOW THAT THE EXECUTIVE BOARD WAS INTERESTED IN IT. I COULDN'T GIVE YOU A PARTICULARLY STRONG ANSWER AS TO WHY, BUT AFTER OUR ANALYSIS, WE KNOW, WE STILL RETAINED OUR ABILITY TO CALL OFFICERS WHEN WE NEEDED TO, AND SO THERE WAS NO ISSUE FROM OUR END IN MAKING THE CHANGE.
00:29:57.006: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
00:29:58.240: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:30:00.910: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO SAY WHILE THIS IS SOMEWHAT OF A NEGATIVE CONVERSATION, WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT POLICE FORCE, ANTHIS RLLY THEI -- THERE ICASE WE HAVE A PROBLEM, WE'LL BE BETTER PREPARED. IT'S NOT THAT WE EXPECT TO HAVE A PROBLEM. AND A QUICK QUESTION:  THE CHECKTHEPOLICE.ORG, DOES IT MENTION BODY CAMERAS AT ALL?
00:30:24.900: >> YOU KNOW, NOT IN THE STANDARD THAT I LOOKED AT, BUT I KNOW BODY CAMERAS ARE A BIG ISSUE, D WE DO HAVE BODY CAMERAS IN THE CITY OFNN ARBOR.
00:30:33.409: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: UH-HUH, THANKS.
00:30:35.477: >> THANK YOU.
00:30:35.844: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS? SEEING NONE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. FOURNIER. COMMUNITY LICE OVERSIG COMMSION, DR. JACKSON.
00:30:57.666: >> I'M ON MUTE, AREN'T I? HELLO, EVERYBODY. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW JOHN FOURNIER WHO GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO COME BRIEF OUR COMMISSION, BUT I FEEL LIKE IF THEY ARE WATCHING, THEY JUST GOT BRIEFED, SO MAYBE WE CAN SAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD EVENIN I'M LIS JACKSON, CHAIR OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, AND I WANTED TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR STATUS. LAST WEEK, AS JOHN FOURNIER MENTIONED, I'M ON THE NEGOTIATING TEAM FOR THE CITY, AND SEVERAL OF US WERE BRIEFED ON THE AAPOA POLICE CONTRACT AND THE TENTATIVE AGREEMENT. HE KINDLY AGRD TO COME BRIEF US. THAT MAY BE LESS NECESSARY THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FEW HOURS AGO, BUT WE ARE HAPPY THAT THE PUBLIC GETS TO HEAR SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE LEARNED, AND WE REGRET THAT THE UNION DID NOT DECIDE TO SHOW US POLICE NAMES, BUT WE ARE VERY CLEAR THAT WE DO UNDERSTAND THE FOIA PROCESS, AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUEO WORK TOWAR TRANARENCY AND ESPECIALLY ACCOUNTABILITY. AT OUR AUGUST 25TH MEETING, THE COMMITTEE BEGAN TO FINALIZE WHAT ACTIONS WE WOULD TAKE REGARDING THE PUBLIC SAFETY RESOLUTION FROM COUNCIL, SO WE'LL BE GETTING BACK TO YOU WITH A PLAN. WE ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE CURRENT TRESPASS PROCESSESN THE CI, AND THERE HAS BEE QUI A BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHO CALLS TRESPASS AND HOW LONG TRESPASS SHOULD BE AND SOME IT IMPACTS MORE THAN OTHERS. SO WE HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO MANY STAKEHOLDERS, AND IN THAT VEIN, WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE DISTRICT LIBRARY AND OTHERS WHO USE TRESPASS REGULARLY, AND THE GOAL IS TO FIND AN EQUITABLE, CLEAR PROCESS FOR THE USE OF TRESPASS THROUGUT THE CITY. WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN A ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH THE POLICE CHIEF AND POLICE DEPARTMENT REGARDING THE NEW ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT U OF M COLLABORATION AND THE MASK ENFORCEMENT PROCESSES. WE HAVE ALSO HAD MEETINGS WITH U OF M FACULTY, U OF M STAFF, AND U OF M STUDENTS REGARDING THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR PARTNERSHIP. AS YOU CIMAGINE, TRE ARE A LOT  GRAVE CCERNS ABOUT THAT. AND WE CONSISTENTLY FOLLOW UP WITH OUR PUBLIC FORUM COMMENTS AND CONCERNS, AND BECAUSE OF MICHELLE HUGHES, WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT ON CREATING PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES FOR INTERACTIONS WITH TRANSGENDER, INTERSEX, AND GENDER NONCONFORMING PEOPLE THAT KIND ANOTHER RESIDENT ASKED US FOR OT DATA ON THE PERCENTAGE OF ARRESTS AND CALLS THAT ARE RELATED TO VIOLENT CRIME, SO, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT CALLS ARE ACTUALLY RELATED TO VIOLENT CRIME AND HOW MANY ARRESTS ARE MADE IN THE COMMISSION OF THOSE CRIMES. AND THEN I WAS INTERESTED IN SOME INFORMATION ON DISPARITIES AND THE RATES AT WHICH AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE ARRESTED IN ANN AOR VERS WHITE SIDENTS. THAT KIND OF SPURRED A CONVERSATION ABOUT PRODUCING MORE DATA THAT ARE CURRENT AND THAT ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC, PERHAPS INCLUDING A DASHBOARD, SUCH AS THE ONE THAT WASHTENAW COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING, SO WE ARE WORKING SEVERAL PEOP FROM THE COMMISSION PARTICIPATED IN INTERVIEWS WITH CITY ADMINISTRATOR CANDIDATES, AND ON SATURDAY, I WAS HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN A FORUM ON ORGANIZED LABOR, POLICING AND THE COMMUNITY, HOSTED BY THE WASHTENAW COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IT WAS A VERY SPIRITED CONVERSATION WITH CHIEF COX, SHARON CLAYTON, DR. IAN ROBERTSO FROM THE UNIVEITY OF CHIGAN, AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CREATIVE ARTS PROJECT AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AND SHE IS A MEMBER OF THEIR POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, SO IT WAS NICE TO INTERACT IN THAT WAY. LAST, I HAVE A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON EXAMINING TRAINING AND CURRICULUM AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES A SO I KNOW MCOLES HAS BEEN HIT WITH SOME PRETTY SERIOUS BUDGET SLASHES LATELY, AS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE, BUT THERE REMAIN SOME NEEDS FOR UPDATING TRAINING STANDARDS, AND IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TASK TO BE THINKING ABOUT. SO I'LL BE FOCUSING ON THAT. I'M ALSO WORKING ON MENTAL HETH ISSUES. FOR EXAMPL WKNOW THAT MORE POLICE OFFICERS COMMIT SUICIDE THAN ARE KILLED BY CIVILIANS EVERY YEAR, AND SO WORKING ON BETTER MENTAL HEALTH IS CRITICAL TO POLICE, BUT IT IS ALSO CRITICAL TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY SERVE.

00:35:40.482: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED. OUR FOURTH AND FINAL PROCLAMATION IS WITH RESPECT TO RECOVERY MONTH. AS FOLKS KNOW, SEPTEMBER IS NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH. YOU KNOW,  ANN ARBOR, , OF COSE, RECOGNIZTHAT ADDICTION IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, IT'S NOT A MORAL ISSUE, AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING WHAT WE CAN TO FIGHT IT, AND IN PART, THAT INCLUDES CELEBRATING THE PROCESS OF RECOVERY, THOSE IN RECOVERY, AND MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION UNDERSTAND THATHERE IS HELP AND COMMUNITY HERE FOR THEM, AND THIS PROCESS OF DECLARING NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH AND SPEAKING ABOUT IT IS A PART OF THAT EXPRESSION TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO NEED HELP KNOW THAT IT IS INDEED THERE. AND SO IT IS MY GREATLEASURE TO CELEBRATE NATIONA RECOVERY MONTH. WHEREAS SEPTEMBER IS NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH, WHEREAS ADDICTION IS A MAJOR NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AFFECTING THOSE WHO SUFFER, THEIR FAMILIES, LOVED ONES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND WHEREAS RECOVERY IS A REALITY FOR MILLIONS OF RESILIENT AMERICANS WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED AS A RESULT,N 2013, LIFE AND RECOVERY SURVEY CONCLUDED THAT THE DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RECOVERY AFFECTED ALL AREAS OF LIFE, INCLUDING A TENFOLD DECREASE IN INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND COSTLY USE OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, AND WHEREAS RECOVERY FROM ADDICTION FLOURISHES IN RECOVERY FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES, OF WHICH ANN ARBOR IS ONE, HOME TO A VIBRANT, DIVERSE, AND VIBRANT RECOVERY COMMUNITY, AND MANY FRIENDLY EMPLOYERS WIT MANY DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS AND AGENCIES HELP INDIVIDUALS INITIATE AND MAINTAIN THEIR RECOVERY. THIS RECOGNITION SERVES TO APPLAUD THOSE WHO ARE IN RECOVERY, THEIR FAMILIES, LOVED ONES, AND THE COMMUNITIES WHO SUPPORT THEM, PROVIDING HOPE TO THOSE WHO STILL SUFFER, AND AFFIRMING OUR COMMUNITY VALUES THAT WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OFLL RESIDES. THEFORE, I, CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR, MAYOR OF ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN, DO HEREBY PROCLAIM SEPTEMBER 2020 AS RECOVERY MONTH AND INVITE THE CREATION OF SERVICES AND PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED. DO WE HAVE A SPEAKER TODAY?
00:38:31.353: >> MAYOR, I DON'T SEE THE PERSON I'M EXPECTING. IF I CAN JUST CALL ON ONE PERSON HERE, IT MAY BE -- THIS MAY BE HER.
00:38:41.430: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OKAY.
00:38:46.701: >> IT SHOULD BE CRYSTAL, THAT'S CORRECT.
00:38:49.905: >> YEP, THERE SHE IS. OKAY. SORR I WAS EXPEING. LASNAME THAN ALL RIGHT, CRYSTAL. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNMUTE YOURSELF NOW.
00:39:06.521: >> HI, EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS CRYSTAL REYES, AND I'M A PERSON IN LONG-TERM RECOVERY. WHAT THAT MEANS IS I HAVE NOT USED A MOOD OR MIND-ALTERING SUBSNCE SINCE AUGUST 30TH OF 2011. RECOVERY HAS ALLOWED ME TO BE A PARENT TO MY CHILDREN, TO GET MARRIED, TO -- I HAVE EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND A MASTER'S DEGREE, AND I'M WORKING ON MY SECOND MASTER'S. I'M ALSO A TEACHER AT TH UNERSITYF MICHIGAN, DEARBORN, AND THAT'S ALL THANKS TO THE PROCESS OF RECOVERY THROUGH THE COMMUNITY. I CAME HERE ON AUGUST 30TH OF 2011. I WAS WELCOMED HERE WITH OPEN ARMS. I GOT MY FIRST JOB OUTSIDE OF LONG-TERM TREATMENT RIGHT HERE IN DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. FROM THERE, I STAYED WITHIN THE ANN ARBOR AREA. BROUGHT MYIDS HERE. I RAISE MY KIDS IN SCHOOLS AND GOT MARRIED HERE. MY CHILDREN ATTEND ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND THAT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE WELCOME HANDS AND THE WELCOMING OF THE ANN ARBOR-WASHTENAW COUNTY COMMUNITY. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT THAT YOU ALL OFFERED. WHENEVER YOU'RE WALKING DOWN T STREETWHENEVER YOU ARE IN A CLASSROOM SETTING OR EVEN IN A CITY COUNCIL MEETING, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE SITTING NEXT TO, AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE GOT HERE. MOST FOLKS DON'T KNOW I'M A PERSON IN LONG-TERM RECOVERY UNLESS I TELL THEM. SO, TODAY, I JUST WANTED TO SHARE MY STORY OF RECOVERY WITH YOU AND SAY THANK YOU, AND I OPEN YOUR ARMS AND OPEN YOUR DOORS AND OPEN YOUR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND SCHOOLS TO THESE FOLKS THAT ARE COMING HERE SEEKING RECOVERY, BECAUSE RECOVERY DOES HAPPEN. IT IS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU.
00:40:58.199: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, INDEED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY TO SPEAK ON MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST. TO SPEAK, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAK AT PUBLICCOMMENT,ALL THE TOLL NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN, THAT IS TO SAY 213-338-8477. ONCE YOU'VE BEEN CONNECTED, PLEASE ENTER MEETING I.D. 938-5344-1231. AT THAT TIME, PLEASE ENTER STAR 9 TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF. OUR CLERK WILL CALL UPON YOU WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN BY IDENTIFYING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND CLEARED TO SPEAK, YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE OUR CLERK WI NOTIFY YOU WHE 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING. SHE WILL ALSO NOTIFY YOU WHEN YOUR TIME IS UP. AT THAT TIME, PLEASE CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS AND CEDE THE FLOOR TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS JOE ANDROSKA.
00:42:35.296: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 248, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK NOW. YOU'RE ON MUTE.
00:42:45.807: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:42:48.176: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES, WE CAN. THANK YOU.
00:42:50.078: >> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTITY. I VE LED IN N ARBOR FO OVER 2YEARS NOW, A I JUST HAD A FEW QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND I JUST WANTED TO PRESENT SOME DATA FIRST. SO, ON THE ANN ARBOR -- THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S WEBSITE, I FOUND THE ANN ARBOR'S POLICE DEPARTMENT CALLS OF SERVICE DATA FROM 2018, AND WITHIN THE DA, I FOD THAT LESS AN .4% OF CALLS OF SERVICE WERE FOR UCR DEFINED VIOLENT CRIME, MEANING HOMICIDE, AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, RAPE, AND ROBBERY. SO, SINCE OVER 99% OF CALLS OF SERVICE ARE FOR NONVIOLENT CRIMES, I THINK POLICE OFFICERS DO NOT NEED TO BE ARMED 24/7 T SALYUPPORT COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE BEING REGULARLY ARMED WHEN RESPONDING TO NONVIOLENT CRIMES CAN SEEM LIKE A TACTIC OF INTIMIDATION, A SIGN THAT THE OFFICER FEARS THE COMMUNITY, AND IT ESCALATES EVERY SITUATION. SO, SINCE GUNS NEVER DE-ESCALATE THE SITUATION, TY MAY GIV LICE OFFICERSHE FEELING OF MORE CONOL OVER THE SITUATION, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE SITUATION HAS BEEN DE-ESCALATED. A POLICE OFFICER'S JOB IS DANGEROUS, BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS DANGEROUS AS POLICE UNIONS AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS MAKE THE PUBLIC AND THEIR POLICE OFFICERS BELIEVE. STATTICS FRO THE BUREAU OF LABOR SHOWED THAT POLICE OFFICERS HAD A MUCH LOWER -- TRUCK DRIVERS, FARMERS, STEEL WORKERS, LANDSCAPERS, GROUNDSKEEPERS, AND MORE. POLICE OFFICERS WEREN'T EVEN IN THE TOP 15 FOR THAT. POLICE OFFICERS CAN BE PUTN DIFFICULT TUATIONS, B OTHER PROFESSIALS ARE PUT IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AS WELL, LIKE DOCTORS, NURSES, TEACHERS, SOCIAL WORKERS, WHICH ARE KICKED, PUNCHED, AND YELLED AT BY THEIR PATIENTS, CLIENTS, AND STUDENTS, YET STILL FIND WAYS TO DE-ESCALATE THE VIOLENCE TO CONTROL THE SITUATION, SO MY TWO QUESTIONS ARE WOULD YOU CONSIDER TTING THE POCY THAT ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICERS CAN ONLY BE ARMED IF RESPONDING TO UCR-DEFINED VIOLENT CRIME? WHICH, AGAIN, IS ONLY .4% OF THEIR CALLS OF SERVICE, AND IF NOT --
00:45:22.163: >> 30 SECONDS.
00:45:22.664: >> IF NOT, WOULD YOU CONSIDER STTING A PILOT PROAM FOR THIS? AND THAT'S IT. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY.
00:45:34.976: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SHANNON HOTOMAKI.
00:45:47.755: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 369, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK NOW. HI, CALLER 369. YOU'RE MUTED. CALLER 369, YOU CAN GO AHEAD NOW.
00:46:16.885: >> OKAY, SORRY ABOUT THAT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. I THOUGHT I WOULD CALL IN TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS' EXPERIENCES WITH THE CITY'S -- I THOUGHT MEMBERS OF COUNCIL WOULD ENJOY HEARING SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY, RATHER THAN SOME OF THE YELLING I ANTICIPATE COMING UP FROM LATER SPEAKERS. MY FAMILY WENT OVER TO 150 NATURE PARKS OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF MONTHS, SO WE HAVE OPINIONS ON WHICH ONES ARE WORTH A CLOSER LOOK. THE PARKS ARE A GOOD WAY TO SAFELY STAY ACTIVE AND EVEN SOCIALIZE, RATHER THAN INDOOR ACTIVITIES DURING THIS ONGOING PANDEMIC. WE HAVE TWO YOUNG SONS, AGES 2 AND 5, WHICH OBVIOUSLY INFLUENCES OUR OPINIONS. ALL OF THE OPINIONS I'M GOING TO STRUCTURESND LESS ABOUT OTHER AREAS IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE ALSO ALL REDHEADS, SO SHADE WAS IMPORTANT. ANHER PARK IN TH NEIGHBOOOD AREA IS ANOTH FAVORITE, A VERY CUTE THEME, WITH LOTS OF SHADE, ROLLING HILLS FOR THE KIDS TO RUN AND PLAY ON, AS WELL AS A NICE PLAY STRUCTURE AND PLAY THEATER. ANOTHER HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT PLAY STRUCTURES TO SPREAD OUT FOR FAMILIES, IF THEY WANTED TO THIS PANDEMIC.  CLOSE DING THERE'S A MERRY-GO-ROUND, SWINGS, AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT SLIDES FOR CLIMBING AND STUFF LIKE THAT, ALSO PRETTY GOOD SHADE. ROSE WHITE PARK, I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BIAS IN PICKING THIS PARK BECAUSE IT IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD PARK. STRUCTURE AND AMALL HILL THA WAS VERY PERFECT FOR MY YOUNG TODDLERS TO SWING ON WHEN THEY WERE A TOO LITTLE FOR BURNS PARK. ANOTHER HAS TWO DIFFERENT PLAY STRUCTURES, ONE FOR YOUNGER KIDS, FOR TODDLER AND ESCHOOLERS AND ANOTHER FOR OLDER ELEMENTARY AGED KIDS. MY SON ENJOYED WAIVING TO THE TUBERS AND BOATERS ON THE BRIDGE THERE. WHEELER PARK IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA IS GREAT FOR TRAIN LOVING, TRAIN-THEMED. THE PLAY STRUCTURE IS SUPER ADORABLE, AND IF YOU CAN TE UP SOMERAIN --
00:49:08.021: >> 30 SECONDS.
00:49:08.021: >> -- THERE ARE A LOT OF SHADED TRAILS AROUND THAT WERE EASY FOR MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD TO RUN THROUGH. THE ONLY THING MISSING FROM OUR PARKS WAS SOME SORT OF SPLASH PAD. I KNOW THAT'S A SORE SUBJECT WITH YOU, MR. MAYOR, SO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. THANK YOU TO THE PARKS DEPARTMENT 365 FOR THE FUN CHALLENGE AND THE SWAG. WE HAD A GREAT TIME, AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO KEEP DOING THIS PARK CHALLENGE THROUGHOUT THE FALL, AS LONG AS THE WEATHER REMAINS NICE. THANKS.
00:49:39.220: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DONNA WATERS.
00:49:48.696: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 857, YOU CAN GO AHEAD. CALLER 857.
00:50:09.817: >> MAYORAYLOR:  MS.WATERS, IT APPEARS YOU'RE ON MUTE STILL.
00:50:23.531: >> CITY CLERK:  I BELIEVE IF YOU PRESS STAR 6, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:50:29.370: >> GOOD EVENING? MAYOR TAYLOR: WE CAN HEA YOU. YOU BET.
00:50:31.906: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS DONNA WATERS FROM SURVIVORS SPEAK. I WOULD LIKE TO APPLAUD THIS COUNCIL FOR RECOGNIZING THAT WE MUST LOOK TOWARD A MORE BALANCED SYSTEM IN OUR COMMUNITY. BY HAVING AN INDEPENDENT POLICE REVIEW BOARD, IT WILL SHOW THE RACISM A THAT OUR CITY GAINST BELIEVES IN FAIR JUSTICE. HAVING THIS WOULD HELP THE COMMUNITY KNOW THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND WOULD ALSO HELP THE COMMUNITY SEE LESS OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST 400 YEARS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT WOULD HELP BUILD THE NECESSARY RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN OUR GREAT CITY. THIS TYPE OF BOARD IS EXACTLY WHAT WNEED IF W EVER HOPE TO BUILD OUR CITY AS ONE. OUR ORGANIZATION STANDS WITH THE MESSAGE AND ARE DEDICATED TO HELPING OTHERS LEARN WHAT WE MEAN BY BLACK LIVES MATTER, WHICH IS WHY WE WOULD LIKE TO INVITE EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY OUR CITY COUNCIL, TO OUR GETTING REAL ABOUT RACE EXPOSG DISPARITIES IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, ON OCTOBER 3RD AT 12:00 P.M.  PLEASE FOLLOW OUR PAGE ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE INFORMATION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO ACHIEVE A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US AS WE HOST THIS FORUM AS A WAY OF EDUCATING. BLESS EACHND EVERY ONE OYOU.OD
00:52:01.028: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:52:22.350: >> CITY CLERK:  MR. COLEMAN, CALL ENDING IN 941, YOU CAN SPEAK.
00:52:35.529: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. COLEMAN,I BELIEVE YOU'RE ON MUTE. THANK YOU.
00:52:39.066: >> ALL RIGHT. AM I UNMUTED?
00:52:40.701: >>AYOR TLOR:  Y'RE UNMUTE SIR.
00:52:44.105: >> ALL OF THESE YEARS, ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL, LED BY MAYOR TAYLOR, HAS MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THEY WOULD NEVER, EVER EVEN DEBAT A PESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTSESOLUTION. SO IHOUGHT THAT THEY REALLY WERE RACIST AND DIDN'T CARE A BIT ABOUT PALESTINIAN HUMAN LIFE. NOW, WITH THIS SWEETHEART DEAL THEY ARE ABOUT TO APPROVE FOR GELMAN, NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE CITY COUNC DOESN'T EN CARE ABOUT THEIR OWCHILDREN'S EXPORE -- AFTER A HALF CENTURY OF MASSIVE POLLUTION FROM GELMAN IN OUR WATERS. I MEAN, NOWHERE IN YOUR GELMAN DEAL IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT GELMAN COMPLETE A CLEANUP OF THE POLLUTION THAT THEY CAUSED. I MEAN, YR COLDHEARTED LACK OF CONCERN FOR HUMAN LIFE, YOUR LACK OF CONCERN FOR HUMAN LIFE FROM PALESTINE, RIGHT TO THE KIDS FROM ANN ARBOR WHO ARE DRINKING WATER, IS STRIKING. AND, YOU KNOW, YOUR LACK OF CONCERN FOR HUMAN LIFE STRUCK ME MORE TONIGHT WHEN MAYOR TAYLOR, TH GUY WHO HAS SO BLUNTLY SPOKEN AGAINST ANY PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION, THAT TAYLOR, HE DARED TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS A FAN OF WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON. MAYOR TAYLOR, YOU ARE NOT EVEN FIT TO SHINE THE SHOES OF WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON. WILLIAM LLOYD GARRIN FOUGH LIKE HL AGAINST RASM WHEN THAT WAS A MOST UNPOPULAR THING TO DO. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO PROTECT ISRAEL FROM THE SLIGHTEST PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION. I MEAN, WHY? WHY? AND THEN YOU DARE TO PRESENT YOURSE A SOMKIND OF ANTIRACIST? I MEAN, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, THAT IS JUST A LIE. THAT'S JUST A LIE, AND YOU ARE JUST A LIAR. I MEAN, COME ON. HOW CAN YOU --
00:55:06.013: >> CITY CLERK:  30 SECONDS.
00:55:06.847: >> -- SPEND SO LONG FIGHTING AGAINST THE SLIGHTEST HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION TO PROTECT THE YOURSELF AS SOMKIND OF CGE ANTIRACIST? IN MY OPINION, THAT IS JUST A LIE. ANY COMMENT? HM?
00:55:38.512: >> CITY CLERK:  TIME.
00:55:43.451: >> HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:55:49.890: >> YOU MAY NEED TO HIT --
00:55:53.093: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IF MR. COLEMAN IS FINISHED, THANK YOU. OUNEXT SAKER IMOJAN --
00:56:00.134: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:56:01.902: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE CAN HEAR YOU, MA'AM.
00:56:03.971: >> WELL, MAYOR TAYLOR, IT'S TIME THAT YOU STOPPED MASQUERADING AS A HUMAN RIGHTS CARING PERSON. IT IS TIME YOU STOPPED TELLING US THAT YOU ARE REALLY ANTICIST, BECAE YOU ARE LYIN YOU E NO SUCH A THING. YOU ARE RACIST FROM WHERE I STAND. YOUR GELMAN SWEETHEART DEAL IS PROOF THAT YOU AREN'T WORTH A PITCHER OF WARM SPIT. I TOLD THIS WORTHLESS CITY COUNCIL TO JUST CLEAN UP THAT DIOXANE POLLUTION AND BE DONE WITH IT. THEY IGNORED ME YOUR IMPENDING GELMAN SWEETHEART DEAL THREATENS TO CONDEMN ANN ARBOR'S CHILDREN TO LIVE WITH THAT POLLUTION FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. YOUR YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS ARE DRIVING AN UNWILLING POPULACE TO DREAM SOME VY TOXIC KOOL AID. SHAME ON YOU! I TOLD THE SAME CITY COUNCIL TO APPROVE THE RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL AS IT WAS GUNNING DOWN PALESTINIANS. WHAT A NASTY, BRUTISH CITY COUNCIL THIS IS. YOU CAN'T PRETEND TO BE ANTIRACIST WHILE YOU'RE KILLING PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. DAMN ABOUT T CHILDREN OF ANN ARBOR WHEN YOU CONDEMN THEM TO DIOXANE EXPOSURE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THE SAME CITY COUNCIL ALSO HAS NO QUALMS ABOUT EXPOSING PEOPLE DIOXAN POLLUTI IN OUR CITY'S WATERS. SINCE THE '60s, THIS CITY HAS ALLOWED THE GELMAN DIOXANE POLLUTION TO SPREAD LIKE A CANCER ACROSS THE CITY. NOW AFTER POLLUTING THE WATER FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY, GELMAN IS BACK IN THE HIGH LIFE AGAIN. READY TO ENJOY THE SWEETHEART DEAL WITH GELMAN YOUR GELMA DEAL IS NOTHING BUT A FLASHING GREEN LIGHT FOR THE POLLUTERS TO SPREAD TOXINS FOR YEAR TO COME. YOUR DEAL WON'T CONTAIN THE SPREADING OF THE DIOXANE PLUME. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE CITY OF ANARBOR CI COUNCIL IS DOING RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR VERY EYES. CITY COUNCIL IS NOT EVEN TRYING TO COMMIT GELMAN TO ANYTHING RESEMBLING A CLEANUP, LIKE A SMALL CHILD, THE CITY COUNCIL HAS ACCEPTED THE LOLLIPOP FROM GELMAN IN RETURN FOR BEARING THE FULL ISSUE OF CLEANUP. OH, AND THEN THERE'S THE BEST PART. A FAT RED CIRCLE DRAWN AROUND THE EXPANDING POLLUTION ON A MAP OF ANN ARBOR, WITH A FLASHING PROHIBITION ZONE. DID YOU NEED ANY MORE PROOF THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL ISN'T WORTH A TALL PITCHERF WAR SPIT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT SINCE NEW YORK HAS OFFICIALLY ADOPTED THE ONE-PART-PER-BILLION SAFETY STANDARDS FOR DIOXANE IN WATER, YOUR GELMAN SWEETHEART DEAL WON'T EVEN REDUCE THE CITY'S DIOXANE CONTAMINATION BELOW SEVEN PARTS PER BILLION. I AM TELLING Y THIS, WE DEMAND AN IMMEDIATE CITY CLEANUP OF THE GELMAN CONTAMINATION. HEAR ME AGAIN, WE DEMAND AN IMMEDIATE CITY CLEANUP OF THE GELMAN CONTAMINATION. DO IT OR BE SHAMED. HELLO? DID U GUYS -- WAS TIME UP  THAT CALLER?Y,
01:00:29.403: >> CITY CLERK:  SORRY, YES. I ANNOUNCED TIME PROBABLY ABOUT 30 SECONDS BEFORE SHE STOPPED SPEAKING.
01:00:35.876: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR THAT. TO THE SPEAKER, THA YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:00:58.532: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I HAVE THREE GOOD NEWS, POSITIVE COMMENTS TO MAKE. THE FIRST O I I WANT TO THANK DTE FOR THEIR PROMPT RESPONSE TO AT LEAST ONE CIRCUIT OF LIGHTS THAT WERE OUT ON JACKSON ROAD, AND JUST REMIND THE VIEWING AUDIENCE THAT IF YOU SEE STREETLIGHT OUTAGES, PLEASE PUT THEM IN A2 FIX IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. OUT FOR A WHILE BEFORE  BECAME AWARE OF IT,ND THAT'S REALLY DANGEROUS,SO, PLEASE LET US KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. NUMBER TWO, I WANT TO THANK SAM SWARTZ FOR THE VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING THAT WE HAD LAST WEEK. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRACT FOR AN ASSEMENT OF OUR PEDESIAN AND CYCLING ENVIROENT THAT IS ON TRACK AND GOING WELL. NUMBER THREE, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEETING THAT WE HAD WITH SENATOR JEFF ERWIN AND REPRESENTATIVE YUSUF ROBBIE, AND TWO OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS WERE PRESENT. I WILL -- I THANK THEM, AND I WILL LET THEM SPEAK UP IF THEY THIS WAS TO GET ASSISTANCE IN ADVOCATING FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS OF THE HURON CROSSWALK NEAR THAYER. AS EVERYONE KNOWS, THAT WAS THE SITE OF A VERY SERIOUS PEDESTRIAN INJURY CRASH IN EARLY 2019. WEAD HOP THAT WE WOULD B ABLE TO GETMPROVEMENTSHIS AR. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO SLIP UNTIL THE 2021 CONSTRUCTION CYCLE, WHICH IS VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTING, BUT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE, AND I WANT TO THANK OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS LEADERSHIP FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND TOMCRAWRD, THE INTERIM CI ADMINISTRATOR FOR ALL OF THE EFFORT IN ADVOCATING FOR THESE IMPROVEMENTS. THANK YOU.
01:03:02.122: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:03:04.291: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU, TOO, FOR THE PROCLAMATION RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER AS FOR HER COURAGE TO TELL HER YE PERSONAL STORY. SEPTEMBER IS RECOVERY MONTH. FOR ONE MONTH A YEAR, WE TAKE A STEP BACK TO RECOGNIZE THE SELFLESSNESS AND SUCCESS OF THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND HAVE STRUGGLED WITH AICTIONS OFLL KIND. IN THE COURSE OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC -- OUR NATION'S MOST PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT ADDICTION. WE HEARD VERY HUMAN STORIES ABOUT RELATABLE FIGURES, WHOSE LIVES WERE RIPPED APART, AND STATISTICS THAT MADE VERY REAL THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE HAVEN OUR HAND RDIALOGUE, HOVER, OR THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS CREATED AN AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM BUT IT OFTEN FAILED TO DISCUSS THE SOLUTION, AND THAT'S WHY THIS MONTH WE TELL THE OTHER STORY, THE STORY OF HOPE AND RECOVERY. RECOVERY IS WHAT COMES AFTER ADDICTION. IT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH PEOPLE GET AND STAY CLEAN OR SOBER. IN THE UNITED STATES, OVER 22 MILLIOPEOPLE LEN ACTE RECOVE. THAT'S NEARLY 10% OF THE ENTIRE ADULT POPULATION. WITH STATISTICS LIKE THAT, IT'S LIKELY THAT YOUR DAUGHTER, YOUR LAWYER, YOUR BARISTA, YOUR PLUMBER OR YOUR CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE IS A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC OR ADDICT. BUT IN WASHTENAW COUNTY, I KNOW STATISTI, AND I KNO THAT N BECAUS I AM MELF RECOVING PEOPLE IN RECOVERY LIVING RIGHT HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY. I CAME TO TERMS WITH MY ALCOHOLISM AT A RELATIVELY YOUNG AGE AND IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY. IN THOSE EARLY DAYS AND MONTH, I FELT SHAME AND GUILT, SOME OF WHICH I EARNED AND SOME OF IT I DID NOT, BUT I HAD HOPE, AND I HA HOPE BECAUSE I WAS IMMEDIATELY GIVEN PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT AT ST. JOE'S AND ADOPTED INTO AN INCREDIBLY WARM AND ESTABLISHED RECOVERY COMMUNITY HERE IN WASHTENAW COUNTY. SEEMINGLY OVERNIGHT, I FOUND HUNDREDS OF NEW FRIENDS READY TO HELP ME GRAPPLE WITH SOMETHING SO SENSITIVE, SO PERSONAL AND SO FFICULT. AND TT MEANS THATHERE IS HOPE IFOU OR LOVEDNE IS FFERING RIGHT NOW. WITHIN A 45-MINUTE DRIVE, THERE ARE NEARLY A DOZEN TREATMENT CENTERS, SCORES OF RECOVERY-FRIENDLY EMPLOYERS, HUNDREDS OF MUTUAL AID MEETINGS, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS OF EVERY RACE, GEER, AGE, ORIENTATION D BACKGROUND READY TO HELP YOU. WE NEED TO CREATE A SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUDGED BY PAST DEEDS BUT FUTURE VALUE FOR POTENTIAL. THIS MEANS CHECKING W WE PROSECUTE DG LAWS AND OUR BIES AGAINST THE JUNKY AND THE JUNK. THE STORIES ARE VERY REAL, AND THEY ARE TOUGH, BUT I CONTINUE TO SEE THE BRILLIANT POTENTIAL THAT PEOPLE HAVE IF GIVEN A CHANCE AND GIVEN SOME HOPE. THANKS, AND HAPPY RECOVERY MONTH.
01:06:27.761: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER
01:06:28.395: >> COUNCMEMBER GRAND THA U. WANTO WISH EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAD THEIR FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL TODAY, STUDENTS, PARENTS, AND TEACHERS, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE TEACHERS, A HAPPY FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL AS WE ARE NAVIGATING VERY UNCERTAIN TIMES, AND CONGRATS TO THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR DISTRIBUTING OR 18,0 DEVICES TO SDENTS LAST WEEK. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE ACHIEVEMENT, AND YOU KNOW THAT MANY OF US APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING, TO DO THE BEST WE CAN EVERY DAY WITH SCHOOL. SO, THANK YOU FOR THAT. I DO WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION JUST TO CC1,HICH WILL BEOMING UP AT THE NEXTOUNCIL MEETING, B IT'S IN YOUR COMMUNICATIONS. IT'S A NOMINATION FOR ELIZABETH LILLARD FOR THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION. WHILE SHE IS TECHNICALLY FILLING A MEMBER AT LARGE POSITION, SHE, ELIZABETH LILLARD, IS THE WOMAN IN CONSERVATION LEADERSHIP PROGRAM MANAGER AT THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION, SO SHE COMES WITH ALL SORTS OF NONPROFIT CREDENTIALS AND I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME IN APPOINTING HER TO THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION NEXT WEEK. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK MY WARD WORDS TS EVING. KERMAN FOR HIS WHAT HE DIDN'TNCLUDE AND DOESN'T TEL PEOPLE IS HOW MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY HE HAS HELPED ASHEY HAVE ENTERED RECOVERY AND HOW MANY TIMES HE'S BEEN ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE CALL BECAUSE OF HIS ROLE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY CALL WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING FOR HELP. SO, I JUST WANT TOECOGNIZE THAT TIGHT.
01:08:23.643: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:08:28.415: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. FIRST, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ALSO COMMEND AND THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR HIS PROFOUND AND PERSONAL AND COURAGES STATENT THIS EVENG AND FOR REMINDING US THAT THIS IS RECOVERY MONTH, AND FOR INSPIRING OR HELPING TO INSPIRE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOVERY THAT SO MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE GRAPPLG WITH, AND INOW YOU HAVE ACHIEVED, YOU KNOW, MANY PERSONAL VICTORIES IN YOUR OWN, WITH YOUR OWN CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE ALL VERY PROUD OF YOU, AND, AGAIN, YOU HAVE MADE US PROUD THIS EVENING, AND AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND JUST STED, HELPED MAN INDIDUALS, I THINK YOUR STATEMENT THIS EVENING ALSO HELPED MANY INDIVIDUALS.

WE DID THE FIRST SURVEY TWO YEARS AGO, AND MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN FOR THE CITY AND FOR RESIDENTS, AND SO I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO SEEK CITIZEN INPUT AGAIN, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT THE COST IS MINIMAL. WE DID THE 2018 SURVEY FOR UNDER $15,000, ANDHE NEX BUDGET CYCLES ONE WHERE THE CITY WILL BE COVERING TWO FISCAL YEARS. NEXT MAY, THE COUNCIL WILL APPROVE BOTH THE FISCAL YEAR 22 BUDGET AND THE FISCAL YEAR 23 FINANCIAL PLAN. NOW IS THE TIME TO DO THIS, AND I DO THI THA CITY COUNL ABLE.

01:16:02.402: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OF COURSE. MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT SEEING YOU, COUNCILMEMBER.
01:16:06.572: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  NO WORRIES.
01:16:07.740: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ARE THERE FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH COUNCIL? WE NOW COME TO THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOTION PLEASE TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA? I THINK I HAD COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND THEN NSON ON T CONST AGENDA. DISCUSSIONF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:16:25.091: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: MR. MAYOR, I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-10, PLEASE.
01:16:34.767: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:16:35.668: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, I WOULD LIKE TO PULL FOR DISCUSSION CA-1 AND CA-11. MAYOR TAYLO  COUNCILMEMBE ACKEAN?
01:16:44.777: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANYOU, MR. MAYOR. I DON'T WANT TO PULL ANYTHING, BUT I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE CITY CLERK FOR CA-7. A HANDFUL OF MONTHS BACK, LOCAL ACTIVISTS AND ORGANIZERS, WHO WERE FORMER WITH VOTERS, NOT POLITICIS, THE CAMPAIGN TO END GERRYMANDERING IN MICHIGAN CONTACTED ME IN THE LEAD-UP TO WHAT WILL MOST LIKELY BE A RECORD-SETTING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN TERMS OF VOTER TURNOUT. IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE EVERYONE'S OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AMID A PANDEMIC, THEY ASKED -- THEY MADE THE ASK THAT THE CITY CLERK OPEN UP A SATELLITE ON CAMPUS IN ORDER TO RISTER MORE VOTERSN ORDER TO GET PEOPLE MORE ABSENTEE BALLOTS, BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE ARE VOTING IS DIFFERENT AMID COVID-19, AND SO TO THE CREDIT OF THE CLERK, WHEN PEOPLE SAY JUMP, MS. BEAUDRY SAYS HOW HIGH, D S ALWAYS JUMPSVEN HIGHE THAN EXPECTED,O HER TEAM PUT TOGETHER A PLAN VERY QUICKLY. THEY NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S ART SCHOOL TO OPEN THE SATELLITE CITY CLERK'S OFFICE AT THE ART MUSEUM ON THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S CAMPUS, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO REGIERING MOR VOTERS AND TTING BALLOT IN MORE PEOPLE'S HANDS SO THEY CAN EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY.
01:18:17.403: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THAT VERY SLIGHTLY WITH MY THANKS TO THE CLERK AND TO THE UNIVERSITY, THE CLERK, OF COURSE, FOR GETTING THIS SATELLITE OFFICE UNDER WAY. IT'S BEEN MEXPERIENCE TT WHENEVER WE OR I ASK MS. BEAUDRY TO JUMP, SHE IS LIKE, LOOK, MAN, I HAVE BEEN JUMPING FOR TEN MINUTES, AND NOBODY HAS EVEN ASKED ME TO DO IT YET. SHE OFTEN KNOWS WHAT TO DO BEFORE WE DO. STUDENTS WILL HAVE T OPRTUNITY TO VOTE TO DON A VERY PUBLIC -- PRIVATE IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR INVESTIGATE BUT PUBLIC IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CIVIC EXPRESSION. THAT WILL EXPAND I THINK THE VISIBILITY OF THE VOTE AND WILL EXPAND I THINK VOTER EDUCATION. IT'S AN OUTSTANDING PROJECT WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND THE CITY, SO MY EARNEST THANKS TO ALL. COCIEMBER LSON? COUNCILMEMB NELSON:  TNK YOU,R. MAYOR. I DO NOTANT TO PUL IT, BUT I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON ITEM CA-4, BECAUSE IT IS IN WARD 4, AND COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND I WENT ON A BIKE RIDE YESTERDAY TO TRY TO DISCOVER IT, AND IT MAKES ME REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THE PARK SYSTEM INCORPORATES IT, SOME PATHS. WE HAD TROUBLE FINDING IT BUT TNKOU. AT'S ALL I HADO SAY.
01:19:39.518: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA AS AMENDED? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA, PLEASE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-10, 1, AND 11, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-1, 10 AND 11 IS APPRED, WITH ALL MEMBERS OF COUNCIL PRESENT VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS -- CA-10, RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO CREATE A TEMPORARY CHILDCARE BENEFIT FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF $580,000 INTO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF CA-10, PLEASE, BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:20:26.565: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. WHAT CA-10 DOES IS ESTABLISH A TEMPORARY CHILDCARE BENEFIT FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE CITY FOR THE FALL, SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER. IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT FOR A UPLE OF REASS. CLEAY, MAGING CHILDRE IS DIFFICULT THESE DAYS WITH THE PANDEMIC AND SCHOOLS CLOSED, AND CLEARLY THAT INCLUDES CITY EMPLOYEES. THE TEMPORARY BENEFIT IS $500 PER MONTH PER EMPLOYEE, WITH OVER 200 CITY EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE WITH SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN UP TO AGE 12. THAT EXTRA BENEFIT WOULDE EMPLOYEES, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO DO. THE OTHER BENEFIT OF THE CITY OFFERING THIS BENEFIT IS WITH THIS ALTERNATIVE, MANY EMPLOYEES, WHO WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE OPTED FOR THE FMLA PAID LEAVE OPTION, WILL REMAIN ON THE JOB. THAT AVOIDS WHAT COULD BE A VERY DISRUPTIVE SITUATION IN TERMS OF OPERATIONAL CONTINUITY AND QUALITY. HOWEVER, PROVIDING THIS TEMPORARY BENEFIT IS EXPENSIVE. IF ALL 250 FOLKS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM, WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR JOUST FOUR MONTHS, AND $366,000 OF THAT IS IN THE GENERAL FUND. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAIYEGARDING THE CITY'S FUTUREINANCIAL OUTLOOK. I ASKED ABOUT OTHER EMPLOYERS, AND IT APPEARS OTHERMPLOYERS ARE NOT TAKING ACTIONS LIKE THIS TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY CHILDCARE BENEFIT. I UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT OTHER EMPLOYERS AREN'T DOING THIS DOESN'T MAKE WHAT WE ARE DOING INAPPROPRIATE, BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT BOTHERS ME WHEN WE USE TAXPAYER DLARS TO PROVIDE BENEFITSHAT TAXPARS PAYING THE BILLS DON'T ENJOY. THAT BOTHERED ME IN RELATION TO THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION STRUCTURE, AND IT BOTHERS ME A BIT HERE AS WELL. I SUSPECT MOST FOLKS WILL CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS TEMPORARY AND A GOOD THING TO DO FOR EMPLOYEES AND WILL SUPPORT IT, I'M INTERTED INEARING IF ANYUT OF MY COLLEAGUES SHAREY CONCERNS THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR.
01:22:40.266: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:22:41.967: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR, AND THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROGRAM. I HAVE THE HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU A T MAYOR A UNCILMEMBER CHI EATON ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE, AND THIS WAS BROUGHT TO US FOR A PREVIEW AT ONE OF OUR PRIOR MEETINGS, AND IT DOES SHOCK US TO SEE THE TOTAL, IF THE BENEFITS WERE UTILIZED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT. IT'SEEN -- AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET THESE QUESTIONS IN EARLY, BUT IF MR. FOURNIER, WHETHER THERE IS ANY FEDERAL OR STATE MONEYS THAT WILL BE APPLIED TO THIS TO HELP OFFSET THE COST WILL BE -- IS THERE ANYTHING AVAILABLE FOR THE CITY TO HELP OFFSET T COST  THIS PRRAM IN ANY W?
01:23:39.191: >> THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE A MORE APPROPRIATE QUESTION FOR MR. HORNING, WHO IS ON THE MEETING AS WELL. MATT, WOULD YOU MIND TAKING THE LEAD ON THAT?
01:23:47.099: >> NOT AT ALL. SO THERE ARE NOT ANY STATE DOLLARS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED FOR THIS PROCESS. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE CARES ACT FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT FLOWED THROUGH THE STATE IS A REIMBURSEMENT OF OUR POLICE AND FIRE PAYROLL EXPENDITURES FOR APRIL AND MAY, AND WE EXPECT THAT REIMBURSEMENT TO BE IT COULD BE RATCHETED DOWN BECAUSE THE PROGRAM WAS OVERSUBSCRIBED. HOWEVER, SINCE IT'S A REIMBURSEMENT OF PRIOR EXPENDITURES, THERE IS NO RESTRICTIONS ON HOW THE CITY COULD SPEND THAT, SO THAT WOULD COVER THE GENERAL FUND PORTION OF IT.
01:24:42.755: >> COUNCMEMBER RAMLA:  BUT THAT BEFIT THAT WE'LL HOPE TO RECEIVE WAS NOT PRESCRIBED FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THIS, AND THAT MONEY COULD BE SPENT ANY WAY THE CITY FELT IT COULD SPEND THE MONEY. IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE SPENT IN A PARTICULAR WAY, CORRECT?
01:25:01.073: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
01:25:02.141: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THOSE ARE ALL JUST GENERAL FUND DOLLS. AN IN OUR MEETING BEFORE, WE SAID THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY COST THE CITY $580,000. DO WE HAVE MAYBE A MORE PRACTICAL NUMBER THAT WE CAN GIVE COMFORT, SO KNOWING THAT MAYBE NOT ALL, YOU KNOW, POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES WILL TAKE ADNTAGE OF THIOR PARTICIPATE IN THIS?
01:25:32.304: >> I MIGHT BE ABLE TO JUMP IN AND ANSWER THAT ONE, MATT. WE DID DO A FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE COVID SURVEY FOR EMPLOYEES TWO WEEKS AGO ON A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS. GOT HEALTHY NUMBEOF REONSES, AND IN THAT SURVEY, ABOUT 42% OF EMPLOYEES WITH DEPENDENTS INDICATED THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN ARRANGING CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN, AND SO WHILE WE ARE BUDGETING FOR THE FULL EXTENT OF THE PROGRAM, JUST AS A PRECAUTION, WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET EVEN CLOSE TO 1% UTILIZATIO
01:26:15.648: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  COULD YOU DESCRIBE TO US -- AND I'M SORRY IF I'M RUNNING LONG, BUT I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO US WHY STAFF BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS A GOOD MEASURE TO TAKE IN LIGHT OF THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE IF -- IF THI -- IF WORK TO HE SCHOOL THEIR FFF CHILDR?
01:26:35.067: >> YEAH, IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO TWO ISSUES THAT WERE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS RECOMMENDATION. THE FIRST IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE DO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WHO WOULD BE IMPACTED OUR OGIL ESTIME WAS SUBSEQUENT WT BACK AND WERE ABLE TO PULL DATA ON EMPLOYEES WHO AREN'T ENROLLED IN OUR BENEFITS PROGRAM, SO IT'S A TOTAL OF 290 EMPLOYEES OF THE CITY WHO HAVE DEPENDENTS UNDER TH VAST MARITY OF SOOL  KNOW, DIRICTS ARE IN AIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IN THIS AREA, AND SO WE HAVE BEEN HEARING CONSISTENTLY FROM OUR EMPLOYEES THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER A LOT OF ANXIETY AND A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOBS AND HAVE CHILDREN AT HOME. NOW, THEY GET -- OUR EMPLOYEES, CAUSE OF THE FERAL ACTN AT THE BEGNING OF THIS PANDIC, UNTIL THE D OF THE YEAR, OUR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES ALL RECEIVE THE EFMLA, WHICH ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE 12 WEEKS OF FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT, TEN OF WHICH THEY WOULD BE PAID AT TWO THIRDS OF THEIR NMAL COMPSATION. LOSING A THI OF YOUR P IS A SIGNIFICANT DROP-OFF FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, FOR A LOT OF OUR EMPLOYEES, BUT THERE IS A PAID OPTION FOR THEM TO LEAVE EMPLOYMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, STILL HAVE INCOME, STILL HAVE A GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT WHEN THEY COME BACK AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. EFMLA. YS APPLY F TT OUT 110 OF SO OF THEM ARE APPLYING FOR IT INTENDING TO USE IT INTERMITTENTLY. SOME OF THEM ARE APPLYING FOR IT SAYING WE ARE GOING TO SEE HOW THIS GOES, AND IF MY KIDS NEED MORE TIME THAN I CAN GIVE THEM DURING A NORMAL WORKWEEK, THEN WE AREOING TO BESINGIT. BUT THAS GIVING US SOME CONCERN ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO HAVE ENOUGH STAFFING IN SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS. OUR OPERATIONS ARE TOTALLY STAFFED NOW. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SHOULD NOT BE CONCERNED. WE'LL MAKE SURE WE DO WHATEVER NEEDO DO SO THAT OUR COR SERVICRE PROVIDED TO THE UTMOST ABILITY THAT THEY NEED TO BE PROVIDED, BUT THERE'S COSTS THAT COME WITH US. PERHAPS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE IS AT OUR WATER TREATMENT PLAN, WHERE WE HAVE HAD TO BRING IN CONTRACTED SERVICES TO MEET OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AFTER A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES TOOK THE FM, SO THERE'A COST TO THAT I KNOW I'M GOING LONG, BUT I'LL SUM THIS UP WITH TWO POINTS: THERE IS A NEED FOR CHILDCARE AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES. THERE'S A NEED FOR CHILDCARE ACROSS THE COMMUNITY. THE COST OF CHILDCARE IN ANN ARBOR IS MUCH, MUCH HIGHER THAN IT IS IN A LOT OF OTHER AREAS, SO HEARING THAT FROM OUR EMPLOYEES, WE THOUT THAT TEMPORARILY WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THEM AND WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT SUPPORT FOR THEM, A. B, WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE LONGER TERM BUDGET IMPACTS MIGHT BE FOR US, IF WE HAVE TO BRING ON TEMP EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTED SERVICES TO MAINTAIN OUR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE FALL, BECAUSE EMPLOYEES REALIZE THAT IT IS JUSTOING TO BE EIER FOR THEM THAT TY TE ADVANTA OF THE IES EFA.
01:30:17.623: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU.
01:30:18.457: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:30:23.662: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, AGAIN, MR. MAYOR, AND I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, AND I'M GLAD WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT AND THAT THIS INFORMATION IS BEING SHARED WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITY. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON TWO THINGS. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION I SUBMITTED, IT WAS INDICATED THAT THE ROUND ONE PAYMENT FROM THE STATE IS EXPECTED NO LATER THAN SEPTEMBER 18. THEXPECTED AMOT IS 5 THIS IS WT YOU REFERENCED, MR. HORNING. THANK YOU. IT WAS ALSO AN INDICATION THAT IT COULD BE DUE TO -- WITH THE ROUND TWO PAYMENT THAT WAS DUE NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 7TH AND IS APPROXIMATELY, AGAIN, 5 MILLION, BUT AGAIN THAT THAT COULD BE ELIMINATED DUE TO OVERSUBSCRIPON. I ULD JUST A IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S FIRST RESPONDERS HAZARD PAY PREMIUM PROGRAM THAT THE CITY SHOULD RECEIVE A LITTLE OVER 200,000 NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 14TH. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO, AND I AM SURE YOU WILL DO THIS, TO KEEP THE NEW COUNCIL APPRID OF WHAT ACTUALLCCURS ON THESE TES IN TERMSF THOSE PAYMENTS, AND THEN JUST THE OTHER POINT, I KNOW THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE RE-EVALUATED IN DECEMBER. I DID ASK, YOU KNOW, WHAT CRITERIA YOU WOULD BE USING TO SHARE THIS WITH THE PUBLIC. IT SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE CRITERIA IS SOUND. YOU SA AT LEAST -- YOU IDENTIFIED AT LEAST THREE CRITERIA, ONE, THE STATUS OF THE PANDEMIC; TWO, WHETHER THE SCHOOLS ARE STILL CLOSED; AND, THREE, WHETHER THE EMPLOYEES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFIT OR NOT, AND, OBVIOUSLY, I AM SURE YOU'LL BE MAKING, YOU KNOW, A FURTHER RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THAT EVALUATION. THANK YOU.
01:32:26.118: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FOR MY PART, I'M GOING TO STEP IN AND SAY THAT I'M DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT THIS. I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT STAFF HAS BROUGHT IT FORWARD. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING THAT WE DO, WE DO THROUGH STAFF. WE KNOW THAT IN COVID, WE ARE ENGAGE IN AN INCREDIBLY UNIQUE MOMENT. THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY RELIED ON, IN THIS CONTEXT, SCHOOLS, ARE BEING PROVIDED IN A UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT, AND CERTAINLY, IN THIS CONTEXT, FOR THE ABILITY TO FREE PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS TO THEMSELVES ENJOY EMPLOYMENT -- I THINK THAT ANYING THAT WE CAN DO HER WE OUGHT TBE DOG, AND THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE, I THINK, OF MUNICIPAL LEADERSHIP, THAT IS TO SAY CITY LEADERSHIP ON THE STAFF SIDE TAKING CARE OF OUR CITY EMPLOYEES, AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT THEM. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:33:18.937: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE WORDS OF OTHERS ABOUT -- I AM RY GLAD TH OUR INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR PROPOSED THIS IDEA. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, I THINK IT'S WORTH EXPLAINING WHEN WE REFERENCE HOME SCHOOLING, IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT A PARENT DECIDING TO ABANDON WORK TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THEIR CHILD'S UCATION. WE HE A LOT OF FAMIES IN THISOWN AND IN OER DISTRICTS WHO ARE CAUGHT IN THIS STRANGE IN BETWEEN, WHERE A CHILD WHO IS EIGHT YEARS OLD CAN'T BE PLACED IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER AND PARTICIPATE IN ONLINE SCHOOLING WITHOUT ANY GUIDANCE OR SUPERVISION, AND SO IT'S VERY -- OLD ENOUGH TT TY DON'T NEED A SUPEISION IN ONLE LEARNING, BUT I HAVE SUCH SYMPATHY FOR PARENTS WHO ARE IN THIS CRUNCH. THERE IS SCHOOLING, BUT IT'S -- THE FACT THAT IT'S OCCURRING ONLINE IS A HUGE, HUGE CHALLENGE, TO HAVE THIS OCCUR IN YOUR HOME WITHOUT SUPERVISION. AND SO THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF FAMILIES WHO ARE INDULGING I LUXURY O IT'S UNNECESRY. I AM VERY GLAD THAT OUR CITY HAS DECIDED TO PROVIDE THIS BENEFIT TO OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANT, BECAUSE TRULY THE EMPLOYEES AT CITY HALL ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS, AND JUST PERSONALLY, I TEACH AT A SCHOOL THAT IS EARLY EDUCION, WHICH TECICALLY IS LICENSED THRGH -- AS A CHILDCARE FACILITY, AND THE STANDARDS FOR CHILDCARE FACILITIES ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE STATE RECOGNIZES THAT THE WORLD CAN'T CARRY ON WITHOUT CHILDCARE OF ANY SORT AT ALL. AND SO THERE'S JUST THIS HUGE GAP OF PEOPLEHO HAVE CHILDREN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHO CLEARLY REQUIRE SUPERVISION. THEY ARE TECHNICALLY RECEIVING SCHOOLING, AND TEACHERS ARE MAKING HERCULEAN EFFORTS TO PROVIDE IT IN AN ONLINE FORMAT. BUT LIKE I SAID, MY HEART GOES OUT TO THOSE OF YOU IN THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY AND IN OTHER DISTRICTS WHO ARE FACING ONLINE SCHOOLING AND TRYING TO WORK. AND IS JUST A HUG THIN AND SO I -- LIKE I SAID, I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS, AND I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY AN EXCELLENT THING THAT WE ARE CHOOSING TO PROVIDE IT. THANKS.
01:35:52.390: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:35:54.793: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I'LL TRY NOT TO REPEAANYTNG AT ANYONE EL HAS SAID, B I WANTO RECOGZE THE STAFF WHO HAVE REACHED OUT TO MANY OF US IN TALKING ABOUT THIS POLICY. MY YOUNGEST CHILD JUST TURNED 12, AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH CITY STAFF ABOUT LIKE, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AGE CUTOFF, AND DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? BUT ONE THING THAT I KNOW AS A PARENT IS THAT WE ARE ALL EXHAUSTED, AND SOMETIMES ALL IT TAKES TOELP YOU PUSH THROUGH IS JUST A FEELING LIKE THE ORGANIZATION THAT YOU WORK FOR HAS YOUR BACK, AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COVER ALL OF THE COSTS, BUT THIS REALLY DOES SAY, "WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE STEPS THAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT YOU. WE VALUE YOU. WE UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT Y'R JUGGNG. WE KNOW YOU'RE EXHAUSTED, AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I HAVE LEARNED, EVEN FROM MY KIDS DOING VERY LITTLE ONLINE WORK SO FAR, IS EVEN IF YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND IN EDUCATION, AND I PERSONALLY DO, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN TEACH YOUR KIDS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TEACHERS FOR, THANK GOODNESS. SO, THIS REALLY COULD BE ED I A LOT OFIFFERENT WAY, BUT IT JUST DOES GIVE ENOUGH SUPPORT, AND IT DOESN'T -- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EVERYTHING, BUT SOMETIMES JUST THAT LITTLE BIT THAT CAN SAY WE VALUE YOU, WE RECOGNIZE YOU. SO, I REALLY LOOK AT THIS AS VERY PASED TO SUPPT IT. D I'M
01:37:28.820: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERSPRESENT,HUS SATISFYI THE EIGHVOTE QUIREMENT. CA-1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE AMENDMENT NUMBER 2 TO THE RECYCLING PLANT TOURS CONTRACT WITH THE ECOLOGY CENTER, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECOND DISCUSSION PLEASE OF CA-1, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:38:14.265: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I PULLED THIS ONE FROM THE CONSENT AGENDA BECAUSE I QUESTION THE NECESSITY OF CONTINUING THIS PROJECT. WE DID RECYCLING PLANT TOURS -- ISTARTED IN 2013 AS YO MAY HA READN THE MOS, AND S WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. IT WILL BE GOING ON NINE YEARS BY THE END OF THE CONTRACT, IF THIS IS APPROVED TONIGHT. WE DO RECYCLING PLANT TOURS, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN OPERATIONAL RECYCLING PLANT RIGHT NOW, AND WE DO RECYCLING EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOL UNDER CONTRACT, AND WE DON'T HAVE EVEN SAID THAT TH IS GOING TO A VIDEERSION OF THAT. I AM NOT SURE HOW THAT'S GOING TO ENGAGE OUR KIDS IN THE PROCESS OF RECYCLING, AND I'M NOT COMPLETELY CERTAIN WHAT IT IS WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE. SO, YOU KNOW, WE'LL HAVE SPENT ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF THIS CONTRACT ON RECYCLING EDUCATION, AND I AM NOT COMPLETELY RTAIN THAT IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THIS. I THINK THE SCHOOLS COULD DO IT. I THINK HOMES AND PARENTS COULD DO IT, AND I QUESTION THE VALUE THAT WE GET FROM THIS PROGRAM. WE HAVE NEVER REALLY GONE BACK, AT THE COST-BENIT ANALYSO OOKED SEE WHAT IIS WE ARE GETTING FROM THIS; HAVE THESE LESSONS STUCK WITH THE CHILDREN? I MEAN, WE OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T DONE IT LONG ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO GROW UP TO BE ADULTS AND SEE IF THEY ARE RECYCLING ON THEIR OWN AND SO ON, BUT I JUST QUESTION THIS GREAT EXPENSE IN THESE TIMES OF A TIGHT BUDGET. SO I WANT TO PULL IT OFF, AND I'M NOT GOIN TO SPORT MING TH CONTRACT FORWARD, ESPECIAL AS IT IS WRITTEN HERE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT OTHER FOLKS SAY ABOUT IT. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A CRITICAL EXPENSE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU.
01:40:11.049: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:40:14.419: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU MR. HAYNER FOR PULLING THISUT AND SHING YOUR CONCNS. MYONCERN WITH THI CONTRACT, AND NOTED THIS IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I SUBMITTED, IS THAT THE EXISTING CONTRACT HAS A 6.3% INCREASE PER YEAR. I ASKED WHAT THE BASIS WAS FOR THAT INCREASE, WHETHER OR NOT THE SCOPE WAS CHANGING. THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE SCOPE. I JUST THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS TO HAVE THIS INCREASE WRITTEN INTO THE CONTRACT, AND MR. HUPY, IF YOU COULD -- OR MS. MAJESKI, IF EITHER OF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THIS, AGAIN, THERE'S NO CHANGE IN SCOPE, SO I DON'T UNDSTAND WHY WE WOULD BLD THAT INTO A CONTRACT. IT CERTAINLY EXCEEDS C.O.L.A. INFLATION, YOU NAME IT. SO THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THIS 6.3% COST INCREASE QUESTION.
01:41:24.289: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. HUPY, MS-- MR. HUPY, YOU'RE ON MUTE, I'M AFRAID.
01:41:33.765: >> THANK YOU. THE 6% INCREASE HAS BEEN IN THE CONTRACT, AND THIS IS CARRYING IT FORWARD, BUT I WILL DER TO MOLLY, WHO HAD DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ECOLOGY CENTER ON THIS AS TO THE DERIVATION.
01:41:59.324: >> THE CONTRACT WAS OFFERED AS AN EXTENSION AS IT STOOD, AND THAT INCLUDED THE 6% INCREASE.
01:42:14.639: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU. CAN WE AMEND THE CONTRACT ON THE FLOOR? YOU KNOW, YOUR RESPONSE, WHOEVER RESPONDED, THANK YOU, TO THE QUESTION, WAS THAT, YEAH, AS YOU COST INEASE, THIS6. THAT THIS INCREASE PER YEARS IN THE CONTRACT, AND, AGAIN, HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A CONTRACT THAT HAS NO CHANGE IN SCOPE YEAR TO YEAR, BUT THIS IS WRITTEN IN THE CONTRACT, AND I -- THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT IN THE TAXPAYERS' INTERESTS TO GRANT AN AUTOMATIC 6.3% INCREASE YEAR TO YEAR. , CAN WE AMEND THIS  THE OOR?
01:42:56.214: >> I WOULD LOOK TO LEGAL FOR THAT. YOU COULD AMEND WHAT YOU APPROVE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE ECOLOGY CENTER WOULD ACCEPT IT, NECESSARILY.
01:43:08.626: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PERHAPS LET ME SUGGEST THAT IF THAT'S A DESIRE THAT IT BE POSTPONED.
01:43:13.998: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  AY. THANYOU. LL MOVE TO POSTPONE TO SEPTEMBER 21ST.
01:43:21.572: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. IT'S POSTPONED TO OUR NEXT MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVISITING --

01:43:41.559: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ON THE POSTPONEMENT, I HAVE HAD HAYNER AND NELSON ON THE QUEUE. DO EITHER OF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THE POSTPONEMENT? HAYNER FIRST.
01:43:56.074: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  JUST BRIEFLY. I MEAN, KNOW WE HA A LOT ON OUR PLATE, WITH GELMAN COMING BEFORE IT AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS, BUT I'M INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS CONTRACT AND WHAT EXACT SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED FOR THIS, $360 A DAY, 365 DAYS A YEAR, PAYING THE ECOLOGY CENTER FOR WHAT? SO I WOULD NOT TO LIMIT THE POPONEMENTO ANY ONE WAY. I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT IT GENERALLY. I THINK THERE'S A TIE-IN WITH A2 ZERO AND SOME OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE FUNDING AND HAVE GOING ON, AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT DOUBLE PAYING OR HIRING OUTSIDE, A FIRM, A SOLE SOURCE, THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GRANTED T SOLE SOCE, EENTIALLY AN AOMATIC RENEWAL FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS NOW, AND SO I THINK IT'S WORTH EXPLORATION TO ME.
01:44:54.565: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:44:55.433: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY ARE BRINGING UP ABOUT THIS, AND I JUST WANT TO THROW OUT THE WILD IDEA THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S MIXED UP IN TSGENDA EM, I REALL WISH TT WE COULD DEVOTE THAT KIND OF MON TO SAVING THE REUSE CENTER. I'M JUST THROWING THAT OUT THERE. I'M AMONG THE MANY IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE REALLY, REALLY SADDENED TO HEAR ABOUT THE CLOSING OF THE REUSE CENTER. SO I'M JUST THROWING THAT OUT THERE.
01:45:19.524: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:45:20.591: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE NUMBERS ON IUES,ND THIS IS ONE WHERE, YEAH, THE WHOLE VIRTUALNESS OF THIS PROGRAM, YOU KNOW, IT REALLY TAKES AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE, I THINK, THAT YOU HAVE AS A YOUNGSTER GOING AND SEEING A FACILITY AND BEING IN PERSON AND REALLYAVING CONTEXTUAL EXPERIENCE WITH IT ALL. THE WHOLE VIRTUAL PART OF IT ALL JUST MAKES YOU WONDER IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE FOREGONE FOR A YEAR OR SO UNTIL IT ACTUALLY BECOMES BACK IN-PERSON. SO, WHEN IT DOES COME BACK, HOPEFULLY IL G M QUESTIONS IN ON TI. I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE -- I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE PRODUCT FOR $100,000 THAN SOME VIDEOS. WITH ALL DO RESPECT, I AM SURE IT COMES WITH MORE THAN THAT, BUT WE ARE IN SOME TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES, AND, YOU KNOW, THINGS HAVE GOT TO BE EXPLAED D JUSTIFIED EVEN MORE SO NOW THAN EVER BEFORE, AND SO JUST HAVE A -- YOU KNOW, THESE TYPE OF CONTRACTS THAT COME UP EVERGREEN OR PERPETUALLY, I THINK THEY NEED TO BE EXAMINED AS WE GO FORWARD, SO I WILL JUST PIGGYBACK ON WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER AND HOPEFUL HAVE ME INFORMATION, BAUSE I THINKT WILL COME DOWN TO MORE THAN JUST THE 6% INCREASE.
01:47:05.463: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:47:06.297: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS. I PROPOSE TO POSTPONE TO SEPTEMBER 21ST, AND THINKING NOW, GIVEN THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE ABOUT THE NTRACT ITSELF AND WHETHER OR NOT PERHAPS INSTEAD OF BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON THIS PARTICULAR CONTRACT, BUT PERHAPS REALLOCATING THIS MONEY TO THE MRF OPERATION INSTEAD, STAFF MIGHT NEED MORE TIME, SO WOULD MAYBE THE OCTOBER 5TH MEETING, POSTPONI IT TO TH OCTOBER 5 MEETING BE A BETTER MO? MR. HUPY OR --?
01:47:47.271: >> OCTOBER 5TH WOULD BE PREFERABLE. IT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE BREATHING SPACE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ECOLOGY CENTER.

DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF -11 BY
01:48:43.628: >> COUNCILMEER HAYNER: HANK U. I JUST WANT TO CALL THIS OUT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS PROGRAM, WHILE IT'S PROVIDING A, YOU KNOW, RELATIVE TO THE MARKET RATE HOUSING ON THIS SITE A PITTANCE OF AFFORDABILITY, IT DOES EXIST. WE ARE GETTING 15 UNITS FOR COLLECTI -- BASICALLY BY HE DEFERRING THE COLLECTION OF 5.2 MILLION IN PROPERTY TAXES FROM THIS PARCEL THROUGH THE BROWNFIELD PROGRAM, THE COUNTY, AND SO THAT IF WE WERE TO INVEST DIRECTLY IN THAT, YEAH IS $357,000 UNIT, AND SOF WE WE T ME THAT DIRECT INVESTMENT AS A CITY, I THINK WE COULD DO A LOT BETTER, AND JEN HALL HAS EVEN SAID THAT, THAT WE BUILD FOR MUCH LESS THAN $357,000 A UNIT. SO WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS, BECAUSE IT WAS S IN MOTION PRIOR T ME BNG ON COUNL, AND I CERTAINLY WANT THE 15 UNITS TO COME TO FRUITION, ALTHOUGH IT IS QUESTIONABLE THAT THEY WILL, BECAUSE EIGHT OF THEM ARE COMMITTED TO THE PHASE 3 OF THE PROJECT, WHICH IS ANYBODY'S GUESS WHEN THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND SO I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD THIS, BUT I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT THE BEST DEAL FOR THE CITY WE HAVE GOT GOING HERE. IN FACT, IS A VERYOOR DEAL FOR THECITY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRIDING ANIT AND THE PER UNITOST. IT'S ABOUT $100,000 MORE A UNIT THAN WE WOULD PAY IF WE ACQUIRED PROPERTY AND BUILT THEM OURSELVES. SO THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING FOR THE COMMUNITY ALL THE WAY AROUND, AND SO I JUST FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO CALLHAT OUT ANSAY THAT. IT CAMEHROUGH -- IT CAME IN FRONT OF ME ON BWNFIELD. YOU KNOW, I WASN'T HAPPY WITH IT THEN. I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT THEN, AND I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT IT NOW, BUT I'M GOING TO ASSUME IT'S GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. I THINK IT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL. IT'S A WAY TO GET A LITTLE FOR A LOT. THANK YOU.

01:53:43.394: >> THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:53:46.230: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES WE CAN.
01:53:46.997: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR TAOR. I WOD LIKE TO MENTION TYOU BEFORE MY TIME STARTS THAT WE HAD DIFFICULTY CALLING IN ON THE 877 NUMBER TONIGHT. THE 213 NUMBER WORKED, SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO MENTION THAT TO CALLERS THAT ARE LISTENING ON THE WEB.
01:54:04.448: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
01:54:05.049: >> OKAY. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK. MYAME IS CAROL SKALA, AND I'M FROM THE FOURTH WARD. I AM RESPECTFULLY ASKING THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL TO TAKE A THOUGHTFUL LOOK AT HOW THIS BEGAN AND WHERE WE GOT TO TODAY. A FEW RESIDENTS WERE FEARING THAT SPRS WERE BECOMING PARTY HOMES WITH NO OVERSIGHT AND VING A NEGATE IMPACT ON RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. ONE WOMAN INCESSANTLY BADGERED CITY HALL AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DEMANDING THAT SOMETHING BE DONE. ONCE THE POT WAS STIRRED, SHE FELL SILENT AND HAS NOW MOVED OUT AND ON. SO THE COMPLAINTS DWINDLED, AND FEARS CLAIMING NEIGHBORHOOD DEGRADATION THAT WOULD NOT RESULT IN GULATION, S W MOVED ON IT AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING THREAT. I'M SORRY IF THAT WASN'T UNDERSTANDABLE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED FOR THE RECORD THAT AIRBNB HAS NOW ENACTED A BAN ON HOME PARTIES AND PLACED REASONABLE LIMITS ON OCCUPANCY. VIOLATORS WILL LOSE THE PLATFORM. ANN ARBOR HOSTS DIDN'T REALLY NEED THAT,ECAUSE NONE OF THE WANT AND FEW ALLOW PARTIES DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGE AND DISRUPTION. NONETHELESS, AIRBNB HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE AS THEY SHOULD BE AND AS OUR GROUP HAS BEEN. WHEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAME THE TARGET, IT WAS CLEAR SBRS WOULD BECOME THE HOUSING SCAPEGOAT FOR A CITY UNABLE TO CREATE SUBSTANTIAL AFFORDABLE HOUSG, EVE IN NEW DEVELOENTS. WHEN THE CITY WAS UNABLE TO REFUTE THOSE FACTS, THEY TURNED THE MATTER OVER TO CITY STAFF TO FIND A BETTER ARGUMENT. WE ARE NOW BEING HELD OUT AS ILLEGAL BUSINESSES IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES. DESPITE USECURING PERMITS AS D, RENTALS, WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO DO ANYTHING BEYOND THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN A RENTAL OF ONE DAY OR 365. WE ARE THE SAME AS STUDENT RENTALS OR LONG TERM RENTALS IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. THE CITY HAS POSTED THEIR POSITION LIKE A CHAMELEON WHO CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT CAMO CAMOUFLAGE, AND NOW THE CITY RISKS A LAWSUIT AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE. WHEN THE DUST SETTLES, THE TAXPAYERS WILL LOOK BACK AT THE MANIPULATION OF THIS EFFORT TO PUT LEGALLY OPERATING RENTALS OUT OF BUSINESS FOR A HANDFUL OF COMPLAINTS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATELY HANDLED BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND NUISANCE ORDINCES. THE VOTES WILL BE 99% OTHE SIDE OF THE LAW AND 1% FOR THE WOMAN WHO BECAME A NUISANCE. THE CITY WILL LIKELY LOSE ANY BATTLE ON INTEGRITY, THUS APPEARING AS A GOVERNING BODY WHO CAN'T AND WON'T GOVERN FAIRLY WHEN REQUIRED TO DO SO. THANK YOU.
01:57:01.191: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
01:57:08.665: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 111. DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER 111, YOU'RE STILL MUTED. DO YOU HAVA COMMEN
01:57:29.219: >> YES, THANK YOU. MY NAME IS DR. MARGARET POSHER. I LIVE AT 1204 BROOKLYN AVENUE IN ANN ARBOR. YOU HAVE HEARD FROM MY WIFE, HE HEIDI POSHER RARDING THE STR ORDINANCE BEFORE YOU. I HAVE WATCHED THE NON-RESIDENT STR OWNER GROUP UP CLOSE. I HAVE WATCHED AS THEY HAVE ENGAGED WITH CITY STAFF AND COUNCIL ON THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION. THEY HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FACTS, PATIENTLY ADVOCATED FOR THEIR RIGHTS, AND RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED MOR OF VOI IN THE PROCESS, ABRIDGING COMPETING INTERESTS ON THIS MATTER. IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT THAT COUNCIL SHOULD WANT. ONLY THE MOST GALVANIZED COUNCILMEMBERS COULD HAVE LISTENED TO THEIR ENGAGEMENT AND LISTENED TO THE INFORMATION THEY PRESENTED AND CONTINUED TO BELIEVE AND EVEN ASSER THA N-RESIDENT STR OWNERS ARE JUST OUTSIDERS TRYING TO GET RICH AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS. I NEED TO REITERATE THIS:  THE GROUP OF NON-RESIDENT STR OWNERS IS MADE UP OF LOCALS, AND THE DECISION YOU MAKE ON THIS NEIGHBORS. ILL IMPACT YOUR YOU OULD KNOW THAT THIS GROUP OF ABOUT 50 PROPERTY OWNERS IS UNIFIED BY THE UNFAIRNESSF THIS PROPOSED ORDINCE. E CITY OF ANN ARBOR ESTABLISHED THE RULES GOVERNING RENTALS. THESE PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE FOLLOWED THE RULES AND OPERATED LEGALLY. THIS ORDINANCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPAND A TECHNICALITY IN THE RULES THAT THE CITY ESTABLISHED TO NOW DECLARE THESE OPERATIONS ILLEGAL. IN ORDER TDOTHIS, T CY HAS DISGUISED THIS LEGISLATION AS REGULATORY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT CLEARLY RELATES TO ZONING. NOT ONLY IS THIS ILLEGAL UNDER MICHIGAN LAW, IT IS ALSO TREMENDOUSLY UNFAIR. WITH THIS PROPOSED ORDINANCE, THE CITY PUTS THESE TAX-PAYING PROPERTY OWNERS IN A TERRIBLE POSITION. THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SPEND THEITIME AND HHER LEGAL COUNSEL  DEFEND RIGHTS THAT ALREADY EXIST. IF COUNSEL PASSES THIS ORDINANCE, THEY WILL BE FORCING TAXPAYERS WHO RUN LEGAL BUSINESSES TO SUE THE CITY IN ORDER TO ENJOY RIGHTS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED. I ASK YOU TO IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THIS POSITION AND CONSIDER HOW DETERMINED YOU WOULD B T FIGHT TH OUTRAGEOUSLUNFAIR LEGISLATION.
02:00:03.140: >> CITY CLERK:  30 SECONDS.
02:00:04.074: >> I IMAGINE YOU WOULDN'T STAND FOR IT AND WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO FIGHT FOR THESE RIGHTS. ACCORDINGLY, I HOPE YOU WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THESE TAXPAYERS AND THE CITY BY SENDING THIS ORDINANCE BACK TO LEGAL NONRESIDENT SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS FAIRLY, THROUGH CREATION OF AN EXEMPTION. THANK YOU.
02:00:30.967: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. IF I CAN PAUSE BRIEFLY, IF LISTENERS TH ARE HAVING DIFFICTY DIALING IN ON THE 877 OR THE 888 NUMBER, PLEASE ENTER THE FOLLOWING NUMBER, THE 213 NUMBER. THAT IS TO SAY 213-338-8477, 213-338-8477. THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED. MY APOLOGIES.
02:01:14.511: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 097. CALLER WITH 097, GO AHD.
02:01:28.058: >> THANKYOU. I'M AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING -- LLC, WHOSE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES BOTH LONG AND SHORT-TERM RENTALS. TONIGHT, I WANT TO ADDRESS THE SUGGESTION THAT THE PRESENT OPERATION OF STRs IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS IS ILLEGAL UNDER THE CURRENT UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. I ASSURE YOU, THEY ARE NOT. TO SUGGEST STRS ARE CURRENTLY ILLEGAL. ONE IS THEY ARE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY THAT SOMEHOW MAKES THEIR OPERATION IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS ILLEGAL. THE SUGGESTION INVARIABLY IGNORES THE COROLLARY THAT IF OPERATING ASTR IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS ARE ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, THEN CURRENTLY ALL RENTALS ARE ILLEGAL. IN FACT, THE UDC MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN OWNER-OCCUPIED DWELLINGS AND RENTALS. RENTING AS A DISTINCT ACTIVITY N MENTIONED. INDEED, QUOTE, "USE OF LANDS OF BUILDINGS BY TENANTS OR OVERNIGHT USE." SIMPLY STATED, IF OCCUPANCY NEEDS ARE MET, RENTING FOR ANY LENGTH OF STAY IS A LEGAL U WITHIN A RESIDTIAL DISTRICT. THE SECOND ARGUMENT MADE AGAINST STRs' CURRENT LAWFUL USE IS THAT THEY ARE HOTELS OR BED AND BREAKFAST ESTABLISHMENTS SUBJECT TO SPECIAL REGULATION, REFERENCED IN OTHER CASES RELYING ON A VAGUE AND BROAD DEFINITIONF HOTEL. HOVER, ANN ARR'S DEFINITION OF HOTELS AND BED AND BREAKFASTS DO NOT APPLY TO STRs, WHICH IS DEFINED AS A BUILDING CONTAINING FOUR OR MORE INDIVIDUAL ROOMS OR DWELLING UNITS OFFERED FOR TRANSIENT SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PERIODS OF [ OFF MIC ] OR LESS. DEFINION, A RENTAL IT OF LESS THAN FOUR BEDROOMS CANNOT BE A HOTEL. INDEED IF A MULTIPLE BEDROOM HOUSE IS RENTED AS A WHOLE, IT IS A SINGLE DWELLING UNIT, NOT FOUR. SIMPLY STATED, STRs ARE NOT HOTELS, NOR ARE STRs BED AND BREAKFASTS. A B&B IS NARROWLY DEFINED AS ONE OF TWO TYS, ONE, A BEDND BRKFAST PRINCIPLE, A TYPE OF HOTEL, OR A BED AND BREAKFAST ACCESSORY, A BUILDING DESIGNATED AS A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING OF THREE OR LESS GUESTS. A REVIEW OF THE UDC CONFIRMS THAT STRs, AS WE HAVE STATED, ARE NOT HOTELS AND SO ARE NOT PRINCIPLE B&Bs, SO TOO AN STR WHERE THE OPERATOR DOES NOT LIVE ON PREMISE IS NOT AN ACCESSORY B&B. THANK YOU.
02:04:34.244: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:04:48.291: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER 111?
02:04:56.032: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS PAT LENIN. I'M AN ATTORNEY. I REPRESENT NOAHOFFMAN A OTHERSHO ARE OPPOSINGHE PROPOSED STR ORDINANCE IN ITS CURRENT FORM. YOU HAVE MY LETTERS FROM JULY 16TH AND OUR COMMENTS FROM THE AUGUST MEETING AND THE SUPPLEMENT THAT WE SUBMITTED ON AUGUST 19TH. IT'S CLEAR, THE STATE HAS SPOKEN WITH RESPECT TO SHORT-TERM RENTAL ORDINANCES AND HOW THEY ARE HANDLED UNDER THE LAW. IN SPRING LAKE, THE COURT OF APPEALS AND TICHIGAN SUPREME COURT HE THAT IF A SHORT-TERM RENTAL WAS LAWFUL PRIOR TO A SHORT-TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE, THEN THE OWNER HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE USING THE PROPERTY FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS AFTER IMPOSITION OF THE ORDINANCE. THIS HOLDING IS A PREVAILING LAW ACROSS THE STATE AND SHOULD BE APPLIED HERE. AT WORST, IN THISCASE, THE LEGALLY EXISTING USAGE SHOULD RECEIVE THE EQUIVALENT OF LEGAL NONCONFORMING USE STATUS. THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE AND WOULD BE THE FAIR RESULT IN THIS SITUATION. THE IDEA THAT LEGAL NONCONFORMING USE STATUS MIGHT NOT APPLY BECAUSE A PROPOSED ORDINANCE IS PURPORTEDLY REGUTORY AND DOE NOT HAVE NING ORDINCE DOESOT HAV LEGAL MERIT. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AN ORDINANCE IS A ZONING ORDINANCE IS NOT BASED UPON WHERE IT IS LODGED WITHIN THE MUNICIPAL ORDINANCES. IT IS ABOUT ITS POSITION IN RELATION TO ZONING WITHIN THE CI, DISTRICT AREASR LOCAONS. IN THIS CASE, THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE IS OBVIOUSLY A ZONING ORDINANCE AND WOULD ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, NOT REGULATE, SHORT-TERM RENTAL USES IN AREAS WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY PERMITTED. TO MY POINT, THESE EXISTING USES HAVE BEEN LAWFUL IN THE CITY FOR AGES,ND THEY HAVEEEN WELLNOWN TO THE CITY, THEY ARE STRE REGISTERED WITH THE CITY, AND THEY HOLD CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE. IN MY VIEW, THERE IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION. ALLOW SHORT-TERM RENTALS TO CONTINUE. IT WOULD ALIGN WITH PREVAILING MICHIGAN LAW, IT WOULD HONOR INVESTMENTS COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE MADE IN THEIR HOMES, ANDT ULD, IF STRUCTURED CORRECTLY, REDUCE SHORT-TERM RENTAL USAGE OVER TIME. THIS WOULD BE THE MOST FAIR FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND IS THE APPROACH THAT THE CITY SHOULD ADOPT. WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL DO SO, AND WE ARE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR BE A PART OF ANY PROCESS THAT LEADS TO AN ORDINANCE THAT CREATES A SHORT-TERMENTAL USES. LAWFUL THANK YOU.
02:07:41.531: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:07:56.813: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 400. CALLER AREA CODE 906 ENDING IN
02:08:10.593: >> OK, SORRY ABO THAT. THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR, AND COUNCILMEMBERS FOR YOUR ATTENTION THIS EVENING. MY NAME IS BEN. I'M A FIFTH WARD RESIDENT, A COMBAT RESIDENT, AND A BLUE COLLAR WORKER. I'M CALLING IN TONIGHT TO A BAN ON SHORTERM RENTALS IS T NECESSARY. DURING LAST MONTH'S MEETING, THE MAYOR AGREED THAT THE CITY VALUES HAVING THEM AVAILABLE FOR FAMILIES DURING RENOVATIONS OR FOR FAMILY VISITING OUT OF TOWN. WE ARE NOT A BUNCH OF INVESTORS OR REPRESENTATIVES OF A LARGE CORPORATION. WE JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A VALUE TO THEOMMUNITY TOUGH T SERVE OF OUR PROPEY. WE ARE AN ASSET TO THE COMMUNITY. I RECENTLY HOSTED A HOME WHILE A FAMILY WAS HAVING RENOVATIONS WHICH CREATED DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR FIFTH WARD HOME. JUST LAST WEEK, WE PROVID SAFE PLACE FOR PARTS MING THEIR COLLEGE-AGED KIDS INTO A DORM. WE WERE ALSO RECENTLY CONTACTED BY A DIVORCED MOTHER OF TWO IN TRAVERSE CITY. THEY NEEDED A STEADY RELIABLE PLACE THAT FELT MORE LIKE A HOME WHILE SHE WAS IN TOWN VISITING HER ILDRENVERY WEEKEN MAR TAYLOR SAID JUST LAST MONTH THAT ISSUE -- IMPACTING MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES. IN THAT CASE, COMMON SENSE LEADERSHIP PREVAILED. TO FURTHER THIS POINT, 64% OF MY GUESTS IN SEPTEMBER WILL BE COMING FROM LESS THAN 300 MILES OF FOUR NITS. NG FOR AN ARAGE ESE FOLKS ARE NOT JUST STRANGERS PASSING THROUGH FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME. THEY ARE CONNECTED TO ANN ARBOR THROUGH THEIR FAMILY, THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY, AND THROUGH THE HOSPITAL. THEY CARE ABOUT ANN ARBOR AND ITS FANTASTIC NEIGHBORHOODS JUST LIKE WE ALL DO. MAKING DECISIONS THAT DEEPLY IMPACT THE LIV OF YR CONSTITUTS IS YOUR MT IMPORTANT DECISION AS CIVIC LEADERS. I ASK YOU TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND ENACT LAW IN A WAY THAT IS MOST FAIR FOR ALL INVOLVED. SIMPLY PUT, THIS IS A PROPERTY RIGHTS ISSUE. SHOW US THAT YOU ARE LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS, AND CONCERNS OF THOSE RESIDENTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS LIKE YOU, I DEFINITELYANT MOR AFFOABLE HOUSG. AS A RESIDENT IN THE FIFTH WARD, I ABSOLUTELY WANT QUIET AND PEACEFUL NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT I ALSO WANT MY RIGHTS AS A PROPERTY OWNER TO BE RESPECTED WITHIN THIS ORDINANCE. PLEASE VOTE NO ON THIS ORDINANCE, AND WORK WITH CITY STAFF TO DRAFT AN AMENDMENT TO THIS AMENDMENT TO ALLOW FOR NOONFORMIN USE STATUS FOR SHORT TERM-TERM RENTAL OWNERS CURRENTLY OPERATING IN THE CITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION.
02:11:26.456: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:11:36.432: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLERITH THE PHONE NUMB ENDING I 6, LLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 556, YOU CAN SPEAK.
02:11:46.142: >> HI, RALPH McKEE FROM THE FIFTH WARD. I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU AND EMAILED YOU ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE, BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE AN IMPORTANT POINT. THAT IS SIMPLY THAT YOU DO NOT VE TO DECE TONIGHT WHETHER OR NOT TO GRAFATHER THE CURRENT NONPRINCIPLE RESIDENT STR OWNERS IN. IF YOU ENACT THE ORDINANCE, YOU HAVE 45 DAYS TO DISCUSS THE GRANDFATHERING ISSUE WITH THE OWNERS, AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT HERE, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T -- ALL OF THE OWNERS HAVE REPRESENTED THEMSVES TO BE MOM AN POPS, AND THA MAY WILL BE TRUE NOW, BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE TWO MONTHS, THREE MONTHS, SIX MONTHS, A YEAR FROM NOW. IF YOU DON'T ACT NOW, WE COULD HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE COMING IN FROM OUT OF TOWN AND EXPANDING WHAT'S THERE NOW TO A MUCH DIFFERENT DEGREE. AND YOU HAVE THOSE 45 DAYS, AND IN THAT TIME, CY ATTORNE COULD  ANY ADDITIONAL RESEARCH,EGOTIATE WITH THE STR OWNERS, BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO GRANDFATHER THEM IN. THAT PERIOD COULD BE EXTENDED IF YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS. IF YOU REACH AN IMPASSE, YOU COULD CHOOSE NOT TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE AGAINST THEM WHILE THE MATTER IS LITIGATED TO ELIMINATE ANY MONETARY DAMAGE CLAI THEY ALSO, Y COULD CHOOSE TO SUE THEM INSTEAD OF VICE VERSA SO THAT YOU COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTROL THE LITIGATION. THERE ARE LOTS OF OPTIONS FOR A DECISION LATER. TO SUM UP, AGAIN, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION TODAY. LET'S FOCUS ON THE EQUITIES. THE STR OWNERS ARE FOND OF ARGUING FAIRNESS. IF YOU PASS THIS DINANCE, THE CURRENT NON-PEONAL RESIDENT STR OWNERS IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHO ARE GRANDFATHERED, LET'S ASSUME THEY ARE GRANDFATHERED IN, THEY HAVE A MONOPOLY, NO NEW COMPETITION EVER. THAT'S VALUABLE. ACCORDING TO THEM, THERE'S ONLY I WOULD ARGUE TT FAIRNESS REQUIRES PAYING SOMETHING FOR THE MONOPOLY. THEY ARE NOT RUNNING A NONPROFIT, MAYBE AN EQUIVALENT TO A HOTEL OCCUPANCY TAX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR GRANDFATHERING THEM IN FOR A WHILE AND THEN PHASING THEM OUT. ON LEGAL ISSUES, STRS CLAIM TT THEY HAVE LEGAL NONCONFORMING USES. THIS MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH. IN FACT, THE VERY COURT OF APPEALS CASE SIGHTED IN THE ROEHM CASE CITED HELD THAT IT WASN'T ENOUGH. THE SECOND ARGUMENT THAT THEY ARE LEGAL UNDER THE OLD ORDINANCE, TT'S A MORE COMPLICATEISSUE AND RUIRES MORE RESEARCH, BUT THERE ARE CASES THAT WOULD INDICATE OTHERWISE, AND I'M NOT PREDICTING A WINNER, BUT I THINK THAT IS NOT A GIMME, AS IT WAS PUT BY THE LAWYERS FOR THE OWNERS. THANK YOU.
02:14:50.359: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:14:56.699: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 660. CALLER 660, YOU CAN GO AHEAD. CALLER 0, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE MUTED. IF YOU PRESS STAR 6 TO UNMUTE.
02:15:19.288: >> OKAY. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
02:15:23.893: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YOU BET WE CAN.
02:15:25.928: >> SORRY ABOUT THAT. MY NAME IS RUE NEEDLER. I LIVE IN THE FOURTH WARD. I'M AHOMEOWNER. I HA LIVED I ANN ARB FOR ABOUT 20 ARS, AND I'M A TAXPAYER. I'M A VOTER. I'M A REGULAR PERSON, JUST LIKE ALL OF YOU, AND I'M CALLING TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR THE NON-RESIDENTIAL STR OWNERS, NON-OWNER OCCUPIED NON-RESIDENTIAL, AND I BELIE THATHEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED CONTUE TO OPERAT, AND THAT'S ALL I CALLED ABOUT. THANKS.
02:16:05.601: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.

02:16:26.922: >> HI. MY NAME IS KATIE, AND I'M A HOMEOWNER IN THE FOURTH WARD. I AM SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE GROWN TIRED OF HEARING MY VOICE, AND SO MANY OTHERS, ON THIS MATTER. IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HAVE GOTTEN HERE. FROM A NUISANCE AND NOISE ISSUE, IT'S NOW EVOED TO ZONIN ISSUE. BUT THIS COMES DOWN TO HOMEOWNERS RIGHTS, WELL ESTABLISHED AND THAT THE MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT HAS AFFIRMED. WE HAVE PLEADED OUR CASE TO YOU. YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE NUMEROUS LOCAL FAMILIES THAT WOULD BE SEVERELY FINANCIALLY OCCUPIED IF YOU CHOOSED TO BAN NONOWNER OCCUPIED AIRBNBS IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES. AT THE LASTOUNCIL MEETING, TY ATTORNEYS STATED THAT PROVIDING LEGAL FEEDBACK REGARDING THE LEGALITY WITH REGARD TO THE FEES OF AIRBNBS IN ANN ARBOR WOULD BE NO PROBLEM. THERE WERE TWO BUSINESS DAYS OVER A HOLIDAY WEEKEND TO PROVIDE THOUGHTFUL REVIEW ON A NDFUL OF QUESTIONS AND GET QUESTIS ANSWERED BY TODAY. WE WERE SURPRISED BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TOOK, AND PROVIDING AN ANSWER AT THE LATE BREAKING HOUR DOES NOT SEEM LIKE GOOD GOVERNMENT. IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE GIVEN AMPLE TIME TO READ AND RESPOND TO ADVICE FROM CITY ATTORNEYS. AT THE VERY LEAST, I ASKIN YOTO PLEASE PTPONE THIS TTER UNTIL THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME CAN BE PROVIDED TO EVERYONE TO DO CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL REVIEW OF INFORMATION TO INFORM YOUR VOTE. PLEASE DO UNDERSTAND THAT AIRBNBS DO SERVE A PURPOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT IS VALUABLE TO OUR RESIDENTS, AND ONLY A SMALL SLICE OF GUESTS ARE TOURISTS. MANY ARE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY, RE TO VISIT FAMILY, LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO ARE RENOVATING THEIR HOMES OR ARE SEEKING MEDICAL CARE AT U OF M. WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE CONSIDER THE GOOD THAT AIRBNBS HAVE TO OFFER OUR COMMUNITY. I AM ASKING TONIGHT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL DEMONSTRATE FAIRNESS TO THOSE THAT ARE NOW THATENEDY AN ORDINANCE THAT COD SIGNIFICALY IMPACT O LIVELIHOODS. I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR MANY OF US WHEN I SAY THAT I DO NOT OBJECT TO PASSING THIS ORDINANCE FOR FUTURE RESTRICTIONS. HOWEVER, PLEASE BE FAIR TO  -- AND GRANT US THE SAME STATUS AS YOU DID MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES. THANK YOU.
02:18:59.742: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:19:00.810: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 646? CALLER 646? YOU CAN SPEAK.
02:19:08.484: >> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
02:19:09.819: >> YES, WE CAN.
02:19:12.621: >> THANK YOU. MYAME I KE AND I WLD LIKE TO ERESS MY CONRN OVER THE PROPOSED STR ORDINANCE AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN, LARGELY UNCHANGED FOR MANY WEEKS. THE ANTAGONISTIC AND PROBLEMATIC TONE USED BY SOME HERE ON COUNCIL AND REFLECTED HERE IN THIS ORDINANCE SEEKS TO PROMOTE AN US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY AMONGST MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY, BECAUSE THAT'S WHO COMMUNITY O LIVE A WOR IN S THIS CITY, YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHOSE INTERESTS YOU REPRESENT. AN EXCELLENT QUESTION WAS BROUGHT UP LAST MEETING, WHICH DESERVES GREATER ATTENTION. TO PARAPHRASE MY FAVORITE TALKING HEADS SONG, HOW DID WE GET HERE? SPEARHEADED BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MOVED TO TOWN FROM SANTA BARBARA LAST YE, AFTER SUCCESSFULL CAMPGNING TO BAN SHORT-TERM RENTALS ON THAT CITY, WHO RELAUNCHED THEIR ANTI-STR CAMPAIGN HERE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. AFTER ALL, THESE TRANSIENTS SOMEHOW REPRESENTED "OTHER" AND PRESENTED A PROBLEM TT NEEDED CITY INVVEMENT. THERE WERE LISTENING SESSIONS LAST FALL THAT WERE WELL ATTENDED, ALTHOUGH MISMANAGED, WITH THE OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS BEING THAT LIGHT TO NO REGULATION WOULD BE THE BEST APPROACH, ESPECIALLY TO START. COUNCILMEMBERS EVEN ASSURED ME DIRECTLY THAT THE GOAL WAS NOT TO EMINATE STRs BO GET RID OF THE BAD APPLES AND THAT RESPONSIBLE OWNERS, LICENSED AND INSPECTED, WOULD NOT BE TARGETED. DESPITE THE WILL OF PEOPLE EXPRESSING THIS OUTCOME, COUNCIL CHOOSE ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OPTIONS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT AND WAS DIRECTED TO DRAFT THIS ORDINANCE PRESENTED TO YOU TONIGHT. E BANNING OF MOST NONOWNER OCCUPIED STRs IN THE COMMUNITY WILL HARM THOSE WHO RELY ON THEM, ESPECIALLY IN THE TIME OF COVID. IT ELIMINATES PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OPTIONS FOR CITY VISITORS, MANY WHO PREFER THE COMFORT AND PRIVACY OF STRS AND WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFD TRADITIONA OPTION THE IS NO TA SHOWING HIGHER RATE OF NOISE COMPLAINTS AT STRs OVER TRADITIONAL RENTALS OR HOUSEHOLDS. THE SIMPLE FACT IS ANN ARBOR DOES NOT CURRENTLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN RENTALS BASED ON LENGTH OF STAY, NOT IN THE HOUSING CODE OR IN THE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT CODE. THEREFORE, CURRENT OPERATING STRs HAVE THE VERY DEFINITION OF -- I ASK THAT COUNCIL TAKE A DO NO HARM APPROACH. PLEASE SEND THIS ORDINANCE BACK TO CITY STAFF TO ADD PROVISIONS GRANDFATHERING LEGALLY OPERATING NONOWNER OCCUPIED STRs. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

02:22:35.524: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME? MY NAME IS LOLA. I AM A CITY OF ANN ARBOR RESIDENT IN WARD 2, AND I AM A HOMEOWNER, AND I'M ONE OF THE OWNERS OF A SHO-TERM RENTA RE IN TOWN. I LIVE FIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM THE PROPERTY THAT I OWN, THAT WE TAKE CARE OF, AND WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING LEGALLY FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. I WA TO TAKE A MOMT TO RECOIZE THAT THERE ARE ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS WHO USE THIS PROPERTY FOR VARIOUS NEEDS. THERE WAS A HOMEOWNER IN ANN ARBOR WHOSE HOUSE BURNT DOWN, AND THEY WERE RENOVATING. THEY WERE A FAMILY OF FOUR WITH TWO HIGH SCHOOL AGED STUDENTS, AND THE APARTMENT THEY WERE RENTING, WHILE THEIR HOUSE WAS RENOVATED, WAS KICKING THEM OUT, D SO THEY RE DESPERATEO FIND PLACE, AND MY PROPERTY CAME ONLIN, AND THEY JUMPED ON IT, BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST PLACE THAT THEY COULD FIND TO ACCOMMODATE THEM FOR OVER 30 DAYS. THEY WERE SO GRATEFUL. EY CANNOT G AND RENT A HOME BECAUSE TH ARE A FAMILY OF FOUR, AND THEY WERE IN A DESPERATE NEED, BECAUSE THEIR HOUSE BURNED DOWN. SO, I'M ASKING THE CITY TO REALLY TAKE THIS BACK AND RECONSIDER WHAT THEY ARE TRULY DOING TO THIS COMMUNITY. E MAY WAS ABLE TO GRANDFHER IN MIJUANA DISPENSARIES, WHO BY AND LARGE HAVE PEOPLE COME IN FROM OUT OF TOWN TO DO BUSINESS IN ANN ARBOR, BUT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO CONSIDER ITS OWN RESIDENTS, PEOPLE LIKE ME, AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SUCH POLICY ON OUR LIVES.

02:27:37.726: >> MAYORAYLOR:  YES, WE CAN.
02:27:39.628: >> HI. I'M IN WARD FOUR. I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY SAY THAT I DON'T PERSONALLY HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I HAVE USED THEM IN OTHER PLACES, AND THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HAVE THEM AROUND HERE AND THERE. IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE THE CITY IS PARTICULARLY OVERRUN WITH THEM RIGHTOW. I AM GENERALLY IN FAVOR OF HAVING THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN THIS ORDINANCE IMPLEMENTED. HOWEVER, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AROUND THE GRANDFATHERING SITUATION. THING AOUPLE OF WEEKS AGO  GOOD ABOUT PONTIALLY LEAVIN THE LOCATION REGULATION OUT BUT THE REST OF THE REGULATIONS IN THERE TO AVOID ALL OF THESE THREATS OF LAWSUITS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED THAT, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY COUNCIL MEETING FOR THE LAST TWO MONS CALLERS TT ARE UPSETBOUT THAT PARTICUR THING. I THINK WE CAN GET A LOT OF THE BENEFIT OF REGULATION WITHOUT HAVING TO FIGHT A PROTRACTED LEGAL BATTLE, IF WE WERE TO MODIFY IT SO THAT WE WERE REGULATING BUT NOT PROHIBITING THEM IN A LOT OF THE CITY. SPECIFICALLY, WITH RESPECT TO GRANDFATHERING, I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THE IDEA OF GIVING A MONOPOLY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTALS AS THE PREVIOUS CALLER HAD MENTIONED. THAT SEEMS LIKE A RECIPE FOR STRANGE PRICE AND INFLATION AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THAT'S IT FOR ME. THANKS.
02:29:36.144: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHOOULD KE TO SPE AT THIS PUIC HEING? SEEING NO ONE --
02:30:05.107: >> CITY CLERK:  I SEE IN OTHER HANDS UP. OTHER PELE, WE ARE GOINGO TAKE A BREAK -- I SEE ANOTHER PERSON.
02:30:17.586: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER WITH THE
02:30:19.187: >> LLO, I'M CALLING ALSO 2? AGAIN -- I TALKED THE LAST TIME REGARDING THIS -- YOU KNOW, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THING -- TO THE WORK DONE BY STAFF, BECAUSE, REALLY, WE HAVE BEEN -- I AM THE OWNER OF A SRT-TERM RENTA IN TOWN HERE, AND EN IN THE MIDST OF COVID HERE, WE HAVE BEEN, EVEN WITH THIS PANDEMIC GOING ON, WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS TOWN DUE TO VARIOUS HEALTH REASONS PREFERRED TO SY IN A PLACE THAT THEY CAN KEEP TO THEMSELVES, AND EVEN PEOPLE COMING INTO TOWN TO VISIT FAMILY MEMBERS IN TOWN THAT ARE STAYING AND QUARANTINING IN WITH US, PEOPLE WHO HAVE PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL. I REALLY THINK THAT WE ARE MISSING A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE, UNLESS IF THERE'S ANOTH MOTIVE BEHIND THIS, WE ARE REALLY MISSING A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE TO ACTUALLY SHOW THE TRUTH OF WHAT ANN ARBOR IS. AND I THINK WITH US JUST RUNNING AND RUNNING THROUGH THIS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO -- WE ARE TURNING OUR BACKS AGAINST A LOT OF PARTICULARLYN TIME LIKE EDS THIS. I THINK THIS THING -- IT'S BEEN RUN THROUGH THE COUNCIL RIGHT NOW, I THINK THE RIGHT THING, THE APPROPRIATE THING, THE LEGAL THING, THE JUST THING TO DO FOR A COUNCIL LIKE THIS IN A TOWN, IN A CITY WITH THIS KIND OF REPUTATION IS TO DO THE RIGHT ING AND DO TT APPRRIATELY, RATHER THAN RUNNING IT THROUGH JUST TO BEAT A DEADLINE, WHATEVER THE DEADLINE IS. I THINK THIS IS A TIME THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COUNCIL NEEDS TO TALK TO THINK WITHIN THEMSELVES. BECAUSE EACH ONE OF YOU USE SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN YOUR TRAVELS, AND THERE ARE REASONS THATOU DO, ANDOU NEED TO FORD THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL. SOME OF YOU ARE -- SOME OF YOU WHO ARE SPEARING THIS ARE ALSO BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ALSO UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLE THAT EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS IS GO GOGOING THROUGH -- EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS IS GOING THROUGH AT THIS TIME. AND, AS A RESULT, THIS IS NOT A TIME TO DOUBLE UP ON SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS AND TRYING TO CONTINUE TO RUN THEIR BUSINESSES. WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SOME HEAT, BECAUSE OUR COUNCIL ELECT  HEAT MEMBERS, THEY ARE NOT REALLY LISTENING TO US IF -- ON THE WHOLE ISSUE IN THE TIME OF A PANDEMIC. I REALLY URGE THE COUNCIL --
02:33:38.386: >> TIME.
02:33:39.154: >> -- TO REALLY SEND THIS THING BACK FOR STAFF TO LOOK AT.
02:33:45.860: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.

02:45:45.645: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO, RESUTION TO APPROVE HOME2 HOTEL AT EISENHOWER PARKWAY. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING, PLEASE ENTER STAR 9 NOW. STAR 9.
02:46:10.204: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONEUMBER 815,O YOU HAVE AOMMENT?
02:46:19.113: >> HI, EVERYBODY HEAR ME?
02:46:25.019: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES, SIR, WE CAN.
02:46:27.555: >> MY NAME IS ANDY, FROM TRIUMPH ENGINEERING, SPEAKG ON HALF OFHE APPLICAN ANN ARBOR SUPERI HOTEL GROU THE PROJECT THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS HOME2 SUITES. IT'S A HILTON PRODUCT, AN ALL SUITES ESTATE HOTEL LOCATED AT THE INTERSECTION OF SIGNATURE BOULEVARD AND EISENHOWER PARKWAY, AND IT IS 115 ROOMS, AND THERE'S 115 PARKI SPACES. AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL, WE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND STAFF AS WELL, AND WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT, MOSTLY DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF WHEN IT IS, THE SHOPPING, DINING, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THE PROPERTY IS ZONED O, HOT IS A PERMITTED USE WITHI THAT DISTRICT, AND IT'S APPROXIMATELY ABOUT 2.56 ACRES IN SIZE. THIS IS NOT A PLANNED PROJECT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THIS PROJECT IS A PERMITTED USE WITHIN THAT DISTRICT, BUT WE THEITIZEN PARTICIPAON ID HAVE MEING WHERE WE INVITED MEMBERS THE SURROUNDING AREA, WE DID SOLICIT THE INPUT. WE DID INCORPORATE THAT AS PART OF OUR PLANS, AND THE PROJECT IN FRONT OF YOU REFLECTS THAT AS WELL. THE PROJECT MEETS THE ORDINANCES FOR PARKING, PIPE, LANDSCAPING. WE EMPHASIZED PROJECT NNECTIVITY AS MULTIPLE POINTS OF CONNECTION FROM THE HOTEL ITSELF TO THE ADJACENT PATHWAYS AND SIDEWALKS. AS I MENTIONED, ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES THAT WE HAVE THERE IS THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. IT'S ROUTE 24 THAT IS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT ALONG EISENHOWER. WE DID WORK WITH STAFF AS WELL ONONMOTORIZED PESTRIAN CROSSINGS THAT WE'LL BE WORKING WITH TRANSPORTATION AND PLANNING FOR THE INSTALLATION FOR -- ACROSS EISENHOWER. I THINK THAT WILL HELP WITH THE EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT ARE THERE, PLUS WHATEVER THAT WE ARE ADDING AS A PART OF THIS PROJECT. WE DID INCORPORATE FEATURES SUCH AS BIO-RENTION, UNDERGROUN DETENTION AS A PART OF THE PROJECT AS WELL, AND THE BUILDING ITSELF, WE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUILDING WORKING WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION DIRECTIVES THAT THEY ASKED FOR CERTAIN FEATURES ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE BUILDING.
02:48:58.038: >> CITY CLERK:  30 SECONDS.
02:48:58.973: >> -- ENTRANCE FEATURES, AS WELL AS UTILIZING DURABLE MATERIALS, SUCH AS BRICK OCK, FIBERND CEMENT. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
02:49:14.188: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:49:22.062: >> CITY CLERK:  MAYOR, I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
02:49:25.366: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IF THERE IS ANY AND L WHO WLD LIK TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING WHO IS ON THE LINE, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE NOW. SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER THREE, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE VALHALLA ANNEXATION, 3.5 ACRES. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:50:06.874: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER 299? CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 299, DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER 299, YOUR PHONE IS STILL MUTED. THERE YOU GO.
02:50:25.726: >> THERE WE GO. SORRY. HI, THIS IS MICHAEL O'KEEFE. I'M FROM WARD FOU HERE ITHE CITY THANK YOU TO MAYOR TAYLOR AND COUNCIL FOR A CHANCE TO COMMENT ON THIS. I KNOW THIS IS JUST AN ANNEXATION RIGHT AT THE MOMENT AND THE ACTUAL CHANGE IN ZONING DESIGNATION WILL BE PICKED UP LATER, BUT I WANT TO KIND OF LODGE MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE ULTIMATE PLANS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT AND HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL CONSIDERS DECLINING IT UNDER THE CURRE PATH THAT IS ON. I'M NOT REALLY ANTIDEVELOPMENT, BECAUSE I SUPPORT MANY DEVELOPMENTS IN MY AREA, AND I CAN APPRECIATE FROM THE CURRENT VALHALLA RESIDENTS' POINT OF VIEW THAT REDEVELOPMENT IS MUCH NEEDED IN THAT AREA, BUT I'M REALLY AGAINST THE R4E DENSITY THIS TS DEVELMENT IS THAT DENSITY I THINK IS WAY TOO HIGH FOR THIS AREA, ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF RIGHT TURNS IN AND RIGHT TURNS OUT TO ACCESS THIS COMPLEX. I THINK THE R4E IS CONTRARY TO THE MASTER PLAN. IF THE MASTE PLAN IS OUT OF DATE, AS MANY HAVE COMMENTED, THEN I WOULD PREFER THAT THEY TAKE THE TIME TO UPDATE IT THROUGH THE NATURAL PROCESS, WHICH INCLUDES PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMENT, AND NOT DO IT IN A HODGEPODGE WAY THAT IS ON A PER DEVELOPMENT BASIS. I WOD PREFER TO HALE MASTE PLAN CHANGES THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS. THANK YOU.
02:52:05.726: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:52:18.405: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER 107, CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 107.
02:52:30.884: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
02:52:33.487: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HI, WE CAN HEAR YOU, ABSOLUTELY.
02:52:36.557: >> MY NAME IS JEAN HOLLANDE, AND I LIVE AT 111 GOLF VIEW LANE. TONIGHT, YOUE GOING TO VOTING TO ANNEX THE TOWNSHIP AREAS OF VALHALLA GLENN TO ANN ARBOR. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I PERSONALLY DO NOT OPPOSE THE ANNEXATION OF THIS PARCEL. I CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND THAT IF IT DOES COME INTO THE CITY, IT'LL BE R1D, WHICH IS FI, AND I SO UNDERSTANDHAT AT A LATER TIME, THE DEVELOPER WILL BE REQUESTING REZONING TO R4E, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE HIGHEST DENSITY PRESENT IN THE AREA SOUTH OF STADIUM. I BELIEVE THAT THE MASTER PLAN SPECIFICALLY TREATSHE AA SOUTH OF STADIUM DIFFERENT FROM NORTH OF STADIUM. HERE'S THE DEFINITION OF R4E. THE R4E MULTIPLE FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT IS INTENDED TO PERMIT HIGH DENSITY MULTIPLE FAMILY DELOPMENTLONG SNATURE TRANSIT CORRIDORS, AS INTIFIED IN THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN WITH NEARBY ACCESS TO PUBLIC LAND, SCHOOLS, SHOPS, AND PERSONAL SERVICES OUTSIDE THE DDA BOUNDARY. THE ELEMENTS OF LAND USE PLANNING AND SE DESIGN SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE IMPACT OF SUCH INTENSITY OF LAND USE ON AN ADJACENT PROPERTY AND ON THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE IS MINIMIZED. I THINK THERE IS A CASE, NOT IN THREE MINUTES, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THERE'S A CASE THAT'S [ OFF MIC ] -PROVIDES AN ARGUMENT NOT TO ALLOW R4E IN THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION. THREE SIDES OF IT ARE ON THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GOLF COURSE, AND THE OTHER SIDE IS ON SOUTH MAIN, WHICH IS GOING TO ONLY ALLOW RIGHT IN AND RIGHT OUT ACCESS TO EGRESS AND INGRESS TO THE PJECT.
02:54:59.533: >> CITY CLERK:  30 SECONDS.
02:55:00.567: >> SO, I REQUEST THAT IF ANNEXATION IS APPROVED AT THE INCOMING INITIAL ZONING TO BE R1D, WITH NO PROMISE OF R4E FOR THE FUTURE, AND NO CONDITION THAT WOULD PAVE THE WAY TO R4 WITHO UNDERLYING MENON OF R4E IN ANY PART OF THE ANNEXATION AGREEMENT. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU.
02:55:26.293: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:55:35.435: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 13 DO YOHAVE A COMME?
02:55:42.876: >> HELLO. THIS IS KEN GARBER. I LIVE AT 28 HAVER HILL COURT. SO TONIGHT, YOU WILL BE VOTING ON THE VALHALLA ANNEXATION, NOT THE SITE PLAN, BUT THE SITE PLAN HAS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN MENTIONED. TE THAT THE PETITIONER HAS AGREED TO FULL PROJECT ELECTRIFICATION, NO NATURAL GAS, NO GAS HERE IT IS OR KITCHEN APPLIANCES, NO GAS CLOTHES DRYERS. FOR HEATING, THE BIGGEST ENERGY BURNER, THE PETITIONER WILL INSTALL A VRF, OR VARIABLE REFRIGERANT FLOW SYSTEM. THIS HAS A CENTRAL AIR SOURCE HEAT PUMP. WHEN YOU EXPRESS A GAS, ITS TEMPERATURE GOES UP. THAT'S THE SIMPLE PRINCIPLE BEHIND A HEAT PUMP. MODERN VRF SYSTEMS WORK ON EVEN THE COLDEST MICHIGAN WINTER DAYS. GOING FORWARD, ALL NEW ANN ARBOR CONSTRUCTION SHOULD EMPLOY HEAT PUMPS, BUT NOT NATURAL GAS. THERE WAS AN ELECTRIFICATION MANDATE IN THE CITY'S 2012 CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. THESE STEMSILL REQRE EXPENSIVE RETROFITTING. I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE HOME2 HOTEL PLAN YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT, BUT WE JUST CAN'T APPROVE ANY MORE MORE HOME2 HOTELS GOING FORWARD IF THEY ARE HEATED BY GAS FURNACES. THE VALHALLA PLAN, WHETHER IMPROVED OR NOT, SETS AN IMPORTANT LOCAL PRECEDENT CAUSET SHOWS THATULL ECTRIFICATIOIS TECHNOLOGICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. MANY DEVELOPERS WHO DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BUT GAS, WHO HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH HEAT PUMPS, WILL CONTINUE PROPOSING GAS HEATED BUILDINGS. MANY CITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, SAN JOSE, BERKELEY, BROOKLINE, HAVE PASSED SUCH LAWS WITH STRONG SPORT FROM THEIR BUILDER COMMUNIES. CONTRARY TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, THERE IS NOTHING IN MICHIGAN LAW THAT CLEARLY PREVENTS CITIES LIKE ANN ARBOR FROM DOING THE SAME. REGARDLESS OF HOW CITY COUNCIL VOTES ON THIS ANNEXATION TONIGHT AND ON THE VALHALLA PROJECT ITSELF AND THE SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENTS, MAY OR MAY NOT JUSTIFY THE DENSITY OR ZONING. I'M NOT WGHG IN ON TH.
02:58:11.958: >> 30 SECONDS.
02:58:13.093: >> STL, BUILDG ELECTRIFICATION H TO BE THE FUTURE, STARTING NOW.
02:58:24.504: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:58:51.832: >> IN MY MIND, THIS IS A TOWNSHIP ISLAND INSIDE TCITY, SHOULD ALS BUILD DENSITY THERE, BECAUSE ON A TRANSIT LINE, IT'S A PERFECT PLACE TO BUILD DENSITY, SO I REALIZE WE ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST ISSUE TODAY, SO I SAY ANNEX AND THEN BUILD IT. THANKS.
02:59:09.983: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 500, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 500?
02:59:31.438: >> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME.
02:59:33.340: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE CAN HEAR YOU, SIR. NOW 500, WE CAN'T HEAR YOU ANYMORE.
02:59:49.689: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
02:59:51.358: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YOU BET WE CAN.
02:59:54.828: >> OKAY. SO, MY NAMIS STEPHANIE SEVARINO, AND I'M A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR. I LIVE AT 117 SOUTH VIEW LANE. OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS DEEPLY DESIGNATIO BOU WE SPORT THE ANNEXATION OF THE VALHALLA -- INTO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. (AUDIO FAINT AND INDISTINCT) -- MASTER PLAN IS DATED IN REGARDS TO THE SOUTH AREA PLAN. EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE, WE CANNOT IMAGINE GRANTING R4E IN AN AREA WITH A, R1B -- R4E IS WAY TOO INTENSE OF A USE FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD -- (QUIET SPEECH POOR AUDIO QUALITY). THE TRAFFIC IMPLICATIONS ARE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING AND UNREALISTIC AT BEST, AND -- AN EXAMPLE OF ZONING OVERREACH. WE'D URGE YOU TO CAREFULLY EXPERIMENT THE R4E EXPERIMENT ON A SITE SURROUNDED BY -- INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE REAL ESTATE'S NATURAL FEATURES -- PROJECTF 100 TO 150UNITS. WE ARE COUNTINGN YOU TO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE ZONING THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AREAS -- THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION.
03:02:03.323: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
03:02:09.996: >> CITY CLERK:  THERERE NO MORE CALLE WITH THEIRANDSP AT THIS TIME.
03:02:14.768: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING WHO HAS NOT YET SPOKEN? IF YOU DO, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE NOW.
03:02:38.758: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER 459, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
03:02:41.327: >> THIS IS MAYA FROM GOLF VIEW LANE. I HAVE BEEN AN ANN ARBOR RESIDENT SINCE 1955. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED VALHALLA GLENN PROJECT OFF MAIN STREE ACROSS ANNRBOR SCIO CHURCH ROAD AND PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL ON STADIUM BOULEVARD AND MAIN STREET. DRIVING NORTH, IT MERGES WITH MAIN STREET AND BORDERS THE U OF M GOLF COURSE. TRAFFIC BECOMES DSE ATHE TURN TO STADIUM MERGES. ON SATURDAYS, IT BECOMES CONGESTED WITH PEDESTRIANS AS WELL AS CARS TRYING TO REACH THEIR DESTINATIONS. THERE IS NO SIDEWALK ON THE U OF M GOLF COURSE ON MAIN STREET, AND IT BECOMES FILLED WITH THOUSANDS. ADDING THE R4E ZONING DESIGNATED FOR MULTIPLE HOUSING ON THE U OF M GOLF COURSE WOULD ADD ANYWHERE FROM 500 TO A THOUSAND PEDESTRIANS AND CARS TO THE MIX. ALLOWING R4E TO THE AREA WOULD INCREASE THE CAR TRAFFIC AND WALKING BEYOND A REASONABLE DENSITY. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS A TRAVESTY FOR REASONABLE DENSITY. THANK YOU.
03:04:26.533: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
03:04:28.768: >> CITY CLERK:  CALLER ENDING 309, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
03:04:31.237: >> HELLO, HELLO?
03:04:32.305: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YEAH, WE CAN HEAR YOU.
03:04:34.474: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
03:04:36.242: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YOU BET.
03:04:37.043: >> I'M SORRY. I WAS TRYING TO COMMENT ON THE EARLIER HEARING, THE STR. IS THAT OKAY? I JUST COULDN'T GET THROUGH. IS THAT OKAY?
03:04:48.354: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SO, WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT YOU SUFFERED TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES? YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO DIAL IN CORRECTLY?
03:04:56.029: >> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS PUSHING ONE OF THE STARS OR THE NUMBERS INCORRECTLY.
03:05:02.235: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HOLD ON FOR A SECOND, PLEASE. TH COUNL'S ACQESCENCE? YES, PLEASE, GO FORWARD.
03:05:12.312: >> OKAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M SORRY.
03:05:13.980: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YOU BET, NO WORRIES. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
03:05:17.483: >> I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE ISSUE FOR THE LAST YEAR. I WENT TO ALL THREE OF THE PUBLIC HEARINGS, AND I HAVE AN OWNER-OCCUPIED SPACE. I'M FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOODN WARD 5, AND I ACALLY BOUGHT MY FIRST HOUSE 23 YEARS AGO, AN 800-SQUARE FOOT HOUSE ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF ANN ARBOR. THEN AS NOW, THE PRICES WERE SO HIGH, AND THE MARKET WAS VERY TIGHT.  I WANT TO POINT THIS OUT TO REMIND YOU THAT THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY SITUATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE I ANNARR,ECAUSE IT'S AIGH DEMAND AREA, AND A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WANT OR NEED TO LIVE HERE, BUT TO DUMP THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE ON A HANDFUL OF STR HOUSES OR COMPLEXES ISN'T RIGHT. IT'S EITHER ILL INFORMED OR -- Rs HELP WIT AFFORDABILIT ERE WHICISROAD TERM, BY OFFERING A RELIABLE WAY FOR BRING IN MONEY FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. I WISH SOME OF YOU WOULD STOP SEEMINGLY DEMONIZE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE RESIDENTS WHO RENT STRs IN DIFFERENT FORMS, BY SAYING THINGS LIKE THOSE WHO ARE OPPORTUNISTIC ENOUGH TO GET IN EARLY,NDORTH,S SRESPECTFUL. I WISH YOU COULD BE MORE OPEN MINDED AND NOT NEGATIVIZE THIS. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RENT OUT A PART OF MY HOUSE AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL, AND IT'S REALLY HELPED ME FINANCIALLY. A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK IT'S COMMON FOR GUESTS TO HAVE WILD PARTIES OR TO CREATE SOME SORT OF A NUISANCE, BUT THIS HAS BEEN OVERBLOWN, AND IT'S NOT TRUE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE GOOD, RESPONSIBLE AND RESPECTFUL PEOPLE. WITH NEW RULES AND REGISTRATION IN ANN ARBOR, AND ALSO, VERY IMPORTANTLY, WITH AIRBNB RECENTLY INSTITUTING A FORMAL BAN ON ALL PARTIES AND EVENTS, THE VERY SMALL NUMBER OF NUISANCE SITUATIONS WILL BE VERY LIKELY GONE OR CONTROLLED. YOU CAN OK UP TEW RULES ON AIRBNB, SINCE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO THAT RIGHT NOW. OUTLAWING THE MAJORITY OF STRs WILL MAKE ANN ARBOR SEEM LESS WELCOMING TO VISIT. THE MAJORITY OF OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE IN MY SPACE ARE RELATED TO THE UNIVERSITY, FAMILIES DROPPING KIDS OFF AT U OF M, FAMILIES HERE TO VISIT THE UNIVERSITY AND ANN ARBOR TO CONSIDER GOI TSCHO, AND DICAL RESIDTS MOVING IN- OKAY I WANTED TO SAY THAT I THINK COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S COMMENT, HOW DID WE GET HERE, IS IMPORTANT. TO GO FROM ASKING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN MEETINGS TO JUST THE CITY STAFF DECIDING HOW THEY WANT TO DO THIS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, I FELT, WAS JUST NOT RIGHT. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO THE WOMAN WHO STARTED THE WEBSITE BAN AIRBNB A2 AND LOBBIED THE CITY STAFF AGGRESSIVELY, I FEEL LIKE SHE WAS MANIPULATIVE AND HAD OTHER MOTIVES AT GETTING BACK AT HER NEIGHBOR WHO WAS TAKING ISSUE WITH HER.
03:08:20.600: >> CITY CLERK:  TIME. THANK YOU. CONFRTED HIM. MAYOR TAYLOR:THANK YOU.
03:08:26.139: >> THANK YOU.
03:08:31.511: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER THREE?
03:08:38.551: >> CITY CLERK:  MAYOR, THERE'S NO OTHER CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
03:08:41.888: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. MAY HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO APPROVE THE MINUTES THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US FROM THE SPECIAL SESSION ON AUGUST 10TH AND THE REGULAR MEETING ON AUGUST 5TH. DISCUSSION OF THE MINUTES? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSE THE MINUTES ARE APPROVED. B1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND TITLE V VII, BUSINESS AND TRADES OF THE CODE OF CITY OF ANN ARBOR BY ADDING A NEW CHAPTER WHICH SHALL BE DISOITED DESIGNATED AS CHAPTER 97 SHORT-TERM RENTALS, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY -- DISCUSSION, PLEASE. FOR MY PART, I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A LEAD. WE HAVE, OBVIOUSLY, BEEN TALKING ABOUT SHORT-TERM RENTALS FOR A LONG TIME ANDAVE HEARD FROM FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS, I THINK MORE OF LATE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY RESIDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL ECONOMY, LARGELY AS OWNERS, SOME AS SERVICE PROVIDERS. IN MY VIEW, BASED UPON WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND WHAT I HAVE READ, I THINK THE PROPER THING TO DO IS TO TAKE THE -- ESSENTIALLY TAKE THE LEAD OF WHAT WE DID WITH RESPECT TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA, WHICH WAS ALSO A BUSINESS THAT WE HAD IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WAS SOMEWHAT ON THE FRONT FOOT. I THINK THE PROPER THING TO DO THERE WOULD BE TO RETHINK WHAT I HE TAB WHAT WE HAVE BORETEXT, US TOD AND COME BA WITH SOME KIND OF REGIME THAT PROPERLY REGULATES THESE GROUPS, PUTS SOME KIND OF LIMIT HONORING WHO HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE BUT THEN ALSO, YOU KNOW, KEEPS TRACK OF -- KEEPS TRACK OF OWNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE, YOU KNOW, THE DISRUPTION ANALYSIS, DISRUPTION RESPONSE DONE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THAT'S WHERE I HOPE THIS CONVERSATION GOES. I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT AND THE FAIR THING TO DO. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
03:11:15.374: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  I TAYLOR. REWITH Y, MAYOR I WOULD GO A LITTLE BIT FARTHER AND SAY THAT TO COME BACK, AND I WOULD CERTAINLY PROPOSE TABLING THIS ITEM, BUT WHAT I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD COME BACK WITH IS SIMPLY LET'S CAP THE NUMBER AND CREATEHE LICENSINGND REGIRATION PROCESS. I THINK WHAT I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPROACH THAT WE ARE TAKING NOW IS, YOU KNOW, EVEN IF WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE GRANDFATHER THESE IN, THAT IS AWARDING A GREAT REWARD TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE HERE NOW. IT IS, U KN, GIVINHEM QUE A BIT OF AONOPOLY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT DOESN'T ALLOW ANY CHANGES OR FOR THESE UNITS TO MOVE AROUND THE CITY. I JUST THINK IF WE KEEP IT A LITTLE BIT MORE SIMPLE, IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER, FAIRER ORDINANCE FOR EVERYBODY THAT WILL DO WHAT WE HOPE IT DOES. SO, I THINK TO ME, IT'S A LOGICAL WAY TO GO. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO. I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT EVERYBODY HAS TO SAY BEFORE I PROPOSE TABLING THIS WITH THAT INSTRUCTION.
03:12:39.358: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:12:40.292: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I'M NOT -- I WON'T BE SUPPORTING TABLING THIS. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR COUNCIL TO TAKE ACTION ON IT. WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR WELL OVER A AREA -- WELL OVER A YEAR, AND I FIND IT, YOU KNOW, THAT THERE'S -- THERE'S NOTHING PERFECT IN GOVERNMENT. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLEF IMPERFTION, BUT I LIEVE WHAT WE END UP DOING WITH THE ALTERNATIVE IDEAS OF GRANDFATHERING, CREATE MORE PROBLEMS THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THERE HAS BEEN A COMPARISON NOW TO THE MARIJUANA -- MEDICAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY AND HOW THAT NUMB WAS AIVED TO AND HOW THAT WAS CAPPED, AND THAT BE A MODEL IN THIS SITUATION, AND I WAS NOT ON COUNCIL BACK THEN, AND IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING WITH STAFF THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED WITH SHORT-TERM RENTALS COMPARISON WITH MARIJUANA REGULATIONS AND HOW WE ARRIVED AT THE NUMBER 28 WITH THAT ISSUE. SO, IF MR. DELACOURT IS AVAILABLE, I WOULD JUST LIKE AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENCES IN HOW THAT WAS DONE VERSUS THE PROPOSED CAPPING WH SHORT-TERM RENTALS, AND WHETHER THERE IS A PARALLEL PATH AND A FAIR COMPARISON THAT IS BEING MADE, BECAUSE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THESE ARE NOT APPLES TO APPLES.
03:14:37.209: >> WELL --
03:14:37.476: >> I WAS GOING TO SAY, I THINK I HEARD HALF OF THE QUESTION. WE JUMPED IN IN THE MIDDLE. I'M GOING TO TAKE A STAB, MARIJUANA VERSUS SHORT-TERM RENTALS?
03:14:46.919: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES, EXACTLY.
03:14:48.254: >> OKAY. AND THEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MARIJUANA, MARIJUANA WE HAD A SITUATION, AND I'LL ASK BRETT TO JUMP IN AND CLARIFY IF I SAY ANYTHING OUT OF TURN, WHERE YOU HAD USES THAT WERE IN THE ZONING DISTRICT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN, FROM THE BEGINNING. THE ISSUE WAS CAPPING. THERE WAS A CAP ON THE LICENSING ORDINANCE AND THEN A SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE TO ALLOW SOME DISCRETIONARY REVIEW OF THEM STAFF AND EVERYBODY AGREED WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE FACILITIES.
03:15:21.654: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  IF I MAY INTERRUPT REAL QUICK?
03:15:24.223: >> I WAS GOING TO SAY THE DIFFERENCE FOR US, IN THE INSTANCE WITH SHORT-TERM, WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT RENTALS OF LESS THAN 30 DAYS, WHERE YOU DON'T CREATE A RESIDENT IN THAT FACILITY, IN THAT HO, IN THAT RUCTURE, IIS NOT AN APPROPRIATE USE FOR A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT. SO WE DO SEE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT COMPARISON.
03:15:50.683: >> I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING, BUT WHEN IT CAME TO MARIJUANA, WHEN IT CAME TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA, THAT USE WAS EXPLICITLY IDENTIFD IN THE ZONINGRIOR TO THE BEING LICENSED AND BEING IN OPERATION; IS THAT CORRECT? THEY WERE IDENTIFIED, WE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE, AND WE HAD PERMITTED THEM IN CERTAIN AREAS TO OPERATE, CORRECT?
03:16:11.871: >> CORRECT.
03:16:14.340: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A FAIR COMPARISON TO USE THE PRESCRIPTIONE DID WITH MEDAL MARIANA AS NOW BEING SUGGESTED WITH THIS, BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT EXPLICITLY ALLOWED SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN THESE ZONING DISTRICTS IN ANN ARBOR, AND NOW WE ARE CHALLENGED WITH THE QUESTION TONIGHT AND BEFORE. SO, I APPRECIATE SHEDDINGOME LIGHT ON THAT, AND I'LL SAVE SOME TIME FOR MY COLLEAGUES AT THIS POINT.
03:16:53.479: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:16:54.346: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING TO THIS COMPARISON THAT'S BEEN MADE TO WHAT WE DID WITH P-EXISTING MEDAL MARIANA FACILITI, AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. IT'S NOT AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON, BECAUSE WE -- THOSE FACILITIES HAD BEEN APPROVED SPECIFICALLY. THEYERE OTHE TY'S DAR, WENEW WHERE TY WERE LOCATED, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, ALL OF THOSE POINTS THAT YOU AND STAFF JUST MADE. SO IT'S NOT A REASONABLE COMPARISON. I DO THINK THAT I COULD VOTE ON THIS TONIGHT. I THINK THAT THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF GRANDFATHERING AND LAWSUITS, ET CETERA, THAT THAT'S CUDED THE BIC POINT TT THE CITY DOES NEEA REGULATORY AND OPERATING FRAMEWORK FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS. GRANDFATHERING IS A SEPARATE ISSUE, AND I BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS IN TERMS OF THE EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTALS, THE CITY NEEDS AN ORDINANCE. WE NEED A LICENSING AND REGISTRATION PROCESS, WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE TODA MANY OF THE CAERS REFERREDO, YOU OW, THAT THEY ARE APPROVED UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM/PROCESS, WHATEVER. WE DON'T HAVE THAT TODAY. AND WE NEED TO ESTABLISH REGULATIONS FOR GOING FORWARD. I ALSO THINK THE CITY NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING STOCK. REQUIRING ALL SHORT-TERM RENTALS TO GET REGISTERED AND LICENSED IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE CITY THE INFORMATION THAT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTIVITY AND TO REGULATE AND ENFORCE IT. I COULD VOTE ON THIS TONIGHT. I KNOW, AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY, THE GRANDFATHERING AND WHETHER WE GRANDFATHER OR NOT, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT -- I ALSO THINK THAT IF THIS IS POSTPONED THAT THERE ARE CHANGES TO THE UDC AND THE ZONING ORDINANCES TT MAKE SO THAT WE ADDRESS ANY POSSIBLE LOOPHOLES AND CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES THAT MIGHT MAKE THE CASE FOR FUTURE SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN RESIDENTIALLY ZONED DISTRICTS. THE BOTTOM LINE, WE DO NEED A FRAMEWORKPROSPECTIVELY, REGARDLESS OF HOW THE GRANDFATHER --
03:19:49.655: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU MOVED TO MUTE. DID YOU INTEND TO? ARE YOU COMPLETED?
03:19:55.527: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY, YEAH, I'M FINISHED, EXCEPT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE PLANNINSTAFF D THE ATTORY'S OFFICE FOR THEIR WORK IN DEVELOPING THE ORDINANCE AND ANSWERING THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS. SO, THANK YOU. I'M DONE.
03:20:14.746: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:20:16.448: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THE ONLY PART OF THIS THAT I LIKE IS THE NOTION OF LENSING D REGISRING THESE OPERATIO. IS A PART OF THE MIX OF AL RESIDENTIAL TYPES THAT CONTEMPORARY CITIES HAVE. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING AWAY. I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE THEM GO AWAY. I AM NOT -- I KNOW THEY MUST EXIST, BUT ANYBODY WHO I KNOW WHO IS A NONOWNER OCCUPIED AND THESE ARE MY NEIGHBORS, THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY -- YOU KNOW, THEY NEED THE EXTRA INCOME, OR THEY HAD A LONG-TERM RENTAL THAT WOULD GET DESTROYED WITH RELATIVELY LONG-TERM TENANTS, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET IN THERE EXCEPT FOR EVERY YEAR OR TWO YEARS. THERE ARE A LOT OF BENEFITS TO THEM, OUTSIDE OF THE FINANCI BENEFITS, OF SWITCNG TO THE STR MODEL, AND THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE ALLOW THESE TO EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY, BUT I THINK THAT LICENSING AND REGISTRATION WILL GIVE US THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE OF THIS, ESPECIALLY IF THIS LICENSING AND REGISTRATION HAS AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WI IT THAT IS REASONLE SO WE CAN REALL UNDETAND WT'S GOING ON HERE. I'M NOT BUYING THAT THIS PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN OUR AFFORDABILITY ISSUES HERE IN THE CITY, AND WE HAVE SEEN -- THERE CLEARLY IS A NEED FOR SHORT-TERM STAY, AS WE HAVE -- WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF APPROVING OUR SECOND HOTEL COMPLEX IN AS MANY WEEKS. SO I WOULD SUPRT KICKING THIS DOWN THE ROAD TO COM BACK WITH A LICENSING AND REGISTRATION MECHANISM ONLY IN PLACE. THAT'S THE PART OF THIS THAT I THINK IS THE MOST VALUABLE TO US AS A CITY. SO I DON'T SUPPORT THIS AS IT STANDS, BUT I WOULD SUPPORT SENDING IT BACK FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. I'M NOT REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE LAWSUITS OR ANY OF THAT. I NEVER REALLY HAVE BEEN. IT'S A PART  THE BUSINESS OF D EATING LESLATION, AND I THINK IT'S NECESSARY AT TIMES TO DEFEND THE TYPE OF COMMUNITY THAT WE WANT TO HAVE. I THINK SOMETIMES WE DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN DEFENDING OUR LAWSUITS, SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT AT ALL. I'M WORRIED MORE ABOUT FINDING OUT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING HERE WITH THE STRs, AND I THINK LICENSING AND REGISTERI THEM IS GOING TO GI US THAT ANER, AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO GIVE US TH PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THE HEALTH, SAFETY, AND WELFARE OF EVEN TEMPORARY RESIDENTS SO WE MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE GIVEN THE TYPES OF INSPECTIONS THAT THEY NEED. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME ALSO. THANK YOU.
03:22:50.869: >> MR. DELACOURT?
03:22:53.739: >> YEAH, JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE OF COMPLIANCE FOR ALL RENTALS, SHORT-TERM OR NOT. IF WE WANT TO TRACK WHETHER IT'S SHORT-TERM OR NOT, WE CAN JUST ADD SOMETHING TO THE APPLICATION THAT THEY ARE GOING TO USE IT AS A SHORT-TERM. IF THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A PROHIBITION ON THEM, WE ALREADY LICENSE -- NOT A LICENSE -- A CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE, AND THEY ARE ALLEGISTERED WH THE THEM, AS LG AS THEY ARE NOT AN OWNER-OCCUPIED STRUCTURE, WHICH WE DON'T DO THAT FOR LONG-TERM RENTALS EITHER. I GUESS THAT'S THE CASE WITH SHORT AND LONG-TERM.
03:23:39.217: >> GHT. THERE'S N ADDITIONAL REGULATION NEEDED FOR THAT. IT'S THE SAME ISSUE WE ALWAYS DEAL WITH, AND THAT'S TRACKING THOSE WHO DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE INSPECTION PROCESS. BUT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL REGULATION OR REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR THAT.
03:23:53.465: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:23:57.803: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU. TONIGHT I HAVE HEARD A COUE OF PEOPLE USE THE PHRE "EXTRA INCOME," AND I THINK IT'S WORTH CLARIFYING, AGAIN, THAT THE MAIN IMPACT OF THIS ORDINANCE IS NOT ON PEOPLE WHO ARE USING A HOUSE THAT IS THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE FOR EXTRA INCOME AND AIRBNB'ING A HOU THAT THE ACTUALLY LE IN. TH CRUX OF THIS IS IS LITERALLY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO OWN AN EXTRA HOUSE OR MORE THAN AN EXTRA HOUSE. SO, I GUESS I'M JUST -- I'M REALLY STRUGGLING -- WELL, HOW DID WE GET HERE? BECAUSE I FELT LIKE THIS WAS A PRETTY STRAITFORWARD TALKING ABT IT. FIRST SRTED I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. DELACOURT. THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT REGISTERING SHORT-TERM RENTALS OR COMING UP WITH A CAP OR A NUMBER, IS THAT REALLY A SIMPLE SOLUTION? BECAUSE IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU AND I HAVE HAD ON THIS TOPIC, MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT DEFINING WHAT THIS ACTIVITY IS, A COERCIAL ACTIVY, WAS -- MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION. HOW COMPLICATED WOULD THIS BE? WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF A PROCESS OF REGISTERING THEM AND ARRIVING AT A NUMBER THAT -- I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR TAKE ON THIS. THIS POINT, NO REAL THOUGHT INTO A CAP, OTHER THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF, FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM -- AND I DON'T LIKE TO USE THIS TERM, BUT GRANDFATHERING IN EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTALS THROUGH SOME DEMONSTRATION, EITHER OF PRIOUS LEASES OR SOME COMBINATION OF EVIDENCE, I GUESS, THAT THEY HAVE RENTED THEIR FACILITIES FOR LESS THAN 30 DAYS PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE, TO ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN IN GOOD STANDING, IF THERE WAS AN ORDINANCE THAT REGULATED THAT BEHAVIOR GOING FORWARD. WHETHER THAT WOULD BE DONE THROUGH A NONCONFORMING SET OF REGULATIONS IN THEONING DINANCE OROME OTHER TOOL IF COUNCIL DECIDED TO DO THAT, THAT IS SIMPLER, IN MY MIND, THAN DETERMINING A CAP. THAT WOULD BE MORE OF A POLICY DECISION, SIMILAR TO THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA ISSUE -- THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA CONVERTING TO RECREATIONAL OR THE MARIJUANA ISSUE IN GENERAL OF BY WHAT DEFINITI DO WE WANT TO CAP THESE. IS IT ON A PER NEIGHBORHOOD BASIS? IS IT A PER ZONING DISTRICT? THAT WOULD TAKE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFORT THAN JUST COMING UP WITH THE CRITERIA TO CREATE A LIST OF FACILITIES OR PROPERTIES THAT WERE DOING THIS PREVIOUSLY TO THE ADOPTION OF NEW REGULATION, AND THAT WERE GOING FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS, AND I HOPE AT THIS POINT I HAVE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION.
03:27:05.790: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I APPRECIATE THAT, MR. DELACOURT. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M READY TO VOTE ON THIS TONIGHT. I KNOW FROM MY EXPERIENCE, VISITI MORE TOURISM-NTERED COMMUNITIES AND USING AIRBNB AND THOSE COMMUNITIES, BUT THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE MOST VALUABLE AS SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE MOST CONVENIENTLY LOCATED TO THE CENTER OF OUR TOWN, AND ALL OF THE AMENITIES IN THE CENTER OF OUR TOWN, AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY WHO IS A SHORT-TERM LONG-TERM RENTER O ISIMY O IS A JUST LONG-RM RESIDENT, A YEAR-ROUND RESIDENT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF SOMEBODY WHO, EVERY DAY, IS WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITY AND MAYBE CAN WALK TO WORK OR EVERY DAY IS GOING TO SCHOOL IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY ARE LIVING, THEY CAN WALK TO SCHOOL. SO, I AM -- I AM READY TO VOTE ON THIS. I AM CONFUSED ABOUT THE RELUCTANCE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD AROUND THE ADVANTAGES OF CENTRALLY LOCATED RESIDENTIAL PEOPLE HAVING ACCESS TO THE AMENITIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY WHO IS ABLE TO LIVE HERE, TO WORK AND STUDY, AND SOMEBODY WHO IS ABLE TO VISIT HERE. THAT THE VALUES THATE ARE LANCING, AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANN ARBOR, AS A COMMUNITY, IS PRIMARILY A TOURISM DESTINATION. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE A COMMUNITY OF RESIDENTS, AND THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE VISIT OUR COMMUNITY. WE WELCOME VISITORS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT EVENTS, BUT PMARILY ARE AOB CENTER IN THIS REGION, AND WE ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING ISSUES, ABOUT THE HOUSING THAT IS HERE FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE HERE. THANKS.
03:28:56.301: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:28:57.469: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO OPPOSE TABLING OR POSTPONING THIS MATTER TONIGHT. I'M READY TO VOTE ON THIS AS WELL. I THOUGHT THAT THE PUBLIC SPEAKE RALPH McKEE, MADE PERFECT SENSE WHEN HE POINTED OUT THAT DELAYING CONSIDERATION OF THIS ORDINANCE OR ADOPTION OF THIS ORDINANCE REALLY OPENS UP THE DOOR TO ADDING TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OPERATING SHORT-TERM RENTALS, JUST TO GET IN THEOOR AND TO BE GRANDFATHERED. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IF IN FACT OUR GOAL IS TO REGULATE THIS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. SIMILARLY, IF WE DELAY THIS TO GRANDFATHER, WHAT WE ARE DOING GROUP OF 100 HOMES WHO GET A BENEFIT AND KIND OF A MONOPOLY TO OPERATE A FULL-TIME SHORT-TERM RENTAL IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I THINK THAT EITHER OF THOSE ACTUALLY OPENS US UP TO LEGAL ACTION FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. WOULD PREFERHAT WE TAKE THE COURSE THAT MR. McKEE SUGGESTED, WHICH IS TO ADOPT THIS AND THEN TO, BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN IT GOES INTO EFFECT, CONSIDER THE ISSUES OF SETTING A NUMERICAL CEILING OR GRANDFATHERING IN EXISTING PROBLEMS. OPTION OF THESE REGULATIONS WILL SIMPLY CAUSE FURTHER COMPLICATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO FORESEE. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE NOT THE FIRST CITY TO REGULATE OR BAN SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THIS IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AS COMMUNITIES WRESTLE WITH THEROWTH IN SHO-TERM REALS AND THE USE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES AS BASICALLY HOTELS, AND IT WILL, ON OUROUSING RKET.  AN IMPAC WHETHER THESE 100 UNITS WILL OR NOT, IN THE LONG-TERM, THERE'S A TREND LINE. WE ARE GOING FROM ZERO TO UPWARDS, CONSISTENTLY UPWARDS, AND IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION SOON, IT'S REALLY GOING TO GET OUT OF HAND AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR HOUSING MARKET. SO I'M GOING TO OPPOSE TABLING OR POSTPONING IT TONIGHT. I WOULALSOUPPORT ADOPTING THE ORDINCE TONIGHT AND TINKING WITH THE DETAILS THEREAFTER.
03:31:53.812: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:31:55.146: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WAS GOING TO ASK MR. DELACOURT A COUPLE OQUESTIONS FLOWING UP ON RESNSES TO QUESTIONS F THIS ENING'S AGENDTHAT UNCILMEMBER LSON DELVED INTO, BECAUSE I THINK THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION ABOUT -- THIS HAS TO MR. DELACOURT. I DON'T KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MIXED MESSAGES, FRANKLY, ABOUT THE -- WHETHER  NOT WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING, MONITORING, THE SHORT-TERM OWNER-OCCUPIED -- NUMBER OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE AND IN OPERATION, AND, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I LOOKED AT YOUR RESPONSES TO AND THEN FORHIS ETING, AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR SPEAKING TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T YET DETERMINED THE METHODS CORRECT TO -- THE METHODS TO CONFIRM THAT THE USE, THE SHORT-TERM RENTALSE W IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TOHISORDINANCE, IFE ADOPT IT TONIGHT, AND THAT THAT IS -- THAT WILL YET BE DETERMINED, AND YOU HAVE VARIOUS -- AS YOU -- THAT IS CORRECT, RIGHT? I JUST WANT --
03:33:21.132: >> YEAH, AND I CAN ASK BRETT TO JUMP IN, BUT SOME COMBINATION OF THIS THING IS TO PRODU A VERIFIABLE LEASE THAT IS PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE, THROUGH SOME MECHANISM THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THAT LEASE OR THAT UTILIZATION WAS FOR SHORTER THAN 30 DAYS. IF WE CAN VERIFY THAT, THAT'S WHERE TO START. SHORT OF THAT, I IMAGINE THERE'S SOME COMBINATION, AND BRETT KEEPS MOVING AROUND ON MY SCREEN RE. IEEP LOOKINGT HIM TOD, BU I THINK THERE WERE A COUPLE OF OTHER IDEAS WE TALKED TO. SOME SHORT-TERM RENTAL OPERATORS HAD GOOD ADVICE FOR US TOO. IF WE DO GO THAT ROUTE, IF COUNCIL WANTS TO CREATE A, QUOTE, "NONCONFORMANCE" TYPE SITUATION THROUGH SOME MECHANISM, THERE'S DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT, IN DITION TT WEOULD USE TO  THE VEFICATION.
03:34:15.086: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  AND IF COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND SPEAKER -- MR. McKEE NOTED, YOU KNOW, WE CAN ADDRESS THIS GRANDFATHERING QUESTION AFTER WE APPROVE THE ORDINANCE. I WOULD ALSO ASK IF -- WELCOME STAFF'S ADVICE AND THOUGHTS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF TEMPORARILY GRANDFATHERING, YOU KNOW, AS OPPOSED TO GRANDFATHERING IN PERPETUITY. I MEAN, THERE ARE ISSUES I AM LIKELY NOT AWARE OF, AND SO IF THAT'S -- IF THAT WORK IS ADDRESSED, AGAIN, SHOULD WE VOTE ON THIS TONIGHT, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT MR. DELACOURT, MR. McDONALD, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE LOOKED AT AND THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE ADVICE ON GOING FORWARD. OR IF OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR.
03:35:28.226: >> I THINK WE HAVE LOST --
03:35:30.294: >> THAT'S A QUESTION --
03:35:31.095: >> YEAH, NO PROBLEM. I'LL JUMP IN. IT LOOKS LIKE DEREK MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN DISCONNECTED. BUT WE HAV'T SPENT AS SIGNIFANT OF TIME, AS MR. DELACOURT INDICATED, THINKING ABOUT VARIOUS WAYS TO ESTABLISH THAT OR THINKING ABOUT A FINITE TIME FRAME. IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO REFINING OR THE COMINGWEEKS.
03:36:00.658: >> COUNCILMEMB LUMM:  OKAY THANK U.
03:36:07.565: >> THANK YOU. SO I STILL WOULD COME BACK TO -- WHICH IS WHY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT TABLING AND NOT VOTING ON THE ORDINANCE THIS EVENING, HOW WE GOT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE, WHICH WAS THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT LACK OF REGULATION O Rs, NOT KNOWI WHERE EY WERE, NOT HAVING MEONE TO REACH IF THERE'S A PROBLEM, AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT SOMETIMES YOU APPROACH ONE QUESTION, AND THEN OTHER CONCERNS ARISE, AND YOU MIGHT GET TO A DIFFERENT ANSWER. I ALSO APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE STILL TEND TO LAND ON WHERE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH IS, THAT I DON'T WANT TO REWARD THOSE WHO NECESSARILY GOT IN THROUGH A MONOPOLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE JUST UNLIMITED GROWTH OF STRs, BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A -- AND IT'SPPROPRIATE FOR COUIL TO THAT, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES. I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING, BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PROCESS, AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE SIMILARITIES, EVEN IF IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME, THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH A NUMBER, AS A COMMUNITY, THAT DOESN' GIVE AONOPOLY TO THOSE WHO ARE IN EXISTENCE, TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE STRs THAT ARE OPERATING ARE OPERATING, YOU KNOW, EFFECTIVELY, AND NOT CAUSING PROBLEMS, SO THAT WE DON'T REWARD THOSE THAT ARE THE BAD APPLES THAT ARE IN THE BUNCH. I THINK THERE'S A WAY FORWARD WITH THIS THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME EXTRA WORK BUT THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO FIND A REASONABLE PLACE THAT ALLOWS THESE TO EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT NOT OVERTAKE OUR COMMUNITY. SO, I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE TABLING.
03:38:12.456: >>AYOR TAYLOR: COUNCILMEMB RAMLAW
03:38:13.357: >> COUILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APOLOGIZE, IS THIS ON THE MAIN MOTION OR IS THIS ON THE AMENDMENT TO POSTPONE?
03:38:20.431: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THERE HAS BEEN NO AMENDMENT OR --
03:38:23.234: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  SO THIS IS STILL ON THE MAIN MOTION MOTION?
03:38:30.775: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  CORRECT. COUNCILMEMBERAMLAWI:  I THINK WE GOT HERE THROUGH A COLLECTIVE DISCUSSION. IT WASN'T JUST ONE ISSUE OR ONE COUNCILMEMBER OR JUST ONE RESIDENT. I THINK WE ALL KNOW BY NOW, ONE RESIDENT CAN'T TAKE AN ISSUE HERE AND BRING IT BY THEMSELVES ALONE. IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE VOICE. IT TAKES MANY ICES, D IT TAKES MY COUNCMEMBERS AS LL. FO ME IAN JUST SPEAK FOR MYSELF. FOR ME, IT CAME DOWN TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT WAS THE ISSUE THAT REALLY STUCK OUT TO ME AS WHY THIS NEEDED TO BE LOOKED AT. AS WE HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL, I HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL NOW I KEEP SAYING TWO YEARS. HAVE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMES UP. EVEN TONIGHT, WE JUST APPROVED, YOU KNOW, AN AGREEMENT, 1140 BROADWAY, WHERE WE ARE PUT PUTTING -- WE ARE DEFERRING OVER $5 MILLION IN TAX REVENUE FOR 15 UNITS. THAT'S HOW EXPENSIVE HOUSING HAS, IS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS WHERE WE ARE PUTTING A MILLAGE QUESTION TO THE VOTERS, THIS NOVEMBER, FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE HAVE PUT UP PUBLIC LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE HAVE HAD VERY CONTROVERSIAL VOTES HERE WITH SP ZONING AND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO, MANY OF OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND WHEN SOMEBODY CAN OUTBID YOU FOR THAT HOUSE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO RAISE A FAMILY IN, BECAUSE THEY HAVE ONE MORE DOLLAR THAN YOU TO SPARE ON IT, SO THAT THEY CAN THEN TURN IT INTO AN INVESTMENT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN LOOK THE OTHER WAY AND SAY IT'S NOT HAVING AN IMPACT ON HOUSING PRICES, AND YOU DON'T HAVE BIDDING WARS, YOU KNOW, IT EXISTS. IT DOESN'TXISTN THIS COMMUNITY ASAD AS IT EXISTS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES, AND NOT JUST IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. BARCELONA IS A CASE STUDY FOR THIS TYPE OF INDUSTRY AND WHAT IT'S DONE TO THAT CITY. GIVE IT TIME, AND WE'LL BE THERE. AND, YOU KW, A BUNCH OOTHER ISSUES WEREROUGHT UP ITHE COURSE OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE HEARD, BUT -- AND AS WE GOT THROUGH THIS, STAFF IS THE ONE WHO RECOMMENDED THIS, BASED ON THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE ZONING, SO, FOR FOL THAT SUGGES THATE SHOULD LISTENO STAFF RE, MANY OF THOSE SAME FOLKS ARE GOING AGAINST STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION HERE, AND SO IT'S -- IT'S JUST -- THERE IS A 180 GOING ON HERE WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND PHISOPHIES AT AREN'T CONSTENTITH POLICY. IT'S JUST FRANKLY INCONSISTENT, IN MY OPINION, AND I BELIEVE THAT GRANDFATHERING IN EXISTING PROPERTIES WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE. AND, FRANKLY, I THINK THIS IS COMMUNITIE RY F LOT O IT'S A N TERRIRY FOR A L OF PPLE IN GOVERENT, AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS WITHOUT BEING IRRESPONSIBLE, BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IF THE OWNERS OF THESE INVESTMENTS WANTED TO CHALLENGE IN COURT, THEN I THINK EXIST.  THAT' WHY THO SYSTE LET' HAVE THOSE ARGUMENTS, YOU KNOW, LAID OUTND UNDERSTOOD IN COURT. I INK THAT WOULD BE A, FOR ME, A BETTER END RESULT THAN TRYING TO CONFIGURE GRANDFATHERING THIS IN WITH SOME ARBITRARY NUMBERS THAT WE ARE GOING TO PULL OUT O THE AIR BASED O WHO KNOWSWHAT. IT'S NOT BASED ON SCIENCE.
03:43:11.555: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
03:43:12.590: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  NUMBER ONE, WE SHOULD PROBABLY VOTE ON THIS PRETTY SOON. I THINK WE HAVE TALKED THIS ONE TO DEATH. I JUST WAN TO RESND TO SOMETHINMY COLLEAGUE SAID, I I AM PROFESSIONA URBAN PLANNER. I'M CERTIFIED BY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PLANNERS. WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS. BRETT AND OTHERS KNOW THAT I DISAGREE WITH THEM. I THINK THAT THERE'S AN EASI, FAIRER WAY TO DO THIS. IT'S OKAY TO HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. I JUST HAPPEN TO THINK THAT LOOKING AT A CITY-WIDE HOW MANY DO WE WANT, LET'S PUT A NUMBER ON IT, TRACK IT, WE CAN ALWAYS GO BACK AND CHANGE THINGS, IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO PROHIBIT THEM. YOU KNOW, I THINK TO ALL O THAT HER GARBAGE, IS JUST GARBAGE. LET'S JUST GO AHEAD. I'M GOING TO CALL THE QUESTION. LET'S VOTE ON THIS.
03:44:14.652: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  CALLING A QUESTION TAKES A SUPER MAJORITY OF SUPPORT.
03:44:22.092: >> CNCILMEMBER STH:  WELL, LET'SOTE ON IT.
03:44:27.331: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ANYBODY ELSE WISH TO -- I GUESS THE QUESTION HAS BEEN CALLED. WE HAVE A PARTICULAR RULE WITH RESPECT TO CALLING THE QUESTION, AS I RECOLLECT.
03:44:36.907: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  WE DO.
03:44:40.945: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IF SOMEONE HASN'T SPOKEN, THEY ARE ALLOWED TOSPOK IF WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR 45 MINUTES TOO, IF I RECOLLECT, THAT'S A REQUIREMENT. HAVE WE BEEN AT THIS FOR 45 MINUTES?
03:44:56.994: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IS IT 45?
03:45:00.431: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR AN HOUR.
03:45:03.000: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.

03:45:08.038: >> MAY TAYLOR:  IS BEEN PRETTY CSE TO 45. WELL, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR. I GUESS IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT YET SPOKEN ON THIS, AND THAT'S I GATHER GRISWOLD AND ACKERMAN.

03:45:20.050: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  AND BANNISTER, THANK YOU, BUT ALSO --HE EXACT LE IS ON THE QUESTIONS BEING CALLED? DOES ANYONE HAVE IT?
03:45:33.998: >> IT TAKES EITHER EIGHT OR NINE VOTES. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, YOU ARE CERTAINLY AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK IF YOU HAVEN'T, SO DO YOU WANT TO JUST GO?
03:46:01.825: >> SIR, THIS IS RULE 10 OF THE COUNCIL RULES.

03:46:33.624: >> BUT IT ES SAY THE MOTION -- IT DOES END WITH THE MOTION TO CALL THE PREVIOUS QUESTION SHALL REQUIRE A CONCURRING VOTE OF THREE QUARTERS OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT.
03:46:45.903: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S, I GUESS, VOTE ON THAT AND THEN GIVE THE REMAINING PEOPLE TIME TO -- SO I GATHER THE PROCESS ON THAT, WE'LL HAVE A VOTE, AND IF THEOTE PASSES, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT YET SPOKEN WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK -- AND MY ZOOM JUST WENT OUT.
03:47:05.823: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: YOU'RE STILL HERE FOR US.

03:48:10.521: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, YOU HAVE THE QUEUE.
03:48:15.058: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  SO SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE THAT WE ARE GOING TO VOTING ON THIS MEASURE TONIGHT, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I READ SOME COMMENTS THAT I PREPAREDNONTEMPLATI OF THAT I DO HEAR THE PAIN OF ENTREPRENEURS WHO HAVE TAKEN A RISK ON THIS ENDEAVOR, AND DO LEGITIMATELY STAND TO LOSE A GREAT DEAL OF OPPORTUNITY AND PERHAPS REAL SUNK COSTS TOO. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF SHORT-TERM RENTAL ANDHE BENETS THAT THEY VE FOR PEOPLE VISITINOUR COMMUNIT, BUT I DO PHILOSOPHICALLY BELIEVE AS REPRESENTATIVES WE DO HAVE WAYS TO ADDRESS LONG-TERM IMPACTS AND NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OF ANY POLICIES AT WE REVIE ANDOTE ON. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAS INCREASED ITS ENROLLMENT BY 9,000 STUDENTS. ON TOP OF THAT, 13,000 NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN TOWN. IN THOSE SAME 20 YEARS, ONLY ABOUT 8,000 BEDROOMS OF HOUSING HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED. 22,0 NEW SDENTS AND JOBS ONLY 8,000 NEW BEDS OF HOUSING. PEOPLE WONDER WHY RENTS ARE RISING AND HOUSES ARE SELLING AT ASTRONOMICAL RATES, AND THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE AMONG OTHER SYSTEMIC ISSUES, WE -- WE HAVE A SERIOUS HOUSING SHORTAGE. 22,000 NEW STUNTS AND JOBS ONLY,000 NEW BED, WHEN WE SAY THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY .2% OF HOUSING UNITS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WELL OVER 100 UNITS OF HOUSING TODAY. THAT'S 300 BEDROOMS THAT ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND POTENTIAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND I HAVE SPENT MY SHORT CAREER HERE TELLING EVERYO I CAN ABO THE MASSIVE SPARITY BETWEEN OUR HUGE DEMAND FOR HOUSING AND OUR INABILITY AND SOMETIMES UNWILLINGNESS TO BUILD ENOUGH OF IT, AND I REALIZE THAT THAT WAS A LOT OF NUMBERS, AND PROBABLY THE MOST -- THE GREATEST IMPACT I COULD MAKE ARE IN THE WAYS THAT WE CHANGE INDIVIDUAL HUMAN LIVES, D BY EXPANDING OUR DEFICIT OF HOUSING, BY REMOVING 300 BEDS, THAT HAS A REAL HUMAN TOLL ON 300 POTENTIAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS, WHO COULD LIVE HERE LONG TERM, WHO LIKELY WORK HERE, WHO LIKELY GREW UP HERE, AND THAT'S VERY REAL AND IT'S TO BE RESPECD. SO I W GLAD TO HEAR LLEAGUES WHO D'T ALWAYS EMBRACE HOUSING SUPPLY AS A TOOL TO CHIP AWAY AT OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND OUR EQUITY CHALLENGES, AND SO SEPTEMBER 8TH, 2020, IS THE DATE WHEN WE CAME TOGETHER AND AGREED HOUSING SUPPLY IS A PART OF THE AFFORDABILITY EQUATION, AND SO I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS MEASURE IN THAT CONTEXT.
03:51:31.521: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:51:32.889: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WE ARE NOT REMOVING THESE FROM THE MARKET. THEY DON'T EXIST IN THE MARKET NOW. THEY EXIST IN THE MARKET NOW AS LIKE WE ARTAKING SOME ACON DENY 300 BEDS. THEY DON'T EXIST NOW, AND YOU'RE RIGHT TO POINT OUT THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS ADDED SO MANY STUDENTS AND SO MANY JOBS BUT HAVE DONE NOTHING TO ADD ANY HOUSING ON THEIR OWN, AND I THINK WE'D HAVE MUCBETTER RESULTS IN CREATING A MORE FAVORABLE RATIO OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, NOT UNITS, NOT THE 140 UNITS WE WERE SUPPOSED TO ADD A YEAR STARTING IN 2014 OR NOT THE HOWEVER MANY UNITS WE GOT OUT OF LOWER TOWN, BUT WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS A RATIO OF THE CITYS A PERCENTAGE. SO EVERY TIME WE ADD 454 UNITS, LIKE IN LOWER TOWN, BUT ONLY 15 OF THOSE ARE AFFORDABLE, YOU KNOW, 10 TO 1 DECREASED OUR PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AVAILABLE, AND SO I ENCOURAGE US ALL TO LOOK AT IT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL UNITS AVAILABLE, AND SO I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WILL PASS, BUT IT'S PASSING FOR ALL OF THE WRONG REASONS, AND IT'S REALLY NOT -- IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE ANYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO OUR AFFORDABILITY ISSUES HERE IN THE CITY.
03:53:02.379: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THAN YOU, MR. MAYOR. YOU KNOW, THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE, AS HAS BEEN NOTED, DOES NOT PROHIBIT USING THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES AS RENTAL PROPERTIES SO LONG AS THE RENTAL PERIOD IS 30 DAYS OR MORE IF THE PROPERTY IS IN A RESIDENTIALLY ZONED DISTRICT. THERE ARE NO RENTAL DURATION RESTRICTIONS FOR THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS [FF MICMID-USE STRICT, AND I THINKHAT'S REASONAB. IN ADDITION, OUR ZONING ORDINANCE IS CLEAR THAT [ OFF MIC ] USES NOT EXPRESSLY PERMITTED ARE PROHIBITED. AT NO TIME, AS THE ISSUE [ OFF MIC ] THAT A SHORT-TERM RENTAL USE IS A VALID USE. WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT BACK WITH THE LANGUAGE AND THE DEFINITIONS IN THE ZONING DINANCE, WHI STROLY SUGGESTS PERMANENCY AND LONG-TERM USE IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT PROPERTY OWNERS WHO DECIDED TO USE THEIR PROPERTIES AS SHORT-TERM RENTALS DID SO WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC I'M NOT LAWYERND SO I CAN AND WON'T ONE ONHE NUANC LEGAL GUMENTS, BUT I WILL SAY THAT TO ME -- PERMITTING RENTAL OF A PROPERTY BUT -- FOR PURPOSES OF MAXIMIZING PERMANENT HOUSING STOCK, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT AND STATED GOAL IN ANN ARBOR IS A REASONAE ORDINANC WE DON'T HAVE A LIST OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS OR EVEN A GOOD HANDLE ON HOW MANY THERE ARE NOW. ALL WE DO KNOW IS THE NUMBER OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS HAS INDEED GROWN AND THAT EVERY HOME USE FOR SHORT-TM RENTAL IS ONE LESS UNITF PERMANENT HOUSING. THAT'S A FACT. I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL, BUT I ALSO CONTEND THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THE NUMBER OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS WILL INCREASE WITH THE CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS T BE ADDSSED, AND I WOULD BEITH THE PSAGE OF THIS ORDINANCE. THE ORDINANCE IS REASONABLE. IT STARTS WITH REGISTRATION AND LICENSING, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING THE CITY THE INFORMATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTIVITY, REGULATE GOING FORWARD, AND PROHIBITION OF REASONABLE. ENTA IN- IS ALSO -- AS LONG AS THE RENTAL PERIOD IS MORE THAN 30 DAYS, PERMITTING SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN MIXED-USE DISTRICTS IS REASONABLE ADDS WELL. HOTELS ARE IN MIXED-USE DISTRICTS, SO SHORT-TERM RENTALS I THINK SHOULD BE PERMITTED THERE AS WELL. THE BOTTOM LIN I THI IS THIS: WHATEVERAPPENS IN TERMS OF EXISNG SHORT-TERM RENTALS, THE CITY NEEDS THIS ORDINANCE PROSPECTIVELY. IF WE WANT TO PREVENT FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE SUPPLY OF PERMANENT HOUSING, AND AS I INDICATED IN MY EMAIL TO ALL OF YOU THIS MORNING, I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP THE EXISTING ZONING ORDINANCES AND REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT OE THIS ORDINAN IS ADOPD, IT WORKS ASNTENDED AND CLOSES ANY LOOPHOLES. SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. I DON'T THINK WE ALL WILL, BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY HOPE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. COUNCILMBER ACKERMAN?
03:57:05.055: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKEAN?
03:57:07.223: >>OUNCILMEMBERCKERMAN: THERE SN'T ONE VOT THAT SAID, NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE, NOW SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT. IT HAPPENED THROUGH THE COURSE OF HUNDREDS OF VOTES OVER DECADES. THE 300 BEDROOMS EXIST AS SHORT-TERM RENTALS TODAY, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO AND DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO IN THE FUTURE SO WE ARE MAKG ADECISION WE ARE DECIDINGTRADEOFFS. DO WE WANT PERMANENT HOUSING FOR RESIDENTS WHO GREW UP HERE, SPENT THEIR TAXES HERE AND CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE HERE? OR DO WE WANT THEM TO BE SHORT-TERM RENTALS? AND TO ME, THAT TRADEOFF IS A DIFFICULT ONE BUT ONE THAT I COME TO A CONCLION, WHICH I PERMANT HOUSING. JUST TO RESPOND TO THE BROADWAY ITEM, 454 UNITS OF HOUSING, 15 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE USING, I HAVE SITED JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED, AND A HUGE PORTION OF THOSE ARE NEW JOBS AT MICHIGAN MEDICINE, AT THE HOSPITAL. AND THOSE 454 UNITS OF HOUSING LOCATED NEXT TO THE HOSPITAL MEANS 454 UNITS OF HOUSING PROBABLY FOR PEOPLE WORKING AT THE HOSPITAL. WHEN U OF M CREATES A JOB, IT TSFILLEDAND IF THECAN'T LIVE NEAR THE SPITAL, THEY WILL BE COMPETING IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR HOUSING NEAR YOU OR THEY WILL BE COMMUTING IN, POLLUTING THE ENVIRONMENT, CLOGGING UP STREETS WITHOUT PAYI ANY TAXES TO MAINTAIN THEM. SO WHEN YOU SAY 454 NEW BEDROOMS OF HOUSING OR UNITS OF HOUSING, NEAR THE HOSPITAL FOSURE. SHOULDUMP ON THAT, BECSE U OF M IS NOT GOING TO STOP CREATING NEW JOBS THERE, AND WE HAVE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES. (PAUSE IN CAPTIONS.)
04:01:30.420: >> I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD GRANDFATHER IN THE EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTALS, EVEN IN THE RESIDENTIAL ZONED AREA, SO ARE YOU RECOMMENDING THAT WE TABLE THIS, OR ARE YOU RECOMMENDING THAT WE CAN APPROVE IT WITH SOME TYPE OF QUALIFICATION THAT WE WOULD  ABLE TO GRAFATHER?
04:01:59.782: >> I THINK THE TABLING DISCUSSION, THAT SHIP HAS SAILED, SO I WOULD -- I MEAN, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO, IT'S I DON'T LOVE THE IDEA OFREATINGHIS GRDFATHERED GRP OF PROPERTIES I THK IT'S HARD TO TRACK. I THINK IT'S COMPLICATED. I THINK IT'S GOING TO OPEN US UP TO THINGS WE DON'T WANT TO BE OPENED UP TO. YOU KNOW, MY -- MY REASON FOR WANTING TO TABLE WAS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE BETTER APPROACH IS TO JUST SAY THIS IS HOW MANY THAT WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW IN THE CITY, BOOM, AND COME UPITH YO LICENSING AND REGULATIONS BASED OFF THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M IN THE MINORITY ON THIS, SO -- I ALSO THINK IT'S SOMEWHAT FOOLHARDY TO ADOPT AN ORDINANCE AND GIVE OURSELVES A 45-DAY TIME FRAME TO TRY ANDEACH SOMKIND OF GRANATHERING AGRMENT BEFORE IT TAKESEFFECT I THK THAT THAT'SUST SETTING US UP FOR FAILURE, BUT, YOU KNOW, MY OPINION IS NOT GOING TO CARRY THE DAY HERE. SO, IT'S JUST MY TWO CENTS WORTH.
04:03:08.985: >> THANKS. SO, WOULD YOUR QUOTA SYSTEM -- MAYBE THAT'S NOT WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS, BUT GIVE PRIORITY TO THOSEEOPLE WHO AR OPERATG RIGHT NOW?
04:03:20.663: >> YES, I MEAN THE WAY THAT I WOULD ENVISION IT, YEAH.
04:03:23.900: >> OKAY, THANK YOU, OKAY.
04:03:26.269: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:03:33.476: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT. I'M BENDING THE RULES HERE. I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ON THE 45 DAYSND WTHER THAT CABE PUSH BACK A LITT BIT TO ALLOW THE CURRENT OPERATORS MORE TIME TO GET THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER, WHETHER THAT CAN BE PUSHED BACK, OR IS THAT BOILERPLATE STANDARD WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 45 DAYS? YOU .
04:04:45.147: >> TIGHT WE GOTIT, SO IOULD MAKE A MOTION,  IT WAS OK TO DO THAT.
04:04:52.622: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT THIS ORDINANCE BE EFFECTIVE RATHER THAN 45 DAYS, RATHER IT BE EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 28TH, 2021?
04:05:00.930: >> OR MARCH 1ST.
04:05:03.499: >> IT'S NOT A LEAP YEAR.
04:05:06.636: >> IT'S YOUR INIATIVE.
04:05:07.970: >> I WOULD SAY MARCH 1ST, 2021.
04:05:13.176: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MARCH 1ST, IS THERE A SECOND, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
04:05:23.753: >> IS THE INTENT TO GRANDFATHER IN?
04:05:30.493: >> MY INTENT IS THAT THE INVESTORS HAVE TIME TO GET THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER, IF THEY WISH TO DO SO, OR TO ALLOW OTHERS WHO ARE MORE AFFECTED BY THIS MORE TIME TO GET THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER.
04:05:42.271: >> DO YOU MEAN TO TRANSITION TO A LONG-TERM MODULE, OR DO YOU MEAN TO BE GRANDFATHERED IN AS --
04:05:48.177: >> EITHER TO TRANSITION TO A RENT O 30 DAYS OR ME OR PERHAPS SELL THE ASSET.
04:05:55.618: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT AS FRIENDLY. MS. BEAUDRY, DOES THAT -- I DON'T HAVE THE TEXT IMMEDIATELY UP IN FRONT OF ME. DO WE REQUIRE ANY FURTHER P'S AND Q'S ONTHAT,RS THAT PRETTY CLEARS TO WHATHE MEANIN OF THIS?
04:06:14.670: >>HE LAST SECTION OF THE ORDINANCE SAYS THAT THIS ORDINANCE SHALL TAKE EFFECT 45 DAYS FOLLOWING LEGAL PUBLICATION, SO I WILL JUST AMEND IT TO SAY THAT THIS ORDINANCE SHALL TAKE EFFECT MARCH 1ST, 2021, FOLLOWING LEGAL PUBLICATION.
04:06:32.321: >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
04:06:35.625: >> MAY TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? JUST BY WAY OF A LITTLE BIT OF CLARITY WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA ANALOGY, I THINK I WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT WAS NOT A PRECISE ANALOGY AND THAT IT WAS ONE THAT FURTHER -- I GUESS I WOULD SAY THE TIME FRAME I WAS THINKING OF WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA ENGAGEMENT WAS NOT THE MOST RECENT ONE, MOVING TO RECREATIONAL, BUT THE EARLY ON, I THINK IT WAS BACK IN 2010S I SIRSTN COUIL AND THEY WERE MOVING TO AREAS WHERE NOTHING PREVIOUSLY EXISTED AND HOW WE WERE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM IN THAT CONTEXT.

04:09:49.518: >> CNCILMEMBERAMLAWI:  TNK YOU. I WAS HOPING THAT WE CLD PERHAPS STRIKE THE REFERENCE TO R4E IN THE MEMORANDUM PORTION OF THIS. I AM NOT SURE IF IT BELONGS THERE IN THISF IT'S JUST ABOUT ANNEXATION. I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS IS INSINUATING SOME MORE -- YOU KNOW, SOME OF THAT IS KIND OF MORE PREDETERMINED WITH THIS ANNEXATION, GIVING SOME INSIDER TRACK OF SORTS, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE PERHAPS I'M ONG. S CASE, BUT
04:10:44.773: >> I WOULD SECOND THAT MOTION.
04:10:45.808: >> I HAVGOT THE WRONG THING IN FRONT OF ME.
04:11:12.668: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON: ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT IN THE RESOLUTION.
04:11:16.939: >> COUNCILMBER HAYNER: YEAH, 'S IN TH MEMORANDUM LINE, TWO SENTENCES -- THREE.
04:11:22.444: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  CAN WE JUST CONSIDER THAT FRIENDLY?
04:11:25.548: >> YES.
04:11:25.814: >> NOT ACTUALLY INCORRECT.
04:11:27.349: >> NO.
04:11:30.352: >> I WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY --
04:11:32.888: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PLEASE.
04:11:33.422: >> TO BE CLEAR, ANY ACTION THIS EVENING HAS NO EXCTATIO COMMMENT OF ANY NING. EVEN IF THE CITY COUNCIL DESIRED TO SOMEHOW MAKE SUCH A COMMITMENT, YOU CANNOT. YOU CANNOT TAKE ACTION TO ZONE A PROPERTY UNTIL IT IS YOUR PROPERTY, THAT IS, THE CITY'S PROPERTY. SO, AS FOR THE MEMORANDUM, I BELIEVE IT'S ACCURATELY REFLECTING PETITIONS THAT WOULD FOLLOW IF THE AEXATIONERE TO COME, THESE ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE PETITIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC THAT DELINEATE PROPOSED REZONING THAT THEY ARE SEEKING, SO IT'S DEFINITELY NOT INACCURATE, AND TO BE CLEAR, THERE'S NO -- THE INCLUSION OF THAT APPLICATION BEING UNDER REVIEW BY THE CITY MAKES NO BEANG ON ANY OBLITION FOR YOU TO ACT ON IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
04:12:36.418: >> IS IT NORMAL TO HAVE THAT AS PART OF AN MEMORANDUM WHEN IT COMES IN FOR AN ANNEXATION VOTE? IS IT NORMAL TO INDICATE WHAT EUTURE INTENTIOIS? PEAPS COULD ITE A BIT MORE BROADER AND LESS PRESCRIPTIVE?
04:12:54.069: >> IT'S COMMON, OFTENTIMES WE GET ANNEXATIONS AND REZONINGS OF PROPERTIES, AND OFTEN WE WILL SHARE INFORMATION THAT THE ANNEXATION IS THE FIRST STEP IN FUTURE PETITIONS TT WILL B PRENTED AFT THE ANNEXATIO PROCESIS COMPLETED
04:13:15.624: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I WOULD STILL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF I WASN'T A PART OF THIS, THOUGH.
04:13:21.363: >> I GUESS I WOULD LEAVE THAT QUESTION TO MR. McDONALD. THE MEMO ITSF HAS N BRING THE ACTION TICULATED INHE RESOLUON.
04:13:54.096: >> I THINK FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE CLERK AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF MR. LENART, IF MR. LENART IS COMFORTABLE THAT HE IS SAYING HE CAN REMOVE THE SENTENCE, MAYBE THE CLERK CAN REMOVE IT. I'LL LOOK TO MR. FOURNIER HERE, BUT I AM NOSURE THAT WE SHOULD GET ITHE HABIT OF COUNCIL EDITING A STAFF MEMO THAT IS JUST PRESENTING INFORMATION.
04:14:17.820: >> YEAH, I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH MR. McDONALD. I THINK THAT THE STAFF MEMO REPRESENTS THOUGHTS OF STAFF. I THINK THAT THE RESOLUTION ITSELF REPRESENTS THE ACTIONS OF COUNCIL.
04:14:28.831: >> AND JUST TO CONFIRM THAT THAT THAT'S THERE AS AN  FACT INDICATION OF WHAT THEY WILL BE ASKING FOR LATER CERTAINLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY BEARING ON YOUR ULTIMATE DECISION. IT WILL BE WITHIN YOUR PURVIEW TO WEIGH THAT INFORMATION WHEN IT COMES TO YOU TO MAKE A DECISIEPARATELY RARDING ZONG.
04:14:56.291: >>OUNCILMEMBERAMLAWI:  I MY LANE. EEING TOLD T STAY IN I RESPECT THAT. BUT IT JUST INFERS SOMETHING. I FEEL LIKE IT HAS A THUMB ON THE SCALES SOMEWHERE, AND I THINK THAT LEADS TO GREATER CONFLICT AND ISSUES, AND PERHAPS I'M WRONG, BUT I THINK THIS WOULD JUST HAVE -- THIS WILL BE REFERRED TO AT A LATER POINT INDICATING THERE WAS SOME SORT OF, YOU OW, SUPRT FOR THIS BEFORE IT WAS EVEN CONSIDERED.
04:15:24.219: >> I MIGHT RECOMMEND, THEN, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI THAT A WHEREAS CLAUSE BE ADDED TO THE RESOLUTION, INDICATING COUNCIL'S INTENT.
04:15:33.228: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  WELL, IT IS AGAINST STAFF'S --
04:15:39.067: >> MAY TAYLOR:  I THINJUST WHEREAS COUNL -- WHERS COUNCIEXPRESSES NO OPINION ABOUT THE FUTURE ZONING OF THIS ANNEXED PARCEL?
04:15:52.047: >> WHATEVER THE WILL OF THE BODY MAY BE.
04:15:55.384: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT WITH ME, BECAUSE THE "PROPOSED" IS THE PART THAT RUBS, NOT NECSARILY WHAT THEARE OPOSING,UT THEYRE GOING TOEQUEST IT. WHO IS IT "PROPOSED" BY? STAFF?
04:16:13.702: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  TO REFLECT WHAT APPEARS TO BE COUNCIL'S WILL ON THIS POINT AND ALSO TO HAVE US STAY IN OUR LANE, WOULD A WHEREAS CLAUSE OF THAT NATURE BE FRIENDLY TO THEDY? THATS TO SAY, AMEING THE SOLUTION TO Y WREAS COUNCIL EXPRESSES NO OPINION ABOUT THE FUTURE ZONING OF THIS PARCEL? IS THAT FRIENDLY?
04:16:33.222: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  NO, I -- WELL, YES AND NO. I HAVE A SUGGESTION.
04:16:43.899: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FORGIVE ME FOR SORTF BLOWING THROUGH THE QUEUE ATHIS POINT. I'MUST TRYING TO GET TS THING DONE. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IF YOU COULD BE QUICK ON THAT?
04:16:53.008: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS. I JUST RAISED MY HAND. I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS FIRST IN THE QUEUE OR NOT. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI BRINGING THIS UP. I THINK, YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S IN THE COVER MEMO, AND IT WOULD BE UNUSUAL FOR COUNCIL TO AMEND A STAFF MEMO, AS HAS BEEN NOTED, I AGREE THATHAT WOULD BUNU UNUSUAL, COULD WE JUST INCORPORATE STAFF'S OWN WORDS TOO? I THINK WHAT YOU PROPOSED FOR A EREAS- I AED THIS ABO ESTIONS, STAFFSTATED, I AED IS THE DEVELOPER'S ANNEXATION REQUEST CONTINGENT ON THIS PROPOSAL AND THE R4E ZONING BEING ACCEPTED. SO STAFF'S STATEMENT THERE IN RESPONSE I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO INCORPORATE IN THE WHEREAS, JUST TO CLARIFY, WHEREAS ANNEXATION AND ZONING ARE INDEPENDENT PETITIONS, AND IN RESPOE TO ATHER QUESTION, AFF STATE THATPPROVING THE NEXATION --HIS IS STAFF'S WORDS, DOES NOT TAKE OR IMPLY ANY ACTION IN TERMS OF THE ZONING. THAT'S VERY -- THAT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR, AND --
04:18:18.827: >> I HAVE SOME CONCERNS, AND IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE DISCUSSED THIS AMONG THE TOWNSHIPS AND THE STATE. WE ARE PASSING A RESOLUTION -- I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME, BUT THE SAME RESOLUTION OF RELEASE IS PASSED BY THE TOWNSHIP, AND SO DON'T KNOW LL JUST SAYTHIS. I DON'T KNOW THE EFFECT OF MAKING A CHANGE TO THE RESOLUTION, AND MAYBE I'LL TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR. WHAT I WAS SUGGESTING IS INSTEAD, MAYBE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, AND I DID LOOK, EVERY ANNEXATION THAT'S COME IN FRONT OF COUNCIL THAT I CAN FIND ACTUALLY HAS THE SAME SENTENCE IN IT THAT JUST GETS FILLED IN THTAFF, WITH A RECOENDATION.
04:20:48.075: >> TO ATTORNEY McDONALD'S POINT, THEN THAT RESOLUTION WOULD BE CONSIDERED CONSISTENT WITH ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE .
04:20:58.252: >> I WOULD THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD SOLUTION, AND THAT ALSO KEEPS THE RESOLUTION FORMAT IN KEEPING WITH PAST PRACTICE IN TERMS OF US RELAYG INFORMAON
04:21:07.129: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  CAN WE ALL AGREE TO MOVE ON ON THIS POINT? I'M LOOKING PARTICULARLY AT COUNCILMEMBERS EATON AND RAMLAWI WHO EXPRESSED INITIAL CONCERN ABOUT THIS.
04:21:23.311: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I'M SORRY, YES, I'M SATISFIED WITH THAT.
04:21:25.981: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  GREAT, ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL. I APPRECIATE IT. COUNCILMEMBEGRISWOLD.
04:21:39.694: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I'M WILLING TO MOVE ON TONIGHT, JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT TIME IT IS, BUT IN THE FUTURE, I THINK THAT WE SHOULD MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IF IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT, THE WE DOT WANT A ZONG CATEGORY ADDED, BAUSE FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE SOMEWHAT UNINFORMED, THAT MAY CREATE A FALSE SENSE OF THAT WE ARE PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT IS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN YOU ARE SAYING THAT IT IS. AND THE ONLY OTHER STATEMENT THAT I WANTED TOAKE IS TH RESTCTING RIGHT TURN MOVEMENT MAY BE REASONABLE IF YOU'RE IN A DOWNTOWN AREA WITH BLOCKS SO THAT YOU'RE ONLY DRIVING A FEW CITY BLOCKS OUT OF YOUR WAY, BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE AREN'T BLOCKS, AND GOING AROUND TAKE YOU ABOUT TWO MILES, AND SO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO APPROVE THIS PLAN MOVING FORWARD IF WE DON'T RESOLVE THAT RIGHT TURN RESTRICTION. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DENSITY. I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH REQUIRING PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT TWO MILES OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO AT. IN THE STREETR IN A PARKING N LOT. THANKS.
04:23:07.849: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:23:17.192: >>OUNCILMEMBERUMM:  I WIL THIS ACTION IS TO ENACT THE ROUGHLY TEN ACRES. IT'S NOT, AS WE MADE CLEAR IT'S TO APPROVE ZONING OF THE SITE PLAN, WHICH IS TO COME LATER AFTER THE ANNEXATION IS COMPLETE. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE PARCELS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANNEXATION AGREEMENT WITH PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP, AND I THINK MOST OF US RECOGNIZE THAHIS IS NOT YR NORMAL GARDE RIETY ANNEXATION. IN FACT, FAR FROM IT. THE PLANNING COMMISSION AT ITS JULY 21ST MEETING RECOMMENDED APPROVAL OF THE R4E ZONING AND A 450 ZONING -- WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT MIGHT LIE AHEAD AFTER THE ANNEXATION IS COMPLED. AGAIN, I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI CLARIFYING AND MR. LENART YOUR SUGGESTION TO INCORPORATE THIS HISTORICAL INFORMATION, IF YOU WILL, INTO THE MEMORANDUMS THAT ARE PROVIDED GOING FORWARD, IS -- WILL BVERY HELPFUL I DON'T LI -- I DON'T LIKE THE PICTURE OF WHAT MIGHT LIE AHEAD, AND LIKELY, COUNCIL WILL BE ASKED TO APPROVE THIS R4E ZONING. IT'S A ZONING THAT STAFF DID NOT SUPPORT, BECAUSE IT'S- I SIIFICANTLY DEFEATI FROM THE PROPOSED DENSITY IN THE MASTER PLAN LAND USE ELEMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN. STAFF RECOMMENDED R1D, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN, AND WOULD LIMIT THE SIZE OF THE DEVELOPMENT TO A MUCH MORE REASONABLE 80 UNITS. I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH STAFF THAT 450 UNITS, OR FIVE TIMES CONTEMPLED, JUST ISN'T AT ALL APPROPRIATE. PLANNING COMMISSION CLEARLY HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW, AND THE RESPONSE WAS THAT APPROVING THE RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE ANNEXATION THAT WE HAVE COVERED, AND THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPLICATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT DECISIO ONONING AN THE SITE AN, THAT'S GOI TO KNOW. THAT IS MFORTING. I WILL SAY THAT WE GOT A PREVIEW FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON WHERE THIS MIGHT BE HEADED, BECAUSE AS WE HEARD THIS EVENING FR SE OF THE RESIDEN AND HERS, THERE HA BEEN CONCER RAISED, AND THIS CAME UP IN THE JULY 7TH AND 21st STAFF REPORTS ON THE PROJECT, CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT HEIGHT TRAFFIC, BUILDING DESIGN, AND IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE DEVELOPER MADE SUBSNTIVE CHANGETO ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE CONCERNS. SO, WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DID THE PLANNING COMMISSION THEN -- EVEN THOUGH NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES WERE MADE, BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY CHANGED IS THAT THE STATIONS INCASED A BIT, AND V THEIR 15 AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE NOW 60% AMI, RATHER THAN NINE UNITS AT 60% AMI, SO THERE WERE THESE RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES THAT JUSTIFIED, IN THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S REVIEW, REVERSING STAFF'S POSITN RECMENDING APPROVAL OF THE DSITY THAT IS FIVE TIMES WHAT IS CONTEMPLATED IN THE MASTER PLAN. SO THIS IS JUST A SHOUT-OUT TO THE COMMUNITY WHO HAS RAISED THESE CONCERNS THAT IT APPEARS THAT THINGS LIKE HIGH-TRAFFIC MITIGATION, SITE LAYOUT, BUILDING DESIGN, THOSE CONCERNS ARE GOING TO TAKE A BACKSEAT TO THEIR ISSUES TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY ASPECTS, AND AS WE KNOW, THE PLANNING COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT THOSE GOALS WERE ADVANCED. SO, WE HAVE A PROCT THAT HAS A DENSITY AT HAS -- THAT IS MORE THAN FIVE TIMES GREATER THAN WHAT THE MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDS FOR THIS SITE. SO, I AM SURE I WON'T BE AROUND WHEN THIS SITE PLAN COMES BACK IN THE ZONING, BUT IT'S JUST A BIT OF AN EYE-OPENER AND A HEADS-UP. THANK YOU.
04:28:01.743: >> MAYOR TAYR:  COUNCILMBER
04:28:02.510: >> COUNCILMBER GRAND: HANK YO I' VERY ENTHUSIASTIC TO SUPPORT THIS ANNEXATION. I THINKS IN A REAL -- I THINK THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO ADD HOUSING CLOSE TO WHERE PEOPLE WORK AND STUDY, THAT'S ON A TRANSIT CORRIDOR RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM A PARK AND RE AN RIGHT AROUN THEORNER FM ANOTHER RK AND RI, SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WANTING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO THOSE KINDS OF AMENITIES, ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT -- I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA OF PROVING THAT WE CAN DO A COMPLETELY ELECTRIFIED PROJECT, AND THOSE SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES MATTER TO ME. AS COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN SAID, TONIGHT IS T NIG WHERE W ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE, SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO EVENTUALLY SEEING SOMETHING BUILT THERE THAT HOPEFULLY ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY, BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP, AND DEFINITELY WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS THAT MOST OF US WANT TO SEE FOR THE CITY. SO, I'M EXCITED TO WELCOME OUR NEW NEIGHBORS FROM THIS PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP ISLAND TO OUR CITY.
04:29:15.450: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:29:19.053: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I JUST -- FIRST OF ALL, I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS. I THINK, YOU KNOW, IF NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS ON THIS SITE, WE'LL HAVE ANNEXED TEN ACRES OF LAND AND GET IT ON THE T ROS, AND THAT'S BETTER THAN PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE SITE RIGHT NOW AND NOT GETTING ANYTHING IN RETURN, SO IF NOTHING ELSE, THIS MEASURE IS ITSELF AN INCREMENTAL BENEFIT. BUT I ALSO DID JUST WANT TO CLARIFY AND RECHARACTERIZE THE CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENED AT PLANNING COMMISSION. I ASSUMED THIS ONE WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER, SO I DON'T HAVE LI THOROUGHOTES IN FRONOF ME. BUT THE KEY CONCESSIONS ON THE PART OF THE PETITIONER, AND THAT I THINK WE MOVED THE NEEDLE ON PLANNING COMMISSION -- AND I WILL NOTE THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS ORIGINALLY NOT FRIENDLY OR SYMPATHETIC TO THE POSITION OF THE DEVELOPER, AND IT WAS THROUGH A SERIES OF POSTPONEMENTS AND NEGOTIATION THAT WE TO A PLA WHERE WE WERE COMFORTABLE, BUT THE MAJOR CONCESSIONS THAT I THINK SPOKE TO THAT BODY, AND AT LEAST WERE ARTICULATED BY THE MEMBERS OF IT, WERE, A, IN FACT THE MASSING AND HEIGHT DID DECREASE. SO BUILDING B, WHICH IS THE FURTHEST SOUTH, WHICH IS CLOSEST TO THE GOLF VIEW NEIGHBORS, WAS REDUCED IN SIZE BETWEENHEIR BLIC MEETING AND THE FINAL SITE PLAN SUBMISSION THAT WE SAW AT PLANNING COMMISSION. SO, BUILDING B, WHICH IS CLOSEST TO THE NEIGHBORS WHO ARE 300 YARDS AWAY, DID DECREASE IN HEIGHT BY A STORY. AND THEN, ALSO, THE SOLAR INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE AFFORDAB HOUSING INCREASED SIGNICANTLY, A 66% GAIN. GRANTED, IT'S NOT A LOT, BUT IT'S SOMETHING, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF MARKET RATE GOING UP WITH NOTHING. AND THEN THE FINAL ONE, WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND UNDERAPPRECIATED, IS FULL ELECTRIFICATION OF THE SITE. THIS WOULD REPRESENT ANN ARBOR'S FIRST FULLY ELECTRIFIED THERE WOUL BE NO NURAL GAS CONNECTIONS. AS WE KNOW, NATURAL GAS IS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE TOP FIVE PUBLIC ENEMIES WHEN IT COMES TO CARBON EMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND GAS APPLIANCES ARE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT. GAS HEATING, OF HOUSING, IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT. SO THE ELECTRIFICATION GETS IT ON A GRID THAT, AS THE CITY MOVESO ENTIRELY RENABLE ENERGY RESOURCESCOULD VERY WELL BE ENTIRELY POWERED BY RENEWABLE ENERGY, THE RENEWABLE ENERGY CREATED ON-SITE AS WELL AS A BROADER GRID SUPPORTED BY DTE AND THE CITY THAT IS POWERED BY RENEWABLE AS WELL. SO, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS OUR FST EVER FUY ELECTR DEVELOPMENT
04:32:06.053: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON THIS.
04:32:11.025: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SURE. I'LL BE BRIEF. I WOULD LOVE FOR MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES HELP ME PUSH THROUGH THE ELECTRIFICATION ORDINANCE THAT WAS REJECTED BY OUR LEGAL STAFF, ESSENTIALLY, WHERE I WAS ELECTRIFICION ORDINANCE FORWARD IN ADVANCE OF A2 ZERO DOING IT SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE ROAD, WHEN THE STATE FINALLY GETS ON BOARD WITH IT. WE HAD A FULLY COMPLETED ONE. MR. GARBER CALLED IN TONIGHT TO HELP SPEAK TO THE BENEFITS OF IT, AND HE GOT ME TO WRITE ONE AT BOUNC THROUGH THE ENEY COMMSION, AND IN THE PAST PRIOR TO MY BEING THERE, AND WE HAD ONE WRITTEN UP, AND IT WAS REJECTED, ESSENTIALLY BY LEGAL'S ANALYSIS OF IT, AND IT HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT FOR TO THE BODY DESPITE MY WANTING TO DO IT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY COLLEAGUES CAN DO TO HELP ME GET THIS ON E ENDA. WAS TOLD IN WRITING, AND THESE THINGS ARE NEVER PUBLISHED FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE, BUT I WAS GIVEN A PERSONAL CONFIDENTIAL MEMO FROM LEGAL THAT BASICALLY SAID DON'T BOTHER TRYING TO BRING A RESOLUTION BEFORE COUNCIL, WAS THE ESSENCE OF IT. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THAT, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BRING IT RWARD, ANDE COULD HAVE DONE IT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO OR TWO MONTHS AGO OR WHATEVER. SO I RESPECT THE NOTION THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A COMMUNITY, OR I WOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED THAT, AND THANK YOU TO KEN GARBER, MR. GARBER, FOR PUSHING THAT AND GETTING ME TO MOVE THAT FORWARD AND MOVE IT TO LEGAL TO BE WRITTEN AS A PROPER RESOLUTION TO ADD IT TO OUR ZONING. I WISH WE COULD. I AMOT SURE WHAT NEED TO DO TO GET THAT TO HAPPEN. SO, I HAVEN'T SUPPORTED ANY OF THESE ANNEXATIONS, BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE LIVING IN THE TOWNSHIP, YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY LIVING IN THE CITY BUT PAYING LOW, LOW TOWNSHIP TAXES, SO AS A RESULT, YOUR HOUSE ITSELF IS AFFORDABLE. SO CONSIDER ANNEXATION REMOVING UNITS FROM AFFORDABILITY. I KNOW THAT THIS ONE IS GOING TO PASS AGAIN WITHOUT ME, BUT I HAVEN'T SUPPORTED MANY OF THESE ANNEXATIONS DESPITE THE LONGSTANDING AGREEMENTS WITH TOWNSHIPS, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE TOWNSHIP ISLANDS REPRESENT ALL OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE RAGING ABOUT THIS ONE BEING SO OFTEN, B ASOON AS WE ANNEX THEM, WE ARE REPLACED WITH NONAFFORDABLE HOUSING. ONCE YOU COME INTO THE CITY, IT'S OVER FOR AFFORDABILITY, AND SO THAT DOESN'T SPEAK TO SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS MUCH AS OUR HIGH PROPERTY TAXES AND HIGH COST OF CONNECTING TO OUR UTILITIES AND SO ON. ANNEXATION AND I CTAINLY WON'T SUPPO A 50-UNITER ACRE REQUEST TO REZONE IT AGAINST OUR MASTER PLAN. BUT I WOULD SUPPORT ANY KIND OF ELECTRIFICATION AND BRINGING A RESOLUTION FORWARD, SO I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME HELP FROM MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES ON GETTING THAT MOVING AGAIN, AND I WILL -- I BELIEVE IT'S WELL WITHIN MY RIGHTS TOORWARD AT, I ANYONE WOU BE INTERESD IN SEEING WHAT THE REJECTION OF MY RESOLUTION WAS. I THINK THAT IT'S FINE, IF THAT'S CONTINUED TO BE A -- I CAN REDISTRIBUTE IT TO MY COLLEAGUES, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL, YOU KNOW, THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT -- WE ARE THE CLIENT, SO I'M GOING TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU, AND I WOULD LIKE YOUR INPUT ON THAT. THANK YOU.

[ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? C2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5., 5.29.2, 5.33.2, 5.35.2, 5.36.2, AND 5.37 OF CHAPTER  55, SIGN REGULATIONS, AT FIRST READING,OVED BY BY UNCILMEMBER SMIT SECOND BY BY -- COUNCILMEMR LUMM?
04:37:10.658: >> COUNCILMEMBERUMM:  SORRY, YOU CALLED ON ME, MR. MAYOR?
04:37:14.595: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I DID.
04:37:15.196: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OKAY, THANKS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR TAKING THE TIME TO REVISIT AND UPDATE THIS SIGN ORDINANCE. CLEARLY, NO QUESTION, IT WAS A LOT  TI,FFORT, A THOHT THATENT INTO THE RECOMMENDATIONS, AND THAT'S APPRECIATED. THIS IS THE FIRST READING. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT, AND I WILL BE INTERESTED TO SEE IF THERE ARE COMMENTS, OBJECTIONS, SUGGESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED BETWEEN NOW AND SECOND READING OR AT THE PUBLIC HEARING THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND READING. THE LAST UPDATE OF THIS ORDINANC WAS WN DIGITAL ELECTRONIC SIGNS BECAME MORE PREVALENT, AND THERE WAS A GOOD BIT OF DISCUSSION THEN ON ILLUMINATION LEVELS, AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS UPDATE IS CONSISTENT WITH AND BUILDS UPON THE WORK THAT WAS DONE THEN. IT ALSO INCLUDES NEW PROVISIONS CLARIFYING THAT TEMPORARY SIGNS FROM PROJEING ON A NEIGHBONGS PROPERTY. I SUPPORT THE GENERAL APPROACH TAKEN OF ELIMINATING REGULATION DIFFERENCES BASED ON CONTENT AND BASING REQUIREMENTS ON THE UNDERLYING ZONING DISTRICT. BOTH OF THOSE APPROACHES ARE REASONABLE AND LOGICAL. I ALSO SUPPORT INCLUSION OF THE INTENT SECTION, WHICH OUTNES THPURPES OF RELATION, WHICH ARE LISTED AS PEDESTRIAN, VEHICLE SAFETY, CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF LIFE, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PROPERTY VALUES, AVOIDANCE OF NUISANCE LIGHT CONDITIONS, AND PROPERTY CONDITION AND WAY FINDING. I THINK THIS IS A SOLID FRAMEWORK TO THINK THROUGH WHAT THE ORDINANCE IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, AND ALL OTHE ARE APOPRIATE JUSTICATIONS FOR REGULATI. ALTHOUGH I'M NOT A FAN OF BILLBOARDS, I DO UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NECESSARY. THE EXISTING BILLBOARDS ARE GRANDFATHERED, SO, AS I SAID, I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS AT FIRST READING, AND I WILL BE CURIOUS TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY CONCERNS OR OBJECTIONS RAISED, D, AGN, I WOULD JT LIKE TO THANK EVERYE FOR THEARD WOR IN PREPANG THE UPDATE FOR OUR NSIDERATION.
04:39:26.861: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:39:28.329: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, THANKS. I'LL SUPPORT THIS SO WE CAN GET TO A PUBLIC HEARING, BUT I DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE SIGN ORDINANCE, AND ACTUALLY, SOME OF THEM WERE ILLUMINATED IN THE NOTABLE SECONS OF CTENT SECTIONS O CONTENT TO HELP CLARIFY THE IMPACT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SQUARE FOOTAGE OF A SIGN, LIKE, WE GIVE AN EXAMPLE -- THERE AOME O THINGSNHE. A SIX-FOOT NONCOMMERCIAL SIGN WOULD BE TWO BY THREE FEET, BUT THEN IT SAYS TWO SIDED. WELL, A TWO SIDED SIGN IS 12 SQUARE FEET. WE ARE ALLOWING, AS AN EXAMPLE, THAT'S ONE SIDE OF A SIGN, TWO BY THREE. THAT'S ONE SIDE. TWO SIDES IS 12 SQUARE FEET, SO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT CONSIDERED PROPERLY IN HERE. AND MOST SIGNS OF THAT NATURE, TEMPORARY SIGNS, POLITICAL SIGNS, THINGS LIKE THAT, THOSE ARE TWO-SIDED, AND IT EVEN SAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, THIS WOULD ALLOW WOULD ALLOW ONE TWO BY  FOOT THREE-FOOT SIGN. SO WHAT WE REALLY SAYING IS 12 SQUARE FEET IS WHAT'S ALLOWED. I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH TEMPORARY SIGNAGE, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TEMRARY SIGNAGE DURATION- GET THAT, IT COULD BE A BLM SIGN, WHATEVER YOU WANT. THOSE ARE POPULAR RIGHT NOW. IT SAYS DURATION OF A TEMPORARY SIGN MAY BE EXTENDED FOR THIS COMMERCIAL TEMPORARY SIGN, WHERE ALL OR A PORTION OF A PROPERTY IS FOR LEASE OR SALE, SO MY NCERN THERES WE HAD RECEIVE MPLAINTS ANDONCERNS FROM RESIDENTS ABOUT TEMPORARY SIGNS ON RENTAL PROPERTIES, AND WE HAVE NARROWED DOWN THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW A PERMANENT SIGN ON A RENTAL PROPERTY, THIS PROPERTY FOR RENT, HERE'S THE PHONE NUMBER, WHATEVER IT IS, BUT WE HAVE BASICALLY WAIVED THE NOTION THAT THESE BINYL BANNERS THAT SAY YOUAY HAVE SEE ON PPERTIES ON THE SIDE OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS LIKE -- I MEAN, THERE'S A VERY LARGE ONE ON THE FRONT OF A BUILDING ON STATE JUST SOUTH OF PACKARD. IT'S A BIG OXFORD APARTMENT BUILDING THAT'S A BRICK BUILDING, AND THEY HAVE A FULL-TIME TEMPORARY SIGN THERE, BASICALLY, BECAUSE ANY REAL ESTATE OR APARTMENT BUILDING COULD EASILY CLAIM THAT THEY E NSTANTLY FOR LEASE OR SALE, AND SO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO GET A GRIP ON THESE PERMANENT REAL ESTATE SIGNS AND PERMANENT FOR RENT SIGNS THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY TEMPORARY, BUT ARE IN EFFECT -- BUT -- ARE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY BUT ARE ESSENTILY PERNENT I THINK THAT'S ONOF THE BIG COMPLAINTS THAT I HAD HEARD FROM RESIDENTS, IS THEY DON'T LIKE THE NOTION OF THESE BANNERS FLAPPING IN THE BREEZE ON HOUSES EVERYWHERE, THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO RECONSIDER THOSE NOTIONS OF TEMPORARY SIGNS, ESPECIALLY THE REAL ESTATE ONES. SO I ALSO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY BUSINESS CENTER SIGNS WERE ELIMINATED. I GET THAT IT MIGHT LEAD TO, ESPECIALLY WITH OUR ZERO SETBACKS THAT ARE IN EFFECT IN SOME OF THESE COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS, THAT THEY MIGHT LEAD TO POORER SIGHT LINES AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ISSUES AND SO ON. I AM NOT SURE IF THAT'S WHERE THAT CAME FROM, BUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS B WHIC THOSE ARERELATED. ALL OF THAT TO SAY I GUESS I'LL SUPPORT IT AT A PUBLIC HEARING, BUT I'LL DIG THROUGH IT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN TO SEE IF THERE ARE APPROPRIATE AREAS TO AMEND. THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL OF THEM. I RAN OUT OF TIME HERE, BUT LL FINDORE.
04:44:03.337: >>AYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRD.
04:44:04.438: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE JUST NOT THOUGHT AS CAREFULLY ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, THE WORD CHARACTER COMES TO MIND, WHICH I KNOW I KEEP HARPING ON IN VARIOUS PLANNING ORDINANCES, BUT IF WE COULD POSSIBLY CHANGE IT TO BE SOMETHING LESS LOADED, IOULD PRECIATE THAT. THANKS
04:44:25.826: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:44:27.561: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANKS, MR. MAYOR, AND THANKS TO COLLEAGUES FOR DIGGING INTO THIS. LIKE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND MENTIONED, THIS IS THREE YEARS IN THE MAKING, AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I PROMISE THERE WAS NOT AN ELEMENT OF THIS THAT WASN'T DISCUSSED AND DECIDED FOR SOME GOOD REASON AND S WOULD ENCOURAGE COLLEAGUES, IF THEY DO HAVE QUESTIONS, TO SPEND TIME WITH STAFF BETWEEN NOW AND SECOND READING, SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS TOOK PLANNING COMMISSION THREE YEARS TO DISCUSS AND DELIBERATE, AND THERE'S A LOT OF NUANCE, DETAIL, AND CALCULATION INLVED, AND IF W T TO DO IT THE TABLE, IT'S GNG TO TAKE JU AS MANY YEARS FOR US TO PASS IT. SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO DO OUR HOMEWORK BETWEEN NOW AND THEN AND COME BACK WITH VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS OF DEBATE AND DISCUSSION, JUST AS A WARNING.
04:45:25.752: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? PERHAPS WITH THAT IN MIND, W CA MOVE THIS SECOND READING OF THIS BACK A LITTLE BIT. DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT? HOW ABOUT -- THIS IS THE FIRST MEETING IN SEPTEMBER. ANYBODY HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER?
04:45:47.908: >> COUNCILMBER HAYNER: I MEAN I DON'T NEE ADDITIONAL TIME. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT. I MEAN, I JUST DON'T HAVE -- I COULDN'T POUR IT ALL OUT HERE ON THE FIRST READING IN THREE MINUTES.
04:46:00.921: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SURE, MAYBE LET'S ROLL WITH THE FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER TO GET EVERYBODY SOME TIME.
04:46:05.192: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, OKAY, THANK YOU.
04:46:08.328: >> CITY CLERK:  MAYOR, FOR PUBLICATION AND NOTICING, THIS WOULD -- WE WOU AUTOMATICAL SCHEDULE F T FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER AT THE EARLIEST.
04:46:17.070: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WELL... [ LAUGHTER ]. HERE I WAS, THOUGHT I WAS BEING CLEVER. BUT, AGAIN, YOU SEE THIS IS EXACTLY RIGHT, CLERK. PER MY COMMENTS TO THE PRIOR. ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE ALWAYS SEVERAL STEPS AHEAD. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF E MAIN TION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ]
04:46:41.561: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC1, RESOLUTION TO AMEND THE OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OPEB FUNDING POLICY, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BYOUNCILMEMBERNELSON. COUNCILMEMR ACKERMAN?1.
04:47:00.147: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANKS, MR. MAYOR, AND THANKS, COLLEAGUES, FOR ASKING YOUR QUESTIONS, PARTICULARLY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AHEAD OF THE MEETING, AND BECAUSE I SAW THOSE, I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT OF WHERE THIS CAME FROM AND THE CONTEXT. SO, THIS POLICY AMENDMENT TAKES ROOT IN THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN ME AND MR. CRAWFORD BACK IN MAY. I CAME ON THE HEELS OF A PRESENTATION THAT HE DID TO COUNCIL THAT PROJECTED A POSSIBLE $10 MILLION HOLE IN OUR BUDGET DUE TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF COVID-19. WE ALL EXIST IN A CYCLICAL ECONOMY. SEEMINGLY WITHOUT FAIL, WE HAVE GENERALLY GOOD ECONOMIC POLIC DIRECTS THAT DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, GOVERNMENT SAVES, AND DURING ECONOMIC DECLINE, GOVERNMENT SPENDS WHILE PEOPLE ARE FACING ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AND STIMULATE THE ECONY. WEAVE SEEN T GREAT RECESSION AND NOW CORONAVIRUS. CURRENTLY WE DO PUT ASIDE 15% OF OUR GENERAL FUND EVERY YEAR, BUT THAT PROVES IN SOME EXTREME CASES TO NOT BE ENOUGH, AND ALSO ADDING TO THOSE RESERVES CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR INTEREST RATES WHEN WE NEED TO BORROW MONEY FOR LARGE CAPITAL PROJECTS, LIKE OUR WATER TREATMT PLANTS ANDHELIKE. SO, THIS POLICY AMENDMENT ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE ANY POTENTIAL UNBUDGETED DEFICIT ISSUE IN THE FUTURE AND KEEP OUR INTEREST RATES LOW BY CREATING MORE FLEXIBILITY IN OUR BUDGETING PROCESS. SO, ESSENTIALLY, IT TAKES MONEY WE ALREADY PUT AWAY INTO RETIREE HEALTH CARE AND ALLOWS US TO USE OSE DOLLARS ON MUNIPAL SERVICESN TIMES OF NEED, OR COULD, HYPOTHETICALLY. THE POLICY WOULD IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PUT INTO THE FUND THAT PAYS FOR RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, TAKING IT DOWN TO 90% FUNDED FROM THE CURRENT 100%. IT SIMPLY TAKES THAT % AND MAKES THE DOLLARS MORE FLEXIBLE FOR USE IN TIMES OF -- SO THAT'S GENERALLY THE GIST. THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM. IT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD, PARTICULARLY FOR MR. CRAWFORD AND MR. HORNING FOR LISTENING. THE MECHANISMS CONTAINED IN THE POLICY ARE MORE A PRODUCT OF THEIR CREATIVE THINKING THAN MY MINE.
04:50:22.516: >> A PRIMARY REASON FOR THAT IS THE RIGOROUS FINANCIAL POLICIES AND DISCIPLINES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF FUNDING LEGACY COST OBLIGATIONS, PENSN AND RETIREE HEALTH CARE OV THE YEARS, MR. CRAWFORD AND HIS TEAM HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO EDUCATE AND DISCIPLINE US, CITY COUNCIL, ON THE MERITS AND BENEFITS OF THESE RIGOROUS BUDGET AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, AND IT'S WORKED. COUNCIL DOES NOT BEMOAN THE FACT FUNDING TSE LEGACY COST R OBLIGATIS CANT BE USED FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AND INIATIVES. I THINK THAT'S EXCELLENT FISCAL DISCIPLINE, AND THIS RESOLUTION, IN MY VIEW, IS AN UNNECESSARY STEP BACKWARDS AND AWAY FROM THOSE VERY DISCIPLINES THAT HAVE SERVED US SO WELL. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I DID ASK, I ASKE FOR STAFF'S VW ON THE PROS AND CONS OF CHANGING THE POLICY, RATHER THAN ACTING ON A ONE-OFF BASIS, WHEN IT WOULD BE NECESSARY, AND THE RESPONSE THAT WAS RECEIVED THIS MORNING INDICATED THAT IN TERMS OF THE OS, IT WOD EABLISH A RESERVE OF FUNDS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY IN A TIME OF GREAT NEED, AND THE CONS ARE THAT THE FUND IS CREATED FROM FUNDS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE INCENTED A VIVO TRUST, WHICH WOULD B SWED CORRESPOINGLY. AT WE AREEING ASKED TO DO WITH THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT IS ADOPT A POLICY THAT SAYS WE WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY FUND THE TRUST FOR RETIREE HEALTH CARE TO ACHIEVE THE 100% LEVEL BUT TO 90% AND SET THE DIFFERENCE ASIDE TO PERHAPS USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THAT'S, IN MY VIEW, A VY SLPERY SLOPE, NO MATR HOW YOU STRUCTURE IT OR WHAT YOU CALL IT. ONCE YOU PUT DOLLARS IN PLAY, THEY BECOME VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR COUNCILMEMBERS TO USE FOR OTHER PRIORITIES OR OTHER PROGRAMS. DEBATING FUNDING ALLOCATIONS BETWEEN DISCRETIONARY POLICIES, DISCRETIONARY PRIORITIES -- I'M SORRY -- IS ONE THING, BUT FUNDING PENSIONNDETIREE HEALTH CARE LIGATIONS ISOT. IT IS NOT DISCRETIONARY. AND, FRANKLY, IT'S THE QUOTE, "WE CAN WORRY ABOUT FUNDING THESE LEGACY OBLIGATIONS LATER," END QUOTE ATTITUDE THAT HAS GOTTEN SO MANY CITIES AND STATES IN SERIOUS TROUBLE, BECAUSEE HAVE ADHERED TO DISCIPLINES, AND WE SHOULDN'T START WALKING AWAY FROM THEM NOW. IN THE RECENT FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN, WE REDUCED THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE VIVA TRUST, BUT THOSE WERE THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE MADE AVE THE ACTUARIALLY REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT WAS A ONE-TIME ACTION, AND THIS IS MUCH, MUCH DIFFERENT. IT IS NOT THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE, BUT RATHER THE BASIC, ACTUARIALLY REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, AND WE ARE SAYING THAT WE MAY USE A PORTION OF THOSE DOLLARS FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE. I AM SURE THE SPONSOR AND SUPPORTERS WILL SAY I'M OVERBLOWING THIS. WELL, TT MAYELL B THEIR OPINION, BUT I DO NOT THINK SO. I'LL JUST SAY I HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. IN FACT, I WAS HERE IN THE 1990s WHEN THE VIVA TRUST WAS INITIALLY ESTABLISHED, AND I HAVE COME TO SEE HOW GLAD WE ARE ALL TODAY THAT WE HAVE STUCK WITH THESE RIGOROUS FINANCIAL POLICIES, THAT TOM HAS ESTABLISD FOR US. SO, T'S NOT START WALKINGWAY FROM THEM NOW. SO, FOR THOSE REASONS, I'LL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT, AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
04:54:23.890: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
04:54:25.859: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOUR OBSERVATIONS AND FDBK ARE PERFECTLWELL TAKEN. I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE, YOU KNOW, WE CAN HAVE DISAGREEMENT, AND IT'S FINE. I THINK THE WAY THIS IS ENVISIONED AND THE REASON THAT THE FUNDING IS GOING TO THE LOCATION THAT IT IS IS SO THAT THIS ISN'T CASH THAT CAN BE USED GIVEN YEARTHATT EXIST IN N ANY THE RISK FUND TO BE SLIGHTLY REMOVED FROM COUNCIL AND IN THE REALM OF STAFF, WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY AS NEEDED. THE -- THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T -- CITY COUNCIL WOULDN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SHAPING THOSE BUDGETS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WOULDN'T BE REONSIBLE FOR UIMATELY EXUTING CONTRACTSO SPEND AT MONEY, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE MONEY THAT WE ARE NECESSARILY LOOKING AT EVERY SINGLE GENERAL FUND BUDGET CYCLE IN MAY TO SPEND AS WE SEE FIT AS POLICY MAKERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF CONSTITUENTS. THE -- I GUESS THE ANALOGY THAT I WOULD STRIKE, AND I'M SOMETIMES CAUTIOUSF USING ANALOGOU OF PERSONALINANCE AND GOVERNMT FINANCE,ECAUSE THEY ARE NOT APPLES TO APPLES, BUT WE ALL KNOW, RIGHT, LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT, AND YOU DO YOUR BEST TO HAVE CASH RESERVES IN YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT, SHOULD SOMETHING GO WRONG, AND THAT'S OUR GENERAL FUND RESERVE, BUT EQUALLY WE HAVE SAVINGS. SOME OF THE SAVINGS ARE IN THE MARKET, SO THAT IT CANROW A A RATE GATER THAN INFLATION, AND SOME OF THE SAVINGS IS IN CASH IF WE NEED IT, BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT WITHIN ARM'S REACH SO IT'S NOT SPENDABLE. AND THE VIVA TRUST IS IN THE MARKET, WHICH IS INVESTED IN ORDER TO SEE RETURNS GREATER THAN INFLATION SO THAT WE CAN PAY DOWN LIABILITIEST A EATER RATE OR AT A REALISTIC RATE. HOWEVER, WE CAN TAKE OUT A SMALL AMOUNT FROM THE MARKET AND HAVE IT AS A RESERVE AS NEEDED IN DESIRE FINANCIAL SITUATIONS, AS WE EXPERIENCED FOR THIS YEAR AND LIKELY NEXT YEAR. THAT'S THE MOTIVE NOARDEELINGS TO AONE AGAINSTHIS I THK THAT IT'S A CLEVER WAY TO STORE AWAY MORE MONEY SO THAT FUTURE COUNCILS DON'T HAVE TO DO THE KIND OF BUDGET CUTS THAT WE HAD TO DO THIS YEAR, AND LIKELY THE NEXT COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO DO FOR NEXT YEAR AS WELL. REALLY, I'M TRYING TO SOLVE BUDGETS. R FUTURE UNCILS AND
04:57:10.823: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:57:12.692: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WELL, YEAH. FIRST, LET ME SAY, OF ALL OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS I KNOW, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S KNOWLEDGE OF PRUDENT FISCAL PRACTICE IS RESPECTED ABOVE ALL OTHERS. EVEN BORE I HEARD HER COMPELLING ARGUMENTS JUST NOW, I WAS PREPARED TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE OF THE NOTION THAT WE HAVE LONG SAID WE ARE GOING TO STRIVE FOR 100% FUNDING OF THESE, AND TAKING 10% OFF OF THAT ISN'T REALLY STRIVING, IN OPINIO THINK THAT Y STRIV FOR FULL FUNDING, ANDHAT'S YOUR GOAL, AND THAT'S THE GOAL THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE, AND SO I WAS PREPARED TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BASED ON THAT LANGUAGE ALONE. THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD FREE UP ANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND T FILL BGET GAPS FILLS MW WITH -- WELL, IT'S NOT -- I'M NOT -- I'M ILL AT EASE WITH THAT NOTION, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO CUT SOME 4 MILLION FROM OUR BUDGET, AND I THINK WE ONLY CUT 1.2 MILLION, AND EVERYBODY VOTED ON IT LIKE IT WAS NO BIG DEAL. CAN DOWN T ROAD. NG THE BUDGET I DON'T THIN THIS  A GOOD IDEA. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO FULLY FUND OUR PENSION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT 100%. I DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO PLACE TRUST IN A FUTURE BODY THAT IS IN FINANCI DIFFICULTY TO OPEN UP ANY BIT OF OUR OBLIGATIONS TO FILL BUDGET GAPS. THAT POINTS TO THE QUESTION OF, YOU KNOW, THEN WE ARE BACK TO ARGUING PRIORITIES, AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SEEN WHERE THAT'S GOTTEN US, SO, YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS, AND I THAN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR SPEAKINGNCE AGAIN SO ELOQUENTLY TO THESE COMPLEX FINANCIAL MATTERS.
04:59:25.658: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:59:28.461: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR, AND THANKS TO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR BRINGING THIS UP FOR DISCUSSION, AND THINKING CREATIVELY, AS WE ARE TACKLING FUTURE BUDGE SHORTFALLS. BUT UORTUNATELY C'T SUORT THI TONIGHT. I'M MORE IN THE FINANCIAL DISCIPLINARY SCHOOL OF COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. IT'S BEEN AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE, THAT WE ARE UNDERFUNDED IN OUR RETIREMENT AND HEALTH CARE OBLIGATIONS. I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STAY THE COURSE AND MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS AS WE GO RWARD IN OTHER AREAS AND NOT SLIP AND GO DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND FALL BACKWARDS AND LOSE THE PROGRESS THAT THE CITY HAS MADE IN THE RECENT YEARS IN TACKLING THIS ISSUE. I DON'T THINK IT'S AS DIRE OF SITUION AS MANY MAY THINK IT IS. IF IT DOES GET TO THAT POINT, THEN WE CAN REVISIT THIS, BUT I DON'T -- IT DOESN'T -- THE SITUATION TODAY DOES NOT REACH SUCH ACTION. , THE LEVEL TO TAKE IF IT DOES, THEN PERHAPS I WOULD RECONSIDER THIS AND BRING IT BACK AT A LATER DATE, BUT RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN THAT POSITION, WHERE WE NEED TO LOSE PROGRESS ON A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER.
05:01:27.280: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
05:01:28.147: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK I'LL KEEPTSHORT. COUNCILMEMBELUMM OUTLINED, I WILL BE OPPOSING THIS RESOLUTION AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
05:01:37.723: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:01:40.560: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANKS. I'LL BE BRIEF. I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I DON'T SEE A DECREASE FROM 10 TO 90% TO BE BANY MEANS LIKE DRASTIC DECREASE. THINK THAT THE CULTURE THAT WE HAVE CULTIVATED HERE IS REALLY AWESOME, AND WE HAVE ALL BEEN ONBOARDED IN THAT WAY, AND, YOU KNOW, MOST OF US ARE LEAVING COUNCIL AT THE END OF THIS TERM, AND A NEW COUNCIL WILL BE ONBOARDED WITH THE EXACT SAME CULTUR AND INTENSITY THAT MR. CRAWFORD GAVE TO ALL OF US. THIS NUMBER CAME FROM MR. CRAWFORD. THIS WASN'T MY PICKING AT 10%, AND ADDITIONALLY, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER AUDIT AFTER AUDIT OF AUDITOR SING DON'T COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S PERCENTAGE LIABILITY FUNDING, BECAUSE GOING FROM 100% TO 80%, THAT RANGE IS FAIRLY NOMINAL, AND IF WE CAN FREE UP TEN PLUS MILLION DOLLARS FOR A COUNCIL TO ONE DAY USE IN DIRE SITUATIONS, I THINK THAT'S WHEN DOLLARS CAN BE USED TO PUT BACK INTO THAT FUND.
05:03:10.016: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE THIS ALONG.
05:03:13.552: >> I JUST WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR NEED TO TAKE THIS UP AGAIN IN WE THE FUTURE IF IT DOESN'T PASS THIS EVENING, THAT THAT LEG WORK WILL HAVE BEEN DONE AND DONE, I THINK, IN A WAY THAT DEFINITELY HAD THE INTEREST OF OUR RESIDENTS AND MAINTAINING QUALITY SERVICES FOR THEM AT HEART AND WAS REALLY A VERY SELFLESS THING TO DO, BECAUSE WE WON'T BE GETTING DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO SPEND THAT MONEY, SO I THINK IT JUST DEMONSTRATES HOW YOU'VE TRIED TO SOLVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS DURING YOUR TIME ON COUNCIL AND HAVE WORKED WELL DECISIONSHAT - AYBE WORK ON
05:04:03.769: >> MAY TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE THIS --
05:04:08.140: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  TWO QUICK POINTS. I WILL JUST REMIND US ALL THAT WHEN WE REDUCE THE -- AS PART OF THE FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN, REDUCE THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE VIVA TRUST, MR. CRAWFORD DID SAY THAT THAT GAVE H HEARTBURN, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS A NECESSARY THING TO DO, AND THOSE WERE SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT HE DID SAY, THAT WAS A HARD RECOMMENDATION, AND I WILL JUST ALSO NOTE THAT IN TERMS OF THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 90 AND 100%, YES, IT WAS STATED TT IWOULD RETAINED IN TH RISK FUND, BUT THEN IT WAS CLARIFIED TO, QUOTE, "POSSIBLY BE " QUOTE "REBATED BACK TO THE CONTRIBUTING FUNDS TO ALLEVIATE FUTURE ECONOMIC NEEDS," WHATEVER THAT MEANS. AND YOU HEARD ME SPEAK AS TO, YOU KNOW, HOW THIS MONEY WOULD THEN BE UTILIZED THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO PAY DOWN THESE SO, THANKSOR LISTENING

05:06:57.343: >>OUNCILMEMBER GSWOLD:  THE GOOD NEWIS, THANKS TO COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION HAS ALREADY WEIGHED IN ON CHAPTER 40, AND MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO DISCOURAGE TURF GRASS AND TO ENCOURAGE NATIVE GRASSES AND RAIN GARDENS. THE ONLYSSUE WITH TURF GRASS THAT I SEE IS THAT WHEN PROPERTY GOES INTO FORECLOSURE BY BANKS, THEN SOMETIMES THE BANKS DON'T MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY, AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO ENFORCE THAT, BUT T REST OF THORDINANCE IS REALLY MORE ABOUT ENCOURAGEMENT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE MODIFY THE RESOLUTION TO STRIKE THE SECTIONS 16 AND 17 AND JUST BE GENERAL REGARDING CHAPTER 40, CAUSE THE DISCSION INCLUDE MORE TN JUST SECTION 1 AND SECTION 15 ALSO REFERS TO A HEIGHT NOT TO EXCEED 12 INCHES, AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I WILL TRY TO GET THIS BACK BY THE MEETING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION MEETING, SO TT MAY BE MOR THAN TWO WEEKS, BUT I'LL GET IT BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE, AND THIS IS JUST A FORMALITY, THAT CITY STAFF WANTED THIS TO COME BACK TO THE FULL COUNCIL THAT IT WOULD OFFICIALLY BE CONSIDERED AND WHILE WE DON'T USUALLY SION, FOLLOW THAT PROCESS, IT IS THE CORRECT PROCESS FOR COUNCIL TO REFER ISSUES TO COMMITTEES FOR CONSIDERATION. SO, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING FROM DISCSION?ONMENTAL COMMISSION THAT ALREADHAENED?
05:09:15.547: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  NO, NOT AT THIS TIME, BUT I WOULD REFER PEOPLE TO THE VIDEO. THERE WAS A LIVELY 20-MINUTE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE VEGETATION.
05:09:30.129: >> MAY TAYLOR:  COUNCILMBER GRWOLD -- I'M SORRY, RAMLAWI.
05:09:34.299: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR. YEAH, I'M A LITTLE BIT PERPLEXED, AS MY COLLEAGUE IS, AS TO THE KICKING THIS AROUND A LITTLE BIT TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND NOT ALLOWING COUNCIL TO VOTE ON IT. THAT BEINGSAID, ST REFERRING TO TURGRASS AND H PROPERTIES GO INTO FORECLOSURE AND PROPERTIES ARE UNKEPT, I DON'T SEE TOO MANY PROPERTIES IN ANN ARBOR FALLING INTO CATEGORY. THEY GENERALLY DON'T GO INTO FOR VERY LON IF EVER. ATURE I THINK IT -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A BIG CONCERN, IN MY OPINION. I WOULD JUST WANT TO KNOW, WHEN CAN WE GET THIS BACK TO COUNCIL AND VOTE ON IT, UP OR DOWN, AND NOT HAV IT SOLVED ANDUT INTO OTHER PARTS OFHE GOVERNMEN
05:10:42.634: >> I WOULD SAY THE FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER, AND IF YOU LOOK AT A2 FIX IT, SEE, CLICK, FIX, YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT, BUT THERE ARE ISSUES WITH TURF GRASS NOT BEING MAINTAINED AND FREQUENTLY, IT IS BECAUSE THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN FORECLOSED UPON, AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER FORECLOSED IT, USUALLY A BANK, IS MAINTAINING THE PROPERTY, BECAUSE THAT AFFECTS -- I DON'T WANT TO USE [ OFF MIC ] -- THAT DOES AFFECT THE APPEARANCE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
05:11:21.874: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION?
05:11:30.783: >> EXCUSE ME, I DID MENTION AMENDING THE RESOLUTION TO REMOVE THE SECTIONS, I CONSIDER THAT A FRIENDL AMENDMENT. IS THATOK?
05:11:42.194: >> IS THE A SECOND TO THAT, TO REMOVE THE REFERENCES TO 1617, SO THAT THE RESOLUTION REFERS THE ORDINANCE AND THE CHAPTER IN ITS ENTIRETY TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION? IS
05:11:56.909: >> UH-HUHNDLY TO THE BODY?
05:12:04.616: >> SURE.

05:14:35.968: >> YES, KATHY SECK, I LIVE IN BOARD ONE, I AM CALLING TO REQUEST IF WE CAN HAVE TAYTON STREET REMOVED.  I THINK WHILE YOUR COMMENT ABOUT CLOSING OF THE STREETS FOR THE RESTAURANTS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL, I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT, MYUSBAND A ITE SATURDAY -- FRIDAY, SATURDAY, AND SUNDAY ON WASHINGTON STREET.  IT WAS HOPPING. AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I WAS QUITE TAKEN BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKINGING ON THE SIDEWALK IN BOTH DIRECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY, AND ALSO WALKING PAST PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING AT TABLES WHO DIDN'T HAVE MASKS ON, BEUSE THEY WERE EATING. AND NOBODY SEEMED LIKE REALLY TOO WORRIED ABOUT THAT BRIEF MOMENT THEY WALKED PAST EACH OTHER. AND I MENTIONED THIS, WALKING ON THE SHAFEM STREET SITE WALK IS MUCH LESS CONGESTED THAN WASHINGTON STREET WAS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BETWEEN 5:00ND 7:00.  I HAVE SE AN EMAIL T MAYORAYLOR AND ALL OF THE COUNCIL COUNCIL PEOPLE ABOUT THE CONCERNS I HAVE ABOUT INCREASING THE CARBON FOOT PRINT AND WHEN YOU COME DOWN SPRING STREET, YOU CANNOT COME SOUTH ON FIRST, IT IS UNDER INSTRUCTION, AND MAIN STREET IS CLOSED,FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY, AND MONDAY. YOU GO FOUR BLOCKS EAST OUT OF THE WAY TO FOURTH OR TO 7TH TO BASICALLY GO ONE BLOCK ALONG CHAFEN.  AND IN THE EMAIL THAT I THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WITH ROM SEVERAL PEOE FROM THE CDC, IT WAS A PROLONGED CONTACT, 15 MINUTES OR MORE, ENCLOSED CONTACT IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE. AND WALKING DOWN THE STREET IN CHAFFEN IS NONE OF THESE.  AND I AM JUST ASKING, BECAUSE OF ALL THE CONSTRUCTION GOING ON AND THE DIFFICULTY TRYING T G SOUT AND TO DO IEFFIENTLY, IF THIS ONE STREET CAN BE REVED FROM THE HEALTHY INITIATIVE UNTIL SOME OF THE OPEN STREETS OPEN UP.  THANK YOU.
05:17:05.350: >> THANK YOU.
05:17:06.251: >> MAYOR, THAT'S THE ONLYALLER ON THE LINE.
05:17:13.525: >> THANK YOU.
05:17:13.925: >> SORRY, MAYOR.  I HAVE ONE MORE.
05:17:16.094: >> ALL RIGHT.
05:17:18.196: >> CALLER 439, DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
05:17:24.202: >> HEY, THERE.  CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME OKAY?
05:17:27.205: >> YES, WE CAN.
05:17:28.306: >> THIS IS HENRYMCNNELL, I'M CALLING IN REGARDING ONCE AGAIN THE ISSUE OF MASKS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND I APPLAUD YOU ALL, AFTER A LOT OF THESE CALLS, ABOUT PASSING MASK MANDATES. I AM SEEKING TO ALERT THE COUNCIL, THE MAYOR, AND THE COMMUNITY TO THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSI OF MICHIG APPEARS TO HAVE DISTRIBUTED EN MASSE A LARGE QUANTITY OF DEFECTIVE MASKS. THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS TWEETS FROM UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO HAVE APPLIED A SIMPLE TEST THAT ALL OF YOU CAN APPLY TO YOUR OWN MASKS, WHICH ISALLED THE MCH TEST.  YOU PUT IT IN FRONT OF YOUR MASK AND ATTEMPT TO EXTINGUISH A LIT MATCH.  IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY HEALTH EXPERTS AS REASONABLE.  THEY WERE ABLE TO EXTING WISH-WASHUISH IT. THERE WERE MANY MASKS THAT FAILED THE MATCH TEST, YOU CAN BLOW THROUGH THE MASK AND EXTINGUISH IT. SO THIS IS EMBLEMTIC OF MICHIGAN'S INDIFFERENCE, IT IS DISTILLED BY A BRILLIANT OP- ABOUT THE CORRUPTION OF A TRUMP MEGA DONOR AND A DONOR SAYING WE SHOULD REOPEN.  BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ZOOM IN AND URGE ACTION BE TAKEN TO RECALL THESE MASKAND DISTRIBU FUNCTIONAL ONES BECAUSE NOW, ONE OF THE ONLY MEASURES WE HAVE TO CURB THE SPREAD, THE MASK, FOR LACK OF VACCINES AND REAL TREATMENTS, EVEN THOSE MASKS THAT ARE IN USE THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY ARE EFFECTIVELY ALLOWING THE CONTINUEDPREAD OF THE VIRU FOR ANY USE WHORE INFECTED. I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S WITHIN OUR PURVIEW, GIVEN THIS NEW MASK ORDER, IN TERMS OF THE EFFICACY OF THE GIVEN MASK. BUT THESE MASKS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, AND THEY ARE ACTIVELY ENDANGERING BOTH THE WEARER AND THE GREATER COMMUNITY. SO IO CALL ON TS COUNCIL AND E MOR TO WORK WITH UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN DIRECTLY TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS, TO RECALL THESE MASKS, AND TO DISTRIBUTE EFFECTIVE MASKS SO THAT WE CAN REALLY LEAN ON THE ONLY TOOL WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO CURB THE SPREAD.  RECENTLY, IN ALABAMA, CASES DROPP BY HAL WHEN MASK MANDATE WAS ESTABLISHED.  WHEN YOU HAVE FUNCTIONAL MASKS, YOU CAN CURB SPREAD.  AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE DO NOT HAVE FUNCTIONAL MASKS. THANK YOU.
05:20:41.966: >> THANK YOU.
05:20:49.607: >> MAYOR, THERE ARE NO OTHER CALLERS ON THE LINE.
05:20:53.645: >> THANK YOU.  PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED.  ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNSEL?
05:21:05.890: >> COUNSEL MEMBER HAER.
05:21:08.126: >>THANKS, JT BRIEFLY. I'VE HAD SOME RESIDENTS ASKING ME ABOUT THE STREET CLOSINGS.  I DIDN'T SUPPORT THE ONES GOING ON DIVISION, NORTH DIVISION, THE BROADWAY BRIDGE AND SO ON.

IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE WAITING FOR CONSTRUCTION TO SHOW UP. THERE'S A MIX OF BARRELS AND CONES AND THINGS.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT IS GOING ON THERE.
