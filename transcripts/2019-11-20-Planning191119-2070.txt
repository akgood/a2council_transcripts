00:00:35.590: >> Chair Milshteyn: EXCELLENT. DO WE HAVE ANY INTRODUCTIONS THIS EVENING?
00:00:38.260: >> NOT THIS EVENING.
00:00:39.861: >> Chair Milshteyn: MOVE THE AGENDA. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE AGENDA. ALL IN FAVOR, AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] , IT IS APPROVED. WE HAVE THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEET, NOVEMBER 7th, 2019. MOVED AND SECONDED. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE MINUTES. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THEY ARE APPROVED. MOVING ON TO REPORTING FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES, WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE WILL BEGIN WITH OUR CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:01:21.636: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE UP LATE WATCHING THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING.
00:01:31.413: >> Chair Milshteyn: I WAS.
00:01:32.013: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  WE GOT OUT OF HERE AT 1:30 A.M. THIS MORNING. A NUMBER OF ITEM OF NOTES. AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTED ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION, CITY AND COUNCIL STAFF TO INVESTIGATE THE VIABILITY OF CONSTRUCTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON A NUMBER OF PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTIES. THAT REPORT CAME BACK TO CITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT, WITH A SET OF POTENTIAL RECOMMENDATIONS. CITY COUNCIL ACTED ON THOSE SEVEN RESOLUTIONS, ALL WITH AFFIRMATIVE VOTES. SO TO SUMMARIZE THE IMPACT, WE'LL SEE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT 121 CATHERINE, 404 AND 406 NORTH ASHLEY, WHICH ARE DOWNTOWN PROPERTIES. WE'LL CONTINUE THE EXPLORATION AND THE POTENTIAL ACTION THE 2000 SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. WE WILL BEGIN COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO DEVELOP NEXT STEPS AT THE KLEIN LOT, THE LARGE SERVICE PARKING LOT AT WILLIAM AND ASHLEY. 721 NORTH PLAIN AND PLATT ROAD. WE WILL EXPLORE CITY HOUSING OR CITY OFFICE SPACE AT 1510 EAST STADIUM WHICH IS THE RETIRED FIRE STATION NUMBER TWO. AND BE WE WILL BEGIN SIMILAR STY TO CONSTRUCT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT 353 SOUTH MAIN, WHICH IS THE SURFACE LOT NEXT TO PALIO RESTAURANT. IT'S LIKELY IT WILL BE AS VIABLE AS FIRST TWO MENTIONED AND LIKE LITH RECOMMENDATION WILL BE IMMEDIATELY BEGINNING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THAT SITE AS WELL. THIS BODY HAS DISCUSSED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS, CITY COUNCIL TOOK ACTION TO ACCEPT A CONSENT JUDGMENT, WHICH WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PUD THROUGH JUDICIAL ACTION. ON VIC VILLAGE SOUTH WHICH IS AT 1100 SOUTH UNIVERSITY, THE STUDENT HIGH-RISE, IT PASSED. IT WILL BE THE FIRST AND ONE OF THE LAST DEVELOPMENTS TO USE OUR OLD AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM, BEFORE WE TRANSITION TO THE NEW SET OF PREMIUMS WHICH ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN PURSUING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY DOWNTOWN. ALSO AS A NOTE THIS BODY REQUESTED THAT BETWEEN THE PLANNING COMMISSION TABLE AND THE CITY COUNCIL TABLE, THAT THE ARCHITECT EXPLORE KIND OF IMPROVING THE MAIN ENTRANCE AS IT STANDS DIRECTIONALLY ACROSS FROM THE WEST ENGINEERING ARCH, ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC SCENES IN ANN ARBOR, AND THEY MADE A BIG IMPROVEMENT. IT'S STILL MODEST IN COMPARISON TO THE WEST ENGINEERING ARCH, BUT IT DOES LOOK MUCH BETTER AND I THINK IT WILL SUIT THE CORNER VERY WELL. AND THEN FINALLY ON ANNEXATIONS AND REZONINGS, CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED THE REZONING THE VALLEY DRIVE, RIVERVIEW DRIVE AND ORCHARD HILLS DRIVE WHICH ARE NEW PARCELS OF CITY LAND ANNEXED FROM TOWNSHIPS. I THOUGHT AN INTERESTING ITEM HERE, WHICH I DON'T THINK WILL NEED PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION, BUT WANTED TO KEEP YOU APPRISE AS IT MAY AFFECT YOU. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER BROUGHT UP AN INTERESTING IDEA OF AS THESE NEW PROPERTIES ARE ANNEXED INTO THE CITY, STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS OFTEN WHATEVER THE SURROUNDING ZONING DISTRICT IS, WHICH IS TYPICALLY R1, BUT PERHAPS AS A WAY TO GET A SMALL AND INCREASING DENSITY IN SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS EXPLORE A DUPLEX ZONING, AS A MEANS TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE MIX OF HOUSING TYPES INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING AND I WILL HELP HIM EXPLORE. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE JUST A COUNCIL RESOLUTION, DIRECTING THE ADMINISTRATION, BUT THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE OF RELEVANCE AND INTEREST AS WELL. THAT IS EVERYTHING.
00:05:33.988: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. PLANNING MANAGER? MS. DIVIA?
00:05:38.393: >> THANK YOU. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SHARE A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND OPEN HOUSES COMING UP ON WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER TO. THAT'S TOMORROW, 5 TO 7 P.M. IN THE LOBBY OF CITY HALL, 301 EAST HURON. THERE'S A TRANSPORTATION PLANNING OPEN HOUSE. THE CITY IS HOLDING A MOVING TOGETHER TOWARDS VISION ZERO OPEN HOUSE.

00:08:10.878: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. THANK YOU. PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? SEEING NO ONE, WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE QUITE A BIT. SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. NOW WE MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO AN ITEM NOT ON OUR AGENDA. WE HAVE SEVERAL ITEMS ON THE AGENDA FOR THIS EVENING AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THOSE ITEMS. IF YOU ARE HERE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH REGARDS TO AN ITEM NOT ON THE AGENDA, THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY. PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND YOU WILL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SEEING NO ONE, WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR AGENDA. AND IT'S PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR  OUR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:08:58.426: >> THERE ARE TWO PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT WILL BE HELD NEXT BUSINESS MEETING, WHICH I BELIEVE IS TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3rd. THE FIRST IS THE MSGCU CREDIT UNION SITE PLAN REZONING AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO BUILD A NEW 3,800 SQUARE FOOT MICHIGAN SCHOOLS AND GOVERNMENT CREDIT UNION MSGCU BRANCH BUILDING WITH THREE DRIVE THRU LANES AND 21 PARKING SPACES ON 1.15-ACRE SITE, LOCATED AT 2151 WEST STADIUM BOULEVARD. THE WEST HALF IS TO REZONED TO C3 TO MATCH THE EAST HALF OF THE SITE. SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS REQUESTED FOR THE TWO DRIVE THRU TELLER LANES AND ONE DRIVE THRU ATM LANE. SECOND PUBLIC HEARING WILL BE OAKWOODS NATURE AREA, ADDITION REZONING. 3200 GREEN ROAD. REZONING A 25-ACRE ADDITION TO OAKWOODS NATURE AREA FROM R4A TO PL. THIS LAND WAS PART OF THE ADJACENT OWL CREEK DEVELOPMENT AND WAS ADDED TO THE NATURE AREA IN 2016.
00:10:09.964: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO UNFINISHED BUSINESS, THE FIRST ITEM THAT WE HAVE IS REZONING OF THREE NEW CITY PARKS AND ONE ADDITION TO HANSEN PARK FROM THE CURRENT ZONING DISTRICT DESIGNATIONS TO PUBLIC LAND DISTRICT TO CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. MS. DILLIA.
00:10:30.852: >> THANK YOU. GIVE ME FIVE SECONDS. THE COMMISSIONERS MAY RECALL -- THE COMMISSIONERS MAY CALL THAT WE PRESENTED FOUR PARK REZONINGS AT THE LAST MEETING, BUT WE HAD AN ERROR IN OUR PUBLIC NOTICE. SO WE ARE HOLDING T PUBLIC HEARING AGAIN. I WILL GO THROUGH THESE PARK REZONINGS A LITTLE MORE BRIEFLY. THE FIRST -- I KNOW HOW TO WORK A MOUTH. THE FIRST REZONING IS FOR BUTTON BUTTONBUSH NATURE AREA. THIS IS A NATURE AREA AT 2601 2601DHU VARREN ROAD. THIS WAS A PIECE ACQUIRED FROM THE ADJACENT DEVELOPER. AND FOR THE AUDIENCE, WHEN THE CITY PURCHASES LAND, IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY GET REZONED. REZONING MUST BE A LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT RECEIVES A PUBLIC HEARING AND ORDINANCE TO EDMONTON AMEND THE ZONING MAP. BUT THIS IS A 16 AREA NATURE AREA, PROPOSED TO BE REZONED FROM R4A TO PL. THE NEXT NATURE AREA IS HICKORY NATURE AREA, AT 2817 DILLON DRIVE. I BELIEVE THIS IS A TWO ACRE -- YES, IT'S A TWO ACRE NATURE AREA PROPOSED TO BE REZONED FROM R1D TO PL. THE THIRD IS 385 EAST EISENHOWER PARKWAY, IT'S ABOUT 1.5ISH ACRES PROPOSED TO BE REZONED FROM PUD TO PL AND THE FOURTH IS AN ADDITION TO HANSEN NATURE AREA, A COUPLE OF ACRES, A 1.5-ACRE ADDITION TO THE EXISTING HANSEN NATURE AREA, REZONED FROM R4A TO PL. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS WELL. STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROVAL.
00:12:27.301: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARD TO MATTER. YOU MAY STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE BUTTONBUSH NATURE AREA FROM R4A WITH CONDITIONS, MULTI FAMILY WELLING TO PL PUBLIC LAND. THE HICKORY NATURE AREA REZONING FROM R1D, TO PL. THE 385 EAST EISENHOWER PARKWAY PARK REZONING FROM PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT TO PUBLIC LANDS, AND THE HANSEN NATURE AREA ADDITION REZONING FROM R4B MULTIPLE FAMILY DWELLING TO PL. DO I HAVE A COMMISSION TO MOVE? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, AND COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. AND WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:13:32.066: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THE LAST TIME THIS WAS BROUGHT UP THIS WE HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU? TERMS OF CRITERIA FOR, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU ALL LOOK FOR, CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH ANY OF THESE. I WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SHARE BASED ON OUR DISCUSSION LAST TIME.
00:13:51.252: >> I DO. AND I FORGOT THAT I DO. I FOLLOWED UP WITH THE REMARKS AND RECREATION STAFF, AS WELL AS THE LAND ACQUISITION COORDINATOR, AND THE GREEN BELT PROGRAM MANAGER, HIS NAME IS REMY LONG, HE SAID THAT THE OPEN SPACE IN PARKLAND RESERVATION MILLAGE FUNDS, THE ACQUISITION OF NEW PARKLAND WITHIN THE CITY, THE MILLAGE DOES NOT PROVIDE PROVIDE FUNDS FOR PARKLAND MAINTENANCE OR IMPROVE. IN SOME CASES, THERE'S AN OUTRIGHT DONATION OF LANDS. BUTTONBUSH AND HICKORY ADDITION ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE CITY AND DEVELOPERS TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT OPEN SPACE AS PART OF THE CITY SITE PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS. AND MOST CASES THE LAND IS BEING OFFERED THROUGHOUT OUTRIGHT DONATION, BUT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY FACTOR AT PLAY, WHEN EVALUATING THESE PARKLAND DONATIONS, FOR ALL PROSPECTIVE PARKLAND SITUATIONS, WE EVALUATE THE PROPERTY, WITH A SCORING SYSTEM USING THE PROS PLAN, IT EVALUATES EACH PROPERTY'S COSTS AND BENEFITS, BOTH ECOLOGICAL AND FINANCIAL. AFTER THE STAFF EVALUATION, IT'S REVIEWED BY THE PARKS ADVISORY COMMISSION, PAC LAND ACQUISITION COMMITTEE, LAC. AND LAC MAKES A RECOMMENDATION AS TO WHETHER THE STAFF SHOULD PROCEED, AND THEY MAY MAKE A RECOMMENDATION FOR CITY COUNCIL'S RECOMMENDATION. THE BUTTONBUSH AND HICKORY, AND HANSEN WERE REVIEWED BY LAC. SOME HAVE HABITAT CONNECTIVITY, LOW OPERATIONAL AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT COSTS, IMPROVING ACCESS TO EXISTING PARKLAND AND SUPPORTING GOALS IDENTIFIED IN THE CITY'S SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK. AS TO WHY THOSE PARCELS HAPPEN TO BE NEAR HIGHWAYS, WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT THIS IS MERELY A COINCIDENCE, AND NOT A STRATEGIC EFFORT DRIVEN BY STAFF OR LAC. IT MAY BE THAT MA OF THE DEVELOPABLE SITES THAT REMAIN WITHIN THE CITY ARE LOCATED NEAR HIGHWAYS AND THAT'S THE CITY'S OFTEN SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATING PARKLAND DONATION AS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT SITE PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS.
00:16:04.185: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL RIGHT ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. MOVING ON TO REGULAR BUSINESS AND THE FIRST ITEM IS 3611-3621 PLYMOUTH ROAD REZONING, SITE PLAN WITH PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, DRIVE THRU FACILITIES. WE HAVE THE APPLICATION AND AFTER WHICH, WE WILL HEAD ON TO A STAFF REPORT, AND THEN A PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION AND A VOTE.
00:17:28.168: >> SORRY, TECHNOLOGY ISSUE. TO MOVE FORWARD? LEFT CLICK. GOT IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS TIM BUTLER BEING I'M WITH P.E.A., I'M A CIVIL ENGINEER.
00:17:46.987: >> AND I'M GERRARD MARCUS, I'M WITH THE ENTITY THAT OWNS THE PARCEL IN QUESTION.
00:17:57.665: >> AS WE MENTIONED, MY NAME IS, AGAIN, JIM BUTLER WITH THE CIVIL ENGINEER AND THE LANDSCAPE, ALSO WITH US IS OUR PROJECT ARCHITECT, THERE ARE TWO OF THEM, NOR FROM DETROIT AND DETROIT ARCHITECTURAL GROUP FROM WYANDOT. THE SITE IN QUESTION IS LOCATED AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF U.S. 23 AND PLYMOUTH ROAD. THE SITE IS CURRENTLY ZONED PUD. THAT PUD FROM OUR RECORDS GOES BACK TO 1973. I THINK 1 1978 WAS THE LAST AMENDMENT. IT'S 1.5 BIG BOY'S, WHICH IS CLOSED AND A RED ROOF INN. WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS PHASED. PHASED ONE IS A 4,355 SQUARE FOOT PANERA BREAD THAT WILL HAVE A DRIVE THRU. WITH THAT WILL BE A HOTEL, A NATIONALLY BRANDED HOTEL, WHICH HAS 27 ROOMS. PHASE TWO OF THIS, WHICH IS -- WILL BE -- IF I FOLLOW MY CURSOR, THIS BUILDING RIGHT HERE. THIS WILL REMAIN RED ROOF INN AS PHASE ONE. AND PHASE TWO, WE WILL COME BACK FOR A REDEVELOPMENT OF THAT, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS RESIDENTIAL. THE REQUESTS -- WE HAVE THREE REQUESTS THIS EVENING. ONE IS FOR A REZONING OF THE PROPERTY FROM PUD, TO A C3 USE. THE SECOND REQUEST IS FOR A PLANNED PROJECT FOR THIS, THE CURRENT BUILDING HEIGHT IS IN THE C3 DISTRICT, IS CURRENT AT 55 FEET AND FOUR STORIES. WE ARE REQUESTING A SIX-STORY BUILDING, AND WITH A HEIGHT OF 65 FEET, 10 INCHES. THAT'S THE TOP OF THE ROOF THERE'S AN ELEVATOR SHAFT THAT GOES TO THE TOP, AND SO IT'S ABOUT 76 FEET. AND THEN FINALLY, ELIMINATING -- THERE'S A 25-FOOT SETBACK MAXIMUM REQUIREMENT. WE WOULD -- WE WOULD ASK FOR THAT TO BE WAVED. AND THEN FINALLY, THE EXCEPTION, THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR THE DRIVE THRU FOR THE PANERA. IN YOUR ORDINANCE, IF THE C3 DISTRICT, THERE'S NOTATIONS RELATED TO ITS DEFINITION. THE DISTRICT IS AINT INTENDED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN TYPES OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC -- THAT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON IN. THIS DISTRICT, THE CUSTOMER USUALLY COMES DIRECTLY TO THE PARTICULAR ESTABLISHMENT, BY AUTOMOBILE, MAKING A SEPARATE STOP AT EACH -- EACH ERRAND, THE COMPARISON SHOPPING IS LESS THAN A DOWNTOWN AREA. ESSENTIALLY, THIS IS IDEAL FOR THIS PARTICULAR ZONING AND WE BELIEVE IT'S A GOOD USE FOR THIS AREA. THE SECOND REQUEST IS THE PLANNED PROJECT. IN YOUR ORDINANCE, AND IN PARTICULAR SECTION 5.31B, THERE ARE NINE SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS THAT WE CAN PROPOSE. AND FOR THIS PROJECT, WE ARE PROPOSING TO HAVE OPEN SPACE AT APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE SITE. AND THEN UNDER ITEM NUMBER 5, WE'RE GOING TO INSTALL SOLAR PANEL ARRAY ON THE TOP OF THE HOTEL. AND THEN FINALLY THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION, THEIR CRITERIA WITHIN YOUR ORDINANCE RELATED TO SECTION 5.295B, WE ARE ADDING A DRIVE THRU. WE WORKED WITH STAFF. WE HAD A COUPLE OF SUBMITTALS ON THIS PROJECT. THE DRIVE THRU DID COULD CIRCUITOUS AROUND THE BUILDING, AFTER SOME DISCUSSIONS AND MODIFICATIONS, AND SOME MORE DISCUSSIONS, WE ENDED UP MODIFYING OUR BUILDING TO HAVE JUST A DRIVE THRU ON THE EAST AND THE NORTH SIDE OF THE BUILDING. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE HAD A BETTER DESIGN, WE FEEL. SO SO WE RECEIVED THE REVISED STAFF REPORT LAST NIGHT, ABOUT 4:00. INITIALLY THERE WAS ONE ISSUED THAT WAS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL. THIS ONE IS RECOMMENDING POSTPONEMENT. I TOOK THE AFTERNOON TO GO THROUGH THE COMMENTS FROM THE ENGINEERING AND THE FORESTRY DEPARTMENT. ITEMS IN THERE ARE MINOR IN NATURE. THEY ARE ITEMS, I THINK WE CAN ADDRESS RATHER QUICKLY. I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CONFIGURATION OF THE SITE PLAN. IT WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING THAT'S GERMANE TO THE CONFIGURATION OF THE SITE PLAN. I THINK WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE QUICKLY AND WOULD RECOMMEND AND ASK THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND THIS AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL, THAT WE WOULD ADDRESS THESE ITEMS SO WE CAN PUSH THIS PROJECT FORWARD.
00:22:49.590: >> JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS. I KNOW THERE WAS AN APPROVAL FIRST AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER REPORT THAT SAYS CONDITION -- OR THAT SAYS POSTPONE. I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE THINGS WERE, I MEAN, KIND OF NOT SO CRITICAL TO A SITE PLAN REVIEW THERE. WAS CALLING THOUGHT OF CERTAIN TREES WHICH WE CAN OBVIOUSLY DO DURING THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION PHASE WITH ENGINEERING. I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO TO CALL OUT SOME EASEMENTS ON THE SITE PLAN. I BELIEVE THEY WERE PROBABLY CALLED OUT; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:23:15.949: >> THERE ARE EASEMENTS.
00:23:16.783: >> THEY ARE CALLED OUT ON THE SITE PLAN AND WE CAN PROVIDE THEM AT A DATE AND TIME WHEN WE COME TO THE BOARD AND WORK IT OUT WITH STAFF IN TERMS OF AN INTERNAL ENGINEERING ASPECT. I BELIEVE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MINOR ISSUES THERE.
00:23:31.298: >> IT'S IN THE LETTER.
00:23:32.466: >> SORRY, EXCUSE US. I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW THE POINT THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN BE ADDRESSED READILY BEING WITHOUT COMING BACK HERE. I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY, BUT OBVIOUSLY, YOU FO FOLKS HOLD THE FINAL DECISION. YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL, GETTING US TO THIS POINT AND I THINK THESE ARE JUST LITTLE BUMPS THAT WE CAN GO READILY THROUGH.
00:23:53.554: >> DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. ARCHITECTS ARE HERE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BUILDING.
00:24:00.761: >> Chair Milshteyn: I'M SURE WE WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AS WE GET AT THE DISCUSSION. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO LED TO MS. DILEO FOR THE STAFF REPORT.
00:24:21.381: >> COULD YOU GIVE ME BACK THE MOUSE. THANK YOU, COMMISSIONERS. I FEEL THE APPLICANT DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF PRESENTING THE PROJECT. I CAN HIT SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS AND IN OUR STAFF REVIEW, THEY VERY WELL EXPLAINED THAT THERE ARE THREE COMPONENTS TO THIS APPLICATION. THERE'S -- OR THREE APPLICATIONS AS PART OF THIS PROJECT, A REZONING, A SITE PLAN WITH PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE DRIVE THRU FACILITY. SO YOU WILL SEE THERE ARE THREE SEPARATE MOTIONS IN THE STAFF REPORT. THE REZONING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY MASTER PLAN. IT CHECKS OFF THE BOXES FOR STANDARDS OF APPROVAL. IT'S ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE SURROUNDING ZONING. THE PREVIOUS PART OF THE PUD HAS ALREADY BEEN REZONED FROM PUD TO C3, AND IT'S CONTIGUOUS WITH THE OTHER C3 DISTRICTS. IT WAS ONE -- IT WAS -- THE BOLDEST PUD, IT WAS AMONG OUR FIRST, AND IT'S MORE LIKE AN APPROVED SITE PLAN. THERE ARE NO OTHER USES AND NO OTHER CONFIGURATION THAT PERMITTED WITHIN THIS PUD DISTRICT. I THINK IF YOU STEP WAY BACK IN TIME, RESTAURANTS AND HOTELS DID NOT USE TO BE ALLOWED TO MIX, AND IF YOU ALSO STEP BACK IN TIME, THE PLYMOUTH ROAD CORRIDOR WAS NOT LIKE IT WAS TODAY. THEY WERE ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR NONRESIDENTIAL, NONFARM USES. THAT ERA HAS COME AND GONE. FOR THESE SITE PLAN APPLICATION, THE -- THE -- OOPS. SORRY. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH AND DONE OUR STAFF REVIEW REGARDING THE SETBACKS. THE C3 DISTRICT DOES REQUIRE A MINIMUM FRONT OF 10 FEET AND A MAXIMUM FRONT OF 25 FEET. THE NEW HOTEL BUILDING IS NOT WITHIN 25 FEET OF THE FRONT LOT LINE. IT IS PROPOSED ON THE OLD FOOTPRINT OF THE HOTEL. BUT IT DOES NEED A PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION TO KEEP IT IN THAT LOCATION AS A NEW BUILDING. A SIDE NOTE, BUT REGARDING THE HIGHWAY FRONTAGE THIS SITE PLAN APPLICATION IS AMONG THE FIRST TO BE CONSIDERED SINCE WE ADOPTED AN ORDINANCE TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF A FRONT LOT LINE. THE LOT LINE ADJACENT TO A HIGHWAY IS NO LONGER A FRONT. SO THIS PROJECT HAS ONE TINY FRONT ON PLYMOUTH ROAD, AND THEN SIDES AND REARS. EVEN AS A SIDE, ALSO EVEN IF THE HIGHWAY WAS A FRONT, THE PROPOSED HOTEL STILL IS NOT WITHIN 25 FEET OF THE FRONT. REGARDING THE HEIGHT, I HAVE IT IN THE STAFF REPORT, SIX STORIES AND 76 FEET. THERE MAY BE A MISCOMMUNICATION THAT THE BILLING HEIGHT MAY BE 65, BUT MAXIMUM HEIGHT WOULD STILL BE CONSIDERED 76 FEET. THEY ARE REQUESTED PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS FOR THAT. THERE ARE NINE LANDMARK TREES ON THE SITE, FOUR PROPOSED TO BE REMOVED AND THERE'S A MITIGATION PROPOSED. WE HAVE NOTED THAT IT MEETS ALL THE APPLICABLE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW STANDARDS EXCEPT WHERE NOTED WITH THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS. AND REGARDING THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, DRIVE THRU WINDOWS -- NOT THE RESTAURANT ITSELF, BUT THE DRIVE THRU REQUIRES SPECIAL EXCEPTION APPROVAL. WE DID WORK WITH THE PETITIONER TO IMPROVE THE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLINESS OF IT, AND THE RESTAURANT IS NO LONGER SURROUNDED -- PROPOSED TO BE SURROUNDED 360 DEGREES WITH THE DRIVE THRU. SO WE DID -- WE DID WORK ON THAT. WITH REGARDING THE REZONING AND THE SITE PLAN, THOSE ARE PRETTY MUCH READY TO GO, BUT WE HAVE RECOMMENDED POSTPONING TO MATCH THE SITE PLAN RECOMMENDATION, AND IT IS STAFF'S POLICY TO ALWAYS RECOMMEND POSTPONING UNTIL THE SITE PLAN IS 100% APPROVABLE. AND AS ALWAYS, I CAN ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT AS WELL.
00:28:48.949: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ISSUE. IF SO, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES.
00:29:02.362: >> AARON McLEOD, PLUM MARKET. I'M ON PLYMOUTH ROAD. YES, WE JUST WANTED TO GET ON THE RECORD SEVERAL CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH REGARD NO TRAFFIC WITH INGRESS AND EGRESS. AS YOU KNOW, THE EASEMENT TO GREEN ROAD CAN HAVE MANY CHALLENGES, GETTING IN AND OUT, ESPECIALLY AT PARTICULAR RUSH HOUR TIMES OF DAY, WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPERTY, OUR NEIGHBORS, WOULD, YOU KNOW, HAVING INCREASES IN BUSINESS AND SO FORTH. SO WE WANTED TO STATE OUR CONCERN THERE. PERHAPS THE NEED OF CONSIDERATION FOR A -- A TRAFFIC LIGHT AT THAT POSITION, IF THAT'S SOMETHING FOR CONSIDERATION. ABSENT OF THAT, IT MIGHT CREATE THE NEED FOR GUESTS TO THEN TRY TO EXIT ON TO PLYMOUTH ROAD AND THAT'S EVEN MORE DANGEROUS. SO OUR CONCERNS SURELY FROM A SAFETY POINT OF VIEW AND WANTED TO LOOK AT WHAT R OPTIONS THIS WOULD BE TO IMPROVE THAT WITH THE ADDED TRAFFIC. AND THEN SECONDLY, IT WOULD BE WITH REGARD TO THE -- THE EASEMENT ITSELF, WITH ADDED USE AND MORE WEAR AND TEAR, BOTH WITH CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO LONG TERM WITH ADDED TRAFFIC. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD ABSOLUTELY DISCUSS WITH THE DEVELOPER BUT WANTED TO HAVE THAT ON RECORD TODAY.
00:30:23.343: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:30:24.444: >> THAT'S IT.
00:30:27.781: >> Chair Milshteyn: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. AND WE HAVE THREE MOTIONS WITHOUT OBJECTION, I WILL READ THEM ALL THREE TOGETHER AND WE'LL CONSIDER THEM TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT? MORE, NEBUCHADNEZZAR ONE. ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVED THE MMG MIXED USEROM PUD TO C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL, MOTION NUMBER TWO, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE MMG AND THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT TO 65 FEET 10 INCHES AND ELIMINATE THE MAXIMUM FRONT SETBACK REQUIREMENT FOR NEW BUILDING, SUBJECT TO PROVIDING SOLAR ORIENTATION AND ENERGY CONSERVING DESIGN BY USING SOLAR PANEL ARRAY ON THE ROOF OF THE NEW BUILDING AND MAINTAINING A MINIMUM OF 30% OPEN SPACE. AND MOTION NUMBER THREE, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE REQUEST FOR A DRIVE THRU FACILITY 3611 PLYMOUTH ROAD. DO I HAVE A MOTION? MOVED AND SECONDED BY HAMMERSCHMIDT. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:31:51.498: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: JUST TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN OF THE GENTLEMAN FROM PLUM MARKET, WAS THERE A TRAFFIC STUDY THAT WAS DONE FOR THIS PROJECT?
00:31:59.873: >> YES.
00:32:02.609: >> Chair Milshteyn: IFU. STEP UP TO THE PODIUM. -- IF YOU CAN STEP UP TO THE PODIUM.
00:32:07.147: >> YES, A TRAFFIC STUDY WAS DONE BY BERGMAN AND ASSOCIATED. IT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE CITY AND IT WAS REVIEWED BY THE CITY'S TRAFFIC ENGINEER.
00:32:15.588: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND THERE WAS NO FUZZY CASE AS TO WHETHER TO GO ONE WAY OR THE NUMBER?
00:32:22.195: >> IT DIDN'T MEET THE WARRANTS ACCORDING TO THE STUDY.
00:32:25.865: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. WHILE YOU ARE UP HERE AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION BOTH FOR STAFF, AS WELL AS THE PETITIONER. WITH OUR CRITERIA FOR PROVIDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SOLAR ARRAY AND ALL OF THAT SORT OF THING, IS THERE ANY SORT OF STANDARD AS TO HOW MUCH SOLAR IS REQUIRED? YOU KNOW, HOW MANY PANELS DOES IT TAKE TO KIND OF QUALIFY IN TERMS OF THAT? AND I JUST SAW IN YOUR PRESENTATION, JUST KIND OF A GENERIC PHOTO. DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF LAYOUT THAT SHOWS, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOU COVERING? LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU -- YOU KNOW, IS IT THE HAMPTON INN AND THE PANERA? LIKE, WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU PUTTING ON HERE?
00:33:09.676: >> IT'S SOLELY FOR THE HOTEL. IT'S BEYOND THE ROOF OF THE HOTEL, TO COVER THAT LIMIT.
00:33:14.814: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: DOES IT COVER THE WHOLE ROOF OF THE HOTEL?
00:33:18.952: >> THAT'S INTENT.
00:33:19.385: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN?
00:33:21.988: >> WE HAVEN'T DESIGNED IT YET.
00:33:25.091: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY THE ENERGY NEEDS IT WOULD MEET. LIKE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ENERGY NEED IT'S WOULD MEET?
00:33:32.632: >> I DO NOT. IT'S NOT IN MY AREA OF. PERT EXPERTISE, SORRY.
00:33:39.906: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WITH THE MORE RECENT CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL OF ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY IN 2030, OBVIOUSLY NOT FOR THIS PETITION, IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE WHAT IS MEANINGFUL. WE ARE TRYING TO KNOCK THIS BACK IN A MEAN MEANINGFUL WAY. I THINK MY CONCERN OVER TIME IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TOKEN STUFF THAT GOES ON, PUT A FEW THINGS HERE AND THIS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT AND I THINK WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR MEANINGFUL CHANGE WITH THIS. AND, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN BLACK AND WHITE, I DON'T THINK, ALEXIS UNLESS YOU LET ME KNOW OTHERWISE. I GUESS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO, YOU KNOW -- WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING HERE THAT TELLS US WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE. SO IS THERE ANY KIND OF WAY THAT WE CAN CRAFT SOMETHING SO THAT -- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TWO PANELS, RIGHT? I MEAN, BECAUSE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SAY ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT, WELL -- I MEAN, I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT ARE OUR TOOLS? WHAT TOOLS DO WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO MAKE THIS SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE HAD THAT OTHER PLANNED PROJECT ON WASHINGTON, WE SAW THEIR SOLAR ARRAY AS PART OF THEIR PETITION. AND SO WE GOT TO JUDGE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT -- AND THEY ACTUALLY KNEW HOW MUCH ENERGY IT WAS GOING TO BE SAVING THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IN TERMS OF HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHETHER THIS IS MEANINGFUL OR NOT. AND HAVING TO PLAN MAKES ME A LITTLE -- LIKE WORK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE JUDGING THIS ON WHETHER IT'S A PLANNED PROJECT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS. I DON'T KNOW THAT OPEN SPACE IS THAT MEANINGFUL FOR US OUT HERE, REALLY. REALLY, REALLY, YOU KNOW FOR ME PERSONALLY ANYWAY. BUT THE SOLAR PIECE IS MEANINGFUL TO ME. I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME TO CRAFT AN EXPECTATION THAT MEETS -- YOU KNOW, MEETS OUR GOALS FOR REAL. YOU KNOW? I MEAN, WHAT ARE OUR POSSIBILITIES HERE?
00:35:46.266: >> I CAN DEFER DEFINITELY ADDRES PART. I WOULD SAIL KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PLANNED PROJECT STANDARDS WERE WRITTEN, I THINK BEFORE SOLAR PANELS WERE REALLY IN USE. THE EXACT WORDING IS SOLAR ORIENTATION FOR AN ENERGY-CONSERVING DESIGN. AT THE TIME IT WAS WRITTEN, THEY WERE REALLY ENVISIONING REORIENT THE BUILDING, YOU KNOW, MONTH OF IT MAYBE FROM THE WEST SIDE OR THE EAST SIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THEREFORE, INCREASE, DECREASE THAT BACK AND SET YOURSELF UP FOR A SOLAR ORIENTATION. WE HAVE NOW BROADENED APPLIED -- WE APPLIED WHAT IS NOW CAPABLE, WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS OUT THERE TO THAT ORIGINAL LANGUAGE. SO THERE IS NO STANDARD. NOW IT VERY CLEARLY SAYS THE PLANNING COMMISSION CAN SUGGEST AND CAN CONDITION THEIR APPROVAL ON INCLUDING CERTAIN MINIMUMS. OFF THE CUFF, I WOULD SAY PERHAPS IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR INCINCLUDING A CERTAIN SQUARE FOOTAGE OF SOLAR PANELS OR A PERCENTAGE. WE WOULD NEED THE APPLICANT'S HELP ON GETTING THAT PERCENTAGE NUMBER, MAYBE WE COULD FIGURE OUT A SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE ROOF AREA RIGHT NOW ON THE FLOOR. MOVING FORWARD, MAYBE WE NEED TO GET MORE EXHIBITTENT BASELINES BUT FOR -- CONSISTENT BASELINES BUT FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT, YOU ARE WELL WITHIN YOUR ENTITLEMENT TO CONDITION YOUR SUPPORT OF THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS.
00:37:27.867: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S CLEARANCE ISSUES. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT SWECK SAY THAT WHAT'S THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE ROOF. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE TECHNICAL STANDARD THAT WE WOULD NEED TO USE FOR THIS TO MAKE IT MEANINGFUL. I GUESS I WOULD PUT IT OUT THERE TO MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY IDEAS OR TO THE PETITIONER IF YOU HAVE THINGS THAT YOU COULD AGREE TO OR TO COMMIT TO?
00:37:59.265: >> YES, WE ARE IN FAVOR OF GREEN AND EVERYTHING, TO GET TO CARBONNEUTRAL. WE ARE IN THE DESIGN PROCESS FOR WHAT THE HVAC SYSTEM LOOKS FOLLOW THIS HOTEL AND WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON THE ROOF IN THAT SITUATION. I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO MAXIMIZE THAT EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THAT ROOF TO BE SOLAR. IT BENEFITS US. SO IF ANYONE IS STANDING IN MY SHOES DOESN'T WANT TO MAXIMIZE THAT, THEY ARE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. EVEN FROM A YEAR AGO, WHEN WE DID ANOTHER PROJECT, IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD IN SOLAR PANELS. WE WANT TO USE EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THAT SPACE TO USE SOLAR PANELS. THE TECHNOLOGY KEEPS EVOLVING. IT WILL EVOLVE THIS THREE MONTHS. THERE'S ANOTHER SET OF SOLAR PANELS THAT ABSORB MORE. IT'S STILL EVOLVING. I DON'T THINK I CAN GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TODAY THAT MAY NOT CHANGE IN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS WHEN WE FINALLY BUILD THIS THING, BUT WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND PRESENT THE PLANS. YOU HAVE THE ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL MAX OUT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE ROOF. BUT IT BEHOOVES US TO USE EVERY SQUARE INCH OF IT. IT'S MARK  MARKET DRIVE ENTHAT E SOLAR PANELS.
00:39:22.048: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:39:24.650: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANKS AND THIS IS FOLLOWING UP DIRECTLY ON THAT. I THINK -- I'M NOT SURE WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE STANDS, BUT IF OUR TYPICAL UPRE APPROACH AIS TO FOLLOW STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION. I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE NUMBER FOR THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT SOLIDIFIED, AND IN MY MIND, I THINK DOING IT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE ROOF AREA MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I AGREE YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE. YES, THE COST OF SOLAR PANELS HAS COME DOWN A LOT! LIKE SIGNIFICANT IN THE LAST YEAR EVEN. SO IT DOES MAKE SENSE. IT ALSO, THOUGH, BECAUSE IN I IS -- YOUR APPROVAL IS TIED TO WHAT WE SEE. SO I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE TO HAVE A METRIC. THE PICTURE THAT YOU HAVE DRAWN, AGAIN, IN THE SITE PLAN LOOKS TO ME AT LEAST 50% OF THE ROOF AREA, BUT I'M -- I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GO AND GET THAT RIGHT NUMBER. AND SO WHEN WE SEE THAT AGAIN, IT GIVES ME CONFIDENCE THAT YOU ARE MEETING THIS THAT. GENERALLY SPEAKING IN TERMS OF OUR PLANNED PROJECTS, WHAT -- WHAT QUALIFIES FOR PLANNED PROJECTS, THIS IS ONE THAT'S REALLY MUSHY AND HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN MUSHY. AND SOMETIMES WE ALLOWED BEING SOLAR READY. LIKE, THIS IS WHERE WE ARE MOVING, AND I THINK THIS THAT IS FANTASTIC, AND I JUST WANT TO IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION TO CODIFY IT, BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A REASON TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL HEIGHT. THERE'S THE ADDITIONAL HEIGHT AND THE ADDITIONAL SETBACK. AND SO I THINK LIKE COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, I SHARE THE IDEA THAT THE OPEN SPACE -- IT'S GOOD THAT IT'S ABOVE -- YOU KNOW, THAT THERE'S MORE OPEN SPACE THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED AND I THINK THAT THAT, IN SOME WAYS, JUSTIFIES THE ADDITIONAL HEIGHT, BECAUSE OF THE -- IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE MAXING OUT F.A.R. ALREADY. I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE CONCENTRATED AND THEY COULDO THAT AND BE WITHIN THE HEIGHT. I SUPPORT THAT GENERALLY, BUT BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO -- WE LIKE TO HAVE THINGS BY ROAD SO THAT, YOU KNOW, PEDESTRIANS CAN COME AND WALK UP TO THE PANERA BREAD. I THINK THAT -- I -- I THINK THAT THIS SOLAR BENEFITS ARE GREAT FOR THOSE KIND OF THINGS MATCH UP THERE. AND SO I -- LIKE I SAID, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BETTER QUANTIFY THAT.
00:42:25.698: >> MAY I JUST --
00:42:27.333: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEP.
00:42:28.000: >> THE SOLAR PANELS ARE GOING TO BE WHAT THE SOLAR PANELS ARE GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY. THE ORDINANCE, I KNOW IT SAYS YOU MUST HAVE SO MUCH SQUARE FOOTAGE, AND IT'S MUSHY. SO IT'S GOING TO BE WHATEVER THE DESIGN OF THE ROOF TOP IS AFTER YOU PUT ALL OF YOUR ROOF TOP UNITS AND ALL THE OTHER UTILITIES ON THERE. SO WHAT I PRESENT TO YOU TODAY MAY CHANGE IN THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS AND YOU MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN BECAUSE THE SOLAR TECHNOLOGY IS DIFFERENT. I CAN PRESENT A PLAN TO YOU TODAY THAT MAY -- I MAY COME BACK AND SAY WE WANT TO CHANGE IT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE EFFICIENCIES OR BETTER PRODUCT OUT ELECTRIC. DOES THAT MEAN I COME BACK TO YOU FOLKS AGAIN? I THINK IT'S A BETTER SITUATION TO WORK WITH THE STAFF TO SAY, HERE'S THE ROOF TOP AND THE SOLAR PANEL. I GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU WANT TO SEE IT TODAY, BUT WHAT YOU SEE TODAY IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THREE, OR FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW.
00:43:19.318: >> I UNDERSTAND THAT. MY -- MY UNDERSTANDING OF SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES IS THAT THE PANELS THEMSELVES ARE CHANGINGEE SUPPORTS AND HOW THEY ARE ATTACHED TO THE IS -- IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ARE SHAPED, THAT WON'T CHANGE. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU NEED TO SORT OUT WITH YOUR HVAC EQUIPMENT IS GOING TO GO. I THINK THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN US -- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT PAGE THIS IS IN THE SITE PLAN, YOU HAVE SHOWN US A PLAN THAT HAS QUITE A FEW SOLAR PANELS F. AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU END UP DECIDING TO GO HAVE SOME KIND OF, I DON'T KNOW, CATWALK -- WHATEVER YOU WOULD PUT ON A ROOF. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT WOULD BE ON A HOTEL ROOF AND IT ENDS UP BEING A SMALL CORNER OF THE ROOF, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO -- YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S NOTHING PINNING YOU DOWN TO WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE, I THINK IT'S -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE --
00:44:15.875: >> UNDERSTAND.
00:44:16.242: >> Vice Chair Mills: IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY THAT. YOU CAN SAY, I'M S I'M SHOWING % IS COVERED AND CAN WE WRITE 50% INTO THAT? I THINK IT GI GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY. I THINK PUTTING DOWN SOME SQUARE FOOTAGE WOULD BE WISE, JUST BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THINGS CHANGE, BUT WE -- WANT TO HAVE THE EXPECTATION THAT WE ARE PUTTING FOR.
00:44:49.975: >> BUT IF MY ROOF ONLY SPORTS THE 25% COVERAGE AND THERE'S NO ORDINANCE FOR ME TO MEET. IF AFTER THE DESIGN OF THE HOTEL TO GET THE MOST EFFICIENT BUILD, I ONLY HAVE A 25% COVERAGE AREA, IS STAFF GOING TO SAY, YOU ONLY DID 25%. IS STAFF COMING BACK AT ME? I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WILL LAND DEPENDING ON THE DESIGN OF THE HOTEL. UNLESS YOU SAY COME BACK WITH THE FULL DESIGN AND SHOW IT TO ME 100%, I DON'T THINK THAT'S --
00:45:19.839: >> BECAUSE YOU ARE ASKING FOR A -- BECAUSE YOU ARE ASKING FOR A PLANNED PROJECT.
00:45:29.615: >> RIGHT.
00:45:30.049: >> Vice Chair Mills: NOT ASKING FOR A PLANNED PROJECT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY OF THIS. IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT RIGHT NOW. I GET THAT. AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SHOW US SOMETHING THAT SHOWS 50% PERCENTAGE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ONLY 25%. SO THIS IS WHERE I'M SAYING YOU GAVE US A RENDERING. LET'S JUST PUT A NUMBER TO THAT, LIKE HOW MUCH OF THAT IS COVERED AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK IT WOULD BE. THAT'S WHERE I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S HELPFUL. THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD, BUT I WELCOME OTHER COMMISSIONERS' PERSPECTIVES ON THAT, IF OTHERS DISAGREE WITH ME, OR A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT. I THINK QUANTIFYING, NAME PLATE CAPACITY, WHICH IS THE WAY YOU NORMALLY THINK OF SOLAR PANELS IS WAY WONKIER. AND AS A PERCENTAGE ENERGY USE OF THE BUILDING, I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A DIRECTION THAT WE NECESSARILY WANT NO MOVE IN. I HAVE THINK, YOU KNOW, MAXIMIZING THAT ROOF TO -- TO BE SOLAR -- TO ACCESS THE SOLAR RESOURCES THERE, I THINK IS THE GOAL. THAT'S THE INTENT BEHIND THE PLANNED PROJECT. THE QUESTION I HAD -- FIRST OF ALL, I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DESIGNING OF THE QUEUING OR THE DRIVE THRU, BECAUSE THAT'S THE THIRD PART OF THIS THING THAT WE ARE BEING ASKED TO CONSIDER, THE THIRD ELEMENT THAT WE ARE ASKED TO C. I'M ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE ARE CUING TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE BUILDING, AND THEN DRIVING AROUND AND PICKING THEIR THINGS UP ON THE EAST SIDE.
00:47:12.851: >> NO. NO. WE ARE PICKING UP ON THE NORTH SIDE.
00:47:18.891: >> Vice Chair Mills: THEY ARE PICKING UP FROM THE NORTH SIDE.
00:47:22.161: >> THE DRIVE THRU IS HIDDEN FROM THE STREET. IT'S NOT KNOT WHE NOT THE TYPICE THRU. IN THIS SITUATION, YOU DO SEE THE RIGHT HAND WHERE THE QUEUE IS AND YOU PICK UP AT THE WINDOW AND DRIVE OFF.
00:47:37.977: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO YOU ARE ORDERING ON THE EAST SIDE. I HONESTLY, EVERY TIME I HAVE GONE TO PANERA, I HAVE GONE INSIDE.
00:47:43.482: >> YOU ORDER AT THE EAST SIDE, ALMOST AS FAR -- JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE NORTH, LIKE HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BUILDING.
00:47:49.088: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO RIGHT NOW IN THE -- WELL, ACTUALLY, WHAT'S UP ON MONITORS, THERE ARE LIKE THREE CARS SHOWN ON THE EAST SIDE. ROUGHLY IS IT T MIDDLE ONE THAT IS AT THE PLACE THAT YOU WOULD ORDER?
00:48:02.601: >> THE ORDER LINE IS RIGHT THERE.
00:48:05.237: >>> PROBABLY THE SECOND CAR.
00:48:06.739: >> Vice Chair Mills: THE SECOND CAR IN. SO THIS IS -- MY QUESTION IS MORE, WHERE ARE THEY QUEUING? BECAUSE THERE'S OFTEN MORE THAN TWO CARS AHEAD OF YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M ORDERING THING FROM OTHER DRIVE THRUS. I'M CURIOUS. MAYBE I NEED TO GET ON MY SITE PLAN AND GET A BETTER.
00:48:33.565: >> I ABOUT THE TIME YOU GET TO THE SECOND CAR, THERE ARE FIVE CARS AHEAD OF YOU.
00:48:39.471: >> Vice Chair Mills: BEFORE I GET FIRST WINDOW, I AM I'M WONDR HOW MUCH SPACE THERE IS AND IN RELATION TIP SHIP TO THE PARKIN. EVEN BEFORE YOU ORDER --
00:48:50.382: >> SO THERE'S STILL ROOM ON THAT SITE PLAN, YOU CAN SEE, YOU CAN PROBABLY FIT TWO OR THREE MORE CARS BEFORE THE PATIO ENDS. WE DIDN'T SHOW IT PURPOSEFULLY. PANERA GETS THEM IN AND OUT LESS THAN A MINUTE AND A HALF TOTAL.
00:49:05.764: >> OKAY.
00:49:06.031: >> BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM THERE IN TERMS OF -- THERE'S AT LEAST TWO MORE CARS THAT YOU CAN STACK THERE.
00:49:11.470: >> AND THERE'S TWO MORE CAR LENGTHS.
00:49:13.505: >> I THINK IT'S 25-FOOT SPACES; IS THAT RIGHT?
00:49:17.109: >> THIS IS 10 BY 20s.
00:49:19.912: >> SO REALISTICALLY 10 BY 20s IS VERY GENEROUS.
00:49:25.484: >> Vice Chair Mills: I WOULD JUST -- PERHAPS -- THIS IS NOT -- I LIKE THIS. I THI IT IS GREAT THAT IT'S BEHIND THE BILLING BEINGIVELY, AND BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS. I THINK THAT THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- A -- AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THIS. YOU MIGHT JUST THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE GOING TO NEED SIGNAGE AT SOME POINT ABOUT -- OR STRIPING ON THE ROAD, JUST TO SUGGEST THAT RATHER THAN QUEUING BETWEEN THAT LINE THAT'S -- THE LINE OF PARKING THAT'S RIGHT ALONG THE SOUTH FACE OF THE BUILDING, THAT IT'S MOSH THAT -- I GUESS YOU WOULD WANT THEM ON THAT ACCESS ROAD. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WOULD QUEUE. I THINK YOU MIGHT NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT, POTENTIALLY. AND THAT'S MORE OF AN OPERATIONAL THING, ONCE YOU SEE IF THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM, BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE IF THEY ARE QUEUING THERE, IN THE MIDDLE OF WHERE THE PRIME PARKING IS, I -- THAT COULD PRESENT A SAFETY ISSUE WHICH IS WHY WE WORRY ABOUT DRIVE THRU PARKING -- OR DRIVE THRUS GENERALLY. WHAT IS THE INTERACTION AND THE EXPERIENCE WITH PEDESTRIANS.
00:50:40.092: >> SURE. UNDERSTAND.
00:50:41.026: >> Vice Chair Mills: I THINK GENERALLY, THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE ZONING DISTRICT. I WAS -- WHEN THEY PROVIDED THE COMPARISON CHART OF THE OTHER C DISTRICTS. THERE'S SOME C1 IN THAT AREA, AND THERE WAS ANNLIMITED HEIGHT. I WAS CURIOUS WHY C3 INSTEAD OF C1? C1A?
00:51:21.633: >> C1 DOES NOT HAVE UNLIMITED HEIGHT, NOR DOES C1B, BUT C1A AND C1A/R HAVE AN UNLIMITED HEIGHT.
00:51:35.480: >> Vice Chair Mills: IS THERE ANY C1A OR C1A/R, IN THAT ERR A?
00:51:46.992: >> NO.
00:51:47.793: >> Vice Chair Mills: OH, I THOUGHT THIS WAS A C1 OR C1B.
00:51:51.997: >> I CAN TOGGLE BACK. IT'S ALSO IN YOUR PACKET.
00:51:56.268: >> Vice Chair Mills: THAT WAS MY ONLY QUESTION, IF THERE -- BECAUSE IT'S -- THERE'S A LOT OF C IN THAT AREA. THERE WE GO. AND IT'S C1, AND C1B. I DIDN'T CATCH THAT ON THE THING. THAT MAKES SENSE THEN THAT THOSE HAVE SIMILAR HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS.
00:52:17.122: >> YEAH.
00:52:17.422: >> Vice Chair Mills: BECAUSE IT'S ADJACENT TO C3, I SUPPORT THAT AND I THINK, AGAIN, THE -- GETTING THE QUANTIFYING EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE SEE ON THE SOLAR, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE -- THE BENEFITS GIVEN THROUGH -- THROUGH THE PLANNED PROJECTS, THOSE MAKING UP FOR THE ADDITIONAL HEIGHT AND SETBACKS.
00:52:54.159: >> Chair Milshteyn: MISSIONER
00:52:58.130: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:52:59.431: >> Commissioner Briggs: THIS DEVELOPMENT SORT OF ANYPLACE U.S.A. DEVELOPMENT. I'M CURIOUS WHY WE WOULDN'T MAINTAIN THE PUD AS THE ZONING AND ASK FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT THERE.
00:53:13.612: >> Commissioner Briggs: ESPECIAL LY IN LIGHT OF OUR RECENT -- THIS WAS IN THE PIPELINE FOR A WHILE. WITH COUNCIL'S RESOLUTION, LAST WEEK TO BE -- YOU KNOW, CLIMATE NEUTRAL BY 2030, THAT REQUIRES TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE BY OUR COMMUNITY AND TRANSFORMING TO A C3, WHICH IS AN AUTO ORIENTED USE SEEMS LIKE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF OUR COMMUNITY GOALS AT THIS POINT. SO THERE IS, OBVIOUSLY, SOME SOLAR ON HERE, BUT IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR TO WHAT BENEFIT THAT'S GOING TO ADD TO THE PROJECT, IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ENERGY IT'S PRODUCING. AND THE DEVELOPER IS UNABLE TO EVEN TELL US, YOU KNOW -- COMMIT TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN JUST SOLAR ON TOP OF THEIR ROOF AT THIS POINT AND SOME OPEN SPACE. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO MAINTAIN PUD THERE.
00:54:03.161: >> I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE DEVELOPER REQUESTED THE C3. KEEPING THE EXISTING PUD, IT'S -- IT HAS ZERO FLEXIBILITY AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC BENEFIT IN THE CURRENT FORM, OTHER THAN MIXED HOTEL AND RESTAURANT USE, WHICH THAT TIME HAS COME. WE HAVE MOVED ON FROM THAT. YES, THERE'S A PROCEDURE AND A PROCESS TO UPDATE THE PUD TO MAKE IT A MORE MODERN ONE WITH SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. AND THAT CAN BE EXPLORED AND PURSUED, BUT IT WOULD MEAN DENYING THEIR REZONING REQUEST AND THEN THEY WOULD NEED TO PETITION FOR AN UPDATED PUD, ALTERNATIVELY, IT IS IN THE UDC WHERE THE PLANNING COMMISSION OR THE COUNCIL CAN INITIATE A REZONING. BUT SOMEONE WOULD NEED TO DO THAT LEG WORK OF ESTABLISHING THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS.
00:55:08.994: >> Commissioner Briggs: BUT WE COULD MAINTAIN THAT ZONING, AND POTENTIALLY GET A GREATER BENEFIT IN THAT AREA TO MAINTAIN THE ZONING? I'M JUST ASKING. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD TYPICALLY DO.
00:55:25.677: >> IT NEEDS TO BE REZONED FROM THE BOLGUS PUD TO A DIFFERENT PUD, THOUGH.
00:55:35.587: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING. I UNDERSTAND THAT -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT --
00:55:41.426: >> THE MASTER PLAN SAID -- CALLED FOR C3. THAT'S WHY WE JUMPED INTO  IT. THE MASTER PLAN CALLS FOR THE C3.
00:55:50.936: >> Commissioner Briggs: THE MASTER PLAN SAYS A LOT OF THINGS, COMPETING GOALS BUT I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM. AND THEN ON A MORE MINOR NOTE THAN THAT, IN TERMS THE DRIVE THRU, WHICH IS EYE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, I'M CURIOUS WHY -- A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, I'M CURIOUS WHY WE PERMIT DRIVE THRUS WITH ALL THE IDLING.
00:56:12.891: >> WELL, WE DID MAKE -- WE DID MAKE DRIVE THRUS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, WE MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION. IT WAS NOT COMMUNITY CONSENSUS TO PROHIBIT THEM, BUT THEY ARE -- THEY HAVE BEEN MADE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IN ANY INSTANCE. AND IF THE PROPOSED DRIVE THRU AND THE LOCATION AND THE CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT DON'T MEET THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES STANDARDS, THEN IT -- IT NEED NOT BE APPROVED.
00:56:47.325: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. YEAH, I'M NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN SEEING ONE MORE DRIVE THRU IN OUR COMMUNITY. I WILL LET OTHERS WEIGH IN ON WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT MY THOUGHTS AROUND THE PUD.
00:57:04.776: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
00:57:05.911: >> Commissioner Sauve: I HAVE A QUESTION PROCEDURALLY FOR PHASE TWO. DOES THIS COME BACK BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LOOKING TELL BUILDING? OR WHAT ARE -- HOW DOES THAT COME INTO PLAY?
00:57:17.489: >> TONIGHT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'M HEARING ABOUT PHASING. THE SITE PLAN IS VALID FOR THREE YEARS, FROM THE TIME OF APPROVAL. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEIR DEFINITION OF PHASING IS COMPARED TO WHAT THE CODE PHASING IS. SITE PLANS ARE VALID FOR THREE YEARS. SO THEY WOULD HAVE THREE YEARS FROM WHEN THEY FIRST PULLED A PERMIT TO THEN PULL PERMITS FOR THE HOTEL THEY -- THERE IS AN EXTENSION PROCESS AS WELL. OR WE CAN DO AN AMENDMENT TO THE SITE PLAN TO ADD PHASE LINES. SO IT DEPENDS ON THEIR DEFINITION OF PHASING, IF THEY JUST MEAN THERE WILL BE A REASON KNOW VACATION FIRST AND THEN THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY START WITH THE HOTEL WITHIN THAT THREE-YEAR VALID WINDOW, THAT'S ONE THING. IF THEY THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE PHASING OF A PROJECT, THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER AND I WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS WITH THEM, WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY THAT?
00:58:14.145: >> I CAN SPEAK TO THAT. SO THE RED ROOF BUILDING THAT SITS HORIZONTAL TO THE ROAD, WE DON'T KNOW QUITE YET WHAT WE WILL DO THERE. WE KNOW WE WILL DO SOMETHING THERE IN THE FUTURE. OUR FIRST INCLINATION WAS TO LAUNCH THIS PROJECT, THE RESTAURANT AND THE RED ROOF THAT SITS PERPENDICULAR TO THE ROAD, GET THOSE OFF THE GROUND OR GET THEM APPROVED, AND GET STARTED, KIND OF SEE WHERE THE CHIPS LIE AND SEE WHAT THE DEMAND IS AND COME BACK TO YOU FOLKS FOR ANOTHER PLAN WITH THE BILLING THAT S SITS HORIZONTAL TO THE ROAD. WE DO HAVE SOME WHYS OF MAYBE SOME RETAIL AND RESIDENTIAL. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WILL BE ANOTHER DEMAND FOR ANOTHER HOTEL. IT'S UP IN THE AIR.
00:58:58.089: >> WITH THAT RESPONSE, THEY NEED TO COME BACK WITH ANOTHER SITE PLAN. IT'S NOT CONSIDERED -- WE WOULD NOT CONSIDER IT PHASED. THEY WOULD NEED TO COME BACK WITH A NEW SITE PLAN TO SHOW SOME CHANGE. NOTHING WITH THE PROPOSED SITE PLAN INCLUDES ANY WORK, OTHER THAN PERHAPS INTERNAL REMODELING, BUT NOTHING ABOUT THIS SITE PLAN INCLUDES ANY DEMOLITION ORIEL STRUCTING OF THE OTHER BUILDING.
00:59:26.551: >> Commissioner Sauve: STORMWAT. YOU ARE ALSO AWARE THAT IF YOU DEMOLISH AND REBUILD THAT BUILDING IT COULD TRIGGER DIFFERENT COMMENTS. THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT SANITARY SEWER AND PLUMBING CALCULATIONS AND THOSE MIGHT MODIFY, BASED ON THE USE OF THAT BUILDING IN THE FUTURE.
00:59:50.141: >> REGARDING THE STORMWATER. SITE IS BEING MASTER PLANNED FOR THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT FOR STORMWATER, THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE STORMWATERS. THE BUILDING ENVELOPE IS THE BUILDING ENVELOPE. BECAUSE WE ARE REDOING THE PARKING LOT AND --
01:00:05.724: >> BUT THERE'S SANITARY SEWER CONCERNS IN THE STAFF COMMENTS AS WELL.
01:00:11.262: >>> WE DID TALK WITH THE CITY AND NEAR THIS AFTERNOON AND WE ARE PREPARING CALCULATIONS. THERE WAS STILL A LITTLE BIT OF MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE BUILDING. WE ARE PREPARING THEM FOR THEM TO SHOW THE PROPER OFFSETS AND MITIGATION.
01:00:26.978: >> Commissioner Sauve: BUT THE PHASE TWO BUILDING, IF YOU ARE WORKING ON FULL MASTER PLANS, PLANNING FOR STORMWATER AND SEWAGE AND THE SEWAGE CALCULATIONS CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE INTENSEY OF USE WITHIN THE BUILDING, ONCE YOU REBUILD THE BUILDING, WHAT MIGHT THAT TRIGGER FOR THE ENTIRE SITE?
01:00:41.259: >> SHE'S SAYING WHEN YOU BUILD THAT --
01:00:43.061: >> RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT WILL NOT AFFECT THE STORMWATER. SANITARY SEWER --
01:00:49.901: >> Commissioner Sauve: IT COULD BE AFFECTED. I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THAT BUILDING IS NOT PROPOSED FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN, BUT WE THINK ABOUT EVEN JUST SOLAR ROOFS, IT'S STILL A ROOF WITH SOUTHERN ORIENTATION AND VERY EASY ONE TO STILL PUT SOLAR PANELS ON, NOT JUST THE HOTEL.
01:01:06.551: >> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE --
01:01:11.956: >> Commissioner Sauve: THE RED ROOF INN SOLAR --
01:01:16.127: >> I'M ALL FOR IT. I DON'T HAVE A ZONING -- SOMETHING THAT I CAN BITE MY NEATH IT. THE ZONING SAYS YOU MUST HAVE THIS MUCH. IT'S NOT CLEAR. IF IT WAS CLEAR, TO SAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS MUCH SOLAR PANELING, I WOULD HAVE THAT.
01:01:31.209: >> Commissioner Sauve: I HAVE THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PLANNED PROJECT TO MAKE SURE IT MEETS A CERTAIN LEVEL TO QUALIFY FOR A PLANNED PROJECT. THAT'S WHAT THIS BODY HAS THE ABILITY TO DO AND EVAL WIT. I'M LEANING TOWARDS POSTPONEMENT SO YOU CAN TIP AND YOU ARE GETTING FEEDBACK TODAY THAT SAYS WE WANT CLARIFY AND AND WORK WITH STAFF TO GET CLARITY WHEN YOU COME BACK HERE.
01:01:54.432: >> I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.
01:01:58.636: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THERE ARE OTHER ROUTES TO ACHIEVE HIGHER GOALS AND SUSTAINABILITY, RENEWABLE ENERGY CREATION ON SITE.
01:02:04.042: >> JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT REPURPOSING THE ROOF ON THE RED ROOF. THAT'S GOING TO GO STAY AT THIS POINT, ARE YOU?
01:02:11.583: >> Commissioner Sauve: NEW YORK NO, I'MSAYING IT COULD BE IS UPR DISCUSSION. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HVAC, YOUR FOOTPRINT FOR HVAC ON THE ROOF IS VERY MINIMAL. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE IN-ROOM UNITS. WE HAVE HAD SEEN PROJECTS THAT FLIP FROM IN-ROOM UNITS TO ROOF TOP UNITS. YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THE MEDICALLAL SYSTEMS YET. THE WORST CASE IS THAT YOU TO ROOF TOP UNITS AND WE ARE DOWN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE ON THAT --
01:02:45.216: >> THE PTAC UNITS ARE MUCH WORSE IN TERMS OF UNITS THAN THE HVAC UNITS ON THE ROOF. IF YOU PUT THE INDIVIDUAL UNITS IN THE ROOM, THAT'S SO MUCH MORE ENERGY USE THAN JUST PUTTING THE HVAC UNITS --
01:03:03.868: >> Commissioner Sauve: THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SQUARE FOOTAGE ON YOUR ROOF TO SERVICE ALL OF THOSE ROOMS.
01:03:10.975: >> YOU ARE CORRECT. WE HAVEN'T FULLY DESIGNED THAT AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET TO. WE ARE STILL DESIGNING THE HVAC UNITS IN THIS HOTEL AND HOWL THE FUNCTIONALITY WILL WORK. WE MAY COME BACK AND BASED ON WHERE THE HVAC COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHY I SAY THE SOLAR PANELS ARE GOING TO BE WHAT THE SOLAR PANELS ARE GOING TO BE.
01:03:31.729: >> Commissioner Sauve: THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT DETAIL, THE TYPE OF THE MECHANICS AND ROOF TOP, IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT THE POSTPONEMENT, I THINK IS WHERE I'M LEANING TO, TO MAKE SURE THOSE THINGS GET IRONED OUT. THAT'S SOMETHING I -- ISN'T -- ISN'T -- IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M COMFORTABLE WITH STAFF HANDLING BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH LARGE VARIABLES IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF EQUIPMENT AND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE.
01:04:02.060: >> I AGREE. IT'S GOOD TO SEE.
01:04:07.865: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:04:09.434: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THANK YOU. I TEND TO AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS ABOUT SOLAR. MAYBE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE DRIVE THRU. I THINK ONE QUESTION IS:  WHY YOU ARE NOT PUTTING SOLAR ON THE RESTAURANT.
01:04:27.051: >> WE ARE REPURPOSING THAT ROOF, WE CAN CAN --
01:04:34.625: >> Commissioner Abrons: THERE'S PROBABLY MECHANICAL REQUIREMENT OR THAT.
01:04:38.830: >> WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
01:04:40.732: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YOU SHOWED A SLIDE WITH NINE POINTS. I WAS WONDER IF THERE WERE NINE THINGS AND YOU WERE MEETING TWO OF THEM OR ALL NINE ARE THINGS WHICH YOU ARE MEETING.
01:04:52.110: >> THIS IS JUST A REDACTION FROM YOUR ORDINANCE. WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS. ALL NINE. OF THOSE TWO, SOLAR ORIENTATION AND THE GREEN SPACE.
01:05:06.090: >> Commissioner Abrons:  SO OF THESE NINE, YOU ARE PROVIDING FIVE AND ONE.
01:05:08.893: >> I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE SUBJECTIVE.
01:05:12.330: >> YES, BUT FIVE AND ONE ARE THE TARGET POINTS.
01:05:15.333: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I MEAN YOU ARE NOT PRESERVING NATURAL FEATURES IN EXCESS OF THE REQUIREMENT. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY NO HISTORICAL FEATURES ON THE SITE TO RETAIN. AND THEN IN TERMS OF -- WELL, MAYBE JUST TO CLARIFY THIS' NO REQUIREMENT FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT, WITH THE PLANNED PROJECT IS THAT WHAT I HEARD?
01:05:35.453: >> THESE ARE THE THINGS.
01:05:36.687: >> THE PLANNED PROJECT, THEY ARE PREDEFINED.
01:05:40.691: >> Commissioner Abrons:  SO YOU GET FOR NO CREDIT FOR THE ITEMS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LIST.
01:05:45.963: >> YOU NEED TO PROVIDE ONE. YOU DON'T NEED TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE, YOU CAN, BUT THE PUD IS OPEN ENDED PUBLIC BENEFIT, BUT A PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION IS A PREDEFINED PUBLIC BENEFIT. ONE OF THESE NINE. SOME ARE NOT APPLICABLE, LIKE NUMBER NINE, YOU HAVE TO BE IN A D1 OR D2 DESTRUCTION TOWN. THE NUMBER FIVE, IS SOLAR ORIENTATION. I BELIEVE IT LITERALLY MEANS.
01:06:18.463: >> Commissioner Abrons: FACING SOUTH.
01:06:20.298: >> YES, BUT NOW WE HAVE BROADENED OUR INTERPRETATION OF IT, AND SO SOME OF THEM CAN BE INTERPRETED BROADER AND -- MORE BROADLY, AND LESS. THERE'S IN THE MUCH ROOM FOR INTERPRETING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, FOR EXAMPLE BUT, KNOW, THESE ARE THE -- YOU MUST IMMEDIATE ONE OF THESE PREDETERMINED BENEFITS.
01:06:44.822: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YOU MENTIONED AN OPEN SPACE PERCENTAGE. PARKING COUNTS AS OPEN SPACE?
01:06:51.662: >> NO, IT DOES NOT.
01:06:52.363: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YOU MENTIONED 30% OPEN SPACE ON THAT.
01:06:56.467: >> WE CAN PROVIDE THE CALCULATION.
01:06:58.436: >> Commissioner Abrons:  CAN YOU JUST PULL UP THE SITE PLAN ON YOUR SLIDE SHOW. IS THAT PART OF IT --
01:07:03.674: >> I'M CONTROLLING IT. I CAN GIVE IT BACK TO YOU.
01:07:08.012: >> Commissioner Abrons: THANKS. I'M HAVING A VERY HARD TIME FINDING ANY OPEN SPACE. THAT'S 30%? ALL THE WAY AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE PERIMETER OF THE BUILDING, THERE'S AREA AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER BY GREEN ROAD. THERE'S A SERIES OF GREEN SPACE AND OPEN SPACED AREAS. THE BLACK AND WHITE REALLY DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE. I CAN CERTAINLY SHOW YOU THAT CALCULATION.
01:07:32.303: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF PARKING. OKAY. I MEAN, I GUESS WHAT I'M REALINGLY ASKING -- I MEAN, THE KIND OF GIVE AND TAKE IS THAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR LIKE A 20-FOOT HEIGHT INCREASE IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME UNKNOWN AMOUNT OF SOLAR PANELS. THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. THERE'S NO OTHER OFFER -- OFFER OF EXCHANGE BENEFIT?
01:07:56.460: >> I HEAR THE SOLAR PANEL ISSUE LOUD AND CLEAR.
01:07:59.630: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I -- I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THERE ARE NOT OTHER MAYBE P THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OR THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT BEYOND THE SOLAR.
01:08:12.777: >> I'M KIND OF LIMITED TO WHERE WE ARE AT.
01:08:17.215: >> BECAUSE THEY ARE PREDEFINED. ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT DID COME UP AS PART OF OUR DESIGN AND THE DISCUSSION OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, RIGHT NOW, WE ARE ADDING A WALKWAY ON THE ENTIRE FRONTAGE OF OUR DEVELOP. CURRENTLY THERE IS NONE. PLUM MARKET'S WALKWAY, THEY DUMP OUT IN THE ROADWAY. WE ARE PUTTING A WALKWAY ON THE ENTIRE RING.
01:08:39.303: >> Commissioner Abrons: MM-HMM.
01:08:40.338: >> IT'S NOT A DEFINED NUMBER WITHIN OUR MODIFICATION FOR PLANNED PROJECT BUT --
01:08:46.777: >> Commissioner Abrons:  NO, BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT MATTER TO THIS BODY. I'M DONE. THANKS.
01:08:55.720: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:08:56.921: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT SOLAR PANELS. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:09:07.031: >> ABSOLUTELY.
01:09:07.398: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S MY SENSE THAT MOST DEVELOPMENTS LOOKING TO USE SOLAR PANELS AS PART OF THEIR PLANNED PROJECT ARGUMENT HAVE THE DETAILS A LITTLE BIT MORE IRONED OUT BEFORE WE VOTE ON THEM. SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SEE THAT. I THINK ALSO IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO RESPECT STAFF'S POLICY OF RECOMMENDING POSTPONEMENT AND POSTPONING ITEMS THAT ARE NOT FULLY READY FOR APPROVAL. I WILL MOVE THAT SHORTLY. ALSO, THE SMALL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES, AS WAS MENTIONED DOES FEEL AS THOUGH IT CLUES CHEWS UP MORE OPEN SPACE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANOTHER RECONFIGURATION CAN BE DONE TO HAVE MORE. I SIMILARLY HESITATE AROUND DRIVE THRUS. IT SE SEEMS CO SE SEEMS COUNTERR OBJECTIVE AS A COMMUNITY. SO I GUESS ECHOING THOSE SENTIMENTS AND HOPEFULLY THAT PROVIDES SOME INSIGHT AND GUIDANCE AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. SO WITH THAT, I WILL MOVE TO POSTPONE TO A DATE TO BE DETERMINED BY STAFF UNLESS THERE'S MORE. ON OFFERED.
01:10:22.340: >> Chair Milshteyn: THERE'S A COUPLE MORE COMMENTS. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND HOLDING THAT UP FOR JUST A SECOND.
01:10:27.378: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  OF COURSE.
01:10:33.718: >> Chair Milshteyn: MISSIONER BRIGGS. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:10:35.986: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THIS IS MY IGNORANCE ON C3, CAN
01:10:40.825: >>  DEBBIAL --BIAL. RESIDENTIAL.
01:10:45.062: >> YES, C3 ALLOWS ALL BROAD CATEGORIES, RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL.
01:10:51.168: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: AND ARE YOU DOING TEAR DOWNS AND REBUILD. THE.
01:10:54.271: >> THE RED ROOF WILL GET TORN DOWN, THE ONE THAT'S PER PEN PERPENDICULAR. THE BIG BOY, A WALL WILL COME TO DOWN TO RECONFIGURE.
01:11:06.150: >> Commissioner Hammersc AND THEN THE HORIZONTAL BUILDING WILL BE TO BE DOWN AS WELL.
01:11:10.554: >> YES. HAMS HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION OF BUILDS ON THE SITE?
01:11:15.793: >> WELL, WE -- WE WANTED TO PRESERVE THE BIG BOY BUILDING, AND THEN BUILD AROUND IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU BUILD ANOTHER HOTEL AT THIS POINT, EXCEPT IN THE FOOTPRINT OF THE RED ROOF.
01:11:34.812: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IS THAT EXISTING HORIZONTAL BUILDING GOING TO REMAIN OPEN?
01:11:40.584: >> YES. TO BE HONEST, WE HAVE MAY COME BACK FOR SIX MONTHS, AND SAY THANK YOU OR NOT APPROVING OUR INITIAL SITE PLAN REQUEST, AND WE MAY COME BACK WITH A PLAN TO SAY, WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER FOR YOU YET. I REALLY DON'T. IT'S KIND OF -- IT'S KIND OF ECONOMICS AT THIS POINT. I MEAN, THIS IS A BIG PROJECT.
01:12:06.977: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I'M EXCITED SOMETHING IS HANDING ALONG HERE.
01:12:12.383: >> THERE IS A DEEP SANITARY SEWER. IT'S LIKE 20-FOOT DEPTH. WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EASEMENT. WE CONDITION PUSH IT CLOSER TO THE FREEWAY AND OBVIOUSLY THEDOD CONFIGURATION.
01:12:31.469: >> I WAS WONDER IF WE COULD DO IT WITHOUT SO MUCH PARKING AND CONCRETE. SO IF IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE KIND OF THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. I GUESS I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE, LIKE, FLY REDUCTION IN CONCRETE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON REPLACING, IT BUT REPLACING IT WITH SOMETHING THAT'S MORE PERVIOUS. I SEE HEAT IN THE SUMMER AND IF THERE WERE ANY PLANS TO DO SOMETHING. LIKE THE OPEN SPACE IS GREAT. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S JUST SORT OF WHAT IS THERE AND NOT ANYMORE AND IT LOOKS INCREDIBLY PASSIVE. I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS BUT MAYBE THINKING THROUGH IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD DO WITH THAT OPEN SPACE. WE WILL DEVIL KNITLY LOOK AT IT.
01:13:12.176: >> THERE -- WE WILL DEFINITELY LOOK AT IT.
01:13:13.811: >> THERE IS LANDSCAPING.
01:13:15.346: >> I THINK FOR RECREATION. YOU SAID YOU HAVE A WALKWAY AROUND?
01:13:18.649: >> NO, WE HAVE A WALKWAY ALONG THE ROO RING ROAD THAT GOES IN. WE ADDED THAT WALK WAY.
01:13:24.221: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ALL RIGHT.
01:13:25.389: >> AND CONNECTED IT TO ALL THE BUILDINGS. SO IT IS WALK WAIBEL.
01:13:29.159: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: JUST A THOUGHT, LIKE, IF YOU PROMOTED THAT LIKE A WALKING TRAIL AND PUTTING SIGNAGE ON IT, LIKE IF YOU LOOP IT THREE TIMES, YOU WALK A MILE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S IT.
01:13:43.474: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:13:44.942: >> Commissioner Briggs: WHAT SAN RAFAEL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR C3 IN TERMS OF PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIVITY WITHIN A PROJECT? IS IT --
01:13:53.150: >> THERE ARE NO OUTRIGHT STANDARDS FOR CONNECTIVITY, EXCEPT ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOK FOR AS A GENERAL PLANNING PRACTICE IS THAT THERE IS A -- A WAY FOR BEDS TO TRAVEL TO GET TO ALL OF THE THINGS ON THE SITE.
01:14:08.599: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO IN TERMS OF THE WALKWAY THAT'S BEING PUT IN, THAT'S SORT OF SOMETHING THAT STAFF WOULD HAVE ADVOCATED FOR REGARDLESS MOVING FORWARD ON THE PROJECT?
01:14:21.478: >> IF THEY DID NOT PROPOSE IT, WE WOULD HAVE RECOMMENDED IT. THIS IS NOT A PRIVATE -- A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE STREET. THIS IS BASICALLY A DRIVEWAY AND A PARKING LOT. SO WE WOULD BE MORE LIMITED IN REQUIREMENTS. IF IT WAS A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE STREET, IT WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT.
01:14:36.660: >> Commissioner Briggs: GOT IT.
01:14:37.795: >> SO IN POINT OF FACT, THE SIDEWALK IS NOT REQUIRED. WE WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR IT, BUT IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT.
01:14:46.170: >> SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE IN OUR CODE IN TERMS OF WHAT IS REQUIRED, IN TERMS OF CONNECTIVITY WITHIN A --
01:14:52.209: >> YEAH, IT IS NOT A CODE REQUIREMENT. I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING IT, BUT IT IS NOT IN BLACK AND WHITE.
01:14:58.349: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. THANKS.
01:15:00.784: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:15:09.326: >> Vice Chair Mills: JUST BECAUSE COMMISSIONER BRIGGS WONDERED HOW OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT HER CHALLENGING WHETHER ANOTHER PUD BELONGS HERE, C3, AND ABOUT THE DRIVE THRU. I THINK -- I THINK WHERE IT IS, IT'S APPROPRIATE. LIKE, THERE IS A ZONING CLASSIFICATION THAT MEETS IT, EXCEPT FOR THE HEIGHT REQUIREMENT THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS THEY ALREADY WELL KNOW TO PIN DOWN WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT? BECAUSE IT IS 20 FEET HIGHER THAN WHAT IS ALLOWED. SO IF -- IF THAT'S NOT -- IF IT DOESN'T COME BACK TO OUR SATISFACTION, THEN THEY COULD STILL DO THIS THROUGH THE PUD PROCESS. AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST. SO I THINK THIS -- I THINK THAT GENERALLY, LIKE THE USES THAT THEY ARE INTENDING AND THE GENERAL CONFIGURATION MEETS WITHIN A NORMAL DISTRICT AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THROUGH -- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ZONES AT THOSE TRIP OF LAND USES. I'M USUALLY A CYCLIST. I DON'T USE DRIVE THRUS VERY OFTEN. ANYWHERE THAT DRIVE THRUS BELONG IN THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR CITY, AND IT'S THE INTERCHANGES OF HIGHWAYS. I GENERALLY DON'T LIKE TO TRAVERSE THEM. I DON'T LIKE MY CHILDREN TRAVERSING THEM ON BICYCLE OR WALKING, BUT IF THEY BELONG ANYWHERE, I THINK THIS IS WHERE THEY BELONG. AND SO I -- GIVEN THAT IT IS LITERALLY NEXT TO THE HIGHWAY, I WOULD SAY, SURE. PERSONALLY.
01:16:52.730: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION?
01:16:56.600: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS TO A DATE DETERMINED BY STAFF.
01:17:02.639: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A SECOND? I'M SORRY, WE ARE MOVING ON AT THIS TIME. DO WE HAVE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF POSTPONEMENT, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? WE ARE POSTPONED.
01:17:16.954: >> THANK YOU.
01:17:17.588: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE ARE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ITEM, 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER/MARIJUANA RETAILER. WE WILL BEGIN WITH A PRESENTATION FROM THE PETITIONER. THEY WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. WE WILL THEN HEAD ON TO A STAFF REPORT, WHICH WILL THEN BE FOLLOWED BY A PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION AND VOTE. WELCOME.
01:17:56.794: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS KYLE GONZALEZ FROM DAMIAN DESIGN GROUP. I'M JOINED BY BRIAN FENNIC ON THE PROJECT AND HEATH MILLER FROM MIDWESTERN CONSULTING, FROM THE CIVIL ENGINEERING STANDPOINT. THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS ON THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH. IT'S A -- SORRY. IT'S A NEW DEVELOPMENT. DO WE HAVE A MOUSE THAT I CAN CLICK TO?
01:18:35.833: >> YES. THERE'S NOT MUCH TO THE PRESENTATION, THOUGH.
01:18:52.349: >> THERE AN EXISTING BUILDING ON THE SITE. WE ARE PROPOSING TO BUILD AND SPLIT. THE LOT. AI NEW BUILDING 1500 SQUARE FEET ON THE SOUTHERN PORTION, AND PROVIDE A CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER THAT WILL PRODUCE THE IMPERVIOUS BY ABOUT 3,000 SQUARE FEET. ON THE EASTERN EDGE IT'S C1, C1, AND C1 ALL THE WAY AROUND. THIS IS THE LOCATION OF PARCEL IN THE GREATER NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SOUTHEASTERN ANN ARBOR. YOU CAN SEE THE C1 LOT THAT WRAPS AROUND AND THEN THE R4 LOT THAT'S DIRECTLY TO THE EAST, AND THIS IS WHY WE WOULD NEED A CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER. ONE SECOND. LET ME GRAB A BOARD. SORRY. SO THE PROPOSED BUILDING IS 1500 SQUARE FOOT SINGLE STORY, LOCATED THE SOUTH. WE TRIED TO PROVIDE AS MUCH GLAZING AS POSSIBLE, WHICH IS AT TIMES DIFFICULT, DUE TO STATE REGULATIONS. WE PROVIDED BIKE PARKING, THE SOUTHERN PARCEL AND THE BIKE PARKING THAT DID NOT EXIST FOR THE NORTHERN PARCEL. THE SOLID WASTE IS LOCATED IN AN ALLEYWAY CREATED BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS. YOU WILL THAT ON THE SITE PLAN. THE SOLID WASTE IS IN THIS LOCATION HERE. THE MEDICAL WASTE IS LOCATED WITHIN THE BUILDING. THERE'S A SPOT LOCATED WITHIN THE MECHANICAL SPACE. THE BUILDING IS 27 FEET TALL, AND CONFORMS AND MEETS ALL GENERAL STANDARDS. WE HAVE A SPACE DEDICATED FOR MEDICAL WASTE IN THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION RIGHT THERE. WE HAVE A LANDSCAPE PLAN AS WELL, THAT WAS COMMITTED AS PART OF THE SPA AND I APOLOGY, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE PART OF THIS PRESENTATION HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT IT. THE PART OF THE CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER --
01:21:46.556: >> Chair Milshteyn: IF YOU CAN SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE.
01:21:50.193: >> PER THE CITY STANDARDS. I THINK THAT'S IT FOR THIS PROJECT, BECAUSE IT'S A TIGHT SITE. THE NEW BUILDING WILL BE ALONG ELLSWORTH, CONSTRUCTED OF LONG LASTING MATERIALS, AND FIBER CEMENT MATERIAL, ALSO STONE. I THINK THAT THAT'S IT.
01:22:47.050: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. AND NOW WE'LL HEAD TO MS. DELEO FOR A STAFF REPORT.
01:22:53.390: >> THANK YOU.
01:23:00.897: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO YOU NEED YOUR MOUSE BACK?
01:23:03.667: >> THE MOUSE. IT'S OKAY. IN THE MEANTIME, -- IN THE MEANTIME, THIS -- THIS PETITION IS FOR 2385A EAST ELLSWORTH. IT IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE REQUEST FOR A MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER AND RETAILER. THE A DENOTES THAT THIS IS A PENDING LAND DIVISION, ONCE THE LAND DIVISION IS APPROVED, THIS WILL GET ITS OWN ADDRESS. ITS OWN ADDRESS. AND THIS' A PENDING SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL IN ITS CURRENT FORM, IT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR AN AREA PLAN AND THEREFORE, THAT'S WHAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES NEED TO COME WITH SOME SORT OF PLAN. THE SITE IS LOCATED ON EAST ELLSWORTH, BETWEEN STONE SCHOOL AND PLATT. IT IS -- I'M SORRY, THIS IS THE ZONING MAP. IT IS SURROUNDED TO THE NORTH AND WEST, BY C1 ZONING TO THE EAST, IT'S R4A ZONING. THEY ARE HERE TONIGHT TO REQUEST A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, AND WITH A SPECIAL EXCEPT USE APPROVAL, THEY WILL CONTINUE -- WE WILL CONTINUE PROCESSING THE SITE PLAN AND LAND DIVISION APPLICATIONS. THE SITE IN ITS CURRENT SHAPE, ITS FULL SIZE, IS TOO CLOSE TO THE MARGIN OF ERROR TO THE 1,00. BY DOING ALAND DIVISION, THEN THE SITE WHERE THE PROVISIONING CENTER/RETAILER WILL BE LOCATED WILL BE MORE THAN 1,000 FEET FROM THE SCHOOL. THE STAFF REPORT GOES THROUGH COMMERCIAL EXCEPTION USE STANDARDS. THEY HAVE MET THE GENERAL CRITERIA FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES, AS WELL AS THE USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR PROVISIONING CENTERS AND RETAILERS, AND THEY HAVE PROVIDED THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THEIR OPERATIONS STATEMENT AND SECURITY PLAN AND HOURS OF OPERATION. THE STAFF REPORT ALSO GOES THROUGH ALL OF THE CRITERIA FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL AND WE HAVE ATTACHED THE ORIGINAL PETITIONS TO IT. STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THIS COMMERCIAL EXCEPTION USE. WE HAVE INCLUDED IN THE MOTION, WHICH IS QUITE LENGTH AS TYPICAL OF PROVISIONING CENTERS, NOT ONLY THE STANDARD APPROVAL FINDINGS, BUT THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION APPROVAL CONDITIONS AND WE HAVE ADDED TWO CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE PENDING LAND DIVISIONS AND SITE, AND FUTURE SITE PLANS. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THIS.
01:26:01.111: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR ADDRESS AND YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:26:20.563: >> DAVID AND LeANN SINTROWSKI, I HAVE KNOWN STEVE, THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY SINCE 1996, AND BASICALLY, HE'S BEEN THERE TO HELP ALL THE PEOPLE, ALL THE -- ALL OF HIS -- ALL HIS PEOPLE THAT CAME TO HIS STORE. I WOULD EVER THEM HELP IF THEY COULDN'T AFFORD WHAT THEY HAD, AND HE'S GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE VETERAN. I'M A VETERAN, GIVING THEM DISCOUNTS AND HELPING THEM WITH THEIR MEDICATIONS AND I'M REAL EXCITED FOR HIM. I HOPE HE DOES WELL. THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
01:26:57.133: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANYBODY ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE?
01:27:10.313: >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? MY NAME IS RAMSEY KRAUT. I KNOW STEVE PERSONALLY. HE'S A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. I DO TRUST HIS JUDGMENT. HOW HE CARRIES HIS STORE AND HOW HE CARRIES HIS BUSINESS AND HOW HE CONDUCTS BUSINESS. I HAVE KNOWN HIM ON BOTH SIDES. I'M JUST HERE TO SUPPORT HIM.
01:27:31.935: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:27:40.910: >> HELLO, GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS AZA JAMINO, I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF STEVE. I HAVE KNOWN STEVE FOR GOING ON NINE YEARS NOW. STEVE HAS BEEN VERY INSTRUMENTAL WITH ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT I FOUNDED ACTUALLY NINE YEARS AGO, IN WHICH WHERE WE FEED OVER 3500 HOMELESS THROUGHOUT WAYNE COUNTY AND OAKLAND COUNTY AND THE LOCATED IN PONTIAC, MICHIGAN. I HAVE JUST WANT TO SAY YOU HAVE SOMEBODY HERE THAT IS REALLY A COMMUNITY ADVOCATE. MIGHT BE QUIET. DOESN'T NECESSARILY BOAST TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE DOES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT LEADERS DO. SO I JUST WANTED TO BE MADE AND PUT IT ON RECORD THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD MAN BEHIND THE SCENES THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE GOOD FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
01:28:26.356: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:28:37.500: >> MAURICE FILLPOT. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAVING STEVE EXPAND HIS BUSINESS HERE. AND THE PROPERTY IS A TOTALLY ISOLATED PROPERTY. IT'S GATED OUT TO THE ROAD. SO NOROSS TRAFFIC OR ANYBODY, UNLESS YOU SPECIFICALLY GOING TO THE PROVISION CENTER, WHICH YOU NEED A CARD THAT YOU WILL EVEN BE DEALING WITH THAT LOT. I WOULD LIKE TO STATE. THAT I DON'T THINK THE BLUEPRINTS TRULY SHOW THAT THE PROPERTY IS TRULY ONE WAY IN, OUT, THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD SURROUNDING, IT EVEN THE SCHOOL. IT'S OFTEN DOWN IN THE VALLEY. SO EVEN THE KIDS COMING ACROSS, THEY DON'T BUST UP THINGS OR SMELL THINGS, AT THE PROVISIONING CENTER. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. THANK YOU.
01:29:24.948: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WOULD WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? ANYBODY ELSE? ALL RIGHT. I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE VERY LONG MOTION. I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAS TO LISTEN TO ME READ THIS. ALL RIGHT. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING AND ACCOMPANYING SITE PLAN, FINDS THE PETITION SUBSTANTIALLY MEET THE STANDARDS OF CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.29.5. D, SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND SECTION 5.16.3. G, MARIJUANA FACILITY, AND THEREFORE, APPROVES THE 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH ROAD SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER,/MARIJUANA RETAILER. THE PROPOSED USE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE C1 LOCAL BUSINESS DISTRICT, WHICH PROVIDES FOR COMMERCIAL RETAIL USES, AS WELL AS OFFICE AND RESIDENTIAL USES, AND NUMBER TWO, THE PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC, PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS, CIRCULATION, OR ROAD INTERSECTIONS BASED ON THE LOCATION, EAST ELLSWORTH ROAD PROVIDES TRAFFIC TO THE SITE. NUMBER THREE A SITE PLAN DOCUMENTING THE EXISTING AND PROPOSED CONDITIONS OF THE SITE -- OF THE SITE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AS PART OF THIS APPLICATION, AND NUMBER FOUR, THROUGH DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER, REGARDING WASTE DISPOSAL AND INVENTORY TRACKING, SECURITY AND OTHER METHODS OF OPERATIONS OF THE FACILITY, THE PROVISIONING CENTER WILL BE OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES OR AREA, AND WILL NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON NATURAL FEATURES. THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:  ONE, A LAND DIVISION APPLICATION TO CREATE 8,000 SQUARE FOOT LOT IS SUBMITTED AND APPROVED WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL OF THIS AND THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE SHALL ONLY APPLY TO THAT LOT. NUMBER TWO, A SITE MAP FOR CITY COUNCIL -- FOR CITY COUNCIL FOR AN APPROXIMATELY 1500 SQUARE FOOT, ONE-STORY COMMERCIAL BUILDING MUST AB PROVED WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL OF THIS PETITION, AND THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE MAY ONLY OCCUPY THE DEVELOPMENT APPROVED ON THAT SITE PLAN.

NUMBER FOUR, THE PETITIONER OPERATING A MARIJUANA BUSINESS AT THIS ADDRESS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL DATE OF THIS PETITION, AND THAT THE ANN ARBOR -- THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVES THE ATTACHED AREA PLAN WHICH DEMONSTRATES COMPLIANCE THE APPLICABLE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STANDARDS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. DID COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:32:40.810: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YOU, MR. CHAIR. STEVE SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THIS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN A MARIJUANA SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE COME WITHOUT AN ACCOMPANYING SITE PLAN? IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT IT'S APPLIED WITH AN AREA PLAN?
01:33:00.029: >> WELL, IT WOULD BE -- YES IN -- I THINK IN THE SENSE THAT YOU ARE ASKING. MOST OF THE PREVIOUS PROVISIONING CENTERS CAME PLOT PLAN, AREA PLAN TYPE THAT WAS DOCUMENTING THE EXISTING SEASONS, BUT THEY WERE DOCUMENTING AN EXISTING BUILDING AND THE BUSINESS WAS MOVING IN -- WAS MOVING INTO AN EXISTING BUILDING AND THERE WAS NO NEW CONSTRUCTION.
01:33:24.420: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WHAT ABOUT THE GAS STATION ON WASHTENAW NEAR THE VICTORY INN? WAS THAT AIL --
01:33:32.395: >> THAT HAS A BUILDING -- THAT MIGHT BE -- THAT MIGHT BE A SITE PLAN FOLLOW NEW CONSTRUCTION AS WELL.
01:33:39.068: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO --
01:33:40.703: >> CAN I SPEAK TO THAT?
01:33:44.507: >> Chair Milshteyn: NOT QUITE YET.
01:33:47.777: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY RELEVANT. THANK YOU. I WILL CALL UPON YOU.
01:33:51.347: >> THANK YOU, SIR.
01:33:55.284: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO I GUESS MY LINE OF INQUIRY HAS LESS TO DO WITH THIS A MARIJUANA IF A SILLY AND SOMEONE WITH GOOD REFERENCES BUT WHERE IT'S LOCATED -- THAT IT'S COMMERCIAL IN PROM PROXIMITY. MY CONCERN IS THE STORMWATER. IT'S UPHILL FROM THE FOREST HILLS COOPERATIVE WHICH HAS DOCUMENTED FLOODING ISSUES AS WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED, YOU KNOW TWO, WEEKS AGO. SO THAT'S MY MAJOR CONCERN AND I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE STORMWATER SYSTEM BUT I DON'T THINK WE WILL GET THERE UNTIL THE SITE PLAN. SO I -- I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS ARE, BECAUSE I -- I GUESS I DON'T SEE THE CONCERN IN TALKING ABOUT MARIJUANA. I SEE THE CONCERN AS TALKING ABOUT HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MITIGATE NEGATIVE STORMWATER RUNOFF TO NEIGHBORING PROPERTY. SO IF THE ENGINEER WOULD TALK ABOUT THAT?
01:35:15.798: >> MY NAME IS STEVE HART WITH MIDWESTERN CONSULTING. WE HAVE A DESIGN FOR THE STORMWATER. IT'S TWO SYSTEM SINCE THE PARCEL WILL BE SPLIT, THERE'S TWO INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS. THEY COMPLY WITH THE WASHTENAW COUNTY RULES, WHICH THIS WOULD FALL UNDER AS WELL AS THE CITY RULES, WHICH, OF COURSE, FOLLOWS THE COUNTY RULES. SO IT DOES PROVIDE FOR THE STORAGE OF A 100 YEAR STORM EVENT. WE ALREADY HAVE DONE THE SOILS TESTING FOR INFILTRATION POTENTIAL. THE SITE WAS A CLAY SITE. SO WE DON'T HAVE, UNFORTUNATELY, THE INFILTRATION POTENTIAL THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON A SITE, BUT WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING WE ARE DESIGNING FOR 20% INCREASE IN EXCESS OF 100 YEAR STORM EVENT TO PROVIDE THAT EXCESS POTENTIAL FOR STORMWATER STORAGE ON THE SITE. AND THE RELEASE IS TO THE PUBLIC STORM SEWER IN ELLSWORTH ROAD IS WHERE THE PROPOSED OUTLET OF THAT STORM WATER IS. THAT'S A CONTROLLED RATE.
01:36:22.498: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M GLAD YOU MOVED THROUGH THAT STAGE OF ENGINEERING.
01:36:25.601: >> AND ALL OF THAT IS A PART OF THE SITE PLAN PROCESS.
01:36:28.571: >> Councilmember Ackerman: RIGHT. THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR ANY SITE PLAN, RIGHT? SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO SEE CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AT THIS STAGE, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE -- WOULD IT BE GUARANTEED IN ANY SITE PLAN APPROVAL FOR A COMMERCIAL USE IN THIS AREA?
01:36:44.587: >> YES, AS YOU ARE SORT ALLUDING TO IT'S ZONED C1 AND SO A SMALL RETAIL BUILDING, A SMALL COMMERCIAL BUILDING WOULD BE ALLOWED PER THE DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCES. IT'S JUST THE USE THAT THEY -- THAT THEY ARE HOPING TO PUT IN THAT BUILDING REQUIRES SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THEY STARTED THE R ENTIRE PROCES AND THEN THEY DECIDED LET'S FOCUS ON THE LAND USE. THEY DID NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD THIS BUILDING IF THEIR INTENDED USE WOULD NOT BE APPROVED. SO WE HAVE THE SITE PLAN ON FILE. IT HAS ALL -- IT'S WELL ON ITS WAY TO MEETING ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS, STORMWATER, AND CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFERS, PARKING REQUIREMENTS, ET CETERA. BUT THEY SORT OF PAUSED IT, LOOKING FOR THAT ASSURANCE THAT THEIR INTENDED USE WOULD BE APPROVED, BEFORE CONTINUING WITH THE TIME AND THE EXPENSE INVOLVED IN SITE PLAN.
01:37:39.842: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO I THINK MAY BE I TOO FRESH OFF OF TALKING WITH THE WEBER PROPERTY AND THE ISSUES THAT RESULTED FROM APPROVING AN AREA PLAN WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING SITE PLAN. AS STAFF IS REVIEWING THAT SITE PLAN -- OR ACTUALLY, EVEN ABSENT A SITE PLAN, ARE THERE ANY POTENTIAL RISKS THAT YOU WOULD, YOU KNOW, NOTE TO THIS BODY OF APPROVING THIS AS A -- AS AN AREA PLAN SCU WITHOUT AN ACCOMPANYING SITE PLAN?
01:38:12.475: >> NO. THAT'S WHY WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL AND WE WERE COMFORTABLE, PARTICULARLY WITH -- THERE ARE TWO CONDITIONS IN THE MOTION, THAT ARE SOMEWHAT UNNECESSARY, ACTUALLY, SAYING THAT THE BUILDING -- THEY HAVE TO DO A LAND DIVISION AND A SITE PLAN. IF -- THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DOBDONE THAT IN IWAY. I THINK THE RISK IS THE OPPOSITE. IF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS NOT APPROVED, THERE CAN BE A BUILDING, A SITE PLAN THERE. IT JUST HAS TO BE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SHOP. # ALTHOUGH NOW THAT I HEAR THAT, I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT MADE SENSE. DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?
01:38:57.620: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IT DID. YOU DON'T PERCEIVE ANY RISK, BECAUSE ACTUAL IS DOING IS ALLOWING THE POTENTIAL OF A MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER TO BE LOCATED HERE AND IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH THE MIDDLE EAST OF A LOT LOT -- THE MEAT OF A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE NEED TO DISCUSS WILL HAPPEN IN THE SITE PLAN CONVERSATION. THERE'S NO MATERIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND -- YOU NOAH PROVING THIS AND ANY POSSIBLE SITE PLAN THAT COULD COME BEFORE US AFTER IT. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHAT TYPE OF RETAIL WOULD BE GOING INTO IT.
01:39:29.752: >> RIGHT. THAT IS MY -- I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHAT RETAIL -- I THINK WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS TAKING THE SLOW ROAD AND APPROVING THE COMPONENTS SEPARATELY. THEY COULD BE DONE SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT'S FRANKLY DELAYING EXISTING PROCESS AND MAKING IT SLOW.
01:39:46.936: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S NOT A REZONING IN THAT THE USE WILL CHANGE OR ANY OF THE REGULATIONS OF FORM OR ACCOMPANYING DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS WILL CHANGE, IT'S SIMPLY A PERMISSION THAT MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTERS -- MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER COULD GO IN AT THAT LOCATION?
01:40:05.121: >> RIGHT. WHAT IS BEFORE YOU IS A REQUEST TO HAVE A 1500 SQUARE FOOT MARIJUANA PROVISIONING OR RETAILER LOCATED ON THE SOUTH SIDE -- OR ON AN 8,000 SQUARE FOOT PIECE OF THIS HOME SITE.
01:40:20.402: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
01:40:21.837: >> SO IT IS FAIRLY NARROW WITH THE REQUEST AND AS WRITTEN, IT'S FAIRLY NARROW WHAT EXACTLY YOU ARE APPROVING.
01:40:27.977: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THANK YOU EVER.
01:40:31.247: >> Chair Milshteyn: MISSIONER SAUVE.
01:40:36.752: >> Commissioner Sauve: JUST A CLARIFICATION FOR THE 1,000-FOOT BUFFER AND THE GE GEOMETRIES THT ARE CREATED FROM IT. CAN YOU GO TO THAT SLIDE? HOW ARE THE OFFSETS OF THE 600 AND 1,000 SQUARE FOOT ACTUALLY TRANSCRIBED ON THIS MA MAP FROMA SQUARE BOUNDING BOX TO A ROUNDED EDGE THING? TO THE CENTER POINT?
01:41:04.013: >> NO. IT'S FROM THE -- IT'S FROM THE PERIMETER OF EACH PROPERTY. SO THAT'S WHY IT -- THERE'S A CURVE, SO THAT --
01:41:12.288: >> A RADIUS FOR THAT CURVE.
01:41:16.525: >> YEAH, IT'S A BUFFER AND NOT -- IT'S A BUFFER AND NOT A RADIUS. THE PINK IS -- IS -- THE PINK IS 1,000 FEET FROM BRYANT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND SO AT ANY POINT, IT'S -- IT'S A 600 -- I'M SORRY, 1,000-FOOT BUFFER. THE YELLOW IS SIMILAR. THE YELLOW IS A 600-FOOT BUFFER FROM THE -- RIGHT NOW, IT'S SHOWING FROM THE ENTIRE SITE. ARE.
01:41:46.088: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
01:41:46.689: >> WITH THE LAND DIVISION, IT WILL BE MINUSCULELY SMALLER, BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE SEEING, NOT A RADIUS. YOU ARE SEEING A BUFFER.
01:41:56.665: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THEN THE MARGIN OF ERROR, LIKE WE ARE RIGHT ON THAT CORNER. JUST WHAT IS THE MARGIN OF ERROR, TO HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS?
01:42:07.676: >> TO BE CONSISTENT, WE ARE USING THE CITY'S JS AND -- JAS LAYER, AND THE DISTANCE MEASURED WAS LIKE 999.9 FEET. BUT OUR G.I.S. SYSTEM HAS A MARGIN OF ERROR OF PLUS OR MINUS 3 FEET.
01:42:31.900: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
01:42:32.501: >> AND WE COULD HAVE DONE A BOUNDARY SURVEY OR SOMETHING, BUT TO BE FAIR TO ALL PETITIONS, THIS IS -- THIS IS THE WAY IT IS.
01:42:40.909: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY I'M JUST CURIOUS, BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAOSEST ONE WE HAVE SEEN.
01:42:45.347: >> IT DEFINITELY IS THE CLOSEST ONE.
01:42:47.816: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
01:42:48.417: >> AND THAT IS WHY A SMALL LAND DIVISION WILL MOVE IT OUTSIDE OF THE BUFFER AREA.
01:42:53.255: >> Commissioner Sauve: YEP. IS THERE -- ARE WE LOOKING AT AN EASEMENT AS PART OF THIS OR WILL WE SEE AN EASEMENT TO TABAK LOT AS PART OF THE SITE PLAN?
01:43:02.865: >> 30-FOOT ACCESS AND EASEMENT IS A SHARED DRIVEWAY.
01:43:08.437: >> Commissioner Sauve: THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW. THANKS.
01:43:13.142: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:43:15.544: >> Commissioner Briggs: I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE ROOM. WE DON'T USUALLY SEE A CROWD OF SUPPORT. I WAS BRACING MYSELF FOR DIFFERENT AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. WE DID GET A FEW LETTERS THAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROJECT, AND SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL. AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY, THOUGH, THE -- THE PIECE THAT I THINK WEIGHS -- THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ARE, YOU KNOW, IS THIS -- THIS IS MO POTENTIALLY WITHIN 1,000 FEET AND THE PETITIONER HAS REQUESTED A LAND DIVISION. I'M NOT SURE IF I EVER DEALT WITH A LAND DIVISION ON PLANNING COMMISSION BEFORE. SO KIND OF HOW THOSE REQUESTS ARE RECEIVED AND EVALUATED AND ALL OF THAT.
01:44:08.330: >> LAND DIVISIONS ARE LARGELY GOVERNED BY STATE STATUTE. THE STATE STATUTE SAYS THAT PROPERTY OWNERS ARE ENTITLED TO DIVIDE THEIR LAND. AND IT SHALL BE APPROVED IF THE CHILD PARCEL -- AND THAT'S THE LINGA. IN THE CHILD PARCELS MEET THE AREA, THE LOT AREA, THE LOT WIDTH AND THE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS OF THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY. AND SO IT'S MEETING THE MINIMUM LOT SIZE, AND THEN ACCESS. YOU ARE ACCESS STANDARDS ARE YOU FRONT ON A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ROAD? AND SO THE -- OR WILL YOU PROVIDE AN ACCESS EASEMENT TO A LAND LOCKED PARCEL? IT IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AND THEY MEET THOSE BARE BONES REQUIREMENTS AND BY STATE LAW, IT SHALL BE APPROVED IF YOU MEET THAT PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO DIVIDE THEIR LAND.
01:45:02.985: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. THAT HELPS THAT IT'S NOT DISCRETIONARY. IT'S --
01:45:06.789: >> CORRECT.
01:45:07.122: >> Commissioner Briggs: IT'S A -- THIS IS A -- SOMETHING THAT IS ALLOWABLE. SO, I MEAN, I CAN UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERNS FROM FOLKS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT SAID, THIS FEELS A LITTLE BIT NOT QUITE RIGHT WHEN YOU ARE, WELL, ROUGHLY 1,000 FEET AND WE WILL CUT OFF A LITTLE BIT AND NOW WE ARE NOT ANYMORE. BUT SINCE IT IS WITHIN THE LEGAL RIGHT OF THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THAT THEN MOVES THEM AN APPROPRIATE DISTANCE. OKAY. THANKS.
01:45:41.123: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:45:43.792: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANKS. DO WE KNOW HOW LONG -- IT LOOKS LIKE THE WHOLE PROPERTY, NOT THE HAVES. THE DIVISION THAT'S INTENDED TO CURVE, BUT THE WHOLE PROPERTY WAS CARVED OFF. DO WE KNOW WHEN THAT HAPPENED? DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHEN THIS HAPPENED?
01:46:05.581: >> I'M SORRY, THE REQ QUESTION -
01:46:09.852: >> Vice Chair Mills: IT'S JUST THIS BOX THAT WE SEE HERE, THE YELLOW BOX SEEMED LIKE ONCE UPON A TIME, THAT ENTIRE SITE WAS WON AND SO THIS WAS ALREADY CARVED OFF ONCE. DO WE KNOW WHEN THAT DIVISION HAPPENED?
01:46:23.499: >> Chair Milshteyn: IF YOU CAN STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD.
01:46:26.468: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS STEVE SILKA. MY FAMILY PURCHASED THAT BUSINESS IN 1995, OR '96, MY APOLOGIES, FEBRUARY 21st, '96. AND THE OWN  OWNERS PRIOR TO USD IT FOR MAYBE SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AND PRIOR TO THAT, I BELIEVE IT WAS A KWIK PIK AND THEY ARE WHO BUILT, IT BUT THAT'S --
01:46:59.067: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO IT'S BEEN THIS SHAPE FOR DECADES.
01:47:03.505: >> YES.
01:47:03.772: >> Vice Chair Mills: I HAVE THE SAME REACTION AS COMMISSIONER BRIGGS, IN THAT THE ONLY THING THAT RAISED MY EYEBROWS IN ANY OF THE THINGS IS LIKE, OH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S PRETTY CLOSE AND SO WAS THERE LIKE, WELL -- THERE WAS A DIVISION, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE 1,000-FOOT SETBACK. I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THIS. YEAH. I -- I THINK THAT THIS MAKES SENSE. AND ALSO KNOWING THAT THIS IS -- THAT IT'S PRETTY DARN CLOSE AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVE IF YOU GO OUT THERE WITH SURVEY EQUIPMENT, THAT IT'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN 1,000 FEET, BUT IT'S -- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW. I WORK IN THE WORLD OF PLUS OR MINUS ALL THE TIME. AND SO THERE'S A MARGIN OF ERROR. I HAVE SOMETHING -- DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD ABOUT THE LAND DIVISION.
01:47:52.054: >> I DO. YOU KNOW, WE HAD PREVIOUSLY GOTTEN APPROVAL FROM THE ZONING COORDINATOR AND CITY STAFF THAT IT DID SATISFY THE BUFFER AND THAT WE WERE -- WE COULD PROCEED WITHOUT DOING THE LAND DIVISION. AND SO WE BEGAN THAT PROCESS, AND APPROXIMATELY MAYBE FOUR OR -- LIKE A FEW MONTHS LATER, WE GET -- WE RECEIVED WORD THAT THAT WASN'T, IN FACT, THE CASE BECAUSE OF, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS THE CONFLICTING -- THE CONFLICTING DATA FROM BOTH THE MAP AND THE G.I.S., AND SO OBVIOUSLY, WE WERE INVITED TO GET A SURVEY AND DO ALL OF THAT, AND THE COST ALONE WAS ONE THING, BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF PARCELS INVOLVED, BUT ALSO WE HAD A -- AN INDICATION THAT THIS WAS SOME OPPOSITION FROM THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY, AND THAT ALL THAT REALLY WAS GOING TO DO IS HAVE A DUAL OF THE SURVEYS AND INVITE LITIGATION WHEN WE DETERMINED AFTER TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THEM AND AFTER TRYING TO WORK OUT SOME KIND OF ARRANGEMENT AND BEING UP FRONT WITH THEM TO KNOW AVAIL AND WITH NO COMMUNICATION FROM THEM, AND THEIR COUNSEL SAYING THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK WITH US, WE DETERMINED THAT THE BEST APPROACH WAS TO DO A BUY RIGHT LAND DIVISION, AND MOVE FORWARD THAT WAY.
01:49:12.701: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND TO BE CLEAR, JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ALL THE STUFF IN THE BACK OF THE MY MIND, THE BACK HALF OF THIS PARCEL, THAT 1 TO YOU FOOT BUFFER IS FOR ALL MEDICAL MARIJUANA TYPES OF ESTABLISHMENTS FROM SCHOOLS, RIGHT? IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T GROW FACILITIES OR --
01:49:33.355: >> IT'S NOT FOR ALL TYPES OF FACILITIES. IT'S FOR SALES.
01:49:40.529: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. OKAY. I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO GO WITH THAT. I'M GLAD THAT WE KNOW THE ANSWER. PRESUMABLY THIS ENTIRE PROPERTY, EVEN THE BACK HALF IS GOING TO BE -- IS GOING TO BE ALL WITHIN THE SAME FENCE?
01:50:04.019: >> WELL, FRANKLY, WE -- FOR AESTHETIC REASONS, WE HOPE TO REMOVE THE FENCE AND -- BUT IT WILL ALL BE ON THE -- I MEAN, IT WILL BE TWO SEPARATE PROPERTY LINES AND THERE WILL BE THE LAP USE BUFFER THAT ENCOMPASSES THE ENTIRE -- BOTH PROPERTIES. SO I MEAN, WHETHER OR NOT A FENCE REMAINS ON THE BACK PORCH OR THE SIDE PORCH, IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT WILL BE THE CASE. EVERYTHING WILL BE AMONGST THOSE TWO PARCELS.
01:50:31.379: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. GOT IT. THE OTHER THING THAT -- I MEAN, BASED ON THE LETTERS THAT WE GOT TO, IS THE PROXIMITY TO NEIGHBORS AND I'M JUST THINKING OF SOME OF THE CENTERS THAT WE HAVE APPROVED ON SOUTH MAIN, FOR EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S THE ONE NEXT TO THE 7-ELEVEN, RIGHT, WHICH -- LIKE, THERE'S NOT EVEN THIS CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER. IT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO RESIDENTIAL. SO I GET IT, THAT'S NOT HOW OUR CODE IS WRITTEN, AND REALLY, THIS IS NOT AS CLOSE TO SOME RESIDENTIAL AS -- AS MANY OF THE OTHER USES THAT WE HAVE APPROVED. SO FOR -- IF ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS ARE WATCHING US AT HOME, WE READ YOUR LETTERS AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TRYING TO BE FAIR ACROSS THE CITY AS WE DO THIS. SO I THINK THAT THANK YOU FOR WRITING. AND THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOU, AGAIN, WOUL, WHO CAME OUT. IT REALLY HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, WHERE THE COMMUNITY, ALL OF THE COMMUNITY IS COMING FROM IN THIS. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT PROCESS THAT GETS BACK TO SOMETHING THAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN WAS ASKING, WHICH IS, I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS APPROVAL -- YOU ARE SEEKING APPROVAL FOR THE AREA PLAN WITH A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, BUT THERE WILL BE A SITE PLAN. WILL WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT? OR -- [ INAUDIBLE ]
01:51:57.165: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. SO WE WOULD SEE THE SITE PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT?
01:52:04.539: >> WE ARE BREAKING IT UP. TONIGHT YOU ARE SEEING THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE COMPONENT. JUST THINK BACK TO THE PREVIOUS -- THE REZONING SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. ANYWAY, WE ARE EXPANDING THIS. WE HAVE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION COMPONENT. IF THAT IS APPROVED, THEY WILL BRING FORTH A SITE PLAN -- A SITE PLAN FOR YOUR CONSIDERATIONS AND IN POINT OF FACT, THERE WILL BE TWO SITE PLANS, THERE'S ONE FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL, FOR THE NORTH -- THE B PARCEL, BECAUSE THAT IS GETTING JUST PARKING LOT IMPROVEMENTS IS. IT'S A PARKING LOT FORMALIZATION AND THEN THERE WILL BE A SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL WHICH YOU WILL SEE AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION FOR, FOR A 12500 SQUARE BUILDING WITH ITS OWN PARKING LOT AND STORMWATER SYSTEM AND SO FORTH. SO WE'RE NOT SKIPPING ANY PIECES OF IT, BUT WE ARE MAKING IT GO SLOWER.
01:53:04.733: >> Vice Chair Mills: BECAUSE IF THEY WERE TO TODAY DIVIDE IT AND BUILD A NEW BUILDING THAT'S ESSENTIALLY TO THE SAME SPECS THAT THEY WANT, THAT WAS FOR SOME OTHER USE, THEY WOULD NOT BE BEFORE US?
01:53:14.876: >> WELL, THE BUILDING WOULD BE BEFORE YOU BUT NOT THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE.
01:53:19.514: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. GOT IT. OKAY. THEN THAT TAKES CARE OF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD, WHICH IS IN THE LANGUAGE IT SAYS APPROXIMATELY 1500 SQUARE FEET FOR THE -- FOR THE BUILDING ITSELF. AND I JUST WANTED TO -- I WAS WONDERING IF WE SHOULD ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT NOT TO EXCEED A PARTICULAR THING, LIKE I DON'T WANT TO PIN THEM TO AN EXACT SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT IT'S MONTH ARE PIN THEM NOT TO EXCEED SQUARE FOOTAGE. AND -- BUT THAT WILL COME BACK AND WE WILL SAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT THIS SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS FOR APPROXIMATELY THIS, I THINK GIVES US SOME COVER, MAYBE NOT, IF OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A NOT TO EXCEED. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH CHANGING THE LANGUAGE TO NOT TO EXCEED 1500 SQUARE FEET.
01:54:09.631: >> THE BUILDING AS IT STANDS IS 1523. COULD WE PUT IT TO 1550.
01:54:22.744: >> TO 1550 AND NOT TO EXCEED 1600.
01:54:25.013: >> Vice Chair Mills: I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE IN MAKING A DECISION NOT TO THE EXCEED 1600. I DEFER TO OTHER PEOPLE IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT NUMBER IS. I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT IN THERE, JUST SO THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH OTHERS.
01:54:40.929: >> I THINK 1600 WOULD BE FAIR. IT WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF RUNWAY, BUT NOT TOO MUCH.
01:54:46.768: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO SHALL I MAKE THE AMENDMENT -- THE PROPOSAL -- OR I MOVE TO AMEND THE PROPOSAL, NUMBER TWO, VOTE ON THE -- NUMBER TWO IN THE -- WELL, IN THE SECOND SET OF NUMBERS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO READ INSTEAD OF SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL, FOR A -- FOR A BUILDING NOT TO EXCEED 1600 SQUARE FEET, FOR ONE-STORY COMMERCIAL BUILDING, NOT TO EXCEED 1600 SQUARE FEET, WHICH MUST BE APPROVED WITHIN ONE YEAR.
01:55:25.440: >> YEP.
01:55:27.108: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO I HAVE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. DISCUSSION ON THAT AMENDMENT? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THAT AMENDMENT IS APPROVED. BACK TO YOU, COMMISSIONER MILLS.
01:55:40.655: >> Vice Chair Mills: THAT'S ALL I HAD. THANK YOU.
01:55:44.259: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:55:46.294: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THANK YOU. I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS -- WHAT THE BUILDING ON THE -- THE EXISTING BUILDING ON THE PROPERTY IS USED FOR AND WHAT YOU EXPECT IT TO BE USED FOR ONCE THE LAND DIVISION IS APPROVED?
01:55:58.206: >> IT'S CURRENTLY A -- UNDER THE -- NOT THE MM -- NOT THEM. MARIJUANA LICENSING ACT, BUT UNDER ORIGINAL CAREGIVER -- UNDER THE ORIGINAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA, IT'S A CAREGIVER GROW FACILITY.
01:56:16.624: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT IT TO REMAIN AS SUCH?
01:56:20.728: >> YES. BUT IT WILL HAVE NO INTERACTION WITH -- NONE OF THAT PRODUCT WOULD BE SOLD. IT'S LEGALLY NOT -- IT WOULD NOT ALLOWED TO BE SOLD OR MOVED FROM THAT FACILITY, EXCUSE ME, TO THE PRESUMED LICENSED MEDICAL OR RETAIL FACILITY. SO IT WOULD BE SEPARATE AND APART. THERE'S NO COMMINGLING OF ANY PRODUCT OR TRANSFERRING OF -- YOU KNOW FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER.
01:56:48.990: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND THAT'S THE CURRENT USE AND THAT'S WAUGH WHAT YOU EXPECT THE UNITUSE TOREMAIN?
01:57:00.768: >> YES.
01:57:01.035: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YOU ARE NOTING TO DO.
01:57:04.739: >>   --
01:57:07.775: >> I THINK THERE WILL BE SOME BUILDING CHANGES, TO BRING THE BILLING UP TO THE STANDARDS. THE SITE LINE IS THERE. AS IT'S PROPOSED RIGHT NOW -- AS, YOU KNOW, THE PETITION RIGHT NOW DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY REALLY, ANY CHANGES SO THAT FACILITY.
01:57:26.060: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC ACCESS, THE WAY THE RETAIL FACILITY WOULD. DOES IT HAVE PUBLIC ACCESS.
01:57:33.735: >> IT WOULD HAVE PUBLIC ACCESS, IN THAT THEY HAVE A SHARED PORKING LOT AND A SHARED DRIVEWAY ALONG THE SIDE.
01:57:41.042: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I MEANT MORE LIKE THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BUILDING?
01:57:46.614: >> NO.
01:57:46.848: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE BUILDING ON THE SOUTHERN PORTION.
01:57:51.653: >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
01:57:52.120: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I GUESS I WANTED TO GO ON THE RECORD THAT SAYING ONE -- ONE OF THE LETTERS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM A CONCERNED COMMUNITY MEMBER DREW AN ANALOGY TO A PARTY STORE IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I -- I THINK THEY ARE ACTUALLY QUITE DIFFERENT. I THINK THE LAYERS OF SECURITY AND KIND OF MULTIPLE THRESHOLDS THAT YOU HAVE TO ENTER IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE FACILITY THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING, MAKE IT VERY DIFFERENT THAN A PARTY STORE IN TERMS EVER ITSISM ITS IMPACT ONE ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOODS. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT. THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANKS.
01:58:30.158: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS. ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE BRIAN COMMUNITY CENTER WHICH SERVICES THAT AREA. DO WE KNOW THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SITE HERE AND THE BRIAN COMMUNITY CENTER?
01:58:44.472: >> I DO NOT KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I WILL LOOK AT THAT -- THAT'S -- IF YOU CAN SEE MY POINTER, ISN'T IT THAT LIKE THREE EDEN COURT?
01:59:00.922: >> Chair Milshteyn: IT WINDS IN THERE AND I GET CONFUSED WHERE EXACTLY IT IS. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS [
01:59:07.862: >> CLOSER TO THE CORNER. I THINK IT'S RIGHT HERE.
01:59:10.898: >> IT'S ON THE CORNER. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:59:14.836: >> Chair Milshteyn: RIGHT THERE. OKAY. SO IN DISTANCE-WISE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S MORE THAN IS THOUSAND FEET.
01:59:24.112: >> THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS PARCEL IS ABOUT EVENING WITH THE TOP LINE.
01:59:28.850: >> Chair Milshteyn: GOT IT.
01:59:29.584: >> SO IT WOULD BE ABOUT 1,000 FEET PLUS THE DISTANCE OF THE SCHOOL PROPERTY IN MY ABSOLUTE EXPERT GEOGRAPHY OPINION.
01:59:38.860: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. THAT'S BETTER THAN MINE. AND THEN QUESTION IN REGARDS TO FOREST HILL CO-OP WHERE THEIR COMMUNITY CENTER IS. I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS IN COMPARISON TO THIS SITE. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:00:17.899: >> Chair Milshteyn: MY QUESTIONS ARE, I JUST WANT TO KNOW -- NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE THAT, IS TO GET A BETTER SENSE FOR IT. LET'S SEE, AND I THINK THAT WAS IT FOR ME AT THIS TIME. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:00:34.482: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER THING -- I'M LOOKING AT GOOGLE EARTH RIGHT NOW AND LOOKING AT THE BIGGER CONTEXTD. AND IT APPEARS -- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YEAR THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN. THERE'S A PAVED PATHWAY THAT GOES UP FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT TO THE BACK OF THIS. FROM, YOU KNOW, THE CO-OP, AND I DON'T KNOW. THE FENCE MAY NOT BE SUCH A BAD THING ON THE BACK, I GUESS. KIND OF FEEL LIKE -- BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE REALLY HAVE THAT KIND OF -- LIKE, WE HAVEN'T REALLY APPLIED THAT TO ANY OTHER PROJECT. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THAT'S -- MAYBE THAT'S UNFAIR. BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT JUST KIND OF -- ALL PATHS LEAD TO THE PROVISIONING CENTER. IT ALSO LEADS TO SOME OTHER HARD SCAPE IN THERE THAT LOOKS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, SOME SORT OF RECREATION. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BASKETBALL OR -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT THERE'S -- IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR TO ME WHAT THE USE IS TO THE WEST. BUT IT JUST FEELS A LITTLE LIKE -- YOU KNOW, STRAIGHT THERE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT, AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANY KIND OF THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF -- I MEAN, IT'S P PAVES. IT'S NOT EVEN A COW PATH, IT'S PAVED.
02:01:55.196: >> IT'S BLOCKED AT THE MOMENT. THERE IS A FENCE ON THE BACK.
02:02:02.537: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE REMOVING THE FENCE.
02:02:07.108: >> THE FRONT FENCE. BUT THE ENTIRE PROPERTY ON ALL OTHER SIDES WILL BE ENCAPSULATED.
02:02:13.347: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. THAT'S GREAT. I THINK -- THAT MAKES SENSE. BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE FENCE WAS ACTUALLY OFF THE PROPERTY IN THE SITE PLAN.
02:02:34.402: >> THERE'S A FENCE ALONG THE SOUTH AND THIS IS BLOCKED.
02:02:37.371: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ALL RIGHTY. SO IF THAT'S REMANING, I'M OKAY WITH THAT. WHEN IT'S UP AT THE FRONT, I GUGETIT. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S SUCH AN INVITATION IN A WAY. AND I KNOW THERE'S  LAYERS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING. DON'T TAKE OUT ALL THE FENCE IS MY MESSAGE.
02:02:54.455: >> IT'S BEEN BLOCKED SINCE APPROXIMATELY 2004 AND IT WILL REMAIN AS SUCH.
02:03:00.728: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
02:03:04.065: >> Chair Milshteyn: WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO AMENDING THE MOTION TO ADD LANGUAGE THAT THE BACK FENCE REMAINS?
02:03:11.372: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEAH, I GUESS. I MEAN COMMISSIONER BRIGGS PERHAPS HAS A -- YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT IDEA? WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS TO ANYBODY ELSE.
02:03:18.813: >> Commissioner Briggs: I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND I -- I UNDERSTAND THE SORT OF ALL PATHS LEAD TO THE CENTER, HOWEVER, IN EVERY OTHER DISCUSSION AROUND THIS TABLE, WHAT WE TALK ABOUT IS CONNECTIVITY AND WE HAVE A PAVED PATH LEADING TO A PROJECT WHICH WE ARE THEN BLOCKING. SO IF THERE'S -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS TO -- AS A COMMUNITY TO BENEFIT, SOME -- YOU KNOW FIVE-DAY FORECASTURE OUT A WAY THAT THAT THE PATH -- FIGURE OUT AI WA THAT THE PATH S TO A SIDEWALK.
02:03:56.317: >> THE FENCE WAS REALLY A SAFETY CONCERN WHEN WE SHUT IT DOWN. THERE WERE THINGS THAT WERE HATCHHAPPENING BACK THERE FROM E LOCAL YOUNG PEOPLE, AND IT JUST WASN'T SAFE FOR PEOPLE. WE SHUT IT DOWN. FOREST HILLS AT THE TIME REALLY OBJECTED TO US SHUTTING IT DOWN, AND WHAT THEY DID, IS THEY ACTUAL MADE A NEW FENCE THAT IS ON THE SO IT WOULD BE --
02:04:28.382: >> Commissioner Briggs: CAN YOU COME UP HERE TO THE MICROPHONE SO PEOPLE CAN HEAR YOU. THANKS.
02:04:32.486: >> I APOLOGIZE. SO THEY PUT A NEW PATHWAY ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE PROPERTY, AND THERE'S A NEW WALKWAY THAT LEADS THAT WAY.
02:04:44.932: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. DOES IT CONNECT TO THAT?
02:04:48.869: >> I'M NOT SURE. GUYS? IT DOES OR DOES NOT CONNECT? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:05:09.423: >> WE TRULY CLOSED IT FOR THE BEST OF THE COMMUNITY.
02:05:11.626: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I GENERALLY LOVE PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIVITY BUT THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS ONE THAT WAS NOT BENEFICIAL.
02:05:25.640: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION. MS. HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:05:29.810: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: MAYBE THIS IS MORE FOR STAFF. ONE OF THE LETTERS WE GOT SAID THAT -- MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A SIMILAR BUSINESS A MILE ON HE WILELLSWORTH IN AN INDUSTRIAL P. ARE THERE ANY SORT OF STANDARDS ON, LIKE, WE SHOULDN'T LOCATE THESE? I'M CURIOUS?
02:05:49.130: >> Chair Milshteyn: IT IS. IT'S EXCLUSIVE BRANDS. I RUN BY IT. MY GYM IS RIGHT THERE. IT'S OFF OF VARSITY.
02:05:56.270: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: BUT THERE AREN'T ANY -- WE CAN'T LOCATE ONE WITHIN X FEET OF ANOTHER?
02:06:01.442: >> THAT IS CORRECT. YOU CAN'T LOCATE ONE WITHIN 600 FEET OF ANOTHER.
02:06:05.513: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. SO A MILE IS DEFINITELY OUTSIDE OF THAT. OKAY. THAT'S IT.
02:06:12.386: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. [ APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA, WHICH IS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE MAY ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES REGARDING ANY ITEM AT ALL. SO FEEL FREE. STRAISTATE YOUR NAME.
02:06:46.287: >> MY NAME IS MARVIN MONROE, AND AS FAR AS THE FOREST HILLS COMMUNITY CENTER, THEY HAVE NO CHILDREN'S PROGRAM, AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM, THEY DON'T -- NOW STONY BROOK, YEAH, THEY DO HAVE SOMETHING. BUT THAT COMMUNITY CENTER DOES NOTHING FOR ANYTHING. THEY JUST COLLECT MONEY. SO IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S KIDS COMING -- THE KIDS COMING OVER FOR PROGRAMS OR ANYTHING. SO THAT'S JUST A COMMUNITY CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:07:13.581: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL MOVE ON TO COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS S. THERE ANY COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS AT THIS TIME? COMMISSIONER MILLS, FOLLOWED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
02:07:32.299: >> Vice Chair Mills: MS. DELEO, IF YOU COULD ADD ON TO MR. LENART'S TO-DO LIST.
02:07:36.937: >> SURE!
02:07:38.839: >> Vice Chair Mills: LOOKING AT JUST -- WE HAVE A RUNNING LIST OF THINGS THAT WE WILL MIGHT PUT ON A WORK PLAN IN THE FUTURE AND LOOKING AT PLANNED PROJECT, LIKE WHAT IS ON THAT LIST OF NINE ITEMS. I THINK GIVING MORE SPECIFICITY TO ALL OF US COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL.
02:07:58.092: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:07:59.426: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WAS WORKING ALONG THAT LINE TOO. I WAS WONDERING IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO TAKE ANY OF THIS BACK TO THE ENERGY GROUP AS PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION TO PERHAPS GET SOME DIRECTION AS TO KIND OF MEANINGFUL STANDARDS, BECAUSE THEY JUST GET THE WHOLE SYSTEM MORE THAN THIS BODY DOES, I THINK. I WOULD BE WILLING TO CONNECT THOSE DOTS IF WE FEEL LIKE IT MAKES SENSE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD.
02:08:33.594: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
02:08:35.095: >> Commissioner Briggs: SINCE WE ARE ADDING TO HIS LIST, LOOK AT ADDING PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIVITY WITHIN -- THAT IS A REQUIREMENT WITHIN PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT, IF THAT'S ANY PLACE THAT WE CAN. I MEAN, IT'S GREAT THAT, -- I THINK WE ALMOST ALWAYS SEE IT WHEN PROJECTS GET TO US, BUT THAT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT. THAT SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SAY, OH, WE PUT A PATH. THAT'S KIND OF NICE.
02:09:00.154: >> Chair Milshteyn: I'M PRETTY SURE MR. LENART IS WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW.
02:09:04.391: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: DO YOU MEAN ALONG DRIVES?
02:09:09.430: >> Commissioner Briggs: FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE PREVIOUS PROJECT, THE DEVELOPER WAS ABLE TO SAY THAT THAT SIDEWALK WAS ABOVE AND BEYOND, AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE ABOVE AND BEYOND. THAT SHOULD BE  A REQUIREMENT OF AL OUR PROJECTS. THAT'S BASIC. SO I THINK IT USUALLY COMES TO US AS PART OF IT BY THE TIME IT GETS TO US, BUT I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANY SORT OF PATTING ON THE BACK FOR THAT.
02:09:33.554: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:09:34.488: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I APPRECIATE THAT IDEA AND I HAD A SIMILAR ONE, THINKING ABOUT HOW WE COULD PROVIDE DIRECTION TO STAFF TO KIND OF EXPEDITE LOOKING AT OUR ZONING CODE FOR THESE SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES, AND GET LIKE THE STAFF SUPPORT NEEDED TO COORDINATE BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION OR THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND -- AND THEN KIND OF BUILD THAT INTO THE BROADER OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITIES PLAN, SO THAT KIND OF ALL THE PIECES ARE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AT THE SAME TIME. SO THAT I CAN TAKE THAT UPON MYSELF. I ADDED THAT TO MY TO-DO LIST AND I CAN KEEP YOU UPDATED AS I PROGRESS.
02:10:22.836: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, I THINK IT'S A HUGE JOB, IN TERMS OF LIKE -- TO TRULY THINK ABOUT HOW WE MARRY THOSE THINGS. THERE'S A LOT OF MINOR TWEAKS THAT I CAN THINK OF, BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME PRETTY HEAVY LIFTS TOO, AND SO WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW -- I MEAN, MAYBE THIS IS A WORKING SESSION, KIND OF HOW WE PHASE THAT, BECAUSE DO WE REALLY WANT THEM TO ALL WAIT FOR THREE YEARS WHILE THEY CHURN THROUGH THE SYSTEM OR ARE THERE SOME THAT MIGHT BE RELATIVELY EASY TO BE ABLEO EXECUTE PRETTY QUICKLY. SO I THINK IT -- I REALLY ALSO WANT TO DO THAT. IT'S -- IT'S A DAUNTING, HUGE THING TO TAKE ON TOO, I THINK, ALSO IN TERMS OF CHANGING OUR CODE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ALL OF THAT.
