00:01:29.345: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S ME. COMMISSIONER WOODS.

00:01:33.882: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:01:38.654: >> Chair Mills: HERE.
00:01:39.154: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
00:01:41.890: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: HERE.
00:01:42.558: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:01:44.360: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: HERE.
00:01:45.294: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:01:47.963: >> Councilmember Ackerman: HERE.
00:01:51.700: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER SAUVE, ABRONS AND HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:02:00.709: >> Chair Mills: DO WE HAVE ANY INTRODUCTIONS?
00:02:02.344: >> Planning Manager:  WE DO NOT.
00:02:06.315: >> Chair Mills: WE ARE ON TO ITEM 4, MOTION TO APPROVE AT AGENDA. ALEX? MOVED BY ALEX AND SECONDED BY ELLIE. I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT -- WAIT. WHAT'S NEXT? DO WE VOTE ON MOVING THE AGENDA?
00:02:19.828: >> Planning Manager:  THERE WAS -- I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE WAS AN UPDATED AGENDA THAT CAME OUT THIS EVENING THAT REMOVES THE MINUTES. WE JUST HAD SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY WITH GTINGHOSE DONE. WE PULLED THAT FROM THE AGENDA AND YOU WILL SEE THAT AT THE NEXT MEETING.
00:02:38.213: >> Chair Mills: GOT IT. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION TO MOVE THE AGENDA AS AMENDED EARLIER TODAY? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ANY OPPOSED? IT DOESN'T LOOKIKE ANYBODY. SO THE MOTION CARRIES. LET'S SEE, ITEM 5 IS TYPICAL MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING. THAT WAS TAKEN OUT. WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE NEXT TIME AROUND. LET'S SEE, ITEM 6 IS REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMUNICATIONS. WRITTEN SO WE'LL START WITH COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN. DO YOU HAVE ANY REPORTS?
00:03:21.990: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES, I DO. ORDINARILY, I WOULD USE THIS TIME TO SHARE AN UPDATE FROM CITY COUNCIL'S MEETING THE NIGHT BEFORE. BECAUSE OF THE PRIMARY YESTERDAY, OUR CITY COUNCIL MEETING WILL OCCUR TOMORROW, THSDAY ON AUGUST 6th. SO INSTEAD, I WILL TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO SHARE THE RESULTS OF TUESDAY'S ELECTION, YESTERDAY'S ELECTION. WITH NEARLY 33,000 ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS PARTICIPATING IN OUR CITY COUNCIL ELECTION, WE HAD OUR LARGEST EVER RECORD-SETTING TURNOUT IN SUCH AN ELEION. THIS -THIS VOTE RESULTED IN QUITE A BIT OF SHAKE-UP AND WILL RESULT IN QUITE A BIT OF TURNOVER ON THE CITY COUNCIL BODY. WINNING IN THE FIRST WARD WAS LISA DISCH, AND THE SECOND SONG. AND THE THIRD, TRAVIS RODINA, WHO WILL FILL MY SEAT IN MY RETIREMENT IN NOVEMBER, AND JANE EYER AND ERICA BRIGGS WHO HAS EARNED A VERY -- WHO HAS EARNED HER NIGHT OFF TONIGHT. THESE MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL -- I SHOULD SAY THEY WON THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, EACH OF WHOM WILL BE UNOPPOSED IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. SO IT IS ALMOST STASTICALLY CEAIN THAT THEY WILL BE OUR NEXT CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES. PRESUMING THEY WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION, THEY WILL TAKE OFFICE NOVEMBER 16th, BEING SWORN IN AT THAT NIGHT'S CITY COUNCIL MEETING. IF COMMISSIONER BRIGGS WISHES TO, IT WOULD BE MY ASSUMPTION SHE WOULD TAKE MY SEAT HERE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION. I INK IT PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT CONTINUITY OF SERVICE AND TENSION OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE THAT I THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE BODY AND THEN HER SEAT WOULD THEN BECOME OPEN FOR A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO JOIN -- TO JOIN THIS BODY. TO THOSE MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL LEAVING OFFICE, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEAD INDICATED SERVICE OVER THE YEARS. WHILE WE CERTAINLY DISAGREED ON VERY IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES SERVING NEIGHBORS IN ELECTED OFFICE IS A DIFFICULT AND NOBLE ENDEAVOR. I THINK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU DESERVES OUR RESPECT AND APPRECIATION. I THINK IT'S ALSO EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EACH WILL TAKE OFFICEFTER WINNING 51 TO 56% OF THEIR VOTE. IN 2018, MAYOR TAYLOR WON WITH NEARLY 60% OF THE VOTE CITYWIDE. THIS GROUP OF ELECTED LEADERS RAN WITH A CLEAR MESSAGE AND PLATFORM. THAT THE STATUS QUO IS LEAVING PEOPLE BEHIND. THAT WE CAN AND WE NEED TO PUSH PROGRESSIVE VALUES AND POLICIES FORWARD TO TRULY BE A WELCOMING COMMUNITY TO ALL. I HOPE THAT THIS BODY WILL IN TURN DO ITS PART TO PUT FORWARD THE BEST RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICIES AND PROJECTS MADE THROUGH PUBLIC LYN INPUT AND FAR DEBATE, FOR THE CLEARLY ARTICULATED VALUES AND VISIONS AS CODIFIEDY LAST NIGHT'S ELECTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, AND IT'S A HAPPY DAY.
00:06:39.187: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER, ACKERMAN. NEXT IS PLANNING MANAGER REPORT, MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE ANY REPORT?
00:06:44.960: >> Planning Manager:  NO REPORT THIS EVENING.
00:06:47.796: >> Chair Mills: DO ANY OTHER COMMISSION OFFICERS OR COMMITTEE LIAISONS HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
00:06:56.405: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, WE ARE KIND OF RESHUFFLING WHO IS ON DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AND THAT MYSELF AND I DON'T KNOW MAERSKY ARE GOING TO LOOK AT OUR CODE IN HOW IT SUPPORTS OR IS IN CARBON NEUTRALITY.203GOALS FOR WE ARE BEGINNING THIS PROCESS. WE HOPE TO GET THROUGH A BIG CHUNK OF IT TO BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK SOME FINDINGS IN OF COURSE. AND SO WE WILL BE KEEPING YOU POSTED AND OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL BE SOME INTERSECTION WITH OUR OWN ORDINANCE REVIEW COMMITTEE AND COMMISSIONER MILLS HAS ALSO AGREED TO BE PART OF THIS EFFORT, EVEN THOUGH SHE'S NOT ON THE ENVONMEAL CMISSION, BUT SHE IS A BIG PART OF THE ORC. SO WE ARE HAPPY, HAPPY TO HAVE HER. SO ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE HAPPENING AND THAT IF THERE'S IDEAS THAT YOU ALL HAVE, HE WOULD BE VERY OPEN TO THEM. SO I JUST WANTED TO REPORT THAT OUT. THANKS.
00:07:55.430: >> Chair Mills: I AM AN ORC JUNKIE. I DOT KNOW. ANY OTHER UPDATES? I CAN UPDATE ON THE ORC MEETING. WE TALKED ABOUT SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED REQUIREMENTS. STAFF IS MOVING FORWARD WITH SOME GUIDANCE FROM ORC ON THAT. WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT REVIEW OF THE C1A, A C1A-R DISTRICT. STAFF BROUGHT TO US SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE TOLD THEM WHAT -- WHAT MORE INFORMATION MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US TO DISCUSS TOGETHER. AND WE ALSO TALKING ABOUT NEW TABLE DESIGN. WE WEIGHED IN ON TABLE DESIGN FOR THE UDC. LAST MEETING WE POSTPONED SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE UDC, AND SOME OF IT WAS JUST KIND OF SCRIVENEERS ERRORS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THOSE REDESIGNED TABLES MAY WELL SHOW UP WHEN WE TAKE THAT UP, I BELIEVE, MR. LENART IS THE NEXT MEETING; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:09:02.397: >> Planning Manager:  AT'S CORRECT.
00:09:04.466: >> Chair Mills: AND TO PIGGYBACK ON WHAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL MENTIONED, THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE, I THINK WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT A HILL BIT AT THE WORKING WORKING -- A LITT AT THE WORKING SESSION. WE NEED TO DO IT AT A REGULAR BUSINESS MEETING TOO. SO KEEP THAT IN YOUR MIND TO THINK ABOUT THAT, THAT THAT'S SO IFOU HAVE DESIRES TO BE ONR THE OR C. OR THINGS LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE, THAT TAKES CARE OF THE OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES. IN TERMS OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS, WE DID RECEIVE SOME TODAY THAT WERE POSTED ONLINE AND ALSO THE COMMENTS SO JUS T NOTE THAT WE HAVEINE THOSE IN YOUR PACKET AND DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THEM. ALL RIGHT. WE ARE ON ITEM NUMBER 7, WHICH IS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY FOR AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION.

00:11:27.909: >> Chair Mills: OH, SIR. SO BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S LISTED ON OUR AGENDA, WE WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THE COMMENT, BUT WE NEED TO TAKE THE COMMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEARG R THAT, WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS.

IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK NOT AUTHE SN ORDINANCE OR ABOUT THE VERIDIAN PROJECT? THOSE ARE THE TWO SUMS ON THE AGENDA FOR TODAY.
00:12:10.218: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  OR OUR BELAWS.

00:12:16.625: >> Planning Manager:  I'M NOT SEEING ANYBODY ELSE.
00:12:20.195: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. THEN WE WILL CLOSE THE AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY LATER ON. THE -- ACTUALLY, I MISSPOKE BECAUSE THIS IS MY FIRST TIME CHAIRING. SO I'M NOT SEU USED TO THIS. THE NEXT ITEM IS PUBLIC HEARINGS
00:12:42.083: >> Plannin Manager:  IN ADDITION TO CHAIR MILLS REFERENCED THE UDC AMENDMENTS THAT WERE POSTPONED FIRST MEETING IN JULY, THOSE WILL BE REAPPEARING ON THE AGENDA AND THEN WE HAVE ONE NEW PUBLIC HEARING ITEM, IT'S FOR 559 RIVERVIEW DRIVE. IT'S A PROPOSED ANNEXATION AND ZONING. IT'S TONNEXROM ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP AND ZONE INTO THE CITY, R1B SINGLE FAMILY TO BE IN SUPPORT OF UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE.
00:13:11.379: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. NOW WE'RE ON TO 9A AND THE FIRST ITEM HERE IS THE SIGN ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS. THESE ARE PROPOSED AMEMESO CHAPTER  IN THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO UPDATE AND MODERNIZE SIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR SIGNAGE. MR. LENART WILL GIVE A PRESENTATION AND THEN WE'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING UP AGAIN FOR THIS ITEM.
00:13:45.981: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AHESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FOR A WHILE, WITH DID REASON. IT'S A COMPLEX ISSUE. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT REASONS THAT WE'RE THERE ARE NUMEROUS GOALS IN LOOKING AT THESE AMENDMENTS. ONE IS TO PROVIDE SOME MODERNIZATION OF OUR SIGN ORDINANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND SIGN INDUSTRY TO THAT MATTER, AS WELL AS RESPOND TO CASE LAW THAT HAS EVOLVED SINCE THE ORIGINAL DRAFTING AND ENACTION OF OUR SIGN ORDINANCE IN THE CURRENT STATE. SO AT THE LAST DISCUSSION, WE HAD ADDRESSED MANY OF THE SORT OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND I'M NOT GOING TO REHASH THOSE AT THIS POINT. THEY ARE REFLECTED IN THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE THAT WAS PRESENTED. BUT THERE WAS A COUPLE OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT WERE OF PARTICULAR DISCUSSION AND UNRESOLVED WHICH BRINGS US TO THIS RECONSIDER CONSCIOUS OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCES. ONE IS THE SPECIFIC TO THE TIMING AND THE DATION OF SIGNAGE WHEN A PROPERTY IS FOR SALE OR LEASE. THE PROPOSED AREA ALLOWED FOR TEMPORARY SIGNAGE, PARTICULARLY IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS, AND THEN THE SORT OF MERITS OF INCLUSION AS AN UNLIMITED TEMPORARY SIGN, AN UNLIMITED NONCOMMERCIAL TEMPORARY SIGN. AND SO THE DRAFT THAT WE HE PRESENTED TO YOU, I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SORT OF PUT TOGETHER OUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN T DRAFT, AND THEN IN THE STAFF REPORT WE HAVE INCLUDED A COUPLE OF ALTERNATIVES IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION DISAGREES WITH STAFF. WE WOULD LIKE TO LAY OUT A FEW OPTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THOSE THE SCENARIOS. THE FIRST IS THE TIME OR THE DURATION THAT A PROPERTY IS UP FOR LEASE OR SALE. WE HAVE GONE IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS ON THIS. WE HAD INCLUDED SOME SPECIFIC EXEMPTION LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROVIDE THAT A TEMPORARY SIGN CAN EXCEED THE MAXIMUM LIMITATION OF DURATION WHICH IS CURRENTLY 65 DAYS WITH A 30-DAYBREAK FROM -- AS IT RELATES TO PERPETUAL DISPLAY. AND SO WHAT STAFF IS PROPOSING IS TO REINSTITUTE LANGUAGE IN THE PREVIOUS DRAFT THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION FROM THAT 65 DURATION FOR AS LONG AS THAT PROPERTY IS FOR LEASE OR SALE. THAT WOULD PROVIDE ALONGER DURATION OF SIGNAGE ON THAT PROPERTY. TO BE CLEAR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A REAL ESTATE SIGN, BUT AS LONG AS THAT PROPERTY WAS FOR SALE OR LEASE, IT WOULD PROVIDE UNEXCEPTION FROM THAT, LIMITED DURATION OFIME. PREVIOUSLY, T THE LATEST ITERATN OF OUR DRAFT, WE WOULD SAY, NO, YOU COULD HAVE A TAKENNOUS DISPLAY OF A -- CONTINUOUS DISPLAY OF A FOR SALE FOR A SALE OR LEASE PERIOD, HOWEVER IT WOULD HAVE TO FLUCTUATE BETWEEN THE STDARD TEMPORARY SIGN, WHICH IS SMALLER IN SIZE. WHEEL THAT PROVIDES SOME PERPETUAL DISPLAY, IT WOULD REQUIRE PHYSICALLY PHYSICAL ADJUSTMENT OF THAT SIGN TO -- POTENTIALLY PHYSICAL ADJUSTMENT OF THAT SIGN TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS. OUR STAFF'S PROPOSAL IS TO RESTORE THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE THAT ESSENTIALLY PROVIDES THAT, AGAIN, THE DURATION EXCEPTION FOR WHEN A PROPERTY IS FOR LEASE OR SALE THAT IT -- PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL AREA, HOW IT DOES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DURATION AND TIME ALTERNATIVELY, THE ORDINANCE COULD REVERT BACK TO THAT ITERATION THAT I JUST DESCRIBED WHERE, AGAIN, A LONGER TE DATION IS ENABLES BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE A BIT OF AT JUOFADJUSTMENT IN THE SIGN TO DISPLAY THE MESSAGE. THAT WAS AREA ONE. THE SECOND AREA THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION WAS THE AREA OF TEMPORARY SIGNAGE AVAILABLE TO RESIDENTIAL USAGES. I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS DISCUSSED WAS WHETHER OR N 12 SQUARE FOOT MAXIMUM WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE SIZE FOR THAT SIGNAGE. STAFF'S ASSERTION IS THAT IT IS. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE GONE OUT AND PROVIDED SOME EXAMPLE OF SIGNAGE THAT WE THINK WOULD MEET THE TEST. THE MAJORITY OF SIGNAGE DOES MEET THAT SIZE REQUIREMENT. SO WE WOULD NOT PROPOSE EXPANDING THAT AREA. IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION DID DECIDE TO DO THAT. ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS WAS TRYING TO PUT A LIMITATION ON A SINGLE FACE ASPECT OF THAT, SO THAT IF THE SIZE WERE INCREASED, IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RESULT IN A INAPPPRIATELY LARGE SINGLE FACE SIGN BECAUSE ALL OF OUR SIGNS WERE SORT OF OR MEASUREMENT IS UNIFORM, BE IT ONE SIZ SIDES OR TWO SIDE. WE COULD HAVE A MAXIMUM SIGN AREA OF 20 SQUARE FEET WITH NO SINGLE FACE. SO YOU COULD HAVE UP TO A 10 SQUARE FOOT SIGN. THE CURRENT 12 FEET APPEARS TO BE ADEQUATE FROM OUR RECOMMENDATION. AND THEN FINAL Le, ONE OF THE OUTSANDTING POINTED FROM THE OF WTHER OR NOT W SHOULDRITS INCLUDE AN UNLIMITED TEMPORARY SIGN. I DON'T THINK THIS HAD QUITE AS MUCH DISCUSSION AS THE PREVIOUS TWO ITEMS, BUT IT WAS RAISED IN THAT DISCUSSION IN SHORT, STAFF BELIEVES THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED. WE BELIEVE PROVIDING SOME FLEXIBLE AND ONGOING FREE SPEECH STUDENT SHOULD OUTWEIGH ANY AESTHETIC CONCERNS OR RESTRAINTS THAT WE ENVISION FOR OUR COMMUNITY. WE WOULD RECOMMEND MAINTAINING THAT UNLIMITED NONCOMMERCIAL SIGN. BUT YOU AS THE WORD WOULD REVISIT THAT. A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE. IN SORT OF FINALIZING SOME OF THESE PROPOSAL, SHOULD IT PROVIDE FOR A HIGHER SIG THEY A BETEN 5 AND 6 FEET. IT'S CURRENTLY 5 FEET, FROM AI STAFF PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T SEE THAT HEIGHT DIFFERENCE OF 5 TO . IT SEEMS VERY CONVENTIONAL AND CONSISTENT. IT SEEMS PRETTY WIDE SPREAD. SO WE WOULD CONSIDER POTENTIALLY THOSE SIGNS TO 5 AND A HALF TO T CONVENTION. SHOULD THE MAXIMUM AREA OF UNLIMITED SIGNS BE INCREASED FROM MAXIMUM OF 3 SQUARE FEET TO 6 SQUARE FEET, CURRENTLY THAT UNLIMITED SIGN PROVISION IS GOING TO PROVIDE BASICALLY A SINGLE SIDED TEMPORARYIG I THINK IT WOULD BE TO PROVIDE UP TO A 6 SQUARE FOOT SIGN, THAT COULD RESULT IN A SINGLE FACE SIGN THAT'S 6 SQUARE FEET AS WELL. I THINK THAT FLEXIBILITY FOR PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD BE POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL. WE HAVE ADDED A PROVISION AND DEFINITION TO ACCOMMODATE THE USE OF NONCOMMERCIAL FLAGS. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE SAID THAT FLAGGED ARE PERMITTED IN THE CITY OF NONCOMMERCIAL, UP TO A TOTAL SQUARE FOOT AREA AND THEY ARE NOT COUNTED TOWARDS SIGNAGE. IF YOU WANT AN AMERICAN FLAG, OR ANY NONCOMMERCIAL MESSAGING FLAG, I WLD NOT COUNT TO ANY SIGNAGE IN THE CITY. AND THEN WE LOOK AT HOW WE MEASURE BUSINESS FRONTAGE. THE SIGN AREA IS CALCULATED ON FRONT OF BUSINESS. IT'S VERY SPECIFICALLY ORIENTED TO PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS ATTEMPTED TO CLARIFY THAT DEFINITION TO PROVIDE THAT IF IT'S MEASURED EITHER ALONG A PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY OR WN THAT SPACE IS FRONTING ON TO A SHARED ACCESS DRIVE OR SHARED PARKING LOT IN THE CASE OF A MULTI TENANT BUILDING. YOU MAY HAVE IT ORIENTED P P   R PERPENDICULARLY. 'LL THEN NOT INCLUDED IN THE STAFF REPORT, AND ONE THING I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT FROM A -- THE DRAFT ORDINANCE PROVIDES SOME PROTECTION FOR NON-CONFORMING SIGNS THAT ARE OVER 200 SQUARE FEET. THIS SORT OF T CURRENT VERSION OF EXISTING LANGUAGE IN THE CODE THAT PROVIDES LANGUAGE FOR EXISTING BILLBOARDS IN THE COMMUNITY, BUT BECAUSE OF THE 200 SQUARE FOOT SIZE LIMITATION WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THOSE IN THE FUTURE. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THAT RIGHT NOT BE EXCLUSIVE TO BILLBOARDS. IT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER GNS OVER 200 SARE FEET. I HAVE PULLED UP A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU, BUT GENERALLY, YOU CAN THINK OF SOME OF LARGER BUSINESS CENTER OR BUSINESS SIGNS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT MIGHT ALSO MEET THAT THRESHOLD. THAT WOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME PROTECTION OF ADDITIONAL SIGN AREA THAT IS NOT COUNTED TOWARDS THAT OF THEUSINES AGAIN, IN THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION, IT'S LIGHTLY MORE EXPANSIVE THAN I ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED. I DON'T THINK IT'S PROBLEM ECK. PROBLEMATIC, BUT I WANTED THE PLANNING COMMISSIONING TO AWARE OF IT. I WILL STOP THERE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE STAFF REPORT, I HAVE A PRESENTATION WHERE WE CAN PULL UP SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLE SIGNS.
00:24:26.020: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. NOW WE'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HEARING FEEDBACK. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AMDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 OF THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 1-877-853-5247, AND THEN ENTERING MEETING ID  9771150114. WE WILL SELECT CALLERS WHO RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE, IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND, AFTER DIALING INTO THE MEETING, YOU PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK AND WHEN YOU SPEAK, PLEASE DO MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MU MUTE  ANY TELEVISIOR BACKGROUND SOUNDS AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COMMENTS.
00:25:33.754: >> Planning Manager:  ALL RIGHT, SIR.
00:25:35.489: >> HELLO ONCE AGAIN.
00:25:37.124: >> Planning Manager:  YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES.
00:25:39.160: >> MY NAME IS TOM RENTKIRK THE ASSOCIATION EXECUTIVE FOR THE ANN ARBOR BOARD OF REALTORS. WE LOCATED AT 1919 WEST STADIUM. I'M COMMTING PRIMARILY ON THE CITY STAFF REPORT FOR THE PROPOSED SITE THAT WAS PUBLISHED ON THE COMMISSION'S WEBSITE. THEY STRIKE TO PROPOSE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS SIGNS OF PROPERTIES ADVERTISED FOR SALE OR LEASE, TO REMAIN IN PLACE 65 DAYS. UNLESS THE SIGN IS CLASSIFIED AS UNLIMITED -- AS AN UNLIMITED AND A SIZEF N MORE THAN 3 OR, POSSIBLY SIX FEETF YOU CHOOSE TO EXPAND THAT. ONE THING I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE AWARE, THAT AS OF YESTERDAY, THEY WERE 285 HOMES LISTED FOR SALE IN THE MULTIPLE LISTING SERVICE WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF ANN ARBOR. 116 OF THOSE 285 HOMES THAT ARE RRENTLY LISTEDOR SALE HAVE A DAYS ON MARKET GREATER THAN 65 DAYS. SO ROUGHLY 41% OF THE PROPERTIES ON THE MARKET TODAY, WHEN PROPERTIES ARE SELLING FAIRLY FAST, ARE ALREADY BEYOND THE 65 DAY MAXIMUM CAP THAT'S BEING CONSIDERED. STRIKING THE LANGUAGE AND REQUIRING A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE SIZE OF THE SIGN FOR PROPERTIES, ADVERTISED FOR SALE BEYOND 65 DAYS, WILL UNFAIRLY TREAT HOMEOWNERS IN CERTAIN AREAS AT CERTAIN PRICE POINTS OR SIMPLY HOMES THAT ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO SALE. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS MAY VERY WELL, YOU KNOW, HAVE SOME FAIR HOUSING CONCERNS. WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU KEEP THE EXCEPTION LANGUAGE IN PLACE, THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED FOR PROPERTIES LISTED FOR SALE OR LEASE. AS INDICATED IN THE STAFF REPORT, MOST OF THE FOR SALE SIGNS FALL WITHIN THE 12 SQUARE FEET REQUIREMENT. THE THING IS, IT'S A COMMON PRACTICE IN ANN ARBOR, IN OUR MARKET FOR HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE ADVERTISING THEIR HOMES FOR SALE, FOR THEM TO PROMOTE THEIR HOMES AS AN OPEN HOUSE ON WEEKENDS. IN DOING SO, THEY AAYS PLACE A SECOND SIGN ON THE PROPERTY. IN MOST CASES, THAT SECOND SIGN WILL INCREASE THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE ABOVE THE 12 FEET REQUIREMENT, PLACING THEM OUTSIDE THE ORDINANCE, ON WEEKENDS WHEN THEY ARE ADVERTISING THEIR OPEN HOUSES. WE WOULD PROPOSE AN INCREASE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WERE DISCUSSING BEFOR WE WER SUGGESTING AT LEAST 16 SQUARE FEET AS A MAXIMUM WITH SOME TYPE OF SINGLE FACE OF 10 OR 12 FEET. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE THINKING OF THOSE SAME LINES SO THAT MIGHT POTENTIALLY ACCOMMODATE THAT.
00:28:11.612: >> Planning Manager:  30 MORE SECONDS, SIR.
00:28:17.852: >> THE HEIGHT OF THE SIGNS THEY ARE ABOV 5 FEET WITH THE MAXIMUM OF 6 FEET. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THEY ARE NO MORE THAN 6 FEET. THIS IS A LONG ANTICIPATED STANDARD IN THE MARKETPLACE. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL AT 734-822-2265. THANK YOU.
00:28:43.544: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE NIP E ANYONE ELIMINATIN THE LINE WHO WOULD LIKE -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING? IF SO, YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE.
00:29:00.261: >> Planning Manager:  I SEE NOBODY ELSE.
00:29:03.297: >> Chair MillsAL RIGHT SO WEILL CLOSE T PUBC HEARING FOR THIS. I WILL READ THE MOTION -- READ THE PROPOSED MOTION AND ASK FOR A COMMISSIONER TO MOVE THE MOTION. SO THE PROPOSED MOTION READS: THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTI 5.24 AND RELATED REFERENCES. THAT MOTION IS MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS, AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. WE'RE OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.
00:29:43.437: >> Planning Manager:  I WANT TO CLARIFY TO THE SPEAKER'S POINT, THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS NOT TO STRIKE THAT LANGUAGE AND RETAIN THAT LANGUAGE. THE STAFF REPORT LANGUAGE THAT INDICATES THAT STRIKING WOULD BE IF THE COMMISSION WERE INTERESTED IN REVERTING BACK TO THAT REQUIREMENT OF SHIFTING BETWEEN UP TO 12 SQUARE FOOT TEMPORARY SIGN DOWN TO A 3 SQUARE FOOT LANGUAGE, WOULD YOU NEED TO STRIKE THAT LANGUAGE OUT OF THE DRAFT.
00:30:10.264: >> Chair Mills: YOU ALREADY MADE THOSE CHANGES. THAT WAS ONE THE THINGS I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT AS WELL.
00:30:32.186: >> Commissioner Sauve: THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS BACK TOGETHER. I WANT TO CLARIFY IN TERMS OF THE COURT, LIKE, DECISIONS ABOUT SALE AND LEASE AND IF -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT ACTUALLY SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT LANGUAGE. IT'S SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT USE. IS THAT -- WOULD THAT BE AN INTERPRETATION?
00:30:49.570: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH. I DON'T- I HAVE TO BE HONEST, WHY SIT HERE AND TELL YOU THE EXACT NUANCES OF RETAINING THIS PROVISION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION. AS A REMINDER FOR EVERYBODY, THE SUPREME COURT DECISION TO GREATLY OVERSIMPLIFY IS THAT A SIGN ORDINANCE THAT REQUIRES YOU TO SORT OF READ THE CONTENT IS INAPPRRIATE. D SO I THINK THAT'S THE DISTINCTION HERE IS THAT WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT REAL ESTATE SIGNSAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE EXHIBITED DURING A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THE PROPERTY IS FOR SALE OR LEASE, BUT RATHER A SIGN IS ABLE TO BE DISPLAYED DURING THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. AND SOTAFF BIEVES THAT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT. I THINK THAT IF THIS WAS A QUESTION, IT'S PROBABLY THE AVAILABLE OF THAT SIGNAGE TO THAT PROPERTY, GIVEN THAT USE STATUS, VERSUS A SIMILARLY SITUATED PROPERTY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT USE STATUS. BUT AT THE SAME TOKEN, I THINK THAT THERE IS JUST SORT OF A -- I CAN'T SAY LEG, BUT LEGAL, BUT EXPERIENTIAL REFERENCE POINT THAT SIGNAGE IS UTILIZED VERY COMMONLY, WHEN PROPERTIES ARE FOR SALE OR LEASE. THE SHORT IS I THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH CASE LAW TO MY KNOWLEDGE BY BEING CLEAR WE ARE JUST PRODING LONGER DURATION OF SIGNAGE WHEN YOUR PROPERTY IS FOR SALE OR LEASE. WE ARE NOT SAYING IT HAS TO BE A FOR SALE OR LEASE SIGN. BUT THAT CONDITION WILL GRANT YOU MORE TIME.
00:32:30.104: >> Commissioner Sauve: GOT IT. THAT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU. I WILL PUT THIS OUT FOR THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THEIX FEET AND THE SIZE IS AS ROE POSED. I THINK THERE'S SMALL CHANGED THAT WE WON'T SEE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE VISUALS AS TO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT HERE. I'M SATISFIED WITH WHERE STAFF HAS BROUGHT THIS OVER THE PAST YEAR. THANK YOU.
00:33:08.008: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER WOODS FOLLOWED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
00:33:10.244: >> Commissioner Woods: THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THE PICTURES THIS TIME, MR. LENART. I THINK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. THERE'S ONE PLACE --
00:33:17.217: >> Planning Manager:  COURTESY OF MR. CHENG, ACTUALLY.
00:33:20.654: >> Commissioner Woods: THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE -- AND IT MAY BE THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE PICTURES ON MY iPNEHILE I TALKING ON MY LAPTOP. BUT ANYWAY, I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE, I THINK IT'S LAST SET OF OR THE SECOND TO THE LAST SET OF PICTURES. ONE IS MR. McGEE WHO IS RUNNING FOR SHERIFF. WHAT WAS THAT AN EXAMPLE OF? WAS THAT AN EXAMPLE OF A LARGE SIGN GOING -- THAT WAS GOING TO MEET THAT 6-FOOT?
00:33:51.051: >> Planning Manager:  NO. NO. THAT WOULD NOT MEET THE TEMPORARY SIGN REQUIREMENTED.
00:33:57.291: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY.
00:33:57.891: >> Planning Manager:  AND TO BE CLEAR -- WELL, TO BE FUZZY, MANY OF THESE SIGNS COULD BE CATEGORIZED AS MULTIPLE SIGNED. SIGNS.THIS WAS TO PROVIDE THE TF SIGNS THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY THE CITY'S DESIRE TO KEEP AN UNLIMITED SIGN DURATION. BUT A BL BLACK LIVES MATTERS SIN COULD BE AN UNLIMITED SIGN UNDER THE DESIGNATED SIGN AREA. IT COULDE POSSIBLY A 12 GENTLEMA12 SQUAREFOOT FIND THATE 65 DAY RULE AND REMOVED FOR 30 DAYS. THE INTHE INTENTION WAS TO PROVE SOME EXAMPLES IN SUPPORT OF STAFF'S PERSPECTIVE THAT WE THINK IT'S WORTH WHILE TO ACCOMMODATE THESE KINDS OF EXPRESSIONS.
00:34:56.984: >> Commissioner Woods: AND IF SOMEONE HAD AN OBJECTION TO A SIGN, STAFF IS NOT GOING OUT LOOKING FOR SIGNED, RIGHT?
00:35:04.992: >> Planning Manager:  NO. NO. AND I THINK.
00:35:08.028: >> Commissioner Woods: NOT AT THIS POINT, HMM?
00:35:09.329: >> Planning Manager:  AND THAT'S A -- THAT'S A FAIR CRITIQUE. THESE TYPES OF SIGNS ARE KNOLL T GOING TO REQUIRE A PERMIT. WE WON'T HAVE SOMETHING ON FILE THAT SAYS IT WENT UP ON AUGUST 5th AND IT MUST COMDOWN. IF A COMPLAINT COMES UP, WE WILL DOCUMENT AS EARLY AS WE CAN AS TO WHEN THAT SIGN WAS ESTABLISHED AND THEN MEASURING 65 DS, BUT THE -- U ARE RIGHT. WE ARE NOT ACTIVELY OUT O A ROUTINE BASIS RESOURCING PEOPLE LOOKING AT -- INVENTORY SIGNS ON A REGULAR BASIS TO QUOTE/UNQUOTE CATCH ONE OR ENSURE COMPLIANCE. IT WOULD BE IMPERFECT, BUT AT DURATION TIMESHAT AT LEASTZE AND GIVES US SOME TO GO MEASURE WHENEVER WE GET TO THEM.
00:36:04.484: >> Commissioner Woods: AND THAT INCLUDES REAL ESTATE SIGNS AS WELL, RIGHT?
00:36:07.220: >> Planning Manager:  YEP. UNDER THIS PROVISION, HOWEVER, AS THE ORDINANCE IS PRESENTED TO YOU, THAT WOULD BE AN EXCEPTION WHERE IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO THE 65 DAYS AS LONG AS THAT PROPERTY IS FOR SALE O LEASE, YOU COULD MAINTAIN IT AND IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE A PERMIT.
00:36:24.905: >> Commissioner Woods: GOOD. I THINK SO MANY OF THE ORDINANCES THAT WE HAVE -- SOMETIMES -- WE JUST WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT DON'T GO OUT AN TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS. IF YOU THINK SOMEONE HAS A SIGN UP FOREVER. YOU COULD SAY, IT LOOKS LIKE OH, , I SOLDTAST MONTH. THE SIGN IS STILL THERE? I DON'T KNOW. BUT ANYWAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT STAFF IS NOT MAKING THIS A FULL-TIME JOB.
00:36:58.405: >> Planning Manager:  AND FRANKLY, THE SALES WE GET NOTICE OF THEM FROM THE ASSESSING, AND HELEASES ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.
00:37:10.250: >> Commissioner Woods: THANK YOU.
00:37:11.818: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
00:37:13.653: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: TO MR. LEONARD, MR. CHENG, EVERYBODY IN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT, ALL THE CITY AND STAFF, WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND I WILL TAKE SOME APOGIZE.LITYOR THAT I I FEEL LIKE WE ARE SO CLOSE. I A REALLY HAVE TWO MORE THINGSO TWEAK. THE FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE TEMPORARY SIGN HEIGHT, AND I WHAT IS CURRENT IN THEA FROM AMENDMENT TO 6 FEET. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THA MOTION TO AMEND THAT, JUST LOOKING AT THE IMAGES YOU PROVIDED, PLUS, YOU KNOW, MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I THINK 6 FEET WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE HEIGHT. I WOULD HIKE TO MOVE THAT, MADAM CHAIR, IF THAT'S OKAY?
00:38:06.606: >> Chair Mills: THAT IS. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. MAKING SURE PARTICULARLY PROCEDURE. WE ARE DISCUSSING NOW THAT PROPOSED AMENDMENT.
00:38:17.784: >> Planning Manager:  SO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD AMEND THE CURRENT DRAFT TO PROVIDE 5-FOOT HIGH TEMPORARY MAXIMUM SIGN TO A 6-FOOT HIGH?
00:38:28.428: >> Chair Mills: THAT'S IN TABLE 5.24-6, JUS TOAKE SURE I'M CLEAR. THE TOP - EFFECTIVELY THE FIRST WHITE ROW. ANY COMMENTS OR DISCUSSION HERE? LET'S VOTE ON THAT AMENDMENT. ROLL CALL OR --
00:38:50.584: >> Planning Manager:  I'M COMFORTABLE UNLESS ANY COMMISSIONER COULD REQUEST ROLL CALL. I THINK WE CAN DO IT BY VOICE.
00:38:59.226: >> Chair Mills: ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT, PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HANDS. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. THAT'S UNANIMOUS. SO NOW WE HAVE AN AMENDED MOTION. YOUR NEXT POINT.
00:39:15.375: >> Commiioner Milseyn: MY NEXT POINT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT MANY RENTKIRK FROM THE ANN ARBOR BOARD OF REALTORS CAME FORWARD WITH WITH REGARDS TO PROPERTIES THAT HAVE OPEN HOUSES, ALTHOUGH OPEN HOUSES ARE NOT A LGBT THING RIGHT NOW DURING THE -- ARE NOT A REGULAR THING RIGHT NOW DURING LID POINT WHE THERE'S AN OPENY HOUSE OCCURRING, THERE ARE'S ISN ADDITIONAL SIGN IN FRONT OF HOUSE THAT IS ROUGHLY 2 BY 3 OR SO, SOMETIMES LARGER. SO I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF AMENDING THE 12-FOOT SIZEF A SIGN, 12 SQUARE FEET TO 16 SQUARE FEET TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT -- FOR A POTENTIAL OPEN HOUSE SIGN THAT'S BEING PLACED SO THAT OPEN HOUSE SIGNS ARE LEGAL IN ANN ARBOR. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT AND I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSION ON THAT AS WELL.
00:40:19.172: >> Chair Mills: DOES ANYONE SECOND THATROPOSED AMEND? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS. NOW WE ARE IN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AMENDMENT TO CHANGE THAT. COMMISSIONER ABRONS AND THEN COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL.
00:40:32.752: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I THOUGHT THE 12 SQUARE FOOT LIMITATION WAS PER SIGN. SO COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE OPEN HOUSE SIGNS WOULD BE LARGER, ONE SINGLE SIGN WOULD BE LARGER THAN 12 SQUARE FEET? YEAH, THE 12 IS NOT TOTAL, RIGHT?
00:40:50.737: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: MY UNDERSTANDING WAS 12 WAS TOTAL. MR. LENART IS THAT --
00:40:54.908: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IF I LOOK AT THE TABLE, IT SAYS PER SIGN. MAXIMUM SIGN AREA PER SIGN.
00:41:00.447: >> Planning Manager:  IF YOU LOOK INTOHE -- IF YOU LOOK TO THE LEFT, THOUGH, IT DOES CREATE A MAXIMUM OF 12 SQUARE FEET AS WELL.
00:41:12.792: >> Chair Mills: PER LOT.
00:41:13.326: >> Planning Manager:  PER LOT.
00:41:14.361: >> Commissioner Abrons:  GOT IT. THEN I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT. YEAH. MAKES SENSE. SO WE ARE EXTENDING THE MAXIMUM PER LOT, AND NOT PER SIGN?
00:41:31.678: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I WOULD BE TOTALLY FINE WITH THAT.
00:41:34.381: >> Chair Mills: THAT'S STILL THEN -- THAT THEN WOULD ALLOW FOR THIS GAP, LIKE YOUR MAX MUCH WE ARE LOT AND MAXIMUM PER SIGN ARE NOT THE SAME. SO THERE'S STILL A MAXIMUM ON HOW BIG ANY ONE SIGN. COISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
00:41:49.829: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT WAS MY QUESTION TOO. I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF HAVING MORE SIGN AREA. I DON'T WAY A GINORMOUS SIGN, IF THERE'S A WAY TO DISTINGUISH THAT IT SIG KIND OF HAS TO BE TR WE HAVE A SEPARATE PROVISION THAT TALKS ABOUT OPEN HOUSE SIGNS CAN BE UP FOR 24 HOURS AND IT HAS A DIMENSION TO IT. CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S CONTENT RELATED.
00:42:12.852: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH. YOU COULD ALLOW -- YOU COULD SAY ANY SIGN YOU WANT COULD BE UP FOR UP TO 24 HOURS.
00:42:22.162: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: GOT IT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT CREATING A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE A BIG SIGN BECAUSE IT ACCOMMODATES BOTH OF THOSE. AS LONG AS OUR AMENDMENT DOESN'T MAKE IT THAT YOU COULD HAVE ONE GINOROUS SIGN. MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S WIGGLE ROOM TO MAKE ONE BIGGER I THINKS PPOSED, IT'S A TOTAL INCREASE OF SIGN AREA OF AN ADDITIONAL 4 SQUARE FEET. IT WOULD NOT INCREASE THE MAXIMUM SQUARE FEET. IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT MAX, YOU ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO COMBINE A SQUARE FOOT SIGN AND A 12 SQUARE FOOT SIGN.
00:43:13.646: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: L RIGHTY. THEN I'MN SUPRT OF THAT.
00:43:16.116: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S BASED ON T MOTION AND THE DISCUSSION. IT'S JUST AMENDING THE PER LOT MAXIMUM AREA UP TO 16 SQUARE FEET INSTEAD OF 12 SQUARE FEET.
00:43:32.799: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: BASED ON THE MATH THAT COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN GAVE, YOP I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S ENOUGH THOUGH. IF AN OPEN HOUSE SIGN IS 3 BY 2, THAT'S SIX SQUARE FEET, IS THAT ONE SIDE OF IT, ALEX OR IS THAT
00:43:48.381: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: THAT' S ONE SIDE OF IT.
00:43:53.653: >> Chair Mills: FOUR SQUARE FEET, WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PICTURES THAT THEY ARE NOT ALL THE FULL 12 SQUARE FEET TO START WITH. SO I - I THINK LIKE IF YOU START WITH A 10 SQUARE FOOT SIGN THAT SEEMS TO BE REASONABLE, THE HANGING SIGNS WITHOUT THE TOPS OR BOTTOMS THINGS ON THEM. THEN 10 SQUARE FEET SEEMS REASONABLE. WE INCREASE THE TOTAL AREA, NOT WE ARE SIGN BUT PER LOT TO 20. WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS LIKE WE ARE TRYING TO DO THIS TO ALLOW FOR OPEN HOUSE SIGNS AND THEN IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT MATH, AND THEN NOT ALLOW FOR IT ANY WAY.
00:44:34.594: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I WAS TRYING TO BE KIND. I'M TOTALLY GOOD WITH ANYTHING MORE THAN 16. I THINK IT DEFINITELY HELPS THE REAL ESTATE COMMUNITY.
00:44:54.247: >> Chair Mills: THERE'S DIFFERENT SIGNS TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THIS. ONE OF THE OPTIONS MIGHT BE 20, WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE THE TWO, YOU KNOW, REINHARDT HANGING SIGNS WITHOUT THE HEADER, WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM OPEN THE BOTTOM OR ON THE TOP. SO I --
00:45:17.637: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: IT WON'T BE A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT FOR ME.
00:45:20.773: >> Chair Mills: THAT'S A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT. ELLIE SECONDED IT. AND IT'S FRIENDLY? OK. I GUESS WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING IS TOTAL LOT -- TOTAL AREA OF SIGNAGE FOR THE TEMPORARY SIGNS TO BE 20 SQUARE FEET, KEEPING IN MIND THAT ONLY ONE SIGN CAN BE 20 SQUARE FEET AND IF IT'S A DOUBLE SIDED SIGN AND YOU HAVE A MESSAGE ON BOTH SIDES, IT'S ONLY 6 SQUARE FEET EFFECTIVELY, BECAUSE YOU COUNT BOTH SIGNS FOR THE ONE SIGN THAT'S DOUBLE SIDED IS YOU COUNT BOTH AS -- IT'S CONSIDERED AS ONE SIGN?
00:45:58.878: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S 12 SQUARE FEET OF SIGN AREA.
00:46:03.950: >> Chair Mills: I CALLER. WHICH IN MY MIND SEEMS REASONABLE.
00:46:17.797: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THIS IS FOR MULTIFAMILY OF RECEIVEN UNITS AND -- SEVEN UNITS AND MORE, ALL OF THOSE CATEGORIES? I GUESS IT'S SPLIT INTO TWO, RIGHT? I WANT TO VERIFY THAT IT'S NOT ONE OR THE OTHER, THAT THEY GO FROM 12 TO 20. I SUPPORT IT. I ALSO SEE THE BENEFIT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MULTIFAMILY THAT THEY ARE NOT SHARING THE MAXIMUM 12 SQUARE FEET AND IT DOES SPLIT IT UP FOR SIGNS SO WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIFAMILY, MULTIPLE HOUSE HOLDS CAN GET A PART OF A SIGN THERE. SO BEYONREAL ESTAT THERE DOES ALSO GIVE MORE AREA IN DISTRIBUTED SIGNAGE FOR MORE WAYS TO PRESENT YOUR VALUES ON SIGNS. I THINK IT'S GOOD.
00:47:09.215: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT?
00:47:13.553: >> Planning Manager:  CAN I MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR ON O INTENTION HERE? THE AMENDED -- THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD INCREASE THE MAXIMUM SIGN AREA FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL, JUST FOR FREE STANDING SIGNS FROM A MAXIMUM OF 12 SQUARE FEET TO A MAXIMUM OF 20 SQUARE FEET. D WOULD NOT CHANGEHE SINGLE PER SIZE SIGN OF 12 SQUARE FEET?
00:47:45.485: >> Chair Mills: THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND THE READING OF THE TABLE WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD CHANGE THE NUMBER IN TWO PLACES?
00:47:50.523: >> Planning Manager:  YEP. I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THANK YOU.
00:47:56.162: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. I'M FINEITH THIS.mschmidt: I HAVE A CLARIFY SPEAKING. WHEN THE CALLER WAS SPEAKING, I WAS THINKING, COULDN'T THAT BE THE UNLIMITED SIGN, BUT I'M READING, THIS THE UNLIMITED SIGN COUNTS TOWARDS THAT 12 OR 20 OR WHATEVER SQUARE FEET? NO?
00:48:13.546: >> Planning Manager:  NO. IT WOULD HAVE TO -- THE UNLIMITED SIGN HAS TO BE OF A NONCOMMERCIAL MESSAGE TO DO THAT.
00:48:20.853: >>ommissioner Hammerschmidt: GOTCHA. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. OKAY. BECAUSE I'M LOOKING -- BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT THE TEMPORARY SIGNS THING -- IS IT REFERENCING THE RIGHT TABLE, THOUGH? I GUESS THIS IS OFF TOPIC A LITTLE BIT. THAT WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THE MAX SIGN AREA, PERIOD. NOW I'M GETTING CONFUSED AND MAYBE I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE RIGHT TABLE. NONCOMMERCIAL MESSAGE BUT THE COMMERCIAL MESSAGE -- OH, LORD, GUYS. I'M SORRY. SO THE TEMPORARY SIGN TLE, TH CAN BE COMMERCIAL MESSAGES?
00:49:06.365: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
00:49:07.500: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THE UNLIMITED SIGN CANNOT BE A COMMERCIAL MESSAGE?
00:49:12.305: >> Planning Manager:  CORRECT.
00:49:12.939: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: BUT THE UNLIMITED SIGN COUNTS TOWARDS THAT MAX?
00:49:23.282: >> Chair Mills: WHAT YOU ARE TALKING IS THAT IT'S REFERENCING I BELIEVE TH 24-4, RIGHT?
00:49:27.954: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH.
00:49:29.355: >> Chair Mills: AND THAS AN OLD REFERENCE.
00:49:31.524: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK IT'S SIX. WE SINCE ADDED THE PUD TABLES. I'M SORRY. THAT'S A REFERENCE I DIDN'T CATCH.
00:49:39.499: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: BUT IT DOES COUNT -- IT DOES COUNT TOWARDS THAT MAX, JUST FOR MY UNDERSTANDING? SO IF THE MAX IS 20 AND YOU HAVE A REAL ESTATE AND ONOUSE SIGNND YOURE AT, 20 YOU CAN'T HAVE AN UNLIMITED SIGN IN YOUR YARD AS WELL?
00:49:53.146: >> Planning Manager:  CORRECT.
00:49:55.615: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. I'M GOOD.
00:49:56.883: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. ANY OTHER -- COMMISSIONER WOODS AND THEN COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
00:50:05.224: >> Commissioner Woods: I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE POINT THAT SHE JUST MADE, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT WHEN SHE SAID YOU COULDN'T HAVE AN UNLIMITED SIGN AS WELL. IF YOUR  UNLIMITED SIGN IS AN OPEN HOUSE FOR YOUR CHILD, COULD YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THAT SIGN THERE, PLUS THE REAL ESTATE SIGN, PLUS AN OPEN HOUSE SIGN.
00:50:28.548: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: NOT IF IT GOES ABO 20 UARE FEET.
00:50:33.019: >> Commissioner Woods: BUT WHY NOT?
00:50:34.287: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: BECAUSE IT SAYS IN THE ORDINANCE THAT IT COUNTS SORDS THE MAXIMUM.
00:50:40.693: >> Commissioner Woods: I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE A RARE OCCURRENCE. IT MIGHT HAPPEN AND IT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE FAIR. I HAVE A REAL ESTATE SIGN ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON, AND I HAVE -- THAT HANGING SIGN OR SOMETHING SANG, YOU KNOW, OPEN HOUSE OR SOMETHING AND LET'S SAY THAT THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER BRING ME UP TO THE 20, BUT IT'S ALSO MY DAUGHTER'S OPEN HOUSE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, AND WE STICK OUT THAT SIGN. TO LET PEOPLE KNOW, THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD COME. SO I WOULD BE IN VIOLATION?
00:51:16.596: >> Planning Manager:  YES. YOU WOULD BE OVER 20 SQUARE FEET.
00:51:21.367: >> Planning Manager:  YOU CAN PULL DOWN YOUR REAL ESTATE SIGN OR THE OPEN HOUSE SIGN OR THE DAUGHTER'S GRADUATION SIGN. THIS IS LIMITING YOU TO A TOTAL AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE.
00:51:32.345: >> Commissioner Woods: OH.
00:51:32.912: >> Planning Manager:  PLANNING COMMISSION COULD GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND SAY WE DON'T CARE HOW MAN SIGNEOU HAVE AS LONG AS THEY ARE UNDER 12 FEET. THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THAT YOU COULD HAVE A REAL ESTATE SIGN, AN OPEN HOUSE, A GRADUATION AND YOU COULD HAVE WE SUPPORT HEALTHCARE WORKERS. SO THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY, BUT RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE ARE PUTTING A TOTAL CAP ON THE AREA THAT W THINK IS REASONABLE TO PROVIDE SOM FLEXIBILITY, BUT IT'S NOT UNLIMITED WHERE YOU WILL HAVE TO AT TIMES MAKE SOME CHOICES. THE UNLIMITED SIGN ARGOSIES A PORTION OF THAT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT DOWN AFTER 65 DAYS. WE ARE PROVIDING A -- AN EXCEPTION FROM TIME, BUT NOT AREA FOR A NONCOERCI MESSAGE.
00:52:22.194: >> Commissioner Woods: DOESN'T THAT ALSO THEREFORE MEAN THAT YOU COULD NOT, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE A -- A SIGN WHEN IT PEOPLE DEVOTE FOR SOMEONE FOR PRESIDENT, AS WELL AS FOR STATE REPRESENTATIVE, AS WELL AS FOR SENATOR, AND YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL OF THOSE SIGNS IN YOUR YARD AT THE SAME TIME?
00:52:40.212: >> Planning Manager:  YOU COULD HAVE UP TO 20 SQUARE FEET OF THOSE SIGNS UP T A PERIOD OF 65 DAYS AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE TURNED DOWN FOR 30 DAYS. THAT 65 DAYS ACTUALLY REFERENCES SOME ELECTION LAW TIME FRAME. SO WE ACTUALLY -- ONE OF THE REASONS WE TIMED THAT DURATION IS BASED ON SOME ELECTION STATE LAWS FOR ELECTIONS
00:53:05.705: >> Commissioner Woods: FORGET ABOUT DURATION FOR A MOMENT, BUT IN TERMS OF SIZE OR THE NUMBER THAT YOUOULD HAVE IN YOUR YARD, YOU COULD NOT HAVE -- IF THE TOTAL SIGN -- IF THE DIMENSIONS AND EVERYTHING GO UP TO 20 FEET, YOU CAN'T DO THAT?
00:53:21.220: >> Planning Manager:  IF THEY GO OVER 20 SQUARE FEET, IT WOULD BE IN VIOLATION. EMSIKE THEN YO ARE SORT OFT LIMITING PEOPLE IN TERMS OF FREE SPEECH.
00:53:35.234: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD SAY WE ARE INCREASING IT. WE PROVIDE SOME ABILITY FOR POLITICAL SIGNS BUT NOT OTHER TYPE OF SIGNAGE. NOW WE ARE GIVING YOU 20 SQUARE FEET TO USE HOWEVER YOU DESIRE.
00:53:44.410: >> Commissioner Woods: YOU MAY BUTOU STILL MAYE LIMITING IF I WANT TO GO -- IF I WANT TO INDICATE EVERYBODY ON THAT TICKET THAT I WANT TO VOLT FOR.
00:54:02.561: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S A BALANCE.
00:54:06.031: >> Commissioner Woods: I'M PROBABLY NOT THENLY ONE ON THAT.
00:54:12.138: >> Chair Mills: WHAT I HEARD IN THAT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M READING THE TABLE. WE ARE NOW INCREASING, ACTUALLY -- WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING RIGHT NOW IS INCREASING THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT COMMISSIONER WOODS CAN HAVE POLITICAL SIGNS ON, BUT IN -- SO THERE'S MORE THAN WHAT WAS IN THE DRAFT. EVEN SO, SHE'S LIMITED. SHE CAN ONLY HAVE FOUR SIGNS. IT COULD BE FOUR POLITICAL SIGNS. IT COULD BE TWO POLITICAL SIGNS AND TWO FOR SALE SIGNS, YOU KNOW, THE SALE SIGN AND THE OPEN HOUSE SIGN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL LIMITATIONS ON THE OVERALL NUMBER OF ISSUE SIGNED OR ANY KIND OF SIGNS, RIGHT, THAT I'M -- SO THAT'S KIND OF MODIFYING WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS. IT'S NOT JUST THE SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT THE SHEER NUMBER.
00:55:05.524: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
00:55:08.227: >> Chair Mills: WHICH MAY RAISE MORE RED FLAGS FOR YOU, COMMISSIONER WOODS. I THINK WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING IS WHAT THE OVERALL SQUARE FOOTAGE SHOULD BE. WE MIGHT WANT TO DISCUSS WHAT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SIGNS
00:55:19.772: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: MR. L EONARD, CAN YOU HELP ME DO SOME MATH HERE QUICKLY?
00:55:26.345: >> Planning Manager:  PROBABLY NOT.
00:55:28.647: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SO LET'S ASSUME -- SO THANK YOU BY THE WAY. I'M HAPPY WITH THE 20-FOOT MAXIMUM. LET'S ASSUME I HAVE A 65-FOOT LOT. WHAT WOULD BE MY MAXIMUM SIGN ALLOWED FOR A 65-FOOT LOT? Plannganager FOR A 65 LOT, YOU WOULD GET A LOT WITH MORE THAN 60 FEET. A MAXIMUM OF .2 SQUARE FEET PER LINEAR FOOT OF LOT WIDTH. SO IF IT WERE 65 SQUARE FEET, TITIMES 2:00, YOU GET 13 SQUARE FEET. SO THAT WOULD RATCHET DOWN TO A MAXIMUM OF 12 OR IN THIS CASE, WOULD YOU GET 13 BECAUSE WE OPTED TO 20 POTENTIALLY. YOU GET UP TO 13 SQUARE FEET, MAXIMUM OF SQUARE FOOT PER SIGN. MAXIMUM OFOUR SIGNS.
00:56:49.194: >> Chair Mills: TO WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT?
00:56:50.529: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
00:56:53.032: >> Chair Mills: BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE 60 SQUARE FOOT LOT, YOU GET MORE SIGNAGE THAN IF YOU HAD 61 SQUARE FOOT LOT WIDTH.
00:57:00.039: >> Planning Manager:  YES, WE PUT A BASIC FLOOR. SO HARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF YOUR LOT,OU HAV SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR SIGNAGE ON YOUR LOT.
00:57:10.816: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: BUT TO ME IT SOUNDS LIKE -- SO WHAT I'M READING HERE, LOT WIDTH MORE THAN 60 FEET. SO IF I'M A 65-FOOT LOT, IN THIS CATEGORY, IT WOULD BE 13 FEET AM I READING THIS INCORRECTLY?
00:57:28.200: >> Planning Manager:  YES, IT'S 13 SQUARE SQUARE FEET. LOT WIDTH AMONG 65-FOOT. UP TO 48 SQUARE FEET. YES, SO YOU WOULD GET UP TO 13 SQUARE FEET. SO IF WE ARE INCREASING TO 20 OR TH 60-FOOT LOT, YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MUCH YOU WANT THAT ADJUSTED.
00:57:55.494: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SO COULD WE SAY A MAXIMUM -- .2 SQUARE FEET PER LINEAR FOOT --
00:58:03.702: >> Planning Manager:  WHAT ABOUT CAPPING THEM ALL AT A MAXIMUM OF 20 REGARDLESS OF LOT ZE?
00:58:10.075: >> Commiioner Milshteyn: I WOD BE OKAY WITH IT.
00:58:11.610: >> Planning Manager:  IF WE ARE OKAY WITH IT FOR SMALL LOTS, UNLESS WE FOUND SOME VALUE IN PROVIDING A MUCH HIGHER AREA FOR LARGER LOTS, B BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S NECESSARY.
00:58:28.594: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I WOULD BE OKAY WITH CAPPING AT 2.
00:58:33.365: >> Chair Mills: THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO MY FRIENDLY AMENDED AMENDMENT, TO BE CLEAR. SO IN THE TWO PLACES FOR SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTIFAMILY, FREE STANDING, IT IS REGARDLESS OF -- IT'S NOW VERY SIMPLE. RIGHT NOW IT'S CURRENTLY A VERY, YOU KNOW, MUCH TEXT. THE ONLY THING IN THE PER LOT BOX IS A MAXIMUM OF 20 SQUARE FEET?
00:58:55.554: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: CORRE CT. YES.
00:58:59.058: >> Chair Mills: SO YOU DID THAT. I'M SURE IT'S FRIENDLY TO YOU. COMMISSIONER ABRONS IS THAT FRIENDLY YOU TO? ALL RIGHT. EXCELLENT. COMMISSIONER SAUVE, I SAW YOUR HAND AT ONE POINT. ARE YOU -- DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK?
00:59:16.041: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WOULD SAY IF YOU WANT TO DID REVERSE MATH, IT WOULD BE .333 TO GET TO THE 20. ALEX IS LIKE, NO, WE DON'T NEED MORE MA. MORE MOTH. 20 IS GOOD. THE MORE DIRECT THINGS ARE I THINK IS GREAT IN AN ORDINANCE.
00:59:36.628: >> Chair Mil: I INK THAT THIS MAKES SENSE A IS EQUITABLE. THE ONLY THING THAT IT WOULD MEAN IS THAT IF YOU ARE A CORNER LOT, YOU HAVE MORE FRONTAGE,EN YOU KNOW LONGER GET YOUR TWO SIGNS, LIKE DOUBLE SIGNS IF YOU HAVE A CORNER LOT FOR SALE. I THOUGHT I WOULD BRING IT UP THAT'S NOT BOTHERSOME TO ME,UT IF IT IS TO ANYONE ELSE, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.
01:00:04.123: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: IT IS BOTHERSOME, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PUSH MY LUCK TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS.
01:00:12.998: >> Chair Mills: EXCELLENT. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE READY TO VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT. AGAIN, THIS AMENDMENT IS TO -- IN TWO PLACES ON TABLE.24-6, TO HAVE THE PER LOT MAXIMUM SIGN AREA BE 20 SQUARE FEET REGARDLESS OF LOT SIZE FOR THE SINGLE FAMILY AND THE MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL.
01:00:40.225: >> Commissioner Sauve: THE 6-FOOT HEIGHT. THOSE TWO THINGSRE TETHER? Planning Mager:  THEY WERE COVERED IN THE PREVIOUS MOTION.
01:00:46.899: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. GOOD.
01:00:47.966: >> Chair Mills: ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT AMENDMENT, PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND. [CHORUS OF AYES] ANY OPPOSED? SO SEE ANYONE SO THE MOTION IS NOW AMENDED FOR THE SECOND TIME. SO WE HAVE GOTHE 6-FOOT MAXIMUM HEIGHT. WE HAVE THE 20 SQUARE FEET MAXIMUM PER LOT AREA. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION ON THE MOTION AS AMENDED? COMMISSIONER ABRONS?
01:01:17.996: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I WANTED TO BRING UP THE POTENTIAL CONCLUSION AROUND UNLIMITED IN A TEMPORARY CATEGORY, AND IN HAVE BEEN THINKING IF THERE'S A WORD OTHER THAN TEMPORARY THAT COD MAKE SENSE. I WAS THINKING COULD WE CONSIDER THE FOR WORD IMPERMANENT. IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF A PERMANENT SIGN. IT'S NOT PERMANENTLY AFFIXED. AND I THINK MAYBE IMPERMANENT WOULD WORK. BECAUSE AN IMPERMANENT SIGN OF UNLIMITED DURATION MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME THAN A TEMPORARY SEEN OF UP LIMITED DURATION BECAUSE TEMPORARY KIND OF TIME, AND IMPERMANENT MAYBE DOESN'T. SO.
01:02:15.354: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T THINK IT'S DISTINCT FROM WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THERE. IT'S NOT A PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTED TIME IN A WAY. I THINK THE TEMPORARY IS ALSO INTENTED TO PROBABLY SPEAK TO THE TYPE OF SIGN IT IS. VERSUS PERHAPS A 3 SQUARE FOOT MONUMENT SIGN THAT SOMEONE MIGHT PUT IN A YARD. I'M PERSONALLY OKAY WITH TEMPORARY. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS, WE ARE ACTUALLY -- IT'S TECHNICAL DEFINITION IS AN UNLIMITED SIGN AND WE'RE JUST IDENTIFYING THAT IT IS AN PRISIONS OF TPORARY SIGNSL BECAUSE OF THAT DURATION.
01:03:01.199: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YEAH. IF YOU READ THE DEFINITION, IT SAYS A TEMPORARY SIGN INTENDED FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF DISPLAY. YOU CAN HAVE A SIGN FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF DISPLAY BUT IT'S NOT REQUIRED TO BE LIMITED IN ITS PERIOD OF DISPLAY. I THINK IF OTHER PEOPLE DON'T FIND IT CONFUSING, I THINK -- I THINK THAT'S WT WEANT F THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE ORDINANCE. I THINK IF THERE'S CONSENSUS IT WON'T BE CONFUSING, I THINK I WOULD OFFER IMPERMANENT AS AN OPTION.
01:03:55.887: >> Chair Mills: IT SOUNDED LIKE THAT WAS NOT A MOTION TO AMEND BUT MAYBE SEEKING IF THEREERE OTHERS TT WERE OF THE SAME MIND.
01:04:06.798: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES, I WILL DEFER TO MR. LENART'S OPINION. IF HE FEELS IT WON'T BE CUMBERSOME TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE ORDINANCE, THEN I TRUST THAT.
01:04:20.579: >> Planning Manager:  I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK. IF IT PROGRESSES, WE CAN LOOK AT THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE -- IT'S CLEAR TO ME, BUT I THINK YOUR POINT IS GOOD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING IT TO THE PUBLIC AS CLEARLY AS WE CAN. THAT SAID, I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DO SOME COMMUNICATION ON THIS ORDINANCE APART FROM THE ORDINANCE ITSELF AND THERE'S PROBABLY LOTS OF AVENUES TO DEFINE IT OR REFERENCE IT, THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE PRESENT TO CITY COUNCIL, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER YOUR SORT OF POLICY STAMP THAT IT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE.
01:05:13.098: >> Chair Mills: IS THIS DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDED LANGUAGE, NOW AMENDED MOTION? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. I'M READIN THROUGH THAschmidt: TEMPORARY THG. I TOTALLY GET YOUR POINT AND THE TEMPORARY IS CONFUSING. BECAUSE THIS LIMITED THING IS UNDER THE TEMPORARY SIGNS SECTION BUT IT'S SAYING, BUT ONE OF THESE TEMPORARY SIGNS CAN BE UNLIMITED, LIKE IT'S MAYBE LESS CONFUSING SO I KIND OF THINK IT'S FINE. I WANTED TO BRING BACK THE NUER OF SIGNS AND I ALSO HAD WRITTEN DOWN BASICALLY WHAT COMMISSIONER WOODS IS SAYING, OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS AN ELECTION LAST NIGHT, AND I HAVE SEEN MANY HOUSES WITH, YOU KNOW, SIX, SEVEN, SIGNS. I'M SURE IF I ADDED THEM UP, THEY ARE ALL DOUBLE SIDED AND IT'S WAY OVER0 SQRE FT. I DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL. I JUST THINK THAT TS IS GOING TO BE A POTENTIAL ISSUE. BUT SINCE WE CAN'T REGULATE CONTENT, YOU CAN'T SAY THE EXCEPTION OF POLITICAL SIGNS. YEAH. I MEAN -- I THINK I -- I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SIGNS. LIKE, I DON'T -- UNLESS WE GET INTO LIKE A SUATION WHERE PELE ARE PUTTING 21 SQUARE FOOT SIGNS IN THEIR YARD THAT I DON'T SEE HAPPENING. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG -- WELL, I THINK MAYBE ON SOME OF THE PICTURES, WE HAD SQUARE FOOTAGE OF SOME OF THESE POLITICAL SIGNS. THAT NOW I CAN'T FIND.
01:06:56.468: >> Planning Manager:  YES, THEY RANGE FROM 8 SQUARE FEET, PROBABLY TO A LITTLE SMALLER, DEPENDING ON SIGN.
01:07:05.143: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: SO THIS BLACK LIVES MATTER, WHERE YOU HAVE THE 4.2 SQUARE FEET, IS THAT ON BOTH SIDES? THAT'S JUST ONE SIDE?
01:07:15.420: >> Pnning Manager:  I DON'T KNOW. CHRIS, DO YOU KNOW THAT?
01:07:23.728: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I'M GUESSING.
01:07:25.263: >> Planning Manager:  IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S PROBABLY ONE SIDE.
01:07:32.337: >> Commissioner Sauve: IT'S 8.24 SIDED.
01:07:33.638: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OH, THAT'S RIGHT BELOW. YEAH, I MEAN, THEN LIKE UNDER THE SIGN ORDAN, YOUOULD REALLY ONLY HAVE TWO OF THESE POLITICAL SIGNS AND I'M -- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE BREAKING THIS ORDINANCE RIGHT NOW. I DON'T REALLY HAVE A --
01:07:56.795: >> Planning Manager:  AND I -- I GET IT, BUT THIS IS - THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE CRU OF THE ISSUE, IS THAT WE CAN NO LONGER -- YOU KNOW, OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE -- OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE EVOLVED OUT OF THOSE THINGS. WELL, FOR POLITICAL SIGNS, THIS IS ACCEPTABLE. FOR COMMERCIAL SIGNS, THIS IS ACCEPTABLE. FOR OTHER TYPES OF -- FOR REAL ESTATE SIGNS, THIS IS ACCEPTABLE. WE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY ANY MORE. SO WE CAN GOSIG AND AS ACCOMMODATING AS WE WANT. WE CAN GO AS KIND OFESTRICTIVE AND CONSTRAINED AS WE WANT. THE IMPORTANT THING ISHAT WE ARE TREATING EVERYTHING EQUALLY.
01:08:31.263: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH. I THINK THIS IS THE TENSION, RIGHT? WE DON'T WANT TO SAY, OKAY, LIKE ON AVERAGE, IF SOMEONE WANTS TO HAVE THREE POLITICAL SIGNS IN THEIR YARD. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY -- I MEAN, I DON'TNOW. I DOT KW. I THINK THAT IS THE TENSION THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE, LIKE, SIZE VERSUS --
01:08:50.148: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S WHY YOU GET THE BIG BUCKS.
01:08:53.351: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: RIGHT. THAT'S WHY YOU GET THE BIG BUCKS. I WILL STOP TALKING AND SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO WEIGH IN.
01:09:01.626: >> Chair Mills: COULD YOU REMIND US, WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL, CURRENTLY IS I AREE-FOR-ALL WITH REGARD TO POLITICAL SIGNS? THAT MIGHT HELP PUT IT IN CONTEXT.
01:09:10.735: >> Planning Manager:  SO CURRENTLY -- CURRENTLY, POLITICAL SIGN HAS A MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF 48 INCHES AND A MAXIMUM WIDTH OF 36 INCHES. AND THE BOTTOM OF THE SIGN SHALL BE A MINIMUM OF 6 INCHES FROM THE GROUND. THE SIGN SHALL BE SET BACK AT LEAST 5 FEET FROM THE PUBLIC RIGHT--WAY OR AFFIXED TO A BUILDING. A SIGN THAT ADVOCATES OR OPPOSES A CANDIDATE FOR PUBLIC OFFICE OR POSITION ON AN ISSUE TO BE DETERMINED SHALL BE REMOVED NOT MORE THAN 18 HOURS AFTER ELECTION. POLITICAL SIGNS SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY SPECIFIED TIME LIMIT OR -- AND MUST BE REMOVED IF THEY BECOME DANGEROUS OR OTHERWISE PRIBITED. SO NOT RESTRICTED IN SIZE. NOT RESTRICTED IN DURATION, OTHER THAN AFTER THE POLITICAL ISSUE IS -- COMES TO SOME DECISION. THEY HAVE TO BE REMOVED IN 18 HOURS.
01:10:24.676: >> Chair Mills: AND SO THE McGEE SIGN, THAT FELTS INTO THAT. IT'S QUITE LARGE. THAT'S NOTHING THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING WOULD ALLOW FOR A SIGN THATIZE?
01:10:32.484: >>lanning Manager:  CORRECT.
01:10:33.952: >> Chair Mills: IT EXCEEDS THE OVERALL SQUARE FOOTAGE AND THE PER SIGN SQUARE FOOTAGE. GOT IT. OKAY. COMMISSIONER -- WHO -- PEOPLE MOVED ON MY SCREEN. COMMISSIONER WOODS, DID YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP BEFORE I ASKED THAT QUESTION?
01:10:49.934: >> Commissioner Woods: I DID HAVE ANY HAND UP AND NOT SO MUCH THAT I'M N GNG TO VOTE FOR THE SIGN ORDINANCE BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE INTO, IT AND I WILL CERTAINLY VOTE FOR IT. JUST TO BE AWARE THAT THERE WILL BE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU WOULD WANT -- I WOULD WANT -- AND I DON'T TRY TO GO AROUND BREAKING THE LAWS. I COULD SEE WHERE I HAVE A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF REAL GOOD CAUSES, AS WELL AS SAYING, YOU KNOW, GIRLS CAN DO IT TOO OR WHATEVER. YOU KNOW? SO IT'S JUST AFTER A WHILE, IT BECOMES, YOU KNOW -- AND I KNOW OUR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T WANT TO GO OUT, YOU KNOW, TICKET, TICKET, TICKET. BUT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES, YOU KNOW, IF A NEIGHBOR GETS UPSET WITH ME BECAUSE OF THE CONTE OF THE SIG THEN THEY CALL IN OR SOMETHING OR I CALL IN BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY PUT UP. SO I DON'T KNOW. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. I DO APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE INTO THE WHOLE SIGN ORDINANCE THING. THAT'S ROUGH.
01:11:53.798: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK YOU MEAN IT'S AWESOME!
01:12:00.738: >> Chair Mills: JUST DOING THE MATH MYSELF, I THINK I WOULD -- WITH THIS IDEA, I THINK I WOULD MOVE TO MAKE ONE AMENDMENT WHICH IS CHANGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SIGNS FROM FOUR TO FIVE, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THAT -- THE IDEA THAT A SINGLE SIDED SIGN TENDS TO BE ABOUT 4 SQUARE FEET AND WE ARE ALLOWING 20. AT LEAST THENHAT NUMBER THAT'S NOT A LIMITATION AND ACTUALLY, I COULD -- I THINK I MIGHT MOVE TO HAVE FIVE, BUT IF THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO ARGUE THAT IT SHOULD BE MORE, I WOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT. I FEEL LE FEEL LIKE WE ARE REGUY SIGN AREA AND THIS IS ALLOWING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE. I THINK YOUR NEIGHBOR -- IT'S EASIER TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF SIGNS THAN IT IS TO TAKE YOUR TAPE MEASURE OUT A MEASURE. SO -- ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO AMEND MY LITTLE MOTION TO AMEND, AND I'M GOING TO SAY SIX. DOES ANYONE WANT TO SECOND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SIGNS THAT ARE ALLOWED. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, WE ARE OPEN FOR DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ABRONS THAT WAS NOT A THUMBS UP. THAT WAS A HAND.
01:13:10.575: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IT WAS A TENTATIVE HAND, AND THEN I TOOK IT AWAY BUT I WILL SPEAK. THAT COULD BE SIX TIMES ONE THAT HAS INDEFINITE DURATION AND FIVE OF WHICH WOULD HAVE THE 65 DAY LIMIT AND STILL CAPPED BY THE 2. I WOULD SUPPORT THAT.
01:13:34.232: >> Chair Mills: GREAT. WE'LL VOTE ON THAT AMENDMENT. ALL IN FAVOR?
01:13:38.836: >> Planning Manager:  SORRY, WHO SECONDED THAT?
01:13:42.173: >> Chair Mills: I THINK I SAID COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. ALL IN FAVOR, SAYYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND. AYE. ANY[CHORUS OF AYES] ANYONE OPPOSED? NOW WE HAVE A MOTION WITH THREE AMENDMENTS THAT'S BACK OPEN THE ON THETABLE. I WILL CLOSE BY SAY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK. I THINK THE CHANGES THAT YOU MADE IN TERMS OF GOING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. WEON WAN TO PUT AHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS AUTOMATICAL MAKE THEM NON-CONFORMING. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE INTENTION HERE. THE TENSION IS TO COME UP TO SPEED WITH, YOU KNOW -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW AS WRITTEN. I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK INTO THIS. THANK YOU  MUCH.,R. CHENG, THAT WAS HELPFUL IN GROUNDING OUR DISCUSSION. IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE WHAT 4 SQUARE FEET IS OR UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT REAL ESTATE SANES. SO THANK -- THE REAL ESTATE SIGNS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER COMMENTS? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:14:49.907: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING, AND ECHO THIS WAS SO MUCH WORK. I PROBAY D'T KNOW UNDERSTAND LIKE 50% OF THIS ORDINANCE, BUT WHAT COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE LOT SIZE, I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE JUST CAPPED EVERYBODY AT 20 SQUARE FEET TOTAL. I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE CORNER LOT REAL ESTATE ISSUE, BUT, I MEAN, IT'S COMPLETELY EQUITABLE FOR SOMEBODY WITH A LARGER LOT SIZE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ARE MONTH SIGNS OR BIGGER SIGNS. SO I THINK THATAKING IT EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ANY LOT IS A GREAT THING TO DO.
01:15:30.448: >> Chair Mills: IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE. WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL VOTE.
01:15:38.322: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
01:15:38.990: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
01:15:42.427: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:15:48.766: >> Commissioner Sauve: (INAUDIBL E).
01:15:49.600: >> Planning Manager:  THAT WAS A YES? COMMISSIONER ABRONS?
01:15:51.335: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES. COMMISSIOCOMMISSIONER HAMMERSCH.
01:15:57.475: >>ommiioner Haerschmidt: YES.
01:16:01.813: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
01:16:02.413: >> Chair Mills: YES.
01:16:02.880: >> Planning Manager:  IT CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY. THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THAT ENDEAVOR.
01:16:06.484: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU!
01:16:07.585: >> THANK YOU.
01:16:10.955: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. WE ARE AT 8:15. I AM TIP ON. THIS IS 10A, VERIDIAN AT COUNTY FARM PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT, ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:16:34.479: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WILL NEED TO RECUSE MYSELF. MY FIRM HAS BEEN HIRED TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT. D WILL STEP AWAYROM THE DIUSSION AND COME BACK ON AFTER WE ARE DONE.
01:16:47.425: >> Planning Manager:  AND OFF YOU GO.
01:16:51.763: >> Chair Mills: YOU ARE DEMOTED.
01:16:53.865: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE A FARE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTING THESE. FOR THE BENEFIT OF COMMISSIONERS, I HAVE PROVIDED -- WE HAVE A PUD PETITION AND WE HAVE TWO DISTINCT SITE PLANS FOR THAT. SO IAVEROVIDED THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TWO TEN-MINUTE PRESENTATION OR ONE 20 MINUTE HOWEVER THEY DESIRE.
01:17:13.718: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN?
01:17:15.753: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I GUESS FOR CLARIFICATION, HOW ARE WE TOKING TO BE VOTING ON THIS? SINCE THERE'S TWO SEPARATE SITE PLANS BUT ONE PUD, HOW WILL THE
01:17:24.529: >> Plannin Manager:  THERE'S THREE DISSINK, ONE FOR THE PUD ZONING, ONE SETTING THE ZONING FOR THE SITE, INDEPENDENT OF THE SITE PLANS, THE PUD AS CURRENTLY PRO PROPOSED DOES NOT LINK THAT TO THE PUD ZONING DISTRICT AND THEN YOU HAVE TWO DISTINCT MOTIONS ON EACH SITE PLAN. BECAUSE OF THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIP, THEY ARE SHARING THINGS LIKE ACCESS, UTILITIES WE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH WHIL TO THEM IN ENMASS.
01:17:52.256: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:17:55.626: >> Planning Manager:  AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE JOINED BY LOTS OF PEOPLE.
01:18:00.965: >> Chair Mills: WHAT I WOULD ADD ON TO THAT IS THAT I THINK HEARING THE PRESENTATIONS IS ALL TOGETHER, IF THEY ARE -- YOU KNOW, AFTER THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND WE READ THE MOTIONS, IF WE WANT TO SAY -- IF IT MAKES SENSE TO SEPARATE THEM OUT, I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT AS WELL. BUT I THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST TAKE THEM ALL TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY THE PUBLIC HEARING MAKES SENSE TO DO TOGETHER.
01:18:25.990: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: AND I'M -- ARE THERE SIX OF US ON THIS EVENING? IS -- DO WE NEED TO ALL VE IN ORDER TO -- ALL VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WITH A RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE?
01:18:42.073: >> Chair Mills: THERE ARE SEVEN.
01:18:43.074: >> Planning Manager:  SEVEN AND SIX AFFIRMATIVE VOTES WOULD BE NECESSARY TO FORWARD A RECOMMENDATION.
01:18:53.885: >> Chair Mil: ZACKUST HAS HIS CAMERA OFF.
01:19:01.259: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: OH, OKAY.
01:19:02.560: >> Chair Mills: I HAD TO COUNT UP.
01:19:05.863: >> Planning Manager:  I'M STILL WORKING ON PEOPLE. GIVE ME A MOMENT. ALEXIS. I WILL MAKE A COHOST. SHE WILL BE RUNNING THE PRESENTATION.
01:19:49.106: >> Chair Mills: IT'S NOT THE BRADYBRADY BUNCH ANY MORE. NOW YOU ARE BECOMING SMALLER. ZACK ALEXIS, YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SOME TRANSFORMATIVE STUFF IN TOWN.
01:20:02.853: >> I SINGLE HANDEDLY TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE TOWN.
01:20:07.792: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M GETTING THAT. THIS THIS IS WHAT YOU UNDER A BENEVOLENT QUEEN LOOKS LIKE BEING I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
01:20:18.369: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD ASK QUICKLY THE PETITIONERS, IS THE SETNG THA YOU WERE ANTICIPATING THAT YOU DON'T SEE PRESENT? NOPE? ALL RIGHT.
01:20:37.688: >> Chair Mills: GREAT! SO AS MR. LENART SAID, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE PETITIONERS FOR A TOTAL OF 20 MINUTES. AND THEN AFTER THAT, MISDELEO, YOU WILL TAKE OVER AND FELL US IN ON ANYTHING ELSE.
01:20:56.474: >> Chair Mills: GREAT.
01:20:56.974: >> DEVELOPERS, LET ME KNOW WHICH PRESENTATION TO LOAD FIRST.
01:21:05.549: >> AVALON'S.
01:21:06.584: >> GREAT. SO SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED?
01:21:11.689: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
01:21:12.957: >> YES, PLEASE.
01:21:14.658: >> SO I'M WENDY CARTY-SAXON, I'M THE --
01:21:19.397: >> Planning Manager:  CAN I -- I'M SORRY. ARE YOU GUYS IN TWO SEPARATE PRESENTATIONS OR DO YOU WANT ME TO RUN A 20-MINUTE CLOCK?
01:21:26.203: >> RUN A 20-MINUTE CLOCK. WE WILL ROLL FROM ONE INTO THE OTHER.
01:21:31.075: >> Planning Manager:  SORRY ABOUT THAT.
01:21:32.610: >> AND JUST REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE WITH THE VERIDIAN COUNTY FORM PROPOSAL FOR THE JOINT PUD COVERING BOTH THE AVALON AND THE THRIVE SITE, AND WITH OUR DISTINCT SITE PLANS ALSO. AND THE PICTURE UP IS A RENDERING THAT WAS DONE A WHILE BACK SHOWING THE OVERALL SE, CERTAIN BUILDINGS HAVE SHIFTED AND MOVED AROUND  BIT, BUT I THINK IT GIVES A DECENT GENERAL FEEL FOR THE OVERALL NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I WILL CHAT A BIT ABOUT AVALON SITE PLAN AND DAVID ESAU WILL PROVIDE A BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. AND WE HAVE OUR ENGINEERS AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE, YOU KNOW,ATER ON. AFTER DAVID AND I TALK, WE WILL HAND IT OVER TO THRIVE AND THEY CAN DISCUSS THEIR SITE PLAN, AS WELL AS TOUCH ON THE PUD AND THE PUBLIC BENEFITS, BUT SINCE I'M HERE, I WANT TO AT LEAST MENTION WHAT WE FEEL IS A REALLY KEY PUBLIC BENEFIT OF THE PUD, THE EXPANSION OF THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO BRING 50 NEWNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THE COMMUNITY WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT. AND IT'S BOTH MORE UNITS THAN WHAT SORT OF THE BASELINE IS WITH THE PUD, AS WELL AS MORE DEEPLY TARGETED AND I WILL TOUCH ON THAT IN A LITTLE BIT. AND I WILL SAY THE PUD ALSO BRINGS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT OF ALLOWING US TO DO A MIX OF USES EXCITING SITE DESIGN TO ENABLE US TO DESIGN IT WITH TWO COMMON CIRCULATION, BOTH VEHICULAR AND PEDESTRIAN, CREATIVE LAND USE EXPERTISE AND ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACHES BEING TAKEN, BUT OTHER FOLKS CAN TOUCH MORE ON THAT A BIT LATER. JUST REAL BRIEF BACKGROUND, IT'S COUNTY-OWNED LAND AND WE EACH HAVE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR OUR PARCELS AND AS FAR AS AVALON GOES, I WILL SAY SECURING LAND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A KEY CHALLENGE TO OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP. SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN FANTASTIC TO BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY, HAVING A COMMITTED SELLAR ON SEN THG FOR US., WCH IS HUGE THEN IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. PERFECT. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF AVALON'S PLAN, VERIDIAN AT COUNTY FARM NORTH. YOU CAN SEE SORT OF THE GRAY DRIVE AREA, THAT'S ON AVALON'S SIDE. YOU CAN SORT OF SEE THE PROPERTY LINE, AND AVALON'S UNITS ARE THE ONES TO THE NORTH OFHOSE. AND THEN YOUAN SEE IN THE MIDDLE RIGHT, SOUTH OF THE GRAYED IN DRIVE IS THE COMMUNITY CENTER. AND THEN THE BLDING TO THE RIGHT IS ALSO AVALON'S. BUT EVEN SORT OF LOOKING AT THAT DRAWING, I THINK YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF HOW OVERALL THE DEVELOPMENT IS INTENDED TO FLOW AS THE TWO DIFFERENT SITE PLANS ARE INTENDED TO FLOW AS A SINGLE DEVEPMENT. AS FAR AS AVALON'S GO, IT'S 50 OPPORTUNITIES, IT'S ONE TWO, THREE AND FOUR-BEDROOM UNITS. WENT FOUND IT'S A REAL NEED FOR OUR FAMILIES. 30 OF OUR 50 UNITS ARE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. SO THEY WILL BE FOR HOUSEHOLDS UNDER 30% OF AREA MEDIAN WHICH IS ABOUT $21,000 FOR A THOSE 30 UNITS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE PROJECT-BASED VOUCHERS. SO THE HOUSEHOLDS WOULD ONLY I WAY 30% TOWARDS THEIR RENT. 10 OF THOSE SUPPORTING HOUSING UNITS ARE TARGETED. SO YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WOULD HAVE A HOME HERE. ARE 60% BELOW THE AREA MEDIAN. WE HAVE NINE BUILDINGS ON OUR SITE, INCLUDING THE COMMUNITY CENTER, AND IT'S A MIX -- OUR UNITS A MIX OF STACKED FLATS AND TWO-STORY TOWN HOUSES, WHICH WE FOUND THAT THAT KIND OF DESIGN REALLY WORKS VERY WELL AT AV AVALON'S PROPERTIES. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT 15% OF OUR UNITS, OF OUR 50 UNITS, EIGHT ARE FULLY ACCESSIBLE ACROSS A RANGE OF BEDROOM TYPES, AND I THINK THE CODE MAY REQUIRE LIKE ONE. SO WE ARE REALLY GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT. AND ALL THE GROUND FLOOR FLATS, AND ALL THE GROUND FLOORS OF THE TOWN HOUSES ARE VISITABLE. SUFFICIENTLY WIDE DOORWAYS, ET CETERA. AND NOW I WILL TURN IT OVER TO DAVID ESAU, THE CORNERSTONE DESIGN ARCHITECT TO CHAT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT OUR SITE PLAN.
01:26:01.679: >> THANK YOU, WENDY. I'M DAVID ES AAU. LL START TALKING ABOUT THE COMMUNITY CENTER. YOU WILL SEE IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SITE. IT PROVIDES EASY ACCESS FOR ALL THE UNITS, IT'S ADJOURNING AVALON'S PLAYGROUND AREA WHICH IS TO THE WEST OF THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND ADJOURNING THRIVE'S OPEN SPACE SOUTH OF THE PLAY GROUND SO THERE'S A CENTRAL ACTIVITY AREA FOR THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT, WHERE RESIDENTS CAN COME TOGETHER FOR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AND POSSIBLY ACTIVITIES LEADING INTO THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND THAT SORT OF THING. THE PROGRAM OF THE COMMUNITY CENTER IS SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT AVALON HAS AT PAULINE OR CARROTWAY, IF YOU EVER VISITED, THOUGH, A LARGE MEETING ROOM AND TENANT LAUNDRY, AND SERVICE OFFICES. THIS ONE WILL BE ANIQUE BUILDING FOR THEM IN THAT AVALON IS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL LIVING FUTURE INSTITUTE. IT'S AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PILOT PROGRAM, AND PART OF THE EFFORT TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO FOR THE COMMUNITY CENTER. THAT WILL BE AN INTERESTING CHALLENGE AS WE FINISH UP THE DESIGN FOR THAT. WE'RE CURRENTLY PLANNING DOUBLE STUD WALLS AROUND THE EXTERIOR AND THERE'S HH LEVEL OF INSULATION IN THE WALLS AND THEN THE BILLING IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW A LOT OF SOLAR PANELS TO BE PLACED ON THE ROOF TO TRY TO GET DOWN TO THE NET ZERO LEVEL. I THINK THERE ARE SOME ELEVATIONS ON THE NEXT SLIDE OF THE COMMUNITY CENTER. NOPE. THAT IS BUILDING A, THE FRONT ELEVATION ALONG PLAT. THATILL BE T NEXT ONE. NOPE. I WAS WRONG. NEXT ONE AFTER THAT. THERE WE ARE. SO THOSE ARE ELEVATIONS OF THE COMMUNITY CENTER, THE SOUTH ELEVATION WOULD HAVE THE LARGE ROOF THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR SOLAR PANELS. SO MOVING BACK TO THE APARTMENTS IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO ONE OF THE PREVIOUS SLIDES, THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS LOONG AT ONE OF THE TOWN HOUSE BUILDINGS WITH FOUR BEDROOM UNITS AT THE END AND THREE BEDROOM UNITS IN THE MIDDLE. AVALON'S UNITS OR DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ALWAYS HAD SIGNIFICANT GREEN REQUIREMENTS USUALLY THROUGH ENTERPRISE GREEN, BUT THIS SHOULD BE AVALON'S DEGRENNESTGREENESTTO DATE. WE WILL HAVE CASEMENT WINDOWS THROUGHOUT, BOTH FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ACCESSIBILITY. THEY WON'T HAVE VINYL SIDING OR VINYL FLOORING. SO THAT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT AFFECTS OUR COSTS AND HOW IT AFFECTS ALL THE PROJECTS SERVING TEAM. BUT IT WAS A COMMITMENT WE MADE AS PART OF WORKING WITH THRIVE ON THIS DEVELOPMENT TO ACHIEVET. AND THE HVAC WILL BE ALL ELECTRIC, USING PRIMARILY HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO THE DESIGN OF THOSE. WE HAVE USED THEM SOME ON PREVIOUS PROJECTS AND WE ARE LOOKING AS FAR AS HOW THEY WORK OUT. IN ADDITION TO THE COORDINATION OF THRIVE, I LOOK AT TH CENR THE SITE. WE HAVE SHARED DRIVES FOR ACCESS TO AVALON PARKING AND THRIVE GARAGES IN A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE WE ARE SHARING THOSE AND COMMON MATERIALS THROUGHOUT THE SITE, USING SOME MORE TYPES OF SIDING, SIMILAR SITE LIGHTING FIXTURES AND PAVING MATERIALS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMON DESIGN THEMES THROUGHOUT THE SITE, INCLUDING THE UNIT ENTRIES TO SEE A COURTYARDS. DETAILS OF THE EXTERIOR DESIGNS THAT WOULD BE COMMON THROUGHOUT THE SITE. COMMON LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE RAIN GARDENS RAISING SIMILAR PLANTS. THAT WILL BE A LOOK CONSISTENT AS YOU DRIVE THROUGH THE SITE OR WALK THROUGH THE SITE. AND THEN WE WORK CLOSELY THROUGH THE DESIGN PROCESS ON THE DESIGN PROCESS OF UNITS. ANUTILITIES, DRIVES AND WALKS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS COORDINATED. THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE WANTED TO PRESENT ON THE AVALON SIDE. YOU WILL TURN IT OVER TO MATT GROKOFF FROM THRIVE. [ SILENCE ] MATT, ARE YOU THERE?
01:30:28.178: >> Chair Mills: I SEE YOU, MATT, BUT I THINK YOU ARE MUTED. I SEE YR MTH MOVIN OH, NO! I DON'T HAVE AN OPTION TO UNMUTE YOU ANY MORE THAN -- YOU ARE OFF? I WONDER IF WE HAVE A NUMBER THAT HE CAN CALL IN. UM... I CAN REPEAT IT FROM THE AGENDA. IS THAT THE RIGHT NUMBER TO GIVE HIM, MR. LENART? OH, BOY. HE SAYS HOST IS --
01:31:12.189: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YOU CAN USE IN THE LOWER LEFT, WHERE THE MICROPHONE ICON IS, CLICK THE LITTLE ARROW ABOVE, YOU CAN IT HIT SWITCH TO PHONE AUDIO TO PRESENT THE DIAL-IN NUMBER.
01:31:30.841: >> CAN YOU ALL HEAR NOW. I THINK WHILE YOU WERE -- ANYWAY, WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABT HOW THAT HAPPENED. CAN I GET MY TWO MINUTES BACK. GUYS, I SAID SOME REALLY BRILLIANT THINGS THAT YOU MISSED.
01:31:47.024: >> Planning Manager:  YOU HAVE 11 MINUTES LEFT, MATT.
01:31:49.960: >> THANK YOU. SO ALEXIS CAN YOU GO AHEAD AND BRING UP THE SLIDES? WHILE SHE'S BRINGING THAT UP, I WILL REPEAT THE BRILLIANT THINGS THAT I SAID WHEN I WAS ON MUTE. I'M MATT GROKOFF AND I'M WITH THRIVE. IT'S TO ACHIEVE THINGS THAT AND OVERCOME REALLY INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS AND ACHIEVE SOME OF THESE URGENT CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE. WE SPENT FOUR YEARS OF DEEPLY INTEGRATED DESIGN, AS DAVID ESAU WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT. WE HAVE COLLABORATED. WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH INDUSTRY PEOPLEROUND THE WORLD ON GREEN, AND SOUND ECOLOGY FROM SOMEBODY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. REALLY, REALLY DEEP IDEAS OF HOW TO RETHINK THE CONVENTIONAL MATTER THAT IS DEEP LeFLAWED. ALL OF THIS IS LOOKING AT HOW DO WE TAKE A REGENERATIVE APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT. AND THE RESULT, WE THINK, IS ONE OF THE MOST THOUGHTL AND COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLANS THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN HERE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A MODEL FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. FIRST, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, WHY ARE WE HERE? WHY IS THIS SO DAMN URGENT? I HAD THE EXTORDINARYPRIVILEGE T GRETA THUNEBERG IN STOCKHOLM SWEDEN. I GOT TO SPEND THE MORNING WITH THE ORIGINAL TEN CLIMATE STRIKERS. GRETAGRETA SAID WE HAD ENOUGH PP TALKING AND WE NEED ACTIONS. I BELIEVE PLEDGES AND PLANS AND PLATITUDES WITHOUT ACTION IS VANITY. SO WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT. WE HAVE EIGHT YEARS TO MAKE THIS EXTRAORDINARY TRANSITION. SO MY TAKEAWAY, COMING HOME FROM SWEDEN AND IF -- IF YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE, IS -- WHAT I LEARNED FROM GRETA. HOPE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU EARN, RIGHT? AND S TONHT IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY TO TAKE ACTION. YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I TOLD ALEXIS I WOULD DO A CAW-CAW WHEN I WANTED TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THEY ASKED US HOW WE ARE ACHIEVING SOME OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE GOALS YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN THEY HIGHLIGHTED THAT THEY BELIEVE VERIDIAN IS A MODEL FOR OTHERS TO TAKE, HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS? SO WE ARE ON TRACK TO CREATE WHAT WILL BE THE WORLD'S FIRST RESIDENTIAL LIVING COMMUNITY, CHALLENGE MASTER PLAN FOR THE VERIDIAN PARCEL. WE ARE A PARTNER IN THE A2ZERO PARTNERSHIP. AND THE LIVING COMMUNITY CAM ENG IS BRINGING THE LIVING BUILDING CHALLENGE TO SCALE. IT'S A BLACK BELT OF THE SUSTAINABLE BUILDING STANDARDS LIEUTENANT THE WORLD. SO THE NEXT -- ABSOLUTE THE WORLD. SO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO VERIDIAN ON T MART RATE SIDE, WE HAVE 99 PLANNED MARKET RATE RESIDENCES AND A MIX OF ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT UNIT TYPES. SO WE HAVE 42 TOWNHOMES OF DIFFERENT SIZES. WE HAVE GOT 30 WALKUP FLATS, AND WE HAVE GOT 11, WHAT WE ARE CALLING NEST SLATS WHICH ARE MICROUNITS AND 16 VILLAGE HOMES, WHICH ARE SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED HOMES. NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS A STRATEGIC DIVERSITY OF HOUSE. HOW DO WE TAKE MARKET RATE HOMES INSTEAD OF HAVING -- AGAIN, ECONOMIC SEGREGATION AT EVERY LEVEL, WHICH IS WHAT THE CONVENTIONAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL DOES, WE TRIED TO -- BY HAVING THESE DIFFERENT HOUNG TYPES, WE RANGE FROM 350 SQUARE FEET, ALL THE WAY TO 2300 SQUARE FEET, FOR THE VILLAGE HOMES AND A VARIETY OF FLOOR PLANS IN BETWEEN TO REALLY TRY TO HIT DIFFERENT PRICE POINTS IN THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE IT AFFORD A I BELIEVE TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FOLKS. NEXT SLIDE. SO OUR GOAL FOR THE THRIVE COLLABORATIVE, THE GOAL IS TO NET ZERO. WE MADE OUR COMMITMENT THAT OUR TARGET FOR THE THRIVE PARCEL IS NET ZERO AND THAT'S OUR REGISTRATION WITH THE LIVING COMMUNITY CHALLENGE. WITH OUR PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTY, WE COMMITTED TO A MINIMUM OF 400KW OF SOLAR A TO ALL ELECTRIC FOSSIL FUELS. SO BEING ALL ELECTRIC, WE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO ENERGY FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY BEDROOM UNITS HAVING EVERYONE  -- BY HAVING EVERYONE. IT'S SUPPLIED BY ONSITE RENEWABLE ENERGY WITH NO COMBUSTION. NEXT SLIDE. SO THIS IS OUR SOLAR STUDY. SO OUR SOLAR POTENTIAL ON THIS SITE, AGAIN WE COMMITTED TO 400KW, BUT WE CAN INSTALL UP TO 1400KW OF SOLAR. WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS PRODUCE AS MUCH AS 1.6-MEGAWATT HOURS OF ENERGY A YEAR IN PRODUCTION, WHICH IS A HUGE AMOUNT. NEXT SLIDE. AND THIS IS HOW WE GET TO NET ZERO. SO OUR TARGET ENERGY USE INTENSITY, WHICH IS BASICALLY ENERGY USE PER SQUARE FOOT. OUR PRODUCTION IS 11-KILOWATT HOURS PER SQUARE FOOT BUT OUR HOME USAGE, WE ARE TARGETING IT TO BE UNDER 6KW PER SQUARE FOOT. WHICH WOULD GIVE US ENOUG TO POWER THESE HOMES AND THE AUTOMOBILES FOR EACH ONE OF THESE HOMES. NEST SLIDE. WE ARE PLANNING FOR THE -- NEXT SLIDE. WE ARE PLANNING FOR THE MARKET RATE HOMES, BATTERY BACKUP AND STORAGE FOR THOSE HOMES. NEXT SLIDE. AND AS DAVID MENTIONED, THE AVON COMMUNITY BUILDING IS GOING TO BE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PILOT PROJECT, TARGETING NET ZERO ENERGY. THEIR PLAN IS TO HAVE SOLAR ON THAT BUILDING. NEXT SLIDE. BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK, WHAT WE HAVE ENDED UP WITH, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF AREA THAT IS UNABLE TO HAVE SOLAR. AN ADDITIONAL 44,000 SQUARE FEET OF ROOF TOP BECAUSE OFARRIERS TO SAR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS TRUE FOR MOST MULTIFAMILY HOUSING. SO NEXT SLIDE. WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GET TO ENERGY DEMOCRACY. HOW DO WE MAKE SOLAR THAT'S BENEFICIAL TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND NOT JUST PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS. FOR FOUR YEARS, I HAVE BEEN WORKING REAL Le, REALLY DEEPLY TO FORM COLLABORATIONS FOR FOLKS TO FORM A PATHWAY. I'M REAL EXCITED TO SHARE WITH Y'ALL TONIGHT THAT THIS MORNING, WE HAD A PHONE CALL WITH THE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, SOME PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION MEMBERS AND MULTIPLE PEOPLE, HIGH LEVEL EXECUTIVES FROM DTE, WHO ARE ALL IN TO WORK WITH US TO CREATE GRID INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION. AND SO WE ARE PARTNERING WITH DTE, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AND ANN ARBOR, AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER FOLKS TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GET THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY TO DO, TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT A SINGLE DEVELOPER CAN DO ON ANY GIVEN SINGLE FAMILY HOME. NEXT SLIDE. FOR THE THRIVE PORTION, WE ARE PLANNING ON ABUNDANT E CHARGING. EVERY GARAGE WILL HAVE ITS OWN EV CHARGING. WE ARE PROVIDING REFRIGERATORS AND PROVIDE NECESSARIES AS WELL. NEXT SLIDE. AND HUMAN-POWERED MOBILITY, OF COURSE, WE WILL DEFAULT TO THAT. WE HAVE 179 BIKE BASES AND 124 OF WHICH ARE ENCLOSES AND EV BIKE SHARE PROGRAM. NEXT SLIDE. AND TO MAKE THE BIKE OWNERSHIP EASY, WE HAVE A FOUR SEASON BIKE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR SHED THAT WILL HAVE BIKE STORAGE IN THE FARMHOUSE COMMONS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING AVALON. NEXT SLIDE. AND ONE OTHE COOLEST COMMUNITY AMENITIES WE HAVE IS THIS SMALL RETAIL BUILDING, WE'RE CALLING THE FARM HOUSE, WHICH IS PLANNED TO BE THE HOME FOR THE HONEY LOCUST FARM STOP AND IT CAN BE USED FOR OFFICES, AND THIS' A MONTESSORI SCHOOL INTERESTED IN THERE OR IT COULD BE RESIDENTIAL. IT'S MULTIPLE THINGS. IT'S REALLY COOL TO THING THAT ACTUALLY THIS IDEA OF VERIDIAN ITSELF WAS BORN OUT OF A SERENDIPITOUS OBSERVATION THAT I HAD AT ARGUS FARM STOP IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNITY ASSET. THE OTHER REALLY NEAT ASSET IS THE BARN. WE ARE RESTORING A BARN THAT WE AREETTING FRO A PROPERTY RIGHT NEARBY, WHICH WILL BE REALLY NEAT SPACE, AND NEXT SLIDE. THE STORMWATER, THERE'S NO RETENTION PONDS. WE ARE FINDING WAYS TO INTEGRATE ALL THE WATER THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SITE AND REALLY CREATE A RESOURCE FOR THE RAIN, RATHER THAN A APOCALYPTIC THING. AND THE NEXT SLIDE. AND ALONG WITH OUR ZERO WASTE GOALS, WE ARE DOING A LIVING MATERIALS PLAN, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE COMPULSORY COMPOSTING. NEXT SLIDE. AND YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE ABUNDANT PARK CONNECTIONS 'S PLANNED FOR HUMANS AND NOT FOR CARS. AND THE NEXT SLIDE. AND MOST OF OUR SPACES ARE GOING TO BE ADAPTABLE AND RESILIENT AND DESIGNED WITH ACCESSIBILITY IN MIND. AND NEXT SLIDE. REALLY OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THIS TO BEAUTIFUL THAT IT WILL DELIGHT D INSPIRE F GENERATIONS. THE BIGGEST RISK IS THAT IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL BUT WE CAN'T REPLICATE IT. WE ARE PLANNING OPEN HOUSE TOURS AND INTERPRETIVE SIGNAGE FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THE LAST SLIDE. SO WE DON'T KNOW IF HANITY CAN TRANSFORM FAST ENOUGH. WE CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT WE CAN HAVE A LIVING FUTURE. BY GOD, WE BETTER START NOW. SO YOUR VOTE OF RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT IS REALLY THE ACTION THAT GRETA THUNBERG TALKS ABOUT THAT CAN EARN US HOPE. THANKS AND LET'S OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS.
01:43:20.383: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MS. DELEO, YOU HAVE MOREO ADD?
01:43:28.691: >> YES, I DO. NOT MUTED. I WILL DO ANOTHER BIT OF SCREEN SHARING. BEAR WITH ME FOR A SECOND. I WILL MUMBLE ALONG AS I OPEN THIS ONE UP. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. I'M GOING TO -- FOR BREVITY, I WILL LEAVE MOST OF THE TALK ABOUT THE SITE PLANS TO THE AVALON AND THRIVE TEAMS, BUT I WILL BE HITTING HIGHLIGHTS OF THE STAFF REPORT AND MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT THE PUD PROCESS AND THE PUD ZONING DISTRICT AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS AND OUR STAFF ANALYSIS. STARTING FROM SORT OF THE BEGINNING, THIS IS A COLLECTION OF THREE PETITNS, THE VERIDIAN AT COUNTY FARM PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, THE SUPPLEMENTALERIDIAN AT COUNTY FH SITE PLAN WHICH IS THE PETITIONER IS AVALON HOUSING AND VERIDIAN AT COUNTY FARMS SOUTH SITE PLAN, PETITIONER AND DEVELOPER IS THRIVE COLLABORATIVE. SO THERE ARE THREE MOTIONS IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. THE -- SUPER AND BRIEF SUMMARY, THE REZONING IS A PETITION TO REZONE A 12.8-ACRE SITE FROM PL, PUBLIC LAND, SCREEN SHARING IS PAUSED. IS IT BACK TO SCREEN SRING? Planning nager:  YES.
01:45:06.956: >> IT'S A 12.8-ACRE SITE FROM PL, PUBLIC LAND TO PUD, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT, AND WE HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS GOING ALONG WITH IT, FOR A MIXED TYPE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH COMMUNITY SPACES AND ADVANCED CONSTRUCTION METHODS, INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE AFFOABLE HOUSING ANDLSO WITH US TONIGHT IS THE NORTH SITE MAP. IT'S FOR 50 AFFORDABLE APARTMENT HOMES AND THE SOUTH SITE PLAN, A PLAN FOR 99 HOMES, DETACHED, ATTACHED APARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS. THE -- WHERE DID WE GO? I WILL GO BACK. EUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS WERE WRITTEN BECAUSE THE PUD IS A CUSTOM ZONING DISTRICT. THEY AREINN TO ENABLE THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT, WHILE REQUIRING THE FEATURES, AT MENNITIES AND THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT JUSTIFY THE PUD TO BE REALIZED AND MAINTAINED. THERE ARE THREE PREDOMINANT BENEFITS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, MID INCOMEESIDENTIAL AND SUSTAINABLE LIVING. WE HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT -- THAT CONTAIN A PURPOSE STATEMENT, APPLICABILITY, THE FINDINGS THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS EVENING AND THE THREGULATIONS ADDRESS PRINCIPAL AND ACCESSORY USES AND LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, COMMUNITY-ORIENTED DESIGN AND SUSTAINABILITY. THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS DIVIDE THE DISTRICT INTO TWO COMPONENTS, NORTH AND SOUTH. NORTH AGAIN IS AVALON AND SOUTH IS THRIVE. SOME THINGS ARE ADDRESSED HOLISTICALLY, THE PRINCIPAL USE OF THE DISTRICT IS RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS. ACCESSORY USES, THERE'S A LOT OF COMMON ACCESSORY USES, BUT WE HAVE GOT SOME THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO THE SOUTH ONLY, MEANING ONLY THRIVE WILL BE ALLOWED TO HAVE RETAIL, POSSIBLY RESTAURANT OUTDOOR SALES, PERSONAL SERVICES. THE DENSITY IS 16 DWELLING UNITS ACROSS T ENTIRE DISTRICT. 16 DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE. YOU'VE GOT FLOOR AREA ADDRESSED. SETBACKS ARE ADDRESSED. MINIMUM 10 FEET FROM PLATT ROAD. LET ME SAY THIS. IN THE STAFF REPORT, IT'S WRITTEN 20 FEET FROM THE NORTH AND THE WESTBO WESTBOUNDARRY, LE COME BACK TO THAT. WE HAVE HEIGHT ADDRESSED AND PARKING ADDRESSED AND WE HAVE LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING ADDRESSED BUT PUT AN HER ASTERISK BY THAT. THE COMMUNITY ORIENTED DESIGN, WHICH ARE TAKEN FROM THE MASTER PLAN. IT'S THE BENEFIT OF THIS PUD, THAT WE ARE NOT JUST ENCOURAGING SOME OF T OUR COMMUNITY--ORIENTED DESIG BUT HERE WE ARE REQUIRING. IT REGARDING THE PUD PROCESS, ALL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS GO THROUGH A FIVE-STEP PROCESS, STARTING WITH CITIZEN PARTICIPATION. THIS ONE, IN PARTICULAR, HAD WILL MORE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION THAN USUAL IN THAT THE COUNTY ENTERED ITS OWN PROCESS FOR WHAT TO DO. THEY CALL IT DISPOSITION WHICH IS I THINK A FANCY TERM FOR SELLING. BUT THEY WENT THROUGH A PROCESS FOR IF WE WERE TO DISPOSE OF THE PROPERTY, HOW SHOULD IT BE DEVELOPED? SO THEY WENT THROUGH A COMMUNITY PROCESS FOR THAT, CAME UP WITH THEIR PREFERRED USE, AND THEN THEY WENT OUT FOR AN RFP, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, LOOKING FOR DEVELOPERS AND THEY HAND SELECTED THE THRIVE COLLABORATIVE AVALON TEAM AND PUT A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS ON THEM TO PUT FORWARD TO YOU WHAT THEY WANTED. PROCESS INCLUDES PREAPPLICATION MEETING, THAT'S WITH STAFF, A CONFERENCE WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION. WE DID THAT LAST YEAR, AND THEN TONIGHT IS STEPS FOUR AND FIVE COMBINED. THE ZONING DISTRICT REVIEW, AND SITE PLAN REVIEW. THEY COULD BE SEPARATED BUT WE ARE PROPOSING THEM TOGETHER, WHICH IS ALLOWED. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS HAVE EIGHT STANDARDS OF APPROVAL. AND BRIEFLY, THEY ARE THAT THE DISTRICT HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT FOR THE CITY. ALSO, THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE IN ANOTHER DISTRICT. THIS IS NOT TO GET OUT OF DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS. THISES THIS IS TO MAKE UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS, THAT ARE MORE ROBUST. IT CAN'T HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON PUBLIC UTILITIES AND IT NEEDS TOE CONSIENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN OR JUSTIFY THE DEVIATION. IT NEEDS TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND YOU NEED TO DOCUMENT THAT ALL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION ARE SAFE, CONVENIENT, ET CETERA, AND IF YOU ARE PROPOSING ANY DEVIATION, THAT THEY AREIMITED TOHE MINIM NECESSARY. FOR STAFF, WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE PROPOSED PUD MEET ALL OF THE STANDARDS OF APPROVAL, FOR THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS REQUIREMENT. IT'S NOTABLY AND DIRECT QUOTE, APRIL INNOVATION IN LAND USE AND VARIETY IN DESIGN, LAYOUT AND TYPES OF STRUCTURES THAT FURTHERS THE STATED DESIGN GOALS AND PHYSICAL CHARACTER OF THE ADOPTED LAND USE PLANS AND POLICIES. STAFF, WE FEEL ALMOST THAT THE PUD WAS WRITTEN FOR THIS TYPE OF PROJECT, BECAUSE OF ITS, AGAIN, QUOTING FROM THE STANDARDS OF APPROVAL LANGUAGE, IT'S AN INNOVATIVE LAND USE AND IT'S GOT THAT VARIETY OF DIGN THAT WE DON'T NORMALLY SEE. WE HAVE ALSO FOUNDT MEETS ALL THE OTHER STANDARDS OF APPROVAL. THE SITE PLANS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED, AND THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSED PLAN UNIT DEVELOPMENT -- I'M SORRY, CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSED PUD SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE UDC THAT CANNOT BE AMENDED THROUGH THE PUD PROCESS. ONE EXAMPLE, OIL EROSION, ANOTHER EXAMPLE, STORM WALTER SR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS. I WILL NOTE THAT OUR ORIGINAL STAFF REPORT PUBLISHED ON FRIDAY CONTAINED AN ERROR, WHICH HAS BEEN REDONE. I INCORRECTLY SAID THAT AVALON HAD THREE-STORYUILDINGS THEY A TWO-STO BUILDINGS. AND I HAD SOME HYPERLINKS THAT WERE BROKEN. SO WE PUBLISHED A NEW STAFF REPORT FOR THAT. AND THEN, THOUGH, SINCE THAT TIME, WE ARE ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER A COUPLE MORE CHANGES AND SO I'M ASKING YOU TO PUT FORTH AN AMENDMENT ON THE FLOOR AND APPROVE IT AS PART OF THE PROJECT. THERE ARE A COUPLE OFHE. E, REGARDING SETBACKS, AND LET ME TRY TO GET THAT LASER POINTER BACK. ALL RIGHT. HERE, THE REAR SETBACK, WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE WEST SIDE. WE HAVE WRITTEN IN 20 FEET AND I'M ASKING YOU TO CHANGE IT TO 15. SOME OF THE AVALON BUILDINGS ARE CLOSER THAN 20, AND SO 15 WOULD COVER IT. THAT IS AN ERROR ON MY PART. I SHOULD HAVE ORIGINALLY WRITTEN 15, BUT I DID NOT, AND I'M ASKING FOR AN AMENDMENT. A SECOND -- A SECOND ADDITIONAL CHANGE THAT I'M ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER ARE CLANGING THE STANDARDS FOR -- CHANGING THE STANDARDS FOR LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERS. I HAVE A STRIKEOUT VERSION, AND A COPY WAS ALSO EMAILED. STRIKING OUT THE WEST AND NORTH BUFFER AND THE VEHICULAR USE AREA. WE ARE STRIKING THESE OUT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE SAME AS CURRENT CODE REQUIREMENTS. SO NO NEED TO RE-INVENT THE WHEEL AND REPEAT IT. STANDAS FOR LANDSCAPING, SCREENING AND BUFFERING IN THE UDC SHALL APPLY TO THE DISTRICT. WITH ONE EXCEPTION THAT WE'LL KEEP, THE SOUTH DISTRICT GETS AN ENHANCED BUFFER. AND IT IS ENHANCED BECAUSE THAT WAS THE RESULT OF PETITIONER'S COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION THAT ADJACE NEIGHBO WTED LITTLE BIT OF AN ENHANCED BUFFER. SO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NORMAL BUFFER, NO POINT WILL BE LESS THAN 15 FEET, BUT THAT BUFFER WILL BE ENHANCED BY HAVING AN AVERAGE OF 25 FEET. SOME PLACES WILL BE MUCH WIDER THAN 25 FEET, AND ALL CASES WIDER THAN THE 15. WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE A LITTLE FLIBILITYOR MEANDERING AROUND SOME EXISTING FEATURES. WE ALSO GOT -- AND IT'S WRITTEN HERE FOR A 75 DECIDUOUS OR EVERGREEN TREES EVENLY SPACED. I THINK WE MAY NEED TO TAKE THAT DOWN TO 50 TREES, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE WE DID SOME MATH WRONG, BUT IT -- THIS IS NO LESS THAN NORMALLY REQUIRED. ALSO, WHEREAS THE NORMAL CONFLICTING LAB USE BUFFER IS A HEDGE WALL OR SHRUBS. WE ARE SAYING SPECIFICALLY A HEDGE ROW. A HEDGE ROW HERE SPECIFICALLY WITH DENSE SHRUBS. I UNDERSTAND THAT CAMEIRECTLY FROM THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORS. AND THEN THE THIRD CHANGE TO CONSIDER IS, I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO NECESSARILY APPROVE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE I WOULD LIKE YOU TO APPROVE A CONCEPT FOR AFFORDABLE HSING. THE CONCEPT IS 15% OF THE DWELLING UNIT UNITS ARE AFFORDAE AND THAT WOULD BE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT, BUT WE HAVE DISCOVERED IN CRAFTING THE PUD SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT IT NEEDS TO WORK BOTH WAYS AND WE NEED TO ANTICIPATE AND HAVE A PROVISION IN CASE ONE COMPONENT DELOPED SOONER THAN THE OTHER COMPONENT. IF -- SO TO ACHIEVE -- SO EACH ONE OF THEM NEEDS TO INDIVIDUALLY ADDRESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, THIS IS THE PROPOSED DENSITY IS MORE THAN THE UNDERLYING ZONING. THE P L. DISTRICT HAS A ZERO IT'SOT FOR RESIDENTIAL. SO THEREFORE, EVEN ONE HOME ON THE SITE IS MORE THAN THE UNDERLYING ZONING. SO OUR GOAL HERE IS ABSOLUTELY, WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE 15% OF THE DWELLING UNITS ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THAT THIS WL BE ACCOMPLISHED ONLYL. ONE WAY ON THE NORTH COMPONENT THAT ALL THE DWELLING UNITS ARE AFORWAFORWARDABLE HOUSING -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING AVALON IS COMFORTABLE. THE SOUTH, THEY CAN BUILD 15% OF THEIR UNITS AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS OPTION MIGHT BE UTILIZEF THEY BAK GROUND AND THEN LOOK FOR CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY FIRST. A SECOND OPTION THAT THEY CAN DO IS THEY COULD BUILD AVALON'S SITE PLAN FOR THEM. OR IF AVALON BUILDS IT, THEY CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR SOME OF THE UNITS THAT ARE ON AVALON'S SITE. AND IF ALL OF AVAN'S UNITS ARE BILL AND AFFORDABLE, THE ENTIRE DISTRICT DOES HAVE 15% MINIMUM AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A THIRD OPTION THAT WE'LL OFFER THEM IS A PAYMENT IN LIEU. AND SO THAT MIGHT GIVE THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY IN SECURING THEIR FINANCING BUT STILL PROVIDE THE CITY ASSURANCES THAT WE ARE GOING TO RLIZE AFFDABLE UNITS. THE PAYMENT IN LIEU COULD EVEN POTENTIALLY BE REFUNDED WHEN AVALON BUILDS THEIR UNITS, OR COULD BE JUST TURNED OVER TO HELP AVALON IN SOME WAY. I'M NOT IN THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THE OPTIONS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBITY T I WANT TO ASSURE TH PLANNING COMMISSION THAT WE ARE IN ALL OPTIONS -- IN ALL OPTIONS, WE ARE LOOKING FOR TO ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE THAT THE CITY REALIZES THE BENEFIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THIS PROJECT IS PROPOSING. AND WE'LL REALIZE THIS BENEFIT NO MATTER WHO BREAKS GROUND FIRST PAN AND NO MATTER WHO CLOS FIRST. SO WITH THAT, I WILL STOP TALKING, EXCEPT TO REITERATE THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL. I'M ASKING FOR A FEW ADDITIONAL CHANGES, BUT WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL FOR EACH OF THE THREE PETITIONS ON THE FLOOR. THE APPLICANT TEAM, BOTH ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. MYSELF AND MR. LENART ARE ALSO HEREO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.
01:58:20.415: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MS. DELEO. IT'S 9:00 I'M GOING TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND IF WE NEED A BREAK, WE'LL DO IT AFTER PUBLIC HEING. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED PUD ZONING AND SEAT PLANS FOR 2270 PLATT ROAD. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247 AND THEN ENTERING MEETING ID 97711501143. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT THE CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HANDS. YOU CAN RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE, AND WHEN SPEAKING PLEASE DO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS.
01:59:18.440: >> Planning Manager:  JUST GIVE IT A FEW MOMENTS.
01:59:24.046: >> Chair Mills: SURE.
01:59:41.063: >> ALEXIS WHILE WES WE ARE WAIT, WE HAVE AN ERROR LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT EAT COULD ADDRESS FOR US, IF THIS -- THAT HEATH COULD ADDRESS FOR US, IF THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME.
01:59:53.508: >> Chair Mills: WE'LL PUT A PIN ON THAT AND ASK THE QUESTION WHEN WE COME BACK. IT LOOKS LIKE A COUPLE OF FOLKS MAY HAVE JOINE IF YOU ARE INTESTED IN MAKING THE PUBLIC COMMENT PRESS STAR NINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND.
02:00:11.193: >> Planning Manager:  CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH NUMBER 034, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE VERIDIAN PROPOSAL.
02:00:23.238: >> HELLO, MY NAMES SUSAN BOWERS, I'M AT 2400 SOUTH HURON PARKWAY.
02:00:31.813: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD.
02:00:33.348: >> I WOULD LIKE TO QUESTION OR ASK HAS THERE BEEN A TRAFFIC STUDY DONE FOR THE IMPACT ON PLATT ROAD?
02:00:45.460: >> Chair Mills: SO DURING PUBLIC COMMENT, FEEL FREE TO SAY ANY OF YOUR -- OR BRING UP ANY OF YOUR COMMENTS, AND THIS IS SOMETHING IN OUR DISCUSSION THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS.
02:00:58.473: >> OKAY. MY QUESTION BEING IS WE ARE THE BUSINESS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET RIGHT AT THE CORNER OF HURON PARKWAY AND PLATT AND I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT THIS COULD PRODUCE ON PTT ROD AND HAS THAT BEEN REVIEWED AND ADDRESSED. THAT'S JUST MY BIGGEST CONCERN. EVERYTHING ELSE IS SUPER EXCITING, JUST LOOKING FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN GET IN AND OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY IF WE NEED TO. THAT'S MY ONLY COMME.
02:01:27.602: >> Chair MillsTHANK YOU VY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENT. ARE THIS AN THERE ANY OTHERS THD LIKE TO COMMENT AT THIS TIME?
02:01:55.363: >> Planning Manager:  I'M NOT SEEING ANY OTHER.
02:01:57.666: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. THEN I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. LET'S READ THE MOTIONS, AND MOVE THEM AND THEN WE'LL TAKE A BREAK IF THAT'S OKAY. SO THERE ARE THREE MOTIONS. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE RECOMMENDATI IS THAT WE DO TAKE THEM ALL TOGETHER TONIGHT, THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE. SO THAT'S WHAT I WILL READ ALL THREE AND ASK A COMMISSIONER TO MOVE THEM WHEN I'M DONE. SO FIRST IS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE VERIDIAN AT COUNTY FARM PUD ZONING DISTRICT AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. ANNING COMMIION HEREBYBOR CITY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE VERIDIAN AT COUNTY FARM NORTH SITE PLAN AVALON HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO LAND DIVISION APPROVAL PRIOR TO APPLYING FOR ANY PERMITS AND THE THIRD IS THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING -- THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE VERIDIAN AT COUNT FARM SOUTH SITE PLAN FOR THE THRIVE COLLABORATIVE, AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO LAND DIVISION APPROVAL PRIOR TO APPLYING FOR ANY PERMITS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. I HAVE 9:04 ON MY COMPUTER. LET'S COME BACK AT 9:10, RED FOY FOR DISCUSSION, HYDRATED AND SUCH. ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. [ BREAK ]
02:10:47.762: >> Planning Manager:  THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU CITY PLANNER, DELEO, FOR A GRE SUMMARY. I WANT TO ADD A -- JUST A ANOTHER NOTE OR TWO, PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVISIONS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS SPECIFIC IMPORTANCE TO ME, AND I THINK ALEXIS DID A GREAT JOB AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THIS NOTION OF CONCEPTS. OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE REGARDLESS OF TIMING, WE HAVE THE -- THE MEANS TO ENSURE THAT AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE REALIZED AT THE SITE AT A MINIMUM OF 15%, HOPEFULLY MORE IS PROPOSED. WE ARE EXPLORING THOSE OPTIONS, FRANKLY, FLEXIBILITY TO THE COMBINATION OF AVALON A DRIVE, BUT TO BE CLEAR, WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE, SO THE PUD DISTRICT ENSURES THE SAME FOR WHATEVER HAPPENS ON THE SITE, THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE METHODS OF MEETING THAT GOAL. AND SO I WANTED TO CLARIFY -- I APPRECIATE THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S VALIDATION THAT THS AN IMPORTANT GOAL FOR YOU. THE PROVISIONS ARE WAYS FOR US TO GET THERE. I THINK -- IT'S CONCEPTS. I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. IT WILL PROBABLY BE SOME TYPE OF SUPPLEMEAL REGULATIO AND DEVELOENT AGREEMENTS BUT OUR GOAL IS TO COMMUNICATE THOSE CONCEPTS SO YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE END RESULTS, AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS MOO EIGHT THERE MIGHT BESOME REFINEMENTS . I WANTED TO ADD THAT ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE TO THE DISCUSSION POINT.
02:12:44.612: >> Commissionerbrons:  CAN I WILL ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION? DID YOU SAY THAT THAT LANGUAGE WAS IN THE PACKET?
02:12:50.918: >> Planning Manager:  IT WAS PROVIDED IN AN UPDATED SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT I THINK ALEXIS HAS. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN SHARED WITH YOU, BUT WE COULD SHARE THAT LANGUAGE AND PULL THAT UP, IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE SPECIFICALLY.
02:13:13.441: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:13:14.509: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IN LOOKING TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THROUGH THE LEGISTAR, I THINK IT'S IN THERE. THAT'S WHAT I WAS WORKING OFF AS I WAS PREPARING FOR MEETING. SHOULD WE ASSUME THAT THE ITEMS THAT MS. DELEO --
02:13:35.163: >> Planning Manager:  CAN YOU PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHERE THE REVISED LANGUAGE THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY IS.
02:13:45.740: >> YES, I CAN. AND HERE WE GO.
02:14:03.591: >> HERE WE GO. HERE'S THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT WERE -- THEY ARE IN LEGISTAR RIGHT NOW AND THEYERE EMAILED VERY LATE IN THE DAY. I WILL SCROLL DOWN BECAUSE WE HAVE IN HERE WITH TRACK CHANGES. IHINK I HAVE GONE TOO FAR. HOLD ON. THESE E NOT WITH TRACK CHANGES.
02:14:36.958: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK --
02:14:40.761: >> YEAH. SO I APOLOGIZE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TRACK CHANGES IN THE CONVERSION TO ZOOM. BUT YOU WILL SEE HERE THAT WE HAVE -- WE HAD WORKED ON ALTERNATE LANGUAGE -- I GUESS LET ME SAY THIS, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. OUR CONCEPT WAS STILL BEFORE. WE ARE -- WE ARE STILL WANTING THE 15% FROM THE DISTRICT WIDE AND THEY HAVE TO DO ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT WAS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT WERE ISSUED.PACKET. BUT WE WORKED ON ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE CAR AND PROVIDEORE THE OPTIONS, MORE THE IF/THEN SORT OF THING, ANTICIPATING THE DIFFERENT START TIMES AND COMPLETION TIMES AND WE CAME UP WITH MORE LANGUAGE THAT AGAIN -- THE CONCEPT HAS NEVER CHANGED AND ON MY SCREEN HERE, WE GOT THRIVE, THE PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE FOLLOWING BEING ONE, TWO AND THREE, AND THEN THERE'S AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF HERE. AS WE ARE WORKING THROUGH IT, THE CONCEPT IS NEVER CHANGING, BUT WE ARE WONDERING IF IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THIS LEL  SPECIFICITY IN A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT OR HAVE THIS -- OR KEEP IT HERE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. AND WE'RE NOT -- WE NEED TO CONSULT MORE WITH LEGAL AND OUR ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ON JUST THE BEST HOME FOR IT. WE ARE NOT REALLY ASKING TO CHANGE THE RECOMMEND IS.
02:16:18.959: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:16:19.960: >> WE ARE JUST TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT HOME FOR I
02:16:22.563: >> Councilmemb Ackerman: OKAY. SO AS A MATTER OF -- SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE. I UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE. I FIGURED IT WOULD BE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS AND I WAS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. AS A MATTER OF PROCESS, WOULD YOU LIKE US TO MAKE A MOTION AT WE'RE COMFORTLE WITH THIS LANGUAGE AND THAT BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS PROJECT, CITY COUNCIL PRESUMABLY -- BETWEEN THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE AND CITY COUNCIL, THAT WE GIVE YOU THE SPACE TO DECIDE --
02:17:00.301: >> YES, PLEASE. I THINK WE ARE ASKING REGARDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE, IN YR DISCUSSIO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS FLEXIBLE APPROACH.
02:17:14.849: >> YEAH. SAY COMPARED TO -- SAY YOU SAY, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, THIS OTHER THING IS IMPORTANT TO US. AND THEN IFOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT, A MOTION THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZING STAFF TO HAMMER OUT THE VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS IN KEEPING WITH THE CONCEPT THAT YOU CHOOSE.
02:17:38.339: >> Councilmember Ackerman: BEAUTIFUL. OKAY. THEN I WILL MAKE SURE THAT'S LAST THING I SPEAK AUT.
02:17:49.984: >>hair Mills: ETT, DID YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING?
02:17:51.385: >> Planning Manager:  YES. ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD LOOK AT IT. ALEXIS HIGHLIGHTED ALL THE PROPOSED CHANGED IN THE UPDATED SUPPLEMENTAL REGS. WE WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT OUR RECOMMENDATION IS FOR YOU ADOPT THE AMENDED VERSIONS. IT INCLUDES ALL THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LANGUAGE THAT WAS JUST REFERENCED I WANT IT TO BE CLEAR, SOME OF THA LANGUE MAY END UP REALIZED IN A DIFFERENT FORMAT, BUT SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. THE CRITICAL THING IS YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE CONCEPTED AND IF YOU ADOPT IT AS PRESENTED. I WANTED TO BE HONEST WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION, WE MAY ULTIMATELY PROGRESS TO CITY COUNL AND SAY, W THINK THESE ASPECTS ARE BETTER INCORPORATED IN ANOTHER DOCUMENT.
02:18:37.531: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT. BECAUSE I THINK I SAW IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT AT CITY COUNCIL, I WOULD HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE PROPOSAL. JUST KIDDING.
02:18:46.240: >> Chair Mills: I WANT TO HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION, THOUGH. BECAUSE THERE WERE A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT ALEXIS HIGHLIGHTED CHANGED. INCLUDING THE REAR SETBACK VERSIONS. THE VERSION THAT'S ON -- WHEN WE VOTE, LIKE, DO WE NEED TO MOVE THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT CHANGED FROM THE ORIGINAL PACKET, OR THAT'S THE VERSION THAT'S THERE NOW. ARE CAN WE EFFECTIVELY DAY, THK YOU FOR H HIGHLIGHTING DIFFERENCES? WHAT IS DIFFERENT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY VOTING OPEN INCLUDES THE 15-FOOT SETBACK RATHER THAN A 20 FEET SETBACK AND THE SIMPLIFIED UDC ENHANCED BUFFER LANGUAGE. IS THAT --
02:19:31.819: >> Planning Manager:  YOU CAN DO THE LATTER.
02:19:40.294: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. WITH WE ARE PRESENTING YOU UPDATED. WE HAVE SUMMARIZED THE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGED ON THAT AND YOU CAN SAY ACTION ON THE AMENDED VERSION. GO AHEAD, ZACK.
02:19:56.710: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WANT TO MAKE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS AND ASK SOME QUESTIONS AN THEN I DOESN'T SOUNDIKE WE NEED TO MAKE ANY AMENDMENTS. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE CAN WORK OFF THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS IN LEDG LEGISTAR ART WE ARE VOTING ON TONIGHT, WHICH THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I GUESS TURNING TO SOME GENERAL COMMENTS. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY FOR A A WHILE. I RAN INTO MR. GROCOFF AND I TOLD HIM I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THIS MEETING, IN TWO WEEKS BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO FOR THREE YEARS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN CONSTRUCTED VERIDIAN AT COUNTY FARM PARK, IT WILL BE THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECT THAT WE WILL HAVE WORKED ON. IT'S VERY TANGIBLE AND REAL AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S HERE, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PLANNING FOR TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. OUR COMMUNITY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THEITE OF A DECOMMISSIONED JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER TO BUILD THE GREENEST AND EQUITABLE, IN THE INCITY, THE STATE, AND THE ENTIRE GREAT LAKES REGION. WE ARE TAKING A SITE WHERE WE USED TO PUT STRUGGLING KIDS AND GRESEGREGATE THEM FROM SOCIETY. AND WE TRANSFORM IT INTO SOMETHING THAT PRODUCES MORE ENERGY VERSUS SOLAR THAN IT CONSUMES. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE MISSION THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF. NOT ONLY IS THE MISSION JUST ANDMENTRIGHT AND TIMELY, AND THY MADE IT BEAUTIFUL THROUGH THE ARCHITECTURE AND LANDSCAPING DESIGN. I THINK WHEN WE NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER DEVELOPERS TO MAKE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS, BUT WHEN WE ARE NEGOTIATING WITH OTHER DEVELOPERS, ITS SOMETHING LIKE THIS, THAT I THINK WE ALL ENVISION THAT WE WANT TO STRIVE FOR. MEANINGFUL AMOUNTS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, TRUE SUSTAINABILITY. IT'S SITING TO GET TO VOTE ON IT IN A TRUE FOR SO THANKSES IN GROCOFF AND MS. CARTE-SAX OP. AND THEN ALSO A BIG THANK YOU TO THE NEIGHBORS. YOU KNOW, I WAS SURPRISED WE DIDN'T GET MANY COMMENTS TONIGHT, BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ORGANIZING ANDCTIVISM TT HAPPENED IN E IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD IN 2017. THIS SITS IN THE WARD THAT I REPRESENT AND I HAVE SEEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS BRING THEMSELVES TOGETHER EVEN IF ITAUS IMDIATE DISRUION TO THEIR LIVES THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE SITE IMPACTS OF ADDED TRAFFIC. SO TO FOLKS LINE JEANINE PALMS, YOU TOOK WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A DIVISIVE DEVELOPMENT AND TURNED IT INTO SOMETHING THAT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD COULD RALLY BEHIND. IT SUPER BEAUTIFULO MATCH. SO THANKS TO THEN AS LITTLE. ULTIMATELY, I WOULD BE HAPPY AND PROUD TO VOTE FOR THIS TONIGHT, EXACTLY AS IT IS. I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO IT. I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS, THOUGH, JUST AS CLARIFIERS. THE FIRST IS TO THE DEVELOPER ARE THERE RENDERING DATED JULY 2019, ARE THOSE THE MOST ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE AESTHETIC THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE?
02:24:15.068: >> ARE YOU REFERRING TO -- FIRST, ZACK, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU HAD ME CHOKED UP. ARE U REFERRING TO THE ELEVATION RENDERINGS OF THE HOME?
02:24:29.349: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES, AND THERE'S ALSO SOME -- AND STOCK PHOTOGRAPHS OF BEAUTIFUL HOMES AROUND THE --
02:24:36.456: >> YEAH, THANKS FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION, BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS NO, THOSE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TENDED TO  CONCEUAL DESIGNS. EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE WHAT WE MIGHT BUILD THERE. WE HAVE DELIBERATELY WAITED UNTIL THIS STAGE TO DESIGN EVERYTHING VERTICALLY BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING ON THE GROUND IS WORKING AND THEN WORK FROM LITERALLY FROM BENEATH THE SOIL, MEGAN GLOID CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THAT. AND THEN WE ARE DESIGNING AS WE GO FROM THERE. AND THEN ALSO, THAT HELPS AS THE DEVELOPER THAT YOU CAN ADAPT DIFFERENT UNIT TYPES AS MARKET CHANGES HAPPEN AND PANDEMICS HAPPEN. SO FAR ALL THE UNIT TYPES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. INTERIOR FLOOR PLANS MAY CHANGE. THE DESIGN IS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE PLACE. AND THE FARMHOUSE WILL HAVE A SIMILAR FEEL AND A LOT OF IT WILL HAVE A SIMILAR FEEL.
02:25:42.890: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO IS ATTACHMENT K A BETTER REPRESENTATION? THAT'S THE SITE PLAN WITH BUILDINGS ATTACHMENT?
02:25:51.798: >> WHICH -- ALEXIS, CAN YOU PUT THAT UP, ATTACHMENT K? AND WHILE SHE'S PULLING THAT UP. THERE WAS A -- THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU WILL BE VOTING ON TONIGHT, I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO GET THAT IN, ALEXIS, WE NOTICED THERE WAS AN ERROR ON SOUTH SETBACK AND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, HEATH HARTT FROM M CAN ADDRESS THAT. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 30 FEET. IT SAYS 50. 50 WOULD -- YOU KNOW, THE BARN IS WITHIN 50 FEET OF THAT, AND SO -- SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A 20-FOOT SETBACK ON THE NORTH SIDE, WE WOULD HAVE A 30-FOOT SETBACK BUT NOT A 50-FOOT SETBACK.
02:26:29.870: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK WE CAN ADDRESS THAT. YEA I WT TO MAKE SURE HAD SURE THAT WE DON'T MISS A DETAIL THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT.
02:26:41.581: >> THE SCREEN SHARE IS ATTACHMENT K AND IT WAS TAKEN FROM THE CURRENT SITE PLAN PACKAGE. I WILL MOVE THROUGH THEM QUICKLY AND THEN TELL ME IF YOU ARE GOOD OR IF YOU WANT TO MOVE BACK. SHEET ONE.
02:27:02.703: >> ZACK, ARE THESE THE SHEETS THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO?
02:27:06.173: >> YEP.
02:27:06.440: >> I CAN LET BEN WITH COMMUNITY PLANNING ADDRESS THAT. AGAIN, ALL OF THESE DESIGNS THAT YOU SEE HERE, THESE ARE NOT -- THESE ARE NOT DESIGNS FOR VERIDIAN -- THEY ARE DESIGNED FOR VERIDIAN, BUT THEY ARE NOT WHAT IS GOING TO BE BUILT AS IS. THESE ARE JUST CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS, PRIMARILY TO REALLY KIND OF JUST GIVE A FEEL OF WHAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD MAY LOOK LIKE. THEY HAVE SOME FUNKY ROOF SHAPES AND THINGS AND ON THE GROUND WITH BA LANDSCAPING IT WILL BE BALANCED OUT. THEY ALLOW FOR SOLAR ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDE BY HAVING THAT SHALLOW ROOF PITCH. SO THE ROOFS ARE VERY INTENSIONALLY DESIGN TO BE LIKE THAT. BUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, BEN WILLIS CAN --
02:27:56.690: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT ANSWER. THAT JUST CLARIFIES WHAT WAS FOSED ON. SO THANKS. MY COLLEAGUES MAY VERY WELL HAVE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS ON THAT. AND THEN IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING TWO IMPORTANT ITEMS. THE FIRST IS THE 99 YEAR AFFORDABILITY COVENANT AND THE SECOND IS THE 400-KOWATTSF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION. WHERE -- WHERE WOULD I FIND THOSE GUARANTEES?
02:28:32.893: >> I WILL ONLY GIVE A PARTIAL ANSWER. REGARDING THE KILOWATT HOURS, IT WOULD BE SUPER DIFFICULT FOR THE CITY TO ENFORCE THAT AND MEASURE IT AND MONITOR THAT. SO THE SPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS ARE RELYING ON THE LIVING BUILDING CHALLENGE AND MEETING OF THOSE STANDARDS WITH WRAP IN THOSE. HOWEVER, IF -- I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW -- HOW THE CITY CAN COME UP WITH A WAY TO KEEP TABS ON THAT AND ENFORCE THAT. WE'RE OPEN TO LISTENING BUT GIVEN THE RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW, WE ARE RELYING ON ADHERENCE TO THE LIVING AND BILLING CHALLENGE TO CAPTURE THAT FOR US.
02:29:22.309: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND SO THEY HAVE A THIRD-PARTY THEYEE THE 400 KILOWATTE THAT PROMISE?
02:29:33.854: >> THAT IS OUR ASSUMPTION, YES.
02:29:35.255: >> SO IN OUR PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTY, WE HAVE AGREED TO INSTALL 400KW AND THESE ARE FUNKY TERMS, BUT 400KW IS ACTUALLY INSTALLED SOLAR, SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING THAT AMOUNT OF SOLAR AS A MEN M STANDARD. SO THAT'S A MEASURABLE -- THAT'S A MEASURABLE THING. SO -- AND, AGAIN THAT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW -- THAT'S WHAT WE PLEDGE AS A MINIMUM. THAT'S MEASURABLE. WITH THE LIVING BUILDING CHALLENGE AND THE LIVING COMMUNITY CHALLENGE, THAT'S A PERFORMANCE-BASED STANDARD THAT TAKES YEAR. WE HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED THE PROJECT, AND SO THAT ALO IS MASSIVE COMMITMENT. WE HAVE ALREADY SATISFIED THAT CRITERIA. AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS BEING DESIGNED THAT WAY, BUT THE MEASURABLE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT AND THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS JUST -- IT'S RELIES ON THE SUN AND THE CLOUDS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THE AMOUNT THAT WE INSTALL IS A MEASURABLE THIND THAT'S 400KW IS THE MINIMUM THAT WE HAVE IN OUR PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE CITY CAN HANG THEIR HAT ON WITH CONFIDENCE FROM DAY ONE.
02:30:42.656: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO YOU HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY THAT GUARANTEES A MINIMUM?
02:30:49.429: >> YEP.
02:30:49.696: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN MR. LENART AND MS. DILEO, CAN WE D SOM DOCUMENTATI OF THATMAYBE I A MEMO OR STAFF REPORT, JUST TO SAY, YOU KNOW, THE COUNTY WILL BE THE ENFORCING PARTY?
02:31:02.075: >> YEP, I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN NOTE OF THAT. I THINK .>> Councilmember AckerI THINK THAT WILL GIVE SOME REASSURANCE. DOOR I WANT TO CLARIFY. WE HAVE BEEN SORT OF CAREFUL TO NOT -- THEY HAVE MADE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS TO THE COUNTY AS PART OF THEIRURCHE AGREEMENT MY UNDERSTANDING. WE ARE NOT PARTY TO THAT, SO AS THOSE THINGS COULD CHANGE, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR, WHEN WE ARE SETTING THOSE THRESHOLDS, WE ARE SORT OF ADDING A PARALLEL REQUIREMENT TO THAT AND I WOULD SPECIFICALLY ASK IN THAT REGARD, WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THIS DISCUSSION WITH ANOTHER PROJECT, IS THE INTENTION THAT THAT HAS TO BE REALIZED A UNIT ONER DOES THAT HAVE TO BE REALIZED AT UNIT 99, WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT, ARE YOU INTERESTED IN US GOING IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE CLARITY OF THAT LANGUAGE?
02:31:52.892: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WELL, THIS PROJECT WOULD ONLY -- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. MY ASSUMPTION IS THIS PROJECT WILL ONLY BE PHASED NORTHND SOUTH, B LE SOUTH ITSELF WON'T BE PHASED CONSTRUCTION.
02:32:05.772: >> Planning Manager:  YES, BUT NATURE OF A -- IT'S NOT CURRENTLY PROPOSED TO BE PHASED. I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF THIS DOESN'T END UP BEING PHASED, BECAUSE THE NATURE OF PROJECTS LIKE THIS IS THAT THEY WILL ULTIMATELY CONSTRUCT, FINISH A UNIT AND THEY WILL WANT TO REALIZE THE SALE OR OCCUPANCY OF THAT UNIT PERHAPS BEFORE THEY FINISH OTHER UNITS. YOU ARE CORRECT, IT'S NOT BEING PROPOSED TO BE PHASED. I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF IT DOESN'T END UP BEING PHASED, AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE -- TO CLARIFY. I PRESUME OUR INTENTION IS WE WENT TO GET TO A 400 KILOWATT HOUR GOAL AND I'M PRESUMING THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY THAT TH CAN INCREMENTALLY GET THERE AS THEY ARE RELYING ON ROOFTOPS AND THE LIKE.
02:32:48.948: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH. THAT MAKES SENSE. IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO SCOPE THAT LANGUAGE AND SOME KIND OF -- YEAH.
02:32:58.158: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK THAT MAKES GOOD SENSE. THAT'S THE SAME CONVERSATION THAT WE WERE HAVING ABOUT VALHALLA TWO WEEKS AGO, RIGHT? THAT MAKES GOOD SENSE TO ME. I APOLOGIZE IF YOU MENTIONED BUT THE 99 YEAR AFFORDABILITY COVENANT, WHERE WOULD WE FIND THAT?
02:33:13.640: >> I THINK THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO IN THE AFFORDABLE -- AN AFFORDABILITY AGREEMENT. YOU ARE CORRECT, IT IS NOT IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW.
02:33:24.584: >> Planning Manager:  OUR UDC REQUIRES THEM TO BE PERPETU UNS AND SO THAT WILL BE PART OF THE METHOD BY WHICH WE ENFORCE IT.
02:33:33.626: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO THE UDC REQUIRES THAT A PUD --
02:33:36.696: >> TO HAVE AFFORDABLE UNITS. IT DOESN'T SET A TIME FRAME. 99 YEARS BECOMES THE DE FACTO KIND OF WAY TO MEMORIALIZE THAT. PUT IT COULD BE LONGER, BUT IT -- TO BE CLEAR, WE ARE NOT PROPING ANYTHING SHORTER OF TERM. IT IS INTENDED TO BE PERMANENT, AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.
02:33:55.949: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ALL RIGHT, COMMISSIONER SAUVE, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL JUMPS OFF THIS?
02:34:01.454: >> Commissioner Sauve: JUST ATTACHMENT B, PAGE 2 SHOWS AFFORDABLE HOUSING 99 YEARS AND THE MINIMUM 400-KILOWATTS YOU REFERENCED. SO THAT'S THE PUD DEVELOPNT.
02:34:13.833: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OH. AND IS -- I GUESS WHERE DOES THE DEVELOPMENT -- IS THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM A CONTRACT THAT WE EXECUTE WITH --
02:34:28.681: >> IT IS NOT. IT IS BACKGROUND AND SUPPORTING MATERIALS TO HELP YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND TO HELP YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION. IT'S EXPLAINING WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED AND WHAT IS GOING ON BUT THE -- THE REGULATIONS ARE THE -- THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, AND THEN DETAILS ON EXECUTION ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.
02:34:53.940: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO I GUESS THE 99 YEAR AFFORDABILITY COVENANT BAKED INTO THE ZONING, THEY APPLY FOR A PUD, AND THEY ARE REZONED AS A PUD AND IT'S THERE BY DEFAULT. I GET THAT. COOL. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO WORK ON SOME LANGUAGE AROUND THE 400-KILOWATT HOURS, AND THE HOUSING IS TAKEN CARE OF BY ITS NATURE?
02:35:21.835: >> Planning Manager:  AND I'M INTERPRETING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULARS MORE SPECIFICALLY THAN JUST THROUGH THE LIVINGS COMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
02:35:29.242: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK THAT'S WISE. IF THAT BECOMES OVERLY COMPLICATED -- COMPLICATED AND RESTRICTIVE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'TLLOW THE DEVELOPER T ACTUALLY BUILD, THEN -- I MEAN, MR. LENART, TO YOUR POINT, AS THEY CONSTRUCT MORE, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO REALIZE MORE ON THE ROOFTOPS AND --
02:35:52.499: >> Planning Manager:  NO, NO, I JUST -- ABSOLUTELY. THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING, BUT I -- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY, YOUR COMFORT- OR THE COMMISCOMMISSION'S COMFORT IT -T INCORPORATES A LOT OF OTHER SUSTAINABILITY ASPECTS AS WELL. CURRENTLY THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGS ARE PART OF THIS PROJECT TO MEET. THAT THEY MIGHT DO THAT THROUGH THE PROVISION OF 400 KILOWATTS. WE COULD ALSO SAY IN ADDITION TO THAT OR AOMPONENT OF THAT OR INDEPENDENT OF THAT, WE EXPECT A MINIMUM OF X NUMBER OF KILOWATT HOURS OF SQUARE FOOT OF HOUSING TO BE REALIZED THROUGH DEVELOPMENT.
02:36:32.572: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK TO MR. GROCOFF POINT THAT THE ACCDITION WILTAKE TIME, AND ARE WE HOLDING A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY UNTIL THIS THIRD PARTY -- FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL, YOU KNOW, ISSUES THAT ACCREDITATION? THAT -- SO I -- I DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE VALHALLA TO DO THAT SCALING.
02:37:02.268: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE.
02:37:06.172: >> Couilmb Aern: AWESOME. THANK YOU MR. LENART. AND THEN OUR LONE BRAVE CALLER ASKED ABOUT A TRAFFIC STUDY AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THAT ON THE FRONT END. IS SOMEONE PREPARED, DEVELOPER OR STAFF TO SPEAK TO TRAFFIC IMPACT?
02:37:23.022: >> I AM NOT. I MEAN, I'M HAPPY TO WING IT, BUT I DON'T HAVE TO. OUR TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER CYNTHIA REDDINGER IS ON THIS CALL, MEETING.
02:37:31.898: >> Councilmember Ackerman: HI, MS. REDDINGER.
02:37:38.905: >> HELLO [ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ]
02:37:43.710: >> THERE HAS BEEN A TRAFFIC STUDY DONE. IT'S BEEN REVIEWED BY THE CITY TRAFFIC ENGINEERS WHO DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WORTHY OF -- OR WOULD DID NOT FIND FAULT WITH IT. NOW CYNTHIA CAN PROVIDE ANY DETAILS OR GENERAL OVERVIEW AS YOU LIKE.
02:38:00.026: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:38:01.260: >> I CAN PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS THAT WAS SUBMITTED. THIS LOCATION, THEY DID PREPARE THEIR -- THEIR TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS AND THEY DID HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONE ROUND OF REVISIONS BEFORE WE ACCEPTED IT. JUST A LITE INFORMATION. THEY ARE PROSING A MIX OF USES, AND THE TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS, YOU WILL FIND IT IN THE ZONING. SO IT'S -- IT'S NOT ACTUALLY LOCATED WITH -- WITH THE SITE PLANS AS REFERENCED BY THE SITE PLANS. BUT IT'S IN THE ZONING, BECAUSE IT IS FOR THE REZONING AND THE PUD. AND THE TRANSPORTATION STUDY, THEY HAVE BROKEN OUT WHICH TRIPS ARE BEING GENERATED BY EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL SITE PLANS SO YOU CAN GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT, AND IN THIS LOCATION, WE DID HAVE THE ENGINEER WHO WAS PREPARING THE STUDY UTILIZE TRIP REDUCTIONS FOR MULTIDALITY BECAUSE IN THIS LOCATION, WE DO ANTICIPATE HAVING MULTIDALITY, AS COMPARED TO THE VALHALLA PROJECT, WHICH YOU WERE RECENTLY LOOKING AT, WHERE WE DID NOT USE THOSE TRIP REDUCTIONS. SO WE ELECTR HAVE TRIP REDUCTIOR WALKING AND BIKING AND TRANSIT AS WL.
02:39:39.726: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO PLEASE GO AHEAD.
02:39:41.828: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, THE -- THE PROPOSED NEW INTERSECTIONS OF THE PRIVATE DRIVEWAYS WITH THE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE ON PLATT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE ANY -- ANY OPERATIONAL CONCERNS. THE NEARBY INTERSECTIONS WHICH ARE ALREADY OVER CAPACITY DURING PEAK PERIODS, YOU KNOW, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE OVER CAPACITY, BUT THIS DEVELOPMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE AN OVERLY LARGE IMPACT ON THOSE LOCATIONS OR REALLY TO CHANGE FUNCTIONALITY MUCH AT ALL.
02:40:18.598: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN I TRY READING THAT BACK TO YOU AND YOU LET ME KNOW HOW DID. THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH, YOU KNOW, THERE WILL BE SOME LEVEL OF CAR TRAFFIC, NOT SO MUCH THAT IT RAISES RED FLAGS BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS PROJECT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF FOLKS BIKING AND WALKING AND USING TRANSIT GIVEN ITS LOCATION ON MULTIPLE BUSLINES GIV ITSROXIMITY TO PARKS AND RETAIL AND GIVEN ITS BIKE ACCESS ALONG WASHTENAW TOWARDS ONTOWN. AS SUCH, YOU KNOW, -- DOWNTOWN. AS SUCH, YOU KNOW, IF I'M A NEARBY NEIGHBOR, I SHOULDN'T WORRIED ABOUT MYRIVEWAY. THE ISSUES ON WASHTENAW AND PLATT ARE NOT GOING TO BE EXER BAITED.
02:41:15.755: >> THAT'S ACCURATE.
02:41:16.756: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU AND THE LAST WAS THE ERROR OF THE SETBACK, FROM THE 30 FEET TO THE 50 FEET AND I MEAN, IF IT'S JUST A LITTLE I AMENDMENT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE JUST KNOCK THAT UTILITY NOW.
02:41:34.207: >> I THINK IT'S JUST A CLERICAL ERROR. HEATH, DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS IT?
02:41:43.082: >> AYE, I CAN QUICKLY ADDRESS THAT. WE -- WHEN WE SUBMITTED OUR PUD REGULATIONS, WE HAD PROPOSED A 30-FOOT SETBACK ON THE SOUTH. THAT WOULD GET US OUTSIDE OF BOTH A -- A WATER MAIN EASEMENT THAT EXISTS AND ALSO GET US OUTSIDE OF THE 2500 LANDSCAPE BUFFER. 50-FOOT WAS -- ASATT SAID WOULD BE ENCROACHING FURTHER THAN WHAT WE HAD PNNED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT.
02:42:18.718: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO IT READS 50 NOW AND YOU WANT IT --
02:42:24.090: >> [ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ]
02:42:25.625: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO IN THE PUD SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, THAT'S PAGE 3, ITEM 4C, 2A? I WOULD MAKE A MOTION TO AMENDMENT IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS IN E4C, TO A CHANGE OF 50 FEET TO 30 FEET.
02:42:52.084: >> Chair Mills: IT'S MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. SECONDED BY CMISSIONER SAE. DISCUSSION ON THE MOTION TO AMEND? MY ONLY QUESTION IS, TO STAFF, IS THAT KIND OF YOUR READING TOO IN LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE STATE PLAN THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE THERE?
02:43:17.343: >> YEAH.
02:43:20.012: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION -- THE AMENDMENT AS PROPOSED PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ANYONE OPPOSED? I DON'T SEE ANYONE. AL RHT SO NOW WE HAVN AMENDED MOTION. YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR, MR. ACKERMAN.
02:43:45.204: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M AN ENTHUSIASTIC YES AND I'M EXCITED TO HEAR OTHER COLLEAGUE'S THOUGHTS.
02:44:00.419: >> Commissioner ods: I HAVE COUPLEF QUESTIO ABOUT THE TRAFFIC AND MS. REDINGER. NOW IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THERE'S A SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET FROM THIS DEVELOPMENT; IS THAT CORRECT?
02:44:08.961: >> YES, THAT'S CORRECT. SUMMERS KNOLL.
02:44:13.532: >> Commissioner Woods: MM-HMM. AND I THINK THE LAUGH TIME THAT WE LOOKED AT THIS ITEM, THAT THE SCHOOL WAS IN FAVOR OF IT, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, BUT THE DEVELOPER COULD TELL US ABOUT THAT. HOW DOES THIS IMPACT CHILDREN FROM THE DEVELOPMENT ARE GOING TO GO TO THE -- TO THE SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET, FOR EXAMPLE, AND I KNOW -- I THINK IT'S A PRIVATE SCHOOL OR SOMETHING, BUT AT ANY RATE, HOW WOULD THEY ARE THERE ANY PLANNED CROSSWALKS OR ANYTHING BETWEEN THE SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET OR WOULD THEY GO DOWN TO E CORNER AT WHAT IS THAT PLATT AND HURON? NO, PLATT AND HURON RIVER DRIVE AT THAT POINT AND THEN COME BACK UP OR DID THAT COME UP?
02:45:20.266: >> THERE IS A SCHOOL AND THERE'S A SCHOOL SPEED ZONE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AS PART OF THE TRANSPORTATION IMPACT SDY, THEY DID TAKE A LOOK AT THAT CROSSWALK AND IF THE ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC WOULD CHANGE WHERE IT LIES WITHIN THE CRCROSSWALK DESIGN GUIDE LINES D IT WAS NOT FOUND THAT THIS WOULD NEED TO BE ANY CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY AS PART OF OUR COMPLETE STREETS POLICY FOR THE CITY, BOTH OF THE NEW INRSECTIONS WITH THE PRIVATE APPROVES ON PLATT WILL HAVE NON-MOTORIZED ACCESS. THEY WILL HAVE CROSSWALKS. THEY WILL BE INSTALLED WITH DESIGNS ACCORDING TO OUR DESIGN GUIDELINES AND CONSISTENT WITH THE CORRIDOR AND POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER AS WELL.
02:46:24.263: >> Commissioner Woods: AND I HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION, THAT WAS BACK TO THE INFORMATION FROM YOU, MS. DELEO. THERE WAS A SLIDE THAT INDICATED THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IT WAS LKIN ABOUT THE NORTH SID HAVING 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT WASN'T HAPPENING AND THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN, ONE OF WHICH WAS A RETURN, I THINK, OF FUND BACK TO THE FELLER. COULD YOU JUST PUT UP THAT SLIDE FOR A SECOND? I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING. UP, I CAN EXPLAIN MOUNTAING THAT NATIONAL FOR THOSE IDEAS. ONE IS, AGAIN, THESE ARE THEY ARE TIMING SCENARIOS. ONE IS THE SOUTH SIDE WOULD CREATE ITS OWN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS INDEPENDENT OF THE NORTH AND IF THEY DID 15%, THEY WOULD BE COMPLIANT. BY THE TIME THE SOUTH MARKET RATE HOUSING UNITS ARE READY FOR OCCUPANCY, NORTH AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, THEN THEY -- NORTH UNITS WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE ENTIRE SITE AND THAT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS, OR WE'RE LOOKING AT TORT OF IN BETWEEN OPTIONS IF YOU WILL. ONE MIGHT BE A PAYMENT IN LIEU WHICH IS OPTION PROVIDED UNDER THE PUD, WHERE THEY WOULD -- THE -- ON THE MARKET RATE SIDE, THEY WOULD BE PAYING CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THESE CITIES AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND AT A RATE CONSISTENT WITH OUR FORMULA, WHERE THEY ARE MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE WITH 15% OF HOWEVER MANY DWELLING UNITS ARE ESSTILY COMING ONLINE, AND -- AND IF AFTER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, THOSE NORTH UNITS HAVE NOW BEEN FULLY REALIZED, THOSE MONIES WOULD BE RETURNED BECAUSE THE REQUIREMENT WILL HAVE BEEN MET. OTHERWISE, IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, THOSE FUNDS WOULD MEET THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS VIA A PAYMENT IN OVIDINGHE UNITS.N INSTEAD OF AND THEN THE LAST OPTION WE ARE EXPLORING AND I THINK THIS ONE HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR OTHER DOCUMENTS IS TWO -- FOR THE CITY TO FRANKLY ACCEPT SOME MINIMAL LEVEL OF RISK, THAT IS THAT THE UNITS, THE AFFORDABLE UNITS ON NORTH SIDE ARE AT SOME STAGE OF PROGRESS, BUT NOT COMPLETE, WHERE WE ARE COMFORTABLE ASSUMING THAT THEY ARE AT A PROGRESS STATE WHERE WE HAVE, I GUESS COMFORT THAT THEY WILL BE ULTIMATELY REALIZED. SO THAT WAS THE -- THE RETURN OF M.P.MONEY WOULD BE AN ESCROW THE WILL DO PAYMENT IN LIEU UNTIL THE THOSE ON NORTH SIDE ARE DONE AND THEN THAT'S NO LONGER REQUIRED.
02:49:16.368: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. AND SO THE PAYMENT IN LIEU. I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT FOR OTHER TIMES WHEN IT COMES UP WITH THE DEVELOPER HAS DECIDED THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD THE AFFORDABLE -- THEY DECLINE TO DO IT. SO THAT WOULD BE PMENT IN LIEU AND IT WOULD INCLUDE INTEREST OR WHATEVER THE CITY WAS ACCUMULATING FOR WHATEVER FUNDING AT THE TIME.
02:49:39.692: >> Planning Manager:  NO, TYPICALLY WITH AN ESCROW PAYMENT, IT DOESN'T ACCUMULATE INTEREST, IT WOULD BE A FLAT REFUND OF THE SAME AMOUNT IF THATCENARIO WERE TO OCCUR.
02:49:54.039: >> Commissioner Woods: HMM. OKAY. AND CAN YOU REMIND ME --
02:50:01.013: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS, I WOULD MENTION NO INTEREST TYP TYPICALY ACCRUES WHEN IT'S IN INTEREST, BUT THE PAYMENT IN LIEU CAN BE BY COUNCIL AND THAT' IN LIEU OF INTEREST. THE PAYMENT IN LIEU AMOUNT IS NOT NECESSARILY STAT. IT CAN RISE OR FALL WITH MARKET CONDITIONS. SO WHAT -- IF THEY WERE TO BUILD IT IN 2021, AND CHOSE THE PAYMENT IN LIEU OPTION, IT MIGHT BE ONE PRICE OR IF THEY BUILD IT IN 2025, IT MAY BE A DIFRENT PAYMENT IN LIEU AMOUNT.
02:50:38.250: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. AND SO -- AND WOULD KEEPS TRACK OF THAT? CITY COUNCIL OR THE --
02:50:45.491: >> THE -- THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT -- THE PLANNING OFFICE BUT AS WELL AS THE COUNTY'S OFFICE OF -- I'M GOING TO GET IT WRONG. THE COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMT, ANDHEY HAVE HELP ADMINISTER THESE TYPES OF THINGS AND SO IT'S -- IT'S BASICALLY ON FILE. THE AMOUNT IS ON FILE, UNTIL IT IS CHANGED. AND THE COUNTY OFFICE SPEAR HEADS THE NEED FOR INCREASING THE AMOUNT BASED ON MARK MARKET CONDITIO.
02:51:17.890: >> Cmissioner Woods: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THAT HELPS.
02:51:20.426: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND THERE'S ANNUAL EMAIL ASKING ABOUT IT.
02:51:26.432: >> WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT YEAR?
02:51:28.167: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I GUESS I WILL HAVE TO START SENDING THE EMAIL.
02:51:30.803: >> THANK YOU.
02:51:43.749: >> Chair Mills: ANYTHING ELSE, COMMISSIONER WOODS? COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:51:47.619: >> Commissioner Sauve: THEY HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON. SOUTH SIDE AND THEN THEY BUILT THE NORTH, LIKE, CAN YOU JUST FLIP WHERE THE AFFORDABLE UNITS GO IN THE EXTENDED AGREEMENT AND SAY ASSIGN THEM TO DIFFERENT UNITS?
02:52:01.900: >> I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE KIND OF TRYING TO DO BUT BY UNIT BY UNIT, BUILDING BY BUILDING. WE ARE SAYING THAT IF THE NORTH -- IF AVALON BUILDS THEIR -- OR WHEN THEY BUILD THEIR 50 UNITS, THOSE 50 ARE -- THAT'S BASICALLY - IT'S ALMOST 30% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNITS. AND SO THEIR 50 ALONE MEANSHAT THE WHOLE PROJECT HAS AT LEAST 15% AFFORDABLE. SO IF THEY GO FIRST, EVERYONE IS COVERED. IF THRIVE GOES FIRST -- IF THRIVE GOES FIRST, WITHOUT THESE PROVISIONS, THEN NO AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE PROVIDED. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S OPTIONS ON THE TABLE.
02:52:50.849: >> Commissioner Sauve: RIGHT. SO MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE OPTION THAT THEY MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE SOUTH SITE.
02:52:59.157: >> OKAY.
02:52:59.558: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THEN THEY BUILD ON THE NORTH SIDE AND THE NORTH SIDE IS AFFORDABLE, CAN YOU THEN REDACT THE SOUTH SIDE AFFORDABLE OR ONC THEY COME DESIGNATED AFFORDABLE FOR 99 YEARS, CAN YOU NOT SHUFFLE THE UNITS AWAY? YOU KNOW?
02:53:14.873: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, BUT I THINK YOU COULD ADJUST THOSE, AS LONG AS YOU ARE MEETING THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
02:53:23.849: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
02:53:24.449: >> Planning Manager:  SO BY SCENARIO, IF SAY FOR SOME REON, NORTHITE DIDN' GET DEVELOPED FOR 20 YEARS, BUT THE SOUTH SITE WAS DEVELOPED WITHIN THREE YEARS, UNDER THAT SCENARIO, ONE OF THOSE PROVISIONS WILL HAVE TO APPLY. THE PAYMENT IN LIEU, IN WHICH NO PAYMENT  IS REAZED. -- IN THE EVENT THAT THEY DESIGNATED UNITS AND THEN 20 YEARS FROM THEN, THE NORTH GETS BUILT AND 50 UNITS ARE BUILT THERE AND THEY SAY, HEY, CAN WE CONVERT THESE 15% TO MARKET RATE, THE ANSWER WOULD BE, YES, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE COMPLIANT WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. THEY ARE MEETING THE MINIMUM VIA THE NORTH UNITS.
02:54:12.731: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE 8 # YEARS LEFT?
02:54:15.567: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S PERPETUAL. IT SHOULD BE PERPETUAL.
02:54:21.807: >> Commissioner Sauve: I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF THEY ARE DOING THIS EVOLVING -- THIS REVOLVING DOOR TO GET TO, IS IT LOCKING IT IN OR NOT. I THINK THE INTENT IS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY. AND I RAISE IT JUST IN CASE, YOU KNOW, LEGALLY CROSS-CHECK IT AS WE MOVE ALONG.
02:54:38.457: >> Planning Manager:  YES, AS A REMINDER, THOUGH, WITH, YOU KNOW, RENTAL AFFORDABLE UNITS IS MUCH EASIER THAN OWNERSHIP AFFORDABLE UNITS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE BUT WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THESE TWO SITES AND THE MIX OF OWNERSHIP MODELS BEING CONSER, OERSHIP MODELS CAN BE MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. SO I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD FOR FRANKLY FOR EASE OF FINANCING IS THAT THE SITE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE DEVELOPED AND REALIZED AND A VERY SIMILAR WAY TO WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED FOR SOME OF THOSE FINANCIAL REASONS.
02:55:13.158: >> Commissioner Sauve: YEP. I GOT IT. THAT WAS MY ONLY OTHER CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU.
02:55:22.434: >> Chair Mills: OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM PLANNING COMMISSIONERS? COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:55:29.608: >> Commissioner Abrons:  MAYBE MR. LENART OR MS. DELEO COULD JUST REMIND ME WHAT THINGS GO WITH THE REZONING AND WHAT SO SUPPLEMENL REGULATIONS ARE PART OF THE PUD?
02:55:46.758: >> SO, THE -- IF IT HELPS, I DON'T KNOW. SO WE ARE REZONING IT TO PUD. I SUPPOSE YOU CAN ALSO THINK OF IT AS WE ARE REZONING IT TO VERIDIAN. AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS ARE THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE FOR THIS PARTICULAR SITE. AND SO THEY RUN -- AND SO THE PUD ON THE ZONING MAP AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS RUN WITH THE LAND. AND THAT WOULD BE -- AND IF APPROVED, THAT'S THE ZONING DESIGNATION AND THOSE ARE THE RULES THAT YOU NEED TOBIDE BY, AND IN THAT CASE, THRIVE COULD WALK AWAY, AVALON COULD WALK AWAY, AND ANY OTHER DEVELOPER COULD COME IN, BUT THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE ADOPTED SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. THEN, RIGHT ON THE -- IN THE SAME MEETING, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS COULD BE DONE YEARS APART, B IN THE SAME MEETING, WE ARE ALSO -- THRE HAS PROPOSED A SITE PLAN AND AVALON HAS PROPOSED A SITE PLAN AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE FOR THESE SITE PLANS IS WE ARE NOT JUDGING THEM AGAINST THE -- FOR EXAMPLE, THE R4B AREA HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT, WE ARE JUDGING THEM AGAINST THE VERIDIAN SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT SAY 45 ETN HEIGHT, 30-FOOT SIDE SET BACK AND 10-FOOT SETBACK AND SO THE SITE PLANS ARE THE ENTITLEMENTS TO THE DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP. THEY HAVE THREE YEARS FOR APPROVAL. IF THREE YEARS GO BY, THEIR SITE PLANS EXPIRE, AND THEY HAVE TO COME BACK, BUT THE ZONING DESIGNATION AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS RUN WITH THE LAND.
02:57:33.198: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. THAT HELPS. SO, LIKE, IF THRIVE AND AVALON DECIDED NOT TO PURSUE THIS PROJECT OR FOR EXAMPLE, THESE SITE PLANS WERE NOT APPROVED BUT THE PUD ZONING WAS APPROVED, THERE WOULD STILL BE A NORTH DISTRICT AND A SOUTH DTRICT, DHE NORTH DISTRICT WOULD HAVE ALL THE AFFORDABLE -- LE, ALL OF THAT STUFF GOES WITH THE ZONING?
02:57:58.557: >> YES. YES. THE REQUIREMENT THAT -- SO IF YOU NOTICE, THE PUD SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, THEY DON'T SAY THRIVE OR AVALON. FOR ANY DEVELOPER, THE NEXT ONE, THEY CAN BUY THE NORTH COMPONENT NORTH COMPONENT REGULATIONS, THE WHICH SAYS IT -- IT ALL HAS TO BE TWO STORIES AND 10-FOOT SETBACK AND ALL -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS IT HAS TO BE ALL AFFORDABLE. AND THEN THE SAME THING FOR THE SOUTH COMPONENT. SOMEONE ELSE COULD COME IN GUT BUTTHEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH THESE SUPPLEMENTAL REGATIO. THEY HE TO HAVE THE HOUSING TIME AND THEY HAVE TO REGISTER THE LIVING BUILDING CHALLENGE.
02:58:43.368: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. THAT HELPS. THANKS. THAT'S MY ONLY QUESTION FOR NOW. THANK YOU.
02:58:52.611: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:58:54.446: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I HAVE KIND OF A L. I DOT THINK ANY OF THEM ARE HUGE QUESTIONS, BUT IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT. MY VERY FIRST PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING, ALONG WITH COMMISSIONER ABRONS WAS JUST OVER A YEAR AGO AND IT'S THE MEETING WHERE YOU BROUGHT US THIS PROJECT, AND I WAS SO EXCITED THAT I HAVE BEEN WONDERING FOR A YEAR WHEN IT WAS COMING BACK. SO I THRLED. I WILL STAY ON THE AORDABLE HOUSING PIECE FOR A MINUTE. THERE'S SOME THINGS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR ON. SO OF THE IF I, I THINK THE MATH WAS WRONG WHEN IT WAS IN THE PRESENTATION. 30 OF THEM ARE SUPPORTIVE MORE OR LESS 30%. AND 10 ARE FOR OZONE. AND THEN YOU SAID WERE FOR UNDER 60% BUT YOU MEANT 10 WERE FOR UNDER 60%. BECAUSE 30 PLUS 10 PLUS 20 IS 60.
02:59:45.297: >> I'M GOING TO DEFER TO WENDY CARTE-SAXON. THE 30 THAT ARIVE AND 10 OR OZONE. 30 ARE SUPPORTIVE, INCLUDING --
02:59:54.839: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: AH! THANK YOU.
02:59:57.275: >> AND SHE'S NODDING.
02:59:59.144: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: GOT IT. OKAY. SEE, EASY QUESTION. THEN I WAS TRYING TO DO MATH. SO IF THE NORTH IS NOT REALIZED, AND WE HAVE THESE OPTIONS FOR, YOU KNOW, WHAT TO DO WITH THE PIECES ON THE SOUTH, IS IT -- IS THE 15% -- THE 15% OF THE SOUTH, WHICH IS 99, OR IS IT 15% OF THE TOTAL WHICH IS 149 IN.
03:00:25.637: >> Planning Manager:  15% OF THE TOTAL.
03:00:29.140: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: SO IF THE NORTH IS NOT REALIZED, THE SOUTH HAS TO COME UP WITH 23 UNITS? OR PAYMENT IN LIEU OR WHATEVER WE --
03:00:39.684: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S A 15% NUMBER. IT'S NOT A NUMBER. SO AS THEIR NUMBERS INCREASE, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVID 15%. IF THAT IS REALIZED, AND THEN 50 UNITS COME LATER, ON THE NORTH SITE, THAT IS ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE 50% OF THE UNITS. NO, THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ALL AFFORDABLE.
03:01:00.338: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IT'S 15% OF WHAT IS BUILT. SO ON THE SOUTH, SO IT'S NOT 15% OF THE TOTALS. IT'S 15% OF THE TOTAL BUILDS? OKAY. GOT IT. IS THERE A SCENARIO WHERE NOT ALL 50 ARE BUILT, THEN, LIKE, IS THERE ANY SORT OF -- WELL, IS THERE A SCENARIO WHERE NOT ALL 50 WILL  BUILT AND IS THERE AN ALL OR NOTHING AND MAYBE THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THE PETITIONER.
03:01:36.608: >> WE ARE LOOKING TO PUT IN OUR FUNDING APPLICATION FOR ALL 50, THAT THEY WOULD ALL COME TOGETHER.
03:01:40.678: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. THEN I THINK MY QUESTION IS MOOT.
03:01:45.483: >> THE PUD SUPPLEMENTAL. THEY DON'T HAVE A MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS. THE MAXIMUM WILL BE 16 WELLING UNITS PER ACRE. THEY DON'T HAVE A MINIMUM, BUT WE DO SAY ALL OF WHATEVER YOU DO AENVIRONMENT CHOO. SO THERE IS TECHNICALLY A DIFFERENT BETWEEN WHAT IS REQUIRED AND AWHAT AVALON IS GOING TO DO. I THINK IN THIS CASE, THEIR FUNDING QUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO DICTATE OVER.
03:02:15.880: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE NUMBER OF BEDROOMS OR DO WE LEAVE THAT UP
03:02:32.097: >> W CHOSE NO LEA IT. WE COULD -- WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT IN FURTHER RESTRICTIONS, PARAMETERS, REGULATIONS, BUT WE CHOSE TO HEAVE IT AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE TO GIVE THEM THE MOST FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE, IF THE COMMISSION DECIDES OTHERWISE, THEY CAN DISCUSS.
03:03:00.492: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I THINK ALL 50 IN NORTH IS AN ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT BECOMES AN ISSUE IF NORTH IS NOT REALIZED AND THEN I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET INTO A SITUATION WHERE ALL OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE THE MICROUNITS AND THEY ARE NOT HAVE TO ARESS THE AFFORDABLED WE HOUSING CONCERNS OF OUR COMMUNITY.
03:03:21.913: >> Planning Manager:  JUST TO BE CLEAR, IF THE SOUTH HAPPENED, THAT COULD OCCUR. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT IT HAS TO BE A CERTAIN BLEND. IT JUST IS A NUMBER OF UNITS. SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. AGAIN, I THINK -- I THINK THAT THAT SIR NA SCENARIO IS QUINLIK. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE SPECIFYING. WE ARE JUST SAYING 15% OF THE UNITS. YOUR QUESTION IS A GOOD ONE. THIS DOES HAPPEN IN OTHER PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE. THEY TEND TO BE SMALLER UNITS BECAUSE THAT HAS A SMALLER IMPACT TO THEM.
03:03:57.916: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: RIGHT. AND WHILE IHIN THIS CASE, YOU HAVE A PARTNER WHO IS REALLY COMMITTED TO A MIXED INCOME GLOBALLY, THEY ALSO HAVE SOME FINANCIAL REALITIES THAT MIGHT MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR US TO ADD THAT LAYER OF RESTRICTION.
03:04:15.733: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN OTHER'S THOUGHTS BUT I WILL MOVE ON FOR NOW. CHALLENGE.LIVING COMMUNITY YOU ARE RISTERED. THE SUPPLEMENTAL RIGHTS SAY THEY JUST NEED TO BE REGISTERED. I'M CURIOUS, WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR GETTING CERTIFIED? AND HOW IS -- HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT THAN JUST BEING REGISTERED?
03:04:36.854: >> YOU WILL HAVE TO ATTEND ONE OF MY TWO-HOUR WORKSHOPS.
03:04:40.825: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WOULD SORT OF LOVE TO. (LAUGHTER).
03:04:46.064: >> YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY RLLY COOL. SO RIGHT NOW, WE ARE WORKING ON WHAT IS CALLED THE LIVING COMMUNITY CHALLENGE COMPLIANT MASTER PLAN. AND WHAT'S COOL ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE BASICALLY PRESENT THIS -- THIS OVERARCHING VISION OF THIS IS WHAT WE COULD ACHIEVE. THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD ACHIEVE. AND THIS IS HE WLD GET THERE, CONCEPTUALLY, KIND OF LIKE WHAT I DID WITH THE NET ZERO DIAGRAMS THAT I SHOWED YOU TONIGHT. THIS IS SHOWING HOW WE WOULD GET THERE. AND WE WILL HAVE TO SHOW SOME OF THAT FOR THE MASTER PLAN TOO, IN MUCH GREATER DETAIL WITH ALL THE SPREADSHEETS AND THE NUMBERS. BASICAL Le, JUST SHOWING THAT, YES -- BASICALLY JUST SHOWING THAT, YES, THISS POSSIE. CE THAT HAPPENS, THEN WE GO INTO CONSTRUCTION PERIOD, AND THEN AFTER CONSTRUCTION, WE GO INTO THE OCCUPANCY PERIOD. AND TO BE CERTIFIED, IT'S WHEN EVERYTHING IS COMPLETE. YOU HAVE CHECKED OFF ALL THE BOXES. AND YOU HAVE OCCUPIED IT FOR 12 MONTHS OF PERFORMCE. AND THAT PERFORMANCE PERIOD IS WHAT SEPARATES THIS FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER STANDARD IN THE WORLD THIS IS NOT HOW MANY BIKE RACKS DO YOU HAVE? IT'S NOT EVEN HOW MUCH SOLAR YOU HAVE. THEY DON'T CARE. IT'S NOT A PRESCRIPTIVE THING. IT'S -- IT'S WHAT ARE YOU ACHIEVING IN TOTAL? AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECE HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT. AND THE STANDARDS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE. IT'S YOU HAVE TO HARVEST ALL OF YOUR ENERGY ON SITE, JUST LIKE A TREE DOES AND, YOU KNOW, SO THAT'S LOOSELY THE PROCESS. THERE'S ANOTHER HOUR AND 55 MINUTES WE COULD GO ON ABOUT THAT.
03:06:32.337: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: DAY.ILL SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER AND JUST O OTHER THING ABOUT THIS PAUSE WE HAVE GOTTEN INTO BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGS THAT HONESTLY, FOR THE COMMITTEE'S UNDERSTANDING, WE ALL KIND OF LEARNED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. AND IT'S REALLY A FUNCTION OF THIS FUNKY THING THAT WE HAD TO DO, BY SEPARATING THE PARCE, THE INITIAL PLAN FOR THE COMMUNITY WAS THAT WE WOULD BE ONE JOINED LEGAL PARCEL. LAWYERS AND FUNDERS AND INVESTORS ALL GOT INVOLVE AND ID SAID, NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TWO SEPARATE PARCELS. SO WE HAVE A CONVENTIONAL BARRIER. WE HAVE REALLY 33% OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AND NOT JUST AFFORDABLEOUSING UNITSUT PEOPLE HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS, SO THAT'S THE GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF NOT GETTING INTO THIS OH, YOU KNOW THIS IDEA WHERE, OH, WE ARE LETTING IT DEVELOPER GET AWAY WITH ZERO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL. UNDER THE ORIGINAL MAP  PLAN, WO THE WHOLE THING AND WE GIFT THE DEVELOPED LAND TO AVALON, AND WE RAISED OUR PURCHASE PRICE WITH THE COUNTY TO SUPPLEMENT THAT AND AVALON GETS THE LAND FOR FREE AND SO ON. WE COULD TALK FOR HOURS ABOUT THIS, BUT JUST UNDERSTAND, IT'S ONE OF THESE FUNKY STUPID UNINTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF DECADES AND DECADES OF REGULATION THINGS AND FINANCIAL THINGS AND FUNDING, ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE BARRIERS THAT WE'RE DISCOVERING AS WE PUT THIS OVER OR NOT EVEN DISCOVERING. SOMETIMES DELIBERATING PUSHING UP AGAINST THEM TO SHOW THAT THESE NEED TO BE CHANGED MOVING FORWARD. SO --
03:08:19.110: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: AND I LOVE YOUR VISION AND DEDICATION. I LOVE THIS PARTNERSHIP. I THINK THIS COULD BE REPLICATED ACSS THE COUNTRY. I WOULD LOVE TO CLONE YOU.
03:08:27.084: >> THANK YOU.
03:08:27.852: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. OKAY. JUST TO MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR ON THIS LIVING -- SORRY, JUST TO GO BACK QUICKLY TO THE LIVING COMMUNITIES. YOU ARE OCCUPIED FOR 12 MONTHS. THIS HE GET TO SEE -- THEY GET TO SEE HOW THE BUILDINGS ARE PEORMING. DO THEY HAV TO RECERTIFY AT ANY POINT IN TIME OR THEY EVALUATE AFTER A YEAR AND THEN YOU HAVE TO RECERTIFY?
03:08:57.014: >> AT THIS POINT IN THE PROGRAM, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO RECERTIFY.
03:09:03.020: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: AND JUST A FEW MORE THINGS. UNITS ON SOUTH SIDE, ARE FOR TH SALE ORENT?
03:09:08.759: >> THEY ARE PROFORMAD FOR SALE. BUT THEY COULD BE RENTALS BUT, YES.
03:09:14.665: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: TBD. OKAY. WHO IS MANAGING THE FARM STOCK? I KNOW YOU MENTIONED, IT'S MODELED AFTER ARGUS, IS THERE A THIRD PARTY COMING?
03:09:33.084: >> IT WILL BE. THAT PERSON IS NOT IDENTIFIED. WE ARE IN CONSTANT TALKS WITH KATHY AND BILL AT ARGUS, AND, YOU KNOW, I WILL TELL YOU, I'M -- I WILL PUSH TO HAVE SOME SORT OF PARTNERSHIP IN THAT. I WANT TO BE PART OF THAT. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO WILL BE MANAGING IT. IT DOESN'T HAVE A NAME, IS THE HONEY LOCUST FARM STOP. WE HAVEN'T REALLY STARTED WORKING ON THAT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO GET THROUGH CITY COUNCIL AND ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF.
03:10:04.649: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE ME BEING SELFISH.
03:10:08.052: >> THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS I LOVE.
03:10:10.621: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE, PRISE, GUYS. THE COMMUNITY CENTER, I ASSUME IS OPEN TO ALL RESIDENTS OF THE SITE. IT'S TECHNICALLY ON THE NORTH PIECE, BUT I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU MENTIONED -- SOMEBODY MENTIONED THERE'S A MEETING SPACE. I'M ASSUMING ANY RESIDENT AT VERIDIAN CAN ACCESS THE COMMUNITY CENTER?
03:10:30.308: >> YEAH, I MEAN, WE DO WITH THE SIZE OF I WE ARE PRIMARILY ANTICIPATING THAT WITHIN THE UNIT OR THE COMMUNITY CENTER IS PRIMARILY THE FOLKS ON THE NORTH, BUT BARBECUES, OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, BIGGER ACTIVITIES, CERTAINLY, AND, YOU KNOW, ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE, CERTAINLY WILL BE OPEN TO FOLKS. MORE BROADLY.
03:10:50.595: >> AND JUST A NEAT ADDITION, THE -- AGAIN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT, IT YOU SO H SEE HOW IT'S DESIGN. YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY THE PROPERTY BOUNDARY AND SO THE PLAYGROUND, WHICH IS TECHNICALLY AVALON'S FINKIFICTIONAL SIDE OF THE BOUNY AND WE ARE CALLING THESE COMMUNITY MOMENTS AND IT'S ALL ONE TIG CTIGUOU SPACE. SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A LEGAL FICTION UNDERNEATH IT.
03:11:23.194: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YOU CAN SEE THAT FROM THE RENDERING. THAT'S OBVIOUS TO ME. SPEAKING OF THE PLAY GROUND AND THE OPEN SPACE, IS THAT PRIVATE FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT? CORRECT? OR --
03:11:34.071: >> NOT NECESSARILY. NO. ALL OF THESE SPACES ARE DESIGNED TO BE OPEN, ANDRANTED ACCESS. WE KNOW PEOPLE WILL BE PASSING TO AND FROM THE PARK, AND ACTUALLY PART OF THE LIVING COMMUNITY CHALLENGES, ONE OF THE ASPECTS IS PLACE AND UNDER THAT, YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN WHAT IS CALLED THE THE RIGHTS TO NATURED YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC ACCESSES TO IT.
03:11:56.861: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: AWESOME!
03:11:58.529: >> NOT PRIVATIZING STUFF. (LAUGHTER).GROSSE POINTE.
03:12:03.868: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I LOVE IT. SO THEN I ASSUME -- I LOVE, OUGH, THAT IT IS PRIVATELY MANAGED PUBLIC SPACE, PUBLIC SPACE, LIKE YOU GUYS -- SOMEBODY WITHIN THIS AGREEMENT IS MAINTAINING THOSE SPACES?
03:12:15.713: >> THAT WOULD BE JUST CLASSIC HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, RIGHT?
03:12:19.283: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OH, I REMEMBER THAT FROM A YEAR AGO NOW. OKAY. AND I APPRECIATE, LIKE, COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING ALL THE PUN LICKC SUPPORT THIS PROJECT HAS GOTTEN. I WAS SURPRISED WE GOT A COUPLE OF LETTERS THAT WERE NOT AS THRILLED ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND A COUPLE OF THEM MENTIONED THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THIS PROJECT ON A SPARK PACE. PARK SPACE. THISES NOT PARK SPACE, IT'S COUNTY LAND THAT WAS A JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY. IT'S NOT A PARK. IT'S NOT PART OF COUNTY FARM PARK WHICH IS STAYING AS A PARK. IT'S A COMPLETELY SEPARATE PARCEL. I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE MENTIONED DON'T TAKE AWAY MY PARK SPACE OR SOMETHING TO THAT EECT. AND THAT IS ALL FROM ME FOR NOW. THANK YOU. I'M REALLY TRULY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT.
03:13:17.641: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
03:13:19.877: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I WILL KEEP IT VERY BRIEF SINCE MOST, ACTUALLY ALL OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERS. ACTUALLY, ALL BUT O. SO FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. I HAVE BEEN ON THE COMMISSION FOR OVER FIVE YEARS; IS THAT RIGHT, COMMISSIONER MILLS, OVER FIVE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN ON HERE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, MAYBE SIX, SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I CAN COUNT ON PROBABLY JUST ONE HAND HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE HAD AFFORDABLE HOUSINGEFOR US. ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS THAT IS OF THIS SIZE. YOU KNOW, WE KEEP CHIPPING AWAY LITTLE BY LITTLE BY LITTLE, BUT WE'RE FINALLY, LIKE THIS IS -- THIS IS HOW WE GET TO IT. SO I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT AVALON IS A PART OF THIS PROJECT. ONE OFHE QUESTIO THAT I'M OFTEN ASKED A ASKED ABOUT ANY PT THAT COMES BEFORE US. WHAT IS THE TIMELINE? AND SO IF ALL GOES WELL TODAY, AND YOU HAVE CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL, WHAT IS THE TIME LINE FOR BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH?
03:14:30.181: >> I CAN ANSWER FOR THE NORTH. SO WE HAVE APPLI FOR SE FUNDING AND AWARDED SOME. THE BIG PIECE OF FUNDING IS LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. THAT APPLICATION WE ARE ANTICIPATING BEING DUE DECEMBER 1st OF THIS YEAR. IF WE ARE AWARDED, IT WOULD BE MAYBE MARCH WE WOULD TELL US AND WE LOOK TO CLOSE THE LATTER PART OF 2021. WE BEGIN BUILDING AND THEN OCCUPANCY THE LATTER PART OF 2022 IS WHEN WE WOULD START SELLING.
03:15:03.047: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: AND HOW ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PROJECT?
03:15:05.249: >> EN WHY. ON THE VERIDIAN SIDE, THIS IS JOEY JONNA, WE ARE HOPING TO GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS BY OCTOBER. WE'LL FINISH OUR CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS AND APPLY FOR PERMIT. WE EXPECT SIX MONTHS FOR THAT AND THEN AT THAT POINT, WE ARE READY TO BREAK GROUND DEPENDING ON WEATHER CONDITIONS. SO THIS WINTER OR EARLY SPRING IS THE IDEAL SCENARIO FOR US.
03:15:30.374: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
03:15:35.980: >> Chair Mills: I'M LOOKING AROUND FOR HANDS. I HAVE A LIST AS I ALWAYS DO. BUT I WILL -- I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE. OKAY. I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH MY LIST. FIRST OFF, WITH THE PLATITUDES OF LIKE, THANKS THIS IS AMAZING! I ECHO ALL OF THE POSITIVE THINGS OTHERS SAID AND I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT ONE THING THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT, I KNOW MR. GROCOFF, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF SPLITTING IT INTO TWO FOR SE REASONS, I THINK THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TWO NEIGHBORING LANDOWNERS THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND INTEGRATING A DEVELOPMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR THIS COMING MULTIPLE POINTS OF ENTRY BETWEEN YOUR PROPERTIES, IS SOMETHING THAT WE PUSH OTHER DEVELOPERS TO DO ALL THE TIME, AND WE DON'T SEE. AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT, AGAIN, WHAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN SAID BEFORE, ABOUT BEING ABLE TO POINT TO A PROJECT AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE HAD IN MIND. ACTUALLY, I NO  KNOW IT SOUNDS E IT WAS A PAIN THAT THAT WAS THE REQUIREMENT OF HAVING THESE TWO THINGS BUT I THINK IT HELPS US SEE THAT IT' POSBLE. AND SO I WOULD JUST -- I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW YOU REALLY HAVE BLURRED THE LINE BETWEEN THESE TWO AND YOU CAN FLOW SEAMLESSLY BETWEEN THESE DEVELOPMENTS. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY -- IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER POSITIVE THINGS THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE OUT OF THIS. I HAVE A SET OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE PUD, THE SUPEMENTAL GULATIONS, A THEN A SET OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SITE PLANS. SO ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, IT IS MY -- I DON'T KNOW, SELF-APPOINTED DUTY, ON PLANNING COMMISSION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS IN WORST CASE SCENARIO. I KNOW THI THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT EFFORDABLE HSING MPONENT OF THAT, AND I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE APPROACH LAID OUT. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. ACTUALLY, THE THREE BENEFITS -- SO THERE WERE THREE KEY BENEFITS THAT MS. DILEO TALKED ABOUT EARLY ON, AFFORDABILITY. SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT ONE. MIXED INCOME, WHICH I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE -- WHERE ARE MY NOTES? THAT'S ON ONE OF THE TABLES. IT'S VERY CLEARLY SPELLED OUT THAT MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED, YOU KNOW, DUPLEXES, MULTIFAMILY, I THINK THAT'S ON I FANTASTIC. I LOVE THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE SITE PLANS, THAT COMPONENT OF THIS WILL BE REQUIRED FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO DEVELOP THIS SITE. SO I -- GOOD JOB, STAFF, ON THAT. SUSTAINABILITY IS ANOTHER ASPECT AND THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT FOR FIGURING OUT WHAT EXACTLY THIS IS, LIKE, WE SEE A LOT OF LEAD. LEED AND HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT? I APPRECIATE THAT. I ALSO APPCIATE TT STAFF -- SO I'M COMFORTABLE. I KNOW IT'S -- HAVING KILOWATTS IS A CLEARER MEASURE FROM THE GET-GO, RIGHT, THERE'S NO RISK ASSOCIATED NECESSARILY WITH THAT. AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THIS BUILDING, AND IT HAS TO FUNCTION AS YOU HOPE IT FUNCTIONS, IS RISKING. BUT I REALLY APPREATE THAT STAFF HAS INCLUDED, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAS -- WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ARE FOUND TO NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT COMPLIANCE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. AND THAT YOU HAVE NO THEN COME BACK AND NEGOTIATE WHAT ARE COMPARABLE -- COMPARABLE SUSTAINABILITY BENEFITS. ASPE.FEEL COVERED ON THAT THE INGS THA I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT ARE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE SEE IN THE SITE PLANS AND WHAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS ALLOW OR REQUIRE, IS HAVING TO DO WITH HEIGHT. SO MY READING OF THE S SITELANS THAT THERE NOTHING, AT LEAST SHOWN RIGHT NOW, ON THE THRIVE SIDE THAT'S OVER, LIKE, 38 FEET, BUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS ALLOW UP TO 45 FEET. I'M POINTING THAT OUT. I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK THAT WAS A PRIMARY CONCERN VOICED BY NEIGHBORS. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SE THAT, LIKE, WRE AWARE THAT IF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO HAPPENS, RIGHT, THAT THERE COULD BE TALLER BUILDINGS THAN SHOWN, IT'S A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF TWO STORIES BUT THERE COULD BE THINGS THAT ARE TALLER THAN WHAT WE SEE. IS THAT FAIR? ACALLY, I CAN ASK THRIVE AND AVALON ASELL. I'M NOT READING THE SITE PLANS WRONG. YOU ARE NOT MAXING OUT THE 45-FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT, RIGHT?
03:20:32.876: >> RIGHT. THAT GIVES US FLEXIBILITY IN A LOT OF AREAS AND WHAT WE -- SOMETHING WE HAD TO WORK OUT WITH THE FIRE CHIEF, BECAUSE THAT HEIGHT THING IS FKY. TH WOULD ALLOW US TO GO AS HIGH AS THREE OR FOUR STORIES TALL AND THEN GET SOME EXTRA HOUSING AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AGAIN, THAT GIVES US FLEXIBILITY THAT MAKES THIS POSSIBLE.
03:20:56.033: >> Chair Mills: AND THE NEXT THANK YOU HIT ON WAS FAR -- I'M SORRY, NOT FAR, BUT THE DENSITY. SO YOU ARE RIGHT NOW YOU ARE YOUR DENSITY, YOUR ALLOWABLE DENSITY IS UP TO 16 UNITS PER ACRE AND WHA YOU HAVE -- MY CALCULATIONS, I THINK ARE 11.6. SO FOR ME, I -- I MEAN, MY QUESTION THAT I WILL ASK TO YOU, IS WHY ARE YOU ONLY 11.6 AND NOT 16? BECAUSE THIS IS A SITE THAT IS LIKE HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHERE WEANT PEOPLE BUILDG?
03:21:29.700: >> YEAH. NO. THERE'S A LOT OF FUNCTIONS FOR THAT. THANKS FOR ASKING THAT HE REQUEST, BECAUSE IN THE DREAM WORLD, WE WOULD BE FINDING WAYS OF MAKING THESE THINGS MORE DENSE. THE -- THE WEIRD THING IS LIKE IT'S UNITS, AND THE WAY WE COUNT UNITS IS JUST SO KIND OF SILLY, RIGHT, AND AN ARBITRARY THING. SO IF YOU TURN ONE OF THE HOMES -- ONE OF THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES INTO FOUR MICROUNITS, IT'S FOUR UNITS INSTEAD OF ONE. SO WE HAVE THE OPTION OF DOING THAT LATER WITH THE -- WITH THE -- YOU KNOW, THE R4B, FRANKLY. SO, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER FUNCTION OF THAT IS ON THE FOOTPRINTS THEMSELVES, 40 YOU DO YOU DO -- HOW DO YOU DO THAT? WE ARE PUSHING UP AGAINST ALL KINDS OF THINGS. WHEN YOU DO GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, AGAIN, MEG APIS ONE OF OUR FAVOR -- MEGAN IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. WHERE ARE THE SETBACKS? WHERE DO YOU PUT THE EQUALIZATION DRAIN PIPES INSIDE THE BIOSWALES. DO YOU TEAR DOWN BURR OAKREES, BECAUSE YOUAVE TO PUT THEM AROUND THE TREES. CRAZY THINGS LIKE THAT ARE REALLY DYNAMIC AND COMPLEX IN A WAY THAT MOST DEVELOPERS WOULD JUST SAY LET'S JUST BUILD A GRID AND POP EVERYTHING ON HERE AND MAXIMIZE EVERYTHING. WE DIDN'T DO THAT, AND WE REALLY TRIED TO BALANCE EVERYTHING AND OPTIMIZE IT. THAT SAID, WEANT NNED TOO THE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE DENSITY, AND THEN ALSO REALLY SEE -- GIVE US FLEXIBILITY GOING FORWARD WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH IS -- YOU KNOW, THIS IS UNIQUE BECAUSE WE ARE DOING THIS ZONING, AND THE SITE PLANS TOGETHER. SO WE HAVE TO PRESENT THAT, BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DESIGN EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THIS RIGHT NOW, AND WE CAN DO THAT IN THE NEXT MONTHS AFTERE GET APPROVAL AND REALLY NAIL DOWN SOME OF THAT STUFF. SO THAT, AGAIN, GIVES US THAT FLEXIBILITY.
03:23:25.549: >> Chair Mills: AND I WOULD SAY, I'M FINE WITH THE FLEXIBILITY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION KNOWS AND WHOEVER IS WATCHING US OUT IN TV WORLD, THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT -- THAT YOUR SITE PNS D'THOW MORE UNITS THAN THAT, BUT IF THERE WERE -- IF WE APPROVE THE REZONING, TO THIS PUD WITH THESE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, A FUTURE DEVELOPMENT THERE -- THERE COULD BE MORE UNITS, RIGHT, JUST BECAUSE THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE. AND SO I'M FINE WITH THAT. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT, AND WELCOME THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT YOU ARE BUILDING IN. THIS IS THE PLACE FOR THAT. AND I THINK THAT THE PLANS THAT WE SEE SHOW THAT Y A DOING DENSITY RIGHT. AND SO, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S TRANSPARENT THERE.
03:24:12.462: >> SO JUST ONE MORE THING. I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU. JUST IN CASE THERE ARE FOLKS OUT THERE, TALKING ABOUT THE DENSITY AND THE 45-FOOT HEIGHT, I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO GET THE NOTION THAT WE COULD JUST HAVE THE ENTIRE SITE BOMES 45 ET. IT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE, BECAUSE THE FIRE CHIEF HAS AN ISSUE. THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THAT IS POSSIBLE, IS ONE BUILDING AND THAT'S THE FARMHOUSE. AND WE DELIBERATELY PUT IN A -- A PERMEABLE -- WHAT WILL LIKELY LOOK LIKE GRASS BUT IT'S RATED TO HOLD A FIRE TRUCK. SO WE CAN EXPAND THIS ROADWAY TO ALLOW FOR A FIRE TRUCK, BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A WIDER ROAD AND THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT YOU COULD GET TO THAT KIND OF HEIGHT. SO WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO GET TO THAT HEIGHT IN ANY OTHER PLACE.
03:25:00.944: >> Chair Mills: AND EVEN IN TERMS OF LIKE IF -- IF THE IDEA PEOPLE, AGAIN, ALL OF THATO SOME DENSITY WOULD NEEDO BE WITHIN THE LIVING BUILDING CHALLENGE, BECAUSE THAT'S WRITTEN INTO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGS TOO. AND SO ADDITIONAL UNITS WOULD STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO COVER ALL OF THEIR OWN ENERGY, RIGHT? AND SO I THINK THAT'S -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE, LIKE, THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF, YOU KNOW -- WHEN YOU REZONE SOMETHING, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES ALONG WITH THE SITE PLAN, THERE'S SOMETIMES AN AN EXPECTATION THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL SEE. WE HOPE -- WE ALL HOPE UPON HOPE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WILL SEE. BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY IN CASE YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD IN TERMTERMS SEAT PLAN, BUT -- THEE PLAN, BUT I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT, BECAUSE WHERE IT IS AND WHERE IT'S ACCESSIBLE. I -- I SKIPPED OVER THIS WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT HEIGHT, BUT MS. DELEO, THERE'S A REFERENCE TO PARAGRAPH 9, LIKE IT -- HERE ARE THE HEIGH LIMITS AND REFERENCE TO PARAGRAPH NINE. I THINK IT REFERS TO THE TWO-STORY MINIMUM THAT ACE IN -- NOW CALLED 8F. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
03:26:23.226: >> I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT -- IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. IT'S HARD WORKING IN A PANDEMIC. CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. I HAVE A TYPO. THANK U FOR POINTING IT OUT. THE HEIGHT IS INTENDED -- I THINK YOU -- I THINK YOU GOT THE CONCEPT. THERE'S A TWO-STORY HEIGHT LIMIT BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR THE COMMUNITY BUILDING.
03:26:49.452: >> Chair Mills: AND I THINK WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IN CASE -- DID WANT TO -- I SEE EXACTLY I NOW. THE HEIGHT. THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT, I WANT -- I'M ALWAYS CONSCIOUS, THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T READ THE ENTIRE BREAD OF THE REGULATIONS. SO WHEN YOU DO TALK ABOUT HEIGHT IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES, I I CAE TO CROSS REFERENCE.
03:27:16.513: >> Chair Mills: I DON'T THINKY SENSE IS TT WE D'T NEED TO HAVE AN ACTUAL MOTION FOR A MISSED REFERENCE, BUT JUST TO POINT IT OUT FOR WHEN YOU ARE MOVING FORWARD.
03:27:24.588: >> THANK YOU. I DO APPRECIATE THE EXTRA EYES.
03:27:30.126: >> Chair Mills: I CAN'T HELP MYSELF. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS -- THERE ARE ACCESSORUSE THERE CAN BE, NONRESIDENTIAL THAT DIFFERS FROM NORTH AND SOUTH BUT I WANT TO ALSO BE CLEAR TO EVERYONE, THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS THAT WE SEE A NONRESIDENTIAL COMPONENT, IS THAT RIGHT? IS THAT THE CORRECT READING OF THIS?
03:27:58.922: >> CORRECT. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THERE ISUT -- BUT IT IS ENABLED.
03:28:06.963: >> Chair Mills: RIGHT. SOMETIMES -- I MEAN, THIS IS -- THIS OFTEN COMES UP IN OUR DISCUSSIONS OF PUDs, BECAUSE THE PUD IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IT ALLOWS FOR MIXED USE, MORE SO THAN SOME OF OUR OTHER DISTRICTS. THAT'S NOT THE BASIS ON WHICH, LIKE, THIS ISNIQUE. ANDO I OY WITH NOT REQUIRING THERE TO BE NONRESIDENTIAL USES. I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT, AGAIN, WORST CASE SCENARIO, AND WE -- YOU KNOW, THESE SITE PLANS DON'T GET BUILT AND SOMETHING ELSE DOES, IT MAY NOT INCLUDE A NONRESIDENTIAL COMPONENT. IT MAY NOT HAVE THESE ACCESSORY USES. LET'S SEE. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE PUD. AND SO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. SO GENERALLY, I THINK THAT THEY ARE GREAT. I DID WANT TO RAISE THE QUESTION, THOUGH, MR. DILEO, YOU HAD NOTED IN YOUR STAFF REPORT -- OR IN YOUR PRESENTATION, I THINK IT WAS IN 6A A AII ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DECIDUOUS TREES. YOU INDICATED THAT MAYBE THAT 75 WAS WRONG.
03:29:22.839: >> YES. I GOT WORD LATE TODAY THAT THE 75 WAS SOMEONE DOUBLE COUNTED SOME TREES. AND SO THE PETITIONERS ASKED IF WE COULD GO DOWN TO 50, WHICH WOULD BE PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT THE NORMAL -- I BELIEVE IT'S LIKE ONE TREE FOR EVERY 30 FEETISH. SO IF THE COMMISSION IS COMFORTABLE REDUCING THE 75 TO 50, OR COMFORTABLE JUST MATCHING THE TREE NUMBER REQUIREMENTS, SAME AS THE TRADITIONAL CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER. THE THING WE WANTED TO MOSTLY ADD IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS WAS A SPECIFIC LOWANCE FOR SPACING TO WORK AROUND THE EASEMENTS AND OVERHEAD LINES AND WHATNOT. BUT THANK YOU FOR POINTING IT OUT. I THINK WE CAN COVER IT WITH NO NODDING OR WE CAN DO IT MORE FORMALLY WITH THE AMENDMENT. THE PETITIONER SAID THEY DOUBLE COUNTED WHEN THEY REPORTE THE INOU CANS TO M SO THEY ASKED IF -- COUNT TO ME. SO THEY ASKED IF THEY CAN GO TO 50 OR THE TRADITIONAL STANDARD.
03:30:46.322: >> Chair Mills: THIS IS ONE OF THE -- YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T GET VERY MANY LETTERS AND GIVEN THE SIZE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WE -- YOU KNOW, I WOULD -- YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO HOW MUCH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THERE WAS. BUT I THINK BASED ON THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT, IT'S GENERALLY ON THE SOUTHERN PROPERTY LINE. I LIKE THAT THERE ARE -- THERE'S SOMETHING DOCUMENTING AN ENHANCED SOUTHERN BUFFER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE, BECAUSE IT'S DECIDUOUS, THE YEAR ROUND TREES, IT'S WOR -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE HAVE THERE NOW IS AS PROTECTIVE IN THE CURRENT UDC. I'M HAPPY TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT TO CHANGE THIS TO -- TO PERHAPS JUST REFLECT THAT. SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU DID FOR THE -- YOU KNOW,O RIKE THI THAT THE BEST? WOULD THAT BE THE BEST RECOMMENDATION -- THE BEST PATH FORWARD TO JUST, AGAIN, KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT T THE DECIDUOUS NATURE HERE IS PLANTED TO AT LEAST MEET WHAT IS REQUIRED IN THE U?
03:32:06.302: >> YES. LET ME READ THE -- THE UDC REQUIREMENT. AGAIN, THERE ARE THREE COMPONENTS TO A CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER. THE FIRST IS THE WIDTH AND IT MUST BE 15 FEET WIDE. OUR ENHANCED BUFFER IS GOING TO BE AVERAGE 25 FEET, ALTHOUGH SOME PLACES CAN A MINIMUM OF 15. THE SECOND PART OF A CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER IS THE PLANTINGS. THE UDC REQUIRES ONE TREE FOR EACH 15 FEET OR FRACTION. 50% OF THE TREES NEED TO BE EVERGREEN. 100% COULD, BUT 15% NEED TO BE EVERGREEN. THE REST COULD BE DECIDUOUS. AND OUR ENHANCED BUFFER TALKED ABOUT WE PUT IN A NUMBER. WE WERE GOING TO REQUEST TO GO BACK FROM A NUMBER TO ONE TREE FOR EVERY 15 FEET. AND THEN THE THEIR COMPONENT OF A LAND USE BUFFER REQUIRED IS A CONTUOUS SCREENI IN THE FORMAL OF A HEDGEBERM OR WALL. A FENCE IS CONSIDERED A SUB TYPE OF A WALL. AN ENHANCED BUFFER IS SAYING NO BERM, NO WALL. IT MUST BE A DENSE SHRUB HEDGE. SO LOOPING BACK AROUND FOR THE -- THERE'S A REQUEST ON THE OOR THAT THE COMPONENT THAT SAYS MINIMUM OF 75 TREES BE SWITCHED TO EITHER 50 TREES OR ONE TREE FOR EVERY 15 FEET CONSISTENT WITH THE UDC.
03:33:46.135: >> Chair Mills: DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE LENGTH IS.
03:33:50.740: >> VEE ONE MINUTE. AFTER 9 P.M., I JUST -- I DOT NOT TRUST MY MEMORY.
03:33:58.381: >> Chair Mills: AND I ALSO DECIDUOUS DOES NOT MEAN LIKE EVERGREENS. SORRY.
03:34:02.986: >> SEE, I KNOW A LITTLE BUILT AND I NO HE D KNOW DECIDUOUS MES LEAVES AND NOT NEEDLES.
03:34:12.762: >> SORRY, ON THE JEOPARDY GUY, DECIDUOUS IS WHEN LEAVES CAN FALL OFF THE TREES AT CERTAIN TIMES OF YEAR. IT IS NOT EVERGREEN.
03:34:23.373: >> Chair Mills: YEAH. AS I WAS SAYING IT IN MY SAID, I WAS THINKING, I DON'T THINK THAT SOUNDS RIGHT, BUT I WILL JUST GO WITH IT. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE CONFIDENCE TO PUSH IT THROUGH.
03:34:32.415: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COMMSIER GIBB-RANDL HAS TO STEP OUT OF THE ROOM.
03:34:38.221: >> Chair Mills: I MISS HER! (LAUGHTER).
03:34:43.993: >> IT'S LATE. WE SHOULD NORTH HAVE NO PRONOUNCE WORDS LIKE DECIDUOUS.
03:34:51.434: >> Chair Mills: WE'RE KILLING TIME WHILE YOU ARE LOOKING.
03:34:53.636: >> I APPRECIATE THAT.
03:34:56.139: >> Chair MillsMAE THPALTER HAS THAT NUMBER?
03:34:57.774: >> I'M GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER.
03:35:02.045: >> Chair Mills: SUSAN? I SEE YOUR HAND UP.
03:35:05.148: >> IT IS 740 FEET, ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER.
03:35:11.888: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. SO WHO HAS A CALCULATOR? 740 DIVIDED BY 15 IS WHAT IS REQUIRED. SO THAT'S 50 TREE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED ANYWAY.
03:35:21.798: >> RIGHT.
03:35:22.565: >> Chair Mills: I THINK THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN WHAT WE SHOULD SAY IS MATCH. I GUESS THIS IS WHERE I WISH COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL WERE HERE. LIKE, I DON'T KNOW GIVEN THAT THAT MAY BE A SENSITIVITY IF WE WOULD WANT TO -- IF THIS IS AN ENHANCED BUFFER. IN THE INTENSION WAS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EVERGREEN TREES AND NOT DECIDUOUS TREES. SINCE THERE A VEGETATED EDGE VEE THAT SEEMS PRETTY HIGH, I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU KNOW, MR. DILEO OF WHAT THE INTENTION WAS IN SPECIFICALLY CALLING OUT THE 75 TREES -- THE 75 TREES THERE?
03:36:01.571: >> LE I SAY, I THINK THE 75 WAS A DOUBLE COUNTING OF ONE OF THE GROUPS, EITHER WE DOUBLE COUNTED THE -- THE EVERGREENS OR WE DOUBLE COUNTED THE DECIDUOUS INSTEAD OF MAKING IT A SUBSET OF. NOW, MY -- EVERY REPORT BACK I GOT WAS THE ADJACENT PROPERT NERS JUST SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR DENSE SHRUBBED, AND THE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS REALLY RELAYED THAT TO ME AS STAFF, SAYING, WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS WORK. THAT WAS THE REQUEST THAT THEY -- THEY WANTED ALMOST A SOLID WALL OF GREENERY. SO I -- IT WAS NOT CONVEYED TO ME ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC REQUESTS ABOUT EVERGREEN TREES OR DECIDUOUS TREES, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM MADE IT CLEAR TO ME THAT THE NEIGHBORS REALLY WANTED THESE DENSE SHRUBBED AND THEY WANTED IT LITTL THICKER THAN USUAL. I DEFER TO THE PETITIONER'S LANDSCAPE PERSON ABOUT WHAT IS PLANNED THEN BECAUSE COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL IS USUALLY THE ONE WOULD LOOKS AT WHAT THE PLANTINGS ARE IN THE HEDGE ROW. AND IF THOSE ARE DECIDUOUS OR EVERGREEN. IN MY MIND THAT MAKES --
03:37:26.622: >> NO, THEY ARE BOTH. THEY ARE --HERE ARE DECUOUS TREES, AND EVERGREEN TREES FOR THE TREE COMPONENT AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT, THERE ARE SHRUBS.
03:37:38.334: >> Chair Mills: NO, I THINK THE WHETHER OR NOT -- WHETHER OR NOT THAT SHRUBS, RIGHT, LIKE SOME SHRUBS -- I DON'T KNOW I HAVE SEEN HEDGES THAT LOSE THEIR LEAVES. I DON'T KNOW. SO GO AHEAD, PETITIONER?
03:37:50.146: >> YEAH. SO THE SOUTHERN ENHANCED BUFFER WAS GENERATED THROUGH A CONVERSATION WH THE COMMUNITY THATAPPENED LAST AUGUST AND WHAT THE NEIGHBORS WERE TELLING US WAS THAT THEY REALLY WANTED SHRUBBED AS A SCREEN BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL THAT DECIDUOUS TREES WOULD ADEQUATELY SCREENED. AND THAT'S WHERE THE SHRUB, THE 25-FOOT ENHANCED BUFFER COMES FROM. THOSE ARE PRIMARILY DECIDUOUS SHRUBS BUT THEY ARE 8 FEET TALL. SO THEY ARE GOING IN AT A MINIMUM OF 4 FEET. THEY ARE GROWING TO A MINIMUM OF 8 FEET AND WE HAVE A 25-FOOT WIDE BUFFER THAT INCLUDES THE DECIDUOUS TREES AND THE SHRUBS. SO IN TERMS OF TREES WE HE 5 TRS RIGHT NOW FOR THAT SOUTHERN BUFFER. 33 OF THEM ARE EVERGREEN. AND THE REST OF THE 18 ARE DECIDUOUS.
03:38:48.004: >> Chair Mills: AGAIN, WHAT IS IN THE PLAN? LIKE, YOU HAVE HEARD FROM NEIGHBORS, RIGHT, LIKE THIS HAS BEEN VETTED. I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE PUT IN THE SULEMENTAL REGATIONS THAT WOULD STK WITH IT, RIGHT, IS THERE FOR THE NEXT PERSON. SO ACTUALLY, I WOULD -- I WOULD ALMOST SUGGEST THAT WE CUT THE NUMBER. I THINK NOW I'M FORMULATING WHAT THE RIGHT AMENDMENT THAT I'M GOING TO PROPOSE IS, BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE PLANTINGS THESE DECIDUOUS AND/OR EVERGREEN PLANTINGS, OUR CODE REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF 15% EVERGREEN. IF WE SAY 50% EVERGREEN, YOU ARE PROVIDING MORE THAN THAT. THIS IS PROVIDING SOME YEAR-ROUND COVER WHICH IS WHAT I READ IN SOME OF THE LETTERS, THAT WHAT I JUST HEARD TOO WAS THAT YOUR HEDGE IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE PROVIDING BEUSE IT'S GOING TO BE MAYBE THICK, BUT BRANCHES WITHOUT LEAVES IN THE WINTER. SO I'M GOING TO MOVE AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD MODIFY 6AII TO AINIMUM OF 50% OF THE REQUIRED -- OR THE NUMBER OF EVERGREEN TREES -- OR OF THE TREES REQUIRED PER THE UDC MUST BE EVERGREENS.
03:40:20.930: >> SO FOR CLARIFICATION, THE MODIFICATION TO 6AII WOULD BE THE PLANTING REQUIREMENT WOULD MATCH THE UDC BUT MINIMUM 50% OF EVERGREEN TREES.
03:40:40.483: >> Chair Mills: CORRECT. SO REALLY, THE 50 TREES THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING, YOU ARE PROVIDING 51. YOU MATCH THED. C, THAT'S FINE. IT'S JUST SPECIFYING THAT -- THAT 25 OF THOSE IN THIS CASE NEED TO BE EVERGREENS. SO -- YEAH. AND SO YOU WILL EXCEED THAT. ITS GREAT. LIKE, THERE'S SOME WIGGLE ROOM IN THERE FOR YOU. ARE PRECT PROTECTED IN THE FUTU. BUT NOBODY ELSE IS SECONDING THAT MOTION. COMMISSIONER SAUVE IS SECONDING IT. ANY DISCUSSION ON THAT? COMMISSIONER WOODS AND MR. LENART FIRST MAYBE AND THEN COMMISSIONER WOODS.
03:41:23.826: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY.
03:41:24.427: >> Planning Manager:  I WANT TO CLARIFY IF YOU ARE PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD MIMIC THE UDC REQUIREMENTS OF FREQUENCY OF PLANTING AND 50% EVERGREEN, THEN I JUST WANT TO SUGGEST JUST STRIKING THAT PROVISION ALL TOGETHER. WHENEVER THERE'S NOTHING SPECIFIC IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGS, THE UDC IS GOING TO -- IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED AND IF I'M HAVE ESSENTIALLY JUST AMENDED THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGS TO MATCH WHAT THE CODE ALREADY SAYS.
03:41:56.258: >> Chair Mills: I'M ASKING FOR MORE EVERGREENS. MY UNDERSTANDING --
03:41:59.929: >> Planning Manager:  MORE NAN 50%?
03:42:01.564: >> Chair Mills: I THOUGHT I HEARD FROM -- I THOUGHT WHEN MAYBE -- I THOUGHT I HEARD 15% WAS WHAT WAS REQUIRED, AND 50% IS WHAT I ROMMENDED,UT IS THAT -- DID I MISHEAR?
03:42:19.648: >> 50% --
03:42:19.949: >> Planning Manager:  50.
03:42:22.351: >> THE 15 IS ONE PER EVERY 15 FEET.
03:42:26.255: >> Chair Mills: I GOT THAT. I WILL THOUGHT IT WAS 15% THAT -- 15% OF EVERY 15 FEET. OKAY. WELL --
03:42:38.534: >> Planning Manager:  SO I SUGGEST THAT'S THE DIRECTION YOU GO IN. THE ONLY SUPPLEMENTAL REGS, IT'S GOING TO BE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER, EXCEPT IT WILL REQUIRE A GREATER WIDTH. IT GOING TO SPECIFY A CONTINUOUS HEDGE ROW AND ALLOW THE ADJUMES OM CONTINUOUS CONTINUITY. IT'S NOT, IN FACT, GOING TO SPECIFY. IT WOULD NOT -- THE AMENDMENT WOULD NOT SPECIFY ANY -- ANY QUANTITY OF PLANTINGS BEYOND THE -- WATT UDC ALREADY REQUIRES. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE ALEXIS.
03:43:21.877: >> YES.
03:43:22.745: >> Chair Mills: UNLESS COMMISSICOMMISSIONER WOODS LIKEI WOULD TAKE IT BACK. SORRY. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S LATE OR THAT I -- 15 AND 50 ARE CLOSE.
03:43:44.466: >> WE COULD DO AN AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT TO GET RID OF 6AII.
03:43:50.606: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU, YES. IF YOU ARE FRIENDLY TO THAT. ANY DISCUSSION OF JUST GETTING RID OF THAT -- THE NUMBER OF TREES HERE AND JUST DEFERRING TO THE UDC? COMMISSIONER WOODS?
03:44:02.718: >> Comssioner Woods: YEAH, I GUESS  AND MAYBE IT IS THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR, BUT I THINK MAYBE GIVEN THAT THEIR LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT AND PROBABLY OURS ALSO HAVE LOOKED AT IT, AND I SORT OF HAVE THE SENSE THAT WE ARE PERHAPS GOING DOWN INTO THE WEEDS SO TO SPEAK. AND ONE PERSON WOULD IS NOT HERE IS A PERSON WHO, I BELIEVE, IS A NSULTANT ON TS PROJECT. SO I GUESS I JUST DON'T -- I DOT THINK THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO DO THAT AT THIS POINT. I WOULD -- SO I WOULDN'T BE IN FAVOR OF IT. THAT WOULD JUST BE MY OPINION.
03:44:40.189: >> Chair Mills: WHAT I HEARD IS THAT WHAT IS SHOWN ON THE PLANS DON'T MATCH THIS. LIKE, THEY ARE NOT MEETING THIS. SO WE CAN'T APPROVE THE ST PLAN OR W SHOULDN'T APPROVE THE SITE PLAN IF WE PASS THESE SUPPLEMENTAL REGS, WE SHOULDN'T APPROVE THE SITE PLAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATCH THIS. IS THAT TRUE, ALEXIS?
03:44:55.237: >> THAT'S WHAT THEIR LANDSCAPE CONSULTANT TOLD ME.
03:45:01.710: >> Commissioner Woods: WELL, BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION THEN. THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE SOMETHING THAT COULD GET WORKED OUT AND T TAN CARE OF BEFORE IT GOES TO COUNCIL.
03:45:12.388: >> WELL, I GUESS THIS -- DOES THE COMMISSION LIKE THE BUFFER THAT IS SHOWN ON THE SITE PLAN? AND IF SO, I WILL WORK TO PROPERLY MEMORIALIZE IT. IF YOU THINK THAT MORE IS NEEDED, WE CAN DISCUSS THAT, BUT IF YOU LIKHAT IS SHOWN ON THE PLAN, THEN I CAN WORK TO MEMORIALIZE IT.
03:45:38.280: >> Chair Mills: YES. SO WE DON'T NEED ANY MOTION IS THAT RIGHT? UH, NO. IF.
03:45:46.855: >> NO, WE DON'T NEED A MOTION. IF NEEDED, I CAN EXPLAIN TO CITY COUNCIL THAT I HAV ME A CHANGEO THAT YOU DID NOT SPECIFICALLY RECOMMEND, BUT I WILL EXPLAIN THAT IT HAD YOUR BLESSING AND THE REASON WHY WE NEEDED TO MAKE THIS CHANGE WAS TO MEMORIALIZE WHAT WAS SHOWN AND YOU HAVE SPECIFICALLY APPROVED THE PLAN AS SHOWN.
03:46:09.244: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WAS THERE A MOTION AND A SECOND?
03:46:13.982: >> Chair Mills: YES. SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT, IS THAT RIGHT, ZACK?
03:46:17.019: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  WE HAVE TO VOTE IT DOWN.
03:46:20.222: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. SO THE MOTION WHICH WOULD STRIKE THAT LANGUAGE WOULD -- WE SHOULD VOTE ON. IS THERE ANY MORE DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:46:32.935: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I'M CONFUSED. SO AS IT STANDS NOW, IT SAYS THEY ARE PUTTING IN 75 TREES OTREES.THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY PUN 75 TREES, THEY ARE PUTTING IN 50. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING -- WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY MOTION. WE CAN APPROVE WITH THE 75 IN THERE AND STAFF WILL DO SOMETHING WITH IT BEFORE ITS TO CITY COUNCIL. IS THAT CLEAR?
03:46:54.423: >> YES.
03:46:54.690: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. THEN I'M GOOD. WE WE CAN VOLT.
03:46:59.628: >> Chair Mills: ALL IN FAVOR OF STRIKING THAT LANGUAGE SAY YES. OR RAISE YOUR HAND. ALL OPPOSED? SAY AYE. RAISE YOUR HAND. OKAY. SO THE AMENDMENT FAILS. WE ARE BACK TO -- THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMENDMENT THAT WE HAD EARLIER, WHICH ZACH H OFFERED. THOSE WERE MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE PUD AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE SITE PLAN, ONE IS MINOR AND ONE I THINK IS A LITTLE BIT MORE MAJOR OR -- OR SENSITIVE. THE MINOR ONE ISBO BICYCLE PARKING. I THINK IT'S GREAT, LIKE -- I LIKE THE LOOK OF THE BIKE HOUSE. WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT IS THE PEOPLE WHO -- WHO COME TO VISIT ON THEIR BICYCLING BECAUSE THIS IS A BICYCLING ACCESSIBLE PLACE, WOULD VISIT PEOPLE IN, YOU KNOW, THE APARTMENTS OR THE HOUSES, WHERE IS YOUR GUEST BIKE PARKING BY THE RESIDENCES?
03:48:01.957: >> 'S -- I WI JUST TELL YOU, IT'S ON THE PLAN AND IT'S ABUNDANT, BECAUSE, YEAH, WE AND SHANNON WHO IS NOT HERE, YOU KNOW, WE BIKE. WE KNOW WHERE PEOPLE PARK THEIR BIKES AND THERE'S A LOT. IF YOU WANT MORE --
03:48:22.077: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt:
03:48:22.711: >> Chair Mills: I WAS TRYING TO FIND IT. WHEN WE SAY IT'S ABUNDANT, THERE ARE BIKE HOOPS THROUGHOUT.
03:48:32.354: >> YES, IN FRONT OF UNITS AND MEGAN, THEY GET IN YOUR WAY IF YOU WANT TO ANSWER, YOU MIGHT HAVE OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD OF WHERE THEY ARE. SO MEGHAN FROM BIOHABITATS DESIGNED OUR BIOSWAL ES A STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE. SO STICKING ANYTHING IN THE COUNT IMPACTS HER WORK. SO SHE MIGHT HAVE AN ANSWER. IF YOU DO, GIVE ME A THUMBS UP. IF NOT, SHE DOESN'T. SO I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT THEY ARE THERE. TRUST US. (LAUGHTER).
03:49:04.453: >> Chair Mills: I MEAN THERE'S A SITE OF PLANS TO DIG THROUGH. THAT'S THE THING I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT BICYCLES PARKED -- TO THE TREES THAT YOU PLANTED. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THROUGHOUT.
03:49:23.105: >> SO TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, WE HAVE 179 POT 179 TOTAL BIKE SPAY 124 ARE ENCLOSED. SOUBTRACT 124 FROM 179, AND THAT'S THE BIKE PARKING THAT YOU HAVE GOT THAT'S IN OPEN AIR. OR COVERED, BUT NOT ENCLOSED.
03:49:45.761: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. GOT IT. I WILL GO BACK AND LOOK A LITTLE BIT CLOSER AGAIN AND MAKE SURE THAT I CAN SEE THEM. THE ONE THAT I THINK IS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT LIGHTING AND SADLY, COMMISSIONER BRIGGS IS ALSO NOT HERE TONIGHT WHO IS KIND OF MY LIGHTING COMPADRE, AND THIS IS THE PHOTOMETRIC PLANS, BETWEEN THE TWO SITES SEEM QUITE DIFFERENT IN TERMS THE OVELL FOOT CANES AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY. PARTICULARLY THE FIND OF -- THE LIGHTING THAT YOU SEE, I THINK -- MOST OF WHAT I'M SEEING IS WHEN YOU ARE WITHIN THIS DEVELOPMENT, YOU KNOW, COLLECTIVELY, YOU MOVE SEEMLESSLY BETWEEN THEM. WHY O THE THRIVE SIDE, THE MOST COMMON NUMBER I SEE ON THE ROADS AND THE PARKING LOTS IS .1 AND SOMETIMES .3-FOOT CANDLES AND THERE'S A COUPLE INSTANCES WHERE IT WAS UP TO 4.6 BUT ON THE AVALON SIDE, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME NUMBERS IN THE TWOS. SO I DON'T KNOW WHICHF YO MAYBE IT'S BOTH SIDES THAT C EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT IS OR WHAT IS LEADING TO THAT.
03:51:02.938: >> I CAN TALK A BIT ABOUT IT FROM AVALON'S SIDE. WELL, NUMBER ONE THE TYPE OF THE FIXTURES THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO USE ARE EXHIB CONSISTENT THROUGT THE SITE, AS FAR AS WHAT TYPE OF LIGHTING AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT, BUTOU ARE RIGHT, AS FAR AS THE WARMTH OF THE LIGHTING, WE ARE LOOKING TO BE CONSISTENT, BUT AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF FIXTURES WE DO LOOK TO HAVE MORE, REALLY RELYING ON OUR EXPERIENCE AND OUR TENANTS AND PROPERTIES OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND GIVING FOLKS THAT SENSE OF SECURITY AND THAT -- YOU KNOW, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WHERE THEY ARE HAVEOMEN THE PAST AND HOW THEY -- THAT HELPS THEIR EXPERIENCE LIVING IN OUR PROPERTY. AND I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY -- IT'S AI BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHERE THRIVE IS LOOKING AT THINGS. AND THIS WOULD BE THE PROPERTY THAT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF LIGHTING, OF ANY OF AVALON'S SITE. SO WE TAKE THAT AS A BASIS OF PERIENCE AND ROGNIZE WT WE E TRYING T DO HERE AND, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY BRINGING IT DOWN BELOW THE LEVELS THAT WE HAVE HAD IN ANY OF OUR OTHER SITES. NONI DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY FROM AVALON'S TEAM WANT TO ANSWER THAT.
03:52:24.519: >> Cha Mills: ONEF THE THINGS THAT GOT POSTPONED LAST TIME WAS KIND OF OUR LIGHTING ORDINANCE AND SO COMPARING TO WHAT WE HAVE THERE, I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT I WISH COMMISSIONER BRIGGS WAS HERE TO CHECK ON THOSE NUMBERS. THIS SENSE OF MORE LIGHT EQUALS MORE SECURITY IS ONE THA IS COMMON BUTT LEAST AS WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER OUR LIGHTLIGHTING ORDINANCE, ONE THE HAVE DISAVOWED AND IT'S CONTRAST BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK, THAT'S REALLY HARD. THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I WORRY A BIT ABOUT, PARTICULARLY I WAS LOOKING ON THE ROAD THAT YOU HAVE RUNNING TO THE -- ANG THE WEST SIDEHERE YOU GO FROM -- YOU KNOW, IT STARTS OUT AS EFFECTIVELY KIND OF AVALON ROAD AND THEN IT GOES INTO THRIVE AND AT THE BORDER, PERHAPS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE LIKE POLLUTION SPILLING FROM ONE PROPERTY TO ANOTHER, THERE'S THISEAD SPACE A YOU GO FROM PRETTY BRIGHT TO QUITE NOT, AND I -- THAT IS -- I DON'T KNOW. THAT SEEMED TO ME THAT IT WILL BE NOTICEABLE. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE WORKG TO TT THI IS LESS THAN WHAT YOU MIGHT NORMALLY HAVE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU POTENTIALLY TO TRY BLEND THOSE THINGS BETTER. I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE CONTRAST, INCLUDELY BETWEEN THE TWO AND IT WILL BE NOTICEABLE. LIKE WHY IS ONE SIDE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT LIT UP SNIFICANTLY MORE TN THE OTHER SIDE. MR. GROCOFF.
03:54:16.865: >> TNK YOU FOR BRINGING IT UP. I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS AND I THINK WENDY HAS EXPRESSED WHY THERE'S SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES, BUT THERE -- IT'S A REALLY, REALLY COMPLEX ISSUE AND KNOW THAT WE ARE REALLY DEEPLY COLLABORATING ON THIS, AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THE THINGS WHERE ON THE ONE HAND, LIKE YOU SAID ABOUT GLARE, THAT CAN IMPACT PEOPLE WITH SEEING DISABILITIES, RIGHT? ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE ISSUES WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA THAT EVEN IF LIGHTING DOESN'T ACTUALLY PROVIDE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT, IT'S THEIR PERCEPTION OF SAFETY AT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE BALANCE ALL OF THESE THINGS AND IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT I KNOW PEOPLE IN FORWARDABLE HOUSING ARE WORKING ON -- IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE WORKING ON THIS. IN LONDON, THERE'S A HUGE PROGRAM UNDERWAY AND WE ARE REALLY WORKING ON TRYING TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING, AND FIGURING OUT THINGS BUT JUST KNOW IT'S RLL CHALLENGING AVALON IS WORKING ON IT. WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB OF COMING DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BUT WE HEAR YOU, AND WE ARE WORKING ON IT.
03:55:33.241: >> Chair Mills: I APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S KIND OF BLENDING AND IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE AVERAGING. IT MIGHT -- I HATE TO DO THIS, BUT IT MIGHT RUIRE -- IT MIGHT REQUIRE PARTICULARLY ON THESE AREAS WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. AGAIN, BLENDING IT A LITTLE BIT MORE. AGAIN, I -- AND HONESTLY, I THINK THIS -- I THINK THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE MIXED INCOME -- MIXED INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD, THAT'S THE BENEFIT THAT WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THIS. FIGURING OUT -- HAVING THI CONVERSATION AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO THIS, I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK LIKE COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT SAID BEFORE, SOMETHING THAT WE WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO LEARN FROM, AND HOW CAN WE TAKE THIS TO OTHER PARTS THE COMMUNITY? COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
03:56:17.719: >> Councilmember Ackerman: POINT OF HARD. ORDER.I MAKE A MOO MION TO EXTED MEETING TO 11:30.
03:56:28.596: >> Chair Mills: SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS. EVERYONE IN FAVOR OF EXTENDING IT, SAY YES? YES. I SEE ENOUGH HANDS. THANK YOU. THAT WAS THE END OF MY THING. SO JUST -- THANK YOU FOREFACES CONVERSATIONS. THK YOU F HELPING ME UNDERSTAND THAT I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN FROM YOUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OTHER PLACES? ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM PLANNING COMMISSIONERS? WE HAVE A TWO SITE PLANS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AMENDED OR ANYTHING. WE HAVE -- OR MOTIONED THAT HAVE BEEN AMENDED. WE HAVE A PUD REZ REZONING THATS BEEN AMENDED ONCE. UP FOR A VOTE. I THINK WE SEEM READY TO TAKE A VOTE ON TT. COULYOU MR. LENART GIVE US A ROLL CALL?
03:57:40.001: >> Planning Manager:  SO THIS IS ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT WERE AMENDED, TO ADJUST THE SOUTH SETBACK FROM 30 FEET. NO CHANGE TO THE NUMBER OF TREES. AND THE SITE PLANS AS PRESENTED.
03:58:01.156: >> Chair Mills: CORRECT.
03:58:05.860: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:58:12.467: >> Comssioner Abrons:  YES.
03:58:16.004: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
03:58:21.576: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
03:58:27.615: >> Chair Mills: YES.
03:58:28.817: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
03:58:29.484: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S UNANIMOUS.
03:58:32.687: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. THANK YOU! GOOD LUCK AT COUNCIL.
03:58:36.658: >> THANK YOU.
03:58:37.125: >> Councilmember Ackerman: REALLY EXCITING.
03:58:38.993: >> THANK YOU, ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU.
03:58:45.700: >> THANK YOU TO AVALON AND EVERYONE ON OUR TEAM. THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE JOURNEY, WE ARE LEARNING A LOT. WE WANT TO GET SOME SLEEP AND KEEP EYES FORWARD AND MOVE FAST. THANKS, GUYS.
03:59:05.920: >> Chair Mills: THANKS.
03:59:10.425: >> Chair Mills: YOU ARE BRINGING COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL BACK, MR. LENART?
03:59:25.039: >> Planning Manager:  DID I ACCIDENTALLY JETTISON ANYBODY?
03:59:30.712: >> Chair Mills: NO, WE JUST NEED TO GET SHANNAN.
03:59:40.321: >> Commissner Woods: IHINK SHE WENT HOME.
03:59:43.024: >> Commissioner Abrons:  DID YOU NOTICE ME JUMPING AROUND A LOT, I'M BEING BOTHERED BY A MOSQUITO. I REALIZED ON CAMERA, I WAS JUMPING AROUND EXCESSIVELY.
03:59:55.603: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ELLIE, I FEEL LIKE WE ARE GETTING A SLOW TOUR OVER WEEKS AND WEEKS OF YOUR HOUSE, BECAUSE I FEELIKE YR BACKGROUND --
04:00:04.112: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THIS IS NOT MY HOUSE. (LAUGHTER). I'M AT A LAKE HOUSE, LIKE ON LAKE ONTARIO. MILL OH.
04:00:13.655: >> FUN!
04:00:14.355: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I STARTED OUTSIDE. I WOULD HAVE SHOWED YOU THE SUNSET BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE TO INTERRUPT ANYBODY. NOW I'M IN A LITTLE ROOM.
04:00:23.264: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SO SHANNAN, WE VOTED DOWN --
04:00:27.402: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT? ZAC>> Councilmember Ackerman:  E VOTED DOWN VERIDIAN.
04:00:34.642: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I CAN WATCH THE ENTIRE THING.
04:00:38.646: >> Chair Mills: YOU HEARD HOW MUCH YOU WERE MISSED?
04:00:40.181: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEAH, I MEAN --
04:00:42.283: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S TREE IN THERE.UGH GETTING THE 75
04:00:46.821: >> GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
04:00:47.889: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THE DRAWS ALL MATCH. IT WAS JUST A CLERICAL THING AT THE END IN TERMS OF SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. SO --
04:00:54.562: >> Planning Manager:  THE PLANNING COMMISSION DIDN'T CARE.
04:00:56.764: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR PATIENCE WITH THAT, YOU ALL.
04:01:00.902: >> Chair Mills: IF I HAD JUST HEARD THE NUMBER EARLY ON, IT WOULD HAVE SAVED I ATHE LOCUST A LOT OF TIME. JUSTIDN'T HEAR. THE NEXT ITEM IS 10B, THE REVIEW THE PLANNING COMMISSION BYLAWS. AND READING THEM TO PREPARE FOR THIS, I THINK WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO VOTE, NOT JUST -- BUT WHEN WE ARE GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING UP AFTER 11:00 IS THAT TRUE?
04:01:24.759: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
04:01:27.695: >> Chair Mills: SO WE NEED TO VOTE --
04:01:28.896: >> Planning Manager YOU HE TOO TT, NOT THE OTHER THING.
04:01:31.699: >> Chair Mills: I DIDN'T WANT TO CORRECT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT TIME. (LAUGHTER).
04:01:37.905: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I NEVER KNEW THAT.
04:01:41.175: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IN YOU ARE THE MIDDLE OF IT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO. I LEARNED THAT LAST TIME WHEN I SHARED. BRETT LET ME KNOW THAT LAST YEAR. YOU ARE JUST GETTING IT RIGHT AT THE VERY END, ZACH.
04:02:07.969: >> Chair Mills: OH, ZACH MADE A MOTION --
04:02:09.337: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE TO TAKE A MOTION TO TAKE UP THE BYLAWS.
04:02:15.176: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ZACH MOVED TO TAKE IT UP AND ELLIE SECONDED IT. ANY DISCUSSION WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD DO THAT? ALL IN FAVOR SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND. YES? THAT'S EVERYBODY. OKAY. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT IT. SO WE WILL START WITH A PRESENTION BY MR. LENART.
04:02:35.329: >> Planning Manager:  SO YOU SAW THESE ABOUT A MONTH AGO THAT I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF GETTING SOME CITY COUNSEL COMMENTS. GENERALLY, I WOULD SAY IT'S JUST A LOTF CLANG CANUP, MAKING THESE BYLAWS MORE CONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I TRIED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE NO EATABLE CHANGES AND PROPOSING THAT BEDROOM UNITS MODIFY AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TO BE PUBLIC COMMENT. FORMATTING AND -- WE DID ELIMINATE THE SECRET BALLOT IN THE ELECTION OF OFFICERS. THAT'S NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF TRANSPARENCY. I DON'T THINK WE WANT THAT THERE. CLARIFYING THOSE ACTIONS THAT PREST WHEN APPLICABLE.MEMBERS THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS PROVISIONS THAT ARE UNCHANGED THAT REQUIRE SIX VOTES TO ADVANCE A PETITION AND REQUIRE SIX VOTES FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT ESCAPES ME. TWO-THIRDS TO AMEND THE BYLAWS I'M PROPOSING TO ACED MY AUTHORITY TO CANCEL A MEETING WHEN I FIND OUT THAT THERE IS NOT A QUORUM OR LACK OF BUSINESS, AS OPPOSED TO CONTACTING THE CHAIR FOR THAT. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ORDER OF AGENDA. RIGHT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS LILISTED UNDER REGULAR BASIS. WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIEARINGS FOR SOME ITEMS UNDER REGULAR BASIS. SO CLARIFYING THAT REGULAR BASIS COULD BE SOME ITEMS WITH YOU CAN PUBLIC AREAINGS AND SOME ITEMS WITHOUT PUBLIC AREAINGS. SO WE TALKED ABOUT THIS PREVIOUSLY. THE -- THE AUTOMATIC MANDATED REVIEW OF ME, MY PERFORMANCE BY YOU AS A COMMISSION, WAS KIND OF A HOLDOVER FROM WHEN THE PLANNING COMMISSN ACTLLY HIRED THE PLAN DIRECTOR THERE IS NO LONGER A PLANNING DIRECTOR. THERE'S A PLANNING MANAGER. I'M PROPOSING THAT THAT THAT FEEDBACK WHEN MY BOSS, THE COMMUNITY SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR ASKS YOU FOR THAT FEEDBACK AS OPPOSED TO AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRING YO TO DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS. I'M ALWAYS WELCOME TO DISCUSS HOW I CAN IMPROVE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE ORDER AFTER JEN DAH AND THE TEN MINUTE PRESENTATION AND I CAN HIGHLIGHT THAT. NOT CRITICAL BUT I DID HIGHLIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE TWO PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS SEPARATE FROM OUR PUBLIC HEANGS. I THINKUT THIS IN HERE AS A DISCUSSION POINT ON THE EVE OF OUR LAST COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND PERHAPS THIS ONE WHERE WE HAD A COUPLE GOING LATE. IT'S THERE NOW. BUT IF YOU WANT TO JUST SHORTEN THE AGENDA, PROVIDING ONE PUBLIC COMMENT OPPORTUNITY AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR INDIVIDUAL IMS, WE DEFINITELY NEED TO MEET THE OPEN MEETINGS REQUIREMENT ACT. THE BYLAWS REQUIRE THAT YOU -- I PRESENT THESE TO YOU BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES EVEN THOUGH YOU SAW THEM. I WOULD LIKE ANY FEEDBACK CHANGES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE OR DISCUSS AND THEN IF Y WOULD RESPOND, REFLECT, PROPOSE -- PROVIDE ANY OF THOSE CHANGES FOR ADOPTION AT THE NEXT MEETING.
04:06:23.858: >> Chair Mills: THE SCRIPT YOU GAVE ME AND WHAT YOU JUST SAID SUGGESTS THAT WE DO NOT GO TO PUBLIC HEARING NEXT, THAT WE -- THAT I READ THE MOTION. IS THAT RIGHT? SO THE MOTION IS THE NOMAR GANN ARBORPLANNING COMMISSION MR FUTURE CONSIDERATION AT THE NEXT PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. MOVED BY MILSHTEYN AND SECONDED BY HAMMERSCHMIDT. DISCUSSION? COMMISSION GIBB-RANDALL.
04:06:57.992: >> Commissioner Gi-Randall: I WOULD JUST SAY, I'M IN FAVOR OF WHAT YOU PUT FORTH SO F AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE TWO OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, JUST BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO STAY UP LATE. AND I THINK SOMETIMES WE ACTUALLY GET SOME REALLY INTERESTING FEEDBACK FOR THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY STICK WITH IT UNTIL THE END. AND IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCHIM I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF KEEPING THAT.
04:07:24.318: >> Chair Mills: OTHER COMMENTS? I CONCUR. LIKE I SAID BEFORE, I ALSO APPRECIATE READING THIS ONCE A YEAR TO REMIND US OF THE LITTLE THINGS LIKE WHEN WE VOTE TO EXTEND. THE THING THAT I NOT THI TIME THAT IS IN THERE, THAT WE DON'T DO, IS IT SAYS THAT THE PETITIONER CAN RESPOND -- HAS THREE MINUTES TO RESPOND AT THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE WE GO INTO OUR DISCUSSION. WE DON'T DO THAT. I'M WONDERING IF WE SHOULD. I THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS IT.
04:07:59.787: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, THAT'S SOMETHING -- THANK YOU FOBRINGINGHAT UP. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I -- I ADDED. ONE THE THINGS THAT HAS COME UP -- LIKE, WE HAVE GONE THROUGH AN EVOLUTION, IF YOU RECALL IN THE PAST, WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY SEPARATE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PETITIONER TO PRESENT THEIR PROJECT APART FROM THE PUBLIC HEARING ITSELF. AND AT TIMES, THAT COULD -- THAT MANIFESTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. SOMETIMESONE PERSON GETS UP AND GIVING FIVE MINUTES AT THAT TIME. WE HAD OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY WOULD DO FIVE MINUTES AND THEN THE ENGINEER COMES UP FOR THREE AND THEN THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT FOR THREE AND THE TRAFFIC ENGINEER AND SO WHEN WE SWITCHED TO THE TEN MINUTE, THE INTENTION WAS THAT WE WERE COMPRESSING ALL OF THAT AS A WIDER OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PETITIONER TO PRESENT THEIR OJECT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION INCLUSIVE OF ALL OF THOSE ASPECTS. TO THAT END, WE SELL THE PETITIONER, THEY SHOULD NOT BE ADDRESSING THE COMMISSION DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING PORTION. THAT IS REALLY FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE PROJECT. GIVEN THAT RESTRICTION, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE THE PETITIONERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY REBUT, BRIEFLY ANYTHING THAT THEY HEARD IN THE PUBLIC HEARING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO. IT DOESN'T COME UP MUCH BECAUSE I THINK FRANKLY THE COMMISSION DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF RESPONDING AND BRINGING UP THOSE ESTIS AND YOUR DELIBERATION AND PROVIDES A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PETITIONERS TO DO SO. IT'S PROBABLY CLEANER IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A HARD LINE, NO YOU GET TEN MINUTES AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF -- IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD BEFORE YOUR DELIBERATION, YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES OR IF NOT, YOU CAN KICK IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO EMPHASIZE WITH THE NEW PETITION STRUCTURE.
04:10:05.412: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONERS MILSHTEYN AND THIS ABRONS.
04:10:08.149: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I THINK THE REASON WE STOPPED THAT IN OUR AUDIENCE WHO WOULDAS ACTUALLY -- THEY WOULD ALLOW WHY DO THEY GET A CHANCE TO STAND UP AGAIN? PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE ANGRY IN THE PAST. I REMEMBER COMMISSIONER WOODS HAD SOMEBODY WHEN SHE WAS CHAIRING WHO GOT A LITTLE ROWDY BECAUSE THEY WERE UNHAPPY THAT THE PETITIONER GOT UP FOR ANOTHER THREE MINUTES AND THEY WANTED ANOTHER THREE MINUTES SO THEY COULD REBUTTAL THE -- HAVE MORE TIME TO REBUTTAL WHAT WAS SAID. SO I THINK THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE GOT AWAY FROM THAT.
04:10:43.551: >> Planning Manager:  SO THAT WAS PROBABLY HAPPENING WHEN THE PETITIONER WAS SPEAKING DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING?
04:10:50.524: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YEAH. YEAH, DURING THE LAST PART OF THE PUBLIC HEARING.
04:11:00.801: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
04:11:02.736: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YEAH, I WASN'T PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO WITNESS, THAT BUT THAT WAS KIND OF MY INTUITION, WAS THAT I THINK THAT FORMAT MAYBE PITS THE PUBLIC COMMENT AGAINST THE DEVELOPER IN A KIND OF ADVERSARIAL WAY. I THINK AT LEAST AS I OBSERVED THIS BODY,E DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB ASKING -- WE ASK THE PETITIONER TO RESPOND TO WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC COMMENT, BUT I THINK WE'RE OFTEN ABLE TO KIND OF FRAME THE QUESTION FOR -- GIVE IT SOME CONTEXT IN A WAY THAT IT TAKES THE CONFRONTATIONAL EDGE OFF. I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF, I GUESS STRIKING IT FROM THE BYLAWS AND -- AND DOING THE THINGS THE WAY WE CURRENTLY DO.
04:11:45.279: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. IT'S KIND OF LIKE DATA, DATA, DATA FOR US. WE HAVE PRESENTATION, STAFF REPORT AND PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN IT'S OURS TO I CAN MA THE MOST OF -- TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT AND I FEEL LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE A PETITIONER EVENTUAY WH IS -- DOE'T HAVEHE TEMPERAMENT TO, LIKE, BE COOL AFTER SOME STRONG PUBLIC FEEDBACK AND MAY END UP HE IS ESCALATING THE SITUATION. Chair Mills: COMMISSIONERES. ABRONS.
04:12:25.719: >> Commissioner Abrons:  ONE
04:12:27.288: >> Commissioner Abrons: NE THING I NOTICED IN HERE IT SAYS THAT A CHAIR CAN EXTEND THE INDIVIDUAL'S THREE MINUTE SPEAKING TIME AT THEIR DICESSION. HE WONDERED IF THAT WAS -- I NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN. I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO KEEP IN HERE OR WHEN WOULD THAT BESEL?
04:12:46.106: >> Planning Mager:  YEAH, I -- IT'S PROBABLY -- IT'S PROBABLY MOST USEFUL IN THE CONTEXT OF PROVIDING A LITTLE FLEXIBILITY FOR MAYBE A HEATED DISCUSSION SO THAT IT GIVES THE CHAIR ULTIMATELY A LITTLE DISCRETION SO THAT IF -- IF -- U KNOW, SAY THERE WAS OPPOSITIONAL VIEWS ON SOMETHING, PAND SOMEBODY WENT BEYOND THEIR THREE MINUTES AND WELL, SUCH AND SUCH GOT, YOU THOUGH, THREE MINUTES AND 40 SECONDS. SO I EXPECT THAT I'M GOING TO GET THREE MINUTES AND 40 SECONDS. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT NEEDS TO BE THERE. I THINK THAT JUST HAPPENS NATURALLY AND THE CHAIR IS MANAGING THAT DISCUSSION, BUT THAT -- THAT MIGHT B WHE IT ORIGATED TO KIND OF PROVIDE THAT OFFICIAL RECOGNITION THAT ULTIMATELY IN THIS CASE, SARAH HAS SOME DISCRETION TO TRY AND MANAGE THAT SITUATION.
04:13:47.167: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL AN AND THEN COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
04:13:54.775: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I HAVEN'T SEEN IT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN, AND SOMETIMES IT'S JUST FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH THEIR THOUGHT AND IT IS A COURTESY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. AND I MEAN, IT'S PROBABLY HAPPENED HALF A DOZEN TIMES. I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THE CHAIR TO HAVE SOME DISCRETION TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. TO BE ABLE TO CAL IT IN EITHER DIRECTION.
04:14:19.099: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
04:14:21.769: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I HAVE TO UNMUTE. THAT'S ONLY DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT, NOT DURING -- OH, MY GOD, I TOTALLY FORGOT WHAT IT WAS CALLED. I PUBLIC HEARING. SO PUBLIC HEARING,HERE WOULD NOT BE THAT SAME EXTENSION OR DO WE WANT IT IN BOTH PLACES?
04:14:39.353: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. IF WE WANT IT IN ONE, WE PROBABLY WANT IT IN BOTH.
04:14:45.793: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH, I MEAN THE WAY IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT BEING IN BOTH PLACES THAT THE CHAIR HAS THE DISCRETION TO EXTEND THE PUBLIC COMMENTR IN PUBLIC HEARINGS. SO AS A COURTESY, I THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN EITHER CASE. I HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION AS I WAS GOING THROUGH THIS AND MAYBE THERE'S SOME BACKGROUND ON THIS. SO IT SAYS A PERSON REPRESENTING AN ORGANIZED NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP CAN SPEAK FOR UP TO FIVE MINUTES AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE ALSO PART OF THAT GROUP CAN SPEAK FOR THREE MINUTES. WHAT IS THE RATIONALE BEHIND LETTING ONE PERSON SPEAK FOR VE MINUTES BUT THEN OTHER PEOPLE CAN SPEAK FOR THREE MINUTES?
04:15:26.300: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE. I PRESUME -- I PRESUME IT'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT A NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATION IS ORGANIZED AND MAYBE HAS SOME VOICE OF MAYBE A LARGER GROUP OF RESIDENTS FROM THAT ARE BUT YO POINT IS GOOD THAT TECHNICALLY EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET UP AS WELL. IT COULD BE --
04:15:54.561: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DON'T REMEMBER IF WE HAVE BEEN FACED WITH THAT IN THE PAST YEAR. MAYBE WE HAVE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT AN EXTRA TWO MINUTES AFRDS, I YOU WL LET OTHERS TALK FOR THREE MINUTES.
04:16:07.508: >> Chair Mills: IT HASN'T COME UP IN THE LAST YEAR. WE'RE -- I DON'T THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AROUND SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS. IT'S PRIOR TO THAT, IT'S BEEN REGULARLY INVOKED. I THINK IS AN EXTRA TWO MINUTES. THEY HAVE TO BE ON A LIST EFFECTIVELY.
04:16:26.960: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY.
04:16:28.495: >> Chair Mills: PERSONALLY LIKE -- YEAH.
04:16:29.963: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THAT'S FINE. I JUST DID NOT KNOW THE BACKGROUND. AND I DON'T THINK I HAVE SEEN IT. AND I WAS LIKE, WHY?
04:16:42.075: >> Chair Mills: IT DEPENDS ON WHERE TH PROJECT IS. BORIS YELTSIN, GOING BACK TO WHETHER OR NOT TO A -- BRETT, GOING BACK TO WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW THE PETITIONER TO HAVE A REBUTTAL, DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A MOTION FROM US TO STRIKE THAT? DID YOU READ OUR BODY LANGUAGE ENOUGH TO SUGGEST?
04:17:04.731: >> Planning Manager:  NO, I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE A MOTION BECAUSE IT'S COMING BAC FOR THAT KIND OF POINT OF THIS. AFTER WE'RE DONE, I JUST WANT TO SUMMARIZE I HAVE GOT ANY AND ALL CHANGES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE. BUT NO, I DON'T NEED A SPECIFIC MOTION OTHER THAN THE POSTPONEMENT AND CONFIRMATION THAT I HAVE GOT THE CHANGES YOU WANT TO SEE IN IT.
04:17:25.419: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE NOTED? OKAY. SO --
04:17:34.294: >> Planning Manager:  I GUESS WE ARE THERE.
04:17:36.797: >> Chair Mills: THE MOTION IS NOT A POSTPONEMENT. IT'S WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS
