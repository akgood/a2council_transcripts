00:02:12.635: >> Chair Milshteyn: ANY DISCUSSION OR CHANGED BY THE AGENDA?
00:02:15.638: >> Planning Manager:  JUST NOTE ONE -- WE PLACE THE SOLAR UDC AMENDMENTS AS UNFINISHED BUSINESS. YOU DIDN'T DISFU DISCUSS THERM E THEY WERE THE FIRST MEETING THAT HAD TO BE RESCHEDULED BECAUSE OF THE COVID ORDER. THAT'S WHY IT'S APPEARING THAT WAY.
00:02:35.324: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANKS. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE AGENDA? SEEING NONE, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. THE AJEN AGENDA IS PROVED. BEFORE US THIS EVENING, WE HAVE THE APRIL 21st, 2020, MEETING MINUTES DO. WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THEM? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS.

MOVING ON TO REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE WILL BEGIN WITH COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN WITH A REPORT FROM CITY COUNCIL. PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:03:30.979: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR. CITY COUNCIL HAD A LONG AGENDA THAT WE MOVED THROUGH WITH GREAT HASTE, BUT PRUDENCE IN RESPONSIBILITY. FIRST A SET OF REZONINGS ARE RELEVANT TO THIS BODY. WE REZONED A SINGLE FAMILY TOWNSHIP PARCEL, ABOUT A HALF ACRE TO R1A AT 715 HEATHER WAY. IT WAS A VOLUNTARY ANNEXATION. WE ALSO REZONED JUST OVER AN ACRE OF LAND ON EAST EISENHOWER TO BECOME NEW PARKLAND. WE DID THE SAME WITH 16 ACRES ON DHU VARREN ROAD, THE BUTTON BUSH NATURE AREA, AS WELL AS 1.5 ACRES ON SOUTH MAPLE. AND TWO ACRES ON DYLAN DRIVE, THE HICKORY NATURE AREA. 25 ACRES, A HUGE ADDITION ON GREEN ROAD, IN ADDITION TO THE OAKWOODS NATURE AREA. AND FINALLY, JUST UNDER HALF AN ACRE ON -- OH, AND I'M SORRY -- THAT WAS ALL OF THE ADDITIONS TO OUR PARKLAND AND ANNEXATIONS. WE ALSO HAD BEFORE US THE REZONING AND SITE PLAN OF THE GARNET, HOWEVER, WE POSTPONED THAT TO LINE UP THE REZONING AND SITE PLAN ON THE SAME AGENDA. WITH RESPECT TO KIND OF THE CITY'S EMERGENCY COVID RESPONSE. TWO ITEMS OF RELEVANCE TO THIS BODY, THE FIRST IS THAT THE CITY RELEASED $250,000 TO SUPPORT THE COUNTY AND SHELTERS THAT WORK TO PROVIDE HOMELESS SHELTERING THAT ALSO RESPECTS THE NEEDS FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. AND THE SECOND IS CITY COUNCIL ALSO PASSED A RESOLUTION DIRECTING STAFF TO BEGIN FIRST A PILOT PHASE AND THEN A FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF ALLOWING STREET CLOSURES TO PROMOTE SAFE RECREATION ON STREETS SO THAT PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS HAVE MORE SPACE TO OPERATE FREELY IN OUR ROADWAYS. THEN FINALLY, RELEVANCE, THE SIDEWALK GAPS BEING FILLED, THAT I KNOW THIS BODY IS KEEN AND INTERESTED IN. A COUPLE ON BARTON DRIVE, ONE ON NIXON AND TRAVER AND ONE ON FULLER COURT. THAT IS EVERYTHING.
00:05:58.460: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US THIS EVENING IN.
00:06:03.565: >> Planning Manager:  SURE. A COUPLE OF BRIEF ITEMS WE HAVE SCHEDULED FOR THE MAY MAY 12th WORKING SESSION. WE WILL BE BRINGING CITY PLANNER JILL FASHER HAS TAKEN UP THE GAUNTLET OF THE OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE. SO WE WILL BRING THAT BACK FOR WORKING SESSION ON THE 12th. I ALSO WANT TO JUST LET THE PLANNING COMMISSION KNOW WE ARE ENTERING SORT OF A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S FLEXIBILITY WITH OPEN MEETINGS ACT IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE MORE QUICKLY THAN STAY AT HOME ORDER IS. AND SO I WILL KEEP YOU APPRISED AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH BOTH THE WORKING SESSION -- I EXPECT THE WORKING SESSION WILL STAY ON AS DIGITAL, BUT AFTER THAT, WE HAVE BEEN PUBLISHING MEETINGS TO BE HELD VIRTUALLY OR IN PERSON AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES PROVIDE FOR. THERE'S A SINGLE LOCATION ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN ALWAYS CHECK IN TO SEE WHAT THE STATUS OF THOSE MEETINGS ARE, IF THEY MOVE TO AN IN-AMERICAN MEETING, WE WILL BE CONDUCTING THOSE MEETINGS WITH EVERY CARE AND RESPECT. I WILL KEEP YOU A YOU APPRISED E GO INTO THE FUTURE DAYS OF THAT. BUT IT'S PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ON THE HORIZON.
00:07:27.082: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT.
00:07:27.916: >> Planning Manager:  AND THAT'S ALL.
00:07:29.384: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. PLANNING OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? DOES ANYONE HAVE A REPORT? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:07:34.823: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD UPDATE FOLKS THAT THE ORC DID MEET LAST TUESDAY, AND WE TALKED ABOUT TWO THINGS, PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND ALEXIS HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK KIND OF PUTTING SOME PROPOSALS FORWARD. I CAN'T BE WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS, IF IT'S GOING TO COME TO ALL OF US OR COME BACK TO ORC, BUT I THINK THERE'S LOT OF PR PROGRESS THERE. SHE DID A A GREAT JOB OF PUTTING ALL OF YOU ARE COMMENTS AND PUTTING THEM TOGETHER. AND THEN WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT A WHOLE LIST OF MINOR CHANGES TO THE UDC. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT THE END OF THE LAST MEETING, WHERE WE HEARD A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM PUBLIC COMMENT AND FROM COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN ABOUT THE -- THE ADUs AND THE SCRIVENER'S ERROR THAT HAPPENED FOR THE R2A ISSUE. THERE'S QUITE A LIST -- I DON'T KNOW, ABOUT A DOZEN -- OF THOSE SIMAR KIND OF THINGS. WE MET. IT LOOKS GOOD. I'M EXPECTING THAT WE WILL SEE THAT STUFF SOON.
00:08:45.527: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS? ALL RIGHT, SEEING NONE, WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE RECEIVED TWO ITEMS AND ONE CAME JUST WITHIN THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF OR SO. SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THAT CAME THROUGH VIA EMAIL FROM MIA. NOW WE MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS A TIME FOR ANYONE IN OUR AUDIENCE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, YOU WILL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS ANY SUBJECT THAT IS NOT ON OUR AGENDA FOR THIS EVENING. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEASE CALL 877-853-5247, AND ENTER MEETING ID 921-1722-6228. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND, ONE BY ONE, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF WHY YOU ARE PHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND TO INDICATE YOUR DESIRE TO SPEAK, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE COAST IS A -- THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE MAY HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS DO WE HAVE ANY AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION THIS EVENING?
00:10:23.225: >> Planning Manager:  THUS FAR NOBODY IS RAISING THEIR HANDS. LET'S JUST GIVE IT A FEW MOMENTS. NOPE. I  SEE NO INDICATION.
00:10:41.877: >> Chair Milshteyn: MOVING ON TO PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR OUR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:10:45.680: >> Planning Manager:  FOR THE NEXT MEETING MAY 19th, WE HAVE TWO PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED. FIRST IS FOR 2800 JACKSON ROAD HOTELS, THIS IS A REZONING AND SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THAT'S A PROPOSAL TO REZONE A -- APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF ACRE VACANT PARCEL FROM C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL AND CONSTRUCT TWO NEW HOTELS WITH ABOUT 133,000 SQUARE FEET OF NEW FLOOR AREA. AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER SCHEDULED PUBLIC HEARING TO CONSIDER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55, THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.24, TO UPDATE SIGNAGE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR.
00:11:30.725: >> Chair Milshteyn: VERY EXCITING! VERY EXCITING! I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT MEETING. MOVING ON TO UNFINISHED BUSINESS. THE FIRST ITEM BEFORE US IS 3611-3621 PLYMOUTH ROAD REZONING, SITE PLAN WITH PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, DRIVE THROUGH FACILITY FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. WE WILL BEGIN THIS WITH PETITIONER PRESENTATION. THEY WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A STAFF REPORT AND THEN AFTER THAT, WE WILL GO INTO PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION. I WILL LET THE PETITIONER START THEIR PRESENTATION AS THEY ARE ENTERING THE ROOM. I WILL GIVE THEM A QUICK MINUTE TO ENTER THE ROOM AND --
00:12:19.975: >> Planning Manager: ACTUALLY, I THINK THEY ALREADY PROVIDED A PRESENTATION WHEN THIS CAME BEFORE YOU PRIOR. I THINK ALEXIS IS PROBABLY JUST GOING TO SUMMARIZE WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH THE COMMISSION.
00:12:31.653: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. ALEXIS, GO AHEAD.
00:12:34.689: >> THANKS. I WILL SUMMARIZE AND CATCH EVERYONE UP TO SPEED. IF WE HAVE SIGNALS CROSSED AND THE PETITIONER'S TEAM WOULD LIKE TO ADD MORE, WE CAN TURN IT OVER TO THEM AND THEN I CAN TAKE IT BACK FOR MORE OF MY STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS. ALL GOING WITH THE FLOW. BUT AS MENTIONED, THIS IS THE PLYMOUTH MMG PLYMOUTH ROAD MIXED USE PROJECT. ITS A COLLECTION OF THREE PETITIONS. IT IS A COLLECTION OF THREE PETITIONS. FIRST, THERE IS A PETITION TO REZONE THE SITE, THE 4.5-ACRE SITE FROM PUD TO C3, FRINGE COMMERCIAL. THE SECOND IS A PROPOSED SITE PLAN, WHICH WILL DEMOLISH TWO OF THE EXISTING BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCT A SIX-STORY HAMPTON INN HOTEL AND REMODEL THE EXISTING RESTAURANT.
00:13:33.214: >> A NEW RESTAURANT AND THE -- AND WITH THAT SITE PLAN, THERE ARE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS TO ALLOW INCREASED HEIGHT AND TO INCREASE OR ELIMINATE THE FRONT MAXIMUM CELTBACSETBACKS FOR NEW BUILDIN. THIS'' SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPLICATION FOR A DRIVE THROUGH FACILITY ADDED TO THE REMODELED RESTAURANT. THIS COLLECTION OF PETITIONS WERE TABLED AT THE NOVEMBER 19th PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. RECOMMENDATION TO TABLE WAS PRIMARILY TO ALLOW THE PETITIONER ADDITIONAL TIME TO RESPOND TO OUTSTANDING ENGINEERING AND FORESTRY NATURAL RESOURCE LANDSCAPE COMMENTS. DURING THE COURSE OF THE DISCUSSION TWO, ADDITIONAL CONCERNS WERE RAISED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT FOCUSED ON THE LACK OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO THE ENERGY-CONSERVATIVE DESIGN AND THE LACK OF RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES. THE SITE PLAN HAS BEEN CHANGED. THE PARKING LOT AREA HAS BEEN REDESIGNED, INCREASING THE OPEN SPACE AND MORE SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED ABOUT THIS, THE SOLAR PANEL COVERAGE, BOTH THE HOTEL AND THE RENOVATED RESTAURANT. IF THE -- I WILL ASK THE PETITIONERS' TEAM IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE ME TO ADD A LITTLE BUILT MORE OR IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO ADD, OTHERWISE, I CAN MOVE INTO THE STAFF REPORT.
00:15:15.183: >> Planning Manager:  ALL SEEMS QUIET.
00:15:17.986: >> OKAY.
00:15:18.253: >> Planning Manager:  DO YOU WANT ME TO RUN THAT ALEXIS?
00:15:24.359: >> EITHER WAY, IT'S UP TO YOU. ALL RIGHT. PROBABLY GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO I REVIEWED THAT THIS IS THREE PETITIONS AND THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE THREE PETITIONS. NEXT SLIDE. AS A REFRESHER, THIS IS THE LOCATION OF THE SITE. WE ARE ON THE NORTH SIDE OF PLYMOUTH ROAD, JUST WEST OF THE 23 ON AND OFF RAMPS. THE FORMER SITE OF THE BIG BOY RESTAURANT AND THE RED ROOF INN. YEP, THE CURSOR IS POINTING TO THE SITE THIS IS AN AERIAL VIEW OF IT. NOW, IT -- THE SITE HAS TWO PARCELS TO IT. THE RED ROOFS ARE THE RED ROOF INN, HAD THE WHITISH ROOF IS THE BIG BOY RESTAURANT WHICH IS ALMOST CONNECTED TO THE RED ROOF INN. NOW THESE LOOK LIKE TWO BUILDINGS, BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY FOUR BUILDINGS DOWN THIS. THERE ARE TWO PAIRS OF BUILDINGS THAT ARE CONNECTED AND SORT OF APPEAR TO SHARE A ROOF. NEXT SLIDE. SO THIS IS ALSO IN THE STAFF REPORT. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE CHANGES TO THE SITE PLANS ON THE LEFT SIDE IS THE PREVIOUS LAYOUT THAT WAS PRESENTED IN NOVEMBER. THEN WITH THE RED SCRIBBLE ON IT, THAT'S THE HIGHLIGHTED AREA THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED. ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS THE PROPOSED SITE PLAN BEFORE YOU FOR CONSIDERATION. OUTLINED IN YELLOW IS THE NEW CURB LINE. YOU CAN SEE IT'S FARTHER BACK FROM THE SERVICE DRIVE AND A HILL BIT OF A SIDEWALK AREA WAS ADDED WITH SOME SEATING. SO THEY HAVE LOST A FEW PARKING SPACES, GAINED SOME OPEN SPACE AND A LITTLE TINY BIT OF AMENITY AREA. THE -- THEY HAVE LOST MORE IMPERVIOUS SURFACE THAN PARKING SPACES DUE TO THE INEFFICIENT DESIGN OF THE AREA CURRENTLY. SO WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF BANG FOR OUR BUCK WITH THIS CHANGE. FOR THE NEXT SLIDE, AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, PART OF THE REASON IT WAS TABLED WAS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION JUSTIFICATIONS. AS BEFORE, THERE IS INCREASED OPEN SPACE. NONE IS REQUIRED IN THE C3 DISTRICT. THEY ARE PROPOSING A MINIMUM OF 30% OPEN SPACE TO BE MAINTAINED. THEY HAD ALSO MENTIONED SOLAR ORIENTATION AND ENERGY CONSERVING DESIGN, BUT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT VAGUE. THEY HAVE GONE -- THEY HAVE WORKED WITH THEIR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS AND THEY CAN COMMIT TO 45% OF THE HOTEL ROOF AREA BEING COVERED WITH SOLAR PANELS AND 25% OF THE RESTAURANT ROOF AREA BEING COVERED. WE HAVE INCLUDED THESE DETAILS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. IT IS HARD TO ENFORCE AND MONITOR HOW MUCH KILOWATT HOURS THAT ARE BEING PRODUCED AND USED, ET CETERA, BUT WE CAN ENFORCE THE PERCENTAGE AND SQUARE FEET THAT IS COVERED. SO THAT IS THE DETAIL THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN THE STAFF REPORT FOR THIS PROJECT. THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW OF THE POWERPOINT PART. I WILL REFER BACK TO THE STAFF REPORT AND MENTION THAT OUR PREVIOUS STAFF REPORT WHICH IS ATTACHED TO TODAY'S STAFF REPORT DESCRIBED AND ANALYZED THE REZONING PETITION. WE ALSO WENT THROUGH A REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SITE PLAN, INCLUDING DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION, AND AS WELL AS THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE ANALYSIS FOR THE DRIVE THROUGH WINDOW. I WON'T GO INTO THEM TONIGHT FOR BREVITY, BUT I CAN IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS THAT ARISE. THE OUTSTANDING COMMENTS IDENTIFIED BY STAFF AND ENGINEERING AND IN FORESTRY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED WITH THIS PROPOSED SITE PLAN NUMBER SEVEN AND SO STAFF, WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF ALL THREE PETITIONS, INCLUDING THEIR EXTRA BITS, MEANING THE REZONING PETITION, WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THE SITE PLAN AND PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, THE PROPOSED MOTIONS IN THE STAFF REPORT CONTAIN A FEW BASIC CONDITIONS FOR THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS, IF I CAN, AND ALSO AS YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE, THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS HERE. I BELIEVE THEY CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS AS WELL.
00:20:35.236: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PLYMOUTH ROAD APPLICATION. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247 AND ENTERING MEETING ID 921-1722-6228. THE INFORMATION IS ALSO DISPLAYED ON THE VI AGENDA AND E VIDEO FEED. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND AFTER DIALING INTO THE MEETING, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING PLEASE MOVE TO A A QUOTE AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION AND BACKGROUND SOUNDS. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS.
00:21:32.326: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE ONE INDICATING INTEREST. HELLOHELLO CALLER, 711.
00:21:47.575: >> MY NAME IS WENDY C CARMAN ANI LIVE IN THE ORCHARD HILLS SUBDIVISION, A LITTLE OVER A MILE FROM THIS PROPERTY AND IN GOOD WEATHER, I WALKED TO SITE REGULARLY. IN 1978, THE BOGUS FAMILY SOLD THIS PART OF THE FARM AND IT WAS ZONED PUD. THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS ALLOWED ONLY A FURNITURE STORE, ABOUT 35,000 SQUARE FEET OF MOTEL SPACE, AND A SIT DOWN RESTAURANT. THIS WAS MEANT TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF TRIPS AT A REASONABLE LEVEL. STILL ALLOWING THE OWNERS TO PROFIT FROM THE CLOSENESS TO THE FREEWAY. ALTHOUGH WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT LEFT TURNS OUT OF THE SITE, THE TRAFFIC COMPLIMENTS THE ROAD WITH A SHADOW OF WHAT IT IS TODAY AND THE PLAN WAS TO ENCOURAGE THOSE GOING EAST TO EXIT ON TO GREEN ROAD FIRST. AS YOU KNOW, C3 ALLOWS MANY USES AND COMBINED RIGHT BEFORE STORIES AND HAVE 200% FAR. THE ZONING PROPERTY TO C3 GIVES THE OWNER A BLANK CHECK TO DO ANYTHING THAT IS ALLOWED IN C3, NOT JUST WHAT YOU WOULD SEE ON THE PLAN TODAY. WE SHOULD NOT SACRIFICE SAFETY TO GIVE THE DEVELOPERS THAT MUCH FLEXIBILITY. FROM 2015, THE PUD AND ITS RESTRICTIONS WERE UPENDED TO ALLOW THE WESTERN BUILDING TO BE ZONE FOR PLUM MARKET, THE NEIGHBORHOOD SUPPORTED THE CHANGE, PROBABLY NOT REALIZING THAT THE ZONING WOULD CHANGE AT THE SAME TIME. I PERSONALLY LIKED PLUM MARKET AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FINE IF THEY COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO HANDLE THE TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF THE SITE. PROBLEMSTHAT WAS A MISTAKE BECAUSE PROBLEMS WITH INGRESS AND EGRESS IS A PROBLEM. THERE ARE ALREADY DAYS WHEN THE DRIVEWAY OF GREEN ROAD HAS SEVERAL LARGE TRUCKS AND FANS BLOCKING THE DRIVE AND A FEW DAYS WHEN DELIVERY STRUCKS WHERE THEY IS PARKED IN THE CENTER LANE OUT IN PLYMOUTH ROAD. THE DRIVEWAY FROM GREEN USED FOR TRUCK DELIVERIES ALSO COMPETES WITH THE CVS DRIVE UP WINDOW AND THE ENTRANCE TO THE NEIGHBORING MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDING. HOW CAN WE AP ALLOW MORE DELIVEY TRUCKS WITH THE SAME DRIVEWAY. HOW CAN WE CONTEMPLATE WHAT A2ZERO IS SUGGESTING AND HAVE ANY MORE DRIVE UP WINDOWS. HOW DO WE MANDATE THE I NEED FOR LEFT-HAND TURNS ACROSS HEAVY TRAFFIC THIS NEEDS TO BE RETHOUGHT. WE NEED TO FIND A PLAN THAT WILL LIMIT THESE PROBLEMS I'M NOT SAYING PROPERTY SHOULDN'T BE UPGRADED OR THERE SHOULDN'T BE A HOTEL, BUT I AM SAYING THAT NOT ALL C3 USES OR THEIR DENSITY ARE REASONABLE ON THIS SITE. I'M SAYING THAT THE SITE CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUCK TRAFFIC IT CURRENTLY HAS, THAT THE TRAFFIC --
00:24:28.803: >> Planning Manager:  30 MORE SECONDS.
00:24:30.471: >> IT'S ALREADY A PROBLEM AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE RECOMMENDING C3 WITHOUT AN ENFORCEABLE PLAN TO PREVENT EVER INCREASING TRIPS TO THE SITE. THANK YOU.
00:24:42.750: >> Planning Manager:  THANK YOU.
00:24:47.355: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING MISSION? COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS PETITION? [ TELEPHONE RINGING ]
00:25:07.975: >> Planning Manager:  SORRY ABOUT THAT. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE INDICATING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK.
00:25:12.213: >> Chair Milshteyn: SEEING NOBODY ELSE, I WILL CLOSE THIS PUBLIC HEARING AND WE HAVE THREE MOTIONS HERE. DOES ANYONE OPPOSE TAKING UP THE THREE MOTIONS ALL TOGETHER? ALL RIGHT. I SEE ONE HAND OPPOSING IT. SO I WILL LET'S START WITH THE FIRST AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE SECOND AND THE THIRD. IF THAT ORDER IS OKAY WITH EVERYONE. FIRST MOTION BEFORE US, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE MMG PLYMOUTH ROAD MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT REZONING FROM PUD TO C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL. WILL I HAVE A COMMISSIONER WHO WILL MOVE THAT?
00:25:54.655: >> MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:26:00.294: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO COMMISSIONER BRIGGS FOR ACTUALLY HAVING US TAKE THESE SEPARATELY. I'M GUESSING IT'S ABOUT THE DRIVE THROUGH AND I THINK THAT'S A WORTH WHILE CONVERSATION TO HAVE SEPARATELY. SO THANK YOU. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO UNDERSTAND THE TRAFFIC PATTERNS IN RESPONSE TO MS. CARMAN'S COMMENTS. THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION HAS MOVED MOST OF ITS TENANTS AND CLIENTS FROM THE DELONIS CENTER DOWNTOWN TO THE RED ROOF INN FACILITY FOR EMERGENCY SHELTER DURING THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC TO PROVIDE FOR, YOU KNOW, GREATER DISTANCING BETWEEN THEIR CLIENTS. WHO ARE WITHOUT HOMES. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF PROJECT TIME LINE AND ANY IMPACT TO THE SHELTER ASSOCIATIONS PLANS? I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE AND CERTAINLY FOR THE NONPROFIT PARTNERS.
00:27:12.433: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, I DO NOT HAVE AN UPDATE RECORDING THAT. I DO KNOW OF THE OVERALL PROJECT, ONLY ONE. TWO BUILDINGS OR ONE PAIR OF THE TWO WILL BE DEMOLISHED. THE OTHER WILL REMAIN OPEN AND STANDING. THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS HERE. THEY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE AND I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION TO SEE WHAT CONVERSATIONS THEY HAVE HAD WITH RED ROOF INN MANAGEMENT.
00:27:38.659: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. GREAT. IT LOOKS LIKE MR. BUTLER, SOMEONE FROM HIS TEAM MIGHT HAVE A MUTE. THEY MAY BE ON MUTE.
00:28:00.114: >> Planning Manager:  THEY ARE NOT.
00:28:01.916: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN THEY DIAL INTO THE PUBLIC NUMBER.
00:28:06.420: >> Planning Manager:  IF YOU CAN ALL THE NUMBER. ALEX, DO YOU WANT TO READ THE NUMBER AND THE MEETING ID AND THEY CAN CALL IN.
00:28:14.361: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES. SO THE KNOWN NUMBER IS 877-853-5247. AND THEN THE MEETING ID IS 921-1722-6228.
00:28:38.652: >> Planning Manager:  HAVE THEM -- ASK THEM TO RAISE THEIR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE.
00:28:51.899: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND THEN IF YOU CAN RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE.
00:29:05.746: >> I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S ON HERE TWICE. LIKE, HE IS STILL LISTED AS AN ATTENDEE. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S LIKE THE PHONE PART OF IT.
00:29:23.063: >> Chair Milshteyn: OH, SOMEBODY HAS RAISED THEIR HAND.
00:29:43.350: >> Planning Manager: MR. BO BUTLER IS THAT YOU WITH E PHONE NUMBER ENDING 090.
00:29:52.393: >> YES.
00:29:52.660: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
00:29:53.661: >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR US?
00:29:54.895: >> Planning Manager:  YEP.
00:29:56.030: >> THIS WE GO! SORRY, WE WERE TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION FOR A WHILE, AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE ON MUTE. WE APOLOGIZE K. ANYBODY HEAR US NOW? I HEARD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE SHELTER HOUSING PEOPLE WITH COVID AT OUR HOTELS AND I THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER QUESTION AT THE TIMELINE. SO, YES, WE ARE HOUSING -- WE ARE HOUSING FOR THE WASHTENAW COUNTY, CORRECT, AND THE TIMELINE RIGHT NOW IS KIND OF UP IN THE AIR, BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING. WE WANT -- I THINK OUR PERMITTING PROCESS WILL BE -- I THINK YOUR APPROVAL -- IF YOU APPROVE US, IT'S TWO YEARS BEFORE WE HAVE TO COME BACK TO YOU FOLKS IF WE DO NOT GET A PERMIT AND START. SO WE ARE LOOKING WITHIN THAT TIME LINE TO START ONCE WE SECURE OUR FINANCING AND KIND OF GET A GRASP ON HOW THE SITUATION IS THESE DAYS. WE WILL HOPEFULLY BREAK GROUND BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD WHERE THIS PLAN IS ASSUMED. THAT'S THE BEST ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU RIGHT NOW.
00:31:04.331: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WHAT TYPE OF COORDINATION OR COLLABORATION WOULD YOU PLAN WITH THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THESE TIMELINES AND CAN PLAN ACCORDINGLY? THE LOGISTICS OF MOVING 75 PEOPLE WHO NEED SERVICES IS TOUGH.
00:31:18.379: >> SO WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THEM ON A WEEKLY BASIS. RIGHT NOW THEY TELL US THEY WANT IT TO MAY 15th. WE TOLD THEM THEY CAN HAVE FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIKE AND AS MANY ROOMS AS YOU WANT. ERRWE ARE NOT IN A HURRY. WE ARE TAKING A FINANCIAL HIT BECAUSE OF WHAT RED ROOF INN CORPORATION IS DOING TO US. WE EXTENDED OUT TO MAY MAY 15th AND WE TOLD THEM TO LET US KNOW. WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO OBLIGE. WE HAVE OTHER HOTELS IN THE AREA THAT WE CAN SERVICE THEM TO, STILL IN WASHTENAW COUNTY AND THEY SEEM TO BE INDICATE WITH THAT.
00:31:59.353: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. MR. LENART?
00:32:02.056: >> Planning Manager:  I JUST WANT TO -- MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING WITH COUNTY STAFF IS THAT RED ROOF HAS BEEN -- (INAUDIBLE) -- IF IT'S HELPFUL TO PROVIDE THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO COORDINATE WITH THE COUNTY AND PROVIDE SORT OF A SUMMARY, SHOULD THAT ADVANCE TO CITY COUNCIL. SO THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AS WELL.
00:32:28.215: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT WOULD BE GOOD. AND I THINK WE WOULD BE VERY -- WE WOULD ENCOURAGE OUR COLLEAGUES.
00:32:35.956: >> WE ARE ALSO KEEPING UP ONE OF THE BUILDINGS THAT IS NOT GETTING DEMOLISHED. SO THAT CAN BE SERVICED FOR THEM, SHOULD THEY NEED IT IN THE YEARS FROM NOW. WE ARE ONLY KNOCKING DOWN THE BUILDING THAT O ONES PERPENDICUR ROAD AND NOT THE ONE THAT RUNS HORIZONTAL TO THE ROAD. THAT'S 52 ROOMS, I BELIEVE.
00:32:56.977: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT'S REASSURING, BUT MR. LENART, IF YOU COULD NAIL DOWN SOME DETAILS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PERSPECTIVE, JUST FOR OUR REASSURANCE, BECAUSE WE DID JUST LAST NIGHT, INVEST $250,000 IN SUPPORTING THIS. SO THAT WOULD BE REALLY APPRECIATED. THANKS. THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS FOR ME FOR NOW. I WAS ENCOURAGED TO SEE WHAT HAS MOVED IN THE LAST MONTHS. I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR COLLEAGUE'S REFLECTIONS AS WELL.
00:33:27.107: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
00:33:35.449: >> THERE WAS A TRAFFIC STUDY THAT WAS MADE. WE DID SUBMIT A TRAFFIC STUDY.
00:33:41.054: >> IT WAS DONE BY BERGRUN AND REVIEWED BY THE CITY.
00:33:45.659: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER MILLS, DID I SEE YOUR HAND? YES, COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:33:51.698: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANKS. SO THIS FIRST ONE IS SPECIFICALLY ON THE REZONING AND I'M DEFINITELY I TAKE THE POINT OF THE CALLER IN TERMS OF LIKE ONCE YOU REZONE IT, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TIED TO THE SPECIFIC SITE PLAN. I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING FOR US TO TALK ABOUT AND WHETHER THE ZONING, OVERALL, IF WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT BECAUSE FUTURE THINGS MIGHT NOT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS IF -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS UP IN THE AIR RIGHT NOW. AND THAT ZONING DECISION STICKS WITH THE LAND AND NOT NECESSARILY THIS SITE PLAN. ONE THE THINGS THAT I COULDN'T FIND NECESSARILY THAT MAYBE I'M LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE IN THE STAFF REPORT, ALEXIS, IS OFTEN -- HOW THE FAR KIND OF COMPARES TO WHAT IS ALLOWED HERE VERSUS WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER C3, VERSUS HOW MUCH BASED ON SITE PLAN THAT WE ARE SEEING IS ACTUALLY WHAT THE FAR IS OF THE SITE PLAN COMPARED TO WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED IN C3 TOTAL.
00:35:06.573: >> THANKS. I HAD TO UNMUTE MYSELF. THE SITE HAS CURRENTLY 12% FAR. IT'S PROPOSED TO BE 47%. AND AS YOU MAY KNOW, C3 ALLOWS UP TO 200%.
00:35:25.626: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANK YOU. SO PRESUMABLY, THAT'S QUITE A BIG DIFFERENCE. SO MUCH MORE COULD BE BUILT ON THIS SITE IN THE FUTURE. THE BUILDING THAT RUNS EAST WEST THAT IS CURRENTLY STAYING COULD THEN BE REDEVELOPED ACCORDING TO THE C3 OVERALL ZONING IN THE FUTURE; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:35:56.723: >> YES, IT COULD BE, WITH A SITE PLAN BEING THINGS ARE SUBJECT TO REDEVELOPMENT.
00:36:02.262: >> Vice Chair Mills: RIGHT. AND SO THE ONE COMFORT, I THINK THAT WE HAVE IS THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS WOULD REQUIRE RELOOKING, IF THERE'S MORE EFFECTIVELY BUILT THERE. THERE WOULD NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL PARKING AND AT SOME POINT YOU WILL RUN OUT OF SPACE FOR THAT. OFTEN A CONCERN OF NEIGHBORS IS WITH ADDITIONAL FLOOR AREA, RIGHT, THERE'S MORE ACTIVITY THERE, AND SO THERE IS ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC. BUT ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGE WOULD REQUIRE A TRAFFIC STUDY. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY, YOU KNOW, REZONING TO C3 IN MY MIND, ISN'T LIKE UNLEASHING -- MAKING A FREE-FOR-ALL FOR EFFECTIVELY WHAT HAPPENS THERE. SURE, THERE ARE A LOT OF USES THAT COULD BE ALLOWED BY RIGHT, BUT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO COMING BACK AND DOING ADDITIONAL SITE PLANNING, AND ALL OF THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH TRAFFIC STUDIES. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY -- WOULD BE EFFECTIVELY A LARGE DEVELOPMENT THERE THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE TRAFFIC STUDIES?
00:37:15.202: >> NO THE ONLY THING I WAS GOING TO SAY -- I WAS GOING TO SAY THE ONLY THING I COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF IS IF SOMEHOW THEY ARE ABLE TO RENOVATE THE EXISTING BUILDINGS, WHATEVER THEY ARE, BE TODAY OR TOMORROW. RENOVATE THE EXISTING BUILDINGS INTO A PERMITTED USE, AND WOULDN'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THE SITE PLAN PROCESS. HOWEVER, EVEN IF YOU DON'T THROUGH THE SITE PLAN PROCESS, YOU STILL NEED TO DO ZONING COMPLIANCE AND THAT INCLUDES A CHECK OF THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS SO MOST EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT WILL BE A REAL CHANGE OF USE, MEANING APPLES TO ORANGES WOULD TRIGGER EITHER SITE PLAN OR THE FULL REVIEW OF MEETING CURRENT CODE.
00:38:11.458: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I THINK IT'S GOOD TO THINK THROUGH LIKE WHAT -- I OFTEN THINK OF LIKE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND I FEEL LIKE THE CHALLENGE WITH THINKING ABOUT WORST CASE SCENARIO AND REZONING IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT WORST CASE SCENARIO IN MIND. BUT I THINK OFTEN WHAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL DRIVE ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC. THIS IS A PLACE THAT IS LITERALLY RIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY. RIGHT? LIKE, YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THAT. AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT PLACE FOR -- FOR THIS ZONING IN PARTICULAR AND SO I'M NOT -- I OFTEN -- I THINK THAT H THAT'S A HELPFUL THING TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT ELSE COULD BE HERE IN THE FUTURE IF WE REZONE IT AND THIS DOESN'T GET BUILT, BUT I THINK THAT THAT ZONING ACTUALLY FITS HERE. SO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS.
00:39:20.460: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
00:39:22.295: >> Commissioner Abrons: THANKS, I FOUND COMMISSIONER MILLS' PERSPECTIVE IN HOW I MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT. IT SEEMS LIKE THE PARCELS THAT THE C3 IS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING FOR THE PARCELS BUT THE ZONING OF THE PARCEL DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INGRESS AND THE EGRESS. SO LIKE, WHAT IS ADJACENT TO IT MAY MAKE SENSE, BUT IF THERE'S ONE POINT OF ACCESS THAT IS TOO NARROW TO ALLOW TRAFFIC IN AND OUT, THAT WOULD NOT BE TAKEN UP IN ZONING IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE. I WAS WONDERING MAYBE STAFF COULD EDUCATE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE TRAFFIC STUDY ITSELF. IN MY TIME ON THE COMMISSION, I HAVEN'T SEEN A TRAFFIC STUDY WHICH ESSENTIALLY INDICATED THAT THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS -- THAT WAS PROHIBITIVE OF THE DEVELOPMENT, LIKE, THAT SAID THIS SITE CANNOT ACCOMMODATE THIS DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC. I WONDERED, DOES THAT HAPPEN OR LIKE, WHAT ARE THE HUE  HOW MIGE MITIGATE THAT IF THE THING THAT WAS GOING TO BE HERE WOULD PRODUCE AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC?
00:40:40.440: >> I CAN MOSTLY ADDRESS THAT. THERE'S A TRAFFIC STUDY. OUR TRAFFIC STUDY ANALYZES THE NEW TRI TRIPS AND THE TRIP DISTRIBUTIONS. ALSO A SIDE KN NOTE I'M NOT A TRAFFIC ENG NEARING, BUT I PLAY ONE ON ZOOM. THEY ARE TRIGGERED WHEN A PROPOSED PROJECT WILL -- HAS MORE THAN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TRIPS IN THE PEAK HOUR. I BELIEVE IT'S 50 TRIPS IN A PEAK HOUR. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT THRESHOLD, THEN YOU MUST SUBMIT A TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY. OUR TRAFFIC ENGINEERS LOOK AT IT AND, YOU KNOW, STILL THE BEDROCK OF TRAFFIC ENGINEERING IS LEVEL OF SERVICE. AND HOW LONG ARE VEHICLES WAITING AT INTERSECTIONS. OUR CHARACTER ENGINEERS ARE GETTING BETTER AND ARE DEFINITELY MOVING TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF IT'S NOT HOW LONG OUR VEHICLE IS WAITING AT INTERSECTIONS. IT'S HOW ARE ALL MODES OF TRAFFIC GETTING AROUND BUT THE BEDROCK OF A TRAFFIC STUDY IS A LEVEL OF SERVICE. SO IT LOOKS AT THE CURRENT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AT ALL OF THE NEARBY INTERSECTIONS. IT AND IT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT BACKGROUND TRAFFIC WHICH IS NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE WHOLE AREA, AND THAT ADDED IN THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT PROPOSED IN PARTICULAR. AND THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC GENERATED FROM THIS BIGGER NEWER HOTEL AND THE NEW RESTAURANT BUT THERE'S ALREADY SO MUCH TRAFFIC THAT IT'S NOT REALLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT OR YOU WOULDN'T REALLY NOTICE THAT ADDITIONAL SECONDS OF DELAY OR, I GUESS, IT MIGHT BE FRACTIONS OF A SECOND COMPOUNDED. MOST OF THE TRAFFIC CONCERNS I HEARD TONIGHT REVOLVE NOW AROUND THE HOTEL. THE RED ROOF INN HOTEL OR EVEN PERHAPS THE PROPOSED HOTEL BUT SOME OF THE EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH LOADING. AND THAT IS PROBABLY A FUNCTION OF LAYOUT OF ANOTHER SITE THAT IS ADJACENT AND USES THE SAME PRIVATE STREETS AND SAME DRIVEWAYS AS THIS ONE. YOUR OTHER COMMENT, I FEEL LIKE IT WAS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. I FEEL LIKE THEY DID DENY A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC CONDITIONS ON NORTH MAIN STREET. YOU USUALLY IT DOESN'T GET TO THIS POINT WHERE THE PLANNING COMMISSION OR COUNCIL HAVE TO DENY A PROJECT BECAUSE OF THE LAYOUT BECAUSE STAFF, WE WORK WITH THOSE DEFINE PROFESSIONALS AND WE SAY, HEY, YOUR LAYOUT DOESN'T WORK. WE WILL NEVER LET YOU GET FARTHER -- WE WON'T LET YOU GO UNTIL YOU FIX THE CIRCULATION ISSUE. AND THEN SOMETIMES WE GET A TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY THAT SAYS, YEP, HORRIBLE IMPACTS AND THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO, BUT AS A COMMUNITY WE SOMETIMES PUSH BACK AND WE SAY, TO FIX THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM MEANS TO WIDEN THE ROAD TO EIGHT LANES AND WE SAY THANK YOU, BUT, NO, THANK YOU, WE WILL KEEP OUR BAD LEVEL OF SERVICE.
00:44:08.348: >> I THINK ALEXIS DID A GREAT JOB OF RESPONDING TO THAT, AND I WOULD ADD A FOOTNOTE TO STARTING TO MAKE SURE WE ARE REALLY COMPREHENSIVELY LOOKING AT TRANSPORTATION. THERE ARE INHERENT TRADEOFFS IN THAT. IF WE ARE TO WIDEN THE STREETS AND PUT IN EXTREMELY LARGE APRONS AND DRIVE ACCESSES, THAT WILL FACILITATE LOADING AND VEHICULAR TRAVEL. IT WILL COMPROMISE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND AT TIMES MOTORIZED SAFETY. SO I THINK THEY DO A THOROUGH JOB. WE KNOW THAT THAT BALANCE AND THAT ASPECT OF SITE PLANS ARE A PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO THE YOU AS COMMISSIONERS AND THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY. SO WE WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE AS MANY OF THOSE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED AS WE POSSIBLY CAN.
00:45:01.234: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. I GUESS MY TAKEAWAY THEN IS THAT THE SITE PLAN HAS ALREADY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT EXISTING TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND IS DESIGNED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS IT CAN BE FOR THE EXPECTED TRAFFIC. AND THAT STAFF FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THAT'S BEEN DONE ESSENTIALLY, RIGHT? ON THE COMMISSION, WE OFTEN HEAR KIND OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERCEPTION BY NEIGHBORS OF CERTAIN PROBLEMS AND CONGESTION AND KIND OF WHAT THE TRAFFIC REPORT IS SAYING, RIGHT? THESE THINGS ARE SOMETIMES AT ODDS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO THINK THROUGH IT. THAT INFORMATION HELPS. THANKS.
00:45:52.452: >> Planning Manager:  AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT ALWAYS PERCEPTION. WE DEFINITELY EXPERIENCE CONGESTION IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY AND THAT'S PART OF THE BALANCE OF HOW WE RESPOND TO IT.
00:46:03.796: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND I WOULD NEVER ADVOCATE FOR WIDENING THE ROAD TO MITIGATE IT. I GUESS IT IS WHAT IT IS. I GUESS WE WILL COME TO THIS LATER. OBVIOUSLY THE DRIVE THROUGH WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO AUTOMOBILE TRAFFIC ON THIS SITE. IT'S SOMETHING WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THIS EVENING.
00:46:29.589: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:46:32.325: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IT WASN'T VERY CLEAR ON THE SITE, BECAUSE THEY DOESN'T DO A ZOOM OUT. IT COMES DOWN AND HITS PLYMOUTH ROAD BUT THEN IT ALSO CONNECTS THROUGH PAST THE PLUM MARKET AND THE CVS PHARMACY AND EXITS OUT ON TO GREEN ROAD, WHICH NOT FOR THE UNINITIATED. THAT'S NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE, BUT FOR SOMEBODY WHO DOES KNOW THE SITE, THERE ARE ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF WAYS OUT BESIDES THIS ONE THAT ARE MORE LAND LOCKED AND THERE DOES SEEM TO BE -- YOU KNOW, GREEN ROAD CAN GET BUSY TOO, BUT PLYMOUTH ROAD IS THE REAL CHALLENGE. SO AGAIN, IT'S NOT SHOWN IN THE SITE PLAN ANYWHERE BUT JUST PULLING IT UP ON GOOGLE MAPS, YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE KIND OF BACK WAYS OUT IN TERMS OF CONGESTION TOO.
00:47:28.247: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:47:30.717: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I CAN OFFER NEIGHBORHOOD PERSPECTIVE, I LIVE ABOUT A MILE FROM THE SITE. I KNOW THAT PLUM IS DOING BEST JOB OF ANY GROCERY STORE THAT I HAVE SEEN IN THIS AREA AT ALL THE SOCIAL DISTANCING SAFETY STUFF FOR GROCERY STORES. I HAVE BEEN TO THIS SITE AT VARIOUS TIMES OF THE DAY, AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BACKED UP TRYING TO GET BACK OUT ON TO GREEN ROAD. IT'S NARROW WHEN YOU TRY TO GO TO THE PLUM AND PASS IT TO THE PARKING LOT OF THE OLD BIG BOY, BUT I DON'T KNOW, I REALLY NEVER EXPERIENCED TERRIBLE ISSUES. I THINK MY ONE CONCERN IS -- AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER WITH THE DRIVE THROUGH, THE LEFT TURN OUT OF THE SITE TO A LEFT TURN IF THERE'S MORE CARS COMING IN AND OUT. EVEN WITH THAT AS A RESIDENT, I'M NOT SUPER CONCERNED WHAT THIS MIGHT DO WITH TRAFFIC, BASED ON WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH EXISTING TRAFFIC. AND I WOULD JUST BE HAPPY TO SEE SOMETHING DONE WITH THIS SITE. SO I WILL JUST SAY THAT FOR NOW ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES WITH THE TRAFFIC.
00:48:43.256: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT FURTHER DISCUSSION. IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE ON MOTION NUMBER ONE. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] AND MR. LENART, DO WE -- SHOULD WE TAKE A ROLL CALL ON THIS OR ARE YOU OKAY WITH A VOICE VOTE?
00:48:56.235: >> Planning Manager:  IT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE FOR A ROLL CALL WHEN WE DO TAKE ACTIONS ON THE PETITIONS.
00:49:09.749: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
00:49:12.018: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
00:49:13.719: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
00:49:14.287: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
00:49:14.821: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
00:49:16.589: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
00:49:22.261: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
00:49:22.862: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
00:49:23.563: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
00:49:25.264: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY. MOTION CARRIES.
00:49:27.400: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE SECOND MOTION, AND I WILL GO AHEAD AND READ THAT. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE MMG PLYMOUTH ROAD MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT SITE PLAN AND PLAN PROJECT MODIFICATIONS TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT TO 65 FEET 10 INCHES AND ELIMINATE THE MAXIMUM FRONT SETBACK REQUIRES FOR NEW BUILDINGS SUBJECT TO PROVIDING SOLAR ORIENTATION AND ENERGY-CONSEVENNING DESIGN BY MAINTAINING SOLAR PANELS COVERING A MAIN MUM OF 45% OF THE PROPOSED HOTEL AND 25% OF THE RENOVATED RESTAURANT ROOF SURFACE AND MAINTAINING A MINIMUM OF 30% OPEN SPACE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:50:31.264: >> Commissioner Briggs: LET'S SEE -- I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT I APPRECIATED THE MODIFICATIONS THAT WERE DONE. THEY SEEM MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH -- WITH WHAT I WOULD HAVE HOPED TO SEE FOR THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION AND SO I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHANGES.
00:50:52.585: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:50:53.519: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. A PROCESS QUESTION. WHAT -- A SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE FOR A DRIVE THROUGH WAS NOT PERMITTED IN THE NEXT MOTION, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE SITE PLAN?
00:51:12.605: >> THANK YOU.
00:51:14.106: >> I BELIEVE THAT -- I BELIEVE THE SITE PLAN CAN STAND WITHOUT THE USE. THEY WILL HAVE A USELESS DRIVEWAY. SO THEY MAY WANT TO COME BACK WITH -- IT WOULD BE AI SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION TO REARRANGE THE LAYOUT OF THE PARKING LOT. BUT THE -- JUST FROM A SITE PLAN PERSPECTIVE, IT FUNCTIONS WITHOUT THE WINDOW. IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A SEPARATE BUILDING.
00:51:44.003: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:51:51.143: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE ON THIS. ALL RIGHT. SO MR. LENART, IF YOU CAN DO ROLL CALL.
00:52:08.160: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
00:52:11.497: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
00:52:12.064: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
00:52:12.598: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
00:52:14.033: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
00:52:20.840: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
00:52:21.440: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
00:52:23.276: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
00:52:28.814: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
00:52:29.415: >> Planning Manager:  IT CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
00:52:31.417: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO MOTION NUMBER THREE, AND THIS IS A LONG ONE. THE NOMAR GARCIAPARRA CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION, FIND THE PETITION SUBSTANTIALLY MEETS THE STANDARDS IN CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.29.5, SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND THEREFORE APPROVES MMG PLYMOUTH ROAD MIXED USE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR ONE DRIVE THRU LANE AT THE FREE STANDING RESTAURANT. THIS APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS, ONE, THE PROPOSED USE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICT, WHICH ALLOWS COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES, ACCESSED PRIMARILY BY PERSONAL VEHICLES; TWO, THE SITE PLAN IS LOCATED ADJACENT TO A HIGHWAY AND ITS ACCESS RAMPS AND THE DRIVE THROUGH FACILITY IS MORE APPROPRIATE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO HIGHWAY ISES; THREE, THE PROPOSAL WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS BASED ON THE LOCATION. PLYMOUTH ROAD AND THE PRIVATE STREET NETWORK THROUGH THE SITE PROVIDE ADEQUATE ACCESS, AND THE PROPOSED FACILITY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SUR ROUNDING USES ON AND ADJACENT TO THE SITE. THE SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING, THE REZONING PETITION AND SITE PLAN WITH PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THIS? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS. AND WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:54:12.318: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH. SO I CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DRIVE THROUGH IN THIS LOCATION FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS. I THINK ONE IS ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE HIGHWAY. I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. I THINK THAT IT ENCOURAGES A LOT OF IN AND OUT TRAFFIC AND THE LOCATION THAT IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HEARD SOME PUBLIC COMMENT TONIGHT THAT SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS ABOUT -- ABOUT INCREASING -- ENCOURAGING MORE IN AND OUT TRAFFIC AT THAT LOCATION AND KIND OF CONFLICTS THAT ARE MAYBE ALREADY OCCURRING. WHEN I LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, WHAT OUR CRITERIA ARE FOR APPROVAL, THERE ARE A FEW -- A FEW POINTS THAT I THINK ARE CONDITIONS FOR NOT APPROVING. I MEAN, I DO THINK THAT WE AS A BODY SHOULD CONSIDER DRIVE THROUGHS IN GENERAL AND DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE ANYWHERE IN THE CITY, BUT ONE, YOU KNOW, WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE CITY MASTER PLAN. I THINK THE SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK, WHICH THERE ARE REASONS TO -- MULTIPLE REASONS TO THINK THAT IDLING AND INCREASED -- ENCOURAGING THAT SORT OF -- THIS SORT OF TRAFFIC MOVEMENTS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK. AND THEN YOU KNOW, WILL NOT BE -- THERE'S ANOTHER POINT WILL NOT BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE PEACE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR THE NEIGHBORHOOD AREA IN GENERAL. THIS IS ADJACENT -- THIS IS DRIVE THROUGH ADJACENT TO A HOTEL, WHERE WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT AIR QUALITY TO SOME DEGREE. I MEAN, I ALSO KNOW IT'S NEXT TO A HIGHWAY SO THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S CONSISTENT INTERNALLY IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT IT, BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY ENCOURAGING -- I THINK THERE'S REASONS TO QUESTION IT.
00:56:22.448: >> AND THEN WILL NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE REQUIREMENT, WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE CONCERNING WHETHER OR NOT DRIVE THROUGHS -- I THINK IT WILL HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT. FOR THOSE THREE REASONS I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH SUPPORTING IT. BUT I WILL LEAVE IT OPEN TO THE REST -- FOR YOU GUYS TO DISCUSS.
00:56:43.035: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
00:56:48.107: >> Commissioner Woods: I AM -- I ACTUALLY AM IN FA FAVOR OF IT, BECAUSE ACTUALLY, I THINK OUR MOST RECENT EXPERIENCES WITH THE WHOLE COVID PHENOMENA AND THE WAY THOSE THINGS ARE CHANGING SOME OF OUR LIFESTYLES LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT PERHAPS THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT IS BETTER TO HAVE SOMEONE IN A VEHICLE AND DOING A PICKUP OR SOMETHING FOR WHATEVER THEY ARE ORDERING FROM A BUSINESS OR IN THIS CASE A RESTAURANT, THAT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER SITUATION FOR OUR COMMUNITY IN GENERAL. SO -- SO THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF IT. ALSO, I KNOW RECENTLY ARE -- A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WE DISCUSSED ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A DRIVE T DRIVE THROUT WAS REQUESTED AND LATER ON, IN TALKING TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE, SOME FOLKS BROUGHT UP TO ME SOME SITUATIONS THAT I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT, IN TERMS OF PERSONS WHO MIGHT BE DRIVING WHO ARE EITHER DISABLED ORRIN ABLE O GET OUT AND GO INTO A BUSINESS AND GET WHAT THEY WANT AND THAT A DRIVE THROUGH AFFORDS THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY. I DON'T WANT TO DEBATE THE PROS AND CONS OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, BUT I WANTED TO INDICATE THAT THERE ARE CERTAINLY TIMES WHEN DRIVE THROUGHS MAY BE APPROPRIATE. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A DRIVE THROUGH IS APPROPRIATE, THIS CLOSE TO A HIGHWAY, MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE BETTER PLACES TO HAVE DRIVE THROUGHS, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BRING SO MUCH TRAFFIC DOWN INTO THE CITY AND INTO A LITTLE BIT FARTHER. I KNOW WHEN, YOU KNOW, IF -- SOMETIMES WHEN WE ARE TRAVELING, IT'S EASIER TO DO A PULL OFF AND GO INTO A LOCATION THAT HAS A DRIVE THROUGH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND NOT TO HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR AND TO KEEP -- BE ABLE TO KEEP MOVING. SO FOR THAT REASON, I ACTUALLY AM LEANING TOWARDS SUPPORTING THIS M PARTICULAR MOTION.
00:59:00.172: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:59:01.106: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR AND THANKS FOR THE CONSIDERATION AND DIALOGUE. I'M TORN AS WELL. I UNDERSTAND THE DRIVE THROUGHS HAVE A REAL POSITIVE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES, BEING DISABLED OR SINGLE PARENTS WHO ARE IN A RUSH AND NEED TO GET FOOD AND PANERA PRESENTS A HEALTHIER OPTION THAN A LOT OF FAST FOOD TAKEOUT AND DRIVE THROUGH, BUT, YOU KNOW, I KNOW, I THINK COMMISSIONER BRIGGS OUTLINES SOME IMPORTANT POINTS. WHAT ARE WE FR TRYING TO ENCOUR, ON THE SITE AND THROUGHOUT THE CITY. IF THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS FROM NEIGHBORS ABOUT TURNING MOVEMENTS IN AND OUT OF THIS FACILITIES THOSE WILL BE EXACERBATED BY INCENTIVIZING AND ENCOURAGING THESE KIND OF THE SHORT, TEN-MINUTE TRIPS, 15-MINUTE TRIPS TO THE DRIVE THROUGH AS OPPOSED TO THE LONGER STAY OF A DINE-IN OR TAKEOUT EXPERIENCE. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE -- THAT IMPACT IS HARD TO QUANTIFY, ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THE TRAFFIC STUDY DID. AND I INTO ED TO REVIEW IT MORE CLOSELY. BUT THE OTHER ELEMENTS ARE WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE CITYWIDE, WHICH IS TRYING TO -- TO INCENTIVIZE THROUGH BOTH CARROT AND STICK, YOU KNOW, A REDUCTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS AND TRANSPORTATION THROUGH SINGLE USER VEHICLES IS A HUGE ITEM FOR OR CARBON EMISSIONS CITYWIDE. THE ORIGINAL PUD WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THE EARLY '70s AND IT'S BEEN STANDING FOR ABOUT 50 YEARS NOW. AS WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO BE BUILDING FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS ON THIS SITE, YOU KNOW, IT -- IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, WITH OUR CARBON EMISSION GOALS, AS WELL AS JUST THE REALITIES OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE, THAT -- THAT HAVING 50 YEARS OF DRIVE THROUGH IS A GOOD IDEA. AND SO I'M TORN AS WELL. BUT LEANING TOWARDS NO.
01:01:11.537: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:01:19.111: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO I AM ALSO TORN. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE KIND OF MORE OF THE RESEARCH ON HOW THIS FACTORS INTO EMISSIONS, REALLY, BUT ALSO LIKE -- I FEEL LIKE NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR US TO BE DOING THAT, THAT THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS NEED TO -- IF WE ARE GOING TO BE BASING OUR DECISIONS ON HOW THIS FITS TO SUSTAINABILITY AND CARBON NEUTRALITY THEN I THINK THAT NEEDS TO GO INTO REEVALUATING DRIVE THROUGHS ENTIRELY. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT MY READING OF KIND OF THE -- [ NO AUDIO ] A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SAFETY AROUND THERE, AND I -- I FEEL LIKE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THIS PARTICULAR DRIVE THROUGH DEFINITELY DOES, LIKE, NOT GIVE CARS THE PRIORITY SO MUCH AND ACTUALLY PUSHES THEM TO THE SIDE. I TAKE INTO -- AND ALSO, TO COMMISSIONER WOODS' POINT ABOUT WHERE IN THE CITY, IF EVER THERE WAS A PLACE FOR DRIVE THROUGHS, RIGHT NEXT TO THE HIGHWAY OFF -- [ NO AUDIO ] SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT I KIND OF KEEP IN MY MIND. I THINK ONE OF THE POINTS THAT I HAVE ALSO SEEN IS WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY DRIVE THROUGHS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WHICH I THINK ALSO -- LIKE, MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT THE QUEUES ARE OFTEN QUITE LONG AND THAT WAS ALSO SOMETHING THAT A CALLER HAD RAISED OR MAYBE IT WAS IN OUR PACKETS. THINKING THROUGH KIND OF WHERE ALL OF THOSE CARS WOULD QUEUE, I THINK THERE IS ACTUALLY SPACE THAT'S AGAIN TUCKED INTO THE SITE. ITS NOT RIGHT OUT ON THE STREET. AND SO I'M NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRAFFIC IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THE CIRCLE DRIVE. WHAT I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF ABOUT IS HOW -- I WANT TO JUST VERIFY THAT THE -- THE ARRANGEMENT IS -- OR THE -- THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR THE DRIVE THROUGH IS PINNED TO THIS SITE PLAN. AND SO IT'S NOT JUST SAYING THAT THERE'S ALWAYS -- [ NO AUDIO ] OF USE COMES IN  OR A DIFFERENT SITE COMES IN THEY CAN'T PUT THE DRIVE THROUGH ON THE OTHER SIDE. IS THAT TRUE?
01:03:51.530: >> THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE WOULD RUN WITH THIS SITE PLAN AND THIS WOULD BE FOR THIS RESTAURANT. A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT COULD COME IN AND THEN USE THIS DRIVE THROUGH, BUT SAY A BANK, THAT'S A DIFFERENT USE AND THIS WOULD -- THIS -- I'M GOING TO CHECK THE STAFF REPORT AS WELL. BUT THIS IS FOR A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR A RESTAURANT'S DRIVE THROUGH. SO AS LONG AS IT MET THAT CRITERIA, AND ANY LAYOUT CHANGES WOULD NEED TO COME BACK AS WELL, BECAUSE IT IS TIED TO THIS SITE PLAN. BUT IT COULD -- IT COULD BE A -- TYPE OF --A DIFFERENT TYPE OF R.
01:04:37.309: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANKS. EVEN THOUGH I'M TORN, I'M LEANING TOWARDS SUPPORT. I THINK DRIVE THROUGHS IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE LOOK AT AGAIN. THIS ISING TO IS GOING TO CONTIO COME UP, I TOO HE WILL LIKE. AND I THINK IT WOULD HELP US REVIEW IT -- [ NO AUDIO ] NOT OVERALL.
01:05:08.440: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL? RIB I -- I AGREE. I THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE A POLICY LEVEL DISCUSSION AND NOT A SPECIFIC SITE DISCUSSION. AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO TAKE THIS ON AS A LARGER POLICY ISSUE. SO I THINK THAT WHEN YOU SUBMIT FOR THESE THINGS, IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, YEARS -- IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS, AND SO I THINK WHEN SOMEBODY FIRST COMES IN AND TALKS WITH STAFF, YOU KNOW, STAFF NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO LET THEM KNOW, LIKE, HEY, YOU GOT A HIGH BAR FOR DRIVE THROUGH IN THIS TOWN. I MEAN, THAT WAS PROBABLY NOT COMMUNICATED BECAUSE THAT ISN'T OUR POLICY. YOU KNOW? AND SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF LETTING THEM KNOW REALLY LATE IN THE GAME THAT WE ARE -- WE ARE CHANGING ON THEM. SO I -- IT'S STILL A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. I GET THAT, BUT I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO -- WE NEED TO HAVE THAT LARGER DISCUSSION AND I WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF HAVING THAT LARGER DISCUSSION BECAUSE I COMPLETELY BELIEVE IN THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE SAYING, COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. SO I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE BIGGER DISCUSSION ABOUT IT AND SO I WILL -- I WILL SUPPORT THIS, BECAUSE EVER THAT AND, AGAIN, I AGREE ALSO WITH WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID ABOUT IT BEING CLOSE TO THE HIGHWAY. I THINK IF IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, THEN IT MAKES SENSE THERE AND NOT DOWNTOWN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
01:06:35.360: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER ABRONS?
01:06:38.830: >> Commissioner Abrons:  JUST BRIEFLY WANTED TO SHARE AND SAY THAT I'M ALSO TORN. I KIND OF AGREE WITH ALL OF THE COMMENTS, BUT I THINK THIS LAST -- THIS LAST POINT ABOUT KIND OF THINKING -- TAKING THIS ON AT A HIGHER LEVEL AND NOT TAKING IT UP ON A AD HOC BASIS, ONE PROJECT HERE AND ONE PROJECT THERE, I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND GIVEN THAT WE RECENTLY DID APPROVE A DRIVE THROUGH FOR ANOTHER PROJECT, IT WOULD FEEL INCONSISTENT TO ME. I DON'T LOVE THE IDEA OF IT, BUT I PLAN TO VOTE FOR IT.
01:07:13.431: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT?
01:07:15.467: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I ALSO DON'T LOVE DRIVE THROUGHS. I AGREE IF THERE EVER WAS GOING TO BE ONE, THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE TO HAVE. IT ALSO AS MOTHER TWO OF SMALL CHILDREN, I CAN TOTALLY SEE HOW THEY CAN COME IN HANDY. MY CONCERN, I THINK -- AND I DON'T -- THIS IS NOT REALLY GOING TO SWAY ME ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ON THIS PERMIT IS AGAIN THE SAFETY ISSUE OF PEOPLE COMING FROM THE HIGHWAY BEING WANTING TO GO TO PANERA AND GOING THROUGH THE HIGHWAY AND NEEDING TO TURN LEFT BACK ON TO PLYMOUTH ROAD TO GET THERE. THROW AS I'M LOOKING AT THE SITE MAP, THE WAY THE DRIVE THROUGH COMES OUT KIND OF SPITS YOU BA K OUT, IT COULD TAKE YOU -- SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS MORE FOR STAFF S. IT EVER POSSIBLE TO DO LIKE A NO LEFT TURN ON TO PLYMOUTH FROM THAT DRIVEWAY? WHO WOULD MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IF IN THE FUTURE THIS JUST GETS TO BE SO POPULAR THAT THERE ARE TONS OF ACCIDENTS? IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE LOOKED AT AGAIN? LIKE, THIS WOULD BE VERY EASY PLACE WHERE YOU ARE JUST LIKE, HEY, IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK -- WHAT DIRECTION WOULD IT BE? IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO 23, YOU HAVE TO GO OUT TO GREEN AND DO THAT FIRST OR IF YOU WANT TO TURN RIGHT ON PLYMOUTH ROAD, THAT'S FINE. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IN THE FUTURE COULD COME UP? WHO WOULD LOOK AT THAT, IF THERE ARE POTENTIAL ISSUES THAT COULD COME UP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF SAFETY ISSUES THAT OCCUR BECAUSE OF WHAT IS GOING ON ON THIS SITE?
01:08:45.757: >> OUR CITY TRAFFIC ENGINEERS CAN RIGHT NOW WORK WITH -- AND I BELIEVE THAT THE -- THE LANDOWNERS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO AND RIGHTS TO THE CIRCLE DRIVE, THEY CAN PUT UP SIGNAGE NOW IF THEY WOULD LIKE. THE WAY FINDING OR, YOU KNOW, BEST WAY TO -- YOU KNOW, SORT OF LIKE -- I THINK THAT THE DDA IS PUTTING UP SIGNS LIKE GO THIS WAY TO GET DOWNTOWN. THEY CAN DO THAT TODAY. OUR TRAFFIC ENGINEERS ARE -- THEY ARE HEADED FOR OUR CITY STREETS AND I DO KNOW IF WARRANTED, THEY CAN HAVE TRAFFIC CONTROL RESTRICTIONS AT PLYMOUTH ROAD THAT PROHIBIT THE LEFTS AND I BELIEVE THAT PLYMOUTH IS NOT UNDER DOT JURISDICTION. SO IF WARRANTED OUR CITY TRAFFIC ENGINEERS CAN CONTROL MOVEMENT THERE AT PLYMOUTH ROAD. NOT ON THE CIRCLE DRIVE BECAUSE IT'S A PRIVATE ROAD, ALTHOUGH THEY CAN CONSULT AND HELP.
01:09:46.418: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. YEAH. I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER SHOPPING CENTER FURTHER DOWN WHERE YOU CAN'T TURN LEFT BACK ON TO PLYMOUTH. I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING TO DO ABOUT THAT NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE, BUT THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT IT'S AN OPTION IN THE FUTURE. OKAY. THANKS.
01:10:08.373: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:10:13.345: >> Commissioner Briggs: I APPRECIATE THE DESIRE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION, YOU KNOW, KIND OF -- A MORE GLOBAL DISCUSSION AND NOT BE UNFAIR TO THIS PETITIONER. I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS ISSUE GOT RAISED, YOU KNOW, QUITE A WHILE AGO AND SO THERE WAS -- THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN THIS DISCUSSION HERE. I DON'T THINK IT -- I HOPE THERE WAS SOME DISCOMFORT WITH COMING BACK AND STILL PROPOSING A DRIVE THROUGH TO SOME DEGREE. IN TERMS OF -- I WANT TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY I SAY IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE HIGHWAY, WHY I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT DOWNTOWN IS A BETTER LOCATION. OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ANY PLACE IS BUT I AM PARTICULARLY -- I THINK STADIUM WAS A MUCH BETTER LOCATION THAN THIS LOCATION. AND THE REASON IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHY IS IT THAT WE ARE SAYING THAT NEXT NOT HIGHWAY IS A BETTER LOCATION? WELL, WE ARE THINKING OKAY, WHEN WE ARE TRAVELING AND YOU ARE GOOGLING, WHERE ARE YOU -- WHERE SHOULD YOU STOP AND GET SOME FOOD AND YOU GRAB -- YOU KNOW, YOU GET OFF THE HIGHWAY. YOU PULL THROUGH AND THEN YOU GET BACK ON. SO WHAT ARE THOSE MOVEMENTS THAT WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO DO? YOU KNOW, WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE -- SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE -- THAT IT'S SAFE THAT THEY STOP, STOP AT PANERA AND THEN GET BACK ON A HIGHWAY GOING 70 TO 80 MILES PER HOUR WHILE EATING FOOD, WHILE DRIVING. I MEAN WE ARE ENCOURAGING BEHAVIOR THAT WE RECOGNIZE IS DANGEROUS. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO PUSH BACK ON OURSELVES ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS ARE. WHY DO  WE THINK IS BETTER NEXT TO A HIGHWAY. WE ARE ACCEPTING THESE AUTOCENTRIC PATTERN. BUT THAT'S THE REASON I DON'T THINK IT'S GREAT NEXT TO THE HIGHWAY. AND I -- I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS COMMISSIONER WOODS AS WELL, IN EARL  TERMS OF THE COV9 PIECE. WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF RESTAURANTS, A LOT OF TAKEOUTS AND JUST ANECDOTALLY, MY SON, WHO IS 20, IS BACK FROM COLLEGE AND DOES NOT FOLLOW IN HIS MOTHER'S FOOTSTEPS IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC STUFF. SO HE DROVE OUT TO CARPENTER ROAD FOR STARBUCKS THE OTHER DAY WHERE HE COULD FIND THE ONE STARBUCKS THAT WAS OPENED AND HIS REPORT BACK TO ME WAS THAT THE DRIVE THROUGH LINE WAS 60 CARS LONG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND HE PARKED HIS CAR. YOU KNOW, DID THE MOBILE THING. WALKED UP TO THE DOOR, AND SOMEBODY BROUGHT OUT THEIR FOOD. YOU KNOW, BROUGHT OUT HIS DRINK AND HE GOT ON HIS WAY. THE DOOR PEOPLE WERE WRAPPED ALL AROUND THE BUILDING WAITING FOR THAT DRIVE THROUGH WHEN WITH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUICKER TO PARK AND CALL IN THEIR ORDER AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE THAT AT KROGER. AND WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT ACCESSIBILITY IS NOT POSSIBLE AND YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. WE ARE SUGGESTING MAYBE THE BEST WAY THAT YOU CAN DO THAT IS, YOU KNOW, PULL INTO A PARKING SPOT AND SOMEONE GETS YOUR FOOD. I DON'T THINK WE NECESSARILY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S ARGUMENTS AND POSITIONS ON THIS. THOSE E ARE  MY THOUGHTS ON IT.
01:13:22.934: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:13:27.138: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WILL SAIL ANECDOTALLY, I SAW THE OPPOSITE ON STADIUM. ONE THE BANKS THAT HAS A DRIVE THROUGH, THERE'S A MAN STANDING BETWEEN TWO CARS GETTING TO THE ATM RIGHT AFTER COVID, WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET MONEY, BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE ACCESS, BUT -- I MEAN, YOU CAN DO WALK UP AND YOU CAN DO THE THING -- IT'S MORE ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BUILDING THAN IT IS ABOUT CARS VERSUS PEOPLE. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT STADIUM BECAUSE IT IS GETTING MORE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY AND ADDING MORE CARS TO IT THROUGH DRIVE THROUGH, I THINK IS MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN HERE. WE MIGHT BE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET OFF OF THE HIGHWAY AND ON THEIR WAY HOME TO DELIVER -- BRING FOOD TO THEIR FAMILY. AS A PARK AND RIDE ADJACENT TO IT, THIS IS A VERY CAR-HEAVY AREA. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF MODES OF TRANSIT IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE CITY. THIS IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. IT'S NOT MAKING A STAND TO US SAYING THAT DRIVE THROUGHS OR FOR THE CITY. THIS IS NOT SAYING THAT DRIVE THROUGHS ARE FOR C3. THIS IS SPECIAL EXCEPTION. WE ARE REVIEWING IT IN A CASE-BY-CASE RIGHT NOW. I THINK COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL REALLY BROUGHT UP THE STRONG POINT OF WE NEED A TO EVALUATE THIS WAS A POLICY AND I THINK WE SEE A LOT OF POLICY THINGS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE OTHER ONE CAME UP IN THE PAST YEAR, I MEAN, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PARKING HEAT ISLANDS AND MAXIMUMS INSTEAD OF MINIMUMS AS A SIGNIFICANT THING TO SUSTAINABILITY TOO THAT HAS MOVED FORWARD VERY SWIFTLY. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE CURRENT CONDITION. SO I THINK FOR WHAT IT IS, I SUPPORT IT FOR THIS PROJECT.
01:15:11.142: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL RIGHT. IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE. MR. LENART?
01:15:25.623: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
01:15:26.190: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
01:15:26.724: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
01:15:30.762: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:15:39.437: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
01:15:40.038: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
01:15:42.273: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
01:15:48.112: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
01:15:48.713: >> Commissioner Briggs: NO.
01:15:50.548: >> Planning Manager:  MOTION CARRIES.
01:15:55.586: >> MAY I SAY ONE THING?
01:16:00.858: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE ARE ALMOST -- WOULD ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS LIKE TO HEAR SOMETHING FROM THE PETITIONER? WE ARE ALL SET HERE.
01:16:08.700: >> Commissioner Woods: I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THE PETITIONER HAS TO SAY.
01:16:11.836: >> THANK YOU.
01:16:12.537: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:16:13.471: >> I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, I'M A FATHER OF FOUR CHILDREN AND I WANT TO SEE THIS PLANET FOR MY FOUR CHILDREN. WHEN I WAS HEAR LAST, I HEARD YOU FOLKS LOUD AND CLEAR. IF YOU RECALL LAST TIME WHEN WE DID THE PANERA BUILDING, THERE WERE NO SOLAR. LET ME MITIGATE AS MUCH AS I CAN BY PUTTING SOLAR PANELS. I'M FIRST ONE WHO WANTS TO SAVE THE PLANET. I WANT TO SEE MY FOUR KIDS ENJOY THE PLANET. WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN A REASONABLE, SMART WAY. I THOUGHT IF WE DO SOLAR PANELS ON THE PANEA AND MITIGATE SOME OF THESE THINGS, THEN MAYBE WE CAN ALL GET A WIN/WIN OUT OF THIS AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING TO DO. I THINK -- AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING IN AND REALLY READING THE MATERIALS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU.
01:17:00.518: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA WHICH IS THE UDC AMENDMENTS RELATIVE TO SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS INSTALLATION FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. AND I SEE MR. KOWALSKI IS HERE. WELCOME! YOU ARE MUTED RIGHT NOW, BUT WELCOME.
01:17:22.507: >> THANK YOU.
01:17:23.808: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH YOU.
01:17:27.845: >> OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I SAW YOU ALL. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU IN THE VIRTUAL SETTING. I HAVE A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS HERE, PROPOSALS FOR TONIGHT. MR. LENART IS GOING TO BE RUNNING A SLIDE SHOW IN A MINUTE. SO THE TWO PROPOSALS WE HAVE ARE UDC AMENDMENTS REGARDING SOLAR, SOLAR EQUIPMENT, SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS. THESE WERE PRESENTED ORIGINALLY BACK IN I BELIEVE IT WAS JANUARY OR SO, TO THE ORC COMMITTEE AND HONESTLY BY NOW, I FORGOT WHO WAS AT THAT MEETING. WE DID HAVE IT AT THAT MEETING AND THESE DRAFTS DO INCORPORATE SOME OF THOSE CHANGES. AS THE STAFF REPORT SAYS WE ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO PRESENT THIS IN MARCH BUT THAT PLAN WAS SIDE TRACKED A BIT. WE WILL GO THROUGH THE FIRST PROPOSED AMENDMENT IS REALLY REGARDING THE -- IS AN EXCEPTION TO THE HEIGHT LIMITS. WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW IS BASICALLY, IT'S AN EXCEPTION FOR SOLAR PANELS AND ACCESSORY -- WELL, SOLAR PANELS AND THE SUPPORTING STRUCTURES TO EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT BY UP TO 12 FEET. THAT IS FOR A FLAT ROOF. SO WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW, IF WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT -- THERE WE GO. THANK YOU. SO BASICALLY, THIS IS ONLY ON A FLAT ROOF. RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY, AS IS MENTIONED, THAT OUR HEIGHT LIMITS ARE TAKEN TO THE TOP PART OF ANY FEATURE OF A ROOF, OF ANY STRUCTURE, WHETHER IT'S MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT OR ARCHITECTURE FEATURES ON THERE. CURRENTLY, IF YOU PUT A SOLAR ENERGY PANEL ON TOP, A FLAT ROOF IN PARTICULAR, WHERE THIS IS FOCUSED, IT'S TYPICALLY GOING TO EXTEND BEYOND THE LIMIT OF A ROOF AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO GET UP TO THE MAXIMUM OF THE HEIGHT LIMIT BUT WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO ENCOURAGE SOLAR IN THIS AREA AS WELL. SO IF WE COULD FLIP TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I HAVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES, REALLY. OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE SEEN THESE ALL BEFORE. THE FIRST EXAMPLE, THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T EXTEND THAT FAR ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE ROOF. THESE ARE NOT FROM ANN ARBOR, BY THE WAY. AS MANY OF YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT BY LOOKING AT THAT. THEY EXTEND BELOW THE PARAPET, SURROUNDING THE EDGE OF THE BUILDING BUT GIVES YOU AN EXAMPLE. YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT, PLEASE. THESE ONES HAVE EXTENDED A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. YOU CAN'T QUITE TELL FROM SOME OF THE ANGLES OF THE PHOTO, BUT IT DOES EXTEND UPON THE PARAPET BEYOND THAT. OBVIOUSLY IN THIS ONE IT HAS SOME OTHER STRUCTURES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THAT, BUT IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AGAIN, WITH THAT SLOPE, IF SOLAR PANELS WERE THE HIGHEST STRUCTURE, WE WOULD TAKE THE HEIGHT TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE THOSE SOLAR PANELS. IN PARTICULAR -- AND, AGAIN, WE REALLY APPLY THIS TO FLAT ROOFS ONLY. THE NEXT SCAM; REALLY WHY WE HAVE GONE TO THE 12-FOOT LIMIT. SO YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE, AS WE ARE TRYING TO GO TO ENCOURAGED MAXIMUM SOLAR COVERAGE, AS I SAID, MANY OF OUR BUILDINGS THAT -- THE MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT IS ON THE ROOF IN MOST CASES AND PARTICULARLY DOWNTOWN BUILDING AND THE FLAT ROOF BUILDING TEND TO HAVE THEIR EQUIPMENT ON THE ROOFS. AND THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR THEM TO, AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE PICTURE TO TEND SOLAR PANELS ABOVE ANY MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT. THIS ONE IS ELEVATED ABOUT 9 TO 10 FEET. I SAW SOME OTHER EXAMPLES THAT VARY BETWEEN 10 TO 12, USUALLY LESS THAN THAT. WE FIGURE 12 FEET DOES GIVE ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR ANY KIND OF -- IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT FOR THOSE TO EXTEND. SO, AGAIN, THIS IS NOT -- I WANT TO STRESS, THIS IS NOT AN EXCEPTION TO THE HEIGHT LIMITS OF THE DOWNTOWN. IT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO EXTEND STRUCTURES UP 12 FEET. ALL THIS WOULD ALLOW IS THE EXTENSION OF SOLAR PANELS AND THE SUPPORTING EQUIPMENT, AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. SO THAT'S -- AND WE CAN OBVIOUSLY COME BACK FOR DISCUSSIONS, BUT I WILL HANDLE BOTH OF THE AMENDMENTS AROUND THE SAME TIME. IF W WE CAN HOP TO THE NEXT ONE. THE NEXT ONE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE INVOLVED. REALLY, WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS AN EXCEPTION FOR SOLAR PANEL ACCESSORY STRUCTURES, THINGS LIKE CARPORTS. AGAIN RIGHT NOW IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, IF YOU INSTALL ANYTHING, INCLUDING SOLAR PANELS, THAT'S GREATER THAN 240 SQUARE FEET ON THE GROUND, IT'S CONSIDERED AN ACCESSORY STRUCTURE AND IT WOULD TRIGGER THE SITE PLAN. AND THIS IS OFTEN AN AMENDMENT, BUT NOT ALWAYS. WHAT THIS AMENDMENT WOULD ALLOW IS TO ARE SOLAR PANELS AS ACCESSORY CARPORT STRUCTURES TO BASICALLY COVER AREAS. AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE IT -- MAYBE IF WE CAN FLIP TO THE SLIDES. WE WILL GEOFF  GIVE YOU SOME EX. THIS IS FROM THE LOCAL. EAST LANSING. ONE THE LARGEST SOLAR CARPORTS IN THE COUNTRIES, IT'S INSTALLATIONS. THEY HAVE IT OVER A COUPLE OF LOTS. SO THIS KIND OF GIVES YOU AN EXAMPLE. THESE VARY ABOUT TO 20 FEET IN HEIGHT, IN SOME CASES. THEY HAVE THESE IN A COUPLE OF LOCATIONS AROUND THEIR CAMPUS. SO THIS IS, AGAIN, KIND OF A LARGER OF AN EXTREME EXAMPLE. WE DID PUT A LIMIT IN OUR -- IN THE LEG R REGULATIONS FOR A LIMN OF 10,000 SQUARE FEET BUT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A SIZE LIMIT PER STRUCTURE BUT THE TOTAL OF ALL STRUCTURES CANNOT EXCEED 10,000 SQUARE FEET. AND IF YOU SEE THE OTHER STANDARDS -- YEAH, ARE WE GOING TO FLIP TO THE OTHER STRUCTURES. THESE SOME ARE TYPICAL EXAMPLES. NOTHING THAT IS EARTH SHATTERING, BUT THESE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THAT IN THE PAST, WE HAD INTERESTS FOR PEOPLE ADDING CARPORT STRUCTURES AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS. NOW, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY KIND OF A MULTIFAMILY SETUP. SO WHILE YOU COULD NOT JUST THE CARPORT ITSELF WOULD TRIGGER A SITE PLAN, IF YOU PUT ONE UP FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSES OF SOLAR PANELS UNDER THIS YOU WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. AGAIN, HERE'S KIND OF A MUCH SMALLER EXAMPLE, BUT IT DOES EXCEED 240 SQUARE FEET AS WELL. AND THEN THE LAST EXAMPLE, VERY SIMILAR TO KIND OF WHAT STARTED THIS PROPOSAL. SO, AGAIN, WE SEE VARIOUS SIZES AND BORIS YE BRETT, IF YOU COULO THE TEXT LANGUAGE. AGAIN, REALLY WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW IS IF YOU HAVE AN EXISTING PARKING LOT, SOMETHING LIKE A WESTGATE, MAPLE VILLAGE, LARGE PARKING LOTS THAT WANT TO CONSTRUCT STRUCTURES OVER EXISTING IMPERVIOUS AREA. THE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM, IT WOULD NOT AFFECT ANY OTHER SITE PLAN ELEMENTS. IT DOES KICK INTO THE SITE PLAN. YOU CANNOT REMOVE AS YOU SEE HERE REQUIRED LANDSCAPING, LAND MARK TREES, IF YOU ADD IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. IT STILL TRIGGERS IT. THIS IS ONLY ALLOWING THEM TO PUT IT OVER EXISTING IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. THIS REALLY WAS TRIGGERED BY A -- A CASE THAT WAS KIND OF BROUGHT FORWARD TO US, THAT INITIALLY REALLY KIND OF -- ONE OF OUR DEALERSHIPS IN THE CITY WANTED TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS FOR, YOU KNOW, SOLAR VEHICLE CHARGING AND A BIT OF DISPLAY AS WELL. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, AS I TOLD THEM, WELL, IT'S NOT PROHIBITED. IT WOULD TRIGGER AND ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENT THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION, HAS NOT BEEN SITE PLANNED IN QUITE A WHILE. IT WOULD TRULY BE COST PROHIBITIVE ACTIVITY FOR THEM. AND REALLY, THOUGH, IT DID START GETTING ALL OF US AS PLANNING STAFF THINKING IN ORDER TO BRING THINGS THIS LINE WITH KIND OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND ALL OF THOSE OTHER TYPE ITEMS IN LOOKING AROUND TO OTHER COMMUNITIES THIS DOES SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT COULD ALLOW, MAYBE ENCOURAGE IN SOME CASES CERTAIN LOCATIONS TO DO THIS. SO, AGAIN, PARKING LOTS, YOU LOOK LIKE LARGER INSTALLATIONS LIKE BRIER WOOD AND THE MAPLE VILLAGES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. STILL ANY SITE PLAN ELEMENTS THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE TRIGGERED WOULD STILL BE TRIGGERS IF THE SOLAR INSTALLATION TRIGGERS, IF IT REMOVED LAND PARK TREES AND IF IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH SITE PLAN. I THINK THAT KIND OF IN A NUTSHELL COVERS ALMOST ALL OF IT. I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSION AT THIS TIME. AM I CALLING?
01:26:06.430: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU MR., KOWALSKI.
01:26:08.499: >> THANK YOU.
01:26:11.135: >> Chair Milshteyn: AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED SOLAR ENERGY CODE AMENDMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENT CAN BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247 AND THEN ENTERING MEETING ID921-1722-6228. THIS INFORMATION IS ALSO DISPLAYED ON THE MEETING AGENDA AND VIDEO FEED. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF WHY YOU ARE PHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND, AFTER DIALING INTO THE MEETING, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTINY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO THAT WE MAY HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS.
01:27:12.329: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS, MY APOLOGIES IF I SOMEHOW BOOTED YOU OUT OF THE MEETING WHEN I WAS DOING ALL THE ARRANGING. AND CHAIR MILSHTEYN, YOU DID AN EXCEEXCELLENT JOB. WE HAVE NO CALLERS ON THE LINE.
01:27:24.808: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. SEEING NO UP WITH, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.18.4, EXEMPTIONS TO HEIGHT LIMITS TO ALLOW SOLAR PANELS TO EXCEED HEIGHT LIMIT, SECTION 5.16.6N SOLAR PANEL -- OR SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS TO WAIVE SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF SOLAR CARPORTS SUBJECT TO STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. AND WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:28:13.090: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I JUST WANT TO SAY, I THINK THIS IS GREAT AND THANK YOU TO STAFF AND THE RFC FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS. IT IS REALLY APPRECIATED. FEEL LIKE THESE ARE PRETTY MUCH NO BRAINERS, ANY WAY THAT WE CAN ADD INCREMENTAL SOLAR COVERAGE IN THE CITY, WE CAN AND THIS IS TO STRUCTURES THAT WOULD ALREADY EXIST OR TO COVER PARKING LOTS THAT ALREADY DO EXIST, AND I THINK THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE. JUST FROM AESTHETICS STANDPOINT, THAT'S THE ONE POINT OF CONCERN THAT I COULD ANTICIPATE, ESPECIALLY LIKE GIVEN IN 2017, ALL THE DEBATE WE HAD ABOUT GROUND-MOUNTED SOLAR IN FRONT YARDS. I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND WHEN I FOUND OUT SHE LED THE ADVOCACY TO GET HER ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL'S PARKING LOT COVERED IN SOLAR PANELS AND THEY LIVE IN A VERY ANCIENT MINDED MIND-SET. AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS TO THE HIGH SCHOOL HAVE EXPLAINED AND IT PRODUCES 880-KILOWATTS OF POWER. SO IT'S A -- IT'S PRETTY COOL. AND, YEAH, THESE THINGS -- I THINK IT INSPIRES MORE THAN THEY DETRACT FROM THINGS.
01:29:32.469: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:29:33.704: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I TOO THINK THIS IS GREAT. THERE'S ONE THING I WANT TO BRING UP THAT HAS TO DO WITH DESIGNING THESE THINGS, WHICH IS THAT BY VIRTUE OF PUTTING IN THE POSTS, YOU WILL BE NONCOMPLIANT WITH THE SIZE OF THE PARKING SPACE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN WIDTH AND DEPTH AND THEY DON'T FLOAT MAGICALLY ABOVE. AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN STILL MAKE THIS WORK BY ALLOWING YOU TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPACT SPACES THAT YOU HAVE, BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE A SLIM POST AND COMPLY AND MAKE IT A COMPACT SPACE. SO I GET IT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO REALLY KEE THE SITE PLAN EXACTLY THE SAME, BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT EXACTLY THE SAME IF YOU COVER LARGE AREAS OF PARKING LOT WITH THIS. THE WAY THAT THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT IN THE -- THE ONE AREA IN KERRYTOWN WHERE THEY PUT UP A FEW, YOU KNOW, OVER THERE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE FOR THAT THING, IT'S THIS MASSIVE CANTILEVERED THING WITH BIG STEEL I-BEAMS COMING OUT THAT DON'T HAVE POSTS. THAT'S SUPER EXPENSIVE! AND IT'S NOT GOING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO NECESSARILY DO THIS. AND SO IF THERE'S SOME WAY -- I REALLY WANT THIS TO HAPPEN. I -- YOU KNOW, I THINK WE -- THIS IS EXACTLY THE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO IN, BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE NEED TO SET IT UP SO PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS AND STILL COMPLY. SO IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO WRITE IN LANGUAGE AROUND, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY CAN CHANGE THE NUMBER OF -- INCREASE THE NUMBER EVER COMPACT SPACES THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR SITE PLAN OR AS LONG AS THEY DON'T REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SPACES BY 1% OR SOME SORT OF WAY TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO STILL BUILD THESE THINGS AND COMPLY WITH OUR DESIGN STANDARDS. THAT'S -- THAT'S MY CONCERN. SO JUST FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN -- BECAUSE IF YOU IMAGINE -- I THINK WHAT WE ARE ALL IMAGINING ARE THESE HUGE PARKING LOTS, YOU KNOW, BRIARWOOD OR MAPLE VILLAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MOST OF THOSE THINGS DON'T HAVE TONS OF ISLANDS? WHICH YOU CAN PUT THE POSTS. YOU WILL BE PUTTING THEM IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUNCH OF PAVEMENT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SETTING OURSELVES UP SO THAT PEOPLE CAN -- CAN STILL COMPLY WITH -- WITH WHAT WE ARE -- SO YOU SEE -- YES, SEE HOW THEY HAVE THAT SLIM FOOTING THERE? BUT THAT -- AND YOU CAN SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND ALLOW IT TO BE 6 INCHES ON EITHER SIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COGNIZANT OF WHAT WE ARE DOING TO THE DIMENSION OF THE PARKING SPACE, SEEING THAT THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY -- THEY PUT THEIR PARKING SPACES -- THIS ONE WAS DESIGNED WITH THIS IN MIND. AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO THIS AS A RETROFIT COMMISSION. SITUATION. WE WOULD LOVE IT IF PEOPLE WOULD DO IT WITH THEIR SITE PLANS TOO. HAD SO BIG CAN'TY LEVER -- I MEAN THIS IS -- CANTILEVERED. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO ADVERTISE THIS AND SHOW IT OFF, BUT BUILDING THAT STRUCTURE IS MASSIVE! YOU KNOW, TO BE ABLE TO DO IT THAT WAY. SO THAT'S -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE REVIEWING ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE ARE TAKING ALL THE KIND OF DESIGN ASPECTS INTO CONSIDERATION TOO, SO THAT WE ARE ALLOWING THIS TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT -- IT'S GOING TO FACILITATE ITS INSTALLATION FOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY -- YOU KNOW, YOU ARE LIKE, OH, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH -- YOU ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH X, Y, Z AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SITE PLAN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COVERING OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT WAY. -- OUR BASES IN THAT WAY.
01:33:28.705: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD JUST -- YOU CAN RESPOND TO THIS IF YOU WOULD LIKE, MATT, BUT I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD REMIND THE COMMISSION, THE SAME QUESTION COME UP WITH EV PARKING AS WELL. AND SO IT'S -- I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE. I'M GLAD YOU RAISED IT, BUT I THINK SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS OR THE APPROACHES THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, MAYBE COMPACT SPACES, MAYBE WE LOOK AT ADJUSTING THE DIMENSIONS OF OUR PARKING SPACES. I DON'T KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE, BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES MIGHT BE SMALLER. I KNOW THEY ARE NOT ALL. SO I THINK THE SOLUTION -- THE PALATE OF SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE THE SAME FOR BOTH OF THOSE PROPOSED ORDINANCES.
01:34:21.825: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:34:26.129: >> Vice Chair Mills: HI, IT WAS MY INTERNET CONNECTION IT WAS NOT YOU, MR. LENART, WHO BUMPED ME OFF. MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE FIRST SET. THE ROOF-MOUNTED FLAT ROOF SOLAR PANELS, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION, MR. KOWALSKI. AS, YOU KNOW -- I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE HEIGHT LIMIT GOING 12 FEET ABOVE AND THEN YOU SHOWED MECHANICALS UNDERNEATH. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT WOULD AYOU LO ALLOW FOR THE MEC, THE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM ITSELF. BUT AS I READ THE ORDINANCE, YOU CAN'T USE SOLAR PANELS AS AN EXCUSE TO HAVE OTHER MECHANICALS THAT EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT; IS THAT RIGHT?
01:35:10.106: >> THAT'S CORRECT. YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT.
01:35:12.909: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. IN MY MIND, LIKE, HONESTLY, ALLOWING THAT LOOPHOLE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET US MORE SOLAR. AND SO YOU MIGHT MAYBE -- MAYBE WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS SAFE, BUT I WOULD SAY IN THE FUTURE, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD LOOSEN. HONESTLY, IF YOU ARE -- LIKE, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP THE SOLAR PANELS RELATIVELY LOW, JUST BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED THEY MAY BECOME A SAIL AND IT TAKES MORE TO ANCHOR THEM. THE OTHER THING I THOUGHT I WOULD MENTION IS IF WE ARE ALLOWING THEM TO BE 12 FEET TALL, THIS HE COULD BE AN AMENITY SPACE. THIS HE COULD BE SHADE FOR THE ROOF. THERE'S -- THAT'S BEING TALKED ABOUT, ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW IN OUR STATE PARKS, ABOUT OFFERING SOME -- IT'S ON GROUND, BUT OFFERING GROUND-MOUNTED SOLAR PANELS AS, LIKE, SHADED PICNIC AREAS. I THINK THAT THAT IS A GOOD HEIGHT AND AS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW, IT'S FINE. IN THE FUTURE IF WE ARE NOT SEEING AS MUCH SOLAR AS WE WANT, AGAIN MAYBE PRODUCING -- ALLOWING OTHER MECHANICALS TO BE HIDDEN UNDER -- [ NO AUDIO ] WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL CARROT THAT WE WANT TO OFFER TO SEAL MORE ROOF-MOUNTED SOLAR IN THE FUTURE. THIS. I SO THE WHAT SHANNAN SAID ABOUT THE PARKING SPACES. MAYBE THAT'S A TWEAK TO THE LANGUAGE ABOUT OVERALL NUMBER OF SPACES, IF WE -- IF WE ALLOW FOR A REDUCTION IN REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF SPACES WE MIGHT HAVE PROBLEMS, BUT, LIKE, REDUCED WIDTH OF SPACES. I THINK IT SHOULD BE NONCONTROVERSIAL OR EVEN A LANGUAGE THAT WOULD SAY, LIKE, REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF SPACES AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T GO BELOW OUR MINIMUMS OR, YOU KNOW -- I MEAN THIS GETS BACK TO THE CIRCULAR CONVERSATION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, ABOUT WHETHER WE HAVE PARKING MINIMUMS OR MAXIMUMS AND I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO PULL THAT INTO THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW BUT FOR THE FUTURE -- I'M NOT -- AGAIN, I COULD HAPPILY DRAFT A LITTLE AMENDMENT, AMENDED LANGUAGE TO THE SECOND ONE. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE TO PEOPLE. I THINK THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF OPTIONS EITHER ALLOWING, YOU KNOW, COMPACT SPACES OR KIND OF WHAT SHANNAN SAID BY REDUCING IT EITHER BY PERCENTAGE OR AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SPACES TO BE LESS THAN THE MINIMUM REQUIRED.
01:37:48.131: >> Planning Manager:  JUST GENERALLY AS YOU DISCUSS, MY THOUGHTS ARE I -- I FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE COULD TAKE THAT DIRECTION FROM YOU, AND PROGRESS WITH THIS TO THE NEXT STAGE WITH CITY COUNCIL. MY -- THE INTENT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THAT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT SYMPATHY OF THE STRUCTURAL ASPECTS AND HOW THAT RELATES TO OUR DIMENSIONAL PARKING SPACES SO THAT WE ARE SORT OF -- LIKE TO COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL'S POINT, WE ARE NOT CREATING THIS OPTION, ONLY IF YOU SPEND A PREMIUM STRUCTURE-WISE TO ACCOMMODATE IT. SO I FEEL -- LIKEWISE, I'M NOT SURE WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IN THAT REGARD RIGHT NOW. WE ARE -- I KNOW THAT PLANNER KHAN AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE OPTIONS FOR EVs. WE COULD APPROACH THIS TWO WAYS. IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH US TAKING THAT DIRECTION AND ADVANCING WITH THIS, I'M HAPPY TO PROGRESS WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION. IT MIGHT RESULT IN A LITTLE BIT OF BREAK BEFORE IT GOES TO CITY COUNCIL OR ON THE FLIP SIDE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO BRING THIS BACK TO YOU WITH THE MONTH ARE FLESHED OUT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL.
01:39:00.437: >> CAN I ASK A QUESTION FOR CLARIFICATION, AS WELL AS -- THE -- PAUSE WE DID -- I DID ACTUALLY CONSIDER A LITTLE BIT OF IMPACT OF THE POST AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND SOME OF THE -- LIKE, THE ONES TOWARDS THE END OF THE SHOW, THE CHEVY ONE, THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY OVERBUILT, OBVIOUSLY. SO IT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT. WOULD THE COMMISSION BE -- WE COULD BUILD IN SOMETHING. I THINK WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE BASE OF MANY OF THOSE, THEY WERE NOT THAT LARGE. WE CAN SPLIT THEM BETWEEN THE TWO. I THINK IF WE GET INTO THE QUESTION OF MODIFYING ANY KIND OF PARKING, WHETHER COMPACT MOUNTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT, I THINK IT GETS TRICKIER AND WE COULD EXPLORE THOSE THINGS. WOULD IT BE OKAY TO SAY THAT WE ALLOW SOME VARIANCE IN WIDTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL SPACES OR IS YOUR CONCERN THAT PEOPLE CAN'T USE IT BECAUSE IT WAS POSTED THERE. IT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE TO -- YOU KNOW, THE POSTS CAN TAKE UP AS MUCH AS ONE FOOT SQUARE -- YOU KNOW, 2 FEET OF A PARKING SPACE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? WE CAN ALLOW THE POST TO ENCROACH INTO SPACES RATHER THAN MESS WITH THE AMOUNT OF COMPACT OR OTHER SPACES ALLOWED. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE AND WHAT ARE SOME IDEAS?
01:40:19.816: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
01:40:21.751: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO PARK. I THINK THAT SPLITTING THE DIFFERENCE HELPS. YOU KNOW, IF EACH SIDE CAN ABSORB IT, BUT THERE'S A REASON THAT YOUR COMPACT SPACES ARE 8-FOOT WIDE AND THE REGULAR BASES ARE 9-FOOT SIDE. GUESTING LESS THAN 8 FEET IS TRICKY. YOU HAVE TO TURN TO GET IN, RIGHT? SO IF YOU CAN JUST SAY, SOMETHING ABOUT YOU CANNOT ENCROACH MORE THAN 6 INCHES INTO EACH, YOU KNOW, SIDE OR SOMETHING, AGAIN, BRETT, I TRUST THAT YOU GUYS CAN KIND OF FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT FROM HERE. I  THINK THAT'S FINE, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF IT HAS TO WORK FOR THE CAR TO BE ABLE TO PULL IN THERE. AND THE FURTHER BACK IT IS IN THE SPACE, THE HARDER IT IS, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T START TURNING UNTIL YOU CAN GET ALL THE WAY OUT OF THAT THING. AND SO IF IT'S REALLY NARROW, IT'S LIKE BACKING OUT OF A REALLY OLD GARAGE. YOU HAVE TO STAY STRAIGHT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND THE WAY THAT OUR DIMENSIONS ARE SET UP FOR OUR PARKING LOT HOURS IS 22 FEET AND THAT'S SMALL. LIKE, YOU HAVE TO START TURNING BEFORE YOU COME ALL THE WAY OUT BECAUSE YOUR CAR IS 18 FEET LONG. SO WHERE IT'S PLACED AND -- THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MAYBE JUST TALKING TO SOME OF THE FOLKS FROM ENGINEERING ABOUT THE -- THE ISSUES WITH TURNING RADII AND THAT SORT OF THING, I THINK YOU CAN GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT WITH THAT. AND, AGAIN, I TRUST THAT YOU CAN ALL FIGURE IT OUT BETWEEN NOW AND CITY COUNCIL. BUT I THINK THAT YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES ON YOUR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT AND I THINK YOU PROBABLY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT IN TERMS OF, LIKE, NOT NECESSARILY IT BEING A COMPACT SPACE OR NOT IN TERMS THE CATEGORIZATION BUT MORE DEFINING HOW MUCH YOU CAN ENCROACH INTO THE SPACE TO STILL MAKE IT WORKABLE FOR CARS TO MOVE IN AND OUT OF THERE FLUIDLY AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
01:42:15.331: >> WE CAN ALSO MAKE MINIMUM DIMENSIONS OF SPACES, TO COVER ANY SPACES THEY MUST BE 9 BY -- TO ALLOW THEM TO COVER COMPACT SPACES WITH IT. THAT GIVES THEM AN EXTRA FOOT.
01:42:27.744: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT OPEN I AMENT COULD PACT SPACE. IT HAS TO BE IN A NORMAL PEACE AND THEN YOU COULD DEFINE SOMETHING ABOUT HOW FAR YOU CAN ENCROACH IN EITHER DIRECTION OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. BUT, AGAIN, I THINK YOU ALL HAVE THE RESOURCES AROUND YOU IN ORDER TO MAKE A GOOD DECISION WITH THIS AND I'M COMPLETELY FINE WITH YOU ALL RUNNING WITH THIS, AND THEN TAKING IT TO COUNCIL. THAT'S ME ANYWAY,.
01:42:53.970: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. LENART, DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:42:55.672: >> Planning Manager:  I HAVE A QUESTION. IF THE COMMISSION COULD COMMENT, WHAT -- WHAT WOULD BE YOUR FEEDBACK ON IF IT RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF PARKING, HOWEVER IT STILL MET THE PARKING MINIMUM OF -- OF THE SITE? [ CHUCKLES ]
01:43:21.364: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH. SO THAT MIGHT BE -- THAT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE EVERYTHING, BUT THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT. IF YOU ARE -- IF THE SITE WERE OVERPARKED BY TWO SPACES, AND YOU WANTED TO CONVERT TWO OF THEM AND THEY COULD FUNCTION IN SUCH A WAY, BUT THEY SHRUNK BELOW THE MINIMUM SIZE OR SOMETHING, MAYBE WE COULD STILL ACCOMMODATE IN THAT REGARD. WE ARE STILL -- WE ARE STILL SORT OF HITTING THE GOALS THAT WE ARE ON EXISTING IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AND STILL MEETING THE PARKING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SITE AND ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE OPTIONS.
01:43:57.433: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:44:00.570: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO THE THING FOR THE PARKING, WHAT I THINK THIS KIND OF TRIGGERS IS LIKE AN ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENT FOR INTERNAL REARRANGEMENT PARKING SPACES AND THE ONLY KIND OF LINE ITEM IS NO REMOVAL OF REQUIRED PARKING IS THE LANGUAGE. SO MAYBE IT IS JUST A TERMINOLOGY THAT YOU CAN DO AN INTERNAL REARRANGEMENT WITHIN THE PROJECT AREA, AS LONG AS IT STILL MEETS THOSE MEN MUM REQUIREMENTS. -- THOSE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S ONE OF THOSE MUDDY AREAS THAT IT'S NOT REALLY COVERED IF -- LIKE, IF YOU COULD GET AWAY -- IF IT'S A LOOPHOLE OR NOT, BASED ON THIS LANGUAGE. IT JUST SAYS THAT YOU CANNOT REMOVE PARKING. SO MAYBE IT'S THAT INTERNAL REARRANGEMENT IS PART OF THE LANGUAGE TO LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENT PROCESS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I HAD A QUESTION MAYBE FOR CLARIFICATION ABOUT THE HEIGHT LIMIT AND TO COMMISSIONER MILLS' POINT, ABOUT TUCKING OTHER THINGS UNDER IT. LIKE, I LIKE IT AS AN AMENITY, AS LONG AS IT LOOKS GOOD AS -- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN MAKE PRETTY ROUGH SCAFFOLDING 12 FEET HIGH TO, LIKE, HAVE AS APPEARING LA R PEOPLE TO HANG UNDER. THERE'S A LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THAT. WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT'S 12 FEET HIGH, BUT IF IT'S OTHER MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT, IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO MEET THE MINIMUM HEIGHT. I GUESS WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THINGS KEEPING LIKE BUILDING UP OFF OF EACH OTHER. SO THE TOP OF THAT MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT STILL HILTS THE HEIGHT LIMIT AND NOW WE CAN JUST BUILD THE STAFF  SCAFFOLDING, BUT THE SCAFFOLDING OF FOLDING COULD BE 12 FEET ABOVE THAT MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT IF THAT'S THE HEIGHT LIMIT. ITS TO THE KIND OF NESTING IN NICELY IN A WAY. IT WOULD ONLY BE -- IF THAT ROOF HIT THE TOP HEIGHT LIMIT, I THINK WE WANTED AMENITY COVERAGE IS WHAT THE REASONS FOR THAT 12 FEET WOULD BE.
01:45:56.719: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WOULD COME INTO PLAY AS AN AMENITY. YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS BETTER THAN I DO, BUT --
01:46:03.993: >> Commissioner Sauve: YOU.
01:46:04.594: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK FOR MOST ROOF TOP AMENITIES IT WILL BE ACCESS BY AN ELEVATOR OVERRUN. SO YOU ARE PROBABLY -- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HIGHER YOU WOULD NEED TO GO WITH SOLAR PANELS FOR THAT PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE. I THINK THIS WILL BE MORE COMING INTO PLAY WHEN A BUILDING IS REALLY KIND OF JUST BARELY MAKING ITS HEIGHT LIMIT WITH MECHANICALS OR ELEVATOR OVERRUNS BASED ON WHAT IT'S TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, AND -- AND THEN YOU CAN'T GET HIGHER FOR SOLAR.
01:46:36.392: >> Commissioner Sauve: IT'S STILL LIKE A PLUS 12. LIKE, I'M -- I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE THAT -- LIKE, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A 12-FOOT GAP BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE LAST THING --
01:46:48.638: >> Planning Manager: SOMETHING.
01:46:49.972: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THE 12-FOOT AT THE MAX POINT. SO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THAT MARGIN. THE OWN THING THAT WILL FILL THAT 12-FOOT MARGIN WILL BE EQUIPMENT TO SERVICE THE PANELS. NOTHING ELSE WOULD FILL THAT GAP.
01:47:06.022: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK IT, BUT I THINK THE STANDARD, THE PROJECT AT THE CORNER OF WILLIAM AND MAIN, I THINK THE WAY THAT IS CONSTRUCTED IS THE TOWER PORTION OF THAT IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE HEIGHT LIMIT. SO THEY COULDN'T PUT SOLAR PANELS ON THAT PORTION.
01:47:24.507: >> Commissioner Sauve: RIGHT. I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE 12 NOT 12 FEET AND WHAT HAPPENST 12 FEET.
01:47:31.080: >> Planning Manager:  JUST SOLAR.
01:47:33.883: >> YEAH.
01:47:34.884: >> Commissioner Sauve: YEAH. AND I GUESS, LIKE, THAT'S MORE LIKE AN ANGLE FOR POSTS -- IF THESE THINGS WERE AT LIKE 12 DEGREES, YOU NEVER REALLY NEED ALL 12 FEET TO GET THAT HEIGHT. I KNOW -- I MEAN, I THINK IT'S OKAY NOW. WE'LL JUST SEE HOW IT GOES AND ADAPT. I DON'T THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO ADJUST AT THIS POINT, BUT I JUST WANT TO WALK THROUGH WHAT WE ARE REALLY GOING TO SEE IN THAT HEIGHT MARGIN, BASED ON THIS.
01:48:00.209: >> Planning Manager:  MAYBE WE NEED TO DO SOME MORE DIAGRAMS, MATT, THAT -- JUST LIKE CLEARLY, WE COULD TAKE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES ABOUT HOW THIS MAY MANIFEST AND WHAT WOULD COUNT AND WHAT WOULDN'T COUNT IN THAT.
01:48:18.794: >> Commissioner Sauve: THANKS.
01:48:19.428: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:48:20.429: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WANT TO GO BACK ONCE MORE TO THE PARKING LOT SCENARIO AND THE OTHER THING THAT IS IMPORTANT IS MAKING SURE NONE OF THE POSTS COME DOWN IN YOUR HANDICAPPED SPACES. YOU HAVE TO COMPLY, YOU KNOW, WITH THAT, IN TERMS OF THOSE DIMENSIONS. THAT'S REGULATED WAY BEYOND THE CITY. SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THAT GETS INCLUDED IN THE LANGUAGE TOO.
01:48:46.756: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A COUPLE OF MINOR AMENDMENTS WHEN IT GETS TO CITY COUNCIL. ALL RIGHT. ALL OF THOSE ARE -- OR ACTUALLY, WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL VOTE. MR. LENART.
01:49:12.181: >> LET'S START WITH YOU.
01:49:17.019: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
01:49:17.553: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SORRY, YES.
01:49:19.955: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:49:26.295: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
01:49:26.896: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
01:49:28.597: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
01:49:35.671: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
01:49:36.739: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
01:49:38.674: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
01:49:41.510: >> Planning Manager:  A LOT OF YESES.
01:49:43.612: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:49:45.047: >> THANK YOU. WE'LL GET IT REFINED AND HOPEFULLY IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE THAT YOU GUYS WOULD BE PROUD OF.
01:49:50.953: >> Planning Manager:  I GUESS I WOULD ASK TO THE EXTENT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE, COMMISSIONER, R ACKERMAN, YOU CAN KIND OF BE A ROLE OF CHECK POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT BY THE TIME THIS PROGRESSES TO CITY COUNCIL, YOU SEE THAT THIS HAS BEEN REFLECTED.
01:50:17.947: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. SO WE ARE MOVING ON TO OUR REGULAR BUSINESS. AND BEFORE US, WE HAVE THE 2020-2021 CITY PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING SCHEDULE. MR. LENART, DO WE NEED TO VOTE ON THIS? OR IS THIS AN FYI?
01:50:34.430: >> Planning Manager:  YOU NEED TO VOTE ON IT.
01:50:37.466: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO I WILL HAVE A COMMISSIONER MOVE OUR SCHEDULE. MOVED BY MILLS AND SEC SECONDEDY SAUVE. DISCUSSION ON OUR 2020-2021 SCHEDULE. COMMISSIONER WOODS.
01:50:59.555: >> Commissioner Woods: I THINK WE MENTIONED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S GUIDELINES WOULD BE COMING INTO PLAY AND THE CITY GUIDELINES AND EVERYTHING. DO YOU THINK THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO -- EVEN IF WE -- IF IT'S MOVED THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO HAVE MEETINGS IN CITY HALL, WILL WE STILL POSSIBLY HAVE THIS OPTION OF ZOOM FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TO CITY HALL?
01:51:26.615: >> Planning Manager:  UM --
01:51:28.717: >> Commissioner Woods: OR EVEN FOR THE PUBLIC THAT MIGHT WANT TO CALL IN AND NOT COME TO CITY HALL?
01:51:33.055: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I WILL -- I WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I CAN TELL YOU GENERALLY, THE CITY HAS BEEN LEARNING A LOT FROM ZOOM MEETINGS AND WE ACTUALLY SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF INCORPORATING THIS BY CHOICE, NOT OUT OF NECESSITY IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE, VIA FROM YOUR HOME AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO COME TO CITY HALL AND PERHAPS -- PERHAPS IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING TO MULTITASK WHILE YOU ARE WAITING FOR A PARTICULAR AGENDA ITEM TO COME UP OR SOMETHING. SO A LOT OF THINGS ARE AT PLAY IN THAT REGARD. THE CITY HAS TRADITIONALLY TAKEN STEPS AND POLICY DIRECTIONS THAT ALL MEETINGS, WHETHER THEY LEGALLY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT OR DON'T, DO TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT. THE GREAT EXAMPLE, WE POST THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE MEETING TO MEET OPEN MEETINGS ACT. THAT'S A COMMITTEE MEETING, THE OMA WOULD NOT TYPICALLY REQUIRE THAT TO BE THE SAME PUBLICATION REQUIREMENTS AS THE FULL PLANNING COMMISSION. BUT THE CITY HAS DONE THAT FROM A LENS AND A DESIRE TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. AND SO AS TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT IF THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER -- IT -- A LOT OF IT COMES DOWN TO THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER AND WHAT IS ALLOWED AND NOT ALLOWED. I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW UP TO WHAT EXTENT THE CITY HAS MADE ANY DETERMINATIONS THAT INCORPORATING ZOOM AS PART OF AN IN-PERSON MEETING WOULD STILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT. RIGHT NOW IT'S COMPLIANT SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER. IF THAT ORDER WERE TO EXPIRE, WITHOUT ANY EXTENSIONS OR MODIFICATIONS, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO IN-PERSON MEETINGS, BUT I WILL FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION. AND IF I DON'T SHARE IT PRIOR, I WILL DEFINITELY SHARE IT AT THE NEXT COMMISSION MEETING.
01:53:31.907: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ALSO JUST SOME PERSPECTIVE. MR. LEONARD LENART, BUT MR. POSE CITY ATTORNEY IS GOING TO GIVE US SOME INFORMATION ON THAT, AND PROVIDE AN UPDATE BY FRIDAY. I CAN'T SEND THAT TO YOU WITHOUT PERMISSION, BUT IF YOU WANT TO REQUEST THAT SAME FEEDBACK, WE SHOULD BE GETTING IT SOON.
01:53:54.730: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY.
01:53:55.564: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND I CAN FLOAT TO CITY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES WE HAVE LIKE A POLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE THAT WRITES RESOLUTIONS A VOLUNTARY INDICATING FOR CERTAIN STATE LEVEL POLICIES. AND WHILE I CAN'T CONVINCE GOVERNOR WHITMER TO DO ANYTHING, WE CAN AT LEAST FORMALIZE OUR SUPPORT FOR THAT WITH A LETTER, AN OFFICIAL LETTER OR SOMETHING IF THE CITY COUNCIL WANTS TO TAKE THAT UP. SO I WILL FORWARD THAT. I -- YOU RAISE A VERY VALID POINT THAT JUST BECAUSE THE LAWS GO AWAY DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE VIRUS DOES.
01:54:23.625: >> Planning Manager:  AND IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE REALLY TRIED TO EXPAND OUR METHODS. SO WE NOW HAVE OUR ECOMMENT WHICH PREVIOUSLY WAS ONLY PROVIDED FOR CITY COUNCIL AGENDAS, IN ADDITION TO EMAIL AND PUBLIC SPEAKING. IT'S MODEST, I WILL PROVIDE YOU, BUT WE HAVE -- REGARDLESS OF HOW -- HOW MEETING IS CONDUCTED WE HAVE TRIED TO OPEN UP THE WAYS WE CAN HEAR FROM PEOPLE FOR FEEDBACK ON PARTICULAR PETITIONS.
01:54:51.520: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:54:52.588: >> Commissioner Briggs: I WANTED TO ECHO COMMISSIONER WOODS' RECOMMENDATION AROUND PUBLIC INPUT, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT FOR US TO NOT BE THERE IN PERSON, I THINK HAVING THIS OPEN FOR P PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO AND ACTUALLY SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER DOING FOR A LONG TIME, EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ADVANTAGE OF IT. I HAVE NOTICED AS I HAVE WATCHED MORE PUBLIC MEETINGS, IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE OPTION AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING, IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO. HOPEFULLY.
01:55:34.797: >> Chair Milshteyn: IT HASN'T HIGH PRESSURED IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, BUT IT HAS HAPPENED. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ON OUR CALENDAR FOR 2020-2021. SEEING NO ONE, MR. LENART, ARE YOU OKAY WITH A VOICE VOTE FOR THIS ONE? ALL RIGHT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ANY OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT IT'S APPROVED. WE NOW MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. AND AT THIS TIME, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES IN REGARDS TO ANYTHING AT ALL. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247. AND THEN ENTERING MEETING ID 921-1722-6228. THIS INFORMATION IS ALSO DISPLAYED OPEN THE MEETING A -- ON MEETING AGENDA AND VIDEO FEED. THE CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND AFTER DIALING INTO THE MEETING, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO THAT WE MAY HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS?
01:57:08.423: >> Planning Manager:  NO CALLERS ON THE
