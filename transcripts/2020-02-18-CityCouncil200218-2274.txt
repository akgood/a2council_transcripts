00:01:09.677: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? AGENDA IS APPROVED DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR?
00:01:23.057: >> WE DO, MAYOR. AND THANK YOU FOR A COUPLE OF MOMENTS. I WANT TO START BY THANKING OFFICER FRAHALLI FOR BEING SOME HERE THIS EVENING. THERE ARE QUITE A FEW ITEMS ATTACHED AS COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. SOME ARE A BIT OVERDUE, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION, PARTICULARLY AS YOU LOOK AT A.C.7, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPROVEMENTS TO CROSSWALKS AND HAS SOME PEDESTRIAN SAFETY STATISTICS IN THIS AS WELL. THIS MORNING, WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE CEREMONIALLY THE BEGINNING OF THE BERM OPENING PROJECT. THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO MAYBE PUT UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BAD WEATHER AND CERTAINLY A LITTLE BIT OF SPEA, GOT TO COMMEMORATE THE START OF A PROJECT THAT IN MANY WAYS IS TYPICAL OF HOW LIFE IS IN ANN ARBOR. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF MASHING OFOF GEARS TO GET THERE. BUT WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE WERE GOING TO LAUNCH A PROJECT THAT'S TRANSFORMATIVE AND WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE IN OUR LIVES AND THOSE OF OUR CHILDREN. AND WITH THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ABOUT ITEM DC-8, WHICH COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER LATER THIS EVENING. BASED UPON THE OUTCOME OF THAT MATTER, THIS MAY BE THE LAST EVENING TO SPEND TOGETHER. BUT IN FULL RECOGNITION, COUNCIL HAS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE LEADERSHIP FOR THE CITY OF GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBERS BOTH PAST AND PRESENT AND ALL THE MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY, OUR RESIDENTS, OUR BUSINESSES, PEOPLE WHO LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY HERE, OUR NONPROFITS. CERTAINLY UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM, AND MANY OTHERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE YOU OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THOSE DAYS HAVE BEEN FULL AND CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT CHALLENGE, BUT WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED. IN THAT LIGHT, RATHER THAN TALK ABOUT A LONG LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS, WHICH WILL QUICKLY BE FORGOTTEN, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE MEANS AND WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER THE FOUR PILLARS OF THAT, WHICH ARE PURPOSE, RESPECT, HEALTH, AND JOY. I WILL START BY TELLING YOU, YOU HAVE THE MOST AMAZING CITY STAFF, WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO THE MEANING OF PUBLIC SERVICE. THEY OPERATE IN THAT LANE, BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WHERE WE ASPIRE TO BE. THAT PATH IS OFTEN ROCKY BEING AND SOMETIMES DISRUPTIVE AND CERTAINLY NOT LINEAR. AND THE JOURNEY AT TIMES WINDS UP IN PLACES THAT WE DON'T EXPECT. WE MAY ALSO HAVE SPIRITS AND ROBUST DISCUSSIONS ON THE DIRECTIONS AS WE ARE DRIVING, BUT PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT YOUR STAFF WILL KEEP US HEADED IN THE POLICY DIRECTION THAT COUNCIL HAS ESTABLISHED. SECONDLY, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESPECT, REMEMBER THAT RUNNING FOR COUNCIL IS HARD, AND SERVING AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IS HARDER STILL, ESPECIAL I IN AN ERA WHERE THERE'S NO LINE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIVES AND THE MEMORY OF THE INTERNET IS ETERNAL. COUNCILMEMBERS TAKE TIME FROM THEIR LOVED ONES, CAREERS AND OTHER THINGS THAT PROVIDE PURPOSE AND MEANING TO THEM TO SERVE YOU. THE COMMITMENT THAT THEY MAKE FOR THE -- [ [ NO AUDIO ] EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THE TASK THAT COUNCILMEMBERS AND STAFF TAKE ON CAN BECOME ALL CONSUMING AND CAN WEAR OUT EVEN THE HEARTIEST MICHIGANANDER. TAKING TIME OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALL PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY AND HEALTHY IS ESSENTIAL IN PROVIDING OUR ABILITIES TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. ALONG THOSE LINES, WE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER TO TAKE THE TIME TO TELL EACH OTHER HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOU, HAD HOW MUCH WE CARE FOR EACH OTHER AND HOW MUCH WE RESPECT EACH OTHER. THE LAST PILLAR THAT I WOULD HIKE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT IS THAT WHICH IS THE JOY OF PUBLIC SERVICE. WE ACMISCHED AND SET IN MOTION MANY EFFORTS TO PROTECTING THE TREMENDOUS QUALITY OF LIFE THAT WE HAVE IN ANN ARBOR. MUCH OF WHAT WE DO GOES UNNOTICED AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE JOB THAT WE HAVE CHOSEN. WE MAY ALSO NEVER KNOW TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE POSITIVELY IMPACT THE LIVES OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. IN CLOSING, I DO WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE. I HAVE MADE NO SECRET AND AT TIMES BE ON NOXIOUS OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE RECENTLY BECOME A GRANDPARENT. I HAD NO IDEA HOW IT WOULD SO SEVERELY AND POSITIVELY IMPACT MY VIEWS AS WELL. WHEN I LOOK AT MY GRANDSON, I KNOW THAT HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE A WARM, SAFE, DRY PLACE TO SLEEP WITH PEOPLE WHO LOVE HIM, THAT HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD AND QUALITY MEDICAL CARE, AND HE WILL GET AN EXCEPTIONAL PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT WILL PREPARE HIM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE. THOSE ARE RIGHTS THAT EVERY PARENT AND EVERY GRANDPARENT IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IN OUR NATION SHOULD EXPECT AND THEY DESERVE AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO PAY FOR THEM. THEY LIKE THE VERY CORE OF OUR ANN ARBOR VALUES, AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY WILL ALWAYS WORK TOGETHER ON BEHALF OUR CHILDREN. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE, AND THE EXPERIENCES OF THE PAST FOUR YEARS. AND WITH THAT, I WISH YOU PURPOSE AND MEANING, LOVE AND RESPECT, GOOD HEALTH AND ABOVE ALL, THE JOY OF SERVICE TO OTHERS. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:07:39.032: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE TO INTRODUCTIONS TODAY. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CR CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS ELIZABETH COLLINS.
00:08:12.332: >> HI, CITY COUNCIL, MAYOR TAYLOR. I'M SPEAKING TODAY ABOUT DC-3, AND THE PESTICIDE MANAGEMENT. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THIS IS A GREAT START TO HELP WITH THE HEALTH OF OUR WATER SYSTEMS, POLLINATORS, BIRDS, ALL WILDLIFE, BUT ESPECIALLY HUMAN HEALTH. THIS DEFINITELY TIES IN WITH OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND 2030A.20. WITHOUT SPR SPRAYING PESTICIDESN OUR LAWNS, WE WILL GET THE NATURAL GRASSES GROWING WHICH IN TURN LESS MAINTENANCE AND LESS CARBON. IF WE ARE TO BE TRULY SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT, WE WANT TO EXPAND THIS. WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON FUTURE WAYS TO BAN ROUNDUP, AND OTHER DANGEROUS CHEMICALS. I'M SO PLEASED TO HAVE THE CITY WORK ON GETTING THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC, ESPECIALLY HOW TO DISPOSE OF PESTICIDES PROPERLY THAT WE MAY HAVE IN OUR GARAGES, HOW TO IMPLEMENT GROWING PRAIRIE GRASSES AND DIFFERENT LANDSCAPING TO BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS GREAT AND THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION FOR HAVING THIS ON YOUR RADAR, AND THANK YOU.
00:09:25.472: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS RITA MITCHELL.
00:09:36.216: >> HI, I'M RITA MITCHELL. I LIVE AT 621 FIFTH STREET. HAD E.O. WILSON, ONE OF OUR PROMINENT NATIONAL ADVOCATES FOR BIODIVERSITY SAYS I WILL ARGUE EVERY SCRAP OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IS PRICELESS, TO BE LEARNED AND CHERISHED AND NEVER TO BE SURRENDERED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE. HE ALSO SAID IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE BULK OF DIVERSITY AND OF BIODIVERSITY AND ENSURE A HEALTHY PLANET, WE MUST CONSERVE HALF THE EARTH'S LANDS AND SEAS TO PROVIDE SPECIES THE SPACE THEY NEED TO THRIVE. WE HAVE A CHANCE. THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW AND YOU HAVE STARTED AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR MOVING ON THE 2030 CLIMATE EMERGENCY. I WANT TO ALSO THANK THE EFFORTS OF MISSY STULTS AND THE OFFICE AT THE SUSTAINABILITY AND COMMUNICATIONS AND THE GROUPS WHO ARE WORKING HARD AND IN PARTICULAR, I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR HER DEDICATION TO THE GOALS. THEY WANT TO DISSEMINATE INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT AND TURF GRASS REDUCTION STRATEGIES TO OWNER OF YOU EVER TURF GRASS WITHIN THE CITY. THAT'S ALL OF US. THE RESOLUTIONS COMMUNITY, EDUCATIONAL EFFORT WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO HELP US LIVE IN GREATER HEALTH AND HARMONY WITH NATURE. IT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION TO RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND CAMPUSES. ALL OF US CAN REDUCE BOTH THE USE OF TOXIC CHEMICALS ON GARDENS AND YARDS AND THE AMOUNT OF MOWED TURF GRASS AND HAVE THE RESULT OF A BEAUTIFUL AND SAFE SURROUNDINGS FOR PEOPLE, PETS AND SURROUNDINGS. THE EFFORTS TO MANAGE THE COLLECTIVE OUTDOOR SPACES. AND TO REDUCE TURF GRASS AREAS. WE WILL WORK TO EXPAND THE SPACES AROUND THE CITY THAT PROVIDE HABITAT FOR POLLINATORS AND URBAN WILDLIFE AND CHEMICALLY SAFE SPACES TO ALLOW CHILDREN AND PETS TO TOUCH THE EARTH AND PLANTS, WITHOUT BEING HARMED BY TOXIC POISONS. THE PLANTS THAT GROW WITHOUT HARMFUL CHEMICALS WILL PROVIDE SAFE FOOD FOR THE POLL ENATORS AND BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE. ANN ARBOR'S LANDSCAPE IS ALREADY DRASTICALLY ALTERED FROM WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN PRESETTLEMENT DAYS. THE RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU TONIGHT WILL NOT TURN BACK THE CLOCK. , BUT IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE TO SUPPORT LIVING WITH OUR SURROUNDINGS TO CONTRIBUTE SAFELY TO THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE ECOSYSTEMS OF WHICH WE ARE A PART. LET'S WORK TOGETHER AND PROVIDE THE SPACE THAT ALL SPECIES NEED TO THRIVE. PLEASE VOTE YES ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
00:12:23.283: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ERIC LIPSON. MR. LIPSON? ERIC? ERIC LIPSON. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAN MICHNIEWICZ.
00:12:45.872: >> HI, MY NAME IS DAN MICHNIEWICZ. I'M RUNNING IT WARD 5 FOR CITY COUNCIL. I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT DC-7, WHICH IS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF D.T.E. STREET LIGHTS AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST INVESTOR-OWNED -- INVESTOR-OWNED ENERGY UTILITIES AND IN FAVOR OF A PUBLICLY OWNED ENERGY UTILITY. SO THE CITY-OWNED STREETS TOO AND LIKE THE RESOLUTION SAYS, WE ARE ALREADY DOING A BETTER JOB THAN D.T.E. AT MAINTAINING THIS SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE IS IMPLICATIONS HERE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY, WHEN IT COMES TO THE STREETLIGHTS AND OUR COMMUNITY'S QUALITY OF LIFE. THEY ALLOW US TO STAY OUT LATER AND ENJOY THE OUTSIDE UNDER SAFELY LIT STREETS AND IT AFFECTS THE BEAUTIFICATION OF OUR CITY TOO. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD COME AS A SURPRISE THAT AN INVESTOR-OWNED UTILITY LIKE D.T.E. IS NOT PRIORITIZING THE NEEDS OF OUR RESIDENTS LIKE WE CAN. SO I'M IN FAVOR OF DC-7 AND WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF DIRECTING STAFF INTO LOOKING INTO PURCHASING THESE STREET LIGHTS FROM D.T.E. BECAUSE WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB. AND I THINK WE SHOULD, YES, GO FURTHER BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ONLY IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN IT COMES TO THE STREET LIGHTS BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BEING CARBON NEUTRAL BY 2030, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PROVISION IN THE GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND D.T.E. IS NOT GOING TO TRANSITION TO RENEWABLES FAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS AT THE SCALE NECESSARY. I HAVE GOT SOME TIME LEFT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ADDRESS, I THINK, WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TALKED ABOUT THE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS, LIKE, YOU CAN'T STAY NEUTRAL ON A MOVING TRAIN AND CITY STAFF ARE MAKING POLITICAL DECISIONS. I HAVE HAD POLITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM HOWARD LAZARUS' DECISIONS IN TERMS OF THE -- WHAT WAS THE POTENTIAL RESTRUCTURING OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT, AND WHAT WAS HIS STEWARDSHIP OF THE CREATION OF THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. AT THE SAME TIME, IF THE CITY COUNCIL AND IF THE COMMUNITY ARE PRIORITIZING THINGS LEEK HOUSING AND CLIMATE -- LIKE HOUSING AND CLIMATE, I DON'T THINK THAT THIS, WHAT IS GOING ON, THIS RECENT -- THIS MOST RECENT, YOU KNOW, ITERATION OF WHAT IS A POLITICAL TIFF BETWEEN TWO FACTIONS IS GOING TO GET OUR COMMUNITY ANYWHERE CLOSER TO ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS OR OUR HOUSING CRISIS AT THE SCALE NECESSARY. MY NAME IS DAN MICHNIEWICZ AND I'M RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL IN WARD 5.
00:15:43.717: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVE SILKWORTH.
00:15:47.187: >> HI. GOOD EVENING. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE A CORRECTION. MY SPEECH TONIGHT WILL BE ABOUT DC-2, THE RESOLUTION FOR CITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS. SO MY NAME IS DAVID SILKWORTH, I'M A RESIDENT OF THE FIFTH WARD AND I'M HERE TO SHOW MY SUPPORT FOR DC-2:00 THE RESOLUTION FOR CITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS. OUR COMMUNITY IS FACING A WIDE RANGE OF URGENT AND VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES RANGING FROM AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING OR JUST PLAIN LIVING FOR MANY OF OUR CURRENT RESIDENTS, TO OUR RECENTLY DECLARED CLIMATE EMERGENCY, TO OUR FAILING OR INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND, YES, EVEN TO SOME BASIC QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES. VOTERS HAVE ELECTED OUR MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL TO REPRESENT US, TO SERVE AS OUR POLICYMAKERS IN THESE MATTERS. AND THESE ARE COMPLEX ISSUES THAT AFFECT A LARGE AND DIVERSE POPULATION. SO WE NEED LEADERS WHO WILL BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW THEY APPROACH AND HANDLE THEM. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND CITY STAFF HAVE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE, WHICH INCLUDES THE RANKED IMPORTANCE SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE ADDRESSED APPROPRIATELY IN OUR CITY'S PLANS, BUDGET AND OPERATIONS. FOLKS, WE LIVE IN A GREAT LITTLE CITY, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY OUTSTANDING PEOPLE WORKING FOR OUR CITY GOVERNMENT. FOR A LONG TIME, THIS' A REAL DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS WANT OR REALLY NEED AND WHAT HAS BEEN PRIORITIZED. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS, I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN OUR CITY COUNCIL AND OUR STAFF. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION FOR CITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE WE NEED POLICIES THAT WILL FOSTER GREATER COLLABORATION BETWEEN ALL PARTIES, THAT WILL IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY IN HOW WE ARE GOVERNED AND WILL ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION IF WE ARE GOING TO MEET THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. THANK YOU.
00:17:38.932: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JOAN LOWENSTEIN.
00:17:46.639: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLEDGE ASKS YOU TO DO AS THE COUNTY AND MANY INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE AND COMMIT TO THE VALUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT SAYS THAT HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT, THAT WE MUST RESPECT RENTERS AND IMPROVE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THE M MARKET ALONE CANNOT MEET THE NEEDS FOR AFFORDABLE AND SAFE HOUSING. IT'S A RESPONSE TO A CRISIS, NO LESS A CRISIS THAN CLIMATE CHANGE OR CORONAVIRUS. THESE ARE VALUES SHARED BY OUR COMMUNITY AND GOALS THAT WE NEED TO REACH IF WE ARE GOING TO PAINT OURSELVES AS A FAIR AND EQUITABLE PLACE TO LIVE. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OR COMMUNITY VALUES AND HERE I SPEAK AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THIS COUNCIL. IN DECEMBER 2018, YOU MET FOR A BUDGET PLANNING RETREAT, AND THE STAFF PRESENTED YOU WITH A COMMUNITY SURVEY FROM THE FALL OF 2018, THAT SHOWED PRIORITIES FOR INCREASED SPENDING. THOSE WERE CHIEFLY ROAD RESURFACING, DRINKING WATER TREATMENT. THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND SUSTAINABILITY AND FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE. ADMINISTRATOR LAZARUS LED THE STAFF IN CREATING A BUDGET THAT REFLECTED THOSE PRIORITIES. THOSE OF YOU WHO VOTED TO SABOTAGE FUNDING FOR WATER SAFETY, WHO VOTED AGAINST AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND VOTED AGAINST BUDGETING MONEY TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE DO NOT REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS, AND YOUR VOTE TO OUST OUR ADMINISTRATOR WILL SHOW YOU HOW SORELY OUT OF TOUCH YOU ARE WITH COMMUNITY VALUES. WE WILL REMIND YOU THAT SUCH CORRUPTION AND INDIFFERENCE ARE UNACCEPTABLE. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:19:51.064: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS REBECCA ARENDS.
00:20:05.511: >> GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL. THIS IS JAMES DANIELS, MY WONDERFUL NEIGHBOR, AND HE HAS SIGNED UP NEXT TO SPEAK AFTER ME, BUT IN LIEU OF THAT, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A JOINT STATEMENT. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CHIEF MICHAEL COX. I WILL INTRODUCE MYSELF AS AN ARROWWOOD RESIDENT AND SOMEONE WHO HAS EARNED THE LOYALTY OF MY WONDERFUL NEIGHBOR WHO STARTED FINDING YOUR POLITICAL VOICE AT ARROWWOOD WHICH IS A QUARTERLY OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO COME MEET OUR RESIDENTS. AND THAT IS HOW WE MET. BACKING UP, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO START WITH GRATITUDE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR EXPREXPRESSING INTEREST IN HAVIG THESE MEETINGS AT PINE LAKE COOPERATIVE WHICH IS IN HIS WARD. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND EATON FOR CONSISTENTLY SHOWING UP TO THESE MEETINGS TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT. AND HELP BRAINSTORM WITH ME AN IDEA THAT WE CAN GIVE BACK OUR GRATITUDE TO OUR WONDERFUL FIRST RESPONDERS BY HAVING PERHAPS AN ANNUAL BANQUET AT THE MICHIGAN THEATER WHICH WE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE TEN EVENTS PER YEAR. FOR FREE. TO SHOW THEM OUR GRATITUDE FOR SHOWING UP FOR SOME VERY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS THAT NONE OF WHITE HO US WOULD REALLY WANE ON A DAILY BASIS. WHEN WE HAD OUR MEETING AT ARROWWOOD TO DISCUSS WITH THE CONSULTATION TEAM, WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN A POLICE CHIEF, I CITED EXAMPLES OF MY EXPERIENCES OF WORKING WITH AAPD. I ASKED FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS HOPEFULLY A PERSON OF COLOR, SOMEONE WHO HAD EXPERIENCED DIVERSITY, A BRIDGE BUILDER, SOMEONE WHO WOULD EQUALLY SUPPORT OFFICERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND THE LIST WENT ON FOR FOUR PAGES. WHEN I SAW CHIEF COX'S BIO AND SAW HIS INTERVIEW IN JULY. I THOUGHT WE FOUND OUR UNICORN. I IMMEDIATELY EMAILED SERGEANT CORY MILLS WHO IS FANTASTIC AND GOT RIGHT BACK TO ME. WE HELD OUR MEETING. YOU COULD HEAR A PIN DROP. CHIEF COX WAS EVERY BIT THE LEADER OF INTEGRITY I HOPED HE WOULD BE AND MORE. I AM GREATLY, GREATLY DISTURBED, GREATLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THAT THIS MAN, WHO HAS COMMITTED TO THIS CITY FROM BOSTON, LEAVING HIS WIFE WHO IS A DOCTOR, TO COME HERE AND MAKE A COMMITMENT TO MAKE OUR FORCE AND OUR CITY BETTER, HAS BEEN TREATED AND CHIEF COX, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FROM THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I BELIEVE IN YOU AND PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.
00:23:04.357: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:23:05.458: >> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JAMES DANIEL. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JULIET PRESSEL.
00:23:20.306: >> GOOD EVENING. JULIET PRESSEL, 2 2625LILIUM OVR ON THE EAST SIDE. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY BEFORE I GET ROLLING THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO SPEAK UP, BECAUSE WE CAN'T HEAR YOU BACK THERE. THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT I CAN HEAR BACK THERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SPEAKING HERE. SO PLEASE SPEAK LOUDER. THERE ARE TWO WORDS THAT PRIOR SPEAKERS HAVE USED THAT I WANT TO MENTION MYSELF. ONE IS DISCONNECT AND ONE IS DISTURBED. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT WHEN HAD YOU HAVE SOMEBODY OF SUCH CELEBRITY COMING TO ANN ARBOR AND BASICALLY BEING THE FACE OF ANN ARBOR TO THE POLICE STAFF, TO THE CITY, AND TO PEOPLE AT LARGE, AND THEN SUDDENLY SIX MONTHS INTO HIS JOB, HE'S BASICALLY SUSPENDED. AND NO ONE CAN KNOW WHY. THAT'S DISTURBING. I AM NOT SAYING THAT THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OR EVEN ANYTHING THAT SHOULD BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL, BUT MY LAST INFORMATION WAS THAT NOBODY ON CITY COUNCIL KNEW WHY OUR NEW POLICE CHIEF HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. AND HONESTLY, I DON'T SEE ANY GOOD ENDING TO THIS, BECAUSE THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT. IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO HIM AND TO US AND HAVING HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH EMPLOYMENT LAW, I KNOW THAT A COMPLETE BLACKOUT IS NOT WHAT'S CALLED FOR, ESPECIALLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THIS PERSON BEING A PUBLIC EMPLOYEE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE TO ULTIMATELY CITY COUNCIL, WHO HAS THE POWER TO HIRE AND FIRE HIM. I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY ELSE WHO DOES. YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, BECAUSE IT'S EITHER VERY SERIOUS OR IT'S VERY FRIVOLOUS. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING IN BETWEEN, AND I'M DISTURBED AT THE LAST OF COMMUNICATION TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO KNOW, EVEN IF I'M NOT ONE OF THEM. WITH REGARD TO THAT, THE TERM DISCONNECT APPLIES VERY MUCH TO WHAT I SEE IN TERMS OF CITY COMMUNICATION. AND SOME OF THE DROPPED BALLS ARE NORMAL AND NATURAL BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS A LOT TO SAY AND A LOT TO READ AND EMAIL IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMMUNICATE. BUT I DO SUPPORT THE DC-2 RESOLUTION. I KIND OF WISH IT WERE A LITTLE STRONGER, BECAUSE I DO FEEL IT NEEDS MORE SPECIFICS, AND I DO FEEL THAT PARDON ME, MR. LAZARUS, BUT I DO FEEL THAT WHEN THE PERSON WHO IS CHARGED WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE IMPROVED IS, IN FACT, NOT COMMUNICATING FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK. SO I WANT TO JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET MORE SPECIFIC IN YOUR EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS A DISCONNECT. PEOPLE OPEN THE OUTSIDE SEE IT. I DON'T SEE IT IN TERMS OF CORRUPTION. I SEE IT IN TERMS THE DYSFUNCTION. THANK YOU H.
00:26:25.891: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELLE HUGHES.
00:26:35.434: >> HI, I'M MICHELLE HUGHES AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU AND URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON CA-6 AND CA-7, TWO SIDEWALKS ON BARTON DRIVE. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CITY'S STATED CLIMATE GOALS OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030, WE NEED TO CREATE A CULTURE IN WHICH NON-MOTORIZED TRANSIT IS PEOPLE'S FIRST CHOICE. THAT MEANS PEOPLE HAVE TO FEEL THAT IT'S SAFE, EASY AND COMFORTABLE. THE CITY COUNCIL'S PREVIOUS LeTURNED DOWN SIDEWALK PROJECTS ON TRAVER AND ARGO. CITY COUNCILMEMBERS FROM THIS COUNCIL TABLE, SUGGESTED ALTERNATE ROUTES THAT PEOPLE MIGHT TAKE. NOW IMAGINE IF THE CITY'S RESPONSE TO POTHOLES WAS, WELL, DRIVERS CAN TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE. WE WOULDN'T FIND THAT ACCEPTABLE AND WE SHOULDN'T FIND IT ACCEPTABLE HERE. WE NEED TO TAKE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSIT AS LEAST AS SERIOUSLY AS WE TAKE DRIVING. WE CAN'T ASK PEDESTRIANS TO TAKE ANOTHER ONE FOR F THE TEAM HERE. IT NEEDS TO BE COMFORTABLE AND SAFE TO WALK WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO AND THAT MEANS WE NEED A ROBUST AND COMPLETE SIDEWALK NETWORK. SO PLEASE VOTE YES ON CA-6 AND CA-7. I KNOW THE WAY WE TAX PEOPLE TO BUILD SIDEWALKS IS CONFUSING AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT AWARE THAT THEY WOULD ONE DAY HAVE TO PAY THIS TAX AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE PLANNED FOR IT. I'M SURE IT MAY BE CONVENIENT TO NEVER PAY YOUR TAXES BUT PAYING TAXES IS HOW OUR COMMUNITY RUNS. IT'S HOW WE HAVE A FIRE DEPARTMENT, ROADS, PARKS AND SCHOOLS. WE COULD CHOOSE NOT TO CHARGE TAXES AND WE WOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE MONEY IN OUR POCKETS AND BE A MUCH POORER COMMUNITY. IN MANY CASES THIS SIDEWALK TAX WILL BE SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. AND HOMEOWNERS COULD GET A HOME EQUITY LOAN IF THEY NEED TO SPREAD IT FURTHER. AND I WILL REMIND US THAT THEY CAN APPLY FOR THE PROPERTY TAX POVERTY EXEMPTION. AND YOU CAN CALL THEM AT 734-998-9339. SO I HOPE YOU WILL AVAIL YOURSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE YES HERE TODAY, ON CA-6 AND CA-7 FOR SIDEWALKS AND SAFE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSIT. WHILE I'M HERE, I WOULD LIKE TO URGE YOU TO VOTE DC-5, THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE PLEDGE. AND THE BAN DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. IF ANY OF Y'ALL WANT TO SIGN, IT MEET AT THE BREAK. IF ANY OF Y'ALL WANT TO SIGN IT, MEET ME OVER THERE. AND IF ANY OF Y'ALL WANT TO SIGN IT, FIND ME. AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S OTHER VOLUNTEERS. THANKS.
00:29:25.471: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHLEEN STROUD.
00:29:31.510: >> KATHY?
00:29:32.711: >> I'M UP!
00:29:34.113: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S ALL YOU.
00:29:37.149: >> I'M ALTERNATE NUMBER ONE. KATHY STROUD, 2271 PLACID WAY ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. THERE ARE SO MANY ELEPHANTS IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT, BUT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT AND TO SUPPORT DC-3. OH! WRONG! DC-2. COMMUNICATION. AND WE NEED BETTER COMMUNICATION AND THIS IS JUST AN ATTEMPT TO PUT OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND GUIDELINES AND FEET IN THAT DIRECTION, AND SO I JUST URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON DC-2. THANK YOU.
00:30:22.061: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GEOFFREY HENNY.
00:30:29.268: >> GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK AS AN ALTERNATE. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE CITY CENTER COMMONS RESOLUTION. AND I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ATTENDING THE TASK FORCE MEETINGS THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN PLACE, WHICH WERE EXCELLENT. THERE HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE GONE ON DURING THOSE TASK FORCE MEETINGS THAT I HAVE ATTENDED. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY DISAGREEMENTS, BUT THOSE HAVE BEEN WORKED THROUGH. YOU WILL GET A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT TASK FORCE VERY SHORTLY. I HAVE HAD SOME INPUT INTO THAT, ASSISTING SOME OF THE MEMBERS WITH SOME OF THE IDEAS AND THE EXPERIENCES I HAD WITH COMMENTING IN EUROPE, IN PARTICULAR. AND I WOULD URGE YOU TO LOOK AT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND NOT ONLY SUPPORT THEM, BUT PUT THEM IN A MUCH LARGER CONTEXT. AS YOU MAY KNOW, THE COMMONS MOVEMENT IS WORLDWIDE, AND CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE TURNING TO THE COMMONS, THE SHARED RESOURCES DRIVEN BY BOTTOM UP PUBLIC PROJECTS. THEY ARE TURNING TO THE COMMONS AS A WAY TO OVERCOME SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE HAVE HAD THROUGHOUT HISTORY, BUT CERTAINLY IN THIS CITY, DEALING WITH THE -- THIS SORT OF POLARIZATION OF THE -- THE POLITICAL POLARIZATION, BUT ALSO THE POWERS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE POWERS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH TEND TO OVERSHADOW THE ORDINARY CITIZEN, ESPECIALLY THOSE CITIZENS THAT DO NOT HAVE PRIVILEGED ACCESS TO MONEY AND POWER. THE COMMONS IS A WAY OF RESOLVING AND DEALING WITH SOME OF THAT, AND ENABLING ORDINARY CITIZENS TO HAVE A MUCH BIGGER VOICE IN THEIR CITY AND TO BE ABLE TO GO DOWN A THIRD PATHWAY IN ACHIEVING SOME KIND OF WELL-BEING THAT IS NOT JUST THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR THE PUBLIC SECTOR, BUT IS A NEW KIND OF IN BETWEEN SECTOR, IF YOU LIKE, A THIRD WAY. AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS SUCCESSY IN IMPLEMENTED IN CITIES LIKE GHENT IN BELGIUM, AND MANY OTHER PLACES AND I THINK BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH AMAZING TALENT AND OPEN-MINDEMINDEDNESS IN ANN ARBR THAT WE COULD BECOME A LEADER IN THIS MOVEMENT, THIS WORLDWIDE MOVEMENT IF WE CHOOSE TO. AND SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO BE AS EXPANSIVE IN YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMONS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE BEING PUT FORWARD BY THIS TASK FORCE AND THINK OF IT AS A SEED FOR A MUCH BIGGER STORY DOWN THE ROAD FOR ANN ARBOR AND A NEW VISION FOR ANN ARBOR AND A NEW DEVELOPMENT FOR ANN ARBOR, FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. I TOO HE WILL IT ADDRESSES MANY -- I FEEL IT ADDRESSES MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP THIS EVENING. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:33:22.908: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER EATON? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
00:33:35.921: >> I DON'T KNOW EITHER BECAUSE I CALLED THIS MORNING AND THEY TOLD ME I WAS ON THE AGENDA. NO ONE CALLED ME BACK. SO I'M GOING TO SPEAK.
00:33:45.798: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD MAKE A MOTION THAT WE WAIVE THE RULE ON THE LIMIT ON SPEAKERS AND ALLOW THIS GENTLEMAN TO SPEAK.
00:33:52.037: >> YEAH, LET HIM TALK.
00:33:56.875: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SECOND.
00:33:58.110: >> I'M HERE TO ADDRESS THE COMMENT THAT MAYOR -- I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MADE LAST TIME I WAS HERE, ABOUT MY SITUATION AND LET ME REITERATE MY SITUATION. I HAVE HAD OVER 200 INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE, LAW ENFORCEMENT, 48 OF THOSE IN ANN ARBOR. I HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOUR TIMES, PAID THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN FINES, AND I HAVE NO CRIMINAL RECORD. NOT EVEN A TRAFFIC RECORD. MR. HAYNER, YOU MADE A COMMENT OUT OF ALL COUNCILMEMBERS, WHICH IS FUNNY TO ME, BECAUSE OUT OF ALL THE COUNCILMEMBERS THAT I SPOKE TO OVER THE YEARS YOU ARE THE ONE -- THE LEAST -- YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT I DIDN'T TALK TO. SO IT'S FUNNY TO ME THAT YOU HAVE A COMMENT ABOUT A SITUATION THAT YOU HAVE NO CONTEXT OR UNDERSTANDING OF, WHICH BRINGS ME TO THIS POINT TODAY, WHY I HAVE THIS MASK ON MY FACE, ALL OF THESE VIRUSES AND ILLNESSES AND SICKNESSES. CHINESE HAVE CORONAVIRUS. I'M TRYING TO -- CHINA HAS CORONA VIRUS. AMERICA'S GOT OLD WHITE WOMAN AND WHITE MEN TALKING ABOUT THINGS THEY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT. PEOPLE ARE DYING FOR IT. AND YOU GUYS ARE GETTING RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL. I DON'T SEE A BLACK FACE ON THIS COUNCIL. I'M THE ONLY BLACK PERSON THAT COMES HERE AND SPEAKS. THERE'S ONLY ABOUT FIVE OR SIX OF US IN THIS HERE! -- OF US IN HERE. DAN, I LIVE IN WARD 5. I CAN TELL YOU, I'M NOT VOTING FOR YOU. BECAUSE BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS BEING SOMETHING TO DECIDE FOR YOU, THAT'S A GREAT THING TO KNOW RIGHT NOW. LUMM, I HEARD YOU ARE NOT RERUNNING AGAIN. THAT'S A GOOD DECISION. WHO ELSE IS NOT -- YOU ARE NOT RUNNING AGAIN. THAT'S A GOOD DECISION. WHO ELSE IS NOT RUNNING AGAIN? I HAVE NEVER SPOKE TO YOU. YOU ARE ALWAYS QUIET. THAT'S A GOOD DECISION. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING ABOUT? ARE YOU RUNNING AGAIN? NO?
00:36:17.082: >> I'M NOT UP FOR REELECTION.
00:36:21.119: >> THAT IS A GREAT DECISION BY WHOEVER MADE THAT. MAYOR TAYLOR, I HOPE YOU RESIGN AS WELL. I TALKED TO YOU MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE YEARS. IT'S PROBABLY THE THING THAT KILLS ME. AND YOU ALL -- YOU DON'T GIVE A [ BLEEP ]. YOU DON'T CARE. THANKS.
00:36:41.006: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER EATON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:36:47.512: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WAS SADDENED TO SEE THE REPORT ABOUT THE 19-YEAR-OLD MALE STUDENT WHO JUMPED OFF ONE OF OUR PARKING STRUCTURES. WE IN 2017 PASSED A RESOLUTION URGING THE D.D.A. TO TAKE SOME EFFORTS TO INSTALL ANTISUICIDE BARRIERS. AND AT THAT TIME, IT WAS COST PROHIBITIVE TO DO PERMANENT INSTALLATIONS AND SO THEY DID TEMPORARY CHAINLINKED FENCE. AS ANY KID KNOWS, IT IS EASY TO CLIMB UP A CHAIN-LINKED FENCE AND IN THIS SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES, THIS YOUNG MAN CLIMBED THE TEMPORARY BARRIER AND JUMPED TO HIS DEATH. I HOPE THAT THE D.D.A. WILL RETURN TO THE SUBJECT OF INSTALLING PERMANENT APPROPRIATE SUICIDE BARRIERS. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, HAS, THEY HAVE BARRIERS THAT FOLD OVER ON ITSELF SO THAT YOU CAN'T EASILY CLIMB OVER THE FENCE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS PARTICULAR JUMP, BUT CERTAINLY WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST TEMPORARY MEASURES. IT'S BEEN TWO TWO YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS SINCE WE PASSED THAT RESOLUTION. I THINK IT'S TIME TO RETURN TO THAT SUBJECT AND I HOPE THAT THE D.D.A. HAS THE FUNDING TO PUT IN A PERMANENT SET OF STRUCTURES TO -- FOR THOSE JUMPS. THANK YOU.
00:38:16.034: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:38:18.403: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. JUST TO SHARE THAT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE MEETING HERE, DOWN IN THE BASEMENT CONFERENCE ROOM, THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION IS MEETING. I ASSUME THAT THEY ARE STILL MEETING. THE MEETING BEGAN AT 6:00 TONIGHT, AND OUR MEETINGS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY WELL-ATTENDED, BUT TONIGHT'S MEETING IS VERY WELL-ATTENDED. MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE THERE TO PRESENT THEIR CONCERNS TO COUNCIL -- TO COUNCIL? -- SORRY TO THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONERS TO SHARE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE, TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF CHIEF COX. AND I DID SHARE WITH THE -- THE MEETING WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY COUNCILMEMBERS EATON AND NELSON AND I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD WAS THERE WAS WELL. THE -- I DID SHARE WITH THE COMMISSION AND THOSE IN ATTENDANCE AT THE MEETING DOWNSTAIRS THAT THE NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS IS THAT THERE IS -- AS YOU KNOW, AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION, AND THE CITY COUNCIL IS TO RECEIVE THE REPORT OF THAT INVESTIGATION THAT IS BEING CONDUCTED BY AN OUTSIDE, INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR LATE TOMORROW OR EARLY THURSDAY. AND FOLLOWING THAT, THE PLAN AT THIS POINT IN TIME IS TO CALL A SPECIAL SESSION AND TO GO -- OF CITY COUNCIL AND TO GO INTO EXECUTIVE SESSION TO RECEIVE THIS REPORT AND ASK QUESTIONS, AND THEN DEPENDING ON WHAT THAT REPORT REVEALS, MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS RELATIVE TO CHIEF COX. SO I JUST WANTED TO SHOW THAT UPDATE, AND -- AND IT IS -- THE ICPA -- THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION HAS SIGNIFICANT INTEREST, NEEDLESS TO SAY IN THIS REPORT AND IN -- IN UNDERSTANDING FULLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND SO THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE APPRISED OF THIS AND ALSO PROVIDE THEIR INPUT ONCE THAT REPORT IS MADE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU.
00:40:56.061: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:40:56.962: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I KNOW WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF EVENTS IN ANN ARBOR, BUT  I WANTED TO GIVE A SHOT OUT TO JULIE ROTH WHO REMINDED ME ON THE EMAIL THAT THE A2020 INITIATIVE OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030 IS HAVING A BIG TOWN HALL THIS SATURDAY FROM NOON TO 5:00 AT PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL, AND SO I HOPE ALL OF YOU CAN STOP BY THERE. I KNOW I WILL BE THERE FOR PART OF THE TIME. AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO REMIND FOLKS OF THREE WAYS TO PARTICIPATE WITH COUNCIL IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR DECISIONS AND THOSE ARE COUNCIL CAUCUS. WE ARE HAVING COUNCIL CAUCUS ON SUNDAY NIGHTS BEFORE THESE MEETINGS. AND SO THE NEXT ONE WILL BE MARCH 1st AND THEN THE SUNDAY AFTER THAT IS MARCH 15, AND THAT'S IN THIS ROOM AT 7:00 ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND IT'S INFORMAL AND THERE'S LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO PARTICIPATE. AND THEN LASTLY, I JUST WANTED TO REMIND FOLKS THAT TO APPLY FOR OUR NUMEROUS BOARDS AND COMMISSION POSITIONS, AND YOU CAN APPLY FOR AS MANY AS YOU WANT AND THEN IF YOU ARE SELECTED, YOU CAN DECLINE IT AT THAT TIME, BUT IT'S -- YOU ARE WELCOMED TO GET ON THE LIST. THANK YOU.
00:42:20.211: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:42:27.986: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M GOING TO BE BRINGING FORWARD THREE RESOLUTIONS OR AT LEAST COMMUNICATIONS. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT COUNCIL CONSIDER ADDING A SECOND COUNCILMEMBER TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. SECONDLY, WE HAVE HAD TWO DEATHS RELATED TO PEOPLE CROSSING THE ROADWAY ALREADY THIS YEAR. AND I AM REQUESTING THAT COUNCIL BE NOTIFIED WHENEVER WE HAVE A DEATH OR A SERIOUS INJURY IN OUR ROADWAY OR A PERSON WHO IS ATTEMPTING TO CROSS OUR ROADWAY. I THINK THAT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE, AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T RELY ON MLIVE TO LEARN THIS INFORMATION. AND IT'S TRAGIC. THE LAST THING IS, I'M GOING TO ASK -- AND THIS WILL BE A RESOLUTION, THAT STAFF EVALUATE OUR LOCAL CROSSWALK ORDINANCE, THAT WE CONSIDER THE CROSSWALK ORDINANCE IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF OUR CROSSWALKS, WHERE MANY OF THE CROSSWALKS HAVE NO LIGHTING OR LIMITED LIGHTING. WE HAVE A LACK OF FUNDS FOR EDUCATION. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT THE LOCAL ORDINANCE IS, AND THIRD, THAT WE BENCHMARK AGAINST OTHER MICHIGAN CITIES THAT HAVE LOCAL ORDINANCES. AND JUST TO WRAP UP, I WITNESSED A CRASH ON HURON PARKWAY LAST WEEK WHERE THERE WERE CARS IN ALL THREE LANES, COMING DOWN HURON PARKWAY. THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE IN THE MEDIAN NOT CLOSE TO THE CROSSWALK AT ALL, ABOUT 10 FEET BACK FROM THE CROSSWALK. SUDDENLY THE CAR IN THE MIDDLE LANE SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES AND STOPPED AND EVERYONE JUST SORT OF LOOKED AT EX-OTHER. -- EACH OTHER. TRAFFIC ENGINEERING IS ABOUT REDUCING AMBIGUITY. WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN ANN ARBOR WHEN TWO PEOPLE ARE STANDING 10 FEET FROM THE CROSSWALK? OBVIOUSLY ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR DRIVERS THOUGHT IT MEANT STOP IN THIS CONDITION. AND WE REALLY NEED TO REDUCE AMBIGUITY. THANK YOU.
00:44:52.063: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO THE BOARD OF REVIEW ANNE HARLOW AND TO THE JOURNAL RIGHTS COMMISSION, JUDAH GASHGARBER AND ROGER AHN TO THEN STREET AREA BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT ZONE BOARD. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
00:45:29.701: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I AM NOT GOING TO REQUEST TO PULL THE TWO BARTON SIDEWALK CA-6, AND CA-7, BECAUSE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH MR. CRAIG HUPY AND MR. NICK HUTCHINSON THIS MORNING AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME. QUESTIONSABOUT THESE SIDEWALKS. AND THEY ALSO ASSURED ME THAT IF COUNCIL PASSES THESE RESOLUTIONS TWO RIGHT NOW, WE STILL HAVE RESOLUTIONS THREE AND FOUR, WHERE IF NEED BE, WE CAN MAKE CHANGES FOR -- OR CANCEL THE SIDEWALKS IF NEED BE. SO STAY TUNED FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THAT, BUT I AM NOT PULLING THOSE THIS EVENING.
00:46:19.217: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:46:20.218: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. NO NEED TO PULL IT OUT, BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION CA-5, THE BOARD OF INSURANCE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR JANUARY 30th MEETING. THIS ITEM INCLUDES THE ANNUAL RENEWALS OF THE CITY'S PROPERTY, CASUALTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGES. THERE ARE OVER 10 OF THEM, AND THE ANNUAL PREMIUMS TOTAL $1.1 MILLION. AFTER ABOUT FIVE YEARS OF FLAT TO DECLINING PREMIUMS, OUR ADVISOR, HIGHLAND INSURANCE ADVISED US THIS PAST SUMMER THAT THE MARKS FOR THESE COVERAGES WERE CHALLENGING. AND SURE ENOUGH, WHEN HIGHLAND WENT OUT FOR RENEWALS, THE QUOTES COME IN 33% HIGHER. HIGHLAND DID A NICE JOB WORKING WITH OTHER INSURERS SHOPPING THE COVERAGE AROUND AND WAS ABLE TO REDUCE THE INCREASE BY ABOUT A THIRD BUT IT'S STILL A 20% YEAR-TO-YEAR INCREASE. BECAUSE OF THAT, THE RESOLUTION ALSO INCLUDES APPROPRIATING $150,000 FROM THE RISK FUND BALANCE. THESE COVERAGES ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE CITY AND ALTHOUGH NEITHER STAFF THE INSURANCE BOARD WERE HAPPY ABOUT THE INCREASES, WE RECOMMEND COUNCIL SUPPORTS THESE RENEWALS TONIGHT AND WE THANK HIGHLAND FOR THEIR EFFORTS. THANK YOU.
00:47:27.385: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:47:28.253: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. JUST REAL BRIEFLY ON CA-8, I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR SUPPORT ON THAT. WE HAVE THESE AS NEEDED GEOTECHNICAL ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. I THINK WE FOUND THAT WE HAVE NEEDED THEM, AND HAVE MET DOWN AT THE RIVERSIDE TODAY, WHEN THEY START DIGGING UP THE ALLEN CREEK BERM UNDERPASS THERE AND I THINK THEY ARE AWARE OF THAT. I THINK IT'S COME TO REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS, AS THE CITY MOVES FORWARD WITH THESE BIG INFRASINFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AE SAW IT WITH LESLIE SCIENCE CENTER. I'M HAPPY FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THAT. AND AS FAR AS THE BARTON SIDEWALKS GO, SIDEWALKS ARE -- YOU KNOW, THEY ARE INDEED A PUBLIC GOOD. I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH -- THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT SIDEWALKS IS THAT THEY KIND OF EXIST AT THIS NEXUS OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE GOODS WHERE THE QUESTION IS WHO PAYS FOR IT AND WHO USES THEM AND WHO MAINTAINS THEM? IF WE RECOGNIZE THAT SIDEWALKS ARE PUBLIC GOOD AND PART OF INFRASTRUCTURE STRUCTURE NETWORK AND I THINK WE CAN ALL ACCEPT THAT THEY ARE, THEN THE QUESTION ARISES THEN WHY DOES ONLY ONE PROPERTY OWNER PAY FOR THAT UP WITH SECTION OF SIDEWALK. OF COURSE, THEY ARE FRE FREE TOE ALL THE SIDEWALKS BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE SIDEWALKS IN PERMEATITY. THEY ARE SURPRISED AT THE COSTS, AND SURPRISED AT THE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT THAT THEY MIGHT PUT IN FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES MAINTAINING THESE SIDEWALKS AND SO ON. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND THIS MAYBE AS PART OF OUR MICRO MOBILITY OR I'M NOT SURE WHERE IT WILL FIT INTO THE MANY TRANSPORTATION GEARS WE HAVE URN ITING HERE AT THE CITY. I THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION, ABOUT HOW ARE WE PAYING FOR THE SIDEWALKS AND HOW ARE WE ASSURING THAT THESE SIDEWALK GAPS ARE FILLED BECAUSE IT'S NEEDED. THESE SIDEWALKS ARE NEEDED. THEY ARE PART OF A BIGGER PICTURE, AND THEY ARE PART OF THE RIGHT PATH TOWARDS OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY EFFORTS. I WANTED TO PUT THAT FORWARD. THANK YOU.
00:49:26.471: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CON CONSENT AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED, WITH 11 MEMBERS PRESENT, AND ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. THAT SATISFIES THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR CA-5 AND CA-12. IS THAT IT? WE NOW COME TO A SET OFUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT A SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA. THAT IS TO SAY THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT MATTER OF THAT PUBLIC HEARING. YOU NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE, BUT YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:171 OF CHAPTER 8 (ORGANIZATION OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS) OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING TO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE TALPOS-KNIGHT ANNEXATION, 1.3 ACRES, 2731 NEWPORT. IS THERE NIP WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF FEBRUARY 3, 2020, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, AND SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? MINUTES ARE APPROVED. B-1 1 AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:171 OF CHAPTER 8 (ORGANIZATION OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS) OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER NELSON, SECONDED BY EATON. DISCUSSION OF B-1. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:51:26.624: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I'M HOPEFUL ABOUT THIS PASSING TONIGHT. I -- SINCE OUR LAST MEETING WHEN THIS PASSED AT FIRST READING, I LEARNED THAT ACTUALLY YPSILANTI IS HAVING A SIMILAR CONVERSATION TO WHAT I RAISED WITH THIS AMENDMENT. THEY ARE GOING A BIT FURTHER. NOTHING ABOUT MY AMENDMENT TAKES THE AUTHORITY AWAY FROM THE MAYOR TO NOMINATE ANYONE HE CHOOSES. YPSILANTI IS ACTUALLY GOING FURTHER AND HAVE A CHARTER AMENDMENT ON THE BALLOT THAT PROPOSES THAT THE MAYOR CAN MAKE NOMINATIONS OR TWO COUNCILMEMBERS CAN MAKE NOMINATIONS. AGAIN, THAT WOULD BE A CHARTER CHANGE. BUT AT ANY RATE, AS WE PASSED IT AT FIRST READING, ALL THIS IS SAYING IS THAT AN ORDER COMMISSION IS GOING TO DESIGNATE A SUBGROUP, INCLUDING COUNCIL LIAISONS TO LOOK AT APPLICATIONS. AND IF THEY CHOOSE, THEY MAY PRESENT THEIR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APPOINTMENTS TO THAT BOARD OR COMMISSION TO THE MAYOR. THAT'S -- I THINK WE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT THIS AT FIRST READING AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS. AGAIN, I HOPE IT'S NOT TERRIBLY CONTROVERSIAL. THANK YOU.
00:52:37.628: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:52:43.334: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WANT TO THANK YOU, SINCE NO ONE IS CHIMING IN, I WILL CHIME IN. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON TO BRING THIS FORWARD IN ORDER TO GREASE THE GEARS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS SO THAT THEY CAN OPERATE A LITTLE SMOOTHER. THEY CAN REQUEST MEMBERS THAT THEY THINK THAT WOULD WORK BETTER AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE AND I THINK THIS IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I KNOW ON THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, IT IS UP TO THE LIAISON, THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, AND -- AND THE POLICE OVERSIGHTS COMMISSION TO NOMINATE COMMISSIONERS TO THAT IMPORTANT BODY. AND APOLOGIZE TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE COMMISSION THAT I WASN'T THERE TONIGHT. IT JUST WASN'T GOING TO FIT IN WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON TODAY. SO I DO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING PRESENT. I WILL BE BROUGHT UP TO SPEED AS TO WHAT TRANSPIRED THERE AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S UPDATE ON IT DURING COMMUNICATIONS. BUT BACK TO THIS, I DO THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THERE IS SO MANY DIFFERENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND SO MUCH TURNOVER, THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ASSIST THE MAYOR AND GETTING THE INFORMATION TO WHAT TYPES OF PEOPLE COULD HELP THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. SO I APPRECIATE THIS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT.
00:54:20.331: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:54:22.967: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER NELSON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THIS IN NO WAY -- WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING, IMPEDES THE MAYOR'S ABILITY TO MAKE NOMINATIONS AND APPOINTMENTS TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD ORDINANCE. IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. COUNCILMEMBERS SITTING ON A BOARD KNOW WHAT THE BOARD NEEDS IN TERMS OF SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS OF ITS MEMBERS. SO I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY REASONABLE AND LOGICAL AND ISN'T TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR COUNCILMEMBER ON ANY GIVEN BOARD TO REVIEW THE APPLICATIONS AND POSSIBLY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THEIR FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE AND I JUST THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
00:55:05.543: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:55:08.612: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST HAD A PROCEDURAL QUESTION FOR THE CLERK. I KNOW WE WENT AROUND THIS AND I'M NOT SURE WE ARE SATISFIED WITH OUR SOLUTION LAST WEEK. I SEE THAT WE ARE BACK WITH "SHALL" FOR BOTH OF THEM. I THOUGHT WE HAD A "SHALL" AND A MAY ."
00:55:23.828: >> Vice Chair Mills: MY
00:55:25.296: >> Councilmember Nelson:  MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT --
00:55:27.565: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M LOOKING AT THE ELECTRONIC VERSION IN FRONT OF MEN AND THEY BOTH SAY "SHALL." TO BE FRANK, I DON'T RECALL. I KNOW I TALKED ABOUT THAT AT LENGTH LAST WEEK, BUT --
00:55:37.274: >> Mayor Taylor: IT WENT TO "MAY."
00:55:39.577: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK OUT OF TURN. I WAS PAYING PROBABLY CLOSER ATTENTION THAN ANYONE. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS WE HAD "SHALL" IN THE FIRST CLASS AND "MAY." WILL.
00:55:52.790: >> Councilmember Hayner: "SHALL" IN A AND "MAY" IN B.
00:56:03.968: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE'S PROBABLY A FIRST DRAFT AND A SECOND DRAFT.
00:56:08.339: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO CHECK. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT.
00:56:14.879: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS AS WELL, OF COURSE. THIS IS FAIRLY -- THIS IS COMMON PRACTICE IN A COUPLE OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, WHO FOLKS AAT THOSE -- THEY COMMUNICATE WITH ME WITH FAIR FREQUENCY AND OTHERS NOT SO MUCH. I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO MAKE PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S WITHIN THE -- WITHIN THEIR AMBIT. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-1 RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH CITY COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE. MOVED COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. DISCUSSION OF DC-1, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:56:57.521: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I INTRODUCED THIS RESOLUTION WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE THE CRASH RATE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. THE ROADWAY CRASH RATE. I RECEIVED FEEDBACK ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION HAVING SOME SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT PROBABLY SHOULD BE STAFF GENERATED RATHER THAN COUNCIL POLICY. AND I HAVE REVISED IT BASED ON THAT FEEDBACK. WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE OUR EFFECTIVENESS. WE CAN ADVOCATE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND WE CAN COORDINATE WITH WHAT STAFF IS DOING. AND A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES IS D. T.E. STREET LIGHTS. WE HAVE A RESOLUTION LATER IN THE AGENDA, BUT DO WE NEED TO RAISE THAT TO THE LEVEL OF COUNCIL ADVOCACY AND COUNCIL KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE. I PERSONALLY KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE, BUT I'M NOT SURE ALL COUNCILMEMBERS WERE AWARE OF OUR STREET LIGHT ISSUE AND IT IS CRITICAL AND IT IMPACTS SAFETY OF OUR PEDESTRIANS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE MDOT CROSSWALK ON HURON BEHIND DRLJACA. I HAVE BEEN VERBALLY ASSAULTED -- AND I USE THE TERM "ASSAULTED" BECAUSE PEOPLE SEE ME AS THE FACE OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY. THEY ARE ANGRY. THEY ARE AFRAID, THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED AGAIN. AND I KNOW THAT OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND OUR CITY STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH M DOT. IT'S AN MDOT ROAD BUT THIS NEEDS TO RISE TO A HIGHER LEVEL AND WE NEED SOME SERIOUS ADVOCACY BY OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS GET FLASHING LIGHTS AT THAT CROSSWALK IMMEDIATELY. SO I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS.
00:59:01.211: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:59:03.380: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. I HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE INITIAL VERSION OF THIS RESOLUTION, WHICH WE POSTPONED AT OUR LAST MEETING, BUT THIS REVISED VERSION ADDRESSES THOSE CONCERNS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT. WITH THE ORIGINAL VERSION, I WAS CONCERNED THAT THIS WAS UNDERMINING THE ROLE OF INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS BUT THIS VERSION MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. ENGAGEMENT AS DEFINED HERE IS MORE ABOUT EXTERNAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS AND PROJECTS. AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBERS GRISWOLD, BANNISTER AND EATON TOOK THE TIME TO MAKE THE REVISIONS, AGAIN, WHICH ALSO LARGELY ADDRESSED THE WORKLOADS CONCERNS, THE OTHER CONCERNS I RAISED BY STAFF AT THE ORIGINAL VERSION. I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE FURTHER CLARIFICATION REGARDING THE SPECIFIC ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS NEW COMMITTEE, VIS-A-VIS THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT CAN BE WORKED THROUGH AND THAT THERE'S ROOM AND A NEED FOR BOTH. THIS HAVE BEEN SEVERAL TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY-RELATED ISSUES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE THE PROCESSES JUST DID NOT WORK WELL. SOME EXAMPLES I'M THINKING OF INCLUDE THE PROPOSED ROAD DIET FOR GREEN AND EHRHARDT, AND MOVE THE SIDEWALK AT HURON HIGH SCHOOL, AND THE PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE PARK PARKING ACROSS FM KERRYTOWN. I THINK OUR PROCESSES COULD BE IMPROVED ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF NEIGHBOR HOOD ENGAGEMENT. THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT NOT BE THE ANSWER BUT IT CAN'T HURT. THANK YOU AGAIN TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND THE OTHER SPONSORS FOR MAKING WHAT I BELIEVE ARE POSITIVE REVISIONS TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:00:52.790: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:00:54.191: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I FIND MYSELF AGREEING COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S SENTIMENTS BUT WON'T VOTE THE WAY. I THINK I THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPRT WITH HOW WE ENGAGEMENT THE PUBLIC. I DON'T THINK ADDING THIS BODY IS THAT SOLUTION. I THINK WE HAVE WOULD BODIES CURRENTLY THAT ALREADY SATISFY THIS WORKLOAD. THE FIRST IS THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, WHICH IS A GROUP OF CITIZEN VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE THEMSELVES TRANSPORTATION EXPERTS, WHO WORK CLOSELY WITH CITY STAFF, PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS, TRANSPORTATION EXPERTS TO REVIEW OUR POLICIES AND OUR PLANS AND PUT FORWARD RECOMMENDATIONS TO CITY COUNCIL FOR OUR ULTIMATE DECISION MAKING. THESE ARE RESIDENTS WHO VOLUNTEER THEIR TAME. THESE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE SPENT THEIR CAREERS AND THEIR LIVES DEVELOPING EDUCATIONS AND WORK EXPERIENCES THAT ALLOW THEMSELVES EXPERTISE. AND WORK CLOSELY IN COORDINATION WITH ENGINEERS WHO HAVE THE PRECISE TECHNICAL SKILLS TO GIVE US GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS. MANY OF THE -- MANY OF THE PROJECTS CITED JUST A MOMENT AGO WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS. I THINK WAYS IN WHICH WE ENGAGE THE PUBLIC CAN BE DONE BETTER, BUT I THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE SOUND. THEY JUST DIDN'T MEET THE PERSONAL OPINIONS AND BIASES OF SOME INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS, WHICH IS FINE AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY OUR AUTHORITY. I THINK THE SECOND BODY THAT ALREADY ACCOMPLISHES THIS WORK IS THE COUNCIL'S COMMITTEE ON POLICY AND ADVOCACY. WE HAVE A SUBSET OF THIS BODY THAT MEETS REGULARLY TO DISCUSS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COUNTY AND THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT AFFECTS THE WAY WE DO OUR WORK AND ADVOCATES TO -- TO THOSE BODIES AND HELPS TO WRITE RESOLUTIONS THAT CITY COUNCIL REVIEWS AND PASSES AND PASSES ALONG TO THE STATE LEGISLATURES AND FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES. I THINK WE ARE A BUREAUCRACY. OUR JOB HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BUREAUCRACY DOES A QUALITY JOB AND MAKE SURE IT'S GOOD FOR BUREAUCRACY. THE ROLES ARE DISTINCT AND THE CHAINS OF COMMAND ARE CLEAR AND THINGS GET DONE RIGHT AND WELL. OUTSIDERS CAN EASILY PROVIDE INPUT AND OVERSIGHT. IT'S CLEAR WHEN THERE ARE IMPORTANT DECISIONS TO BE MADE AND PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO -- TO INSERT THEIR VIEWPOINTS. AND BUREAUCRACY WORKS WELL WHEN IT'S RESPONSIBLE AND INNOVATIVE. IT STAYS LEAN. IT DOESN'T GROW UNNECESSARILY SO THAT IT CAN STAY RESPONSIVE AND AGILE TO CHANGING NEEDS, AND IT SAVES MONEY. BUREAUCRACY DOESN'T WORK WELL WHEN IT CREATES UNNECESSARY REDUNDANCY. THIS IS BECAUSE REDUNDANCY CREATES CONFUSION ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT? REDUNDANCY CONFUSES THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHERE ADVOCACY SHOULD BE DIRECTED AND IT DILUTES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT ADVOCACY WHEN IT IS DIRECTED AND IT WASTES MONEY. ASKING TWO SETS OF PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME TASK WASTES MONEY. ASKING THREE SETS OF PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME TASK REALLY WASTES MONEY. SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED BODIES THAT ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS AND I DON'T WANT TO GROW OUR BUREAUCRACY FOR NO CLEAR REASON.
01:04:26.770: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:04:27.971: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I THINK THE LAST TIME THIS CAME FORWARD, MY READ ON IT WAS THAT IF ALL THE WORDS WERE CHANGED I WOULD SUPPORT IT. SO WHILE I DO APPRECIATE THAT SOME OF THE WORDS WERE CHANGED, AND, YOU KNOW, TO ME THIS IS STILL AN EXERCISE IN REDUNDANCY. WHEN I LOOK AT THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE COMPRISED SOLELY OF COUNCILMEMBERS, IT IS TYPICALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE COMMITTEES -- THOSE COMMITTEES ARE MEANT TO DO THE WORK OF COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE, AND THE COUNCIL RULES THEY ARE MADE UP WITH COUNCILMEMBERS WITH STAFF SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE WORK THAT WE DO AS A BODY. IN OTHER AREAS WHERE WE NEED THAT OUTSIDE EXPERTISE, AS I THINK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ALREADY OUTLINED, QUITE ELOQUENTLY, WE BRING IN THOSE VOLUNTEERS AND THERE ARE COSTS TO THAT. WE HAVE STAFF TIME TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS. THEY OFTEN NEED FURTHER INFORMATION. THEY ARE USING OUR CITY BUILDINGS. SO WHILE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THOSE VOLUNTEERS, THERE ARE TIMES -- THERE'S TIME ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND THEIR TIME WHICH WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT, THEY ARE GIVING TO THE CITY. SO I WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS. I THINK THAT IT DEFINITELY OVERSTEPS OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY. IT STEPS ON THE WORK OF OTHERS AND IT'S JUST -- IT SEEMS COMPLETELY REDUNDANT.
01:05:57.227: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:05:58.662: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WOULD LIKE TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON BUREAUCRACY. BUREAUCRACY IS FULL OF REDUNDANCY. IT IS THE DEFINITION OF REDUNDANCY MANY TIMES. AND SO I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH HAVING A SECOND AND THIRD LAYER WHEN IT COMES TO THESE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. WE ARE BEING ASKED TO DO POLICY ON MANY DIFFERENT AREAS. AND A LOT OF THESE AREAS IN OUR LAP AND THERE'S AN INNER RELATIONSHIP WITH MOBILITY, WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE ACTION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, EQUITY, TRANSPORTATION, OF COURSE. SO I FEEL THAT WE ARE AT ODDS AND WE ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN THINGS COME TO US HERE, AND SOME OF IT HAS NOT BEEN FLESHED OUT. AND THEN MORE OF WHAT SOME WILL DESCRIBE AS DYSFUNCTION OCCURS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. I THINK WE NEED TO -- TO SET POLICY WHEN IT. COULDS TO MOBILITY. IT'S BEEN A MISHMASH FOR THE LAST, FIVE, TEN YEARS. AND I APOLOGIZE. I'M NOT, YOU KNOW, BLAMING ANYONE OR POINTING FINGERS BUT WE HAVE A MISHMASH GOING ON AND IT'S RESULTED IF A LOT OF FRUSTRATION. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, AND A LOT OF FINE MEMBERS WHERE COMMUNITIES SERVE ON IT, BUT WE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS. WE ARE THE ONES BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WE GET THE EMAILS. WE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE TOLD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT? OR WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? SO I THINK IN THE LONG RUN, THIS WILL HELP IRON OUT THE DIFFERENCES AND THE WRINKLESSEN ATHE MISUNDERSTANDING AND ADD THE LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY SO WHEN ITS TO THIS TABLE WE HAVE A MUCH MORE REFINED POLICY TO APPROVE OR NOT APPROVE. WE ARE ALL PAID SALARY AND WE WILL NOT HAVE MORE EXPENSE TO SIT ON A BOARD ONCE A MONTH. I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT.
01:08:48.698: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT A COUPLE OF STATEMENTS AND I'M LOOKING RIGHT HERE AT THE CHARTER OR CHARGE. IT SHOULD BE 11 VOTING MEMBERS. APPOINTMENTS SHOULD BE INDIVIDUALS WHO IN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE VARIOUS FORMS AND CODES OF INFORMATION. -- MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. THERE'S NO EXPERTISE REQUIRED BY MEMBERS OF TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. IT MAY BE A NEGATIVE IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE, BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION -- AND LET ME BE VERY BLUNT, BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING IN OUR CROSSWALKS, AND WE'RE UP HERE PLAYING A SILLY TURF GAME AND POLITICS. WE DO NOT HAVE AN ENGINEER ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THAT SITS ON IT, NOR DO WE HAVE A COMMUNITY MEMBER WHO IS AN ENGINEER. NOT EVEN A COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEER WHO HAS A LOGICAL, ANALYTICAL ABILITY, BECAUSE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO HAVE A COMMISSION WITH AN ID IDEOLOGICAL FOCUS IFU DON'T HAVE ANY ANALYTICAL PEOPLE ON IT. SO WE HAVE NO EXPERTISE. AND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF REDUNDANCY, BUT GIVEN OUR CRASH RATE, ARE WE GOING TO WORRY ABOUT STEPPING ON A FEW TOES OR SHOULD WE HAVE ALL HANDS ON DECK AND LET'S GET OUR CRASH RATE DOWN?
01:10:22.592: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:10:30.734: >> Councilmember Smith: YEAH. I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS. WHAT CONCERNS ME MOST ABOUT IT IS NUMBER ONE, THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME -- THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHEN THIS BODY GOES OUT AND ADVOCATES AND INTERACTS WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND MUNICIPALITIES, IF THEY ARE AUTHORIZED BY THE ENTIRE COUNCIL OR NOT, AND I BRING THIS UP, BECAUSE I THINK WE DO HAVE A DISCONNECT. WE HAVE  A FUNDAMENTAL DISCONNET ON THIS COUNCIL ABOUT OUR CROSSWALK LAW. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND I COMPLETELY DISAGREE. SHE HAS LOBBIED ENDLESSLY IN LANSING TO CREATE A STATE LAW THAT WOULD OVERTURN OUR LOCAL CROSSWALK LAW. THE ISSUE IS, OUR CROSSWALK LAW IS OUR POLITY. AND TO OVERTURN THAT POLICY LOCALLY, YOU NEED TO GET EIGHT VOTED TO OVERTURN A MAYORAL VETO. AND TO DATE, THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. I'M UP COMFORTABLE IN SETTING UP A BODY THAT CAN GO OUT AND ADVOCATE FOR THINGS, THAT IS NOT CLEAR FROM COMING FROM THE BODY AS A WHOLE. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT SUPPORTING THIS.
01:11:56.820: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:11:57.754: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE CHARTER LANGUAGE OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE DOESN'T CALL FOR EXPERTISE. I KNOW THAT, BECAUSE I WROTE IT. YYLUCKILY, WE LIVE IN THE MOST EDUCATED CITY IN THE COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE APPLICATIONS FROM PEOPLE WHO NOW COMPROMISE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. AND WHILE -- WELL, ACTUALLY BEING I'M NOT EVEN SURE IT'S TRUE THAT NONE OF THEM ARE MEAN ENGINEER. I THINK THERE IS AN ENGINEER. CITY ENGINEERS ATTEND THE MEETING REGULARLY, ALONG WITH POLICE OFFICERS, TO GIVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OF A COMPLEX ISSUE, WHICH IS HOW DO WE MAKE PEOPLE SAFER ON OUR PUBLIC STREETS AND SIDEWALKS? AND, YEAH, LET'S MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS AN ENGINEER. I'M PRETTY SURE THERE IS. BUT THERE ARE NOT ANY ENGINEERS HERE EITHER. THERE'S A CONTRACTOR AND FINANCIAL ADVOCATE AND STUDENT ADVISOR, A BUSINESS CONSULTANT, THREE LAWYERS, AN URBAN PLANNER AND A RESTAURANT OWNER. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE ENGINEERS EITHER AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW FIVE OF US IN A ROOM ARE GOING TO BE MAKING BETTER DECISIONS THAN ENGINEERS ADVISED BY TRANSPORT EXPERTS WHO ARE ALSO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND RESIDENTS. I THINK WHAT THAT DOES IS GIVE US MORE POWER, WHICH I DON'T THINK IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE NEED. I THINK WE NEED MORE VOICES IN THE CONVERSATION, RECOMMENDING BEST PRACTICES BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN CONSULTATION WITH POLICE OFFICERS AND ENGINEERS, WHO ARE PROFESSIONALS, TRAINED IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AND CERTIFIED BY STATE AGENCIES. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. THIS DISTRACTS FROM THAT. THIS GIVES US TOO MUCH POWER AND THIS IS NOT GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFER. IT WILL CREATE REDUNDANCY, WHICH WE SHOULD STRIVE TO REDUCE. JUST BECAUSE BUREAUCRACY HAS REDUNDANCY DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD PERPETUATE THAT. WE ARE HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CITY HALL OPERATES AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND INCREASE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. JUST BECAUSE THE BUREAUCRACY HAS A PROBLEM DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD PERPETUATE IT.
01:14:12.589: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:14:14.691: >> Councilmember Grand: ANOTHER REASON I WILL DIDN'T GET TO MENTION EARLIER AND IT TROUBLES ME THAT WE WANT TO HAVE THIS LAYER AND THIS IDEA THAT WE KEEP -- THAT HAVING FIVE COUNCILMEMBERS AROUND A TABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES KEEPS US SAFER. IF WE STARTED LISTENING TO OUR ENGINEERS MORE EVERY TIME THEY TOLD US TO PUT IN A SIDEWALK OR WHERE THE BIKE LANE SHOULD GO OR WHERE WE CAN -- YOU KNOW, HOW WE CAN HELP CARS DRIVE A LITTLE SLOWER OR BE AWARE OF WHERE PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY, MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE FEWER CRASHES. THE IDEA THAT NONE OF US ARE AWARE THAT -- OR THAT NOT ALL OF US ARE AWARE THAT WE HAVE ISSUES WITH OUR STREETLIGHTS IN THE CITY IS, FRANKLY, INSULTING. I THINK WHAT WE ARE MISSING HERE IS THAT WE HAVE THE POWER AS COUNCILMEMBERS TO DO WHAT WE WERE ELECTED TO DO. I HAVE NEVER AT THIS TABLE TURNED DOWN AN IDEA THAT I DIDN'T THINK WAS GOOD FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THIS CITY. I DON'T CARE WHERE IT COMES FROM. IF YOU HAVE ON AI AN IDEA TO MAE US SAFER. YOU HAVE THE POWER TO BRING FORWARD A RESOLUTION OR BRING FORWARD AN ORDINANCE CHANGE AND IF YOU CAN CONVINCE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER REQUIRED, WHETHER IT BE SIX, SEVEN, A OR EIGHT AT THIS TABLE, THEN DO IT. STOP COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE IS TRYING TO THWART YOUR PROCESS OR BLAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR -- JUST STOP. ACTUALLY I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. IT'S MESSY. THERE'S A REASON THAT IT'S MESSY. PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE IDEAS TO BRING FORWARD ARE BLAMING OTHERS AND INSTEAD, LET'S COME FORWARD AND BRING FORWARD IDEAS. IF WE HAVE IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES OR ABOUT HOW TO KEEP US SAFER. AND IF YOU BRING THAT FORWARD AND I THINK IT WILL ACTUALLY KEEP PEOPLE SAFER, I WILL BE FIRST IN LINE TO SUPPORT IT.
01:16:08.304: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, HAYNER.
01:16:10.306: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF AMBIVALENT ON THIS. I SIT ON SEVEN COUNCIL ASSIGNMENTS AND EIGHT IF YOU COUNT MY CARD GROUP, FIGHTING FOR THE GELMAN ISSUE, THE GELMAN CLEANUP. YOU WOULDN'T BE THRILLED AT PUTTING MY NAME IN THE HAT OF BEING FIVE OF 11 THAT HAVE TO SIT ON ANOTHER BOARD OR COMMISSION. AND I KNOW NOT EVERYBODY HAS THIS MANY, AND I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO HAVE THOSE ASSIGNMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO SERVE IN THOSE ROLES. BUT I DON'T SEE A REAL PROBLEM WITH GIVING ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND IF A LITTLE BIT LATER ON, WE ARE GOING TO BE SPEAKING TO -- WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THE CLERK'S REPORT AND UNDERNEATH THE CLERK'S REPORT IS F-1, 2019 ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH COULD BE AN ANNUAL REPORT FROM ANYTHING. BUT WHAT IT IS, IS AN ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE, WHICH IS NOT TITLED PROPERLY. BEFORE THIS IS ENTERED INTO THE RECORD, I THINK IT SHOULD BE TITLED PROPERLY SO PEOPLE CAN FIND IT, SO THE PUBLIC CAN FIND IT. THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING WE TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND WE HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE THAT'S NOT TITLED PROPERLY. BE THAT AS IT MAY. THE REASON I BRING THAT UP, THERE ARE THINGS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT, IF YOU READ THROUGH IT THAT KIND OF MAKE STATEMENTS THAT REALLY AREN'T ACCURATE. LIKE, ONE IS A NUMBER OF CITY COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE PROMOTED HOUSE BILL 4738 DESPITE IT WAS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE WILL OF THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC. THAT'S A BOLD STATEMENT FOR A COMMISSION TO MAKE, THAT THEY ARE ASSESSING THE WILL OF THE PUBLIC. AND FRANKLY, I THINK IT'S CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATION -- REPRESENTATIVES' JOB TO ASSESS THE WILL OF THE PUBLIC AND BRING IT FORWARD. AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT THEY ARE ADAMANT ABOUT PROTECTING THIS LOCAL CROSSWALK ORDINANCE, BUT I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S SUGGESTING THAT THEY HAD THEIR FINGER ON THE PULSE OF THE PUBLIC IS A REACH. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THE ORIGIN OF THIS RESOLUTION THAT'S BEFORE US NOW COMES FROM. THAT THERE'S CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE THESE SMALL -- MANY SMALL BODIES OPERATING HERE INSIDE CITY COUNCIL WITH OR WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE COUNCIL BODY AS A WHOLE, THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE BASED IN REALITY. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S TRUE AND YOU POINTED IT OUT, THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE THIS CROSSWALK LAW THAT PEOPLE ARE SO ADAMANT ABOUT, THE VALUE TO OR COMMUNITY, EVEN THOUGH IT STATISTICALLY IS NOT SHOWN TO BE SO, IT ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE OF A VETO. THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO SAID, WE DON'T WANT THIS CROSSWALK. WE WANT TO MAKE A MINOR CHANGE TO, TO KEEP IT MORE IN LINE WELL TRENDS OF THE STATE. AND THERE WERE NOT EIGHT TO OVERRIDE THAT. AND SO I -- I THINK THAT CROSSWALK LAW ITSELF EXISTS ON THIS KIND OF POLITICAL FRINGE AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT STATE LAWS THAT ARE TAUGHT BY THE BODIES LIKE THE SECRETARY OF STATE WOULD ISSUED DRIVER'S LICENSES ARE PROBABLY OF A GREATER VALUE TO THE WHOLE THAN INDIVIDUAL LAWS IN EACH CITY. BUT WE'RE NOT HERE TO DISCUSS THAT. WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS THIS RESOLUTION. AND SO I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH HAVING MORE HEADS IN THE MIX, AND MORE MINDS THINKING ABOUT THESE PROJECTS. WE ARE GOING TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THESE OTHER GROUPS. THEY ARE FREE TO OPERATE WITH THEIR OWN AUTONOMY, AND ISSUE THEIR OWN ANNUAL REPORTS. I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SO INTERESTED IN SHRINING THAT ADVOCACY WITH CERTAIN GROUPS IS A BIGGER CONCERN TO ME. THANK YOU.
01:19:59.402: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:20:03.873: >> Councilmember Lumm: I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S FEEDBACK. AND I AM ALL FOR A LEANER BUREAUCRACY, IF YOU WILL. AND THIS DOES ADD ANOTHER LAYER AND I WOULD -- I WOULD HOPE GOING FORWARD THAT NO MATTER THE MOBILITY ISSUE OR CONCERN, THAT EACH RESPECTIVE COUNCILMEMBER WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE ABILITY TO INTERACT AS THEY DO TODAY, WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND ADVOCATE FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND TO THAT END, I WILL JUST ALSO SHARE THAT -- WHEN COUNCILMEMBERS ARE CRITICIZED FOR NOT SUPPORTING A GIVEN, SAY, STAFF RECOMMENDATION, FOR QUESTIONING A STAFF RECOMMENDATION, I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR. I THINK THAT'S A COUNCILMEMBER -- THAT COUNCILMEMBER WHO QUESTIONS, WHO ADVOCATES FOR A DIFFERENT APPROACH, IS DOING THEIR JOB. AND -- AND THIS CRITICISM IS ALSO NOT APPLIED UNIFORMLY. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE BEN HUR OF A SOLID WASTE STUDY THAT WE JUST COMPLETED, WHICH I SUPPORTED, OKAY. THAT WAS -- THAT WAS A COMPILATION OF A LOT OF EXCELLENT STAFF WORK AND RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THE SAME FOLKS SITTING AT THIS TABLE, WHO CRITICIZE COUNCILMEMBERS ONE DAY OR NIGHT FOR NOT SUPPORTING AND FOR QUESTIONING STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE MOBILITY UNIVERSE, HAD NO ISSUE WITH NOT SUPPORTING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME FROM THE SOLID WASTE CONSULTANT STUDY WHICH WAS EXHAUSTIVE AND VERY THOROUGH. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE DOG FOOD, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE DOG FOOD, THEN -- THEN IT IS OR ISN'T OKAY TO CRITICIZE YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR SUPPORTING A STAFF RECOMMENDATION OR NOT. AND I JUST -- THAT LACK OF CONSISTENCY, I FIND, OBVIOUSLY, CONCERNING AND TROUBLESOME. AND SO ON THIS, I, AGAIN, JUST WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS -- IF THIS PASSES, THAT THE COUNCILMEMBERS CONTINUE TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE IN ANY MOBILITY ISSUES THAT IN PARTICULAR IMPACT THE AREAS, THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY REPRESENT. THAT'S -- THAT'S US DOING OUR JOBS. THANK YOU.
01:23:02.952: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I WILL VOTE AGAINST THIS AND THEN I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE NEXT. I HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THIS OVERLAPS WITH THE WORK PERCEIVED IN ACTUAL -- OR THE ROLE OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I THINK WE OWE OUR RESIDENT VOLUNTEERS, WE OWE OUR COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS OUR EARNED RESPECT AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE THRUST OF THIS CONVERSATION ACHIEVES THAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULARS OF THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE, IT'S OVERREACHING AND PECULIARLY LIMITED. FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE ESTABLISHES THE COMMITTEE AND THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE SAYS IT WILL ADVISE THE COUNCIL. OKAY. THE THIRD RESOLVE COUNCIL IS IT DOCUMENTS ENGAGEMENT, RATHER THAN ACTUALLY DOING ENGAGEMENT. FOURTH RESOLVE CLAUSE SAYS THAT STAFF WILL REPORT ABOUT ENGAGEMENT. IT'S SO OPAQUE THAT IT -- I THINK IT'S AT RISK OF EXTENDING BEYOND ITS -- BEYOND ITS SCOPE. I'M MOST CONCERNED WITH RESOLVE CLAUSE NUMBER THREE. WE ALREADY HAVE REPRESENTATIVES ON SEMCOG, AND COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE AVAILABLE TO GO TO WATTS AND SPARK AND D.D.A. AND WE HAVE STAFF MEMBERS THAT WORK WITH MDOT ALL THE TIME. AND STAFF MEMBERS AND US AS ELECTED OFFICIALS ENGAGING WITH FOLKS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. AND MEMBERS THE WASHTENAW COUNTY COMMISSION. DELEGATING THAT TO A NUMBER OF COUNCILMEMBERS IN CONNECTION WITH MOBILITY, I THINK, UNDERCUTS THE -- UNDERCUTS OUR ABILITY TO ACT, UNDERCUTS STAFF'S ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE WOULD ACHIEVE A REAL DISSERVICE. FURTHER, IT IS TRUE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE PAID ANY EXTRA IN THE EVENT THAT SOME OF US SIT ON A MOBILITY COMMITTEE, HOWEVER, IF WE ARE GOING TO EXPECT STAFF TO SHOW UP WITH ANYTHING BESIDES, YOU KNOW, A PEN AND PAPER TO TAKE NOTES, THAT HAS REAL COST. AND, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT ENGINEERS COMING AND SHOWING US ALL THE MOBILITY-RELATED PROPROJECTS. IS THIS COMMITTEE GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO BIKE LANES AND SIDEWALKS AND STREET LIGHTS? IF WE ARE, THEN THAT'S A HEAVILY STAFFED FUNCTION. IF WE ARE NOT, GOODNESS, WHAT IS THE POINT? DC-7 CAN AFFECT CHANGE AND ACTION IN THIS AREA. IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. YOU COME UP WITH AN IDEA AND YOU PUT TOGETHER A RESOLUTION AND ASK COUNCILMEMBERS TO SUPPORT IT. IT SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE. AND THE STRUCTURES CREATED BY THIS -- BY THIS DRAFT, BY THIS COMMITTEE, I THINK, UNDERCUT OUR ABILITY TO DO OUR WORK, UNDERCUT STAFF AND UNDERCUT THE -- THE COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS THAT WE HAVE ASKED TO STAFF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. OTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:26:24.353: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL SPEAK AFTER.
01:26:26.822: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:26:28.557: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST A CLERICAL MENTION THAT BEFORE WE VOTE, WE SHOULD -- IN THE WHEREAS CLAUSE 4 AND 6, THERE'S A TYPO AT THE START OF BOTH OF THOSE. I THINK IT SHOULD BE GO DOWN AS SCRIVENER. INSTEAD OF SAYING ANN ARBOR, IT SAYS ARBOR ARBOR.
01:26:50.746: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:26:52.114: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: APPRECIATE THE SECOND TIME TO TALK ON THIS. YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL HERE AND WE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. IN FACT, IT WAS ONE OF MY CAMPAIGN POINTS WAS THAT WE NEEDED MORE DIVERSITY ON THIS COUNCIL BEFORE 2018. AND I WILL STAND BY THAT. AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY BEEN TUMULTUOUS AT THIS TIME. WE ARE FLESHING THINGS OUT AND WE ARE HAVING OPEN, HONEST DISCUSSIONS FOR MANY OF THESE ISSUES AND QUESTIONING WHERE WE STAND AND BEING CALLED TO WHY WE HAVE TAKEN THINGS AND BEING FORCED TO EXPLAIN THEM. AND I'M FINE WITH THAT. BUT THIS DISCUSSION THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD SOMEHOW UNDERMINE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, WHERE IS THAT SPEAR UTILITY COMING FROM? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT ISN'T WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM, AND IT'S BEING PORTRAYED IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT. THIS SHOULD HELP THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IF WE ARE DOING OUR JOBS. AND I WILL PUSH BACK ON ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES, WHEN I'M UP HERE, I'M NOT A RESTAURANT OWNER. I'M AN ELE ELECTED OFFICIAL. I'M NOT HERE SELLING FOOD RIGHT NOW. I'M HERE SERVING MY CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU.
01:28:22.304: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? PERHAPS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI RAISED AN INTERESTING QUESTION. MAY I HAVE A MOTION. WOULD SOMEONE CONSIDER REFERRING THIS TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FOR THEIR REVIEW? FURTHER -- IS THERE A SECOND? NO SECOND. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:29:03.078: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:29:05.748: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:29:09.184: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
01:29:09.985: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.

01:29:17.760: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:29:19.528: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
01:29:21.296: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:29:24.366: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-2, RESOLUTION FOR CITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS. MOVED BY GRISWOLD, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION OF DC-2. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:29:35.577: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL JUST SAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN REVISED SIGNIFICANTLY AND IT NOW HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THE CITY ATTORNEY. SO GIVEN THE TIME AND HOW MUCH WE HAVE SPENT ON THE OTHER RESOLUTION, THIS IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE TONIGHT THAT THERE'S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OUR COMMUNICATIONS. THAT'S ALL I WILL SAY.
01:30:00.636: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES]
01:30:07.576: >> Councilmember Grand: I WANT A ROLL CALL.
01:30:09.945: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY, ROLL CALL.
01:30:11.213: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:30:14.483: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:30:16.652: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.

01:30:26.094: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
01:30:27.830: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:30:31.500: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-13, RESOLUTION URGING THE CITY TO COMPILE AND DISSEMINATE EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH MATERIALS ABOUT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES AND TURF GRASS REDUCTION STRATEGIES TO OWNERS OF TURF GRASS WITHIN THE CITY. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:30:48.417: >> Councilmember Bannister: THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THANK ON THIS RESOLUTION, AND THIS IS PART TWO IN THE SERIES. YOU ALL MAY RECALL LAST JULY WHEN ALANA DeRIGGI, WARD ONE RESIDENT BROUGHT FORTH THE IDEA TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION THAT WE WOULD URGE THE WASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION TO REDUCE HERBICIDE SPRAYING ALONG THE ROADSIDE, AND SO WE PASSED THAT AND SENT IT ON TO OVER TO THE WASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION. AND AT THAT TIME, WE PROMISED THAT WE WOULD COME BACK AND EXPAND THAT, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING TONIGHT, WHERE AGAIN, ALANA DeRIGGI AND OTHERS RITA MITCHELL AND CHRISTOPHER GRAHAM AND EMILY DRINAN, THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, WE PUT A WHOLE LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THIS IDEA. AND WHAT WE ARE PLANNING, IT'S AN EDUCATION AND OUTREACH RESOLUTION, WHERE WE WOULD USE EXISTING POLICIES FROM THE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OF THE NATURAL AREA OF PRESERVATION GROUP AND OUR PARKS DEPARTMENT AND INCLUDE THOSE MATERIALS IN MORE OF OUR EXISTING OUTREACH, INCORPORATED INTO -- OUR EXISTING OUTREACH EVENTS AND DEPARTMENTAL COMMUNICATIONS. SO THE STAFF TIME AND THE EXPENSE WOULD, MINIMAL, AND -- AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT PESTICIDES, INCLUDING HERBICIDES, FUNGICIDES AND INSECTICIDES USED ON TURF GRASS ARE HARMFUL TO WILDLIFE AND BEES AND POLLINATORS AND HUMANS. AND SO WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS AND LARGE OWNERS OF TURF GRASS PROPERTIES TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE METHODS.
01:32:56.912: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:32:58.146: >> Councilmember Smith: JACKIE, COULD YOU PLEASE ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR. I MISSED THE DEAD LINE ON THAT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE STEP VOLUNTEERS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU PUT IN IN GETTING US TO THIS POINT. IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED. THIS MOVES US FORWARD IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY.
01:33:15.931: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL.
01:33:19.034: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:33:25.340: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE A COSPONSOR. AND ALSO TO FOLLOW-UP ON A SPEAKER'S SUGGESTION THAT -- I DON'T KNOW THE HE CAN MECHANIC NEXT FOR, THIS BUT I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE AND I THINK THAT THE SCIENCE POINTS TO THE NOTION THAT SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS THAT WE USE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT ARE PRETTY BAD. ROUNDUP IS PRETTY TERRIBLE. IT'S EXCESSIVE AND OUR FOLKS HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB OF REDUCING OUR USE OVER HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MAKERS TO REALLY VERY LITTLE -- ACRES TO REALLY VERY LITTLE. HARDLY ANY AT ALL. IF WE CAN DO IT, ANYBODY ELSE CAN DO. OUR PARKS AND GOLF COURSES ARE EXCELLENT. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE HAVE A THIRD ROUND OF THIS, AND I'M ALSO CONSIDERING REVISITING THE CHANGES THAT WERE, YOU KNOW, MADE ABOUT WHAT, SIX, SEVEN YEARS NOW TO CHAPTER 40, 316, WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE TURF GRASS HEIGHTS AND SO ON. WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO GET BACK TO IS ENCOURAGING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS. I HAVE SEEN IN EUROPEAN CITIES AND OTHER CITIES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT THEY ARE ENCOURAGING AND ENPAYING RESIDENTS TO REPLANT THEIR YARDS WITH POLLEN INTERROR FRIENDLY TIME GARDENS. AND I THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE NOW THAT BUMBLE BOO BUMBLEBEESARE ON THE ENDANGEREDS LIST. I WILL TAKE A HARD LOOK AND HOPEFULLY GET SOMETHING OVER TO E.C. AND WORK WITH YOU FOLKS BETTER TO TAKE A LOOK AT CHAPTEO COURAGE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LOOKING AT OUR SOMEWHAT BUILT ENVIRONMENT OR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S BETWEEN NATURAL AND BUILT. AND REALLY PEOPLE SET IN THEIR FRONT YARDS AND BACKYARDS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THAT'S BETTER FOR EVERYBODY. SO I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THIS. HAD THANK YOU.
01:35:07.542: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:35:08.543: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, TO COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE THE LIAISONS AND THE STAFF THAT WILL IMPLEMENT THIS. ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I HAD A CONSTITUENT REACH OUT WHO IS DEALING WITH ASTHMA WHO WAS DEALING WITH PESTICIDES. THEN YOU RUN INTO BAD STATE LAW. THE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN, TRYING TO ENCOURAGE OUR NEIGHBORS NOT TO USE THESE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS, DANGEROUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT ALSO DANGEROUS FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE HEALTH ISSUES. IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT. SO THANKS FOR THE STEP FORWARD.
01:35:46.581: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:35:49.384: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. JUST ECHOING THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY, A GREAT STEP FORWARD AND GETTING TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I'M SURPRISED THIS HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN DONE. SO I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK BY THE COMMUNITY AND BY THE MEMBERS OF THIS BOARD. AND HE JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD. THANK YOU.
01:36:14.075: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-4 RESOLUTION TO REVISE 2020 COUNCIL CALENDAR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SECONDED BY NELSON. DISCUSSION OF DC-4? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-5, ARE E SOLUTION TO ADOPT THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALOYANCE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLEDGE. MOVED BY GRAND AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF DC-5? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN -- GRAND.
01:36:42.237: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I'M HONORED TO BRING THIS FORWARD TONIGHT WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND MAYOR TAYLOR. THIS WAS -- THIS IS A MUCH BROADER EFFORT THAT'S BEING SPEAR HEADED BY THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE ANTHER CIRCULATING THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLEDGE. AT THE LAST MEETING OF THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION, THEY ARE TRYING TO GET BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO SIGN ON. SO I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO PLEASE DO SO. BUT THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY SIGNED ON AND MADE THE REQUEST OF ME AS THE LIAISON TO BRING THIS FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL THAT WE AS AN ORGANIZATION CAN SUPPORT IT. AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN ME. RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 ORGANIZATIONS AND HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS WOULD SIGNED THIS PLEDGE. AND I THINK THE VALUES THAT IT REPRESENTS ARE IN LINE, HOPEFULLY WITH WHERE WE CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT TO GO FORWARD WITH WHERE WE WANT TO SEE OURSELF GOING IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITY. IN VOTING TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION, WE'LL BE CONFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO A DIVERSITY OF HOUSING TYPES TO URBAN DENSITY, TO UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MARKET ALONE CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THAT WE HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY, IN ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT HOUSING AND CONFIRMING THAT WE WANT TO LOOK THROUGH HOUSING THROUGH THIS LENS OF IMPROVING SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, RACIAL EQUITY, AND WHILE WE MAY TAKE STEPS TO INCREASE HOMEOWNERSHIP, ESPECIALLY FOR CERTAIN MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS OR LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS, THIS ALSO MAKES A STATEMENT ABOUT VALUING THE CONTRIBUTION OF RENTERS, AND SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF TENANTS IN OUR COMMUNITY, AMONG OTHER IMPORTANT VALUES. SO I JUST THANK THE W.H.A. FOR THEIR WORK. I KNOW WE HAVE LOTS OF -- YOU NO HE SOME BOARD MEMBERS AND STAFF FROM THAT ORGANIZATION, WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT WHO PROBABLY COULD ANSWER QUESTIONS BETTER THAN I COULD, IF YOU HAVE THEM, AND I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS.
01:38:47.128: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:38:48.063: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND COUNCILMEMBER GRAND FOR BRINGING THIS FROM THE HOUSING COMMISSION'S BOARD ON WHICH YOU SERVE AND THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND RALLYING THE DIFFERENT GROUPS BEHIND THIS PLEDGE. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE, THEY PARTNER WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TO ENACT POLICIES THAT HELP ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. TONIGHT'S MEASURE IS SYMBOLIC. IT'S SEVEN COMMITMENTS TO THE COMMUNITY ABOUT HOW WE STAND FOR OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THOSE INITIATIVES. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT GESTURE, BUT A GESTURE THAT PASSES TONIGHT AND NEEDS TO BE BACKED UP WITH ONGOING ACTION OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN PARTICULAR, AS WE -- AS WE W WEIGH AND MAKE DECISIONS ON BUILDING ON PUBLICLY OWNED LAND ACROSS THE CITY. THANKS.
01:39:54.062: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:39:54.929: >> Counc
01:39:55.830: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE IT -- GIVE IT TO SMITH AND THEN COME BACK TO ME.
01:40:00.869: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNSEL, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:40:02.103: >> Councilmember Smith: PLEASE ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR. AND MS. CARLISLE, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU HER. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO SIGN THIS INDIVIDUALLY.
01:40:13.915: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:40:14.783: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL THANK YOU. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR TO THIS. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND ACKERMAN BRINGING IT FORTH AND WASHTENAW COUNTY HOUSING ALLIANCE. THIS IS A SERIOUS PLEDGE. ONE THAT, AGAIN, I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN IS ALL WE HAVE IN THIS LIFE IS YOUR WORD. AND TAKING THIS PLEDGE, I BELIEVE ALL OF OUR DECISIONS, MY DECISIONS WILL HAVE THIS EMBEDDED IN IT AND I WILL BE LOOKING THROUGH THOSE VOTES WITH THIS. IT GOES BACK TO THE LAST MAJOR SIGNIFICANT PLEDGE, WHICH WAS THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. SO WHEN WE TAKE THESE PLEDGES, THEY ARE NOT TAKING -- I DON'T TAKE THEM LIGHTLY. I ADD MYSELF, AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR BUT I WANT TO CAUTION THE FACT THAT WE STILL NEED TO OPERATE WITHIN OUR CITY CHARTER. WE STILL NEED TO OPERATE WITHIN OUR MASTER PLAN. AND THOSE ARE PLEDGES THAT I ALSO MADE. AND SO I DON'T WANT TO BE ATTACHED LATER ON -- ATTACKEDDED LATER ON AND THIS IS THIS IS NOT GOING TO TO. IT. EVEN WITH TAKING THIS PLEDGE, THERE ARE STILL OR DOCUMENTS THAT NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND UPHELD. I THINK BOTH CAN BE DONE AND THAT'S WHY I FEEL COMFORTABLE MAKING THIS STATEMENT. AND THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN.
01:41:50.812: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:41:52.146: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BODY WILL SUPPORT THIS AND WILL BE ON THE RECORD AS SUPPORTING THIS PLEDGE. YOU KNOW, IT'S -- AS OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED, THAT, YOU KNOW, WORDS ARE J JUST WORDS. UNLESS WE BACK THIS UP, IT'S MEANINGLESS. WE DON'T WANT TO CHEAPEN OUR WORDS. WE HAD A PLEDGE 10 HOMELESSNESS AND I WENT THROUGH THAT, IT WAS ABOUT 170 PAGES I THINK IT WAS. A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THERE, A LOT OF PEOPLE'S CONTACT INFORMATION AND WHO WAS GOING TO DO WHAT AND WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN THAT AREA. BUT HOMELESSNESS IS NOT OVER HERE IN THE COUNTY AND THE CITY. AND SO THAT IS A PLEDGE THAT TOOK A LOT OF ACTION BEHIND IT. AND THIS ONE WILL TOO. WHILE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE WILL PASS THIS. I -- I -- I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING IN THIS HERE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S IN HERE. I THINK THAT -- I HAVE SOME PROBLEM WITH THE WAY IT ENHAVE RHINES VALUE IN EARNING FADS AND IT DISCUSSES IN INVESTING WITH DEVELOPERS AND ALBEIT, ONLY THOSE WHO MAKE GUARANTEES TO -- TO, YOU KNOW, MAINTAIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN PERPETUITY BUT WE HAVE SEEN HOW THOSE HAVE NOT WORKED OUT FOR US. SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BUT CERTAINLY THAT IT WOULD NOT BE THE KIND OF THING WE WANT TO SUPPORT. I APPRECIATE FOLKS BRINGING IT FORWARD. I REALLY WANT TO BACK IT UP. WE MADE PLEDGES TO PROVIDE X NUMBER OF UNITS EVERY YEAR AND WE REALLY HAVEN'T DONE IT. WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE IT. IT'S DISAPPOINTING FOR ME. I -- I HAVE DONE SOME THINGS WHILE I HAVE BEEN HERE ON COUNCIL TO PUSH THAT FORWARD. I'M, YOU KNOW, REAL HAPPY WITH OUR WORK TO EXPLORE THESE 11 CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES AND I THINK IT'S A STEP FORWARD FOR US AS A COMMUNITY BUT I WANT TO DO MORE. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I REALLY DID SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND SO I -- I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I SAW SOME STUFF FLOATING AROUND WHERE WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THESE DUPLEX OPTIONS WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO THE CITY. I THINK THAT'S AWESOME. WE WANT TO SEND BACK SOME OTHER THINGS FOR REEVALUATION. YOU KNOW, WAYS TO GET NEW FORMS OF HOUSING AND NEW LAND USE THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND KIND OF TICK ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND COMMUNITY BUTTONS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD FOR ALL. I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT. SO I JUST, YOU KNOW -- WE'LL TAKE THIS PLEDGE BUT I URGE US ALL TO WORK DILIGENTLILY TO SEE IT THROUGH TO THE END. THANK YOU.
01:44:25.700: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:44:27.602: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. I'M PERSONALLY INVOLVED WITH HOMELESSNESS. I WORKED WITH A YOUNG PERSON IN THEIR 20s, WHO WAS HOMELESS FOR OVER TWO MONTHS BEFORE HE WENT TO THE DOLONIC CENTER AND HOUSING WAS FOUND. I'M ALSO WORKING WITH AN 18-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO HAS BEEN COUCH SURFING SINCE OCTOBER AND IS ON THE WAIT LIST FOR OZONE HOUSE. AND I CALL AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK AND PLEAD WITH THEM TO MOVE HER UP ON THE WAIT LIST. SO HOMELESSNESS IS A REAL ISSUE IN THIS COMMUNITY. THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS WE NEED TO FIND CREATIVE, SMART WAYS TO ADD HOUSING WITHOUT MAKING HOMEOWNERSHIP LESS AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE WITH FIXED INCOMES AND THOSE THAT ARE JUST BARELY SCRAPING BY. THANKS.
01:45:18.986: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:45:20.254: >> Councilmember Lumm: I SUPPORT THIS AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES, COUNCILMEMBERS GRAND AND ACKERMAN BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I WILL JUST SAY TOO, AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED PREVIOUSLY, THAT -- AS WITH ANYTHING, THE. DDEVIL IS INTHE DETAILS AND THES THAT WE -- THIS IS LARGELY SYMBOLIC, IN A NICE POSITIVE WAY, AND WHEN WE ACTUALLY -- WHEN TIME COMES TO APPROVE, YOU KNOW, PRO E  PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE BELIEFS OUTLINED IN THIS PLEDGE, THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'LL NEED TO EXERCISE FLEXIBILITY. AND KIND OF TAKE THINGS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXPLANATION FOR BELIEF NUMBER THREE STATES THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHOULD BE TARGETED FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH UP TO 60% OF A.M.I. FOR CENTERS. THIS WEEK -- OR LAST WEEK, I ATTENDED A D.D.A. MEETING AND THEY ARE APPROVING SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AT THAT MEETING, THERE WAS THE CONCERN WAS EXPRESSED AND ENSURED BY MEMBERS OF THE D.D.A. THAT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE A.M.I. TARGET RANGE IS NEEDED TO ENABLE US TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING FOR MORE WORKFORCE HOUSING, JUST BECAUSE THE COST OF HOUSING IS SO COSTLY. AND, OF COURSE, IT'S -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO ASSIST PEOPLE AT THE LOWER INCOME END OF THE SPECTRUM, BUT THE REALITY IS TOO, AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH WE ALSO HAVE TO APPRECIATE, AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS, IS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE WORKFORCE HOUSING, WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT OTHER RANGES. AND, AGAIN, THIS WAS A POINT THAT WAS MADE BY THE -- AT THIS D.D.A. MEETING AND IS BEING CONFRONTED AND -- AND IS -- THE D.D.A. IS TRYING -- WILL BE TRYING TO ADDRESS. SO -- BUT THANK YOU, AGAIN, FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND, OF COURSE, WE SUPPORT IT.
01:47:42.530: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M DELIGHTED TO BRING THIS FORWARD AS WELL WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT'S OBTAINING BROAD SUPPORT. AND I WILL NOTE AND OBSERVE THAT PUTTING THIS PLEDGE INTO EFFECT WILL REQUIRE -- REQUIRE DISRUPTION. DISRUPTION IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DO VERY WELL IN ANN ARBOR, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO DO IF WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THIS TERRIBLY LARGE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM. THINGS -- YOU KNOW, BUSINESS AS USUAL WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE. THE CITY AS WE KNOW IT IS NOT WORKING FOR EVERYONE. AND IN ORDER TO CHANGE THAT, IN ORDER TO AFFECT THE GOALS ARTICULATED HERE IN ORDER TO BRING THE VALUES TO LIFE, ARTICULATED HERE, THINGS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE CANDID ABOUT, AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE STOMACH TO IMPLEMENT WHEN THE TIME COMES. AND I JUST WANT THAT -- THAT FIRMLY STATED AS WE -- AS WE GO FORWARD AND MAKE THIS COMMITMENT. I SHOULD SAY WITH PARTICULARITY, IN MY VIEW THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO BE PRIVILEGE PEOPLE OVER CARS IN. MY VIEW IT MEANS THAT DENSITY IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO COUNT IN AREAS WHERE IT HAS PREVIOUSLY NOT BEEN ACCEPTABLE. IT MEANS THAT CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN -- BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL UNITS HAS TO BE PRIVILEGED. IT MEANS WE NEED TO LOOK AT TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS, AND PROVIDE DENSITY, SUBSTANTIAL DENSITY AT THOSE LOCATIONS. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF, IF WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT ARE ARTICULATED HERE AND ARTICULATED IN OUR OTHER PLANS. AND IT'S GOING TO MEAN DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND I'M LOOKING TO FORWARD TO THAT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. AND DC-6, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE AMENDMENT 1 TO VETERANS TREATMENT COURT GRANT AGREEMENT WITH THE MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT STATE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE AND APPROPRIATE FUNDS. MOVED AND SECONDED.
01:50:03.571: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR.
01:50:06.240: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ BREAK ]
02:05:56.355: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE BACK AFTER A FIRST BREAK. IT'S OBSERVED THAT I FORGOT TO OBSERVE THAT DC-6 WAS PASSED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO DC-6. DC-# 7, RESOLUTION, CONCERNING THE RELIABILITY AND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF DETROIT EDISON STREETLIGHTS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF DC-7. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT'S BEEN OBSERVED, OF COURSE, THAT -- AND HAS BEEN BEMOANED OVER THE YEARS THAT D.T.E. OWNS MANY -- THE MAJORITY OF THE STREETLIGHTS HERE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THAT THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THEM IN A MANNER THAT IS ACCEPTABLE. THEY DO NOT PERMIT US TO UTILIZE L.E.D. TECHNOLOGY, TO SAVE COSTS COSTS, TO SAVE ENERGY. AND WE -- AND WE WISH IT WERE DIFFERENTLY. IT'S A CONSEQUENCE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING HERE IF THIS RESOLUTIONS IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AN INVENTORY OF STREETLIGHTS THAT EXIST. WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND STREETLIGHTS THAT ARE OUT AND WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN ORDER TO HOPEFULLY EFFECT A MECHANISM BY WHICH WE CAN EFFICIENTLY, PROPERLY AND IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER OVERTAKE THE OWNERSHIP OF THESE STREETLIGHTS. WE EXPEND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY EVERY SINGLE YEAR MAINTAINING OUR STREETLIGHTS, ENERGIZING THE STREETLIGHTS. IF WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE CONTROL OVER THIS RESOURCE, WE WOULD BE FAR BETTER OFF, FAR BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY AND FAR BETTER OFF FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SAFETY AND SO I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HELPING TO BRING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND OTHERS WHO HELPED ITS CONCEPTION AND ITS EXECUTION. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:07:52.238: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M DELIGHTED THAT YOU YOU ARE DELID THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY NAME ADDED IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO YOU AS A SPONSOR. SO IT'S GOOD OF YOU TO PLACE THIS ON THE AGENDA. THE CITY DOES WORK HARD TO REPLACE STREET OUTAGES PROMPTLY AND TO DO PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE AND THERE'S NO REASON D.T.E. CAN'T AND SHOULDN'T DO THE SAME. I AGREE WITH THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE, THAT IT'S REALLY ACCEPTABLE THAT D. T.E. IS NOT ASSIGNING AND ALLOCATING THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF RESOURCES REQUIRED TO DO THE JOB. I'M OKAY WITH LOOKING AT PERHAPS PURCHASING THE STREETLIGHTS BUT HONESTLY, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE BETTER OUTCOME IS FOR D.T.E. JUST TO DO THEIR JOB. AND REPLACE OUTAGES PROMPTLY. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
02:08:51.498: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:08:53.967: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I BELIEVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FUTURE RESOLUTION THAT LOOKS AT MOVING TOWARDS MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT LIGHTING, AS WELL AS SOLAR LIGHTING. I HATE TO MICROMANAGE BUT I WOULD LIKE A REPORT ON MEANTIME BETWEEN FAILURE, BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THE STREETLIGHTS THAT ARE THE NEW L.E.D. LIGHTS ESPECIALLIES ON THE FULLER CORRIDOR ARE ONLY REMAINING LILT AND FUNCTIONING FOR A FEW MONTHS AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THE L.E.D. LIGHTS ARE GOING TO HAVE A MUCH LONGER LIFE SPAN THAN THE OTHER LIGHTS. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE LISTENING, IF YOU SEE A STREETLIGHT OUT, PLEASE REPORT IT TO A2 FIX IT. WE DON'T HAVE A WAY OF PROACTIVELY KNOWING THAT THE LIGHTS ARE OUT. LONG-TERM, WE WILL HAVE A IN, AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW IF A LIGHT IS NOT FUNCTIONING AND DRAW ELECTRICITY. SO PLEASE REPORT THOSE TO A2 FIX IT. THANK YOU.
02:10:01.801: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTHers DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:10:04.170: >> Councilmember Smith: NUMBER ONE, PLEASE ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR. AND NUMBER TWO, ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME OF MY DISDAIN FOR D.T.E. [ LAUGHTER ] I AM EXTREMELY TROUBLED BY THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US. THE CASE IN POINT, THE EVERGREENS CIRCUIT ON THE -- ON THE WEST SIDE OF TOWN, WAS NEGLECTED AND NOT UPGRADED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THEIR RESPONSE WAS TO BLAME HOMEOWNERS FOR NOT TRIMMING TREES WHEN THEY HADN'T DONE ANY MAINTENANCE OR UPGRADED THEIR EQUIPMENT. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR LACK OF FOLLOWING THROUGH AND WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. THEY ARE A PUBLIC UTILITY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE. AND I AM -- I WAS THRILLED TO SEE THIS COME FORWARD.
02:10:54.287: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:10:55.521: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE SPONSORS, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. I THINK THIS WILL HELP IN ACHIEVING OUR GOALS FOR CARBONNEAU ELECTRICALLITY. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO MANY OF US THAT D.T.E. HAS TAKEN THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY ENOUGH. THIS WOULD HELP US AND USING RENEWABLE ENERGIES TO POWER THOSE STREET LAMPS. IN ADDITION TO THE UNRELIABILITY OF D.T.E. TO MAINTAIN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE, THIS WILL ALSO HELP US POWER THE STREET LAMPS HOPEFULLY WITH RENEWABLES, SOMETHING THAT D.T.E. IS DRAGGING, KICKING AND SCREAMING THEIR WAY INTO DOING IT. SO I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S PUT INTO THIS AND IT'S DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
02:11:58.017: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:12:00.787: >> Councilmember Bannister: JUST THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE ADD MY NAME. THANK YOU.
02:12:07.994: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR,. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-8, ARE E SO RESOLUTION TO COE THEEL PLOYMENT AGREEMENT WIT CITY ADMINISTRATOR HOWARD LAZARUS. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
02:12:32.518: >> Councilmember Eaton: THIS APPROVES A SEPARATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY AND OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT IS REALLY THE CULMINATION OF A VERY LONG DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD -- WE HAVE HAD THAT REALLY BEGAN SHORTLY AFTER WE LEARNED THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR DID NOT GET A JOB THAT HE APPLIED FOR IN GAINESVILLE. IN THE NEGOTIATION OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR HAS ASKED THAT WE NOT DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE SEEKING THE SEPARATION, AND I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECT THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW HIM THE RESPECT OF A DIGNIFIED DEPARTURE. WHILE THE COUNCIL IS CONCLUDING HIS EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT CAUSE UNDER THE CONTRACT, IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE WE DON'T WISH TO STATE THOSE CAUSES WENT WE DON'T WISH TO ENGAGE IN PROLONGED LITIGATION OVER WHETHER OR NOT CAUSE EXISTED. SO IT'S REALLY OF MUTUAL BENEFIT TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THE CITY TO CONCLUDE THIS THROUGH NEGOTIATION RATHER THAN ACRIMONY AND LITIGATION. SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL SHOW HIM THE RESPECT HAD THAT HE DESERVES. HE HAS SERVED US FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS AND I -- I RESPECT THAT SERVICE, AND I WISH HIM THE BEST IN THE FUTURE.
02:14:09.115: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:14:11.517: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY FIRST REGARDLESS OF HOW THIS TURNS OUT THIS EVENING, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU, MR. LAZARUS FOR YOUR THREE PLUS YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE CITY. MUCH HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED DURING YOUR TENURE AND YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THAT. THE RESOLUTION THAT WE ARE VOTING ON NOW DOES TWO THINGS. IT CONCLO CONCLUDES MR. LAZARUS' EMPLOYMENT AS OF FEBRUARY 29th S NOTED THE SEVERANCE. HE WILL RECEIVE A SEVERANCE PAYMENT OF ONE YEAR'S SALARY AS WELL AS A $1,000 PAYMENT AND THE UNUSED SICK AND VACATION TIME THAT HE'S EARNED. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR MR. LAZARUS, AND AN IMPORTANT DECISION FOR COUNCIL. ONE THAT I AM CERTAIN ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH VERY CAREFULLY. AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT -- AND I TRUST THAT IT WILL BE, WILL REFLECT THAT, AND WILL BE RESPECTFUL. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GO INTO SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR OR HIS PERFORMANCE. I WON'T DO THAT. I KNOW IT IS FAIR, HOWEVER, FOR ANYONE TO ASK WHY I WILL VOTE FOR THIS AND I WILL TRY TO BE SUCCINCT AND HONEST. CLEARLY, I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION AND BELIEVE THAT THE INTEREST OF THE CITY ARE SERVED WITH A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP AND A NEW DIRECTION. AND IN MY VIEW, I DON'T THINK THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS -- THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR ARE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE. I HAVE SERVED ON COUNCIL A LONG TIME, AND WITH QUITE A FEW CITY ADMINISTRATORS. AND I HAVE SEEN THE EVIDENCE THAT COUNCIL ADMINISTRATOR RELATIONSHIPS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF CITY GOVERNMENT, BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. I HAVE SEEN POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND NOT SO POSITIVE ONES. WE WANT TO SUPPORT AND PROMOTE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE HEALTHY. AND WHAT YOU DID, AND WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT AND SEE ON A HIGH-PERFORMING TEAM. ASSIGNING BLAME FOR LESS POSITIVE OR PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIPS IS NOT POSITIVE, OBVIOUSLY, OR PRODUCTIVE, AND -- BUT WE ALL WANT TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR CITY TO EFFECTIVELY MEET THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. AND THEN FINALLY, A COMMENT ON WHY THIS WAS ADDED TO THE AGENDA TODAY, RATHER THAN LAST WEEK WITH OUR OTHER ITEMS. FOLKS HAVE WRITTEN TO US AND SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS NOT A TRANSPARENT ACTION, AND THAT WE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS. THIS -- IT'S A SEPARATION AGREEMENT, AND WAS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THOROUGHLY BY OUR CITY ATTORNEY. MR. LAZARUS AND HIS COUNSEL. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE MADE THE DECISION TO ADD THE ITEM TODAY, AN ITEM THAT WAS DISCUSSED WITH OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR LAST WEEK, BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS IN -- PRIMARILY IN HIS BEST INTERESTS AS WELL. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE COMMENTS, MR. LAZARUS KINDLY PROVIDED AT THE START OF MEETING, HE'S TAKING THE HIGH ROAD. THAT'S TO YOUR CREDIT, CERTAINLY, KNOWING HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS, AND WE ALSO NEED TO FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE. AGAIN, REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT, I WOULD HIKE TO THANK  MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND THANK YOU, MR. LAZARUS TO THE CITY.
02:18:29.275: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:18:38.551: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:18:39.418: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WOULD LIKE TO PERSONALLY THANK MR. LAZARUS FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO THE CITY AND I ALSO WANTED TO COMMENT HOW MUCH I HAVE APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD ONE-ON-ONE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES IN AUSTIN AND I WOULD LIKE TO IMAGINE THAT WHERE YOU LAND NEXT, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT, LIKE, EXPERIENCES THAT YOU HAD IN ANN ARBOR. THANK YOU.
02:19:01.474: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISs DISCUSSION? FOR MY PART, IN KEEPING WITH MR. LAZARUS' WISHES AT THIS TIME I WILL SAY MERELY THAT I PLACE A VERY, VERY HIGH VALUE ON HIS SERVICE. AND I VERY MUCH WISH THAT HE WOULD REMAIN HERE IN ANN ARBOR TO CONTINUE WITH THAT SERVICE AND I WILL BE VOTING NO THIS EVENING. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:19:26.565: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. ALSO IN KEEPING WITH THOSE WISHES, I WILL SAVE MOST OF MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE SITUATION FOR ANOTHER TIME. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:19:42.948: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE! ORDER, PLEASE! COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:19:50.022: >> Councilmember Grand: I WILL -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:19:55.227: >> Mayor Taylor: MA'AM! [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:20:07.006: >> Councilmember Grand: AS I WAS SAYING, I WILL JUST START OVER. YOU KNOW, I -- I WILL BE VOTING NO FOR THIS THIS EVENING. I'M INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS DECISION. I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US AS A COUNCIL, WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US AS A CITY, AND FOR OUR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH AND PRIORITIES GOING FORWARD. BUT MOSTLY, I WANT TO GIVE MR. LAZARUS HIS  HIS DUE AND THE WORDS REMINDING US WHY WE ARE HERE THIS EVENING, WHICH IS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. IT WOULD BE MY WISH FOR HIM TO SERVE US FOR MUCH, MUCH LONGER. SO I WILL BE VOTING NO.
02:20:50.850: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:20:53.052: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THINK IT'S LEGITIMATE THAT PEOPLE IN THE CROWD ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. AND I -- I WILL EXPRESS MY OWN CONCERNS TO SHARE WITH THEM. I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, IT'S NOT GREAT, BUT AS THE SPONSOR HAS POINTED OUT, THERE'S PERSONNEL MATTERS THAT ARE -- THAT DON'T ALLOW US TO SPEAK SOME CERTAIN ISSUES PUBLICLY. I HAVE CONCERNS -- AND I'M GOING TO REITERATE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE GOTTEN FROM MY CONSTITUENTS. THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXPENSE. IS THIS BEST FOR THE CITY? THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. I HAVE MY OWN CONCERNS ABOUT THE IDEAS THAT MR. LAZARUS HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD AND THAT HE'S BEEN WORKING WITH STAFF ON, AND THE WORK PRODUCT THAT HE'S PRODUCED IN HIS THREE YEARS HERE. THAT'S OF VALUE TO US, OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE WE PAY HANDSOMELY FOR THAT WORK. AND, YOU KNOW, THE NOTION THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF DISPLEASURE WITH THE DIRECTION, I THINK THAT IT FALLS TO US TO SEE WHAT THAT DIRECTION IS, AND I'M CERTAINLY SYMPATHETIC WITH THE PUBLIC WHO FEEL, PERHAPS CHEATED OUT OF THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO OPINE ON THIS MATTER. AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A -- AN ADVOCATE FOR FREE SPEECH ON THESE ISSUES AND OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY AND I FIND THAT THE -- THE POSITION I FIND MYSELF IN HERE AS COUNCIL, AS PART OF THIS BODY AND UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT RULES THAT I HAVE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS THAT CITY COUNCIL HAS, THAT I -- THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN DO TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THIS MATTER AND FOR THAT I APOLOGIZE. AND I -- YOU KNOW, I THINK WE HAVE DONE SOME DECENT WORK AND WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR EVAL EVALUATION OF THE TWO ATTORNEYS, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THE CITY ATTORNEY. AND I WAS HOPEFUL THAT THAT PROCESS WOULD HAVE AN DECENT OUTCOME. SO I -- NO MATTER -- AGAIN, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I DO WANT TO THANK MR. LAZARUS FOR HIS SERVICE AND WISH HIM WELL NO MATTER WAS, AS MY NEIGHBOR, BECAUSE FROM ALL ACCOUNTS HE'S A GOOD NEIGHBOR TOO. THANK YOU.
02:23:25.304: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:23:29.408: >> Councilmember Griswold: TWO THINGS. ONE IS THAT THIS PROCESS IS BEING VERY RESPECTFUL OF MR. LAZARUS AND I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. IT WOULD BE VERY DISRESPECTFUL GIVEN THAT THIS IS A PERSONNEL ISSUE TO COMMUNICATE ALL OF THE DETAILS WITH ALL OF THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S NOT HOW HUMAN RESOURCE ISSUES ARE HANDLED. I CANNILY, MR. LAZARUS HAS AGREED TO CONTINUE THROUGH FEBRUARY 29th. TO HAVE A VERY CONTENTIOUS EVENT HAPPENING TONIGHT WILL SIMPLY MAKE THAT HARDER FOR THE COMMUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD. AND, AGAIN, IT'S -- IT'S FIND THAT YOU WANT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL TO COUNCIL, BUT PLEASE DON'T BE DISRESPECTFUL TO MANY LAZARUS.
02:24:25.731: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:24:37.676: >> Councilmember Smith: I WAS STRUCK BY SOMETHING YOU SAID, HOWARD, IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS AND THAT WAS YOUR TALK OF JOY AND JOY OF PUBLIC SERVICE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN MY BRIEF CAREER OF PUBLIC SERVICE HERE, IT HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE JOY TO WORK ALONGSIDE OF YOU. HARD TO FIND MUCH OTHER JOY RIGHT NOW. I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS AND I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
02:24:59.098: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
02:25:02.935: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MR. LAZARUS FOR WORKING WITH ME OVER THESE LAST FEW YEARS. I BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THREE EVALUATION CYCLES AND I WANT TO WISH YOU WELL IN YOUR NEXT ENDEAVOR, AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE RESIDENTS THAT WE AREN'T AT LIBERTY TO TALK ABOUT PERSONNEL ISSUES IN DETAIL. BUT FOR ALL THE FOLKS WHO EMAILED TODAY, EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR MR. LAZARUS AND CONCERN THAT THIS -- THAT HIS DEPARTURE WOULD SOMEHOW DERAIL OUR CLIMATE ACTION AND CARBON NEUTRALITY EFFORTS, I WANT TO ASSURE YOU ALL THAT I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS COUNCIL WILL CONTINUE ON OUR PATH OF CARBON NEUTRALITY AND CLIMATE ACTION AND I PERSONALLY WILL CONTINUE TO THE EXTENT OF MY SERVICE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THE CITY FORWARD. THANK YOU.
02:26:10.502: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:26:14.473: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. MR. MAYOR, MR. LAZARUS, YOUR CAREER HAS BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO STRIVE NOT FORPERSONNAL GAIN BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC. YOU ARE A RETIRED ARMY OFFICER AND SERVED AT THE CITY ENGINEER AT THE CITY OF NEWARK AND THE CITY OF AUSTIN AND NOW THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. YOUR TRACK RECORD IN PUBLIC SERVICE IS A STORIED AND SUCCESSFUL ONE AND WE APPRECIATE THIS CHAPTER IN IT. SO THANK YOU. I WILL BE VOTING NO.
02:26:41.767: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.

RESOLUTION TO APPROPRIATE $21,700 FROM GENERAL FUND TO FUND ADDITIONAL TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE PROJECT AND APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH SAM SCHWARTZ CONSULTING IN THE AMOUNT OF $373,370. DISCUSSION?
02:28:58.770: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND THIS
02:28:59.438: >> Councilmember Eaton: MR. MAYO R?
02:29:03.942: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON. OCTOBER WHEN WE ASKED FOR A RESOLUTION ASKING FOR THIS WORK TO BE DONE, IT WAS MY HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE THAT WORK COMPLETED IN TIME TO INCLUDE THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS BUDGET, AND AS IT STANDS, IT'S REALLY QUITE UNLIKELY THAT THIS EXPENDITURE WILL LEAD TO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN BE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN THIS BUDGET. SO I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT THIS WORK DONE. I JUST I THIS THAT IT'S NO LONGER TIMELY, AND SO I -- I DON'T SUPPORT IT, SPENDING THE $21,000 ON THIS ENDEAVOR AT THIS TIME.
02:29:46.084: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:29:47.686: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD SUPPORT REFERRING THIS TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FOR INCLUSION IN THE FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGET.
02:29:58.930: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
02:30:00.031: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS THAT A MOTION OR -- SO THAT'S A MOTION. I JUST ASKED.
02:30:06.371: >> Mayor Taylor: MOTION TO REFER. SECONDED BY?
02:30:08.540: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL SECOND IT BY.
02:30:11.376: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION OF THE REFERRAL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:30:16.448: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. YEAH, I DO BELIEVE THIS INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE REQUESTED WOULD BE VALUABLE STILL. I KNOW IT WOULDN'T COME BACK IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE, BUT I DO SUPPORT THE NEED FOR THIS INFORMATION, AND SUPPORT REFERRING IT TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO BRING IT BACK SO IT COULD BE EMBEDDED IN THE FUTURE BUDGET CYCLE.
02:30:40.739: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE REFERRAL? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS REFERRED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
02:30:51.650: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, MAYOR.
02:30:52.751: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT. THE ALTERED AND AMENDED CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS, I BELIEVE REFERENCING THE ORIGIN OF F-1. WE HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT, MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION?
02:31:11.837: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT ITEM F-4 REALLY DOESN'T SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CITY CHARTER. IT WAS -- IT PURPORTS TO BE THE REASONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE THAT THE POLICE CHIEF HAS BEEN PUT ON BUT IT DOESN'T STATE A REASON. IT JUST STATES THE FACT THAT HE'S BEING PUT ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR PERSONNEL REASONS AND I FIND THIS DEFICIENT. I'M NOT GOING TO OBJECT TO ACCEPTING IT BUT I THINK THAT FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS DOESN'T SATY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARTER.
02:31:46.071: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:31:49.307: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO THANK THE CLERK FOR UPDATING THE NOTICE ABOUT THE ANNUAL REPORT AND BASIC CERTAIN ARE CONCERNS WITH THAT IS SO THAT THE STUFF CAN BE FOUND BY THE PUBLIC. WE WILL ACCEPT THE 2019 REPORT AND SHOW THAT IT COMES FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, WHICH IS APPRECIATES AND I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO READ THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF CHOICE STUFF IN THAT ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. IT SUMS UP WHAT THEY DID ALL YEAR. AND THE FOOTNOTES ARE ESPECIALLY INTRIGUING. AND I JUST -- TAKE A -- TAKE THE 20 MINUTES OR WHATEVER IT WILL TAKE AND READ THAT REPORT. AND IT WILL INFORM US AS TO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE MOVING FORWARD HERE. THANK YOU.
02:32:29.948: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST.

02:33:02.948: >> THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. IN 2017, THEY WERE A LOT OF EVENTS CONCERNING PARKING STRUCTURES. ON MAY 17, LINDSAY KANAKE OF THE ANN ARBOR NEWS PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN WHICH SHE SAID IN THE PAST  14 MONTHS -- OR RECENT 14 MONTHS, THERE WERE FIVE PEOPLE WHO JUMPED FROM PARKING STRUCTURES, ANN ARBOR PARKING STRUCTURES, THREE OF WHOM DIED. THEN -- AND SHE PUBLISHED A PHOTO OF WHAT GRAND RAPIDS DOES TO PROTECT ITS PARKING STRUCTURES. IT'S VERY DRAMATIC. I KNOW WE DON'T TAKE ADVICE FROM ANY PLACE AS PROVINCIAL AS GRAND RAPIDS, BUT IT IS IMPRESSIVE. ON -- AFTER THAT, IN JUNE AND IN SEPTEMBER, THERE WERE TWO MORE FATALITIES AND I KNOW IT WAS -- IT HAD PERSONAL MEANING FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THE COUNCIL. AND ON SEPTEMBER 18th, DR. GRADEN AND I BOTH SPOKE IN FAVOR OF A RESOLUTION TO HAVE THE D.D.A. ACT QUICKLY TO PUT UP SHH TEMPORARY STRUCTURES THAT WOULD PREVENT THIS, AND THEY DID CHAIN-LINK FENCING. IN THE MEANTIME, UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WAS ONE MORE -- ONE MORE SUICIDE. SOMEONE WHO HAD A FIGHT WITH HIS WIFE, I'M TOLD, AND GOT DRUNK AND JUMPED. PEOPLE -- PEOPLE KISS AND MAKE UP. PEOPLE SOBER UP. BUT THE TARGET WAS THERE. IT WAS A COPYCAT EVENT LIKE SHOOTING UP A CHURCH OR A SCHOOL. THE D.D.A. DID RESOLVE AND MR. LAZARUS WAS THERE, SUPPORTING IT -- THE CREATION OF CHAIN-LINKED FENCES FOR THE HIGHER REACHES OF THE STRUCTURE. IT WAS MEANT TO BE FAST, BUT ONLY A STOPGAP. AND, IN FACT, IT WAS A ONE-PAGE RESOLUTION. FOUR TIMES IN USED THE WORD "TEMPORARY." THAT DIDN'T MEAN WE'RE JUST GOING TO TEAR IT DOWN IN A FEW YEARS. IT MEANT WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE IT, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. AND YES, AGAIN, WE HAD ANOTHER EVENT AT THE LIBERTY SQUARE STRUCTURE OF A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND THIS IS ONE THING I FOUND LOOKING AT THE LIBERTY SQUARE STRUCTURE. THIS IS THE THIRD FLOOR. AND THIS IS A TREE AND YOU CAN DO YOURSELF A HELL OF A LOT OF DAMAGE AND EASILY KILL YOURSELF JUMPING FROM THE THIRD FLOOR, YET IT'S COMPLETELY OPEN. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. ANYWAY, I URGE YOU TO PICK UP THE BALL ON THIS THING AND SEE IF THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE OR SOMETHING COMPARABLE CONDITION BE DONE BEFORE WE HAVE MORE OF THESE TERRIBLE INCIDENTS.
02:36:22.280: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:36:25.950: >> GOOD EVENING. BEFORE I BEGIN, I WANT TO THANK OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND HE IS OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR BECAUSE HE BELONGS TO ALL OF US IN THIS COMMUNITY. I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS TONE THAT HE TRIED TO ESTABLISH, THAT HE DID ESTABLISH, OF CIVILITY AND RESPECT. MY WORDS MAY DIVERGE A LITTLE BIT FROM THE TONE THAT YOU MAY BE WISHING ME TO SPEAK IN THIS EVENING MR. LAZARUS, BUT I ASSURE YOU THEY ARE A MUCH TONED DOWN VERSION FROM WHERE I BEGAN EARLIER THIS MORNING. I AM SALLY HART PETERSON. I'M A NEW RESIDENT OF WARD ONE AND A FORMER WARD TWO CITY COUNCILMEMBER. I ALSO SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE POLICY ADMINISTRATOR FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. IT IS IN THESE THREE CAPACITIES THAT I ADDRESS YOU TONIGHT. THE DECISION TO TERMINATE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR WITHOUT CAUSE UNDERMINES THE LONG-TERM INTEGRITY AND THE STABILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATOR'S ROLE IN THIS CITY. IT UNDERMINES MORALITY OF OUR CITY EMPLOYEES. IT IS FISCALLITY IRRESPONSIBLE AND IT IS AN INSULT TO ALL CITY RESIDENTS WHO RELY ON OUR ADMINISTRATOR'S LEADERSHIP AUTHORITY AND KEEN DECISION MAKING TO KEEP THE CITY RUNNING ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS. THE DECISION TO TERMINATE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS SHORT SIGHTED AND IS TO THE LONG-TERM DETRIMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY. THIS DECISION PUTS EGO AHEAD OF THE COMMON GOOD. YOU HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO TERMINATE OUR ADMINISTRATOR WITHOUT CAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NO CAUSE OTHER THAN YOUR CHOICE NTO NOT GET ALONG WITH HIM. HOWARD LAZARUS LEAVES WITH A STRONG MORAL COMPASS AND HAS A CLEAR SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG AND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY AND UNDERSTANDS THE CLEAR LINE OF DIVISION BETWEEN CITY COUNCIL AND CITY ADMINISTRATION, BETWEEN POLICY MAKING AND BETWEEN POLICY ADMINISTRATION. OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, HOWARD LAZARUS IS A GRADUATE OF WEST POINT. AS SUCH, HE'S TAKEN AN OATH OF OFFICE TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. ININ PERPETUITY. HE CONTINUES TO HONOR THESE IDEALS OF DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY AND IN OUR CASE THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND HE EXCEEDS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SELFLESSNESS, HUMILITY AND DIGNITY. AS CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, YOU TOO HAVE TAKEN AN OATH OF OFFICE BUT YOUR DECISION TONIGHT STEMS FROM LONG-TERM IGNORANCE OF CITY COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION RULE NUMBER ONE, AND THAT IS THE ONE THAT SAYS DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, ESPECIALLY A CITY ADMINISTRATOR WHO OTHERWISE FOLLOWS THE RULES OF AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY, GRANTED TO HIM ACCORDING TO THIS CITY'S WEAK MAYORAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT. WE THINK THIS IS A FORGONE CONCLUSION. I URGE AT LEAST ONE OF YOU TO RETHINK ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TONIGHT, AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR COMMUNITY, I URGE ONE OF YOU ON THE PREVAILING SIDE TO RECONSIDER YOUR VOTE AT THE NEXT CITY COUNCIL MEETING.
02:39:33.571: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:39:41.646: >> MY NAME IS JULIE ROTH. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ATTENDING A CITY COUNCIL MEETING AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THE VOTE THAT YOU MADE TO TERMINATE MR. LAZARUS. THE NOTION THAT THIS IS SOME STRAIGHTFORWARD PERSONNEL MATTER THAT YOU SIMPLY CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT WREAKS OF FALSEHOOD. THIS WAS A COMPLETELY POLITICAL MOVE. IF THERE WAS SOME THING YOU COULDN'T TALK ABOUT, THAT WAS REASON FOR TERMINATION, THE TERMINATION WOULD HAVE BEEN UNANIMOUS OR AT LEAST NOT ALONG THIS FACTIONIZED CITY COUNCIL. I HAVE AVOIDED ALIGNING MYSELF WITH FACTIONS ON CITY COUNCIL, MOSTLY BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM. I THINK IT'S WRONG AND DESTRUCTIVE AND NOT USEFUL. I HAVE ALWAYS IMAGINED A CITY COUNCIL WITH A DIVERSITY OF VOICES BEING STRONGER, MORE ROBUST, AND MORE ABLE TO COME TO COMPROMISE THAT BENEFITS EVERYBODY MORE SO THAN GROUP THINK WHERE EVERYBODY ALREADY AGREES WITH EACH OTHER. YOU HAVE JUST PROVEN ME WRONG AND YOU HAVE JUST ALIGNED ME WITH A FACTION AND I'M ANGRY ABOUT THAT, BUT THAT'S WHERE I STAND. AND EVERY ONE OF YOU THAT VOTED TO FIRE MR. LAZARUS TONIGHT, WHO IS UP FOR REELECTION, MY PLEDGE TO YOU IS I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER IN NOVEMBER TO SUPPORT YOUR OPPONENT. THANK YOU.
02:41:19.977: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. HI, MY NAME IS EDWARD VILLAMETTI. I WOULD LIKE TO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD TIME TO READ IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING HAPPENED REALLY QUICKLY WITH THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, BUT THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS OF IT THAT ARE DISTINCTIVE, AND HAVING HELD A BUNCH OF JOBS AND HAVING LOST A BUNCH OF JOBS, I RECOGNIZE THE BITS OF THEM RIGHT AWAY. SECTIONS 9 AND 10 -- I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH IS WHICH, BUT ONE OF THEM IS A MUTUAL NON-DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT. I HAVE HAD THESE BEFORE FROM EMPLOYERS WHO I REFUSE TO MENTION BY NAME. THIS IS -- YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING -- IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE, DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO SUCH A THING, THAT THE NEXT TIME YOU NEGOTIATE AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT, THAT YOU REPLACE ANY IDEA OF THIS WITH A MUTUAL ADMIRATION AGREEMENT IN WHICH BOTH SIDES ARE REQUIRED TO SAY SOMETHING NICE. IT MAY BE TOO LATE FOR THAT, BUT, YOU KNOW, CHECK WITH YOUR ATTORNEY AND SEE IF THAT CAN BE DONE. THE OTHER PIECE, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS MORE IN KEEPING WITH THE SORT OF THINGS THAT I LOOK AT AND THINK ABOUT WITH CITY GOVERNMENT, WAS AN UNUSUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRED THE OUTGOING EMPLOYEE TO RELINQUISH ESSENTIALLY ALL MATERIALS RELATED TO THE CITY. BADGES, PINS, WHO KNOWS WHAT ALL, RIGHT? THERE WAS A LITANY OF THEM. AND NOT TO DISCLOSE ANYTHING CONFIDENTIAL. WELL, SO ON THE CONFIDENTIAL FRONT, I'M SURE THAT THE JOB INCLUDES A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT I AS A CITIZEN LOOKING FOR PUBLIC RECORDS WOULD BE TURNED DOWN ON A FOIA REQUEST, BECAUSE THE RECORDS WERE CONFIDENTIAL. BUT THE NOTION THAT AN OUTGOING EMPLOYEE SHOULD HAVE NO RECORDS OF THE PLACE THAT THEY HAD LEFT, I THINK, IS UNREASONABLE. I THINK THAT GIVEN THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC BODY AND -- AND THAT ANY CITIZEN HAS THE RIGHT TO REQUEST FROM A PUBLIC BODY ANY NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT WOULD HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HOW THE CITY WORKED AND HOW THINGS HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T HAVE -- AS A CITY, I WOULD NOT HAVE PRESSED FOR THAT LANGUAGE. I THINK IT'S OVERLY -- OVER THE TOP. IT'S OVERLY HARSH. I DON'T HAVE REPLACEMENT LANGUAGE. SORRY. IN ANY CASE, I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK AND SOMETIME WITH YOUR FAMILY.
02:44:17.255: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:44:22.560: >> ALTHOUGH YOU MAY NOT HAVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY, I GET OFFENDED WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT I CAN'T SAY SOMETHING. I HAVE MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND I WILL SAY IT. A CITY ADMINISTRATOR WORKS WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS REGARDLESS OF PARTY. AND IT KEEPS THE CITY FUNCTIONING ELECTED PEOPLE SHOULD COME AND GO BUT THOSE WHO WORK AS STAFF SHOULD HAVE STABLE JOBS AND SHOULD NOT BE FIRED DUE TO POLITICS WHITE SOX WANTS TO WORK FOR CITY GOVERNMENT AND STAFF IF THEY COULD BE TOLD THEY WOULD BE FIRED IN THE LAST ELECTION PSYCHING. AS THIS FIRING IS WITHOUT CAUSE, THEN THIS IS A FIRING FOR POLITICAL REASONS AND THAT'S NOT HOW STAFF SHOULD BE TREATED IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. YOU WAIT FOR THE END OF THE FOUR YEARS OR WHATEVER THE THING IS, AND YOU JUDGE, YOU DON'T DO IT MIDSENTENCE -- YOU DON'T DO IT IN THE MIDDLE LIKE. THIS IT'S ONE THING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT STAFF AND ASK THEM TO DO STUFF. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO FIRE THEM BECAUSE OF POLITICS AND AS I WATCHED THE VOTE TODAY, IT'S VERY OBVIOUS IT IS BECAUSE OF POLITICS. KEEP IN MIND, I HAVE FOUGHT FOR YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO BE IN THAT COUNCIL BECAUSE I STILL RESPECT YOU A LOT, BUT POLITICALLY, I DISAGREE VERY STRONGLY WITH YOU. I CANNOT SUPPORT YOU IN THE NEXT ELECTION WHATSOEVER. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT PAINS ME TO SEE. I -- I -- TO ME, WHEN I LOOK AT NATIONAL POLITICS, I SEE TOO MUCH WHERE PEOPLE ARE FIRED AND STAFF KIND OF JOBS BECAUSE OF POLITICS. WE SEE TRUMP POLITICS GOING ON AND I'M SEEING IT HERE TODAY, AND IT BOTHERS ME A LOT. IT'S HARD TO TALK. I CAN'T SAY WHAT -- I -- I ADMIRE A LOT WHAT FORMER COUNCILMEMBER PETERSON JUST SAID. I CAN'T SAY IT BETTER THAN WHAT SHE SAID. THAT'S LEADERSHIP RIGHT THERE. ONE OTHER TOPIC, COUNCILMEMBER, EATON, IT'S NOT RIGHT TO POLITICIZE A SUICIDE, A RECENT SUICIDE INTO POLITICAL STUFF. IT'S FINE TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE CITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT DO NOT GO AFTER RECENT SUICIDE LIKE THAT. THIS WAS A STUDENT, AND UNLESS YOU HAVE PERMISSION FROM THAT FAMILY TO SAY SOMETHING, AND THEY WANTED YOU TO SAY SOMETHING, DON'T DO IT. PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE -- BE NICE TO THOSE WOULD SUFFERED LOSS, BUT WHAT WE SAW TONIGHT WAS INCREDIBLY POLITICAL. LAZARUS, ONE THING I HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR YOUR STAFF AND I ALWAYS WANTED A BOSS LIKE THAT. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE QUALITY TO HAVE, EVEN WHEN YOU WERE CRITICIZED. I WILL ABSOLUTELY MISS YOU. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
02:47:11.829: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:47:19.170: >> HELLO. I'M FRANCIS TUDOR, THE VICE CHAIR OF THE ICPAC GROUP AND WE HAD A MEETING EARLIER TONIGHT. WE HAVE ABOUT ASKED TO SHARE SOME STATEMENTS THAT WERE READ AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT MEETING. SO I'M SHARING ONE ON BEHALF OF A COMMISSIONER THAT WAS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND. DEAR CHAIRWOMAN JACKSON AND FELLOW COMMISSIONERS, I HAVE BEEN IN SPAIN FOR THE PAST MONTH, HOWEVER, DESPITE THE DISTANCE, I HAVE HEARD THAT POLICE CHIEF COX HAS BEEN PLACED OPEN ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE AND THAT NO PUBLIC EXPLANATION HAS BEEN GIVEN ABOUT THE CITY'S DRASTIC ACTION, NOT EVEN TO CITY COUNCIL OR ICPAC COMMISSIONERS. THIS ACTION AND ESPECIALLY THE SECRECY SURROUNDING IT REFLECTS BADLY ON THE CITY OF NASH. IT WILL HAVE -- ANN ARBOR. IT WILL HAVE A SERIOUS NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE MORALE OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND OF COURSE THE NEWLY FOUNDED ICPAC. ADDITIONALLY THE SECRETIVE ACTION ACTUALLY INTERFERES WITH ICPAC'S WORK OF FURTHER TRUST AND GOOD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, ITS POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THE CITY'S MINORITIES SCENE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. CHIEF COX HAS NOT BEEN IN HIS POSITION BUT FOR A SHORT PERIOD AND ONE CANNOT BEGIN TO IMAGINE WHAT COULD HE HAVE DONE TO DESERVE SUCH DRASTIC ACTION. NO MATTER WHAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME, THIS ACTION WILL MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CHIEF COX OR ANY SUCCESS IN FEELING SECURE IN EXECUTING THEIR DUTIES AND IMPLEMENTING CHANGES THAT WOULD ASSIST IN THE GOAL OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. THE SILENCE OF OUR MAYOR AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR LEAVES TOO MUCH ROOM FOR IDLE SPECULATIONS. THE LONGER THE SILENCE, THE MORE SPECULATION AND RUMORS WILL BE GENERATED. I WOULD LIKE TO VOICE MY OPINION, AND I DO HOPE THAT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION ARE UNITED IN THEIR DEMAND FOR A SPEEDY, OPEN EXPLANATION AND RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER. RESPECTFULLY COMMISSIONER ANNAN AMIRY.
02:49:18.355: >> HI, I'M LISA JACKSON. I'M THE CHAIR OF THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, AND WE WERE ASKED TO READ A STATEMENT THAT WAS READ TONIGHT AT OUR MEETING WHERE WE HAD AN OVERFLOW CROWD. WE WERE -- WE HAD TO BRING CHAIRS IN FROM OTHER ROOMS AND MAKE LOTS OF SPACE FOR MANY CONCERNED CITIZENS WHO WERE ATTENDING PRIMARILY BECAUSE CHIEF MICHAEL COX WAS UNEXPECTED PLACED ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. WE STARTED OFF BY SAYING ALL THE COMMISSIONERS IN THE ROOM ARE INVESTED IN THIS COMMUNITY. EACH OF US HAD A HAS A DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN POLICING AND TO BUILD COMMUNITY TRUST THROUGH CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT. WE WERE APPOINTED TO  BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE COMMUNICATE AND WE WERE PRIMARILY INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE SHOOTING OF A CITIZEN AND A TASK FORCE. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL REASONS WE WERE APPOINTED IS BECAUSE OF THE CITY'S STATED DESIRE TO ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND TO HAVE US FACILITATE A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE CITY. AND IT IS TRANSPARENCY THAT IS THE TO HE CUSS OF ALL OF OUR WORK. CHIEF COX WENT THROUGH A RIGOROUS INTERVIEW PROCESS THAT INCLUDED COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS. HE WAS BY FAR THE MOST EXPERIENCED CANDIDATE HAVING LED A FORCE SEVERAL TIMES THAT OF ANN ARBOR. HIS PRIOR EXPERIENCE INCLUDED INTERNAL AFFAIRS, OPERATIONS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF POLICE OFFICERS. WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT HE HAS NOT HAD A COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST HIM DURING HIS 30 YEARS IN BOSTON. ALTHOUGH IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CITY LACKS A PROFESSIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES ADMINISTRATOR AT THIS I AMTIME, WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOR JOB TO EVALUATE H.R. ISSUES, HOWEVER, WE WERE CONVENED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF POLICE POLICY AND PROCEDURE AND IT'S CHALLENGING TO DO SO IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS THIS SECRETIVE. WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR CONFIDENTIAL EVALUATION. WE DO. BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THE PROCESS ITSELF HAS BEEN HANDLED. FOR EXAMPLE, DUE TO THE LACK OF CLARIFICATION, THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN LEFT TO SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WE HAVE RECEIVED CALLS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, NEWSPAPER HEAD LINES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SUCH AS AFTER ONLY SEVEN MONTHS ON THE JOJOB, THE CHIEF HAS DONE SOMETHING SO SERIOUS THAT HE HAS BEEN PLACED ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS. ALTHOUGH THE CITY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECREASE SOME OF THE SPECULATION, THEY HAVE NOT CHOSEN TO DO SO, AND THUS, WE ARE HAVING TO FIELD THESE CALLS. WE WANT TO MAKE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THIS ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WAS NOT A RESULT OF ANY ISSUE WITH THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. WE DID NOT LODGE A COMPLAINT. WE HAVE STRUGGLED ON OCCASION TO GET INFORMATION ON CASES BUT THAT BACKLOG WAS NOT DIRECTLY DUE TO THE CHIEF AND WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE GOOD PROGRESS WORKING WITH LIEUTENANT BONNIE TYLER IN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS. OUR LAST POINT IS WHEN THE MILLER-CANFIELD INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE, WE HOPE THAT WE WILL BE PRIVY TO THE REPORT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT IT WILL BE MADE PUBLIC. THANK YOU.
02:52:24.308: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
02:52:37.087: >> HELLO, I'M ZACHARY STORY. ONCE AGAIN, I'M ASKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT REALLY, MORE IMPORTANTLY, SHAME ON A LOT OF YOU UP HERE. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, COUNCILMEMBER EATON, DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE UP THERE. YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED BEHIND THIS -- AT THIS DESK, YOU KNOW. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. AND THANK YOU TO MR. LAZARUS. I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS NOW. I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING ALL OF YOU. AND THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! AND LIKE A PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID, -- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET'S HAVE A LITTLE ACTIVITY HERE. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU VOTED FOR TRUMP UP THERE. ANYONE? REALLY? OKAY. SURE. THEN WHY DO SOME ON THIS COUNCIL
