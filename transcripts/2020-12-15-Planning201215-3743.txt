00:02:14.988: >> Chair Mills: AND WE ARE ON ITEM NUMBER THREE AND THAT'S INTRODUCTIONS. THOSE OF YOU WHO FOLLOW PLANNING COMMISSION MIGHT NOTE WE HAVE TWO MORE NEW MEMBERS IN OUR ROLL CALL TONIGHT, WELCOME COMMISSIONER LEE AND COMMISSIONER CLARKE. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD PLEASE BRIEFLY INTRODUCE YOURSELVES TO US AND TO THOSE WHO ARE FOLLOWING US ON THE BROADCASTER. COMMISSIONER CLARKE, CAN WE START WITH YOU? YOU ARE MUTED.
00:02:47.654: >> Commissioner Clarke: HI, SO MY NAME IS SADIRA, I WORKED IN HOUSING NOW -- OR NONPROFIT DEVELOPMENT FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS NOW, HOUSING HAS BEEN MY FOCUS FOR THE MAJORITY OF THAT. I HAVE A DEGREE FROM THE NEW SCHOOL IN NEW YORK IN URBAN POLICY AND MANAGEMENT AND I'M AN ALUM OF EASTERN MICHIGAN AND I CONSIDER ANN ARBOR MY OWN TOWN AND I GREW UP IN SCIO TOWNSHIP RIGHT OUTSIDE OF TOWN. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE AND CONTRIBUTING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
00:03:20.087: >> Chair Mills: WELL, WELCOME. WE ARE GLAD TO YOU HAVE. COMMISSIONER LEE?
00:03:21.722: >> Commissioner Lee: YEAH, SURE. I HAVE BEEN IN ANN ARBOR SINCE '97, I WENT TO BRYANT, TAPPAN GILL, UNDERGRAD AND MICHIGAN GRAD SCHOOL. SO I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE. I WORKED ON ZONING ANALYSIS FOR D1 AND D2 AND I CREATED RENDERINGS AND SINCE THEN I WORKED AT McKINLEY AS A REAL ESTATE ANALYST. AND I HAVE BEEN WITH OXFORD NOW FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS. SO I'M GLAD TO BE HERE. I THINK I'M HERE TO SERVE, LISTEN AND HOPEFULLY CONTRIBUTE IN A MEANINGFUL MANNER. LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
00:03:59.827: >> Chair Mills: WELL, WE ARE GLAD TO YOU HAVE AND IT'S REALLY NICE TO BE UP TO OUR FULL CONTINGENT OF NINE AGAIN. IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER TO MAKE QUORUM. SO ITEM NUMBER 4 ON THE AGENDA IS AAPPROVAL OF THE AGENDA. CAN I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE -- OR TO MOVE IT? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION. OF THE AGENDA AS DRAFTED? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AGENDA, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ANY OPPOSED? I DON'T SEE ANY. SO GREAT. THE MOTION CARRIES. ITEM NUMBER 5 IS THE APPROVAL OF MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING. WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SETS OF MINUTES AND I PROPOSE THAT WE TAKE THEM TOGETHER. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE MINUTES OF THE NOVEMBER 17th AND DECEMBER 1st, 2020, MEETING? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN? IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF THE MINUTES? SEEING NONE, ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MINUTES AS DRAFTED, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ANY OPPOSED? OKAY. THE MOTION CARRIES. WE'LL MOVE ON. ITEM NUMBER 6 IS REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS. THERE ARE SOME WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS THAT I'M SURE YOU SAW IN THE PACKET. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, DO YOU HAVE ANY REPORT FOR US?
00:05:35.889: >> Councilmember Disch: I DO. I HAVE A BRIEF REPORT. AND I HOPE I'M NOT LEAVING ANYTHING OUT, BUT HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WILL CORRECT ME IF I DO. AT THE LAST MEETING, COUNCIL APPROVED THE BRIGHT DAWN CONDO PROPOSAL AND MADE AN INTERESTING MODIFICATION IN RESPONSE TO NEIGHBOR CONCERNS ABOUT TRAFFIC CUT THROUGHS AND SO THERE WILL BE THE RESURRECTION OF A PROPOSED GATE THAT WAS IN A PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THIS VERY LONG SAGA. AND IT WILL BE TEMPORARILY INSTALLED WHERE THE CONNECTION WAS GOING TO BE AT -- I THINK IT WAS -- IS IT ELI? THANK YOU. EVEN THOUGH YOU HEAR IT SAID PROBABLY 50 TIMES IN THE PUBLIC, MY, WHAT THE MIND PUTS AWAY. THAT, IT WAS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND POLITE AND COLLABORATIVE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND COUNCIL, AND THAT FELT GOOD. I THINK THEY ARE EXCITED TO HAVE BRIGHT DAWN. THEY WERE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE WAY -- THE WAY THE TRAFFIC FLOWS IN THEIR NEIGHBOR HOPEFULLY THAT GATE WILL REALLY BE TEMPORARY. IT IS, OF COURSE, YOU CAN GET THROUGH IF YOU ARE AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE. SO NO WORRIES THERE. AND THEN T OTHER -- I THINK THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING TO PLANNING COMMISSION IS THAT THE SIGN ORDINANCE DIDASS. AND IT WAS VERY AMUSING, BECAUSE THE MAYOR HAD TO READ ALL OF THOSE NUMBERS EVERY SINGLE TIME HE CALLED ON US TO AMEND IT, AND SO IT TESTED HIS ANNUNCIATION AND ELOCUTION AND I THINK HE PASSED, AS DID THE SIGN ORDINANCE. SO IF I'M FORGETTING ANYTHING, PLEASE CHIP IN, ANYBODY.
00:07:42.549: >> Chair Mills: . CHENG, DO ANYTHING FROTHE PLANNING OR MANAGER.
00:07:45.652: >> Planning Mager: HERE'S NOTHING T B ADDED FROM THE PLANNING MANAG.
00:07:50.524: >> Chair Mil: VERY GOOD. ARE THE ANY OER COMSSIONER OFFICERS O CMITTEE LISONS THAT HAVENYTHING TO RORT? IT'S BEEN QET ON THE COMMITT FRONT, I GSS. AL RIGHT. 7,HICH I THE FIRSTO ITEM NUMBER OPPOUNITY FOR AIENCE PARTICIPATIO THIS IS ANPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT'S NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THE AGENDA. SO THE THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS, THAT ARE ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT ARE FOR THE ST. FRANCIS PROPOSAL, THE WEST HURON PARKING LOT AND THE LEWIS JEWELER PROPOSAL, SO NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THEM. AND ANY OTHER MATTERS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS TO COUNCIL FOR SITE PLANS OR FOR THE C1A, C1A/R, THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. YOU CAN PLEASE CALL 877-853-5247 AND ENTER MEETING ID99577681361. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT ON CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED YOUR HAND DIGITALLY. TO RAISE YOUR HAND, PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN MOVED TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE YOURSELF TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. YOU MIGHT ALSO HAVE TO PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOURSELF. AND AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. SO I SEE A COUPLE OF CALLER OZ S ONTHE LINE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT AN ITEM THAT'S NOT A PUBLIC HEARING, YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE AND RAISE YOUR HAND. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A TAKER.
00:09:53.046: >> CALLER ENDING IN 534, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:09:59.753: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS TOM AC STULBERT. I LIVE IN LOWERTOWN, ANN ARBOR AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE C1A AND C1A/R UPDATE, BUT I WANT TO START WELCOMING THE TWO NEW PLANNING COMMISSIONER WITH THEIR OVERVIEW OF THE LOWERTOWN ISSUE ITSELF WHICH IS THE REASON WE ARE HERE FOR THE C1A AND C1A/R REVIEW. I KNOW THERE'S ONLY THREE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS LEFT FROM 2017, WHEN LOWERTOWN WAS BEFORE YOU AND EVEN THOSE THREE DIDN'T SEE A WEALTH OF MATERIALS THAT HAVE COME OUT REGARDING THIS MATTER. SINCE THEN, FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, AFTER IT PASSED THROUGH PLANNING COMMISSION, THE LOWER TOWN 1140 BROADWAY, MORNINGSIDE APPLICATION, WE HIRED A TOP ATTORNEY TO EDUCATE THE CITY. WE HAVE BEEN MAKING THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU. HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO READ MY EMAILS AND THE ATTACHMENTS. THERE'S A 30-PAGE LETTER FROM HER FROM LATE NOVEMBER 2017. THERE'S THE ACTUAL LAWSUIT FILING WHICH IS FULL OF A WEALTH OF FA FACTUAL INFORMATION, AS WL AS CLAIMS. SO MY RELATIONSHIP TO THAT IS I AM THE OFFICIAL SPOKESPERSON. I'M A BOARD MEMBER AND SPOKESPERSON FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION THAT FILED A LAWSUIT AFTER IT WAS IMPROPERLY APPROVED. AND WHY ME? I WAS A DEVELOPER. I DEVELOP SUBDIVISIONS THROUGHOUT OAKLAND COUNTY GOING BACK ALMOST 30 NOWS. I HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO MULTIPLE PLANNING COMMISSION, CITY COUNCIL, TOWNSHIP BOARDS, DID A LOT OF REZONING, DID REZONINGS EVEN WHEN A MASTER PLAN WAS REQUIRED TO ENTERTAIN AN APPLICATION FIRST, WHICH TAKES ME BACK TO SOME HISTORY OF 2017, THE SUMMER OF 2017, WHEN ETHEL POTTS WHO SADLY PASSED AWAY THIS PAST YEAR. ETHEL POTTS AND I WERE IN FRONT OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION, YOUR BODY SAYING THAT THE PROCESS WAS WRONG ON THIS APPROVAL. AND THE FIRST THING TO NOTE IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MARCH 31st, 2017 LETTER THAT I SENT YOU ALL, THE PLANNING LETTER TO THE DEVELOPER, THAT IT PROPERLY COMPL CLAIMED TO BE A RESIDENTIAL UNIT. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MASTER PLAN REVIEW FOR THIS ISSUE, A REVISION PROCESS. AND IF THE COMMUNITY -- IN THE COMMUNITY HAD DECIDED WE NO LONGER WANTED MIX USE ON THIS SITE, WE WANTED RESIDENTIAL, THEN THE PROPER WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO HAVE THAT MASTER PLAN REVISION. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH THAT CONCLUSION, GIVEN THE MOMENTUM TOWARDS TSD AND MIXED USE AND THEN WE WOULD BE DONE. WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE MASTER PLAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN USED. IT'S A RESIDENTIAL APPLICATION, NOT A MIXED USE APPLICATION AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHY C1A AND C1A/R WERE SO BADLY IMPROPERLY MISUSED TO GET AROUND OUR ZONING ORDINANCE. SO WHERE AM I WITH C1A AND C1A/R, IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE MISUSED, WE WILL GET RID OF THEM. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN USED, THEY WERE NOT MISSED.
00:13:22.389: >> Chair Mills: THAT'S TIME.
00:13:23.256: >> THANK YOU.
00:13:24.024: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:13:30.463: >> CALLER, ENDING IN 556, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:13:39.072: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:13:41.107: >> YES.
00:13:41.374: >> MY NAME IS RALPH MCKEE. I'M IN THE FIFTH WARD. I SENT YOU AN IN-DEPTH EMAIL TODAY WHICH I'M BETTING YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THROUGH YET BECAUSE IT HAS REFERENCES TO SEVERAL OTHER DOCUMENTS. SO I WILL TRY TO HIT THE MAIN POINTS IN MY THREE MINUTES. I LISTENED TO AND SPOKE AT THE RECENT ORDINANCE REVIEW COMMITTEE MEETING ON EVERY VIEW OF THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS JUST COMMITTED BY MR. LENART. I'M NOT SURPRISED BUT I'M STILL VERY DISAPPOINTED. IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE DIRECTION GIVEN BY COUNCIL TO ANALYZE RESTRICTION OR ELIMINATION OF THESE DISTRICTS AND IT IGNORES THE PUBLIC INPUT PROVIDED AT THAT MEETING. INSTEAD, THE RECOMMENDATION SUPPORTS A VAGUE EXPANSION OF USE OF THOSE DISTRICTS. THE RECOMMENDATION DOESN'T ADDRESS PROPERLY, ONE, THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THOSE DISTRICTS, TWO THE PROBLEMATIC AND ARGUABLY ILLEGAL USE IN LOWER TOWN AND GARNET DEVELOPMENTS WHICH RESULTED IN COMMUNITY PUSHBACK, A LAWSUIT AND THE COUNCIL DIRECTIVE THAT BROUGHT US HERE TODAY, THREE, THEIR USE ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO AVOID INCLUDING AFFORDABLE UNITS OR PAYING INTO THE AFFORDABLE FOUND AND FOUR, HAVING A DISTRICT WITH NO BOUNDARIES FIVE, USURPING A MASTER PLAN PROCESS. IT'S LAID OUT IN THE LOWER TOWN COMPLAIN AND THE OTHER LETTER THAT MR. STULBERG JUST REFERRED TO. IT WAS TO COMPLIMENT THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICTS, NOT CAMPUSES. THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL POINT. NEXT, EXPANDING THEIR USE CAN EXPOSE NUMEROUS NEIGHBORHOODS TO HIGH-RISES NEXT DOOR WITH NO STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL AND WITHOUT GETTING A SINGLE DOLLAR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH WOULD LIKELY BE REQUIRED UNDER OTHER ZONING APPROVAL ROUTES. THEREFORE, IN MY VIEW, IT'S INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST TO ADVOCATE FOR THE USE OF THESE DISTRICTS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY ARE INCONSISTENT. NEXT, THE LOWERTOWN IS MAYBE THE WORST ZONING DECISION IN RECENT HISTORY. IT COST US ALMOST $9 MILLION IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS. IT'S ESSENTIAL READING. YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE A COHERENT DISCUSSION WITHOUT READING THAT. TWO MAIN POINTS. THE APPROVAL PROCESS COMPLETELY IGNORED APPLICABLE LAW IN THE MASTER PLAN. THE ORIGINAL PLANNING REPORT SAID THAT THE PROJECT WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN BECAUSE, ONE, IT WAS TOO DENSE; AND TWO, IT WAS NOT MIXED USE. AND MR. LENART DID AN ABOUT-FACE ON THAT ISSUE WITHOUT EXPLAINING WHY, RECOMMENDED APPROVAL AND GOT IT PAST. WE SHOULDN'T ALLOWED -- GOT IT PASSED. WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. I'M AMAZED THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES IN THIS TOWN HAVE NOT PICKED UP ON THIS ISSUE. EVERY SINGLE USE OF THIS DISTRICT OR THE TWO DISTRICTS WOULD OTHERWISE LIKELY FALL INTO A CATEGORY THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW, THE PPMs OR MAYBE INTO A PUD. ALL OF THESE --
00:16:24.837: >> 30 SECONDS REMAINING.
00:16:26.439: >> ALL AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS. SO EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT A DEVELOPMENT LIKE LOWERTOWN IS APPROVED, IT COSTS US AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS. THAT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT, AND NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES PICK UP ON THAT. SO THAT'S THE GIST OF WHAT MY EMAIL SAYS I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD GET A CHANCE TO READ IT AND ASSIMILATE IT. YOU NEED TO READ THOSE OTHER DOCUMENTS. THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL, BUT IT'S ESSENTIAL.
00:16:57.904: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE DID RECEIVE THAT IN A PACK ELIMINATE. THE COMMUNICATION WAS RECEIVED BEFORE THE MEETING. IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS PLANNING COMMISSION ON ANY ITEM THAT'S NOT LISTED FOR A PUBLIC HEARING, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE TO DIGITALLY RAISE YOUR HAND. ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION AND, AGAIN, IN ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC HEARINGS THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION AT THE END OF THE MEETING. AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER 8, WHICH IS THE PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING. MR. CHENG, YOU HAVE THOSE? YOU ARE MUTED.
00:18:02.702: >> NEVER FAILS! OKAY. WE HAVE QUITE A FEW. FIRST ONE IS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2022, 2027 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. THIS IS A PLAN FOR CITY CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO B UNDERTAKEN OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS. THIS PLAN DESCRIBES PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS NEEDS FOR MUNICIPAL AND PARK FACILITIES, TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE, ALONG WITH PROPOSED COSTS AND SCHEDULING. UPON ADOPTION BY THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION, THE CIP BECOMES A SUPPORTING DOCUMENT FOR THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN. THE CIP IS ALSO USED AS THE SOURCE DOCUMENT FOR THE CITY'S CAPITAL BUDGET PLANNING. NEXT, WE HAVE THE RUTH WYNN NATURE AREA, 3301 GEDDES ROAD, A REZONING, AN 8.489-ACRE ADDITION TO 9 RUTH NATURE AREA TO R1A, WHICH IS SINGLE FAMILY DISTRICT TO PL, PUBLIC LAND THIS WAS PURCHASED AND APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL ON APRIL 19th, 2019. NEXT, THE OAKWOOD NAT NATURES REZONING. IT'S A 6.58-ACRE FROM R4A WHICH IS MULTIFALY DWELLING DISTRICT TO PL. THIS WAS ACQUIRED AND APPROVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL ON APRIL 6th, 2020. AND THEN FINALLY, WE HAVE AMENDMENTS TO PERMITTED USES IN THE C2B AND C3 ZONING DISTRICTS. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 55, THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.15 TABLE 5.15-1 PRIMARY USE TABLE TO ELIMINATE WAREHOUSING AND INDOOR STORAGE AS A PRIMARY USE IN THE C2B AND C3 DISTRICTS MUCH.r Mills: THK YOU VERY AND JUST TOE CLE, FORLL O US,HAT --HOSE MANY ITEMS ARE GOING TO BAT THE JANRY SO WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT IN THE NEW YEAR. ALL RIGHT. THE NEXT ITEM -- OR NOW WE'RE ON TO SECTION 9 WITHIN THE AGENDA, WHICH IS REGULAR BUSINESS. I NEED TO RECUSE MYSELF FROM ITEM NUMBER 9A, THE ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI PETITION, SINCE I AM A PARISHIONER AND DONOR TO THE PROJECT. SO COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL HAS AGREED TO STEP IN AND I WILL BE DEMOTED AND YOU WILL SEE ME ONCE YOU ARE ALL DON'T DISCUSSING. -- YOU ARE ALL DONE DISCUSSING.
00:20:41.828: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THIS IS THE ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI, 2150 FRIEZE AVENUE, TO PROPOSE A 14,500 SQUARE FOOT PARISH ADDITION ON THIS 10.6-ACRE SITE, ZONED R1B, SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL IN WHICH CHURCH USES AND EXPANSIONS REQUIRE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES APPROVAL ON A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT. A LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION FROM INSTALLING THE REQUIRED PARKING LOT BIORETENTION IS ALSO REQUESTED. MR. CHENG WILL PROVIDE THE STAFF COMMENTS AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE OUR COMMISSION DISCUSSION. CAN WE HAVE THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION?
00:21:37.950: >> I THINK YOU PROMOTED THE WRONG ARCHITECT.
00:21:44.323: >> YES, I BELIEVE MR. KERR IS FOR THE LATTER PROJECT.
00:21:49.695: >> CORRECT.
00:21:52.298: >> CHRIS, DO YOU KNOW WHO IS THE CORRECT --
00:21:54.033: >> YES, IT'S GOING TO BE EITHER DAN OR BRIAN.
00:21:59.338: >> WE HAVE --
00:22:00.439: >> IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS!
00:22:04.010: >> YEAH, WE'LL SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT.
00:22:22.094: >> IT WILL BE DAN COYLEER AND BRIAN BAGNECK.
00:22:28.868: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME? (FEEDBACK).
00:22:33.039: >> I JUST HUNG UP MY PHONE. HELLO. (FEEDBACK).
00:22:40.046: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: LOTS OF FEEDBACK THERE.
00:22:42.582: >> LOTS OF ECHO.
00:22:48.554: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: TRY AGAIN. THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE BETTER. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THAT A TRY NOW.
00:22:59.765: >> ANY LUCK?
00:23:00.766: >> OH.
00:23:01.000: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SOUNDS GOOD.
00:23:02.168: >> MUCH BETTER.
00:23:03.069: >> HELLO THERE. ANY LUCK THERE? HELLO?
00:23:21.854: >> WE CAN HEAR YOU. CAN YOU HEAR US?
00:23:27.660: >> WE'RE READY.
00:23:43.876: >> MR. KING, CAN YOU HEAR US.
00:23:45.111: >> MY NAME IS ROBERT KEEN AND I'M THE BUSINESS MANAGER FOR ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI, WE ARE A ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY OF NEARLY 3,000 FAMILIES. IT'S GROWN FROM AN ORIGINAL CHURCH BUILDING OFF STADIUM BOULEVARD TO A CAMPUS SPANNING ACROSS APPROXIMATELY 10 ACRES. THE COMMUNITY EXPANDED STEADILY WITH ITS FIRST ADDITION IN 1955, AND ANOTHER IN 1961 WITH THE EXISTING CHURCH BUILDING COMPLETED IN 1969. IN 1980, THE PARISH ACTIVITIES CENTER KNOWN HERE AS THE PAC, WAS ADDED TO PROVIDE GATHERING SPACE AND A KITCHEN WHICH IS SHARED BY THE SCHOOL, SEVERAL CHURCH GROUPS, AND VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS FROM OTHER CHURCHES AND FROM WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AMONG ITS MANY MINISTRIES, ST. FRANCIS PROVIDES A CATHOLIC EDUCATION TO APPROXIMATELY 425 PRE-K THROUGH GRADE 8 STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY RELIGIOUS EDUCATION AND SACRAMENTAL PREPARATION TO MORE THAN 450 STUDENTS THAT ATTEND LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS LIKE TAPPAN MIDDLE SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET AND DURING NON-PANDEMIC YEAR, OUR VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL WELCOMES 300 YOUTH DURING THE SUMMER. WE HAVE AN ACTIVE OUTREACH MINISTRY FOR THOSE WHO NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, LACKING FOOD AND SHELTER OR CRAVING SPIRITUAL DIRECTION. OUR MINISTRY TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY HAS GROWN IN THE PAST FEW YEARS AND WE ARE WORKING ACTIVELY TO PROVIDE A SPIRITUAL HOME TO OUR SPANISH SPEAKING SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN YPSILANTI AREA. THE PARISHIONERS HAVE PROVIDED GENERAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT REGION AND WASHTENAW COUNTY, AS WELL AS AROUND THE GLOBE TO MISSIONS IN INDIA AND KENYA. EVEN WITH THE PAC BEING IN USE FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS, GROWTH IN OUR COMMUNITY HAS CAUSED US TO BE WITHOUT AMPLE SPACE ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW PARISH MINISTRY CENTER ON THE HILL TO THE WEST OF THE CHURCH BUILDING WILL ALLEVIATE THIS BOTTLENECK TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR DIVERSE MINISTRIES AND VARIOUS SCHOOL FUNCTIONS AND SCORES OF VOLUNTEERS THAT SERVE. COMMUNITY. VERY SIMPLY PUT, MORE SPACE TO MEET AND CONGREGATE WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER SERVE GOD AND OUR NEIGHBORS IN ALL RESPECTS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OF MORE THAN 14,500 SQUARE FEET WILL PROVIDE AMPLE SEATING FOR 600 PEOPLE SEATED IN ROWS FOR A STAGE PRESENTATION OR SCHOOL PERFORMANCE. THE SPACE CAN ALSO BE USED TO SEAT UP TO 300 PEOPLE AT TABLES FOR A BANQUET MEAL. THERE WILL BE A MOVABLE WALL THAT WILL ALLOW THE MAIN HALL TO BE SUBDIVIDED INTO FOUR BREAKOUT ROOMS FOR SMALL GROUP, FAITH NELL FELLOWSHIP OR TO ACCOMMODAE MEETINGS. A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN AND A SHOWER FACILITY ARE INCLUDED IN THE DESIGN FOR WHEN IT'S USED FOR SHELTERING THE HOMELESS. THERE WILL BE AMPLE RESTROOMS TO SUPPORT A LARGE FUNCTION SUCH AS A WEDDING RECEPTION OR A FUNERAL LUNCHEON. THE SECOND FLOOR WILL INCLUDE MODERN OFFICE SPACE FOR THE PARISH STAFF TO WORK, AND MEET WITH PARISHIONERS. IN SUMMARY THIS LATEST PROJECT FOLLOWS LONG TRADITION OF EXPANSION. OUR BUILDING WAS DESIGNED TO BE PRACTICAL, ENERGY EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE AND THERE'S A SUCCSUCCESSFUL CAPITAL CAMPAIGNN PLACE. WITH US HERE TONIGHT ARE OUR ARCHITECTURE FIRM HOBBS & BLACK AND OUR CIVIL ENGINEERING TEAM, PAE GROUP AND WE WELCOME INPUT FROM ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS AS WE SEEK APPROVAL FROM THE CITY AS THE PLANS TO BILL THE ST. FRANCIS MINISTRY CENTER IN N 2021. THANKS FOR HAVING US HERE TONIGHT.
00:27:33.739: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ANYBODY ELSE TO PRESENT ON YOUR TEAM OR SHALL WE MOVE ON TO THE STAFF REPORT? I THINK HE'S NOT HEARING US. SO MR. CHENG, CAN YOU PROVIDE YOUR STAFF REPORT?
00:27:48.420: >> I CAN. IT DOES APPEAR THAT BRIAN BAGNICK HAS RAISED HIS HAND.
00:27:53.859: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AH.
00:27:56.061: >> I BELIEVE HE MIGHT BE MAKING THE SITE PLAN PRESENTATION.
00:27:59.164: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: GOT IT.
00:28:02.835: >> I'M NOT SEEING THE AUDIO INDICATION NEXT TO HIS ZOOM NAME. SO I'M WONDERING IF HE'S UP ABLE TO HAVE AUDIO ALSO. SO HE MAY NEED TO CALL IN TO PROVIDE AUDIO.
00:28:26.492: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: HMM.
00:28:29.662: >> LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET THAT NUMBER.
00:28:54.486: >> AND I'M HAPPY TO START THE PRESENTATION, IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE. JUST -- WELL, WE DON'T HAVE DEAD AIR AND IF HE HAPPENS CHIME IN, BY ALL MEANS, HE CAN TAKE OVER AT THAT POINT.
00:29:08.267: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT SOUNDS GOOD. AND PERHAPS IF THEY ARE NOT GETTING AUDIO FROM US, HE CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO CALL IN.
00:29:17.242: >> SO I'M CHRIS CHENG, THE CITY PLANNER ON THIS PROJECT. FOR THOSE OF NOT FAMILIAR WITH ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI, IT'S OFF STADIUM BOULEVARD, WEST OF ST. FRANCIS AND NORTH OF WINCHELL AVENUE. THERE'S ACTUALLY, ANOTHER ACCESS POINT FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE WEST. THEY ARE PROPOSING A 14,500 SQUARE FOOT ADDITION ON TO THE SITE AND THAT'S COLORED IN THE ORANGE THAT YOU CAN SEE, THE ARROW THAT I HAVE GOT ON THERE. IT WILL BE TWO STORIES. WE WILL SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE ELEVATIONS. IT DOES MEET THE MINIMUM PARKING STANDARDS. IT'S REQUIRED TO, HAVE I THINK, 800 -- OVER 800 AND IT'S GOT 880, SOMEWHERE IN THERE, THAT AMOUNT OF PARKING SPACES. THEY ARE REQUESTING A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, SINCE IT IS ZONED R1B. ANY CHURCH USE REQUIRED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION. ANY ITEMS THAT WILL BE FEEDED. IT'S A VER FOR TREES ALONG WEST STADIUM BOULEVARD. IT'S VERY, VERY NARROW BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO PLANT TREES THERE, BUT THEY ARE PLANNING TO MEET THE STREET TREES THAT ARE ALONG ST. FRANCIS AND ALONG WINCHELL AVENUE. SO THEY WILL MEET THE TREES LONG THOSE TWO STREETS. THEY ARE REQUESTING A LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION. THAT FOR THE BIO RETENTION. THIS IS A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED SITE PLAN. THEY WILL NOT TOUCH THESE PARKING LOTS, THE LARGE PARKING LOTS. LET'S SEE WHAT OTHER SLIDES --
00:31:10.556: >> HELLO, CHRIS.
00:31:11.223: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
00:31:13.525: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU.
00:31:19.765: >> THANK YOU FOR FILLING IN. I THINK YOU DESCRIBED VERY MUCH WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO. IF I CAN WALK THROUGH THE PLANS REAL QUICKLY, AND I HOPEFULLY WON'T TAKE VERY LONG. IF WE CAN START ON THE EAST SIDE IN THE LIGHT BLUE COLOR, THAT'S EXISTING SCHOOL, THE K-8 SCHOOL. WHAT ROD KN HAD MENTIONED, THE ACTIVITY CENTER THAT THEY RRENTLY HAVE, IF YOU LOOK THE -- KIN OF TOWAR OFEFT OF THAT - YEAH, RIGHT WRE CHRIS HAS HIS CURSOR RIGHT NOW THAS THE EXISTING ACTIVITY CTER. IT'S KIND OF AMO AULTIUSE SPACE. IT'S CAFETERIA FOR THE SCHOOL AND THE MUSIC ROOM FOR THE SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE CABINETS FOR INSTRUMENTS AROUND THE SIDES OF THE ROOM. THAT'S THE SPACE THAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO SUPPLEMENT WITH THIS MINISTRY CENTER. SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE ARE ADDING ANY PEOPLE TO THE SCHOOL. WE ARE NOT ADDING ANY PEOPLE TO THE CHURCH. WHAT WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A SPACE THAT'S MORE FUNCTIONAL FOR THE ADULTS TO USE, A SPACE THAT'S MORE READILY AVAILABLE FOR MEETINGS, FUNERAL DINNERS, LUNCHES, WEDDING RECEPTIONS AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT GO ON IN THE FACILITY. SO IF WE COULD -- AND WHAT CHRIS WAS SAYING, SHOWING THE PARKING LOT, THERE'S A GRAY STRIPE THAT RUNS THROUGH THE PARKING LOT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE ENGINEERING DIVISION HAD ASKED US TO DO WAS TO LOOP THE EXISTING 8-INCH WATER MAIN. THE SITE HAS A 6-INCH WATER MAIN. WE ARE TEARING UP THE EXISTING ASPHALT TO PUT IN THE NEW WATER MAIN AND THEN PATCHING IT UP. THE MINISTRY CENTER DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL PARKING. THE PARKING IS BASED ON THE CHURCH. THE CHURCH SEATS ABOUT 850 PEOPLE. SO ROUGHLY ABOUT 283, 284 PARKING SPACES. OKAY? FIRST FLOOR PLAN, CHRIS? CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE.
00:33:19.084: >> YES. YOU CAN'T SEE IT.
00:33:22.955: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WE ARE JUST SEEING FIRST SLIDE.
00:33:25.457: >> THE FIRST SLIDE?
00:33:26.792: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WE ARE HAVING ALL KINDS OF TECHNICAL ISSUES.
00:33:33.732: >> IT'S A NEW SHARE IT'S LIKE NEW SHARE.
00:33:37.302: >> CAN YOU CLOSE OUT AND SHARE AGAIN, CHRIS?
00:33:40.105: >> OKAY. I WILL CLOSE OUT AND I WILL PUT IN THE NEW -- WE WANTED TWO. I DON'T THINK WE EVER HAD A PRESENTATION THAT DIDN'T HAVE A TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM. THIS IS FIRST FLOOR PLAN AS ROB HAD MENTIONED EARLIER. THIS IS TUCKED INTO THE HILL. SO IT'S A ONE AND A HALF STORY BUILDING. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON SOUTH PORTION OF THIS IS THE KITCHEN AND THE STORAGE ROOMS, THE TOILET ROOMS AND THE MECHANICAL ROOMS, THE THINGS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY NEED DAYLIGHT THAT ARE TUCKED INTO THE SIDE OF THE HILL BELOW GRADE AND THEN WHAT TONIGHT NORTH SIDE IS THE MULTIPURPOSE MINISTRY CENTER. THE LIGHT WALLS THAT GO THROUGH THIS SPACE ARE OPERABLE WALLS THAT ARE INTENDED TO SUBDIVIDE IT INTO DIFFERENT SIZE ROOMS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEETINGS AND DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND THINGS THAT MAY OCCUR. WHEN ALL THE OPERABLE WALLS ARE OPEN, IT SEATS ABOUT 300 PEOPLE AT TABLES AND CHAIRS, AND IT SEATS ABOUT 600 PEOPLE IF THEY WERE SEATED IN ROWS. AND, AGAIN, THE BIG KEY HERE WAS THEY WANTED A SPACE THAT HAD NICE CEILING HEIGHTS. YOU HAVE ABOUT 16 TO  18-FOOT CEILING HEIGHTS IN HERE. A PLACE THAT WAS VERY INVITING AND USABLE. NOT A CAFETERIA, A MUSIC ROOM, A MULTIPURPOSE ROOM, ALL ROLLED INTO ONE. SO IF WE COULD GO TO THE SECOND FLOOR. HESTILL DON'T HAVE ANYTHINGON T.
00:35:40.692: >> STILL NOT THERE?
00:35:42.461: >> NOT YET.
00:35:49.701: >> LET'S -- LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN. SHARE SCREEN.
00:36:16.128: >> LET'S SEE HERE.
00:36:17.462: >> ALMOST.
00:36:17.929: >> WELL, LET'S SEE HERE. WHY IS THIS -- IT SAYS YOUR SCREEN SHARING IS PAUSED. IS THAT SOMETHING I HIT?
00:36:25.203: >> I THINK SO. OKAY. LET ME -- LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN THEN. IT'S PAUSED? LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.
00:37:04.976: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THERE WE GO.
00:37:06.311: >> THAT HE IS AT ROOF PLAN.
00:37:08.146: >> LET'S GO TO THE ROOF. LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET TO THE SECOND FLOOR THEN.
00:37:11.349: >> IF WE CAN GO BACK JUST ONE REAL QUICKLY.
00:37:15.620: >> LET'S TRY. IT TRY IT.LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.
00:38:29.227: >> EXTERIOR ELEVATIONS ARE THIS RIGHT NOW.
00:38:30.795: >> I WILL SEE IF I CAN OPEN UP THE FILE, AND OPEN UP THE OTHER ONES, I WILL REOPEN THE OTHER SHEETS, IF WE CAN -- I KNOW IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF ORDER BUT I WILL SEE IF I CAN'T OPEN UP --
00:38:43.341: >> OKAY.
00:38:43.608: >> LET ME SEE IF I CAN OPEN UP THE SECOND PAGE.
00:38:49.814: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IF I MAY, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE FOCUS ON THE EXTERIOR, IF WE ARE -- IF IT'S GETTING CLUNKY, JUST IN TERMS OF TIME. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO THE EXTERIOR ELEVATIONS OR ANY OTHER SITE ISSUES. I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE ARE -- WE ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING TONIGHT. SO IF YOU COULD VERBALLY DESCRIBE WHAT IS HAPPENING. I DON'T THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO SEE THE SECOND FLOOR.
00:39:20.045: >> THE SECOND FLOOR IS BASICALLY THE OFFICES. THERE ARE SOME PARISH OFFICES RIGHT NOW ATTACHED TO THE SCHOOL AND WE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THOSE OFFICES UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR. THEY WERE PUT INTO THE ORIGINAL BUILDING LIKE A -- NOT THE CONVENT FOR THE NUNS, FOR THE SCHOOL. SO IT WAS MORE OF A RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE ANTHER MAKESHIFT OFFICES. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE NEW OFFICES AND MAKE THEM FULLY ACCEACCESSIBLE AND MAKE THEM ACOUSTICALLY ACCEPTABLE. AND AGAIN, BECAUSE THIS IS TUCKED INTO THE SIDE OF THE HILL, THEY WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE FROM GRADE ON THE UPPER LEVEL, AND THERE'S A FEW PARKING SPACES OFF TO THE SUITE SIDE TO ACCOMMODATE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL WORK IN THE OFFICES. CHRIS HAD THE ELEVATIONS UP THERE JUST A SECOND AGO, AND WE HAVE LOST THEM AGAIN.
00:40:14.566: >> HELP. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. LET'S GET THAT UP THERE. LET'S -- YOU CAN'T SEE THEM YET?
00:40:23.942: >> NOT YET.
00:40:32.317: >> I CAN SEE THEM AT HOME, UNFORTUNATELY. BUT THOSE OF YOU AT HOME CAN'T. LET'S TRY THIS --
00:40:37.889: >> YOU COULD TRY TO SHARE YOUR ENTIRE SCREEN INSTEAD OF JUST PICKING DOCUMENTS MAYBE AND THEN AS YOU FLIP THROUGH IT, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KEEP STOPPING SHARING. WE WON'T JUDGE YOU IF YOUR DESKTOP IS MESSY.
00:40:52.437: >> WELL, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST GUIDE ME THROUGH THAT COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. I'M LOOKING AT THE ELEVATIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY YOU ARE NOT, AND I --
00:41:00.078: >> YOU HAVE TO SHARE YOUR SCREEN AGAIN. THE TOP LEFT GRID --
00:41:20.131: >> I DON'T HAVE THE TOP LEFT. I HAVE THE SHARE SCREEN AT THE BOTTOM.
00:41:22.967: >> AND THEN WHAT DOES IT BRING UP?
00:41:25.970: >> SO IT --
00:41:26.471: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: LIKE A MENU OF --
00:41:27.672: >> I WILL TRY TO SHARE MY SCREEN, CHRIS. I THINK I FOUND THEM.
00:41:31.176: >> DID YOU? GREAT!
00:41:32.811: >> I THINK SO. DO YOU SEE --
00:41:35.647: >> I DO!
00:41:40.085: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: CAN YOU TOGGLE THROUGH IT?
00:41:43.188: >> THERE WE GO.
00:41:43.988: >> THANK YOU, KRISTEN.
00:41:45.690: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THANK YOU!
00:41:47.525: >> MM-HMM.
00:41:47.826: >> NEXT ONE WAS THE OFFICES, IF YOU COULD GO ONE MORE -- YES, THAT WAS THE OFFICES. YOU CAN SEE SHADED IN THERE IN YELLOW. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING TO THE NORTH IS JUST THE CEILING PLAN OF THE PARISH CENTER. OKAY? AND THEN THE NEXT ONE. THIS ONE IS THE ROOF PLAN. WHAT HELPS US DEMONSTRATE IS THAT WE HAVE A PITCHED ROOF ON THE PARISH CENTER TO MATCH THE PITCHED ROOF THAT'S ON THE CHURCH. IT WILL BE THE SIMULATED CEDAR SHAKE METAL SHINGLE AND THEN THERE A AWE FEAR AREAS WHERE WE ARE PROPOSING TO PUT THE MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT. MOST OF THAT IS CONCEALED BY THE PITCHED ROOF. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT ONE, THE ELEVATION SHEET. THE ELEVATION AT THE VERY TOP, THAT'S THE NORTH ELEVATION. THAT WILL BE THE MOST PROMINENT ELEVATION OFF STADIUM BOULEVARD. WE HAVE ONLY COLORED IN THE NEW PORTION ON THE RIGHT. ON THE LEFT IS THE EXISTING PORTION. THE CHURCH BEING A LITTLE BIT TALLER THAN THE PARISH HALL BECAUSE THE CHURCH IS MORE PROMINENT, MORE IMPORTANT ON THE SITE. THE WEST ELEVATION WILL BE AN ELEVATION THAT'S LESS OBVIOUS THAN THE NORTH, BUT STILL ABLE TO SEE FROM STADIUM. IF YOU WERE TRAVELING EAST SON N STADIUM, WOULD YOU SEE THIS WEST ELEVATION AND THEN THE ELEVATION AT THE BOTTOM IS THE ONE THAT'S TUCKED INTO THE SIDE OF THE HILL AND THIS WOULD BE THE ENTRANCE TO THE OFFICES, THE PARISH OFFICES UP AT THE TOP OF THE HILL. SO NEXT SHEET. THIS IS JUST A CONCEPTUAL RENDERING THATUR DESIGN DEPARTMENT PUT TOGETHER TO SHOW HOW IT WLD LOOK IF YOU WERE -- AGAIN, IF U WEREOMING ON STADIUM, GOING FROM THE WEST TO TOTHE EAST, YOU WOULD SEE THE THEARISH CTER TES ALL THE CUESROTHE CHURC WE USED THE SAME BRICK AND T SAMEOLORINGND THE SAMETY NDS. WEAVE THE SAME ERANCES WIT EITTLE PEAKEDOO THE IDEA WAS TO KEEP IT VERY TRADITIONAL AND MAKE IT FEEL LIKE IT WAS PART OF THE CAMPUS, LIKE IT BELONGS THERE, LIKE IT WAS ALWAYS PLANNED TO BE THERE. SO, AGAIN, WE TRIED TO KEEP IT CONTEXTUAL, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, NOT NECESSARILY TRYING TO CHANGE ANYTHING THAT'S THERE, JUST TRYING TO COMPLIMENT IT ALL AND HOPEFULLY EVERYONE AGREES THAT WE DID A GOOD JOB ON THAT. THE PARKING LOT IN THE FOREGROUND IS THE EXISTING PARKING LOT. WE WILL RESEAL IT AND EVERYTHING WHEN CONSTRUCTION IS ALL COMPLETE. SO IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM.
00:44:32.023: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD, MR. CHENG, BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE PUB I C HEARING.
00:44:38.696: >> YES, JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS TO ADD TO THE STAFF REPORT THERE. WILL BE THREE LANDMARK TREES TAKEN DOWN AND THAT'S TO ACCOMMODATE THE ADDITION PLUS THE STORMWATER DETENTION. IT DOES MEET 100 YEAR STORM. THEY ARE OVER DETAINING ON SITE BECAUSE OF THE CLAY SOILS. WE ALSO HAD A DISCUSSION IF THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE ORDINANCE IS PASSED BEFORE THIS PETITION IS PASSED, WE HAVE BEEN COORDINATING THAT THE PETITIONER WILL HAVE TO INSTALL SOME ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS. AT THE TIME, RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE PLANNING ON POSSIBLY INSTALLING A COUPLE OF STATIONS, BUT IT WOULDN'T MEET CODE. SO WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS, AND IT'S NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME. WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHERE THE NEW ORDINANCE COMES INTO PLAY. AND THEN FINALLY, I THINK WHEN I WAS GIVING THE PRESENTATION, I DID MISSPEAK ON THE PARKING. THERE IS 260 SPACES THAT ARE REQUIRED ON SITE AND THEY ARE PROPOSING 28267 282. THEY ARE NOT INCREASING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF STUDENTS PERMITTED AT THE SCHOOL OR THE NUMBER OF PARISHIONERS AT THE CHURCH. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, STAFF IS GOING FOR -- OR LEMMING FOR APPROVAL FOR THIS PETITION AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
00:45:45.930: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THANK YOU, MR. CHENG AND NOW I WILL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI PETITION. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877853-5247 AND ENTERING MEETING ID 99577681361.

WHEN SPEAKING PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTINY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND NOISE SO SO WE MAY HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS.
00:46:41.886: >> NO CALLERS HAVE INDICATED.
00:46:46.657: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. WHY DON'T WE GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. HAD NOBODY COMING UP?
00:47:04.642: >> ONE CALLER.
00:47:05.843: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. CALLER ENDING IN 335, YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:47:19.957: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:47:20.825: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
00:47:22.293: >> YES.
00:47:22.560: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS LISA FINE. I LIVE AT 2033 MEDFORD ROAD. AND I WAS WONDERING IF ONE OF THE PRESENTERS COULD GIVE US A SENSE OF WHEN THEY EXPECT CONSTRUCTION TO START AND COMPLETE. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NOISE THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
00:47:44.782: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY, WE WILL MAKE SURE TO ADDRESS THAT DURING OUR DISCUSSION.
00:47:53.291: >> THIS IS BRIAN WITH HOBBS AND BLACK.
00:47:57.361: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WE USUALLY DON'T ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AS THEY COME UP. WE CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WE HAVE IT AS PART OF OUR DISCUSSION. HOLD TIGHT TO YOUR ANSWER AND WE WILL MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS IT DURING OUR DISCUSSION.
00:48:08.706: >> OKAY. APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
00:48:09.974: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: MM-HMM. ANY OTHER CALLERS?
00:48:16.647: >> NO CALLERS HAVE INDICATED.
00:48:17.882: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. NOW, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND READ THE MOTIONS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE PETITIONS TONIGHT. SO I WILL TAKE THEM ALL TOGETHER, UNLESS ANYBODY HAS ANY OBJECTIONS. ANYBODY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT? OKAY. SEEING NONE, THE FIRST MOTION ON THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION FINDS THE PETITION SUBSTANTIALLY MEETS THE STANDARDS IN CHAPTER 55 ANN ARBOR UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.295 SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND THEREFORE APPROVES THE ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR CHURCH AND SCHOOL USES. THIS APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS. THE PROPOSED USES WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE OBJECTIVES IN THE MASTER PLAN PERMITS CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS BY SERVING RESIDENTS IN THE DIS STRICT, AND PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC, PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS OR ROAD INTERSECTIONS BASED ON THE LOCATION AND THE EXISTING USES, A SITE PLAN DOCUMENTING THE EXISTING AND PROPOSED CONDITIONS OF THE SITE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AS PART OF THIS APPLICATION. THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS. THE CHURCH MUST -- THE CHURCH USE MAINTAINS A MAXIMUM SEATING CAPACITY OF 1,000 PERSONS AND SCHOOL OCCUPANCY IS LIMITED TO 675 STUDENTS. THE FLOOR AREA TOTAL FOR BOTH OF CHURCH, PARISH AND SCHOOL DOES NOT EXCEED 78,000 SQUARE FEET. THE SECOND MOTION READS AS FOLLOWS THAT ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES THE PROPOSED LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED LANDSCAPE PLAN, ACCORDING TO CHAPTER 55 ZONING ORDINANCE, SECTION 5.30.2A, 2E, SUBJECT TO THE SITE PLAN. AND THE THIRD IS THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE ST. FRAP SIS OF ASSISI, TO NOT PLAN STREET TREES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY AND THE EV PARKING SPACES IN THE EV ORDINANCES PASS BEFORE THE SITE PLAN. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. OKAY. SO WE ARE IN DISCUSSION.
00:50:36.821: >> THIS IS BRIAN.
00:50:40.958: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AHEAD, COMMISSIONER LEE.
00:50:43.361: >> Commissioner Lee: SURE. WHEN DO WE EXPECT CONSTRUCTION TO START AND HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?
00:50:57.408: >> THIS IS BRIAN WITH HOBBS AND BLACK. WE ARE EXPECTING TO GO OUT FOR BIDS HERE IN JANUARY AND THEN CONSTRUCTION WOULD START PROBABLY LATE SPRING, EARLY SUMMER, BEST CASE SCENARIO. OBVIOUSLY, EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENT ON FUND-RAISING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE GET DIOCESAN APPROVAL, BUT THE GOAL IS TO START IN THE LATE SUMMER. WE WILL PROBABLY TAKE 14 TO 16 MONTHS TO -- FOR CONSTRUCTION TO BE COMPLETED THEN.
00:51:30.207: >> Commissioner Lee: WHAT LEVEL OF DECIBEL NOISES CAN NEIGHBORS AT TAPPAN MIDDLE SCHOOL EXPECT FROM THE CONSTRUCTION?
00:51:39.617: >> YOU KNOW, I CAN'T GIVE YOU ACTUAL DECIBEL LEVELS BUT WE WOULD -- WE WOULD RESTRICT CONSTRUCTION TO, YOU KNOW, HOURS OF 7 A.M. TO 4 P.M. WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AT NIGHT OR ON WEEKENDS. WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IT DURING WEEKDAYS. THERE WILL BE THE USUAL, YOU KNOW, TRUCKS BACKING UP WITH THE BEEPING SOUND, WHICH IS USUALLY THE MOST ANNOY THING AND WE WILL TRY TO MAKE SURE WE DO THOSE AGAIN BETWEEN 7 A.M. AND 4 P.M.
00:52:10.414: >> Commissioner Lee: THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE.
00:52:14.752: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
00:52:19.290: >> Commissioner Abrons:  HI. I NOTICED IN THE STAFF REPORT THERE WAS A MENTION OF NEIGHBORHOOD PARTICIPATION MEETING, AND A NOTE THAT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE NOT HEARD ANY FEEDBACK FROM RESIDENTS REGARDING THE PROPOSAL AND THE -- SORRY, I'M SCROLLING QUICKLY TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T MISSTATE THE DATE. AND I BELIEVE THE POSTCARD THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE REPORT THAT WE GOT CITES A MEETING FROM OCTOBER OF 2018. I WONDERED IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY OTHER MEETINGS OR IF -- IF THERE WAS ANYTHING TO REPORT FROM THAT MEETING THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THIS COMMISSION IN TERMS OF NEIGHBORHOOD SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OR JUST QUESTIONS AROUND THE PROJECT.
00:53:01.932: >> WE HAD A COUPLE OF THE MEETINGS. AGAIN, YES, THEY ARE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BECAUSE THE PROJECT STARTED IN 2016, AND IT'S BEEN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO GET EVERYTHING PLANNED AND PULLED TOGETHER AND ORGANIZED. ONE WAS IN SEPTEMBER AND ONE WAS IN OCTOBER. THERE WERE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT SHOWED UP. MOSTLY THE QUESTIONS REVOLVED AROUND, ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A STAGE? ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO PRESENTATIONS FOR THE KIDS? THERE WEREN'T REALLY ANY OBJECTIONS OR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THAT. IT WAS MOSTLY, YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING BE TO THE FUNCTION OF THE SPACE? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO UTILIZE IT?
00:53:37.968: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. THANK YOU. THAT WAS MY ONLY QUESTION FOR NOW. THANKS.
00:53:41.906: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:53:44.341: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THANK YOU. I HAD A SIMILAR QUESTION. I NOTICED THAT THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE OF A QUESTION FOR STAFF. DO WE HAVE ANY START OF STATUTE OF LIMITATION ON CITIZEN PARTICIPATION. DOES IT COME TO A POINT THAT IT'S BEEN SO LONG AND WE NEED TO DO ANOTHER ONE. IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, NEW PEOPLE COULD HAVE MOVED INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAVE NO IDEA THAT THI PROJECT IS HAPPENING, BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THE POST CARD THE FIRST TIME?
00:54:11.469: >> YEAH, THERE WERE ACTUAL MINUTES THAT I REQUESTED FROM THE PETITIONER. AFTER READING THEM, I DIDN'T THINK THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE THAT HELPFUL. THAT MAY FL ON ME A LITTLE BIT AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE IF YOU GO TO ETRACK, YOU CAN SEE THE MINUTES. AS THE PETITIONER WAS INDICATING, THERE REALLY WASN'T TOO MUCH FEEDBACK OR ANYTHING OF CONCERN. SO KIND OF LEFT THOSE OUT AND JUST WANTED TO DOCUMENT WHEN THE MEETING WAS. AS FAR AS NOTIFICATION FOR THE NEIGHBORS, I DID POST A COUPLE OF SIGNS BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A LARGE LOT, FACING FOUR STREETS. SO THERE WAS THAT ASPECT. I POSTED THAT, I THINK TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE MEETING. IT'S ALSO ADVERTISED IN THE NEWS, A ALSO WE SETP POSTCARDS WITHIN 300 FEET OF THE SUBJECT SITE. SO THE NEIGHBORS SHOULD BE, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST IN CLOSE PROXIMITY, YOU KNOW, BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE UPCOMING MEETING.
00:55:06.490: >> Commissior Hammerschmidt: THENE TWO YEARS AGO?
00:55:08.125: >> NO, NO, FOR TONIGHT.
00:55:09.793: >> Comssioner Hammerschmidt:
00:55:10.728: >> THERE BEEN RECENT NOTIFICATIONS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
00:55:13.597: >> Commissioner Hammerschmid EXCELLENT! THANK YOU. I WAS CURIOUSF THERE WE NOTES FM THAT MEETING. GOOD TO KNOW THAT THEWERE BENIGN. I'M WDERING I DURINGHE COTRUCTION PROCESS AND THIS MIGHT BE STANDD PRACTE, BUT YOU MIGHT BEBLE T PUT UP A GN OR SOMHING WITH CONTACT INRMATION  CASE THINGET NOISY  NEIGHBORS- YOU KNO TH IS HAPPENING ADJACENT TO A THERE ARE CONRNS AT THEASE NEIGHBORS HAVE THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, CALL SOMEBODY THAT COULD HELP THEM DEAL WITH WHATEVER NOISE ISSUES OUT OF THE ORDINARY MIGHT BE HAPPENING. I THINK ESPECIALLY WE HAVE NO IDEA WITH PEOPLE WILL BE WORKING NEXT YEAR. WE CAN ALSO BE WORKING FROM HOME. I UNDERSTAND WHY THERE COULD BE CONCERN ABOUT NOISE DURING THE DAY. SO THAT'S A REQUEST TO THE PETITIONER IF YOU LOOK INTO SOME SORT OF SIGNAGE WITH CONTACT INFORMATION DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD.
00:56:12.856: >> THIS IS BRIAN WITH HOBBS AND BLACK AGAIN. TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO, WHEN WE AWARD THE CONTRACT, WE WOULD HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING WITH THE CONTRACTOR THERE AND THE CONTRACTOR'S FIELD SUPERINTENDENT WHO IS THERE EVERY DAY, WE WOULD GIVE THAT CONTACT INFORMATION OUT SO THAT THAT PERSON COULDE REACHED. AND TYPICALLY THEY DO GET A PHONE CALL EVERY NOW AND THEN. THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE. THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF DIRT AND DUST IN THE ROAD THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP. THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO DO IS HAVE OUR KICKOFF MEETING AND INVITE THE NEIGHBORS, AND HERE'S WHERE THE TRAILER IS GOING TO BE HERE AND HERE'S WHERE THE PRESEFENCEIS GOING TO BE. ALL THE ACCESS GOING TO BE OFF STADIUM BOULEVARD. THEY WILL COME OFF THE EXISTING PARKING LOT AND THEY WILL USE THAT AS THE STAGING AREA.
00:57:02.840: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: GREAT. JUST SO I'M CLEAR IF A RESIDENT DOES NOT COME TO THAT MEETING, WILL THERE BE SIGNAGE OR SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGH -- OR THAT THEY HAVE THAT CONTACT INFORMATION DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD?
00:57:14.251: >> WE CAN POST A NUMBER ON THE CONSTRUCTION SIGN, SURE. I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT. THERE WILL BE THE NAMES OF THE OWNER, THE ARE AKILL TECH AND THE CONTRACT -- ARCHITECT AND THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE ON THAT SIGN.
00:57:26.930: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I THINK HAVING IT JUST IN CASE THEY NEED IT PROBABLY MAKES PEOPLE FEEL A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE WHEN THEY SEE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS GOING ON. OTHER THAN THAT, I THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION, THE RENDERING LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. IT LOOKS LIKE IT FITS IN SEAMLESSLY WITH WHAT IS THERE NOW AND THE SOUND LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE A GREAT USABLE SPACE FOR YOUR STUDENTS AND PARISHIONERS. THANKS.
00:57:52.856: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS? COMMISSIONER LEE?
00:57:57.628: >> Commissioner Lee: YES, I'M SORRY. JUST BECAUSE I'M NEW TO THIS, PLEASE EXCUSE ME IF ANYTHING SEEMS OUT OF ORDER. HAS THERE BEEN ANY COORDINATION WITH TAPPAN MIDDLE SCHOOL. THE ONLY REASON I ASK -- AGES AGO, I USED TON TH TO BE THERE E TENNIS COURTS AND THE BASKETBALL COURTS FACE STADIUM. I WONDER WHEN SCHOOL DOES EVENTUALLY GO BACK IN, IF THERE'S ANY EFFORT TO COORDINATE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION. I JUST DON'T WANT MIDDLE SCHOOLERS, YOU KNOW, AFFECTED BY DUST AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVER BEEN GIVEN THOUGHT. THAT'S JUST A COMMENT I HAVE, JUST THINKING ABOUT -- I GUESS IT'S A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD, BUT JUST -- JUST THE THOUGHT HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONTACT WITH THE MIDDLE SCHOOL JUST TO LET THEM KNOW, HEY, THIS IS HAPPENING AND WE CAN PROBABLY COORDINATE?
00:58:47.911: >> WE HAVEN'T SPECIFICALLY REACHED OUT TO THEM AT THIS TIME, BUT I THINK THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS WE WOULD INVITE TO THE PRECONSTRUCTION MEETING, JUST SO THEY WERE AWARE WHEN THEY WERE STARTING AND WHAT THE HOURS OF CONSTRUCTION WERE AND EVERYTHING. IF THERE WAS ANY INTERFERENCE FOR THE PICKUP AND THE DROP OFF FOR THE KIDS AT THE SCHOOL AND THEN WE WANT TO BE AWARE OF THAT AND COORDINATE WITH THEM.
00:59:10.200: >> Commissioner Lee: GOTCHA. THANK YOU. AND AS SARAH SAID OR COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, I THINK IS HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO TECHNICALLY SAY, IT THE ARCHITECTURAL RENDERING AND THE MATERIALITY CONSISTENCY LOOKED ADMIRABLE AND FLEX SPACE IS REALLY WHAT, I THINK IS USEFUL. SO THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD. THANK YOU.
00:59:34.558: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS? I HAVE A QUESTION, ACTUALLY, AND THIS IS FOR STAFF. WITH THE -- NOT DOING THE STREET TREES IN BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE BACK OF THE CURB ALONG STADIUM, ARE THOSE TREES STILL THE NUMBER OF TREES STILL INCLUDED BUT ELSEWHERE ON SITE OR ARE THEY JUST LESS THE WHATEVER IT WOULD BE REQUIRED, LIKE TEN TREES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALONG THERE AS PART OF THEIR SITE PLAN.
01:00:07.357: >> I CAN'T SAY DEFINITIVELY, IT'S POSSIBLE THE PETITIONER MAY KNOW.
01:00:10.727: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
01:00:12.296: >> DURING THE REVIEW, IN AREAS THERE'S ONLY A 2-FOOT WIDE GAP BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE ROAD. AND SO THERE WAS NOT ROOM FOR CERTAIN SPECIES OF TREES THERE. THEY PROPOSED TREES THAT WOULD BE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, BUT I COULDN'T SAY IF IT WOULD BE THE SAME AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED ON THE STREET TREES AND I'M HOPING I CAN EITHER GO BACK AND LOOK IN THE ETRACKING OR MAYBE THE PETITIONER KNOWS, YES, THEY ARE PLANTING WHAT IS REQUIRED.
01:00:35.586: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WOULD THE PETITIONER ADDRESS THAT?
01:00:37.921: >> CHRIS, YES, THIS IS TOM DUMOND, YES, THE TREES REQUIRED ALONG STADIUM ARE ON OUR PROPERTY JUST OUTSIDE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. WE MEET THE NUMBER OF TREES BUT THEY ARE NOT IN THE RIGHT LOCATION.
01:00:58.575: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. IT'S A STRETCH THAT DOESN'T HAVE A TON OF TREES THAT SHADE THE STREET, AND SO I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE ON THE PRIVATE PROPERTY SIDE AND WHEN THEY GET BIG ENOUGH, THEY WILL SHADE THE SIDEWALK AND THE BIKE LANES THERE. SO ANY OTHER COMMENTS, QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION? ALL RIGHTY. SO I THINK WE MAY BE READY FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE, MR. CHENG.
01:01:34.211: >> OKAY.
01:01:34.478: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
01:01:42.019: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
01:01:45.355: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
01:01:46.490: >> Commissioner Lee: YES.
01:01:47.057: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES. COMMISSIONER MILLS, OH, I'M SORRY SHE RECUSED HERSELF. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:01:59.503: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
01:02:08.345: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
01:02:09.246: >> Commissioner Clarke: YES.
01:02:09.846: >> OKAY. MOTION PASSES.
01:02:10.447: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ALL RIGHTY. I THINK WE ARE ON TO THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM AND I BELIEVE COMMISSIONER MILLS WILL NEED TO BE PROMOTED BACK INTO THE MEETING. SO OUR NEXT ITEM IS 9B WHICH IS THE 416 WEST HURON PARKING LOT PAVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL.
01:02:33.136: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:02:35.339: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YOU'RE ARE A WELCOME. WELCOME BACK!
01:02:40.010: >> Chair Mills: THANKS. YOU TEED UP THE TI TITLE OF WHAS COMING. WHILE PEOPLE MOVE AROUND, WHILE THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM COMES IN AND OUT, I WILL READ WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. SO THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO RECONSTRUCTION AN EXISTING PARKING LOT, ACING STORMWATER CONTROLS AND LANDSCAPING, SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS DUE TO THE ALLEN'S CREEK TRAIN DRAINE EASEMENT. IT WILL DECREASE FROM 96 TO 94 SPACES AND FOUR NEW BICYCLE PARKING SPACES WILL BE PROVIDED ON THIS .81-ACRE SITE WHICH IS ZONED D2 DOWNTOWN INTERFACE. THE PETITIONER IS INCLUDING TWO LANDER L LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION REQUESTS AND WAIVING THE TES FOR THE RIGHT-OF-WAY ISLANDS DUE TO RESTRICTIONS AND A VARIANCE IS REQUIRED HERE. AS PER USUAL, WE WILL START WITH THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION FOR UP TO 10 MINUTES AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO MR. KOWALSKI BEFORE OPENING THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION. OF. DO YOU HAVE YOUR FULL TEAM HERE? INTO.
01:03:51.148: >> YES, MATTHEW BUDDS WILL BE DOING THE PRESENTATION. OF.
01:03:56.787: >> I BELIEVE HE HAS PERMISSION TO SHARE THE SCREEN IN A MINUTE.
01:04:07.297: >> Chair Mills: WE CAN SEE IT.
01:04:08.098: >> ALL RIGHT. GOOD EVENING. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:04:10.300: >> Chair Mills: WE CAN.
01:04:11.268: >> YES, WE CAN.
01:04:12.002: >> GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS AND STAFF. MY NAME IS MATTHEW BUDDS. I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE MOORE BUD, DIDS LAW AND ALSO ON THE CALL IS HUGO SERON FROM SME WHO HAS BEEN PROVIDING THE ENGINEERING FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. WHAT WE HAVE IS A SET OF PARKING LOT IMPROVEMENTS AND TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF THE OVERSIGHT. THAT'S THE PROPERTY, IF YOU RECOGNIZE IT ON WEST HURON JUST WEST OF THE RAILROAD TRACKS JUST WEST OF DOWNTOWN, I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY I WOULD DESCRIBE THAT. AND THAT'S A VIEW OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE PROPERTY. WE ARE TALKING ONLY ABOUT PARKING LOT IMPROVEMENTS ESSENTIALLY AT THIS LOCATION. THAT WILL SHOW YOU THE AREA OF WORK JUST AGAIN WEST OF THE OLD ANN ARBOR RAILWAY AND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF HURON STREET. THE CURRENT SITUATION, IS A SOMEWHAT DETERIORATING ASPHALT PARKING LOT. ON THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE PROPERTY. NORTHERN HALF HAS ON THE PICTURE TO THE RIGHT, THE GRAVEL PARKING LOT STRETCHES TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY WHICH IS TO THE NORTH. THE OVERALL GOAL HERE IS TO REHABILITATE AND REPAIR, RESURFACE THE EXISTING ASPHALT PARKING LOT, AND TO REMOVE ALL OF THE GRAVEL AND REPLACE THAT THEN WITH A CON CONTIGUOUS ASPHALT PARKING LOT STRETCHING TO THE NORTH. THE OVERALL GOALS ARE TO IMPROVE THE PARKING LOT FOR THE TENANT AND THE COMMUNITY. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HURDLES TO JUMP, BASED ON THE NATURE OF THIS PROPERTY. IF YOU REVIEWED THE PLANS, YOU SEE THAT THE ALLEN CREEK EASEMENT WHICH IS A COUNTY DRAIN EASEMENT, RUNS RIGHT DOWN THE HEART OF THE PARKING LOT PROPERTY HERE WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO -- WELL, I WILL SAY DO MUCH CONSTRUCTION AND PLANT ANY SIGNIFICANT TREES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND THEREFORE, WE HAD TO, I WILL SAY DUAL CHALLENGES OF ADDING PARKIN ISLANDS, BUT THEN ALSO NOT REALLY BEING ABLE TO -- DUE TO OUR OBLIGATION WITH THE COUNTY DRAIN BE ABLE TO PLANT INSIDE THOSE. THAT'S THE REQUEST FOR THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION. WE WILL ALSO NEED TO PROCEED WITH THE ZONING BOARD FOR VARIAN FROM THE STREET TREES, BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY LOCATION WHERE THOSE COULD BE PLACED ALSO WITHIN THAT ALLEN CREEK DRAIN EASEMENT. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH THERE. WE HAVE A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF THE OVERVIEW OF THOSE PLANS SO THAT YOU CANEE, AGAIN, ADDING THE LANDSCAPE ISLANDS. THE OTHER PART THAT I THINK THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR BOTH THE COMMUNITY AND THE PROPERTY IS THE ADDITION OF THE GREEN SPACE THAT IS ALONG THE EASTERN STRETCH OF THAT PROPERTY. RIGHT NOW IF YOU SEE THE PINK HASHED LE, THAS A RETAINING WALLORHE RAILROAD THAT IS GHT IN TT AREA. AND THE PARKING CURRENTLY GOES I WILL SAY BEEEEMED SOR OFS, DESIRABLE CONTION THAT W ULD LIKEEMOVE. THERE'S ATECISIONF GRE SPACE SOR O BIO AA ALO AT AREA AND THEHE AITION THERE'S AO GOING T B A COMPLIANCE WIT AS MANY OF T REQUIRENTS AS WE COULD WITHOUT VING TO B WITHIN THE DRAIN EASEMENT, AS FAR AS CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER, ADDITION OF PLANTINGS INSIDE THE INTERIOR OF THE PROPERTY, AND SO OVERALL, IT'S OUR VIEW THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE PROVIDED HERE WILL BE BETTER FOR THE TENANTS, THE CLIENTS AND THE COMMUNITY. AND WE ARE ALSO REMOVING IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. SO ACTUALLY REDUCING THAT DOWN AND ELIMINATING GRAVEL PARKING, WHICH I WILL SAY I BELIEVE CITY STAFF AND MYSELF BELIEVE WILL BE AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE PROPERTY. ALSO INCREASE AND BRING THE PARKING LOT INTO MORE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CITY STANDARDS. AND OVERALL INCREASING THE LANDSCAPED AREA AND THE GREEN SPACE. I THINK ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS PRESENTLY, THERE ARE 96 PARKING SPACES IN THIS PARKING LOT, AND DUE TO THE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE NECESSITY OF THE COMPLYING WITH SOME OF THE OBLIGATIONS, IT IS REDUCING DOWN TO 75, BUT WE THINK IT WILL BE AN OVERALL IMPROVEMENT TO THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE. WITH, THAT I WON'T TAKE UP ANY OTHER TIME WITH PRESENTATION. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM, BUT ABOUT H HOPEFULLY THAT'S A T OVERVIEW.
01:08:55.251: >> Chair Mills: VERY SUCCINCT. MR. KOWALSKI, ANYTHING TO ADD? I WILL HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ITEMS AT THIS TIME. AS MR. BUDDS HAD MENTIONED. THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS BEING REQUESTED, FOR -- ONE IS FOR THE MODIFICATION TO ALLOW LANDSCAPE ISLANDS, INTERIOR LANDSCAPE ISLANDS TO BE PLANTED WITHOUT THE REQUIRED TREES. WE DO HAVE -- I'M SURE THIS IS A QUESTION THAT WILL COME UP, PROBABLY BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. WE HAVE THE AMOUNT OF REQUIRED LANDSCAPE ISLANDS ARE PROVIDED IN THERE, HOWEVER, THE TREES ARE NOT PROVIDED. AND THEY ARE ALSO PROVIDING VEGETATION IN THOSE ISLANDS AS FAR AS LIKE SHRUBS. THE MOST THAT THE WATER RESOURCES COMMISSIONER WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PLANT. SO THAT IS REGARDING THE ONE MODIFICATION FOR THE LANDSCAPE ISLANDS TO NOT HAVE TREES. THE OTHER IS THE RIGHT-OF-WAY BUFFER. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, THERE'S A BUFFER REQUIRED BETWEEN THE PARKING LOT AND THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. THEY HAVE THE REQUIRED AREA, BUT THEY CANNOT PUT THE REQUIRED TREES IN THERE, BECAUSE OF AGAIN, THE WATER RESOURCES COMMISSIONER PROHIBITION TO PUT TREES ABOVE -- AND, AGAIN, WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING THE 50. EASEMENT. THE CREEK RUNS DIRECTLY UNDER THE SITE WHICH IS THE REASON -- AND IT'S NOT THAT DEEP. AGAIN, THE SECOND MODIFICATION WOULD BE TO WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR RIGHT-OF-WAY TREES -- SORRY, NOT RIGHT-OF-WAY TREES BUT FOR BUFFER TREES WITH THE RIGHT-OF-WAY BUFFER. THE VARIANCE REQUEST IS REGARDING THE STREET TREES. SO THERE ARE FIVE STREET TREES REQUIRED FOR THE SITE. THERE ARE THREE THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXISTING AND THOSE THREE WILL REMAIN. HOWEVER, THE OTHER TWO THAT BE REQUIRED TO BE PLANTED, AGAIN ARE BOTH DIRECTLY ABOVE THE DRAIN. SO THE WATER RESOURCE COMMISSIONER IS NOT ALLOWING THEM TO PLANT THE TREES. THAT'S NOT AN ITEM THAT'S ELIGIBLE UNDER LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION. SO IF THE PETITION IS APPROVED TONIGHT, IT WOULD GO FORWARD TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS IN THE JANUARY MEETING FOR APPROVAL OF THAT VARIANCE. SO THE MODIFICATIONS COULD BE APPROVED TONIGHT. THE -- AN IF THE PETITIO IS APPROVED WITH THE MODIFICATION, THE VARIANCES WILL BE APPROVED IN JANUARY. AND ANOTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT, AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SITE PLAN, THERE'S A LOT OF GREEN SPACE BEING ADDED TO THE SITE. SOME THINGS THAT ARE -- WILL BECOME COMPLIANT. THEY HAVE THE EXISTING LAND USE BUFFER, ON THE WEST SIDE. SO THEY WILL HAVE THE REQUIRED TREES, AS WELL AS THE REQUIRED DISTANCE IN THERE. AND ALSO, AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW. THIS SITE IS DIRECTLY WHERE IT'S PLANNED FOR THE TREE LINE TRAIL, AND IN THAT MASTER PLAN, SO THE PETITIONER DID WORK WITH US INITIALLY TO AGREE TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT LAND WHETHER REMOVING PARKING THAT'S NOW CURRENTLY ENCROACHING INTO THE RIGHT-OF-WAY ALONG THE -- OF THE RAILROAD IN THEY A IN THERE. THEY ARE PULLING THAT BACK. THERE'S ADDITIONAL SCREEN SPACE. SO THE PETITIONER DID EXPRESS THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE -- OR WILLING TO GRANT AN EASEMENT IN THE FUTURE FOR SOME OF THAT TREELINE ALONG THAT AREA. SO THAT IS -- AGAIN, IT'S NOT PART OF THIS PROPOSAL TONIGHT. IT'S NOT BEING APPROVED AS PART OF IT, BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT DID COME THROUGH -- NOT NEGOTIATIONS, BUT THROUGH THE MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THE STAFF REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS SITE. AS WE NOTED. THAT WAS A MASTER PLAN REQUIREMENT AND THE PETITIONERS AGREED TO J ENTERTAIN THAT IDEA GOING FORWARD. THEY ARE APPROVING THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS, AS WELL AS THE PARK LOT IMPROVEMENTS TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:13:09.806: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU ETCH. HAVE I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING. MHEARING.MR. BUDDS IF YOU WOULDD STOPPING SHARING YOUR SCREEN. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE 416 WEST HURON PARKING LOT IMPROVEMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247 AND THEN ENTERING MEETING ID 995-7768-1361. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE, CALLING ON THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF THE TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE TELLING YOU THAT YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. YOU CAN DO THAT BY PRESSING STAR SIX. AND WHEN SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION AND BACKGROUND SOUNDS AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE HAVE ANY CALLER. WE WILL GIVE IT A MINUTE BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A TV DELAY, IN CASE PEOPLE DO WANT TO CALL IN. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL R CLOSE TE PUBLIC HEARING AND READ THE PROPOSED MOTIONS. ARE THERE ANY OBJECTIONS? NO. THEY ARE THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVES THE 416 WEST HURON PARKING LOT SITE PLAN, CONDITIONED UPON A VARIANCE BEING GRANTED BY THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS FOR TWO STREET TREES AND THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVES THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS ACCORDING TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.20, .3. A TO REQUIRE ONE TREE, WHERE THREE TREES ARE REQUIRED AND SECTION 4.20.3. B TO REQUIRE NO TREES IN THE INTERIOR LANDSCAPE ISLANDS WHERE SIX TREES ARE REQUIRED DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE ALLEN CREEK DRAIN DIRECTLY BELOW THE SITE. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH? WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:15:51.868: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IS THERE ANY WAY THAT SOMEBODY COULD SHARE THE PLAN SO WE COULD -- I WOULD LIKE TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE EXACTLY THE EASEMENT IS AND ISN'T IN RELATION TO THE PROPERTY.
01:16:04.914: >> I CAN -- OH, THERE YOU GO, MATTHEW BUDDS.
01:16:12.688: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: DOES THIS SHOW THE LANDSCAPE PLAN. COULD YOU GO TO THE SHEET WITH THE LANDSCAPE PLAN AND IF YOU ZOOM IN A BIT. THAT'S GREAT. COULD YOU LET US KNOW, IT'S THIS DASHED AREA IN THE MIDDLE? WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE EASEMENT.
01:16:36.846: >> YOU CAN'T SEE MY MOUSE MOVING, OUT THE DASHED AREA, AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S OUTLINED. IT SAYS APPROXIMATE OF THE ALLEN CREEK DRAIN EASEMENT. THAT'S THE LOCATION. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IS WHERE THAT CREEK IS KIND OF EXACTLYUNDER NEATH THERE. THEY HAVE A GOOD IDEA. THAT'S THE WHO H WHOLE EASEMENT. IT CUTS THROUGH THE ENTIRE SITE. IN THE BACK, THERE IS A BUILDING LOCATED ON IT. SO THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR ANY REDEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE IS KIND OF LOCKED BY THIS AS WELL.
01:17:13.549: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT. OKAY. AND COULD YOU SCROLL DOWN A LITTLE BIT SO WE CAN SEE THE INTERFACE WITH HO HURON AS WELL. SO IN TERMS OF STREET TREES. THE BUILDING TO REMAIN THE 416 WEST HURON, DOES THAT HAVE EXISTING STREET TREES IN FRONT OF THAT WITH THE GREEN?
01:17:36.405: >> HE. THEY ARE EXISTING. YOU CAN SEE THE CIRCLES JUST SOUTH OF THE EXISTING BUILDING. THOSE THREE STREET TREES ARE THERE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IF YOU MOVE OVER A LITTLE BIT, THERE'S THAT LANDSCAPE ISLAND THAT DOESN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN ADJACENT T'S AN AREA THAT ALSO DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
01:17:55.658: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS ROOM AT ANY DIFFERENT PART OF THE SITE AND THEY HAVE TREAT TREES.
01:18:06.068: >> I DID MISSPEAK REGARDING THE RIGHT-OF-WAY ROUGHER. THERE IS ONE TREE THAT DOES COUNT FORHE RIGHT-OF-WAY BUFFER TREES. AND AGA, THEY ARE PLANTING THE REQUIRED SHRUBS AND LOWER PLANTS, JUST NOT THE TREES.
01:18:28.324: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. ALL RIGHTY. I JUST WANTED TO GET A INDIVIDUAL OF IT. THIS LETS ME KNOW ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS THAT THEY HAVE AND THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF ROOM. I WAS HOPING THAT MIGHT BE PLACES TO PLACE THESE TREES IN OTHER SPOTS BUT REALLY EVERYTHING LOOKSRETTY FILLED UP.
01:18:45.041: >> YES, WE DID -- WITH THE LANDSCAPE, OUR LANDSCAPE STAFF REVIEWING, WE ARE DID LOOK AT -- SHE DID ALSO LOOK AT THAT AND WE WENT BACK A FORTH BUT BETWE ILDINGS FOR T BUILDINGS, THER JUST ISN.
01:19:03.059: >> Commissner Gibb-Ranll: I N SEE THAT. ANKS F -- THANKSOR I LOOM TING ME. I APPRECIATE NA THAT.
01:19:18.541: >> Cha Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RDALLDO YOU HE
01:19:20.109: >>ommissior Gibb-Randl: WAS MAR TO PCEOMETHING.RE AS CMISSIONER MILL KNOWS, WE THIS SITE, NOT TOO FAR SO WE WALK BY HERE A LOT. AND A LOT OF HARD SCAPE! IT REALLY IS. AND ANY WAY TO GREEN IT, AND I'M GLAD THAT IT'S TIGHTENING AND GETTING MORE EFFICIENT SO THAT THERE ARE SOME LEFTOVER GREEN SPACES AND THAT THEY ARE PLANTING WHAT THEY CAN, ESSENTIALLY. JUST LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OPPORTUNITIES, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MAXED OUTT THEY CAN. SO. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMISSIONERS. COMMISSIONER AB RONES.
01:20:07.890: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I WONDER IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHEN THE STREET TREES WERE PLANTED. THE DATE IS JULY 2020. I WONDER IF THEY ARE SAPLINGS.
01:20:26.075: >> FROM MY LANDSCAPER, THEY SAID THEY WERE EXISTING AND THEY REDID THAT STREET LAST -- I THINK THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH AND COMPLETED THE TREE PLANTINGS. I DID DOUBLE CHECK IT WHEN I POSTED IT.
01:20:49.498: >> Chair Mills: THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO REPLACE A B REPLACE A BU.
01:20:58.340: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IF THEY ARE NOT THERE, WE CAN INSERT AN AMENDMENT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE THERE. THANK YOU.
01:21:06.882: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
01:21:09.251: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: COMMI SSIONER ABRONS BEING I'M LOOKING AT THE WASHTENAW COUNTY GIS, WHICH IS JUST UPDATED AND I CAN JUST SEE THREE LITTLE THINGS COMING OUT OF THE GROUND. SO I'M PRETTY SURE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.
01:21:22.364: >> Commissioner Abrons:  MORE RELIABLE THAN GOOGLE STREET VIEW. THANKS.
01:21:36.479: >> Chair Mills: MR. BUDDS, IT LOOKED YOU WANTED TO CONFIRM SOMETHING.
01:21:39.748: >> YES, THE FIRST SET OF TREES DIED AND THEY WERE REPLANTED. THERE ARE THREE TREES THIS IN A VERY YOUNG STATE, I BELIEVE.
01:21:56.999: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:21:57.933: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THERE'S A BIG HONEY LOCUST, JUST DOING WHATEVER YOU CAN TO PROTECT THAT DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. WHAT I FOUND IS THAT CONTRACTORS WANT TO STORE STUFF UNDER TREES. THEY JUST WANT TO SO THE MORE YOU CAN TRY TO -- YOU HAVE TREE CONSTRUCTION, BUT TO CREATE SOME BARRIERS AROUND THAT TO TRY TO KEEP THAT ONE GOING, I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY LIKE THE BEST TREE IN THAT E AREA IN TERMS THE SPECIES AND THE HEALTH AND IT'S AMAZING GIVEN ITS LOCATION. ANYTHING EXTRA THAT YOU CAN DO IN TERMS OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS ITSELF, WOULD BE GREAT TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT TREE THROUGH THE ROUGH TIME OF CONSTRUCTION.
01:22:53.455: >> Chair Mills: I ASSUME THAT THAT IS THE ONE RIGHT ON THE SIDEWALK, AND I LOOKED AT THE PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT CIRCLE WAS THERE. BECAUSE IT'S A NICE TREE.
01:23:04.633: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES YEAH, IT'S A REALLY NICE ONE.
01:23:08.671: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER COMMISSIONER COMMENTS. I DO WALK AND I HAVE TO CYCLE ON THE SIDEWALK THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE STREET. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE A AB I STOP- BE THE STOP LINE THERE, AND THAT ONE IS NOT QUITE AS LINED AS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS WHERE THAT ALLEY IS WHICH IS SUPER BLIND AND SUPER DANGEROUS. I APPRECIATE THE ACCOMMODATIONS THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN MADE AND CONTINUING THAT, JUST TO MAKE IT SAFER BECAUSE THAT SIDEWALK IS HEAVILY USED. AND SO I -- I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT SITUATION ANY WORSE THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. OH, COMMISSIONER LEE.
01:24:14.903: >> Commissioner Lee: STAFF, PLEASE FEEL FREE IF THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE NORMALLY ASK. TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF PEDESTRIANS USING THAT SIDEWALK, I'M LOOKING AT THE SIGNAGE, MONUMENT SIGNAGE THAT'S ON THE SOMEWHAT YOU CAN THERE AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S REPRESENTING THAT PARTICULAR BUILDING BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A FAIRLY AUTO CENTRIC SIGN WITH A LOT OF DIVERSITY, I'M WONDERING, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON MONUMENT SIGNS. FROM THE OWNERSHIP STANDPOINT, IS THERE ANY PLANS TO EITHER REDO THE MONUMENT SIGNS. I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW, GET OFF TOPIC WITH RESPECT TO WHAT IS BEING REQUESTED, BUT AS FAR AS THIS PARTICULAR SITE GOES, IT'S VERY LARGE. IS THAT AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION, STAFF? SORRY.
01:25:01.317: >> CERTAINLY, YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING SIGNAGE ON THE SITE. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD TOPICALLY EXAMINE RIGHT AT THIS INTEREST PO, HOWEVER, THEY DO -- IF -- I MEAN, THE COMMISSIONERS -- SORRY, MAYBE MR. BUDDS COULD COMMENT WHETHER THEY HAVE PLANS TO REPLACE THE SIGN GOING FORWARD. IT'S A QUESTION THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED, IF IT'S BLOCKING YOUR VISIBILITY OR SOMETHING ELSE OF THAT NATURE. YEAH. THAT'S -- THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FAIR. AT THIS POINT, I WOULD DEFER TO MR. BUDDS TO SEE IF THEY HAVE PLANS TO -- IF THEY REFACE THE SIGN EVENTUALLY, THINGS LIKE MODIFICATIONS IT WILL HAVE TO BE BROUGHT INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE CURRENT CODE AND I HAVE NO IDEA -- I'M WILLING TO BET IT PROBABLY ISN'T, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT. SEIDESO A DECENT QUESTION. MR. BUDDS?
01:25:47.529: >> AT THIS TIME, I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY PLANS. SIGN IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OR THE DISCUSSION AS FAR AS THIS SITE PLAN HAS BEEN. BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE CAN GO BACK AND TALK WITH THE OWNERSHIP ABOUT AND SEE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS, YOU KNOW, AS THINGS MOVE FORWARD THAT THERE COULD BE IMPROVEMENT IN THAT REGARD.
01:26:07.182: >> AND, AGAIN, COMMISSIONER LEE I THINK IT'S FAIR QUESTION BECAUSE IF OUR TRAFFIC -- WHEN OUR TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC TEAM, WHEN THEY DO LOOK AT ITEMS THEY DO LOOK AT VISION, THINGS LIKE THAT, THE THINGS THAT COULD BE BLOCKING VISION. SO I MEAN, WHY SAY FOR A FACT THAT THEY DID -- I CAN'T SAY FOR A FACT THAT THEY DID THAT ON THIS SITE, CHIC SHE DID EXAMINES SITE AND FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE.
01:26:34.443: >> Commissioner Lee: THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS WE HAD.
01:26:37.146: >> SHOULD I DO THE ROLL CALL VOTE?
01:26:39.815: >> Chair Mills: YES, GO FOR IT, PLEASE.
01:26:45.187: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
01:26:49.591: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
01:26:52.961: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
01:26:53.929: >> Commissioner Lee: YES.
01:26:54.496: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
01:27:00.602: >> Chair Mills: YES.
01:27:01.069: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
01:27:07.509: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
01:27:10.112: >> Commissioner Clarke: YES.
01:27:12.915: >> Chair Mills: IT WAS A QUIET YES, BUT I HEARD A YES.
01:27:15.984: >> OH, I'M SORRY. I COULDN'T FIND YOU ON MY LITTLE CUBE OF PEOPLE. I WAS LIKE WHERE IS SHE? THE ITEM IS APPROVED.
01:27:23.425: >> THANK YOU ALL.
01:27:25.127: >> I'M SORRY, WAS THIS REGARDING -- YOU TOOK ALL THE MOTIONS AT THE SAME TIME, CORRECT? SO THIS WAS REGARDING THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS AS WELL AS THE SITE PLAN. I WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR.
01:27:33.702: >> Chair Mills: RIGHT. SO IT NEEDS TO GO TO ZBA, BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST AS LONG AS THAT IS POSITIVE, IT NEED NOT, IT APPEARED FROM THE MOTIONS NEED TO GO TO CITY COUNCIL.
01:27:44.780: >> CORRECT. YEP. SO AFTER THIS, AGAIN PENDING ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS APPROVAL OF THE STREET TREE, WHICH AGAIN, FOR COMMISSIONERS, YOU GOOS COULD PROBABLY FIGURE OUT, STAFF DOES SUPPORT THAT VARIANCE, BUT THAT WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR THE THE JANUARY MEETING.
01:27:59.561: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. THANK YOU.
01:28:00.629: >> THANK YOU.
01:28:01.763: >> THANK YOU ALL.
01:28:09.938: >> SORRY, I WILL LET COMMISSIONER MILLS.
01:28:11.874: >> Chair Mills: SO OUR NEXT ITEM OF BUSINESS IS 9C, WHICH IS THE LEWIS JEWELER'S RETAIL PLAZA SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. WHAT I PROPOSE COMMISSIONERS, IS THAT WE HEAR THE PRESENTATION BY THE PETITIONER AND STAFF -- AND HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WE'LL TAKE A BREAK BEFORE WE START DISCUSSION OF THAT, JUST BECAUSE WE'LL BE ABOUT HALF WAY. GREAT. SO THIS IS A REQUEST TO REDEVELOP 300 SOUTH MAPLE WHICH IS A 1.98-ACRE SITE ZONED C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL. AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM. SO AS PER USUAL, YOU WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO PROVIDE A PRESENTATION AND THEN WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO MR. KOWALSKI TO FILL IN ANY STAFF COMMENTS. DO YOU SEE EVERYONE FROM YOUR TEAM HERE THAT YOU ARE EXPECTING.
01:29:15.971: >> I DO. I BELIEVE MR. KERR WILL GIVE THE PRESENTATION AND I SEE THE OTHER MEMBERS ALSO ONLINE.
01:29:21.710: >> Chair Mills: EXCELLENT. VERYOO
01:29:39.494: >> OKAY. HELLO, EVERYBODY. CAN YOU ALL SEE MY SCREEN?
01:29:43.198: >> Chair Mills: WE CAN.
01:29:43.832: >> GOOD. GOOD. GREAT.
01:29:45.133: >> WELL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TONIGHT. AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT 300 SOUTH MAPLE. IT IS A -- IT WAS THE BISTRO PROPERTY THAT'S BEEN VACANT FOR QUITE SOMETIME AND OUR PROJECT TEAM THAT'S ON THE LINE TONIGHT IS STEVE BROUWER AND CANDACE BRIER FROM METRO CONSULTING AND ASSOCIATES. AND I'M ROBERT KERR WITH METRO GROUP ARCHITECTS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A QUICK SHOW OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO ON THE PROJECT. ALL RIGHT. SO IF YOU GO UP AND SEE THIS ON THE SCREEN, IT IS THE EXISTING CORNER BISTRO. THE BUILDING WAS VACANT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. IT'S 300 SOU MAPLE ROAD. IT'S A 1.98-ACRE SITE ZONED C3. THE WAY THEROPERTY WOR RIGHT THE SOUTHEAST,ND THERE'S QUITE A BIT OFLOPE, AS Y WILL SEE IN THEAY W RESPONDED T THE PRERTY. THE IS AN EXISTG COMMON PARKIN AGREEMENT TT DID, WH AGAIN,O THE NORTH OTHE. PROPERTYS E ZIMMERM'S RD USE. AND WEST GATE IS ALONG -- AS YOU SEE IN THE BACK THERE, AND THEN KROGER IS TO THE SOUTHWEST OF US. OUR PLAN -- THE MODEL PLAN SHOWS WHAT WE PROPOSE TO DO AND SHOW TO YOU TONIGHT. IT CONSISTS OF THREE SUITES. AS YOU KNOW, LEWIS JEWELERS IS DOWN THE STREET ON STADIUM BOULEVARD. THEY HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE 19 -- OR THEY HAVE BEEN SERVICING ANN ARBOR AND DETROIT SINCE 1921, AND THEY ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO MOVING TO THE NEW SITE. THEY WOULD BE IN WHAT WE WOULD CALL SUITE NUMBER ONE, WHICH IS HERE. I'M HOPING YOU CAN SEE MY ARROW. AND THEN THERE ARE TWO OTHER SUITES, WE CALL THIS SUITE NUMBER TWO, AND SUITE NUMBER THREE. TO THE NORTH OF US, AGAIN, IS CHASE BANK AND ZINGERMAN'S AND TO THE WEST OF US IS THE SHOPPING CENTER. SO OUR PLAN SHOWS HERE THAT WE ARE GOING TO -- WE WOULD LIKE TO CONSTRUCTION 24,000 SQUARE FEET. THE BUILDING WOULD BE 28 FEET HIGH. WE ARE MOVING ALL THE BUILDING DOWN TO THE THE EAST OF THE PROPERTY AND RIGHT UP TO ON TO SOUTH MAPLE. WE ARE RIGHT AT THE SETBACK LINE, THE 10-FOOT LINE. SO WE ARE RIGHT UP AT THE STREET. AND WE DO HAVE AND WE ARE REQUESTING A DRIVE THRU HERE AT THE BASE. NEXT TO SUITE NUMBER THREE. WE ARE LOOKING FOR A TENANT THERE RIGHT NOW. WE DO HAVE PATIO SPACE OUT FRONT FOR TYNEING. SO WE ARE -- FOR DINING. SO WE ARE EXPECTING THE POSSIBILITY TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE A COFFEE SHOP THAT WOULD BE SERVING COFFEE AND THEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIT OUTSIDE AND TO BE IN THE -- BEING OUTSIDE WOULD BE GREAT. ADDITIONALLY, ON THE SITE, WE ARE SHOWING ANOTHER PATIO AREA. WE ARE THINKING THAT THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SORT OF QUICK DINING LOCATION WITH OUTDOOR DINING AND THEN THERE'S A -- WE CREATED A PARK HERE IF YOU WILL, A GREEN SPACE WITHIN THE SHOPPING CENTER THAT FOLKS COULD SIT THERE AND HAVE THEIR LUNCH IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SHOWN HERE, WE HAVE RESPONDED TO SOME IDEAS AND REQUESTS THAT A SIDEWALK THAT TO -- TO CONNECT FROM SOUTH MAPLE INTO THE SHOPPING CENTER. SOL WE GLADLY PROPOSE A SIDEWALK HERE TO ALLOW PEDESTRIANS INTO THE PROPERTY TO EITHER GO UP TO THE SHOPPING CENTER OR ON INTO OUR CENTER LEWIS JEWELERS WILL BE HERE. THEIR MAIN ENTRANCE WILL BE ON THE NORTH AND THEN WE'LL HAVE FOUR TENANTS OR UP TO FOUR TENANTS HERE WITH THEIR FACE ENTRY HERE ON THE NORTH SIDE. THE SIDEWALKS ARE WIDE, EXCESSIVELY WIDE. THEY ARE DOUBLY WIDE. THE INTENT THERE IS IF WE WANTED TO IS SEATING OR BREAK FROM THE PEDESTRIANS AN THE PARKING. AT THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY OR HERE BETWEEN US AND THE SHOPPING CENTER, AGAIN WE HAVE A GREEN BUFFER AND WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF LANDSCAPE. THERE'S UNDERGROUND RESENTION. AND WE HAVE ON THE PROPERTY, SOME OF THE STATISTICS. VEHICLE PARKING FOR 81 CARS AND 10 BIICL10 BICYCLE. BICYCLE.AND THEN WE HAVE SOME E. WITH THAT, LET ME GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS JUST THE ARCHITECTURAL BREAKDOWN AND SHOWING YOU THE SUITES AND HOW THEY WILL BE DIVIDED. AND THIS IS A RENDERING OF THE FACADE FROM THE NORTH. THIS WOULD BE THE NORTHLE E VACATION. SO THE MAIN ENTRY INTO LEWIS IS HERE. AND THEN THE OTHER FOUR TENANTS FROM SUITE NUMBER TWO AND THEN THE PATIO AREA AND THEN THE OTHER TWO SUITES ARE HERE ON THE -- THAT WOULD BE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY. AND LOOKING BACK ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY, SHOPPING CENTER IS OVER HERE. THIS IS THE BANK. AND THEN ZINGERMAN'S IS UP AHEAD THERE AND THIS WOULD BE THE DRIVE THRU AREA. AND, AGAIN, OUTDOOR SEATING AND PATIO AREA HERE, WITH PATIO AND GREEN SPACE HERE. SO THAT IS OUR DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT. STEVE BROUWER AND CANDACE ARE HERE. IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SITE PLAN, CANDACE WOULD BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT AND STEVE IS THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR.
01:37:11.479: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:37:12.781: >> THANK YOU.
01:37:15.183: >> Chair Mills: MR. KOWALSKI.
01:37:16.384: >> SURE. THANK YOU. I DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT TO ADD. I DID WANT TO -- AS COMMISSIONERS HAVE NOTICED, WE ARE REQUESTING POSTPONEMENT HERE TONIGHT. REALLY, THE MAIN ITEM REGARDING THE POSTPONEMENT IS THE TRANSPORTATION REVIEW THAT WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR A FINAL REVIEW, AND REALLY, WHERE THE CONCERN LIES WAS REGARDING THE DRIVE THRU, AND ITS LOCATION. AS MY REPORT NOTES, THIS IS -- THIS IS MORE OF A REVISED PLAN THAN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY REVIEWED BY THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER. SO THIS VERSION HAD COME BACK LAST WEEK, THAT SHOWS A TWO-WAY DRIVE ON THAT SOUTH PART OF THAT SITE. PREVIOUSLY IT WAS A ONE-WAY EXIT ONLY DRIVE. OUR TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER EXPRESSED CONCERNS REGARDING THAT, BECAUSE OF THE USE OF THIS AREA THAT GOES THROUGH. IT'S KIND OF AN IOA AISLEWAY THT GOES TO WEST GATE, TO THE WEST. AND THERE'S A RECORDED ACCESS EASEMENT THAT REQUIRES TWO-WAY TRAFFIC THROUGH THERE. SO WITH THAT, THE PETITIONER HAS AGREED TO CONVERT THIS BACK TO A TWO-WAY INGRESS EGRESS AISLE WAY. HOWEVER, DID S THE REVIEW OF THAT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED BUT WHERE THE TRANSPORTATION -- MY PRELIMINARY FEEDBACK, SHE DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE CUING OF CARS AT THE DRIVE THROUGH, AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT -- THEY COULD JUT OUT -- THEY COULD STICK OUT INTO THE TRAFFIC. AGAIN, DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF USE IS PROPOSED, THERE I MEAN, SOME DRIVE THRUS CAN HAVE QUITE A BIT OF TRAFFIC, AS WE SEE ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS AND IF THE CARS WERE STICKING OUT AT THAT SEND, IT WOULD BE STICKING OUT DIRECTLY INTO THE TRAFFIC LANE THAT -- THAT THROUGH LANE THERE. BUT I DO NOT HAVE A FINAL CONFIRMATION ON HER OFFICIAL REVIEW. THE THINGS I CAN ADD TO IT, THE SOURCE OF THE DRIVE THRU -- IT'S NOT THE DRIVE THRU ON THE SITE BUT MORE THE LOCATION OF IT HERE AND THE QUEUE ARRANGEMENT AND THE DRIVE LINE. AND THE REASON WE WANTED TO PUT THIS BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMISSIWE WANTED TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THE DRIVE THRU USE AND THE GENERAL PLAN LAYOUT. WE SUPPORT THE STAFF PLAN LAYOUT IN GENERAL. IT'S OFFERING A LOT OF UPGRADED TO THE SITE AS IT CURRENTLY SITS DOWN WITH NO EXISTING DETENTION, AND LANDSCAPING OUT OF COMPLIANCE. ALSO ONE KEY FEATURE, THAT WE WANTED TO STRESS HERE WHICH IS SOMETHING WE REQUESTED IS THE SIDEWALK CONNECTION THAT GOES FROM MAPLE TO WEST GATE. THAT WAS A PRETTY IMPORTANT CONNECTION. THERE IS, AGAIN, AS YOU ALL KNOW, WEST GATE IS A PRETTY POPULAR SHOPPING CENTER AND IT GETS A FAIR AMOUNT OF VEHICULAR, AS WELL AS PEDESTRIAN AND NON-MOTORIZED TRAFFIC. THERE IS NO DIRECT LINK TO MAPLE RIGHT NOW. SO THAT SIDEWALK WOULD PROVIDE A NICE LINKAGE DIRECTLY TO THE WEST GATE SITE. THEY ARE PROVIDING THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL VEHICLE PARKING SPACES THAT WILL BE INSTALLED. COMPLIANT ON THE SITE, THEY ARE LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THAT SITE. AND ALSO REGARDINGARKING, THEY ARE AT THE BARE MINIMUM OF PARKING OF WHAT IS REQUIRED, WHICH, AGAIN IS OBVIOUSLY ALLOWED AND REFERRED IN SOME INSTANCES AND AS YOU KNOW -- AND THEY DO HAVE A CROSS PARKING EASEMENT WITH WEST GATE, HOWEVER, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY NEEDED BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAVE THE REQUIRED PARKING AT THE SITE ALREADY, BUT THAT'S AN EASEMENT THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR QUITE A WHILE. SO REALLY WITH THAT, THAT KIND OF CONCLUDES MY STAFF PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME. AND I GUESS I WILL PUT IT BACK TOOMMISSIONER -- OR CHAIR MILLS.
01:41:05.413: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND MR. KERR, WE MAY WELL ASK YOU TO SHARE YOUR SCREEN AGAIN LATER, WHEN WE HAVE REQUESTS, BUT IF YOU CAN STOP SHARING FOR JUST A MOMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING, I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
01:41:25.266: >> BE HAPPY TO.
01:41:28.836: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW I WILL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247, AND ENTERING MEETING ID 99577681361. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS FOR THOSE WHO RAISE THEIR HAND DIGITALLY, YOU WILL BE CALLED UPON BY THE LAST THREE NUMBERS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU SHOULD GET AN AUTOMATED REONSE. PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION AND BACKGROUND SOUNDS AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. I SEE THAT THERE'S ONE CALLER ON THE LINE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS ITEM, YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. TIME TOO, IN CASE THERE'S THE DELAYITH THE BROADCA. NINE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBC HEARING. AN BEFORE WE ENTER INTO DISCUSON, WHY DON'T WE TAKE A FIVE-MUTE, ISHAT OKAY? A FI-MINUT BRE. WE WILL RECONNE AT 8:50. BREA]
01:49:59.646: >> Chair Mills: I SEE, EVERYBODY -- ALL SQUARES FILLED. SO IILL READ THE MOTIONS. THERE ARE TWO OF THEM THAT I WILL TAKE TOGETHER. OKAY. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNSEL IS APPROVE THE LEWIS JEWELERSERS RETAIL PLAZA SITE P, REQUIRING THE OFFSITE SEWER EASEMENT AND THE WATER MAIN SEIZEMENT, PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF ANY BUILDING MER MITT. AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION, FINDS THE PETITION SUBSTANTIALLY MEETS THE STANDARDS IN CHAPTER 55 ANN ARBOR UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.29.5 SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. AND THEREFORE, APPROVES THE LEWIS JEWELERS RETAIL PLAZA SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR ONE DRIVE THRU LANE AS PART OF A RETAIL USE. THIS APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS. ONE, THE PROPOSED USE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT ZONING DISTRICT, WHICH PROVIDES COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ACCESSED PRIMARILY BY AUTOMOBILE. TWO, THE PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC, PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS OR ROAD INTERSECTION BASED ON THE LOCATION. SOUTH MAPLE ROAD PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE SITE AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OUR TRAFFIC MOVEMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMER HAR HAMMERSCHMIDT AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS FOR POSTPONEMENT. WHEN WE SEE THIS AGAIN -- WAS THAT FEBRUARY?
01:51:48.088: >> THEY REQUESTED TO A DATE CERTAIN SO THAT IT COULD GIVE THE PETITIONER AND THE STAFF A DEFINITIVE TIMELINE, BUT AS ALWAYS, AGAIN, THAT WAS -- THAT'S A STAFF THING. I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS OPEN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION DISCUSSION AS WELL.
01:52:04.738: >> Chair Mills: OKAY, BUT WHEN WE SEE IT THEN, IF THERE'S ANYTHING -- QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OR COMMENTS IN THE INTERIM, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
01:52:17.518: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: THANK YOU. SO I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING THE DRIVE THRU. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT HAS TO DO WITH JUST ACCESS POINTS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY CARS CAN FIT INTO THE DRIVE THRU AND WHAT TRAFFIC MIGHT OCCUR BECAUSE OF THAT. I JUST THINK THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HAVING QUITE A BIT OF TRAFFIC AND BECAUSE THAT DRIVE, EVEN WHEN QUA CORNER BISTRO, I SEE TS AS SOMETHING THAT'S BEING HEAVILY USED BECAUSE PEOPLE GET THAT DRIVEWAY CONFUSED WITH THE KROGER DRIVEWAY. NOT ONLY ARE THEY GOING INTO WEST GATE BUT THEY ARE GOING INTO THE KROGER PARKING LOT. AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S GOING TO BE SUPER SAFE. SO I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS AROUND THAT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF HOW THAT DRIVEWAY -- OR HOW THAT DRIVE THRU WILL OPERATE AND HOW THE CARS ARE GOING TO BE CUED AND HOW THE PARKING AROUND THAT AREA IS GOING TO WORK BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE THAT I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO SORT THROUGH. AT THIS POINT, I'M IN FAVOR OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S THERE. BUT I'M NOT -- IF THE DRIVE THRU IS WHAT IT APPEARS, THAT IT'S GOING TO BE, I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF GRANTING THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR THAT. AND THE OTHER THING WITH UNIVERSITY DRIVE THRU, I FREQUENT SOME DRIVE THRUS, ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT SIMILAR SITUATIONS ARISE AT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE STARBUCKS AT ANN ARBOR/SLAIN ROAD RIGHT BY MEIJER. THAT'S SORT OF RIGHT ON ANN ARBOR/SLAIN ROAD. THAT IS A -- SOMEWHAT OF A SIMILAR DRIVE THRU AND THAT HAS -- AND WHEN THE CARS ARE CUED UP AND INTO THE MAIN ROAD AT THAT POINT. THE ERR  OTHER DRIVE THRU IS THK DRIVE THRUOR THE NORTH MICHIGAN CREDIT UNION ON SOUTH STATE STREET, WHERE THE CARS ARE LITERALLY PARKING ON STE STREET TO GET INT THE DRIVE THRU. JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR PEOPLE TO MANVER ARND THAT REA. BIGGEST CONCERN.IS MY THE SOND TNG I WANTED TO TALK AUT IS THE TRA. I -- YOUNOW, ION'T KNOW IF BUT HAVIN ARASH CONTAINER, WEST GATE SHOING CTERTHE GREA ESPECIAY IF YOURE AREOOKING ONTO THE TSH,U WHERE THE TRASH CONTAINERWI BE REMOVED. SO JUST GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AS WELL. SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU.
01:55:14.761: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT AND THEN COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:55:18.031: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I LEARNED SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE TRASH. I LIKE THAT YOU PUT IT IN THE SCREENED PARK SPACE BUT THEN THE TRASH IS LIKE RIGHT AT THE CORNER OF THE PARK. SO BESIDES, I THINK I SHARE SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT THE DRIVE THRU. I THINK WHEN THIS COMES BACK, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN JUST SAID. BUT THE GARBAGE RIGHT BY THE PARK, WAS MY OTHER BIG CONCERN. BAR. I LOVE THAT THIS IS PULLED UP TO THE SIDEWALK. I THINK WE NEED MORE OF THAT AROUND TOWN. I LOVE THAT THIS IS WORKING TO ACTIVATE THAT STRETCH. THANK YOU.
01:56:02.476: >> Chair Mills: GO AHEAD, COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:56:05.245: >> Commissioner Clarke: I HOPE IT'S OKAY IF I ASK FOR A LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION ON THE CIRCULATION ON HERE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF I'M UNDERSTANDING AND READING IT RIGHT, THAT WHEN -- IT TRAFFIC ENTERS ON SOUTH MAPLE, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CROSS ACROSS THE EXITING DRIVE THRU TRAFFIC. IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE THE PEOPLE EXITING THE DRIVE THRU IN ORDER TO EXIT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CROSS OVER THE ENTRYWAY TRAFFIC? DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? CAN YOU CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT ON THAT?
01:56:31.605: >> WE COULD -- IF YOU WANT, I MEAN, I COULD BRING UP MY SCREEN SHARE, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE IMAGE OF THAT. I MEAN, I KNOW THAT KIND OF BLOCKS OUT -- HOPEFULLY I HAVE BETTER LUCK THAN CHRIS CHENG ON THIS. I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING AND IT WORKS FIND EVERY OTHER TIME. AND SO IN THEORY IT SHOULD -- DID THAT WORK.
01:56:55.896: >> Chair Mills: WE SEE YOUR DESKTOP. YEP.
01:57:01.134: >> HEY, TAKE THAT, CHENG! OKAY. SO YES, REALLY THE TRAFFIC CIRCULATION, I GUESS OVERALL, YOUR MAIN CONCERN WAS I THINK REGARDING YOU HAD MENTIONED THROUGH THIS DRIVE THRU AND AS YOU CAN LOOK -- SO IN GENERAL, I WILL JUST REALLY QUICKLY, THIS IS ANOTHER -- YOU KNOW THE MAIN ACCESS DRIVE RIGHT HERE THAT GOES INTO THE WEST GATE, THAT'S EXISTING DRIVE NOW AND THE EXISTING CURB CUT INTO THE LEWIS JEWELER SITE IS RIGHT HERE. AND THEY ARE SHIFTING THAT OVER AND THEY STILL PAIN TAKEN AN ACCESS TO THE REAR THERE. SO THAT ACCESS IS THE SAME AS EXISTING. AND THEN SO RIGHT HERE IS THE MAIN POINT OF CONTENTION, I BELIEVE, WHICH IS YOU CAN SEE THE TWO-WAY TRAFFIC IS MAINTAINED HERE. BUT CORRECT, I MEAN, THIS IS HOW THE TRAFFIC WOULD ENTER HERE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY, YES, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CROSS THE TRAFFIC ENTERING THE SITE TO JUST GET TO THE EXIT TO LEAVE. SO I BELIEVE THAT WAS YOUR AREA -- IT'S KIND OF YOUR QUESTION, CORRECT? YOUR AREA, THERE THE CIRCULATION?
01:58:07.367: >> Commissioner Clarke: MY -- MY DAUGHTER LOVES GOING TO THE LIBRARY THERE AND WE ARE ALWAYS THERE IN NORMAL TIMES. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE AREA, THE CARS ARE GOING EVERY WHICH WAY TO CUT ACROSS AND THAT WAS MY ONLY QUESTION IS IF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN AROUND THE DRIVE THRU. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF DRIVE THRUS. I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT IT'S CLOSER TO THE CURB. I WONDER IT THE DRIVE THRU TO THE GATE WOULD BENEFIT THAT A LITTLE BIT AND THE GENERAL WALKING PATTERNS. IF PEOPLE ENTER IN ON SOUTH MAPLE AND ENTERING PEOPLE INTO THAT DYNAMIC WITH THE TRAFFIC, WE ARE ENTERING MORE CONFLICT POINTS THERE. THAT WAS MY ONLY CONCERN ON THAT.
01:58:43.637: >> THAT'S A GOOD POINT THAT THE TRAFFIC AND THAT CIRCULATION, THAT WAS THAT MAIN CONCERN THAT WAS IDENTIFIED FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER, REGARDING THAT -- THE CROSS -- THE EXITING TRAFFIC, AND THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT WEST GATE GENERATES, Y YOU KNOW, TO AND FM THAT. WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH WHY THAT DRIVE WANTED TO BE MAINTAINED AS TWO WAY. AND THE NEW ELEMENT TO THE TALK IS SOMETHING TO NOTE.
01:59:11.698: >> DO YOU WANT ME TO KEEP THE SCREEN UP FOR NOW OR I CAN STOP SHARING IF THERE'S ANOTHER COMMISSIONER QUESTION.
01:59:17.471: >> Chair Mills: I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. SO I WILL JUMP IN NOW AND I ALSO THINK THAT -- MR. KERR, I FEEL LIKE I SAW YOU RAISED YOUR HAND. IF YOU WANTED TO RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THAT. MY -- OR MAYBE I WILL ASK THE QUESTION AND THEN LET YOU RESPOND TO BOTH OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS TOGETHER. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY CARS BASED ON THE CUE RIGHT THERE FOR SHOWING THE DRIVE THRU, HOW BIG -- IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET A SENSE OF SCALE ABOUT HOW MANY CARS WITH FIT IN THERE, IF SOMEBODY IS AT THE WINDOW, AT THE BUILDING, HOW MANY, LIKE -- HOW MANY CARS BACK IS IT TO THAT ARROW THAT IS POINTED NORTHEAST?
02:00:00.147: >> I WOULD -- IF YOU CAN -- SORRY, I WILL LET MR. KERR ANSWER AS WELL. IF YOU CAN SEE ACROSS HERE, THESE ARE THE STANDARD PARKING SPACES, PARALLEL SPACES RIGHT BELOW THERE. SO USING THAT AS A GUESSTIMATE. DEPENDING ON WHERE THE WINDOW IS ON THE BUILDING AND THEN YOU HAVE A CONCERN WHERE A MENU BOARD OR ORDERING BOARD WOULD BE LOCATED ON THERE AS WELL. SO, I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE PROBABLY TWO CARS POSSIBLY. BUT I -- I -- MAYBE MR. KERR CAN ADD TO THAT RIGHT NOW.
02:00:33.113: >> THANKS, GUYS. SO, YEAH, WE WERE PLANNING THREE IN THE CUE THERE. SO THAT THERE WOULD BE THREE -- I KNOW THAT THERE'S CONCERN WITH THAT AND WE CAN LENGTHEN THAT DRIVE OUT TO MAKE IT LONGER. WE CAN PUSH IT FORWARD MORE FOR THE WINDOW AND ALLOW FOR MORE CARS. WE COULD PROBABLY ALLOW FOR FIVE CARS TO SIT IN THAT CUE. WHEN WE BRING IT BACK, WE CAN SHOW THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MENTION, MAT, YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT A -- AN EASEMENT OR A -- YOU KNOW, AN AGREEMENT THAT THE REST THE SHOPPING CENTER COULD USE THAT DRIVE WOULD. WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THAT. THERE'S NOT BEEN AN AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE IN OUR PAPERWORK THAT SHOWS THAT THAT PROPERTY HAS TO BE A TWO-WAY DRIVE. AND WE PROPOSED IT AS A ONE-WAY DRIVE, UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR TRAFFIC CIRCULATION, BUT TRAFFIC SAID, NO, WE WANT TO MAINTAIN IT AS TWO. SO WE WOULD PREFER IT WAS A ONE WAY, AND WE WOULD PREFER THAT IT'S NOT SET UP FOR THAT COLLISION IF YOU WILL. THAT'S MY ONLY COMMENT.
02:01:52.092: >> I COULD SAY JUST POLITELY RESPOND TO, THAT WE DID -- WHEN WE LOOKED THE ACTUAL -- WHEN WE GOT THE EASEMENT LANGUAGE, THAT'S STATED ON THE PAGE. IT SPECIFICALLY STATES FOR TWO-WAY INGRESS AND EGRESS ACCESS. BUT WE CAN -- I MEAN, WE CAN CERTAINLY SEND THAT BACK TO THE PETITIONER AND LET THEM -- AND NOT TO SAY THAT IT COULDN'T BE CHANGED EVENTUALLY, BUT THAT WAS WHAT OUR INTERPRETATION, AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION, IT SAYS MUST MAINTAIN ACCESS TO AND FROM THROUGH THERE. BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY SORT THROUGH THAT DETAIL. BUT I THINK EVEN -- AND HE IS CORRECT THAT THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED AS ONE WAY. THAT WAS A BIG -- THAT WAS A DEFINITIVE PUSH BACK FROM THE TRAFFIC ENGINEER THAT HE DID NOT WANT THAT CONVERTED TO ONE WAY, DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT GOES IN THROUGH THAT DRIVE TO WEST GATE, AND, AGAIN, THIS IS THE MAIN -- IF YOU LOOK UP AT THE TRAFFIC PATTERN THAT GOES UP ALONG WEST STADIUM AND KIND OF WHERE IT BRIDGES IN MAPLE AND WEST STADIUM, THERE THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN ACCESS DRIVES THAT ALLOWS LEFT TURN INTO THE SITE. THAT'S WHERE THE PETITIONER COMES BACK WITH A TWO-WAY DRIVE, AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW. THAT'S BEING REVIEWED.
02:03:14.240: >> Chair Mills: TO THAT END, LIKE, WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT, AND THE SAFETY OF THE DRIVE THROUGH, BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE THINK OF DRIVE THRUS, I -- I MEAN, I -- I'M NOT SURE -- IN MY MIND, THE ONE-WAY SEEMED SAFER, THE CUE ISSUED SEEMED LESSENED BY HAVING IT ONE WAY AND I DO THINK IT DOES GET CONFUSED, THE FIRST TIME I DROVE TO THAT KROGER, I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE ENTRANCE TO THE KROGER. I SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED THAT IT WAS NOT AND SO YOU MAKE THAT MISTAKE ONE TIME AND IF THERE'S A ONE-WAY SIGN, YOU REALIZE THAT. I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT CARS. I RECOGNIZE THIS IS A CAR-CENTRIC POTENTIALLY, LIKE, THERE ARE -- THIS IS VERY FREQUENTED. BUT THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE GROCERY STORES BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN THE CITY. AND LIKE COMMISSIONER CLARK, LIKE WE'RE OFTEN THERE IN NICE WEATHER AND NON-COVID TIME AND USUALLY ARRIVE BY BICYCLE. AND THAT'S THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO GET THERE. I CONFESS, I DON'T USUALLY TAKE THE BUS THERE, AND THE BUS STOPS ARE ACTUALLY SOUTH ON SOUTH MAPLE ARE SOUTH OF THIS SITE JUST A LITTLE BIT. AND SO WHAT I WORRY ABOUT FROM A PEDESTRIAN SAFETY POINT OF VIEW WITH THE DRIVE THRU IS THAT THAT IS WHERE FOOT TRAFFIC, GOING TO THE SHOPPING CENTER -- NOT KROGER, BUT FARTHER UP, THEY COULD BE USING THAT BECAUSE IT'S A STRAIGHT SHOT, RIGHT? THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WALK TO THE NORTH ENTER OF THE PROPERTY. I APPRECIATE HAVING THE SIDEWALK BY ALL MEANS, BUT WITHOUT HAVING A PEDESTRIAN ACCESS ALONG THAT SOUTH PART OF THE DRIVES WITH THOSE CARS COMING IN AND OUT, LIKE THAT IS MY SAFETY CONCERN. SO I WOULD LIKE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OR TO HAVE THAT LOOKED AT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO -- LIKE, WHAT THE PATHS OF TRAVEL ARE TO THE BUS STOPS. BECAUSE I OFTEN SEE PEOPLE WAITING FOR -- LIKE AT THE VARIOUS BUS STOPS AND I'M -- I DON'T ENTIRELY KNOWELF BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WALK TO THE NORTH OF THE PROPERTY LIKE IT THE SEEM -- SINCE THAT ONE IS CLOSER TO THE P BUS STOPS, I THK THEY WILL GO TO THE SOUTH. THAT'S MY CONCERN OVER THE DRIVE THRU AND THE SAFETY. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:05:57.137: >> CommissioneGibb-Randall: JUST ONE MORE THING TO BY ABOUT THE DRIVE THRU AND THAT IS EVEN IF IT'S A ONE WAY, IF IT EWES UP IN ANY KIND OF -- YOU KNOW, YOU THE INTERIOR PARKING LOT. BLOCK AND SO THE DRIVE THROU SEEMS REALLY TRICKING I TOUGH HERE TO ME. IT DOESN'T -- I MEA I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL HAVE TENAN YET OR NOT. WE HAD DRIVEHRUS AT BANK WHERE THEY HAVE A SPEFIC TENANT. THE W YOU MADE I SEEMED, IT I DON'TNOW IF IT'S ESSTIAL. I JU SEE THE DRIVE THRU HERE AS REAY PROBLEMATIC,O MATTE HOWOU SLICET, WTHER IS E WAY OR TWO WAY AND TWOAYS SEEMS RIDICULOU TO ME, LIKE E CROSSING OF THERAFFIC, KIND OF ON BOTH ES OF IT. IT SMS LIKE IT'S COMPLETY COUNTERINTTIVE. SO I'M -- LIKE COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, I'M FOR THE DEVELOPMENT BUT I THINK THE DRIVE THRU IS A PROBLEM. I WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME SUPPORTING IT WITH THE DRIVE THRU THE WAY THAT IT IS.
02:07:12.645: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:07:14.314: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THE EASEMENT LANGUAGE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STADIUM AND WEST GATE. THERE'S VERY SMALL SIGN. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO TURN LEFT INTO SOUTH MAPLE TO ENTER INTO THIS DRIVEWAY WHERE PEOPLE DO TURN LEFT INTO WEST GATE AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE TUCK AT JACKSON AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GO TO WEST GATE TO TURN AT THE LIGHT. IF THIS GOES ONE WAY, TO GO GET ONE LESS ENTRY POINT AND MORE CONFLICT UP AT THAT LIGHT. WHEN WE WILL HAVE MORE WEST GATE ENTRY GAP THERE. SO THINKING OF -- LIKE, RIGHT NOW IT'S THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG ABOUT A DRIVE THRU REQUIRING ONE WAY TO MAKE IT SAFER, BUT IN -- IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, GOING ONE WAY CREATES MORE T CONGESTION AND ISSUES AND RISK TAKING TO TURN LEFT UP AT THE OTHER WEST GAIT INTERESTRY TOO. -- WEST GATE ENTRY TOO. SO THE TRAFFIC THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING HAS TO WORK IN CONCERT. SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S PROBABLY AN EASEMENT HERE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO TURN AT THAT LIGHT, TO MANAGE THIS AS AN ENTRY POINT AS A RIGHT TURN. SO I DEFINITELY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT LANGUAGE WHEN THIS COMES BACK AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT A ONE-WAY TO MAKE A DRIVE THRU WORK TO THE DETRIMENT OF TRAFFIC FLOW FOR THIS OVERALL AREA SERVICING THE COMMUNITY. EVEN IF YOU CAN GO ONE-WAY, IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT TO DO IT FOR A DRIVE THRU, NOT BECAUSE IT'S BERING THE SITE. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT SPECIAL AASSESSMENT USE, WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL QUALITY OF IT. IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT AS TWO WAY, DRIVING IN TRAFFIC, EXITING THE DRIVE THROUGH AND ONEWAY, THINKING ABOUT THE OVERALL TRAFFIC FLOW IN THIS AREA. SO OVERALL, THE DRIVE THRU DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A FIT HERE. JUST MY FEEDBACK NOW. IT'S UP TO THE PETITIONER HOW THEY PRESENT IT MOVING FORWARD. BUT IT'S GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE HEADS UP RIGHT NOW. AND ONE LAST LITTLE THING. THERE'S TO SIDEWALK CONNECTION TO THE PATIOS OF THE SUITE THREE. SO WE HAVE THE SOUTH MAPLE SIDEWALK. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE JUST THE SIDEWALK GOING TO THAT PATIO. WRIRIGHT NOW YOU ARE EITHER WALG ON THE SIDEWALK OR THROUGH THE GRASS. IF YOU ARE TAKING THE SIDEWALK FROM THE BUS STOP TO THIS, I DON'T SEE A WAY FOR THEM TO NAVIGATE TO THE SUITES WITHOUT A SIDEWALK CONNECTION.
02:10:06.319: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE FEEDBACK? COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN?
02:10:12.558: >> MR. KOWALSKI, IT WOULD BE GREAT IN THE TRAFFIC ENGINEER CAN BE HERE FOR OUR NEXT -- FOR WHENEVER THIS COMES BACK TO US. SO IF YOU CAN PLEASE ASK CYNTHIA TO BE HERE, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
02:10:25.138: >> I APPRECIATE. AGAIN, WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IT FOR TONIGHT, BUT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH FEEDBACK TOLY GIVE AT THIS POINT. WE ARE -- TO REALLY GIVE AT THIS POINT. THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR HER TO GIVE. THAT'S A GREAT POINT. ONE FOLLOW-UP NOTE THAT WAS MENTIONED REGARDING THE SIDEWAL. I THINK THE PETITIONER CAN CHIME IN ON THIS. THERE'S A PRETTY GRADE CHANGE THERE. SO I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TO ADD STEPS. WE DID INQUIRE ABOUT THAT, WITH PLANNING STAFF TO ACCESS THAT AND I THINK THERE HAS TO BE STEPS IN THAT LOCATION, THE ARCHITECT OR --
02:11:02.275: >> IT'S NORTH. IT SHOULD MATCH.
02:11:13.786: >> WE CAN HAVE THAT ADVICE.
02:11:15.254: >> THIS IS. IS CANDICE STILL ON? MAYBE SHE CAN CHIME IN ON THAT CORNER.
02:11:20.993: >> YES, SO THE SITE GENTERRALLY SLOPES AS YOU GO ALONG MAPLE. SO WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THAT PEDESTRIAN CONNECTION AT THE NORTHEAST CORNER, BUT EVEN THAT'S PRETTY STEEP. IT'S ACTUALLY -- IT HAS RAILINGS ALL ALONG IT JUST TO MAKE IT ADA COMPLIANT. AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S STEPS ON THAT PATIO IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER KIND OF COMING OUT OF THE BUILDING TO GET TO THE PATIO FOR ACCESS. SO WE CAN LOOK AT IT AGAIN, BUT IF THERE IS ANY TYPE OF PEDESTRIAN CONNECTION FROM THAT PATIO, OUT ON TO THE PUBLIC WALK ALONG MAPLE, IT WOULDN'T BE ADA COMPLIANT. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS, IS IT BETTER TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH STEPS, TO HAVE A CONNECTION OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE ADA COMPLIANT? THAT'S, I GUESS, A QUESTION FOR THE CITY.
02:12:17.350: >> I'M SORRY, CANDACE, YOU ARE SAYING AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER, THIS -- WHERE THE HAND IS NOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT?
02:12:25.158: >> YES. YES. SO A CONNECTION FROM THAT PATIO DIRECTLY OUT TO THE SIDEWALK WOULD BE T TOO STEEP TO MAKE ADA REQUIREMENTS. AND I THINK THAT THE CITY GENERAL WANTS THEM ALL TO THE ADA COMPLIANT. WE CAN LOOK AT PUTTING STEPS THERE TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION, BUT THERE'S NOT A WAY WITH THE GRADES TO MAKE THIS -- JUST ASTANDARD SIDEWALK CONNECTION WORK RIGHT THERE.
02:12:58.324: >> IF THE COMMISSION WOULD PREFER STEPS, WE COULD -- AGAIN, WE COULD REQUEST THAT THEY INSTALL SOME STEPS AND THEY WOULD NOT BE ADA ACCESSIBLE.
02:13:12.338: >> Commissioner Sauve: I MEAN FOR ME, WHEN I BASICALLY TRY TO DRAW A LINE A PEDESTRIAN MOVING AROUND THIS SITE, ONCE YOU GET TO THE SOUTHEAST CORNER, YOU ARE GOING ALL THE WAY AROUND THE SITE TO THE INSIDE ENTRY OF THOSE SUITES OR YOU ARE CUTTING ACROSS THE GRASS. SO LIKE, MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN GET FROM A PUBLIC SIDEWALK ON TO THE SITE, WITHOUT WALKING IN A DRIVEWAY, I THINK IS THE IDEAL SCENARIO. IT'S HELPFUL WHEN THEY COME BACK AND DO A FULL PRESENTATION TO MAYBE TALK THROUGH THOSE SCENARIOS WOULD BE GREAT TOO.
02:13:46.272: >> Chair Mills: OR ELEVATIONS THAT KIND OF SHOW THAT, LIKE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. I MEAN, WHAT ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T REALIZE. THERE WAS SUCH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PATIO AND THE SIDEWALK AND IT MAKES ME WONDER THEN IF WHATEVER -- IP ME I MEAN IT'S NA RETAINING WALL, BUT WHATEVER IS UP THERE, WHAT THE SITE LINE IS FROM THAT SIDEWALK -- OR FROM THAT -- FROM THAT IN AND OUT, THE DRIVEWAY TO THE SIDEWALK, BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S, YOU KNOW -- THAT IS A SIDEWALK THAT GETS USED. SO -- I THINK TO THAT POINT, IT WOULD HELP ME NEXT TIME TO LOOK AT THAT. COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:14:31.284: >> Commissioner Abrons: TOWARDS THE SECOND TO LAST PAGE OF THE SITE PLAN, REVIEW SET THAT WE WERE GIVEN, SOME RENDERINGS THAT SHOW THAT ELEVATION ALONG MAPLE AND IF I'M READING IT CORRECTLY, I THINK THE -- THERE IS A RETAINING WALL, LIKE THE KIND ADJACENT TO THE SIDEWALK WITH THE PEDESTRIAN WOULD BE KIND OF WALKING ADJACENT TO A SMALL GRASSY BERM, A RETAINING WALL AND THEN THE BUILDING. BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS TO LOOK AT THAT. OH, THERE. OOPS.
02:15:04.684: >> IT'S PAGE 20.
02:15:05.351: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.
02:15:07.586: >> IT TAPERS OFF AND THAT'S WHERE I'M QUESTIONING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE PUSH AND PULL OF THE LANDSCAPE TO SLICE SOMETHING IN RIGHT AT THE END.
02:15:28.674: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER -- I SAW THAT, BUT I DIDN'T -- IT DIDN'T REGISTER TO ME BEING LIKE, WHERE THE DRIVEWAY WAS. SO I WILL GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT I NEED A 3D RENDERING KIND OF WHAT IS LOOKS LIKE FROM THE SIDEWALK, BUT I THINK THAT JUST SO -- I MEAN, IF YOU CAN'T PICK UP FROM THIS DISCUSSION, THE -- FOR THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, I THINK UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT ENTRANCE AND EXIT ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE WORKS, LIKE -- LIKE, THERE'S A LOT OF CONVINCING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN ABOUT THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, RIGHT THERE, ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. I THINK OVERALL, LIKE, THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS, I THINK THAT -- I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS BUILDING. I'M EXCITED TO SEE IT MOVED UP TO THE ROAD. I'M EXCITED THAT IT'S -- THAT IT'S THINKING ABOUT PARKING IN VARIOUS WAYS AND NOT, LIKE, TONS OF PARKING. IT'S NO THE LIKE A SEA OF PARKING, RIGHT. I LIKE THAT IT'S ON MULTIPLE SIDES. SO I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF GOOD HERE, BUT TO WHAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE SAID ABOUT, YOU KNOW, -- IF -- YOU KNOW, IF THE ONE WAY IS ONLY TO SOLVE THE DRIVE THRU, LIKE THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR. SO I THINK -- THAT'S CLEARLY, LIKE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE AREA THAT YOU WILL NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO, BUT LIKE, IF YOU CAME HERE, REALLY ELSE THAT ATHE AREA TO PAY ATTENTION TO IF YOU ARE COMING BACK. COMMISSIONER LEE.
02:17:01.033: >> Commissioner Lee: I THINK EVERYONE HAD GREAT POINTS. I WANTED TO ACTUALLY SAY, I REALLY LIKE THE LAYOUT OF THINGS. I LIKE HOW IT DOES PULL THE BUILDING TOWARDS THE ROAD. IT HELPS TO SLOW TRAFFIC DOWN OPEN SOUTH MAPLE WITH THE LANDSCAPE KIND OF BUFFER ON THAT SIDE. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY OVERALL FROM A MATERIALITY KIND OF WHAT THE ELEVATIONS LOOK LIKE, I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE WHAT IS PROPOSED HERE. I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT THE CORNER BISTRO USED TO BE. I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THE SUFFICIENCY OF THAT STACKING LANE. COULD YOU IMAGINE IT GOING ALL THE WAY BACK -- IN MY HEAD, I HAD TO THINK IN ABOUT HOW- YOU HAVE HAVE THE ROADHOUSE AND THE FUNKY ARCHITECTURE AND HOW IT FITS IN WITH THE NUMEROUS OUTLOTS THAT SIT THERE. I GUESS CHASE IS PRETTY STERILE, BUT I -- OVERALL, I THINK THAT THE DESIGN IS GREAT. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS INGRESS AND EGRESS ISSUE AND THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE STACKING LANE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY -- BUT OVERALL, THOUGH, I THINK YOU GUYS DOLL AGUYS WILL DO A PHENO. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT OVER WHAT AR BROWER DOES. I WANT TO SEE THE INGRESS AND EGRESS CONFLICT GET RESOLVED. I THINK THIS HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR QUITE SOMETIME. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS OBVIOUSLY TIME IS MONEY IN THE REAL ESTATE WORLD. SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE, YOU KNOW THAT GET ADDRESSED QUICKLY. THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR STAFF WOULD BE ON THE AUAL APPLICATION FORPECIAL EXCEPTIO USE,OES IAV TO GET REVED? SEV,HE RELATNSHIP OFHE PROPOSED USE, THEAIN TRAFFIC THOROUGHFARES AND ROAD INTERSECTIONS. IT DOES SAY THERE IT'S A ONE WAY EXIT THAT'S PROPOSED. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, DOES THAT HAVE TO GET REVISED AND RESUBMITTED.
02:19:03.889: >> YES, WE ARE WAITING FOR ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK HERE FROM THE COMMISSIONERS, BUT, YES, THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE, JUST TO UPDATE FOR WHAT THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, IF APPROVED WILL ACTUALLY GRANT. YES, THAT'S CORRECT. IT WILL BE UPDATED TO REFLECT. ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE FINAL LAYOUT MAY BE, IF THIS -- A ONE WAY OR TWO WAY, SO IF THEY NEED TO UPDATE IT. YES, THAT WILL BE UPDATED SO WHEN YOU GUYS VOTE ON IT, IT WILL BE PURSUANT TO THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE.
02:19:40.759: >> AND
02:19:43.495: >> Commissioner Lee: AND THEN ON THE LAST PAGE, PAGE 2, IS YOU HAVE A PHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS. DOES THAT USUALLY GET LIKE THE ANALYSIS, DOES THAT FIT INTO THE LARGER SITE AND IN THE CITY AS WELL? I SEE, YOU KNOW, IT'S QUITE DARK ON THE PERIPHERIES. JUST FOR MY EDIFICATION, IS THAT DONE WITH THE EXISTING LIGHTS THAT'S SURROUNDING IT OR IS THAT KIND OF INDEPENDENT? I LIKE HOW YOU ARE USING LED AND THE SPECS ON IT, BUT JUST A QUESTION IF THAT WAS CONSIDERED. FOR SAFETY OF LIKE WALKING ALL ALONG THE SITE.
02:20:16.462: >> I CAN ADDRESS PART OF THAT, ACTUALLY MAYBE AND THE PETITIONER CAN IF THEY CAN ADD SOMETHING BUT TYPICALLY THAT'S DONE A PER SITE BASIS. THEY ARE ONLY LOOKING AT THEIR ACTUAL SITE IS. YOU DON'T GET PHOTOMETRICS ON HOW OTHER SITES ARE. SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DO THIS IN A PIECEMEAL KIND OF WORK, IS THAT ONCE ONE SITE COMES IN THEIR EXISTING LIGHTING IS ALL BROUGHT UP TO CURRENT CITY CODES BUT WHAT IS SURROUNDING ON THE OTHER SITES. NO, WEST GATE IS -- THEY HAVE JUST REDONE SOME THINGS. THTHEY MAY BE CLOSER TO BEING IN COMPLIANCE. DOES THAT SITE STAND ALONE BY ITSELF. FOR THE LIGHTING STANDARDS.
02:21:03.909: >> Commissioner Lee: OVERALL, I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS COME TO REALITY. SO IT'S NOT A VACANT CORNER BISTRO. BEFORE I ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO POSTPONE FROM MY -- ONE OF MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS, I'M WONDERING FROM THE PETITIONER IF THERE IS A DATE IN THE FUTURE THAT -- THE PROPOSAL FROM PLANNING STAFF WAS FEBRUARY -- THE FIRST MEETING IN FEBRUARY. BASED ON WHAT YOU ARE HEARING, DO YOU THINK THAT'S REASONABLE OR -- YEAH.
02:21:37.876: >> I THINK WE WOULD PREFER TO COME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. TO KEEP THE PROJECT MOVING. IF THERE WAS A DATE BEFORE FEBRUARY, WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT, AND WE CAN MEET THE TIME FRAME. I THINK MATT -- I THINK THAT'S -- THAT'S -- WE ONLY HAVE A FEW THINGS TO TAKE CARE OF.
02:21:58.197: >> Chair Mills: AND MR. KOWALSKI, REMIND ME OF -- I FORGET THE PROS AND CONS OF HAVING A DATE CERTAIN VERSUS A DATE UNKNOWN FOR THIS.
02:22:06.872: >> WELL, ONE  OF THE -- SO THE FIRST MEETING OF JANUARY WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE. SO THE FIRST POSSIBILITY WOULD BE THE SECOND MEETING. THE PLANNING MANAGER HAD CONCERNS REGARDING THE AMOUNT ON THAT AGENDA. BUT ALSO, THIS COULD BE SCHEDULED, I MEAN, REALLY THE CONCERN REGARDING THE DATE SCHEDULE IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE -- DEPENDING ON WHAT THE FEEDBACK WAS TONIGHT, WHETHER THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAD GENERAL WAS -- WHAT THEY WOULD BE PUSHING FOR MORE OF A REDESIGN. WENT DON'T WANT TO DO IT TOO QUICK BECAUSE WE WILL BE BACK IN FRONT SAYING STAFF DIDN'T HAVE TIME BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE PETITIONER NEEDS TIME TO REFLECT YOUR COMMENTS HERE TONIGHT, BUT THEN AGAIN, WE NEED TIME TO KIND OF FOLLOW UP WITH THAT. AND IF THERE'S ANY MAJOR CONCERNS REGA REGARDING. IF THERE ARE'S REDESIGNS, IN THE DRIVE THRU LINE ADJUSTS. IF NECESSITY ADJUST ONE THING ON THE PLAN, THEN, YOU KNOW, ENGINEERING -- EVERYBODY HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT LONG LIST OF REVIEWS AGAIN. IN THEORY, THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT. WE WERE WAITING FOR THE TRANSPORTATION FEEDBACK ON THE PLAN. AGAIN, GIVEN WHAT WE HEAR -- WHAT THEY HEAR TONIGHT, WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO DO LARGER REVISIONS TO THE PLAN OR NOT, DEPENDS ON THAT -- THAT DEPENDS ON STAFF TIMING AFTER THAT. AND THEIR TIMING TO GET IT BACK TO US. AND I -- I KNOW THE PETITIONER WOULD LIKE IT CAN FORWARD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT WE DON'T WANT -- EVERYBODY KNOWS WE HAVE A HOLIDAY SEASON COMING IN HERE, AND UNFORTUNATELY ALSO REFLECTS REVIEWING TIMES FOR EVERYBODY. SO WE WERE TRYING TO BALANCE SOMETHING, WHERE I KNOW THE PETITIONER WANTS TO GET THIS ADDRESSES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH IT WHERE WE HAVE SOMETHING BACK BEFORE YOU THAT'S AN INCOMPLETE PLAN. SORE THAOR THAT WE HAVE TO REQUT POSTPONEMENT AGAIN.
02:24:02.020: >> Chair Mills: AND IF WE JUST POSTPONE WITHOUT -- WITHOUT MENTIONING A DATE, THEN -- AND THEN IT COMES BEFORE US WHEN IT'S READY?
02:24:10.429: >> YES, AND THEN WE COULD -- THAT'S ALSO -- AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE, AGAIN, WITH CONVERSATIONS, FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATIONS IN THE. IN COUPLE OF DAYS WITH THE PETITIONER, WE WILL HEAR BACK. IF THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MAJOR CHANGES, I EXPECT TO HAVE THE TRAFFIC REVIEW DONE ON THE PLAN, THAT -- WITH THE TWO-WAY DRIVE THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU HERE, HOPEFULLY REALLY SOON. AND IF THERE'S NO OTHER MAJOR CHANGES, THEN THAT COULD WORK OUT FINE. IF TH THERE'S OTHER MAJOR CHANGS REGARDING AISLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, THEN WE GET INTO THE RIPPLE EFFECT WHERE ENGINEERING MAY HAVE NO LOOK AT IT AGAIN AND LANDSCAPING AND SO FORTH.
02:24:46.031: >> Chair Mills: I'M WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION FROM A COMMISSIONER. UNLESS THERE'S MORE DISCUSSION BEFORE WE -- COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN?
02:24:55.841: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I MOVE TO POSTPONE TO FEBRUARY 5th.
02:25:05.050: >> Chair Mills: JUST A MINUTE. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, FEBRUAR-
02:25:10.889: >> TORNADO.
02:25:11.356: >> Chair Mills: YEAH, IT SHOULD
02:25:12.658: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SORRY , LOOKING AT THE WRONG YEAR.
02:25:20.399: >> Chair Mills: I WAS LIKE, WE DON'T MEET ON FRIDAY NIGHTS! COME ON!
02:25:24.569: >> Councilmember Disch: YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PUT US BACK IN 2020.
02:25:27.973: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: WE MIGHT AS WELL START HAVING MEETINGS ON FRIDAY NIGHTS. THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT HAPPENING.
02:25:33.278: >> Chair Mills: IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. A MOTION HAS BEEN MADE AND SECONDED. IS THERE ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE TO SECOND IT? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE FIRST MEETING OF FEBRUARY. IT SEEMS REALISTIC TO ME, PERSONALLY, LIKE -- AND IT GETS US ON OUR AGENDA SO WE DON'T HAVE RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF THINGS ON THE AGENDA TOO. IT'S -- IT'S ALSO FOR THE -- YOU KNOW, THE PETITIONERS' BENEFIT THAT WE ARE NOT HERE ALL NIGHT.
02:26:11.016: >> A COMMISSIONER -- HOW DO THE PETITIONERS FEEL ABOUT THAT DATE? I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU GUYS WHAT YOU THINK. WELL, FEBRUARY 2nd?
02:26:20.959: >> WELL, WE -- WE WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE IN JANUARY. BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHAT WE HEARD TONIGHT, I THINK WE HAVE -- I THINK WE CAN STAY WE HAVE A DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO GET APPROVAL FOR THE NEXT -- AND IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE A WHOLE CHANGE OF THE SITE PLAN TO DO THAT. SO IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO GET US IN JANUARY, IT WOULD BE GREAT. THAT -- THAT'S OUR FEELING.
02:26:51.189: >> Commissioner Lee: AND I GUESS THEN I WILL THROW OUT THE QUESTION TO COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, WHY FEBRUARY WOULD WORK BETTER -- IF THEY CAN MAKE MINOR CHANGES THAT WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE CONCERNS, IS THERE A PARTICULAR REASON THAT YOU WERE THINKING FEBRUARY? IF YOU COULD ELUCIDATE ON YOUR THINKING THERE.
02:27:13.945: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SURE IT WAS BASED ON WHAT MR. KOWALSKI WAS SAYING, IF THERE ARE MAJOR CHANGES TO THE PLANS, IT HAS NO GO THROUGH ALL THE CITY DEPARTMENTS. SO BEING THAT WE ARE ALSO NOW MIDDLE OF DECEMBER AND PRETTY MUCH THE REST OF DECEMBER IS SHOT BECAUSE OF THE HOLIDAYS, REALISTICALLY, YOU KNOW, WITH THE WAY THE CITY WORKS, I -- YOU KNOW, THE LAST THING WE WANT TO SEE IS, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME ARE EXPECTING US TO COME BACK ON FEBRUARY 2nd AND IT DOESN'T OR IF WE MOVE IT UP AND MAKE IT FEBRUARY -- OR JANUARY OR OUR SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY, THEN WE CAN'T MEET THAT DATE, YOU KNOW -- I THINK IT'S BETTER TO GIVE THE STAFF PLENTY OF TIME TO REVIEW THIS. AS WELL AS THE TRAFFIC ENGINEER TO REVIEW THIS, IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE COMING BACK WITH A DRIVE THRU.
02:28:01.626: >> Commissioner Lee: THANK YOU. I WILL DEFER TO YOUR GUYS' EXPERTISE. I'M NEW HERE. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE PETITIONERS IN MIND, YOU KNOW, TIME DOES MATTER QUITE A LOT. SO I JUST KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. SO I WILL YIELD. THANK YOU.
02:28:17.142: >> IF I MAY FOR A MOMENT?
02:28:19.711: >> Chair Mills: GO AHEAD, YES.
02:28:21.246: >> I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS THAT WE JUST NEED TO DELETE THE DRIVE THRU. THAT SNAKES ALL OF THESE CONCERNS PRETTY MUCH GO AWAY. AND DOING THAT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE THIS THING REVIEWABLE IN JANUARY AND BE READY FOR YOUR SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY, BECAUSE THE WHOLE TRAFFIC ENGINEER'S CONCERN IS THE DRIVE THRU. SO THERE IS NO DRIVE THRU, BASICALLY THERE IS NO CONCERN. AND THE CHANGE THAT CANDICE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT ARE VERY MINIMAL. HAD.
02:28:53.311: >> Commissioner Lee: I WOULD SAY -- SORRY.
02:28:55.380: >> Chair Mills: YES, PLEASE.
02:28:56.715: >> Commissioner Lee: I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T REALISTIC. IF THAT IS THE DIRECTION THAT THE PETITIONER WOULD WANT TO GO, I WOULD TEND TO AGREE. I HATE MAKING PROMISES ON CITY REVIEW TIMES BUT IT WOULD BE JUST A -- I MEAN, IF THEY ELSE THE DRIVE THRU, AGAIN, THAT DOES ELIMINATE THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF CHANGING PLANS. I MEAN, THEY COULD MORE OR LESS ELIMINATE THAT LANE AND PUT PARKING THERE OR GRASS THERE, AND THERE'S NO MORE REVIEW. SO THAT DOES CHANGE THE -- THE -- THAT CHANGES THE EQUATION TO -- TO COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN'S MOTION AND MY CONCERN, WHICH WAS EXPRESSED THAT WHAT MR. BROUWER DOES CHANGE ALL OF THAT. NOW, WHETHER OR NOT YOU GUYS -- IT'S ULTIMATELY UP TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, OF COURSE TO SET THAT DATE FOR POSTPONEMENT. BUT, YES, THAT DOES CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT STAFF WOULD PROBABLY NEED FOR REVIEW.
02:29:59.744: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER DISH.
02:30:00.645: >> Councilmember Disch: THAT SOUNDS REALLY REASONABLE. I THINK THE CONCERNS NEXT TO THE PARK -- NOT THAT THAT REQUIRES MAJOR ENGINEERING, BUT TO REMEMBER THAT AND THEN THERE IS THE DECISION ABOUT, YOU KNO WHETHER YOU INSTALL AN ESCALATOR SOUTHEAST CORNEIANT FORHE ANI AM KIDDING. (LAUTER).
02:30:24.669: >> I MAY, ONE OTHER THING, THE  THE TRASH AREA ISHE EXACT EA THAT IS BEE FOR ST GATE AND- OR FOR T COER BISTRO, THE MEXICAN RESTAURANT AND, THAT'S WHERE IT'S ALL BEEN. SO IT'S NOTHING NEW OR DIFFERENT TO ANY OF THE TENANTS AT WEST GATE, OTHER THANS ONE WOULD BE ACTUALLY A MUCH BETTER LOCATION THAN THEY HAVE NOW IN TERMS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EXISTING DUMPSTER SCREEN ON THE SITE.
02:31:01.973: >> WELL, IT IS REQUIRED TO GO BROUGHT UP TO CODE, THE ONE THAT WAS BROUGHT PREVIOUSLY, THIS ONE IS SCREENED PROPERLY TO GATES AND THINGS. BUT, YES, WE WILL PUT THAT AS A CONCERN THAT WILL BE NOTED AS WELL.
02:31:15.820: >> Chair Mills: I MIGHT CHIME IN THAT SINCE THE SPEED OF REVIEW DEPENDS LARGELY ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT DRIVE THRU IS THERE AND HOW MUCH ENGINEERING AND REVIEW THAT TAKES IF -- POTENTIALLY JUST LEAVING IT OPEN ENDED AND LETTING IT SEE HOW -- HOW QUICK IT GETS THROUGH THE PROCESS, DOESN'T SEEM IN MY MIND TO CAUSE ANY HARM AND SO IF IT -- IF THEY ARE ABLE TO -- WE WON'T -- I FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO BRING IT BEFORE US IF IT'S NOT READY. LIKE, HAVING THIS THREE TIMES JUST SEEMS SILLY. THAT'S NO GOOD FOR ANYONE. THAT IT GETS BROUGHT BEFORE US WHEN IT'S READY AND IF THAT'S QUICK BECAUSE THE CONTROVERSIAL THING HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS THEN GREAT. AND IF NOT, THEN AS QUICKLY AS IT CAN COME, I THINK WOULD BE MY INCLINATION, RATHER THAN TYING US TO A PARTICULAR DATE. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:32:25.757: >> Commissioner Sauve: I THINK WE STATE FOR TYPICAL PRACTICE TO PUT TO A DATE, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE COMMUNITY INPUT ANDLE VOLUME OFMENT -- AND INVOLVEMENT. I DON'T KNOW WHO IS WATCHING ON THE TV OR STREAMING OR WHAT DAMON STOUDAMIRE NOT. -- WHATNOT. I MEAN THERE COULD BE 40 PEOPLE FIGURING OUT THE OUTCOME, BUT SINCE NOBODY CALLED IN FOR PUBLIC INPUT, AND WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY LETTERS, I FEEL -- I FEEL COMFORTABLE AND I WILL LEAVE THIS TO COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN'S PROPOSAL, SINCE THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH, I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED WITH AN OPEN-ENDED DATE FROM MY SIDE FOR THAT REASON. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
02:33:12.270: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: COMMI SSIONER SAUVE, THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE WATCHING US ON YOUTUBE RIGHT NOW.
02:33:22.213: >> Commissioner Sauve: NOT A MULTIPLIER OF TEN.
02:33:27.218: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:33:28.686: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: DOES IT NEED TO BE RENOTICED. IS THERE ANY ISSUE WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE WOULD NEED -- LIKE, WOULD THAT POTENTIALLY DELAY IT EVEN FURTHER IN THE PETITIONER PUTS EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND THEN THEY ARE READY BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO RENOTICE?
02:33:42.700: >> NO. SO THERE IS A TIME LIMIT WITH THE RENOTICE. IT MIGHT BE MONTHS. IT'S LIKE SIX MONTHS. WE WILL NOT GET TO THAT POINT. WE WILL NOT NEED TO RENOTICE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING HERE TONIGHT. IT'S ONE OF THOSE ITEMS THAT AGAIN PLANNING COMMISSION COULD OPEN UP ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEARING AND CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING. IT -- BUT THAT -- IT -- ALL THE ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED TONIGHT. I MEAN, THERE'S NO PUBLIC HEARING. YOU WOULD NOT NEED TO -- IT WOULD NOT BE RENOTICED. WE WOULD NOT NEED TO RENOTICE IT.
02:34:12.397: >> Chair Mills: IF WE DON'T HAVE A DATE.%
02:34:14.265: >> EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE A DATE, UNLESS WE ARE TALKING -- IF IT'S SIX MONTHS DOWN THE LINE, THEN, YES, BUT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND OF TIME PWE ARE. YOU KNOW, MAYBE A MONTH HERE. SO YEAH. NO, THAT -- BUT THAT IS ALWAYS A CONCERN RIGHT, AGAIN, BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON STAFF -- THE SCHEDULING JUST BASED ON THE LIMITS OF PUBLIC NOTICES. THAT'S WHY I SAY THE SECOND -- WELL, WE WOULDN'T NOTICE IT EITHER WAY. I WILL STOP TALKING. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO, THERE'S NO CONCERN.
02:34:52.170: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT ABOUT THE DUMPSTERS NEXT TO THE PARK. I HAVE JUST DON'T THINK -- IT FEELS ALMOST LIKE A NUISANCE TO HAVE A DUMPSTER WITH SMELL NEXT TO SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE BASICALLY SAYING IS LIKE A PUBLIC GOOD, A PUBLIC SPACE. I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD NECESSARILY USE THE SPACE IF IT'S NEXT TO A DUMPSTER. IT'S NOT REALLY THE VISUAL THING FOR ME. IT'S MORE LIKE FROM THE ADJACENT PROPERTY, IT'S MORE JUST THE FACT THAT YOU ARE LOCATING A DUMPSTER NEXT TO A PUBLIC SPACE.
02:35:24.936: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL WHICH IS TO POSTOWN UNTIL THE 2nd -- POSTPONE UNTIL THE SECOND OF FEBRUARY? 2/2/21. MR. KOWALSKI, LET'S DO A ROLL CALL VOTE TO POSTPONE.
02:35:48.693: >> AGAIN THIS IS TO THE FEBRUAR.
02:35:51.062: >> Chair Mills: I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY MOTION TO AMEND THAT. OF.
02:35:56.501: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I MAKE A MOTION TO AMEND THAT.
02:35:58.970: >> Chair Mills: I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEEN MOVED AND THE MOVER HAS NOT CHANGED THAT. I THINK WE NEED TO VOTE IT UP OR DOWN AND THEN THERE CAN BE ANOTHERROPOSAL IF IT IS UNSUCCESSFUL TO A DIFFERENT DATE. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
02:36:17.622: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SINCE I MOVED, IT I WOULD BE OPEN TO WHATEVER COMMISSIONER ABRONS HAS TO -- TO -- POTENTIALLY TO A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT, DEPENDING ON WHAT IT IS.
02:36:27.732: >> Commissioner Abrons:  A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO POSTPONE
02:36:32.337: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SOUND S GOOD.
02:36:36.307: >> Chair Mills: AND IT SOUNDS LIKE COMMISSIONER SAUVE WAS OKAY WITH THAT. GREAT. NOW WE ARE MOVING TO POSTPONE TO A DATE UNCERTAIN, WHENEVER YOU CAN GET BACK TO US REASONABLY. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, DISCUSSION OF THIS. YOU ARE MUTED STILL.
02:36:51.322: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WITHIN REASON, IN TERMS OF OUR AGENDA AS WELL, BECAUSE NONE OF US WANTS TO STAY UP UNTIL 1:00 TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU ON THE FIRST JANUARY MEETING. I KNOW TIME IS MONEY BUT IT ALSO IS, YOU KNOW, DIFFICULT FOR US IF WE ARE UP PAST MIDNIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE SIX AGENDA ITEMS THAT ARE ALL BIG AND BEEFY TOO. AND SO I WANT TO PUT IN WE HAVE LIMITS ALSO IN TERMS OF THAT THE AND, YOU KNOW IF THEY CAN GET IT IN, YOU KNOW, AND IT'S THE SECOND MEETING IF FEBRUARY, AND WE CAN STAY WITHIN REASOBLE HOURS, THAT'S FINE WITH ME BUT I DON'T WANT TO STAY UP PAST MIDNIGHT DOING IT JUST TO GET IT INTO JANUARY. I WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE TABLE. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR -- YOU HAD INTIMATED MR. KOWALSKI THAT ONE OF THE THOSE MEETINGS WAS REALLY FULL. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE. THE FIRST ONE?
02:37:40.371: >> THE FIRST ONE.
02:37:42.306: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IF THERE'S ROOM FOR THE SECOND ONE, THAT'S GREAT. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A HUGE PILE ON.
02:37:47.478: >> AND I APPRECIATE THAT. ULTIMATELY, IT'S UP TO THE PLANNING COMMISSIONER. HIS CALL, WHETHER -- AND I'M NOT ENTIRELY AWARE WHAT IS FOR THE 15th, BUT, AGAIN, WE HAVE THIS. WE WANT TO GET IT ADDRESSED. WE DON'T LIKE THINGS HANGING AROUND ANY LONGER THAN WE HAVE TO BUT, AGAIN, WE KNOW THAT YOU GUYS HAVE CONCERNS, AND THE PETITIONERS HAVE CONCERNS AND STAFFING AND WE WILL DO IT OUR BEST TO GET IT ON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
02:38:11.002: >> Chair Mills: LET'S VOTE ON IT. I THINK BASED ON THE DISCUSSION, I THINK WE CAN DO A VOICE VOTE, IF THAT'S OKAY ON THE POSTPONEMENT. ALTHOUGH, IF WE POSTPONE -- ACTUALLY, LET'S DO ROLL CALL BECAUSE IF WE POSTPONE IT, THEN WE ARE DON'T DISCUSSING IT. GO AHEAD WITH THE ROLL CALL VOTE TO THE POSTPONEMENT OF A DATE UNCERTAIN TO HEAR THIS.
02:38:34.726: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
02:38:40.798: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
02:38:43.634: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
02:38:44.235: >> Commissioner Lee: YES.
02:38:44.802: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
02:38:50.575: >> Chair Mills: YES.
02:38:51.042: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
02:38:57.815: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
02:38:58.983: >> Commissioner Clarke: YES.
02:38:59.584: >> OKAY. THE ITEM IS POSTPONED TO AN UNCERTAIN DATE, BUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
02:39:05.590: >> Chair Mills: WE'LL SEE YOU THEN BUT IT WILL BE IN THE NEW YEAR. HAPPY NEW YEAR.
02:39:09.060: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:39:10.061: >> THANK YOU.
02:39:13.898: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT! WE ARE DONE WITH THE NEW BUSINESS AND ON TO OTHER BUSINESS. THESE TWO ITEMS WON'T HAVE PUBLIC HEARINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATIONS TO COUNCIL. SO THE FIRST ITEM 10A IS AN UPDATE OF RESPONSE TO CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION R20-260, WHICH SHH 9 SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLDS. MR. KOWALSKI, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US?
02:39:41.626: >> NOT REALLY. I MEAN, I'M HERE FOR -- I CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS, BUT REALLY AS CHAIR MILLS INDICATED, THEY ARE UPDATE MEMOS, THEY ARE MEANT TO COMMUNICATE THE STATUS TO -- THE REQ REQUIREMENT OF WHT WILL BE REPORTED BACK TO COUNCIL AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY COMMENTS AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME INTENDED. EFFECT. YEAH. THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAVE. BUT, AGAIN, I CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS. MAY I NOT HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS BUT I CAN CERTAINLY TAKE NOTES AND GET A MESSAGE BACK TO YOU.
02:40:28.272: >> Chair Mills: THIS WAS THE COMMUNICATION SHARED WITH US TWO WEEKS AGO, MR. LENART DURING HIS STAFF COMMUNICATION GAVE US A DRAFT OF THAT WE RECEIVED TWO WEEKS AGO AND THAT'S SITE PLAN THRESHOLD. I WILL READ THE MOTION AND I SAW COMMISSIONER DISCH AND THEN WE WILL BE IN DISCUSSION. THE MOTION IS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THE FOLLOWING UPDATE TO CITY COUNCIL ON RESOLUTION R20-260 AND SUMMARIZES PLANNING COMMISSION'S INTENT FOR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. AND THEN IT'S ATTACHED TO THE DOCUMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER DISCH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO START?
02:41:15.219: >> Councilmember Disch: JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS. WOULD THE -- SO THE IDEA OF ADOPTING AN FAR THRESHOLD, WOULD THAT -- WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO -- THIS -- I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS IN RELATION TO THE WORK SESSION THAT WE HAD ADUs. THAT THAT THRESHOLD WOULD BELE GENEROUS ENOUGH THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO AN ADU WITHOUT NEEDING A FULL-BLOWN SITE PLAN? AND THINK I THIS SOME PEOPLE MAY SEE THAT AS A GOOD THING AND SOME MAY SEE IT AS A B. I'M ASKING TO CLARIFY THAT. THE ONE OTHER THING IS I WOULD HAVE ASKED THIS EARER IN THE DAY INRIVATE AND I'M JUST GOG TO GO AAD AND SAY THAT I CODN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND FROM TH WAY IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE TWO ADONARTS WRE I SPOKE ABOUT PLANNGF COMMISSN APPRAL OF BUY RIGHT SE PLANS ANDY ASSUMPTN IS I THINK I'M INTERPTING THIS RIGHT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAN FROMHE PRIOUS DRAFTS WE HAV PRESENTED, TT THEDEAHERE IS THA THEREOULD BE --HAT 'RE TALNG ABOUT ROMMENDING SOME PROCTS TT WLD OY HA TO CLEAR PLANNING COMMISSION IF THEY ARE BY RIGHT, AND NOT HAVE TO GO ON TO COUNCIL. THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN, IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING, BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE NOT EVEN GO TO PLANNING COMMISSION, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THE INTENT WAS. I THINK THE PLANNING COMMISSION MAKES DECISIONS ON CERTAIN BY RIGHT SITE PROPOSALS AND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. SO THOSE ARE MY TWO QUESTIONS.
02:43:01.492: >> OKAY. SECOND QUESTION FIRST. THAT IS CORRECT. I MEAN, YES, YOUR INTERPRETATION -- IT WAS MEANT FOR PLANNING COMMISSION AND NOT -- BUT WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR. THE FIRST QUESTION REGARDING THE ADUs, THE THRESHOLD, SO YOUR QUESTION WAS REALLY, DOES THIS REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT -- THE THRESHOLD FOR AN ADU FOR A FULL SITE PLAN?
02:43:29.520: >> Councilmember Disch: WELL, OKAY -- SO I GOOD HEAR -- I'M SORRY IF I WASN'T CLEAR. THE IDEA HERE, IT LOOKED LIKE TO EXPAND THE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE EXEMPT AND ONE APPROACH TO DOING THAT WOULD BE TO SET A THRESHOLD OF FAR, BELOW WHICH YOU WOULDN'T NEED A SITE PLAN. RIGHT? AND SO I'M JUST ASKING, WOULD THAT THRESHOLD BE GENEROUS ENOUGH THAT AN ADU COULD CONCEIVABLY FIT UNDER IT? AM I MAKING SENSE?
02:44:04.855: >> YES, I THINK SO. AND I WILL ADD MAYBE ADDITIONAL COMMISSIONERS TOO. SO THE A ADUs, THAT'S FOR THE RED DENTIAL AREAS. SO FOR LIKE THE SINGLE FAMILY AND TWO FAMILY. SO THESE CHANGES THAT ARE BEFORE YOU HERE DON'T CHANGE THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE SINGLE FAMILY AND THERE'S THE SEPARATE SET OF ADU REVISIONS THAT WILL BE GOING FORWARD. SO WHAT THESE WOULD BE, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THESE ARE DEALING WITH THE THREE FAMILIES AND ABOVE. SO THEY DON'T REQUIRE SITE PLANS AT ANY TIME. SO THE ADUs HAVE A PROCESS THAT THEY GO THROUGH, WHICH IS ONE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CONDENSE OVER YEARS, BUT IT'S NOT THE TIME AS SITE PLAN THRESHOLDS. IT'S A DIFFERENT PROCESS. SO THIS ITSELF WOULD NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE AD Us IN AINGE OR TWO FAMILY -- IN SINGLE OR TWO FAMILIES. THERE'S ANOTHER AVENUE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AS THE ADU REVISIONS BUT THAT'S SEPARATE FROM THIS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? AND COMMISSIONERS IN I MISSED ANYTHING ON THAT, PLEASE, LET ME KNOW. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
02:45:29.440: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER FEEDBACK OR EDITS TO THE DOCUMENT BEFORE WE VOTE ON EFFECTIVELY ADVANCING IT AS WRITTEN TO CITY COUNCIL? I WILL JUST SAY THAT I THINK IT REFLECTS WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED, AND I THINK ALSO IMPORTANTLY, IT ENCOURAGES US TO EVALUATE AND CONSIDER THINGS, KNOWING THAT THIS FIRST STEP. WE'RE GIVING OURSELVES A WHOLE LOT MORE WORK BY FORWARDING IT BUT I THINK IT'S OUR OPPORTUNITY TO ASK COUNCIL TO WEIGH IN AND IF THERE ARE THINGS -- THE COUNCIL EFFECTIVELY THAT TASKED US WITH US IS NOT THE COUNCIL THAT'S BEFORE US NOW. AND SO COMMISSIONER DISCH, SINCE YOU WILL BE ON THAT BODY THAT RECEIVES, IT YOU ARE FORWARDING IT -- YOU ARE FORWARDING IT TO YOURSELF EFFECTIVELY, BUT I HOPE GOING FORWARD, IF THERE ARE THINGS ON HERE THAT ARE HIGHER PRIORITIES IN YOUR MINDS OR THINGS THAT AREN'T PRIORITIES, THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD FEEDBACK FOR US, BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR WORK FLAN I PLAN IS QUITE FULL. AND THE TWO THINGS ENUMERATED AT THE END WERE NOT WITHIN OUR AGREEMENT BUT WHAT WE HEARD A LOT AS OPPORTUNITIES. SO THAT -- I'M HAPPY THAT THEY ARE IN THERE, BUT ALSO KNOWING WHERE THE -- THE COUNCIL FEELS WE MIGHT FOCUS OR EFFORTS INITIALLY WOULD BE HELPFUL. I THINK WE CAN TAKE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS MR. KOWALSKI.
02:47:14.912: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
02:47:19.416: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
02:47:22.519: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
02:47:23.354: >> Commissioner Lee: YES.
02:47:23.921: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
02:47:28.492: >> Chair Mills: YES.
02:47:28.959: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
02:47:38.002: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
02:47:42.306: >> Commissioner Clarke: YES.
02:47:44.375: >> Chair Mills: THUMBS UP ALSO WORKS, COMMISSIONER CLARKE. SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO DO THAT. ALL RIGHT. ITEM 10B, WE'RE GETTING LOTS OF COMMUNICATIONS OFF TO COUNCIL. THIS IS THE C1A, C1A/R ZONING DISTRICT ANALYSIS AND RESPONSE TO THE CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION. SATELLITE THERE A PRESENTATION OR ANYTHING ON THIS ONE?
02:48:11.402: >> NO. I HAVE THE SAME REPORT. JUST THE MEMO BEFORE YOU TONIGHT. I DON'T HAVE A REPORT TO GIVE OTHER THAN THAT, AND, AGAIN, I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS.
02:48:29.053: >> Chair Mills: AGAIN, THERE'S NOT A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS. I WILL READ THE MOTION, THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION FORWARDS THE FOLLOWING IN RESPONSE TO R20-267 AND SUMMARIZES PLANNING COMMISSION INTENT FOR PROPOSED ZONING ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND SAUVE. YOU GUYS ARE FAST TONIGHT! DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:48:56.680: >> Councilmember Disch: AGAIN, A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO ASK OF YOU EARLIER IN THE DAY NORMALLY SO I DIDN'T WASTE TIME, BUT -- SO I WONDERED WHAT WAS BEHIND THE REMOVAL OF PREMIUM ELIGIBILITY AND WAS THAT ACTUALLY IN ORDER TO SET A HEIGHT CAP? I KNOW SOMETIMES PREMIERS MEANS THAT YOU GOOD ETHEL POTTS TO GO- YOU GET TO GO HIGHER THAN NORMAL. I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. AND THEN JUST BASED ON THE -- SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE ARE GETTING, I FEEL I SENSE THAT THERE WILL BE CONCERN RAISED THAT ANY PORTION OF THE SITE, WITHIN 300 FEET OF A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT COULD GO AS HIGH AS 10 STORIES. I SENSE THAT THERE WOULD BE CONCERN ABOUT THAT. THERE WILL BE CONCERN THAT WE KEEP THESE AS LIVE ZONING DESIGNATIONS ANYWAY, AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE QUESTION AS FAR AS WHETHER THESE WON'T BE SUBPLANTED BY T1, WHEN WE FINISH T1. THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION MAY BE MOOT. I WANTED TO RAISE FIRST THING, JUST AS A QUESTION I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, WHICH I WOULD HAVE ASKED YOU DURING THE DAY IF I HAD DONE THAT. AND THE LAST ONE JUST TO VOICE THE CONCERN THAT I'M HEARING FROM CONSTITUENTS ABOUT HEIGHT.
02:50:35.512: >> SO THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU HE IS REMOVAL OF THE CR GREEN ELEMENTS?
02:50:42.686: >> Councilmember Disch: NO PREMIUM ELIGIBILITY.
02:50:45.522: >> PREMIUM.
02:50:45.856: >> Councilmember Disch: I WONDERED IF THAT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRICT HEIGHT BECAUSE WHEN WE -- WHEN WE -- WHEN A DEVELOPER SAYS I WILL DO X NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WE GO, YOU CAN GO  GO X NUMBER OF FLOORS. SOME OF THE CRITICISM WE ARE GETTING OF THESE ZONING DISTRICTS IS UNLIKE PUDs, ONCE WE OFFER DENSITY BY RIGHT, WE CAN'T EXTRACT CONCESSIONS LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AM I PUTTING THAT CLEARLY OR --
02:51:26.096: >> YES. UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER. I WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH THIS, THE DEVELOPING OF THIS, THE MEMO AND THE STUDY BEHIND IT. IF OTHER COMMISSIONERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS -- I DON'T HAVE ANSWER ANSWER FOR YOU COMMISSIONER DISCH BUT I CAN GET -- WE WILL HAVE AN ANSWER BEFORE AND WE CAN REPORT THAT BACK YOU TO REGARDING WHY THE PREMIUMS AND THAT REMOVAL. I DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. I WASN'T THE MAIN STAFF MEMBER WORKING ON. THIS I APOLOGIZE. I DON'T KNOW IF OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD REGARDING THAT. I WILL BE ABLE TO GET A COMMUNICATION BACK TO YOU THAT HAS THE ANSWER. BA US IT'S A GOOD QUESTION REGARDING THE PREMIUMS.
02:52:07.938: >> Chair Mills: MY SENSE, COMMISSIONER DISCH, HAVING BEEN ON ORC. -- IT CAME BEFORE US AS A WHOLE BEFORE YOU WERE ON COMMISSION. SO WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AT A WORKING SESSION. ULTIMATELY,  WE DIDN'T H TONS OF DISCUSSION ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE -- WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD GIVE A QUICK RESPONSE. WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY SEE THIS AS SO BROKEN AND I THINK THAT'S REFLECTED IN HERE THAT THERE MAY BE AN ELEMENT LIKE THIS TYPOLOGY IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ENTIRELY THROW OUT. BUT THE DISCUSSIONS OF THE PREMIUMS -- WITH THE PREMIUM DOESN'T ALWAYS COME ADDIT HEIGHTS BUT IN SOME DISTRICTS THERE'S NOT A LIMITATION AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THERE'S NOT AIL  A HEIGHT LIMITN THE D2. AND PUTTING THEM TOGETHER IS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PROTECTION IS MY RECOLLECTION TO ALL OF THAT. TO YOUR SECOND POINT, I THINK ACTUALLY THE LAST TWO BULLETS IN MY MIND GO TOGETHER. THE ONE HELPS TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT CLEARER THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE 100 FEET TALL AND YOU ARE ADJACENT TO A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT. IF YOU ARE ADJACENT TO A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, YOU NOW HAVE TO HAVE -- BASED ON THE MULTIPLIER THAT'S IN THE WILL SECOND TO LAST BULLET, YOU HAVE TO BE 1 FEET SET BACK FROM THE SO EVEN IF YOU ARE RIGHT NEXT DORR, IN ORDER TO BE THAT HIGH, LIKE FOR EVERY FOOT OVER 30 FEET, YOU HAVE TO MOVE BACK. SOAYBE IT'S 70 FEET IF I DID THE MATH A LITE BIT OFF. BUT THIS I PROVING AN ADDITIAL LAYERF PROTECTION OVER TT. AND, AGA, THEDEA TS I BORROWINFROM WHAT WE HAVE IN OTR NEIGHRING DTRICTS. WE ARE NOT RECREATIN THE WHEEL RE BUT ALS THAT WE KNOW THIS THIS CONCERNVER UNLIMITED IGHT, IT'SOT OFT USEDND SEE REDOANI REZONING TO ONE OF E CLASS IFICATIONS HAVE VOLUNTEERD THE RIGHT AND THAT'S MY RECOLLECTION OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. I'M SEEING SOME NODS FROM COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, BUT COMMISSIONER SAUVE IS ALSO ON THE ORC AND SHE CAN ADD WHERE I AM OFF.
02:54:46.063: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES, THE PREMIUMS WAS TO REMOVE IT FROM THIS, IT ONLY APPLIES TO D1, D2, WHICH IS A CLEARER BOUNDARY, WHERE THE BOUNDARY OF THIS IS DESIGNATED FOLLOWING THE CAMPUS AREA. SO WHAT IT DID WAS FOR ANY NEIGHBORING ESPECIALLY RESIDENTIAL, ANY RESIDENT THAT COULD BE NEXT TO THIS ZONING DESIGNATION, THEY KNOW THE DENSITY THAT WILL HAPPEN ON THAT SITE. THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY TO GO DENSER OR HIGHER THAN THOSE TWO LIMITS. I THINK THAT WAS IT TOO. INCREASING FAR, YOU ARE SEEING A LOT MORE ON THAT SITE BUT PREMIUMS ARE BY RIGHT. SO YOU DO THIS, AND DO YOU THAT. SO THAT'S WHY IT WAS ELIMINATE IT BECAUSE IT'S ALSO UNCERTAINTY. I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I WOULD ADD ABOUT THE PREMIUMS.
02:56:02.405: >> Commissioner Abrons:  HE WANTED TO GET CLARITY ON THE PROCESS. WE ARE VOTING ON A MEMO WHICH IS AN UPDATE TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND IN A WAY WE ARE NOT COMMITTING TO ANYTHING. WE HAVE A LIST OF THINGS THAT WE ARE -- WE SAID WE MIGHT CONSIDER, BUT WE ARE NOT KIND OF LOCKED INTO ANYTHING. THE REASON I'M ASKING -- I WILL SAY THIS TO YOU, IS THERE ARE LIKE DETAILS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS, BUT BASED ON COMMUNICATION WE RECEIVED, THE -- YOU KNOW, THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO CALLED IN TO US, BUT MY SENSE IS THAT TONIGHT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOMENT TO HASH THAT OUT BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE ARE ESSENTIALLY AGREEING TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER IN THE COMING YEAR, BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME JUST AFFIRMATION OR CONFIRMATION, I GUESS, OF THAT.
02:56:46.817: >> YES, I THINK FROM STAFF'S POINT OF VIEW, THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT. IT'S JUST MEANT TO BE AN UPDATE MEMO. THIS IS WHAT PLANNING COMMISSION, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON -- THESE ARE SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE WANT TO EXPLORE BUT IT'S BY NO MEANS -- (INAUDIBLE) -- IT'S JUST REALLY SAYING THIS IS KIND OF WHAT WE HAVE COME UP WITH OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT. THIS THIS IS OUR UPDATE AND THIS IS VARIOUS AREAS THAT WE WILL EXPLORE. WE ARE NOT COMMITTING YOU OR ANY PLANNING COMMISSIONER TO ANYTHING REALLY.
02:57:26.356: >> Commissioner Abrons:  MAYBE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, I SUPPORT KIND OF JUST VOTING FOR THE MEMO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE BRING IT UP FOR DISCUSSION NEXT YEAR, WE DO TAKE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH THE POINTS THAT ARE BEING RAISED IN THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE'RE RECEIVING AND KIND OF ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS, WHICH ARE LIKE HEIGHT RELATIVE TO D2 OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WE ARE TALKING AND HASHING THAT OUT RIGHT NOW, I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL. AND HOW TO -- WHAT WE THINK THE APPROPRIATE CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION WOULD BE AND WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER SOMETHING QUALIFIES AS -- IN A REZONING PETITION. SO I DON'T WANT TO KIND OF HOLD US UP TONIGHT. I DON'T THINK IT'S PRO ENTER FOR TONIGHT, BUT I DO WANT -- IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR TONIGHT, BUT I WHAT. TO GO ON RECORD BY SAYING, I 40 HOPE WE HAVE TIME TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WHEN WE DO TALK ABOUT THESE IN THE FUTURE.
02:58:27.784: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. SORRY, MR. KOWALSKI, I CUT YOU OFF, THOUGH. DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO --
02:58:37.460: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: COMMI SSIONER ABRONS, SO PART OF THE REASON WHY I THINK IT'S GOOD TO SEND MEMOS BACK, VERSUS US TAKING THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS TO COME ONE THIS PLAN IS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN CITY COUNCIL. AND SO WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS WORK ON SOMETHING FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS AND FIND OUT THAT CITY COUNCIL VOTED THINGS DOWN BECAUSE THINGS CHANGED. SO BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, AT OUR LAST MEETING WE TALKED ABOUT ADUs. WE WORKED FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS ON ADUs. BY THE TIME IT GOT TO CITY COUNCIL, THEY VOTED THIS DOWN AND WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WHEN PERSONALLY, I L LIKED THE IDEASF SENDING MOMENT MOWS SO WE CAN GET FEEDBACK FROM COUNCIL. SO WE CAN BE PRODUCTIVE RATHER THAN WASTING OUR TIME, MORE OR LESS. YES, IF COUNCIL IS STILL ON BOARD WITH ALL OF THIS AND COMMISSIONER DISCH, I HOPE THAT YOU WILL GET US FEEDBACK WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO, SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON SO WE ARE NOT SPENDING TIME HAVING A CONVERSATION THAT WON'T GO ANYWHERE. JUST BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE MORE PRESSING ITEMS ON OUR TO-DO LIST RIGHT NOW THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO VERSUS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO GO NOWHERE.
03:00:03.146: >> Commissioner Abrons:  MAY I RESPOND. IS THERE SOMETHING IN THE MEMO THAT WE NEED TO SAY, WHERE WE REQUEST FEEDBACK OR IS THAT ALREADY WRITTEN INTO THE MECHANISM. THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THAT FORMALLY SAYS THAT.
03:00:17.494: >> NO, THERE ISN'T BUT WE WILL GET FEEDBACK FROM COMMISSIONERS, BRETT WILL. WE WILL HAVE FEEDBACK FROM THE COUNCIL ON IT.
03:00:25.068: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THAT SOUNDS GREAT. THANK YOU.
03:00:32.108: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
03:00:34.711: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: BY NO MEANS DO I SAY THAT WE ARE WASTING TIME. BUT I WANT TO PRIORITIZE WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT, AND THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS THAT COUNCIL --
03:00:49.459: >> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. THE WORK PROGRAM IS LONG. THESE TYPE OF MEMOS PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF TOUCH BASE WITH COUNCIL AT VARIOUS POINTS TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT WAS SAID, WHETHER WE ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OR THINGS NEED TO CHANGE.
03:01:06.142: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:01:10.380: >> Councilmember Disch: SO YOU ARE ASKING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF AN INDICATION OF PRIORITY. SO IF THERE'S SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN THE ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED -- THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED AROUND THESE DESIGNATIONS AND T1, COUNCIL MIGHT -- YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW WHETHER COUNCIL WOULD LIKE PLANNING COMMISSION TO REALLY, YOU KNOW, WORK ON THIS AND GET C1A AND C1A/R RIGHT OR WORK A LITTLE HARDER ON T1 AND, YOU KNOW, PUT THIS ONE -- OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO -- BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT MAYBE WE CAN ADDRESS THESE ISSUES OF DENSITY ADJACENT TO RESIDENTIAL THROUGH ANOTHER WAY RATHER THAN TRYING TO REFINE THESE ZONING DESIGNATIONS THAT MAY BE OUTMODED. I'M TRYING NOT TO -- I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF CLARITY ABOUT WHERE THE -- WHAT THE CHOICES ARE THAT YOU WOULD -- I FEEL LIKE -- IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR COUNCIL TO PRIORITIZE BUT TO PRIORITIZE ONE NEEDS A LIST OF TRADEOFFS AND I'M ASKING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF GUIDANCE ON THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT MAYBE THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO ASK FOR AND IF NOT, THAT'S OKAY. I WOULD -- I WOULD WITHDRAW THAT REQUEST.
03:02:38.668: >> Chair Mills: I THINK THE BASIC TRADEOFF IS STAFF TIME AND OUR TIME. THERE'S ONLY SO MANY HOURS IN THE DAY. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THE -- YOU KNOW -- AND ACTUALLY, I'M -- COMMISSIONER ABRONS, I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT YOU RAISED THIS POINT BECAUSE THE WAY THIS ENDS, THIS IS STUFF THAT WAS IN OUR PACKET THIS WEEK BUT WE HADN'T LOOKED AT IT. THE WAY IT END, IT SAYS THAT WE DO -- THAT WE WILL EXPLORE THE FINAL BULLETED LIST OF FOUR THINGS, AND ANTICIPATE PRESENTATION FOR CHANGE -- YOU KNOW, ORDINANCE CHANGES BY APRI. I WONDER IF THAT'S A -- IF THAT -- THAT DOES NOT SUGGEST TO ME THAT THEY ARE ASKING COUNCIL TO CALL US OFF OR TO SAY GOOD FORWARD. I THINK ONE OF THE -- GO FORWARD. I HAVE THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD SEND BACK TO MR. LENART IS WHETHER THIS IS, INDEED PART OF OUR -- IF THAT'S HOW IT'S STRUCTURED IN OUR WORK PLAN AND THAT WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO GET TO THIS, AND ALL OF THOSE OTHER THINGS, OR IF THIS IS ONE WHERE CLOSER TO WHAT COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN WAS SAYING IS LIKE GIVE US SOME FEEDBACK, COUNCIL. DO YOU THINK THESE FOUR THINGS ARE OKAY? I WOULD SUGGEST TO COMMISSIONER ABRONS POINT, THERE ARE THINGS BEYOND THIS LIST THAT PEOPLE -- THAT WE HAVE HEARD PEOPLE ASK FOR. RIGHT, THAT YOU WERE ASKING PEOPLE TO DIG INTO. WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE LANGUAGE IN THESE DISTRICTS AND A LOT OF THAT -- THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ON THIS LIST ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE IS WHERE ARE MASTER PLAN CALLS FOR THIS SPECIFIC DISTRICT, OR WHERE IT DOESN'T, -- WHERE IT DOESN'T CALL FOR THAT SPECIFIC ITEM. I THINK WHETHER THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TO DISTRICT TO APPLY IS GOING TO COME BACK AND BACK. THE CRITIQUE I HAD OF THIS IS THAT I REMEMBER, PERHAPS, ONE OF OUR WORKING SESSIONS WHERE WE SAID, WE'RE NOT READY TO SCRAP THIS UNTIL WE LOOK AT THE MASTER PLAN AGAIN. LIKE, WE THINK IT'S OKAY, BUT REALLY, BEFORE WE DETERMINE WHERE IS AN APPROPRIATE DISTRICT, WE NEED TO LOOK. THAT'S THE THING THAT I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IS MAYBE IT'S BETWEEN THE LINES ABOUT THIS EVOLUTION OF WHERE CAMPUS IS AND THAT, BUT IT -- IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY -- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TIDE BACK TO THE PLAN -- TIED BACK TO THE PLAN BUT I CAN -- GIVEN HAVING READ THROUGH THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN, THAT IS A -- AND THE -- AND THE BASIS ON WHICH WE REZONE, THE CONCERN IS NOT OVER THE EXISTING THINGS THAT ARE ZONED C1 AND C1A/R, IT'S ABOUT WHEN WE REZONE, PEOPLE SAY THIS IS NOT WHAT IS CALLED FOR IN THE MASTER PLAN AND SO THAT -- AND IT'S WHAT ELEMENT OF THE MATTER PLAN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? AND IS IT THAT -- SO I THINK THAT WILL BE A CONTINUED CONCERN. FROM PLANNING AREA PERSPECTIVE, WE SEE THAT AS ONE OF THE CHALCHLENG GOING FORWARD. EVEN THI LIST OFOUR THINGS WILL NOT SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS. COMMSIONERAUVE. READT, IT'S A TWO-STEP CONSIDERATION. WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE BEFORE WE DO THE WORK ON THE HARDER PART. IT REQUIRES A LOT MORE STAFF TIME. THE FOUR POINTS WE ARE LOOKING AT REALLY TIDY UP WHAT THIS DISTRICT IS AND I THINK ARE VERY FEASIBLE AND REASONABLE ORDINANCE CHANGES TO ACCOMPLISH BY APRIL 1st WITHOUT LOSING THE INTENT OF THE THING WHILE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE. BUT TO COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN'S POINT, THIS GIVES US A CHECK POINT TO GO BACK TO COUNCIL AND SAY THESE ARE THE BIGGER ISSUES THAT WE ARE SEEING, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO PURSUE, NOW THAT WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED WHAT THEY ARE? BECAUSE WHEN THIS WAS BROUGHT FORWARD TO US, IT WAS A DIFFERENT FORM OF COUNCIL, DIRECTING THIS HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE WANT TO HAVE THE CHECK POINT TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION OF YOU HEARD ONE THING AND WE LOOKED AT IT AND WE ARE SEEING THIS INSTEAD. ARE WE ON THE SAME PAGE? ARE WE ON A DIFFERENT PAGE? HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD? IS IT A PRIORITY TO MOVE FORWARD OR ARE THERE OTHER SIMILAR THINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. I FEEL COMFORTABLE IT BALANCES THOSE TWO. WE CAN TAKE SOME SMALLER ACTIONS BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO KEEP -- YOU KNOW, AS AN AVAILABLE TOOL IN THE MASTER PLAN, BUT THERE'S BIGGER ISSUES AND WE WANT TO HAVE A CHECK POINT BEFORE WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON WHAT MIGHT BE A BIG ISSUE OR WHAT MIGHT NOT BE RELATIVE TO COUNCIL ALSO WEIGHS IN ON WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE. SO IT'S TWOFOLD IS HOW I READ INTO IT. AND SO, LIKE, FOR ME, EVEN WITH THIS, I FEEL LIKE THOSE FOUR LAST BULLET POINTS ARE FEASIBLE ACTION ITEMS AND VERY SPECIFIC ONES THAT WE MIGHT GET, YOU KNOW, INPUT BACK FROM CITY COUNCIL, DON'T DO THOSE BUT OTHERWISE, WE ARE PREPARED TO DO THEM IF THE FEEDBACK IS, YES, THIS SOUNDS GOOD.
03:08:24.680: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
03:08:25.548: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I WONDER IF IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT LAST SENTENCE BEFORE THE FOUR BULLET POINTS READS THIS IS PROPOSED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER, THAT MIGHT BE REVISED TO SAY, LIKE -- I WON'T GET THE WORDS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME, WAYS TO ACHIEVE THIS MIGHT INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING, LIST THOSE BULLETS AND THEN MAYBE THE LAST PARAGRAPH COULD BE AMENDED TO SAY TO EXPLICITLY REQUEST FEEDBACK FROM COUNCIL AND TO TAKE OUT THIS HARD APRI 1st DATE. BUT, YEAH, I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY.
03:09:17.466: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
03:09:20.369: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I'M 100% ON BOARD, ESPECIALLY WITH THAT HARD DATE AS I THINK ABOUT IT, APRIL 1st, IN ALL REALITY, WE HAVE PAY LOT ON OUR PLATE AND ALSO IN ALL REALITY, WE ALSO ONLY HAVE THREE WORKING SESSIONS BEFORE THIS DATE. AND THREE ORC MEETINGS BEFORE THIS DATE. THERE'S STILL A LOT TO BE DISCUSSED ESPECIALLY DEPENDING ON THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVE FROM COUNCIL. SO I DEFINITELY -- I'M IN TOTAL AGREEMENT OF REMOVING THAT DATE AND YOUR OTHER CHANGES ARE GREAT, EVEN THOUGH IT'S FIRST DRAFT, IT WAS A GREAT DRAFT.
03:10:17.393: >> YOU ARE MUTED.
03:10:19.929: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. I HEAR THAT THAT'S A MOTION TO AMEND THAT WOULD BE SECONDED. IS THAT FAIR?
03:10:29.772: >> I MAKE A MOTION TO AMEND.
03:10:32.842: >> Chair Mills: SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT, WHICH WOULD NOT LIMIT THE POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THOSE IN THE ENUMERATED LIST OF FOUR AND STRIKE THE CERTAIN -- THE DATE CERTAIN AT THE END. COMMISSIONER DISH.
03:10:57.299: >> I WAS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT I GOT PART OF THE WORDING EXACTLY THAT IS KIND OF NOT LIMITED TO -- I MEAN I THINK THAT WAS THE MAIN POINT YOU WERE GETTING ACROSS FOR THE FIRST CHANGE, YOU WANT TO INCLUDE THOSE FOUR BUT IT'S NOT LIMITED TO JUST THESE FOUR, IT COULD BE OTHER ONES BUT MAYBE COMMISSIONER DISCH HAS ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT OR --
03:11:20.823: >> Councilmember Disch: NEW YORK I WANTED TO ACTUALLY -- NO, I WANTED TO ACTUALLY -- I FELT WE SHOULD READ THE AMENDED LANGUAGE.
03:11:27.663: >> YEAH.
03:11:27.963: >> Councilmember Disch: BEFORE WE VOTED ON IT.
03:11:31.167: >> Commissioner Abrons: INSTEAD OF SAYING THIS IS PROPOSED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER, MY AMENDMENT PROPOSES THAT IT WOULD SAY, THIS MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED -- NO. WAIT. HOLD ON IT. WHAT DID I SAY? SOMETHING ABOUT NOT LIMITED TO.
03:11:58.961: >> WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING --
03:12:02.364: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I WANT THAT INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING.
03:12:07.169: >> Chair Mills: THIS MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED --
03:12:15.878: >> Commissioner Lee: THIS IS PROPOSED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE FOLLOWING PLANNER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO REMOVAL OF THE -- IS THAT WHAT WE --
03:12:23.452: >> Commissioner Abrons: THAT'S FINE.
03:12:25.020: >> Commissioner Lee: SO PHRASE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IS --
03:12:28.691: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
03:12:30.025: >> INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO.
03:12:31.327: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND THEN I WAS PROPOSING TO LEAVE THE FOUR BULLET POINTS AS IS. AND A AMEND THE LAST SENTENCE. I WOULD I WOULD -- INSTEAD OF -- SO INSTEAD OF SAYING WITH ANTICIPATED PRESENTATION OF ORDINANCE CHANGES, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. I WOULD SAY SPENDING FEEDBACK FROM CITY COUNCIL. REGARDING THIS MEMO OR SOMETHING.
03:13:09.365: >> Chair Mills: SO THIS IS AFTER THE COMMA, RATHER THAN WITH ANTICIPATE, IT'S PENDING FEEDBACK FROM CITY COUNCIL?
03:13:15.604: >> Commissioner Abrons: CORRECT.
03:13:21.243: >> Councilmember Disch: DIRECTIO N INSTEAD OF FEEDBACK.
03:13:27.683: >> Chair Mills: DIRECTION.
03:13:34.890: >> Commissioner Sauve: DO WE NEED TO OUTLI THE TWO DIRECTIONS, THE FOUR BULLETS -- THE SEVEN BULLETS ABOVE? OR JUST ASK FOR DIRECTION OVERALL? I DON'T KNOW.
03:13:48.804: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I THINK OVERALL. OR -- LEAVING IT VAGUE ALLOWS THEM TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON ANY OF IT.
03:14:00.282: >> Chair Mills: IN REALITY, ACTUALLY NOW THAT I'M LOOKING AT THIS AND THE WAY THAT LISA LAID IT OUT, THE FIRST -- SORRY, COMMISSIONER SAUVE LAID IT OUT, THE FIRST SEVEN BULLETS, RIGHT, BUT EFFECTIVELY, WHAT WE SUGGEST -- IF YOU NUMBERED THEM, LET'S SAY, -- ALL WE ARE REALLY DOING IS ADDRESSING BULLET NUMBER FIVE, THAT'S -- THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE. WE'RE SAYING NUMBER FIVE IS THE LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT MAY TAKE AWAY, LIKE A LOT OF HEARTBURN, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THIS AND SO MAYBE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- THAT DOES NOT COME THROUGH. WE KNOW THAT, BUT THAT I DON'T THINK IS COMING THROUGH HERE. AND SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE WE NEED THAT ASH DEN WHAT WE NEED TO SAY TO COUNCIL IS EFFECTIVELY HERE ARE THE FOUR BULLETS YOU CAN DO TO ADDRESS NUMBER FIVE, BUT MAYBE NUMBER FIVE IS NOT THE RIGHT THING, LIKE -- AND WE DON'T DON'T THINK THAT DOING NUMBER FIVE ALONE IS GOING TO SOLVE THE WHOLEROBLEM. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. I THINK WE WANT FEEDBACK ON ALL OF IT. IS THAT FAIR? IT SEEMS LIKE WE WILL HAVE TO EDIT IT MORE PANE WE SHOULDN'T O IT ON THE FLY AT 10:15. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
03:15:38.013: >> Commissioner Sauve: IF WE LEAVE IT OPEN ENDED, AND WE JUST SAY, DIRECTION TO ALL OF IT, THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A COUNCILMEMBER ON PLANNING COMMISSION IS TO RELAY THAT SORT OF FILTER TO IT, TO UNPACK IT MORE IN THE DISCUSSION IN CITY COUNCIL, OR OR WE COULD BE MORE EXPLICIT ABOUT THESE THINGS ARE NOT SPECIFIC ORDINANCE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE HAVE YET TO RESOLVE INTO, YOU KNOW, RECOMMENDATIONS. IS IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT CITY COUNCIL WOULD LIKE ADDITIONAL EFFORT TOWARDS AND IN WHAT PRIORITY? SO IF WE GO THAT FAR, MAYBE IF WE TAKE ANOTHER DAY TO LOOK AT THAT OR WE SAY LOOK AT IT ALL AND COMMISSIONER DISCH RELAYS ALL OF THIS DISCUSSION. I'M OPEN TO EITHER. I'M OPENING IT UP TO THE CONVERSATION OF A COUPLE OF DIERENT WAYS TO GO.
03:16:41.643: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH THERE WAS A QUESTION TO YOU.
03:16:46.749: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SO FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T FIND IT RIGHT NOW, THE -- DIDN'T WE -- DIDN'T THE ORIGINAL MOTION FROM CITY COUNCIL ASK FOR A RESPONSE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR?
03:16:54.857: >> Chair Mills: I THINK IT DID.
03:16:57.026: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE AN OPTION. -- I THINK WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THEM BY THE END OF THIS YEAR, JUST TWO WEEKS AWAY AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL MEETINGS. UNFOUNATELY, I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO DO THIS ON THE FLY. AND I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF SORT OF LEAVING IT OPEN ENDED AND HAVING COMMISSIONER DISCH DELIVER THIS WITH THE MEMO.
03:17:21.517: >> Councilmember Disch: YES, I'M -- I'M LOOKING AGAIN. I HADN'T -- I DIDN'T GO BACK AND RELOOK AT THE MEMO, BUT IT'S AN EXTREMELY IT'S AN EXTREMELY BROAD, LIKE -- LIKE, FIRST HALF IS REALLY BROAD. SO I WOULD INTERPRET THAT WHAT THIS MEMO IS ASKING FOR IS ARE YOU INTERESTED IN US FURTHER EXPLORING P BULLET PNTS, T LAST FOUR BLET POINTS AND TRANSLING THAT INTO ORDINCE IN SOME AUNT OF TIME. WHIC INCDES A LOT OF HEAD A INGS,ND DO YOU WANT US TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS? AND DEVELOP SOME ORDINANCES -- DEVELOP SOME LIKE TIDY FIXES. BUT I THINK THE EXPRESSION I HEARD FROM COMMISSIONER SAUVE, HERE'S A TIDY FEASIBLE FIX THAT PROVIDES SOME SECURITY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS ZONING DISTRICT, BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T REACH THE VERY BROAD RANGE OF CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THIS BUT DO WE NEED TO REACH THAT BROAD RANGE OF CONCERNS BY FIXING THIS ZONING DESIGNATION OR ARE THERE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN GO ABOUT THAT, THAT MIGHT BE MORE FRUITFUL USE OF PLANNING COMMISSION'S TIME? I THINK WE WANT TO -- RIGHT. WE DON'T WANT TO LAUNCH A GIANT THING ON COUNCIL BECAUSE THAT CAN GO UNTIL 2:00 IN THE MORNING. SO -- BUT I DO -- SO -- BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS IS A GREAT -- THIS IS AN UPDATE, RIGHT? THIS IS AN UPDATE. THIS IS WHAT WAS ASKED FOR. WE HAVE A GREAT SET OF TIDY FIXES THAT PEOPLE CAN SAY YES OR NO AND THEN THERE'S A REQUEST, DO YOU WANT UTZ T US TO KEEP TAG ABOUT AND REQUIRING MIXED USES AND DO YOU WANT US TO TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH THE CITY HAS CHANGED HASN'T IF YOU WANT US TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION, WHICH I THINK WE DO WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION, IS THIS THE VENUE FOR IT, OR IS THERE ANOTHER VENUE FOR THAT CONVERSATION? I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR. SO I THINK I CAN -- BECAUSE THE -- YEAH, I THINK COMMISSIONER MILLS CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SEVEN AND THE FOUR. DIRECTION ON THE FOUR IS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND DIRECTION ON THE SEVEN IS BROAD. AND SO I WILL COMMUNICATE THAT.
03:20:29.938: >> Chair Mills: GREAT.
03:20:31.073: >> Councilmember Disch: YEAH.
03:20:31.773: >> Chair Mills: AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT TO PUT AFTER THE COMMA IN THE VERY LAST SENTENCE BECAUSE THAT'S THE -- THE MOTION BEFORE US -- MR. KOWALSKI, DO YOU HAVE WHERE WE LEFT IT? THE FIRST PART ABOVE THE BULLET POINT, WHICH PART ARE YOU SAYING? AFTER? WE WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT TAKING OUT THE DATE.
03:21:00.235: >> Councilmember Disch: I THINK IT'S DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ARE EXPLORED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION PENDING DIRECTION FROM CITY COUNCIL.
03:21:08.443: >> YES. SO THAT'S AFTER, DIRECTLY AFTER -- THAT'S DIRECTLY AFTER THAT COMMA AND PLANON COMMISSION. SO THE WHOLE LAST PART OF THAT SENTENCE WITH THE PRESENTATION, THAT'S GONE, JUST PENDING DIRECTION FROM CITY COUNCIL.
03:21:25.027: >> Councilmember Disch: AND THE WAY I WOULD READ THAT IS THAT PLANNING COMMISSION IS ASKING FOR DIRECTION IMMEDIATELY ON THE FOUR BECAUSE THE FOUR ARE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, RIGHT? AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER PIECE OF THIS MEMO THAT WE CAN ALSO GIVE DIRECTION ON, BUT THOSE ARE NOT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THOSE ARE PRETTY BIG ACTION ITEMS, AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR WHETHER THIS IS THE VENUE TO CONTINUE THOSE ACTION ITEMS OR WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER PROJECTS THAT WOULD.
03:21:59.828: >> Chair Mills: SO DO YOU WANT ANOTHER SENTENCE OR WILL YOU VERBALLY COMMUNICATE THAT.
03:22:03.198: >> Councilmember Disch: I WILL VERBALLY COMMUNICATE THAT, UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE ANOTHER SENTENCE. YES. THANK YOU FOR CALLING MY ATTENTION TO THAT.
03:22:13.041: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ALL RIGHT. SO WE HAVE THE PROPOSAL TO AMEND THIS, WHICH WOULD ADD -- INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BEFORE THE BULLET LIST OF FOUR, ALTER THAT LAST SENTENCE AFTER THE COMMA TO SIMPLY PENDING DIRECTION FROM CITY COUNCIL. ANY MORE DISCUSSION ON THOSE TWO CHANGES TO THIS MEMO? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT? THIS IS NOT FOR THE WHOLE THING TO FORWARD. THERE CAN STILL BE DISCUSSION. THERE IS JUST PARTICULARLY NEWBIES KNOW KIND OF WHAT THIS IS, THIS IS JUST FOR THE AMENDMENT. WE'LL JUST DO A VOICE VOTE. SO RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY YES. [CHORUS OF AYES] I SEE EVERYBODY'S HANDS. SO THERE CAN BE NO ONE OPPOSED. NO ONE OPPOSED. SO NOW THE MOTION THAT -- AS BEFORE US IS AMENDED. SO IT'S -- THE MOTION IS TO FORWARD THIS MEMO -- THAT WE HAVE NOW AMENDED. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDED MEMO? ALL RIGHT. LET'S VOTE. AND -- I THINK WE CAN DO A VOICE VOTE ON THIS ONE TOO. ALL IN FAVOR, RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY YES. [CHORUS OF AYES] THERE'S COMMISSIONER LEE. OKAY. THIS CAN BE NOBODY OPPOSED BECAUSE I SAW EVERYBODY'S HAND. SO IT IS APPROVED. IT PASSES. OKAY. THANK YOU. LET ME GO BACK TO THE AGENDA. WE'RE ON ITEM 11, WHICH IS PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS T IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK ABOUT ANY ITEM OF INTEREST. PUBLIC COMMENT CAN BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247, AND THEN ENTERING MEETING ID99577681361. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT RAISED YOUR HAND, YOU DO THAT BY PRESSING STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. THE STAFF WILL CALL ON YOU USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND NOISES AND PLEASE ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS AND THE TWO PEOPLE ON THE LINE HAVE THEIR HANDS RAISED.
03:24:52.567: >> CALLER EN ENDING IN 534, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
03:25:03.044: >> HI, THIS IS TOM STULBERG AGAIN, 1202 TRAVER STREET. WELL, I GUESS YOU HAVE ALREADY PASSED SOMETHING. I WISH COULD HAVE HELPED YOU ALONG BEFORE THEN. I WOULD MAKE YOUR JOB REAL EASY. I WOULD SCRAP THE LIST AND SCRAP THE TWO ZONING CATEGORIES ALL TOGETHER. SPEND YOUR PRIORITY TIME ON TRANSIT SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT INSTEAD. THERE'S ONLY BEEN TWO USES OF THIS C1A IN 20 YEARS AND C1A/R IN 50 YEARS. THE C1A WAS TURNED DOWN AND C1A/R WAS APPROVED. BOTH WERE INAPPROPRIATE. AND IT STARTS TO EXPERIENCE SOME OTHER ISSUES, BUT THAT WAS NONLEGAL CONDITIONAL ZONING THAT WAS PROPOSED FOR THAT SO IT'S A GOOD THING THAT IT DIDN'T PASS. IT WOULD HAVE HAD THE CITY IN SIGNIFICANT JEOPARDY AND NOT STOOD UP IN COURT. IF THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN USED TWICE AND ATTEMPTED TO BE USED TWICE, LET'S JUST GET RID OF THEM. YOU HAVE NO LOSS THERE, BUT YOU ALREADY PASSED THAT MOMENT. SO I THINK WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO, YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING PALATABLE THAT IT'S FIND WHERE IT'S LEFT AND LOWERTOWNLEAVEIT AND LOWERTOWN. THEY ARE IN THE CORE AREAS. YOU CAN LEAVE THE PREMIUMSTHERE. IF YOU KEEP THEM WHERE THEY BELONG, I THINK THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT TO MAKE THEM PALATABLE SO THEY COULD BE SPREAD EVERYWHERE, AND IT WAS TO CORRAL THEM. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SPECIFICALLY C1A/R, THERE'S ALL OF THESE SMALL LOTS AND THE F. AR CAN ONLY GET SO BIG. IF YOU LET IT SPREAD ELSEWHERE, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET INTO THE HEIGHT ISSUES BECAUSE OF THE FAR. SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PUT THE FIXES ON IF YOU JUST CORRAL THESE TO WHERE THEY REALLY BELONGED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO YOU STILL ARE STUCK LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES WHERE DO THEY BELONG. YOU SENT IT OFF TO COUNCIL.
03:27:37.499: >> 30 SECONDS.
03:27:38.266: >> AN I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO IT BY THE END OF THE YEAR. YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS. AS WE LOOK AT THIS FURTHER, I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A LOT MORE INPUT ON WHY ON WHY IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO SPREAD THESE PAST WHERE THEY WERE REALLY INTENDED TO DO, AND I URGE YOU IN THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN THIS COMES BACK TO YOU AFTER THE DIRECTION OF COUNCIL TO READ THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE PROVIDED, TO READ THE ACTUAL LAWSUIT FILING AND READ THE NOVEMBER 2017 LEADER FROM SUSAN FREELANDER WHICH INCLUDES A REPORT FROM THE PRIOR PLANNING DIRECTOR TO PLANNING COMMISSION. THERE IS A WEALTH OF INFORMATION IN THERE AND IT'S ALL CONCLUSIVE THAT THESE DO NOT BELONG TO BE SPREAD OUTSIDE WHERE THEY BELONG, WHICH IS A LIMITED AREA.
03:28:24.145: >> THANK YOU.
03:28:25.613: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU.
03:28:39.661: >> CALLER ENDING IN 556, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTE.
03:28:59.781: >> HI, THIS IS RALPH McKEY. I HAVE A SIMILAR DIRECTION ON THIS AS TOM. FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESTRICT THESE ARE GET RIDF THEM AND SOMEHOW IN THE INITIAL DISCUSSIONS AND THE INITIAL COMMENTS FROM STAFF, IT TOOK ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION, WHICH WAS MORE LIKE HOW CAN WE EXPAND THEM TO USE THEM AND MAKE THEM PALATABLE, THAT'S EXACTLY, AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE DIRECTION THAT WAS GIVEN IN TERMS OF HOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL DIRECTION WAS NOT FOLLOWED. AND THE POINT REALLY IS I THESE -- TSE CAUSE ALL SORTS OF DECISIONAL PROBLEMS, AND ZONING TWISTS AND TURNS. IF YOU TAKE THEM OUT OF THE ORIGINAL AREA WHERE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDE IF YOU TRY T MAKE THEM FIT OTHER PLACES,OUUNNTO A RTS OF PROBLS WHICH YOU GOACK TTHERIGINALAND IF YOU DIRECTIO YOUAN SOL A LOT OF PROEMSND IOT TO SAY T LAST BIT OFHE DISCUSSION, THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST CONFUSING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW NO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM. IT'S A SELF-INFLICTED PROBLEM. IF YOU WANT TO RESOLVE IT, YOU SHOULD GOOD ETHEL POTTS RID OF THAT PROBLEM. ALL OF THE MATERIALS AND ALL THE THINKING THAT YOU ARE DOING WILL BE VERY PRODUCTIVE AND THAT'S BECAUSE VIRTUALLY ALL THE ISSUES THAT TOM AND I HAVE IDENTIFIED ARE FRONT AND CENTER WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH THE TRANSIT SUPPORTED OR TRANSIT ORIENTED OR T1 OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL. IT ALL OF THOSE -- MANY OF THOSE ISSUES ARE FRONT AND CENTER. SO THINKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT YOU ARE DOING WILL BE VERY, VERY HELPFUL. AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO WHAT TOM JUST INDICATED, WHICH IS TO READ THOSE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL GIVE YOU BACKGROUND, WHICH IS TOTALLY APPLICABLE TO THE OTHER PROBLEM WHICH IS YOUR PRIORITY GOING FORWARD, AS I UNDERSTAND IT. SO THAT PIECE WILL BE HELPFUL. I HAVE ONE OTHER SORT OF MORE -- A LITTLE BIT
