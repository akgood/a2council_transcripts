00:01:00.115: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I WAS LOOKING FOR MY RAISE HAND. I MAY HAVE TO LEAVE THE CLOSED MEETING EARLY. I HAVE TO WORK TONIGHT.
00:01:11.927: >> Mayor Taylor: SO WE HAVE A MOTION TO GO TO CLOSED SESSION. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. EXCELLENT. WELL, THAT WILL BE PLACED AT THE END OF COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS, BEFORE OUR ADJOURNMENT, IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT TO THE BODY. WE DIDN'T SPECIFY, AND FOR OUR MAIN EVENT, YOU KNOW, WE DO TODAY ON OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT FROM THE EXPERTISE OF PROFESSOR JOHN TROPMAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WHO IS GOING TO TALK WITH US FOR A BIT ABOUT MEETINGS AND MEETING FACILITATION AND, YOU KNOW, GIVE US THE BENEFIT OF HIS EXPERTISE IN THE AREA. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO JOIN US, DR. TROPMAN. YOU HAVE THE COM.
00:02:05.047: >> YOU ARE ENTIRELY WELCOME.
00:02:14.556: >> City Admin. Crawford: PROFESS OR, I'M ENTIRELY HAPPY TO MOVE THE SLIDES IF YOU TELL ME WHEN TO ADVANCE THEM.
00:02:23.399: >> THANK YOU FOR THE TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS. IT IS PROBABLY YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE HAVING A MEETING ABOUT MEETINGS. I HOPE THAT SOME OF THE STUFF I CAN SHARE WITH YOU WILL BE -- WILL BE HELPFUL. THE TITLE IS "PRACTICES AND RECIPES" FOR A REASON. AND AS YOU WILL SEE IN A SECOND, IT'S DRAWN FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF INTERVIEWING A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO RUN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEETINGS EXTREMELY WELL. I WILL JUST SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND ORIENT YOU, BUT LIKE A RECIPE OR A COOKBOOK, YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO TAKE OUT OF IT WHAT YOU CAN. SO I WILL CUSTOMIZE SOME OF THIS. BUT IT'S GOOD TO START AS CLOSE TO THE RECIPE AS YOU CAN, SO YOU THE SORT OF GET THE FEEL FOR IT AND THEN YOU MODIFY IT. SO IT'S -- IT'S DESIGNED IN THAT WAY. YOU CAN GO TO SLIDE TWO. SO I HAVE DONE QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH ON MEETING MASTERS, LARGELY BECAUSE EARLY IN MY CAREER, I BECAME VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE MEETINGS I WAS ATTENDING. FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW, THEY WEREN'T TERRIBLY PRODUCTIVE BUT FROM A DECISION-MAKING POINT OF VIEW, I SAW THE GOOD HIGH-QUALITY DECISIONS WEREN'T ACTUALLY BEING BUILT. SO I PUT TOGETHER A TEAM AND GOT SUPPORT FROM THE 3M MANAGE. INSTITUTE AND SOME OTHER FUNDING AND WE BEGAN TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE, REALLY WHO HAVE THE REPUTATION FOR DEVELOPING AND PRESENTING VERY EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MEETING UNDER A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS CALLED SNOWBALL SAMPLING. IT'S REALLY A RANDOM SAMPLE. IT'S JUST WHO DOES THINGS REALLY WELL? AND OUR IDEA WAS THAT IF WE OBSERVED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DID THINGS REALLY WELL, IN -- I DIDN'T DO CORPORATE MEETINGS. I DID PUBLIC MEETINGS AND MEETINGS OF NONPROFITS. THAT'S WHERE THE FOCU FOCUS IS. I HAVE WORKED WITH CORPORATE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COURSE OF THE AIR FORCE AND COURSE OF MY WORK. SO THESE MEETINGS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY SOME OF THE FOLLOWING SORT OF POINTS. THE PARTICIPANTS ACTUALLY WANTED TO GO THERE. THEY ENJOYED WHERE THEY WERE, AND THEY WANTED TO PRODUCE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE. MY TEAM THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL COMMONALTIES IN THE SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS THAT THEY HAD AND THERE WERE, AND THESE GROUPS TAPPED INTO THE DEEPER STRUCTURE OF EXCELLENCE. AND THEY AVOIDED THE DOOM LOOP. SO WE CAN GO TO SLIDE NUMBER THREE. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW ABOUT THIS. THIS IS FROM THE WORK OF JIM COLLINS AND THE DOOM LOOP IS A SORT OF SOCIAL PROCESS THAT OCCURS IN ORGANIZATIONS WHERE DISAPPOINTING RESULTS OCCUR, REACTION WITHOUT AS MUCH UNDERSTANDING OCCURS AND THEN EVENTS AND BUILDUPS AND THINGS BEGIN TO DETERIORATE. OPPOSITE IS THE FLY WHEEL. THEY WERE ABLE TO CREATE ACCOMPLISHMENT DRIVEN MEETINGS AND I'M GOING TO SHARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THAT WITH YOU, AND IT'S NOT A LONG PRESENTATION, AND WHEN WE GET TO THE END, I WOULD LIKE TO GO AROUND WITH EACH OF YOU AND ASK YOU WHAT STRUCK YOU ABOUT THIS. LIKE, WHAT WAS YOUR SORT OF KEY TAKEAWAY AND WE'LL HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS ON LAST SLIDE AS WELL. BUT PEOPLE WERE ENERGIZED AT THE RESULTS THAT THEY GOT, WHICH IN TURN CREATED AN ENERGY THAT DROVE A SUCCESS FORWARD. SO OKAY. SO LET'S GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. IT WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY SORT OF MY COMMITMENT AN THAT OF OTHERS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A BETTER WAY OF DOING THINGS NO MATTER HOW WELL WE DO THINGS TO BEGIN WITH AND I GAVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF. THE FIRST IS THE BANANA. AND SOME OF YOU MAY BE AWARE OF THIS, BUT THE BANANA WE GRAB IT BY THE BANANA. THE REST OF IT HOLDS THE STALK AND IT'S EASY TO SCORE THIS PART OF THE BANANA UP ON THE TOP, BECAUSE THE FIBERS ARE LOOSER. SO THEY HAVE A BETTER WAY OF HANDLING THE BANANA. AND YOU WOULD THINK, WELL, YOU KNOW, HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY IMPROVE ON HOLDING A BANANA OR PEELING A BANANA. IT'S A SMALL THING, BUT IT'S SORT OF ILLUSTRATES THAT EVEN IN THE SMALL WAYS, THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THINGS. DOWN HERE IN THE BAGEL EXAMPLE. MY SON CUT HIS HAND TWO TIMES CUTTING BAGEL. AND IT FORCED ME TO THINK IS THIS A BETTER WAY, AND DISCOVERED IF YOU CUT THE BAGEL, IF YOU LAY IT FLAT, CUT IT IN HALF, YOU HAVE THE TWO LITTLE NICE LOAVES AND THEN YOU CAN CUT IT THAT WAY AND YOU DON'T CUT YOURSELF. THERE'S ALSO BAGEL HOLDING THINGS THAT YOU CAN GET. AND MOST RECENTLY, SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE NEW BAYS ENGLISH MUFFINS PACKAGES. WE ALL HAVE THOSE PACKAGES AND THEY CHANGED THE PACKAGES SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN IT FROM THE TOP AND IT REALLY IS SO MUCH EASIER. SO IF YOU CAN JUST SORT OF KEEP THIS? MIND THAT WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE ARE DOING. THERE MIGHT BE SOME IMPROVEMENT, SOME OF THEM TINY, LIKE THE BANANA AND SOME OF THEM CONVENIENT LIKE THE MUFFIN. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WILL BE SHARING WILL SORT OF FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY. CAN WE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE? SO I HAVE A LITTLE TEST FOR YOU. THESE ARE COMMON ERRORS THAT WE MAKE IN DECISION-MAKING GROUPS. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN THIS LITTLE TEST. HERE'S THE TEST. DON'T SHOUT OUT THE ANSWER. HERE'S THE QUESTION. HOW MANY NINES ARE IN THE ARRAY FROM 0 TO 100? THINK OF YOUR ANSWER. DON'T ME IT. OKAY. CHECK YOUR WORK. JUST BE SURE YOU GOT THE ANSWER THAT YOU ARE HAPPY WITH. EXCELLENT. LET'S SEE HOW WE DID. ANYBODY GET 20? SPEAK RIGHT UP.
00:10:57.045: >> YES. WHO WAS THAT.
00:10:59.981: >> Councilmember Griswold: KATHY GRISWOLD.
00:11:02.350: >> CAN YOU TELL US THE 10?
00:11:03.985: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I COUNTED IN THE TENS COLUMN AND TEN IN THE ONES COLUMN.
00:11:10.759: >> WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN COUNT MAT THEM OUT FOR US.
00:11:14.830: >> Councilmember Griswold:  9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95 ALL THE WAY UP TO 99.
00:11:33.949: >> VERY GOOD. THAT'S ABOUT THE RATIO OF THE PEOPLE WHO GOT THAT RIGHT. I GOT THE WRONG ANSWER. I GOT 11. I WENT UP THE RIGHT-HAND COLUMN AND I GOT TEN AND THEN I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT 99 HAD TWO NINES IN IT. AND SO I SAIDING WELL, THAT'S 11. THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A Ph.D., YOU SEE THINGS THAT OTHERS MISS. I WAS ASKED TO CHECK MY WORK AND I GOT 11 AGAIN. OF COURSE IT WAS WRONG. AND I WAS SITTING AT LUNCH WITH SO I AGREE TOED TO A PROPOSAL THAT THE LOSER WOULD PAY FOR LULUNCH. AND I THOUGHT THIS IS TERRIFIC. I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD SHOW AN ECONOMIST THAT IS A FREE LUNCH. IT WAS HIS LUNCH. ALMOST NOBODY GETS IT. SO WITH WHEN WE BEGIN TO PROCESS INFORMATION, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE GET THE WRONG ANSWER. OR WE GET A PARTIAL ANSWER. AND BY THE WAY, IF WE WERE IN RUPE AND I ASKED YOU TO WORK TOGETHER IN PAIRS OR THREE, IT WOULD TAKE 40 SECONDS FOR THE WHOLE GROUP TO GET THE RIGHT ANSWER. SO IF THE GROUP ONES WELL, YOU CAN BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WORKING BY YOURSELF. THE SECOND STEP, THE CHECK YOUR WORK STEP IS CALLED REVIEW FOR PROOF ONLY. ONCE YOU GET AN ANSWER THAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT, I BECOME COMMITTED TO IT. THAT'S STEP THREE. I THEN BECOME DEFENDING IT AND BEING INTERESTED IN IT AND I MAY BE LESS OPEN TO OTHER KINDS OF THINGS. SO THIS HAPPENS A LOT WITH US. AND I JUST PUT IT IN TO SORT OF SHOW US THAT WE ALL, MYSELF INCLUDED CAN BE SORT OF CAUGHT UP IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMON ERROR. IF WE WORK TOGETHER WELL, THIS HAPPENS MUCH LESS FREQUENTLYA. AND THAT'S SORT OF OUR GOAL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MEETING IMPROVEMENTS. LET'S GO TO SLIDE NUMBER SIX. SO WHAT DID THESE PEOPLE, WHOM WE CALL COMMITTEE MASTERS, MEETING MASTERS, THEY HAD A FRESH CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE GROUP'S WORK. AND THEIR CONCEPTUALIZATION WAS THAT SUCCESS FOR THEM WAS ACCOMPLISHMENT IN BUILDING HIGH QUALITY DECISIONS. THEY DID RECOGNIZE IT THROUGH DIFFERENTS AND SKILLS AND ORIENTATIONS BUT IN EACH CASE, THEY WERE ALSO COMMITTED TO ACCOMMODATION AND KEPT THEIR EYES ON THE RISE. THEY CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN MEETINGS AND FORUMS. MEETINGS WERE WORK ORIENTED. FORUMS WERE SORT OF PENDING A PERSONAL VIEW AND GOING BACK TO POINT NUMBER ONE, THE GOAL WAS A BETTER MEETING, BUT THE BIGGER GOAL WAS MAKING HIGH QUALITY COMMISSIONS. SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE WANT TO TRY TO KEEP OUR FOCUS. OKAY. SLIDE NUMBER SEVEN. INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES EXISTED BUT THIS WORK WAS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT. THEY MET ABOUT HALF AS LONG OR HALF AS FREQUENTLY AS IS TYPICAL. AS ONE CHAIR PUT IT, WE GET AS LITTLE DONE AS WE USED TO IN HALF THE TIME. AND THE MOST COMMON ANALOGY THAT THEY SHARED WITH ME AND MY TEAM WAS THE ORCHESTRA, SMALL ENSEMBLE, THE CHEF'S KITCHEN, WHERE EVERYBODY PLAYS A DIFFERENT PART BUT THE PRODUCT IS A GROUP RESULT. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SORT OF MAKE THAT SORT OF PART WHAT THEY -- YEAH, NEXT SLIDE. SO THE MATERIAL, AND THIS IS THE POINT I MADE SORT OF EARLIER ON IS LIKE A RECIPE BOOK. USE WHAT YOU CAN. ADAPT TO YOUR CULTURE, BUT FIRST START WITH A RECIPE AND TRY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE RECIPE WHERE IT WORKS FOR YOU. NEXT SLIDE. COMMON PRACTICES. OKAY. THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LITTLE STRESSFUL FOR YOU. THEY ALMOST NEVER MET AT NIGHT. NIGHT MEETINGS REGRETFULLY ARE STRUCTURALLY PROBLEMATIC. AND I UNDERSTAND FROM PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH SOME OF YOU FOLKS THAT PEOPLE WORK AND SO ON AND SO FORTH, BUT THEY WORK AROUND IT. SOME OF THEM USE THE 7 A.M. HOSPITAL STARTING MODEL. THEY HAD OTHER WAYS TO DO IT. THE PROBLEM WITH NIGHT MEETINGS IS PEOPLE ARE TIRED. ENERGY IS WANING. TO YOU ARE WORKING A LITTLE BIT AGAINST THE TIDE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WILL BE A CHALLENGE AND IT MAY REQUIRE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT OTHER WAYS THAT WE COULD DO THINGS. THEY AVOIDED FOOD AT MEETINGS, BUT SOCIALIZED A BIT BEFORE AND/OR AFTER. FOOD IS REFRESHING, DECISION-MAKING IS STRESSFUL. THEY RESPECTED THE CLOCK. THEY STARTED ON TIME AND ENDED ON TIME. AND ALL HAD TERMS OF REFERENCE, THAT WAS THE SET OF GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THEIR WORK TOGETHER. NEXT SLIDE. COMMON TOOLS THIS IS WHERE I WILL BE ASKING YOU SOME QUESTIONS. SO ONE THING THAT WAS VERY COMMON WAS THE AGENDA PELL. THEY ORGANIZED -- THEIR VIEW OF A MEETING WAS THAT IT WAS A DISTRIBUTION OF ENERGY OVER TIME. THEY ORGANIZED THEIR MEETINGS IN TERMS OF THE AGENDA FLO HE IN TERMS OF AN AGENDA BELL. THE SECOND. I WILL SHOW YOU THAT IN JUST A SECOND. THE SECOND WAS THE MENU AGENDA. PART OF THAT IS THE URGENT IMPORTANT CID. AND THE THIRD IS THE THREE OPTIONS RULE FOR SUBCOMMITTEE REPORTS. SO WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT EACH OF THOSE AND DISCUSS THEM A LITTLE BIT. CAN WE GO TO SLIDE NUMBER 11? OKAY. SO HERE'S THE AGENDA BELL. THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE CORE THINGS THAT THEY DID. AND ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONED ABOUT IT. WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. THEY STARTED WITH MINUTES IF THEY HAD MINUTES. SOME GROUPS DIDN'T HAVE MINUTES. THERE WERE A FEW AIDANCEMENTS. THAT'S VERY STUBBY TIME. THEN THEY IDENTIFY AHEAD OF TIME, WHOEVER STRUCTURES THE AGENDA FOR THEM OR THEMSELVES. WITH MODEST DECISION ITEMS. FOR YOU FOLKS THIS MIGHT BE CANNED FOR BOARDS IT'S OFTEN CONSIDERED THE CONSENT AGENDA AND THERE MIGHT BE SEVERAL ITEMS THERE. SO THEY WANTED TO PUT THOSE IN A CERTAIN PLACE. THIS IS NUMBER A, 3B, 3C, AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO MODEST DECISION ITEMS. THEY OFTEN HAVE JUST ONE ACTION TO BE TAKEN. MODERATE DECISION ITEMS MAY HAVE A COUPLE. THE TOUGHEST ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE. AND ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH MEETING, THE DECISION MAKING DREW TO A CLOSE. THEN THEY HAD BRAINSTORMING ITEMS, 6A, 6B, 6C, AND THESE WERE ITEMS FOR FUTURE AGENDA ITEMS THAT WERE BEING SORT OF NOODLED AROUND AND THOUGHT BAGHDAD, AND SOMETIMES THEY WERE -- THOUGHT ABOUT, AND SOMETIMES THEY WERE ON THE AGENDA IN THE BRAINSTORMING SECTION, FOR A COUPLE OF TIMES OR SOMETIMES EVEN THREE TIMES. , AND THEN THEY HAD A SMALL TRIVIAL ITEM, AND THEY WRAPPED UP. THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU. THINKING ABOUT IT, THIS WAS SO COMMON THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHY YOU THOUGHT THEY DID THAT. AND MAYBE MAYOR TAYLOR, I WILL START WITH YOU OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR POSITION. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:21:09.357: >> Mayor Taylor: IT STRIKES ME THAT IS A MEE MEETING ORGANIZEDN THIS FASHION WOULD BRING PARTICIPANTS IN SLOWLY, YOU KNOW, ACCLIMATE THEM TO EACH OTHER AND THE GROUP. IT -- THEN BUILDING TOWARDS THE -- YOU KNOW, THE MORE COMPLICATED ACTIONS HAVING THAT SERVE AS THE MEAT OF THE MEETING, IF YOU WILL AND ONCE THE COMPLICATED AND POTENTIALLY CONTENTIOUS ITEMS ARE RESOLVED, OR ADDRESSED OR ENGAGED IN SOME WAY, THEN BRAINSTORMING AND TRIVIAL ITEMS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CREATIVITY, BUT ALSO FOR GROUP BUILDING AFTER THE TOUGH DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE.
00:21:58.272: >> THAT'S AN EXCELLENT ANSWER AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE COVERED MANY OF THE KEY POINTS. SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ADD, STEVEN? I SEE YOU THERE. I'M GOING TO GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT I WILL PICK UP YOU NEXT.
00:22:14.021: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. GARY IS ONE OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE NEXT COUNCILMEMBER.
00:22:19.060: >> OKAY, I'M LOOKING FOR --
00:22:21.462: >> Mayor Taylor: NOT THAT HE'S NOT INTERESTED. I DON'T WISH TO DIMINISH YOUR OPPORTUNITY BUT IT'S ATYPICAL THAT HE WOULD PARTICIPATE.
00:22:29.437: >> OKAY. SO LET ME SEE, WHO ELSE -- I HAVEN'T MEMORIZED EVERYBODY ENOUGH TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. SO JULIE, ARE YOU -- YOU ARE A COUNCILPERSON?
00:22:45.953: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
00:22:46.554: >> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:22:48.022: >> Councilmember Grand: I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAD IS WE DO A LOT OF LISTENING TO PUBLIC COMMENT DURING OUR MEETINGS AND SOMETIMES WE CAN SIT FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS. SO WHERE DOES THAT FELT INTO THIS CURVE, THE PLACE FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND LISTENING? I THINK THE DECISION WE MADE TO MOVE OUR CONSENT AGENDA TO THE BEGINNING MODELS THAT WELL. IT ALSO IS MEANT TO RESPECT STAFF TIME. WE D A LOT OF SITTING.
00:23:21.055: >>YPALLY- I SUL'T S SHOUL'T SAY TYPICALLY, AT LEAST THE WAY THE PEOPLE -- MOST OF THE PEOPLE DID IT WAS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE COMMENT PERIODS BY THE ITEM BECAUSE THAT WAY -- THEY ALSO LIMITED IT IN SOME RESPECTS. SO THERE MIGHT -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD WORK FOR YOU. A POSSIBILITY IS THAT COULD YOU ORGANIZE YOUR MEETING INTO TWO BELLS. ONE IS A PUBLIC COMMENT BILL AND THEN ANOTHER IS THE ACTION BILL AND YOU COULD FEED THE COMMENTS AS THEY CAME UP APPROPRIATELY. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WOULD -- WE WOULD HAVE TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT. AND THEY DID HAVE GUESTS ALSO. THEY WEREN'T CITIZENS SOMETIMES ALWAYS. BUT THEY DID HAVE VISITORSORS. TRAVIS, ARE YOU A COUNCIL PERSON OR AN OTHER PERSON?
00:24:41.335: >> Councilmember Radina: I AM. I WAS LOOKING AT THIS AND I THINK THAT MANY TIMES THIS IS KIND OF HOW OUR AGENDA DOES FLOW SOME CAPACITY. I THINK HAVING THE BRAINSTORMING ITEMS AND THE SMALLER ITEMS AT THE END COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REIDENTIFY A GROUP AFTER I POTENTIALLY CONTENTIOUS DECISION AROUND SOME OF THE MORE DIFFICULT ITEMS. KIND OF BRING PEOPLE BACK TO A COMMONALTY. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HELP.
00:25:09.497: >> THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. I WAS GOING TO ASK WHY THE BRAINSTORMING IS AT THE END AND WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT, BUT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED ONE KEY REASON WHY IT'S AT THE END AND THAT IS DECISION-MAKING TEARS AT THE FABRIC OF GROUP COHESION. THAT'S THE REASON THAT PEOPLE TEND TO AVOID IT. IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. AND, YOU KNOW, JUST EVEN IN MY MEETINGS, ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE DEAN, SOMETIMES I GET WHAT I WANT. OFTEN I DON'T GET WHAT I WANT. BUT I'M GOING TO MEET WITH HER THE NEXT MONTH, AND SHE'S STILL GOING TO BE THE DEAN AND I'M STILL GOING TO HAVE THINGS I THINK SHE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AND SHE HAS THINGS THAT SHE WANTS ME TO CONSIDER. I DON'T WANT IF I POSSIBLY CAN, EVEN IN A DIADIC ON A NEGATIVE NOTE IF I CAN AVOID IT OR I WANT TO MODULATE THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVITY SO THAT WE DON'T RUPTURE THE RELATIONSHIPS. NOW, JANE, I KNOW YOU ARE A COUNCIL PERSON. WHAT DO YOU THINK? JEN, I'M SORRY.
00:26:30.811: >> Councilmember Eyer: NO. NO THAT'S FINE. I ANSWER TO BOTH. IT'S COMMON ENOUGH.
00:26:37.952: >> LUCKY FOR ME.
00:26:40.554: >> Councilmember Eyer: I THINK A LOT OF MY REACTIONS TO THIS HAVE BEEN SAID. I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT OUR CURRENT BELLA JEN DAH BELL -- I DO THINK THAT WE OFTENTIMES END THE MEETING ON A LESS THAN POSITIVE NOTE BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE AT THE END OF THE AGENDA. SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT -- THE MORE WE CAN BRING PEOPLE BACK TOGETHER AND BE POSITIVE TOWARDS THE END, AND GO AWAY WITH A GOOD FEELING -- I MEAN THAT CARRIES -- THAT WILL CARRY US THROUGH TO THE NEXT MEETING. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE MOMENT, BUT IT'S ABOUT HOW WE -- HOW WE FEEL GOING FORWARD IN BETWEEN MEETINGS.
00:27:42.016: >> THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE. YES. AND IT MAY NOT BE TOTALLY POSITIVE, BUT IT MIGHT BE LESS NEGATIVE. IF I DON'T GET WHAT I WANT FROM THE DEAN, I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE JUMPING FOR JOY BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, AND SHE HAS A BROADER PERSPECTIVE THAN I DO. AND THAT WOULD, TRUE IN MEETINGS AS WELL. BUT BUT THERE IS ANOTHER FUNCTION TO BRAINSTORMING. SO ONE, IT CAN HELP TO BRING PEOPLE BACK TOGETHER BUT THERE'S SOME OTHER FUNCTIONS TO IT, AS WELL. ELIZABETH, DO YOU WANT TO ADD TO THIS OR CAN YOU IDENTIFY SOME OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT THAT MIGHT SERVE? NOW, THESE ARE NOT DECISION ITEMS, REMEMBER. THEY ARE JUST BRAINSTORMING ITEMS FOR FUTURE TOPICS COMING UP.
00:28:40.507: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I THINK WE DO TEND TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN AT OUR MEETINGS, AND I THINK IT'S MOST INTERESTING WHEN THERE'S AN ITEM ON THE AGENDA THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED I IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND IT PROMPTS SOMEONE TO THINK ABOUT AN ISSUE IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND IT LITERALLY IS LIKE A REMARK THAT, LIKE, I WANT TO LOOK INTO THIS FURTHER, YOU KNOW, BASED ON THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE DISCUSSION MOVES IT FORWARD IN A WAY.
00:29:10.437: >> OKAY. SO IT -- AND 'EM A PEOPLE ARE ME LIKELY TO DO THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRESSING DECISION, THAN THEY ARE IF THE DECISION IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. SO I'M GOING TO GO LINH, ARE YOU A COUNCILPERSON?
00:29:34.295: >> Councilmember Song: HELLO, PROFESSOR TROPMAN. I AM.
00:29:37.364: >> OKAY. WELL, I NO HE  KNOW THAT YOU HAA KID, BECAUSE I SAW THAT KID. SO I WILL ASK YOU ABOUT THE TEN-MINUTE WARNING. DO YOU KNOW THAT? DO YOU USE THAT?
00:29:50.711: >> Councilmember Song: YES.
00:29:51.445: >> SO HOW WOULD THAT APPLY HERE? JUST FOR EVERYBODY'S BENEFIT, EXPLAIN YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF IT, AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN APPLY IT TO THIS PART OF THE AGENDA.
00:30:03.223: >> Councilmember Song: SO WHEN I USE IT WITH MY CHILDREN, IT'S JUST TO GIVE THEM NOTICE THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF WARNING TO GET READY. GET READY TO BE SITUATED ELSEWHERE, THROWN INTO A CAR, GET READY FOR THE NEXT ACTIVITY INSTEAD OF BEING STARTLED AND FORCED INTO --
00:30:23.344: >> AND WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR THEM AND YOU?
00:30:28.916: >> Councilmember Song: THE TRANSITION IS EASIER AND THEY ARE LESS COMBATIVE. WE ARE ALL LESS COMBATIVE AND IT'S A FAIR WARNING.
00:30:37.024: >> THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT IT SORT OF DOES IS IT PLEADS OFF A LITTLE OF THE RESENTMENT. WHEN ID TO  I USED TO TELL MY ST WAS TIME TO TURN THE TV OFF, WE REACH TO THE FLOOR AND CALL HIS LAWYER.
00:30:57.444: >> Councilmember Song: HE WOULD CALL HIS LAWYER?
00:30:59.346: >> HE WAS A LITTLE PRECOCIOUS AS A KID. THERE'S A BURST OF IRRITATION OR NEGATIVITY OR I DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND THAT SORT OF PASSES SO WHEN THE ACTUAL TIME COMES, IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER. SO PART OF THE FUNCTION OF BRAINSTORMING MAYBE ONE OR TWO TIMES SEEMS TO BE THAT --
00:31:24.304: >> Councilmember Song: I ALSO GIVE THEM CHOICES, THOUGH, DEPENDING IF WE HAVE TIME. SO IF IT'S -- VERSUS Y ULTIMATUS IF I CAN. IF I HAVE THE BRAIN SPACE TO DO THAT.
00:31:37.518: >> SAY THAT AGAIN. I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOWED WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.
00:31:40.387: >> Councilmember Song: I TRY TO GIVE THEM SO IT'S NOT JUST A TEN-MINUTE WARNING. IF WE ARE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH WITH OUR PLANS THEN I WILL SAY, YOU KNOW, WE'LL LEAVE IN TEN MINUTES TO GO TO THE LIBRARY, OR IF YOU -- IF YOU NEED TO STAY LONGER OR GO TO THE PARK, THEN LET ME KNOW. SO I TRY TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO TELL ME WHAT THEY WANT INSTEAD OF JUST TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO.
00:32:05.879: >> THAT'S EQUIVALENT AT HAVING A BRAINSTORMING ITEM AT TWO MEETINGS. SO THE OTHER THING THAT BRAINSTORMING DOES IT LETS EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS THINKING. AND SO THAT MAY TAKE US BACK TO, I THINK, POINT MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THINKING INDEPENDENT OF DECISIONS, YOU FEEL A LITTLE FREER. NOW ERICA, ARE YOU A COUNCILPERSON? SO CAN YOU ADD TO THIS? OR DO YOU HAVE SOME FURTHER THOUGHTS THAT YOU WANT TO CHIP IN?
00:32:44.985: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WAS TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS RELATES TO OUR COUNCIL MEETINGS VERSUS COMMISSION MEETINGS AND I HAD THE FEELING THAT IT'S -- THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR BRAINSTORMING WITHIN THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE ALL SERVE ON AS LIAISONS AND OFTENTIMES THAT BRAINSTORMING IS BUILT INTO THAT FUNCTION, BUT OFTEN AS A COUNCIL BODY, I'M NOT SURE THAT WE AS A GROUP HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BRAINSTORM TOO OFTEN TOGETHER. THERE'S A COUPLE OF TIMES A YEAR THAT WE COME TOGETHER AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP WORK PLANS OR DO THINGS LIKE THAT. I THINK THERE'S LIMITED SPACE WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF OUR CURRENT COUNCIL MEETINGSOR KIND OF BRAINSTORMING AND THE CAPACITY THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING OF.
00:33:28.529: >> WELL, YOU CAN -- I KNOW YOU HAVE COMMISSIONS AND OTHER BODIES AND SO THERE'S A WHOLE SOASERIES OF BODIES. IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO START WITH SOME OF THOSE IN A WAY AND AS YOU GET A LITTLE MORE EXPERIENCED WITH IT OR SOME DOCTORED VERSION OF IT, YOU CAN -- YOU CAN THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A MODEL THAT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU, THAT HAS SOME ELEMENTS OF THIS. YOU TRY TO START WITH THE EASY STUFF TO GET PEOPLE OFF ON A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. THAT FLOWS OR HOPEFULLY FLOWS INTO THE LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED ONES AND SO BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE TOUGHEST ITEM, PRESUMABLY, A LITTLE BIT OF GROUP COHESION FORMS. AND ONE THE THINGS ABOUT GROUPS IS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE RECONSTITUTED EACH TIME YOU MEET. BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL COMING FROM DIFFERENT PLACES. SO THE MODEST DECISION ITEMS IS A WAY OF GETTING PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER IN NONCONFRONTATIONAL WAY BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF NECESSARY. WORKING TOGETHER TO CUT THE GRASS HEY, YES, THE INFRASTRGRASS ISCUT. SO THAT'S SORT OF PART OF THAT. SO STARTING THE GROUP. CAN YOU THINK OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO IN OUR GENERAL LIVES THAT FOLLOW THIS PATTERN? RECLET ME SEE, I WILL GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT. JEFF, ARE YOU A COUNCILPERSON?
00:35:36.590: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
00:35:38.525: >> WHAT DO YOU THINK? ANYTHING COME TO YOUR MIND? DO YOU WORK OUT?
00:35:46.566: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I MEAN THIS -- THE CLOSEST THING I CAN THINK OF IS SOMETIMES IF I HAVE A LOT OF JO BEES BEFORE ME, I WILL DO SOMETHING EASY EARLY ON AND THE JOKE ON THE SIDE IS YOU WANT TO GET A WIN EARLY. YOU DO A BUNCH OF THINGS EASY, BEFORE YOU APPROACH SOMETHING MORE DIFFICULT LATER ON. IT HELPS YOU WITH YOUR DAY TO GET SOME WINS I AND GET SOME THINGS OFF THE CHECK LIST.
00:36:11.992: >> SURE. SOLUTELY.
00:36:12.759: >>ouncilmember Hayne  AND IT ADDS TO THIS CURVEER I DON'T ALWSO LIKE AT, BUTT'S SOMHING TT GS D IT'S SETHI THA PPLE D
00:36:20.233: >> EXCELLENT ANSWER. EXCELLENT ANSWER. WHAT ABOUT THE WORKOUT EXAMPLE?
00:36:25.839: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T WORK OUT.
00:36:28.775: >> WELL, I WASN'T SUGGESTING YOU PARTICULARLY. I JUST WAS MAKING -- SO IN WORKOUTS GENERALLY, IT'S WARMUP, HEAVY WORK, COOLDOWN.
00:36:38.452: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, WE USED TO DO THAT. WE USED TO DO A GROSS TAPER TOO OVER THE COURSE OF TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO TOURNAMENTS AND STUFF WHERE WE WOULD TAPER UP AND DOWN LIKE THAT OVER TWO WEEKS EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE WOULD HAVE THAT PROFILE, BUT THEN THE TWO-WEEK PROFILE WOULD OVER LIKE THAT.
00:36:56.136: >> SO YOU ARE DESCRIBING SOMETHING THAT'S VERY EXCELLENT, BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE SIMULTANEOUS THINGS GOING ON. SO WHAT YOU ARE POINTING AND THE PEOPLE I INTERVIEWED HAD TOO, THEY HAVE A MOMMA BELL AND BABY BELLS. SO THEY HAD AN OVERALL, LIKE ON A WEEK LONG RETREAT, LET'S SAY, THE WHOLE WEEK MIGHT BE ORGANIZED LIKE THIS. SO THIS MIGHT BE SORT OF MONDAY AFTERNOON, PEOPLE ARE ARRIVING AND THEN WE GET -- THIS WILL BE PROBABLY WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, THURSDAY AFTERNOON, FRIDAY. YOU JUST HAD IT ON A TWO-WEEK PERIOD. BUT I CAN SEE THAT WORKING. ANYBODY ON WITH US THIS EVENING A CHEF?
00:37:51.057: >> Councilmember Song: I USED TO BE A LINE COOK.
00:37:54.327: >> IS THAT KATHY.
00:37:55.896: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I OWN A RESTAURANT.
00:37:57.964: >> WHO SAID THAT, I OWN A RESTAURANT?
00:38:01.468: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:38:02.235: >> OKAY, WAIT Y. I DON'T SEE -- I GOT TO GO BACK UP TO SEE YOU.
00:38:10.110: >> Councilmember Song: HE HAS HIS HAND RAISED UP. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAD HIS HAND UP FOR A WILE.
00:38:15.916: >> I'M SORRY. I WASN'T LOOKING FOR THAT. I APOLOGIZE.
00:38:19.486: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
00:38:20.954: >> SO WHERE ARE YOU?
00:38:23.390: >> RIGHT HERE.
00:38:27.427: >> WIWELL, I DON'T HAVE SOME PEOPLE.
00:38:31.064: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DON'T HAVE THE FEW VIEW EITHER.
00:38:35.402: >> SO WHEN YOU SERVE A SORT OF MORE FANCY MEAL, DOES THIS RELATE TO TO THE ORDER OF FOOD?
00:38:45.479: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, THERE'S A WHOLE -- YOU KNOW, PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW, GETTING IT TO THE TABLE IS SOMEWHAT TOWARDS THE END OF THIS BOUT.
00:38:59.826: >> I WAS JUST THINKING SORT OF -- IF WE JUST STICK WITH THE MENU, FOR EXAMPLE, SO SOMEBODY HIRES YOU TO DO SOME CATERING AND SO --
00:39:13.206: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, YEAH, EARLY ON, YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF DECISIONS TO MAKE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. LIKE WHAT ARE THE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS? HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE? WHAT IS YOUR BUDGET? WHAT TIME ARE YOU EATING, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO ORDER THE FOOD. YOU'VE GOT TO SCHEDULE THE PEOPLE. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO DO PREP. SOMETIMES IT'S TWO OR THREE DAYS AHEAD OF WHEN YOU WILL BE SERVING THE FOOD. SO IT -- THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO IT.
00:39:50.377: >> THERE CERTAINLY S. AND WOULD IT BE SENSIBLE TO YOU TO SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE A FAIRLY FANCY MEAL, YOU MIGHT START WITH SOME SMALL ITEMS AND THEN, LIKE, OR R D'OEUVRES -- I'M MISPRONOUNCING IT, OF COURSE -- AND THE BIG PART OF THE MEAL IS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN SORBET AND THEN WRAP UP WITH SOME DESSERT.
00:40:24.811: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, IF YOU ARE HAVING 9 OR 12 COURSES, OR 22 COURSES. IT DEPENDS HOW MANY COURSES YOU WANT. BUT, YEAH. YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO -- IF YOU ARE DOING -- THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO HERE. YOU DEFINITELY ARE BUILDING UP AND YOU ARE TRANSITIONING DIFFERENT FLAVORS AND PROFILES AS YOU WORK BETWEEN COURSES.
00:40:50.804: >> SURE. AND MY LAST EXAMPLE -- ANYBODY A MUSICIAN? WELL, IF YOU WOULD BE A MUSICIAN AND YOU WERE DOING A -- AN AN ORCHESTRA PERFORMANCE, WHAT DO THEY USUALLY START WITH?
00:41:16.830: >> Councilmember Hayner: OVERTURE.
00:41:20.667: >> OVERTURE. IF YOU ARE NOT THERE ON TIME, THEY DON'T LET YOU IN RIGHT AWAY, AND MEANWHILE, THE ORCHESTRA IS PLAYING CANDID OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEY DON'T GET TO THE MAHLER UNTIL HERE AND THEN AT THE END, THEY MIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF ENCORES -- WELL, OUR CASE "HAIL TO THE VICTORS" PROBABLY, THEY WOULD FIND SOME WAY TO WORK THAT IN. AND SO IT'S SORT OF A CHEERFUL WAY. I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTRESS IT. I JUST WANT TO SORT OF INVITE YOU TO CONSIDER THE POINT IF THAT IF YOU HAVE A MODEL THAT APPEARS NOT ONLY IN VENUE ONE, LIKE MEETINGS BUT ALSO APPEARS POSSIBLY IN SOME KIND OF GASTRONOMIC EVENTS OR WORKING OUT, OR ORCHESTRA, IT GIVES IS AN AD ADDED MUSS  ADDED MUSCLEAE MATTER. WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. NOW THIS WILL SORT OF RELATE, I HOPE TO OUR RESTAURATEUR, THE PEOPLE ALMOST TO A PERSON, HAD A VERY DIFFERENT KIND AFTER JEN DAH. WHEN I WAS ON THE LAWTON GRADE SCHOOL P.T.O. WE HAD 17 STANDING.S, EACH OF WHICH REPORTED AT EVERY MEETING. AND MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT, BUT YOU NEVER WANT TO BE CAUGHT REPORTLESS OR COMMENTLESS AT A MEETING WHERE REPORTING IS GOING ON. SO IT LED TO A VARIETY OF ODD PARTICIPATE STORY EXAMPLES. SO -- AND THE AGENDA WAS ALWAYS THE SAME. IT NEVER VARIED. OLD BUSINESS, REALLY OLD BUSINESS. NEW BUSINESS, MATTERS ARISING, ADJOURNMENT. AND WE JUST NEVER SORT OF WERE ABLE TO GET OFF OF THAT HISTORICAL GERBIL WHEEL, I GUESS. I WILL GIVE YOU A SMALL EXPLANATION OF IT. THEY ALWAYS HAD CLOCK TIMES ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THEIR AGENDA. AND AS NUMEROUS INTERVIEWEES SAID, A MEETING WITHOUT TIMES IS LIKE A MENU WITHOUT PRICES. SO EVERYTHING IS MARKET PRICE. IT MEANS HAVE YOU NO IDEA WHAT ANYTHING IS GOING TO COST. SO CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE? SO HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. NOW, THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE. IT STARTS AT 2:00. ENDS AT 3:40. ANNOUNCEMENTS. RETREAT LOCATION. VENDOR SELECTION. DISPOSAL OF BROKEN BASKETS. PERMISSION TO SHIP -- THIS IS THE TOUGHEST ONE. THEY HAD A GASKET THAT HAD A BIG SCRATCH IN IT, BUT IT WAS TO BE BURIED. HOW SHOULD WE HANDLE THAT. THEN THEY HAD A DISCUSSION ON IMPROVING QUALITY AND THEN THEY ADJOURNED. SO THAT MEANS THAT EVERYBODY CAN FOLLOW ALONG AND YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT 10 MINUTES OR 15 MINUTES BECAUSE PEOPLE PULL OUT THEIR CALCULATORS. SO IF YOU HAVE AN AGENDA LIKE THIS, PEOPLE REALLY KNOW -- AND THE REASON IT'S LIKE A MENU IS BECAUSE IT HAS THE TOPIC, SO THE RETREAT LOCATION. OKAY, THAT WOULD BE LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW, AN ITEM TO EAT. THEN BELOW IT, IT EXPLAINS WHAT THAT ITEM IS. SO YOU GET A SORT OF ONE SENTENCE DESCRIPTION AND THEN LIST IT, ARE WE ACTING ON IT? ARE WE THINKING ABOUT IT? AND IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HANDLING SOME OF THESE ITEMS THEIR NAMES WOULD APPEAR AS WELL. NOW, THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU. BUT USING TIMES TO STRUCTURE NOT ONLY YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT YOUR OTHER COMMENT, THE ITEMS MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. LET ME GET BACK YOU TO DO YOU THINK SOMETHING LIKE, THIS SOME VARIATION OF THIS MIGHT HAVE ANY UTILITY FOR YOU GUYS? AND MAYBE IN THE COMMISSIONS MORE THAN THE COUNCIL ITSELF?
00:46:13.326: >> Councilmember Eyer: I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO AIM FOR WITH THE COUNCIL TO, YOU KNOW, GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN SOMEWHAT ACCURATELY PREDICT HOW -- YOU KNOW, HOW LONG OUR AGENDA ITEMS ARE GOING TO TAKE. AND I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S A GREAT EXERCISE FOR THOSE WHO ARE PUTTING THE AGENDA TOGETHER.
00:46:35.782: >> YES, IT IS.
00:46:37.250: >> Councilmember Eyer: YEAH, BECAUSE IT HELPS REALLY FORCE THE AGENDA SETTER TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA, HOW LONG THINGS ARE GOING TO TAKE, AND, YOU KNOW, IS IT GOING TO BE TOO LONG? ARE THERE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE -- THAT CAN BE POSTPONED OR WHAT HAVE YOU? SO I THINK, NO I THINK IT'S A GREAT THING. I HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT WITH MEETINGS THAT I HAVE RUN AND IT ABSOLUTELY HELPS TO KEEP PEOPLE -- KEEP EVERYONE, YOU KNOW, FOCUSED AND ON TASK.
00:47:12.385: >> I SEE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM YOUR TONE OF VOICE, THAT YOU HELD THAT STAYING ON TARGET AS WELL, AM I CORRECT ABOUT THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
00:47:24.697: >> Councilmember Eyer: I CAN BE A TASK MASTER WITH MEETINGS.
00:47:28.935: >> YES. MAYOR TAYLOR, WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU ARE THE RING LEADER HERE OR THE RING MASTER, I GUESS. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD WORK WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS? IT DOESN'T WORK ITSELF I MEAN IN THE SENSE. THERE HAS TO BE, YOU KNOW, AS JEN WAS SUGGESTING, PEOPLE TO SORT OF KEEP IT GOING. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN YOUR REACTIONS.
00:48:02.769: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS, YOU KNOW WE HAVE -- IT IS -- MY REACTION, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M WILLING TO BE EDUCATED OFF OF THIS, OF COURSE. BUT THAT -- YOU KNOW, STRICT ADHERENCE TO TIME FRAMES -- STRICT ADHERENCE TO TIME FRAMES FOR ITEM BY ITEM IS BETTER SUITED FOR A PRIVATE PETEING OR A MEETING OF, YOU KNOW -- MEETING OR A MEETING OF -- YOU KNOW, ANYTHING BUT ELECTEDS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A -- YOU KNOW, DISCERN HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK AND NOT EVERYONE CHOOSES TO SPEAK ON EVERY ITEM, ALTHOUGH WE REFLECT UPON WHAT AND WHEN WE CHOOSE TO SPEAK, HOW OFTEN WE CHOOSE NO SPEAK AND HOW LONG WE CHOOSE TO SPEAK. BUT TO HAVE EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS ON, YOU KNOW, DELIBERATION IN A PUBLIC SETTINGOR- STRIKES M AS -- AND SO, YOU KNOW, I'M UNCONVINCED THAT THIS PARTICULAR INNOVATION IS APPLICABLE, BUT, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO BE EDUCATED OTHERWISE.
00:49:26.819: >> WELL, COULD YOU GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT. IT'S -- IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THE PEOPLE I INTERVIEWED WERE ABLE TO SORT OF MOVE WITH THIS IS THEY KEPT THE FOCUS ON THE DECISION. NOT ON THE PARTICIPATION. SO THEY WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE GUIDANCE AND IT WASN'T JUST ONE DECISION. IT WAS ALL OF THE DECISIONS SO THE AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE I INTERVIEWED WAS AN ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR. HE SAID, WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS, YOU KNOW, THE VIOLIN SECTION IS PLAYING SOME KIND OF SINGLE BELLS AND THE HORN SECTION IS PLAYING THE MESSIAH, AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I MEAN, EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO PLAY, OF COURSE, BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE FOCUS THEIR PARTICIPATION ON THE ITEMS AT HAND AND OFTEN THAT'S TRUE, BUT IT'S THIS SORT OF -- THIS SORT OF HELPS A LITTLE BIT. SO IT MIGHT JUST BE WORTH THINKING ABOUT IT. I DO AGREE THAT SOMETIMES SMALLER GROUPS IS A GOOD WAY TO AT LEAST START. BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO MANAGE. NOW, CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT ITEM? OKAY. SO I JUST WANT TO SORT OF POINT OUT THAT THE URGENT IMPORTANT GRID IS A PRETTY POPULAR SORT OF FOURFOLD TABLE. AND I TRIED SO SHOW YOU WHERE THE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA, 3, 4, 5, 6, THE TOUGHEST ITEM, URGENT AND POSH. SO, THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR AGENDA WITH RESPECT TO THE AGENDA A BELL AND IT CONNECTS AO TO THE TIMES BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO IN SOME WAY ALLOW MOST TIME FOR ITEM FIVE. LIKE THE TOUGHEST ITEM. WHAT YOU DON'T WANT -- AND SOMETIMES THIS HAPPENS. LIKE, PEOPLE IN SOME MEETINGS DON'T WANT TO GET TO ITEM FIVE. SO THEY WILL USE A TECHNIQUE WHICH I HAVE SERVED IN THE SIXTH GRADE WITH MS. MARTIN WHO RAN A SOMEWHAT LOOSE CLASSROOM AND BEFORE EVERY QUIZ, SHE WOULD SAY, NOW ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE CLASS HAS BEFORE THE QUIZ? AND AT THAT POINT, WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. SHE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN EVOLUTION. SO ONE OF THE KIDS -- DIFFERENT KIDS EACH TIME. THEY WOULD SAY, WELL, MS. MARTIN, CAN YOU SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF MAMMALS AND, OF COURSE, SHE WOULD BEGIN TO TALK. AND THEN WE WOULD ALL BE TAKING COPIOUS NOTES AND WE WOULD BE NODDING AND GIVE EVERY VISUAL SIGNAL THAT WE WERE TOTALLY ENTER AND THIS CAPTURED HER AND GOLLY, WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR THE QUIZ! SO THAT WAS A DELIBERATE AVOIDANCE ON OUR PART AND SOMETIMES YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN MEETINGS WHERE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GET THE ITEMS AND SO THEY EXPAND ON THE OTHER ITEMS TO SORT OF USE UP THE TIME. SO THINKING OF WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT, ITEM FIVE, AND BEING SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME, HOWEVER YOU DO IT. ITEM 15. OKAY. YOU ARE ONE OF THE TYPES OF GROUPS THAT I WORK WITH, WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF REPORT THAT FLOW UP TO YOU, ON ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED, AND BY SOME SUBSET, SOME COMMISSION, SOME COUNCIL GROUP, AND THEN RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PRESENTED TO THE GROUP AS A WHOLE. AND VERY FREQUENTLY, THAT LEADS TO SOME ONE PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION AND THE WAY THAT THE PEOPLE I INTERVIEWED GOT AROUND THAT, I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY CLEVER AND IT GOES BACK SORT OF TO BRAINSTORMING. SO I WILL MAKE THAT CONNECTION NOW AS WELL. SO WHENEVER THEY BROUGHT UP SOMETHING FROM FINANCE OR H.R., OR WHATEVER IT WAS, TO THE BOARD OR TO THE SEA LEVEL TEAM OR WHATEVER, THEY ALWAYS HAD THREE OPTIONS. SO THEY STARTED WITH THE PROBLEM. HERE'S THE PROBLEM. AND WE SEE THREE WAYS THAT WE COULD APPROACH THIS. NOW, THREE HAD A MAGICAL QUALITY TO IT. IF YOU JUST GIVE ONE, WE STUDIED IT AND HERE'S THE SOLUTION THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. IMMEDIATELY CAUSES PEOPLE TO ASK, WELL, DID YOU CONSIDER THIS? DID YOU CONSIDER THAT? WE JUST TELL THEM, THERE'S THREE THINGS, THE MOST PRACTICAL THREE THINGS. IF YOU DO TWO, IT WILL DIVIDE THE GROUP. FOUR, IS SORT OF LIKE TWO ONLY WORSE. AND IF YOU GET FIVE OPTIONS -- IF I GAVE YOU FIVE RESTAURANTS OR FIVE HOUSES TO LOOK AT, YOU ARE IMMEDIATELY GOING TO BEGIN TO GROUP THEM. SO WE GOT TWO JAPANESE RESTAURANTS, A STEAK RESTAURANT AND NO THAI OR WHATEVER IT IS. SO THREE -- PEOPLE CAN KEEP THREE THINGS IN OUR MINDS. ONCE WE GET ABOVE THAT, IT BECOMES A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT AND THEN THEY EXPLAIN THERE'S A, B AND C, WE PICKED B OR IT COULD BE A OR C AND WHY WE DID IT. AND WHAT ARE THE DRAWBACKS TO THE OTHER TWO? AND I DIDN'T PUT THIS IN, BUT A GOOD WAY TO DISCUSS IT, IS SORT OF TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS LIKE THIS. FIRST ONE IS THE LOGIC QUESTION. IS IT LOGICAL? AN YOU WANT TO -- YOU DON'T WANT TO START WITH KICKING AT IT IF YOU POSSIBLY CAN. SO THE SECOND QUESTION IS: WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT? AND THEN YOU DON'T GET TO PROBLEMS UNTIL THE THIRD ONE WHICH IS ARE THERE PROBLEMS IN IT? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF I GIVE MY WIFE A DRAFT OF SOMETHING THAT I'M WRITE, AND SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO SAY, I DON'T LIKE THIS AND I DON'T LIKE THAT, I'M ALREADY IN A BAD MOOD, LIKE RIGHT AWAY. SO I LIKE TO -- I LIKE TO SEE SORT OF WHAT'S THE -- WHAT'S THE OVERALL POSITIVE HERE AND WHERE ARE THE PROBLEMS? AND IF YOU START WITH NEGATIVITY, AND THIS IS OFTEN JUST BY ACCIDENT IT'S NOT THE WAY THAT IT -- I'M NOT SAYING PEOPLE PLAN IT, IT JUST MAY START THAT WAY. TRY TO START WITH POSITIVITY, AND THEN GO TO SORT OF THE SCIENCE. THEN GO TO THE PROBLEMS AND THEN YOU GET TO THE CQI PART. THAT'S THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PART. THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MAKE THAT WILL IMPROVE THE OPTION PROPOSED BEFORE THEM. AND SO YOU MAKE THIS MODIFICATION AND THAT MODIFICATION AND SO IT COMES OUT AND EVERYBODY HAS A CHANCE SORT OF TO -- TO PARTICIPATE. SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. KATHY, I KNOW YOU WERE MENTIONING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TO ME AT AN EARLIER POINT. MAYBE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SHARE OR A PERSPECTIVE ON IT?
00:58:32.564: >> Councilmember Griswold: WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THAT IN POLITICS AND NONPROFIT GROUPS WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVER SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM, TO MAKE IT EASIER THAN REALITY. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT TROUBLES ME. I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SAYING ABOUT THE THREE OPTIONS. I DEFINITELY SUPPORT THAT SO THAT YOU HAVE MORE DISCUSSION. BUT I FEEL LIKE WE SOMETIMES WASTE TIME. BY WE, I DON'T MEAN THE COUNCIL, BUT PEOPLE WOULD DON'T HAVE THE DISCIPLINE OF A FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION SO THAT THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON A PROBLEM, BUT IT'S NOT THE REAL PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
00:59:18.077: >> WELL, DO YOU WANT TO TRY TO -- IF YOU HAVE A FIRE, YOU WANT TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, NOT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE.
00:59:27.753: >> Councilmember Griswold: MM-HMM.
00:59:29.054: >> AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION THAT ADVANCES AND ENHANCES AND IMPROVES THE PROPOSAL. AND SO THIS IS ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN THINK OF SORT OF GETTING TO THAT. AND SOME PEOPLE SAY, WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT IT ADDRESSES SOME ISSUES THAT ARE ON PEOPLE'S MINDS. AND THE -- IT'S SORT OF WORTH THINKING ABOUT. OKAY. NUMBER 15 OR 16. WE ARE ON 15. OKAY. SO COMMON NORMS. SO THEY RESPECTED THE AGENDA, WHATEVER IT WAS THEY RESPECTED THE CLOCK. THE MIND CNOT ENDURE MORE THAN TH SEED. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER COMATOSE ERECTUS. TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE MEETINGS, AT WHATEVER TIME THEY ARE, AND IT'S PREVALENT WHEN THEY ARE IN THE EVENING. IF I HAVE A CLASSROOM, I GOT HOME UNTIL ABOUT TWO. AND THEN BY THREE, PEOPLE'S MINDS START TO WANDER AND THEY CLOSE THE NOTEBOOKS. THAT'S WHY BRAINSTORMING IS AT THE END. IN ANY KIND OF WORK TYPE OF THING AND I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE WHO STARTS WITH EASY WORK IN THE MORNING, SORT OF LET US IN ON THAT. AS YOU GET TOWARDS THE FAN OR THE LATTER THIRD OF ANY EVENT. PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN IS THE NEXT? IS IT GOING TO BE OVER AT TIMES? THERE'S ALL TYPESF THING THAT PELE BEGINO THINK ABO. SO BECAUSE BRAINSTORMING IS LESS STRESSFUL, IT HAS A GREATER ABILITY TO BRING THE GROUP MACK THAN A TYPICAL ITEM AND THEY RESPECTS PEOPLE AND IDEAS. BODY LANGUAGE COUNTED. THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY -- AND THIS CAME UP A LOT OF TIMES. THE EYE ROLL WHEN SOMEBODY IS TALKING. YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN THIS. OR THE SHIELDED VOMIT GESTURE. SO YOU DON'T WANT IF YOU SEE THAT, YOU HAVE TO ASK IF THE PERSON HAS ANYTHING TO SAY AND THEY USUALLY THEY DON'T. SO THESE ARE THE MAIN POINTS. WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT POINT NOW AND IT'S 8:00. WE DON'T HAVE TO GO 45 MORE MINUTES, BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU. AND THIS IS THE POINT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. WHAT ARE YOUR KEY TAKEAY WHATS. I WILL DO THE BEST I CAN TO TO GET TO THE COUNCIL PEOPLE AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY. SO ALI, I DON'T THINK I HEARD FROM YOU.
01:03:26.858: >> City Admin. Crawford: PROFESS OR, IS IT HELPFUL IF I DISCONTINUE SCREEN SHARING SO YOU CAN SEE EVERYONE AT ONCE?
01:03:32.764: >> YES, YOU CAN -- WELL, LET'S LEAVE THIS UP BECAUSE THEY WANT -- WELL, THEY HAVE IT SO YOU CAN LOOK AT IT. YES, WE CAN DO THAT. OH, MANY I GOD. OKAY. SO ALI? ONE THING THAT STRUCK YOU.
01:04:00.425: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, SIR. WELL, A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS AND I THINK AS THE MAYOR HAD MENTIONED THAT RUNNING A PUBLIC MEETING IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN RUNNING A CORPORATE MEETING AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SO MANY OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD USE TO HELP SHORTEN THE LENGTH OF OUR MEETING AND MAKE BETTER DECISIONS, WE CAN'T SUPERIMPOSE ON OUR MEETINGS. AND SO IT'S A UNIQUENESS THAT WE HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH. I DO LIKE, YOU KNOW, HOW IT WAS LAID OUT. I ONLY WISH THAT WE HAD RECEIVED THIS TYPE OF PREJUDICE AS PART OF OUR ORIENTATION TO COUNCIL. SOME OF US HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND SOME A LOT LONGER AND SOME LESS. IF YOU ARE NOT GIVEN THIS INFORMATION AT THE OUTSET, IT TAKES A WHILE TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN?
01:04:59.151: >> IT SURE DOES.
01:05:00.218: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: UNFORTUNATELY, HE WITH DIDN'T GET THIS TYPE OF ONBOARDING EARLY. IT STICKS OUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BRAINSTORMING, I FEEL LIKE BRAINSTORMING WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH A COLLECTIVE BODY, WHO HAVE A GENUINE INTEREST AND TRUST AMONG EACH OTHER. AND SOMETIMES I DON'T FEEL WE DO V THAT. AND TO BRAINSTORM, SOMETIMES THAT HAMPERED AFTER MAKING THE TOUGH DECISIONS, AFTER MAKING SOME CONTENTIOUS VOTES AND MAKING, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW SAYING SO LOW BLOWS ALONG THE WAY, I'M NOT SURE, EVERYONE WANTS TO POINT FINGERS. A LOT OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBES HERE, MANY, MANY PEOPLE ARE CULPABLE OF. AND WE HAVE TO BE WELLING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTS AND CONTROL OUR OWN BEHAVIOR AND NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO PUSH OUR BUTTONS. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN I GO INTO A MEETING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY. I KNOW WHERE I STAND ON THIS ISSUE AND HOW I WILL VOTE HERE AND WHAT TO DO THERE, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY DURING THE COURSE OF DELIBERATIONS THAT SOMETIMES MAKES ME SAY SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS PERHAPS DOESN'T LEAD US TO THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME. IT'S A CHALLENGE. I I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND THE EFFORT AND THE TALENT THAT YOU HAVE AND PUT FORWARD AND THE WISDOM THAT YOU SHARED WITH US TONIGHT. HOPEFULLYWE CAN EMPLOY IT.
01:06:45.757: >> WELL, THANK YOU. ONE THING ABOUT THE BRAINSTORMING, BY WAIT, IS THAT ONE OF THE RULES FOR BRAINSTORMING. THERE'S REALLY NO SERIOUS DISAGREEMENT. IT'S FOR THINGS TO GET OUT, YOU DON'T ARGUE ABOUT STUFF. SO IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, I DON'T WANT TO SAY, WELL, I THINK THAT'S A STUPID IDEA. I WILL JUST SAY, WELL, I MIGHT CTA HE IT DIFFERENTLY OR I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SHARE MY VIEW WITHOUT A1:00ING YOU OR ANYBODY YOU WILL FOR THAT MATTER BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. SO THE WHOLE PURPOSE THE BRAINSTORMING IS TO GET IDEAS OUT IN A SORT OF STRESS-FREE OR MINIMALLY STRESS ATMOSPHERE. YOU GET BETTER IDEAS.
01:07:39.311: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU DEAFENEDLY NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE IN MAKING STATEMENT, BUT YOU GOT TO BE ALSO AWARE THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC MEETINGS WHERE THE IMME MEDIA IS PAYING ATTENTION, AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS PAYING ATTENTION AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS REALLY DOMINANT RIGHT NOW AND THE WAY PEOPLE WORK AND BEHAVE AND SO WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING, YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT THE COUGH FORWARD AND THE SAFETY TO SAY IT. JUST TO SAY SOMETHING BRAINSTORMING, PEOPLE WILL RUN WITH IT. COUNCIL RAMLAWI JUST SAID THIS. DID YOU BELIEVE HOW DUMB HE IS? INCOME PUBLIC SERVICE, YOU ARE CONSTANTLY ATTACKED. CONSTANTLY CRITICIZED AND YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE MAKING COMMENTS LIKE THAT PERHAPS IN A BRAINSTORMING SESSION. I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. I WOULD SAY AS A PROF, I HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO MYSELF. BECAUSE THE MINUTE THE CLASS LEAVES THEY ARE GOING TO SAY, HE SAID THIS. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT! AND SO ON. AND SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF COMMONALTY. I RELATE TO YOUR POINT. LISA, SOMETHING THAT STRUCK YOU WORTH THINKING ABOUT?
01:08:59.291: >> Councilmember Disch: YES, THANK YOU. YOU CAN HEAR ME, RIGHT?
01:09:02.894: >> YES, I CAN.
01:09:04.863: >> Councilmember Disch: OKAY. SO I REALLY LIKED YOUR SENTENCE, KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE DECISION, NOT ON THE PARTICIPATION. I THINK THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE TIME PART, BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A -- I THINK THERE'S SOME WAYS THIS WHICH IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT A COUNCIL MEETING IS A UNIQUE THING AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN HERE AND THAT AREN'T EASILY ADAPTED TO WHAT YOU ARE PRESENTING TO US. HOWEVER -- HOWEVER, I THINK THAT WE COULD SET TIMES FOR OUR AGENDA ITEMS AS ASPIRATIONAL, AND WE COULD KEEP A SURPLUS POT OF MINUTES SO THAT WHEN THINGS TURN OUT TO BE MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE THOUGHT THEY WERE -- BECAUSE THAT'S SOME SOMETIMES WT HAPPENS. FOR ONE THING WHEN WE TURN IN OUR QUESTIONS FOR THE AGENDA ITEMS AND WE GET THE RESPONSES BACK, THERE ARE THINGS I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT WERE COMPLICATED BUT A COLLEAGUE OF MINE FLAGS. AND I THINK OH, WOW, WE WILL NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT AT THE MEETING. I MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT BEFORE. SO WE COULD ASSIGN TIMES FOR THINGS AN A SURPLUS POT OF MINUTES AND VOTE OURSELVES SOME EXTRA MINUTES FOR THE THINGS MORE COMPLICATED BUT WE HAVE PAY GOAL THAT THE MEETINGS SHOULD NOT LAST MORE THAN FOUR HOURS. NO MATTER WHAT WE THINK WE NEED TO DORK OR MAYBE WE COULD SAY FIVE. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT MY ENDURANCE IS NOT AT NIGHT. SO I WOULD LIKE US TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT -- I KNOW THERE ARE PARTS OF THE MEETING WHEN THERE ARE PUBLIC HEARINGS, THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO LIMIT, BUT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LIMIT IF WE SENT THAT IDEA THAT THE FOCUS IS ON OTT DECISION, AND NOT ON THE PARTICIPATION AND WE DON'T ALL HAVE TO SPEAK ALL THE TIME AND REITERATE THINGS AND WENT JUST WANT TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON WHAT SO I NEED TO KNOW AND WHAT I DO I NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IN ORDER NO VOTE ON THIS SUM. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. YOU CAN SQUEEZE THAT IF YOU NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME. AND THE -- SO IT'S SORT OF A BUILT-IN IF GIVES YOU THE BUILT-IN ABILITY TO HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA CACHE OF MINUTES AT THE END IF YOU NEED 'EM. ERICA, SOMETHING THAT STRIKES YOU PARTICULARLY?
01:11:49.928: >> Councilmember Briggs: YEAH, I WAS LOOKING AT THE COMMON NORMS. I THINK WE DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF RESPECTING THE AGENDA. THE CLOCK IS CHALLENGING. I THINK ONE WAY WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS WE RECOGNIZE AS A BODY WHAT WE TEND TO HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS ON. THAT'S OFTEN LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AND SO IF WE FOUND THAT WE HAD A HEAVY AGENDA THAT FOE O FOCUSED ON A F ORDINANCE CHANGES ON THAT, WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK WHAT WE AS COUNCILMEMBERS PUT ON THE AGENDA AND IF THEY MIGHT GO TO ANOTHER AGENDA. THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITY THERE. WITH RESPECT TO RESPECTING PEOPLE AND IDEAS, YOU NOTE THE OBSERVATION THAT BODY LANGUAGE COUNTS. I THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IN THE ZOOM ENVIRONMENT. WE CAN ALL SEE EACH OTHER, AND THE EYE ROLLS. I THINK IF WE ARE BACK IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS -- WHICH I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN YET, BUT I KNOW WHEN I WAS WATCHING THOSE, THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE BODY LANGUAGE AND THAT CAN FRUSTRATE OUR COLLEAGUES.
01:13:26.591: >> IT CAN. JULIE, HOW ABOUT YOU?
01:13:29.160: >> Councilmember Grand: I WAS INITIALLY GOING TO SAY WHAT LISA HAD TO SAY BUT I THINK IT'S RELATED TO THIS IDEA THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT MEETINGS vs. FORUMS AND IF WE WANT TO FOCUS ON DECISIONS, THAT'S A MEETING, AS OPPOSED TO FORUMS WHICH IS DESIGNED AS PRESENTING PERSONAL VIEWS AND SO I REALLY DO LIKE THIS IDEA ABOUT A COLLECTIVE GOAL OF MAKING EYE QUALITY DECISIONS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR OWN PARTICIPATION -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I REALLY STRUGGLE MYSELF. WE DO FEEL -- ANOSMICS WE FEEL REWARDED FOR PARTICIPATING, INSTEAD OF JUST VOTING. AND SOMETIMES IT'S IMPORTANT TO VOTE AS OPPOSED TO PARTICIPATE FOR THE SAKE OF PARTICIPATING. SO I THINK IF WE COULD REFRAME OUR MEETINGS AS REALLY A PLACE WHERE DO THAT, I THINK THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. AND I REALLY LIKED HOW YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU HOW WE DO THINGS TO DELAY WHETHER CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY TRY TO DELAY. WE CAN'T AVOID THE QUIZ. LIKE, THE QUIZ IS STILL THIS AT THE END BUT WE DO IT THEN WITH DETED ENERGY. AND IFE COULD THINK ABOUT SAYING THE QUIZ WIT LIKE OUR FULL BRAIN AND WANTING TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT WOULD ENHANCE OUR PERFORMANCE ON THAT QUIZ EVEN IF WE DON'T WANT TO OKAY THE QUIZ THAT I THINK IF HE BECAME A LITTLE MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT THAT AND -- AND NOW I KNOW I'M TALKING AND TAKING UP SPACE. BUT TAKING UP SPACE SO THAT WE HAVE OUR ENERGY TO GET TO THE HARD PART. I THINK THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL.
01:15:34.452: >> THE LESS ENERGY YOU HAVE FOR THE MORE DIFFICULT ITEMS, THE LONGER IT WILL TAKE. JEN, HOW ABOUT YOU?
01:15:46.064: >> Councilmember Eyer: ACTUALLY ARCHITRAVE IS HAD HIS HAND UP EARLIER. CALL ON HIM AND THEN CIRCLE BACK TO ME.
01:15:54.572: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, JEN. I APPRECIATE THAT. LISA SAID. I THINK HOW CONNECTED SOME OF THE ISSUES ARE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE BODY LANGUAGE AND THE EYE ROLLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, WHICH I THINK MANY OF US -- I WON'T SAY FOR ALL OF US. I HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF AN ERRANT EYE ROLL HERE AND THERE.
01:16:16.828: >> VICE PRESIDENT WE ALL?
01:16:22.200: >> Councilmember Radina:  -- HAVEN'T WE ALL?
01:16:24.168: >> Councilmember Radina: I THINK THEY ARE MORE COMMON THE LATER IN THE EVENING AND THE MORE FIRED AND FRUSTRATED WE ALL ARE. I THINK THAT FEEDS INTO IT. ONE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS, YOU KNOW -- I MENTIONED EARLIER, I THINK SOME OF OUR MEETINGS DO TRY TO KIND OF FOLLOW THAT BELL CURVE, BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WE FIND SOME OF THOSE TOUGH DECISIONS ARE MADE LATER IN THE EVENING AND IT MAKES IT CHALLENGING FOR FOLKS WHEN THERE ARE THOSE DIFFERENCES AND WE CHALLENGE THE NORMS. I THINK ERICA MENTIONED, I THINK, THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SOME OF THAT SOCIALIZING BEFORE AND AFTER A MEETING OR DURING A BREAK.
01:17:20.191: >> NOT UNTIL YOU MEET UNTIL 11:00.
01:17:22.927: >> Councilmember Radina: AND BECAUSE WE ARE ON ZOOM. SO, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE THAT WE SEEP OTHER WEEKLY ON A SCREEN, I HAVEN'T BEEN IN A ROOM WITH IN SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS AND SO YOU MISS OUT ON A LOT OF THAT, HOW IS WAS YOUR WEEKEND? HOW WAS THE FAMILY? WHAT IS GOING ON BEING THE PIECES THAT YOU GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER AND BOND EACH OTHER OUTSIDE OF THE DIFFERENCES AND THE FRUSTRATIONS YOU HAVE AT THE TABLE AND I THINK THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING. BUT THEN I THINK THE BIGGEST PIECE IS JUST THOSE AGREED UPON NORMS. WE MENTIONED A LOT OF THIS TAKES ON A LEVEL OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE WILLING TO HOLD OURSELVES TO A CERTAIN STANDARD AND I GO AGREE, IT CAN BE CHALLENGING WITH OUR RULES WOULD ALLOW EACH AGENDA ITEM TO GO FOR AN OUR H ALLOTTED SPEAKING TIME. NO FOR US TO BE MORE DISCIPLINED ABOUT MEETINGS THAT END EARLIER WOULD REQUIRE US TO CEDE SOME OF OUR OWN POWER TO THE BETTERMENT OF THE BODY, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE AS A BODY TO HAVE TO AGREE ON AND ENFORCE UNOURSELVES. I THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT INDIVIDUAL OPTION AND IT WOULD REQUIRE EACH OF US TO INDIVIDUALLY ACT ON BEHALF OF THE COLLECTIVE AND I THINK THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING AT TIMES WHEN THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS.
01:18:52.049: >> THANK YOU. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT. JEN, LET ME GET TO YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACIOUSNESS.
01:18:59.123: >> Councilmember Eyer: OH, SURE. I WILL BUILD UPON WHAT TRAVIS SAID. I THINK ONE OF THE STICKING POINTS FOR US, IN WHY OUR MEETINGS GO LONG. I THINK HAVE HINTED AT A LITTLE BIT. IS THE PURPOSE OF COUNCIL MEETING FOR EACH ONE OF US TO STATE OUR POSITION AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO VOTE AND WHY ON EVERY ISSUE AND COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE PUBLIC VIA THE COUNCIL MEETING, OR IS IT, YOU KNOW, TO GO IN AND MAKE THE DECISIONS AND THEN DO OUR COMMUNICATION WITH OUR COMMENTS ELSEWHERE? YOU KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TIME THAT IS SPENT WITH COUNCILMEMBERS SPEAKING IS JUST, THAT IT'S JUST, THIS IS WHY I'M VOTING FOR THIS AND HERE ARE MY REASONS. AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE OTHER BIG BULK OF IT IS REALLY WHEN WE HAVE QUESTIONS. WHEN A COUNCILMEMBER HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT SOMETHING, AND WE QUESTION STAFF OR EACH OTHER TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED. BUT MY POINT IN ALL ALL OF THIS IS TO BUILD UPON WHAT TRAVIS WAS SAYING. EACH OF US AS COUNCILMEMBERS, I GUESS, IN ORDER TO HAVE A PETEIMEETING THAT ENDS BEFORE TE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR GOES TO SLEEP, WHICH IS OUR GOAL BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT AFFECT THE PUBLIC. YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERY PERSON TALKING. AND IF COUNCILMEMBERS DOMINATE, THE DISCUSSION, AND THEN IT CREATES THIS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE, WHICH IS MEETINGS GOING BACK INTO THE WEE MORNING HOURS. I'M PUTTING IT BACK ON YOU, DR. TROPMAN, HOW DO WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING, WHERE WE -- YOU KNOW, IF WE HAVE THOSE -- NOT SET TIMES BUT GOALS FOR HOW LONG EACH AGENDA ITEM, YOU KNOW, WE SPEND OWN EACH AGENDA ITEM THAT WE CAN AS COUNCILMEMBERS LOOK AT THAT AND SAY, OKAY, YOU KNOW, THIS ITEM IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I WILL SPEAK ON THIS BUT I AM NOT SPEAK ON THESE OTHER ITEMS BECAUSE IF I SPEAK ON EVERY ITEM, I'M TAKING UP HALF THE TIME WE ALLOTTED ON EACH OF THESE ITEMS.
01:22:05.242: >> WELL, I CAN ANSWER THAT A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S WHERE STRUCTURE COMES IN. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AS PEOPLE POINTED, BUT, YOU KNOW, PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY WITHOUT STRUCTURE IT WILL TURN OUT THAT STRUCTURE FREES YOU. IT DOESN'T CONSTRAIN YOU. BECAUSE ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO, AND YOU HAVE SOME EXTRA MURAL GUIDANCE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE RECIPES. AND THAT'S WHY WE MODIFY THE RECIPES. I WHAT. WANT TO FOLLOW MY OWN RULEHERE E BUSINESS TO DO. LINH, ONE THING THAT STRUCK YOU?
01:22:53.924: >> Councilmember Song: I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW I -- I USED TO WORK IN NONPROFITS AND SIT ON A NUMBER OF BOARDS. I USED TO LEAD A NONPROFIT IN D.C. AND PARTICIPATE IN CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS AND ORGANIZE HUNDREDS OF ADOPTION AGENCIES AND ANTI-TRAFFICKING WORK. SO I HAVE BEEN IN COMPLICATED MEETINGS BUT EVEN WHEN WHEN GROUPS ARE ON EITHER SIDES OF AN ISSUE THAT I WAS PART A WATCH GOING GROUP WE WERE STILL ABLE TO BE PRODUCTIVE WHEN IT CAME TO PASSING LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF CHILDREN. THERE WAS A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHO WE WERE SERVING IF WE WERE COMING AT DIFFERENT ENDS OF ISSUE AND JUST REMINDING OURSELVES WE SERVE A COMMON INTEREST. A LOT OF TIMES WE MY INDIVIDUALLY AND PERSONALLY AND I I THINK CULTURALLY WHEN I THINK BACK TO THAT DIFFICULT WORK THEN IT'S DIFFICULT WORKING WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN, YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT WHAT I SEE HERE LOCALLY. I WATCH SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS AND DIFFERENT CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS. DURHAM, INCO NORTH CAROLINA, STL HAS THE BEST MEETINGS. THERE'S STERLING HEIGHT. AND AND THERE'S NOT GUILTY UNIQUE ABOUT ANN ARBOR. FOR US TO GO SEVEN ARE EIGHT HOURS IT SEEMS REALLY UNFORTUNATE WHERE IF -- I HOPE WE CAN THINK CULTURALLY WHAT WE CAN DO HERE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN DURHAM, THERE'S WAY WAY TO PROFILE -- JUST START POSITIVELY BY INTRODUCING AND THANKING RESIDENTS DURING SOME --IT'S SOMETHING INTERESTING. IT'S NOT JUST TALKING HEADS BUT PEOPLE WHO CARE AND ENGAGE AND CAN VOLUNTEER AND CONTRIBUTE ON THEIR OWN. THEY ARE NOT COMMISSION MEMBERS. THESE ARE NORMAL PEOPLE. STERLING HEIGHTS HAS THEIR CITY MANAGER INTRODUCE SOME REALLY INTERESTING REPORTS IN THE BEGINNING. AND THAT HELPS NO MOTIVATE SOME BRAINSTORMING OUTSIDE OF COMMISSION WORK. I CAME FROM THE LIBRARY BOARD BEFORE THIS. I TRY TO IMAGINE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED HERE. THEY WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AT THE LIBRARY BOARD. WE'RE JUST CULTURALLY VERY DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS BUT WE'RE IN THE SAME CITY.
01:25:44.995: >> I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO THINK THROUGH AND YOU MADE AN INTERESTING POINT ABOUT TAKING SOME TIME TO SEE WHAT OTHER BOARDS DO. ELIZABETH, I DON'T THINK I HAVE GOTTEN TO YOU YET, HAVE I?
01:26:09.019: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I DO A LOT OF LISTENING IN OUR MEETINGS. I THINK THAT'S THE PIECE THAT IS MISSING. I THINK MAYOR TAYLOR MADE THE POINT THAT WE ARE A DIFFERENT ENTITY IN THE DEMOCRATIC AND JUST THE REASON WE EXIST. I TOO HE WILL FEEL LIKE THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN HOW SOME OF US APPROACH THIS I DO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF OUR ROLE IN REPRESENTING GEOGRAPHICALLY DIFFERENT PARTS OF CITY, MEANS THAT WE ARE BRINGING A PERSPECTIVE TO THE TABLE AND SOME OF US FEEL THAT RESPONSIBILITY, AND I DON'T -- I DON'T TEND TO DEVALUE WHAT MY LEAGUES BRING TO THE TABLE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE HEARING THE PERSPECTIVE. WHEN I HEARD THE SAME POINT REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THAT'S TIRESOME AND I TRY NOT TO ADD TO THAT. BUT ULTIMATELY, I DO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE PURPOSE OF OUR MEETINGS IS TO HEAR FROM ONE ANOTHER AND HEAR PERSPECTIVES AND HEAR THEM THE BEST THAT WE CAN. I THINK THAT'S THE TENSION OF WHERE OF WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HER AND WHY THE TIME FRAME IS A CHALLENGE. I GUESS THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
01:27:45.749: >> I VERY FREQUENTLY HEAR PEOPLE SAY, YOU ARE NOT HEANG ME. AND TYESPO YES, I HEAR YO BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU. SO REPEATING IT. HEAR MEANS AGREE TO SOME PEOPLE. WHO VICE PRESIDENT I TOUCHED BASE WITH? JEFF DOWN IN THE CORNER? ONE THING THAT STUCK WITH YOU?
01:28:18.148: >> Councilmember Hayner: ABOUT OUR TIME KEEPING NORMS?
01:28:21.552: >> NO, NO, ANYTHING THAT I SHARED WITH YOU. YOU THINK THIS IS INTERESTING OR I WANT TO MAUL THIS OVER A LITTLE BIT MORE.
01:28:31.762: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I'M GOING TO PASS. I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE NOTION THAT WE AREN'T ALL ALLOWED TO SPEAK ON EVERY TOPIC IF WE CHOOSE TO. I -- YOU KNOW SOME OF US HAVE LIFESTYLES AND J JOBS THAT ALLOW THEM MORE ACCESS, SAY TO COUNCIL BUSINESS DURING THE COURSE OF A DAY OR WEEK THAN OTHERS AND SO IT'S A CHALLENGES AND SOMETIMES THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR SPEAKING TO THE PUBLIC OR SPEAKING TO AN ISSUE ON THE TOPIC IS AT THE COUNCIL MEETING PROPER. AND INDEED OUR RULES SAY THAT ALL DELIBERATIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MADE AT THE TABLE. WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP WITH PREDETERMINED NOTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I LIKE TO LISTEN TO EVERYBODY, AND I WILL PUSH BACK ON THIS IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO SHUT UP TO MAKE OUR MEETINGS GO FASTER. I THINK THAT'S WAY TO QUASH CREATE CYST.
01:29:31.588: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. NOW, WHO IS -- LET ME SAY, TRAVIS, DID I GET YOU TO?
01:29:36.894: >> Councilmember Radina: YOU DID, BUT BUT COUNCILMEMBER GRIS.
01:29:41.999: >> JUST RAISE YOUR HAND.
01:29:44.234: >> OKAY. TWO PEOPLE, KATHY AND THEN THE MAYOR.
01:29:55.279: >> Councilmember Griswold: ONE THING I THAT I REMEMBER, AN ADMIN COMMITTEE MEETING WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PLANNING FOR THIS, YOU SAID THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE TALK MORE WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL HEARD. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, HOW CAN WE MAKE PEOPLE FEEL HEARD? WITH ZOOM AND THE PANDEMIC, IT HAS BEEN VERY HARD BUT THERE'S ALSO OPTIONS FOR COMMUNICATION OUTSIDE OF COUNCIL MEETINGS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY EXPLORE. AND THE OTHER THING ISD. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, MANAGING EXPECTATIONS. I THINK FOUND FROM THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TONIGHT IS THAT THERE ISN'T GENERAL AGREEMENT SORT OF ON THE PURPOSE OF A MEETING, AND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE MEETING. SOME PEOPLE FEEL MORE TALKING AND LESS TALKING. JUST LIKE WHEN YOU SAID YOU GO IN AND TALK TO YOUR DEAN, AT THE END, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN AGREE ON EVERY ISSUE BUT YOU DO HAVE BUT YOU DO HAVE AN EXPECTATION FOR WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND MAYBE APPROACH IT A DIFFERENT WAY AT ANOTHER TIME. MY TAKEAWAY IS THAT IT WILL IMPROVE OUR MEETINGS AND THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE AND COMING ONE A COMMON EXPECTATION FOR WHAT WE WILL DO IN OUR MEETINGS.
01:31:38.348: >> THE COMMENT THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO, MOST GROUPS AS THEY WORK TOGETHER OVER TIME DEVELOP A SORT OF COMMON SORT OF EXPECTATION PARTICIPATION RATIOS AND WHEN PEOPLE EXCEED THOSE FOR WHATEVER REASON, GOOD OR BAD, THE GROUP APPLIED A SORT OF DISCOUNT RATE TO THEM. AND WHEN THEY DO THAT, THEY SENSE THAT AND SPEAK MORE. SO THERE'S A CYCLE THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS GENERATE BUT IT CAN GENERATE AND SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAYOR? OH, YOU CHANGED YOUR PLACE. SO MAYBE I WILL RAP THINGS UP WITH THE MAYOR. I KNOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER AGENDA ITEM AS THAT ADDED. MR. TAKER?
01:32:37.007: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M CHRISTOPHER TODAY.
01:32:48.885: >> EXCELLENCY --
01:32:49.286: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU KNOW, I ONLY INSIST UPON THAT WITH MY CHILDREN.
01:32:53.657: >> I SEE.
01:32:54.291: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU WILL TURN THE FLOOR BACK TO YOU TO WRAP UP, BUT, YOU KNOW, JUST TO THE EXTENT I CAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN AND TALKING WITH US. I THINK I LEARNED A FAIR BIT. I THINK WE EACH HAVE AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND THINK ABOUT THEM IN A PARTICULAR WAY. SOME THINGS I -- YOU KNOW, I THINK COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, FOCUS ON THE DECISION AND NOT THE DISCUSSION. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE'S A BENEFIT TO THAT. PART OF ME SAYS THAT THAT'S TOTALLY WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING. BUT THEN, I THINK I FORGET WHO ELSE SAID THIS, BUT I THINK IT WAS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE. SOMEBODY ELSE SAID THERE ARE MULTIPLE PURPOSES FOR MEETING. MEETING IS AN ART HERE FOR US TO DECIDE TO DO ABOUT A AGENDA X AD IT'S PERFORMATIVE. WE ARE HERE TO SPEAK AND EXPLAIN WHY WE ARE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING AND TO HELP MOVE THE POLITICAL CULTURE ALONG ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, BASED ON OUR HOPES AND DREAMS FOR THE CITY AS A WHOLE. AND SO THOSE THINGS ARE ATTENTION. THIS GETS TO OUR PRESENT VALUE OF HAVING I THINK COUNCILMEMBER MENTIONED, WE PAY ATTENTION TO THE CLOCK WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF RIGOR, BUT THE WAY THE RULES FRAME OUR SPEAKING TIMES IS INCREDIBLY PERMISSIVE IN THE AGGREGATE. AND WITH RESPECT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL QUESTION, WE ARE FAIRLY STRICT. BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR BASICALLY SIX MINUTES ABOUT EVERY SINGLE QUESTION, ABOUT EVERY SINGLE AGENDA. THAT'S EVERY SINGLE AMENDMENT WITHIN AND SO FORTH AND SO, IT IS -- THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF US TO EXTEND MEETINGS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS PRACTICAL. AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY -- YOU KNOW, PERHAPS AS YOU WERE DESCRIBING THE STRUCTURE OF OUR RULES TO MOVE US TO A MORE EFFICIENT PLACE BUT EVEN THAT ASIDE, I THINK EVEN MORE EFFECTIVELY, HAVING OUR OWN SELVES RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR VARIOUS CONSTITUENTS AND WE HAVE VARIOUS ROLES AND INTERESTS BUT WE ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THIS GROUP, AND A MEMBER OF THIS GROUP TRYING TO MAKE SOME KIND OF COLLECTIVE DECISION. I MAY HAVE HEARTFELT OPINIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT COMES ACROSS THE DESK, NOT EVERYBODY BENEFITS FROM ME SAYING SO. YOU KNOW, SOMET SOMETIMES A AYEY IS ALL THAT IS CALLED FOR EVEN IF I'M BURNING INSIDE. I THINK THAT'S A CONTENTION AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH, WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH, YOU KNOW, AN ARTICULATION OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR INDIVIDUAL ROLES AND INDIVIDUAL ROLES THAT WE PLAY IN DEE KEEPING THE MEETG GOING IN ORDER OR WHETHER IT'S A STRUCTURAL CHANGE THAT LIMITS OUR AGGREGATE SPEAKING TIMES IN A WAY THAT NEVERTHELESS HONORED THE FACT THAT WE ARE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND WE HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY WITH THIS.
01:36:42.218: >> WELL, LET ME -- OH, YEAH, TRAVETRAVIS?
01:36:47.157: >> Councilmember Radina: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU DR. TROPMAN. ONE OF THE THINGS, BASED ON THE WAY IT WAS LAID OUT IN THE PRESENTATION WAS A LIMIT ON TIME PER AGENDA ITEM, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW A FEW OTHER CITIES HAVE DONE IS KIND OF A LYMPH TIME ON THE TOTALITY OF THE MEETING WHERE THERE'S A SET END TIME. AND THEN ITEMS THAT ARE NOT FINISHED ARE POSTPONED EITHER TO THE NEXT PETEING OR TO A SPECIAL MEET -- NEXT MEETING OR A SPECIAL MEETING THE NEXT DAY, AND I GUESS I WOULD CHALLENGE US AND MAYBE ASK YOU IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND AS WELL AND THINK ABOUT OTHER ALTERNATIVES SO THAT WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY ABRUPTING ENDING DEBATE BECAUSE WE RAN UP AGAINST A GOAL TIME THAT MAYBE CONFLICTS WITH WHAT WE ARE ALLOWED BUT RATHER THEN FORCES US TO THINK ABOUT OVERALL MEETING EFFICIENCY OR POTENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, SPREADING THIS OUT ACROSS MULTIPLE MEETINGS OR DELAYING ITEMS THAT MAY NOT BE AS PERTINENT TO -- OR MAYBE AS TIMELY. INTO WELL, I CAN JUST SHARE A COUPLE OF REACTIONS WITH YOU. ONE IS THAT THE LENGTH OF TIME -- THIS HAPPENED EARLIER ON IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNCIL, WHEN A MEMBER OF THE LAW SCHOOL FACULTY WAS A DEAN -- WAS THE MAYOR. THEY MET UNTIL 1:00 OR 2:00 IN THE MORNING. AND I -- IT WAS SO LONG AGO, I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW THAT WAS RESOLVED. WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT PRODUCTIVITY DECLINES AS FATIGUE INCREASES. SO JUST AS -- I DON'T HAVE A NECESSARY SOLUTION. MAYBE THAT IS A SOLUTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD WORK FOR YOU GUYS GIVEN YOUR VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES BUT I DO KNOW THE RESULTS. AND THE RESULT IS FATIGUE AND IRRITABILITY AND TAKING LONGER AND SO ON. SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. I THINK IT WAS YOU, BUT MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS VIOLATES THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT. IT DOES SEEM LIKE YOU WOULD BENEFIT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A LITTLE MORE SOCIALIZATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR AGENDA. WERE YOU THE ONE THAT SAID YOU HADN'T BEEN TO ANYBODY'S HOME FOR WHATEVER IT WAS IN NINE MONTHS OR --
01:39:13.136: >> Councilmember Radina: FIVE OF US WERE ELECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND SO WE HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN TO AN IN-PERSON MEETING WITH ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES.
01:39:20.477: >> WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE PANDEMIC CREATED A VERY UNUSUAL SITUATION. BUT THE SUCCESSFUL GROUPS DID FIND WAYS TO HAVE SOCIALIZATION WHERE THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD PERSONAL CONNECTIONS THAT DOESN DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHINGO WITHIN AGENDA ITEM AS SUCH. I DON'T KNOW, CHRISTOPHER, IF THAT WOULD CAUSE PROBLEMS OR HOW THAT WOULD PLAY OUT OR BAT LEGAL IMPLICATIONS. I DO SENSE THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED SOME APARTNESS THAT MAY BE A FACTOR IN THAT ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW PEOPLE AS PEOPLE, AS OPPOSED TO REPRESENTATIVES, YOU KNOW, POSITION THINGS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING NO THINK ABOUT THAT DIDN'T -- SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY COME UP, BUT AS YOU WERE TALKING. BUT DID I MISS ANYBODY? I WANT TO BE SURE I GOT TO EVERYBODY. WELL, IT'S JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE QUARTER OF. SO I WILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. I WILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. THIS HAS BEEN A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME. AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING YOUR MEETINGS IN THE FUTURE, POSSIBLY NOT THE EIRE MEING. T -- HAV WATCHED SOM ALREAD I'M NOT TOTALLY UNAWARE OF A NUMBER OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO CHAT WITH YOU FURTHER AT SOME FUTURE TIME IF THAT WAS APPROPRIATE. SO I WILL LEAVE IT TO TOM TO -- YOU CAN -- TO GET BACK TO ME AND OTHERS OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY IF YOU WISH. BUT I WOULD BE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO CHAT WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR SCHEDULE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND HAVE A GOOD WEEK. DON'T DO ANYTHING I WOULDN'T DO, WHICH GIVES YOU A FAIRLY LARGE RANGE OF OPTIONS AND THANK YOU.
01:41:39.549: >> Mayor Taylor: WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PROFESSOR. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOU BEING HERE WITH US.
01:41:43.653: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU.
01:41:45.121: >> GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY. GOOD LUCK. MAY THE GOOD LORD TAKE A LIKING TO YOU. I FORGET WHO SAID THAT, I THINK IT WAS ARTHUR GODFREY. MAYBE NOT. TAKE CARE.
