00:01:26.212: >> WE DO, MAYOR, AND THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBERS, FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THIS EVENING FOR TWO REASONS. THE FIRST IS THAT MOST OF THE NORMAL THINGS THAT I WOULD TALK ABOUT ARE PRESENTED IN THE ADMINISTRATOR'S UPDATE, WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE AGENDA, SO INSTEAD OF DOING THAT, I'LL TAKE A FEW MINUTES OF YOUR TIME AND RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE A REALLY UNUSUAL EVENT. OUR SYSTEMS PLANNING MANAGER HAS REACHED A CAREER AND LIFE MILESTONE. TOGETHER, WE ARE CELEBRATING HIS ONE THIRD OF A CENTURY SERVICE TO THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. NEXT FRIDAY, WE'LL ALL GATHER AND TOAST, BOAST, AND EVEN ROAST CRESSEN FOR ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAS DONE FOR US OVER THE LAST 33 YEARS, BUT THIS IS REALLY HIS LAST OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH ALL OF YOU, AND WE CERTAINLY -- [ LAUGHTER ].
00:02:20.532: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HE'S ALWAYS WELCOME.
00:02:21.767: >> SOME WOULD SAY THAT IS A PENALTY, BUT WE DID NOT WANT TO LET IT PASS WITHOUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CEREMONY AND CONGRATULATIONS. HE BEGAN HIS WORK IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR 33 YEARS AND ONE DAY AGO IN 1987. HE BECAME THE PLANNING MANAGER FOR THE -- AREA IN 2011. HIS MOST NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS INCLUDE COMPLETING THE STANDARDS SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE CITY, HELPING FORM THE -- HIS REAL IMPACTS HAVE BEEN FELT ON COUNTLESS SMALLER PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES, AND SERVING AS A MODEL OF STRENGTH AND PROFESSIONALISM FOR HIS PEERS, THROUGH BOTH JOYOUS AND STRESSFUL TIMES. I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THEM OVER THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS, ABOUT ONE TENTH OF HIS TIME WITH THE CITY, AND WE'LL CERTAINLY MISS HIS CALM DEMEANOR, EVEN HAND AND HIS DILIGENCE. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO JOIN ME IN RECOGNIZING HIM AS HE COMES UP. [ APPLAUSE ] SO, AS A PLACEHOLDER FOR THE MORE TANGIBLE EXPRESSIONS FOR OUR APPRECIATION, I OFFER YOU A CITY CHALLENGE COIN, AND AS YOU KNOW, CHALLENGE COINS BEGAN IN ROMAN TIMES, WHEN BRAVE WARRIORS LIKE YOU COMPLETED NUMEROUS CHALLENGES. THIS EVENING, THOSE COINS HOLD THE IMAGE OF THE NOBLEMAN WHO ISSUED THE CHALLENGE. INSTEAD OF THAT, WE HAVE THE CITY SEAL. INSTEAD OF THIS BEING MADE OF A PRECIOUS METAL, IT CARRIES THE MORE IMPORTANT MESSAGE OF PUBLIC SERVICE EXCELLENCE, WHICH I HOPE YOU'LL CARRY WITH YOU WHEREVER YOUR ROAD TAKES YOU IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ] THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
00:04:22.788: >> WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WAS VERY SURPRISED AND HUMBLED WHEN I HEARD HOWARD WANTED TO DO THIS, AND I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE SENTIMENT AND THE FEELING AND THE RESPONSE, SO, THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. YOU'RE USED TO ME RAMBLING A LITTLE BIT. I'LL TRY NOT TO RAMBLE TOO MUCH. I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT A LOT ON THE AGENDA. HOWARD OFFERED FOR ME TO STICK AROUND FOR THE WHOLE THING. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL CHOOSE TO DO THAT TONIGHT. I HAVE DONE IT PLENTY OF TIMES. BUT I DO WANT TO JUST EXPRESS, ONE, MY WIFE ACTUALLY GOT A LITTLE UPSET WHEN I ACTUALLY SAID HOW 33 YEARS HERE, ALSO BEING AN ENGINEER AND A NUMBERS PERSON, REALIZED THAT IT IS ACTUALLY 60% OF MY LIFE I HAVE SPENT IN CITY HALL HERE, MOST OF THAT ON THE FOURTH FLOOR. I KNOW PRETTY MUCH EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THE FLOOR OF THAT BUILDING, IF ANYONE NEEDS TO KNOW. GREW UP HERE IN THE CITY, DID ALL OF MY SCHOOL HERE, TRANSFERRED AND GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, NEVER REALLY LEAVING THE COUNTY, AND THEN STARTING HERE AT THE CITY. I REALLY HAVE COME TO REALIZE, ONE, HOW GRATIFYING IT'S BEEN TO PLAY MY PART IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF ROLES HERE AT THE CITY, BUT THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT I HAVE APPRECIATED THE WHOLE VARIETY OF WORK AND CHALLENGES, IS HOW I WOULD PUT IT, BUT JUST HOW SATISFYING AND FRANKLY FULFILLING THE CAREER HAS BEEN, TO HELP IN ANY WAY THAT I COULD ADVANCE THE CITY AS AN ORGANIZATION AND THE COMMUNITY, AND HOPEFULLY TO MOVE IT FORWARD AS BEST AS I COULD. SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE SENTIMENT AND THE VERY KIND WORDS, HOWARD. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. IT'S BEEN GREAT WORKING FOR YOU AND WITH YOU, VERY MUCH WITH YOU, AND FOR AND WITH THE COUNCIL TODAY AND THE PREDECESSORS. SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
00:06:20.105: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:06:27.379: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  SO IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD JUST REMIND YOU, WORDS FROM MY PAST, IS THAT, REMEMBER, THE ROAD GOES ON FOREVER, BUT THE PARTY NEVER ENDS. I WANT TO SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE BIT AND INTRODUCE ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PERSON WORKING WITH THE CITY, AND THAT'S LORI RODDY FROM NEUTRAL ZONE. I GOT TO MEET LORI UNDER LESS THAN FAVORABLE CONDITIONS, BUT OVER THE LAST A COUPLE OF YEARS, A REALLY STRONG RELATIONSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP HAS EMERGED. SEVERAL OF YOU WERE PRESENT AT THE NEUTRAL ZONE LAST YEAR WHEN WE MADE AN AWARD OF A SUSTAINING ANN ARBOR TOGETHER GRANT, AND LORI WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE WITH THE FUTURE CORPS. [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ].
00:07:16.295: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS LORI, AND I SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NEUTRAL ZONE. TODAY, WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU THE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE BUILT WITH THE CITY TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE TRANSITION INTO ADULTHOOD. SO, I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE BRANDON TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROGRAM.
00:07:37.015: >> HELLO, GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS BRANDON MONTGOMERY. I SERVE AS THE OPPORTUNITY COORDINATOR. THE PROGRAM BOTH ASSISTS YOUTH AGE 18-22 IN NAVIGATING A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION THROUGH TO ADULTHOOD IN ORDER TO ENSURE FUTURE STABILITY AND GROWTH. SOME OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR PROGRAM INCLUDE A ROBUST MENTORSHIP PROGRAM, WITH PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING TWO TO THREE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS MENTORS, FOR COMMUNITY SCHOLARSHIPS, AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. SO FAR, YOUTH HAVE TOURED VIRTUALLY EVERY CITY DEPARTMENT. THEY HAVE HAD A BLAST DOING IT. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES THEY WILL HAVE COMING UP. SURPRISINGLY, ONE OF THE BIGGEST HITS WAS THE CITY CLERK'S OFFICE, SO YOU'LL BE GETTING SOME FUTURE HELP, AND THEY WILL BE HAVING INTERVIEW AND HOPEFULLY EMPLOYMENT OFFERS LATER THIS SPRING. I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP TWO STUDENTS TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE.
00:08:50.555: >> MY NAME IS MONEE, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING TO BE HEADED, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT FUTURE CORPS HAD IN STORE FOR ME, BUT EVER SINCE I HAD THE SUPPORT AND LOVE FROM THE CITY AND NEUTRAL ZONE, IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT I'LL HAVE A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE, AND I AM HERE TO STAY. ALSO, I WANTED TO BE A NEWS ANCHOR AND BE INTO MEDIA, SO I'M CROSSING MY FINGERS THAT I GET THE INTERNSHIP WITH CTN. IF NOT, I'LL BE HERE. THAT'S ALL THAT I HAVE TO SAY, GUYS. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:09:23.689: >> HI. NAME IS REGINALD ADOLPH. IN ALL HONESTY, BEFORE I CAME TO THE FUTURE CORPS PROGRAM, I PUT IN JOB APPLICATION AFTER JOB APPLICATION TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND NEVER GOT A SINGLE RESPONSE BACK, AND NOW THAT I AM IN THIS PROGRAM, I HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE CITY, HOPEFULLY GOING INTO THE I.T. AREA OR ASPECT, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. AND I AM REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:09:57.622: >> SO, I THINK HOWARD IS RIGHT. WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION UNDER NOT THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, AND TWO YEARS LATER, WE HAVE LAUNCHED THIS AMAZING PROGRAM, AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK HOWARD. YOU REALLY INITIATED THE VISION OF THIS PROGRAM, AND YOU HAVE HELPED TO REALLY CHAMPION THIS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND BUILD THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE COULD DO THIS, AND THEN I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE CITY COUNCIL KNOWS THAT THE CITY TEAM OF JOHN AND SHERRI AND EVERYBODY ON THE CITY HAVE BEEN AMAZING TO WORK WITH. THEY HAVE GIVEN THEIR ENTHUSIASM, BUT ALSO JUST A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEART AND HAVE OVEREXCEEDED THE EXPECTATIONS THAT I THINK NEUTRAL ZONE HAD IN BUILDING THIS PARTNERSHIP. AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS PROGRAM ALONE. WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION YOUNG PEOPLE INTO ADULTHOOD, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE A TON OF RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WELL, SO IT IS THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY THAT HAS REALLY GLUED THIS TO HAPPEN. WE HAVE WCC ON BOARD, ANN ARBOR TRANSIT AUTHORITY, MICHIGAN WORKS. EVEN WIRELESS ZONE GIVES EVERYBODY A FREE CELL PHONE AND PAYS THEIR DATA PLAN. FUNDERS ARE JUMPING ON BOARD, TOYOTA, AT&T, DOMINOS AND MORE WILL FOLLOW. SO YOU HAVE REALLY CREATED A SPACE WHERE TWO YEARS AGO, HONESTLY, I AM NOT SURE MANY OF OUR BLACK YOUTH FELT LIKE THEY BELONGED IN THE CITY, AND YOU HAVE REALLY CREATED A WARM, SUPPORTIVE, INVITING SPACE, WHERE THEY HAVE A PLATFORM TO BE SUCCESSFUL, AND I HOPE THAT YOU SEE THAT. I THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF THE PARTNERSHIP, AND I ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO OFFER ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT IN THE FUTURE. SO THANKS. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:11:42.894: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, WHICH IS A OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF INTEREST. TO SPEAK, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME, AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS MOZHGAN SAABIESFAHNI.
00:12:19.898: >> HELLO, ANN ARBOR. I AM HERE TO REPORT TO YOU THAT ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, ON JANUARY 17TH, THERE WAS A BIG MEETING WITH E.P.A. REPRESENTATIVES, E.E.G.L. REPRESENTATIVES, AND CITY OF ANN ARBOR COUNCIL PEOPLE AND THE MAYOR TALKING ABOUT GELMAN DIOXANE CONTAMINATION AND HOW TO CLEAN IT UP, AND THE PROPOSAL THAT THE CITY COUNCIL IS PUTTING ON THE TABLE IS THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO PUT THIS SITE ON THE SUPERFUND LIST AND EVENTUALLY FORCE THE E.P.A. TO CLEAN IT UP. NOW, THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE E.A., THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, REGION 5, CLEARLY SAID TO US THAT FOR A FEASIBILITY STUDY, BEFORE ANY COMMITMENT IS MADE TO CLEAN UP THIS POLLUTION, IT COULD TAKE DECADES, UP TO 30 YEARS, IT COULD TAKE. SO, TO ME, WHAT THAT SAYS IS THAT THE E.P.A. IS TELLING US DO SOMETHING ELSE, BECAUSE IF YOU GO BY US, IT WILL TAKE YOU 30 YEARS. THAT'S AS LONG AS WE HAVE WAITED. SO, TO ME, WE SHOULD ABANDON THAT THOUGHT AND DO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. JUST TO LOOK BUSY DOESN'T HELP. I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN BUSY FOR 30 YEARS, BUT THE RESULT IS THAT THIS PLUME IS THE LARGEST IT'S EVER BEEN, SO WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH IS CLEARLY NOT THE WAY TO GO. MY SUGGESTION IS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD CLEAN UP THIS DIOXANE CONTAMINATION OF OUR WATERS. MY SUGGESTION IS THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL SHOULD DO ITS BEST TO SHUT DOWN THE MANUFACTURERS WHICH ARE POLLUTING OUR WATERS WITH P.F.A.S.  THE ATTITUDE OR POSTURE OF, YES, LET'S DRAG THIS ALONG, IT CONTAMINATES OUR WATER WITH ALL KINDS OF STUFF, AND IT WILL FORCE THE CHILDREN IN THIS TOWN TO BE DRINKING UNHEALTHY WATERS. I ASSURE YOU, IF YOU ASK THE PUBLIC, DO YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO DRINK CLEAN WATER, THEY WILL SAY YES. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, BECAUSE THEY FIGURE SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED IN 30 YEARS, BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. IT HAS ONLY GROWN. SO I AM SAYING, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, AND -- IF YOU DON'T GET THE JOB DONE, HOW DO YOU EXPECT US TO RESPECT YOU? I HAVE NO RESPECT. EARN MY RESPECT. CLEAN IT UP. PLEASE CLEAN IT UP. SHOVELS IN THE GROUND, CLEAN IT UP. I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. YOUR JOB IS TO CLEAN IT UP, NOT TO TELL US LET THE E.P.A. CLEAN IT. THE E.P.A. CURRENTLY DOES NOT EVEN BELIEVE THAT THERE IS GLOBAL WARMING. THE E.P.A. CURRENTLY SAYS P.F.A.S. CAN'T -- WE CAN'T PUT IT ON THE LIST OF HAZARDOUS COMPOUNDS. P.F.A.S. HAS BEEN BANNED IN SO MANY COUNTRIES. IT IS A COMPOUND THAT ENTERS THE FETUS AND WRECKS THE SIGNALING PATHWAYS. WE CAN'T PUT OUR TRUST IN THE E.P.A. OR FEDERAL AGENCIES. FOR 30 YEARS, THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING, AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO NOTHING. CLEAN IT UP NOW!
00:15:28.386: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID HALMAN.
00:15:36.761: >> THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, COUNCIL. RESPECTFULLY, LET ME THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. THIS IS NOT MY FIRST TIME. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT I THINK KIND OF PLAYS INTO MY SITUATION RIGHT NOW. A PERSON GOES INTO THEIR BANK AND SITS DOWN WITH A LOAN OFFICER, AND THEY FILL OUT A LOAN APPLICATION. THE LOAN OFFICER SAYS, JEEZ, THIS LOOKS REALLY GOOD. I DON'T THINK THERE'LL BE ANY PROBLEM. THEY LEAVE THE BANK. THE LOAN OFFICER TURNS IT OVER, SCORES IT, PULLS THEIR CREDIT RECORD, SAYS IT DOESN'T MEET OUR GUIDELINES. SO THE NEXT DAY, THEY GET A PHONE CALL. THE LOAN OFFICER DIDN'T TURN THEM DOWN. "I'M SORRY, I FOUGHT REAL HARD FOR YOU, BUT THE LOAN COMMITTEE SAID NO." WHO IS THE LOAN COMMITTEE? WHAT I'M GETTING FROM THE CITY, MY CLAIM IS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN SAYS WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE LIABILITY, SO MIGHT AS WELL BE THE LOAN COMMITTEE. IT'S THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. I WOULD LIKE A REASON, IF WE ARE GOING TO TURN THIS DOWN, WHAT IS THE REASON? I HEARD THE WORDS AT THE LAST MEETING CAUSE AND EFFECT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN SOME ENGINEERING DONE. WHAT'S THE ENGINEERING? I DON'T KNOW. I'M THE CLAIMANT. NOBODY HAD TOLD ME OUR ENGINEER CAME THROUGH AND LOOKED AND DID THIS OR DID THAT. IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO LIVE IN A CITY THAT IS KNOWN FOR, AT TIMES, A TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT WHEN YOU'RE ONLY GETTING NON-TRANSPARENCIES. SO, I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THIS LATER, AND I WOULD HOPE, IF THERE'S ENGINEERING, THAT THERE IS AN ENGINEER INVOLVED GIVING US INFORMATION, AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE ARE JUST CITIZENS OF THIS COMMUNITY, AND I ASK YOU ALL TO STOP AND THINK:  IF YOU WERE IN OUR POSITION, WHERE WOULD YOU BE? AND THEN VOTE FOR WHAT'S RIGHT, NOT WHAT'S POLITICALLY CORRECT. VOTE FOR THE RIGHT THING. THANK YOU.
00:18:00.905: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ANDREA W WOTAN.
00:18:10.949: >> HELLO. SAVING OUR PLANET NEEDS TO BE THE WORLD'S TOP PRIORITY RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE MATTERS IF WE AND OUR CHILDREN ARE LIVING ON A DEAD PLANET, AND WE ARE ALREADY WITNESSING THE DEVASTATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I AM HERE TO ASK CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND HOWARD LAZARUS TO ADD A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. THAT IS THE CARBON IMPACT OF OUR MEAT AND DAIRY CONSUMPTION. WE, THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR, MUST CUT DOWN ON MEAT AND DAIRY IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT SAVING THE PLANET. WHATEVER OTHER STEPS WE TAKE, WE'LL LIKELY LOSE THIS PLANET IF WE DON'T REIGN IN OUR COLLECTIVE DEMAND FOR MEAT AND DAIRY IMMEDIATELY. THIS IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THIS IS A PART OF THE LEADING PRODUCER OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AT 14.5%, THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY IS ALREADY THE WORLD'S SECOND LEADING PRODUCER OF GREENHOUSE GASES, EQUAL TO THE ENTIRE GLOBAL TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. THIS IS CATASTROPHIC FOR THE PLANET, BECAUSE THE TWO PRIMARY GREENHOUSE GASES PRODUCED BY THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY ARE METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE, EACH OF WHICH TRAPS EXPONENTIALLY MORE HEAT IN OUR ATMOSPHERE THAN DOES CARBON DIOXIDE. NITROUS OXIDE TRAPS ABOUT 282 TIMES MORE HEAT OVER A 100-YEAR TIME FRAME. BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, OVER JUST 20 YEARS, METHANE TRAPS 86 TIMES MORE HEAT THAN CARBON DIOXIDE, AND 20 YEARS FROM NOW, MAYBE MORE TIME THAN OUR EARTH EVEN HAS LEFT. IT IS URGENT THAT WE IMMEDIATELY CUT THESE GASSES, BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING MONUMENTALLY MORE HARM TO THE PLANET RIGHT NOW THAN CARBON DIOXIDE. ACCORDING TO THE E.P.A., THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY IS THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF METHANE. SO WHAT DO WE DO? FIRST, WE ALL STRIVE TO CUT OUR OWN CONSUMPTION OF MEAT AND DAIRY BUT AT LEAST 50% STARTING NOW. THE STRATEGY WORKS. BETWEEN 2005 AND 2014, AMERICANS DECREASED THEIR BEEF CONSUMPTION BY 19%, WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO TAKING 57 MILLION CARS OFF THE ROAD FOR ONE YEAR. IF EVERY AMERICAN EVEN CUT JUST ONE HAMBURGER A WEEK FROM THEIR DIET, WE COULD CUT EMISSIONS AS MUCH AS TAKING ABOUT 10 MILLION CARS OFF THE ROAD EACH YEAR. SECOND, PUBLIC POLICY, THERE'S LOTS OF PRECEDENT NOW FOR PUBLIC POLICY TO REDUCE MEAT AND DAIRY CONSUMPTION FOR SUSTAINABILITY REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN APRIL 2019, NEW YORK CITY'S MAYOR ANNOUNCED THE GREEN NEW DEAL FOR THE CITY, INCLUDING A PLAN TO PHASE OUT PURCHASES OF PROCESSED MEAT AND REDUCE BEEF PURCHASES BY 50% BY 2024. ANN ARBOR IS A SMART PLACE. WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS AND DERIVE A CARBON VALUE TO TOO MUCH THOSE CHANGES FOR THE A2 ZERO PLAN. LET'S MAKE HISTORY. THANK YOU.
00:21:18.503: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HENRY HERSKOVITZ.
00:21:26.744: >> GOOD EVENING. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COMMENTS MADE HERE DURING COMMENTS FROM COUNCIL ON JANUARY 6TH BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. I WAS GOING TO ADDRESS THE POINTS HE RAISED, BUT OUTSIDE OF CALLING ME NAMES, HE ADDRESSED NONE OF THE ITEMS I BROUGHT TO COUNCIL'S ATTENTION WHILE DESCRIBING THE REASONS WE SELECTED BETH ISRAEL CONGREGATION AS THE PROPER VENUE FOR PROTEST AGAINST THE JEWISH STATE. DID HE QUESTION THE CLAIM THAT BETH ISRAEL FLIES A FOREIGN FLAG IN THEIR SANCTUARY? NO. DID HE QUESTION THE CLAIM THAT A PRAYER IS SAID TO THAT FOREIGN COUNTRY AS PART OF THE WEEKLY PRAYER SERVICES? NO. DID HE COUNTER THE CLAIM THAT LOCAL CHURCHES POST WELCOMING TO ALL SIGNS OUTSIDE THEIR BUILDINGS, WHERE BETH ISRAEL POSTS NONE? NO. DID HE COUNTER THE CLAIM THAT MOST JEWISH HOLIDAYS PORTRAY JEWS AS VICTIMS IN AN ALLEGED HOSTILE WORLD? AGAIN, NO. WHAT HE DID DO WAS CALL ME A RACIST, AND I THINK THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM FOR SUCH BEHAVIOR IS LABELED PROJECTION. HE IS PROJECTING ON ME HIS SUPPORT FOR THE FOUNDING IDEOLOGY OF ZIONISM, WHICH WAS DETERMINED TO BE A FORM OF RACISM BY THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN 1975, AND THAT BODY NEVER DETERMINED OTHERWISE. ALLOW ME TO EXPOSE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, OR, MORE CORRECTLY, ALLOW THE FORMER ISRAELI MINISTER OF EDUCATION TO DO SO. ON THE TELEVISION SHOW DEMOCRACY NOW, SHE WAS ASKED BY AMY GOODMAN, OFTEN, WHEN THERE IS DISSENT EXPRESSED BY THE UNITED STATES AGAINST THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE ARE CALLED ANTI- ANTI-SEMITIC? THEY RESPONDED, WELL, IT'S A TRICK. WE ALWAYS USE IT. WHEN IN THIS COUNTRY PEOPLE ARE CRITICIZING ISRAEL, THEN THEY ARE ANTI-SEMITIC, A TRICK, THE SAME TRICK BEING PULLED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. MY ADVICE FOR COUNCIL AND ALL FOLKS PRESENT IS NOT TO FALL FOR IT. THANK YOU.
00:23:52.757: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SADIRA CLARKE.
00:24:04.769: >> HI. I'M SADIRA. I LIVE ON THE CORNER OF PONTIAC AND BARTON TRAIL. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE REMOVAL OF PARKING FROM BARTON DRIVE. THIS IS A PRETTY SMALL CHANGE. WE SEE ACCIDENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY ON THIS CORNER. WE ARE ONE HOUSE AWAY, SO I KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS ON BARTON DRIVE HAVE SPOKEN OUT QUITE VOCALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE PARKING. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CONTEXT THAT THERE'S ONLY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE SPACES IN THAT AREA, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE. IT'S HARD TO TELL, BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY NEVER IN USE. THERE'S, IF ANYTHING, MAYBE ONE CAR THERE. NOW, THIS KIND OF CREATES A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION FOR EVERYBODY IN THE AREA, WHERE IF THERE'S NO CAR THERE, IT'S A WIDE-OPEN SPACE, AND PEOPLE KIND OF MAKE UP THEIR OWN RULES. EVEN WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, I WAS NOT SURE IF THERE WAS LIKE A TURN LANE OR WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT WAS THIS HUGE, WIDE-OPEN INTERSECTION, AND NOW WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR ENGINEERS, WHO HAVE PUT FORTH A GOOD PLAN TO HAVE TWO LANES AND TWO-CYCLE LANES. THIS IS FAR PREFERABLE TO THE ALTERNATIVE, WHICH IS THEY ARE CONSIDERING PUTTING IN A TURNING LANE THERE, AND A TURNING LANE, WE'D NEED TO CONSIDER IT ADDS AN EXTRA LANE FOR PEDESTRIANS TO HAVE TO WALK ACROSS, AND ESPECIALLY THIS IS LIKE A BLOCK AWAY FROM A SCHOOL, WHICH IT ATTRACTS PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE CITY. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WALKING. SO, HAVING THAT EXTRA LANE THERE, IF THERE'S A TURN LANE IN THE MIDDLE AND A LANE GOING EACH DIRECTION IS A BIT PROBLEMATIC, BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THREE CARS INSTEAD OF TWO. FURTHER, THE BIKE LANES ARE KIND OF A GOOD OPPORTUNITY AT A LOW COST WITH A GOOD IMPACT. THERE'S A BIKE LANE GOING THE REST OF THE WAY DOWN BARTON, IS THIS IS -- WILL ADD A LOT OF CONTINUITY TO THE REST OF THE WORLD, AND AS WELL AS THAT, THE REST OF THE ROADS IN ANN ARBOR WERE KIND OF MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION, WHERE THE MAIN LARGER ROADS, LIKE BARTON, ARE HAVING PARKING KIND OF REMOVED, WHICH INTERSECTIONS, WHICH IS -- SORRY I'M DISORGANIZED WITH MY THOUGHTS, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF VISUAL CLUTTER LEADING UP TO INTERSECTIONS, AND ESPECIALLY COMING OFF THE HIGHWAY, IT'S THE FIRST INTERSECTION WITH THE FIRST LIGHT UNTIL YOU GET TO THE SCHOOL, SO IT'S A REALLY SHORT DISTANCE TO ADJUST DRIVER BEHAVIOR, AND EVERY CUE THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY GET, AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAID THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH USING BIKE LANES AS A TRAFFIC COMBING, I THINK THAT'S NOT A CORRECT WAY TO CHARACTERIZE IT. IT'S RATHER A VISUAL CUE, A WAY TO PUT OUT A WATCH OUT FOR PEDESTRIANS AND OTHER ROAD USERS SIGN THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE ROAD. FURTHERMORE, THERE'S A BOARD WALK. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU CAN JUST USE THE BOARD WALK, BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THE BOARD WALK DOESN'T CONNECT TO THE BIKE LANE. THE BIKE LANE ENDS, THERE'S A GAP WITH REALLY WIDE ROAD WHERE THERE'S CARS PARKED THERE SOMETIMES. THIS WOULD MAKE A NICE CONTINUOUS LANE WHICH GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE BOARD WALK WHICH IS PROTECTED DOWN TO THE PARK, ALL THE WAY TO THE BARTON HILL. THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS, AND WE SHOULD GO WITH IT.
00:27:14.058: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ABU IBRAHIM. ABU IBRAHIM. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MATTHEW CATANZARITE.
00:27:35.146: >> ALL RIGHT, HELLO, EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS MATTHEW CATANZARITE, AND I'M A BOARD MEMBER ON BWBC, HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF BIKE LANES ON BARTON DRIVE. OUR CULTURE MADE DRIVING A UNIVERSAL ACTIVITY, BUT THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHO NEVER OR RARELY DRIVE. 32% OF AMERICANS DO NOT EVEN HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE. THIS INCLUDES CHILDREN, THOSE WITHOUT ACCESS TO A CAR, AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THAT PRECLUDES DRIVING. EVEN AMONG LICENSED DRIVERS, THERE ARE RARELY MANY WHO NEVER DRIVE. WE HAVE BUILT THE CITY, UNFORTUNATELY, WHERE YOU ALMOST NEED A CAR TO FUNCTION WITH ANY SORT OF CONVENIENCE OR DIGNITY. AS WE CONTINUE TO SMOOTH OUT OUR STREETS, WE HAVE MADE PLACES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DRIVE AND SLOW SPEEDS. THE POSTED SPEED ALONG BARTON DRIVE IS 25 MILES AN HOUR. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE SLOWEST SPEED, AS SLOW AS ANY NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, 25 MILES AN HOUR. REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT IS SAFETY. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF PARKING, CONSIDERING THE RESIDENCES ALONG THAT ROAD WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE REMOVAL OF PARKING SPACES. CURRENTLY, THE CRASHES ALONG THIS CORRIDOR ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF SPEEDING. THERE ARE OVER 7,000 VEHICLES A DAY ON AVERAGE TRAVELING DOWN THIS ROAD. THE KEY TO MAKING OUR STREET SAFER IS TO KEEP AUTOMOBILES AT A REASONABLE DISTANCE, A REASONABLE SPEED, AND A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS. BIKE LANES ARE A GREAT WAY TO SLOW CARS DOWN, BY USING UP THE EXCESS ROAD WIDTH DEDICATED TO OVERSIZED DRIVING LANES. WHEN PROPERLY IF I DID, THEY MAKE IT SAFER FOR PEOPLE WALKING, DRIVING, AND RIDING, BY TING A VISIBLE BUFFER WITH A GAP BETWEEN THOSE BIKING, WALKING, AND DRIVING. THOSE WHO OPPOSE THIS CITE -- BUT NOTHING MORE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION THAN REPAVING THE ROADS, NONE OF THE CRASHES OR DANGERS WILL BE ADDRESSED. AS IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE, THIS IS PART OF THE PLAN THAT'S GOING ON. PLANNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS ALIKE SEE BIKE LANES AS A TOOL TO REDUCE RISKS AND COSTS. A2 ZERO FOUND, AGAIN, WITH 7,000 DAILY CARS TRAVELING THROUGH THIS CORRIDOR, IT'S GOING TO BALANCE IT OUT IF WE ALLOW CYCLERS AND OTHERS TO SHARE THE ROAD. CURRENTLY, THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF BARTON ON THE CITY'S BIKE MAP, RIGHT HERE, I BROUGHT FOR REFERENCE, IS LISTED AS A SIGNED NEIGHBORHOOD CONNECTING ROUTE. ADDITIONALLY, A HEAT MAP DOES IDENTIFY THE --
00:30:47.871: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
00:30:48.472: >> UH-HUH, ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
00:30:50.474: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS TOM STULBERG.
00:31:01.018: >> GOOD EVENING, TOM STULBERG, 120 TRAVER STREET. FOR THE NEW YEAR, I WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW, SO I BORROWED MY DOG'S TOYS. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE GREATEST LOSS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT ANN ARBOR HAS SEEN, AND THIS IS AT LOWER TOWN, WHICH IS THE BIGGEST PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT SINCE BRIARWOOD, ACCORDING TO THE DEVELOPER HIMSELF. THERE'S SOME INDISPUTABLE FACTS. THE LOWER TOWN SITE WAS MASTER PLANNED FOR A P.U.D.  IT WAS ZONED FOR A P.U.D., AND THE EXACT PLAN THAT WAS APPROVED BY THIS BOARD, THIS BODY, 7-4 COULD HAVE BEEN APPROVED AS A P.U.D., BUT IT WASN'T. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. LEGALLY, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, BUT IT WASN'T. IT WAS DONE WITH A VERY CONVOLUTED WAY INSTEAD. SO I'M GOING TO USE THESE PIGS TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS THE MORNINGSIDE PLAN, APPROVED AS A P.U.D., NOT THE OLD EXPIRED PLAN, THE MORNINGSIDE PLAN. WHAT WE DID INSTEAD WAS TAKE AND REZONE THAT SITE TO C1AR, WHICH IS AN OBSCURE ZONING CATEGORY, CAMPUS BUSINESS. IT DIDN'T BELONG HERE. THE ONLY REASON IT WAS USED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HADN'T BEEN USED IN 50 YEARS WAS IT WAS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE OF MIXED USE CAPABILITY. TWO OF THE THREE LOTS AT THE MORNINGSIDE SITE HAVE ZERO MIXED USE. THE ENTIRE SITE HAS LESS THAN 1%, BUT TWO OF THE LOTS HAVE ZERO WHATSOEVER. THIS IS RECOGNIZED BY THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT THAT THIS IS REALLY A RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH AN ACCESSORY COMMERCIAL USE, AND WHAT THAT DID WAS ALLOW HIGHER DENSITY OF RESIDENTIAL AND LESS SETBACKS, LESS PARKING. SO WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO, IN ORDER TO MAKE THE C1AR WORK, WAS ALSO ADD ON A PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION TO FURTHER REDUCE THE SETBACKS, SUPPOSEDLY TO ACTIVATE RETAIL ON THE STREET, BUT, REMEMBER, THERE'S NO RETAIL. WE ALSO NEEDED MORE, SO WE GIVE THEM ANOTHER VARIANCE, WHICH IS A ZBA PARKING VARIANCE. THE SHAME OF IT REALLY IS WE HAD A GREAT MASTER PLAN. TO TOP ALL THINGS OFF, WE ADDED CONDITIONAL ZONING TO TIE THE SITE PLAN TO THE ZONING, WHICH IS A P.U.D. SO WHAT DO WE HAVE? WE HAVE THE P.U.D., AS APPROVED, MORNINGSIDE SITE PLAN, IF IT HAD BEEN AN APPROVED P.U.D. THE CONVOLUTED WAY THAT WE GOT AROUND TO APPROVING IT -- THIS ONE HAD 10,000 AFFORDABLE UNITS ON SITE, AND THIS ONE HAD NONE. THAT WILL BE ALL PIG. THAT WILL BE ALL.
00:33:59.730: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HEIDI POSHER.
00:34:03.167: >> GOOD EVENING. ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY AND MY EMPLOYEES, I WANT TO CORRECT A STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE BY A COUNCILMEMBER AT THE LAST MEETING. TO BE CLEAR, PRENTICE PARTNERS IS NOT BUILDING A 65-UNIT AIRBNB COMPLEX AT 830-HENRY. THIS PROJECT WAS PROPOSED AS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A WORKFORCE HOUSING COMPLEX FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABILITY, WHICH INCLUDES SOLAR, E.V. CHARGING AND SHARED MOBILITY. ALSO, WHILE I'M ON THE SUBJECT OF THE LAST MEETING, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY OPINION THAT CALLING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE BEEN -- THAT HAVE MADE THE CHOICE TO INVEST IN REAL ESTATE UNBRIDLED CAPITALISTS IS WAY OUT OF LINE. UNBRIDLED CAPITALISM IS A TERM THAT REALLY CONJURES UP HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SELLING BLOOD DIAMONDS. I THINK IN GENERAL IT'S NOT A TERM THAT'S APPLICABLE TO A SMALL EFFORT TO BUY LOCAL REAL ESTATE, AND I DON'T THINK IT APPLIES TO ANY BUSINESS MODEL RELATED TO S.T.R.s IN THIS TOWN. IT'S JUST NOT TENABLE, SO I THINK THAT WAS WAY OUT OF LINE. JUST TO PAINT A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SOME OF THESE S.T.R.s, I HAVE ACTUALLY ASKED ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES TO DISTRIBUTE A FLIER THAT I THINK WILL HELP PEOPLE BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WE MANAGE OUR PROPERTIES AND REALLY WHO BENEFITS FROM THEM, AND I'LL MAKE SURE WE HAVE A LINK ON OUR WEBSITE TO -- IF ANYBODY ELSE DIDN'T HAVE THE CHANCE TO LOOK AT A FLIER WANTS TO GO ONLINE AND SEE IT. LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A HOT BUTTON ISSUE, AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF UPCOMING DISCUSSION, THAT THERE WILL BE, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT COUNCIL AND THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONSIDER WHAT I KNOW WILL BE AN AVALANCHE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT DATA THAT'S COMING YOUR WAY ABOUT THIS. BUT HERE'S THE HARD TRUTH, AS I SEE IT:  THE HOUSING NEEDS OF THIS COMMUNITY ARE NOT GOING TO BE CORRECTED WITH A RANDOM BOTTOM-UP SWIPE AT A BIG FIX. I JUST BUILT A HOUSE ON BROOKLYN, WHICH IS A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S VERY MIXED IN TERMS OF THE USAGE. THERE'S DUPLEXES. THERE'S A NURSERY SCHOOL. THERE'S SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING. THE VERY FIRST SATURDAY THAT I ACTUALLY STAYED THERE, I WOKE UP TO THE SOUND OF BEER PONG FROM A RENTAL HOUSE TWO YARDS AWAY. SO, IF I PESTERED THE CITY ADMINISTRATION EVERY DAY, WOULD THEY START DRAWING THE LINES AROUND WHERE LONG-TERM RENTALS ARE ALLOWED? IT'S A FAIR QUESTION. I EMPLOY RESIDENTS AT A HALFWAY HOUSE THAT'S VERY NEAR TWO OF OUR PROPERTIES, AND, YOU KNOW, BY DEFINITION, PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN A HALFWAY HOUSE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE SHORT TERM. IT'S A SUCCESS FOR THEM. SO, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WHEN THIS LEGISLATION PASSES? ARE WE GOING TO KICK THEM OUT? ARE WE GOING TO SHUT DOWN THEIR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY? I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD THING FOR PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEED IT. I HAVE WRITTEN TO A LOT OF YOU ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND MADE THIS REQUEST. PLEASE BE LEADERS.
00:37:11.722: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
00:37:12.556: >> PLEASE DO SOME REAL PLANNING AROUND HOUSING, AND PLEASE DO SOME REAL PLANNING AROUND ZONING. IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED. THANK YOU.
00:37:18.662: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
00:37:19.596: >> THANK YOU.
00:37:20.564: >> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GRANT SHAFER.
00:37:23.300: >> GOOD EVENING. I DON'T USUALLY SAY ANYTHING NICE, BUT I THANK MR. LAZARUS AND ANYONE ELSE WHO SUPPORTS THE NEUTRAL ZONE. IT'S A WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION. ANYWAY, THE HISTORY OF THE DEER CULL SHOWS THAT IT IS THE BRAINCHILD OF A FEW RESIDENTS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND WARDS WHOSE LANDSCAPING WAS IMPACTED BY DEER. RATHER THAN DEAL WITH DEER THEMSELVES, A POLITICALLY CONNECTED GROUP HIJACKED THE GOVERNMENT AS THEIR PEST CONTROL CONTRACTOR. HILLARY HANDWERGER AND TWO OTHERS DID NOT WANT TO INSTALL FENCES AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE. ONE ADDED THAT THE CITY SHOULD KILL DEER TO RELIEVE HOMEOWNERS OF THE PROBLEM. THE STRATEGY WAS THEN PROMOTED AS A MEANS OF PROTECTING CITY PARKS. SOME COUNCILMEMBERS WERE RECRUITED FOR THE AGRICULTURAL COUP D'ETAT. IT WAS REPORTED TO COUNCIL ON 14, AUGUST 2014, THAT THERE WAS NO DEER DAMAGE IN CITY PARKS OR GOLF COURSES BUT ADVISED AGAINST PUBLICIZING DEER NUMBERS, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT JUSTIFY A PULL. THE THEN DIRECTOR OF WASHTENAW PARKS AND RECREATION AGREED. ANOTHER CULL PROPONENT ADMITTED THAT THE DEER COUNT WAS KNOWN TO BE LOW. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND HAS APPROPRIATELY SKEPTICAL ABOUT CULLS, BECAUSE A FEW -- BECAUSE FEW NEIGHBORHOODS WERE AFFECTED AND FEW THIRD WARD RESIDENTS COMPLAINED ABOUT DEER. ANOTHER COUNCILMEMBER WAS MORE SKEPTICAL. ON 15 AUGUST, 2015, SHE TOLD A CONSTITUENT THAT A CULL RESTRICTED TO ANN ARBOR DID NOT MAKE SENSE. CITY STAFF DID NOT LOOK HARD FOR NONLETHAL ALTERNATIVES. THE CULL WAS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION, AND ANOTHER COUNCILMEMBER, PRESUMABLY MS. LUMM, INSISTED THAT KILLING WAS THE ONLY OPTION. MS. LUMM LIKES TO PORTRAY CULL OPPONENTS AS OUT OF CONTROL SCOFFLAWS. THAT'S A PROJECTION. AFTER -- SHE CHARACTERIZED MS. LUMM'S ALLIES AS BY FAR THE MOST HOSTILE AND RUDE AUDIENCE THAT SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED. THE RECORD SHOWS THAT A FEW POLITICALLY CONNECTED GARDENERS HIJACKED THE CITY TO DO THEIR PEST CONTROL. COUNCILMEMBERS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS USELESS, WASTEFUL, DISHONEST, CRUEL AND DANGEROUS PROGRAM DISHONOR THEMSELVES. BY THE WAY, THIS YEAR'S SLAUGHTER WAS APPROVED WITHOUT WAITING TO GET LAST YEAR'S METRICS. THE CITY IS USING DRONES OVER PRIVATE PROPERTY WITHOUT PERMISSION TO GET DEER. AND A FAWN MEMBER WAS EVEN MENACING FOLLOWED BY A DRONE. THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT.
00:40:32.889: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS MR. IBRAHIM HERE? OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:40:41.631: >> YEAH. I ASKED THE CAMERA PERSON TO PLEASE INCLUDE THE SIGN THAT'S PART OF THE TALK. I AGREE THAT IT'S NOT GOOD TO SLAUGHTER DEER, AND I AM GLAD MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. BUT IT'S REALLY BAD TO SLAUGHTER HUMAN BEINGS, AND THAT'S WHAT ISRAEL IS DOING WITH YOUR TAX MONEY. ISRAEL HAS SLAUGHTERED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS. IN FACT, JUST IN THE LAST YEAR, AS YOU KNOW, ISRAEL HAS SHOT DOWN MANY THOUSANDS OF PEACEFUL UNARMED PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS MARCHERS. HUNDREDS ARE DEAD. THOUSANDS ARE MAIMED FOR LIFE, AND ISRAEL HAS DONE THIS WITH THE FULL-THROATED POLITICAL SUPPORT OF VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE U.S. POLITICAL SPECTRUM, AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL. FOR 17 YEARS, THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL HAS THROWN ITS WEIGHT AGAINST ANY RESOLUTION THAT WOULD PROTECT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. FOR 17 BLOODY YEARS. THIS JUNE, IT WILL BE 18 YEARS, AND I KNOW AT ONE POINT THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL WILL REVERSE COURSE AND STAND UP FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. AND AT ONE POINT, THE CITY COUNCIL WILL FINALLY APPROVE THIS SEVEN-WORD RESOLUTION. SEE RIGHT HERE? "WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL." THE CITY COUNCIL WILL APPROVE THAT RESOLUTION ONE DAY. I WISH IT WERE TODAY. I WISH THERE WERE A CITY COUNCILMEMBER NOW WHO HAD A CONSCIENCE WHO WOULD PROPOSE THIS RESOLUTION TO GO AFTER THE PERPETRATOR, WHICH IS THE RACIST, VIOLENT STATE OF ISRAEL, HEAVILY SUPPORTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND HEAVILY SUPPORTED BY THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL UP UNTIL TODAY, UP UNTIL NOW. NOW, IF ONE OF YOU HAS A CONSCIENCE ABOUT THIS MATTER, YOU OUGHT TO SPEAK UP ABOUT IT, BECAUSE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT WHEN YOUR TAX MONEY IS KILLING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE?  WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? AND IT'S HAPPENING NOW. IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN THE 1940s IN EUROPE. IT'S HAPPENING TODAY. AND WE CAN STOP IT. WE CAN STOP IT. DO ANY OF YOU ON THE CITY COUNCIL HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS? ANY OF YOU? OKAY.
00:43:43.079: >> THANK YOU.
00:43:47.383: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WITH RESPECT TO SIGNS, THERE ARE SIGNS IN THE BACK. I KNOW ONE OF THE SIGNS IS RESTING AGAINST THE ART. IF I COULD ASK THE SIGN TO BE MOVED AWAY SO IT'S NOT RESTING ON THE PIECE IN THE BACK. THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:44:04.400: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR, AND WELCOME, EVERYBODY. PRETTY POWERFUL OPENING TO THE MEETING, A LOT OF GOOD, GOOD POINTS BEING BROUGHT UP, REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIDE OF THE FENCE YOU'RE ON. I JUST WANTED TO SAY A SPECIAL THANKS TO CRESSEN FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE CITY. 33 YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO STAY AND DEDICATE YOURSELF AND GIVE A BIG PART OF YOURSELF, AND I AM SURE A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING ARE LIKE FAMILY TO YOU, SO HAPPY TRAILS, AND I AM SURE YOU'LL PROBABLY STAY IN CONTACT, HOPEFULLY WITH A LOT OF FOLKS THAT YOU MADE THAT TYPE OF FRIENDSHIP WITH. YESTERDAY WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY, SO WE HAD A DAY TO REFLECT, AND IT WAS A GOOD DAY, I THOUGHT. THE WEATHER WAS SHINING BRIGHT. I WENT TO THE TALK GIVEN BY ANGELA DAVIS AT THE HILL AUDITORIUM, A PRETTY POWERFUL TALK GIVEN. IT RESONATES WITH MATTERS WITH WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY. SO, A BIG PART OF THAT WAS TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. IT'S GOING TO MEAN A LOT, ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT FRONTS, SO MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT THERE AND ENGAGE AND ENERGIZE AND HOPEFULLY TURN OUT A HISTORIC VOTE. AND I KNOW I BROUGHT IT UP LAST YEAR ABOUT SANITATION WORKERS NOT GETTING THE DAY OFF. IT STILL TROUBLES ME THAT THE DAY THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS KILLED, HE WAS IN SOLIDARITY WITH SANITATION WORKERS, SO THE IRONY THAT THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE WORKING THAT DAY IS TOO LOUD FOR ME TO IGNORE. I'M ON THE BUDGET AND LABOR COMMITTEE, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A CONTRACT THAT STIPULATES THAT DAY IS TAKEN OFF BY OUR SANITATION WORKERS. I WON'T GO ON TOO LONG. I KNOW SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES PROBABLY HAVE A LOT TO SAY, SO I LOOK FORWARD TO A GOOD MEETING.
00:46:21.170: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:46:26.242: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR FOR BRINGING NEUTRAL ZONE AND FUTURE CORPS'S PROGRAM HERE. BOTH MY SISTER AND I GOT OUR STARTS IN TOWN AT THE NEUTRAL ZONE. WE HAVE A HUGE DEBT TO PAY FOR THE NEUTRAL ZONE FOR ALL OF THE JOY WE HAVE GOTTEN IN OUR PROFESSIONAL LIVES. IT SEEMS LIKE AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY OF FOUR PHASES SPANNING TWO TO FOUR YEARS IN WHICH THESE YOUTH WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE AND FIND A PLACE IN THE WORKFORCE, AS WELL AS CONTINUE AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. SO, THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE CITY STAFFER WHO BROUGHT THAT TO LIFE. I WAS ALSO ADDRESSED BY NAME IN COMMUNICATIONS TO CITY COUNCIL. I JUST WANT TO RESPOND REALLY QUICKLY. I THINK WE ARE FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH AN EXCEPTIONALLY BIG HEART, AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN PALESTINE AND COME TO THEIR PROTEST IN A GOOD PLACE AND COME TO IT HONESTLY, AND UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE MR. HERSKOVITZ, AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, HE HAS LED A PICKET OF A HOUSE OF WORSHIP FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS, THE OLDEST JEWISH SYNAGOGUE IN TOWN, FOUNDED IN 1916. BESIDES LEADING THAT PICKET, HE ALSO COMES REGULARLY TO CITY COUNCIL TO DENY THE HOLOCAUST, AND WHILE HIS WORDS MAY HAVE IMBUED SYMPATHY, AND I CAN APPRECIATE THAT, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT ABOUT HIM. YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER HAS RECOGNIZED AN ORGANIZATION THAT HE LEADS AS A HATE GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES. AND IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE LIKE MR. HERSKOVITZ LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND AS WE LIVE IN A WORLD AND AN AGE OF HATE AND A LOT OF ISMS THAT WE WISH DIDN'T EXIST HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY ARE ALIVE AND WELL AND AMONG US. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT CONTEXT, AND I CHOOSE MY WORDS CAREFULLY. SO THANK YOU.
00:48:32.969: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:48:37.473: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT CONVERSATION, MLIVE ACTUALLY HAD AN INTERESTING ARTICLE AND PHOTOS OF THE PROTESTERS OUT IN FRONT OF THE SYNAGOGUE, BOTH THE PRO AND ANTI PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER, AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO TAKE A LOOK AT MLIVE TODAY. THREE QUICK THINGS:  ONE IS I AM ON THE SEMCOG, SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN COALITION OF GOVERNMENT'S BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN TASK FORCE, AND WE WILL HAVE OUR FINAL MEETING TOMORROW, AND A PLAN WILL BE COMING SOON, AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE WE FREQUENTLY TALK ABOUT THE VALUE OF REGIONAL MOBILITY AND COLLABORATION, AND THIS IS REALLY A SHINING EXAMPLE OF THAT. NUMBER TWO, I CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF LIGHTING AT OUR CROSS-WALKS, BOTH THE LACK OF STREETLIGHTS AND STREETLIGHTS THAT ARE OUT. TODAY, I DROVE ON FULLER NEAR MAIDEN LANE, AND ALL OF THE LIGHTS ARE OUT, AND I THOUGHT FOR SURE I WAS GOING TO SEE SOMEONE KILLED, BECAUSE TWO CARS MADE LEFT-HAND TURNS AFTER THE LIGHT WAS RED. A PEDESTRIAN STEPPED OUT AND JUMPED BACK TO SAVE HIS LIFE. STREETLIGHTING IS SO CRITICAL, AND SO I WOULD ASK EVERYONE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL, AND IF YOU SEE A STREETLIGHT OUT, PLEASE REPORT IT TO A2 FIXIT. ALSO, I ATTENDED THE MARTIN LUTHER KING KEYNOTE SPEECH, AND THE ONLY THING THAT I WANT TO ADD THERE WAS ANGELA DAVIS WAS WELCOMED BY THE STUDENTS, AND SHE TALKED ABOUT SOME VERY DIFFICULT TOPICS, LIKE PRISON REFORM AND CIVIL RIGHTS, BUT I LEFT THERE SO OPTIMISTIC AND SO ENERGIZED, AND IF ANYONE GETS A CHANCE TO READ HER NEWEST BOOK OR LOOK AT THAT, THE VIDEO OF HER SPEECH YESTERDAY, I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT AS WELL. A QUICK QUESTION:  THERE'S SOME RUMORS ABOUT A TRIP TO GERMANY AND WHO MIGHT BE GOING AND WHO MAY NOT BE GOING, AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THE MAYOR OR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR COULD CLARIFY THAT WITH WHATEVER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE NOW.
00:50:56.712: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:50:58.881: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND MY THANKS, HEARTFELT THANKS TO MR. SLOTTEN OF 33 YEARS. YOU TRULY DO NOT LOOK OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE SPENT 60% OF YOUR LIFE HERE AT THE CITY. YOU HAVE TRULY IMPROVED THIS PLACE FOR COUNTLESS RESIDENTS AND OTHERS WHO COME AND WORK HERE AND HAVE VISITED ANN ARBOR OVER THE NUMBER OF YEARS. AND I HAVE HAD THE DISTINCT HONOR AND PLEASURE OF INTERACTING WITH YOU FOR A GREAT MANY YEARS. YOU STARTED HERE IN 1987, AND SO YOU WERE ON BOARD WHEN I WAS AROUND IN THE '90s, AND YOU'VE ALWAYS CONDUCTED YOURSELF WITH THE UTMOST PROFESSIONALISM, AND A MODEST DETERMINATION, AND ALWAYS -- MODESTY HAS ALWAYS PREVAILED IN YOUR CASE. YOU JUST QUIETLY ARE ALWAYS ABOUT YOUR WORK, AND WORKING ESPECIALLY HARD AND EFFECTIVELY FOR EVERYONE THAT YOU SERVE, AND THAT -- THAT SORT OF CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF YOUR WORK AND ALL THAT YOU DO LEAVES US IN VERY GOOD STEAD, AND SO FOR YOUR 33 YEARS OF SERVICE TO US ALL, I EXTEND YOU MY MOST HEARTFELT WHEN I FORWARDED -- I TOOK SOME LIBERTY IN DOING THIS, I PRESUME, BUT I FORWARDED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF YOUR FRIDAY RETIREMENT PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE, AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR FRIENDS, OUR CONSTITUENTS WILL BE COMING, AND WITHOUT -- YOU KNOW, TO THE PERSON, EVERYONE SAID THAT YOU ARE JUST A SUPER HUMAN BEING, AND YOU'LL BE SORELY MISSED, AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ALL OF US IS SO VERY GREATLY APPRECIATED, SO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE, ALL OF YOUR GOOD WORK, YOUR OUTSTANDING WORK THESE MANY YEARS. THANK YOU.
00:53:18.087: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:53:18.954: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. SO I WANT TO EXTEND MY CONGRATULATIONS TO CRESSEN SLOTTEN, AND LUCKY YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH US ANYMORE. SO I WOULD CELEBRATE THAT AS WELL. SO, A FEW THINGS. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT CC1 ON YOUR PACKET IS A RESOLUTION THAT WILL BE COMING FORWARD TO APPOINT SOMEONE TO THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION. WHILE HE IS BEING NOMINATED TO FULFILL A GENERAL CITIZEN SLOT, HE COULD ACTUALLY MEET A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES ON THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION. BONUS, HE'S FROM WARD 3, SO THIS IS REALLY AN EXCITING NOMINATION TO BE PUTTING FORWARD. HE ALSO CAME RECOMMENDED WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM FROM A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SO I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING HIM APPOINTED AND GETTING HIM ON BOARD AND CONTRIBUTING. SPEAKING OF THE GREENBELT, F1 IN YOUR PACKET IS THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION'S STRATEGIC PLAN, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK IT OVER, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DIRECT THEM TO ME, AND I'M HOPING THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING THAT FORWARD FOR SOMETHING MORE FORMAL IN THE FUTURE, BUT THE STRATEGIC PLAN IS THERE, AND I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT. THE THIRD ONE, ITEM ON MY ANNOUNCEMENTS TONIGHT, IS THAT TOMORROW, FROM 6:00-7:00 AT YORK, AT 1928 PACKARD, IT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST -- IT WON'T BE THE OFFICIAL ONE THAT'S REQUIRED, BUT THE DEVELOPER IS TRYING TO GET COMMUNITY FEEDBACK VERY EARLY ABOUT THE POTENTIAL REDEVELOPMENT OF 2111 PACKARD, WHICH IS A POTENTIAL MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S COMING TO THAT SITE WHERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS THAT THAT SITE HAS NOT GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION IN SOME YEARS, AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME EXCITEMENT AND QUESTIONS AROUND THAT, SO THE DEVELOPER IS JUST LOOKING FOR SOME EARLY INPUT, SO PLEASE COME TO THAT FROM 6:00 TO 7:00. IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED, THERE WILL BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGEMENT AS WELL. THE LAST ITEM THAT I HAVE IS SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND I WILL BE BRINGING FORWARD. OTHERS ARE WELCOME TO JOIN US, AT THE HOUSING COMMISSION, THAT I'M LIAISON TO, LAST WEEK, THE HOUSING COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED A HOUSING PLEDGE, WHICH AS PART OF THEIR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE, IT'S A STATEMENT OF BELIEFS. THE HOUSING COMMISSION BOARD THEN ASKED THAT I BRING THAT FORWARD TO COUNCIL TO HAVE US JOIN THEM IN THAT SHARED STATEMENT OF BELIEFS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION BUT PLAN ON BRINGING THAT FORWARD AT A FUTURE MEETING AT THE REQUEST OF THE HOUSING COMMISSION BOARD, AND I THINK IT'S A TERRIFIC DOCUMENT, AND I'M HAPPY TO SEND THAT AROUND IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AND WANTS TO JOIN COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND I IN SUPPORTING THAT RESOLUTION OR SPONSORING THAT RESOLUTION. I ALSO JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE MY COLLEAGUE OUT ON A LIMB, BECAUSE BETH ISRAEL IS A CONGREGATION IN MY WARD AS WELL, AND I THINK TO SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE GIVES SOMEONE ELSE A CHAIR WHO MAY BE SHARES A DIFFERENT VIEW BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY BRINGS ADDITIONAL ATTENTION TO THEIR CAUSE, WHEN THE INTENT OF THEIR ACTIONS ARE TO SPREAD HATE SPEECH AND ALSO TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE FROM THEIR OWN PLACE OF WORSHIP FOR 16 YEARS, ONE NICE ACTION DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR A MULTITUDE OF REALLY VILE ACTIONS. SO I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS AN ARTICLE TODAY. I WAS ACTUALLY -- AND I HATE TO GIVE THIS ISSUE MORE ATTENTION, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT WANTS -- (AUDIENCE COMMENTS.) [ GAVEL ] AYOR TAYLOR:  MA'AM, PLEASE BE QUIET. MA'AM, PLEASE BE IN ORDER. MA'AM, PLEASE COME TO ORDER.
00:57:55.030: >> EVERYONE DONE? OKAY. SO I THINK THAT, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, HERE I WAS TRYING TO SPEAK, AND WE SEE THAT AGAIN THERE'S ACTIONS THAT ARE TAKEN TO INTIMIDATE. THERE WERE WORDS USED BY MR. HERSKOVITZ THAT ARE MEANT TO, YOU KNOW, CHARACTERIZE JEWS AS WEAK. I'M NOT SCARED OF YOU. I AM HORRIFIED OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO MY COLLEAGUE, BUT WE ARE NOT SCARED. YOU CAN COME AND YOU CAN SPEW YOUR HATE, AND WE'LL KEEP TELLING YOU THAT YOU'RE A LOATHESOME INDIVIDUAL AND THAT WE ARE NOT HAPPY THAT YOU ARE HERE.
00:58:35.304: >> CAN I HAVE A CALL TO ORDER? THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS.
00:58:40.576: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'LL PUT YOU ON THE QUEUE, IF YOU WISH. COUNCILMEMBER?
00:58:46.615: >> I HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE PATIENTLY LISTENING TO THIS. WE DO NOT NEED THE SPEW TO COME FROM THIS BODY.
00:58:53.756: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER, I'LL PUT YOU ON THE QUEUE. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:58:58.127: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WELL, I WOULD SECOND THAT CALL TO ORDER. I THINK IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT, CAN'T WE GO SIT IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE? CAN'T YOU HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS AND MAYBE WORK IT OUT YOURSELVES?
00:59:10.039: >> CAN I TALK TO THAT, ACTUALLY?
00:59:14.910: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'LL PUT YOU ON THE QUEUE.
00:59:18.414: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, BUT I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THEM AS WELL. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME. WE SUPPORT FREE SPEECH HERE. ANGELA DAVIS DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. SHE CUT HER THING SHORT BECAUSE THEY HELD UP THE SIGNS. I AM SURE SHE HAD PLENTY TO SAY ABOUT IT, WHICH IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE, BUT SHE DID SAY IF YOU WANT TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE WORLD, YOU HAVE TO START HERE AT HOME, SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS FOR PEOPLE TO COME HERE WHERE THEY CAN. THEY CAN'T GO TO NEW YORK EVERY WEEKEND AND PICKET AT THE U.N., SO I'LL JUST LET THAT GO. WE HAVE MOMENTS OF SILENCE EVERY WEEK, SOMETIMES FOR -- WHATEVER YOU WANT THEM TO BE FOR. IF PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ISRAEL, THEY GET A CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT THAT, OR WHAT'S GOING ON IN PALESTINE. EVERYONE HAS PROBLEMS IN THIS WORLD. PEOPLE LIVE AND DIE. I'M GOING TO SEND MINE OUT TO MY ESTRANGED AUNT WHO DIED THIS WEEK. SORRY TO MY FOLKS ABOUT THAT, ABOUT MY AUNT SHIRLEY. AND FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS IN CANADA WHO LOVE RUSH, THE DRUMMER FOR RUSH, NEIL PEART DIED LAST WEEK. I'M KIND OF A MUSIC NUT. HIS LYRICS, AS CORNY AS IT SOUNDS, THE FIRST EXPOSURE I HAD TO THAT KIND OF STUFF WAS HIS VERY POETIC LYRICS, AND LATER ON, I WAS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN THE KIND OF TRUTHFUL STREET LYRICS OF HIP-HOP AND RAP AND SO ON, BUT IN MY FORMATIVE AGE, I LOVED RUSH. THINGS COME THROUGH MY HEAD ALL THE TIME AT THE TABLE, AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS SAYING. I COULD QUOTE A HUNDRED LYRICS FROM RUSH, BUT ONE THAT STANDS OUT TO ME IS WE HAVE GOT TO RISE ABOVE THE BACK AND FORTH ON THESE PETTY ISSUES. HE SAID MEN WHO HOLD HIGH PLACES, AND I GUESS IT WOULD BE MEN AND WOMEN AT THIS TABLE, MUST BE THE ONES WHO MOLD REALITY.  AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO MAKE WHAT WE WANT IN OUR CITY AND MAKE WHAT WE WANT OF THE WORLD, AND I WOULD GO ON TO SAY SORRY TO ALL OF THE RUSH FANS OUT HERE. I WANT TO THANK MS. WOTAN FOR COMING UP TO SPEAK. WEREN'T YOU AT -- I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU. CLEARLY SHE IS CONCERNED AND INVOLVED ABOUT ACTIONS IN THE CITY AROUND THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN SIERRA CLUB ASKED ME WHAT WAS MY BIGGEST THING THAT I HAD EVER DONE ENVIRONMENTALLY, AND I THOUGHT, WELL, IT HAS TO BE MY WORK WITH WATER AND GELMAN AND ALL OF THAT. I THOUGHT, NO, THE BIGGEST THING THAT I HAVE EVER DONE WAS TRY TO LIVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL LIFESTYLE, WHERE 35 YEARS AGO I STOPPED EATING MEAT AND ALMOST DAIRY, AND MY WHOLE FAMILY WAS RAISED UP THAT WAY, AND MY WIFE WENT VEGAN ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY CAN DO, AT LEAST PARTIALLY, AND IT WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO THE WORLD. AND NOT ONLY IS IT THE GASES THAT THE INDUSTRY PUTS OFF ITSELF, BUT THEY ALSO ARE SUPER COMPLICIT IN OVERUSE OF WATER, AND THEY ARE ALSO VERY COMPLICIT IN THE DEFORESTATION, ESPECIALLY IN BRAZIL AND THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, WHERE HUGE AMOUNTS OF FORESTS ARE TORN DOWN FOR GIANT SOY PLANTATIONS, AND THESE SOY PLANTATIONS, IT'S CATTLE GRAZING AND IT'S SOY AND CATTLE FEED LOT OPERATIONS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL DO TO GET OVER THAT. THANKS FOR SAYING THAT. THANKS FOR SPEAKING. LAST WEEK, I WENT AND SPOKE SORT OF ON BEHALF OF MYSELF BUT ALSO ON THE CITY AND MY CONSTITUENTS AT THE D.E.Q. OR E.E.G.L. RATHER SET STANDARDS FOR P.F.A.S. IN OUR PUBLIC WATERS, AND I DON'T THINK THEY ARE LOW ENOUGH IN OUR FINISHED WATER, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK THEY SHOULD MAKE THEM ZERO IN PUBLIC WATERS SO THAT WE CAN CRACK DOWN ON THE POLLUTERS. I'LL LET IT GO AT THAT -- OH, ONE MORE THING. I MET WITH FOLKS FROM THE HUMAN SOCIETY LAST WE WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN, SO WHEN WE COME UP WITH A BUDGET THIS YEAR AND WE WANT TO PUT IN SOME MONEY FOR THE CULL, WE HAVE A PLAN THAT IS AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN FOR DEALING WITH THE ISSUES AROUND THE CULL, THE PROBLEM WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE IS NONLETHAL THAT WE ARE USING LETHAL MEANS TO SOLVE, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE SAW HELICOPTERS LOOKING FOR DEER TO KILL TODAY, BUT THEY WERE HOVERING PRETTY HARD OVER WARD ONE AND TWO, AND I LOOKED UP AND THOUGHT HOW MUCH DOES THAT HELICOPTER RIDE COST US ALL? IT'S TOO MUCH. AND WE ARE WORKING ON IT.
01:04:12.908: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:04:14.042: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I JUST WANTED TO ANNOUNCE A PUBLIC MEETING FOR THE 2021 SCIO CHURCH IMPROVEMENTS ON JANUARY 29TH FROM 6:30-8:30 P.M. AT LOFTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, FOR ANY OTHER WARD RESIDENTS INTERESTED. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO SHARE IS THE CITY HAS A MID BLOCK CROSSWALK SURVEY ON OUR WEBSITE. THERE'S NOT A REAL SHORT LINK THAT I CAN RATTLE OFF, BUT IF YOU GO TO A2 GOV.ORG AND SEARCH FOR CROSSWALK SURVEY, YOU CAN FIND THAT, AND THE SURVEY IS OPEN UNTIL JANUARY 27TH. THANKS.
01:04:55.217: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:05:02.758: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I FORGOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR EARLY ON WITH THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM THE NEUTRAL ZONE. I WAS THERE LAST YEAR DURING THAT CEREMONY, AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING REALLY POSITIVE SPARKED THERE AND HAS GOTTEN TO BE A MUCH WIDELY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THAN I THINK WAS EVER IMAGINED, SO I APPRECIATE DOING THOSE KIND OF THINGS, ANDT'S REALLY PROBABLY THE BEST $10,000 THAT WE HAVE SPENT SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL. IT SHOULD COME TO NO SURPRISE BY NOW THAT I AM PALESTINIAN, AND I HAVE NOT MADE IT THIS FORUM TO EXPRESS MY POLITICAL BELIEFS AND MY PERSONAL POSITIONS, AND I THINK THIS BODY SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER LEVEL, WHERE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ATTACKS AND MOVE ON AND DISCUSS THE BUSINESS THAT THIS CITY HAS ELECTED US TO DISCUSS. WHILE CAMPAIGNING, I WAS TOLD THAT THIS ISSUE WAS NOT LOCAL, AND TO NOT WASTE OUR PRECIOUS TIME ON IT. I HAVE MY PERSONAL POSITIONS, AND TO THIS POINT, I HAVE KEPT THEM TO MYSELF, AND I WISH OTHERS WOULD SO SO WE CAN GET ON TO THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE. AND THAT THIS BODY SHOULD NOT BE ATTACKING MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE, AND I FIND THAT VERY TROUBLING DIRECTION THAT WE ARE GOING IN. WE SHOULD NOT BE ATTACKING MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE. THIS TABLE HAS KEVLAR. WE HAVE POLICE. SO I FIND IT TROUBLING, AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
01:07:12.988: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:07:13.889: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S STATING HIS POSITION. I FEEL LIKE WHEN THERE IS HATE SHOWN IN THE COMMUNITY, IT IS OUR POSITION, AS LEADERS, TO OCCASIONALLY CALL IT OUT, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES. SOMETIMES WE JUST SIT AND WE LISTEN TO IT. I THINK GIVEN SOME OF THE EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY RECENTLY TO THEN COME FORWARD DURING THAT TIME AND MAKE THOSE REMARKS NEEDED TO BE CALLED OUT AT THAT TIME. WE CAN TAKE A DIFFERENT POSITION ON THAT. YOU KNOW, AND IT WAS -- IN THE PAST, WHEN WE HAD THESE COMMENTS AND WHEN ONE OF US WAS ATTACKED AT THIS TABLE, THERE WERE OTHERS THAT STOOD UP, OR CERTAINLY DIDN'T TAKE STEPS TO DEFEND IT, AND I CAN SAY THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO I AGREED WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WHO I DISAGREED WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS, BUT THAT WE BEHAVED IN A WAY THAT -- THAT I FELT LIKE WE WERE ALL ON THE SIDE OF NOT SUPPORTING HATE. WHAT I HEARD -- AND WHAT I HAVE HEARD IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AT THE TABLE IS UPSETTING TO ME, BECAUSE -- AND IT'S PERSONAL, BECAUSE THIS IS -- WE ARE HEARING REMARKS THAT ARE CLEARLY ANTI-SEMITIC AT A TIME IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN WE ARE SEEING INCREASING ATTACKS ON JEWS FOR BEING JEWS, AND I'M NOT SAYING THERE AREN'T OTHER KINDS OF HATES, BUT I WOULD EXPECT IF WE HEARD THAT KIND OF HATE AT THIS TABLE THAT WE WOULD ALSO STAND UP IN OTHER WAYS, AND WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T MAKE REMARKS LIKE, OH, READ THE ARTICLE, BECAUSE, LOOK, HENRY GAVE SOMEONE A CHAIR, OR LAST WEEK, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, WHEN YOU USED THE WORD ABOUT THAT WE SHOULD BE CHRISTIAN IN OUR BEHAVIOR, WELL, I'M NOT CHRISTIAN, AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DON'T HAVE A MORAL CENTER, AND SO -- SO THAT IS --
01:09:12.974: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THAT WAS RELATED TO LODGING. THAT WAS RELATED TO THE WELCOMING SENSE OF LODGING. THAT WAS --
01:09:21.416: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND HAS THE FLOOR -- (COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE.)
01:09:29.624: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MA'AM -- MA'AM, MA'AM, ORDER, PLEASE. ORDER PLEASE.
01:09:40.268: >> SO, AND THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS CONTROVERSY ABOUT CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THIS TABLE WHO HAVE TAKEN MONEY FROM MR. HERSKOVITZ AND WHO HAVE BEEN ASKED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY NOT TO ACCEPT THOSE DOLLARS AND HAVE DOUBLED DOWN AND DEFENDED IT, AND THAT -- THAT'S THEIR CHOICE, BUT IN THE PAST, IT'S -- IT'S JUST VERY DISAPPOINTING TO ME THAT OTHERS HAVE -- AND I WANT TO GET TO THE BUSINESS OF OUR WORK TOO. I REALLY DO. T AT THE SAME TIME GOING TO BE ATTACKED BY MY COLLEAGUES FOR MY BEHAVIOR IN CALLING OUT HATE.
01:10:21.042: >> TELL ME WHEN YOU WANT TO WORK WITH WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA.
01:10:25.680: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:10:28.717: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT A MEETING RELEVANT TO WARD ONE PEOPLE. ON THIS THURSDAY, JANUARY 23RD, THE BARTON SIDEWALK SPECIAL ASSESSMENT MEETING WILL BE TAKING PLACE AT THE NORTH SIDE S.T.E.A.M. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND THE MEETING STARTS AT 6:30. SO I HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AT 7:00, SO I WILL BE THERE FROM 6:15 TO 6:45, AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WILL ALSO BE THERE FOR THE DURATION OF THE WHOLE MEETING, BUT ANY OF YOU ON THE PONTIAC TRAIL BARTON DRIVE AREA WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MORE DETAIL ON THE SIDEWALK SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS, PLEASE JOIN US THURSDAY AT 6:30.
01:11:11.926: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:11:12.961: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WANT TO DRAW A REAL CLEAR LINE IN MY COMMUNICATION. THE PRACTICE OF YOUR RIGHT TO PROTEST THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND ACTIONS OF PALESTINE ARE PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE. WHAT UPSETS ME IS PICKETING A HOUSE OF WORSHIP FOR 16 YEARS, AND I HOPE THAT IF IT WERE A BLACK CHURCH OR A MOSQUE THAT WAS PICKETED FOR 16 YEARS, THAT ALL OF US WOULD STAND UP AND SAY SOMETHING, AND THAT'S THAT.
01:11:45.393: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL?
01:11:52.767: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  NO, I WANT TO START WORKING ON THE THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR ELECTED US TO WORK ON. AT LEAST YOU CAN GO TO WORSHIP. YOU CAN'T EVEN GET INTO THE -- MOSQUE IF YOU'RE THE AGE OF 18-45 TO GO TO PRAYER.
01:12:16.791: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I DON'T HAVE ANY NOMINATIONS OR APPOINTMENTS TODAY. IN RESPONSE TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S REQUEST, I DIRECT HER ATTENTION TO AN EMAIL THAT SHE RECEIVED AN TUESDAY THE 7th, WHICH ARTICULATED AN INVITATION TO MEMBERS OF COUNCIL AND TO STAFF TO DISCUSS CARBON NEUTRALITY INITIATIVES, SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES. THERE ARE SOME DETAILS THERE. WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ISSUES WHICH ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO A NUMBER OF -- TO MANY OF US WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. I THINK IT IS, OF COURSE, CORRECT AND ENTIRELY PROPER THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE POLITICAL VIEWS, THAT THEY EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS, WHETHER THOSE ARE, YOU KNOW, WITH -- WELL, THAT IS A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT, AND I THINK THAT IT'S A RIGHT THAT IS BEING OBSERVED HERE SCRUPULOUSLY. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT THE ONGOING PROTESTS AT THE TEMPLE ARE A LOCAL ISSUE. THEY ARE A LOCAL ISSUE BECAUSE THEY IMPACT DEEPLY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. I BELIEVE THAT THOSE PROTESTS ARE IMPROPER. I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE -- THAT THE PROTESTS AT A HOUSE OF WORSHIP ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES OF ANN ARBOR. AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD END. (COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE.)
01:14:32.927: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE NOW COME TO THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE PLEASE TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND SECOND BY BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:14:50.712: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL OUT CA5.
01:14:54.682: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:14:58.086: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL OUT CA13.
01:15:01.322: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:15:05.627: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL OUT CA17 AND CA18, PLEASE.
01:15:13.868: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:15:17.839: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I'M SORRY TO SAY IT, I KEPT HOPING THEY WOULD SAY MY NUMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA 10, 11, 12, AND 19.
01:15:29.283: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? HOLD CA 5, 13, 17, 18, 10, 12 AND 14. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA 5, 13, 17, 18, 10, 12, 14 -- AND 19 ARE APPROVED, THUS SATISFYING THE 8-VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-9, CA-11. THAT IS ALL. CA-5, RESOLUTION TO CLOSE STREETS FOR THE 20th ANNUAL MAYORS GREEN FAIR FRIDAY, JUNE 12TH, 2020, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA5, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:16:31.779: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S ALREADY IN THE 20th YEAR. IT STARTED OFF AS SOMETHING SMALL, AND IT'S GROWN INTO SOMETHING BIG, AND OBVIOUSLY NOW AN ISSUE THAT'S TALKED ABOUT DAILY WORLDWIDE. AND I JUST, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE AT THIS EVENT, EVEN THOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S TRADITION, SHOULD PROBABLY, IN MY OPINION, BE HELD, AND, YOU KNOW, AT THE NEW CENTER OF THE CITY PARK, AND IT SHOULD BE HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIBRARY AND LIBERTY PLAZA, AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I DON'T GO AS FAR AS TO OPPOSE IT. DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, AS A DOWNTOWN BUSINESS OWNER, WHEN WE HAVE THESE CLOSURES, IT SNARLS TRAFFIC, AND YOU LOOK AT 5:00 ON A FRIDAY, THE KIND OF TRAFFIC CONGESTIONS AND JAMS THAT OCCUR, AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I WAS JUST SCRATCHING MY HEAD WATCHING THIS AND HAVING IT BE THE GREEN FAIR, THE MAYOR'S GREEN FAIR, AND TRYING TO PROMOTE CLIMATE AWARENESS, AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME -- SOME COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED THAT THAT ARE UNFORESEEN, AND I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD BE A GREAT EVENT TO HOLD ON THAT SITE. WE HAVE LIBERTY PLAZA WE CAN INCLUDE TO EXPAND THE FOOTPRINT AND HAVE AN EDUCATIONAL PART WHERE THE LIBRARY IS. SO I JUST WOULD PERHAPS URGE THE MAYOR TO LOOK AT THAT AND, IF NOT THIS YEAR, FOLLOWING YEARS. THANK YOU.
01:18:18.686: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-5. ALL IN FAVOR -- COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:18:24.625: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  EXCUSE ME. I'LL SUPPORT THE STREET CLOSINGS, BUT I WILL JUST SAY, THIS CAME UP WHEN I SAW AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN YOUR OFFICE, MR. MAYOR, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MAIN STREET AREA ASSOCIATION, BECAUSE THE -- IT WAS PROPOSED -- AS PROPOSED WOULD CONFLICT WITH RESTAURANT WEEK INITIALLY, AND I THINK SOME CHANGES MAY HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE RESTAURANT WEEK SCHEDULE. I'M NOT CERTAIN, BUT IT WAS OFFERED BY SOME OF THE MAIN STREET BUSINESSES THAT, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, DURING THE GREEN FAIR, THE BUSINESSES, THE RESTAURANT BUSINESSES, I GUESS IN PARTICULAR -- I SUPPOSE ALL OF THE BUSINESSES, SEE THE LEAST CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. SO THEY, I SUPPOSE, WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PERHAPS CONSOLIDATED, PERHAPS, AND NOT CLOSE AS MANY STREETS IF NECESSARY AND MOVE TO -- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE THE LIBRARY LOT WOULD BE A PERFECT LOCATION TO HOST SOMETHING LIKE THIS, SO IN THE FUTURE, GOING FORWARD, TO BE CONSIDERED, I SUPPOSE.
01:19:39.333: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:19:42.703: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  I JUST WANT TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND LUMM, THAT THOSE ARE EXCELLENT POINTS, THAT BECAUSE OF THE SNARLING, IDLING IN TRAFFIC THAT IT CAN CAUSE AND ALSO THE IMPACT ON LOCAL BUSINESS, RESTAURANTS, I STRONGLY WOULD AGREE IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO MOVE OUR GREEN FAIR PROGRAM TO THE LIBRARY BLOCK, THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. THANK YOU.
01:20:07.461: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:20:12.633: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT CHANGE NOW, BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE A GOOD IDEA, ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE REASON THAT IT'S ON MAIN STREET IS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO VISUALIZE THE NOTION THAT MAIN STREET IN THE FUTURE MIGHT BE A NONMOTORIZED STREET. I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE THROWING THAT IDEA AROUND AND OTHER THINGS. I THINK THE IDEA IS YOU GET OUT THERE IN THE STREETS AND VISUALIZE, HEY, THIS IS WHAT A WORLD WITHOUT CARS WOULD BE AND SO ON. SO I THINK IT IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO USE A RECURRING EVENT TO USE WHAT COULD WHAT COULD BE A CIVIC CENTER AND A COMMON SPACE, SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT NEXT YEAR. MAYBE WE COULD DO THAT ON WILLIAM AND ONLY CLOSE A LITTLE BIT OF WILLIAM OR SOMETHING. I THINK IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE NEXT YEAR TO DO THAT. BUT THE GREEN FAIR, AS IT STANDS, HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE -- I DON'T KNOW WHO HAS BEEN CHARTING IT, IF WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING IT, BUT DO WE HAVE BETTER AND BETTER TURNOUT EVERY YEAR ON THAT? HOPEFULLY IT'S GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AS OUR SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES GROW. SO THAT'S ALL. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE MY TWO CENTS. THANKS.
01:21:22.370: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:21:23.738: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  WELL, THANKS. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE SUPPORT THAT THIS IDEA GOT RIGHT AWAY. IS THERE ANY WAY, I WOULD ASK THE SPONSOR, OF PERHAPS -- IT ISN'T UNTIL JUNE, I BELIEVE, OF RELOCATING IT FOR THIS YEAR? IS THERE ANY WAY OF LOGISTICALLY OR ANY IDEA OF DOING THAT THIS YEAR, OR ARE THINGS KIND OF IN MOTION?
01:21:44.492: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IT IS WELL IN -- I BELIEVE IT TO BE WELL UNDER WAY.
01:21:47.728: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  OKAY. I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD ASK.
01:21:51.565: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  NO WORRIES.
01:21:52.967: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  ALL RIGHT. BUT, YEAH, I MEAN -- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. THANKS.
01:21:59.106: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. CA-13. RESOLUTION TO APPROPRIATE $5,000 TO THE GENERAL FUND TO ASSOCIATE -- UPDATE PROJECT AND APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH SAM SCHWARTZ CONSULTING, LLC, IN THE AMOUNT OF $356,670. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA-13. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:22:38.045: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I'M NOT OPPOSED TO WHAT STAFF IS PRESENTING HERE, BUT IT HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE ORIGINAL COUNCIL RESOLUTION, AND THAT COUNCIL RESOLUTION WAS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED AS POLICY MAKERS AND TO SET PRIORITIES TO PREPARE FOR THE BUDGET. AND JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE SIMPLE EXAMPLE, ENGINEERS ARE LICENSED, JUST LIKE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, SO IF YOU GO TO YOUR MEDICAL PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND YOU REQUEST A REFERRAL TO A SPECIALIST, AND INSTEAD ARE GIVEN THREE OPTIONS FOR SUPPLEMENTS, IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE REQUESTING, AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE THIS RESPONSE IS, AND, AGAIN, I'M NOT OPPOSED TO THIS RESPONSE, BUT IT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY MEET THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION.
01:23:45.446: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ]
01:23:54.255: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IS IT A -- DO YOU WANT ROLL CALL BECAUSE OF THE EIGHT VOTES?
01:23:59.126: >> I WOULD LIKE A ROLL CALL VOTE, AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS WE CAN SUPPORT THIS, BUT THE OTHER RESOLUTION IS STILL OUT THERE WITHOUT A RESPONSE.
01:24:12.573: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ROLL CALL --
01:24:15.009: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  CAN I ASK A QUESTION ON THAT? I'M SORRY. HOW DOES THIS ADDRESS THE RESOLUTION IF IT WAS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE RESOLUTION THAT WE PASSED PRIOR? IS THIS JUST A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION?
01:24:28.255: >> NO.
01:24:28.722: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  OR IS THIS AN ANSWER TO THAT?
01:24:35.029: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: COUNCILMEMBER, THERE IS AN OPTION THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE RESOLUTION AS WELL THAT PROVIDES AN ADDED SCOPE THAT ADDS SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COST. IN PREPARING THE INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE RESOLUTION, THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT THAT COST, AND WE WENT BACK TO SAM SCHWARTZ AND ASKED TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED AS TO WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT AND APPROPRIATE STAFFING TO EXECUTE A VISION ZERO APPROACH, WHICH IS WHAT IS BEFORE YOU. THE REST OF WHAT WAS IN THAT RESOLUTION IS ALSO INCLUDED HERE, SHOULD COUNCIL DECIDE TO ADOPT IT. IT WILL REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 20 PLUS THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THAT'S ADDED THERE IN THE RESOLUTION ITSELF AS AN OPTION, AND I THINK THAT, COMBINED WITH WHAT'S PRESENTED HERE, FULLY ANSWERS AND RESPONDS TO THE RESOLUTION THAT COUNCIL ADOPTED.
01:25:33.087: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND THEN LUMM.
01:25:36.790: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. FIRST OF ALL, MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT SAM SCHWARTZ ACTUALLY HAD THE EXPERTISE TO LOOK AT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, AND SO I WAS CONFUSED AS TO HOW ASSESSMENT OF OUR ORG CHART AND STAFFING WAS RESPONSIVE TO THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION, BUT WHAT MR. LAZARUS SAID JUST NOW IS CONFUSING TO ME, BECAUSE THIS BODY ACTUALLY PASSED A RESOLUTION, A BUDGETA AMENDMENT AROUND HIRING A VISION ZERO EXPERT, AND SO IT STRIKES ME THAT WE ARE NOT -- WE DON'T HAVE A QUESTION TO ANSWER ABOUT WHETHER SUCH A PERSON IS REQUIRED. THE BODY HAS ALREADY VOTED IN SUPPORT OF CREATING THAT POSITION, BECAUSE WE -- THAT WAS SOMETHING WE VOTED ON, SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, A, WHY WE ARE ASKING SAM SCHWARTZ TO ASSESS OUR STAFFING WHEN THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO ASSESS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, AND SECONDARILY, I DON'T -- I GUESS I'M -- I KNOW THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD HAS TALKED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT A PERCEIVED DELAY IN HIRING THE PERSON THAT WAS ADDED TO THE BUDGET, AND SO I GUESS I'M -- I JUST HAVE QUESTIONS AROUND THAT. THANKS.
01:26:57.071: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  SO, IN FORMING THE POSITION DESCRIPTION FOR THE HIRE, WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONSULTED WITH PEER CITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO SEE WHAT SKILLS AND WHAT QUALIFICATIONS WERE REQUIRED. I WILL FREELY STIPULATE THAT TOOK A WHILE, AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THOUGH THAT WE HIRED THE APPROPRIATE PERSON. DURING THAT DISCUSSION, THERE WAS SOME FEEDBACK FROM COUNCIL THAT INSTEAD OF WANTING TO HIRE AN ENGINEER, THERE WAS A DESIRE TO HIRE AN OPERATIONS MANAGER, SO WE CHOSE TO CLARIFY, AND THEN WE DEVELOPED A JOB DESCRIPTION. IT'S ADVERTISED, IT'S POSTED, AND EXPECTED TO BE FILLED RELATIVELY SOON. SO IF WE ARE GUILTY OF ANYTHING THERE, WE ARE GUILTY OF BEING OVERLY DILIGENT. CONCURRENT WITH THAT CONVERSATION, WITH THE SPONSOR OF THE RESOLUTION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, I THINK THERE WAS SOME BACK AND FORTH AS TO WHAT THE GOAL WAS, AND I THINK THERE WERE SOME CHANGES THERE TOO. YOU MAY FAULT ME FOR WORKING WITH A SPECIFIC COUNCILMEMBER WHEN COUNCIL ADOPTED A RESOLUTION AS A WHOLE, BUT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO WORK WITH SPONSORS OF A RESOLUTION, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ADOPTION, TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ACTIONS WE TAKE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIRED OUTCOME. SO AS WE WENT THROUGH DEVELOPING A SCOPE OF WORK FOR SAM SCHWARTZ, WE WENT BACK AND FORTH. THERE WAS A THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD DO WHAT WAS ASKED FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. IT TURNS OUT THEY DO HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO A PROFESSIONAL JOB. THE SCOPE CAME BACK AT A GREATER JOB THAN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED, SO WHAT'S WRITTEN IN THE RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU, THERE'S A STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO AMEND THE BUDGET BY $5,000 TO ADD AN ANALYSIS OF THE STRUCTURE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION STAFF. IN ADDITION TO THAT, THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION, THREE, WHICH IF ADOPTED WOULD REQUIRE A LARGER BUDGET AMENDMENT, AND THAT WOULD THEN BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH WHAT THE RESOLUTION INCLUDED. IF COUNCIL DESIRES TO -- FOR US TO GO DOWN THAT PATH, THEN I WOULD ASK THAT YOU AMEND THE RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU ■TOINCLUDE THE COSTS OF THE ENTIRE SCOPE. THEY ARE HERE TO CONFIRM OR CORRECT WHAT I JUST SAID, BUT THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT -- I APOLOGIZE IF IT COMES ACROSS AS A LITTLE CONFUSING, BUT I THINK IN THE END, WE BROUGHT BACK WHAT YOU HAVE ASKED.
01:29:43.604: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:29:45.539: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I'M DONE, THANKS.
01:29:48.242: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:29:49.142: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YEAH, JUST QUICKLY, I WILL SAY THAT INITIALLY IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME WHAT OPTIONS WERE PREFERRED BY ST STAFF, SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFICATIONS AND THE RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION THAT I HAD ABOUT THAT, AND CLEARLY, STAFF SEEMS OKAY WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION, AND I ALSO APPRECIATE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION DID NOT DISCUSS THIS IN DETAIL OR TAKE A POSITION FOR THAT MATTER, AND IT'S ALSO GOOD TO KNOW THAT THIS POSITION HAS BEEN POSTED, AND THIS TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER POSITION AND IT'S OPEN UNTIL THE 31st, AND THEN INTERVIEWS WILL OCCUR THEREAFTER. I -- SO, AGAIN, I'M COMFORTABLE WITH WHATEVER, YOU KNOW, OPTION THAT STAFF VIEWED AS APPROPRIATE HERE. I DO THINK AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PEDESTRIAN CYCLING ENVIRONMENT AND A TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE IS APPROPRIATE, AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY WHY COUNCIL ASKED FOR THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO THANK YOU.
01:30:55.242: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND THEN HAYNER ON THIS $5,000 ITEM.
01:31:02.015: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I AM NOT AN ENGINEER, SO I WANT TO MAKE THIS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR:  THE RESOLUTION ASKED FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLING ENVIRONMENT. ENVIRONMENT. INFRASTRUCTURE. I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH STAFF WHEN THEY HAVE QUESTIONED THOSE VERY CLEAR, SIMPLE ENGLISH WORDS. WHAT WE HAVE NOW, WE HAVE THREE OPTIONS THAT DO NOT IN ANY WAY CONTAIN WHAT WAS ASKED FOR. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS INSUBORDINATION, VERY SIMPLY. I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE ASSESSED. I'M NOT THE ONE TO DO IT, AND WE HAVE DELAYED THAT ASSESSMENT. I'LL JUST GIVE TWO EXAMPLES. ONE IS WE HAVE RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING BEACONS ON FULLER ROAD ACROSS FIVE LANES OF TRAFFIC WITHOUT A REFUGE ISLAND AND WITH TURNING TRAFFIC. I BELIEVE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ON FLETCHER, WE HAVE CROSSWALK SIGNS, AND THEN ABOUT 20 OR 30 FEET LATER, WE HAVE A CROSSWALK PAINTED. THAT TROUBLES ME ALSO, BUT I AM NOT AN ENGINEER, AND THAT IS WHY I ASKED FOR AN ENGINEER TO DO THIS ASSESSMENT. THANK YOU.
01:32:27.100: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE COMMENT ABOUT INSUBORDINATION. AS I SAID BEFORE, THE GOAL HERE WAS TO TRY AND ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT COUNCIL HAD ESTABLISHED, AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE HAD. THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN OPEN. IT'S BEEN RECEPTIVE, TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT COUNCIL ESTABLISHED IN THE RESOLUTION. AS I SAID, THERE IS NOTHING HERE BUT GOOD INTENTIONS AND A SHARED DESIRE TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL RIGHT-OF-WAY USERS. IF COUNCIL DOESN'T WANT TO ADOPT THIS, THEN I WOULD ASK YOU GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK, AND WE'LL RE-WRITE IT. BUT THERE'S NOTHING INSUBORDINATE HERE. THIS IS A DESIRE TO ADVANCE COUNCIL'S GOALS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER TO ACHIEVE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE TRAVELING PUBLIC.
01:33:21.855: >> I MOVE TO POSTPONE.
01:33:25.292: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS ON THE QUEUE.
01:33:28.261: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  MY CONCERNS ARE SOLELY -- (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) --
01:33:31.498: >> SHE HAD THE FLOOR.
01:33:34.101: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SHE DID NOT. SHE RE --
01:33:40.640: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER EATON IS RIGHT. I BELIEVE THE COUNCILMEMBER HAD THE FLOOR, AND OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR -- WASN'T SHE SPEAKING?
01:33:54.955: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I VIEWED HER AS RELINQUISHING THE FLOOR, MR. LAZARUS AS HAVING BEEN FAIRLY PLAINLY ADDRESSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND, AND THEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THE QUEUE.
01:34:06.533: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK OUT OF LINE.
01:34:10.337: >> MAY I QUICKLY SAY ONE THING? AND THAT IS THAT I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH MR. LAZARUS FOLLOWING THE LAST TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MEETING, AND AT THAT POINT, HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS ASKING FOR AND AGREED TO IT, BUT THE FOLLOWING DAY, I GOT AN EMAIL THAT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
01:34:33.727: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL -- PARDON ME, FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:34:38.231: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. YEAH, SO MY CONCERN IS FINANCIAL, AND I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION THAT I DIDN'T GET INTO OUR QUESTION. SO THIS CONTRACT FOR $357,000, SO LIKE A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT, DID THAT HAVE A CONTINGENCY BUILT INTO IT? LIKE WE WOULD WITH THE SURVEYING OR CONSTRUCTION TYPE CONTRACT? THAT WAS LIKE A FIXED-COST CONTRACT.  AND SO WE ASKED THEM TO DO THIS ONE THING, AND SO THEN THEY ARE SAYING, HEY, IT'S ANOTHER FIVE GRAND TO DO THAT. SO IT'S NOT REALLY A $5,000 QUESTION. IT'S A $357,000 QUESTION THAT WE ARE ASKING THEM TO BASICALLY HAVE A 1% CONTINGENCY OVER AS WORK FLOW OR WHATEVER. I AM SURE MR. SCHWARTZ CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS, BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS TO BILL HOURS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY A COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE PROJECT WOULDN'T HAVE INCLUDED A COMPLETE ASSESSMENT OF OUR CROSS-WALKS AND OTHER PEDESTRIAN AND BIKING FACILITIES. I DON'T GET WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR THIS. WHY WASN'T THAT PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE PROJECT? IT SEEMS IT'S NOT COMPREHENSIVE, IF IT DIDN'T INCLUDE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
01:35:43.563: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:35:44.431: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. SO I WAS PREPARED TO VOTE AGAINST THIS THIS EVENING, BUT I BELIEVE THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD WOULD RATHER POSTPONE THIS, SO I'M GOING TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS AND ASK STAFF TO BRING SOMETHING BACK THAT ACTUALLY DIRECTLY RESPONDS TO THE RESOLUTION THAT THE ENTIRE COUNCIL PASSED, AND I AM UNPREPARED TO SPEND EXTRA MONEY ON THIS ENGINEER -- ENGINEERING FIRM TELLING US ABOUT OUR STAFFING. SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL GET A RESPONSE TO RESOLUTION R-19 -460, AND SO TO THAT END, I MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING I SUPPOSE.
01:36:31.978: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:36:35.415: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU. SO, I'M LOOKING AT THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS, AND I'M JUST WONDERING -- THIS WILL INFLUENCE MY DECISION ON POSTPONEMENT -- COULD YOU SPEAK TO THE SCOPE OF WORK, SPECIFICALLY ITEM NUMBER THREE? IT WAS OUTLINED FOR US, BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LOOKING AT THE STAFFING RESOURCES.
01:37:07.314: >> RIGHT. [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ] -- TRANSPORTATION MANAGER. SO, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO DELIVER WHAT COUNCIL PASSED. WE HAVE KIND OF A MENU OF THREE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT RANGE IN COST, AND SO THE FIRST OPTION IS KIND OF A NO-COST OPTION, JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS' WORTH OF WORK. THE SECOND OPTION IS THE ONE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, AN ANALYSIS OF STAFF CAPABILITIES AND WHAT MAYBE THOSE GAPS IN STAFFING ARE, ABOUT A WEEK'S WORTH OF WORK AT ABOUT $5,000. TASK THREE, AS IDENTIFIED, IS THE ONE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PRESENTED TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION BACK IN NOVEMBER. WE DEVELOPED THIS IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE CONSULTANT, SAM SCHWARTZ, IN THE THOUGHT PROCESS THAT THIS WOULD DELIVER WHAT YOU WERE ASKING FOR. I MEAN EVEN THE TITLE OF THE SCOPE SAYS CITY PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND IT IS A FAIRLY EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST BULLET TALKS ABOUT AN INVENTORY, THEN REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALL RESOURCES AND PROCESSES, BEST PRACTICE REVIEW OF PEER CITIES, DEVELOP AN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE REPORT IS INCLUDED, AND THEN SEVERAL MEETINGS AND PRESENTATIONS TO FOLLOW. THE DELIVERABLE WOULD BE A TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM, IN ADDITION TO THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN, WOULD INVOLVE AN INTERVIEW OF SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS AND CITY OFFICIALS. THERE WOULD BE A MEMORANDUM SUMMARIZING ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN GATHERED AND THE BEST PRACTICES AND THE KEY FINDINGS OF THE INTERVIEWS, AND THEN THERE WOULD BE THE REPORT THAT'S ISSUED AS PART OF THAT. THAT'S ROUGHLY 206 HOURS, AS IDENTIFIED BY THE CONSULTANT, WHICH BRINGS THE COST TO $26,200. AGAIN, WHEN WE PRESENTED THIS TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IN NOVEMBER, WE THOUGHT THIS WAS, YOU KNOW, THE OPTION THAT WAS SATISFYING WHAT COUNCIL HAD INITIALLY PASSED IN THE RESOLUTION. BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT PRICE TAG, WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WISE TO GIVE YOU OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL, AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU, IS THESE THREE OPTIONS. ANY AND ALL OF THEM ARE VIABLE, AS STAFF OBVIOUSLY WOULD SUPPORT ANY OF THEM AND SUPPORT THE CONSULTANT IN THEIR EFFORT TO DEVELOP THOSE, BUT IT'S -- YOU KNOW, WE LOOK TO YOU FOR THE DIRECTION IN TERMS OF WHICH ONE OF THESE YOU THINK SATISFIES THE INTENT OF THAT RESOLUTION. MY ONLY REQUEST BACK TO YOU WOULD BE IS IF TASK THREE DOES NOT MEET THE INTENT OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED IN THE RESOLUTION, MAYBE SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO US SO THAT WE CAN COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT MEETS YOUR INTENT. THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IN THE RESOLUTION IS KIND OF A ONE-LINER, SO WHEN WE DEVELOP SEVERAL PAGES WORTH OF SCOPE, WE HOPED WE HAD ADDRESSED THAT, BUT IF WE DIDN'T, SOME CLARITY WOULD BE HELPFUL SO THAT WAY WE CAN DELIVER YOU WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE.
01:40:06.526: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING UP WITH THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS. I DON'T LIKE AMENDING CONTRACTS, BUT CLEARLY YOU WERE RESPONDING TO THE COUNCIL RESOLUTION, AND NUMBER THREE SEEMS TO DO THAT MOST COMPREHENSIVELY. SO, THANKS.
01:40:17.937: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:40:19.606: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. AND THIS SPEAKS TO OPTION THREE IN THE POSTPONEMENT AND THE NEED FOR IT, PERHAPS, THAT, YOU KNOW, SPENDING THE 5,000 ON OPTION TWO JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT DID A WHOLE LOT, WHERE WHEN YOU SEE ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT WILL BE DELIVERED WITH OPTION THREE, IT SEEMS LIKE IT GETS US CLOSER TO WHAT WE WERE ASKING FOR, AT LEAST. I WILL TALK WITH MY COLLEAGUES OFFLINE TO REALLY SEE IF THERE'S THAT SAME SENTIMENT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I WOULD RATHER SPEND THE FULL AMOUNT AND GET WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR, RATHER THAN JUST THROW SOME MONEY INTO THE WIND, AS OPTION TWO SEEMS TO BE DOING. SO, THANK YOU, AND THANKS FOR THE -- YOU KNOW, TAKING THE TIME AND EXPLAINING HOW THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS, WHAT THEY DELIVER.
01:41:12.859: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:41:17.564: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  WITH REGARD TO STAFF'S REQUEST FOR SOME SENSE OF DIRECTION, I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN OPTION THREE, THAT THE SECOND BULLET POINT, TALKING ABOUT EVALUATING STAFF LEVELS AND SUCH REALLY IS NOT WITHIN THE, I DON'T BELIEVE, SCOPE OF THE PREVIOUS RESOLUTION, AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL SAVE US SOME MONEY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE SCOPE OF WORK DOESN'T REALLY FIT THE EVALUATION OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE, I HOPE THAT IT WOULD BE CULLED, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE POSTPONEMENT WITH THOSE KIND OF THINGS IN MIND.
01:42:01.140: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT?
01:42:05.078: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: WHEN'S THE DATE?
01:42:06.379: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  TO THE NEXT MEETING. ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ]. OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. CA-17 -- MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION PLEASE OF CA-17. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:42:32.705: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I JUST -- I -- SO I HAD A HECK OF A WEEK, AND I DIDN'T GET QUESTIONS IN ON TIME TO THE AGENDA, AND I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT REALLY BOTH OF THEM, CA-17 AND CA-18, I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND JUST IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE -- AND I APPRECIATE WE ARE VOTING ON THESE SEPARATELY, BUT I AM JUST CURIOUS, ARE THE SERVICE THAT WE ARE GETTING FROM CA-17 ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE SERVICES THAT WE ARE GETTING FROM CA-18.
01:43:00.433: >> CRAIG HUPY, PUBLIC SERVICES AREA ADMINISTRATOR. I'M GOING TO LET NICK HUTCHINSON, THE CITY ENGINEER, DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES.
01:43:08.441: >> NICK HUTCHINSON, CITY ENGINEER. NO, THEY ARE THE SAME SERVICES. WHEN WE DID AN R.F.P. FOR THESE SERVICES TWO YEARS AGO, A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, WE SELECTED THREE FIRMS AND APPROVED CONTRACTS WITH ALL OF THEM. THEY HAD -- THE INTENT WAS THOSE CONTRACTS WOULD BE GOOD FOR THREE YEARS, AND WE HAD TO DO AN AMENDMENT IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN, AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEFORE US HERE, BUT THEY ARE THE SAME SERVICES. WE USUALLY HIRE MORE THAN ONE CONSULTING FIRM TO DO THAT, JUST SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH FIRMS AVAILABLE TO US, THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH WORKFORCE TO COVER ALL OF OUR NEEDS.
01:43:53.853: >> OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT. THANKS FOR THAT. BECAUSE AS I WAS READING THESE ITEMS, IT MADE ME QUESTION DO WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK THAT IT'S MORE THAN ONE CONSULTANT CAN HANDLE.
01:44:04.430: >> YES, WE DO.
01:44:04.964: >> WOW. AND IS THERE ANY -- IS IT TRULY SO SEASONAL AND FLUCTUATING THAT THERE IS NO VALUE TO SIMPLY ADDING CITY STAFF FOR THIS?
01:44:16.642: >> ADDING CITY STAFF WOULD HELP TO SOME DEGREE, BUT IT'S A VERY SEASONAL NATURE, BEING THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTION WORK. OUR CONSTRUCTION SEASON IS KIND OF LIMITED TO GENERALLY APRIL THROUGH NOVEMBER, AND WE DO HAVE WORK THAT OUR OWN INSPECTORS CAN DO DURING THIS TIME, BUT HIRING THIS MANY ADDITIONAL INSPECTORS, IT WOULD BE HARD TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY DURING THE WINTER.
01:44:36.629: >> OKAY.
01:44:36.929: >> AND, YEAH.
01:44:39.432: >> THANK YOU. I AM DONE. THAT WAS ALL I HAD TO SAY ABOUT CA-17 OR CA-18. THANKS.
01:44:47.807: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:44:50.576: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WHILE WE HAVE GOT YOU UP THERE, DOES THE SEASONAL ASPECT APPLY TO CA-19 THAT'S COMING BEFORE US IN A HOT SECOND HERE? ARE THOSE ALSO CONSIDERED SEASONAL?
01:44:59.318: >> NO. THOSE ARE -- THOSE ARE FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, NOT --
01:45:08.361: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAR ROUND.
01:45:09.295: >> THAT'S FOR ENGINEERING SERVICES, NOT INSPECTION, SO THOSE SERVICES ARE SEASONAL.
01:45:14.333: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I THOUGHT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TIED TO ROAD WORK OR SOMETHING THAT'S SEASONAL.
01:45:18.171: >> NO, IT'S FOR ENGINEERING WORK, WHICH IS MORE YEAR ROUND.
01:45:23.209: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. CA-18 -- MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA-18.
01:45:39.826: >> I'M GOOD, THANKS.
01:45:42.695: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU, FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. CA-TEN -- AND ENGAGEMENT SUPPORT IN THE AMOUNT OF $150,000 PER YEAR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA-TEN. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:46:04.350: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, THANK YOU. I JUST PULLED THIS OFF BECAUSE I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS. I UNDERSTAND IT COMES OUT OF OUR NEED TO EDUCATE THE POPULACE ABOUT STORM WATER AND SO ON, BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WE INTERNALLY HAVE HAD A SLIGHT GROWTH IN THAT DEPARTMENT HERE AT THE CITY THAT HANDLES PR AND MARKETING AND THINGS LIKE THAT, SO I JUST WONDERED WHY WE ARE IN FOR 150,000 A YEAR FOR TWO YEARS, TO MARKET OUTSIDE SOLUTIONS FOR US. IS THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR US?
01:46:43.356: >> CRAIG HUPY AGAIN. I'LL START OFF WITH THE ANSWER, BUT THEN I'LL DEFER TO OUR BUDGET SUPERVISOR AND POTENTIALLY MARTI PRASCHAN, OUR CHIEF OF STAFF. THE AMOUNT OF WORK IN THE -- AND THE NATURE OF THE WORK IS NOT, WE ARE NOT STAFFED TO DO THAT AMOUNT OF WORK AND TYPE OF WORK, BUT I'LL LET LYNN SPEAK TO THE DETAILS.
01:47:15.621: >> SO THE SERVICES THAT THIS CONTRACTOR INTENDED TO MEET IS THAT WE HAD A LEVEL OF SERVICE INCREASE, SO ABOVE OUR BASE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THE STORMWATER STUDY THAT WAS DONE IN 2016, AND THE CURRENT PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST FOR ALL OF THE UTILITIES JUST SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THE WORK ABOVE THE BASE BUDGET FOR THIS CONTRACT, SO IT'S FOR CONTINUING THE STORMWATER SMART CAMPAIGN THAT WAS STARTED IN 2018 AND A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO GETTING A LOT OF OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT RELATED TO STORMWATER CREDITS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE DONE.
01:47:59.966: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IS PART OF THE WORK DESCRIPTION TO MEASURE THE EFFICACY OF THEIR ACTIONS SOMEHOW?
01:48:03.603: >> YES, ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHY WE MADE IT A TASK-BASED CONTRACT, BECAUSE WE STARTED FURTHERING AND APPROVING WORK STATEMENTS TO BE DONE THROUGH THIS CONTRACT, WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD PERFORMANCE METRICS ESTABLISHED, AND THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN THEIR OWN FIELD TO HELP US DEVELOP THOSE AS WELL.
01:48:21.687: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. I GUESS I'LL JUST SHARE THIS. THIS IS NOT ENTIRELY ANECDOTAL, BUT LOTS OF FOLKS IN WARD 1 HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT STORMWATER ISSUES, ESPECIALLY WITH ALL OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENT. I HAVE DONE WHAT I CAN WITH TWO GARDENS AND THREE RAIN BARRELS, AND SO I HAVE GOT THIS CREDIT ON MY BILL, AND IT'S LIKE MICROSCOPIC, YOU KNOW, AND SO I JUST -- I WONDER HOW MUCH MORE COMPLIANCE WE'D GET WITH THESE NEEDS IF WE UPPED OUR DISCOUNTS TO PEOPLE TO REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BUY INTO THIS NOTION THAT THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY TO THEIR STORMWATER CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY, BECAUSE, I MEAN -- I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO IT. I NEEDED TO DO IT. IT WAS GOOD FOR MY FOUNDATION TO DO IT, SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THEY ARE GOING TO BE TELLING PEOPLE TO DO AND MORE PEOPLE TO DO AND SO ON, AND THAT'S THE HOPE, RIGHT? THAT WE ROPE IN MORE RESIDENTS TO MAKE THESE INDIVIDUAL STORMWATER CONTRIBUTIONS?
01:49:19.979: >> YEAH, TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MAKE THE ACTIONS TO GET THE STORMWATER CREDITS SO THAT THEY ARE SORT OF A CRITICAL MASS AND WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE STORMWATER SYSTEM.
01:49:35.394: >> DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT PROGRAM, PERCENTAGE-WISE?
01:49:40.032: >> I DON'T HAVE THAT EXACT FIGURE.
01:49:41.300: >> SO IF IT WAS LIKE 10%, AND OUR GOAL WAS 25%, I WOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE WORTH IT, BUT IF IT WAS 10% AND THEY COME OUT WITH 12%, I WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT WORTH IT.
01:49:53.512: >> WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE NUMBER OF CREDITS BEING OFFERED.
01:49:58.250: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I AM JUST CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IT WAS. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO SET A METRIC. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU PURCHASE A CUSTOMER, WHEN YOU MARKET YOUR BUSINESS TO A CUSTOMER, WHAT'S YOUR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST? SO WHAT'S OUR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST GOING TO BE IF WE SPEND $150,000? HOW MANY PEOPLE GET ON BOARD, THAT TELLS US WHAT OUR COST IS. BEFORE WE RENEW THE CONTRACT FOR THE SECOND YEAR, I THINK WE SHOULD SEE THAT. I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE FOR MY COLLEAGUES.
01:50:30.983: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. CA-12, RESOLUTION TO ACCEPT AND APPROPRIATE A $50,000.00 CONNECTING COMMUNITIES GRANT AWARD FROM WASHTENAW COUNTY PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION FOR TREELINE ALIGNMENT STUDY MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA-12. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:50:56.976: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I THOUGHT WE HAD 11 AND 12 BECAUSE THEY ARE PAIRED. I THOUGHT I ASKED TO MOVE 11 ALSO.
01:51:04.683: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I HAD NOT WRITTEN 11. AND I --
01:51:11.423: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WHAT'S THAT? [ OFF MIC ]. DON'T WE NEED TO? YEAH, THESE TWO ARE TIED TOGETHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR 11 AND 12, RIGHT? THIS ALIGNMENT STUDY -- THE GRANT IN 12, EXCEPT THE COUNTY GRANT, IS BOUND WITH CA-11. IT EVEN SAID THAT IN OUR NOTES.
01:51:32.077: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I BELIEVED WE VOTED ON --
01:51:35.948: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I ASKED TO HAVE 11 MOVED.
01:51:38.584: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE CAN MOVE TO RECONSIDER IT.
01:51:41.821: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I MEAN, THEY ARE TIED.
01:51:46.225: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DO YOU WISH TO MOVE TO RECONSIDER IT? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? I GUESS LET'S WITHDRAW CA-12 FROM CONSIDERATION BY FIAT AND MOVE TO CA-11, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH EVERYONE. RESOLUTION TO APPROPRIATE $35,000.00 FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND APPROVE A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH SMITHGROUP FOR TREELINE ALIGNMENT STUDY (RFP #19-21, $74,850.00) MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA-11. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:52:19.258: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO, CA-11 AND CA-12 ARE TIED TOGETHER, INASMUCH AS WE EVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS TIED TOGETHER, AND CA-11, IT'S AN ASK FOR 35,000 FROM THE GENERAL FUND OUTSIDE THE BUDGET CYCLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ALIGNMENT STUDY, AND CA-19, WHICH IS ALSO COMING UP, IS $1.1 MILLION IN SURVEYING AND ENGINEERING SERVICES, WHICH IS WHAT THIS 35,000 IS GOING FOR TO A FOURTH VENDOR, AND SO MY QUESTIONS ARE MULTIPLE. ONE IS WHY DON'T WE DO THIS WITH AN EXISTING VENDOR. TWO, WHY ISHAT WE ARE APPROPRIATING GENERAL FUND MONEY FOR WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS A PRIVATE PARK THAT'S GOING TO COME UP WITH ALL OF THIS PRIVATE FUNDING AND JUST LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE KEEP HEARING, IS THERE IS NO MONEY FOR PARKS IN OUR CITIES, AND WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON PARKS, BUT THIS ONE HERE IS GETTING 35,000 OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND OUT OF THE BUDGET CYCLE, TO MOVE FORWARD THIS ALIGNMENT STUDY, WHICH IS ONLY A PARTIAL STUDY OF THIS, FROM WHAT I MET WITH THE TREELINE FOLKS, AND THEY SAID IT WAS, YOU KNOW, JUST FOR THE NORTHERN PART OF THIS OR THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS THIS TRAIL, AND SO WHAT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE A $55 MILLION, SUPPOSEDLY, TRAIL, AND SO I WONDER IF IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE TAKING GENERAL FUND MONEY AND THROWING IT AT THIS WHEN WE KEEP BEING TOLD THAT PRIVATE MONEY IS HOW PARKS ARE GOING TO BE FUNDED IN THE CORE OF THE CITY. I HEAR IT ALL THE TIME FROM SOME COLLEAGUES. I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS APPROPRIATE.
01:53:54.787: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:54:00.192: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TREELINE MASTER PLAN, IT IDENTIFIES A LAUNDRY LIST OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THE TREELINE URBAN TRAIL, AND ONE OF THOSE SOURCES IS ACTUALLY GENERAL FUND MONEY, AND SO THIS IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH IT. I TYPICALLY OPPOSE BUDGET AMENDMENTS OUT OF THE BUDGET CYCLE, BUT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE GENERAL FUND MONEY -- WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THIS LITTLE BIT OF GENERAL FUND MONEY, BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED A GRANT THAT THEY HAD NOT EXPECTED, AND IF WE DON'T OFFER THIS MONEY, WE MAY, IN FACT, LOSE THAT GRANT OPPORTUNITY. SO, I'M MAKING EXCEPTION TO MY USUAL SKEPTICISM OF FUNDING THINGS OUTSIDE THE CYCLE, AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT BOTH OF THESE. THANK YOU.
01:55:01.854: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:55:03.255: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU TO THE STAFF INVOLVED AND THANK YOU, TOO, TO THE CONSERVANCY THAT'S BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY ALONGSIDE. I THINK A CRITICAL DIFFERENCE WITH THIS AND WHY I'M EXCITED TO SUPPORT IT IS WE HAVE A LONG-TERM PLAN FOR HOW WE WANT TO REALIZE THE SUCCESS OF THIS NEW PARK FACILITY. IT'S A PLAN THAT WE HAVE INVESTED IN AND BEEN DILIGENT ABOUT OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE-PLUS, AND THIS -- THE PRIVATE, YOU KNOW, VOLUNTEERS HAVE WORKED WITH CITY STAFF TO FIND GRANT FUNDING FOR $50,000, MORE THAN HALF OF THIS PROJECT. SO I THINK THIS IS, YOU KNOW, AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE. I THINK IT'S PART OF A LONG-TERM PLAN, AND JUST A VISION OF WHAT COULD BE ON THE NEAR WEST SIDE OF TOWN THAT I THINK EXCITES EVERYONE. SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT.
01:55:55.908: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:55:56.809: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YOU HAVE ALL HEARD MY SERMONS ON BUDGET AMENDMENTS, AND I GENERALLY DON'T SUPPORT BUDGET AMENDMENTS. I SEE FOLKS SMILING. I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST A FISCAL DISCIPLINARY GUIDING PRINCIPLE THAT I WOULD LIKE US ALL TO SEE EMBRACE. ON THIS, AND THIS IS NOT A -- YOU KNOW, NECESSARILY AN EMERGENCY, BUT I DO THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED US IN RESPONSE TO -- I DID ACTUALLY ASK ABOUT FUND-RAISING EFFORTS, AND ALSO LAST WEEK, I APPRECIATE THAT MR. HERBERT CAME TO MY COFFEE AND WALKED ME THROUGH WHY THIS IS NECESSARY. BOTTOM LINE, THIS STUDY WILL ALLOW THEM TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE -- MORE COMPREHENSIVE COST ESTIMATE, AND I SEE MS. SEEFIRTH HERE AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO OFFER MORE INFORMATION. I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL WITH THE CONSERVANCY, AND PARTICULARLY WITH THIS STUDY AND THIS AGREEMENT THAT'S NOW BEFORE US FOR CONSIDERATION. SO, THEY HAVE BEEN FUND-RAISING, AND THEY HAVE A LIST IN THE RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION, WHAT THESE EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED, AND I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE EFFORTS, AND FRANKLY, IN ORDER FOR THEM TO APPROACH DONORS, THEY NEED THIS INFORMATION. THEY NEED THIS COST INFORMATION, AND SO THEY CAN PITCH -- THEY HAVE SEVERAL THAT ARE GOOD PROSPECTS, KIND OF ON HOLD RIGHT NOW, THAT THEY ARE NOT AT THIS MOMENT PURSUING, BECAUSE THEY LACK THIS KIND OF INFORMATION, THAT ANY PROSPECTIVE DONOR WOULD UNDERSTANDABLY REQUIRE. SO, THIS WILL HELP THEM MOVE THAT -- MOVE THE BALL FORWARD IN THE DIRECTION WE ALL SUPPORT, SO I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS, AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY HAS HIRED ANCUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE NECESSARY FUND-RAISING EXPERTISE, AND THAT WAS PAID FOR WITH PRIVATE MONEY THAT THEY RAISED. SO THEY ARE RAISING FUNDS PRIVATELY TO LEVERAGE THIS KIND OF CONTRIBUTION, AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT.
01:58:28.827: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:58:30.028: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. MUCH OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID, SO I WON'T REPEAT IT. I DO THINK WHEN WE HAVE A BUDGET AMENDMENT, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN 8-VOTE THRESHOLD. I JUST WANT TO COMMEND STAFF AND THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY FOR DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE ASKING THEM TO DO, WHICH IS ENGAGE IN A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND HELP THEM LEVERAGE FUNDS. IT'S TERRIFIC. THEY ARE GIVING US MORE THAN WE ARE PUTTING IN, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A CALCULUS THAT I WILL ALWAYS, YOU KNOW, HAPPILY SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT. SO I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE GROUP AND ON HIRING AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND STAFF AND ALSO THANK THE COUNTY, BECAUSE THIS IS A TERRIFIC PARTNERSHIP, AND THIS PROJECT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, AND I KNOW THAT COMMENT WAS LIKELY DIRECTED AT ME ABOUT SUPPORTING FUNDS AND USING PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THINGS LIKE THIS, AND IF OTHER GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE SAID THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE US MONEY WANT TO GIVE US THIS MUCH MONEY AND ASK US TO HELP THEM LEVERAGE SOME GRANTS, THEN I WILL GLADLY GET ON BOARD FOR THAT.
01:59:45.470: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. LAZARUS?
01:59:46.872: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THIS INTO A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AND MAYBE TAKE A BROADER VIEW. THIS SPRING, THE CITY WILL START CONSTRUCTION OF THE TUNNELLING UNDERNEATH THE RAILROAD TRACKS, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ALLEN CREEK BERM OPENING. SO IF WE START DOWN AT THE RIVERSIDE, WE HAVE A PROJECT THAT'S FUNDED PRIMARILY WITH FEDERAL MONEY AND IS WITH STATE MONEYS WITH VERY LITTLE CITY MONEY TO GET US UNDER THE RIVER, UNDERNEATH THE RAILROAD TRACKS UP THROUGH WHEELER PARK. ON THE OTHER SIDE, TREELINE HAS BOUGHT A PIECE OF PROPERTY, WHICH WILL BE THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY, WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE PLAN. BUT SHORT TERM, AS WE GO THROUGH 721 NORTH MAIN, THIS GETS US UP TO THE RIGHT-OF-WAY WE RESERVED WITH THE KINGSLEY CONDOS, AND THEN THAT CONNECTS UP TO FIRST STREET. NEXT YEAR, THE DDA WILL START THE PROTECTED LANES ON FIRST STREET, WHICH WILL GET A BIKER AND A WALKER, REALLY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MADISON. SO THAT FIRST PORTION OF THE TREELINE IS BEING PIECED TOGETHER, PRIMARILY WITH OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS BESIDES THE GENERAL FUND. WHAT MS. SEYFARTH DID IS SHE APPLIED TO THE COUNTY FOR A GRANT. THAT IS THE GRANT ACCEPTANCE THAT IS CA-12. THE MAIN PURPOSE IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ACROSS NORTH MAIN STREET IN THE SAFEST WAY FOR PEOPLE DRIVING CARS. WE ARE FILLING IN A GAP TO PROVIDE A CONNECTED PATH THROUGH THE HURON RIVER, THROUGH THE DTE PROPERTY, THROUGH THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND ALL THE WAY OUT. WHEN YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK, MOST OF THAT IS NOT FUNDED WITH CITY FUNDS, AND IT'S REALLY BEEN A MASTERFUL EFFORT BY THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY AND CITY STAFF TO GET US A PORTION OF THAT TRAIL IN PLACE QUICKLY, WHICH HELPS BUILD COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND THEREFORE HELPS WITH THE FUND-RAISING EFFORT. SO THAT'S SORT OF A BIGGER PICTURE. THINK THIS IS A KEY PA IT, AND IT SHOULD ALL BE CELEBRATED. WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT.
02:01:59.237: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:02:00.405: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO SOMETIMES THESE THINGS COME OFF THE CONSENT AGENDA SO THAT WE CAN HAVE PUBLIC CONVERSATIONS. IT'S THE ONLY REASON, NOT THAT THEY ARE ESPECIALLY OPPOSED BY ANYBODY OR THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S ALL BEHIND IT. I HAVE MET WITH MR. NEIL AND HERBERT AND HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS NOW, SO I'M WELL AWARE OF WHERE THIS THING IS HEADED. I GUESS THE GENERAL QUESTIONS THAT I HAD SURROUND THIS CONSTANT NOTION THAT WE AS A BODY ARE HIRING OUT TO CONSULTANTS, AND ALL OF THE ENGINEERS IN THIS TOWN ARE GETTING RICH OFF THE CITY.  AND DON'T WE HAVE ONE OR TWO PARKS PLANNERS ON STAFF? DON'T WE HAVE SURVEYOR AND IS ENGINEERS THAT ARE ON RETAINER, SUCH AS IT IS, THAT WE COULD BE DOING THIS WORK? WE DON'T HAVE TO HIRE ANOTHER PERSON, ANOTHER COMPANY. SO IT'S A GENERAL QUESTION AS TO THAT KIND OF USE OF FUNDS. WE HAVE PARKS PLANNERS, DON'T WE, MR. LAZARUS?
02:02:50.188: >> WE DO, BUT THIS IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING PROJECT, AND IT IS A STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING PROJECT. CITY STAFF, I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GO THROUGH THE WORKLOAD, THE C.I.P. AND THE WORK THAT'S COMING UP. WE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED TO IMPROVE THE ROADWAY CONDITIONS FOR ALL USERS THAT WE HAVE TO MEET A CERTAIN PAVEMENT QUALITY INDEX. THAT WORK IS ONGOING.
02:03:11.610: >> BUT I MEAN FOR PARKS, DO WE HAVE PARKS PLANNERS ON STAFF, JULIE, MS. GRAND?
02:03:17.849: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ANSWER THAT?
02:03:19.818: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, YOU ARE PARKS.
02:03:22.187: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  AS YOU ARE LIAISON TO THAT GROUP AS WELL.
02:03:25.223: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, BUT I MEAN HISTORICALLY, RIGHT?
02:03:29.160: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  IF WE UNDERSTAND THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR PARKS, WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY ON TOPIC RIGHT NOW, HILLARY HANSELL AND HER GROUP ARE QUITE BUSY WITH THE WORK THAT THEY DO, BECAUSE THEY ARE DEALING WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM ALL OF OUR PARKS, WHICH ARE AT LEAST 40 YEARS OLD.
02:03:49.281: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WHEN WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TASK FORCE THAT IS COMING BACK, SHOULD WE BE COUNTING OUT THAT WE ARE USING PARKS PLANNERS FOR THIS? SHOULD THE FOLKS WHICH PART TO BE PART OF THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY, A VOTER APPROVED MEASURE TO CREATE A PARK OR A COMMONS, SHOULD WE BE -- IS THAT APPROPRIATE TO THINK?
02:04:18.476: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THAT ITEM IS NOT ON THE AGENDA, BUT I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS AS WE SEE THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES THAT THE TASK FORCE COMES FORWARD WITH, WE'LL DEVELOP THE PATH FORWARD. WHEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO COUNCIL DIRECTION FOR US TO START SETTING FUNDS ASIDE TO DEVELOP THOSE CONCEPTS, SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE SAME DEGREE OF DILIGENCE AND CREATIVITY IN FINDING FUNDING SOURCES FOR THAT PART OF THE CHARTER AND THAT COUNCIL DIRECTION THAT WE HAVE GOT.
02:04:52.577: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I KNOW, BECAUSE MS. SEYFARTH IS ON BOTH OF THOSE AND SERVING US WELL IN THOSE CAPACITIES.
02:05:02.754: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  AS EXCEPTIONAL AS SHE IS, SHE HAS A CERTAIN BANDWIDTH THAT WE CAN'T EXCEED.
02:05:07.425: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-11? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:05:10.228: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, AND I APPRECIATE STAFF'S WORK ON THIS, AND I GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH NORM AND JOE LAST WEEK TO GET CAUGHT UP, AND TO REALLY LEARN A LOT IN THE 45 MINUTES WE MET. YOU KNOW, I WILL HAVE TO SAY, WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY TRYING TO DO AND LEAVE SOMETHING BEHIND. THE COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IS JUST THE LACK OF CONSISTENCY, AND I'M -- I TRY TO BE CONSISTENT, WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME OR DON'T AGREE WITH ME, AT LEAST I TRY TO BE CONSISTENT WITH IT. BUT THERE IS SOME EXCEPTIONALISM EXHIBITED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND EXCEPTIONALISM IS SOMETHING I DON'T BELIEVE IN. SO, THEREFORE, I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS AND THESE POLICIES THAT BRING COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND COMMUNITY GOOD AND THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE COMMUNITY, AND I BELIEVE WE CAN FIND THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU.
02:06:28.907: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS AS WELL. I AM DELIGHTED THAT THE -- ALL OF THE GOOD WORK THAT THE DECADE OR DECADES, OR, YOU KNOW, MORE THAN A DECADE OLD LONG WORK BEING DONE BY THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY. IN MY VIEW, THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION THAT HAD A VISION FOR A STRUCTURAL OVEMENT TO THE CITY, FOR THE GOOD OF ALL. IT IS A PRACTICAL VISION. IT IS A LONG-TERM VISION, AND THEY ARE DILIGENTLY AND PROFESSIONALLY GOING FORWARD IN HELPING US MAKE IT HAPPEN, AND I AM DELIGHTED TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THAT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:07:13.151: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS, BUT I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING CONSISTENCY, AND ARE WE TRACKING THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF STAFF TIME WORKING ON THE TREELINE SO THAT IT CAN BE BILLED TO AN ACCOUNT, OR IS THAT JUST COMMUNITY BENEFIT?
02:07:34.172: >> THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES.
02:07:39.778: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: OKAY. SO WILL THAT COME TO COUNCIL, OR IS THAT JUST GOING TO BE AN INFORMATION ITEM?
02:07:46.518: >> WE GENERALLY DON'T BRING INFORMATION LIKE THAT TO COUNCIL UNLESS THERE IS A REQUEST.
02:07:53.358: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: OKAY. I HAVE HAD SOME QUESTIONS FROM CONSTITUENTS, BUT I WILL DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THE QUESTION IS FIRST AND BRING IT IN WRITING.
02:08:01.633: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  WASN'T THAT TIME ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE CITY BUDGET THAT WAS ADOPTED LAST MAY?
02:08:06.337: >> YES. I HEARD YES FROM BEHIND ME.
02:08:08.973: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? CA-11 IS APPROVED WITH TEN COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE 8-VOTE CA12,REMENT. RESOLUTION TO ACCEPT AND APPROPRIATE A $50,000.00 CONNECTING COMMUNITIES GRANT AWARD FROM WASHTENAW COUNTY PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION FOR TREELINE ALIGNMENT STUDY MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF CA-12?
02:08:37.335: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: BECAUSE THOSE ARE TIED, I'LL JUST CALL THE QUESTION ON THAT.
02:08:43.474: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THE CALL OF THE QUESTION GIVES PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IF -- WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SPEAK? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ]. ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. CA-19, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF CA-19, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I BELIEVE.
02:09:22.714: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, I WAS JUST QUESTIONING WHAT THIS $1.1 MILLION IS GOING TO BE PUT TOWARDS. I KNOW THAT IT WAS IN OUR BUDGET TO DO THIS, AND IT STILL IS BETTER TO DO THESE PPSAs WITH OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS THAN IT IS TO DO WITH FOLKS INSIDE? THAT IS THE CASE, STILL, YEAR AFTER YEAR?
02:09:44.302: >> WHILE IT MAY SEEM LIKE YEAR AFTER YEAR, THERE IS FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR ON PROJECTS, SO THIS ALLOWS OUR STAFFING TO MEET THE PROJECT NEEDS AND ALSO BRING IN SPECIALIZED ENGINEERING THAT SOME SPECIFIC PROJECTS MAY REQUIRE.
02:10:05.156: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, OKAY. I JUST -- I -- IT'S -- IT'S MIND-BOGGLING HOW MUCH WE SPEND ON PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES AROUND HERE. IS THIS BECAUSE WE ARE ACTUALLY FIXING THE ROADS SO AWESOMELY NOW? THIS IS PART OF THAT? OUR ROAD REPAIR? I MEAN, WHAT IS THIS PRIMARILY GOING TOWARDS? THE PROJECTS ACROSS THE BOARD?
02:10:27.478: >> GENERALLY, YES, PROJECT ACROSS THE BOARD. IT WOULD BE WATER, SEWER, ROADS, STORMWATER. BUT I'LL LET NICK ANSWER IF HE HAS ANY PARTICULAR PROJECTS HE WANTS TO HIGHLIGHT.
02:10:43.461: >> YEAH, I DON'T HAVE ANY -- THERE'S NO SPECIFIC PROJECTS. IT'S AN AS-NEEDED. WE LIKE TO HAVE THESE SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR WHEN WE DO NEED THEM. AS CRAIG MENTIONED, OFTENTIMES THOSE ARE FOR THINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE STAFF EXPERTISE FOR ON STAFF, STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING, FOR EXAMPLE, LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE, A LOT OF TIMES TO SUPPLEMENT SOME OF OUR OWN PROJECTS. SURVEY SERVICES -- WHEN WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PROJECTS AND WE CAN'T GET EVERYTHING COVERED WITH OUR OWN STAFF, WE'LL HIRE -- YOU KNOW, BRING ONE OF THESE CONSULTANTS IN THAT WE HAVE READILY AVAILABLE TO HANDLE THE OVERFLOW, BASICALLY.
02:11:22.633: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. SO, BECAUSE THESE ARE IN UNDER THE PUBLIC SERVICES AREA, AND MR. HUPY THE PUBLIC SERVICES AREA ADMINISTRATOR, THESE CONSULTANTS ARE CHARGED WITH WORK, BILLABLE HOURS AGAINST PUBLIC PROJECTS SOLELY, IS THAT CORRECT?
02:11:39.984: >> CORRECT.
02:11:40.318: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. THERE'S NO FOOTING THE BILL FOR DEVELOPMENT (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) -- THIS IS ALL PUBLIC WORKS?
02:11:46.024: >> NO. THERE IS -- ONE OF THE TASKS THAT IS IN THEIR SCOPE IS FOR REVIEWING PLANS FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT, IF WE HAVE MORE THAN OUR CURRENT STAFF CAN HANDLE, BUT THOSE COSTS ARE OFFSET BY THE FEES TO THE DEVELOPERS.
02:12:02.640: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. THANK YOU. PEOPLE ASK ME THAT, SO I HAVE TO ASK, SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDU INDULGENCE.
02:12:12.450: >> IF I CAN ADD, LAST QUARTER, I SENT TO COUNCIL A REPORT ON THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. WE HAVE ALMOST $200 MILLION IN PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE C.I.P. THE OUTSIDE SUPPORT WE GET THROUGH ENGINEERING SERVICES, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF MAKING SURE THAT THE TAXPAYERS GET WHAT THEY PAY FOR AND TO DELIVER QUALITY PROJECTS. SOME OF THE WORK IS SEASONAL. SOME OF IT IS UNEVEN STAFFING, AND SOME OF IT IS GETTING EXPERTISE WE DON'T HAVE ON STAFF. A LONG TIME, MR. ACKERMAN TALKED ABOUT YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR WHO IS A GENERALIST, AND THEN YOU GET REFERRED TO A SPECIALIST. SINCE WE HAVE MADE THE MEDICAL ANALOGY BEFORE THIS EVENING, I THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE, THAT WE HAVE A GREAT STAFF WHO MANAGE THE WORK, WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE EASEMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE OTHER BACKGROUND FOR THE WORK THAT WE NEED DONE, BUT WE DO NEED SOME ADDITIONAL HELP TO FILL IN THE SPACES. SO THE TASK ORDERS ARE AWARDED PRUDENTLY, AND IT'S ALL ABOUT --
02:13:21.285: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  HAVE WE SEEN HISTORICALLY, I KNOW WE DON'T USE THEM TO THIS DEGREE EVERY YEAR, LIKE YOU POINTED OUT, HAVE WE SEEN HISTORICALLY THE RATES THAT GET BILLED AND APPROVED FROM THE ENGINEERS, HAS THAT CLIMBED AT ALL? HAS THAT PLAYED ANY ROLE IN OUR BURGEONING BUDGET AND LOOMING BUDGET DEFICITS?
02:13:42.673: >> I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THE LAST PART, BUT I CAN SAY, YES, THE RATES GO UP. COST FOR EVERYTHING GOES UP. CONSULTANTS ARE VERY BUSY RIGHT NOW. THEIR RATES CERTAINLY DO REFLECT THAT. WE TRY TO USE THESE JUDICIOUSLY, ONLY WHEN WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO, AND THERE'S BEEN REFERENCE TO A YEAR. I EXPECT THAT THESE CONTRACTS WILL LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS, ACTUALLY, THAT WE'LL BE USING THEM OVER THE COURSE OF THAT TIME.
02:14:10.034: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OUT OF THIS AMOUNT, THOUGH. OUT OF THIS AMOUNT. OKAY. SO THAT WILL CARRY OVER INTO FISCAL '21 AND SO ON?
02:14:19.277: >> CORRECT.
02:14:19.577: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:14:20.745: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:14:21.946: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THIS WAS BUDGETED WHEN WE APPROVED THE BUDGET. WE APPROVED SETTING ASIDE FUNDING, AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE R.P. PROCESS WAS ROBUST, LIKE SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, 12 FIRMS RESPONDED, AND THESE THREE FIRMS THAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING RANKED THE HIGHEST. SO THANK YOU.
02:14:43.634: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:14:45.236: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. JUST TO FURTHER THE POINT OF COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND TO FURTHER TRANSPARENCY, IF FOLKS ARE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE SPEND MONEY ON IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE, I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO GOOGLE ANN ARBOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANNING. THERE'S A LINK. IT WILL GO TO A FIVE-YEAR PLAN OF ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WITH DOLLARS ATTACHED TO THEM AND SOME DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO LEARN MORE, AS WELL AS KIND OF A PARKING LOT OF OTHER IDEAS FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OR INFRASTRUCTURE WE MAY SPEND MONEY ON. SO ALL OF THAT IS REALLY PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE CITY'S WEBSITE.
02:15:22.073: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ GAVEL ] WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE MINUTES OF THE REGULAR SESSION OF JANUARY 6, 2020. MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE PLEASE TO APPROVE THESE MINUTES? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? THE MINUTES ARE APPROVED. C1, AN ORDINANCE TO ADD A NEW CHAPTER 122 (HISTORIC ENTERTAINMENT SOUND DISTRICT) TO TITLE IX OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION OF C1? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:25:15.966: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  DUE TO THE HOLIDAYS AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FACTORS, THE OUTREACH TO THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS AND OUR ORGANIZATIONS HASN'T TAKEN PLACE, SO I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE POSTPONE THIS, BUT I'M GOING TO ASK THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR HOW LONG HE BELIEVES WE SHOULD POSTPONE THIS FOR.
02:25:35.752: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. I HAVE A DISTINGUISHED VISITOR IN MR. DELACOURT TO EXPLAIN REALLY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND WHAT OTHER TIME THEY NEED.
02:25:44.528: >> YEAH, FIRST OF ALL, I APPRECIATE THAT LAST TIME I WAS UP HERE, I THINK I WAS A BIT OVERCONFIDENT ABOUT HOW QUICKLY WE COULD DO THAT OUTREACH, AND THAT HAS COME BACK TO BITE ME, AND I WILL READILY ADMIT THAT. SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. I HAVE HAD MEETINGS WITH OTHER RESIDENCES AND SCHEDULED MORE MEETINGS, AND THERE ARE A FEW MORE FOLKS THAN WE ANTICIPATED WHO HAVE THOUGHTS. WE HAVE CHECKED NUMBERS AND REASSURED RESIDENTS THAT WE WOULD RECHECK DECIBEL LEVELS. THAT'S A LONG WAY OF SAYING THE FIRST MEETING IN MARCH AND POTENTIALLY THE SECOND MEETING MARCH, IF EVERYBODY IS OKAY WITH THAT.
02:26:27.371: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  WITH THAT INFORMATION, I WOULD PROPOSE WE POSTPONE IT TO THE SECOND MEETING IN MARCH.
02:26:38.081: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I AM GLAD THIS IS BEING POSTPONED, AND I'M CURIOUS, THOUGH, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE SETTING THIS DATE IN MARCH, WE COULD ALWAYS POSTPONE IT AGAIN, AND I'M ASSUMING WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND THE DISTRICT BASED ON THE FEEDBACK WE HAVE RECEIVED THUS FAR, WHICH I CONFIRMED THIS WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY PREVIOUSLY, MS. LARKHAM, THAT THAT WOULD MOVE THIS BACK TO A FIRST READING, WERE WE TO DO THAT, BUT AT THIS POINT, AT THIS JUNCTURE, I'M CURIOUS TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU, MR. DELACOURT, AND YOUR STAFF ARE APPROACHING LOOKING AT OTHER AREAS, YOU KNOW, WHO WE PLAN TO TALK WITH AND WHAT OTHER AREAS WE'LL CONSIDER BETWEEN NOW AND THE SECOND -- IT'S THE SECOND MEETING IN MARCH THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING, THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED, SO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOUCH ALL OF THE NECESSARY BASES, MEET ALL OF THE FOLKS AND THEN FORMULATE THIS ORDINANCE TO ADDRESS THAT FEEDBACK THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED.
02:27:37.441: >> WELL, WE STARTED FIRST WITH THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL SPEAKERS HERE. THE FIRST TIME THIS CAME UP, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE -- ALLIANCE AND OTHER GROUPS. THERE'S A LIST OF BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HAVE REACHED OUT, THE ARK, OTHER FOLKS, ASKING  -- AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE ARE SETTING UP A SERIES OF MEETINGS NOW. WE HAVE MEETINGS WITH THE MERCHANT -- (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) -- AND I THINK THERE ARE FIVE TOTAL. SO WE'LL MEET WITH ALL FIVE. (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) YEP, AND WE ARE GOING TO ASK THEM TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE AN IDEA. WE HAVE PUT DOTS ON A MAP OF BUSINESSES WE THINK MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS, AND AT LEAST GET INFORMATION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IF THESE DISTRICTS ARE TO BE EXPANDED. SO THAT'S THE PROCESS WE ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.
02:28:33.296: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OKAY. SO YOU CAN MEET WITH ALL OF THOSE GROUPS AND --
02:28:36.400: >> BOY, I HOPE SO. I SAID LAST TIME AND --
02:28:40.370: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  -- GET THEIR FEEDBACK BACK TO US.
02:28:42.973: >> DO YOU WANT TO PUSH IT BACK TO MAY OR JUNE?
02:28:46.309: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  WE CAN REACT ACCORDINGLY AND AMEND IT TO EXPAND THE DISTRICT?
02:28:50.647: >> CORRECT. WELL, OUR INTENT IS TO COME BACK WITH OPTIONS POTENTIALLY FOR AN EXPANDED DISTRICT. WE MAY EVEN BRING IT BACK FOR DISCUSSION, IF NECESSARY, IF WE ARE NOT SURE, SIMILAR TO OTHER ORDINANCES THAT WE HAVE DONE, IF THERE ARE OPTIONS, OR JUST BRING IT BACK TO OPTIONS WITH ONE, TWO, AND THREE AS FAR AS DISTRICTS AND ALLOW COUNCIL TO POINT US IN A DIRECTION.
02:29:28.051: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS -- THEY -- INITIALLY -- THE ARTS ALLIANCE, THE MICHIGAN THEATER, THEY WERE NOT HAPPY BECAUSE THEY FRANKLY BASICALLY HEARD ABOUT THIS AFTER THE FACT, AND THEY WERE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING THIS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THEIR AREAS AS WELL, SO I'M ASSUMING THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'LL GET THAT FEEDBACK, AND WHATEVER OPTIONS YOU PRESENT US WILL REFLECT THAT FEEDBACK PROVIDED. THANKS. AND, AGAIN, MARCH THE -- THE SECOND MEETING IN MARCH GIVES YOU THE TIME THAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT?
02:30:04.454: >> BOY, I HOPE SO.
02:30:05.589: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OKAY.
02:30:08.592: >> YES, IT DOES.
02:30:09.059: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:30:09.960: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IN THE INTERIM, IF WE POSTPONE, IS THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE ACTUAL CRAFTING OF THIS LANGUAGE? BECAUSE I THINK THE TWO HANG-UPS THAT I HAVE HEARD FROM NEIGHBORHOODS AND NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE ABOUT TO BE READ TO US IS THAT WE SWITCH FROM MAKING MEASUREMENTS AT THE PROPERTY RECEIVING LINE TO THE PROPERTY SENDING LINE, ALBEIT WITH A 50-FOOT BUFFER. THAT'S A BIG CHANGE, AND THE OTHER ONE IS BASICALLY WE HAVE CHANGED THE DECIBEL LEVEL TO REFLECT A NOISE THAT IS FOUR TIMES LOUDER THAN WAS ALLOWED BEFORE, SO IF YOU MOVE TEN DECIBELS, IT'S TWICE AS LOUD, 20 DECIBELS FOUR TIMES AS WELL. SO THOSE ARE THE TWO CONCERNS THAT I HAVE HEARD FROM NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS, AND THERE ARE MANY OPPOSE THESE FRINGE DISTRICTS, THAT'S GOING FROM BEING PROTECTIVE OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE ADJACENT TO DOWNTOWN OR THESE ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICTS TO BEING -- PUTTING THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ON NOTICE THAT, HEY, GUESS WHAT, IN CASE YOU DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW, YOU'RE LIVING NEXT TO A LOUD PLACE, AND HERE'S THE NEW LEVEL. SO IT'S QUESTIONABLE ON ITS MERITS TO SOME OF THESE NEAR DOWNTOWN NEIGHBORHOODS, I GUESS IS WHAT I WOULD SAY.
02:31:27.604: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:31:31.608: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  IF I MAY, SORRY, I WILL JUST SHARE THAT I KNOW THAT SOME FOLKS THAT MR. DELACOURT HAS ALREADY MET WITH, THEY ARE IN FACT LOOKING AT THIS DECIBEL LEVEL QUESTION ISSUE, AND I -- IT'S A SMALL WORLD. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF LEARNING ABOUT THEIR INTEREST WHEN I SAW THEM AT A PLAY OVER THE WEEKEND, AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD A DEVICE WITH THEM TO TEST THE DECIBEL LEVEL OF THE SOUND THAT WAS PRODUCED -- SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I GUESS, YEAH. SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE -- YOU PROBABLY ALREADY ARE WELL AWARE, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM FOLKS WHO ARE OUT THERE, YOU KNOW, SAMPLING THE SOUND, AND THAT WILL ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL, YOU KNOW, FEEDBACK ON THIS DECIBEL LEVEL.
02:32:24.394: >> YEAH, AGAIN, FROM OUR STANDPOINT AS STAFF, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE NOISE THAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN PRODUCED BY THE ORIGINAL DISTRICT PROPOSED AND OTHER AREAS OF THE CITY EXCEEDS OUR CURRENT SOUND ORDINANCE. WE GET THAT. THE ORDINANCE IS REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO CODIFY LEVELS THAT REPRESENT WHAT IS EXISTING AND HAS EXISTED FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN ASKED BY SOME OF THE RESIDENTS TO DOUBLE-CHECK THOSE NUMBERS AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE ACCURATE IN CODIFYING WHAT IS EXISTING. IT'S NOT AN ATTEMPT TO ALLOW LOUDER SOUND THAT OCCURS CURRENTLY. IT IS CERTAINLY ONE TO CHANGE THE ORDINANCE TO REFLECT WHAT IS THERE CURRENTLY BUT ALSO PROTECT THEM FROM THE LEVEL GRADUALLY INCREASING OVER TIME AS WELL. THAT IS THE INTENT OF IT. WE HOPE THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN THERE. THAT IS PART OF THE REASON THAT WE AS STAFF SUGGESTED STARTING WITH A SMALLER AREA TO START WITH, TO PUT IT IN PLACE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE CORRECT IN THAT CODIFICATION, BUT WHETHER IT'S THIS AREA OR AN EXPANDED AREA,F WE MISS THE MARK IN SOME WAY WITH THAT INTENT, WE'LL BE BACK, LIKE WITH SIMILAR ORDINANCES, TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FUTURE. SO THAT'S OUR INTENT, BUT WE CERTAINLY HOPE TO HAVE ALL OF THOSE MEETINGS AND HAVE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR YOU IN MARCH.
02:33:44.207: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:33:47.277: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, AND I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE ASKED THIS QUESTION A LITTLE WHILE AGO, BUT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT WE HAVE WITH TIERED SYSTEMS WHERE DECIBEL LEVELS ARE REDUCED IN TIME FRAMES AS THE WAY THIS IS BEING PROPOSED TO HAVE THE DECIBEL LEVELS -- THE ALLOWABLE LEVELS TO BE FEWER WITH DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE DAY?
02:34:12.335: >> YEAH, THE CURRENT -- CURRENT ORDINANCE, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, AND I APOLOGIZE, I SHOULD HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME, THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS TYPE OF DOWNTOWN USE. IT'S A DIFFERENT TIERING SYSTEM, AND THE INTENT OF IT IS DIFFERENT. I CAN GET YOU THAT. I APOLOGIZE. I DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
02:34:30.687: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YEAH, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, AS WE ARE DESCRIBING THIS AS NOT A CHANGE TO WHAT IS CURRENTLY THERE. I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT IS A LITTLE -- I LIKE SIMPLICITY, AND THIS BECOMES A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED WITH DIFFERENT DAYS, TIMES OF THE WEEK, DIFFERENT DECIBEL LEVELS, AND IT PERHAPS BECOMES OVERLY COMPLICATED WHEN YOU FACTOR IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS. PERHAPS MAYBE I CAN BE INVITED TO SOME OF THESE MEETINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THAT, BECAUSE IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW, THE INTENT IS WELL. IT'S JUST, IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED PERHAPS, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND SOME SIMPLICITY AND PERHAPS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT MORE.
02:35:30.547: >> UNDERSTOOD.
02:35:33.249: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE POSTPONEMENT? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. C2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:237 OF CHAPTER 8 (ORGANIZATION OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS) OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION PLEASE OF C, WHATEVER THIS IS, 2. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
02:35:59.642: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES. WELL, BACK ON JUNE 27TH, THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION PASSED A RESOLUTION TO ADD TWO VOTING YOUTH MEMBERS TO THE 13-MEMBER BOARD OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. AND THAT PASSED, AND SO SINCE THAT TIME, OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN FORMATTING AND MAKING NONSUBSTANTIVE CORRECTIONS AND SUCH TO THE CHAPTER 8, AND SO WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY IS TO EMPHASIZE AND ADD THESE TWO VOTING YOUTH MEMBERS, IN THE SENSE THAT LAST FRIDAY THE U OF M LIFELONG LEARNING INSTITUTE HAD AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION BY OUR OWN U OF M'S DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY, JONATHAN OVERPECK, AND IN HIS LONG SPEECH, WHICH WAS EXCELLENT, ABOUT PLANET AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALL, HE ENDED WITH THE ONE -- WITH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE IS MOST HOPEFUL ABOUT IS THAT THE YOUTH ARE GETTING INVOLVED AND TAKING LEADERSHIP ROLES AND TAKING OWNERSHIP OF THEIR FUTURE, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. SO I AM ASKING ALL OF YOU TO CONSIDER THESE TWO VOTING YOUTH MEMBERS. THE ONLY CONTROVERSY THAT I HAVE HEARD SO FAR IS THAT PERHAPS AGE 14 MAY BE TOO YOUNG. THIS IS YOUTH MEMBERS AGED 14-25, AND AT CAUCUS SUNDAY NIGHT, WE SURVEYED THE ATTENDEE -- WE HAD A BUNCH OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS IN THE AUDIENCE, AS IT TURNED OUT, AND WE SURVEYED THEM WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER 14 WAS TOO YOUNG OR WE SHOULD TRY FOR 15 OR 16 INSTEAD, AND ACTUALLY, THOSE YOUTH MEMBERS AT COUNCIL CAUCUS DID SAY THAT BASED ON THEIR OWN YOUTHFULNESS, THEY WOULD RATHER -- THEY WOULD -- THEY DID THINK THAT SAYING 16 AND UP MIGHT BE SOMETHING FOR US TO CONSIDER, SO I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THAT WITH ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU.
02:38:22.251: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND GRAND?
02:38:26.055: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. SO I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THREE AMENDMENTS. I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL THREE, BUT THEN I'LL OFFER THEM SEPARATELY. IN SECTION 1:237(2)(A), I WOULD LIKE TO MAINTAIN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MEMBERS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AS 13 MEMBERS. IF YOU'LL LOOK AT THE SITE THAT WE HAVE HERE, THERE ARE ONLY 15 SPOTS FOR PEOPLE TO SIT, SO IF WE HAVE A BOARD OR A COMMISSION OF 15 MEMBERS, THAT DOESN'T LEAVE ANY MONITOR FOR A STAFF MEMBER OR ANYONE ELSE. SO I THINK THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER SHOULD BE 13. IN SECTION 2(A)(II), RATHER THAN EIGHT ADULT MEMBERS, I'M GOING TO PROPOSE SIX ADULT MEMBERS, SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE TWO YOUTH MEMBERS. AND IN SECTION(2)(A)(III) I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE CHANGE THE AGE RANGE FROM 16-25. I'M GOING TO OFFER THAT FIRST.
02:39:55.511: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HAS THIS BEEN DISTRIBUTED?
02:39:58.047: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I DON'T HAVE IT IN WRITING. THEY ARE JUST NUMBERS THAT WOULD NEED -- IT WOULD ACTUALLY STRIKE THE CHANGE IN SECTION(2)(A). WE ARE CHANGING IT FROM 13 TO 15, AND I'M ASKING THAT WE MAINTAIN THE NUMBER AT 13.
02:40:21.904: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:40:27.076: >> IT DILUTES THE VOTES IF WE EXPAND THE SIZE OF THE COMMISSION, AND IT MAKES IT AN UNRULY SIZE TO HAVE 15 MEMBERS FOR A BOARD OR COMMISSION. SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT SIZE OF 13.
02:40:46.395: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, RAMLAWI, ACKERMAN.
02:40:53.970: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I'LL KEEP IT SHORT. WE DID TALK ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT AT CAUCUS. THE YOUTH MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE DID AGREE THAT PERHAPS THAT 15, 16 IS A BETTER AGE THAN 14. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME PRODIGIES, BUT -- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WILL BE SELECTED TO DO, AND IT'S NOT COMPULSORY. BUT THAT BEING SAID, I DO SUPPORT, YOU KNOW, RAISING IT TO AT LEAST 15, PERHAPS 16 IN THIS CASE. YOU KNOW, I JUST -- THE YOUTH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY WILL BE CARRYING AND PAYING THE COSTS FOR DECADES TO COME. THERE SHOULD BE SOME YOUTH REPRESENTATION ON THAT BOARD AND COMMISSION, AND THIS IS A WELCOME SIGN. I AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT IT DOES DILUTE THE EFFECTIVENESS IF WE GO UP TO 15. LET'S KEEP IT AT 13. I THINK MUCH MORE CAN GET DONE, LESS COOKS IN THE KITCHEN. YOU KNOW, 15 SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE COMING AT A COST, AN EFFICIENCY COST, AND I DON'T WANT TO EXCLUDE ANYONE FROM THE CONVERSATION, BUT 13 GIVES PLENTY OF PERSPECTIVES AND OPPORTUNITY AT THE SAME TIME. SO, I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THIS RESOLUTION.
02:42:20.489: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:42:22.191: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO, WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK TO ALL THREE OR JUST THE ONE?
02:42:25.561: >> I HAVE ONLY OFFERED THE FIRST.
02:42:27.196: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. SO I'LL SPEAK TO THE FIRST, AND THE FIRST BEING THIS -- THE FIRST IS MAINTAIN OR CUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, AND I -- I GUESS YOU TALK ABOUT GOING FROM EIGHT TO SIX, AND SO YOU ARE BACK UP TO EIGHT AGAIN. MAYBE MY COLLEAGUE, MS. BANISTER HERE CAN -- SO HOW MANY PEOPLE SIT ON THERE NOW?
02:42:55.858: >> CURRENTLY, THERE ARE 13.
02:42:58.194: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THERE'S 13 TOTAL? AND THAT INCLUDES OUR COUNCIL LIAISONS IN THAT COUNT? OKAY. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE NOTION THAT THE VOTE IS DILUTED, BUT I -- I DON'T KNOW. I FULLY SUPPORT HAVING YOUTH ON OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. WE HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH OUR YOUTH ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE. I THINK PLANNING IS AN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ONE, AND I THANK THE ATTORNEYS FOR LOOKING UP THE LEGALITIES, BECAUSE IT IS THE YOUTH'S FUTURE. IT IS THEIR CITY AND THE FUTURE, AND SO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN GET THAT FORESIGHT FROM YOUTH, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I SUPPORT THE DILUTION OF THE ADULT MEMBERS ON THE BOARD. I THINK IT'S ENOUGH THAT WE ARE ADD THESE KIDS. KIDS...  RELATIVELY KIDS. SO I DON'T SUPPORT THE CUTTING DOWN OF THE SIZE. I THINK IT'S OKAY TO HAVE TWO MORE ON THERE. I REALLY DO, AND I THINK THAT IT'S GREAT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE YOUTH, AND I'LL SPEAK TO THE AGE MOMENTARILY.
02:44:00.990: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:44:02.425: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE WOULD PHASE THIS IN. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD -- WOULD WE JUST EXIT PEOPLE AS THEY TERM OUT? WHAT'S THE OPERATIONALIZATION OF THIS?
02:44:18.841: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I DON'T HAVE AN EASY ANSWER FOR YOU, BUT THAT'S WHAT I CONCEIVED, YEAH. THE NEXT TWO OPENINGS WOULD GO TO YOUTH MEMBERS.
02:44:26.716: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  SO THERE WOULD BE A DELAY IN SEATING THEM, ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS AND SEATING THEM? OKAY. INTERESTING.
02:44:39.862: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:44:40.796: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I ACTUALLY HAD THE SAME QUESTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAD. IT BOTHERS ME A LITTLE BIT, REDUCING THE NUMBERS, IF THAT ACTUALLY GENERATES A DELAY IN SEATING THEM, AND IT ALSO STRIKES ME THAT IT MIGHT CREATE ANOTHER CHALLENGE, A CHALLENGE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE ON THE SEATS ARE DESIGNATED TO MEMBERS WHO HAVE A DISABILITY. IT CAN BE CHALLENGING WHEN THERE'S A SEAT THAT'S OPEN, AND WE HAVE APPLICANTS, BUT THEY DON'T MEET THE QUALIFICATION FOR THAT PARTICULAR SEAT. SO I DON'T KNOW. AND I GUESS MY OTHER CONCERN IS THAT IF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION FELT THAT THERE WAS A VALUE TO ADDING TWO YOUTH MEMBERS AND EXPANDING TO 15, I DON'T -- I'M NOT -- I DON'T SIT ON THAT COMMISSION. ANNE, IS THIS YOUR ASSIGNMENT? ARE YOU THE LIAISON TO IT?
02:45:38.254: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES.
02:45:39.088: >> I THINK THIS CAME UP AT CAUCUSES AS WELL, THAT IF YOU HAVE SUBCOMMITTEES, THERE'S ENOUGH WORK FOR THINGS TO BE ORGANIZED AROUND.
02:45:50.900: >> TRUE.
02:45:51.934: >> SO I HAVE A CONCERN WITH HOW WE WOULD PHASE THIS IN, AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THERE BEING 15, SO I DON'T SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT.
02:46:02.445: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT OPERATIONALIZATION. I FULLY SUPPORT PUTTING YOUTH ON THERE AND DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ON AGE AS WELL. I THINK IT WOULD CREATE AN ODD BALANCE, BECAUSE THIS IS A COMMISSION THAT HAS APPOINTEES FOR MANY OTHER COMMISSIONS, SO THEY ARE DUAL APPOINTED. I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING COMMISSION MEMBERS WHERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION IS THE PRIMARY BOARD THAT THEY SIT ON, AND I THINK IT CAN BE HARD, GIVEN THE WORK THAT THEY DO IN SUBCOMMITTEES, FOR P WHO SIT ON MULTIPLE BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS. SO -- OFTEN, THERE IS SUBCOMMITTEE WORK ON THE OTHER COMMISSION THAT THEY ARE ON. SO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IF WE WANT -- GIVEN THE MOVE THAT WE ARE MAKING IN THE CITY WITH THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND THE STEPS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING, I WOULD RATHER HAVE AS MANY HANDS ON DECK AS POSSIBLE, INCLUDING YOUTH MEMBERS.
02:47:01.604: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'M GOING TO ECHO WHAT -- ECHO THAT STATEMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. THIS IS THE AMENDMENT TO MAINTAIN THE COMMISSION AT 13.
02:47:19.522: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:47:20.389: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES.
02:47:21.157: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:47:24.860: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  NO.
02:47:27.530: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER --
02:47:28.564: >> WAIT, NOT TO MAINTAIN --
02:47:31.700: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THE AMENDMENT PROPOSES TO -- RIGHT NOW THE ORDINANCE DRAFT SUGGESTS 15, BY THE ADDITION OF TWO YOUTH MEMBERS. THE AMENDMENT WOULD DROP THAT DOWN TO 13.
02:47:43.412: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  TO MAINTAIN THE TOTALITY.
02:47:49.285: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  TO WASH OUT TWO ADULT MEMBERS TO ROLL INTO YOUTH MEMBERS.
02:47:53.622: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, NO. BANNISTER?
02:47:55.357: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  NO. GRISWOLD?
02:47:56.425: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  NO. LUMM?
02:47:58.093: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  NO. GRISWOLD?
02:47:59.962: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  NO.
02:48:01.363: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:48:02.264: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  NO.
02:48:02.932: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  MAYOR TAYLOR?
02:48:03.599: >> MAYOR EATON?
02:48:04.266: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  YES.
02:48:05.434: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:48:07.803: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  NO.
02:48:10.472: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  THE AMENDMENT FAILS.
02:48:12.908: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
02:48:15.377: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  MY SECOND AMENDMENT IS UNNECESSARY NOW, BECAUSE WE HAVE INCREASED THE TOTAL NUMBER. SO THE OTHER AMENDMENT I WOULD OFFER IS TO SECTION 1.237(2)(A)(III) TO CHANGE THE AGE RANGE FOR THE YOUTH MEMBERS. IT'S CURRENTLY 14 AND 25. I WOULD CHANGE THAT TO 16 AND 25.
02:48:42.905: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. YES, COUNCILMEMBER EATON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR, AND THEN GRAND AND ACKERMAN.
02:48:51.814: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THE YOUTH MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED FOR ONE YEAR AT A TIME, SO THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY A BENEFIT TO STARTING THEM YOUNGER AND LETTING THEM SPEND MORE OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ON THE COMMISSION. I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR WAITING UNTIL A YOUTH MEMBER IS SLIGHTLY MORE MATURE AND ACADEMICALLY ADEPT AND READY TO TAKE ON THIS KIND OF TASK, SO AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED DURING THE CAUCUS ON SUNDAY, THE FEW YOUTH THAT WERE AT THAT MEETING ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED THAT 16 WAS A GOOD AGE, AND SO I WOULD FOLLOW TH DIRECTION.
02:49:37.459: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:49:38.294: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. SO, SO I'M OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS. I PERSONALLY HAVE A 14-YEAR-OLD, AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING SHE WOULD NECESSARILY BE WANTING TO DO, BUT AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO DID ATTEND THE CLIMATE MARCH AND SAW PEOPLE WHO WERE 13, 14, 15 LEADING THIS LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT WAS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE, AND I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD IN RELATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE PUBLIC AT THIS TABLE HAVE OFTEN COME FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE 14 OR 15 YEARS OLD, AND IT'S PROFOUND AND STRIKING, AND SURPRISING, GIVEN THEIR AGE, BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME APPLICATION PROCESS AS ANYONE ELSE, AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY WOULD BE CHOSEN, JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE, SO I AM PERSONALLY IN FAVOR OF HAVING IT BE MORE OPEN. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'LL END UP WITH TWO 14-YEAR-OLDS. AS YOUTH MEMBERS, I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THAT WERE THE CASE, BUT I HAVE MET ACTIVISTS FROM THIS COMMUNITY AS YOUNG AS 14 OR 15, AND I WOULD -- YOU KNOW, IF IT'S 16, THEY CAN WAIT, BUT THEY MIGHT BE ON TO 12 OTHER THINGS BY THEN, SO I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT OPEN, IF POSSIBLE.
02:51:02.978: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:51:03.912: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. IF YOU GUYS HAD LET ME START AT 14, I WOULD BE RETIRED BY NOW, SO JUST IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT ME AND HOW MUCH BETTER YOUR LIVES WOULD BE. I -- I -- NO, I THINK IT SHOULD STAY AT 14 AS WELL. LET THE APPLICATIONS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. DON'T DIMINISH OUR POOL OF APPLICANTS, AND JUST, YOU KNOW, LET PEOPLE GET THESE SEATS THROUGH THEIR MERIT REGARDLESS OF AGE. IT MAY BE HARDER FOR A 14-YEAR-OLD TO BUILD UP A RESUÉE THAT COMPETES WITH A 16 OR 17-YEAR-OLD. SO BE IT. WE'LL TRUST THE JUDGMENT OF THE COMMISSION AND THE LIAISONS ON COUNCIL AND OUR OWN DISCRETION TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE COMMISSIONERS.
02:51:49.558: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:51:50.459: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I GUESS I'M GOING TO SPEAK FROM A PARENT'S PERSPECTIVE, PARENT OF A 14-YEAR-OLD ALSO. SO, WELL, IT'S 2016, I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER. SO MY DAUGHTER SPOKE BEFORE PLANNING WHEN SHE WAS 11. SHE CAME DOWN HERE TO ASK FOR GREEN ROOFS, AND IT WAS PRETTY COOL TO SEE HER DOING THAT. BUT THESE MEETINGS, I CAN'T PICTURE HER -- AND, AGAIN, THIS IS MY OWN PERSPECTIVE, I CAN'T PICTURE HER WANTING TO SERVE ON AN E.C. THAT GOES FROM 7:00 TO 10:00 AT NIGHT. SHE'S IN THE NINTH GRADE AT 14 YEARS OLD. I'M KIND OF INCLINED TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE, LIKE STEP IT UP ONE YEAR. IN 15, YOU'RE AT THE 10th GRADE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MAKE THESE APPLICATIONS AND IT WILL KEEP WEED THEMSELVES OUT ANYWAY, BUT 14 SEEMS TOO YOUNG TO ME. I DON'T KNOW WHY. IT JUST DOES. OF COURSE, SHE WAS AT THE CLIMATE MARCH MAKING POSTERS WITH HER FRIENDS. I'M TORN. I'M GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF THIS TIME TO NUT IT OUT DOWN HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. I DOUBT THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO SERVE ON A COMMISSION FROM 7:00 TO 10:00 AT NIGHT WITH ALL OF HER OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES, OR 7:00 TO 9:00, HOWEVER LONG THAT GOES. IT'S HARD TO PICTURE THAT. IT'S JUST HARD TO PICTURE IT FOR ME. SO I AM NOT SURE. I KNOW THAT DIDN'T HELP THE CONVERSATION MUCH, BUT I APPRECIATE THE NOTION THAT WE ARE BRINGING YOUTH TO THIS COMMISSION. THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.
02:53:22.718: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:53:23.552: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I DO SUPPORT -- I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING, OBVIOUSLY, TO ENGAGE -- HAVE YOUTH REPRESENTED, YOUNG ADULTS. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, I DID QUESTION THE REASONABLENESS OF HAVING 14-YEAR-OLDS SETTING POLICY, AND I SENT SOME OF YOU -- WHEN WE GOT AN ADVICE MEMORANDUM LAST WEEK FROM CITY ATTORNEY FROST IN RESPONSE TO SOME COUNCIL QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, I SENT SOME OF YOU MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS, AND IN THE INTEREST OF TRANSPARENCY, I JUST SENT IT TO THE REST OF YOU, SO IT WILL BE ON RECORD, BUT I JUST THINK GOING FORWARD, AS WE GO DOWN THIS PATH OF ADDING YOUNG PEOPLE, I DO THINK IN THE BEST PRACTICE WORLD, THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN MORE CONSTRUCTIVELY, THOUGHTFULLY ENGAGE YOUNG ADULTS IN THE COMMUNITY, AND A LOT OF NONPROFITS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES USE -- THEY HAVE THIS LEADERSHIP CONTINUUM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY HAVE TEEN AMBASSADOR PROGRAMS. THESE ARE JUST THINGS WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER AS WE GO FORWARD, AND IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING THIS EXPERIENCE BENEFICIAL AND POSITIVE, ONBOARDING YOUNG PEOPLE, ORIENTING THEM IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY SO THAT IT'S A GOOD EXPERIENCE, AND THEY BUILD CONFIDENCE AS A RESULT OF THIS EXPERIENCE AND THEIR LEADERSHIP ABILITIES AND COMPETENCIES. SO IN GENERAL, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DO THIS IN A MORE SORT OF THOUGHTFUL, PLANNED WAY, NOT JUST LOWER THE -- YOU KNOW, THE AGE AND SAY, YOU KNOW, AND ADD THESE FOLKS. WE NEED TO REALLY -- AGAIN, SO IT'S A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. THEY GET AS MUCH FROM THIS AS WE GET FROM THEIR PARTICIPATION. WE HELP DEVELOP THEM SO THEY ARE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE FULLY. THAT'S MY TWO CENTS. THANKS.
02:55:42.858: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, HAYNER, AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN GO TO A VOTE ON THIS. -- COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:55:52.267: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: THESE TWO POSITIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TREMENDOUS VALUE TO STUDENTS APPLYING TO IVY LEAGUE AND PREMIER UNIVERSITIES, AND BECAUSE THERE'S SOME QUESTION RIGHT NOW ABOUT APPOINTMENTS TO OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, IT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE THIS A TRANSPARENT PROCESS AND REALIZE THAT AN APPOINTMENT TO THIS COMMISSION COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SCHOLARSHIP AND NOT A SCHOLARSHIP TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY, SO THESE ARE VERY, VERY IMPORTANT, AND IT HAS TO BE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS, AND I SUPPORT 16.
02:56:30.806: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:56:31.707: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I TOOK MY TIME AND NOODLED IT OUT, AND I SUPPORT 16 TOO. AND TWO REASONS. ONE IS THAT, YOU KNOW, 14 IS PRETTY YOUNG, AND I KNOW EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SET A KID UP TO FAIL, AND IF SOMEBODY IS 14 AND THEY ARE THAT INTERESTED, THEY CAN COME DOWN HERE AND SPEAK. THEY CAN OBSERVE. THEY CAN SIT IN ON THE MEETINGS AND DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO. THE SECOND THING IS, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS PLAYS INTO IT WHATSOEVER, BUT WHEN I COACH WATER BOTTLE ROCKETS AND SCIENCE OLYMPICS AND THINGS AT THE SCHOOL AND WAS A BOY SCOUT LEADER AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS, I HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND GET FINGERPRINTED AND BE QUESTIONED TO BE WITH YOUTH. SO IS THERE ANY QUESTION THAT 16 IS TOO YOUNG TO BE SITTING DOWN HERE AT NIGHT WITH A BUNCH OF ADULTS? I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ODD, BUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE IN RAISING THE AGE TO 16.
02:57:33.168: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:57:35.137: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. I KNOW YOU WANT TO GET ON TO VOTE, BUT I DO WANT TO GO ON RECORD AND STATE MY CASE. I DO BELIEVE 16 IS THE RIGHT AGE. 14, I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT COME ALONG WITH IT. IT'S A GREAT MESSAGE THAT WE WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO THE YOUTH, BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE PRAGMATIC IN OUR WAYS OF DO DOING -- SETTING POLICY. I MEAN, IT'S GREAT TO BE AN ACTIVIST. I REMEMBER GOING TO MY FIRST MARCH WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY QUALIFY ME TO SET POLICY, BEING AN ACTIVIST AND BEING IN MARCHES. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES AT A YOUNG AGE, AND THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN SETTING POLICY. AND I WANT OUR COMMISSIONS AND BOARDS TO RUN OPTIMALLY. AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD SET THEM UP TO SUCCEED, WHETHER IT'S THE PEOPLE ON THEM OR THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THEMSELVES. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I'LL BE SUPPORTING 16.
02:58:36.398: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. RAMLAWI?
02:58:43.772: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES. HAYNER?
02:58:44.739: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:
02:58:46.474: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES. GRISWOLD?
02:58:47.976: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  YES. LUMM?
02:58:49.444: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YES.
02:58:50.078: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?

02:58:56.017: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
02:58:56.852: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  YES.
02:58:58.286: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:59:01.089: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  YES.
02:59:08.864: >> THE AMENDMENT CARRIES.
02:59:10.498: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED?
02:59:13.835: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  JUST BRIEFLY.
02:59:17.505: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
02:59:18.506: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I JUST WANTED TO NOTE AT THE NEXT MEETING, THE ENERGY COMMISSION WILL BE EXPANDED IN THE SAME FASHION, SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT AS WELL. I REALLY BELIEVE THESE ARE TWO COMMISSIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE YOUTH REPRESENTATION ON THEM, AND SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT.
02:59:33.955: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? SIMILARLY, I THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT'S CERTAINLY THE SENSE OF THE ROOM, YOU KNOW, IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE GET INVOLVED, AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE CARE ABOUT AND CARE ABOUT DEEPLY. WE WILL, I THINK, HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT, THE BENEFIT OF THE CROSS-FERTILIZATION, THE CROSS-COLLABORATION FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO BEING IN ROOMS SUCH AS THESE AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT PARTICIPATION. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC1, RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE GELMAN SITE AND ENCOURAGING IT'S LISTING OF THE SAME AS A SUPERFUND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC1. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:00:30.545: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THIS TO THE -- I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THIS TO THE FEBRUARY 3RD MEETING. DO I NEED A SECOND BEFORE I COMMENT?
03:00:46.594: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:00:47.696: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  THAT WE POSTPONE IT, YES. I WANT TO ANNOUNCE A COUPLE OF POSITIVES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, AND ONE IS WHEN WE HAD THE MEETING LAST THURSDAY, ONE OF THE STATEMENTS I MADE AND ASKED FOR ASSURANCE THAT THIS WA CORRECT FROM E.E.G.L. AND WAS TOLD IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT, AND I'LL JUST READ IT FROM MLIVE HERE. AN E.P.A. SUPERFUND SITE IS A STRATEGIC SOLUTION. IT'S SORT OF A LONG-TERM INSURANCE POLICY AND DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE SHORT-TERM WORK THAT E.E.G.L. WOULD BE DOING, AND SO THAT'S RESOLVED ONE OF THE ISSUES AND SOME OF THE CONFUSION THAT I THINK WE HAVE HAD OVER THE LAST YEAR. SO I HATE TO POSTPONE IT, BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. I BELIEVE WE HAVE EVERYONE'S ATTENTION, TO THE POINT WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS WILL INCLUDE A SHORT SPEECH BY A RESIDENT FROM ANN ARBOR ADDRESSING THE 1,4-DIOXANE PLUME.
03:01:55.730: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:02:00.935: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  WELL, I SEE THAT THIS HAS BEEN POSTPONED NOW A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE THIS, AND IT'S AN ONGOING SAGA IN OUR COMMUNITY. MY PATIENCE IS RUNNING OUT, AND MY CONSTITUENTS' PATIENCE ARE RUNNING OUT. TIME IS RUNNING OUT. WE ARE ELECTED LEADERS. WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN SO MUCH INFORMATION ON THIS. WE HAVE HAD MANY MEETINGS ON THIS. FRANKLY, ONE OF THEM PROBABLY WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND TAXPAYER DOLLARS. WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ON THIS. I WILL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT, BUT I WILL NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT INDEFINITELY. I HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL FOR OVER A YEAR. I HAVE GOT ALL OF MY FACTS. I HAVE GOT ALL OF MY THOUGHTS, AND I HAVE MY CONSTITUENTS. SO, I WILL SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT, BUT THIS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN UP ON A VOTE, UP OR DOWN, SO OUR CONSTITUENTS KNOW WHERE WE LIE ON THIS MATTER.
03:03:13.942: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:03:15.477: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO, TO SPEAK TO THIS NOTION OF POSTPONING, WHEN WE HAD OUR LAST MEETING WITH THE COMBINED REGULATORY AGENCIES AND, YOU KNOW, A FULL HOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE, YOU KNOW, WHAT DID THE E.P.A. SAY? WELL, IN ESSENCE, THEY SAID THAT THIS IS A PROCESS, AND IT COULD TAKE ANY AMOUNT OF TIME, BETWEEN AND 30 YEARS, AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LONG-TERM PROBLEM LIKE THIS AND LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU HAVE TO THINK -- YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE FUTURE, JUST LIKE YOU WOULD PUT YOURSELF IN THE PAST WHEN YOU SAY IF WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO TAKE 30 YEARS, WE SHOULD HAVE STARTED IT 30 YEARS AGO, AND WHERE WOULD WE BE TODAY? AND WHERE DO WE WANT TO BE IN 30 YEARS? WE SHOULD START TODAY. AND SO I DON'T SUPPORT POSTPONING THIS. I WANT ACTION ON THIS SITE, AND I KNOW IT'S A COMPLEX SITE, AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES SAY. THEY RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE. SO I SPENT A NICE HALF HOUR THIS WEEK TALKING WITH THE FOLKS WHO MAINTAIN THE WELLS OUT THERE, AND THEY ARE WATCHING THE SCREENS ON A MONITORING WELL THAT ARE -- ACTUALLY AN EXTRACTION WELL, 200 FEET WELL, AND THEY WERE TRYING TO MONITOR, AND THEY WERE DRAWING OFF THE COLOR, DRAWING OFF THE WATER, AND, YOU KNOW, THEY TESTED THE EFFICACY OF THEIR SCREEN CLEANING BY THE COLOR OF THE WATER THAT COMES OUT, SO THEY BREAK THROUGH THE FIRST ONE; IT'S DARK, THE SECOND ONE IS RUST COLORED AND SO ON AND SO ON. IT'S A PROCESS, AND THAT'S ONE OF HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF WELLS. IT'S A VERY INVOLVED SITE, AND FRANKLY, THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE WASHING THOSE SCREENS IS BECAUSE THEY RELIED ON THE POLLUTER, BECAUSE THE POLLUTER COULDN'T MAKE IT DRAW ANYMORE ON THOSE SCREENS. THEY COULDN'T PUMP ENOUGH. SO THE POLLUTER, OUT OF THEIR GOOD AND KIND HEART, THEY SAID, HEY, WE HAVE TO CLEAN THAT SCREENER. WE A NOT KEEPING UP. DID D.E.Q. KNOW THAT WAS HAPPENING OR E.E.G.L.?  NO. WE ARE SOLELY RELYING ON THE GOODWILL OF THE POLLUTER. I'M DONE WITH THAT. IF WE START NOW, 30 YEARS FROM NOW, WE'LL BE HAPPY THAT WE DID. I WON'T VOTE FOR POSTPONEMENT TONIGHT. I THINK THE DUAL PATH OF HAVING THE E.P.A., THE BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN FROM THEM DOING AN ASSESSMENT, THE HURON RIVER FOLKS, SCIO TOWNSHIP, THEY HAVE ALL ASKED FOR A SUPERFUND. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THEY ARE STILL ASKING FOR A PRELIMINARY OR A SECONDARY ASSESSMENT, IN THIS CASE, AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT NOT MR. BERKHOFF BUT THE WOMAN FROM THE E.P.A. WHO WAS NEW TO THE CROWD, MS. TANAKA -- THANK YOU -- IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE HAD NO SENSE OF THE VAST TROVE OF DATA THAT C.A.R.D. HAS NOT ONLY CORRECTED BUT COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS THAT IS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY SHORTEN THE SECONDARY AND PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUES, I SAY LET'S VOTE, DON'T POSTPONE ANYMORE.
03:06:34.976: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:06:38.946: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I JUST WANT TO ECHO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S POSITION. I THINK COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I MIGHT BE THE TWO PROTEST VOTES AGAINST A POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE I'M READY TO VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU.
03:06:52.493: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
03:06:53.328: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. I AM ENCOURAGED BY THAT SENTIMENT, BUT I BELIEVE UNTIL WE ACTUALLY SEE A DRAFT CONSENT JUDGMENT, WE SHOULD NOT MAKE THIS DECISION, AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOD SUPPORT A SHORT POSTPONEMENT, AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE POSTPONEMENT TONIGHT FOR THAT REASON.
03:07:19.220: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN LUMM.
03:07:22.557: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE POSTPONEMENT FOR A DIFFERENT TAKE OF WHAT I HEARD FROM THE E.P.A., ESPECIALLY RELATED TO DATA WHERE THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD A VERY STRICT PROCESS AND THAT THEY WERE INCREDIBLY INTENTIONAL AND METHODICAL, AND THAT'S WHY IT TAKES SO MANY DECADES TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS, SO I'M, YOU KNOW, SURE THEY ARE HAPPY TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN COLLECTING DATA, BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HEAR A SENSE THAT THAT DATA WOULD SHORTEN THE PROCESS. IF ANYTHING, I HEARD LONG PROCESS MANY TIMES IN THAT DISCUSSION. BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, I THINK THERE'S A PROCESS ISSUE THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT. I DO SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S CONCERN THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE FINAL AGREEMENT YET, BUT THAT WE ALSO MADE A COMMITMENT AS A BODY TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AT THE COUNTY, WITH SCIO TOWNSHIP AND THE HURON WATERSHED COUNCIL THAT ARE THE JOINT INTERVENERS, AND WE HAVEN'T MET COLLECTIVELY AS A GROUP AFTER THIS MEETING, AND I THINK FROM A PROCESS STANDPOINT, WE AS COLLEAGUES WILL HOLD OUR WORD THAT WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO LISTEN TO THOSE PARTNERS AND WORK TO MAKE A COLLECTIVE DECISION, ALL FOUR BODIES, BECAUSE THIS IS A REGIONAL PROBLEM. THIS ISN'T EXCLUSIVELY A PROBLEM TO OUR CITY, AND WHILE WE ULTIMATELY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CITY, I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO THINK REGIONALLY AND WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION, BECAUSE THIS IS -- IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM, AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH FOR DECADES, REGARDLESS OF THE PATH THAT WE CHOOSE. SO, I WOULD RATHER HAVE SUPPORT FROM OUR LONG-TERM PARTNERS IN THIS DECISION.
03:09:10.364: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBERS LUMM AND THEN HAYNER.
03:09:13.367: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I CONCUR WITH THE CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARTICULATED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT AS WELL. I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT NONE OF US ARE SATISFIED WITH WHAT'S TRANSPIRED TO DATE, BUT I TH THINK -- I MEAN, I DIDN'T FIND THE MEETING WITH THE E.P.A. ON JANUARY 16TH PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING. WHEN E.P.A. SAYS -- I MEAN, I WROTE SOME OF THE VERBATIM COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE VARIOUS PROCESS QUESTIONS. HOW LONG WILL THIS PROCESS TAKE? A NUMBER OF YEARS, ABOUT THREE YEARS TO PROPOSE A SITE. MS. TANAKA WENT ON TO SAY, QUOTE, "HAS VERY MANY STEPS. IT IS A VERY SLOW PROCESS. THE PROCESS IS LONG AND DELIBERATIVE." TO THE QUESTION CAN E.P.A. SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT IT WILL TAKE OVER WITH THE PROCESS ONCE THE SITE IS COMPLETE, SHE SAID E.E.G.L. WOULD SCORE THE SITE PRIOR TO REFERRING TO THE E.P.A. SHE SAID WE ARE NOT FAST. WE ARE REALLY, REALLY SLOW, ON AND ON AND ON. YOU GET THE PICTURE. SO THAT DOESN'T GIVE ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE E.P.A.'S SUPERFUND ROUTE IS THE BEST OPTION AT THIS JUNCTURE. I WANT US TO CONTINUE WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS. VERY GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AND I THINK I SEE IT ACCELERATING, AND THAT'S ALL EXCELLENT, AND, YOU KNOW, NONE OF US WANT TO LIVE WITH THE CONSENT JUDGMENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS, AND I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE IN THAT REGARD. SO, AND AGAIN, IT WAS CLEAR FROM THURSDAY THAT THE E.P.A. SUPERFUND PROCESS, EVEN IF THIS QUALIFIES, AND THAT'S A BIG IF, COULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS, EVEN PERHAPS DECADES, AND SO I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT IT IS NOT A BIG RISK IN TERMS OF ADVERSELY IMPACTING THE PROGRESS IN THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE TO DATE, AND, YOU KNOW, AS WITH ANYTHING, SOMETIMES THE DEVIL, YOU KNOW, IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN THE ONE YOU DON'T. AND THERE'S SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WITH E.P.A., AND THAT WAS MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AT THE JANUARY 16TH MEETING THAT WE HAD. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE MANY WHO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS FAR BETTER THAN I DO. I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO HEARING ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS, BUT, YOU KNOW, PERHAPS AT SOME POINT IT MAKES SENSE TO HEAD DOWN THE SUPERFUND PATH, BUT I -- I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE ON THE PATHE ARE ON NOW, BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING SERIOUS PROGRESS, AND I THINK THAT'S IN OUR BEST INTERESTS, SHORT AND LONG TERM, SO I WILL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT.
03:12:22.723: >> MAYOR TAYLOR: COUNCILMEMBER -- I FORGET MY QUEUE. DO I HAVE HAYNER AND THEN RAMLAWI? ACKERMAN, GRISWOLD.
03:12:36.437: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I'LL BE BRIEF HERE. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE E.P.A. WAS CALLED IN FOR ITS PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT, IT MADE THAT ASSESSMENT, SAYING THAT THE SITE MOVE FORWARD FOR N.P.L. AND CERCLA. THEY ARE ONLY LACKING A LETTER FROM THE GOVERNOR SAYING PLEASE DO ACT. NOW, WE KNOW THAT IF THIS SITE HAD BEEN A SITUATION WHERE IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE, IMMEDIATE, IMMEDIATE THE E.P.A.'S OPINION TO PUBLIC HEALTH, IMMEDIATE EXPOSURE THREAT, THAT THEY COULD HAVE ACTED WITHOUT THAT CONCURRENCE LETTER. THEY HAVE THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO COME IN AND SAY, YES, WE ARE GOING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD ON THE LISTING, WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. AND THEY DIDN'T DO THAT. I UNDERSTAND THEY DIDN'T DO THAT. THEY WANTED THAT LETTER. THEY WANTED THE STATE TO CHIME IN WITH THEIR CHECKBOOK FOR 10%. THAT'S WHAT THAT LETTER REALLY MEANS. WHEN THE GOVERNOR STEPS IN, SHE SPEAKS FOR E.E.G.L. AND THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE, AND SHE SPEAKS TO THE NOTION THAT THE CLEANUP OR THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES THAT ARE IN PLACE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT, AND THAT THIS IS -- THAT THE E.P.A. IS NEEDED AS A REGULATORY AGENCY OF LAST RESORT, AND SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE, ARE WE AT THIS LAST RESORT? I'M NOT SUPER CONFIDENT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING. I'M NOT SATISFIED THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR IS ENOUGH, AND I'M ALSO NOT SATISFIED THAT -- WITH THE NOTION THAT ANYTHING THAT THE POLLUTER WOULD ACQUIESCE TO OR AGREE TO IS WHAT WE WANT, BECAUSE ANYTHING THE POLLUTER IS GOING TO SAY YES TO IS GOING TO BE IN THEIR FAVOR, AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THUS, AND IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE 25 YEARS' WORTH OF STALL DOCUMENTS THAT MR. CALDWELL AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE PUT FORWARD ON BEHALF OF THEIR POLLUTING CUSTOMER, YOU WOULD SEE THAT. SO WE CAN KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD, OR WE CAN ACT NOW. BUT EITHER WAY, AS IT'S BEEN SAID BY OTHERS, EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO DECIDE, YOU HAVE STILL MADE A CHOICE. AND SO I DON'T SUPPORT POSTPONING THIS.
03:14:41.762: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:14:42.997: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY. I HAVE SO MANY POINTS TO MAKE. I APOLOGIZE FOR JUMPING AROUND. YOU KNOW, THIS NOTION THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO GET THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE DOESN'T DAUNT ME. IT'S BEEN TOLD THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL EXIST FOR GENERATIONS, SO IF WE PUT IT INTO PERSE, HAVING THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO BEGIN WHAT THE E.P.A. NEEDS TO DO IN FIVE OR SEVEN YEARS IS NOT A MIND BLOWING PREREQUISITE TO MAKING A DECISION. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FITS INTO THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. YOU KNOW, IT WAS EVIDENT DURING THE DISCUSSIONS THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT PATHS THAT THESE AGENCIES WOULD TAKE, EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULD WORK WITH EACH OTHER. CLEANUP WOULD CONTINUE UNDER THE PATH OF THE SUPERFUND UNDER THE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. YOU KNOW, WE -- YOU COULD -- THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS, AND I WISH I SHARED THE OPTIMISM SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS BODY HAVE ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS, BUT I'M NOT DRINKING THAT KOOL AID. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK, AND I WASN'T HERE WHEN THIS WAS FIRST -- THIS LAST LAWSUIT WAS FIRST FILED, HOW LONG DID THIS BODY EXPECT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET A CONCLUSION? HOW LONG? DID THEY THINK THEY WOULD STILL BE IN THE YEAR 2020, AFTER A MILLION DOLLARS? PLUS ALL OF THE OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS? TO STILL BE HERE? I REALLY WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO ASK THAT. I REALLY WANT SOMEONE TO TELL ME HOW LONG THEY THOUGHT THIS PROCESS WAS GOING TO TAKE WHEN THIS BEGAN, THIS INITIATED. YOU KNOW, IT'S -- I UNDERSTAND THE E.P.A.'S POSITION. THEY REALLY WANTED TO SOBER PEOPLE UP ON THE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THEY CAN DO AND WHAT THEY CAN'T DO. BUT IT WAS REALLY CLEAR TO ME, AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR TO EVERYBODY, THAT THEIR OBJECTIVE IS TO CUT THE HEAD OFF THE SNAKE RIGHT AWAY. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING, AND I DON'T FEEL THAT'S NECESSARILY THE ROUTE THIS OTHER PATH GETS US. SO, THERE IS SOME REALLY CLEAR DIFFERENCES, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M ONLY ON COUNCIOR THREE MORE YEARS. I'M NOT HERE FOR FIVE MORE YEARS OR TEN MORE YEARS TO MAKE THAT DECISION. I WAS ELECTED TO MAKE DECISIONS BETWEEN THE YEAR OF LAST YEAR AND 2022. SO I WON'T BE HERE IN 2024 TO SAY, OKAY, LET'S DO IT NOW. SO I WILL DO THIS, BUT I'M NOT WAITING FOR OUR OTHER BODIES TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS. THIS PROBLEM IS UNDERNEATH MY HOUSE AS WE SPEAK, AND THAT'S ENOUGH PROOF FOR ME TO TAKE I'M AN ELECTED OFFICIAL TO TAKE ACTION. THIS IS SHOWING UP AT WEST PARK. THIS IS SHOWING UP IN ALLEN CREEK. WHERE DOES IT NEED TO SHOW UP, IN THIS GLASS OF WATER, BEFORE WE DO SOMETHING? SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD STATING MY POSITION. THANK YOU.
03:18:32.126: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:18:34.862: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. WE HAVE AN IMMENSE DECISION AHEAD OF US AND IN ANY DECISION, IT'S BETTER TO HAVE OPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES, AND WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT THE FINAL OPTION OF THE CONSENT JUDGMENT IS. I WOULD FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE TO KNOW FINAL AND BEST BEFORE MAKING ANY DECISION, AND I DO HAVE AN OPEN MIND AS TO THE DIRECTION WE GO, WHICH HOPEFULLY IS INCENTIVE TO COME TO A BETTER AGREEMENT. YOU KNOW, I FELT THAT I WAS LEFT WITH A FEW MORE QUESTIONS THAN THE E.P.A., BUT I ALSO HAVE HEARD A LOT OF OTHER TESTIMONY THAT RUNS COUNTER TO THAT, AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE KNOW EVERY ARROW IN OUR QUIVER, AND WE JUST DON'T FULLY KNOW WHAT THE CONSENT JUDGMENT ARROW LOOKS LIKE.
03:19:34.121: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:19:35.055: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: YEAH, I WAS REMISS IN NOT MENTIONING THE COLLABORATION THAT IS ONGOING WITH SOME OF THE OTHER GROUPS. I SPOKE WITH JASON MORGAN, THE CHAIR OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, ON MONDAY. THEY WILL BE DISCUSSING THIS TOPIC ON WEDNESDAY. ON THURSDAY, THERE'S AN INFORMAL GATHERING OF A FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT FROM THE DIFFERENT GROUPS, AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE AHEAD, AND I TOTALLY AGREE. WE NEED TO HAVE A DEADLINE FOR THIS CONSENT JUDGMENT, AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD RECOMMEND IS WE ARE NOT APPROVING ANY ADDITIONAL LEGAL COSTS FOR THIS PROJECT. WRAP IT UP, BRING IT IN, LET'S DECIDE WHAT THAT OPTION IS. AND THE LAST THING, AND I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE EXPERTS ON THIS, WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE MOST AND ARE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM, AND THAT IS TROUBLING, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE DONE IS I HAVE PREPARED A G.A.N.T. CHART WITH TEN DIFFERENT PATHS, AND THESE ARE NOT SEQUENTIAL PROCESSES. THEY CAN BE PARALLEL PROCESSES, AND WE CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THESE OPTIONS, BECAUSE I THINK WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH OUR DECISION-MAKING METHODOLOGY, AND WE ARE SORT OF GETTING STUCK IN THE WEEDS, AND WE ARE NOT SEEING THE BIG PICTURE, AND WE HAV TO. AND THE LAST THING IS WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH THE CONSENT JUDGMENT AND THE PROCESS THAT E.E.G.L. IS USING IS THEY DO CONTAINMENT, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE PUMPING FROM THE EDGES OF THE PLUME, WHICH COULD ACTUALLY BE SUCKING MORE OF THE HIGH-CONCENTRATION DIOXANE AWAY FROM THE CENTER, WHEREAS THE E.P.A. WILL PUMP FROM THE HIGHER CONCENTRATION AREAS, AND THAT IS A CRITICAL DIFFERENCE. SO I'M NOT SAYING IT'S EITHER OR. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW MANY, MANY PATHS, BUT WE NEED THE PEOPLE WITH THE MOST TECHNICAL INFORMATION TO WEIGH IN WHEN WE DO GET THAT CONSENT JUDGMENT AND BEFORE WE MAKE A DECISION. THANKS.
03:21:39.146: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:21:43.383: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I WANT TO SPEAK TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S COMMENT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ABOUT TIMELINE AND BE REALLY HONEST ABOUT THIS. I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY, BUT I LIVE WITH ONE AND I GREW UP WITH ONE, AND I HAVE KIND OF BEEN AROUND LITIGATORS MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND I KNOW THAT IT ALWAYS TAKES A LOT LONGER THAN YOU WANT IT TO, AND IT'S ALWAYS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN YOU WANT IT TO BE. YOU KNOW, IT -- AM I HAPPY WITH THE TIMELINE? NO. AM I HONESTLY SURPRISED BY THE TIMELINE? ALSO NO. I THINK IT CAN SOMETIMES BE WORTH TAKING A LITTLE MORE TIME WHEN WE THINK ABOUT A LONG-TERM PROBLEM TO MAKE SURE, AND ESPECIALLY THAT WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH OTHER BODIES AND MAKING THAT DECISION COLLECTIVELY. THAT'S NOT AN EASY PROCESS, AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY THAT WE HAVE SPENT, BUT I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE WORK THAT BOTH OUR OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND OUR COUNSEL HAS DONE. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE -- COME BACK OUT OF RETIREMENT TO HELP US WITH THIS, AND I HOPE -- SO, THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. IT'S A REAL SERVICE TO THIS CITY, AND IT'S REALLY EXCELLENT WORK THAT I THINK IS MOVING US IN A DIRECTION, AND I THINK THE ADVICE, WHILE I CAN'T SPEAK TO IT SPECIFICALLY, IS SOUND AND REASONED. SO, YES, I'M FRUSTRATED, BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY NOT JUST TO SAY THAT WE HAVE VOTED ON SOMETHING TO SAY THAT WE TAKE ACTION, IF WE ALSO KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACTION ARE, MAYBE NOT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM AS MUCH AS THE ALTERNATIVE, AND IT'S OUR JOB TO BE ABLE TO WEIGH THOSE TO SAY TO CONSTITUENTS THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE TO US AND THAT WE ARE NOT JUST MAKING SHORT-TERM DECISIONS BUT MAKING DECISIONS IN THE LONG-TERM INTEREST OF OUR WATER SAFETY, AND TO ME, THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT DOING THE POLITICALLY POPULAR THING. IT'S ABOUT -- IT'S NOT ABOUT TAKING ACTION JUST FOR TAKING ACTION. IT IS ABOUT BEING DELIBERATIVE AND CAREFUL AND MAKING SURE FOR A PROBLEM THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO CLEAN UP THAT WE ARE GETTING MORE PROS THAN CONS, AND TO ME THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THE ULTIMATE GOAL.
03:24:16.870: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:24:21.074: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I WOULD LIKE TO JUST BE ADDED AS A SPONSOR. NO, I'M SORRY --
03:24:31.318: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OF THE UNDERLYING MOTION?
03:24:33.353: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APOLOGIZE.
03:24:34.254: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  NO, NO, NO. I GOT IT. WE ARE GOOD. YOU'RE SPONSORING THE POSTPONEMENT YOU DISAGREE WITH... FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE POSTPONEMENT. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS WISE THAT WE HAVE THE CONSENT JUDGMENT IN HAND BEFORE WE MAKE THE DECISION. I THINK, FURTHER, IT'S WISE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISTRIBUTE THE CONSENT JUDGMENT TO THE PUBLIC FOR THEIR FEEDBACK BEFORE WE MAKE ANY DECISION. I BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE CONSENT JUDGMENT. THEY WERE AT THE MEETING ON THURSDAY. THEY UNDERSTAND THE PROS AND CONS OF ENGAGING THE E.P.A. WHEN A CONSENT JUDGMENT IS FINALIZED AND DISTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLIC, AND, FRANKLY, EXPLAINED TO THE PUBLIC BY EXPERTS. I WOULD HOPE THAT DR. LEMKE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE AN EXTENSIVE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD, PRESENTATION PERIOD SO THAT IT COULD BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD. I THINK AT THAT POINT THE CONVERSATION IS RIPE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:25:48.662: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I THINK THAT'S A MASSIVE POINT THAT YOU JUST REMINDED US OF. GOING INTO THIS, IT'S THE PLAN TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION PUBLICLY, TO GET THE PUBLIC FEEDBACK, SO THEY KNOW THE OPTIONS PRESENTED US, AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T OVERLOOK THAT STEP IN THIS DELIBERATIVE PROCESS. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM FOLKS. THEY NEED TO HEAR FROM US. THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S ON THE TABLE. SO WE TAKE THE BEST PATH FO FORWARD, AND SO THANK YOU FOR -- YOU KNOW, I THINK, YOU KNOW, TO DO IT RIGHT, WE HAVE GOT TO DO THIS IN THIS DELIBERATIVE -- TAKE THIS DELIBERATIVE APPROACH, AND I REALLY AM IMPRESSED WITH THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE, AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM BEST INTERESTS OF THE CITY, AND AS YOU KNOW, I SENT YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT A SITE ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO OUR GELMAN PLUME JUST UP THE ROAD IN METAMORE, MICHIGAN, WHERE THE E.P.A. TOOK OVER, AND I WILL SEND YOU A FOLLOW-UP NOTE WITH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION. THEY HAVE A LANDFILL THAT WAS LEECHING 1,4-DIOXANE, AND THE OUTCOME, IT'S NOT A PANACEA. I WILL SEND YOU THE FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO ME. I'LL SEND IT TO YOU NOW, AND I HAVE BEEN MEANING TO SEND IT TO YOU, BUT IT ADDS SOME REGION 5 PERSPECTIVE ON WHERE THIS COULD BE HEADED, AND THESE ARE THE -- YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THESE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS AND UNKNOWNS, FRANKLY, SO -- BUT HAVING THIS, YOU KNOW, ENGAGING WITH THE PUBLIC, HAVING A PUBLIC FORUM, HAVING THIS INFORMATION PROVIDED PUBLICLY IS CRITICAL SO THAT WE MAKE THE RIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE, AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. THANKS.

03:28:34.828: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DC3, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A REQUEST FROM SZR NORTH ANN ARBOR SENIOR LIVING, LLC FOR A NEW CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT CENTER LIQUOR LICENSE, ISSUED UNDER MCL 436.1545(B)(II) TO BE LOCATED AT 1901 PLYMOUTH ROAD, D/B/A ATRIA PARK OF ANN ARBORS MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC3. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:28:52.445: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THIS ITEM IS COMING FROM THE LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW COMMITTEE, AND IT'S TO APPROVE A LIQUOR LICENSE FOR ALTRIA PARK AT 1901 RIVER ROAD. ALL OF THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE APPLICATION, AND THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING FEES OR PROPERTY TAXES. THE LIQUOR LICENSE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS YOUR APPROVAL. THANK YOU.
03:29:12.632: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC4 RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE SETTLEMENT OF MATEO V. FINGERLE AND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, 22ND CIRCUIT COURT, CASE NO. 2018-1114-CH MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF DC4? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:29:37.424: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I'M GLAD THIS DOESN'T REALLY INVOLVE US EXCEPT FOR THE PLATTING ASPECTS OF IT, BUT I KNOW THE MATEO, AND, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE GOOD FOLKS, AND I'M GLAD THEY DIDN'T GET CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THAT FINGERLE NONSENSE, SO I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS, OBVIOUSLY.
03:29:56.576: >> IT'S A RESOLUTION BETWEEN TWO PARTIES, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A COURT ORDER THAT OFFICIALLY CHANGES THE BOUNDARIES. THAT'S IT.
03:30:02.115: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SURE, SURE.
03:30:04.217: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DS1, RESOLUTION TO PROHIBIT ON-STREET PARKING ON BOTH SIDES OF BARTON DRIVE FROM LONGSHORE DRIVE TO IAC TRAIL MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DS1. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:30:28.775: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION. I NOTICED THAT WE ACTUALLY POSTPONED THIS FROM NOVEMBER, AND I HAD TO REMIND MYSELF WHY, AND WHEN I SEARCHED MY EMAIL, I FOUND COMMUNICATION THAT WE GOT FROM THE P.T.O. AT A2STEAM AROUND CONCERNS THAT WE WERE NOT I GUESS LOOKING AT WHERE THE PROBLEM REALLY WAS, THAT ATTENTION NEEDED TO BE PAID TO THE INTERSECTION AT PONTIAC TRAIL AND BARTON. THERE WERE OTHER THINGS IN THIS COMMUNICATION. I GUESS I'M -- WITHOUT HAVING GONE BACK TO LOOK AT THAT MEETING, I'M WONDERING WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL SINCE WE LAST LOOKED AT IT IN NOVEMBER.
03:31:20.927: >> CRAIG HUPY, PUBLIC SERVICES AREA ADMINISTRATOR. NOTHING IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. IT WENT BACK TO US ASKING FOR MORE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, WHICH NICK CAN EXPLAIN WHAT'S BEEN DONE, AND WE ANALYZED SOME OF THE RESPONSES IN MORE DETAIL.
03:31:46.452: >> TO ADD TO THAT, A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE DONE SINCE THIS WAS POSTPONED, WAS WE ATTENDED A MEETING THAT WAS HELD BY THE NORTH SIDE S.T.E.A.M. SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL COMMITTEE AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC THERE. THE OTHER THING THAT WE DID TO TRY TO PARSE OUT THE SUPPORT OR LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY WAS TO -- WE SENT OUT THE PREVIOUS DATA THAT WE HAVE. WE HAD SURVEYED DATA FROM VARIOUS LEVELS CITY-WIDE, NEIGHBORHOOD-WIDE, WARD-WIDE. WE SENT OUT POSTCARDS TO THE RESIDENTS THAT FRONTED ON THAT PORTION OF BARTON DRIVE ITSELF, DIRECT MAILING POSTCARDS AND POLLING THEM ON THEIR SUPPORT FOR IT, AND THAT WAS ALL SUMMARIZED IN THE REPORT THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE RESOLUTION.
03:32:48.648: >> I READ ALL OF THOSE REPORTS, AND I DIDN'T -- I DON'T REMEMBER ONE THAT WAS SPECIFIC TO THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. MAYBE IT WAS IN THE PACKET?
03:32:59.192: >> THERE WAS A -- THERE WAS KIND OF A QUESTION AND ANSWER FROM THAT THAT WAS POSTED ON THE WEBSITE. IT WAS -- THAT WAS -- WE DIDN'T POLL THE ATTENDEES AT THAT MEETING SPECIFICALLY. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE S.T.E.A.M. SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL COMMITTEE WAS PUTTING ON AND ASKED US TO ATTEND, SO WE TALKED TO THE RESIDENTS THAT ATTENDED AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS.
03:33:28.855: >> SO -- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
03:33:31.291: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:33:35.528: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: LATE -- WELL, IT WAS NOT LATE LAST YEAR, BUT LAST YEAR WE APPROVED A $660,000 LOWER TOWN MOBILITY STUDY AFTER MUCH DEBATE AND DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR THAT STUDY TO GIVE US INFORMATION ON THIS SECTION OF THE ROAD? WHEN WOULD WE BE EXPECTING, IF THERE'S ANY WAY YOU CAN TELL ME RIGHT NOW, WHEN THIS SECTION OF ROAD WOULD HAVE BEEN STUDIED ENOUGH TO GIVE US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING? BECAUSE THAT'S A QUESTION AND A CONCERN OF MANY THAT WE HAVE ISSUED THIS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TRANSPORTATION STUDY, AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT COMPREHENSIVE LOOK BEFORE MAKING PATCHWORK DECISIONS.
03:34:38.091: >> I DON'T REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WHAT THE TIME FRAME IS FOR THAT STUDY TO BE COMPLETED. I THINK IT'S LATE THIS YEAR, MAYBE, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE DATE ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE. ONE ADDITIONAL THING I WOULD SAY TOWARDS THAT IS THAT THAT STUDY IS LOOKING AT -- PART OF WHAT THAT STUDY IS LOOKING AT IS THE PONTIAC CORRIDOR, AND I ANTICIPATE THAT THAT STUDY WILL RESULT IN SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BARTON PONTIAC INTERSECTION. I DOUBT VERY MUCH THAT IT WOULD CHANGE THE RECOMMENDATION TO PUT BIKE LANES ON BARTON DRIVE.
03:35:20.466: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  BUT PERHAPS IT COULD HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH THE SPACE BETWEEN CURB TO CURB.
03:35:26.739: >> ON BARTON?
03:35:28.374: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YEAH.
03:35:32.178: >> IT COULD POTENTIALLY, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE NEED FOR BIKE LANES ON THAT CORRIDOR IS IDENTIFIED IN OUR NONMOTORIZED PLAN. I DON'T SEE THE DESIRE FOR BIKE LANES ON THE CORRIDOR CHANGING. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I COULD SEE COMING OUT OF THAT PLAN WOULD BE HOW TO IMPROVE THE INTERSECTION ITSELF.
03:36:01.774: >> CORRECT. THAT'S BEEN A -- IT'S BEEN CALLED TO QUESTION WHETHER WE COULD BE USING A TURN LANE THERE WITH THE AREA THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH, SO -- I MEAN, I HAVE BIKED THIS AREA QUITE A BIT, NOT MUCH RECENTLY AFTER JOINING COUNCIL, UNFORTUNATELY. MILES ARE DOWN, POUNDS ARE UP. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I'M JUST, YOU KNOW, HESITANT ON MAKING ANY CHANGES IN LIGHT OF THIS STUDY THAT WE ISSUED TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS, AND THAT TO ME GIVES ME PAUSE CURRENTLY. I'LL YIELD THE FLOOR TO MY COLLEAGUES.
03:36:48.654: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:36:49.889: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I JUST WANTED TO SAY A FEW REMARKS ABOUT THIS. SO, THE SURVEY -- I RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE SET IN MOTION IN THE PAST, LIKE THIS NONMOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION, THIS NOTION OF CREATING BIKE LANES EVERYWHERE AND SO ON, AND WE ARE KIND OF PIECING TOGETHER. THIS IS SORT OF A FRAGMENT OF THE UNBIKE LANED PORTION. PRIOR TO BIKE LANES -- THIS IS A REMNANT OF TAKING OFF STREET PARKING IN ALL OF THIS AREA, SO IT'S A REMNANT OF REALLY CONVERTING THESE STREETS FROM WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A TRUE NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CARS AND SO ON, TO TRANSIT CORRIDORS. AND THAT'S FINE IF THAT'S WHAT THE GOALS ARE, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE WHEN WE DO THESE SURVEYS, WE COLLECT MORE DATA -- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE DATA IN HERE. I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND IT, BUT I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- LIKE THINGS JUMP OUT ON HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN DIFFERENT FONT SIZES, AND IT DOESN'T LOOK UNIFORM WITH THESE TRAFFIC DATA AND TRAFFIC STUDIES AND STUFF, SO I QUESTION THE REALITY PRESENTED BEFORE ME. SO THE 11 PEOPLE -- THE NINE OR 11 PEOPLE WHO SENT POSTCARDS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT THERE, AND THEY ALL SAID NO THANK YOU. AND IT WAS AN ANTIBIKE LANE SITUATION. THEY ARE NOT AGAINST BIKE LANES OR CONTINUOUS BIKE LANES. THEY ARE MORE TRAFFIC ORGANIZATION OR TRAFFIC CALMING. AND WE DON'T SEE THAT BIKE LANES HAVE HAD THAT EFFECT. THERE HAS BEEN ZERO CALMING BROUGHT ON BY THE BIKE STRIPING ON OUR STREETS. I CAN GUARANTEE THAT. AND WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INTERSECTIONS AND THE CRASH DATA THAT CAME WITH THIS, AND I THANK YOU FOR PUTTING ALL OF THIS ON THERE, YOU SEE SIDE SWIPING, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET AROUND. THEY ARE HANGING UP ON CURBS. THE TRAFFIC AT THE INTERSECTION ISN'T ORGANIZED PROPERLY. IT'S AN 8,000 CAR INTERSECTION DURING SOME PEAK TIMES, 3,000 AND 8,000, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LOT, SO THIS INTERSECTION HAS BASICALLY BECOME A PRIORITIZED INBOUND COMMUTER INTERSECTION, AND WHAT THE PEOPLE REALLY WANT AROUND THIS INTERSECTION IS TRAFFIC ORGANIZATION AND TRAFFIC CALMING AND PRIORITIZATION THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE INTERSECTION SO THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO SNEAK BY OR DRIVE UP ON THE CURBS, AND ALSO SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN THE MASSIVE INBOUND COMMUTER TRAFFIC IS COMING. I CAN TELL YOU MY DAILY EXAMPLE, IT TAKES LONGER TO GET FROM MY HOUSE TO GOING WESTBOUND ON BARTON DRIVE THAN IT TAKES FROM THE SKYLINE EXIT TO THE HIGH SCHOOL'S PARKING LOT, BECAUSE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GETTING A LEFT TURN ON TO PONTIAC TRAIL. EVERY SINGLE CAR THAT MAKES THE LEFT TURN DURING THE RUSH HOUR GAP AT 7:00 OR 9:00 IS RUNNING THE YELLOW AND RED LIGHT, COUNTING ON THE GOODWILL OF THE INBOUND COMMUTER NOT TO RUN THE RED LIGHT THEMSELVES. WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT AROUND THE INTERSECTION IS LEFT TURN SIGNALIZATION TO ALLOW THE TRAFFIC TO FLOW IN THE RIGHT WAY, REDUCE THE FREE FOR ALL, THE SIDESWIPE CRASHES, THE WIDE ANGLE AND SO ON THAT WE SAW IN THE TRAFFIC REPORT. THE LACK OF SUPPORT SHOULDN'T BE CONSTRUED AS ANTIBIKE LANE. IT SHOULD BE THAT THE SOLUTION DOESN'T PRESENT TRAFFIC ORGANIZATION, CALMING AND CONTROL IN A WAY THAT 25-PLUS YEARS OF OBSERVATION HAVE PROVIDED FOR THE RESIDENTS. SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. THAT'S KIND OF THE WORD ON THE STREET FROM THE NEARBY RESIDENTS, AND I ALSO WANT TO THROW OUT THE NOTION THAT IF WE RUN AN ONLINE THING AND, YOU KNOW, A HUNDRED PEOPLE SAY YES TO IT AND 80 OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE WALKING AND BIKING COALITION AND THE OTHER 200 PEOPLE ARE FROM OUT OF STATE BECAUSE THEY WERE ON THE WALKING AND BIKING COALITION'S EMAIL LIST, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE POST-CARDS SENT FROM THE DIRECT NEIGHBORS WEIGH MORE TO ME. I HAVE TO SAY, I WAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THIS ISN'T WHAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS LOOKING FOR.
03:41:23.496: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBERS NELSON AND GRAND.
03:41:25.097: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF MORE QUESTIONS. WE WERE TOLD BY A RESIDENT THAT ADDING BIKE LANES -- I SHOULD BACK UP AND SAY THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT IF THE WEATHER WERE NICER, I WOULD BIKE UP THERE MYSELF AND SEE IT FOR MYSELF. WE WERE TOLD BY A RESIDENT THAT THE INSTALLATION OF THE BIKE LANES IS NOT CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THIS PATH, THAT IT'S NOT THE FULL WIDTH OF A PARKED CAR FOR ALL OF IT, BUT ONLY PART OF IT IS -- I CAN TELL FROM THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE THAT WHAT I'M SAYING DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO YOU. THAT THE -- THAT THE ACTUAL BIKE -- MAYBE IT'S NOT THIS ADDITIONAL PART. MAYBE IT'S JUST GOING EAST WEST ON BARTON DRIVE, THAT THE BIKE LANE ACTUALLY SORT OF SHRINKS AND GROWS. IS THAT ACCURATE?
03:42:15.948: >> BEFORE NICK ANSWERS THAT, WANT TO GO BACK TO A COMMENT MADE ABOUT THE SURVEY. THE SURVEY WAS DONE THROUGH OPEN CITY HALL, SO THE RESPONDENTS ARE VISITED AS TO WHETHER THEY ARE A RESIDENT OR NOT. THEY ARE NOT TAKING ANSWERS FROM OUT OF ANN ARBOR OR OUT OF THE STATE.
03:42:37.603: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, PERHAPS THAT WAS REFERRING TO THE PETITIONS THAT WE RECEIVED.
03:42:43.442: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: UH-HUH.
03:42:44.510: >> THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE.
03:42:46.111: >> YEAH.
03:42:46.378: >> THERE WAS A PETITION, AN ONLINE PETITION THAT WAS DONE.
03:42:49.315: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, THANKS FOR CLARIFYING THAT, MR. HUPY.
03:42:53.452: >> I MIGHT HAVE TO ASK YOU TO REPEAT YOUR QUESTION.
03:42:56.188: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY. SO THE WAY THIS WAS DESCRIBED TO ME BY A RESIDENT WAS THAT THE BIKE LANE IS NOT -- BECAUSE MY QUESTION WAS, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN PROPOSED TO US THAT THE BIKE LANE ISN'T -- A BIKE LANE THERE ISN'T SAFE, AND I WAS STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE A BIKE LANE THAT'S THE WIDTH OF A PARKED CAR IS PLENTY BIG ENOUGH, AND IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE BIKE LANE IS NOT ACTUALLY THE WIDTH OF A PARKED CAR THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH. IT SORT OF EBBS AND FLOWS. IT'S AN INCONSISTENT WIDTH, AND IT'S QUITE NARROW IN SPOTS. MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO ME.
03:43:35.961: >> THE BIKE LANE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THIS SEGMENT WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REMOVING PARKING IS A STANDARD FIVE-FOOT BIKE LANE.
03:43:43.269: >> OKAY.
03:43:43.903: >> A STANDARD BIKE LANE WIDTH FOR MOST PLACES IN ANN ARBOR.
03:43:47.406: >> OKAY.
03:43:47.673: >> WHEN WE GET FURTHER WEST, BEYOND THE AREA THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE, WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS DOING IN THE WESTBOUND DIRECTION IS TO HAVE A PAVED SHOULDER SO THAT THE THERE'S -- IN THE WESTBOUND DIRECTION, THERE WOULD BE A BIKE LANE GETTING ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CITY, BUT IN THIS SECTION THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE, IT'S A STANDARD FIVE-FOOT WIDE BIKE LANE.
03:44:11.964: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY.
03:44:12.865: >> SO IT'S NOT SUBSTANDARD IN ANY WAY.
03:44:16.302: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY. SO I THINK PROBABLY WHAT WAS BEING COMMUNICATED TO ME WAS THE IDEA THAT IT'S NOT -- THE CONNECTIVITY THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED IS ACTUALLY -- I MEAN, IT -- A PAVED SHOULDER IS -- HOW WIDE IS THAT? IT'S NOT A BIKE LANE.
03:44:32.785: >> A PAVED SHOULDER IS FOUR FEET?
03:44:35.888: >> FOUR FEET.
03:44:36.255: >> YEAH, SO IT WOULD BE FURTHER TO THE WEST OUTSIDE OF THIS AREA. IT'S A FOUR-FOOT PAVED SHOULDER, WHICH IS ALSO STANDARD FOR A RURAL SECTION WITHOUT CURB AND GUTTER.
03:44:47.366: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: GOTCHA. OKAY. WELL, MY ONLY OTHER QUESTION WAS -- AND I THINK THIS -- I THINK THIS WAS AN EXPLANATION OF CONVERSATION WITH STAFF, SO YOU CAN VERIFY THIS OR NOT. I THINK SOMEBODY -- A NEIGHBOR SAID THAT IT WAS COMMUNICATED THAT THERE WERE IDEAS ABOUT DOING BUMP-OUTS AT THAT INTERSECTION, AT PONTIAC AND BARTON?
03:45:09.088: >> SO, IF THIS WAS NOT APPROVED FOR THE BIKE LANES, THEN WE WOULD LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL OF DOING BUMP-OUTS AT THE INTERSECTION, WHICH WOULD SHORTEN THE CROSSING DISTANCE FOR PEDESTRIANS AT THE INTERSECTION. IT WOULD ALSO HELP TO CONTROL THE TRAFFIC THAT'S KIND OF CHEATING I GUESS AND TRYING TO SLIP AROUND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TURNING, WHICH HAS SHOWN ITSELF IN SOME OF THE CRASH PATTERNS OUT THERE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT.
03:45:39.284: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY.
03:45:40.185: >> EITHER DOING THAT OR PUTTING IN THE BIKE LANES WOULD HELP TO CONTROL TRAFFIC TO INDICATE THAT THERE'S NOT A SECOND LANE FOR TRAFFIC TO KIND OF SNEAK AROUND. WHICH IT'S DOING UNOFFICIALLY RIGHT NOW. THE OTHER THING I WOULD MENTION, TOO, IS THAT IN TERMS OF WHATEVER IS DONE WITH THE INTERSECTION ULTIMATELY, THE NEED TO REMOVE PARKING ON THIS SEGMENT IN ORDER TO CONNECT THE BIKE LANES ALL THE WAY OUT TO PONTIAC TRAIL IS STILL THERE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A LEFT TURN LANE IS ULTIMATELY ADDED TO THE INTERSECTION OR NOT. WE STILL NEED TO REMOVE PARKING IN ORDER TO GET BIKE LANES THROUGH ALL THE WAY.
03:46:20.759: >> UH-HUH, OKAY. I GUESS I WAS JUST SURPRISED AT THE BUMP-OUT PROPOSAL AS A PLAN B BECAUSE IT'S -- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUMP-OUTS ON THE EASTBOUND BARTON DRIVE? IS THAT BEFORE -- LIKE --
03:46:40.813: >> BOTH SIDES. I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE PROJECT. IT WOULD BE ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDE OF BARTON ON THE EAST SIDE OF PONTIAC TRAIL -- I'M SORRY, ON THE WEST SIDE.
03:46:52.925: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  ON THE WEST SIDE, OKAY.
03:46:54.893: >> IT WOULD MAINTAIN ONE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION AS IT IS ON THE EAST SIDE OF BARTON, ON THE EAST SIDE OF PONTIAC TRAIL, AND IT WOULD PREVENT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING THE CURB AND POTENTIALLY ENDANGERING PEDESTRIANS THAT ARE CROSSING AT THAT RAMP, AND WE HAVE HAD DAMAGE TO INFRASTRUCTURE AT THAT RAMP TOO.
03:47:16.415: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  IS THERE NOT A NEED FOR LEFT TURN LANES THERE?
03:47:19.418: >> WE WON'T KNOW THAT UNTIL THE LOWER TOWN MOBILITY STUDY IS COMPLETE, WHICH IS GOING TO BE AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PROJECT.
03:47:25.924: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY. OKAY. THANKS.
03:47:30.996: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:47:32.030: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. MY UNDERSTANDING, SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF THIS PROJECT, AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, ONE, THAT WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING MEETS OUR COMPLETE STREETS POLICY.
03:47:49.548: >> YES, CORRECT.
03:47:50.616: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  OKAY, TWO, THAT BIKE LANES PROVIDE A VISUAL QUEUE -- THAT NARROWING THE LANES SLOWS DOWN TRAFFIC, AND BIKE LANES PROVIDE A VISUAL CUE THAT CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ONE OR TWO CARS ARE IN SLOWING DOWN TRAFFIC.
03:48:12.771: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
03:48:14.940: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  AND ALSO THAT -- HELPS CREATE GREATER CONNECTIVITY.
03:48:20.712: >> YES.
03:48:21.046: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  SO, TO ME, THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THIS. I ALSO LOOK AT THE DATA, WHICH OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS, WHICH I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE SURPRISING TO ANYONE THAT THEY WOULD PREFER THE ABILITY TO PARK IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE, EVEN IF THEY DON'T CHOOSE TO DO SO ON A REGULAR BASIS, BUT IF WE LOOK AT BOTH THE PUBLIC MEETING AND THE PUBLIC INPUT, I SEE THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN BOTH OF THOSE INSTANCES HAVE SUPPORTED HAVING BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES, SO I PLAN ON SUPPORTING THIS.
03:48:57.015: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:48:57.950: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. SO WHAT I JUST HEARD WAS THAT WE WON'T KNOW WHETHER WE NEED A LEFT TURN LANE AT THIS INTERSECTION UNTIL WE GET THE LOWER TOWN TRAFFIC STUDY BACK, AND SO BASED ON THAT, BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT THE INTERSECTION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN THIS AREA, I MOVE TO TABLE THIS MATTER UNTIL WE GET THE LOWER TOWN TRAFFIC STUDY BACK.
03:49:27.079: >> IF I MAY.
03:49:32.451: >> SECOND.
03:49:33.652: >> I NEED A SECOND.
03:49:39.057: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY MR. HAYNER. MR. HUPY?
03:49:43.662: >> PUTTING BIKE LANES IN NOW DOESN'T PRECLUDE BIKE L-- LEFT TURN LANES IN THE FUTURE.
03:49:56.975: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  IF I MAY?
03:49:58.510: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:50:00.279: >> BUMPOUTS WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE IDEA OF PUTTING A LEFT TURN LANE IN, IF THAT'S WHAT'S RECOMMENDED IN THE LOWER TOWN TRAFFIC STUDY, SO I BELIEVE THAT IT'S PREMATURE TO MAKE THIS DECISION AT THIS POINT IN TIME, BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT AMENABLE TO SUPPORTING REMOVING THESE PARKING SPACES AT THIS POINT IN TIME, BUT IF WE GET BACK INFORMATION IN THAT TRAFFIC STUDY THAT CHANGES MY MIND, THEN WHO KNOWS HOW I'LL SUPPORT -- OR WHAT I'LL VOTE THEN, BUT MY REAL FEAR HERE IS THAT IF WE DENY THIS RESOLUTION AND WE GET BUMPOUTS THAT THAT WILL BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE TO THE REDESIGN THAT THIS INTERSECTION ACTUALLY NEEDS. SO, I'M MOVING TO TABLE THIS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION BEFORE WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS.
03:50:56.501: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I HAVE GOT LUMM AND THEN A QUERY FROM MR. LAZARUS AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:51:03.875: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  NOW SPEAKING TO THE TABLING?
03:51:07.546: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ON THE TABLING, AND MAYBE WE COULD ACCELERATE THIS CONVERSATION.
03:51:14.386: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I WOULD SUPPORT TABLING WITH THE RATIONALE FROM COUNCILMEMBER EATON. JUST IN GENERAL, AND, AGAIN, THIS IS WHY I LEAN TOWARDS TABLING, IT -- IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS RESOLUTION TO ADD BIKE LANES AND PUBLIC PARKING ON BOTH SIDES OF BARTON BETWEEN LONG SHORE AND PONTIAC, WHICH I UNDERSTAND THIS ENTIRE DISTANCE, THREE BLOCKS OR A QUARTER MILE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- I ALSO, IN THIS CASE, I THINK IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE USED TO OBTAIN COMMUNITY INPUT ARE NOT ALWAYS GIVING US THE FULL ANSWER, AND WHEN WE POSTPONED THIS ON NOVEMBER 18TH, WE POSTPONED IT LARGELY BECAUSE WE RECEIVED A GOOD BIT OF FEEDBACK ON THE DAY OF THE MEETING. WE ASKED THE STAFF TO CIRCLE BACK, WHICH THEY DID, WITH THE POSTCARD SURVEY BY ADJACENT RESIDENTS WHO WOULD BE MOST AFFECTED. SO, ZERO, NONE OF THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORS SUPPORT WHAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES. SO I'M LEANING TOWARDS TABLING AT THIS JUNCTURE BECAUSE I TOO WILL NOT SUPPORT REMOVING THE PARKING. ADDING THE BIKE LANES AND ELIMINATING THE PARKING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET, THAT WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE FOLKS WHO LIVE THERE, AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT SOMETHING WHEN THE FOLKS MOST AFFECTED BY IT DON'T WANT IT, AS WAS ARTICULATED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. AND THIS ISN'T JUST A CASE OF OBJECTING TO AN ASSESSMENT. THERE IS NO COST TO THE NEIGHBORS HERE. THEY JUST DON'T WANT WHAT THE CITY IS PROPOSING. YOU KNOW, OCCASIONALLY THERE'S A COMPELLING GREATER GOOD THAT WOULD OUTWEIGH THE NEIGHBORS' PREFERENCES. I DON'T SEE THAT HERE. AND IN TERMS OF PROCESS, CITY STAFF TRIED TO GET INPUT. THERE WAS A PUBLIC MEETING AND A SURVEY AT THE MEETING, AND THERE WAS AN ONLINE SURVEY AS WELL, AND IN BOTH CASES, AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND NOTED, THE PREFERENCES WERE FOR THE BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES AND BY FAIRLY WIDE MARGINS, BUT THEN WE GET STRONG OBJECTIONS THE DAY OF THE MEETING AND AN OVERWHELMING NEGATIVE RESPONSE FROM THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS, WHICH SUGGESTS TO ME THAT IN OUR MEETING SURVEYS AND ONLINE SURVEYS, WE ARE GETTING INPUT FROM ADVOCATES RATHER THAN NEIGHBORS, AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT INPUT FROM ADVOCATES DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOES, OR THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO SURVEYS TO TRY TO GET AND GATHER RESIDENT INPUT. WE SHOULD, BUT THE LESSON HERE LEARNED IS THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN HOW WE INTERPRET THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GATHER. SO I DO NOT SUPPORT REMOVING THE PARKING BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORS ARE CLEAR THAT THIS IS -- THEY DON'T SUPPORT WHAT THE CITY IS RECOMMENDING, AND ALSO, I HADN'T APPRECIATED THAT, YOU KNOW, WITH THE -- WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WANTED US TO NOT ACT ON THIS AT THIS TIME AS WELL, BECAUSE THEY SAID THE INTERSECTION, AS YOU HAVE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR TONIGHT, IS THE BIGGER ISSUE, BUT ADDING BUMPOUTS IS GOING TO EXACERBATE THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. SO I WOULD SUPPORT TABLING. ALTERNATIVELY, I WILL NOT SUPPORT REMOVING THE PARKING.
03:54:46.731: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. LAZARUS?
03:54:48.667: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: MR. HUPY, I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. THIS IS PRIMARILY A RESURFACING PROJECT?
03:54:54.773: >> CORRECT.
03:54:56.641: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT DETERIORATION OF THE PAVEMENT IF WE DON'T DO THE WORK? IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT'S THE CONDITION OF THE PAVEMENT?
03:55:05.450: >> IT NEEDS TO BE RESURFACED NOW.
03:55:08.019: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  SO IF WE DELAY, DOES IT CAUSE IT TO BE A BIGGER PROBLEM LATER?
03:55:15.026: >> I WOULD ASK -- IT WOULD, BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THE RESURFACING WITHOUT THE BIKE LANES.
03:55:21.733: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WHAT WAS THE ANSWER? I --
03:55:23.935: >> WE WOULD STILL GO AHEAD WITH THE RESURFACING BUT STRIPE AS IT IS NOW. BUT THE CONCERNS ARE WE HAVE -- AS WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A CRASH PATTERN THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, AND IT WOULD EITHER -- STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS EITHER BIKE LANES OR BUMPOUTS TO ADDRESS THE CRASH PATTERN THAT IS EXISTING THERE, AND TO REINFORCE WHAT WAS IN THE MATERIAL ALONG WITH THIS, THE NEIGHBORHOOD ITSELF WAS 65% IN SUPPORT OF TAKING THE PARKING OFF AND ADDING THE BIKE LANES. SO, THERE WAS A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE IMMEDIATE RESIDENTS.
03:56:19.958: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  IF I COULD CONTINUE, THOUGH, SO IF THIS GETS TABLED IN UNTIL THE MOBILITY STUDY IS DONE, WE'D LOSE THE WHOLE CONSTRUCTION SEASON?
03:56:27.999: >> NO, WE WOULD GO AHEAD WITH THE REPAVING.
03:56:32.003: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  BUT YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION OF THE CONTRACTOR AWARD, AND WE'D PUT COUNCIL IN AN AWKWARD POSITION, BECAUSE SEVERAL ON THE COMMISSION DON'T WANT TO PUT BUMP-OUTS IN. SO I'M CURIOUS HOW IT WOULD WORK.
03:56:53.992: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THIS IS REPAVEMENT AS A RESULT OF A WATER MAIN PROJECT.
03:56:56.628: >> SO WE ARE GOING TO DO THE REPAVEMENT AND THE WATER MAIN IS GOING TO GO BACK.
03:57:02.033: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:57:05.270: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APPRECIATE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S SENTIMENTS ON AWKWARDNESS, BUT I THINK WE HAVE BROKEN THROUGH THAT. WE HAVE HAD MANY AWKWARD MOMENTS HERE [ LAUGHTER ]. I'M NOT REALLY CONCERNED WITH THAT. YOU KNOW, AND I JUST APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES' SENTIMENTS, YOU KNOW, WHERE WE HAVE THESE CITY-WIDE SURVEYS. WE HAVE A VERY VOCAL GROUP OF ADVOCATES IN OUR COMMUNITY, WHO SOMETIMES SKEW THE MESSAGE THAT WE GET HERE, AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TEN COUNCILMEMBERS, TWO FROM EACH WARD, EACH WARD REPRESENTED WELL, AND WE SEE HERE WHERE THESE NEIGHBORS, AGAIN, ZEROSUPPORT. ZERO SUPPORT, NOT EVEN ONE. I IMAGINE THERE'S A LOT OF RATIONAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAFETY ON THEIR MIND WHO LIVE AT THAT CORNER, WHO SEE THE DAILY DANGERS, WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS MADE. SO THOSE ARE OUR EXPERTS. THOSE ARE OUR FOLKS IN THE TRENCHES. THEY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING EVERY DAY. SO TO COMPLETELY NOT TAKE NOTE OF THAT IS WORRYING. WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD THAT THIS PROJECT HERE IS A RESULT OF THIS POLICY OF ADDING IN BIKE LANES ANYTIME WE DO A SEWERLINE. AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFICIENCIES WE ARE TRYING TO MEET AND SAVE MONEY, UPDATING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, HITTING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE, BUT IT RUNS AMOK, AND WE HAVE CONSTANTLY BEEN PUT AT ODDS HERE AT COUNCIL WE HAVE THESE TYPES OF PROPOSED CHANGES BECAUSE WE ARE PUTTING IN NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND WHETHER THAT'S NECESSARILY THE BEST APPROACH EVERY TIME. HEY, SINCE WE ARE DOING THIS, LET'S DO THIS. LIKE, I GET IT, BUT IT'S NOT FULL PROOF, AND IT REALLY CALLS INTO QUESTION THAT METHODOLOGY. WE ARE KIND OF GIVING AN ULTIMATUM RIGHT NOW. IF WE DON'T APPROVE THIS, THEN WE GET SOMETHING WORSE. I DON'T APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK MANY OF US ARTICULATED THE TRAFFIC CONCERNS HERE, AND THE CONCERNS THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE ANSWERED WITH SOME SOLUTIONS WITH THE LOWER TOWN MOBILITY STUDY. I REALLY HOPE IF THIS DOES NOT PASS, THE BUMP-OUTS DON'T APPEAR ANYTIME SOON, AND I HOPE IT COMES BACK TO COUNCIL. IT'S REALLY TROUBLING THAT WE ARE BOXED IN AND GIVEN, AGAIN, FALSE CHOICES. I THINK A TURN LANE HERE WOULD BE THE BEST SOLUTION. ONE OF THE BIGGEST DANGERS OUT THERE RIDING A BIKE IS, A, POOR CONDITIONS; B, AGGRESSIVE DRIVERS. THAT'S MY BIGGEST DANGER. NOT A LACK OF PAINTED BIKE LANES. I HAVE RIDDEN FIVE, 6,000 MILES A YEAR SOMETIMES. THE BIGGEST DANGER TO ME ARE AGGRESSIVE DRIVERS AND POOR PAVEMENT.
04:00:34.712: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:00:37.215: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I JUST WANTED TO SAY, TO SPEAK AFTER OUR NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS, THE ONE PERSON WHO SAID THEY WOULD LIKE BIKE LANES ON ONE SIDE, TO ROUND OUT THAT COMMENT, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ON THE COMMENT CARD OR NOT TO SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE, WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SAYING IS WE PARK OUR CARS ON THE STREET BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY TOOL AVAILABLE TO US TO TRY TO SLOW DOWN THE TRAFFIC THAT BLOWS THROUGH THE INTERSECTION. HIS SUGGESTION WAS TO PUT A BIKE LANE ON ONE SIDE AND CREATE A PROTECTED BIKE LANE WITH BOLLARDS. IT WAS TO PLEASE PUT BIKE LANES ON ONE SIDE TO HAVE A GENUINE CALMING EFFECT ON THE INTERSECTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME THINGS ARE A LEARNED BEHAVIOR, BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRAFFIC THROUGH THIS INTERSECTION THAT IS NONLOCAL TRAFFIC, I MEAN VERY LOCAL TRAFFIC, IS COMMUTER TRAFFIC, AND THAT'S VARYING TRAFFIC WHO DRIVES IN A MANNER THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND I FEAR WHEN WE ARE ON OUR BICYCLES. AND CHANDLER, THERE IS A SIGN ON CHANDLER HALF A BLOCK FROM THE INTERSECTION THAT IS GOING TO BE PROPERLY RECONFIGURED, AND THANK YOU, STAFF, FOR STRAIGHTENING OUT CHANDLER. THERE'S A SIGN THERE THAT SAYS BIKE ROUTE, AND SO FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, THE 25 YEARS THAT I HAVE LIVED THERE, THAT HAS BEEN THE BIKE ROUTE, AND KNOWING BIKERS GET OFF OF THERE AS FAST AS THEY CAN. THEY GET OFF OF BARTON AS FAST AS THEY CAN. IT'S NOT FOR A LACK OF BIKE LANES. IT'S BECAUSE IT'S AN INSANE INTERSECTION AND THE PAVEMENT CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN HORRENDOUS ALMOST AS LONG AS I HAVE BEEN THERE. I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR THAT UP. THERE WERE OTHER SUGGESTIONS FROM THE RESIDENTS, AND THESE AREN'T ALL ENGINEERS -- SOME ARE -- THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER, MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH LOOKING AT THE TRAFFIC CALMING AROUND THIS INTERSECTION, THAN ESPECIALLY NECKING IT DOWN AND HANGING AN ISLAND IN AN INTERSECTION THAT HAS VERY POOR SIGHT LINES. I WILL SUPPORT TABLING THIS.
04:02:48.079: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TABLING? BRIEFLY I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THE TABLING BECAUSE I SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING MOTION. THE RESIDENTS WHO RESPONDED -- THE VERIFIED RESIDENTS WHO RESPONDED TO OUR OPEN CITY HALL SURVEY ARE VASTLY IN FAVOR OF THIS, FROM A SAMPLE OF ABOUT -- OF 209. FROM WARD 1, WE HAVE 133 PEOPLE, 73% OF WHOM FAVOR THE RESOLUTION. WE HEAR FROM OUR ENGINEERS THAT THIS IS DESIGNED TO AFFECT OBSERVED SAFETY CONCERNS AND HARMS AT THIS LOCATION. FURTHER, WE HEAR THAT THE PAINTING OF THE BIKE LANES AFTER THE REPAVING IS NOT GOING TO PRECLUDE ANY SOLUTION THAT WOULD BE OFFERED BY THE LOWER TOWN MOBILITY STUDY. SO NONE OF OUR OPTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. WE WOULD BE EFFECTING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND EFFECTING THE SAFETY ADVICE OF OUR ENGINEERS. TO ME, IT'S A NO-BRAINER. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE TABLING? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.

04:04:32.817: >> WE DO.
04:04:33.317: >> WE HAVE TWO MORE -- (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) --
04:04:37.054: >> WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION FOR PENDING LITIGATION ON TWO ITEMS. ONE IS THE GELMAN MATTER IN WASHTENAW COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT. THE OTHER IS A CASE CALLED -- THE PLAINTIFF IS STAHLBERG VERSUS THE CITY. IT A WASHTENAW COUNTY COURT CASE. THE THIRD ITEM THAT CAME UP THAT MR. CRAWFORD WANTED US TO PUT ON WAS A PURCHASE OF REAL PROPERTY, AND THAT WOULD BE THE THIRD ITEM. IT IS PLACED BEFORE DS2. YOU HAVE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION OF THAT ITEM, BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT NECESSITATES A CLOSED SESSION ON THAT ITEM. IT'S REALLY FOR THE COUNCIL TO DECIDE.
04:05:22.600: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MAY I JUST ASK WHETHER ANYBODY NEEDS A CLOSED SESSION ON DS2? CAN WE BY ACCLAIMATION --
04:05:37.715: >> I WOULD MOVE TO OPEN THE AGENDA.
04:05:40.318: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? THE AGENDA IS REOPENED.
04:05:46.624: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I WOULD MOVE THAT WE MOVE THE CLOSED SESSION UNTIL AFTER WE ARE DONE WITH DS2 AND DS3.
04:05:55.900: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HOW ABOUT AFTER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL?
04:05:58.336: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  OKAY.
04:05:58.970: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? AYE. OPPOSED? I'M BEING FLIP HERE. ARE WE OKAY WITH THIS?
04:06:05.843: >> TO DISCUSS TWO AND THREE. YOU'RE SAYING PRIOR TO CLOSED IS EDUCATION?
04:06:10.114: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THE CLOSED SESSION IS GOING TO RUN WHERE IT NORMALLY IS, WHICH IS AFTER COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS.
04:06:15.453: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. I FULLY SUPPORT THAT.
04:06:20.591: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WITH APOLOGIES TO FOLKS FROM OUT OF TOWN. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CRANKINESS? NO? GOOD. DS2, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE 2019 RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE BOARD OF INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI -- COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:06:46.183: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU FOR A VERY HELPFUL AND INFORMATIVE MEMO ON THIS MATTER AND ON THE INSURANCE BOARD CLAIMS REVIEW PROCESSES. ALONG WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, I SERVE ON THE INSURANCE BOARD AND CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY HAS A ROBUST FAIR PROCESS OF REVIEWING CLAIMS FOLKS MAKE AGAINST THE CITY. THE CITY DOES NOT REJECT CLAIMS WITHOUT A SOUND JUSTIFICATION, AND THE PROCESS PROVIDES FOLKS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL TO THE INSURANCE BOARD, AND THAT'S THE CASE WITH THIS CLAIM. THE CLAIM WAS INVESTIGATED AND APPEALED, AND THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE IS JUST NOT ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY CAUSED THE SEWER BACKUP, SO THE CLAIM WAS DENIED. I RECOGNIZE SEWER BACKUPS ARE ANYTHING BUT FUN AND CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE, AND I DO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS WHEN IT HAPPENS. THAT'S TRUE HERE AS WELL, BUT WITHOUT CAUSATION, THE CITY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE, AND IT WOULD BE FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO PAY CLAIMS WHEN THE CITY IS NOT THE CAUSE. IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOT HAD THE CHANCE TO READ THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE'S ADVICE ON THIS, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT. IT NOT ONLY HAS THE RELEVANT FACTS ON THIS PARTICULAR MATTER, IT ALSO DESCRIBES THE PROCESS THE BOARD USES. HOPEFULLY YOU'LL GET COMFORT AND A SENSE OF THE BOARD'S WORK AND THAT WE ARE TREATING RESIDENTS FAIRLY AND CONSISTENTLY. THE INSURANCE BOARD CONTINUES TO RECOMMEND YOUR APPROVAL. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING, AND MR. HALMAN, THANK YOU FOR COMING AGAIN THIS EVENING, MR. PETTIGREW AND MS. -- ALSO ADVISED THE BOARD OF INSURANCE, AND I APPRECIATE YOUR STAYING LATE THIS EVENING, SHOULD THERE BE ANY QUESTIONS OR FURTHER CONCERNS ARTICULATED. THANK YOU.
04:08:32.356: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:08:35.860: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE STAFF'S TIME AND WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE THIS. MR. HALMAN IS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE, SO I FELT IT WAS MY DUTY TO SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF AND HIS INTEREST AND MAKE SURE THAT THE DUE PROCESS WAS FOLLOWED THROUGH. WE HAVE GOTTEN COMMUNICATIONS FROM STAFF AND OUR CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO PUT LIGHT ON THE CASE FOR US, FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT ON THE INSURANCE REVIEW BOARD, AND I WAS SATISFIED WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD AND TO KNOW THAT THE PROCESS WAS FOLLOWED TO THE ORDINANCE AND TO BEST PRACTICES. SO, I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M SATISFIED THAT THE DUE PROCESS WAS DONE PROPER.
04:09:29.346: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ]. OPPOSED?
04:09:37.988: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  ONE SINGLE.
04:09:41.692: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'M SORRY?

04:10:14.125: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DS3, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A PURCHASE ORDER WITH DTE ENERGY (DTE) TO CONDUCT INITIAL ENGINEERING AND DISTRIBUTION STUDIES REGARDING A POTENTIAL SOLAR ENERGY FACILITY ON AND SURROUNDING THE ANN ARBOR LANDFILL (NOT TO EXCEED $90,000.00) MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DS3. I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY FROM THE JUMP THAT THIS IS PART OF AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE. AS WE ALL KNOW, WE HAVE DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY A LITTLE BIT AGO. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN, AND VERY FEW ELEMENTS OF THAT PLAN ARE AS READILY APPARENT AS THE NEED TO BUILD AND SUPPORT SOLAR INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THIS IS -- THIS IS A BIG ONE, AND IT'S SUPER EXCITING THAT IT'S GOING FORWARD, OR THAT I'M ASSUMING THAT IT IS GOING FORWARD, AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE GOOD WORK THAT STAFF HAS BEEN DOING AND THAT OUR CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN DOING TO DATE GETTING THIS OFF THE GROUND, GETTING THIS MOVING FORWARD AND IN NEIGHBORHOODS JURISDICTIONS. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:11:14.185: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. GOING FORWARD, PERHAPS A FINANCING PLAN WOULD BE NICE FOR ALL PROJECTS, AND THIS IS A LARGE PROJECT, AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR THEIR HELPFUL RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS I SUBMITTED. THIS IS TO CONDUCT ENGINEERING AND DISTRIBUTION STUDIES RELATED TO POSSIBLY CONSTRUCTING A SOLAR FACILITY AT THE CITY'S LANDFILL. THE RESOLUTION HERE IS NOT TO CONSTRUCT THE SOLAR FACILITY. THAT COMES LATER, BUT TO CONDUCT THESE TWO STUDIES WHICH, IN TOTAL, WILL COST ABOUT $90,000 AND ARE NECESSARY INITIAL STEPS IF THE SOLAR FACILITY IS TO BE INSTALLED. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE THE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED STEPS, BUT I WANTED TO RAISE A CONCERN ABOUT INFORMATION SHARING. THE SOLAR FACILITY WILL LIKELY COST BETWEEN 40 AND $50 MILLION, AND DTE WILL NOT BE PAYING FOR IT. I THINK MOST FOLKS WOULD AGREE THOSE ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT PIECES OF INFORMATION, BUT I LEARNED OF THEM ONLY BY ATTENDING THE MEETING WITH PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. THEY WERE NOT MENTIONED IN EITHER THE COVER MEMO TO THIS RESOLUTION OR THE MEMO SENT TO COUNCIL ON DECEMBER 30TH. I ASKED WHY THAT INFORMATION WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RESOLUTION FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE, AND THE RESPONSE WAS THAT TONIGHT'S RESOLUTION WAS JUST FOR THE STUDIES AND THE MEMO FOCUSES ON THE MATTER AT HAND. I GET THAT, AND IT'S TECHNICALLY CORRECT, BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT SHARING INFORMATION AS IMPORTANT AS THE COST, WHICH AT 40 TO $50 MILLION IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT, AND THE FACT THAT DTE ISN'T FUNDING IT PROVIDES IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE TO THE PUBLIC AND TO COUNCILMEMBERS ON WHAT WE ARE BEING ASKED TO POTENTIALLY EMBARK UPON. THIS ISN'T A HUGE DEAL, AND I AM SURE THERE WAS NO INTENTION TO HIDE ANYTHING. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT. I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THE TRAIN STATION EXPERIENCE, WHERE THE LACK OF FULL DISCLOSURE ALONG THE WAY MADE THE NEVER-ENDING STUDIES AND COST OVERRUNS THAT MUCH MORE FRUSTRATING FOR THE COMMUNITY. LET'S ERR ON THE SIDE OF TRANSPARENCY AND SHARING KEY INFORMATION WITH FOLKS ON MAJOR PROJECTS LIKE THIS. WITH THAT SAID, LET ME REPEAT, I AM SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT. IF THE CITY IS GOING TO MOVE TOWARDS CARBON NEUTRALITY AND ASK RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES TO SACRIFICE TO GET THERE, WHICH WE'LL BE DOING, THE FIRST PLACE TO START IS WITH THE CITY OPERATIONS THEMSELVES, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOES. THANKS AGAIN TO STAFF FOR THE HELPFUL ANSWERS TO MY QUESTIONS, AND THANK YOU ALL FOR LISTENING.
04:13:57.848: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. THANK YOU.
04:14:05.055: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM DOES FOR THIS BODY. SHE REALLY ASKS A LOT OF QUESTIONS, AND WE GET INFORMATION THAT WE JUST WOULD NEVER GET OTHERWISE, AND SHE'S ALSO BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT IN WHAT SOME WOULD CALL A TRAIN WRECK WITH THE TRAIN STATION, HOW WE STARTED SPENDING MONEY AND MORE MONEY AND MORE MONEY, MORE MONEY, AND SO THE COST OF THIS PROJECT, AND I UNDERSTAND YOU NEED TO DO A CERTAIN STUDY OR A SERIES OF STUDIES TO GET TO THAT POINT, AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW THE COST BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, BUT SO PERHAPS WITH EVERYBODY HERE TONIGHT, YOU CAN KIND OF EXPLAIN TO US IN A SYNOPSIS HOW THIS WOULD TRANSPIRE AND HOW -- WHEN WE'D LEARN AND WHAT KIND OF COMMITMENT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE, SO WHEN WE HITCH OUR WAGON TO SOMETHING, IT DOESN'T TAKE US DOWN. SO IF WE CAN GET SOME IDEAS OF SOME MORE INFORMATION, WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE TO THIS POINT, BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT IDEA. OBVIOUSLY, IT GETS US TO OUR GOALS THAT WE WANT TO GET TO, BUT WITHOUT HELP FROM DTE, HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS MONUMENTAL LIFT AS A SMALL COMMUNITY?
04:15:39.783: >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, FOR THE QUESTION. SO, IN TERMS OF PROCESS, SO I'LL START WITH THAT, BECAUSE -- IS THAT FAIR TO SAY? THERE'S A QUESTION AROUND PROCESS? YEAH. SO THESE FIRST TWO STUDIES GIVE US EXACTLY THAT. IT GIVES US THE INSIGHT INTO THE SITE ITSELF TO UNDERSTAND IF IT'S TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE AND WHAT KINDS OF COSTS MIGHT GO IN TO THE PROJECT ITSELF. SO WE CAN'T GIVE AN ACTUAL NUMBER AT THE MOMENT. THE NUMBER THAT WAS QUOTED IS KIND OF FROM THE INITIAL SITE DESIGN, KIND OF HIGH LEVEL THOUGHT, AND IT WAS PLUS OR MINUS 30%, SO THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF DETAIL IN THAT NUMBER, SO SO THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T BRING IT FORWARD, BECAUSE PLUS OR MINUS 30% IS A LOT ON A PROJECT. SO WE NEED TO KIND OF REFINE THAT AND COME BACK. SO THESE TWO STUDIES WILL GIVE US A SENSE OF IS THIS A VIABLE PROJECT. CAN WE ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD? AT WHICH POINT WE WILL COME TO COUNCIL WITH MUCH MORE CLARITY IN THE NEXT STEP AND SAY, OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE THINK THE NEXT ROUND OF COSTS WILL BE, HERE'S WHAT THIS PROCESS LOOKS LIKE, AND WE CAN MAKE A DECISION ON IF THIS IS MORE VIABLE. I'M ALSO GOING TO PAUSE FOR A SECOND BECAUSE I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES FROM DTE HERE, AND I WANT THEM TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE PROS IN THIS PROCESS IN A WAY THAT I AM NOT, SO I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE MICHAEL RIVET TO COME FORWARD AND SHARE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROCESS FROM THE DTE SIDE.
04:16:56.126: >> HELLO. THANKS FOR HAVING ME TODAY. AS MISSY MENTIONED, WE ARE IN THE FEASIBILITY STAGE, SO WHAT WE DID WALK THROUGH A TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY STUDY USING AN ENGINEERING CONTRACTOR TO SEE WHAT THE SITE CAN DO SOLAR WISE. WE HAVE SEEN THE 30% NUMBER QUOTED AT 40-$50 MILLION, PLUS OR MINUS -- PERCENT, SO A $12 MILLION SWING IN EITHER WAY, A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES TO SEE AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORK. THESE STUDIES RIGHT NOW THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT GETTING FUNDING FOR IS THE INTERCONNECTION STUDY, SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT LOOKS AT -- WE HAVE 24 MEGAWATTS THAT WE THINK WE CAN PUT ON THE SITE. IT'S GOING TO PRODUCE X AMOUNT OF MEGAWATT HOURS. WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE GRID? WE HAVE CALLED OUT -- WHEN YOU GENERATE THAT MUCH ELECTRICITY AND YOU INJECT IT ON THE GRID, WHAT DOES IT DO? DO YOU NEED ANY UPGRADES? SO THIS STUDY WILL LOOK AT WHAT MEANS AND HOW MUCH IT WILL COST TO PUT A GENERATOR THERE. IT'S NOT GOING TO TELL US HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO COST OR HOW MUCH RAYS ARE GOING TO COST. THAT'S GOING TO COME THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS. THIS IS GOING TO TELL US IF YOU PUT 24 WATTS ON THE GRID RIGHT THERE, HOW MUCH WOULD IT IMPACT THE GRID AND HOW MUCH WOULD YOU HAVE TO PAY TGRADE THE SYSTEM.
04:18:29.186: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  IF I COULD FOLLOW UP, AT WHAT POINT DOES DTE BECOME A FINANCIAL PARTNER IN THIS? WHEN DOES THAT HELP COME IN FINANCIALLY?
04:18:38.695: >> YEAH, THE WAY WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS PROJECT RIGHT NOW IS IT IS A SECTION 61 COMPLIANT PROJECT, WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS A VOLUNTARY PROJECT. WE DO NOT HAVE A CAPACITY NEED RIGHT NOW, SO WE ARE NOT GOING AHEAD AND BUILDING A PROJECT TO SUPPLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO BE SUPPLYING ONLY THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AND LIKELY PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP. SO, IN THAT CASE, WHAT WE DO IS WE NORMALLY FINANCE OUR PROJECTS SO THAT ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS PAY THROUGH A TARIFF OR A RATE. IN THAT CASE, THAT TARIFF OR RATE WILL JUST BE SUBJECT TO THE TWO CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD BE GETTING THE ENERGY, PITTSFIELD AND ANN ARBOR. SO IT WOULD BE FINANCED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WE DO ANY OTHER UTILITY INVESTMENT. IT JUST WOULDN'T ROLL INTO OTHER CUSTOMERS' RATES. IT WOULD JUST ROLL INTO THE MUNICIPAL CUSTOMERS WHO ARE SUBSCRIBING TO THIS ARRAY.
04:19:29.813: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  AND WHAT AMORTIZED RATE? HOW MANY YEARS ARE YOU AMORTIZING THAT COST?
04:19:36.086: >> ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS, WE WOULD NORMALLY DO WHAT WE CALL A LEVELIZED COST OF ENERGY. AND THIS WILL GET A LITTLE TECHNICAL, SO I APOLOGIZE AND PLEASE ASK ME TO CLARIFY IF YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING. WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL TAKE THE PROJECT COST, AND THIS INCLUDES OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND OTHER COSTS, AND IN THIS CASE, THERE PROBABLY WON'T BE LAND COSTS, BUT IT WOULD INCLUDE ALL OF THOSE, AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU DO A PRESENT VALUE, DO A DOLLAR PER MEGAWATT HOUR. NORMALLY, FOR SOLAR, YOU WOULD SEE ANYWHERE FOR 25-35 YEARS, AND AS -- PARTNERING WITH THE CITY, IT WILL REALLY BE WHAT WE THINK TOGETHER WOULD BE THE RIGHT NUMBER.
04:20:30.607: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APOLOGIZE, BUT THIS IS VERY FASCINATING. WE TALK ABOUT 25-35 YEARS, EVEN WITH THAT 30% SWING IN OUR FAVOR, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WILL BE ASSESSED TO E TWO CONSUMERS.
04:20:46.857: >> SO THE WAY THAT THAT WOULD WORK IS ALL STILL BEING DETERMINED, BUT LIKELY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY HAS A MARKET VALUE TOO. SO YOU WOULD PAY FOR THAT ASSET, AND THEN WE WOULD GET THE CREDIT THAT THAT GENERATES ON THE MARKET. RIGHT? SO IT'S NOT JUST A FLAT MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS PART OF WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE NEGOTIATED, BECAUSE THERE'S VALUE, RIGHT, IN THAT ENERGY BEING SOLD ON THE MARKET. SO WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE ASSET, BUT THAT ASSET IS ALSO GENERATING ENERGY THAT'S GOING OUT, AND WE'D GET A CREDIT FOR WHAT IT GENERATES. SO IT'S NOT JUST A MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S A MILLION MINUS WHATEVER WE MAKE ON THE MARKET. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
04:21:19.356: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  IT DOES. IT JUST -- YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO PREDICT WHAT THAT VALUE IS.
04:21:23.393: >> YEAH, SO WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE CLARITY AS WE GET CLOSE, RIGHT, LIKE AS WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE LOCK IN, AND ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT THIS KIND OF CONTRACT, GOOD OR BAD, IF WE GO FORWARD -- AND THIS IS AN IF. WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS PUBLICLY, I SAY WE ARE AT STEP TWO OF TEN. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. AS WE GET FURTHER DOWN THE LINE, WE WOULD LOCK IN AN ENERGY RATE. WE WOULD KNOW IF WE HAVE AN OIL SHORTAGE, WE HAVE LOCKED IN THE RATE. WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CHANGES BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS ASSET IN PLACE. I ALSO WANTED TO IDENTIFY SOMETHING THAT PROCEDURALLY WE ARE WORKING OUT RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH DTE, WORKING WITH BOTH ORGANIZATIONS' LEGAL DEPARTMENTS THAT ADDRESSES THESE. ALSO, WITH REGARDS TO PROCESS, WE WOULD WORK WITH OUR UTILITY. IF WE BID THIS PROJECT OUT AND HAD A PRIVATE DEVELOPER COME AND DEVELOP THIS FOR US, THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO TO DTE AND DO THESE STUDIES, WHICH MUST BE DONE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KNOW IF THE GRID CAN HANDLE THE ENERGY.
04:22:25.422: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:22:26.256: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW WITH THE PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP MEETING, THERE WERE MANY GOOD QUESTIONS ASKED, AND IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT -- AND TO FOLLOW UP ON COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S GOOD QUESTION ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTION, WHY ISN'T DTE A FINANCIAL PARTNER IN THIS ENDEAVOR, IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THE SAME ANSWER THAT YOU DID AT THE MEETING, WHICH YOU SAID THAT DTE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO IS 12% OR -- COULD YOU ELABORATE? [ OFF MIC ]. RIGHT, SO BASICALLY THEY DON'T HAVE TO. I'M PARAPHRASING, BUT THIS IS OVER AND ABOVE WHAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO DO ESSENTIALLY, RIGHT? SO YOU ARE NOT OPTING IN AS A FINANCIAL PARTNER. AGAIN, I'M REALLY GOING TO PUSH FOR THAT. I DON'T FIND THAT ACCEPTABLE. I JUST DON'T. AND, YOU KNOW, I WANT YOU TO BE, YOU KNOW, MORE OF AN AT THE TABLE PARTNER, AND ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED AT THE MEETING, AND IT WAS STATED AT THE MEETING THAT THIS WAS IN THE 45 TO $50 MILLION RANGE, AND SOMEONE ASKED, AND YOU COULD SEE IT FROM SOME OF MY QUESTIONS, HOW MANY HOURS OF SUNLIGHT WE HAVE, HOW THIS -- HOW -- WHAT PERCENTAGE WOULD IT BE OPERATIONAL AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS WOULD OPERATE 18.5 TO 19% OF THE TIME. SO THERE'S A LOT MORE INFORMATION AS WE DRILL DOWN THAT NEEDS TO BE SHARED SO WE CAN MAKE A, YOU KNOW, WELL-INFORMED DECISION AND RECOMMENDATION. IN THE MEANTIME, I UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE CARLISLE WARTMANN WAS THERE, THERE ARE PLANNING ADVISORS FOR PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP, AND THEY ARE NOW DEVELOPING THE SITE PLAN WORK WHICH IS GOING TO DO THE PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE A PLANNING COMMISSION, BUT CERTAINLY THEIR TOWNSHIP TRUSTEES. WHAT'S THE TIMING ON THAT, AND HOW WILL THAT -- WILL THAT OCCUR BEFORE OR AFTER WE GET FOLLOW-UP, A FINANCIAL PLAN AND A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING?
04:24:47.764: >> GREAT QUESTION.
04:24:48.431: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  WHERE IS THAT IN THIS? (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) --
04:24:52.268: >> THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION. THERE ARE BASICALLY PARALLEL TRACKS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. ONE IS THIS ANALYSIS OF TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY OR THAT'S BEFORE YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GRID CAN ACTUALLY HANDLE. SIMILARLY, AND AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS WITH PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP TO AMEND THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM TO ALLOW SOLAR ON SITE, SO THAT PUBLIC MEETING THAT WE HAD TWO WEEKS AGO WAS TO TALK ABOUT THE P.U.D. AMENDMENT ITSELF. AND WHAT HAPPENED FOR ANYONE WHO WAS AT THAT MEETING, IT WAS A VERY GOOD MEETING. IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING. WE LEARNED A LOT. THE BASIC GIST WAS THERE'S NOT REALLY A LOT OF COMMENTS ON THE SITE ITSELF, ACTUALLY. IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT, AND SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY ALREADY FILED THE ZONING AMENDMENT WITH PITTSFIELD. WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME COMMENTS BACK. WE ARE GOING TO REVISE, AND THEN IT'S GOING TO BE FEBRUARY IF WE GET IT IN, OR IT WILL BE MARCH. WE'LL GO TO THE PLANNING OUTBOARD.
04:25:50.393: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I GUESS I DIDN'T EXPRESS MY -- THANK YOU FOR THAT. WE HAVE A CHICKEN AND EGG THING. CARLISLE WARTMANN IS BUILDING A SITE PLAN, AND THAT'S AN UNKNOWN, BUT THERE'S ALL OF THIS OTHER INFORMATION THAT IS CRITICAL BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT. I KNOW YOU DO THESE STUDIES. I'M SUPPORTING THIS. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE ON MORE OF A PARALLEL -- YOU KNOW, ONE IS BEING ADVANCED WITHOUT A LOT OF THIS OTHER IMPORTANT CRITICAL INFORMATION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE PRIOR TO MOVING THIS, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF A, YOU KNOW, APPROVING A SITE PLAN FOR EXAMPLE. THAT'S -- THAT'S A BIG STEP FORWARD, SO THANK YOU.
04:26:39.375: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION, AND PERHAPS IF THERE -- I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE LOTS OF QUESTION ABOUT THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE, AND THEY ARE IMPORTANT ONES TO AIR, BUT IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL ONES, IN LIGHT OF THE TIME, MAYBE THOSE CAN BE ADDRESSED OFFLINE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] IT IS APPROVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE COMMUNICATION THE TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
04:27:06.803: >> NO, MAYOR.
04:27:08.371: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE PLEASE TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? WE NOW COME TO COMPLICATION PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
04:27:52.515: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING THROUGH MY HEAD THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. AS YOU KNOW, AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A PRIORITY FOR ME, AND I WANT TO PREFACE THIS BY SAYING TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI THIS ISN'T AN ATTACK ON YOU IN THE LEAST. I REALLY RESPECT YOU, HAVING A LOCAL BUSINESS THAT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY ENJOYS, AND IT'S A MEETING PLACE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT WITH -- I HAVE BEEN EXPANDING MY KNOWLEDGE AND FOUND OUT WE MADE ANOTHER TOP TEN LIST, WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF Y'ALL ARE AWARE. WE ALL LOVE THOSE, RIGHT? WELL, ANN ARBOR IS THE FIFTH MOST SEGREGATED COMMUNITY IN THE NATION, ECONOMICALLY WISE, AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT BREAKDOWNS FOR THAT. I THINK WE COME IN AT NUMBER TWO FOR SERVICE INDUSTRY FOLKS, AND SO I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU IN PARTICULAR, MR. RAMLAWI ABOUT HOW MANY OF YOUR EMPLOYEES LIVE IN ANN ARBOR OR CAN AFFORD TO LIVE HERE AT 30% A.M.I. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR YOU, IT'S FOR EVERYBODY IN ANN ARBOR THAT Y'ALL NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR. AND SO ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I'M GETTING INTO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME IS THE POLICIES OF POLICING IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND WITH THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, I HAVEN'T EDUCATED MYSELF ENOUGH ON THE PARTICULARS OF THIS, BUT, YOU KNOW, WITH EVERYBODY UNANIMOUSLY VOTING FOR ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER, WE HAVE HIRED THREE NEW POLICE OFFICERS SINCE THE CREATION OF THE COMMISSION, AND IT'S LIKE THE POLICE ARE POLICING THEMSELVES WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE INDEPENDENT, SO THAT REALLY CONCERNS ME WITH PEOPLE I HAVE TALKED TO FROM THE DELANA CENTER WHO ARE TARGETED BY THE POLICE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND I WANTED TO INVITE ALL OF YOU TO GO DOWN TO THE CENTER AND HAVE A MEAL THERE. IF YOU WANT A BUDDY, I'LL GO WITH YOU, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY -- IT'S ON BORDER OF WARD 5 AND WARD 1, I BELIEVE, BUT IT SERVES PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER. AND LASTLY, I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME, BUT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THE ISSUE OF ANTI-SEMITISM. I'M NOT JEWISH, I'M NOT MUSLIM, AND THIS ISN'T -- THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR THE SAFETY OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND I DID WANT TO RECOGNIZE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S POINT THAT MUSLIMS ARE ALSO PERSECUTED, BROWN PEOPLE ARE PERSECUTED IN A WAY THAT JEWISH AREN'T ALWAYS BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN, AND WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER AND HATE IN WHATEVER FORM IS HATE.
04:31:17.820: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. A MOTION, PLEASE, TO GO INTO THE AFOREMENNED CLOSED SESSION FOR THE PURPOSE OF --
04:31:33.603: >> THERE ARE TWO MATTERS THAT I LISTED BEFORE THAT ARE PENDING LITIGATION, WHICH IS THE GELMAN MATTER, THE WASHTENAW COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT MATTER AND A CASE CALLED STAHLBERG VERSUS THE CITY, WHICH IS ALSO A WASHTENAW COUNTY MATTER, AND A LAND USE ISSUE, ALL UNDER THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT.
