IS THIS JUST AS AN EFFECTIVE    

01:28:35.170 --> 01:28:37.970
SHRUBS AS WELL AS THE TREES.    
IS THIS JUST AS AN EFFECTIVE

WIDE CONFLICTING LAND USE       
BUFFER SO BUT YOU&apos;RE CORRECT    
THE GOAL OF THAT IS TO PREVENT

SO THE PARKING IS BASED ON THE  
NUMBER OF STAFF MEMBERS AND

01:32:50.157 --> 01:32:50.890
BACKYARD.                       
SO THERE ARE MATURE TREES TO    
THE SOUTH SIDE OF THAT SITE.    

01:32:50.892 --> 01:32:51.924
SO THERE ARE MATURE TREES TO

02:32:46.884 --> 02:32:47.983
DID NOT ALLOW FOR THAT GRANULAR

IT COULD OF COURSE BE DONE BUT  

02:32:47.985 --> 02:32:50.786

IT COULD OF COURSE BE DONE BUT  
IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE TIME.     

02:32:50.788 --> 02:32:52.053
IT COULD OF COURSE BE DONE BUT  
IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE TIME.     
I THINK IT&apos;S JUST THE CADENCE   

02:32:52.055 --> 02:32:55.290
IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE TIME.     
I THINK IT&apos;S JUST THE CADENCE   
OF I GUESS IS KIND OF MY REVIEW 

02:32:55.292 --> 02:32:55.925
I THINK IT&apos;S JUST THE CADENCE   
OF I GUESS IS KIND OF MY REVIEW 
AND UNDERSTANDING EIGHT FEET,   

02:32:55.927 --> 02:32:56.658
OF I GUESS IS KIND OF MY REVIEW 
AND UNDERSTANDING EIGHT FEET,   
FOUR TREES AND EIGHT FEET FOR   

02:32:56.660 --> 02:32:59.127
AND UNDERSTANDING EIGHT FEET,   
FOUR TREES AND EIGHT FEET FOR   
PEDESTRIAN SPACE FOR THE        

02:32:59.129 --> 02:33:02.564
FOUR TREES AND EIGHT FEET FOR   
PEDESTRIAN SPACE FOR THE        
CONTINUANCE OF THE INSTEAD      

02:33:02.566 --> 02:33:03.432
PEDESTRIAN SPACE FOR THE        
CONTINUANCE OF THE INSTEAD      
EIGHT FEET FOR PEDESTRIAN SPACE 

02:33:03.434 --> 02:33:07.569
CONTINUANCE OF THE INSTEAD      
EIGHT FEET FOR PEDESTRIAN SPACE 
AND THEN TREES INCREMENTALLY    

02:33:07.571 --> 02:33:08.304
EIGHT FEET FOR PEDESTRIAN SPACE 
AND THEN TREES INCREMENTALLY    
PINCHING MAYBE THAT DOWN TO SIX 

02:33:08.306 --> 02:33:10.806
AND THEN TREES INCREMENTALLY    
PINCHING MAYBE THAT DOWN TO SIX 
FEET OR FIVE FEET AT POINTS     

02:33:10.808 --> 02:33:11.474
PINCHING MAYBE THAT DOWN TO SIX 
FEET OR FIVE FEET AT POINTS     
WHEN THOSE TREES ARE PLANTED    

02:33:11.476 --> 02:33:17.847
FEET OR FIVE FEET AT POINTS     
WHEN THOSE TREES ARE PLANTED    
WITH A PASSABLE                 

02:33:31.495 --> 02:33:33.762
                GRATE ON TOP    
OF THOSE ROOTS ALLOW YOU TO     
NARROW THAT AND MAINTAIN A MORE 

02:33:33.764 --> 02:33:34.230
OF THOSE ROOTS ALLOW YOU TO     
NARROW THAT AND MAINTAIN A MORE 
STREET FRONT CORRIDOR.          

02:33:34.232 --> 02:33:34.963
NARROW THAT AND MAINTAIN A MORE 
STREET FRONT CORRIDOR.          
SO THAT&apos;S WHERE I FEEL LIKE     

02:33:34.965 --> 02:33:35.631
STREET FRONT CORRIDOR.          
SO THAT&apos;S WHERE I FEEL LIKE     
WE&apos;RE PUSHING AS WIDE AS        

02:33:35.633 --> 02:33:36.432
SO THAT&apos;S WHERE I FEEL LIKE     
WE&apos;RE PUSHING AS WIDE AS        
POSSIBLE TO GIVE US THE SPACE   

02:33:36.434 --> 02:33:37.132
WE&apos;RE PUSHING AS WIDE AS        
POSSIBLE TO GIVE US THE SPACE   
WHEN WE COULD BE STRATEGICALLY  

02:33:37.134 --> 02:33:37.867
POSSIBLE TO GIVE US THE SPACE   
WHEN WE COULD BE STRATEGICALLY  
THINKING IN A COMPACT WAY TO    

02:33:37.869 --> 02:33:38.600
WHEN WE COULD BE STRATEGICALLY  
THINKING IN A COMPACT WAY TO    
STILL GET SOME OF THOSE THINGS  

02:33:38.602 --> 02:33:39.334
THINKING IN A COMPACT WAY TO    
STILL GET SOME OF THOSE THINGS  
AND WE&apos;RE PUSHING THINGS RATHER 

02:33:39.336 --> 02:33:40.136
STILL GET SOME OF THOSE THINGS  
AND WE&apos;RE PUSHING THINGS RATHER 
THAN BEING NIMBLE AND FLEXIBLE. 

02:33:40.138 --> 02:33:40.736
AND WE&apos;RE PUSHING THINGS RATHER 
THAN BEING NIMBLE AND FLEXIBLE. 
SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE    

02:33:40.738 --> 02:33:41.837
THAN BEING NIMBLE AND FLEXIBLE. 
SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE    
WIDTH IN THAT REGARD DOOR       

02:33:41.839 --> 02:33:42.137
SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE    
WIDTH IN THAT REGARD DOOR       
SWINGS.                         

02:33:42.139 --> 02:33:44.873
WIDTH IN THAT REGARD DOOR       
SWINGS.                         
SO LET ME KIND OF GO THROUGH    

02:33:44.875 --> 02:33:45.474
SWINGS.                         
SO LET ME KIND OF GO THROUGH    
ALL OF MY CONCERNS.             

02:33:45.476 --> 02:33:48.877
SO LET ME KIND OF GO THROUGH    
ALL OF MY CONCERNS.             
YES, WE TO HAVE PETITIONERS DO  

02:33:48.879 --> 02:33:49.845
ALL OF MY CONCERNS.             
YES, WE TO HAVE PETITIONERS DO  
THE RIGHT THING IF WE GIVE THIS 

02:33:49.847 --> 02:33:50.512
YES, WE TO HAVE PETITIONERS DO  
THE RIGHT THING IF WE GIVE THIS 
RIGHT AWAY WE STILL HAVE TO     

02:33:50.514 --> 02:33:51.247
THE RIGHT THING IF WE GIVE THIS 
RIGHT AWAY WE STILL HAVE TO     
HAVE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING    

02:33:51.249 --> 02:33:54.316
RIGHT AWAY WE STILL HAVE TO     
HAVE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING    
WITHIN THAT SPACE THAT WE&apos;VE    

02:33:54.318 --> 02:33:55.117
HAVE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING    
WITHIN THAT SPACE THAT WE&apos;VE    
NOW REQUIRED THEM TO HOLD       

02:33:55.119 --> 02:33:57.553
WITHIN THAT SPACE THAT WE&apos;VE    
NOW REQUIRED THEM TO HOLD       
SETBACKS FOR THE WHOLE BUILDING 

02:33:57.555 --> 02:33:57.753
NOW REQUIRED THEM TO HOLD       
SETBACKS FOR THE WHOLE BUILDING 
PHASE.                          

02:33:57.755 --> 02:33:58.554
SETBACKS FOR THE WHOLE BUILDING 
PHASE.                          
SO EVEN IF WE HAD THEM PROCESS  

02:33:58.556 --> 02:34:01.356
PHASE.                          
SO EVEN IF WE HAD THEM PROCESS  
THE POTENTIAL I GUESS I CAN     

02:34:01.358 --> 02:34:02.091
SO EVEN IF WE HAD THEM PROCESS  
THE POTENTIAL I GUESS I CAN     
TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE    

02:34:02.093 --> 02:34:04.693
THE POTENTIAL I GUESS I CAN     
TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE    
NOW SOUTHTOWN THE GROUND FLOOR  

02:34:04.695 --> 02:34:05.361
TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE    
NOW SOUTHTOWN THE GROUND FLOOR  
RECESSES AND THEN THE UPPER     

02:34:05.363 --> 02:34:08.964
NOW SOUTHTOWN THE GROUND FLOOR  
RECESSES AND THEN THE UPPER     
FLOORS EXTEND OUT AND SO GIVES  

02:34:08.966 --> 02:34:09.865
RECESSES AND THEN THE UPPER     
FLOORS EXTEND OUT AND SO GIVES  
YOU A LOT MORE GROUND FLOOR WET 

02:34:09.867 --> 02:34:12.868
FLOORS EXTEND OUT AND SO GIVES  
YOU A LOT MORE GROUND FLOOR WET 
BUT IT ACTUALLY ENABLES SOME    

02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:13.535
YOU A LOT MORE GROUND FLOOR WET 
BUT IT ACTUALLY ENABLES SOME    
MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE ABOVE.      

02:34:13.537 --> 02:34:17.072
BUT IT ACTUALLY ENABLES SOME    
MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE ABOVE.      
BUT THAT OPPORTUNITY IS         

02:34:17.074 --> 02:34:19.975
MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE ABOVE.      
BUT THAT OPPORTUNITY IS         
ELIMINATED BY THIS SET BACK.    

02:34:19.977 --> 02:34:21.110
BUT THAT OPPORTUNITY IS         
ELIMINATED BY THIS SET BACK.    
THAT LINE GOES TO THIS GUY LIKE 

02:34:21.112 --> 02:34:24.780
ELIMINATED BY THIS SET BACK.    
THAT LINE GOES TO THIS GUY LIKE 
GOES TO THE ATMOSPHERE.         

02:34:24.782 --> 02:34:25.247
THAT LINE GOES TO THIS GUY LIKE 
GOES TO THE ATMOSPHERE.         
RIGHT.                          

02:34:25.249 --> 02:34:26.181
GOES TO THE ATMOSPHERE.         
RIGHT.                          
ONCE WE DRAW THAT LINE THERE IS 

02:34:26.183 --> 02:34:28.550
RIGHT.                          
ONCE WE DRAW THAT LINE THERE IS 
NO OPPORTUNITY TO STAGGER       

02:34:28.552 --> 02:34:29.184
ONCE WE DRAW THAT LINE THERE IS 
NO OPPORTUNITY TO STAGGER       
THINGS LIKE THAT.               

02:34:29.186 --> 02:34:32.654
NO OPPORTUNITY TO STAGGER       
THINGS LIKE THAT.               
BUT THE EXTENSION IS A SPECIFIC 

02:34:32.656 --> 02:34:33.555
THINGS LIKE THAT.               
BUT THE EXTENSION IS A SPECIFIC 
POINT THAT IS REVIEWED AND      

02:34:33.557 --> 02:34:37.025
BUT THE EXTENSION IS A SPECIFIC 
POINT THAT IS REVIEWED AND      
NEGOTIATED.                     

02:34:37.027 --> 02:34:37.726
POINT THAT IS REVIEWED AND      
NEGOTIATED.                     
WE&apos;RE TALKING WITH TRAFFIC      

02:34:37.728 --> 02:34:40.729
NEGOTIATED.                     
WE&apos;RE TALKING WITH TRAFFIC      
IMPACT STUDY ABOUT THAT AND     

02:34:40.731 --> 02:34:41.196
WE&apos;RE TALKING WITH TRAFFIC      
IMPACT STUDY ABOUT THAT AND     
TRAFFIC IMPACTS.                

02:34:41.198 --> 02:34:42.064
IMPACT STUDY ABOUT THAT AND     
TRAFFIC IMPACTS.                
SO YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE WEIGHT  

02:34:42.066 --> 02:34:44.800
TRAFFIC IMPACTS.                
SO YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE WEIGHT  
IN NOT JUST RECOMMENDATION&apos;S    

02:34:44.802 --> 02:34:45.534
SO YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE WEIGHT  
IN NOT JUST RECOMMENDATION&apos;S    
BUT REQUIREMENTS IN OUR FLIGHT  

02:34:45.536 --> 02:34:45.867
IN NOT JUST RECOMMENDATION&apos;S    
BUT REQUIREMENTS IN OUR FLIGHT  
PLAN.                           

02:34:45.869 --> 02:34:46.735
BUT REQUIREMENTS IN OUR FLIGHT  
PLAN.                           
SO I FEEL LIKE WE CAN TACKLE    

02:34:46.737 --> 02:34:51.573
PLAN.                           
SO I FEEL LIKE WE CAN TACKLE    
THAT WITHIN THAT REQUIREMENT    

02:34:51.575 --> 02:34:55.043
SO I FEEL LIKE WE CAN TACKLE    
THAT WITHIN THAT REQUIREMENT    
AND FRANKLY WE HAVE FIVE MAIN   

02:34:55.045 --> 02:34:56.044
THAT WITHIN THAT REQUIREMENT    
AND FRANKLY WE HAVE FIVE MAIN   
ROADS AND WE CAN DO STUFF.      

02:34:56.046 --> 02:35:00.281
AND FRANKLY WE HAVE FIVE MAIN   
ROADS AND WE CAN DO STUFF.      
WE CAN PUT CURBS, HAVE WATER    

02:35:00.283 --> 02:35:00.683
ROADS AND WE CAN DO STUFF.      
WE CAN PUT CURBS, HAVE WATER    
RUN UNDER THEM.                 

02:35:00.685 --> 02:35:01.416
WE CAN PUT CURBS, HAVE WATER

IT WOULD ALSO YES TO THE BACK   
OF THAT LINE THAT&apos;S NOT         

02:43:08.472 --> 02:43:11.472
IT WOULD ALSO YES TO THE BACK   
OF THAT LINE THAT&apos;S NOT         
RELEVANT BUT ALL I&apos;M GETTING IS 

02:43:11.474 --> 02:43:12.573
OF THAT LINE THAT&apos;S NOT         
RELEVANT BUT ALL I&apos;M GETTING IS 
THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH AND  

02:43:12.575 --> 02:43:13.274
RELEVANT BUT ALL I&apos;M GETTING IS 
THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH AND  
A LOT OF SUPPORT OUT THERE ON   

02:43:13.276 --> 02:43:14.409
THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH AND  
A LOT OF SUPPORT OUT THERE ON   
THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS TO      

02:43:14.411 --> 02:43:15.076
A LOT OF SUPPORT OUT THERE ON   
THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS TO      
MINIMUM SET BACKS.              

02:43:15.078 --> 02:43:18.380
THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS TO      
MINIMUM SET BACKS.              
THIS DOES FEEL LIKE JUST OVER   

02:43:18.382 --> 02:43:19.313
MINIMUM SET BACKS.              
THIS DOES FEEL LIKE JUST OVER   
ZONING AND I FEEL REALLY        

02:43:19.315 --> 02:43:20.582
THIS DOES FEEL LIKE JUST OVER   
ZONING AND I FEEL REALLY        
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS SO THAT&apos;S   

02:43:20.584 --> 02:43:25.086
ZONING AND I FEEL REALLY        
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS SO THAT&apos;S   
ALL SING FOR JUMPING AROUND     

02:43:25.088 --> 02:43:31.559
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS SO THAT&apos;S   
ALL SING FOR JUMPING AROUND     
THERE CONDITIONALS.             

02:43:31.561 --> 02:43:38.100
ALL SING FOR JUMPING AROUND     
THERE CONDITIONALS.             
I THINK THAT                    

02:43:52.348 --> 02:43:56.050
             THE MOVEMENT AND   
ALL OF THE RESEARCH THAT WAS    
JUST DISCUSSED ABOUT MOVING     

02:43:56.052 --> 02:43:56.984
ALL OF THE RESEARCH THAT WAS    
JUST DISCUSSED ABOUT MOVING     
THINGS CLOSER TO THE STREET AND 

02:43:56.986 --> 02:43:57.685
JUST DISCUSSED ABOUT MOVING     
THINGS CLOSER TO THE STREET AND 
HAVING MAKING FOR A GOOD        

02:43:57.687 --> 02:43:58.420
THINGS CLOSER TO THE STREET AND 
HAVING MAKING FOR A GOOD        
PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE IS REALLY 

02:43:58.422 --> 02:43:58.887
HAVING MAKING FOR A GOOD        
PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT.                      

02:43:58.889 --> 02:43:59.821
PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT.                      
UM, I THINK WHAT&apos;S CHALLENGING  

02:43:59.823 --> 02:44:00.555
IMPORTANT.                      
UM, I THINK WHAT&apos;S CHALLENGING  
IS THAT THOSE BUILD EVEN IN THE 

02:44:00.557 --> 02:44:03.891
UM, I THINK WHAT&apos;S CHALLENGING  
IS THAT THOSE BUILD EVEN IN THE 
ZERO BUILD TWO LINES ARE NOT    

02:44:03.893 --> 02:44:04.492
IS THAT THOSE BUILD EVEN IN THE 
ZERO BUILD TWO LINES ARE NOT    
CONSISTENT AND SO THE           

02:44:04.494 --> 02:44:06.961
ZERO BUILD TWO LINES ARE NOT    
CONSISTENT AND SO THE           
PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE WITH THE  

02:44:06.963 --> 02:44:07.929
CONSISTENT AND SO THE           
PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE WITH THE  
CURB JUST BECAUSE OF THIS LIKE  

02:44:07.931 --> 02:44:12.133
PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE WITH THE  
CURB JUST BECAUSE OF THIS LIKE  
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE THE    

02:44:12.135 --> 02:44:12.801
CURB JUST BECAUSE OF THIS LIKE  
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE THE    
FRONT FLAT LINE IS AND WHERE    

02:44:12.803 --> 02:44:14.836
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE THE    
FRONT FLAT LINE IS AND WHERE    
THE CURVE IS.                   

02:44:14.838 --> 02:44:15.770
FRONT FLAT LINE IS AND WHERE    
THE CURVE IS.                   
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT        

02:44:15.772 --> 02:44:16.537
THE CURVE IS.                   
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT        
EXPERIENCE THAT THAT&apos;S HOW I    

02:44:16.539 --> 02:44:19.173
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT        
EXPERIENCE THAT THAT&apos;S HOW I    
THINK PEDESTRIANS FEEL THE      

02:44:19.175 --> 02:44:19.841
EXPERIENCE THAT THAT&apos;S HOW I    
THINK PEDESTRIANS FEEL THE      
STREET THEY DON&apos;T KNOW LIKE     

02:44:19.843 --> 02:44:23.178
THINK PEDESTRIANS FEEL THE      
STREET THEY DON&apos;T KNOW LIKE     
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THE PROPERTY 

02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:23.779
STREET THEY DON&apos;T KNOW LIKE     
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THE PROPERTY 
LINE ACTUALLY IS.               

02:44:23.781 --> 02:44:27.215
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THE PROPERTY 
LINE ACTUALLY IS.               
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE IN A     

02:44:27.217 --> 02:44:27.882
LINE ACTUALLY IS.               
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE IN A     
POSITION WHERE WE CAN MOVE      

02:44:27.884 --> 02:44:30.351
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE IN A     
POSITION WHERE WE CAN MOVE      
ENTIRELY TOWARDS WE DON&apos;T KNOW  

02:44:30.353 --> 02:44:31.152
POSITION WHERE WE CAN MOVE      
ENTIRELY TOWARDS WE DON&apos;T KNOW  
I THINK WE HAVE HIGHER          

02:44:31.154 --> 02:44:37.793
ENTIRELY TOWARDS WE DON&apos;T KNOW  
I THINK WE HAVE HIGHER          
PRIORITIES THAN CHANGING ALL    

02:44:37.795 --> 02:44:38.893
I THINK WE HAVE HIGHER          
PRIORITIES THAN CHANGING ALL    
OF OUR FRONT SET BACKS TO BE    

02:44:38.895 --> 02:44:39.461
PRIORITIES THAN CHANGING ALL    
OF OUR FRONT SET BACKS TO BE    
MEASURED FROM THE CURB.         

02:44:39.463 --> 02:44:42.597
OF OUR FRONT SET BACKS TO BE    
MEASURED FROM THE CURB.         
BUT I I THINK THAT THAT         

02:44:42.599 --> 02:44:46.033
MEASURED FROM THE CURB.         
BUT I I THINK THAT THAT         
EXPERIENCE THAT REALLY TALKS    

02:44:46.035 --> 02:44:46.902
BUT I I THINK THAT THAT         
EXPERIENCE THAT REALLY TALKS    
ABOUT LIKE HOW CLOSE THINGS ARE 

02:44:46.904 --> 02:44:50.105
EXPERIENCE THAT REALLY TALKS    
ABOUT LIKE HOW CLOSE THINGS ARE 
AND BEING CONSISTENT WITH WHERE 

02:44:50.107 --> 02:44:51.039
ABOUT LIKE HOW CLOSE THINGS ARE 
AND BEING CONSISTENT WITH WHERE 
THE EDGE OF THAT ROAD IS, I     

02:44:51.041 --> 02:44:53.908
AND BEING CONSISTENT WITH WHERE 
THE EDGE OF THAT ROAD IS, I     
THINK THAT THAT MAKES MORE      

02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:54.576
THE EDGE OF THAT ROAD IS, I     
THINK THAT THAT MAKES MORE      
SENSE FROM A PLANNING           

02:44:54.578 --> 02:44:57.879
THINK THAT THAT MAKES MORE      
SENSE FROM A PLANNING           
PERSPECTIVE.                    

02:44:57.881 --> 02:44:58.613
SENSE FROM A PLANNING           
PERSPECTIVE.                    
I TOTALLY HEAR PEOPLE ARE

PERSPECTIVE.                    
I TOTALLY HEAR PEOPLE ARE       
SAYING AND I THINK I COULD SEE  

02:45:01.384 --> 02:45:05.253
I TOTALLY HEAR PEOPLE ARE       
SAYING AND I THINK I COULD SEE  
ARGUMENTS FOR LIKE MAYBE NOT    

02:45:05.255 --> 02:45:05.987
SAYING AND I THINK I COULD SEE  
ARGUMENTS FOR LIKE MAYBE NOT    
BEING TWENTY FEET LIKE WHERE    

02:45:05.989 --> 02:45:08.990
ARGUMENTS FOR LIKE MAYBE NOT    
BEING TWENTY FEET LIKE WHERE    
THERE ACTUALLY REALLY IS THIS   

02:45:08.992 --> 02:45:09.791
BEING TWENTY FEET LIKE WHERE    
THERE ACTUALLY REALLY IS THIS   
NARROW RIGHT OF EXISTING VERY   

02:45:09.793 --> 02:45:17.899
THERE ACTUALLY REALLY IS THIS   
NARROW RIGHT OF EXISTING VERY   
NARROW RIGHT OF WAY A           

02:45:18.768 --> 02:45:27.141
                      ALLOWING  
FOR THINGS TO FOR FOR SOME      
OF THOSE ZONES WHETHER IT&apos;S A

THOSE TO NARROW I THINK MAYBE   
LIKE BOTH 20 AND 40 COULD COME  

02:45:35.919 --> 02:45:38.987
THOSE TO NARROW I THINK MAYBE   
LIKE BOTH 20 AND 40 COULD COME  
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.              

02:45:38.989 --> 02:45:40.055
LIKE BOTH 20 AND 40 COULD COME  
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.              
I BUT I DON&apos;T NECESSARILY TAKE

THIS AS OVERREGULATION IN THIS  
SITUATION.                      
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

SITUATION.                      
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO DO IS NOT HAVE

I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO DO IS NOT HAVE  
EVERYTHING BE IN NEGOTIATION    

02:45:51.368 --> 02:45:52.100
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO DO IS NOT HAVE  
EVERYTHING BE IN NEGOTIATION    
WITH THE DEVELOPER, HAVE

EVERYTHING BE IN NEGOTIATION    
WITH THE DEVELOPER, HAVE        
SOMEBODY UNDERSTAND WHEN        

02:45:54.904 --> 02:45:55.670
WITH THE DEVELOPER, HAVE        
SOMEBODY UNDERSTAND WHEN        
THEY&apos;RE READING OUR ORDINANCE

SOMEBODY UNDERSTAND WHEN        
THEY&apos;RE READING OUR ORDINANCE   
WHAT THEY&apos;RE GOING TO LIKE,     

02:45:56.339 --> 02:45:58.206
THEY&apos;RE READING OUR ORDINANCE   
WHAT THEY&apos;RE GOING TO LIKE,     
WHAT RULES THEY&apos;RE BEING HELD   

02:45:58.208 --> 02:46:02.276
WHAT THEY&apos;RE GOING TO LIKE,     
WHAT RULES THEY&apos;RE BEING HELD   
TO RATHER THAN HAVE STAFF

WHAT RULES THEY&apos;RE BEING HELD   
TO RATHER THAN HAVE STAFF       
TRYING TO TWIST THEIR ARMS.     

02:46:02.945 --> 02:46:06.414
TO RATHER THAN HAVE STAFF       
TRYING TO TWIST THEIR ARMS.     
I&apos;M LIKE WELL THIS IS WHAT WE   

02:46:06.416 --> 02:46:07.115
TRYING TO TWIST THEIR ARMS.     
I&apos;M LIKE WELL THIS IS WHAT WE   
THINK PLANNING COMMISSION IS

I&apos;M LIKE WELL THIS IS WHAT WE   
THINK PLANNING COMMISSION IS    
GOING TO DO.

THINK PLANNING COMMISSION IS    
GOING TO DO.                    
I THINK THAT THAT THIS IS AN    

02:46:09.619 --> 02:46:13.121
GOING TO DO.                    
I THINK THAT THAT THIS IS AN    
AREA WHERE IN THOSE SITUATIONS  

02:46:13.123 --> 02:46:14.188
I THINK THAT THAT THIS IS AN    
AREA WHERE IN THOSE SITUATIONS  
WHERE IT REALLY IS A VERY, VERY 

02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:17.692
AREA WHERE IN THOSE SITUATIONS  
WHERE IT REALLY IS A VERY, VERY 
UM NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE     

02:46:17.694 --> 02:46:21.563
WHERE IT REALLY IS A VERY, VERY 
UM NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE     
CURB AND THE PROPERTY LINE, I   

02:46:21.565 --> 02:46:22.363
UM NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE     
CURB AND THE PROPERTY LINE, I   
THINK THAT THOSE ARE PLACES     

02:46:22.365 --> 02:46:25.600
CURB AND THE PROPERTY LINE, I   
THINK THAT THOSE ARE PLACES     
WHERE GIVEN OUR HOW WE&apos;RE       

02:46:25.602 --> 02:46:28.769
THINK THAT THOSE ARE PLACES     
WHERE GIVEN OUR HOW WE&apos;RE       
TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW I  

02:46:28.771 --> 02:46:29.537
WHERE GIVEN OUR HOW WE&apos;RE       
TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW I  
DON&apos;T KNOW IF I WERE STAFF HOW  

02:46:29.539 --> 02:46:32.273
TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW I  
DON&apos;T KNOW IF I WERE STAFF HOW  
I WOULD TALK TO A DEVELOPER,    

02:46:32.275 --> 02:46:33.007
DON&apos;T KNOW IF I WERE STAFF HOW  
I WOULD TALK TO A DEVELOPER,    
WHAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE    

02:46:33.009 --> 02:46:35.977
I WOULD TALK TO A DEVELOPER,    
WHAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE    
ACTUALLY GOING TO LOOK LIKE     

02:46:35.979 --> 02:46:36.878
WHAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE    
ACTUALLY GOING TO LOOK LIKE     
ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT YOU KNOW    

02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:40.714
ACTUALLY GOING TO LOOK LIKE     
ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT YOU KNOW    
ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT    

02:46:40.716 --> 02:46:41.383
ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT YOU KNOW    
ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT    
WHEN THEY GET THEIR PROJECT ALL 

02:46:41.385 --> 02:46:44.319
ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT    
WHEN THEY GET THEIR PROJECT ALL 
THE WAY TO PLANNING COMMISSION  

02:46:44.321 --> 02:46:47.288
WHEN THEY GET THEIR PROJECT ALL 
THE WAY TO PLANNING COMMISSION  
IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT THAT HOW  

02:46:47.290 --> 02:46:48.289
THE WAY TO PLANNING COMMISSION  
IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT THAT HOW  
WE&apos;RE GOING TO REACT AND I HOPE 

02:46:48.291 --> 02:46:51.025
IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT THAT HOW  
WE&apos;RE GOING TO REACT AND I HOPE 
THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH      

02:46:51.027 --> 02:46:52.027
WE&apos;RE GOING TO REACT AND I HOPE 
THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH      
SOMETHING NOW SO THAT WE COULD  

02:46:52.029 --> 02:46:52.694
THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH      
SOMETHING NOW SO THAT WE COULD  
TAKE SOME OF THAT GUESSWORK     

02:46:52.696 --> 02:46:55.129
SOMETHING NOW SO THAT WE COULD  
TAKE SOME OF THAT GUESSWORK     
AWAY FROM THEM.                 

02:46:55.131 --> 02:46:55.997
TAKE SOME OF THAT GUESSWORK     
AWAY FROM THEM.                 
SO I LIKE THIS APPROACH.        

02:46:55.999 --> 02:46:57.131
AWAY FROM THEM.                 
SO I LIKE THIS APPROACH.        
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE MIDDLE  

02:46:57.133 --> 02:46:59.600
SO I LIKE THIS APPROACH.        
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE MIDDLE  
GROUND APPROACH OF HAVING A     

02:46:59.602 --> 02:47:02.804
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE MIDDLE  
GROUND APPROACH OF HAVING A     
CURVE OF HAVING ACKNOWLEDGING   

02:47:02.806 --> 02:47:03.938
GROUND APPROACH OF HAVING A     
CURVE OF HAVING ACKNOWLEDGING   
THAT WE DO HAVE SUPERNATURAL I  

02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:14.548
CURVE OF HAVING ACKNOWLEDGING   
THAT WE DO HAVE SUPERNATURAL I  
THINK ON OK RIGHTS OF WAY OR    

02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:15.282
THAT WE DO HAVE SUPERNATURAL I  
THINK ON OK RIGHTS OF WAY OR    
KIND OF THAT SPACE AGAIN I      

02:47:15.284 --> 02:47:16.017
THINK ON OK RIGHTS OF WAY OR    
KIND OF THAT SPACE AGAIN I      
DON&apos;T KNOW IF THAT&apos;S THE RIGHT  

02:47:16.019 --> 02:47:18.820
KIND OF THAT SPACE AGAIN I      
DON&apos;T KNOW IF THAT&apos;S THE RIGHT  
ONE THAT I&apos;M CALLING IT BETWEEN 

02:47:18.822 --> 02:47:21.422
DON&apos;T KNOW IF THAT&apos;S THE RIGHT  
ONE THAT I&apos;M CALLING IT BETWEEN 
THE CURB AND THE FRONT FRONT    

02:47:21.424 --> 02:47:25.392
ONE THAT I&apos;M CALLING IT BETWEEN 
THE CURB AND THE FRONT FRONT    
LINE IN SOME PLACES AND THAT I  

02:47:25.394 --> 02:47:26.294
THE CURB AND THE FRONT FRONT    
LINE IN SOME PLACES AND THAT I  
THINK WE NEED TO SET THAT       

02:47:26.296 --> 02:47:27.028
LINE IN SOME PLACES AND THAT I  
THINK WE NEED TO SET THAT       
TRANSIT CORRIDOR MINIMUM TO BE  

02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:29.798
THINK WE NEED TO SET THAT       
TRANSIT CORRIDOR MINIMUM TO BE  
SOMETHING THAT LIKE WE THAT     

02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:30.465
TRANSIT CORRIDOR MINIMUM TO BE  
SOMETHING THAT LIKE WE THAT     
EVERYBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE     

02:47:30.467 --> 02:47:33.735
SOMETHING THAT LIKE WE THAT     
EVERYBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE     
WITH IS AT LEAST A MINIMUM THAT 

02:47:33.737 --> 02:47:36.971
EVERYBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE     
WITH IS AT LEAST A MINIMUM THAT 
WE CAN GO FOR BECAUSE THAT&apos;S I  

02:47:36.973 --> 02:47:37.772
WITH IS AT LEAST A MINIMUM THAT 
WE CAN GO FOR BECAUSE THAT&apos;S I  
LIKE THE IDEA ACTUALLY          

02:47:37.774 --> 02:47:38.640
WE CAN GO FOR BECAUSE THAT&apos;S I  
LIKE THE IDEA ACTUALLY          
OF HAVING THIS MAXIMUM HERE TOO 

02:47:38.642 --> 02:47:40.741
LIKE THE IDEA ACTUALLY          
OF HAVING THIS MAXIMUM HERE TOO 
BECAUSE WE HAVE LOT AS I THINK  

02:47:40.743 --> 02:47:41.509
OF HAVING THIS MAXIMUM HERE TOO 
BECAUSE WE HAVE LOT AS I THINK  
THE THE THE PRESENTATION POINT  

02:47:41.511 --> 02:47:44.845
BECAUSE WE HAVE LOT AS I THINK  
THE THE THE PRESENTATION POINT  
OUT WE HAVE LOTS OF AREAS WHERE 

02:47:44.847 --> 02:47:45.346
THE THE THE PRESENTATION POINT  
OUT WE HAVE LOTS OF AREAS WHERE 
IT&apos;S REALLY BIG.                

02:47:45.348 --> 02:47:46.180
OUT WE HAVE LOTS OF AREAS WHERE 
IT&apos;S REALLY BIG.                
IT&apos;S WAY BIGGER THAN WHAT WE    

02:47:46.182 --> 02:47:49.150
IT&apos;S REALLY BIG.                
IT&apos;S WAY BIGGER THAN WHAT WE    
WANT AND SO FORCING THEM TO NOT

CURRENTLY HAVE PLUS FIFTEEN I I 
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BUT I, I 

02:48:00.130 --> 02:48:01.129
CURRENTLY HAVE PLUS FIFTEEN I I 
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BUT I, I 
THINK IT IS ACTUALLY BETTER FOR

REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BUT I, I 
THINK IT IS ACTUALLY BETTER FOR 
THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AND   

02:48:01.864 --> 02:48:04.799
THINK IT IS ACTUALLY BETTER FOR 
THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AND   
NOT HINDERING DEVELOPMENT IF WE 

02:48:04.801 --> 02:48:05.433
THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AND   
NOT HINDERING DEVELOPMENT IF WE 
CAN AGREE NOW ON WHAT RULES

NOT HINDERING DEVELOPMENT IF WE 
CAN AGREE NOW ON WHAT RULES     
WE&apos;RE GOING TO HOLD EVERYBODY   

02:48:08.438 --> 02:48:09.237
CAN AGREE NOW ON WHAT RULES     
WE&apos;RE GOING TO HOLD EVERYBODY   
TO RATHER THAN THIS HAVING

BEING A ONE OFF NEGOTIATION AND 
PEOPLE ARE LIKE WELL WHAT&apos;S     
WHAT&apos;S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN IT  

02:48:13.977 --> 02:48:16.644
PEOPLE ARE LIKE WELL WHAT&apos;S     
WHAT&apos;S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN IT  
GETS TO PLANNING COMMISSION?    

02:48:16.646 --> 02:48:17.545
WHAT&apos;S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN IT  
GETS TO PLANNING COMMISSION?    
I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT BE VERY  

02:48:17.547 --> 02:48:20.548
GETS TO PLANNING COMMISSION?    
I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT BE VERY  
CLEAR IN OUR ORDINANCE.         

02:48:20.550 --> 02:48:25.186
I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT BE VERY  
CLEAR IN OUR ORDINANCE.         
SO AGAIN I&apos;M OPEN TO WHAT THOSE

SO AGAIN I&apos;M OPEN TO WHAT THOSE 
NUMBERS ARE BUT THAT I I THINK  
IT I&apos;M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH     

02:48:31.294 --> 02:48:32.260
NUMBERS ARE BUT THAT I I THINK  
IT I&apos;M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH     
PEOPLE HAVING WITH THE CURRENT  

02:48:32.262 --> 02:48:36.297
IT I&apos;M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH     
PEOPLE HAVING WITH THE CURRENT

MAIN.                           
IT&apos;S NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE AND  
I THINK THAT I I ALSO THINK     

02:48:44.574 --> 02:48:47.809
IT&apos;S NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE AND  
I THINK THAT I I ALSO THINK     
THAT THAT IS TRUE FOR PARTS     

02:48:47.811 --> 02:48:50.678
I THINK THAT I I ALSO THINK     
THAT THAT IS TRUE FOR PARTS     
OF UM FOR PARTS OF STADIUM AND  

02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:51.412
THAT THAT IS TRUE FOR PARTS     
OF UM FOR PARTS OF STADIUM AND  
WHILE THERE&apos;S LOTS OF THINGS    

02:48:51.414 --> 02:48:54.916
OF UM FOR PARTS OF STADIUM AND  
WHILE THERE&apos;S LOTS OF THINGS    
THAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO TO  

02:48:54.918 --> 02:48:59.353
WHILE THERE&apos;S LOTS OF THINGS    
THAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO TO  
SLOW TRAFFIC, I ALSO KNOW THAT  

02:48:59.355 --> 02:49:02.190
THAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO TO  
SLOW TRAFFIC, I ALSO KNOW THAT  
THOSE ARE THE EDGES OF THE CITY 

02:49:02.192 --> 02:49:03.357
SLOW TRAFFIC, I ALSO KNOW THAT  
THOSE ARE THE EDGES OF THE CITY 
LIKE THERE THERE WHERE WE HAVE  

02:49:03.359 --> 02:49:07.194
THOSE ARE THE EDGES OF THE CITY 
LIKE THERE THERE WHERE WE HAVE  
WE HAVE UM OUR OUR TRANSIT      

02:49:07.196 --> 02:49:10.899
LIKE THERE THERE WHERE WE HAVE  
WE HAVE UM OUR OUR TRANSIT      
RUNNING ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS IS  

02:49:10.901 --> 02:49:13.601
WE HAVE UM OUR OUR TRANSIT      
RUNNING ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS IS  
THESE THESE ARE OUR MATERIALS

SO I I FEEL LIKE I LIKE THAT    

02:49:18.408 --> 02:49:22.109
OR WHATEVER THE RIGHT ROAD IS.  
SO I I FEEL LIKE I LIKE THAT    
THIS IS A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD    

02:49:22.111 --> 02:49:22.877
SO I I FEEL LIKE I LIKE THAT    
THIS IS A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD    
SOLUTION NOW AND BUT I&apos;M I&apos;M    

02:49:22.879 --> 02:49:26.047
THIS IS A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD    
SOLUTION NOW AND BUT I&apos;M I&apos;M    
OPEN TO THINKING ABOUT WHETHER  

02:49:26.049 --> 02:49:32.854
SOLUTION NOW AND BUT I&apos;M I&apos;M    
OPEN TO THINKING ABOUT WHETHER  
20 AND 40 ARE THE RIGHT NUMBERS

COMMISSIONER.                   
I JUST I HAVE A QUESTION AND I  
DON&apos;T KNOW IF THERE&apos;S AN ANSWER 

02:49:41.565 --> 02:49:44.799
I JUST I HAVE A QUESTION AND I  
DON&apos;T KNOW IF THERE&apos;S AN ANSWER 
TO MY QUESTION BUT I&apos;M CURIOUS  

02:49:44.801 --> 02:49:48.536
DON&apos;T KNOW IF THERE&apos;S AN ANSWER 
TO MY QUESTION BUT I&apos;M CURIOUS  
AS TO ON WHAT KIND OF ROAD      

02:49:48.538 --> 02:49:49.336
TO MY QUESTION BUT I&apos;M CURIOUS  
AS TO ON WHAT KIND OF ROAD      
WOULD DRIVERS BE LIKELY TO      

02:49:49.338 --> 02:49:52.473
AS TO ON WHAT KIND OF ROAD      
WOULD DRIVERS BE LIKELY TO      
DRIVE FASTER AND WOULD IT BE A  

02:49:52.475 --> 02:49:53.141
WOULD DRIVERS BE LIKELY TO      
DRIVE FASTER AND WOULD IT BE A  
MULTI LANE ARTERIAL WHERE       

02:49:53.143 --> 02:49:55.844
DRIVE FASTER AND WOULD IT BE A  
MULTI LANE ARTERIAL WHERE       
BUILDINGS ARE BUILT UP TO THE   

02:49:55.846 --> 02:49:56.811
MULTI LANE ARTERIAL WHERE       
BUILDINGS ARE BUILT UP TO THE   
SIDEWALK OR A MULTI LANE        

02:49:56.813 --> 02:50:00.448
BUILDINGS ARE BUILT UP TO THE   
SIDEWALK OR A MULTI LANE        
ARTERIAL OR WHERE AN AMENITY    

02:50:00.450 --> 02:50:03.751

ARTERIAL OR WHERE AN AMENITY    
ZONE WITH MATURE TREES IN IT OR 
SOON TO BE MATURE TREES I DON&apos;T 

02:50:04.687 --> 02:50:05.353
ZONE WITH MATURE TREES IN IT OR 
SOON TO BE MATURE TREES I DON&apos;T 
KNOW SEPARATES THE SIDEWALK     

02:50:05.355 --> 02:50:11.826
SOON TO BE MATURE TREES I DON&apos;T 
KNOW SEPARATES THE SIDEWALK     
FROM THE MULTI LANE ARTERIAL.   

02:50:11.828 --> 02:50:12.827
KNOW SEPARATES THE SIDEWALK     
FROM THE MULTI LANE ARTERIAL.   
AS FAR AS A TECHNICAL ANSWER TO 

02:50:12.829 --> 02:50:15.563
FROM THE MULTI LANE ARTERIAL.   
AS FAR AS A TECHNICAL ANSWER TO 
THAT, I&apos;M SURE THAT THERE IS AN 

02:50:15.565 --> 02:50:16.231
AS FAR AS A TECHNICAL ANSWER TO 
THAT, I&apos;M SURE THAT THERE IS AN 
I.T. GUIDE SOMEWHERE THAT SAYS  

02:50:16.233 --> 02:50:19.033
THAT, I&apos;M SURE THAT THERE IS AN 
I.T. GUIDE SOMEWHERE THAT SAYS  
THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN          

02:50:19.035 --> 02:50:19.768
I.T. GUIDE SOMEWHERE THAT SAYS  
THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN          
PERCEIVED WIDTH THAT AFFECTS    

02:50:19.770 --> 02:50:23.037
THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN          
PERCEIVED WIDTH THAT AFFECTS    
TRAVEL SPEED IS SEARCH FOR      

02:50:23.039 --> 02:50:26.741
PERCEIVED WIDTH THAT AFFECTS    
TRAVEL SPEED IS SEARCH FOR      
BUILDINGS VERSUS YOU KNOW, X    

02:50:26.743 --> 02:50:27.142
TRAVEL SPEED IS SEARCH FOR      
BUILDINGS VERSUS YOU KNOW, X    
FOR TREES.                      

02:50:27.144 --> 02:50:30.878
BUILDINGS VERSUS YOU KNOW, X    
FOR TREES.                      
I JUST DO KNOW THAT TREES ARE   

02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:31.846
FOR TREES.                      
I JUST DO KNOW THAT TREES ARE   
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAN    

02:50:31.848 --> 02:50:35.149
I JUST DO KNOW THAT TREES ARE   
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAN    
REDUCE PERCEIVED WIDTH.         

02:50:35.151 --> 02:50:38.719
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAN    
REDUCE PERCEIVED WIDTH.         
SO IF YOU IMAGINE IF YOU FAN    

02:50:38.721 --> 02:50:40.055
REDUCE PERCEIVED WIDTH.         
SO IF YOU IMAGINE IF YOU FAN    
10, 15, 20 FEET WIDE OR OUT     

02:50:40.057 --> 02:50:46.027
SO IF YOU IMAGINE IF YOU FAN    
10, 15, 20 FEET WIDE OR OUT     
BEFORE                          

02:50:47.129 --> 02:50:54.168
       I MEAN I WOULD THINK     
THAT TREES WOULD PROVIDE THAT   
WALL IF THEY WERE AGAIN HEALTHY 

02:50:54.170 --> 02:51:00.475
THAT TREES WOULD PROVIDE THAT   
WALL IF THEY WERE AGAIN HEALTHY 
LARGE VARIETIES MATURE          

02:51:00.576 --> 02:51:10.117
                       SO I I   
AM IN SUPPORT OF THESE CHANGES  
BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE 

02:51:10.119 --> 02:51:15.957
AM IN SUPPORT OF THESE CHANGES  
BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO WAS CONCERNED UNCANCEL WITH 

02:51:15.959 --> 02:51:16.624
BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO WAS CONCERNED UNCANCEL WITH 
THE PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE       

02:51:16.626 --> 02:51:20.494
WHO WAS CONCERNED UNCANCEL WITH 
THE PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE       
OF WALKABILITY AND AGAIN, I&apos;M   

02:51:20.496 --> 02:51:23.764
THE PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE       
OF WALKABILITY AND AGAIN, I&apos;M   
NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND ARGUE 

02:51:23.766 --> 02:51:27.835
OF WALKABILITY AND AGAIN, I&apos;M   
NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND ARGUE 
FOR A LARGER MINIMUM THAN 20    

02:51:27.837 --> 02:51:32.306
NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND ARGUE 
FOR A LARGER MINIMUM THAN 20    
BUT I DID NOTICE THAT IF TREES  

02:51:32.308 --> 02:51:33.140
FOR A LARGER MINIMUM THAN 20    
BUT I DID NOTICE THAT IF TREES  
NEED EIGHT TO 10 FEET AND       

02:51:33.142 --> 02:51:39.180
BUT I DID NOTICE THAT IF TREES  
NEED EIGHT TO 10 FEET AND       
PEDESTRIANS NEED EIGHT FEET,    

02:51:39.182 --> 02:51:43.117
NEED EIGHT TO 10 FEET AND       
PEDESTRIANS NEED EIGHT FEET,    
THEN WE&apos;RE IF WE&apos;RE AT 20 WE&apos;RE 

02:51:43.119 --> 02:51:46.954
PEDESTRIANS NEED EIGHT FEET,    
THEN WE&apos;RE IF WE&apos;RE AT 20 WE&apos;RE 
REALLY NOT LEAVING ROOM FOR     

02:51:46.956 --> 02:51:47.955
THEN WE&apos;RE IF WE&apos;RE AT 20 WE&apos;RE 
REALLY NOT LEAVING ROOM FOR     
THAT LITTLE BIT OF SPACE THAT&apos;S 

02:51:47.957 --> 02:51:51.125
REALLY NOT LEAVING ROOM FOR     
THAT LITTLE BIT OF SPACE THAT&apos;S 
RIGHT UP AGAINST THE BUILDING.  

02:51:51.127 --> 02:51:54.828
THAT LITTLE BIT OF SPACE THAT&apos;S 
RIGHT UP AGAINST THE BUILDING.  
&gt;&gt; FOUR DOOR SWINGS AND         

02:51:54.830 --> 02:51:55.629
RIGHT UP AGAINST THE BUILDING.  
&gt;&gt; FOUR DOOR SWINGS AND         
WHATEVER THOSE THINGS ARE       

02:51:55.631 --> 02:51:56.330
&gt;&gt; FOUR DOOR SWINGS AND         
WHATEVER THOSE THINGS ARE       
CALLED WHERE THEY PUT THEIR     

02:51:56.332 --> 02:51:59.467
WHATEVER THOSE THINGS ARE       
CALLED WHERE THEY PUT THEIR     
MENU IN LIKE A FRONTAGE ZONE IS 

02:51:59.469 --> 02:52:00.234
CALLED WHERE THEY PUT THEIR     
MENU IN LIKE A FRONTAGE ZONE IS 
ONE WAY TO REFER TO IT.         

02:52:00.236 --> 02:52:03.036
MENU IN LIKE A FRONTAGE ZONE IS 
ONE WAY TO REFER TO IT.         
YEAH, SO YOU KNOW, I&apos;M NOT      

02:52:03.038 --> 02:52:03.771
ONE WAY TO REFER TO IT.         
YEAH, SO YOU KNOW, I&apos;M NOT      
GOING TO ARGUE FOR BIGGER THAN  

02:52:03.773 --> 02:52:06.774
YEAH, SO YOU KNOW, I&apos;M NOT      
GOING TO ARGUE FOR BIGGER THAN  
20 BUT I&apos;M SAYING THAT I THINK  

02:52:06.776 --> 02:52:07.508
GOING TO ARGUE FOR BIGGER THAN  
20 BUT I&apos;M SAYING THAT I THINK  
20 DOES SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE  

02:52:07.510 --> 02:52:09.977
20 BUT I&apos;M SAYING THAT I THINK  
20 DOES SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE  
MINIMUM TO ME.                  

02:52:09.979 --> 02:52:11.078
20 DOES SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE  
MINIMUM TO ME.                  
IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE ALL THE  

02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:11.813
MINIMUM TO ME.                  
IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE ALL THE  
THINGS YOU SHOWED US IN THE     

02:52:11.815 --> 02:52:14.615
IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE ALL THE  
THINGS YOU SHOWED US IN THE     
PORTLAND DESIGN, THE PORTLAND   

02:52:14.617 --> 02:52:15.349
THINGS YOU SHOWED US IN THE     
PORTLAND DESIGN, THE PORTLAND   
DESIGN ACTUALLY HAS TOO SMALL   

02:52:15.351 --> 02:52:18.285
PORTLAND DESIGN, THE PORTLAND   
DESIGN ACTUALLY HAS TOO SMALL   
OF AN IMMUNITY ZONE FOR TREES.  

02:52:18.287 --> 02:52:19.420
DESIGN ACTUALLY HAS TOO SMALL   
OF AN IMMUNITY ZONE FOR TREES.  
&gt;&gt; THE ONE IN THE STAFF REPORT  

02:52:19.422 --> 02:52:22.723
OF AN IMMUNITY ZONE FOR TREES.  
&gt;&gt; THE ONE IN THE STAFF REPORT  
I THINK WAS FROM EUGENE OR WAS  

02:52:22.725 --> 02:52:23.457

YOU&apos;RE YOU&apos;RE STARTING POSITION 
HERE IS THAT IF THE IF THE      
SETBACK IS ZERO OR FIFTEEN WE   

02:58:10.572 --> 02:58:11.638
HERE IS THAT IF THE IF THE      
SETBACK IS ZERO OR FIFTEEN WE   
HAVE TO WE HAVE TO PROVE IT IF

SETBACK IS ZERO OR FIFTEEN WE   
HAVE TO WE HAVE TO PROVE IT IF  
IT&apos;S ZERO WE HAVE TO PROVE IS

I DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT THE REST     

02:58:54.650 --> 02:58:56.851
SIDEWALK.                       
I DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT THE REST     
OF THAT BUILDING IN THE NARROW  

02:58:56.853 --> 02:58:57.651
I DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT THE REST     
OF THAT BUILDING IN THE NARROW  
SIDEWALK AT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE.  

02:58:57.653 --> 02:59:00.988
OF THAT BUILDING IN THE NARROW  
SIDEWALK AT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE.  
SO I THINK I JUST WANT TO I     

02:59:00.990 --> 02:59:01.655
SIDEWALK AT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE.  
SO I THINK I JUST WANT TO I     
THINK THAT&apos;S A LITTLE BIT       

02:59:01.657 --> 02:59:04.158
SO I THINK I JUST WANT TO I     
THINK THAT&apos;S A LITTLE BIT       
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE ANSWER  

02:59:04.160 --> 02:59:04.958
THINK THAT&apos;S A LITTLE BIT       
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE ANSWER  
STAFF IS GIVING YOU.            

02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:06.060
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE ANSWER  
STAFF IS GIVING YOU.            
BUT I THINK THAT IS STILL       

02:59:06.062 --> 02:59:08.896
STAFF IS GIVING YOU.            
BUT I THINK THAT IS STILL       
CONTRARY TO WHAT COUNCIL&apos;S      

02:59:08.898 --> 02:59:09.764
BUT I THINK THAT IS STILL       
CONTRARY TO WHAT COUNCIL&apos;S      
ASKED YOU TO DO IS TO SAY THAT  

02:59:09.766 --> 02:59:12.700
CONTRARY TO WHAT COUNCIL&apos;S      
ASKED YOU TO DO IS TO SAY THAT  
YES, THAT SOLVES THE DOOR SWING 

02:59:12.702 --> 02:59:13.668
ASKED YOU TO DO IS TO SAY THAT  
YES, THAT SOLVES THE DOOR SWING 
BUT IT DOESN&apos;T SOLVE A BUILDING 

02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:16.770
YES, THAT SOLVES THE DOOR SWING 
BUT IT DOESN&apos;T SOLVE A BUILDING 
THAT NARROWS THAT SIDEWALK      

02:59:16.772 --> 02:59:21.008
BUT IT DOESN&apos;T SOLVE A BUILDING 
THAT NARROWS THAT SIDEWALK      
BETWEEN FOUR TO FIVE, SIX OR    

02:59:21.010 --> 02:59:21.475
THAT NARROWS THAT SIDEWALK      
BETWEEN FOUR TO FIVE, SIX OR    
WHATEVER FEET.                  

02:59:21.477 --> 02:59:25.112
BETWEEN FOUR TO FIVE, SIX OR    
WHATEVER FEET.                  
AND SO I THINK THE ANSWER IS    

02:59:25.114 --> 02:59:25.846
WHATEVER FEET.                  
AND SO I THINK THE ANSWER IS    
YES, WE HAVE OTHER CODES THAT&apos;S 

02:59:25.848 --> 02:59:26.647
AND SO I THINK THE ANSWER IS    
YES, WE HAVE OTHER CODES THAT&apos;S 
GOING TO ADDRESS THAT NOT GREAT 

02:59:26.649 --> 02:59:27.982
YES, WE HAVE OTHER CODES THAT&apos;S 
GOING TO ADDRESS THAT NOT GREAT 
GUN SAFE SITUATIONS THAT STILL  

02:59:27.984 --> 02:59:31.852
GOING TO ADDRESS THAT NOT GREAT 
GUN SAFE SITUATIONS THAT STILL  
DOESN&apos;T SOLVE THE FACT THAT WE  

02:59:31.854 --> 02:59:35.288
GUN SAFE SITUATIONS THAT STILL  
DOESN&apos;T SOLVE THE FACT THAT WE  
CANNOT PUT A TREE IN A BUS STOP 

02:59:35.290 --> 02:59:35.956
DOESN&apos;T SOLVE THE FACT THAT WE  
CANNOT PUT A TREE IN A BUS STOP

BUT IT ALSO IT DOESN&apos;T SOLVE    
THAT.

BUT IT ALSO IT DOESN&apos;T SOLVE    
THAT.                           
WE STILL CAN&apos;T REQUIRE THAT WE

03:25:26.707 --> 03:25:27.440
WIDE SIDEWALKS, TREES.          
I THINK THE QUESTION ON THE     
TABLE IS WHETHER THE SPACE THAT 

03:25:27.442 --> 03:25:28.374
I THINK THE QUESTION ON THE     
TABLE IS WHETHER THE SPACE THAT 
WE ARE MAKING FOR THAT IN THE   

03:25:28.376 --> 03:25:29.108
TABLE IS WHETHER THE SPACE THAT 
WE ARE MAKING FOR THAT IN THE   
CITY OR IN THE CORRIDOR         

03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.709
WE ARE MAKING FOR THAT IN THE   
CITY OR IN THE CORRIDOR         
CORRIDORS VERY SPECIFICALLY     

03:25:29.711 --> 03:25:30.576
CITY OR IN THE CORRIDOR         
CORRIDORS VERY SPECIFICALLY     
SHOULD COME FROM THE STREETS OR 

03:25:30.578 --> 03:25:31.243
CORRIDORS VERY SPECIFICALLY     
SHOULD COME FROM THE STREETS OR 
SHOULD COME FROM PRIVATE WHAT   

03:25:31.245 --> 03:25:31.911
SHOULD COME FROM THE STREETS OR 
SHOULD COME FROM PRIVATE WHAT   
PRIVATE PRIVATELY OWNED         

03:25:31.913 --> 03:25:32.644
SHOULD COME FROM PRIVATE WHAT   
PRIVATE PRIVATELY OWNED         
PROPERTY THAT WE THEN NEED TO   

03:25:32.646 --> 03:25:32.912
PRIVATE PRIVATELY OWNED         
PROPERTY THAT WE THEN NEED TO   
ACQUIRE.                        

03:25:32.914 --> 03:25:33.579
PROPERTY THAT WE THEN NEED TO   
ACQUIRE.                        
THEY ARE BOTH ASPIRATIONAL.     

03:25:33.581 --> 03:25:34.379
ACQUIRE.                        
THEY ARE BOTH ASPIRATIONAL.     
THEY&apos;RE BOTH VERY EXPENSIVE.    

03:25:34.381 --> 03:25:38.351
THEY ARE BOTH ASPIRATIONAL.     
THEY&apos;RE BOTH VERY EXPENSIVE.    
THEY&apos;RE BOTH A LOT OF UNKNOWNS

IN THERE.                       
SO IN SOME WAYS IT&apos;S UH IT&apos;S A

03:59:53.439 --> 03:59:54.170
PROBLEM.                        
I THINK A LOT OF THIS LANGUAGE  
WAS ACTUALLY STRUCTURED AROUND  

03:59:54.172 --> 03:59:56.907
I THINK A LOT OF THIS LANGUAGE  
WAS ACTUALLY STRUCTURED AROUND  
THE ORIGINAL CREATION OF THE    

03:59:56.909 --> 03:59:57.441
WAS ACTUALLY STRUCTURED AROUND  
THE ORIGINAL CREATION OF THE    
PLANNING COMMISSION.            

03:59:57.443 --> 03:59:59.776
THE ORIGINAL CREATION OF THE

YOU&apos;LL NOTE, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE 

03:59:59.778 --> 04:00:00.710

YOU&apos;LL NOTE, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE 
WAS A LOT OF LANGUAGE ABOUT     

04:00:00.712 --> 04:00:01.278
YOU&apos;LL NOTE, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE 
WAS A LOT OF LANGUAGE ABOUT     
STAGGERED TERMS AND THE         

04:00:01.280 --> 04:00:03.614
WAS A LOT OF LANGUAGE ABOUT     
STAGGERED TERMS AND THE         
CREATION OF THOSE AND I WAS     

04:00:03.616 --> 04:00:04.281
STAGGERED TERMS AND THE         
CREATION OF THOSE AND I WAS     
PROPOSING ELIMINATING THOSE     

04:00:04.283 --> 04:00:05.149
CREATION OF THOSE AND I WAS     
PROPOSING ELIMINATING THOSE     
BECAUSE THE PLANNING COMMISSION 

04:00:05.151 --> 04:00:07.884
PROPOSING ELIMINATING THOSE     
BECAUSE THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
HAS BEEN CREATED AT THIS POINT  

04:00:07.886 --> 04:00:09.052
BECAUSE THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
HAS BEEN CREATED AT THIS POINT  
SO I CAN LOOK AT THAT TO SEE IF 

04:00:09.054 --> 04:00:11.855
HAS BEEN CREATED AT THIS POINT  
SO I CAN LOOK AT THAT TO SEE IF 
THERE NEEDS TO BE FLEXIBILITY.  

04:00:11.857 --> 04:00:12.655
SO I CAN LOOK AT THAT TO SEE IF 
THERE NEEDS TO BE FLEXIBILITY.

THAT SHOULD BE BROADENED.       
IT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT A BARRIER   

04:00:24.770 --> 04:00:27.303
