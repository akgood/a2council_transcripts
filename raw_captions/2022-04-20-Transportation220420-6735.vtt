WINTERTIME LIVES AND ESPECIALLY 

00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:51.915
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE&apos;S           
WINTERTIME LIVES AND ESPECIALLY 
SOME OF THE MORE VULNERABLE     

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:55.319
WINTERTIME LIVES AND ESPECIALLY 
SOME OF THE MORE VULNERABLE     
POPULATIONS AND SO IT&apos;S KIND    

00:20:55.321 --> 00:20:58.989
SOME OF THE MORE VULNERABLE     
POPULATIONS AND SO IT&apos;S KIND    
OF AN EQUITY ISSUE ALSO.        

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.357
POPULATIONS AND SO IT&apos;S KIND    
OF AN EQUITY ISSUE ALSO.        
&gt;&gt; SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN   

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:06.296
OF AN EQUITY ISSUE ALSO.        
&gt;&gt; SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN   
MY TOP THREE AND THEN I WOULD   

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.933
&gt;&gt; SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN   
MY TOP THREE AND THEN I WOULD   
ALSO RANK REMOVING PARKING      

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:13.137
MY TOP THREE AND THEN I WOULD   
ALSO RANK REMOVING PARKING      
MINIMUMS HIGH ON MY LIST.       

00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:14.271
ALSO RANK REMOVING PARKING      
MINIMUMS HIGH ON MY LIST.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:20.978
MINIMUMS HIGH ON MY LIST.

FROM MAINE TO FOURTH.           
SO TAKING A LITTLE BIT OUT      
OF ORDER WHAT I&apos;LL DO IS JUST   

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:38.812
SO TAKING A LITTLE BIT OUT      
OF ORDER WHAT I&apos;LL DO IS JUST   
QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT WHAT WENT     

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:42.816
OF ORDER WHAT I&apos;LL DO IS JUST   
QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT WHAT WENT     
INTO THAT.

QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT WHAT WENT     
INTO THAT.                      
THIS IS AN OVERVIEW SLIDE SO    

01:23:43.819 --> 01:23:44.551
INTO THAT.                      
THIS IS AN OVERVIEW SLIDE SO    
WE&apos;LL GO INTO THE MORE DETAILED

SLIDES.                         
SO FOR WASHINGTON STREETS FROM  
DENHA FLETCHER THE IDEA IS WE   

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:55.361
SO FOR WASHINGTON STREETS FROM  
DENHA FLETCHER THE IDEA IS WE   
SAW SOME CRASHES INVOLVING      

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:55.762
DENHA FLETCHER THE IDEA IS WE   
SAW SOME CRASHES INVOLVING      
PEDESTRIANS.                    

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:58.164
SAW SOME CRASHES INVOLVING      
PEDESTRIANS.                    
THERE WERE SOME HEAD LEFT TURN  

01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:58.998
PEDESTRIANS.                    
THERE WERE SOME HEAD LEFT TURN  
CRASHES AND JUST THE VOLUME     

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.702
THERE WERE SOME HEAD LEFT TURN  
CRASHES AND JUST THE VOLUME     
OF CRASHES KIND OF STOOD OUT    

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:02.836
CRASHES AND JUST THE VOLUME     
OF CRASHES KIND OF STOOD OUT    
AND SO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES   

01:24:02.838 --> 01:24:03.470
OF CRASHES KIND OF STOOD OUT    
AND SO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES   
ARE TO INCREASE VISIBILITY.     

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:05.806
AND SO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES   
ARE TO INCREASE VISIBILITY.     
PEDESTRIANS AND RIDERS REDUCED  

01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:06.607
ARE TO INCREASE VISIBILITY.     
PEDESTRIANS AND RIDERS REDUCED  
TURNING SPEEDS AND THAT&apos;LL BE   

01:24:06.609 --> 01:24:07.407
PEDESTRIANS AND RIDERS REDUCED  
TURNING SPEEDS AND THAT&apos;LL BE   
ACCOMPLISHED BY A SERIES        

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:10.210
TURNING SPEEDS AND THAT&apos;LL BE   
ACCOMPLISHED BY A SERIES        
OF BUMPASS WITH PAINT AND       

01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:10.944
ACCOMPLISHED BY A SERIES        
OF BUMPASS WITH PAINT AND       
HARDENED CENTERLINE HARDENED    

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:14.547
OF BUMPASS WITH PAINT AND       
HARDENED CENTERLINE HARDENED    
CENTER LINES ARE GOING TO BE A  

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:15.249
HARDENED CENTERLINE HARDENED    
CENTER LINES ARE GOING TO BE A  
FAIRLY NEW TREATMENT FOR US.    

01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:17.851
CENTER LINES ARE GOING TO BE A  
FAIRLY NEW TREATMENT FOR US.    
SO WE&apos;RE STILL KIND OF THINKING 

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:18.585
FAIRLY NEW TREATMENT FOR US.    
SO WE&apos;RE STILL KIND OF THINKING 
THROUGH WHAT THAT MIGHT EXACTLY 

01:24:18.587 --> 01:24:18.986
SO WE&apos;RE STILL KIND OF THINKING 
THROUGH WHAT THAT MIGHT EXACTLY 
ENTAIL.                         

01:24:18.988 --> 01:24:21.588
THROUGH WHAT THAT MIGHT EXACTLY 
ENTAIL.                         
SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR   

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:22.456
ENTAIL.                         
SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR   
WITH THE CONCEPT IN OTHER       

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:23.223
SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR   
WITH THE CONCEPT IN OTHER       
COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY THE     

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.159
WITH THE CONCEPT IN OTHER       
COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY THE     
IDEA IS TO REDUCE THE SPEED     

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:29.028
COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY THE     
IDEA IS TO REDUCE THE SPEED     
OF VEHICLES.                    

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:30.097
IDEA IS TO REDUCE THE SPEED     
OF VEHICLES.                    
THEY MAKE A TURN SO THAT THEY   

01:24:30.099 --> 01:24:30.897
OF VEHICLES.                    
THEY MAKE A TURN SO THAT THEY   
DON&apos;T KIND OF CUT THE CORNER    

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:33.266
THEY MAKE A TURN SO THAT THEY   
DON&apos;T KIND OF CUT THE CORNER    
AND TAKE THESE TURNS TO HIGH    

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:34.068
DON&apos;T KIND OF CUT THE CORNER    
AND TAKE THESE TURNS TO HIGH    
SPEED SO YOU YOU CAN PUT SOME   

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:36.937
AND TAKE THESE TURNS TO HIGH    
SPEED SO YOU YOU CAN PUT SOME   
SORT OF VERTICAL DEVICE THERE   

01:24:36.939 --> 01:24:37.738
SPEED SO YOU YOU CAN PUT SOME   
SORT OF VERTICAL DEVICE THERE   
ALONG THE DOUBLE YELLOW LINE OR 

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.874
SORT OF VERTICAL DEVICE THERE   
ALONG THE DOUBLE YELLOW LINE OR 
ON THE RECEIVING APPROACH TO    

01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:41.675
ALONG THE DOUBLE YELLOW LINE OR 
ON THE RECEIVING APPROACH TO    
MAKE SURE THAT KIND OF THAT     

01:24:41.677 --> 01:24:43.777
ON THE RECEIVING APPROACH TO    
MAKE SURE THAT KIND OF THAT     
VEHICLES TAKE THAT TURN A       

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:47.914
MAKE SURE THAT KIND OF THAT     
VEHICLES TAKE THAT TURN A       
LITTLE BIT MORE JUDICIOUSLY AND 

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:48.915
VEHICLES TAKE THAT TURN A       
LITTLE BIT MORE JUDICIOUSLY AND 
THEN JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT THIS 

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.453
LITTLE BIT MORE JUDICIOUSLY AND 
THEN JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT THIS 
WAS DATA DRIVEN, I WON&apos;T GO     

01:24:52.455 --> 01:24:53.420
THEN JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT THIS 
WAS DATA DRIVEN, I WON&apos;T GO     
INTO A LOT OF DETAILS ON A LOT  

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:53.954
WAS DATA DRIVEN, I WON&apos;T GO     
INTO A LOT OF DETAILS ON A LOT  
OF THIS STUFF.                  

01:24:53.956 --> 01:24:54.488
INTO A LOT OF DETAILS ON A LOT  
OF THIS STUFF.                  
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?              

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:56.055
OF THIS STUFF.                  
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?              
WE&apos;RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS IN 

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:56.890
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?              
WE&apos;RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS IN 
ON WHAT TYPES OF INJURIES       

01:24:56.892 --> 01:24:57.690
WE&apos;RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS IN 
ON WHAT TYPES OF INJURIES       
OCCURRED, WHAT WERE THE TYPE    

01:24:57.692 --> 01:25:00.660
ON WHAT TYPES OF INJURIES       
OCCURRED, WHAT WERE THE TYPE    
OF CRASH SITES TO MAKE SURE     

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:01.295
OCCURRED, WHAT WERE THE TYPE    
OF CRASH SITES TO MAKE SURE     
THAT THE COUNTERMEASURE THAT    

01:25:01.297 --> 01:25:03.763
OF CRASH SITES TO MAKE SURE     
THAT THE COUNTERMEASURE THAT    
WE&apos;RE PROPOSING IS ADEQUATE TO  

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:04.564
THAT THE COUNTERMEASURE THAT    
WE&apos;RE PROPOSING IS ADEQUATE TO  
HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE   

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:05.265
WE&apos;RE PROPOSING IS ADEQUATE TO  
HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE   
PROBLEMS THAT WE&apos;VE SEEN OUT    

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.133
HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE   
PROBLEMS THAT WE&apos;VE SEEN OUT    
THERE.                          

01:25:07.135 --> 01:25:11.772
PROBLEMS THAT WE&apos;VE SEEN OUT    
THERE.                          
SO NEXT I&apos;LL FOCUS ON PACARD    

01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:15.708
THERE.                          
SO NEXT I&apos;LL FOCUS ON PACARD    
FROM MAINE TO ST. SO THERE IS A 

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:19.112
SO NEXT I&apos;LL FOCUS ON PACARD    
FROM MAINE TO ST. SO THERE IS A 
MISSING SECTION OF BICYCLE LANE 

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.047
FROM MAINE TO ST. SO THERE IS A 
MISSING SECTION OF BICYCLE LANE 
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT OCCURRED, 

01:25:20.049 --> 01:25:20.680
MISSING SECTION OF BICYCLE LANE 
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT OCCURRED, 
I&apos;M SURE YOU&apos;VE EXPERIENCED     

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:23.617
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT OCCURRED, 
I&apos;M SURE YOU&apos;VE EXPERIENCED     
THIS THAT THE BIKE LANE KIND    

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:24.351
I&apos;M SURE YOU&apos;VE EXPERIENCED     
THIS THAT THE BIKE LANE KIND    
OF DROPS WHEN YOU GET TO STATE. 

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:27.454
THIS THAT THE BIKE LANE KIND    
OF DROPS WHEN YOU GET TO STATE. 
SO THE IDEA IS THAT THERE&apos;S     

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:28.222
OF DROPS WHEN YOU GET TO STATE. 
SO THE IDEA IS THAT THERE&apos;S     
ENOUGH ROOM OUT THERE FOR US TO 

01:25:28.224 --> 01:25:30.991
SO THE IDEA IS THAT THERE&apos;S     
ENOUGH ROOM OUT THERE FOR US TO 
BE ABLE TO PUT ONE IN.          

01:25:30.993 --> 01:25:33.927
ENOUGH ROOM OUT THERE FOR US TO 
BE ABLE TO PUT ONE IN.          
AND SO AGAIN LOOKING AT THE     

01:25:33.929 --> 01:25:34.895
BE ABLE TO PUT ONE IN.          
AND SO AGAIN LOOKING AT THE     
VOLUME OF CRASHES AND CRASHES   

01:25:34.897 --> 01:25:38.365
AND SO AGAIN LOOKING AT THE     
VOLUME OF CRASHES AND CRASHES   
INVOLVING CYCLISTS AND ONE      

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:39.366
VOLUME OF CRASHES AND CRASHES   
INVOLVING CYCLISTS AND ONE      
OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO 

01:25:39.368 --> 01:25:40.033
INVOLVING CYCLISTS AND ONE      
OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO 
REDUCE VEHICLE SPEED BY         

01:25:40.035 --> 01:25:42.036
OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO 
REDUCE VEHICLE SPEED BY         
NARROWING THOSE LANES AND       

01:25:42.038 --> 01:25:43.170
REDUCE VEHICLE SPEED BY         
NARROWING THOSE LANES AND       
PUTTING IN A HIGH COMFORT LIKE  

01:25:43.172 --> 01:25:45.305
NARROWING THOSE LANES AND       
PUTTING IN A HIGH COMFORT LIKE  
FACILITY.                       

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:46.440
PUTTING IN A HIGH COMFORT LIKE  
FACILITY.                       
&gt;&gt; AND SO THIS IS THE SORT      

01:25:46.442 --> 01:25:47.174
FACILITY.                       
&gt;&gt; AND SO THIS IS THE SORT      
OF TREATMENT WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT.  

01:25:47.176 --> 01:25:49.909
&gt;&gt; AND SO THIS IS THE SORT      
OF TREATMENT WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT.  
I MEAN THIS IS AN EXACT FORM    

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:53.947
OF TREATMENT WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT.  
I MEAN THIS IS AN EXACT FORM    
BUT SOME SORT OF PROTECTED      

01:25:53.949 --> 01:25:54.681
I MEAN THIS IS AN EXACT FORM    
BUT SOME SORT OF PROTECTED      
BICYCLE FACILITY WITH A         

01:25:54.683 --> 01:25:57.350

TO MAYBE TIGHTEN UP SOME OF THE 
TURNING RADII TO AGAIN SLOW     

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:06.460
TO MAYBE TIGHTEN UP SOME OF THE 
TURNING RADII TO AGAIN SLOW     
DOWN VEHICLES AS THEY MAKE

ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE         
ROADWAY, IT WOULD REQUIRE A     
SMALLER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IF   

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:26.106
ROADWAY, IT WOULD REQUIRE A     
SMALLER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IF   
WE WERE TO KEEP THE VERTICAL    

01:27:26.108 --> 01:27:26.707
SMALLER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IF   
WE WERE TO KEEP THE VERTICAL    
ELEMENTS IN YEAR ROUND.         

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:29.776
WE WERE TO KEEP THE VERTICAL    
ELEMENTS IN YEAR ROUND.         
SO AGAIN, THESE POSTS ARE GOING 

01:27:29.778 --> 01:27:30.443
ELEMENTS IN YEAR ROUND.         
SO AGAIN, THESE POSTS ARE GOING 
TO STAY IN YEAR ROUND.          

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:31.411
SO AGAIN, THESE POSTS ARE GOING 
TO STAY IN YEAR ROUND.          
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE   

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:32.512
TO STAY IN YEAR ROUND.          
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE   
EQUIPMENT CAN GET IN THERE TO   

01:27:32.514 --> 01:27:33.146
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE   
EQUIPMENT CAN GET IN THERE TO   
CLEAR THOSE PATHS.              

01:27:33.148 --> 01:27:36.716
EQUIPMENT CAN GET IN THERE TO   
CLEAR THOSE PATHS.              
SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A      

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:37.317
CLEAR THOSE PATHS.              
SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A      
SOLUTION AND WORKING WITH       

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:38.051
SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A      
SOLUTION AND WORKING WITH       
PUBLIC WORKS ON WHAT THAT PIECE 

01:27:38.053 --> 01:27:40.720
SOLUTION AND WORKING WITH       
PUBLIC WORKS ON WHAT THAT PIECE 
OF EQUIPMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE    

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:41.387
PUBLIC WORKS ON WHAT THAT PIECE 
OF EQUIPMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE    
AND WHAT&apos;S ON THE MARKET.       

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:44.424
OF EQUIPMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE    
AND WHAT&apos;S ON THE MARKET.       
AND WE ALSO ON A SIDE BAR THE   

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.627
AND WHAT&apos;S ON THE MARKET.       
AND WE ALSO ON A SIDE BAR THE   
CITY IS PURSUING A GREEN FLEET  

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:48.562
AND WE ALSO ON A SIDE BAR THE   
CITY IS PURSUING A GREEN FLEET  
APPROACH TO ALL OF OUR NEW      

01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:52.398
CITY IS PURSUING A GREEN FLEET  
APPROACH TO ALL OF OUR NEW      
VEHICLES SO NOT ONLY DO WE NEED 

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.066
APPROACH TO ALL OF OUR NEW      
VEHICLES SO NOT ONLY DO WE NEED 
THE RIGHT SIZE VEHICLE BUT WE   

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:55.668
VEHICLES SO NOT ONLY DO WE NEED 
THE RIGHT SIZE VEHICLE BUT WE   
NEED TO MAKE SURE IT&apos;S KIND     

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:56.402
THE RIGHT SIZE VEHICLE BUT WE   
NEED TO MAKE SURE IT&apos;S KIND     
OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AND    

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:56.937
NEED TO MAKE SURE IT&apos;S KIND     
OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AND    
IT&apos;S ELECTRIC AS WELL.          

01:27:56.939 --> 01:28:00.206
OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AND    
IT&apos;S ELECTRIC AS WELL.          
SO TRYING TO CHECK ALL THE      

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.007
IT&apos;S ELECTRIC AS WELL.          
SO TRYING TO CHECK ALL THE      
BOXES THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE  

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:02.776
SO TRYING TO CHECK ALL THE      
BOXES THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE  
THAT THIS WORKS.                

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:06.712
BOXES THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE  
THAT THIS WORKS.                
SO AGAIN, THE STRATEGY WOULD D  

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:07.513
THAT THIS WORKS.                
SO AGAIN, THE STRATEGY WOULD D  
VEHICLE SPEEDS AND INCREASE     

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:10.550
SO AGAIN, THE STRATEGY WOULD D  
VEHICLE SPEEDS AND INCREASE     
COMFORT FOR CYCLISTS.           

01:28:10.552 --> 01:28:13.820
VEHICLE SPEEDS AND INCREASE     
COMFORT FOR CYCLISTS.           
GLENN FULLER.                   

01:28:13.822 --> 01:28:17.590
COMFORT FOR CYCLISTS.           
GLENN FULLER.                   
WE&apos;RE SEEING SOME CRASHES AND   

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:18.225
GLENN FULLER.                   
WE&apos;RE SEEING SOME CRASHES AND   
INVOLVING CYCLISTS AND THEN     

01:28:18.227 --> 01:28:19.025
WE&apos;RE SEEING SOME CRASHES AND   
INVOLVING CYCLISTS AND THEN     
THERE&apos;S ALSO SOME CRASHES       

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:22.495
INVOLVING CYCLISTS AND THEN     
THERE&apos;S ALSO SOME CRASHES       
INVOLVING VEHICLES ESPECIALLY   

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:25.666
THERE&apos;S ALSO SOME CRASHES       
INVOLVING VEHICLES ESPECIALLY   
LEFT TURNING VEHICLES.          

01:28:25.668 --> 01:28:26.866
INVOLVING VEHICLES ESPECIALLY   
LEFT TURNING VEHICLES.          
AND SO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES   

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:27.700
LEFT TURNING VEHICLES.          
AND SO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES   
HERE TO REDUCE SPEED IS KIND    

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:30.336
AND SO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES   
HERE TO REDUCE SPEED IS KIND    
OF AROUND THIS BEND, ESPECIALLY 

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:31.170
HERE TO REDUCE SPEED IS KIND    
OF AROUND THIS BEND, ESPECIALLY 
AROUND THE VEHICLES THAT ARE    

01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:34.207
OF AROUND THIS BEND, ESPECIALLY 
AROUND THE VEHICLES THAT ARE    
TURNING ONTO FULLER AND         

01:28:34.209 --> 01:28:34.708
AROUND THE VEHICLES THAT ARE    
TURNING ONTO FULLER AND         
INCREASED VISIBILITY            

01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:36.977
TURNING ONTO FULLER AND         
INCREASED VISIBILITY            
OF CYCLISTS.                    

01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:37.911
INCREASED VISIBILITY            
OF CYCLISTS.                    
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME PAVEMENT  

01:28:37.913 --> 01:28:38.378
OF CYCLISTS.                    
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME PAVEMENT  
MARKINGS.                       

01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.580
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME PAVEMENT  
MARKINGS.                       
SO FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE THE    

01:28:40.582 --> 01:28:41.414
MARKINGS.                       
SO FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE THE    
GREEN PIGMENT SHARED LANE       

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:45.018
SO FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE THE    
GREEN PIGMENT SHARED LANE       
MARKINGS THROUGH THE            

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:45.819
GREEN PIGMENT SHARED LANE       
MARKINGS THROUGH THE            
INTERSECTION, MAYBE SOME HARD   

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:48.621
MARKINGS THROUGH THE            
INTERSECTION, MAYBE SOME HARD   
AND CENTER LINE TO REDUCE THE   

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:52.091
INTERSECTION, MAYBE SOME HARD   
AND CENTER LINE TO REDUCE THE   
SPEED OF VEHICLES AND THEN A    

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:52.959
AND CENTER LINE TO REDUCE THE   
SPEED OF VEHICLES AND THEN A    
HARD AND CENTER LINE WITH A     

01:28:52.961 --> 01:28:54.694
SPEED OF VEHICLES AND THEN A    
HARD AND CENTER LINE WITH A     
PAINT AND POST MEDIAN AND ALSO  

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:58.732
HARD AND CENTER LINE WITH A     
PAINT AND POST MEDIAN AND ALSO  
REDUCE THAT TURNING RADIUS      

01:28:58.734 --> 01:29:02.769
PAINT AND POST MEDIAN AND ALSO  
REDUCE THAT TURNING RADIUS      
AGAIN YOU CAN KIND OF SEE SOME  

01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:03.836
REDUCE THAT TURNING RADIUS      
AGAIN YOU CAN KIND OF SEE SOME  
OF THE DATA THAT WENT INTO      

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:07.306
AGAIN YOU CAN KIND OF SEE SOME  
OF THE DATA THAT WENT INTO      
THOSE CONSIDERATION YOU AND     

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:07.974
OF THE DATA THAT WENT INTO      
THOSE CONSIDERATION YOU AND     
STATE IS ANOTHER LOCATION.      

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:11.311
THOSE CONSIDERATION YOU AND     
STATE IS ANOTHER LOCATION.      
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A          

01:29:11.313 --> 01:29:11.778
STATE IS ANOTHER LOCATION.      
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A          
SURPRISE.                       

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:12.478
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A          
SURPRISE.                       
IT&apos;S JUST A VERY HIGH VOLUME    

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.015
SURPRISE.                       
IT&apos;S JUST A VERY HIGH VOLUME    
INTERSECTION ESPECIALLY IN A    

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:15.681
IT&apos;S JUST A VERY HIGH VOLUME    
INTERSECTION ESPECIALLY IN A    
LOT OF PEDESTRIANS AND          

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:16.015
INTERSECTION ESPECIALLY IN A    
LOT OF PEDESTRIANS AND          
CYCLISTS.

LOT OF PEDESTRIANS AND          
CYCLISTS.                       
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE 

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:20.153
CYCLISTS.                       
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE 
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO?          

01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:23.056
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE 
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO?          
THIS IS AND ALWAYS TOP

SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO  
TO SIMPLIFY THE INTERSECTION    

01:29:27.129 --> 01:29:27.961
SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO  
TO SIMPLIFY THE INTERSECTION    
AND PRIORITIZE THE PEDESTRIAN   

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:31.098
TO SIMPLIFY THE INTERSECTION    
AND PRIORITIZE THE PEDESTRIAN   
AND BICYCLE TRAVEL SO SOME

&gt;&gt; SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT   
WE&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT IS AGAIN   
SOME GREEN PIGMENTATION FOR THE 

01:30:43.472 --> 01:30:44.270
WE&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT IS AGAIN   
SOME GREEN PIGMENTATION FOR THE 
BIKE LANE GETTING THROUGH THE

CERTAIN INTERSECTION APPROACHES 
AND THIS INTERSECTION ONLY HAS  
I THINK HALF OF THE PEDESTRIAN  

01:31:00.389 --> 01:31:03.890
AND THIS INTERSECTION ONLY HAS  
I THINK HALF OF THE PEDESTRIAN  
SIGNALS WHAT WE CALL PETMEDS    

01:31:03.892 --> 01:31:07.160
I THINK HALF OF THE PEDESTRIAN  
SIGNALS WHAT WE CALL PETMEDS    
HAVE THE COUNTDOWN FEATURE SO   

01:31:07.162 --> 01:31:08.127
SIGNALS WHAT WE CALL PETMEDS    
HAVE THE COUNTDOWN FEATURE SO   
MAKING SURE THAT THE ENTIRE

HAVE THE COUNTDOWN FEATURE SO   
MAKING SURE THAT THE ENTIRE

INTERSECTION HAS THOSE          
COUNTDOWN PATTERN.              
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.                   

01:31:15.204 --> 01:31:18.338
COUNTDOWN PATTERN.              
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.                   
ON AND STREET SOME CRASHES      

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.072
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.                   
ON AND STREET SOME CRASHES      
INVOLVING PEDESTRIANS AND       

01:31:19.074 --> 01:31:19.673
ON AND STREET SOME CRASHES      
INVOLVING PEDESTRIANS AND       
CYCLISTS AND AGAIN THE VOLUME   

01:31:19.675 --> 01:31:22.242
INVOLVING PEDESTRIANS AND       
CYCLISTS AND AGAIN THE VOLUME   
OF CRASHES IS WHAT KIND         

01:31:22.244 --> 01:31:22.843
CYCLISTS AND AGAIN THE VOLUME   
OF CRASHES IS WHAT KIND         
OF DOUBT AT US.                 

01:31:22.845 --> 01:31:23.776
OF CRASHES IS WHAT KIND         
OF DOUBT AT US.                 
SO THE THINGS THAT WE&apos;RE TRYING 

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:30.384
OF DOUBT AT US.                 
SO THE THINGS THAT WE&apos;RE TRYING 
TO DO IS REDUCE THAT EXPOSURE   

01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:46.199
OF PEDESTRIANS AND INCREASE     
VISIBILITY OF CYCLISTS.         
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE&apos;RE   

01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:46.799
VISIBILITY OF CYCLISTS.         
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE&apos;RE   
TALKING ABOUT DOING PAINT       

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:47.466
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE&apos;RE   
TALKING ABOUT DOING PAINT       
POSTBANK BELTS AND MARKETING    

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:48.201
TALKING ABOUT DOING PAINT       
POSTBANK BELTS AND MARKETING    
THE BIKE LANE WITH THAT GREEN   

01:31:48.203 --> 01:31:48.667
POSTBANK BELTS AND MARKETING    
THE BIKE LANE WITH THAT GREEN   
PIGMENTATION.                   

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:49.336
THE BIKE LANE WITH THAT GREEN   
PIGMENTATION.                   
&gt;&gt; I THINK I&apos;VE USED THE TERM   

01:31:49.338 --> 01:31:50.203
PIGMENTATION.                   
&gt;&gt; I THINK I&apos;VE USED THE TERM   
PAINT POST BUT JUST TO CLARIFY  

01:31:50.205 --> 01:31:50.670
&gt;&gt; I THINK I&apos;VE USED THE TERM   
PAINT POST BUT JUST TO CLARIFY  
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT.            

01:31:50.672 --> 01:31:51.604
PAINT POST BUT JUST TO CLARIFY  
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT.            
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE LOOK AT A 

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:52.238
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT.            
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE LOOK AT A 
BUMP OUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING A   

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:52.906
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE LOOK AT A 
BUMP OUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING A   
CONCRETE EXTENSION HERE, THE    

01:31:52.908 --> 01:31:53.740
BUMP OUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING A   
CONCRETE EXTENSION HERE, THE    
PAVEMENT WOULD JUST BE PAINTED  

01:31:53.742 --> 01:31:54.407
CONCRETE EXTENSION HERE, THE    
PAVEMENT WOULD JUST BE PAINTED  
A CERTAIN COLOR THAT WOULD      

01:31:54.409 --> 01:31:55.074
PAVEMENT WOULD JUST BE PAINTED  
A CERTAIN COLOR THAT WOULD      
DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE       

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:55.675
A CERTAIN COLOR THAT WOULD      
DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE       
TRAVELING AND THEN YOU WOULD    

01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:58.111
DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE       
TRAVELING AND THEN YOU WOULD    
HAVE THE VERTICAL ELEMENTS LIKE 

01:31:58.113 --> 01:31:58.911
TRAVELING AND THEN YOU WOULD    
HAVE THE VERTICAL ELEMENTS LIKE 
DELINEATOR BOLLARDS THAT WOULD  

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:02.215
HAVE THE VERTICAL ELEMENTS LIKE 
DELINEATOR BOLLARDS THAT WOULD  
KIND TO BE STUCK IN THE ROAD    

01:32:02.217 --> 01:32:03.015
DELINEATOR BOLLARDS THAT WOULD  
KIND TO BE STUCK IN THE ROAD    
THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE VEHICLES  

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:05.618
KIND TO BE STUCK IN THE ROAD    
THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE VEHICLES  
FROM KIND OF ENCROACHING ON     

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.018
THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE VEHICLES  
FROM KIND OF ENCROACHING ON     
THAT SPACE.                     

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.220
FROM KIND OF ENCROACHING ON     
THAT SPACE.                     
SO IT CREATES A SORT OF VIRTUAL 

01:32:07.222 --> 01:32:09.556
THAT SPACE.                     
SO IT CREATES A SORT OF VIRTUAL 
BUMP WITHOUT CONCRETE           

01:32:09.558 --> 01:32:12.658
SO IT CREATES A SORT OF VIRTUAL 
BUMP WITHOUT CONCRETE           
NECESSARILY.                    

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.460
BUMP WITHOUT CONCRETE           
NECESSARILY.                    
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.                   

01:32:13.462 --> 01:32:17.563
NECESSARILY.                    
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.                   
AND SO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE  

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:20.466
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.                   
AND SO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE  
ARE WORKING WITH THE CONSULTANT
