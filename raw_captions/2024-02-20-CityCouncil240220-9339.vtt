CONFLICTING AND SO THEY DON&apos;T   

01:24:48.972 --> 01:24:51.640
THE SAME DISTRICT ARE NOT       
CONFLICTING AND SO THEY DON&apos;T   
NEED TO BE BUFFERED CURRENTLY   

01:24:51.642 --> 01:24:54.676
CONFLICTING AND SO THEY DON&apos;T   
NEED TO BE BUFFERED CURRENTLY   
WE REQUIRE THAT THEY BE BUFFORD

01:24:58.381 --> 01:25:03.284
DIFFERENT LAND USES WITHIN THE  
SAME DISTRICT WHICH IS ODD SO   
IT WILL NO LONGER BE NECESSARY  

01:25:03.286 --> 01:25:06.320
