00:41:28.294 --> 00:41:28.926
NOT USUALLY ATTEND CITIZEN      
PARTICIPATION MEETINGS.         
THEY OFTEN CONFLICT WITH

THEY OFTEN CONFLICT WITH

00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:35.733
THEY OFTEN CONFLICT WITH        
PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS OR 
OTHER CITY MEETINGS AND I DON&apos;T 

00:41:35.735 --> 00:41:36.533
PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS OR 
OTHER CITY MEETINGS AND I DON&apos;T 
THINK THAT IT WOULD BE          

00:41:36.535 --> 00:41:37.201
OTHER CITY MEETINGS AND I DON&apos;T 
THINK THAT IT WOULD BE          
REASONABLE TO EXPECT EVERY      

00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:39.770
THINK THAT IT WOULD BE          
REASONABLE TO EXPECT EVERY      
MEMBER OF PLANNING COMMISSION   

00:41:39.772 --> 00:41:40.304
REASONABLE TO EXPECT EVERY      
MEMBER OF PLANNING COMMISSION   
TO ATTEND THOSE.                

00:41:40.306 --> 00:41:43.974
MEMBER OF PLANNING COMMISSION   
TO ATTEND THOSE.                
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK WE MIGHT NEED A  

00:41:43.976 --> 00:41:47.511
TO ATTEND THOSE.                
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK WE MIGHT NEED A  
CULTURE SHIFT AROUND HAVING THE 

00:41:47.513 --> 00:41:51.549
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK WE MIGHT NEED A  
CULTURE SHIFT AROUND HAVING THE 
WARD REPS ATTEND THOSE AND      

00:41:51.551 --> 00:41:52.416
CULTURE SHIFT AROUND HAVING THE 
WARD REPS ATTEND THOSE AND      
MAYBE AS YOU KNOW, SOME         

00:41:52.418 --> 00:41:54.885
WARD REPS ATTEND THOSE AND      
MAYBE AS YOU KNOW, SOME         
PLANNING COMMISSIONERS AND THAT 

00:41:54.887 --> 00:41:55.719
MAYBE AS YOU KNOW, SOME         
PLANNING COMMISSIONERS AND THAT 
WOULD REALLY MEAN THAT THE      

00:41:55.721 --> 00:41:56.353
PLANNING COMMISSIONERS AND THAT 
WOULD REALLY MEAN THAT THE      
DEVELOPERS WOULD NEED TO        

00:41:56.355 --> 00:41:58.989
WOULD REALLY MEAN THAT THE      
DEVELOPERS WOULD NEED TO        
COORDINATE BECAUSE MANY OF US   

00:41:58.991 --> 00:41:59.657
DEVELOPERS WOULD NEED TO        
COORDINATE BECAUSE MANY OF US   
JUST DON&apos;T HAVE VERY MUCH       

00:41:59.659 --> 00:42:00.525
COORDINATE BECAUSE MANY OF US   
JUST DON&apos;T HAVE VERY MUCH       
FLEXIBILITY IN OUR EVENINGS AND 

00:42:00.527 --> 00:42:03.427
JUST DON&apos;T HAVE VERY MUCH       
FLEXIBILITY IN OUR EVENINGS AND 
WE NEED MORE LEAD TIME IF WE    

00:42:03.429 --> 00:42:04.195
FLEXIBILITY IN OUR EVENINGS AND 
WE NEED MORE LEAD TIME IF WE    
SHOULD, YOU KNOW, KEEP THAT ONE 

00:42:04.197 --> 00:42:06.864
WE NEED MORE LEAD TIME IF WE    
SHOULD, YOU KNOW, KEEP THAT ONE 
OR TWO NIGHTS OPEN.             

00:42:06.866 --> 00:42:08.065
SHOULD, YOU KNOW, KEEP THAT ONE 
OR TWO NIGHTS OPEN.             
&gt;&gt; THE ONE OR TWO NIGHTS THAT   

00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:10.968
