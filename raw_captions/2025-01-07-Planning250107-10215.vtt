AND HOW CAN WE BEST COORDINATE  
SO THAT WE ARE EFFICIENT IN THE

RAW WATER ALIGNMENT STUDY THAT  
IS HAPPENING CURRENTLY THAT     

00:25:59.488 --> 00:26:01.822
RAW WATER ALIGNMENT STUDY THAT  
IS HAPPENING CURRENTLY THAT     
WILL BETTER INFORM WHAT THE

BUT WE ARE ANTICIPATING TO NEED 

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.226
WATER MAIN NEEDS ARE.           
BUT WE ARE ANTICIPATING TO NEED 
A WATER MAIN PROJECT IN THAT    

00:26:06.228 --> 00:26:06.427
BUT WE ARE ANTICIPATING TO NEED 
A WATER MAIN PROJECT IN THAT    
AREA.                           

00:26:06.429 --> 00:26:07.260
A WATER MAIN PROJECT IN THAT    
AREA.                           
WE ALREADY KNOW WE NEED A       

00:26:07.262 --> 00:26:09.663
AREA.                           
WE ALREADY KNOW WE NEED A       
STREET RESURFACING PROJECT AND  

00:26:09.665 --> 00:26:10.563
WE ALREADY KNOW WE NEED A       
STREET RESURFACING PROJECT AND  
THEN WE KNOW THAT WHILE WE TRY  

00:26:10.565 --> 00:26:13.734
STREET RESURFACING PROJECT AND  
THEN WE KNOW THAT WHILE WE TRY  
TO STAFF HAD INITIATED A        

00:26:13.736 --> 00:26:14.534
THEN WE KNOW THAT WHILE WE TRY  
TO STAFF HAD INITIATED A        
SIDEWALK PROJECT A NUMBER       

00:26:14.536 --> 00:26:18.004
TO STAFF HAD INITIATED A        
SIDEWALK PROJECT A NUMBER       
OF YEARS AGO WE WERE ASKED TO   

00:26:18.006 --> 00:26:18.705
SIDEWALK PROJECT A NUMBER       
OF YEARS AGO WE WERE ASKED TO   
LOOK MORE HOLISTICALLY AT       

00:26:18.707 --> 00:26:20.373
OF YEARS AGO WE WERE ASKED TO   
LOOK MORE HOLISTICALLY AT       
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS     

00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:21.241
LOOK MORE HOLISTICALLY AT       
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS     
BROADLY AND WE DON'T KNOW       

00:26:21.243 --> 00:26:21.842
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS     
BROADLY AND WE DON'T KNOW       
WHETHER THAT MIGHT INCLUDE      

00:26:21.844 --> 00:26:25.578
BROADLY AND WE DON'T KNOW       
WHETHER THAT MIGHT INCLUDE      
MOVING COLOURBLIND OR OTHER     

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.313
WHETHER THAT MIGHT INCLUDE      
MOVING COLOURBLIND OR OTHER     
IMPACTS THAT ARE MORE RESOURCE  

00:26:26.315 --> 00:26:28.882
MOVING COLOURBLIND OR OTHER     
IMPACTS THAT ARE MORE RESOURCE  
INTENSE AND IMPACTFUL TO THE

IMPACTS THAT ARE MORE RESOURCE  
INTENSE AND IMPACTFUL TO THE    
PAVEMENT IN THAT AREA.          

00:26:29.551 --> 00:26:32.486
INTENSE AND IMPACTFUL TO THE

00:26:32.488 --> 00:26:33.287
PAVEMENT IN THAT AREA.          
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE TO         
HOPEFULLY SOLIDIFY THIS CONCEPT 

00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:36.790
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE TO         
HOPEFULLY SOLIDIFY THIS CONCEPT 
OF HOW COMPETING PRIORITIES,    

00:26:36.792 --> 00:26:40.660
HOPEFULLY SOLIDIFY THIS CONCEPT 
OF HOW COMPETING PRIORITIES,    
HOW PROJECT COORDINATION CAN

OF HOW COMPETING PRIORITIES,    
HOW PROJECT COORDINATION CAN    
COME INTO PLAY AND CAUSE A      

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.963
HOW PROJECT COORDINATION CAN

ORDER.                          
WESTING WHICH MIGHT SHOW ONE

WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS THAT THERE 
ARE OTHER PROJECTS IN THE PLAN

IN REGARD TO HOW THIS VIP IS    
PUT TOGETHER LOOKING            
HOLISTICALLY AT THE MILLION

SO IF WE WERE IF THIS SIDEWALK  

01:15:48.574 --> 01:15:49.306
SIDEWALK PROJECTS.              
SO IF WE WERE IF THIS SIDEWALK  
PROJECT WERE TO BE BROUGHT      

01:15:49.308 --> 01:15:52.676
SO IF WE WERE IF THIS SIDEWALK  
PROJECT WERE TO BE BROUGHT      
BACK, IT HAD BEEN ELIMINATED IN

01:15:56.282 --> 01:15:57.214
TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

THAT WOULD DISPLACE FUNDING FOR

THAT WOULD DISPLACE FUNDING FOR 
SOME OTHER PROJECTS.            

01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:01.619
THAT WOULD DISPLACE FUNDING FOR 
SOME OTHER PROJECTS.            
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I

BECAUSE SOMETIMES THERE'S       
REQUESTS FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT

OF TIES TAGS I EMPHASIZE THIS

THIS DOES NOT ALLOCATE DOLLARS

THIS DOES NOT ALLOCATE DOLLARS  
NAMING IT AS THE PROJECT

OF THE REASON I DON'T WANT TO   
MAKE A MOTION TO MODIFY THE     

01:16:25.478 --> 01:16:27.545
OF THE REASON I DON'T WANT TO   
MAKE A MOTION TO MODIFY THE     
PLAN AGAIN IS BECAUSE IT'S      

01:16:27.547 --> 01:16:28.345
MAKE A MOTION TO MODIFY THE     
PLAN AGAIN IS BECAUSE IT'S      
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE YOU MAY COME  

01:16:28.347 --> 01:16:31.982
PLAN AGAIN IS BECAUSE IT'S      
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE YOU MAY COME  
BACK AND SAY WE LOOKED AT IT AS 

01:16:31.984 --> 01:16:32.716
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE YOU MAY COME  
BACK AND SAY WE LOOKED AT IT AS 
A STANDALONE PROJECT AND FOR    

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:35.919
BACK AND SAY WE LOOKED AT IT AS 
A STANDALONE PROJECT AND FOR    
THESE THREE REASONS IT IS NOT   

01:16:35.921 --> 01:16:36.587
A STANDALONE PROJECT AND FOR    
THESE THREE REASONS IT IS NOT   
HIGHER PRIORITY THAN ANYTHING   

01:16:36.589 --> 01:16:37.321
THESE THREE REASONS IT IS NOT   
HIGHER PRIORITY THAN ANYTHING   
IN THE QUEUE FOR TWO THOUSAND   

01:16:37.323 --> 01:16:39.222
HIGHER PRIORITY THAN ANYTHING   
IN THE QUEUE FOR TWO THOUSAND   
TWENTY SIX THROUGH TWENTY       

01:16:39.224 --> 01:16:39.623
IN THE QUEUE FOR TWO THOUSAND   
TWENTY SIX THROUGH TWENTY       
TWENTY NINE.                    

01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:42.493
TWENTY SIX THROUGH TWENTY       
TWENTY NINE.                    
SO THEREFORE IT'S HERE AND THAT 

01:16:42.495 --> 01:16:43.094
TWENTY NINE.                    
SO THEREFORE IT'S HERE AND THAT 
WOULD BE FINE.                  

01:16:43.096 --> 01:16:43.894
SO THEREFORE IT'S HERE AND THAT 
WOULD BE FINE.                  
THE REASON I'M SKEPTICAL THAT   

01:16:43.896 --> 01:16:46.630
WOULD BE FINE.                  
THE REASON I'M SKEPTICAL THAT   
THAT'S TRUE IS THAT I BELIEVE   

01:16:46.632 --> 01:16:47.497
THE REASON I'M SKEPTICAL THAT   
THAT'S TRUE IS THAT I BELIEVE   
THAT STAFF HAD GOOD REASONS FOR 

01:16:47.499 --> 01:16:48.432
THAT'S TRUE IS THAT I BELIEVE   
THAT STAFF HAD GOOD REASONS FOR 
PUTTING IT AT THE FRONT OF THE  

01:16:48.434 --> 01:16:54.905
THAT STAFF HAD GOOD REASONS FOR 
PUTTING IT AT THE FRONT OF THE  
LINE AND I DON'T BELIEVE        

01:17:07.985 --> 01:17:10.087
ANYTHING HAS CHANGED.           
>> SO I TEND TO THINK THAT THE  
DECISION THAT WAS MADE          

01:17:10.089 --> 01:17:10.821
>> SO I TEND TO THINK THAT THE  
DECISION THAT WAS MADE

DECISION THAT WAS MADE          
ADMINISTRATIVELY IN SEPTEMBER   
OF TWENTY ONE I THINK           

01:17:11.423 --> 01:17:12.088
ADMINISTRATIVELY IN SEPTEMBER   
OF TWENTY ONE I THINK           
IMPLICITLY ASSUMED THAT WE      

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:12.823
OF TWENTY ONE I THINK           
IMPLICITLY ASSUMED THAT WE      
WOULD FIND A WAY TO GET FUNDING

IMPLICITLY ASSUMED THAT WE      
WOULD FIND A WAY TO GET FUNDING 
TO DO A BROADER RECONFIGURATION 

01:17:13.626 --> 01:17:14.225
WOULD FIND A WAY TO GET FUNDING 
TO DO A BROADER RECONFIGURATION 
AT SOME REASONABLE TIMELINE.

COLLAPSED I THINK AND IS NO     
LONGER THE CASE.                
THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT DRAFT 

01:17:16.763 --> 01:17:17.561
LONGER THE CASE.                
THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT DRAFT 
IN FRONT OF US TONIGHT HAS THIS

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:18.929
IN FRONT OF US TONIGHT HAS THIS 
PROJECT OUT BEYOND TWENTY       
THIRTY ONE TELLS ME THAT IT'S   

01:17:18.931 --> 01:17:19.730

THIRTY ONE TELLS ME THAT IT'S   
NOT GOING TO BE BUILT ON ANY

THIRTY ONE TELLS ME THAT IT'S   
NOT GOING TO BE BUILT ON ANY

DISCUSSION ABOUT WIDENING THE   
EAST MEDICAL CENTER BRIDGE.     

01:45:53.110 --> 01:45:54.242
DISCUSSION ABOUT WIDENING THE   
EAST MEDICAL CENTER BRIDGE.     
THE IDEA THAT THERE WOULD BE AN 

01:45:54.244 --> 01:46:00.348
EAST MEDICAL CENTER BRIDGE.     
THE IDEA THAT THERE WOULD BE AN 
ALTERNATIVE UNDERNEATH AND THAT 

01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:01.450
THE IDEA THAT THERE WOULD BE AN 
ALTERNATIVE UNDERNEATH AND THAT 
THE CITY SHOULD MOVE THAT UP OR 

01:46:01.452 --> 01:46:04.920
ALTERNATIVE UNDERNEATH AND THAT 
THE CITY SHOULD MOVE THAT UP OR 
REALLY AS YOU KNOW,             

01:46:04.922 --> 01:46:05.720
THE CITY SHOULD MOVE THAT UP OR 
REALLY AS YOU KNOW,             
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE HAD MADE  

01:46:05.722 --> 01:46:08.590
REALLY AS YOU KNOW,             
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE HAD MADE  
A SITUATION WORSE BY THIS       

01:46:08.592 --> 01:46:09.324
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE HAD MADE  
A SITUATION WORSE BY THIS       
DECISION THAT WE MADE ABOUT     

01:46:09.326 --> 01:46:11.626
A SITUATION WORSE BY THIS       
DECISION THAT WE MADE ABOUT     
WIDENING THE BRIDGE AND WE      

01:46:11.628 --> 01:46:12.261
DECISION THAT WE MADE ABOUT     
WIDENING THE BRIDGE AND WE      
SHOULD AMELIORATE A SITUATION   

01:46:12.263 --> 01:46:16.731
WIDENING THE BRIDGE AND WE      
SHOULD AMELIORATE A SITUATION   
THAT OUR DECISION MADE WORSE.   

01:46:16.733 --> 01:46:17.766
SHOULD AMELIORATE A SITUATION   
THAT OUR DECISION MADE WORSE.   
SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING    

01:46:17.768 --> 01:46:21.236
THAT OUR DECISION MADE WORSE.   
SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING    
THAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE SOME YOU

01:46:28.612 --> 01:46:32.014
QUESTION WHETHER IF HERE ON     
WATERLOO RAISE SOME MONEY,      
WOULD THAT CHANGE THE CITY'S    

01:46:32.016 --> 01:46:35.717
WATERLOO RAISE SOME MONEY,      
WOULD THAT CHANGE THE CITY'S    
THINKING ABOUT THIS?            

01:46:35.719 --> 01:46:36.785
WOULD THAT CHANGE THE CITY'S    
THINKING ABOUT THIS?            
IS IT A TECHNICAL PROBLEM?      

01:46:36.787 --> 01:46:37.519
THINKING ABOUT THIS?            
IS IT A TECHNICAL PROBLEM?      
IS THIS WAY MORE COMPLICATED    

01:46:37.521 --> 01:46:40.155
IS IT A TECHNICAL PROBLEM?      
IS THIS WAY MORE COMPLICATED    
AND WAY MORE EXPENSIVE THOUGHT  

01:46:40.157 --> 01:46:43.459
IS THIS WAY MORE COMPLICATED    
AND WAY MORE EXPENSIVE THOUGHT  
AND ALSO WHAT IS THAT BECAUSE I 

01:46:43.461 --> 01:46:44.260
AND WAY MORE EXPENSIVE THOUGHT  
AND ALSO WHAT IS THAT BECAUSE I 
DO THINK THAT THERE'S SUPPOSED  

01:46:44.262 --> 01:46:46.695
AND ALSO WHAT IS THAT BECAUSE I 
DO THINK THAT THERE'S SUPPOSED  
TO BE BICYCLE WORK ON THE       

01:46:46.697 --> 01:46:47.496
DO THINK THAT THERE'S SUPPOSED  
TO BE BICYCLE WORK ON THE       
ACTUAL STREET ON THE ROADWAYS   

01:46:47.498 --> 01:46:51.600
TO BE BICYCLE WORK ON THE       
ACTUAL STREET ON THE ROADWAYS   
NOT NECESSARILY.                

01:46:51.602 --> 01:46:52.635
ACTUAL STREET ON THE ROADWAYS   
NOT NECESSARILY.                
I MEAN THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE   

01:46:52.637 --> 01:46:54.670
NOT NECESSARILY.                
I MEAN THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE   
WAYS IN WHICH BIKE TRAFFIC      

01:46:54.672 --> 01:46:55.471
I MEAN THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE   
WAYS IN WHICH BIKE TRAFFIC      
COULD BE AMELIORATED THERE.     

01:46:55.473 --> 01:46:56.205
WAYS IN WHICH BIKE TRAFFIC      
COULD BE AMELIORATED THERE.     
AND I I MY UNDERSTANDING IS     

01:46:56.207 --> 01:46:58.874
COULD BE AMELIORATED THERE.     
AND I I MY UNDERSTANDING IS     
THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE   

01:46:58.876 --> 01:46:59.674
AND I I MY UNDERSTANDING IS     
THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE   
SOMETHING ON THE SURFACE ROADS  

01:46:59.676 --> 01:46:59.942
THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE   
SOMETHING ON THE SURFACE ROADS  
AS WELL.                        

01:46:59.944 --> 01:47:03.279
SOMETHING ON THE SURFACE ROADS  
AS WELL.                        
SO I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW A    

01:47:03.281 --> 01:47:03.946
AS WELL.                        
SO I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW A    
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS      

01:47:03.948 --> 01:47:06.915
SO I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW A

BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT WE DO     

01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:32.827
AMENABLE TO A COMMISSION.       
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT WE DO     
UPDATE THIS PLAN EVERY YEAR.    

01:59:32.829 --> 01:59:34.095
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT WE DO

REASONS FOR WHY THESE TWO       

02:06:21.905 --> 02:06:22.636
TO ME LIKE THEY'RE PRETTY VALID 
REASONS FOR WHY THESE TWO       
THINGS ARE POPPING UP ON THE    

02:06:22.638 --> 02:06:23.771
REASONS FOR WHY THESE TWO       
THINGS ARE POPPING UP ON THE    
TABLE AND RAISING QUESTIONS.

02:06:28.043 --> 02:06:28.676
AND IF I HEARD COMMISSIONER     
MILLS CORRECTLY, IT WAS IN THE  
TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO WORRY

MILLS CORRECTLY, IT WAS IN THE  
TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO WORRY

02:06:29.278 --> 02:06:31.812
TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO WORRY    
ABOUT THE UNDERPASS.

02:06:35.918 --> 02:06:36.851
APPROVING IT WITH THE REQUEST   
THAT IN NEXT YEAR WE REVISIT    
THAT AND PULL IT UP AND THINK   

02:06:36.853 --> 02:06:39.753
THAT IN NEXT YEAR WE REVISIT    
THAT AND PULL IT UP AND THINK   
ABOUT IT MORE CAREFULLY BECAUSE 

02:06:39.755 --> 02:06:40.588
THAT AND PULL IT UP AND THINK   
ABOUT IT MORE CAREFULLY BECAUSE 
I THINK IT'S BEEN UNDER SOMEHOW 

02:06:40.590 --> 02:06:43.657
ABOUT IT MORE CAREFULLY BECAUSE

EIGHT FOOT ON THE PLAN.         
SO I WOULD ASSUME IT'S GOING TO 

02:40:50.805 --> 02:40:51.470
EIGHT FOOT ON THE PLAN.         
SO I WOULD ASSUME IT'S GOING TO 
BE AN BUT NO PROBLEM.           

02:40:51.472 --> 02:40:54.006
SO I WOULD ASSUME IT'S GOING TO 
BE AN BUT NO PROBLEM.           
SO AN EIGHT FOOT PRIVACY THAT   

02:40:54.008 --> 02:40:54.873
BE AN BUT NO PROBLEM.           
SO AN EIGHT FOOT PRIVACY THAT   
GOES ALONG THAT THE WESTERN     

02:40:54.875 --> 02:40:57.509
SO AN EIGHT FOOT PRIVACY THAT   
GOES ALONG THAT THE WESTERN     
PROPERTY LINE AGAIN AND ALSO    

02:40:57.511 --> 02:41:01.914
GOES ALONG THAT THE WESTERN     
PROPERTY LINE AGAIN AND ALSO    
ANOTHER KEY ASPECT OF THIS      

02:41:01.916 --> 02:41:02.848
PROPERTY LINE AGAIN AND ALSO    
ANOTHER KEY ASPECT OF THIS      
PROJECT IS THE THE PARKING BUT  

02:41:02.850 --> 02:41:04.984
ANOTHER KEY ASPECT OF THIS      
PROJECT IS THE THE PARKING BUT  
THE MAJORITY OBVIOUSLY THE VAST 

02:41:04.986 --> 02:41:05.918
PROJECT IS THE THE PARKING BUT  
THE MAJORITY OBVIOUSLY THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF THIS PARKING IS IN  

02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:09.021
THE MAJORITY OBVIOUSLY THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF THIS PARKING IS IN  
A STRUCTURE WELL IN A IN        

02:41:09.023 --> 02:41:09.889
MAJORITY OF THIS PARKING IS IN  
A STRUCTURE WELL IN A IN        
GARAGES ATTACHED THERE IS A     

02:41:09.891 --> 02:41:10.622
A STRUCTURE WELL IN A IN        
GARAGES ATTACHED THERE IS A     
LITTLE BIT OF SURFACE PARKING   

02:41:10.624 --> 02:41:15.760
GARAGES ATTACHED THERE IS A     
LITTLE BIT OF SURFACE PARKING   
BUT IT IS RELATIVELY MINIMAL    

02:41:15.762 --> 02:41:16.928
LITTLE BIT OF SURFACE PARKING   
BUT IT IS RELATIVELY MINIMAL    
AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE    

02:41:16.930 --> 02:41:18.830
BUT IT IS RELATIVELY MINIMAL    
AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE    
MAIN SITE PLANNED ASPECTS       

02:41:18.832 --> 02:41:19.865
AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE

I DO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT     
THERE WILL BE A GOAT TRAIL FROM 

03:16:33.044 --> 03:16:36.747
I DO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT     
THERE WILL BE A GOAT TRAIL FROM 
WHERE THE SIDEWALK JUTS UP TO   

03:16:36.749 --> 03:16:37.547
THERE WILL BE A GOAT TRAIL FROM 
WHERE THE SIDEWALK JUTS UP TO   
THE SIDEWALK BECAUSE NO ONE'S   

03:16:37.549 --> 03:16:39.482
WHERE THE SIDEWALK JUTS UP TO   
THE SIDEWALK BECAUSE NO ONE'S   
GOING TO GO UP AND THEN TURN    

03:16:39.484 --> 03:16:40.316
THE SIDEWALK BECAUSE NO ONE'S   
GOING TO GO UP AND THEN TURN    
LEFT AND THEN RIGHT.            

03:16:40.318 --> 03:16:44.254
GOING TO GO UP AND THEN TURN    
LEFT AND THEN RIGHT.            
SO MAYBE IF IT IS CITY OWNED    

03:16:44.256 --> 03:16:45.055
LEFT AND THEN RIGHT.            
SO MAYBE IF IT IS CITY OWNED    
LAND OR SOMETHING WE CAN MAKE   

03:16:45.057 --> 03:16:47.925
SO MAYBE IF IT IS CITY OWNED    
LAND OR SOMETHING WE CAN MAKE   
IT MORE HOUSE MORE HOSPITABLE.  

03:16:47.927 --> 03:16:48.525
LAND OR SOMETHING WE CAN MAKE   
IT MORE HOUSE MORE HOSPITABLE.  
THAT'S TRUE.                    

03:16:48.527 --> 03:16:49.459
IT MORE HOUSE MORE HOSPITABLE.  
THAT'S TRUE.

I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GRAY   
THERE WHICH IS WHY WE DID THAT  
WHY YOU'RE SO PROBABLY RIGHT    

03:16:53.232 --> 03:16:56.165

COMMUNITY IS NOT MINABLE TO     

03:17:03.842 --> 03:17:07.310
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE AUDUBON   
COMMUNITY IS NOT MINABLE TO     
THIS BUT I IMAGINE FAMILIES     

03:17:07.312 --> 03:17:10.914
COMMUNITY IS NOT MINABLE TO     
THIS BUT I IMAGINE FAMILIES     
WILL MOVE IN AND THOSE KIDS     

03:17:10.916 --> 03:17:11.982
THIS BUT I IMAGINE FAMILIES

DO BELIEVE NOT THE DOWNTOWN     

03:17:15.086 --> 03:17:15.718

DO BELIEVE NOT THE DOWNTOWN     
SCHOOL BECAUSE I THINK IT       

03:17:15.720 --> 03:17:19.088
DO BELIEVE NOT THE DOWNTOWN     
SCHOOL BECAUSE I THINK IT       
CROSSES THE STREET IS CORRECT.  

03:17:19.090 --> 03:17:20.090
SCHOOL BECAUSE I THINK IT       
CROSSES THE STREET IS CORRECT.  
I DON'T I SHOULD KNOW THAT I    

03:17:20.092 --> 03:17:20.757
CROSSES THE STREET IS CORRECT.  
I DON'T I SHOULD KNOW THAT I

03:17:20.759 --> 03:17:23.026
I DON'T I SHOULD KNOW THAT I    
USUALLY KNOW THAT LATER.        
OK, SO I'M SORRY.               

03:17:23.028 --> 03:17:23.560
USUALLY KNOW THAT LATER.        
OK, SO I'M SORRY.               
>> YEAH.

SO THAT MEANS THEY'RE GOING TO  
WALK I KNOW AUDOBON RESIDENTS   

03:17:26.231 --> 03:17:27.030
SO THAT MEANS THEY'RE GOING TO  
WALK I KNOW AUDOBON RESIDENTS

03:17:27.032 --> 03:17:30.333
WALK I KNOW AUDOBON RESIDENTS   
ARE ZONED FOR LOT AND SO I      
CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE DISTRICT 

03:17:30.335 --> 03:17:33.870
ARE ZONED FOR LOT AND SO I      
CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE DISTRICT 
WOULD MAKE THAT ADJACENT GROUP  

03:17:33.872 --> 03:17:34.203
CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE DISTRICT 
WOULD MAKE THAT ADJACENT GROUP  
THERE.                          

03:17:34.205 --> 03:17:35.005
WOULD MAKE THAT ADJACENT GROUP  
THERE.                          
SO THAT'S OUR NEIGHBORHOOD      

03:17:35.007 --> 03:17:38.208
THERE.                          
SO THAT'S OUR NEIGHBORHOOD      
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND CURRENTLY 

03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.875
SO THAT'S OUR NEIGHBORHOOD      
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND CURRENTLY

03:17:46.351 --> 03:17:46.984
THROUGH THE BACKYARDS OF OTHER  
NEIGHBORS TO INTO THE           
NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE IT IS A    

03:17:46.986 --> 03:17:49.419

THAT KIDS COULD MOVE FREELY     
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD,       

03:18:24.255 --> 03:18:25.088
THAT KIDS COULD MOVE FREELY     
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD,       
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY   

03:18:25.090 --> 03:18:29.058
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD,       
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY   
UNLESS THERE'S A FENCE THAT     

03:18:29.060 --> 03:18:29.926
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY   
UNLESS THERE'S A FENCE THAT     
THEY HAVE TO MOUNT AND EVEN     

03:18:29.928 --> 03:18:32.862
UNLESS THERE'S A FENCE THAT     
THEY HAVE TO MOUNT AND EVEN     
THEN THAT MIGHT BE AN OBSTACLE  

03:18:32.864 --> 03:18:37.266
THEY HAVE TO MOUNT AND EVEN     
THEN THAT MIGHT BE AN OBSTACLE  
THAT THEY TRY TO ADVANCE OVER.  

03:18:37.268 --> 03:18:38.201
THEN THAT MIGHT BE AN OBSTACLE  
THAT THEY TRY TO ADVANCE OVER.  
AND THEN FINALLY I THINK IT IS  

03:18:38.203 --> 03:18:40.336

STERILELY I'M LIKE THESE ARE    
THE I'M PART OF IT LOOKS        
WALKABLE AND BITING AND LIKE    

03:24:18.844 --> 03:24:19.509
THE I'M PART OF IT LOOKS        
WALKABLE AND BITING AND LIKE    
THERE'S THESE LITTLE GREEN      

03:24:19.511 --> 03:24:20.243
WALKABLE AND BITING AND LIKE    
THERE'S THESE LITTLE GREEN      
SPACES AND THEN I MOVE OVER     

03:24:20.245 --> 03:24:22.612
THERE'S THESE LITTLE GREEN      
SPACES AND THEN I MOVE OVER     
HERE AND I'M KIND OF LIKE OH    

03:24:22.614 --> 03:24:23.479
SPACES AND THEN I MOVE OVER     
HERE AND I'M KIND OF LIKE OH    
YOU'VE GOT THESE LIKE FACING    

03:24:23.481 --> 03:24:27.349
HERE AND I'M KIND OF LIKE OH    
YOU'VE GOT THESE LIKE FACING    
NOBODY SO IF I CAN EXPLAIN TO   

03:24:27.351 --> 03:24:30.753
YOU'VE GOT THESE LIKE FACING    
NOBODY SO IF I CAN EXPLAIN TO   
YOU ESSENTIALLY WE THOUGHT      

03:24:30.755 --> 03:24:31.654
NOBODY SO IF I CAN EXPLAIN TO   
YOU ESSENTIALLY WE THOUGHT      
ABOUT DOING THAT SO YOU WOULD   

03:24:31.656 --> 03:24:34.857
YOU ESSENTIALLY WE THOUGHT      
ABOUT DOING THAT SO YOU WOULD   
BASICALLY HAVE THE REAR         

03:24:34.859 --> 03:24:35.658
ABOUT DOING THAT SO YOU WOULD   
BASICALLY HAVE THE REAR         
OF THESE HOMES ALONG THIS ROAD  

03:24:35.660 --> 03:24:38.294
BASICALLY HAVE THE REAR         
OF THESE HOMES ALONG THIS ROAD  
AND WE JUST FELT THAT WAS NOT A 

03:24:38.296 --> 03:24:38.661
OF THESE HOMES ALONG THIS ROAD  
AND WE JUST FELT THAT WAS NOT A 
GOOD LOOK.                      

03:24:38.663 --> 03:24:39.628
AND WE JUST FELT THAT WAS NOT A 
GOOD LOOK.                      
SO THAT WAS SORT OF THE IMPETUS 

03:24:39.630 --> 03:24:42.264
GOOD LOOK.                      
SO THAT WAS SORT OF THE IMPETUS 
FOR THAT AND THEN WE'D HAVE     

03:24:42.266 --> 03:24:42.898
SO THAT WAS SORT OF THE IMPETUS 
FOR THAT AND THEN WE'D HAVE     
ANOTHER ROAD BACK HERE.         

03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:43.566
FOR THAT AND THEN WE'D HAVE     
ANOTHER ROAD BACK HERE.         
SO IT'S ADDITIONAL IMPERVIOUS   

03:24:43.568 --> 03:24:45.568
ANOTHER ROAD BACK HERE.         
SO IT'S ADDITIONAL IMPERVIOUS   
SURFACE.                        

03:24:45.570 --> 03:24:46.636
SO IT'S ADDITIONAL IMPERVIOUS   
SURFACE.                        
THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS YOU   

03:24:46.638 --> 03:24:49.472
SURFACE.                        
THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS YOU   
HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN DISTANCE 

03:24:49.474 --> 03:24:50.240
THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS YOU   
HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN DISTANCE 
BEHIND THE UNITS FOR FIRE.      

03:24:50.242 --> 03:24:51.340
HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN DISTANCE 
BEHIND THE UNITS FOR FIRE.      
IT'S CALLED THE LAY DOWN        

03:24:51.342 --> 03:24:53.576
BEHIND THE UNITS FOR FIRE.      
IT'S CALLED THE LAY DOWN        
REQUIREMENT.                    

03:24:53.578 --> 03:24:54.610
IT'S CALLED THE LAY DOWN        
REQUIREMENT.                    
SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S A THIRD   

03:24:54.612 --> 03:24:55.144
REQUIREMENT.                    
SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S A THIRD   
MORE PAVEMENT HERE.             

03:24:55.146 --> 03:24:56.679
SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S A THIRD   
MORE PAVEMENT HERE.             
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.       

03:24:56.681 --> 03:24:57.747
MORE PAVEMENT HERE.             
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.       
WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID IT PRETTY 

03:24:57.749 --> 03:25:01.016
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.       
WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID IT PRETTY 
MUCH EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT IT     

03:25:01.018 --> 03:25:01.751
WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID IT PRETTY 
MUCH EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT IT     
REALLY FACTORS INTO THE SITE    

03:25:01.753 --> 03:25:02.051
MUCH EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT IT     
REALLY FACTORS INTO THE SITE    
PLAN DESIGN.                    

03:25:02.053 --> 03:25:04.854
REALLY FACTORS INTO THE SITE    
PLAN DESIGN.                    
SO THAT'S THOSE THINGS I'M      

03:25:04.856 --> 03:25:05.722
PLAN DESIGN.                    
SO THAT'S THOSE THINGS I'M      
TALKING ABOUT THE JIGSAW PUZZLE 

03:25:05.724 --> 03:25:06.322
SO THAT'S THOSE THINGS I'M      
TALKING ABOUT THE JIGSAW PUZZLE 
THAT'S THAT'S A BIG WE START    

03:25:06.324 --> 03:25:09.158
TALKING ABOUT THE JIGSAW PUZZLE 
THAT'S THAT'S A BIG WE START    
WITH THAT TO BE HONEST IS THE   

03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:09.925
THAT'S THAT'S A BIG WE START    
WITH THAT TO BE HONEST IS THE   
LAY DOWN REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRE  

03:25:09.927 --> 03:25:11.895
WITH THAT TO BE HONEST IS THE   
LAY DOWN REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRE  
SO IT REALLY DICTATES HOW THIS  

03:25:11.897 --> 03:25:12.362
LAY DOWN REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRE  
SO IT REALLY DICTATES HOW THIS  
IS BUILT.                       

03:25:12.364 --> 03:25:13.362
SO IT REALLY DICTATES HOW THIS  
IS BUILT.                       
I FULLY SEE IT NOW WHAT YOU'RE  

03:25:13.364 --> 03:25:15.565
IS BUILT.                       
I FULLY SEE IT NOW WHAT YOU'RE  
TALKING ABOUT I DON'T THINK     

03:25:15.567 --> 03:25:16.433
I FULLY SEE IT NOW WHAT YOU'RE  
TALKING ABOUT I DON'T THINK     
THERE'S MUCH WE COULD DO.       

03:25:16.435 --> 03:25:17.500
TALKING ABOUT I DON'T THINK     
THERE'S MUCH WE COULD DO.       
WE WOULD MOVE THIS BACK IF WE   

03:25:17.502 --> 03:25:20.436
THERE'S MUCH WE COULD DO.       
WE WOULD MOVE THIS BACK IF WE   
COULD WE JUST WE HAVE TO HAVE   

03:25:20.438 --> 03:25:21.170
WE WOULD MOVE THIS BACK IF WE   
COULD WE JUST WE HAVE TO HAVE   
THAT SEPARATION FOR FIRE TO

COULD WE JUST WE HAVE TO HAVE   
THAT SEPARATION FOR FIRE TO     
BASICALLY LAY DOWN AND PUT      

03:25:23.641 --> 03:25:24.673
THAT SEPARATION FOR FIRE TO     
BASICALLY LAY DOWN AND PUT      
LADDERS TO GET TO THE TOP       

03:25:24.675 --> 03:25:25.408
BASICALLY LAY DOWN AND PUT      
LADDERS TO GET TO THE TOP       
OF THE ROOF AND YOU HAVE NO     

03:25:25.410 --> 03:25:27.143
LADDERS TO GET TO THE TOP       
OF THE ROOF AND YOU HAVE NO

03:25:27.145 --> 03:25:28.277
OF THE ROOF AND YOU HAVE NO     
OTHER ROOM ON THE EAST.         
I TRIED TO BUY THAT PROPERTY.   

03:25:28.279 --> 03:25:31.781
OTHER ROOM ON THE EAST.         
I TRIED TO BUY THAT PROPERTY.   
OH, I'D LOVE TO MAYBE SOMEDAY   

03:25:31.783 --> 03:25:32.582
I TRIED TO BUY THAT PROPERTY.   
OH, I'D LOVE TO MAYBE SOMEDAY   
AND THEN YOU CAN CREATE MORE    

03:25:32.584 --> 03:25:35.484
OH, I'D LOVE TO MAYBE SOMEDAY   
AND THEN YOU CAN CREATE MORE    
UNITS FACING KNOW ANDREW WHY IS 

03:25:35.486 --> 03:25:39.522
AND THEN YOU CAN CREATE MORE    
UNITS FACING KNOW ANDREW WHY IS 
THERE A GATE AT THE TOP OF THAT 

03:25:39.524 --> 03:25:39.855
UNITS FACING KNOW ANDREW WHY IS 
THERE A GATE AT THE TOP OF THAT 
ROAD?                           

03:25:39.857 --> 03:25:40.590
THERE A GATE AT THE TOP OF THAT

QUESTION.                       

03:25:40.959 --> 03:25:42.892

QUESTION.                       
THAT'S AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE     

03:25:42.894 --> 03:25:43.293
QUESTION.                       
THAT'S AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE     
ACCESS GATE.                    

03:25:43.295 --> 03:25:44.226
THAT'S AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE     
ACCESS GATE.                    
SO THAT DOES NOT SUFFICE FOR    

03:25:44.228 --> 03:25:47.230
ACCESS GATE.                    
SO THAT DOES NOT SUFFICE FOR    
THE SECOND POINT OF ACCESS,     

03:25:47.232 --> 03:25:48.130
SO THAT DOES NOT SUFFICE FOR    
THE SECOND POINT OF ACCESS,     
WE'RE OVER THIRTY UNITS SO WE   

03:25:48.132 --> 03:25:50.266
THE SECOND POINT OF ACCESS,     
WE'RE OVER THIRTY UNITS SO WE   
NEED A SECOND POINT OF ACCESS   

03:25:50.268 --> 03:25:51.000
WE'RE OVER THIRTY UNITS SO WE   
NEED A SECOND POINT OF ACCESS   
BUT BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE     

03:25:51.002 --> 03:25:54.003
NEED A SECOND POINT OF ACCESS   
BUT BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE     
FROM THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH I  

03:25:54.005 --> 03:25:54.870
BUT BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE     
FROM THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH I  
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WIDTH TO HAVE

FROM THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH I  
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WIDTH TO HAVE

03:25:57.975 --> 03:25:58.875
TWO ENTRANCES AND I HAVE

SO THAT DOES NOT MEET OUR       

03:25:58.877 --> 03:26:01.978
NOWHERE ELSE TO CONNECT.        
SO THAT DOES NOT MEET OUR       
SECOND ACCESS BUT IT DOES MEET  

03:26:01.980 --> 03:26:02.779
SO THAT DOES NOT MEET OUR       
SECOND ACCESS BUT IT DOES MEET  
THE REQUIREMENT FOR HAVING AN   

03:26:02.781 --> 03:26:06.181
SECOND ACCESS BUT IT DOES MEET  
THE REQUIREMENT FOR HAVING AN   
EXTRA LONG ROAD DRIVE HERE.     

03:26:06.183 --> 03:26:07.249
THE REQUIREMENT FOR HAVING AN

SO IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT HERE   

03:26:07.251 --> 03:26:10.185
EXTRA LONG ROAD DRIVE HERE.     
SO IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT HERE   
THIS WOULD BE TOO LONG OF A     

03:26:10.187 --> 03:26:10.520
SO IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT HERE   
THIS WOULD BE TOO LONG OF A     
DRIVE.                          

03:26:10.522 --> 03:26:11.420
THIS WOULD BE TOO LONG OF A     
DRIVE.

03:26:15.026 --> 03:26:17.927
AS A SECOND THE EMERGENCY

TO FIRE SUPPRESS THESE BECAUSE

ACCESS BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  
TO FIRE SUPPRESS THESE BECAUSE  
OF THAT WHICH IS AN EXTRA

BUT WE STILL DO NEED IT BECAUSE

TWENTY THOUSAND A UNIT OR SO.   
BUT WE STILL DO NEED IT BECAUSE

IN WHICH WAS SORT OF MY RANT    
BEFORE RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF A 
SOLID WASTE ENCLOSURE WHICH BY

BEFORE RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF A 
SOLID WASTE ENCLOSURE WHICH BY  
THE WAY WOULD BE GREAT OPEN

SOLID WASTE ENCLOSURE WHICH BY  
THE WAY WOULD BE GREAT OPEN

SPACE OR MAYBE A COUPLE         
OF PARKING SPACES IF WE COULD   
GET A MORE BUT IT WOULD         

03:27:50.422 --> 03:27:51.220
OF PARKING SPACES IF WE COULD   
GET A MORE BUT IT WOULD         
BASICALLY RUN RIGHT INTO THAT   

03:27:51.222 --> 03:27:53.556
GET A MORE BUT IT WOULD         
BASICALLY RUN RIGHT INTO THAT   
SO SO THAT WAS MY NEXT POINT I

IT'S HALLWAY'S STADIUM BUT      

03:34:31.889 --> 03:34:38.627
BRING IN THE SOUTH MAIN THING   
IT'S HALLWAY'S STADIUM BUT      
NONETHELESS BUT LIKE 75 S IS

WRONG THERE IS A 75 AND IT'S    

03:34:54.779 --> 03:34:58.113
THE ROAD AND JUST IT'S JUST     
WRONG THERE IS A 75 AND IT'S    
NOT IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.        

03:34:58.115 --> 03:34:58.914
WRONG THERE IS A 75 AND IT'S    
NOT IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.        
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT IS         

03:34:58.916 --> 03:35:01.550
NOT IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.        
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT IS         
SOMETHING THAT I FEEL VERY

SOMETHING THAT I FEEL VERY      
STRONGLY ABOUT.                 

03:35:02.086 --> 03:35:05.754
SOMETHING THAT I FEEL VERY      
STRONGLY ABOUT.                 
>> OK, SO THE NEXT THING IS I   

03:35:05.756 --> 03:35:06.488
STRONGLY ABOUT.                 
>> OK, SO THE NEXT THING IS I   
APPRECIATE THAT PEOPLE DON'T    

03:35:06.490 --> 03:35:06.955
>> OK, SO THE NEXT THING IS I   
APPRECIATE THAT PEOPLE DON'T    
WANT CONNECTIVITY.              

03:35:06.957 --> 03:35:09.291
APPRECIATE THAT PEOPLE DON'T    
WANT CONNECTIVITY.              
THIS IS YOUR ISSUE THEN THE     

03:35:09.293 --> 03:35:10.392
WANT CONNECTIVITY.              
THIS IS YOUR ISSUE THEN THE     
CITY ISSUE THIS WHOLE AREA IS A 

03:35:10.394 --> 03:35:12.995
THIS IS YOUR ISSUE THEN THE     
CITY ISSUE THIS WHOLE AREA IS A 
MESS OF UNCONNECTED PIECES.     

03:35:12.997 --> 03:35:14.196
CITY ISSUE THIS WHOLE AREA IS A 
MESS OF UNCONNECTED PIECES.     
IT IS AND IT'S CAUSING PROBLEMS 

03:35:14.198 --> 03:35:17.032
MESS OF UNCONNECTED PIECES.     
IT IS AND IT'S CAUSING PROBLEMS 
FOR FIRE.                       

03:35:17.034 --> 03:35:20.836
IT IS AND IT'S CAUSING PROBLEMS 
FOR FIRE.                       
IT CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR SOLID    

03:35:20.838 --> 03:35:24.873
FOR FIRE.                       
IT CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR SOLID    
WASTE AND I THINK WE'RE FILLING 

03:35:24.875 --> 03:35:25.907
IT CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR SOLID    
WASTE AND I THINK WE'RE FILLING 
UP THIS CHUNK BUT I THINK WE    

03:35:25.909 --> 03:35:29.678
WASTE AND I THINK WE'RE FILLING 
UP THIS CHUNK BUT I THINK WE    
SEE WHY WE DON'T WANT TO DO     

03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:30.312
UP THIS CHUNK BUT I THINK WE    
SEE WHY WE DON'T WANT TO DO     
UNCONNECTED AREAS IN THE        

03:35:30.314 --> 03:35:30.712
SEE WHY WE DON'T WANT TO DO     
UNCONNECTED AREAS IN THE        
FUTURE.                         

03:35:30.714 --> 03:35:33.415
UNCONNECTED AREAS IN THE        
FUTURE.                         
SO THAT'S AGAIN IT'S NOT REALLY 

03:35:33.417 --> 03:35:36.718
FUTURE.                         
SO THAT'S AGAIN IT'S NOT REALLY 
YOUR ISSUE BUT IT'S PROBLEMATIC 

03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:36.952
SO THAT'S AGAIN IT'S NOT REALLY 
YOUR ISSUE BUT IT'S PROBLEMATIC 
.

SIDEWALKS THEY DON'T CONNECT TO

SO LIKE IF YOU I MAYBE IF

SO LIKE IF YOU I MAYBE IF       
YOU'RE COMING DOWN THE CENTER   
AISLE THEN YOU COULD GET TO AN  

03:35:48.866 --> 03:35:51.967
YOU'RE COMING DOWN THE CENTER   
AISLE THEN YOU COULD GET TO AN  
ISOLATED ROAD BUT LIKE BEHIND

AISLE THEN YOU COULD GET TO AN  
ISOLATED ROAD BUT LIKE BEHIND   
NUMBER SEVENTY FIVE THE         

03:35:52.769 --> 03:35:55.604
ISOLATED ROAD BUT LIKE BEHIND   
NUMBER SEVENTY FIVE THE         
SIDEWALK AND 334 OF THE         

03:35:55.606 --> 03:35:56.372
NUMBER SEVENTY FIVE THE         
SIDEWALK AND 334 OF THE         
SIDEWALK OF THE SIDEWALK GO

SIDEWALK AND 334 OF THE         
SIDEWALK OF THE SIDEWALK GO     
THROUGH BEHIND 34 BUT IT        

03:35:59.643 --> 03:36:03.044
SIDEWALK OF THE SIDEWALK GO     
THROUGH BEHIND 34 BUT IT        
DOESN'T GO THROUGH 303.         

03:36:03.046 --> 03:36:04.079
THROUGH BEHIND 34 BUT IT        
DOESN'T GO THROUGH 303.         
SO IT'S JUST I REALLY           

03:36:04.081 --> 03:36:07.483

SIDEWALK TO UNIVERSALIZING BUT  

03:36:09.953 --> 03:36:14.389
APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE THE    
SIDEWALK TO UNIVERSALIZING BUT  
INTERNAL SIDEWALKS DON'T ALL    

03:36:14.391 --> 03:36:15.124
SIDEWALK TO UNIVERSALIZING BUT  
INTERNAL SIDEWALKS DON'T ALL    
CONNECT TO THAT SIDEWALK SO     

03:36:15.126 --> 03:36:18.360
INTERNAL SIDEWALKS DON'T ALL    
CONNECT TO THAT SIDEWALK SO     
THAT'S JUST A FACT TO THINK I   

03:36:18.362 --> 03:36:19.328
CONNECT TO THAT SIDEWALK SO     
THAT'S JUST A FACT TO THINK I   
CAN LOOK AT THAT THESE ARE LESS 

03:36:19.330 --> 03:36:22.164
THAT'S JUST A FACT TO THINK I   
CAN LOOK AT THAT THESE ARE LESS 
SIDEWALKS THAN THEY ARE FRONT   

03:36:22.166 --> 03:36:22.764
CAN LOOK AT THAT THESE ARE LESS 
SIDEWALKS THAN THEY ARE FRONT   
ENTRANCES OR REAR END.          

03:36:22.766 --> 03:36:23.565
SIDEWALKS THAN THEY ARE FRONT   
ENTRANCES OR REAR END.          
YEAH, THEY'RE NOT REALLY        

03:36:23.567 --> 03:36:23.899
ENTRANCES OR REAR END.          
YEAH, THEY'RE NOT REALLY        
SIDEWALKS.                      

03:36:23.901 --> 03:36:24.900
YEAH, THEY'RE NOT REALLY        
SIDEWALKS.                      
THEY'RE JUST PAST THE DOORS     

03:36:24.902 --> 03:36:32.040
SIDEWALKS.                      
THEY'RE JUST PAST THE DOORS     
COME SO THERE'S THAT AND THEN   

03:36:32.042 --> 03:36:36.078
THEY'RE JUST PAST THE DOORS     
COME SO THERE'S THAT AND THEN   
GARBAGE COLLECTION I THINK      

03:36:36.080 --> 03:36:37.012
COME SO THERE'S THAT AND THEN   
GARBAGE COLLECTION I THINK      
THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE A       

03:36:37.014 --> 03:36:37.746
GARBAGE COLLECTION I THINK      
THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE A       
PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE IS NO     

03:36:37.748 --> 03:36:38.214
THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE A       
PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE IS NO     
CONNECTIVITY.                   

03:36:38.216 --> 03:36:40.048
PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE IS NO     
CONNECTIVITY.                   
SO YOU'RE GOING TO EITHER HAVE  

03:36:40.050 --> 03:36:40.849
CONNECTIVITY.                   
SO YOU'RE GOING TO EITHER HAVE  
GARBAGE TRUCKS BACKING UP.      

03:36:40.851 --> 03:36:42.017
SO YOU'RE GOING TO EITHER HAVE  
GARBAGE TRUCKS BACKING UP.      
I MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE A       

03:36:42.019 --> 03:36:43.785
GARBAGE TRUCKS BACKING UP.      
I MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE A       
MASSIVE BEEPING AND CRASHING    

03:36:43.787 --> 03:36:45.321
I MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE A       
MASSIVE BEEPING AND CRASHING    
AND I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT  

03:36:45.323 --> 03:36:49.658
MASSIVE BEEPING AND CRASHING    
AND I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT  
IT IS SEWAGE ISSUES.            

03:36:49.660 --> 03:36:53.162
AND I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT  
IT IS SEWAGE ISSUES.            
SOMEBODY BROUGHT UP THE SEWAGE  

03:36:53.164 --> 03:36:54.095
IT IS SEWAGE ISSUES.            
SOMEBODY BROUGHT UP THE SEWAGE  
ISSUES AND I THINK THERE'S      

03:36:54.097 --> 03:36:57.099
SOMEBODY BROUGHT UP THE SEWAGE  
ISSUES AND I THINK THERE'S      
MAYBE SOMEONE FROM THE CITY     

03:36:57.101 --> 03:36:58.266
ISSUES AND I THINK THERE'S      
MAYBE SOMEONE FROM THE CITY     
I'LL TALK ABOUT I MEAN I CAN    

03:36:58.268 --> 03:37:01.436
MAYBE SOMEONE FROM THE CITY     
I'LL TALK ABOUT I MEAN I CAN    
ADDRESS IT IN A GENERAL SENSE   

03:37:01.438 --> 03:37:02.304
I'LL TALK ABOUT I MEAN I CAN    
ADDRESS IT IN A GENERAL SENSE   
JUST LIKE ALL PROJECTS OUT      

03:37:02.306 --> 03:37:03.038
ADDRESS IT IN A GENERAL SENSE   
JUST LIKE ALL PROJECTS OUT      
OF YOU THAT COME BEFORE YOU AND 

03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:05.607
JUST LIKE ALL PROJECTS OUT      
OF YOU THAT COME BEFORE YOU AND 
COUNCIL ULTIMATELY THEY DO      

03:37:05.609 --> 03:37:06.275
OF YOU THAT COME BEFORE YOU AND 
COUNCIL ULTIMATELY THEY DO      
PROVIDE SANITARY SEWER          

03:37:06.277 --> 03:37:09.544
COUNCIL ULTIMATELY THEY DO      
PROVIDE SANITARY SEWER          
CALCULATION'S THOSE THEIR MODEL 

03:37:09.546 --> 03:37:10.212
PROVIDE SANITARY SEWER          
CALCULATION'S THOSE THEIR MODEL 
WE HAVE A SANITARY SEWER        

03:37:10.214 --> 03:37:10.880
CALCULATION'S THOSE THEIR MODEL 
WE HAVE A SANITARY SEWER        
MODELING SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE    

03:37:10.882 --> 03:37:13.848
WE HAVE A SANITARY SEWER        
MODELING SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE    
THAT THERE'S NO UNDUE NO        

03:37:13.850 --> 03:37:16.484
MODELING SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE    
THAT THERE'S NO UNDUE NO        
DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS AS MANY      

03:37:16.486 --> 03:37:17.586
THAT THERE'S NO UNDUE NO        
DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS AS MANY      
OF YOU MAY BE AWARE, THIS AREA  

03:37:17.588 --> 03:37:18.486
DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS AS MANY      
OF YOU MAY BE AWARE, THIS AREA  
WAS PLAGUED WITH FLOODING FOR A 

03:37:18.488 --> 03:37:20.488
OF YOU MAY BE AWARE, THIS AREA  
WAS PLAGUED WITH FLOODING FOR A 
WHILE.                          

03:37:20.490 --> 03:37:21.590
WAS PLAGUED WITH FLOODING FOR A 
WHILE.                          
THAT HAS FOR THE MOST PART BEEN 

03:37:21.592 --> 03:37:24.460
WHILE.                          
THAT HAS FOR THE MOST PART BEEN 
REMEDIATED BY A COUPLE OF ONE   

03:37:24.462 --> 03:37:25.460
THAT HAS FOR THE MOST PART BEEN 
REMEDIATED BY A COUPLE OF ONE   
WAS A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT  

03:37:25.462 --> 03:37:26.095
REMEDIATED BY A COUPLE OF ONE   
WAS A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT  
YOU GUYS SAW MANY YEARS AGO     

03:37:26.097 --> 03:37:26.828
WAS A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT  
YOU GUYS SAW MANY YEARS AGO     
WHICH ACTUALLY WASN'T BUILT BUT 

03:37:26.830 --> 03:37:28.096
YOU GUYS SAW MANY YEARS AGO     
WHICH ACTUALLY WASN'T BUILT BUT 
THEY DID BUILD A DETENTION      

03:37:28.098 --> 03:37:28.430
WHICH ACTUALLY WASN'T BUILT BUT 
THEY DID BUILD A DETENTION      
BASIN.                          

03:37:28.432 --> 03:37:31.533
THEY DID BUILD A DETENTION      
BASIN.                          
SO THAT HAS ADDRESSED SOME      

03:37:31.535 --> 03:37:32.234
BASIN.                          
SO THAT HAS ADDRESSED SOME      
OF THE FLOODING SCENARIOS IN    

03:37:32.236 --> 03:37:32.568
SO THAT HAS ADDRESSED SOME      
OF THE FLOODING SCENARIOS IN    
THAT AREA.                      

03:37:32.570 --> 03:37:36.272
OF THE FLOODING SCENARIOS IN    
THAT AREA.                      
SO I'M NOT NOT THE FLOODING     

03:37:36.274 --> 03:37:39.808
THAT AREA.                      
SO I'M NOT NOT THE FLOODING     
EXPERT HERE BUT I I'VE HEARD    

03:37:39.810 --> 03:37:40.543
SO I'M NOT NOT THE FLOODING     
EXPERT HERE BUT I I'VE HEARD    
THOSE THAT HAVE ADDRESSED THAT  

03:37:40.545 --> 03:37:41.210
EXPERT HERE BUT I I'VE HEARD    
THOSE THAT HAVE ADDRESSED THAT  
SITUATION AND AGAIN THEY'VE     

03:37:41.212 --> 03:37:43.879
THOSE THAT HAVE ADDRESSED THAT  
SITUATION AND AGAIN THEY'VE     
MODELED THEIR SANITARY IMPACTS  

03:37:43.881 --> 03:37:44.680
SITUATION AND AGAIN THEY'VE     
MODELED THEIR SANITARY IMPACTS  
IN THE CITY DOES FEEL THAT IT'S 

03:37:44.682 --> 03:37:46.948
MODELED THEIR SANITARY IMPACTS  
IN THE CITY DOES FEEL THAT IT'S 
WE HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND 

03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:47.482
IN THE CITY DOES FEEL THAT IT'S 
WE HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND 
THEY HAD TO THAT.               

03:37:47.484 --> 03:37:48.450
WE HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND 
THEY HAD TO THAT.               
>> SO YEAH, I MEAN OBVIOUSLY    

03:37:48.452 --> 03:37:50.652
