TIME.                           
YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK 
WHAT SHOULD BE NOTED HERE IS    

00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:03.217
YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK 
WHAT SHOULD BE NOTED HERE IS    
THAT THE CITY ACTUALLY DOESN&amp;apos;T

STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.    

00:08:10.226 --> 00:08:11.092

00:08:56.939 --> 00:08:57.638
JUST BY ITSELF, NOT THE FULL    
ROAD RESURFACING BIKE LANE WAS  
IN POOR CONDITION AND SO WE     

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.373
ROAD RESURFACING BIKE LANE WAS  
IN POOR CONDITION AND SO WE     
WENT IN AND RESURFACED KIND     

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:01.041
IN POOR CONDITION AND SO WE

HOWEVER, OVER TIME THE          
PURCHASING POWER OF FUN HAS     

00:09:09.018 --> 00:09:09.717
HOWEVER, OVER TIME THE          
PURCHASING POWER OF FUN HAS     
SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED BECAUSE AS  

00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:12.587
PURCHASING POWER OF FUN HAS     
SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED BECAUSE AS  
WE PUT IN MORE BIKE FACILITIES  

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:13.454
SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED BECAUSE AS  
WE PUT IN MORE BIKE FACILITIES  
THAT OFTEN HELPS PAY FOR        

00:09:13.456 --> 00:09:15.423
WE PUT IN MORE BIKE FACILITIES  
THAT OFTEN HELPS PAY FOR        
MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES WHEN     

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:16.224
THAT OFTEN HELPS PAY FOR        
MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES WHEN     
PUBLIC WORKS GOES OUT AND       

00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:19.294
MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES WHEN     
PUBLIC WORKS GOES OUT AND       
SWEEPS AND SNOW PLOWS BIKE      

00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:20.394
PUBLIC WORKS GOES OUT AND       
SWEEPS AND SNOW PLOWS BIKE      
LANES, THEY CHARGE THAT TO THE  

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:23.264
SWEEPS AND SNOW PLOWS BIKE      
LANES, THEY CHARGE THAT TO THE  
FUND BECAUSE IT DOES HELP       

00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:23.898
LANES, THEY CHARGE THAT TO THE  
FUND BECAUSE IT DOES HELP       
MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES.      

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.335
FUND BECAUSE IT DOES HELP       
MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES.      
AND SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT      

00:09:28.337 --> 00:09:29.136
MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES.      
AND SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT      
WE&amp;apos;RE MAYBE A VICTIM OF OUR     

00:09:29.138 --> 00:09:29.871
AND SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT      
WE&amp;apos;RE MAYBE A VICTIM OF OUR     
SUCCESS WHERE THE MORE OF THESE 

00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:31.406
WE&amp;apos;RE MAYBE A VICTIM OF OUR     
SUCCESS WHERE THE MORE OF THESE 
FACILITIES WE PUT IN, THE MORE  

00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:32.139
SUCCESS WHERE THE MORE OF THESE 
FACILITIES WE PUT IN, THE MORE  
THE BIGGER PIECE OF THE PIE     

00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:34.509
FACILITIES WE PUT IN, THE MORE  
THE BIGGER PIECE OF THE PIE     
NEEDS TO GO TO THOSE            

00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:35.109
THE BIGGER PIECE OF THE PIE     
NEEDS TO GO TO THOSE            
MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.         

00:09:35.111 --> 00:09:35.910
NEEDS TO GO TO THOSE            
MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE LESS 

00:09:35.912 --> 00:09:38.946
MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE LESS 
ABILITY TO KIND OF PUT ALL FUND 

00:09:38.948 --> 00:09:39.581
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE LESS 
ABILITY TO KIND OF PUT ALL FUND 
TOWARDS CAPITAL PROJECTS OR     

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:42.984
ABILITY TO KIND OF PUT ALL FUND

EVEN KIND OF BANKROLL IT YEAR   
OVER YEAR AND NOW LUCKILY THERE 

00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:47.422
EVEN KIND OF BANKROLL IT YEAR   
OVER YEAR AND NOW LUCKILY THERE 
ARE MAYBE SOME OTHER FUNDING    

00:09:47.424 --> 00:09:48.289
OVER YEAR AND NOW LUCKILY THERE 
ARE MAYBE SOME OTHER FUNDING    
SOURCES ON THE HORIZON THAT CAN 

00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:50.758
ARE MAYBE SOME OTHER FUNDING    
SOURCES ON THE HORIZON THAT CAN 
HELP FILL GAPS.                 

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.626
SOURCES ON THE HORIZON THAT CAN 
HELP FILL GAPS.                 
I THINK YOU&amp;apos;VE ALL HEARD ME     

00:09:51.628 --> 00:09:52.426

I THINK YOU&amp;apos;VE ALL HEARD ME     
REPORT IN THE PAST WHERE ARPA   

00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:53.161
I THINK YOU&amp;apos;VE ALL HEARD ME     
REPORT IN THE PAST WHERE ARPA   
IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT   

00:09:53.163 --> 00:09:54.395

IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT   
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BE DRAWING DOWN. 

00:09:54.397 --> 00:09:57.898
IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT   
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BE DRAWING DOWN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT LONG TERM THERE&amp;apos;S THERE  

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.833
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BE DRAWING DOWN. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT LONG TERM THERE&amp;apos;S THERE  
IS THIS KIND OF GAP WITH THE    

00:09:58.835 --> 00:09:59.434

IS THIS KIND OF GAP WITH THE    
OLD FUND IN TERMS OF ITS        

00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:02.036
IS THIS KIND OF GAP WITH THE    
OLD FUND IN TERMS OF ITS        
ABILITY TO FUND MORE NON        

00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:02.704

DOES THAT HELP MOLLY?           

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:05.973
MOTORIZED INFRASTRUCTURE.       
DOES THAT HELP MOLLY?           
WOULD YOU LIKE MORE CONTEXT?

UP IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WAS     
BECAUSE OF THE QUESTIONS AROUND 

00:10:15.152 --> 00:10:18.086
UP IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WAS     
BECAUSE OF THE QUESTIONS AROUND 
SNOP PLOWING SEPARATED BIKE     

00:10:18.088 --> 00:10:21.622
BECAUSE OF THE QUESTIONS AROUND 
SNOP PLOWING SEPARATED BIKE     
LANES AND SO INCREASING FUNDING 

00:10:21.624 --> 00:10:22.523
SNOP PLOWING SEPARATED BIKE     
LANES AND SO INCREASING FUNDING

WOULD MEAN INCREASING FUNDING   

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:25.993
FOR THE OLD FUND WOULD ALSO     
WOULD MEAN INCREASING FUNDING   
FOR MAINTAINING SEPARATED       

00:10:25.995 --> 00:10:26.661
WOULD MEAN INCREASING FUNDING   
FOR MAINTAINING SEPARATED       
FACILITIES WHEN WE GET THOSE

LOT OF THE STREET MAINTENANCE   

00:19:00.576 --> 00:19:03.644
ERICA KNOWS I THINK I THINK A   
LOT OF THE STREET MAINTENANCE

00:19:03.646 --> 00:19:04.045
LOT OF THE STREET MAINTENANCE   
ACTIVITIES ARE FUNDED WITH AT   
FIFTY ONE.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.619
SWEEPING.                       
I THINK ALL OF THOSE ACTIVITIES 
ARE COVERED UNDER ACTIVITY ONE  

00:19:12.621 --> 00:19:16.490
I THINK ALL OF THOSE ACTIVITIES 
ARE COVERED UNDER ACTIVITY ONE  
IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT OF IF

00:19:20.096 --> 00:19:20.894
IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT OF IF    
YOU KNOW HYPOTHETICALLY THIS    
ONE FROM FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY 

00:19:20.896 --> 00:19:21.629
YOU KNOW HYPOTHETICALLY THIS    
ONE FROM FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY 
PERCENT TO ALL FUND THERE WOULD

PERCENT TO ALL FUND THERE WOULD 
BE LESS MONEY IN THE REST       

00:19:24.534 --> 00:19:25.199
PERCENT TO ALL FUND THERE WOULD 
BE LESS MONEY IN THE REST

ACTIVITIES.                     

00:19:25.568 --> 00:19:28.602
OF THE PIE FOR THOSE            
ACTIVITIES.                     
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF YOU KNOW        

00:19:28.604 --> 00:19:29.303

OPERATIONALLY WHAT THAT IMPACT  
WOULD BE.                       
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF IT WOULD JUST   

00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:32.672
WOULD BE.                       
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF IT WOULD JUST   
MEAN MAYBE STREET SWEEPING LESS 

00:19:32.674 --> 00:19:35.308
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF IT WOULD JUST   
MEAN MAYBE STREET SWEEPING LESS 
OR MAYBE THERE&amp;apos;S LESS CARRY     

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.776
MEAN MAYBE STREET SWEEPING LESS 
OR MAYBE THERE&amp;apos;S LESS CARRY     
FORWARD BALANCE.                

00:19:35.778 --> 00:19:36.510
OR MAYBE THERE&amp;apos;S LESS CARRY     
FORWARD BALANCE.                
I KNOW THAT&amp;apos;S ANOTHER THING     

00:19:36.512 --> 00:19:40.047
FORWARD BALANCE.

THAT A LOT OF OUR FUNDS DO IF   
WE DON&amp;apos;T DRAW IT ALL DOWN ONE   

00:19:41.083 --> 00:19:43.083
THAT A LOT OF OUR FUNDS DO IF   
WE DON&amp;apos;T DRAW IT ALL DOWN ONE   
YEAR.                           

00:19:43.085 --> 00:19:44.017
WE DON&amp;apos;T DRAW IT ALL DOWN ONE   
YEAR.                           
THE OTHER THING I&amp;apos;VE HEARD FROM 

00:19:44.019 --> 00:19:44.952
YEAR.

MOLLY MOCHIZUKI, OUR PUBLIC     
WORKS DIRECTOR IS A LOT         

00:19:47.756 --> 00:19:50.224
MOLLY MOCHIZUKI, OUR PUBLIC     
WORKS DIRECTOR IS A LOT         
OF THOSE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES 

00:19:50.226 --> 00:19:50.957
WORKS DIRECTOR IS A LOT         
OF THOSE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES

DEPENDENT UPON SNOWFALL.        

00:19:54.263 --> 00:19:55.396
ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE, ESPECIALLY 
DEPENDENT UPON SNOWFALL.        
SO IF WE HAVE A VERY HEAVY SNOW 

00:19:55.398 --> 00:19:57.998
DEPENDENT UPON SNOWFALL.        
SO IF WE HAVE A VERY HEAVY SNOW 
YEAR THEY TEND TO BE OVER       

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.833
SO IF WE HAVE A VERY HEAVY SNOW

ON THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IF    
THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE USING.       
SO THE BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSSES  

00:51:10.872 --> 00:51:11.737
THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE USING.       
SO THE BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSSES  
WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW IS     

00:51:11.739 --> 00:51:14.573
SO THE BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSSES  
WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW IS     
THEY CERTAINLY WORK THE BUS     

00:51:14.575 --> 00:51:15.640
WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW IS     
THEY CERTAINLY WORK THE BUS     
ROLLS BUT THEY CAN&amp;apos;T DEPLOY     

00:51:15.642 --> 00:51:19.511
THEY CERTAINLY WORK THE BUS

00:51:24.519 --> 00:51:27.052
RANGE THAT DIESEL HISTORICALLY  
CAN DO WITH NO PROBLEM.         
SO WE&amp;apos;VE DISCOVERED THAT ONLY   

00:51:27.054 --> 00:51:27.919
CAN DO WITH NO PROBLEM.         
SO WE&amp;apos;VE DISCOVERED THAT ONLY   
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR ROUTES  

00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:31.090
SO WE&amp;apos;VE DISCOVERED THAT ONLY   
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR ROUTES  
COULD ACTUALLY BE COVERED ON A  

00:51:31.092 --> 00:51:31.757

IT&amp;apos;S ALSO NOT THAT BIG WHEN WE  
LOOK AT IT, IT REPRESENTS ABOUT 

00:53:50.764 --> 00:53:51.830
IT&amp;apos;S ALSO NOT THAT BIG WHEN WE  
LOOK AT IT, IT REPRESENTS ABOUT 
A HALF OF A PERCENT OF ALL THE

DECARBONIZING THE               

00:53:57.471 --> 00:53:58.270

SO GETTING THIS LAST LITTLE BIT 
OF EMISSIONS OUT OF THE SYSTEM  

00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:12.851
SO GETTING THIS LAST LITTLE BIT 
OF EMISSIONS OUT OF THE SYSTEM  
WILL BE AN EXPENSIVE            

00:54:12.853 --> 00:54:13.252

BURN MUCH CLEANER NOW THAN THEY 
DID BACK THEN.                  
SO THEY BECAME SO DIESEL BECAME 

00:57:21.875 --> 00:57:22.607
DID BACK THEN.                  
SO THEY BECAME SO DIESEL BECAME 
CLEANER AND CLEANER AND THE

I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SO THAT WE  
CAN MAKE SURE WE&amp;apos;RE REALLY      
PUTTING THE INCREASED CAPITAL   

01:00:41.908 --> 01:00:45.543
CAN MAKE SURE WE&amp;apos;RE REALLY      
PUTTING THE INCREASED CAPITAL   
EXPENDITURE IN PLACE THAT GETS  

01:00:45.545 --> 01:00:46.511
PUTTING THE INCREASED CAPITAL   
EXPENDITURE IN PLACE THAT GETS  
US THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK

NO LONGER BE A PRACTICAL        
CONSIDERATION AND RIGHT NOW WE  
CAN&amp;apos;T REALLY CLEARLY TELL WHICH

POPULAR FRANKLY FOR PUBLIC      
RELATIONS PURPOSES BECAUSE      
THEY&amp;apos;RE QUICK AND EASY AND THEY 

01:07:39.592 --> 01:07:40.758
RELATIONS PURPOSES BECAUSE      
THEY&amp;apos;RE QUICK AND EASY AND THEY 
WILL AT LEAST GO AS FAR AS THE

01:07:58.778 --> 01:07:59.577
OF THE RANGE ISSUE.             
BUT THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF CAUTIOUS   
OPTIMISM THAT BREAKTHROUGHS IN

ELIMINATE THAT PROBLEM IN       

01:08:03.382 --> 01:08:06.685
BATTERY TECHNOLOGY MIGHT        
ELIMINATE THAT PROBLEM IN       
BATTERIES MIGHT BECOME A VERY   

01:08:06.687 --> 01:08:07.551
ELIMINATE THAT PROBLEM IN       
BATTERIES MIGHT BECOME A VERY   
SUREFIRE WAY OF DOING IT.

01:23:30.442 --> 01:23:33.476
IT&amp;apos;S SHOWING TABS AT ALL OF THE 
INJURY LEVELS AND I HAVE THIS   
HERE I DID NOT ADJUST THE THE   

01:23:33.478 --> 01:23:37.914
INJURY LEVELS AND I HAVE THIS   
HERE I DID NOT ADJUST THE THE   
BASELINE FILTERING FOR THE      

01:23:37.916 --> 01:23:41.918
HERE I DID NOT ADJUST THE THE   
BASELINE FILTERING FOR THE      
VIOLATION ON THIS ONE BUT ON    

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.955
BASELINE FILTERING FOR THE      
VIOLATION ON THIS ONE BUT ON    
THIS NEXT SLIDE I ADJUSTED THE  

01:23:45.957 --> 01:23:49.493
VIOLATION ON THIS ONE BUT ON    
THIS NEXT SLIDE I ADJUSTED THE  
CRASH VIOLATION TO BE TRUE      

01:23:49.495 --> 01:23:50.360
THIS NEXT SLIDE I ADJUSTED THE  
CRASH VIOLATION TO BE TRUE      
OF LEFT OF CENTER JUST BECAUSE  

01:23:50.362 --> 01:23:53.363
CRASH VIOLATION TO BE TRUE      
OF LEFT OF CENTER JUST BECAUSE  
I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THAT   

01:23:53.365 --> 01:23:56.766
OF LEFT OF CENTER JUST BECAUSE  
I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THAT   
ONE WOULD COME OUT.

I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THAT   
ONE WOULD COME OUT.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE   

01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:00.770

OTHER AND I HAVE A LARGE BLOWUP 
UP OF WHAT THOSE LAYERS ARE.    
IF THERE&amp;apos;S A STRIKE THROUGH THE 

01:28:18.730 --> 01:28:19.262
UP OF WHAT THOSE LAYERS ARE.    
IF THERE&amp;apos;S A STRIKE THROUGH THE 
EYE, IT&amp;apos;S OFF.                  

01:28:19.264 --> 01:28:21.798
IF THERE&amp;apos;S A STRIKE THROUGH THE 
EYE, IT&amp;apos;S OFF.                  
IF THERE ISN&amp;apos;T, IT&amp;apos;S ON AND     

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.368
EYE, IT&amp;apos;S OFF.                  
IF THERE ISN&amp;apos;T, IT&amp;apos;S ON AND     
THEN YOU CAN ALSO GET THE KEY   

01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.969
IF THERE ISN&amp;apos;T, IT&amp;apos;S ON AND     
THEN YOU CAN ALSO GET THE KEY   
FOR THE MAP.                    

01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:27.037
THEN YOU CAN ALSO GET THE KEY   
FOR THE MAP.                    
SO FOR THE LAYER THAT WE WERE   

01:28:27.039 --> 01:28:29.573
FOR THE MAP.                    
SO FOR THE LAYER THAT WE WERE   
JUST LOOKING AT THAT WAS OPEN,  

01:28:29.575 --> 01:28:30.773
SO FOR THE LAYER THAT WE WERE   
JUST LOOKING AT THAT WAS OPEN,  
IT&amp;apos;S THE ALL DENSITY LAYER AND  

01:28:30.775 --> 01:28:34.411
JUST LOOKING AT THAT WAS OPEN,  
IT&amp;apos;S THE ALL DENSITY LAYER AND  
THEN HERE IS AN IMAGE OF THE    

01:28:34.413 --> 01:28:37.414
IT&amp;apos;S THE ALL DENSITY LAYER AND  
THEN HERE IS AN IMAGE OF THE    
KEY FOR THOSE CRASHES AND ONE   

01:28:37.416 --> 01:28:41.284
THEN HERE IS AN IMAGE OF THE    
KEY FOR THOSE CRASHES AND ONE   
THING THAT YOU MIGHT BE         

01:28:41.286 --> 01:28:44.855
KEY FOR THOSE CRASHES AND ONE   
THING THAT YOU MIGHT BE         
INTERESTED IN IS SHOWN IN THIS  

01:28:44.857 --> 01:28:45.722
THING THAT YOU MIGHT BE         
INTERESTED IN IS SHOWN IN THIS  
NEXT SLIDE WHERE WE HAVE ZOOMED 

01:28:45.724 --> 01:28:49.192
INTERESTED IN IS SHOWN IN THIS  
NEXT SLIDE WHERE WE HAVE ZOOMED 
INTO AN AREA THIS IS THE GLEN   

01:28:49.194 --> 01:28:49.926
NEXT SLIDE WHERE WE HAVE ZOOMED 
INTO AN AREA THIS IS THE GLEN   
AND FULLER AREA OF LEFT THAT    

01:28:49.928 --> 01:28:52.729
INTO AN AREA THIS IS THE GLEN   
AND FULLER AREA OF LEFT THAT    
KEEP MAP ON.                    

01:28:52.731 --> 01:28:53.763
AND FULLER AREA OF LEFT THAT    
KEEP MAP ON.                    
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HEAT MAP     

01:28:53.765 --> 01:28:54.163
KEEP MAP ON.                    
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HEAT MAP     
REALLY MEAN?                    

01:28:54.165 --> 01:28:55.699
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HEAT MAP     
REALLY MEAN?                    
SO I&amp;apos;VE TURNED THE VISUAL       

01:28:55.701 --> 01:28:56.633
REALLY MEAN?                    
SO I&amp;apos;VE TURNED THE VISUAL       
CRASHES ON AS WELL SO THAT YOU  

01:28:56.635 --> 01:29:00.037
SO I&amp;apos;VE TURNED THE VISUAL       
CRASHES ON AS WELL SO THAT YOU  
CAN LOOK AT FOR THAT PARTICULAR 

01:29:00.039 --> 01:29:03.940
CRASHES ON AS WELL SO THAT YOU  
CAN LOOK AT FOR THAT PARTICULAR 
HEAT WHAT WHAT&amp;apos;S THE NUMBER     

01:29:03.942 --> 01:29:04.675
CAN LOOK AT FOR THAT PARTICULAR 
HEAT WHAT WHAT&amp;apos;S THE NUMBER     
OF CRASHES WHERE THEY LOOK LIKE 

01:29:04.677 --> 01:29:05.475
HEAT WHAT WHAT&amp;apos;S THE NUMBER     
OF CRASHES WHERE THEY LOOK LIKE 
AND YOU CAN HOVER ON ONE        

01:29:05.477 --> 01:29:08.145
OF CRASHES WHERE THEY LOOK LIKE 
AND YOU CAN HOVER ON ONE        
OF THOSE CRASHES AND CLICK ON   

01:29:08.147 --> 01:29:08.879
AND YOU CAN HOVER ON ONE        
OF THOSE CRASHES AND CLICK ON   
IT AND GET MORE INFORMATION AND

CERTIFIED IN ANNUAL BASIS AND I 
THINK WHEN WE&amp;apos;RE IT&amp;apos;S IMPORTANT 
TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE ARE    

01:30:37.969 --> 01:30:41.237
THINK WHEN WE&amp;apos;RE IT&amp;apos;S IMPORTANT 
TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE ARE    
LOOKING AT SYSTEMIC DEPLOYMENTS 

01:30:41.239 --> 01:30:44.673
TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE ARE    
LOOKING AT SYSTEMIC DEPLOYMENTS 
AND WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT, YOU 

01:30:44.675 --> 01:30:48.544
LOOKING AT SYSTEMIC DEPLOYMENTS

AREAS.                          
ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT    
PRODUCING THE DATA IN THIS      

01:33:47.425 --> 01:33:51.293
ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT    
PRODUCING THE DATA IN THIS      
FORMAT IS THAT IT FREES UP TIME 

01:33:51.295 --> 01:33:54.663
PRODUCING THE DATA IN THIS      
FORMAT IS THAT IT FREES UP TIME 
TO DO MORE OF THAT THAT DEEP    

01:33:54.665 --> 01:33:55.464
FORMAT IS THAT IT FREES UP TIME 
TO DO MORE OF THAT THAT DEEP    
DOVE AND INSTEAD OF SPENDING    

01:33:55.466 --> 01:33:59.802
TO DO MORE OF THAT THAT DEEP    
DOVE AND INSTEAD OF SPENDING    
TIME, YOU KNOW, USED TO BE A    

01:33:59.804 --> 01:34:02.138
DOVE AND INSTEAD OF SPENDING    
TIME, YOU KNOW, USED TO BE A    
BIT OF A CUMBERSOME PROCESS     

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:02.939
TIME, YOU KNOW, USED TO BE A    
BIT OF A CUMBERSOME PROCESS     
OF DOWNLOADING DATA AND THEN    

01:34:02.941 --> 01:34:05.608
BIT OF A CUMBERSOME PROCESS     
OF DOWNLOADING DATA AND THEN    
MANUALLY MANIPULATING DATA AND  

01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:06.676
OF DOWNLOADING DATA AND THEN    
MANUALLY MANIPULATING DATA AND  
WORKING IT BACK UP INSTEAD WE   

01:34:06.678 --> 01:34:07.343
MANUALLY MANIPULATING DATA AND  
WORKING IT BACK UP INSTEAD WE   
HAVE FOUND A TECHNOLOGY         

01:34:07.345 --> 01:34:10.579
WORKING IT BACK UP INSTEAD WE   
HAVE FOUND A TECHNOLOGY         
SOLUTION WITH IT AND THE        

01:34:10.581 --> 01:34:14.384
HAVE FOUND A TECHNOLOGY         
SOLUTION WITH IT AND THE        
ANALYTICS FOLKS TO WHERE THEY   

01:34:14.386 --> 01:34:15.384
SOLUTION WITH IT AND THE        
ANALYTICS FOLKS TO WHERE THEY   
HAVE IT SET UP SO THAT NOW IT   

01:34:15.386 --> 01:34:22.025
ANALYTICS FOLKS TO WHERE THEY   
HAVE IT SET UP SO THAT NOW IT   
WILL PRODUCE THIS YOU KNOW, AND 

01:34:22.027 --> 01:34:22.792
HAVE IT SET UP SO THAT NOW IT   
WILL PRODUCE THIS YOU KNOW, AND 
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING THROUGH AND WE&amp;apos;RE   

01:34:22.794 --> 01:34:23.459
WILL PRODUCE THIS YOU KNOW, AND 
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING THROUGH AND WE&amp;apos;RE   
BACK CHECKING IT AND THINGS     

01:34:23.461 --> 01:34:23.793
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING THROUGH AND WE&amp;apos;RE   
BACK CHECKING IT AND THINGS     
LIKE THAT.

BACK CHECKING IT AND THINGS     
LIKE THAT.                      
BUT THEN WE HAVE WE&amp;apos;RE FREEING  

01:34:26.231 --> 01:34:29.732
LIKE THAT.                      
BUT THEN WE HAVE WE&amp;apos;RE FREEING  
UP TIME TO DO THOSE DEEPER      

01:34:29.734 --> 01:34:30.700
BUT THEN WE HAVE WE&amp;apos;RE FREEING  
UP TIME TO DO THOSE DEEPER      
DIVES NOW AND I REALLY          

01:34:30.702 --> 01:34:31.100
UP TIME TO DO THOSE DEEPER      
DIVES NOW AND I REALLY          
APPRECIATE THAT.                

01:34:31.102 --> 01:34:34.504
DIVES NOW AND I REALLY          
APPRECIATE THAT.                
I THINK SO FOR ME THE THE MAPS  

01:34:34.506 --> 01:34:37.540
APPRECIATE THAT.                
I THINK SO FOR ME THE THE MAPS  
THE CRASH MAPS ARE THE THINGS   

01:34:37.542 --> 01:34:38.274
I THINK SO FOR ME THE THE MAPS  
THE CRASH MAPS ARE THE THINGS   
THAT I&amp;apos;M MOST LIKELY TRYING TO  

01:34:38.276 --> 01:34:41.110
THE CRASH MAPS ARE THE THINGS   
THAT I&amp;apos;M MOST LIKELY TRYING TO  
POINT SOMEONE TO AND I ALSO MY  

01:34:41.112 --> 01:34:41.911
THAT I&amp;apos;M MOST LIKELY TRYING TO  
POINT SOMEONE TO AND I ALSO MY  
EXPERIENCE USING GIS IN         

01:34:41.913 --> 01:34:45.915
POINT SOMEONE TO AND I ALSO MY  
EXPERIENCE USING GIS IN         
WEBSITES IS THAT IT CAN BE HARD 

01:34:45.917 --> 01:34:46.649
EXPERIENCE USING GIS IN         
WEBSITES IS THAT IT CAN BE HARD 
TO FIGURE OUT AND SO AGAIN      

01:34:46.651 --> 01:34:49.418
WEBSITES IS THAT IT CAN BE HARD 
TO FIGURE OUT AND SO AGAIN      
THAT&amp;apos;S LIKE MAYBE THERE&amp;apos;S AN    

01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:50.052
TO FIGURE OUT AND SO AGAIN      
THAT&amp;apos;S LIKE MAYBE THERE&amp;apos;S AN    
ABILITY TO LINK SOMEONE         

01:34:50.054 --> 01:34:52.922
THAT&amp;apos;S LIKE MAYBE THERE&amp;apos;S AN    
ABILITY TO LINK SOMEONE         
DIRECTLY TO A PARTICULAR VISION 

01:34:52.924 --> 01:34:53.656
ABILITY TO LINK SOMEONE         
DIRECTLY TO A PARTICULAR VISION 
OF SOMETHING BUT ALSO IT&amp;apos;S      

01:34:53.658 --> 01:34:57.193
DIRECTLY TO A PARTICULAR VISION 
OF SOMETHING BUT ALSO IT&amp;apos;S      
OFTEN HARD TO DO ON A PHONE.    

01:34:57.195 --> 01:34:58.227
OF SOMETHING BUT ALSO IT&amp;apos;S      
OFTEN HARD TO DO ON A PHONE.    
AND SO EVEN IF IT&amp;apos;S A           

01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.895
OFTEN HARD TO DO ON A PHONE.    
AND SO EVEN IF IT&amp;apos;S A           
COLLECTION OF MAPS THAT ARE     

01:34:58.897 --> 01:35:01.931
AND SO EVEN IF IT&amp;apos;S A           
COLLECTION OF MAPS THAT ARE     
LIKE THE MAPS THAT WE USED TO   

01:35:01.933 --> 01:35:02.665
COLLECTION OF MAPS THAT ARE     
LIKE THE MAPS THAT WE USED TO   
GET THAT ARE THIS TIME THEY&amp;apos;RE  

01:35:02.667 --> 01:35:05.201
LIKE THE MAPS THAT WE USED TO   
GET THAT ARE THIS TIME THEY&amp;apos;RE  
JUST SCREENSHOTS FROM THE       

01:35:05.203 --> 01:35:06.002
GET THAT ARE THIS TIME THEY&amp;apos;RE  
JUST SCREENSHOTS FROM THE       
SYSTEM THAT YOU&amp;apos;VE BUILT SO     

01:35:06.004 --> 01:35:06.736
JUST SCREENSHOTS FROM THE       
SYSTEM THAT YOU&amp;apos;VE BUILT SO     
THAT IT&amp;apos;S NOT LIKE REBUILDING   

01:35:06.738 --> 01:35:09.005
SYSTEM THAT YOU&amp;apos;VE BUILT SO     
THAT IT&amp;apos;S NOT LIKE REBUILDING   
THOSE MAPS FROM SCRATCH.        

01:35:09.007 --> 01:35:10.173
THAT IT&amp;apos;S NOT LIKE REBUILDING   
THOSE MAPS FROM SCRATCH.        
I THINK THE THAT WOULD BE       

01:35:10.175 --> 01:35:13.242
THOSE MAPS FROM SCRATCH.        
I THINK THE THAT WOULD BE       
REALLY USEFUL.                  

01:35:13.244 --> 01:35:14.010

OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE CITY    
LIKE WEB ENVIRONMENT AND        

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:29.992
OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE CITY    
LIKE WEB ENVIRONMENT AND        
THEY&amp;apos;VE NEVER WORKED WITH GE&amp;apos;EZ 

01:35:29.994 --> 01:35:30.827

SOMETHING PROBABLY A FAILURE TO 
YIELD IS MAYBE GOING TO BE      

01:41:27.718 --> 01:41:28.551
SOMETHING PROBABLY A FAILURE TO 
YIELD IS MAYBE GOING TO BE      
SOMETHING THAT WE&amp;apos;RE INTERESTED 

01:41:28.553 --> 01:41:28.818
YIELD IS MAYBE GOING TO BE      
SOMETHING THAT WE&amp;apos;RE INTERESTED

YEAR AVERAGE ON HERE SO WE HAVE 

01:41:37.328 --> 01:41:40.262
ROLLING WE HAVE A ROLLING FIVE  
YEAR AVERAGE ON HERE SO WE HAVE 
A TREND LINE THAT TELLS US

BACKWARDS WHAT HAPPENS IN EACH  
OF THESE SERIOUS CRASH          
INCIDENTS LIKE IF WE AREN&amp;apos;T

INCIDENTS LIKE IF WE AREN&amp;apos;T     
FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT CAUSED     

01:45:13.944 --> 01:45:16.946
INCIDENTS LIKE IF WE AREN&amp;apos;T     
FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT CAUSED     
THOSE THEN WE AREN&amp;apos;T ADDRESSING 

01:45:16.948 --> 01:45:17.846
FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT CAUSED     
THOSE THEN WE AREN&amp;apos;T ADDRESSING 
THAT SERIOUS FAILURE IN THE

THOSE THEN WE AREN&amp;apos;T ADDRESSING 
THAT SERIOUS FAILURE IN THE     
SYSTEM.                         

01:45:19.650 --> 01:45:24.486
THAT SERIOUS FAILURE IN THE     
SYSTEM.                         
SO WHERE DO WE WHERE DO WE LOOK 

01:45:24.488 --> 01:45:28.157

01:45:43.608 --> 01:45:47.042
SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THE 
COMMUNITY IS TOO LONG.          
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A   

01:45:47.044 --> 01:45:50.846
COMMUNITY IS TOO LONG.          
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A   
FASTER RESPONSE FOR TELLING     

01:45:50.848 --> 01:45:51.714
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A   
FASTER RESPONSE FOR TELLING     
PEOPLE WHAT WE ARE GOING WHAT

FASTER RESPONSE FOR TELLING

SERIOUS CRASHES OF SERIOUS      
FAILURES IN OUR TRANSPORTATION  

01:45:58.689 --> 01:45:59.621
SERIOUS CRASHES OF SERIOUS      
FAILURES IN OUR TRANSPORTATION  
SYSTEM FASTER THAN ONCE PER     

01:45:59.623 --> 01:45:59.855
FAILURES IN OUR TRANSPORTATION  
SYSTEM FASTER THAN ONCE PER

LINES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN  

01:46:17.642 --> 01:46:18.441
TRYING TO DO IS STRENGTHEN THE  
LINES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN  
THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS    

01:46:18.443 --> 01:46:19.108
LINES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN  
THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS    
AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SO

CRASH THAT&amp;apos;S RESULTING IN       
SERIOUS INJURY OR FATALITY THAT 

01:46:26.083 --> 01:46:27.015
CRASH THAT&amp;apos;S RESULTING IN       
SERIOUS INJURY OR FATALITY THAT 
WE HAVE SORT OF A COORDINATED

SERIOUS INJURY OR FATALITY THAT 
WE HAVE SORT OF A COORDINATED   
RESPONSE.

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.023
RESPONSE.                       
SO OBVIOUSLY THE POLICE         
DEPARTMENT HAS A REGIMENT SORT  

01:46:34.025 --> 01:46:34.890
SO OBVIOUSLY THE POLICE         
DEPARTMENT HAS A REGIMENT SORT  
OF CRASH ANALYSIS THAT THEY     

01:46:34.892 --> 01:46:37.893
DEPARTMENT HAS A REGIMENT SORT  
OF CRASH ANALYSIS THAT THEY     
PERFORM.                        

01:46:37.895 --> 01:46:38.961
OF CRASH ANALYSIS THAT THEY     
PERFORM.                        
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT  

01:46:38.963 --> 01:46:39.895
PERFORM.                        
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT  
TO TRY TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE    

01:46:39.897 --> 01:46:42.631
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT  
TO TRY TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE    
THAT IF A CRASH OCCURS TO DO A  

01:46:42.633 --> 01:46:46.268
TO TRY TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE    
THAT IF A CRASH OCCURS TO DO A  
SCAN OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE.     

01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.502
THAT IF A CRASH OCCURS TO DO A  
SCAN OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE.     
RIGHT.                          

01:46:46.504 --> 01:46:47.703
SCAN OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE.     
RIGHT.                          
SO YOU KNOW, IS THE SIGNAGE IN  

01:46:47.705 --> 01:46:48.470
RIGHT.                          
SO YOU KNOW, IS THE SIGNAGE IN  
PLACE, THE STREET LIGHTS        

01:46:48.472 --> 01:46:50.406
SO YOU KNOW, IS THE SIGNAGE IN  
PLACE, THE STREET LIGHTS        
WORKING PAVEMENT MARKINGS CLEAR 

01:46:50.408 --> 01:46:51.306
PLACE, THE STREET LIGHTS        
WORKING PAVEMENT MARKINGS CLEAR 
THAT SORT OF THING AND IF IT&amp;apos;S  

01:46:51.308 --> 01:46:54.777
WORKING PAVEMENT MARKINGS CLEAR 
THAT SORT OF THING AND IF IT&amp;apos;S  
NOT, YOU KNOW, REMEDY THOSE AS  

01:46:54.779 --> 01:46:57.946
THAT SORT OF THING AND IF IT&amp;apos;S  
NOT, YOU KNOW, REMEDY THOSE AS  
SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.       

01:46:57.948 --> 01:46:59.248
NOT, YOU KNOW, REMEDY THOSE AS  
SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.       
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF THE   

01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:02.150
SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.       
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF THE   
SOLUTION.                       

01:47:02.152 --> 01:47:03.285
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF THE   
SOLUTION.                       
SIT THERE AND THEN I THINK TO   

01:47:03.287 --> 01:47:05.821
SOLUTION.                       
SIT THERE AND THEN I THINK TO   
THE POINT THAT CYNTHIA IS       

01:47:05.823 --> 01:47:06.655
SIT THERE AND THEN I THINK TO   
THE POINT THAT CYNTHIA IS       
BRINGING UP IS YOU KNOW, YOU&amp;apos;RE 

01:47:06.657 --> 01:47:10.125
THE POINT THAT CYNTHIA IS       
BRINGING UP IS YOU KNOW, YOU&amp;apos;RE 
RIGHT THE EVERY FATALITY, EVERY 

01:47:10.127 --> 01:47:10.926
BRINGING UP IS YOU KNOW, YOU&amp;apos;RE 
RIGHT THE EVERY FATALITY, EVERY 
SERIOUS INJURY SHOULD BE TAKEN  

01:47:10.928 --> 01:47:11.259
RIGHT THE EVERY FATALITY, EVERY 
SERIOUS INJURY SHOULD BE TAKEN  
SERIOUSLY.                      

01:47:11.261 --> 01:47:11.593
SERIOUS INJURY SHOULD BE TAKEN  
SERIOUSLY.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       

01:47:11.595 --> 01:47:13.762
SERIOUSLY.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT   

01:47:13.764 --> 01:47:14.397
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT   
WE DON&amp;apos;T GLOSS OVER YOU KNOW,   

01:47:14.399 --> 01:47:17.465
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT   
WE DON&amp;apos;T GLOSS OVER YOU KNOW,   
THESE ARE HUMAN LIVES WE&amp;apos;RE     

01:47:17.467 --> 01:47:18.199
WE DON&amp;apos;T GLOSS OVER YOU KNOW,   
THESE ARE HUMAN LIVES WE&amp;apos;RE     
TALKING ABOUT AND WE WANT TO    

01:47:18.201 --> 01:47:21.069
THESE ARE HUMAN LIVES WE&amp;apos;RE     
TALKING ABOUT AND WE WANT TO    
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE    

01:47:21.071 --> 01:47:21.437
TALKING ABOUT AND WE WANT TO    
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE    
ROOT CAUSE.                     

01:47:21.439 --> 01:47:24.439
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE    
ROOT CAUSE.                     
I WILL NOTE THAT SOMETIMES AND  

01:47:24.441 --> 01:47:25.174
ROOT CAUSE.                     
I WILL NOTE THAT SOMETIMES AND  
AGAIN LIEUTENANT SCHERBA CAN    

01:47:25.176 --> 01:47:25.841
I WILL NOTE THAT SOMETIMES AND  
AGAIN LIEUTENANT SCHERBA CAN    
CAN HOPEFULLY BACK ME UP ON     

01:47:25.843 --> 01:47:28.443
AGAIN LIEUTENANT SCHERBA CAN    
CAN HOPEFULLY BACK ME UP ON     
THIS SOMETIMES THEY ARE         

01:47:28.445 --> 01:47:28.977
CAN HOPEFULLY BACK ME UP ON     
THIS SOMETIMES THEY ARE         
BEHAVIORAL, RIGHT?              

01:47:28.979 --> 01:47:32.113
THIS SOMETIMES THEY ARE         
BEHAVIORAL, RIGHT?              
IN SOME INSTANCES IT&amp;apos;S IMPAIRED 

01:47:32.115 --> 01:47:32.881
BEHAVIORAL, RIGHT?              
IN SOME INSTANCES IT&amp;apos;S IMPAIRED 
DRIVING AS WE TALKED ABOUT      

01:47:32.883 --> 01:47:35.217
IN SOME INSTANCES IT&amp;apos;S IMPAIRED 
DRIVING AS WE TALKED ABOUT      
EARLIER IN THE MEETING.         

01:47:35.219 --> 01:47:39.254
DRIVING AS WE TALKED ABOUT      
EARLIER IN THE MEETING.         
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE 

01:47:39.256 --> 01:47:39.988
EARLIER IN THE MEETING.         
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE 
BEHAVIORAL THINGS, THERE ARE    

01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.722
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE 
BEHAVIORAL THINGS, THERE ARE    
STILL THOSE CUES FROM THE       

01:47:40.724 --> 01:47:43.792
BEHAVIORAL THINGS, THERE ARE    
STILL THOSE CUES FROM THE       
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH AGAIN GO   

01:47:43.794 --> 01:47:44.660
STILL THOSE CUES FROM THE       
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH AGAIN GO   
BACK TO THIS IDEA OF A SYSTEM   

01:47:44.662 --> 01:47:47.963
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH AGAIN GO   
BACK TO THIS IDEA OF A SYSTEM   
APPROACH TO WHAT ARE THE THINGS 

01:47:47.965 --> 01:47:48.863
BACK TO THIS IDEA OF A SYSTEM   
APPROACH TO WHAT ARE THE THINGS 
THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE     

01:47:48.865 --> 01:47:50.966
APPROACH TO WHAT ARE THE THINGS 
THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE     
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE DRIVING DOWN SPEEDS  

01:47:50.968 --> 01:47:51.633
THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE     
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE DRIVING DOWN SPEEDS  
AT A SYSTEM LEVEL.              

01:47:51.635 --> 01:47:53.969
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE DRIVING DOWN SPEEDS  
AT A SYSTEM LEVEL.              
SO WHILE THERE MAY HAVE NOT     

01:47:53.971 --> 01:47:54.636
AT A SYSTEM LEVEL.              
SO WHILE THERE MAY HAVE NOT     
BEEN AN INFRASTRUCTURE          

01:47:54.638 --> 01:47:55.270
SO WHILE THERE MAY HAVE NOT     
BEEN AN INFRASTRUCTURE          
DEFICIENCY AT THAT EXACT        

01:47:55.272 --> 01:47:59.374
BEEN AN INFRASTRUCTURE          
DEFICIENCY AT THAT EXACT        
LOCATION, WHEN WE PULL UP ONE   

01:47:59.376 --> 01:48:00.075
DEFICIENCY AT THAT EXACT        
LOCATION, WHEN WE PULL UP ONE   
OF THE SORT OF SYSTEM WIDE      

01:48:00.077 --> 01:48:02.478
LOCATION, WHEN WE PULL UP ONE   
OF THE SORT OF SYSTEM WIDE      
IMPROVEMENTS WE&amp;apos;RE MAKING TO    

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.278
OF THE SORT OF SYSTEM WIDE      
IMPROVEMENTS WE&amp;apos;RE MAKING TO    
ENSURE THAT WE MINIMIZE THE     

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.447
IMPROVEMENTS WE&amp;apos;RE MAKING TO    
ENSURE THAT WE MINIMIZE THE     
SEVERITY OF THOSE CRASHES WHEN  

01:48:05.449 --> 01:48:06.014
ENSURE THAT WE MINIMIZE THE     
SEVERITY OF THOSE CRASHES WHEN  
THEY DO OCCUR.                  

01:48:06.016 --> 01:48:09.551
SEVERITY OF THOSE CRASHES WHEN  
THEY DO OCCUR.                  
SO IT IS SOMETHING WHERE WE&amp;apos;RE  

01:48:09.553 --> 01:48:10.386
THEY DO OCCUR.                  
SO IT IS SOMETHING WHERE WE&amp;apos;RE  
THINKING ABOUT IT IS SOME       

01:48:10.388 --> 01:48:11.120
SO IT IS SOMETHING WHERE WE&amp;apos;RE  
THINKING ABOUT IT IS SOME       
OF THE THINGS THAT WE&amp;apos;RE        

01:48:11.122 --> 01:48:13.922
THINKING ABOUT IT IS SOME       
OF THE THINGS THAT WE&amp;apos;RE        
FEEDING INTO THE WORK THAT      

01:48:13.924 --> 01:48:14.456
OF THE THINGS THAT WE&amp;apos;RE        
FEEDING INTO THE WORK THAT

IN ABOUT THE VISION ZERO STUFF. 
IT&amp;apos;S REALLY EXCITING TO SEE     

02:00:35.798 --> 02:00:36.431
IN ABOUT THE VISION ZERO STUFF. 
IT&amp;apos;S REALLY EXCITING TO SEE     
THIS MAJOR STREETS CALL MAIN    

02:00:36.433 --> 02:00:39.834
IT&amp;apos;S REALLY EXCITING TO SEE     
THIS MAJOR STREETS CALL MAIN    
THING COMING TOGETHER.          

02:00:39.836 --> 02:00:41.102
THIS MAJOR STREETS CALL MAIN    
THING COMING TOGETHER.          
ONE THING THAT WE DISCUSSED AT  

02:00:41.104 --> 02:00:47.075
THING COMING TOGETHER.          
ONE THING THAT WE DISCUSSED AT  
THE                             

02:01:00.923 --> 02:01:03.658
    VISION ZERO MEETING IS THAT 
THE IN TERMS OF BEING DATA      
DRIVEN WE&amp;apos;VE GOT CRASH DATA AND 

02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:04.659
THE IN TERMS OF BEING DATA      
DRIVEN WE&amp;apos;VE GOT CRASH DATA AND 
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT SOME DATA ABOUT THE   

02:01:04.661 --> 02:01:05.326
DRIVEN WE&amp;apos;VE GOT CRASH DATA AND 
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT SOME DATA ABOUT THE   
AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC ON THE        

02:01:05.328 --> 02:01:05.994
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT SOME DATA ABOUT THE   
AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC ON THE        
STREETS BUT WE DON&amp;apos;T ACTUALLY   

02:01:05.996 --> 02:01:06.728
AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC ON THE        
STREETS BUT WE DON&amp;apos;T ACTUALLY   
HAVE SYSTEMATIC SPEED DATA AND  

02:01:06.730 --> 02:01:07.595
STREETS BUT WE DON&amp;apos;T ACTUALLY   
HAVE SYSTEMATIC SPEED DATA AND  
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT     

02:01:07.597 --> 02:01:08.329
HAVE SYSTEMATIC SPEED DATA AND  
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT     
WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO HAVE    

02:01:08.331 --> 02:01:09.230
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT     
WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO HAVE    
BOTH IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING   

02:01:09.232 --> 02:01:09.798
WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO HAVE    
BOTH IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING   
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF MEASURING  

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:10.598
BOTH IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING   
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF MEASURING  
PROGRESS WHEN WE WHEN WE MAKE A 

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:11.333
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF MEASURING  
PROGRESS WHEN WE WHEN WE MAKE A 
CHANGE TO SEE HOW IT&amp;apos;S HELPED.  

02:01:11.335 --> 02:01:12.400
PROGRESS WHEN WE WHEN WE MAKE A 
CHANGE TO SEE HOW IT&amp;apos;S HELPED.  
AND SO I WONDER IF THAT&amp;apos;S       

02:01:12.402 --> 02:01:15.002
CHANGE TO SEE HOW IT&amp;apos;S HELPED.  
AND SO I WONDER IF THAT&amp;apos;S       
SOMETHING WE COULD MAYBE        

02:01:15.004 --> 02:01:18.706
AND SO I WONDER IF THAT&amp;apos;S       
SOMETHING WE COULD MAYBE        
DISCUSS AS A COMMISSION OR      

02:01:18.708 --> 02:01:21.542
SOMETHING WE COULD MAYBE        
DISCUSS AS A COMMISSION OR      
MAYBE ASK STAFF TO MAKE A       

02:01:21.544 --> 02:01:22.343

MAYBE ASK STAFF TO MAKE A       
PRESENTATION ABOUT WAYS THAT WE 

02:01:22.345 --> 02:01:25.446
MAYBE ASK STAFF TO MAKE A       
PRESENTATION ABOUT WAYS THAT WE 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER         

02:01:25.448 --> 02:01:28.482
PRESENTATION ABOUT WAYS THAT WE 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER         
SYSTEMATIC SPEED DATA THAT IT   

02:01:28.484 --> 02:01:33.554
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER         
SYSTEMATIC SPEED DATA THAT IT   
REALLY FEELS LIKE A GAP TO ME.  

02:01:33.556 --> 02:01:36.791
SYSTEMATIC SPEED DATA THAT IT   
REALLY FEELS LIKE A GAP TO ME.  
THAT&amp;apos;S A GREAT POINT.           

02:01:36.793 --> 02:01:40.528
REALLY FEELS LIKE A GAP TO ME.

SO WE&amp;apos;VE GOT CAR TRAFFIC BUT I  

02:01:41.931 --> 02:01:44.598
NEED.                           
SO WE&amp;apos;VE GOT CAR TRAFFIC BUT I  
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT   

02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:45.199
SO WE&amp;apos;VE GOT CAR TRAFFIC BUT I  
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT   
OF SYSTEMATIC BIKE OR
