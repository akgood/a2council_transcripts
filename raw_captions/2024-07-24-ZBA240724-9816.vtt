01:17:27.174 --> 01:17:31.009
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE HOW MUCH    
ADDED PERMEABLE GROUND ADDING   
TO THE SITE IF ANY JUST         

01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:31.343
ADDED PERMEABLE GROUND ADDING   
TO THE SITE IF ANY JUST         
BALLPARK?                       

01:17:31.345 --> 01:17:34.079
TO THE SITE IF ANY JUST         
BALLPARK?                       
YEAH, I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER  

01:17:34.081 --> 01:17:35.113
BALLPARK?                       
YEAH, I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER  
CURRENTLY BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT  

01:17:35.115 --> 01:17:38.517
YEAH, I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER  
CURRENTLY BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT  
STORMWATER FOR A MINUTE.        

01:17:38.519 --> 01:17:39.718
CURRENTLY BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT  
STORMWATER FOR A MINUTE.        
BUT TWO EXISTING PONDS, THE ONE 

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.652
STORMWATER FOR A MINUTE.        
BUT TWO EXISTING PONDS, THE ONE 
ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ONE    

01:17:40.654 --> 01:17:42.454
BUT TWO EXISTING PONDS, THE ONE 
ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ONE    
OF THE SOUTH THE CORNER         

01:17:42.456 --> 01:17:43.255
ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ONE    
OF THE SOUTH THE CORNER         
BOARDWALK AND EISENHAUER WILL   

01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:43.922
OF THE SOUTH THE CORNER         
BOARDWALK AND EISENHAUER WILL   
REMAIN AND THEN WE ARE PLACING  

01:17:43.924 --> 01:17:46.725
BOARDWALK AND EISENHAUER WILL   
REMAIN AND THEN WE ARE PLACING  
A PORTION OF OUR STORMWATER     

01:17:46.727 --> 01:17:49.295
REMAIN AND THEN WE ARE PLACING  
A PORTION OF OUR STORMWATER     
MANAGEMENT UNDERGROUND BECAUSE  

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:53.566
A PORTION OF OUR STORMWATER     
MANAGEMENT UNDERGROUND BECAUSE  
THE SITE BECAUSE WE'RE          

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:54.366
MANAGEMENT UNDERGROUND BECAUSE  
THE SITE BECAUSE WE'RE          
IMPACTING MORE THAN 50 PERCENT  

01:17:54.368 --> 01:17:57.469
THE SITE BECAUSE WE'RE          
IMPACTING MORE THAN 50 PERCENT  
OF THE SITE WITH A NEW          

01:17:57.471 --> 01:17:58.236
IMPACTING MORE THAN 50 PERCENT  
OF THE SITE WITH A NEW          
DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW   

01:17:58.238 --> 01:17:59.004
OF THE SITE WITH A NEW          
DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW   
THE CURRENT STORMWATER STANDARD 

01:17:59.006 --> 01:18:02.007
DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW   
THE CURRENT STORMWATER STANDARD 
SO THERE WASN'T A COMPARISON IN 

01:18:02.009 --> 01:18:05.010
THE CURRENT STORMWATER STANDARD 
SO THERE WASN'T A COMPARISON IN 
OUR CALCULATIONS FOR STORMWATER 

01:18:05.012 --> 01:18:05.811
SO THERE WASN'T A COMPARISON IN 
OUR CALCULATIONS FOR STORMWATER 
COMPARE IMPERVIOUS TO NEW       

01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:06.679
OUR CALCULATIONS FOR STORMWATER 
COMPARE IMPERVIOUS TO NEW       
IMPERVIOUS SO I DON'T HAVE THAT 

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:09.715
COMPARE IMPERVIOUS TO NEW       
IMPERVIOUS SO I DON'T HAVE THAT 
NUMBER BUT WE ARE ACCOUNTING    

01:18:09.717 --> 01:18:12.585
IMPERVIOUS SO I DON'T HAVE THAT 
NUMBER BUT WE ARE ACCOUNTING    
FOR THE STORMWATER THAT THAT WE 

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:13.385
NUMBER BUT WE ARE ACCOUNTING    
FOR THE STORMWATER THAT THAT WE 
WILL WE'RE COUNTING FOR THE     

01:18:13.387 --> 01:18:17.055
FOR THE STORMWATER THAT THAT WE 
WILL WE'RE COUNTING FOR THE     
STORMWATER FROM THE EXISTING    

01:18:17.057 --> 01:18:20.292
WILL WE'RE COUNTING FOR THE     
STORMWATER FROM THE EXISTING    
SITE AND THEN WE'RE ACCOUNTING  

01:18:20.294 --> 01:18:21.293
STORMWATER FROM THE EXISTING    
SITE AND THEN WE'RE ACCOUNTING  
FOR THE STORM WATER FROM THE    

01:18:21.295 --> 01:18:24.430
SITE AND THEN WE'RE ACCOUNTING  
FOR THE STORM WATER FROM THE    
NEW I CAN'T CALL IMPERVIOUS     

01:18:24.432 --> 01:18:25.397
FOR THE STORM WATER FROM THE    
NEW I CAN'T CALL IMPERVIOUS     
SURFACE OF SOME OF IT'S NEW BUT 

01:18:25.399 --> 01:18:25.965
NEW I CAN'T CALL IMPERVIOUS     
SURFACE OF SOME OF IT'S NEW BUT 
FOR THE WHOLE SITE.             

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:28.567
SURFACE OF SOME OF IT'S NEW BUT 
FOR THE WHOLE SITE.             
SO WE'RE BRINGING THAT INTO     

01:18:28.569 --> 01:18:29.335
FOR THE WHOLE SITE.             
SO WE'RE BRINGING THAT INTO     
CONFORMANCE SO THERE'S A LOT    

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.202
SO WE'RE BRINGING THAT INTO     
CONFORMANCE SO THERE'S A LOT    
MORE VOLUME OF WATER THAT WE'RE 

01:18:30.204 --> 01:18:32.938
CONFORMANCE SO THERE'S A LOT    
MORE VOLUME OF WATER THAT WE'RE 
TREATING AND THEN THERE'S ALSO  

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:36.341
MORE VOLUME OF WATER THAT WE'RE 
TREATING AND THEN THERE'S ALSO  
WE'RE TREATING THE VOLUME THAT  

01:18:36.343 --> 01:18:37.142
TREATING AND THEN THERE'S ALSO  
WE'RE TREATING THE VOLUME THAT  
WE'RE TREATING THE QUALITY BY   

01:18:37.144 --> 01:18:40.645
WE'RE TREATING THE VOLUME THAT  
WE'RE TREATING THE QUALITY BY   
HELPING TO REMOVE EROSION       

01:18:40.647 --> 01:18:43.649
WE'RE TREATING THE QUALITY BY   
HELPING TO REMOVE EROSION       
PARTICULATES THAT KIND.         

01:18:43.651 --> 01:18:44.916
HELPING TO REMOVE EROSION       
PARTICULATES THAT KIND.         
SO MY MY SENSE LOOKING AT THIS  

01:18:44.918 --> 01:18:49.087
PARTICULATES THAT KIND.         
SO MY MY SENSE LOOKING AT THIS  
SCHEMATIC IS IS IT WRONG THAT   

01:18:49.089 --> 01:18:52.757
SO MY MY SENSE LOOKING AT THIS  
SCHEMATIC IS IS IT WRONG THAT   
YOU'RE ADDING MORE OR MORE      

01:18:52.759 --> 01:18:55.594
SCHEMATIC IS IS IT WRONG THAT   
YOU'RE ADDING MORE OR MORE      
PERMEABLE OPEN GROUND?          

01:18:55.596 --> 01:18:56.495
YOU'RE ADDING MORE OR MORE      
PERMEABLE OPEN GROUND?          
>> IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE NOT.     

01:18:56.497 --> 01:19:00.232
PERMEABLE OPEN GROUND?          
>> IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE NOT.     
I WOULD I WOULD THINK IT'S VERY 

01:19:00.234 --> 01:19:00.566

I WOULD I WOULD THINK IT'S VERY 
CLOSE.

I WOULD I WOULD THINK IT'S VERY 
CLOSE.                          
>> AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION  

01:19:03.303 --> 01:19:07.339
CLOSE.                          
>> AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION  
AGAIN, I'M I'M NOT RAISING      

01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:08.273
>> AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION  
AGAIN, I'M I'M NOT RAISING      
THESE QUESTIONS IN ANY WAY      

01:19:08.275 --> 01:19:11.210
AGAIN, I'M I'M NOT RAISING      
THESE QUESTIONS IN ANY WAY      
OF TRYING TO PRESENT OBSTACLES

HAS PUDI ZONING PROCESS AND YOU 
COULD JUST CREATE A SITE PLAN A 
ZONE THE PD UNIT WAS THERE ANY  

01:19:42.576 --> 01:19:43.342
COULD JUST CREATE A SITE PLAN A

TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO 

01:19:57.658 --> 01:19:58.323
CONSIDERING FOR SOME TIME AND   
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO 
WITH THE MASSIVE SURFACE        

01:19:58.325 --> 01:19:59.057
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO 
WITH THE MASSIVE SURFACE        
PARKING LOTS AND HOW TO         

01:19:59.059 --> 01:20:01.993
WITH THE MASSIVE SURFACE

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.798
VIBRANCY TO THE SITE BEYOND     
JUST OFFICE BUILDINGS.          
SO IF THEY CONSIDERED THAT      

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.268
JUST OFFICE BUILDINGS.          
SO IF THEY CONSIDERED THAT

PARTICULAR THAT BEING SOME      
OF IT.                          
WE ALSO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT      

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:32.404
OF IT.                          
WE ALSO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT      
BUILDING                        

01:23:46.252 --> 01:23:49.054
         A ONE AND D ONE, WE    
HAD SOME THOUGHTS.              
SO BUILDING D ONE BOARDWALK SO

HAD SOME THOUGHTS.              
SO BUILDING D ONE BOARDWALK SO  
BUILDING THESE ONES AT THE      

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:50.789
SO BUILDING D ONE BOARDWALK SO  
BUILDING THESE ONES AT THE      
NORTHEAST CORNER SORT OF SO     

01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:51.656
BUILDING THESE ONES AT THE      
NORTHEAST CORNER SORT OF SO     
ACROSS THE SITE FROM NORTH TO   

01:23:51.658 --> 01:23:52.457
NORTHEAST CORNER SORT OF SO     
ACROSS THE SITE FROM NORTH TO   
SOUTH WE HAVE OVER THIRTY FEET  

01:23:52.459 --> 01:23:53.158
ACROSS THE SITE FROM NORTH TO   
SOUTH WE HAVE OVER THIRTY FEET  
OF OIL ACTUALLY AND AS WE GO    

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:53.892
SOUTH WE HAVE OVER THIRTY FEET  
OF OIL ACTUALLY AND AS WE GO    
ACROSS OUR NORTHERN ACCESS ROAD 

01:23:53.894 --> 01:23:54.692
OF OIL ACTUALLY AND AS WE GO    
ACROSS OUR NORTHERN ACCESS ROAD 
FROM BOARDWALK TO STATE STREET  

01:23:54.694 --> 01:23:55.360
ACROSS OUR NORTHERN ACCESS ROAD 
FROM BOARDWALK TO STATE STREET  
JUST ACROSS BUILDING D ONE WE   

01:23:55.362 --> 01:23:56.161
FROM BOARDWALK TO STATE STREET  
JUST ACROSS BUILDING D ONE WE   
HAVE 10 TO 14 FEET OF GREAT     

01:23:56.163 --> 01:23:56.428
JUST ACROSS BUILDING D ONE WE   
HAVE 10 TO 14 FEET OF GREAT     
CHANGE.

BOARDWALK WE HAVE TO HAVE       
ENTRANCES ON OUR ACCESS DRIVE   

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:07.339
BOARDWALK WE HAVE TO HAVE       
ENTRANCES ON OUR ACCESS DRIVE   
AND THEN WE'RE CREATING THIS    

01:24:07.341 --> 01:24:08.140
ENTRANCES ON OUR ACCESS DRIVE   
AND THEN WE'RE CREATING THIS    
PUBLIC PLAZA OR A COURTYARD     

01:24:08.142 --> 01:24:12.010
AND THEN WE'RE CREATING THIS    
PUBLIC PLAZA OR A COURTYARD     
THAT COMES UP AND SO YOU'LL BE

HERE AND AS YOU WALK THROUGH    
THAT COURTYARD YOU'D BE ABLE TO 
ENTER AT A DIFFERENT ELEVATION  

01:24:16.917 --> 01:24:18.784
THAT COURTYARD YOU'D BE ABLE TO 
ENTER AT A DIFFERENT ELEVATION  
BECAUSE WE'RE CHANGING THAT     

01:24:18.786 --> 01:24:19.117
ENTER AT A DIFFERENT ELEVATION  
BECAUSE WE'RE CHANGING THAT     
GRADE.

AND WHERE THE EXISTING BUILDING 
IS WE'RE TRYING TO BREAK THAT   
LAND AREA UP INTO A COUPLE      

01:24:38.472 --> 01:24:41.739
IS WE'RE TRYING TO BREAK THAT   
LAND AREA UP INTO A COUPLE      
OF BLOCKS AND AS FAR AS THE     

01:24:41.741 --> 01:24:42.440
LAND AREA UP INTO A COUPLE      
OF BLOCKS AND AS FAR AS THE     
NORTH-SOUTH DIMENSION GOES, WE  

01:24:42.442 --> 01:24:45.911
OF BLOCKS AND AS FAR AS THE     
NORTH-SOUTH DIMENSION GOES, WE  
WERE LOOKING AT CREATING A ONE  

01:24:45.913 --> 01:24:46.778
NORTH-SOUTH DIMENSION GOES, WE  
WERE LOOKING AT CREATING A ONE  
OF THE THINGS WE HEARD AT THE   

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.446
WERE LOOKING AT CREATING A ONE  
OF THE THINGS WE HEARD AT THE   
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETINGS  

01:24:47.448 --> 01:24:49.982
OF THE THINGS WE HEARD AT THE   
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETINGS  
WAS CROSSING EISENHAUER ALONG   

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:53.552
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETINGS  
WAS CROSSING EISENHAUER ALONG   
STATE STREET WAS DIFFICULT AND  

01:24:53.554 --> 01:24:54.553
WAS CROSSING EISENHAUER ALONG   
STATE STREET WAS DIFFICULT AND  
WE WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING   

01:24:54.555 --> 01:24:57.823
STATE STREET WAS DIFFICULT AND  
WE WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING   
COMFORTING AND KIND OF A        

01:24:57.825 --> 01:24:58.623
WE WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING   
COMFORTING AND KIND OF A        
PEDESTRIAN PLAZA AREA THERE AT  

01:24:58.625 --> 01:24:59.023
COMFORTING AND KIND OF A        
PEDESTRIAN PLAZA AREA THERE AT  
THE CORNER.                     

01:24:59.025 --> 01:25:00.559
PEDESTRIAN PLAZA AREA THERE AT  
THE CORNER.                     
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT     

01:25:00.561 --> 01:25:01.359
THE CORNER.                     
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT     
INTERSECTION, EACH OF THE       

01:25:01.361 --> 01:25:04.762
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT     
INTERSECTION, EACH OF THE       
CORNERS IS KIND OF SET BACK.    

01:25:04.764 --> 01:25:05.997
INTERSECTION, EACH OF THE       
CORNERS IS KIND OF SET BACK.    
WE HAVE KIND OF A POND AND A    

01:25:05.999 --> 01:25:08.766
CORNERS IS KIND OF SET BACK.    
WE HAVE KIND OF A POND AND A    
FOUNTAIN, A BRICK WALL AND THEN 

01:25:08.768 --> 01:25:09.535
WE HAVE KIND OF A POND AND A    
FOUNTAIN, A BRICK WALL AND THEN 
THE BUILDING TO THE SOUTH HAS   

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:12.570
FOUNTAIN, A BRICK WALL AND THEN 
THE BUILDING TO THE SOUTH HAS   
OPEN SPACE AND THEN THE CORNER  

01:25:12.572 --> 01:25:13.639
THE BUILDING TO THE SOUTH HAS   
OPEN SPACE AND THEN THE CORNER  
BY THE MALL IS ALSO SET BACK.   

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:16.308
OPEN SPACE AND THEN THE CORNER  
BY THE MALL IS ALSO SET BACK.   
>> SO WHEN REZONING HAPPENS AND 

01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:17.108
BY THE MALL IS ALSO SET BACK.   
>> SO WHEN REZONING HAPPENS AND 
WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT PUTS    

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:21.313
>> SO WHEN REZONING HAPPENS AND 
WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT PUTS    
DIFFERENT MASSES, IT CAN FEEL   

01:25:21.315 --> 01:25:21.713
WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT PUTS    
DIFFERENT MASSES, IT CAN FEEL   
ON BALANCE.                     

01:25:21.715 --> 01:25:24.549
DIFFERENT MASSES, IT CAN FEEL   
ON BALANCE.                     
SO IF WE'RE PUTTING ALL THE     

01:25:24.551 --> 01:25:25.417
ON BALANCE.                     
SO IF WE'RE PUTTING ALL THE     
BUILDINGS UP TO THAT CORNER AND 

01:25:25.419 --> 01:25:27.919
SO IF WE'RE PUTTING ALL THE     
BUILDINGS UP TO THAT CORNER AND 
HUGGING THE CORNER LIKE THE     

01:25:27.921 --> 01:25:28.820
BUILDINGS UP TO THAT CORNER AND 
HUGGING THE CORNER LIKE THE     
CODE WANTS US, THAT'S GOING TO  

01:25:28.822 --> 01:25:29.621
HUGGING THE CORNER LIKE THE     
CODE WANTS US, THAT'S GOING TO  
LOOK ODD FOR A WHILE UNTIL      

01:25:29.623 --> 01:25:32.090
CODE WANTS US, THAT'S GOING TO  
LOOK ODD FOR A WHILE UNTIL      
OTHER PARCELS REDEVELOP.        

01:25:32.092 --> 01:25:33.058
LOOK ODD FOR A WHILE UNTIL      
OTHER PARCELS REDEVELOP.        
SO WE WERE THOUGHTFUL OF THE    

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:36.128
OTHER PARCELS REDEVELOP.        
SO WE WERE THOUGHTFUL OF THE    
DESIGNERS WERE THOUGHTFUL TO    

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:36.861
SO WE WERE THOUGHTFUL OF THE    
DESIGNERS WERE THOUGHTFUL TO    
PUSH THAT BUILDING BACK AND     

01:25:36.863 --> 01:25:39.998
DESIGNERS WERE THOUGHTFUL TO    
PUSH THAT BUILDING BACK AND     
CREATE THAT PUBLIC SPACE AND    

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:40.732
PUSH THAT BUILDING BACK AND     
CREATE THAT PUBLIC SPACE AND    
THEN WE DON'T EFFICIENTLY OR    

01:25:40.734 --> 01:25:43.167
CREATE THAT PUBLIC SPACE AND    
THEN WE DON'T EFFICIENTLY OR    
EFFECTIVELY HAVE ROOM TO BREAK  

01:25:43.169 --> 01:25:43.769
THEN WE DON'T EFFICIENTLY OR    
EFFECTIVELY HAVE ROOM TO BREAK  
THAT UP INTO BLOCKS.            

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:44.369
EFFECTIVELY HAVE ROOM TO BREAK  
THAT UP INTO BLOCKS.            
WE DON'T HAVE CURB CUTS         

01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:44.836
THAT UP INTO BLOCKS.            
WE DON'T HAVE CURB CUTS         
AVAILABLE.                      

01:25:44.838 --> 01:25:47.438
WE DON'T HAVE CURB CUTS         
AVAILABLE.                      
SO YOU END UP WITH AN AREA THAT 

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.139
AVAILABLE.                      
SO YOU END UP WITH AN AREA THAT 
REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT LONGER    

01:25:48.141 --> 01:25:51.276
SO YOU END UP WITH AN AREA THAT 
REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT LONGER    
BUILDING ACCORDING CITY STAFF   

01:25:51.278 --> 01:25:52.210
REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT LONGER    
BUILDING ACCORDING CITY STAFF   
PERSON THE LEXUS AND THE YOU    

01:25:52.212 --> 01:25:55.614
BUILDING ACCORDING CITY STAFF   
PERSON THE LEXUS AND THE YOU    
HAD TO HAVE A BUILDING LESS     

01:25:55.616 --> 01:25:58.916
PERSON THE LEXUS AND THE YOU    
HAD TO HAVE A BUILDING LESS     
THAN TWO FIFTY BUT NOW THE CITY 

01:25:58.918 --> 01:25:59.851
HAD TO HAVE A BUILDING LESS     
THAN TWO FIFTY BUT NOW THE CITY 
IS SAYING YOU COULD HAVE ONE    

01:25:59.853 --> 01:26:00.519
THAN TWO FIFTY BUT NOW THE CITY 
IS SAYING YOU COULD HAVE ONE    
MAYBE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED   

01:26:00.521 --> 01:26:02.920
IS SAYING YOU COULD HAVE ONE    
MAYBE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED   
AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR TWO       

01:26:02.922 --> 01:26:03.789
MAYBE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED   
AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR TWO       
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX FEET.   

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:06.024
AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR TWO       
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX FEET.   
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S        

01:26:06.026 --> 01:26:06.958
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX FEET.   
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S        
VARIANCES OK WITH THE CITY OR   

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.628
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S        
VARIANCES OK WITH THE CITY OR   
WILL BE IS THE CITY ISN'T BEING 

01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:11.296
VARIANCES OK WITH THE CITY OR   
WILL BE IS THE CITY ISN'T BEING 
VERY HARD ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED 

01:26:11.298 --> 01:26:14.632
WILL BE IS THE CITY ISN'T BEING 
VERY HARD ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED 
AND FIFTY FEET SO I DO HAVE     

01:26:14.634 --> 01:26:15.466
VERY HARD ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED 
AND FIFTY FEET SO I DO HAVE     
WHAT IS SO THE FIRST TWO        

01:26:15.468 --> 01:26:18.336
AND FIFTY FEET SO I DO HAVE     
WHAT IS SO THE FIRST TWO        
VARIANCES CONCERNED BUILDING A1 

01:26:18.338 --> 01:26:22.106
WHAT IS SO THE FIRST TWO        
VARIANCES CONCERNED BUILDING A1 
AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE A       

01:26:22.108 --> 01:26:22.708
VARIANCES CONCERNED BUILDING A1 
AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE A       
PROBLEM WITH THOSE.             

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:23.642
AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE A       
PROBLEM WITH THOSE.             
I DO HAVE A QUESTION WITH A     

01:26:23.644 --> 01:26:25.444
PROBLEM WITH THOSE.             
I DO HAVE A QUESTION WITH A     
BUILDING C TO THE PARKING       

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:26.244
I DO HAVE A QUESTION WITH A     
BUILDING C TO THE PARKING       
STRUCTURE AND THAT HAD TO DO    

01:26:26.246 --> 01:26:29.581
BUILDING C TO THE PARKING       
STRUCTURE AND THAT HAD TO DO    
WITH THE THE MAXIMUM WIDTH IF   

01:26:29.583 --> 01:26:30.515
STRUCTURE AND THAT HAD TO DO    
WITH THE THE MAXIMUM WIDTH IF   
YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU WENT  

01:26:30.517 --> 01:26:33.985
WITH THE THE MAXIMUM WIDTH IF   
YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU WENT  
WITH WHAT THAT IS AS OPPOSED TO 

01:26:33.987 --> 01:26:34.719
YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU WENT  
WITH WHAT THAT IS AS OPPOSED TO 
A SMALLER WITH THREE WHY THE    

01:26:34.721 --> 01:26:37.022
WITH WHAT THAT IS AS OPPOSED TO 
A SMALLER WITH THREE WHY THE    
WHAT YOU WENT WITH WAS          

01:26:37.024 --> 01:26:37.422
A SMALLER WITH THREE WHY THE    
WHAT YOU WENT WITH WAS          
NECESSARY.                      

01:26:37.424 --> 01:26:37.822
WHAT YOU WENT WITH WAS          
NECESSARY.

NECESSARY.                      
>> YEP.                         
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPS 

01:26:38.892 --> 01:26:40.559
>> YEP.                         
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPS 
WITH THE WIDTH OF THAT BUILDING 

01:26:40.561 --> 01:26:44.429
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPS 
WITH THE WIDTH OF THAT BUILDING 
C TWO SO THAT IS BUILT SO THAT  

01:26:44.431 --> 01:26:44.930
WITH THE WIDTH OF THAT BUILDING 
C TWO SO THAT IS BUILT SO THAT
