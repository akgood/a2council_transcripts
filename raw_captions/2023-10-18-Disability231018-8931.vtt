01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:11.408
I UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT THERE  
ARE A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS     
WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON WITH   

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:12.976
ARE A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS     
WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON WITH   
TRANSPORTING.                   

01:05:12.978 --> 01:05:13.910
WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON WITH   
TRANSPORTING.                   
SO IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT      

01:05:13.912 --> 01:05:14.644
TRANSPORTING.                   
SO IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT      
COULD BE ADDRESSED I THINK THAT 

01:05:14.646 --> 01:05:17.347
SO IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT      
COULD BE ADDRESSED I THINK THAT 
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR A LOT   

01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.614
COULD BE ADDRESSED I THINK THAT 
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR A LOT   
OF US.                          

01:05:17.616 --> 01:05:18.548
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR A LOT   
OF US.                          
&gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT TYPE OF REALLY     

01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:18.882
OF US.                          
&gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT TYPE OF REALLY     
QUICK.                          

01:05:18.884 --> 01:05:21.451
&gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT TYPE OF REALLY     
QUICK.                          
COMMISSIONER CHAMBERS LIKE WHAT 

01:05:21.453 --> 01:05:22.085
QUICK.                          
COMMISSIONER CHAMBERS LIKE WHAT 
KIND WHAT KIND OF ADDITIONAL    

01:05:22.087 --> 01:05:25.055
COMMISSIONER CHAMBERS LIKE WHAT 
KIND WHAT KIND OF ADDITIONAL    
DIRECTIONS FOR THE DETAILS      

01:05:25.057 --> 01:05:25.589
KIND WHAT KIND OF ADDITIONAL    
DIRECTIONS FOR THE DETAILS      
WOULD BE HELPFUL.               

01:05:25.591 --> 01:05:29.525
DIRECTIONS FOR THE DETAILS      
WOULD BE HELPFUL.               
&gt;&gt; SO I THINK JUST A LITTLE BIT 

01:05:29.527 --> 01:05:30.293
WOULD BE HELPFUL.               
&gt;&gt; SO I THINK JUST A LITTLE BIT 
MORE SIGNAGE WITH REGARD TO THE 

01:05:30.295 --> 01:05:33.263
&gt;&gt; SO I THINK JUST A LITTLE BIT 
MORE SIGNAGE WITH REGARD TO THE 
ALTERNATE ROUTES WHEN THERE IS  

01:05:33.265 --> 01:05:34.031
MORE SIGNAGE WITH REGARD TO THE 
ALTERNATE ROUTES WHEN THERE IS  
A MAJOR STREET THAT IS CLOSED,  

01:05:34.033 --> 01:05:37.067
ALTERNATE ROUTES WHEN THERE IS  
A MAJOR STREET THAT IS CLOSED,  
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE 

01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:40.670
A MAJOR STREET THAT IS CLOSED,  
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
ONES THAT ARE FREQUENTLY USED   

01:05:40.672 --> 01:05:41.638
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
ONES THAT ARE FREQUENTLY USED   
AS SORT OF THE MAIN ROADS AND   

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.540
ONES THAT ARE FREQUENTLY USED   
AS SORT OF THE MAIN ROADS AND   
IN TOWN I JUST THINK THAT SOME  

01:05:44.542 --> 01:05:45.275
AS SORT OF THE MAIN ROADS AND   
IN TOWN I JUST THINK THAT SOME  
ADDITIONAL DIRECTION FOR THOSE  

01:05:45.277 --> 01:05:48.578
IN TOWN I JUST THINK THAT SOME  
ADDITIONAL DIRECTION FOR THOSE  
OF US I MEAN FOR MYSELF I DON&apos;T 

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.412
ADDITIONAL DIRECTION FOR THOSE  
OF US I MEAN FOR MYSELF I DON&apos;T 
HAVE A CLEAR MAP OF THE CITY IN 

01:05:49.414 --> 01:05:52.215
OF US I MEAN FOR MYSELF I DON&apos;T 
HAVE A CLEAR MAP OF THE CITY IN 
MY HEAD BECAUSE MY DISABILITY   

01:05:52.217 --> 01:05:53.016
HAVE A CLEAR MAP OF THE CITY IN 
MY HEAD BECAUSE MY DISABILITY   
REALLY PREVENTS ME FROM BEING   

01:05:53.018 --> 01:05:55.885
MY HEAD BECAUSE MY DISABILITY   
REALLY PREVENTS ME FROM BEING   
ABLE TO MAP OUT THOSE SPATIAL   

01:05:55.887 --> 01:05:56.186
REALLY PREVENTS ME FROM BEING   
ABLE TO MAP OUT THOSE SPATIAL   
DISTANCES.                      

01:05:56.188 --> 01:05:57.454
ABLE TO MAP OUT THOSE SPATIAL   
DISTANCES.                      
&gt;&gt; SO I THINK JUST A LITTLE BIT 

01:05:57.456 --> 01:05:59.355
DISTANCES.                      
&gt;&gt; SO I THINK JUST A LITTLE BIT 
THAT FORMALIZED SIGNAGE OR      

01:05:59.357 --> 01:06:02.826
&gt;&gt; SO I THINK JUST A LITTLE BIT 
THAT FORMALIZED SIGNAGE OR      
DIRECTION ON THE PART OF JUST   

01:06:02.828 --> 01:06:07.363
THAT FORMALIZED SIGNAGE OR      
DIRECTION ON THE PART OF JUST   
IN GENERAL I THINK COULD MAKE A 

01:06:07.365 --> 01:06:08.031
DIRECTION ON THE PART OF JUST   
IN GENERAL I THINK COULD MAKE A 
HUGE DIFFERENCE IF THAT&apos;S       

01:06:08.033 --> 01:06:10.833
IN GENERAL I THINK COULD MAKE A 
HUGE DIFFERENCE IF THAT&apos;S       
POSSIBLE.                       

01:06:10.835 --> 01:06:12.068
HUGE DIFFERENCE IF THAT&apos;S       
POSSIBLE.                       
&gt;&gt; OK, YEAH LARRY, IF YOU

THAT COMMISSIONER MOSAICA       
BROUGHT UP.                     
SO I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT THAT  

01:29:04.007 --> 01:29:06.608
BROUGHT UP.                     
SO I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT THAT  
WE HAVE YOU KNOW, AS MANY

SO I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT THAT  
WE HAVE YOU KNOW, AS MANY       
RESOURCES ORGANIZED AS POSSIBLE 

01:29:09.713 --> 01:29:10.579
WE HAVE YOU KNOW, AS MANY       
RESOURCES ORGANIZED AS POSSIBLE 
SO THAT IF INDIVIDUALS WITH     

01:29:10.581 --> 01:29:11.246
RESOURCES ORGANIZED AS POSSIBLE 
SO THAT IF INDIVIDUALS WITH     
DISABILITIES ARE LOOKING FOR    

01:29:11.248 --> 01:29:14.382
SO THAT IF INDIVIDUALS WITH     
DISABILITIES ARE LOOKING FOR    
DIFFERENT RESOURCES SUCH AS THE 

01:29:14.384 --> 01:29:17.785
DISABILITIES ARE LOOKING FOR    
DIFFERENT RESOURCES SUCH AS THE 
ONES THAT COMMISSIONER MOSADDEQ 

01:29:17.787 --> 01:29:18.719

01:29:21.891 --> 01:29:22.590
ACCESS TO IT.                   
BUT I ALSO THINK ON A LARGER    
SCALE POINT THAT&apos;S ALSO MOST    

01:29:22.592 --> 01:29:25.627
BUT I ALSO THINK ON A LARGER
