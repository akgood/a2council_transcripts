00:15:11.175 --> 00:15:11.940
THANK CHRIS.                    
>> SO IN THE INTERIM THERE WAS  
DISCUSSION ABOUT HEY, IN THE    

00:15:11.942 --> 00:15:15.010
>> SO IN THE INTERIM THERE WAS  
DISCUSSION ABOUT HEY, IN THE    
INTEREST OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS   

00:15:15.012 --> 00:15:18.447
DISCUSSION ABOUT HEY, IN THE    
INTEREST OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS   
OF TRANSPORTATION AND BECAUSE   

00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:19.281
INTEREST OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS   
OF TRANSPORTATION AND BECAUSE   
OF THE AMOUNT OF BUSSES THAT    

00:15:19.283 --> 00:15:20.049
OF TRANSPORTATION AND BECAUSE   
OF THE AMOUNT OF BUSSES THAT    
ARE USED THIS BOTH NORTHBOUND   

00:15:20.051 --> 00:15:22.185
OF THE AMOUNT OF BUSSES THAT    
ARE USED THIS BOTH NORTHBOUND   
AND SOUTHBOUND, WOULD IT MAKE   

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:23.118
ARE USED THIS BOTH NORTHBOUND   
AND SOUTHBOUND, WOULD IT MAKE   
SENSE FOR THIS TO BE A CORRIDOR 

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.954
AND SOUTHBOUND, WOULD IT MAKE   
SENSE FOR THIS TO BE A CORRIDOR 
BETWEEN SOUTH UNIVERSITY AND    

00:15:25.956 --> 00:15:26.789
SENSE FOR THIS TO BE A CORRIDOR 
BETWEEN SOUTH UNIVERSITY AND    
EAST WILLIAM TO BE BUSSES ONLY  

00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:30.059
BETWEEN SOUTH UNIVERSITY AND    
EAST WILLIAM TO BE BUSSES ONLY  
WITH PROTECTED BIKE LANES ON    

00:15:30.061 --> 00:15:30.626
EAST WILLIAM TO BE BUSSES ONLY  
WITH PROTECTED BIKE LANES ON    
BOTH SIDES THAT WAS             

00:15:30.628 --> 00:15:30.960

IT WAS KICKED AROUND.           
IT WAS DISCUSSED.               
IT WAS TALKED ABOUT AMONG THE   

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.867
IT WAS DISCUSSED.               
IT WAS TALKED ABOUT AMONG THE   
STAKEHOLDERS AND ULTIMATELY THE 

00:15:37.869 --> 00:15:38.667
IT WAS TALKED ABOUT AMONG THE   
STAKEHOLDERS AND ULTIMATELY THE 
DECISION WAS MADE THAT NOW IS   

00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:41.537
STAKEHOLDERS AND ULTIMATELY THE 
DECISION WAS MADE THAT NOW IS   
NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO IMPLEMENT 

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:42.704
DECISION WAS MADE THAT NOW IS   
NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO IMPLEMENT 
THAT THAT WAS MORE OR LESS THE  

00:15:42.706 --> 00:15:43.406
NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO IMPLEMENT 
THAT THAT WAS MORE OR LESS THE  
CONSENSUS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS   

00:15:43.408 --> 00:15:45.408
THAT THAT WAS MORE OR LESS THE  
CONSENSUS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS   
AS I UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY    

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.978
CONSENSUS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS   
AS I UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY    
ALSO KNEW THAT THERE'S A LOT    

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.779
AS I UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY    
ALSO KNEW THAT THERE'S A LOT    
OF TRAFFIC GOING NORTHBOUND ON  

00:15:49.781 --> 00:15:53.315
ALSO KNEW THAT THERE'S A LOT    
OF TRAFFIC GOING NORTHBOUND ON  
STATE STREET SO WITH THE BUSSES 

00:15:53.317 --> 00:15:54.149
OF TRAFFIC GOING NORTHBOUND ON  
STATE STREET SO WITH THE BUSSES 
SO HOW COULD TRANSIT STILL BE   

00:15:54.151 --> 00:15:56.952
STATE STREET SO WITH THE BUSSES 
SO HOW COULD TRANSIT STILL BE   
IMPLEMENTED?                    

00:15:56.954 --> 00:15:57.887
SO HOW COULD TRANSIT STILL BE   
IMPLEMENTED?                    
IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE     

00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:58.154
IMPLEMENTED?                    
IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE     
PROJECT.                        

00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:02.357

IS HOW THIS CAME TO BERTH.      
>> SO WE HAVE THE SOUTHBOUND    

00:16:09.934 --> 00:16:12.935
IS HOW THIS CAME TO BERTH.      
>> SO WE HAVE THE SOUTHBOUND    
LANE WHICH WOULD BE SHARED BOTH 

00:16:12.937 --> 00:16:16.005
>> SO WE HAVE THE SOUTHBOUND    
LANE WHICH WOULD BE SHARED BOTH 
BY EIGHT A.M. CARS NORTHBOUND   

00:16:16.007 --> 00:16:16.772
LANE WHICH WOULD BE SHARED BOTH 
BY EIGHT A.M. CARS NORTHBOUND   
LANE THAT'S JUST FOR NON        

00:16:16.774 --> 00:16:20.176
BY EIGHT A.M. CARS NORTHBOUND   
LANE THAT'S JUST FOR NON

TRANSIT AND THE EXCLUSIVE       
TRANSIT LANES.                  
THERE'S GOING TO BE TWO BUS     

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:24.914
TRANSIT LANES.                  
THERE'S GOING TO BE TWO BUS     
STOPS PROPOSED ONE IN FRONT     

00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:28.084
THERE'S GOING TO BE TWO BUS     
STOPS PROPOSED ONE IN FRONT     
OF THE UNION WHICH IS AT THIS   

00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:31.821
STOPS PROPOSED ONE IN FRONT     
OF THE UNION WHICH IS AT THIS   
TIME ONLY USED BY '88 AND ONE   

00:16:31.823 --> 00:16:32.888
OF THE UNION WHICH IS AT THIS   
TIME ONLY USED BY '88 AND ONE   
AT THE ART CENTER AND THESE ARE 

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.158
TIME ONLY USED BY '88 AND ONE   
AT THE ART CENTER AND THESE ARE 
CALLED SIDE BOARDING ISLAND BUS 

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.492
AT THE ART CENTER AND THESE ARE 
CALLED SIDE BOARDING ISLAND BUS 
STOPS.                          

00:16:36.494 --> 00:16:39.795
CALLED SIDE BOARDING ISLAND BUS 
STOPS.                          
SO WHAT MAKES THESE UNIQUE AND  

00:16:39.797 --> 00:16:40.796
STOPS.                          
SO WHAT MAKES THESE UNIQUE AND  
WHAT MAKES IT A GOOD FEATURE    

00:16:40.798 --> 00:16:42.831
SO WHAT MAKES THESE UNIQUE AND  
WHAT MAKES IT A GOOD FEATURE    
THAT ENHANCES THE SAFETY HERE   

00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:43.833
WHAT MAKES IT A GOOD FEATURE    
THAT ENHANCES THE SAFETY HERE   
IS IT DOESN'T CREATE A CONFLICT 

00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:47.436
THAT ENHANCES THE SAFETY HERE   
IS IT DOESN'T CREATE A CONFLICT 
POINT BETWEEN THE BUS WHEN IT   

00:16:47.438 --> 00:16:48.104
IS IT DOESN'T CREATE A CONFLICT 
POINT BETWEEN THE BUS WHEN IT   
IS DROPPING OFF AND PICKING UP  

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:51.306

IS DROPPING OFF AND PICKING UP  
PASSENGERS AND THE CYCLIST THAT 

00:16:51.308 --> 00:16:52.141
IS DROPPING OFF AND PICKING UP  
PASSENGERS AND THE CYCLIST THAT 
IS CONTINUING TO TRAVEL DOWN    

00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:55.377
PASSENGERS AND THE CYCLIST THAT 
IS CONTINUING TO TRAVEL DOWN    
THE ROADWAY AND THAT'S BECAUSE  

00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:55.912
IS CONTINUING TO TRAVEL DOWN    
THE ROADWAY AND THAT'S BECAUSE  
IT'S SEPARATED.                 

00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:59.348
THE ROADWAY AND THAT'S BECAUSE  
IT'S SEPARATED.                 
SO OVER HERE AS YOU CAN SEE     

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.083

SO IS THIS REALLY ANTICIPATED   

00:30:32.529 --> 00:30:36.564
RIGHT.                          
SO IS THIS REALLY ANTICIPATED   
TO BE LIKE 40 COLORED THE       

00:30:36.566 --> 00:30:40.369
SO IS THIS REALLY ANTICIPATED   
TO BE LIKE 40 COLORED THE       
ENTIRE STRETCH IN RED PAINT AND 

00:30:40.371 --> 00:30:44.205
TO BE LIKE 40 COLORED THE       
ENTIRE STRETCH IN RED PAINT AND 
THE SECOND THE REAL QUESTION IS 

00:30:44.207 --> 00:30:47.442
ENTIRE STRETCH IN RED PAINT AND 
THE SECOND THE REAL QUESTION IS 
AS TO THE THE BUS ONLY TRAFFIC  

00:30:47.444 --> 00:30:55.117
THE SECOND THE REAL QUESTION IS 
AS TO THE THE BUS ONLY TRAFFIC  
SIGNAL IF I IMAGINE THAT IT     

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:56.184
AS TO THE THE BUS ONLY TRAFFIC

WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO SERVICE  

00:30:56.186 --> 00:30:59.020
SIGNAL IF I IMAGINE THAT IT     
WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO SERVICE  
THE BUS MOVEMENT EVERY CYCLE.   

00:30:59.022 --> 00:31:00.088
WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO SERVICE  
THE BUS MOVEMENT EVERY CYCLE.   
IT MAKES SENSE WHEN THE BUSSES  

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.658
THE BUS MOVEMENT EVERY CYCLE.   
IT MAKES SENSE WHEN THE BUSSES  
THERE SO IF THERE IS ANY BUS    

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.962
IT MAKES SENSE WHEN THE BUSSES  
THERE SO IF THERE IS ANY BUS    
DETECTION SYSTEM THAT'S THAT'S  

00:31:06.964 --> 00:31:10.699
THERE SO IF THERE IS ANY BUS    
DETECTION SYSTEM THAT'S THAT'S

THERE'S ALSO DETAILS ABOUT      
BECAUSE THIS REALLY IS A        
FACILITY INTENDED FOR TRANSIT,  

00:32:08.058 --> 00:32:11.626
BECAUSE THIS REALLY IS A

YOU KNOW, FOR THE RIDE AND FOR  

00:32:11.628 --> 00:32:12.860
FACILITY INTENDED FOR TRANSIT,  
YOU KNOW, FOR THE RIDE AND FOR  
THEM THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME   

00:32:12.862 --> 00:32:16.464
YOU KNOW, FOR THE RIDE AND FOR  
THEM THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME   
INVOLVEMENT WITH A CASHIER, A   

00:32:16.466 --> 00:32:17.132

INVOLVEMENT WITH A CASHIER, A   
MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT WHERE     

00:32:17.134 --> 00:32:20.402
INVOLVEMENT WITH A CASHIER, A   
MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT WHERE     
THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN AND   

00:32:20.404 --> 00:32:24.305
MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT WHERE     
THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN AND   
TAKING CARE OF THAT FOR AT      

00:32:24.307 --> 00:32:25.107

CARE OF THAT.                   

00:32:25.442 --> 00:32:27.308
LEAST PROVIDED FUNDS TO TAKE    
CARE OF THAT.                   
SO THAT'S ALSO IN DISCUSSIONS   

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:33.148
CARE OF THAT.                   
SO THAT'S ALSO IN DISCUSSIONS   
TO THANK YOU.                   

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.348
SO THAT'S ALSO IN DISCUSSIONS   
TO THANK YOU.                   
LIKE CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE      

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:39.821
TO THANK YOU.                   
LIKE CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE      
TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE BUS SANSING  

00:32:39.823 --> 00:32:44.092
LIKE CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE      
TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE BUS SANSING  
TRAFFIC LIGHT.                  

00:32:44.094 --> 00:32:44.993
TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE BUS SANSING  
TRAFFIC LIGHT.                  
SO THE THAT'S THAT IS ANOTHER   

00:32:44.995 --> 00:32:47.862
TRAFFIC LIGHT.                  
SO THE THAT'S THAT IS ANOTHER   
ITEM THAT IS STILL UNDER        

00:32:47.864 --> 00:32:48.729
SO THE THAT'S THAT IS ANOTHER   
ITEM THAT IS STILL UNDER        
DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF EXACTLY  

00:32:48.731 --> 00:32:49.398
ITEM THAT IS STILL UNDER        
DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF EXACTLY  
HOW THAT'S GOING TO FUNCTION    

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.399
DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF EXACTLY  
HOW THAT'S GOING TO FUNCTION    
AND OPERATE.                    

00:32:51.401 --> 00:32:52.467
HOW THAT'S GOING TO FUNCTION    
AND OPERATE.                    
BUT I THINK IT BRINGS UP A GOOD 

00:32:52.469 --> 00:32:53.234
AND OPERATE.                    
BUT I THINK IT BRINGS UP A GOOD 
IDEA WE DON'T WANT TO REALLY    

00:32:53.236 --> 00:32:58.773
BUT I THINK IT BRINGS UP A GOOD 
IDEA WE DON'T WANT TO REALLY    
OPERATE THAT AND USE IT IF A    

00:32:58.775 --> 00:33:02.844
IDEA WE DON'T WANT TO REALLY    
OPERATE THAT AND USE IT IF A    
BUS ISN'T THERE IF WE CAN GIVE  

00:33:02.846 --> 00:33:03.611
OPERATE THAT AND USE IT IF A    
BUS ISN'T THERE IF WE CAN GIVE  
THAT GREEN TIME TO A VEHICLE    

00:33:03.613 --> 00:33:06.814
BUS ISN'T THERE IF WE CAN GIVE  
THAT GREEN TIME TO A VEHICLE    
INSTEAD IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE 

00:33:06.816 --> 00:33:07.482
THAT GREEN TIME TO A VEHICLE    
INSTEAD IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE 
THINGS OPERATE A LITTLE BIT     

00:33:07.484 --> 00:33:07.949
INSTEAD IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE 
THINGS OPERATE A LITTLE BIT     
MORE EFFICIENTLY.               

00:33:07.951 --> 00:33:08.950
THINGS OPERATE A LITTLE BIT     
MORE EFFICIENTLY.               
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN      

00:33:08.952 --> 00:33:12.453
MORE EFFICIENTLY.               
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN      
DEFINITELY REVIEW.              

00:33:12.455 --> 00:33:16.424
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN      
DEFINITELY REVIEW.

OK, SOME OF THE OTHER POINTS I  
HAD I THINK WE NEED SOME DESIGN

OK, SOME OF THE OTHER POINTS I  
HAD I THINK WE NEED SOME DESIGN 
FEATURES TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

HAD I THINK WE NEED SOME DESIGN 
FEATURES TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM 
ABUSING THE SKIP LANE FROM

FEATURES TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM 
ABUSING THE SKIP LANE FROM      
PREVENTING INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS

PREVENTING INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS   
FROM ABUSING THE SKIP LANE THAT 
TO ME THAT LOOKS LIKE A         

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:18.587
FROM ABUSING THE SKIP LANE THAT 
TO ME THAT LOOKS LIKE A         
POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR A     

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.723
TO ME THAT LOOKS LIKE A         
POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR A     
HIGH SPEED CRASH IN A CROSSWALK 

00:34:21.725 --> 00:34:22.056
POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR A     
HIGH SPEED CRASH IN A CROSSWALK 
RIGHT.                          

00:34:22.058 --> 00:34:26.661
HIGH SPEED CRASH IN A CROSSWALK 
RIGHT.                          
WHEN DRIVERS GET FRUSTRATED BY

RIGHT.                          
WHEN DRIVERS GET FRUSTRATED BY

OF ALL THE TRAFFIC AND ALL JUST 
BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION WE     

00:34:34.204 --> 00:34:35.069
OF ALL THE TRAFFIC AND ALL JUST 
BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION WE     
HAVE IN THAT AREA, I CAN SEE    

00:34:35.071 --> 00:34:37.873
BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION WE     
HAVE IN THAT AREA, I CAN SEE    
PEOPLE GETTING FRUSTRATED AND   

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:38.807
HAVE IN THAT AREA, I CAN SEE    
PEOPLE GETTING FRUSTRATED AND   
OPTING TO USE THAT SKIP LANE    

00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:42.477
PEOPLE GETTING FRUSTRATED AND   
OPTING TO USE THAT SKIP LANE    
INAPPROPRIATELY AND UM SO IF    

00:34:42.479 --> 00:34:46.314
OPTING TO USE THAT SKIP LANE    
INAPPROPRIATELY AND UM SO IF    
THEY'RE GOING TO IF THEY'RE

THEY'RE GOING TO IF THEY'RE     
GOING FASTER THAN ALL THE OTHER 
CARS THAT ARE WAITING ON STATE  

00:34:49.886 --> 00:34:50.785
GOING FASTER THAN ALL THE OTHER 
CARS THAT ARE WAITING ON STATE  
STREET, THEN THAT COULD CREATE  

00:34:50.787 --> 00:34:53.888
CARS THAT ARE WAITING ON STATE  
STREET, THEN THAT COULD CREATE  
A SERIOUS CONFLICT THAT AT THE  

00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:57.292
STREET, THEN THAT COULD CREATE  
A SERIOUS CONFLICT THAT AT THE  
CROSSWALK THAT GO I'M SORRY.

SIDE OF THE CROSSWALK, THEN THE 

00:47:06.622 --> 00:47:10.157
SO WHEN THE BUS GOES TO THE FAR 
SIDE OF THE CROSSWALK, THEN THE 
PASSENGER GETS OUT AND WALKS    

00:47:10.159 --> 00:47:10.925
SIDE OF THE CROSSWALK, THEN THE 
PASSENGER GETS OUT AND WALKS    
BACKWARDS AWAY FROM THE BUS TO  

00:47:10.927 --> 00:47:13.860
PASSENGER GETS OUT AND WALKS    
BACKWARDS AWAY FROM THE BUS TO  
THE CROSSWALK.                  

00:47:13.862 --> 00:47:14.695
BACKWARDS AWAY FROM THE BUS TO  
THE CROSSWALK.                  
THEY'RE NOW FULLY VISIBLE TO    

00:47:14.697 --> 00:47:17.865
THE CROSSWALK.                  
THEY'RE NOW FULLY VISIBLE TO    
ONCOMING TRAFFIC HEADING THE    

00:47:17.867 --> 00:47:18.532
THEY'RE NOW FULLY VISIBLE TO    
ONCOMING TRAFFIC HEADING THE    
SAME DIRECTION OF THE BUS.      

00:47:18.534 --> 00:47:21.769
ONCOMING TRAFFIC HEADING THE    
SAME DIRECTION OF THE BUS.      
SO THE WAY IT'S DESIGNED IN     

00:47:21.771 --> 00:47:22.436
SAME DIRECTION OF THE BUS.      
SO THE WAY IT'S DESIGNED IN     
YOUR SCHEMATIC RIGHT NOW IS     

00:47:22.438 --> 00:47:23.103
SO THE WAY IT'S DESIGNED IN     
YOUR SCHEMATIC RIGHT NOW IS     
PROBABLY THE SAFEST WAY IT      

00:47:23.105 --> 00:47:26.139
YOUR SCHEMATIC RIGHT NOW IS     
PROBABLY THE SAFEST WAY IT      
COULD BE BECAUSE THE CROSSWALK  

00:47:26.141 --> 00:47:28.875
PROBABLY THE SAFEST WAY IT      
COULD BE BECAUSE THE CROSSWALK  
IS BEHIND THE BUS STOP AND      

00:47:28.877 --> 00:47:29.576
COULD BE BECAUSE THE CROSSWALK  
IS BEHIND THE BUS STOP AND      
MOTORISTS WOULD WOULD SEE THE   

00:47:29.578 --> 00:47:30.344
IS BEHIND THE BUS STOP AND      
MOTORISTS WOULD WOULD SEE THE   
PEOPLE TRYING TO CROSS THE      

00:47:30.346 --> 00:47:32.779
MOTORISTS WOULD WOULD SEE THE   
PEOPLE TRYING TO CROSS THE      
STREET.                         

00:47:32.781 --> 00:47:33.814
PEOPLE TRYING TO CROSS THE      
STREET.                         
SO I DON'T DISAGREE WITH PETE   

00:47:33.816 --> 00:47:34.548
STREET.                         
SO I DON'T DISAGREE WITH PETE   
ABOUT THE TURNING RADIUS BUT    

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:37.351
SO I DON'T DISAGREE WITH PETE   
ABOUT THE TURNING RADIUS BUT    
PLEASE KEEP THE ORIENTATION     

00:47:37.353 --> 00:47:40.654
ABOUT THE TURNING RADIUS BUT    
PLEASE KEEP THE ORIENTATION     
OF THE CROSSWALKS ON THE BUS    

00:47:40.656 --> 00:47:41.521
PLEASE KEEP THE ORIENTATION     
OF THE CROSSWALKS ON THE BUS    
STOPS THE WAY THEY ARE.         

00:47:41.523 --> 00:47:41.922
OF THE CROSSWALKS ON THE BUS    
STOPS THE WAY THEY ARE.         
THANK YOU.                      

00:47:41.924 --> 00:47:45.192
STOPS THE WAY THEY ARE.         
THANK YOU.                      
OTHERWISE GREAT GREAT DESIGN.   

00:47:45.194 --> 00:47:52.032
THANK YOU.                      
OTHERWISE GREAT GREAT DESIGN.   
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE    

00:47:52.034 --> 00:47:52.432
OTHERWISE GREAT GREAT DESIGN.   
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE    
BUS STOPS.                      

00:47:52.434 --> 00:47:53.501
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE    
BUS STOPS.                      
I ASSUME THAT THEY WOULD BE     

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:56.737
BUS STOPS.                      
I ASSUME THAT THEY WOULD BE     
SHARED BETWEEN TODAY AND THEN   

00:47:56.739 --> 00:47:57.037
I ASSUME THAT THEY WOULD BE     
SHARED BETWEEN TODAY AND THEN   
BUSSES.                         

00:47:57.039 --> 00:47:57.571
SHARED BETWEEN TODAY AND THEN   
BUSSES.                         
IS THAT RIGHT?                  

00:47:57.573 --> 00:48:03.777
BUSSES.                         
IS THAT RIGHT?                  
JUST FOR THE NORTHBOUND         

00:48:03.779 --> 00:48:04.578
IS THAT RIGHT?                  
JUST FOR THE NORTHBOUND         
SOUTHBOUND IS EXCLUSIVE TO AT   

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.448
JUST FOR THE NORTHBOUND         
SOUTHBOUND IS EXCLUSIVE TO AT   
THIS TIME EIGHT OK, ALL RIGHT.  

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:12.586
SOUTHBOUND IS EXCLUSIVE TO AT   
THIS TIME EIGHT OK, ALL RIGHT.  
AND THEN A QUESTION ABOUT THE   

00:48:12.588 --> 00:48:14.955
THIS TIME EIGHT OK, ALL RIGHT.  
AND THEN A QUESTION ABOUT THE   
TRANSIT QUEUE JOB SIGNAL WHEN   

00:48:14.957 --> 00:48:16.056
AND THEN A QUESTION ABOUT THE   
TRANSIT QUEUE JOB SIGNAL WHEN   
IT DOES GO VERTICAL FOR BUSSES  

00:48:16.058 --> 00:48:19.860
TRANSIT QUEUE JOB SIGNAL WHEN   
IT DOES GO VERTICAL FOR BUSSES  
THAT DOES THAT FOR THE BUS      

00:48:19.862 --> 00:48:20.561
IT DOES GO VERTICAL FOR BUSSES  
THAT DOES THAT FOR THE BUS      
DRIVER THAT SEES THAT WOULD     

00:48:20.563 --> 00:48:23.698
THAT DOES THAT FOR THE BUS      
DRIVER THAT SEES THAT WOULD     
THAT THEY SEE THAT AS JUST AN   

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.565
DRIVER THAT SEES THAT WOULD     
THAT THEY SEE THAT AS JUST AN   
OPPORTUNITY TO GET AHEAD OF THE 

00:48:24.567 --> 00:48:27.868
THAT THEY SEE THAT AS JUST AN   
OPPORTUNITY TO GET AHEAD OF THE 
CARS AND THEN STOP OR GO ALL    

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:28.436
OPPORTUNITY TO GET AHEAD OF THE 
CARS AND THEN STOP OR GO ALL    
THE WAY THROUGH THE             

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:31.205
CARS AND THEN STOP OR GO ALL    
THE WAY THROUGH THE             
INTERSECTION BECAUSE WOULD HAVE 

00:48:31.207 --> 00:48:32.006
THE WAY THROUGH THE             
INTERSECTION BECAUSE WOULD HAVE 
AN EFFECT ON WHETHER MULTIPLE   

00:48:32.008 --> 00:48:34.475
INTERSECTION BECAUSE WOULD HAVE 
AN EFFECT ON WHETHER MULTIPLE   
BUSSES COULD EVEN GET THROUGH   

00:48:34.477 --> 00:48:38.578
AN EFFECT ON WHETHER MULTIPLE   
BUSSES COULD EVEN GET THROUGH   
ALL THE WAY THROUGH ALL THE WAY 

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.012
BUSSES COULD EVEN GET THROUGH   
ALL THE WAY THROUGH ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH.                        

00:48:39.014 --> 00:48:39.613
ALL THE WAY THROUGH ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH.                        
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE GREEN LIGHT.  

00:48:39.615 --> 00:48:42.316
THROUGH.                        
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE GREEN LIGHT.  
OK, RIGHT.                      

00:48:42.318 --> 00:48:43.317
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE GREEN LIGHT.  
OK, RIGHT.                      
SO IT MAKES SENSE THEN THAT     

00:48:43.319 --> 00:48:44.118
OK, RIGHT.                      
SO IT MAKES SENSE THEN THAT     
THERE'S MULTIPLE BUSSES THAT    

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.519
SO IT MAKES SENSE THEN THAT     
THERE'S MULTIPLE BUSSES THAT    
THEY COULD HOPEFULLY GET        

00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:45.786
THERE'S MULTIPLE BUSSES THAT    
THEY COULD HOPEFULLY GET        
THROUGH.                        

00:48:45.788 --> 00:48:49.790
THEY COULD HOPEFULLY GET        
THROUGH.                        
>> OK, THAT DEPENDS HOWEVER ON  

00:48:49.792 --> 00:48:53.694
THROUGH.                        
>> OK, THAT DEPENDS HOWEVER ON  
THE DURATION OF THE SIGNAL WITH 

00:48:53.696 --> 00:48:57.164
>> OK, THAT DEPENDS HOWEVER ON  
THE DURATION OF THE SIGNAL WITH 
A QUEUE JUMPER THE IDEA IS JUST 

00:48:57.166 --> 00:48:58.365
THE DURATION OF THE SIGNAL WITH 
A QUEUE JUMPER THE IDEA IS JUST 
LONG ENOUGH FOR THE BUS TO PULL 

00:48:58.367 --> 00:49:01.601
A QUEUE JUMPER THE IDEA IS JUST 
LONG ENOUGH FOR THE BUS TO PULL 
AHEAD OF THE TRAFFIC ONCE THAT  

00:49:01.603 --> 00:49:05.139
LONG ENOUGH FOR THE BUS TO PULL 
AHEAD OF THE TRAFFIC ONCE THAT  
40 FOOT LONG BUS HAS STARTED TO 

00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:06.173
AHEAD OF THE TRAFFIC ONCE THAT  
40 FOOT LONG BUS HAS STARTED TO 
PULL AHEAD OF YOU, YOU'RE NOT   

00:49:06.175 --> 00:49:09.242
40 FOOT LONG BUS HAS STARTED TO 
PULL AHEAD OF YOU, YOU'RE NOT   
LIKELY TO RAM INTO IT.          

00:49:09.244 --> 00:49:09.643
PULL AHEAD OF YOU, YOU'RE NOT   
LIKELY TO RAM INTO IT.          
RIGHT.                          

00:49:09.645 --> 00:49:10.644
LIKELY TO RAM INTO IT.          
RIGHT.                          
BUT IF THE FIRST BUS IS GONE    

00:49:10.646 --> 00:49:13.714
RIGHT.                          
BUT IF THE FIRST BUS IS GONE    
AND THE SECOND ONE HASN'T QUITE 

00:49:13.716 --> 00:49:14.581
BUT IF THE FIRST BUS IS GONE    
AND THE SECOND ONE HASN'T QUITE 
CAUGHT UP TO IT, SOMEONE COULD  

00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:17.117
AND THE SECOND ONE HASN'T QUITE 
CAUGHT UP TO IT, SOMEONE COULD  
SNEAK IN AND LET ALL THE OTHER  

00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:17.518
CAUGHT UP TO IT, SOMEONE COULD  
SNEAK IN AND LET ALL THE OTHER  
TRAFFIC GO.                     

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.252
SNEAK IN AND LET ALL THE OTHER  
TRAFFIC GO.                     
SO THERE'S I THINK THEY'RE      

00:49:18.254 --> 00:49:21.054
TRAFFIC GO.                     
SO THERE'S I THINK THEY'RE      
STILL DOING SOME WORK ON HOW    

00:49:21.056 --> 00:49:24.324
SO THERE'S I THINK THEY'RE      
STILL DOING SOME WORK ON HOW    
EXACTLY TO MAKE THAT SYSTEM     

00:49:24.326 --> 00:49:25.258
STILL DOING SOME WORK ON HOW    
EXACTLY TO MAKE THAT SYSTEM     
EFFECTIVE AND IT'S NOT VERY FAR 

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:28.428
EXACTLY TO MAKE THAT SYSTEM     
EFFECTIVE AND IT'S NOT VERY FAR 
UNTIL THE NEXT STOP AT N RIGHT  

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.629
EFFECTIVE AND IT'S NOT VERY FAR 
UNTIL THE NEXT STOP AT N RIGHT  
.                               

00:49:28.631 --> 00:49:29.630
UNTIL THE NEXT STOP AT N RIGHT  
.                               
SO THERE COULD EASILY BE, YOU   

00:49:29.632 --> 00:49:32.867
.                               
SO THERE COULD EASILY BE, YOU   
KNOW, A BACKUP THERE TO AT THAT 

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:33.667
SO THERE COULD EASILY BE, YOU   
KNOW, A BACKUP THERE TO AT THAT 
LIGHT UNLESS THIS WILL BE TIMED 

00:49:33.669 --> 00:49:36.537
KNOW, A BACKUP THERE TO AT THAT 
LIGHT UNLESS THIS WILL BE TIMED 
IN COORDINATION WITH THE NORTH  

00:49:36.539 --> 00:49:37.304
LIGHT UNLESS THIS WILL BE TIMED 
IN COORDINATION WITH THE NORTH  
YOU LIGHT I DON'T KNOW.         

00:49:37.306 --> 00:49:39.539
IN COORDINATION WITH THE NORTH  
YOU LIGHT I DON'T KNOW.         
>> YEAH.                        

00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:40.508
YOU LIGHT I DON'T KNOW.         
>> YEAH.                        
THERE'S ALSO SOME ROUTES TURN   

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.543
>> YEAH.                        
THERE'S ALSO SOME ROUTES TURN   
LEFT AS WELL ON WILLIAM YEAH    

00:49:43.545 --> 00:49:47.515
THERE'S ALSO SOME ROUTES TURN   
LEFT AS WELL ON WILLIAM YEAH    
RIGHT.                          

00:49:47.517 --> 00:49:48.115
LEFT AS WELL ON WILLIAM YEAH    
RIGHT.                          
ALL RIGHT.                      

00:49:48.117 --> 00:49:54.354
RIGHT.                          
ALL RIGHT.                      
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE    

00:49:54.356 --> 00:49:55.289
ALL RIGHT.                      
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE    
THAT'S A GOOD POINT ABOUT       

00:49:55.291 --> 00:49:57.691
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE    
THAT'S A GOOD POINT ABOUT       
SIMILAR BUS ISLANDS THROUGHOUT  

00:49:57.693 --> 00:49:58.092
THAT'S A GOOD POINT ABOUT       
SIMILAR BUS ISLANDS THROUGHOUT  
THE CITY.                       

00:49:58.094 --> 00:50:02.263
SIMILAR BUS ISLANDS THROUGHOUT  
THE CITY.                       
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANOTHER   

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:02.729
THE CITY.                       
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANOTHER   
PLACE NEARBY.                   

00:50:02.731 --> 00:50:05.666
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANOTHER   
PLACE NEARBY.                   
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHERE ONE    

00:50:05.668 --> 00:50:06.534
PLACE NEARBY.                   
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHERE ONE    
WHERE WE HAVE A BUS BOARDING    

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:07.334
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHERE ONE    
WHERE WE HAVE A BUS BOARDING    
ISLAND LIKE THIS THOUGH IN ANN  

00:50:07.336 --> 00:50:10.304
WHERE WE HAVE A BUS BOARDING    
ISLAND LIKE THIS THOUGH IN ANN  
ARBOR THAT HAS THIS VOLUME      

00:50:10.306 --> 00:50:10.838
ISLAND LIKE THIS THOUGH IN ANN  
ARBOR THAT HAS THIS VOLUME      
OF PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC.          

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.240
ARBOR THAT HAS THIS VOLUME      
OF PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC.          
I MEAN THIS IS LIKE STATE       

00:50:13.242 --> 00:50:13.974
OF PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC.          
I MEAN THIS IS LIKE STATE       
STREET DURING THE SCHOOL DAY IS 

00:50:13.976 --> 00:50:20.281
I MEAN THIS IS LIKE STATE       
STREET DURING THE SCHOOL DAY IS 
LIKE OFF THE CHARTS             

00:50:33.762 --> 00:50:35.929
                   .            
SO I JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL    
ABOUT ABOUT THE COMPARISON.     

00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:36.197
SO I JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL    
ABOUT ABOUT THE COMPARISON.     
>> YEAH.                        

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:37.531
ABOUT ABOUT THE COMPARISON.     
>> YEAH.                        
AND THIS ONE I PULLED UP THE    

00:50:37.533 --> 00:50:38.332
>> YEAH.                        
AND THIS ONE I PULLED UP THE    
WILLIAMS ONE AND DIVISION ONE   

00:50:38.334 --> 00:50:38.999
AND THIS ONE I PULLED UP THE    
WILLIAMS ONE AND DIVISION ONE   
AND THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT       

00:50:39.001 --> 00:50:39.799
WILLIAMS ONE AND DIVISION ONE   
AND THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT       
BECAUSE WE ARE PROVIDING A LOT  

00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:41.001
AND THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT       
BECAUSE WE ARE PROVIDING A LOT  
MORE STORAGE FOR PEDESTRIANS, A 

00:50:41.003 --> 00:50:41.769
BECAUSE WE ARE PROVIDING A LOT  
MORE STORAGE FOR PEDESTRIANS, A 
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO QUEUE AND   

00:50:41.771 --> 00:50:42.769
MORE STORAGE FOR PEDESTRIANS, A 
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO QUEUE AND   
WAIT FOR A BUS THAT'S NOT ALSO  

00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:43.971
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO QUEUE AND   
WAIT FOR A BUS THAT'S NOT ALSO  
SHARED WITH THE FACILITY BIKE   

00:50:43.973 --> 00:50:44.304
WAIT FOR A BUS THAT'S NOT ALSO  
SHARED WITH THE FACILITY BIKE   
LANE.                           

00:50:44.306 --> 00:50:48.309
SHARED WITH THE FACILITY BIKE   
LANE.                           
SO IT'S DEFINITELY SIZED FOR    

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:50.844
LANE.

STRATEGIES THEY'RE FURTHERING   
AND HOW THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER  
IN A DOWNTOWN NETWORK MORE THAN

JUST TWO THAT COULD BE          
CONSIDERED CANDIDATES FOR THAT. 

01:38:30.302 --> 01:38:34.171
JUST TWO THAT COULD BE          
CONSIDERED CANDIDATES FOR THAT. 
LIKE I'M THINKING FOR THE
