CONVERTED.                      

00:48:53.272 --> 00:48:54.004
HOUSES THAT HAVE BEEN           
CONVERTED.                      
THEY'RE NOT PARKING LOTS AND

HAD ANY COMPLAINTS FROM THE     
NEIGHBORS ABOUT THOSE PLACES    
BEING THERE, WHETHER THEY'VE    

00:48:56.743 --> 00:48:57.474
NEIGHBORS ABOUT THOSE PLACES    
BEING THERE, WHETHER THEY'VE    
ACTUALLY CAUSED THE PROBLEMS    

00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:58.242
BEING THERE, WHETHER THEY'VE    
ACTUALLY CAUSED THE PROBLEMS    
THAT FOLKS ARE RAISING OR MY    

00:48:58.244 --> 00:48:58.975
ACTUALLY CAUSED THE PROBLEMS

EXCEPTION USES.                 
THEY WERE EACH INDIVIDUALLY

THERE HAVE BEEN OVER THE YEARS  
MANY SIMILAR SITUATIONS         

00:49:24.703 --> 00:49:25.503

MANY SIMILAR SITUATIONS         
EXISTING HOME WITH OR WITHOUT

MANY SIMILAR SITUATIONS         
EXISTING HOME WITH OR WITHOUT   
AN ADDITION IS PROPOSED TO BE   

00:49:28.875 --> 00:49:29.540
EXISTING HOME WITH OR WITHOUT   
AN ADDITION IS PROPOSED TO BE   
CONVERTED TO A CHILD CARE       

00:49:29.542 --> 00:49:32.209
AN ADDITION IS PROPOSED TO BE   
CONVERTED TO A CHILD CARE       
CENTER AND THEY TYPICALLY       

00:49:32.211 --> 00:49:33.077

CENTER AND THEY TYPICALLY       
GENERATE A LOT OF COMMENTARY.   

00:49:33.079 --> 00:49:33.811
CENTER AND THEY TYPICALLY       
GENERATE A LOT OF COMMENTARY.

SO CHANGE IS OFTEN A LITTLE BIT 
ALARMING TO FOLKS AND THAT DOES 
DRAW PEOPLE OUT CHILD CARE

ALARMING TO FOLKS AND THAT DOES

>> IT IMPOSES ON THEM A LOT     
OF COST AND A LOT OF TIME AND   

00:50:29.468 --> 00:50:30.400
>> IT IMPOSES ON THEM A LOT     
OF COST AND A LOT OF TIME AND   
JUST TO HAVE A HOUSE IN A       

00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:33.803
OF COST AND A LOT OF TIME AND   
JUST TO HAVE A HOUSE IN A       
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU TAKE CARE 

00:50:33.805 --> 00:50:34.738
JUST TO HAVE A HOUSE IN A       
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU TAKE CARE 
OF KIDS IN I COULD DO THAT      

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.740
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU TAKE CARE 
OF KIDS IN I COULD DO THAT      
WITHOUT A LICENSE AT ALL IF I   

00:50:36.742 --> 00:50:37.641
OF KIDS IN I COULD DO THAT      
WITHOUT A LICENSE AT ALL IF I

WANTED TO HAVE A PARCEL         
OF CHILDREN.

00:50:40.879 --> 00:50:42.045
OF CHILDREN.                    
SO THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.   
THERE'S THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL. 

00:50:42.047 --> 00:50:44.849
SO THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.   
THERE'S THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL. 
IT'S NOT A BIG CHANGE FOR       

00:50:44.851 --> 00:50:45.248
THERE'S THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL. 
IT'S NOT A BIG CHANGE FOR       
PEOPLE.                         

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.752
IT'S NOT A BIG CHANGE FOR       
PEOPLE.                         
IT'S A BIG CHANGE POSSIBLY IT   

00:50:48.754 --> 00:50:49.620
PEOPLE.                         
IT'S A BIG CHANGE POSSIBLY IT   
JUST OPENS THE POSSIBILITY OF A 

00:50:49.622 --> 00:50:52.589
IT'S A BIG CHANGE POSSIBLY IT   
JUST OPENS THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
BIG CHANGE FOR A CHILD CARE     

00:50:52.591 --> 00:50:53.023
JUST OPENS THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
BIG CHANGE FOR A CHILD CARE     
ACCESSIBILITY.                  

00:50:53.025 --> 00:50:53.891
BIG CHANGE FOR A CHILD CARE     
ACCESSIBILITY.                  
AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE MAP    

00:50:53.893 --> 00:50:55.959
ACCESSIBILITY.                  
AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE MAP    
AND IT LOOKS LIKE REALLY MORE   

00:50:55.961 --> 00:50:56.960
AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE MAP    
AND IT LOOKS LIKE REALLY MORE   
THAN DOUBLES THE AREA WHERE YOU 

00:50:56.962 --> 00:51:00.464
AND IT LOOKS LIKE REALLY MORE   
THAN DOUBLES THE AREA WHERE YOU 
COULD PUT A CHILD CARE FACILITY 

00:51:00.466 --> 00:51:03.934
THAN DOUBLES THE AREA WHERE YOU 
COULD PUT A CHILD CARE FACILITY 
AND IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT 

00:51:03.936 --> 00:51:07.704
COULD PUT A CHILD CARE FACILITY 
AND IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT 
TO MAKE THIS EASIER IN THE      

00:51:07.706 --> 00:51:08.538
AND IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT 
TO MAKE THIS EASIER IN THE      
AREAS OF OFFICE AND RESEARCH    

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.306
TO MAKE THIS EASIER IN THE      
AREAS OF OFFICE AND RESEARCH    
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE KINDS     

00:51:09.308 --> 00:51:11.608
AREAS OF OFFICE AND RESEARCH    
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE KINDS     
OF PLACES YOU COULD DROP YOUR   

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:12.442
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE KINDS     
OF PLACES YOU COULD DROP YOUR   
KID OFF ON THE WAY TO WORK IF   

00:51:12.444 --> 00:51:15.980
OF PLACES YOU COULD DROP YOUR   
KID OFF ON THE WAY TO WORK IF   
YOU COMMUTE OR MAYBE YOU WORK   

00:51:15.982 --> 00:51:16.847
KID OFF ON THE WAY TO WORK IF   
YOU COMMUTE OR MAYBE YOU WORK   
IN ANN ARBOR AND THEN YOU       

00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:17.548
YOU COMMUTE OR MAYBE YOU WORK   
IN ANN ARBOR AND THEN YOU       
DECIDE TO HAVE CHILD CARE FOR   

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:19.617
IN ANN ARBOR AND THEN YOU       
DECIDE TO HAVE CHILD CARE FOR   
YOUR CHILD IN ANN ARBOR BECAUSE 

00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:20.284
DECIDE TO HAVE CHILD CARE FOR   
YOUR CHILD IN ANN ARBOR BECAUSE 
YOU YOU KNOW, YOU ENTER THE     

00:51:20.286 --> 00:51:23.420
YOUR CHILD IN ANN ARBOR BECAUSE 
YOU YOU KNOW, YOU ENTER THE     
CITY PAST ONE OF THESE POINTS.  

00:51:23.422 --> 00:51:24.521
YOU YOU KNOW, YOU ENTER THE     
CITY PAST ONE OF THESE POINTS.  
AND SO THIS IS THIS COULD BE    

00:51:24.523 --> 00:51:27.157
CITY PAST ONE OF THESE POINTS.  
AND SO THIS IS THIS COULD BE    
VERY TRANSFORMATIVE BECAUSE YOU 

00:51:27.159 --> 00:51:30.994
AND SO THIS IS THIS COULD BE

01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:01.743
I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR       
BRINGING THIS UP.               
IT'S A PARADOX THAT THE         

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:05.047
BRINGING THIS UP.               
IT'S A PARADOX THAT THE         
DEFINITION OF PUBLIC UTILITY IS 

01:24:05.049 --> 01:24:05.981
IT'S A PARADOX THAT THE         
DEFINITION OF PUBLIC UTILITY IS 
PRIVATE UTILITY AND SO IT MAKES 

01:24:05.983 --> 01:24:09.284
DEFINITION OF PUBLIC UTILITY IS 
PRIVATE UTILITY AND SO IT MAKES 
SENSE TO FIX.                   

01:24:09.286 --> 01:24:10.418
PRIVATE UTILITY AND SO IT MAKES 
SENSE TO FIX.                   
I THINK THE ORIGIN OF THAT IS   

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.887
SENSE TO FIX.                   
I THINK THE ORIGIN OF THAT IS   
THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW, IN THE  

01:24:12.889 --> 01:24:13.555
I THINK THE ORIGIN OF THAT IS   
THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW, IN THE  
LANGUAGE OF A CENTURY AGO AND   

01:24:13.557 --> 01:24:16.491
THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW, IN THE  
LANGUAGE OF A CENTURY AGO AND   
THESE UTILS UTILITY SPRANG UP   

01:24:16.493 --> 01:24:20.062
LANGUAGE OF A CENTURY AGO AND   
THESE UTILS UTILITY SPRANG UP   
UTILITY THAT SERVE THE PUBLIC   

01:24:20.064 --> 01:24:21.196
THESE UTILS UTILITY SPRANG UP   
UTILITY THAT SERVE THE PUBLIC   
WHETHER IT BE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC 

01:24:21.198 --> 01:24:24.266
UTILITY THAT SERVE THE PUBLIC   
WHETHER IT BE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC 
WAS ALL ABOUT AUTOMATICALLY     

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:24.933
WHETHER IT BE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC 
WAS ALL ABOUT AUTOMATICALLY     
CALLED A PUBLIC UTILITY.        

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:27.869
WAS ALL ABOUT AUTOMATICALLY     
CALLED A PUBLIC UTILITY.        
BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT I     

01:24:27.871 --> 01:24:31.106
CALLED A PUBLIC UTILITY.        
BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT I     
KNOW IT'S AN OPEN ENDED         

01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:31.907
BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT I     
KNOW IT'S AN OPEN ENDED         
DEFINITION BUT IT DOESN'T       

01:24:31.909 --> 01:24:32.707
KNOW IT'S AN OPEN ENDED         
DEFINITION BUT IT DOESN'T       
INCLUDE ELECTRIC UTILITY THERE  

01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:36.311
DEFINITION BUT IT DOESN'T       
INCLUDE ELECTRIC UTILITY THERE  
AND I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING   

01:24:36.313 --> 01:24:36.979
INCLUDE ELECTRIC UTILITY THERE  
AND I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING   
ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER TO    

01:24:36.981 --> 01:24:37.779
AND I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING   
ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER TO    
APPROVE A CITY OWNED ELECTRIC   

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:40.149
ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER TO    
APPROVE A CITY OWNED ELECTRIC   
UTILITY, A PUBLIC UTILITY BY    

01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:40.949
APPROVE A CITY OWNED ELECTRIC   
UTILITY, A PUBLIC UTILITY BY    
THE NEW DEFINITION AND THERE'S  

01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:43.752
UTILITY, A PUBLIC UTILITY BY    
THE NEW DEFINITION AND THERE'S  
A BIG GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO DO   

01:24:43.754 --> 01:24:44.686
THE NEW DEFINITION AND THERE'S  
A BIG GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO DO   
AN EVEN BIGGER ONE COULD TAKE   

01:24:44.688 --> 01:24:47.789
A BIG GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO DO   
AN EVEN BIGGER ONE COULD TAKE   
OVER OUR EXISTING PUBLIC        

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:51.526
AN EVEN BIGGER ONE COULD TAKE   
OVER OUR EXISTING PUBLIC        
PRIVATE UTILITY DTG ENERGY.     

01:24:51.528 --> 01:24:52.594
OVER OUR EXISTING PUBLIC        
PRIVATE UTILITY DTG ENERGY.     
SO THIS IS A TIMELY AMENDMENT,  

01:24:52.596 --> 01:24:55.530
PRIVATE UTILITY DTG ENERGY.     
SO THIS IS A TIMELY AMENDMENT,  
NOT A BIG DEAL.                 

01:24:55.532 --> 01:24:56.465
SO THIS IS A TIMELY AMENDMENT,  
NOT A BIG DEAL.                 
BUT I WONDER WHY ELECTRIC       

01:24:56.467 --> 01:24:57.198
NOT A BIG DEAL.                 
BUT I WONDER WHY ELECTRIC       
UTILITY WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE  

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.567
BUT I WONDER WHY ELECTRIC       
UTILITY WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE  
DEFINITION.                     

01:24:59.569 --> 01:25:00.569
UTILITY WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE  
DEFINITION.                     
BUT AGAIN, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO   

01:25:00.571 --> 01:25:03.471
DEFINITION.                     
BUT AGAIN, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO   
BE BECAUSE IT'S OPEN ENDED AND  

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:05.440
BUT AGAIN, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO   
BE BECAUSE IT'S OPEN ENDED AND  
I URGE YOU TO APPROVE THIS.
