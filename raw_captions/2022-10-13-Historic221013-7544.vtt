TISH&amp;apos;S AND THE STANDARDS SAY

RIGHT NOW IS NOT WHAT ARE SEVEN 
TISH&amp;apos;S AND THE STANDARDS SAY    
THAT YOU SHOULD NOT COVER WHAT

ARE SEMANTICIST WITH VINYL.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS RIGHT HERE.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THAT ANY       

00:11:58.122 --> 00:11:58.788
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS RIGHT HERE.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THAT ANY       
OF THE WOOD TRIM SHOULD THE     

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.458
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THAT ANY       
OF THE WOOD TRIM SHOULD THE     
COMMISSION BE CONSIDERING THE   

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.694
OF THE WOOD TRIM SHOULD THE     
COMMISSION BE CONSIDERING THE   
IDEA OF ALLOWING VINYL ON THIS  

00:12:05.696 --> 00:12:05.829
COMMISSION BE CONSIDERING THE   
IDEA OF ALLOWING VINYL ON THIS  
HOUSE.                          

00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:06.763
IDEA OF ALLOWING VINYL ON THIS  
HOUSE.                          
NONE OF THE TRIM SHOULD BE      

00:12:06.765 --> 00:12:09.465
HOUSE.                          
NONE OF THE TRIM SHOULD BE      
ALLOWED TO BE COVERED .         

00:12:09.467 --> 00:12:12.702
NONE OF THE TRIM SHOULD BE      
ALLOWED TO BE COVERED .         
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S JUST A STARTING  

00:12:12.704 --> 00:12:13.703
ALLOWED TO BE COVERED .         
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S JUST A STARTING  
PLACE AND IT IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING TO  

00:12:13.705 --> 00:12:17.039
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S JUST A STARTING  
PLACE AND IT IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING TO  
LOOK THE SAME.                  

00:12:17.041 --> 00:12:17.874
PLACE AND IT IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING TO  
LOOK THE SAME.                  
IT&amp;apos;S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS   

00:12:17.876 --> 00:12:20.410
LOOK THE SAME.                  
IT&amp;apos;S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS   
BE KEPT AS IT WAS THE LAST TIME 

00:12:20.412 --> 00:12:21.211
IT&amp;apos;S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS   
BE KEPT AS IT WAS THE LAST TIME 
THAT THE FAKE SIGHTING WAS PUT  

00:12:21.213 --> 00:12:21.677
BE KEPT AS IT WAS THE LAST TIME 
THAT THE FAKE SIGHTING WAS PUT  
ON OVER THE WOOD.               

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:24.447
THAT THE FAKE SIGHTING WAS PUT  
ON OVER THE WOOD.               
SO THOSE THINGS SHOULD JUST     

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:30.987
ON OVER THE WOOD.               
SO THOSE THINGS SHOULD JUST     
REMAIN EXPOSED EITHER WHICH     

00:12:31.856 --> 00:12:33.656
                            SO  
THIS IS TOUGH.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF THE PROPERTY OWNER HAD    

00:12:33.658 --> 00:12:36.692
THIS IS TOUGH.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF THE PROPERTY OWNER HAD    
CONTACTED ME AHEAD OF TIME I    

00:12:36.694 --> 00:12:37.359
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF THE PROPERTY OWNER HAD

WOULD HAVE SAID VINYL IS        

00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:38.561

WOULD HAVE SAID VINYL IS        
INAPPROPRIATE AND JUST LEFT IT  

00:12:38.563 --> 00:12:46.403
WOULD HAVE SAID VINYL IS        
INAPPROPRIATE AND JUST LEFT IT  
AT THAT IT WOULD HAVE AND GOOD  

00:12:46.405 --> 00:12:47.403
INAPPROPRIATE AND JUST LEFT IT  
AT THAT IT WOULD HAVE AND GOOD  
ALSO AT THAT TIME TO FIND OUT

HAVE JUST REPAIRED A PHOBIA     
EXCITING WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

PROBABLY NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE  
IN A MORE APPROPRIATE CITING TO 
USE OVER OTHER SIDING WOULD BE  

00:13:13.432 --> 00:13:16.866
IN A MORE APPROPRIATE CITING TO 
USE OVER OTHER SIDING WOULD BE  
CEMENT OR TEISHA SIDING INSTEAD 

00:13:16.868 --> 00:13:20.136

CEMENT OR TEISHA SIDING INSTEAD

EXISTING RIDGE AND THEN IT      

00:57:27.783 --> 00:57:28.649

EXISTING RIDGE AND THEN IT      
BUMPS BACK UP WHEN YOU GET TO

THE TRIM MAKES IT LOOK A LITTLE 

00:57:31.286 --> 00:57:32.085

EVERYTHING ELSE.                

01:18:09.724 --> 01:18:10.456

EVERYTHING ELSE.                
RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAD ORIGINALLY 

01:18:10.458 --> 01:18:11.256
EVERYTHING ELSE.                
RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAD ORIGINALLY 
PLANNED AT THE STAIRS TO THE    

01:18:11.258 --> 01:18:11.924
RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAD ORIGINALLY 
PLANNED AT THE STAIRS TO THE

01:18:11.926 --> 01:18:12.591
PLANNED AT THE STAIRS TO THE

01:18:16.197 --> 01:18:16.996
THINKING.                       
WE COULD HAVE THE DRIVEWAY      
ALONG THE NORTH SIDE BUT ONCE   

01:18:16.998 --> 01:18:17.630
WE COULD HAVE THE DRIVEWAY      
ALONG THE NORTH SIDE BUT ONCE   
WE PUT THE STAIR TO THE NORTH   

01:18:17.632 --> 01:18:18.130
ALONG THE NORTH SIDE BUT ONCE   
WE PUT THE STAIR TO THE NORTH

SIDE PRECLUDED THAT.            
HOWEVER, IF YOU WANTED MORE     

01:18:20.434 --> 01:18:24.670
SIDE PRECLUDED THAT.            
HOWEVER, IF YOU WANTED MORE     
DRIVEWAY IT WOULD BE MORE THAN  

01:18:24.672 --> 01:18:25.504
HOWEVER, IF YOU WANTED MORE     
DRIVEWAY IT WOULD BE MORE THAN

RATE.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT&amp;apos;S   

01:33:19.066 --> 01:33:21.666
RATE.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT&amp;apos;S   
MAKING IT ALSO SEEM A LITTLE    

01:33:21.668 --> 01:33:26.104
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT&amp;apos;S   
MAKING IT ALSO SEEM A LITTLE    
BIT HIGHER RATED THAT LIFT THAT 

01:33:26.106 --> 01:33:26.871
MAKING IT ALSO SEEM A LITTLE    
BIT HIGHER RATED THAT LIFT THAT 
ROOF NOW APPEARS TO BE MUCH     

01:33:26.873 --> 01:33:29.640
BIT HIGHER RATED THAT LIFT THAT 
ROOF NOW APPEARS TO BE MUCH     
TALLER THAN THE ORIGINAL        

01:33:29.642 --> 01:33:30.375
ROOF NOW APPEARS TO BE MUCH     
TALLER THAN THE ORIGINAL        
STRUCTURE ALSO BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S     

01:33:30.377 --> 01:33:33.778
TALLER THAN THE ORIGINAL        
STRUCTURE ALSO BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S     
WITHIN A HEIGHT.                

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.982
STRUCTURE ALSO BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S     
WITHIN A HEIGHT.                
I&amp;apos;M JUST SAYING THAT IS BEING I 

01:33:36.984 --> 01:33:40.552
WITHIN A HEIGHT.                
I&amp;apos;M JUST SAYING THAT IS BEING I 
THINK THE MARZIN OVERALL SEEMS  

01:33:40.554 --> 01:33:41.652
I&amp;apos;M JUST SAYING THAT IS BEING I 
THINK THE MARZIN OVERALL SEEMS  
IT REALLY IS RIGHT AT THAT      

01:33:41.654 --> 01:33:44.722
THINK THE MARZIN OVERALL SEEMS  
IT REALLY IS RIGHT AT THAT      
FIFTY PERCENT BUT IT&amp;apos;S ALSO     

01:33:44.724 --> 01:33:45.757
IT REALLY IS RIGHT AT THAT      
FIFTY PERCENT BUT IT&amp;apos;S ALSO     
REALLY TAKING UP THAT IT&amp;apos;S NOT  

01:33:45.759 --> 01:33:49.193
FIFTY PERCENT BUT IT&amp;apos;S ALSO     
REALLY TAKING UP THAT IT&amp;apos;S NOT  
JUST THE ROOF.                  

01:33:49.195 --> 01:33:50.261
REALLY TAKING UP THAT IT&amp;apos;S NOT  
JUST THE ROOF.                  
THE ROOF THEN I THINK IS        

01:33:50.263 --> 01:33:53.331
JUST THE ROOF.                  
THE ROOF THEN I THINK IS        
APPRECIATED BUT THEN THE WALLS  

01:33:53.333 --> 01:33:56.802
THE ROOF THEN I THINK IS        
APPRECIATED BUT THEN THE WALLS  
DON&amp;apos;T ALSO KIND OF MAKE THAT    

01:33:56.804 --> 01:33:57.669
APPRECIATED BUT THEN THE WALLS  
DON&amp;apos;T ALSO KIND OF MAKE THAT    
HYPHEN THAT THAT THAT ONE IN    

01:33:57.671 --> 01:34:00.671
DON&amp;apos;T ALSO KIND OF MAKE THAT    
HYPHEN THAT THAT THAT ONE IN    
STEP AND THEN SO THE FOOTPRINT  

01:34:00.673 --> 01:34:03.775
HYPHEN THAT THAT THAT ONE IN    
STEP AND THEN SO THE FOOTPRINT  
IS A LARGE MASS BUT I DO        

01:34:03.777 --> 01:34:04.642
STEP AND THEN SO THE FOOTPRINT  
IS A LARGE MASS BUT I DO        
APPRECIATE THERE&amp;apos;S SOME DESIGN  

01:34:04.644 --> 01:34:05.310
IS A LARGE MASS BUT I DO        
APPRECIATE THERE&amp;apos;S SOME DESIGN  
ELEMENTS THAT ARE REALLY NICE   

01:34:05.312 --> 01:34:07.945
APPRECIATE THERE&amp;apos;S SOME DESIGN  
ELEMENTS THAT ARE REALLY NICE   
LIKE THAT THAT DORMER IS MADE   

01:34:07.947 --> 01:34:08.213
ELEMENTS THAT ARE REALLY NICE   
LIKE THAT THAT DORMER IS MADE   
SMALLER.                        

01:34:08.215 --> 01:34:09.280
LIKE THAT THAT DORMER IS MADE   
SMALLER.                        
SO IT&amp;apos;S TRYING TO MINIMIZE THAT 

01:34:09.282 --> 01:34:12.084
SMALLER.                        
SO IT&amp;apos;S TRYING TO MINIMIZE THAT 
THAT MASINO OVERALL.            

01:34:12.086 --> 01:34:13.084
SO IT&amp;apos;S TRYING TO MINIMIZE THAT 
THAT MASINO OVERALL.            
SO I THINK THAT THAT IS REALLY  

01:34:13.086 --> 01:34:13.485
THAT MASINO OVERALL.            
SO I THINK THAT THAT IS REALLY  
HELPFUL.                        

01:34:13.487 --> 01:34:16.955
SO I THINK THAT THAT IS REALLY  
HELPFUL.                        
UM, I JUST THINK IN GENERAL THE 

01:34:16.957 --> 01:34:20.758

BUT THEN THE DOOR IS MOVED TO   

01:47:50.803 --> 01:47:51.368
MAINTAINED AND IT&amp;apos;S POSITIONED  
BUT THEN THE DOOR IS MOVED TO   
THE OPPOSITE SIDE.

BUT THEN THE DOOR IS MOVED TO   
THE OPPOSITE SIDE.              
THAT TO ME WOULD BE A CHANGE IN

THE OPPOSITE SIDE.              
THAT TO ME WOULD BE A CHANGE IN

01:47:57.977 --> 01:47:58.842
THE GARAGE CONFIGURATION ITSELF 
.                               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OBVIOUSLY IF IT&amp;apos;S ROTATED    

01:47:58.844 --> 01:47:59.577
.                               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OBVIOUSLY IF IT&amp;apos;S ROTATED    
THAT&amp;apos;S ALSO A CHANGE IN THE     

01:47:59.579 --> 01:47:59.910
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OBVIOUSLY IF IT&amp;apos;S ROTATED

CONFIGURATION.                  

01:47:59.912 --> 01:48:01.645
THAT&amp;apos;S ALSO A CHANGE IN THE

BUT MORE ON THE OVERALL LEVEL   
TO THE SITE AS IT&amp;apos;S NOW NOT

THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND      

01:48:11.623 --> 01:48:12.956
FACING THE SAME DIRECTION AS    
THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND      
AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE

THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND      
AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE

02:10:00.497 --> 02:10:02.565
YEAH, WE&amp;apos;RE NOT GOING TO USE    
THE STANDARD SIZE, WE&amp;apos;RE GOING  
TO GO BIG AND ALSO THAT THESE   

02:10:02.567 --> 02:10:03.433
THE STANDARD SIZE, WE&amp;apos;RE GOING  
TO GO BIG AND ALSO THAT THESE   
THESE COLUMNS ARE A VERY UNIQUE 

02:10:03.435 --> 02:10:04.166
TO GO BIG AND ALSO THAT THESE

SQUARE CONCRETE MASONRY UNITS   

02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:06.301
EXAMPLE THAT I KNOW OF OF       
SQUARE CONCRETE MASONRY UNITS   
STACKED UP LIKE THAT OR USED    

02:10:06.303 --> 02:10:06.902
SQUARE CONCRETE MASONRY UNITS   
STACKED UP LIKE THAT OR USED    
ANYWHERE IN THE OLD ASIDE

TERMS OF SIZE FOR THESE         
CONCRETE BLOCKS.                
I ALSO FEEL LIKE THIS PIER HAS  

02:10:20.585 --> 02:10:23.920
