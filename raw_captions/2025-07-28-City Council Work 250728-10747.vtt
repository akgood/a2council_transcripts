DETAIL AROUND WHAT THOSE        
DIFFERENCES ARE THAT MADE THEM  
HIGH?                           

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:47.416
DIFFERENCES ARE THAT MADE THEM  
HIGH?                           
ARE THEY OFFERING THE EXACT     

00:59:47.418 --> 00:59:49.384
HIGH?

ARE THEY DIFFERENT THINGS?      

00:59:50.621 --> 00:59:51.486
SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES?        
ARE THEY DIFFERENT THINGS?      
BUT THEY BOTH MOVED THEM UP     

00:59:51.488 --> 00:59:53.721
ARE THEY DIFFERENT THINGS?      
BUT THEY BOTH MOVED THEM UP     
INTO THE NEXT CATEGORY, FOR     

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:53.989
BUT THEY BOTH MOVED THEM UP     
INTO THE NEXT CATEGORY, FOR     
EXAMPLE.

INTO THE NEXT CATEGORY, FOR     
EXAMPLE.                        
AND THEN I GUESS THIS IS        

00:59:54.792 --> 00:59:57.459
EXAMPLE.                        
AND THEN I GUESS THIS IS        
PROBABLY ALSO A QUESTION        

00:59:57.461 --> 00:59:58.193
AND THEN I GUESS THIS IS        
PROBABLY ALSO A QUESTION        
RELATED T THE PREVIOUS ONE.     

00:59:58.195 --> 00:59:59.060
PROBABLY ALSO A QUESTION        
RELATED T THE PREVIOUS ONE.     
THERE WERE SOME PRETTY WIDE     

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:01.696
RELATED T THE PREVIOUS ONE.     
THERE WERE SOME PRETTY WIDE     
RANGES IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS.  

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:02.831
THERE WERE SOME PRETTY WIDE     
RANGES IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS.  
DOES THAT ALSO RESULT IN A      

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:05.700
RANGES IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS.  
DOES THAT ALSO RESULT IN A      
PRETTY WIDE RANGE IN KIND       

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:06.567
DOES THAT ALSO RESULT IN A      
PRETTY WIDE RANGE IN KIND       
OF THE SCALE OF THE DESIGN THAT 

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:09.037
PRETTY WIDE RANGE IN KIND       
OF THE SCALE OF THE DESIGN THAT 
THEY ARE PROPOSING?             

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:13.308
OF THE SCALE OF THE DESIGN THAT 
THEY ARE PROPOSING?             
>> SO REGARDING ENVIRONMENT THE 

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.109
THEY ARE PROPOSING?             
>> SO REGARDING ENVIRONMENT THE 
SUSTAINABILITY PIECE, WE WILL   

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.845
>> SO REGARDING ENVIRONMENT THE 
SUSTAINABILITY PIECE, WE WILL   
GET MORE CLARIFICATION ON THAT  

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:17.979
SUSTAINABILITY PIECE, WE WILL   
GET MORE CLARIFICATION ON THAT  
AS THE ANALYSIS GETS MORE FINE  

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:24.318
GET MORE CLARIFICATION ON THAT  
AS THE ANALYSIS GETS MORE FINE  
TUNED REGARDING UNIT NUMBERS.   

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.119
AS THE ANALYSIS GETS MORE FINE  
TUNED REGARDING UNIT NUMBERS.   
WHAT WHAT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT   

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:28.723
TUNED REGARDING UNIT NUMBERS.   
WHAT WHAT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT   
THAT ABOUT THE SO WE GET MORE   

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:29.524
WHAT WHAT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT   
THAT ABOUT THE SO WE GET MORE   
OF A DESIGN TO KNOW UNDERSTAND

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:36.498
THE DESIGN.                     
SO I GUESS THINKING BETWEEN TWO 
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO UNITS   

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.232
SO I GUESS THINKING BETWEEN TWO 
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO UNITS

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:40.695
I WAS GOING TO SAY USUALLY      
YOU'LL SEE THAT SOMEWHAT IN     
LINE WITH THE AMOUNT OF UNITS   

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:41.296
YOU'LL SEE THAT SOMEWHAT IN     
LINE WITH THE AMOUNT OF UNITS   
THEY PLAN TO BUILD.             

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:42.097
LINE WITH THE AMOUNT OF UNITS   
THEY PLAN TO BUILD.             
YEAH BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME 

01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:44.832
THEY PLAN TO BUILD.             
YEAH BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME 
VARIATION STILL BUT THAT'S EVEN 

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:45.567
YEAH BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME 
VARIATION STILL BUT THAT'S EVEN 
MORE THAT'S MORE THAN ONE SPACE 

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:49.171
VARIATION STILL BUT THAT'S EVEN 
MORE THAT'S MORE THAN ONE SPACE 
PER UNIT WHICH IS A TREND AWAY  

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:49.838
MORE THAT'S MORE THAN ONE SPACE 
PER UNIT WHICH IS A TREND AWAY  
FROM WHAT WE ARE SEEING         

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.073
PER UNIT WHICH IS A TREND AWAY  
FROM WHAT WE ARE SEEING         
ESPECIALLY IN FOR DEVELOPMENT   

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:55.777
FROM WHAT WE ARE SEEING

WE ARE SEEING POINT SIX SIX AS  
A TREND.                        
SO THIS IS MORE THAN ONE PER    

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:03.518
A TREND.                        
SO THIS IS MORE THAN ONE PER    
UNIT.                           

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.418
SO THIS IS MORE THAN ONE PER    
UNIT.                           
THE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY     

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.522

FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNITS    
YOU'RE GOING TO BE PHYSICALLY   
LARGER THAN A TWO HUNDRED AND   

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:26.527
YOU'RE GOING TO BE PHYSICALLY

THEY'RE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO    
OUR CITIES GOALS AROUND

REALLY COMES DOWN TO TWO THINGS 

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:14.327
MCCAMBRIDGE BE BAD BUT IT       
REALLY COMES DOWN TO TWO THINGS 
FIRST, MOST PEDESTRIAN LIKE     

01:42:14.329 --> 01:42:16.695
REALLY COMES DOWN TO TWO THINGS 
FIRST, MOST PEDESTRIAN LIKE     
BRIDGES LIKE THIS OR SIMPLY NOT 

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:17.429
FIRST, MOST PEDESTRIAN LIKE     
BRIDGES LIKE THIS OR SIMPLY NOT 
CONVENIENT TO USE BECAUSE YOU   

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:19.965
BRIDGES LIKE THIS OR SIMPLY NOT 
CONVENIENT TO USE BECAUSE YOU   
HAVE TO CLIMB UP AND THEN BACK  

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:20.633
CONVENIENT TO USE BECAUSE YOU   
HAVE TO CLIMB UP AND THEN BACK  
DOWN AND TRAVEL LONGER          

01:42:20.635 --> 01:42:21.433
HAVE TO CLIMB UP AND THEN BACK  
DOWN AND TRAVEL LONGER          
DISTANCES JUST TO GET ACROSS    

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:21.767
DOWN AND TRAVEL LONGER          
DISTANCES JUST TO GET ACROSS    
THE ROAD.                       

01:42:21.769 --> 01:42:24.537
DISTANCES JUST TO GET ACROSS    
THE ROAD.                       
AND SECOND, THE SIGNAL THAT     

01:42:24.539 --> 01:42:25.204
THE ROAD.                       
AND SECOND, THE SIGNAL THAT     
WE'RE SURRENDERING THE GROUND   

01:42:25.206 --> 01:42:28.274
AND SECOND, THE SIGNAL THAT     
WE'RE SURRENDERING THE GROUND   
LEVEL TO BE DOMINATED BY HIGH   

01:42:28.276 --> 01:42:29.141
WE'RE SURRENDERING THE GROUND   
LEVEL TO BE DOMINATED BY HIGH   
SPEED CAR TRAFFIC AND THAT GETS 

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:31.744
LEVEL TO BE DOMINATED BY HIGH   
SPEED CAR TRAFFIC AND THAT GETS 
REALLY PERNICIOUS BECAUSE       

01:42:31.746 --> 01:42:32.611
SPEED CAR TRAFFIC AND THAT GETS 
REALLY PERNICIOUS BECAUSE       
PROMOTES AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT. 

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:33.445
REALLY PERNICIOUS BECAUSE       
PROMOTES AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT. 
BUT PEOPLE WALKING BIKING WILL  

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:36.715
PROMOTES AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT. 
BUT PEOPLE WALKING BIKING WILL  
STILL CROSS THE ROAD AT GROUND  

01:42:36.717 --> 01:42:40.386
BUT PEOPLE WALKING BIKING WILL  
STILL CROSS THE ROAD AT GROUND  
LEVEL BECAUSE IT ARE CONVENIENT 

01:42:40.388 --> 01:42:40.853
STILL CROSS THE ROAD AT GROUND  
LEVEL BECAUSE IT ARE CONVENIENT 
TO DO IT THAT WAY.              

01:42:40.855 --> 01:42:42.054
LEVEL BECAUSE IT ARE CONVENIENT 
TO DO IT THAT WAY.              
THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB UP AND 

01:42:42.056 --> 01:42:43.922
TO DO IT THAT WAY.              
THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB UP AND 
OVER CAN WE DO A REAL SERIOUS   

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:44.623
THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB UP AND 
OVER CAN WE DO A REAL SERIOUS   
SAFETY PROBLEMS IN THAT AREA?   

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:47.693
OVER CAN WE DO A REAL SERIOUS   
SAFETY PROBLEMS IN THAT AREA?   
YOU MEAN YOUR SUMMIT AND DPO?   

01:42:47.695 --> 01:42:48.761
SAFETY PROBLEMS IN THAT AREA?   
YOU MEAN YOUR SUMMIT AND DPO?   
IT'S A BIG BRIGHT HOT SPOT ON   

01:42:48.763 --> 01:42:51.497
YOU MEAN YOUR SUMMIT AND DPO?   
IT'S A BIG BRIGHT HOT SPOT ON   
THE CITIES MAP SO IT REALLY     

01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:52.365
IT'S A BIG BRIGHT HOT SPOT ON   
THE CITIES MAP SO IT REALLY     
URGENTLY NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE 

01:42:52.367 --> 01:42:54.433
THE CITIES MAP SO IT REALLY     
URGENTLY NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE 
IS TO MAKE THE ROAD AND THOSE   

01:42:54.435 --> 01:42:55.134
URGENTLY NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE 
IS TO MAKE THE ROAD AND THOSE   
INTERSECTIONS SAFE FOR ALL      

01:42:55.136 --> 01:42:59.004
IS TO MAKE THE ROAD AND THOSE   
INTERSECTIONS SAFE FOR ALL      
USERS AND I KNOW THE CITY IS    

01:42:59.006 --> 01:42:59.805
INTERSECTIONS SAFE FOR ALL      
USERS AND I KNOW THE CITY IS    
PURSUING A CITY ON THIS RIGHT   

01:42:59.807 --> 01:43:00.405
USERS AND I KNOW THE CITY IS    
PURSUING A CITY ON THIS RIGHT   
NOW AS WEALTH AND THAT          

01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:03.542
PURSUING A CITY ON THIS RIGHT   
NOW AS WEALTH AND THAT          
JURISDICTION TRANSFERS A STEP   

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:04.543
NOW AS WEALTH AND THAT          
JURISDICTION TRANSFERS A STEP   
IN THE WORKS BUT THAT HAS TO BE 

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:06.378
JURISDICTION TRANSFERS A STEP   
IN THE WORKS BUT THAT HAS TO BE 
THE PRIORITY AND THIS           

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:10.015
IN THE WORKS BUT THAT HAS TO BE 
THE PRIORITY AND THIS           
CONVERSATION ALSO NEEDS TO BE   

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:10.949
THE PRIORITY AND THIS           
CONVERSATION ALSO NEEDS TO BE   
ABOUT NOT MAKING A SINGLE       

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:11.717
CONVERSATION ALSO NEEDS TO BE   
ABOUT NOT MAKING A SINGLE       
LINEAR TRAIL THAT GETS YOU FROM 

01:43:11.719 --> 01:43:14.887
ABOUT NOT MAKING A SINGLE       
LINEAR TRAIL THAT GETS YOU FROM 
ONE POINT TO ONE OTHER POINT    

01:43:14.889 --> 01:43:15.754
LINEAR TRAIL THAT GETS YOU FROM 
ONE POINT TO ONE OTHER POINT    
BUT A CONNECTED NETWORK OF SAFE 

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:18.491
ONE POINT TO ONE OTHER POINT    
BUT A CONNECTED NETWORK OF SAFE 
BIKING AND WALKING ROUTES.      

01:43:18.493 --> 01:43:19.625
BUT A CONNECTED NETWORK OF SAFE 
BIKING AND WALKING ROUTES.      
AND SO YEAH, THE ONLY CONTEXT   

01:43:19.627 --> 01:43:22.227
BIKING AND WALKING ROUTES.      
AND SO YEAH, THE ONLY CONTEXT   
IN WHICH I'D SEE THIS SEGMENT   

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:23.095
AND SO YEAH, THE ONLY CONTEXT   
IN WHICH I'D SEE THIS SEGMENT   
AS BEING MAYBE CONVENIENT WOULD 

01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:26.632
IN WHICH I'D SEE THIS SEGMENT   
AS BEING MAYBE CONVENIENT WOULD 
BE TAKING IT FROM MS END FROM   

01:43:26.634 --> 01:43:27.333
AS BEING MAYBE CONVENIENT WOULD 
BE TAKING IT FROM MS END FROM   
THE HARBOR PATH 741 NORTHMEN    

01:43:27.335 --> 01:43:29.534
BE TAKING IT FROM MS END FROM   
THE HARBOR PATH 741 NORTHMEN    
AND I HAVE DOUBTS EVEN ABOUT    

01:43:29.536 --> 01:43:29.869
THE HARBOR PATH 741 NORTHMEN    
AND I HAVE DOUBTS EVEN ABOUT    
THAT.                           

01:43:29.871 --> 01:43:30.769
AND I HAVE DOUBTS EVEN ABOUT    
THAT.                           
YOU KNOW THE 180 DEGREE CHANGE  

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:33.606
THAT.                           
YOU KNOW THE 180 DEGREE CHANGE  
THAT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM.    

01:43:33.608 --> 01:43:34.640
YOU KNOW THE 180 DEGREE CHANGE  
THAT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM.    
THE 90 DEGREE TURN AT THE       

01:43:34.642 --> 01:43:37.142
THAT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM.    
THE 90 DEGREE TURN AT THE       
BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL IS ALREADY 

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:37.576
THE 90 DEGREE TURN AT THE       
BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL IS ALREADY 
BAD ENOUGH.                     

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:38.711
BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL IS ALREADY 
BAD ENOUGH.                     
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IF WE    

01:43:38.713 --> 01:43:41.914
BAD ENOUGH.                     
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IF WE    
COULD FIX A FEW MISSING LINKS   

01:43:41.916 --> 01:43:44.951
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IF WE    
COULD FIX A FEW MISSING LINKS   
AT GROUND LEVEL CROSSING MAIN   

01:43:44.953 --> 01:43:45.951
COULD FIX A FEW MISSING LINKS   
AT GROUND LEVEL CROSSING MAIN

01:43:45.953 --> 01:43:46.752
AT GROUND LEVEL CROSSING MAIN
