THE AERIAL MAP, IT LOOKS TO ME  
LIKE THERE ARE ALREADY AT LEAST 

00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:50.446
THE AERIAL MAP, IT LOOKS TO ME  
LIKE THERE ARE ALREADY AT LEAST 
THREE PARCELS TO THE EAST THAT  

00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:51.280
LIKE THERE ARE ALREADY AT LEAST 
THREE PARCELS TO THE EAST THAT  
WOULD ALSO BE NONCONFORMING IN  

00:08:51.282 --> 00:08:54.651
THREE PARCELS TO THE EAST THAT  
WOULD ALSO BE NONCONFORMING IN  
TERMS OF THEIR SQUARE FOOTAGE.  

00:08:54.653 --> 00:08:55.651
WOULD ALSO BE NONCONFORMING IN  
TERMS OF THEIR SQUARE FOOTAGE.  
IS THAT NOT CORRECT OR ARE      

00:08:55.653 --> 00:08:58.788
TERMS OF THEIR SQUARE FOOTAGE.  
IS THAT NOT CORRECT OR ARE      
THOSE JUST THE WAY THEY'RE      

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.322
IS THAT NOT CORRECT OR ARE      
THOSE JUST THE WAY THEY'RE      
CONFIGURED?                     

00:08:59.324 --> 00:09:02.258
THOSE JUST THE WAY THEY'RE      
CONFIGURED?                     
THEY'RE STILL TEN THOUSAND      

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:02.658
CONFIGURED?                     
THEY'RE STILL TEN THOUSAND      
SQUARE FEET.                    

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.559
THEY'RE STILL TEN THOUSAND      
SQUARE FEET.                    
THEY'RE WHICH ONES TO THE WEST  

00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:06.796
SQUARE FEET.                    
THEY'RE WHICH ONES TO THE WEST

LOOK AT THE SLIDE ON THE        

00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:10.532
SLIDE.                          
LOOK AT THE SLIDE ON THE        
SCREEN, THE SCREEN YOUR MONITOR 

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:13.936
LOOK AT THE SLIDE ON THE

TO THE RIGHT TO THESE I THINK   

00:09:13.938 --> 00:09:17.306
SCREEN, THE SCREEN YOUR MONITOR 
TO THE RIGHT TO THESE I THINK   
SO THERE'S THE ONE TWO TWO OVER

GO THE ENTIRE THIS RIGHT HERE   

00:09:26.084 --> 00:09:26.882
SHORT ONE THE ONE THAT DOESN'T  
GO THE ENTIRE THIS RIGHT HERE   
THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S NOT TEN  

00:09:26.884 --> 00:09:29.686
GO THE ENTIRE THIS RIGHT HERE   
THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S NOT TEN  
THOUSAND RIGHT FEET AND THEN IF 

00:09:29.688 --> 00:09:30.553
THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S NOT TEN  
THOUSAND RIGHT FEET AND THEN IF 
YOU GO ALL THE WAY THERE ARE    

00:09:30.555 --> 00:09:33.623
THOUSAND RIGHT FEET AND THEN IF

00:09:41.098 --> 00:09:41.530
THERE'S AN EXISTING             
NONCONFORMING LOT SURROUNDING   
IT.                             

00:09:41.532 --> 00:09:41.797
NONCONFORMING LOT SURROUNDING   
IT.                             
RIGHT?

WONDER                          

00:10:02.152 --> 00:10:04.820
       IS IF THERE IS SOMETHING 
THAT IS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN TEN  
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IF IT      

00:10:04.822 --> 00:10:05.488
THAT IS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN TEN  
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IF IT      
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT          

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:06.155
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IF IT      
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT          
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANTLY         

00:10:06.157 --> 00:10:06.890
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT          
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANTLY         
DIFFERENT THAN EVERYTHING ELSE  

00:10:06.892 --> 00:10:07.690
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANTLY         
DIFFERENT THAN EVERYTHING ELSE  
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT IT   

00:10:07.692 --> 00:10:08.490
DIFFERENT THAN EVERYTHING ELSE  
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT IT

IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT IT   
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THERE ARE SOME 
ALREADY SOME LIGHTS THERE THAT  

00:10:09.227 --> 00:10:09.959
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THERE ARE SOME 
ALREADY SOME LIGHTS THERE THAT  
ARE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND      

00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:10.660
ALREADY SOME LIGHTS THERE THAT  
ARE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND      
SQUARE FEET AND THE STRUCTURES  

00:10:10.662 --> 00:10:11.394
ARE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND      
SQUARE FEET AND THE STRUCTURES  
CLEARLY BUILT BEFORE THE ZONING 

00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:12.128
SQUARE FEET AND THE STRUCTURES  
CLEARLY BUILT BEFORE THE ZONING 
CODE WAS WHAT IT WAS ARE THE    

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.795
CLEARLY BUILT BEFORE THE ZONING 
CODE WAS WHAT IT WAS ARE THE    
THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY NOT         

00:10:12.797 --> 00:10:15.731
CODE WAS WHAT IT WAS ARE THE    
THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY NOT         
CONFORMING LOST THE STRUCTURE.  

00:10:15.733 --> 00:10:16.265
THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY NOT         
CONFORMING LOST THE STRUCTURE.  
THAT'S CORRECT.                 

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:16.466

00:10:37.522 --> 00:10:38.320
WONDERED IF YOU KNEW THEY WERE  
ESTABLISHED PROBABLY ONE        
HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND THEN THE  

00:10:38.322 --> 00:10:41.256
ESTABLISHED PROBABLY ONE        
HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND THEN THE  
ZONING ARTIST COME INTO EFFECT  

00:10:41.258 --> 00:10:41.925
HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND THEN THE  
ZONING ARTIST COME INTO EFFECT  
ENFORCED PROBABLY ABOUT MID 60S 

00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:44.860
ZONING ARTIST COME INTO EFFECT  
ENFORCED PROBABLY ABOUT MID 60S 
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE.

NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE.            
SO THEY WERE ALREADY            

00:10:45.563 --> 00:10:47.764
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE.            
SO THEY WERE ALREADY            
ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO THE

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:11.153
MY FAMILIARITY WITH THIS        
NEIGHBORHOOD I REMEMBER LACK    
OF SIDEWALKS AND SO ON SOME     

00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:11.921
NEIGHBORHOOD I REMEMBER LACK    
OF SIDEWALKS AND SO ON SOME     
OF THESE STREETS IS THAT DO YOU 

00:11:11.923 --> 00:11:15.157
OF SIDEWALKS AND SO ON SOME     
OF THESE STREETS IS THAT DO YOU 
KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS A    

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:15.858
OF THESE STREETS IS THAT DO YOU 
KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS A

KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS A    
SIDEWALK SITUATION ON YOU?      
IT IS THERE THERE WERE NOT      

00:11:18.729 --> 00:11:19.395
SIDEWALK SITUATION ON YOU?      
IT IS THERE THERE WERE NOT      
SIDEWALKS ESTABLISHED WHEN I    

00:11:19.397 --> 00:11:20.229
IT IS THERE THERE WERE NOT      
SIDEWALKS ESTABLISHED WHEN I    
WAS OUT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE   

00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:23.399
SIDEWALKS ESTABLISHED WHEN I    
WAS OUT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE   
THAT ON THE STEREO ON THAT AREA
