SO ON NO DECENT I TALKED ABOUT  
WAS YOU KNOW, FOR PROJECTS SUCH 
AS A LARGE MURAL DOWNTOWN, YOU  

01:19:12.768 --> 01:19:15.101
WAS YOU KNOW, FOR PROJECTS SUCH 
AS A LARGE MURAL DOWNTOWN, YOU  
KNOW, A BUDGET FOR THAT CAN BE  

01:19:15.103 --> 01:19:16.003
AS A LARGE MURAL DOWNTOWN, YOU  
KNOW, A BUDGET FOR THAT CAN BE  
,YOU KNOW, ANYWHERE BETWEEN     

01:19:16.005 --> 01:19:16.670
KNOW, A BUDGET FOR THAT CAN BE  
,YOU KNOW, ANYWHERE BETWEEN     
TWENTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED     

01:19:16.672 --> 01:19:19.406
,YOU KNOW, ANYWHERE BETWEEN     
TWENTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED     
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THERE IS   

01:19:19.408 --> 01:19:20.140
TWENTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED     
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THERE IS   
DEFINITELY A WAY TO ADD PUBLIC  

01:19:20.142 --> 01:19:23.843
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THERE IS   
DEFINITELY A WAY TO ADD PUBLIC  
ART TO THIS TO THIS IN A WAY    

01:19:23.845 --> 01:19:24.478
DEFINITELY A WAY TO ADD PUBLIC  
ART TO THIS TO THIS IN A WAY    
THAT IS REALLY SUBSTANTIVE.     

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.781

ARE LESS THAN A THOUSAND        
DOLLARS EACH.                   
SO I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK   

01:19:32.788 --> 01:19:35.088
DOLLARS EACH.                   
SO I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK   
AT IT HOLISTICALLY AND SAY THIS 

01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.956

SUPER PRESCRIPTIVE AROUND       
MEETING A DOLLAR AMOUNT, YOU    
GET MORE CREATIVE MINDS TO      

01:19:39.362 --> 01:19:40.160
MEETING A DOLLAR AMOUNT, YOU    
GET MORE CREATIVE MINDS TO      
CONTRIBUTE TO IT AND TO SORT    

01:19:40.162 --> 01:19:42.195
GET MORE CREATIVE MINDS TO      
CONTRIBUTE TO IT AND TO SORT    
OF FIGURE IT OUT.               

01:19:42.197 --> 01:19:43.530
CONTRIBUTE TO IT AND TO SORT    
OF FIGURE IT OUT.               
WHAT I LIKE TO SEE THIS BUDGET  

01:19:43.532 --> 01:19:46.533
OF FIGURE IT OUT.               
WHAT I LIKE TO SEE THIS BUDGET  
BE HIGHER OF COURSE.            

01:19:46.535 --> 01:19:50.437
WHAT I LIKE TO SEE THIS BUDGET  
BE HIGHER OF COURSE.            
OF COURSE I WOULD BECAUSE I DO  

01:19:50.439 --> 01:19:51.138
BE HIGHER OF COURSE.            
OF COURSE I WOULD BECAUSE I DO  
OBVIOUSLY GIVEN MY WORK VALUE   

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.506
OF COURSE I WOULD BECAUSE I DO  
OBVIOUSLY GIVEN MY WORK VALUE   
ART A LOT.

OBVIOUSLY GIVEN MY WORK VALUE   
ART A LOT.                      
BUT I THINK IF IF WE'RE TALKING 

01:19:54.676 --> 01:19:57.978
ART A LOT.

COULD SOMEONE SPEAK TO THAT?    

02:30:53.998 --> 02:30:58.134
PLACES?                         
COULD SOMEONE SPEAK TO THAT?    
IS THAT A QUESTION FOR STAFF OR 

02:30:58.136 --> 02:30:58.935

02:31:06.577 --> 02:31:07.243
WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS

AND SO THE QUESTION MIGHT BE    

02:31:07.245 --> 02:31:08.044

AND SO THE QUESTION MIGHT BE    
BEST DIRECTED.

A FAST TRACK APPROVAL PROCESS   
THAT PRIORITIZE DEVELOPMENTS

DOES NOT MENTION ENERGY         
EFFICIENCY.                     
I'M JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHY, 

02:31:49.955 --> 02:31:55.792
EFFICIENCY.                     
I'M JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHY,

CERTAINLY THANK YOU MAYOR PRO   
TEM.                            
I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT WE     

02:32:03.067 --> 02:32:07.369
TEM.                            
I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT WE     
WOULD BE CREATING FAST TRACKING 

02:32:07.371 --> 02:32:08.304
I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT WE     
WOULD BE CREATING FAST TRACKING 
FOR ONLY THE FULLY ELECTRIFIED  

02:32:08.306 --> 02:32:11.707
WOULD BE CREATING FAST TRACKING 
FOR ONLY THE FULLY ELECTRIFIED  
DEVELOPMENTS BUT THERE WOULD BE 

02:32:11.709 --> 02:32:15.745
FOR ONLY THE FULLY ELECTRIFIED  
DEVELOPMENTS BUT THERE WOULD BE 
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE     

02:32:15.747 --> 02:32:16.612
DEVELOPMENTS BUT THERE WOULD BE 
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE     
ALSO IDENTIFIED AS BEING ENERGY 

02:32:16.614 --> 02:32:19.782
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE     
ALSO IDENTIFIED AS BEING ENERGY 
EFFICIENT WOULD HAVE I BELIEVE  

02:32:19.784 --> 02:32:20.616
ALSO IDENTIFIED AS BEING ENERGY 
EFFICIENT WOULD HAVE I BELIEVE  
IT'S A FEE WAIVER IS WHAT'S     

02:32:20.618 --> 02:32:23.285
EFFICIENT WOULD HAVE I BELIEVE  
IT'S A FEE WAIVER IS WHAT'S     
EXPLORED IN THE RESOLUTION.     

02:32:23.287 --> 02:32:24.187
IT'S A FEE WAIVER IS WHAT'S     
EXPLORED IN THE RESOLUTION.     
SO WE'RE WHAT FORGIVE ME FOR    

02:32:24.189 --> 02:32:27.356
EXPLORED IN THE RESOLUTION.     
SO WE'RE WHAT FORGIVE ME FOR    
NOT BEING COMPLETELY DETAILED   

02:32:27.358 --> 02:32:28.057
SO WE'RE WHAT FORGIVE ME FOR    
NOT BEING COMPLETELY DETAILED   
ON THE AMENDMENT BUT THE IDEA   

02:32:28.059 --> 02:32:31.294
NOT BEING COMPLETELY DETAILED   
ON THE AMENDMENT BUT THE IDEA   
IS TO SEPARATE THOSE TWO IDEAS  

02:32:31.296 --> 02:32:32.094
ON THE AMENDMENT BUT THE IDEA   
IS TO SEPARATE THOSE TWO IDEAS  
ESSENTIALLY RANK ORDER THEM AND 

02:32:32.096 --> 02:32:32.895
IS TO SEPARATE THOSE TWO IDEAS  
ESSENTIALLY RANK ORDER THEM AND 
PROVIDE MORE BENEFIT TO ONE IN  

02:32:32.897 --> 02:32:37.300
ESSENTIALLY RANK ORDER THEM AND 
PROVIDE MORE BENEFIT TO ONE IN  
LESS BENEFIT TO THE OTHER.      

02:32:37.302 --> 02:32:38.301
PROVIDE MORE BENEFIT TO ONE IN  
LESS BENEFIT TO THE OTHER.      
I GUESS I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING   

02:32:38.303 --> 02:32:41.470
LESS BENEFIT TO THE OTHER.      
I GUESS I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING   
WHY WE'RE PRIORITIZE THING      

02:32:41.472 --> 02:32:42.205
