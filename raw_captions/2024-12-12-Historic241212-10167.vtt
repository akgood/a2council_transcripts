00:22:13.554 --> 00:22:17.122
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN A  
THREE CAR GARAGE PROPOSED IN    
THE HISTORIC DISTRICT EXCEPT    

00:22:17.124 --> 00:22:18.057
THREE CAR GARAGE PROPOSED IN    
THE HISTORIC DISTRICT EXCEPT    
EXCEPT TANDEM ONES WERE THERE   

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:21.293
THE HISTORIC DISTRICT EXCEPT    
EXCEPT TANDEM ONES WERE THERE   
IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER BUT      

00:22:21.295 --> 00:22:22.093
EXCEPT TANDEM ONES WERE THERE   
IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER BUT      
AGAIN WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE     

00:22:22.095 --> 00:22:22.795
IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER BUT      
AGAIN WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE     
EXISTING DRIVEWAY THERE AND     

00:22:22.797 --> 00:22:25.197
AGAIN WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE     
EXISTING DRIVEWAY THERE AND     
PULLING IN FROM A SIDE LOAD     

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:28.867
EXISTING DRIVEWAY THERE AND     
PULLING IN FROM A SIDE LOAD     
MAKES SENSE AND IN THAT CASE I  

00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:29.635
PULLING IN FROM A SIDE LOAD     
MAKES SENSE AND IN THAT CASE I  
DON'T THINK IT MAKES A BIGGER   

00:22:29.637 --> 00:22:33.138
MAKES SENSE AND IN THAT CASE I  
DON'T THINK IT MAKES A BIGGER   
IMPACT HISTORICALLY TO MAKE THE 

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.542
DON'T THINK IT MAKES A BIGGER   
IMPACT HISTORICALLY TO MAKE THE 
BUILDING FIVE FEET OR EVEN TEN  

00:22:36.544 --> 00:22:37.475
IMPACT HISTORICALLY TO MAKE THE 
BUILDING FIVE FEET OR EVEN TEN  
FEET OR FIFTEEN FEET SHORTER    

00:22:37.477 --> 00:22:38.310
BUILDING FIVE FEET OR EVEN TEN  
FEET OR FIFTEEN FEET SHORTER    
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING IT  

00:22:38.312 --> 00:22:40.946
FEET OR FIFTEEN FEET SHORTER    
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING IT  
A CUBE INSTEAD OF A DEEPER      

00:22:40.948 --> 00:22:44.583
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING IT  
A CUBE INSTEAD OF A DEEPER      
RECTANGLE.                      

00:22:44.585 --> 00:22:48.787
A CUBE INSTEAD OF A DEEPER      
RECTANGLE.                      
THE DESIGN COMPATABILITY I CAN

RECTANGLE.                      
THE DESIGN COMPATABILITY I CAN  
THINK OF PROS AND CONS FOR I    

00:22:52.526 --> 00:22:56.761
THE DESIGN COMPATABILITY I CAN  
THINK OF PROS AND CONS FOR I    
THINK THAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN   

00:22:56.763 --> 00:22:57.429
THINK OF PROS AND CONS FOR I    
THINK THAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN   
ABOUT WHETHER IT MEETS THE      

00:22:57.431 --> 00:22:58.263
THINK THAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN   
ABOUT WHETHER IT MEETS THE      
STANDARDS GUIDELINES ARE DESIGN 

00:22:58.265 --> 00:22:59.999
ABOUT WHETHER IT MEETS THE      
STANDARDS GUIDELINES ARE DESIGN

ELEMENTS LIKE THIS BIG          
WRAPAROUND GALLERY.             
I THINK IT MAKES THE BUILDING   

00:23:03.504 --> 00:23:04.536
WRAPAROUND GALLERY.             
I THINK IT MAKES THE BUILDING   
LOOK A LOT BIGGER THAN IT WOULD 

00:23:04.538 --> 00:23:08.373
I THINK IT MAKES THE BUILDING   
LOOK A LOT BIGGER THAN IT WOULD 
IF AT LEAST THIS SIDE HAD, YOU  

00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:11.243
LOOK A LOT BIGGER THAN IT WOULD 
IF AT LEAST THIS SIDE HAD, YOU  
KNOW, A SMALLER ATTACHED TO THE

IF AT LEAST THIS SIDE HAD, YOU  
KNOW, A SMALLER ATTACHED TO THE 
WALL OVERHANG INSTEAD           

00:23:11.878 --> 00:23:14.613
KNOW, A SMALLER ATTACHED TO THE 
WALL OVERHANG INSTEAD           
OF SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO   

00:23:14.615 --> 00:23:15.413
WALL OVERHANG INSTEAD           
OF SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO   
ACTUALLY MANEUVER AROUND WITH   

00:23:15.415 --> 00:23:19.284
OF SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO   
ACTUALLY MANEUVER AROUND WITH   
YOUR VEHICLE AND THE SIDE I     

00:23:19.286 --> 00:23:22.754
ACTUALLY MANEUVER AROUND WITH   
YOUR VEHICLE AND THE SIDE I     
DON'T THINK IS SO BAD BECAUSE   

00:23:22.756 --> 00:23:23.788
YOUR VEHICLE AND THE SIDE I     
DON'T THINK IS SO BAD BECAUSE   
IT'S VERY USABLE AND IT'S IN    

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.658
DON'T THINK IS SO BAD BECAUSE   
IT'S VERY USABLE AND IT'S IN    
IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE 

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.392
IT'S VERY USABLE AND IT'S IN    
IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE 
BUILDING LOOK ANY BIGGER FROM   

00:23:27.394 --> 00:23:28.193
IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE 
BUILDING LOOK ANY BIGGER FROM   
THE STREET BECAUSE IT'S IT'S    

00:23:28.195 --> 00:23:30.095
BUILDING LOOK ANY BIGGER FROM   
THE STREET BECAUSE IT'S IT'S    
ALIGNED THE FRONT OF THE        

00:23:30.097 --> 00:23:31.096
THE STREET BECAUSE IT'S IT'S    
ALIGNED THE FRONT OF THE        
BUILDING ALSO GREAT FOR THE     

00:23:31.098 --> 00:23:34.466
ALIGNED THE FRONT OF THE        
BUILDING ALSO GREAT FOR THE     
PEOPLE WHO LIVE UPSTAIRS TO     

00:23:34.468 --> 00:23:35.200
BUILDING ALSO GREAT FOR THE     
PEOPLE WHO LIVE UPSTAIRS TO     
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE SHELTER  

00:23:35.202 --> 00:23:37.169
PEOPLE WHO LIVE UPSTAIRS TO     
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE SHELTER  
DOWN HERE WHEN THEY'RE CARRYING 

00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:40.805
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE SHELTER  
DOWN HERE WHEN THEY'RE CARRYING 
THEIR GROCERIES UP.             

00:23:40.807 --> 00:23:44.810
DOWN HERE WHEN THEY'RE CARRYING 
THEIR GROCERIES UP.             
SO SO DESIGN WISE IT'S IT'S     

00:23:44.812 --> 00:23:45.510
THEIR GROCERIES UP.             
SO SO DESIGN WISE IT'S IT'S     
IT'S A STRETCH.                 

00:23:45.512 --> 00:23:49.181
SO SO DESIGN WISE IT'S IT'S     
IT'S A STRETCH.                 
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE THE ROLE  

00:23:49.183 --> 00:23:50.182
IT'S A STRETCH.                 
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE THE ROLE  
OF THE ATTACK IS NOT TO DECIDE  

00:23:50.184 --> 00:23:53.418
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE THE ROLE  
OF THE ATTACK IS NOT TO DECIDE  
WHETHER OR NOT THEY LIKE IT.    

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.252
OF THE ATTACK IS NOT TO DECIDE  
WHETHER OR NOT THEY LIKE IT.    
IT'S DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S 

00:23:54.254 --> 00:23:54.786
WHETHER OR NOT THEY LIKE IT.    
IT'S DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S 
COMPATIBLE WITH THE             

00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:57.455
IT'S DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S 
COMPATIBLE WITH THE             
NEIGHBORHOOD AND BY A SLIM      

00:23:57.457 --> 00:24:01.559
COMPATIBLE WITH THE             
NEIGHBORHOOD AND BY A SLIM      
MARGIN I STAFF AT LEAST BELIEVE 

00:24:01.561 --> 00:24:04.796
NEIGHBORHOOD AND BY A SLIM      
MARGIN I STAFF AT LEAST BELIEVE 
THAT THAT IT IS COMPATIBLE      

00:24:04.798 --> 00:24:05.597
MARGIN I STAFF AT LEAST BELIEVE 
THAT THAT IT IS COMPATIBLE      
THOUGH THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME  

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:08.800
THAT THAT IT IS COMPATIBLE      
THOUGH THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME  
SMALL THINGS THAT COULD BE MADE 

00:24:08.802 --> 00:24:09.868
THOUGH THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME  
SMALL THINGS THAT COULD BE MADE 
ON TO MAKE IT MORE COMPATIBLE   

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:10.568
SMALL THINGS THAT COULD BE MADE 
ON TO MAKE IT MORE COMPATIBLE   
LIKE REMOVING THIS COLONNADE ON 

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.938
ON TO MAKE IT MORE COMPATIBLE   
LIKE REMOVING THIS COLONNADE ON 
THIS SIDE.                      

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:20.713
LIKE REMOVING THIS COLONNADE ON 
THIS SIDE.                      
UH, AND I SHOULD I SHOULD BACK  

00:24:20.715 --> 00:24:21.580
THIS SIDE.                      
UH, AND I SHOULD I SHOULD BACK  
UP TO SAY THAT I ALSO BELIEVE   

00:24:21.582 --> 00:24:27.519
UH, AND I SHOULD I SHOULD BACK  
UP TO SAY THAT I ALSO BELIEVE   
THAT                            

00:24:40.967 --> 00:24:43.435
     THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN 
DONE TO THE FORMER GARAGE LIKE  
ADDING THAT GABLE GETTING RID   

00:24:43.437 --> 00:24:44.169
DONE TO THE FORMER GARAGE LIKE  
ADDING THAT GABLE GETTING RID   
OF THE CAR DOORS, PUTTING IN    

00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:44.903
ADDING THAT GABLE GETTING RID   
OF THE CAR DOORS, PUTTING IN    
ANOTHER PERSON OR PUTTING IN A  

00:24:44.905 --> 00:24:45.637
OF THE CAR DOORS, PUTTING IN    
ANOTHER PERSON OR PUTTING IN A  
COUPLE OF WINDOWS, PUTTING IN   

00:24:45.639 --> 00:24:46.105
ANOTHER PERSON OR PUTTING IN A  
COUPLE OF WINDOWS, PUTTING IN   
DRYWALL, ELECTRICITY,           

00:24:46.107 --> 00:24:46.772
COUPLE OF WINDOWS, PUTTING IN   
DRYWALL, ELECTRICITY,           
EVERYTHING ELSE AND AND AND     

00:24:46.774 --> 00:24:47.506
DRYWALL, ELECTRICITY,           
EVERYTHING ELSE AND AND AND     
EVEN IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO      

00:24:47.508 --> 00:24:48.173
EVERYTHING ELSE AND AND AND     
EVEN IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO      
REVERSE ALL THAT WORK, YOU      

00:24:48.175 --> 00:24:48.907
EVEN IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO      
REVERSE ALL THAT WORK, YOU      
STILL COULDN'T USE IT AS A      

00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:49.508
REVERSE ALL THAT WORK, YOU      
STILL COULDN'T USE IT AS A      
GARAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN NO       

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.175
STILL COULDN'T USE IT AS A      
GARAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN NO       
LONGER PUT A DRIVEWAY AND I     

00:24:50.177 --> 00:24:50.909
GARAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN NO       
LONGER PUT A DRIVEWAY AND I     
THINK THE GARAGE IS A STRUCTURE 

00:24:50.911 --> 00:24:51.576
LONGER PUT A DRIVEWAY AND I     
THINK THE GARAGE IS A STRUCTURE 
HAS LOST ITS HISTORIC           

00:24:51.578 --> 00:24:51.910
THINK THE GARAGE IS A STRUCTURE 
HAS LOST ITS HISTORIC           
INTEGRITY.                      

00:24:51.912 --> 00:24:52.711
HAS LOST ITS HISTORIC           
INTEGRITY.                      
OK, I THINK THAT THAT IS IT FOR 

00:24:52.713 --> 00:24:53.378
INTEGRITY.                      
OK, I THINK THAT THAT IS IT FOR

IT MAKE SENSE TO DISCUSS ONE    
FOUR AND SIX ALL TOGETHER MAYBE 
LISTING THE DISTRICTS IN ORDER

01:59:36.624 --> 01:59:37.757
LISTING THE DISTRICTS IN ORDER  
OF ADOPTION?                    
WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST STARTED  

01:59:37.759 --> 01:59:38.525
OF ADOPTION?                    
WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST STARTED  
WAS LOOKING AT THIS AND THEN    

01:59:38.527 --> 01:59:40.927
WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST STARTED  
WAS LOOKING AT THIS AND THEN    
WENT TO THE NEXT PAGE AND READ  

01:59:40.929 --> 01:59:43.763
WAS LOOKING AT THIS AND THEN    
WENT TO THE NEXT PAGE AND READ  
AND ST- AND THEN IT JUST        

01:59:43.765 --> 01:59:47.867
WENT TO THE NEXT PAGE AND READ  
AND ST- AND THEN IT JUST        
THERE'S NOT LIKE A FLOW TO THIS 

01:59:47.869 --> 01:59:51.704
AND ST- AND THEN IT JUST        
THERE'S NOT LIKE A FLOW TO THIS 
NEXT SEVERAL PARTS BECAUSE      

01:59:51.706 --> 01:59:52.572
THERE'S NOT LIKE A FLOW TO THIS 
NEXT SEVERAL PARTS BECAUSE      
YOU'RE JUST KIND OF HOPPING     

01:59:52.574 --> 01:59:53.306
NEXT SEVERAL PARTS BECAUSE      
YOU'RE JUST KIND OF HOPPING     
AROUND AND THAT'S MAYBE FINE.   

01:59:53.308 --> 01:59:56.575
YOU'RE JUST KIND OF HOPPING     
AROUND AND THAT'S MAYBE FINE.   
BUT I ALSO THOUGHT MAYBE IF IF  

01:59:56.577 --> 01:59:59.912
AROUND AND THAT'S MAYBE FINE.   
BUT I ALSO THOUGHT MAYBE IF IF  
IT'S EASY TO SOMEHOW GROUP THEM 

01:59:59.914 --> 02:00:00.746
BUT I ALSO THOUGHT MAYBE IF IF  
IT'S EASY TO SOMEHOW GROUP THEM 
IN A DIFFERENT WAY THEN LIKE    

02:00:00.748 --> 02:00:02.449
IT'S EASY TO SOMEHOW GROUP THEM 
IN A DIFFERENT WAY THEN LIKE    
THE DOWNTOWN HISTORIC DISTRICTS 

02:00:02.451 --> 02:00:06.686
IN A DIFFERENT WAY THEN LIKE    
THE DOWNTOWN HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
ARE ALL TOGETHER.               

02:00:06.688 --> 02:00:10.390
THE DOWNTOWN HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
ARE ALL TOGETHER.               
>> THERE'S THE OLD FOURTH WARD  

02:00:10.392 --> 02:00:14.493
ARE ALL TOGETHER.               
>> THERE'S THE OLD FOURTH WARD  
AND STREET AND AND DIVISION     

02:00:14.495 --> 02:00:15.528
>> THERE'S THE OLD FOURTH WARD

STREET THAT ARE ALL KIND        
OF CONTIGUOUS.                  
SO THAT WAS ONE THOUGHT THAT    

02:00:21.502 --> 02:00:25.571
OF CONTIGUOUS.                  
SO THAT WAS ONE THOUGHT THAT    
MAYBE THAT WOULD READ BETTER IF 

02:00:25.573 --> 02:00:26.505
SO THAT WAS ONE THOUGHT THAT    
MAYBE THAT WOULD READ BETTER IF 
THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER AND THEN 

02:00:26.507 --> 02:00:27.207
MAYBE THAT WOULD READ BETTER IF 
THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER AND THEN 
A COMPLETELY SEPARATE THOUGHT I 

02:00:27.209 --> 02:00:29.843
THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER AND THEN 
A COMPLETELY SEPARATE THOUGHT I 
HAD WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH IT 

02:00:29.845 --> 02:00:30.576
A COMPLETELY SEPARATE THOUGHT I
