SO THE THING THAT THIS RAMP HAS 

01:09:14.336 --> 01:09:17.104
BUILDING INTACT.                
SO THE THING THAT THIS RAMP HAS 
GOING FOR IT IS THAT IT DOES    

01:09:17.106 --> 01:09:17.838
SO THE THING THAT THIS RAMP HAS 
GOING FOR IT IS THAT IT DOES    
KEEP EVERYTHING INTACT AND IT&apos;S 

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.374
GOING FOR IT IS THAT IT DOES    
KEEP EVERYTHING INTACT AND IT&apos;S 
SUPER EASY TO REMOVE.           

01:09:20.376 --> 01:09:24.478
KEEP EVERYTHING INTACT AND IT&apos;S 
SUPER EASY TO REMOVE.           
THERE WOULD BE A NEW DOORWAY.   

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.480
SUPER EASY TO REMOVE.           
THERE WOULD BE A NEW DOORWAY.   
BUT I DO THINK THAT EVEN IF     

01:09:25.482 --> 01:09:28.282
THERE WOULD BE A NEW DOORWAY.   
BUT I DO THINK THAT EVEN IF     
THAT DOORWAY WERE PROPOSED      

01:09:28.284 --> 01:09:29.217
BUT I DO THINK THAT EVEN IF     
THAT DOORWAY WERE PROPOSED      
WITHOUT A RAMP IT WOULD BE IN   

01:09:29.219 --> 01:09:29.950
THAT DOORWAY WERE PROPOSED      
WITHOUT A RAMP IT WOULD BE IN   
AN APPROPRIATE SPOT ON A NON    

01:09:29.952 --> 01:09:32.286
WITHOUT A RAMP IT WOULD BE IN   
AN APPROPRIATE SPOT ON A NON    
CHARACTER DEFINING ELEVATION.   

01:09:32.288 --> 01:09:34.488
AN APPROPRIATE SPOT ON A NON    
CHARACTER DEFINING ELEVATION.   
SO LET ME CHECK HERE AND SEE IF 

01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:40.828
CHARACTER DEFINING ELEVATION.   
SO LET ME CHECK HERE AND SEE IF 
I MISSED ANYTHING

01:10:06.056 --> 01:10:06.854
YOU WANTED TO SHARE YOUR        
THOUGHTS ON THAT WITH ME AND    
FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE IN      

01:10:06.856 --> 01:10:09.123
THOUGHTS ON THAT WITH ME AND    
FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE IN

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:16.463
FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE IN

FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPLY IT, I   

01:10:16.465 --> 01:10:17.397
CONCEPT AND I COULD HELP THEM   
FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPLY IT, I   
DO BELIEVE THAT THE WORK IS     

01:10:17.399 --> 01:10:18.165
FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPLY IT, I   
DO BELIEVE THAT THE WORK IS     
LACKING IN VISUAL INTEGRITY BUT 

01:10:18.167 --> 01:10:20.868
DO BELIEVE THAT THE WORK IS     
LACKING IN VISUAL INTEGRITY BUT 
IT KEEPS HISTORIC MATERIALS     

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:24.038
LACKING IN VISUAL INTEGRITY BUT 
IT KEEPS HISTORIC MATERIALS     
INTACT AND REALLY IT&apos;S THIS OR  

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:24.806
IT KEEPS HISTORIC MATERIALS     
INTACT AND REALLY IT&apos;S THIS OR  
LIFT THE LIFT WOULD ALSO HAVE   

01:10:24.808 --> 01:10:28.276
INTACT AND REALLY IT&apos;S THIS OR  
LIFT THE LIFT WOULD ALSO HAVE   
TO GO BACK HERE IN THE BACK.    

01:10:28.278 --> 01:10:29.209
LIFT THE LIFT WOULD ALSO HAVE   
TO GO BACK HERE IN THE BACK.    
IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A NEW     

01:10:29.211 --> 01:10:31.079
TO GO BACK HERE IN THE BACK.    
IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A NEW     
OPENING IF IT WERE TO BE PUT    

01:10:31.081 --> 01:10:35.315
IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A NEW     
OPENING IF IT WERE TO BE PUT    
BACK HERE AND IT WOULD JUST BE  

01:10:35.317 --> 01:10:38.452
OPENING IF IT WERE TO BE PUT    
BACK HERE AND IT WOULD JUST BE  
I DON&apos;T IT WOULD BE A NEW       

01:10:38.454 --> 01:10:39.086
BACK HERE AND IT WOULD JUST BE  
I DON&apos;T IT WOULD BE A NEW       
STRUCTURE BACK THERE            

01:10:39.088 --> 01:10:43.056
I DON&apos;T IT WOULD BE A NEW       
STRUCTURE BACK THERE            
ESSENTIALLY AND I REALLY THINK  

01:10:43.058 --> 01:10:45.560
STRUCTURE BACK THERE            
ESSENTIALLY AND I REALLY THINK  
THAT THIS IS ALMOST LESS        

01:10:45.562 --> 01:10:46.561
ESSENTIALLY AND I REALLY THINK  
THAT THIS IS ALMOST LESS        
INVASIVE BECAUSE IT&apos;S SO EASY   

01:10:46.563 --> 01:10:47.161
THAT THIS IS ALMOST LESS        
INVASIVE BECAUSE IT&apos;S SO EASY   
TO REMOVE I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT     

01:10:47.163 --> 01:10:49.830
INVASIVE BECAUSE IT&apos;S SO EASY   
TO REMOVE I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT     
THEY&apos;LL EVER BE ALLOWED TO      

01:10:49.832 --> 01:10:50.498
TO REMOVE I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT     
THEY&apos;LL EVER BE ALLOWED TO      
REMOVE IT SINCE IT&apos;S A

PRETTY SURE THAT THESE ARE      
BRICKS THAT YOU CAN SEE THROUGH 
HERE WHERE THIS CONCRETE IS     

01:36:14.388 --> 01:36:21.894
BRICKS THAT YOU CAN SEE THROUGH 
HERE WHERE THIS CONCRETE IS     
FLAKING OFF AND THIS CORNER I   

01:36:21.896 --> 01:36:22.695
HERE WHERE THIS CONCRETE IS     
FLAKING OFF AND THIS CORNER I   
WAS POINTING OUT THIS IS THIS   

01:36:22.697 --> 01:36:25.531
FLAKING OFF AND THIS CORNER I   
WAS POINTING OUT THIS IS THIS   
IS WHERE EVERYTHING IS SHIFTED  

01:36:25.533 --> 01:36:25.865
WAS POINTING OUT THIS IS THIS   
IS WHERE EVERYTHING IS SHIFTED  
.                               

01:36:25.867 --> 01:36:26.632
IS WHERE EVERYTHING IS SHIFTED  
.                               
I DON&apos;T KNOW IF THE BUILDING    

01:36:26.634 --> 01:36:27.500
.                               
I DON&apos;T KNOW IF THE BUILDING    
TALKED AND WENT TO THE RIGHT OR 

01:36:27.502 --> 01:36:30.069
I DON&apos;T KNOW IF THE BUILDING    
TALKED AND WENT TO THE RIGHT OR 
IF THE FOUNDATION IS LEANING TO 

01:36:30.071 --> 01:36:30.470
TALKED AND WENT TO THE RIGHT OR 
IF THE FOUNDATION IS LEANING TO 
THE LEFT.                       

01:36:30.472 --> 01:36:32.672
IF THE FOUNDATION IS LEANING TO 
THE LEFT.                       
BUT THERE&apos;S A PROBLEM THERE.    

01:36:32.674 --> 01:36:33.672
THE LEFT.                       
BUT THERE&apos;S A PROBLEM THERE.    
SO WALKING AROUND THE BACK THIS 

01:36:33.674 --> 01:36:36.742
BUT THERE&apos;S A PROBLEM THERE.    
SO WALKING AROUND THE BACK THIS 
IS THE OTHER REAR CORNER AND    

01:36:36.744 --> 01:36:37.543
SO WALKING AROUND THE BACK THIS 
IS THE OTHER REAR CORNER AND    
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE SIDING IS 

01:36:37.545 --> 01:36:40.879
IS THE OTHER REAR CORNER AND    
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE SIDING IS 
COMING OFF A LITTLE BIT HERE.   

01:36:40.881 --> 01:36:44.650
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE SIDING IS 
COMING OFF A LITTLE BIT HERE.   
IT&apos;S MORE SQUARE THOUGH IT      

01:36:44.652 --> 01:36:45.351
COMING OFF A LITTLE BIT HERE.   
IT&apos;S MORE SQUARE THOUGH IT      
APPEARS THAT IT MIGHT BE        

01:36:45.353 --> 01:36:46.085
IT&apos;S MORE SQUARE THOUGH IT      
APPEARS THAT IT MIGHT BE        
HANGING A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THE 

01:36:46.087 --> 01:36:46.619
APPEARS THAT IT MIGHT BE        
HANGING A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THE 
FOUNDATION.                     

01:36:46.621 --> 01:36:48.454
HANGING A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THE 
FOUNDATION.                     
YOU&apos;D HAVE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY 

01:36:48.456 --> 01:36:49.022
FOUNDATION.                     
YOU&apos;D HAVE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY 
FROM THE INTERIOR TO FIGURE     

01:36:49.024 --> 01:36:49.489
YOU&apos;D HAVE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY 
FROM THE INTERIOR TO FIGURE     
THAT OUT.                       

01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:51.623
FROM THE INTERIOR TO FIGURE     
THAT OUT.                       
I THINK YOU CAN SEE SOME BRICK  

01:36:51.625 --> 01:36:52.358
THAT OUT.                       
I THINK YOU CAN SEE SOME BRICK  
THROUGH HERE INSIDE OF THE      

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.861
I THINK YOU CAN SEE SOME BRICK  
THROUGH HERE INSIDE OF THE      
GARAGE.                         

01:36:55.863 --> 01:36:59.899
THROUGH HERE INSIDE OF THE      
GARAGE.                         
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE THE    

01:36:59.901 --> 01:37:00.767
GARAGE.                         
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE THE    
ROOF FRAMING IS OBVIOUSLY SHOT  

01:37:00.769 --> 01:37:01.434
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE THE    
ROOF FRAMING IS OBVIOUSLY SHOT  
BECAUSE THAT&apos;S COLLAPSED.       

01:37:01.436 --> 01:37:04.036
ROOF FRAMING IS OBVIOUSLY SHOT  
BECAUSE THAT&apos;S COLLAPSED.       
BUT THERE IS SOUND MATERIAL     

01:37:04.038 --> 01:37:04.437
BECAUSE THAT&apos;S COLLAPSED.       
BUT THERE IS SOUND MATERIAL     
INSIDE HERE.                    

01:37:04.439 --> 01:37:08.107
BUT THERE IS SOUND MATERIAL     
INSIDE HERE.                    
THE FRAMING IS PRETTY MUCH      

01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.508
INSIDE HERE.                    
THE FRAMING IS PRETTY MUCH      
INTACT.                         

01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:09.175
THE FRAMING IS PRETTY MUCH      
INTACT.                         
IT WOULD CERTAINLY PROBABLY     

01:37:09.177 --> 01:37:12.445
INTACT.                         
IT WOULD CERTAINLY PROBABLY     
NEED SOME TO TO TO BEEF IT UP   

01:37:12.447 --> 01:37:14.913
IT WOULD CERTAINLY PROBABLY     
NEED SOME TO TO TO BEEF IT UP   
A LITTLE BIT.                   

01:37:14.915 --> 01:37:19.018
NEED SOME TO TO TO BEEF IT UP   
A LITTLE BIT.                   
THE DOORS ON THE INSIDE GET TO  

01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:19.618
A LITTLE BIT.                   
THE DOORS ON THE INSIDE GET TO  
THEM IN A SECOND.               

01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:20.486
THE DOORS ON THE INSIDE GET TO  
THEM IN A SECOND.               
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE&apos;S THERE  

01:37:20.488 --> 01:37:22.588
THEM IN A SECOND.               
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE&apos;S THERE  
ARE A COUPLE OF WINDOWS HERE    

01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:26.058
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE&apos;S THERE  
ARE A COUPLE OF WINDOWS HERE    
SILLS IT SAYS IN THE IN THE     

01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:26.659
ARE A COUPLE OF WINDOWS HERE    
SILLS IT SAYS IN THE IN THE     
RIGHT UP OUR DETERIORATED.      

01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:33.232
SILLS IT SAYS IN THE IN THE     
RIGHT UP OUR DETERIORATED.      
I TOTALLY BELIEVE THAT          

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.580
                       THAT&apos;S   
PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD   
NEED TO BE REPLACED HERE.       

01:37:48.582 --> 01:37:49.315
PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD   
NEED TO BE REPLACED HERE.       
THE DOORS ON THE INTERIOR YOU   

01:37:49.317 --> 01:37:50.116
NEED TO BE REPLACED HERE.       
THE DOORS ON THE INTERIOR YOU   
CAN SEE THAT IT&apos;S JUST IT&apos;S     

01:37:50.118 --> 01:37:50.817
THE DOORS ON THE INTERIOR YOU   
CAN SEE THAT IT&apos;S JUST IT&apos;S     
JUST WOOD SLABS THAT THEY&apos;VE    

01:37:50.819 --> 01:37:51.484
CAN SEE THAT IT&apos;S JUST IT&apos;S     
JUST WOOD SLABS THAT THEY&apos;VE    
BUILT THE MORE DECORATIVE       

01:37:51.486 --> 01:37:52.151
JUST WOOD SLABS THAT THEY&apos;VE    
BUILT THE MORE DECORATIVE       
EXTERIOR ON TOP OF WHICH DOES   

01:37:52.153 --> 01:37:52.685
BUILT THE MORE DECORATIVE       
EXTERIOR ON TOP OF WHICH DOES   
HELP FOR DURABILITY.            

01:37:52.687 --> 01:37:53.553
EXTERIOR ON TOP OF WHICH DOES   
HELP FOR DURABILITY.            
AND HERE&apos;S OUR UNFORTUNATE HOLE 

01:37:53.555 --> 01:37:54.253
HELP FOR DURABILITY.            
AND HERE&apos;S OUR UNFORTUNATE HOLE 
IN THE ROOF OR IT&apos;S CAVED IN.

STRUCTURE, PAIGE PAGE 107 ONE   

02:03:00.494 --> 02:03:01.158
BY THAT YOU&apos;RE IN THIS REBUILD  
STRUCTURE, PAIGE PAGE 107 ONE   
OF THE SENSES IS THE            

02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:03.594

UNDERTAKING INVOLVES NOT ONLY   

02:03:03.596 --> 02:03:04.195

UNDERTAKING INVOLVES NOT ONLY   
DEMOLISHING THE EXISTING        

02:03:04.197 --> 02:03:04.929
UNDERTAKING INVOLVES NOT ONLY   
DEMOLISHING THE EXISTING        
STRUCTURE AND ITS FOUNDATION    

02:03:04.931 --> 02:03:08.466
DEMOLISHING THE EXISTING        
STRUCTURE AND ITS FOUNDATION    
BUT ALSO RELOCATING A TASK THAT 

02:03:08.468 --> 02:03:09.266
STRUCTURE AND ITS FOUNDATION    
BUT ALSO RELOCATING A TASK THAT 
COMES AT A SIGNIFICANT COST.    

02:03:09.268 --> 02:03:12.470
BUT ALSO RELOCATING A TASK THAT 
COMES AT A SIGNIFICANT COST.    
I THINK THE TYPICAL WAY TO DO   

02:03:12.472 --> 02:03:13.571
COMES AT A SIGNIFICANT COST.    
I THINK THE TYPICAL WAY TO DO   
IT IS YOU YOU SHORE IT UP IN

02:03:19.512 --> 02:03:20.178
PLACE AND YOU KIND OF LIKE JUST 
KEEP IT THERE AND THEN YOU      
REMOVE THE FOUNDATIONS AND THEN 

02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:23.280
KEEP IT THERE AND THEN YOU      
REMOVE THE FOUNDATIONS AND THEN 
YOU JUST REBUILD THE FOUNDATION 

02:03:23.282 --> 02:03:23.748
REMOVE THE FOUNDATIONS AND THEN 
YOU JUST REBUILD THE FOUNDATION 
UP TO IT.                       

02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:27.384
YOU JUST REBUILD THE FOUNDATION 
UP TO IT.                       
ISN&apos;T THAT WHAT TYPICALLY IS    

02:03:27.386 --> 02:03:28.018
UP TO IT.                       
ISN&apos;T THAT WHAT TYPICALLY IS    
DONE IN HASTE STORE?            

02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:30.288

02:03:31.891 --> 02:03:34.558
I DON&apos;T KNOW.                   
MAYBE THAT WAS A CREATIVE IDEA  
BUT THAT&apos;S CERTAINLY NOT THE    

02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.359
MAYBE THAT WAS A CREATIVE IDEA  
BUT THAT&apos;S CERTAINLY NOT THE    
TYPICAL WAY OF REBUILDING A     

02:03:35.361 --> 02:03:38.829
BUT THAT&apos;S CERTAINLY NOT THE    
TYPICAL WAY OF REBUILDING A     
FOUNDATION FOR ONE OF THESE.    

02:03:38.831 --> 02:03:42.967
TYPICAL WAY OF REBUILDING A
