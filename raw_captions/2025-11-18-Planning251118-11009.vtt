I THINK THE THE LARGEST THING   
THAT WAS ALLUDED TO JUST A FEW

THERE'S AN IMPLICATION THAT     
THERE CAN ONLY BE HIGH RISES IN

00:26:27.803 --> 00:26:30.203
THERE CAN ONLY BE HIGH RISES IN

WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO           
EVENTUALLY.                     
BUT I THINK IF SOMETHING IS FAR 

00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:35.241
EVENTUALLY.                     
BUT I THINK IF SOMETHING IS FAR 
ENOUGH AWAY FROM RESIDENTIAL IN 

00:26:35.243 --> 00:26:38.244
BUT I THINK IF SOMETHING IS FAR 
ENOUGH AWAY FROM RESIDENTIAL IN 
A TRANSITION ZONE OR NEXT TO

ENOUGH AWAY FROM RESIDENTIAL IN

WAY YOU DEEM APPROPRIATE TO     
TAPER THAT HIGH RISES COULD BE  

00:26:43.117 --> 00:26:46.152
WAY YOU DEEM APPROPRIATE TO     
TAPER THAT HIGH RISES COULD BE  
AN TRANSITION EVEN IF THEY      

00:26:46.154 --> 00:26:48.721
TAPER THAT HIGH RISES COULD BE  
AN TRANSITION EVEN IF THEY      
AREN'T NEXT TO HUB.             

00:26:48.723 --> 00:26:49.755
AN TRANSITION EVEN IF THEY      
AREN'T NEXT TO HUB.             
SO I WOULD RECOMMEND STRIKING

AREN'T NEXT TO HUB.             
SO I WOULD RECOMMEND STRIKING   
IF ADJACENT TO HUB AND OF SOME

IF ADJACENT TO HUB AND OF SOME  
OTHER NITPICKY THINGS THAT I

WOULD BE GOOD JUST BECAUSE      

00:27:01.837 --> 00:27:05.238
SEARCH TO REPLACE ON CONTEXT    
WOULD BE GOOD JUST BECAUSE      
PEOPLE TEND TO READ WHAT THEY

REMOVED THE REQUIREMENT TO      
PROVIDE THEM.                   

00:53:13.306 --> 00:53:13.972

THAT I CAN SEE IN THE PLAN      
EARLIER WHERE IT WOULD GO IT    

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:30.967
THAT I CAN SEE IN THE PLAN      
EARLIER WHERE IT WOULD GO IT    
WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE SOMETHING 

01:26:30.969 --> 01:26:31.700
EARLIER WHERE IT WOULD GO IT    
WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE SOMETHING 
OR WE'D HAVE TO ADD A NEW PAGE  

01:26:31.702 --> 01:26:37.340
WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE SOMETHING 
OR WE'D HAVE TO ADD A NEW PAGE  
TO GET THAT MUCH TEXT INTO THE  

01:26:37.342 --> 01:26:38.141
OR WE'D HAVE TO ADD A NEW PAGE  
TO GET THAT MUCH TEXT INTO THE  
PLAN AS IT'S PRESENTED.

THAT BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH IT A  
CERTAIN WAY NOW WE HAVE TO      
CONTINUE DEALING WITH THAT WAY. 

02:10:45.787 --> 02:10:46.553
CERTAIN WAY NOW WE HAVE TO      
CONTINUE DEALING WITH THAT WAY. 
I MEAN HERE'S THEIR OPPORTUNITY 

02:10:46.555 --> 02:10:49.323
CONTINUE DEALING WITH THAT WAY. 
I MEAN HERE'S THEIR OPPORTUNITY 
TO REVISIT THIS TOPIC AND THINK 

02:10:49.325 --> 02:10:50.190
I MEAN HERE'S THEIR OPPORTUNITY 
TO REVISIT THIS TOPIC AND THINK 
ABOUT IT IN THE PLAN AND MAYBE  

02:10:50.192 --> 02:10:53.493
TO REVISIT THIS TOPIC AND THINK 
ABOUT IT IN THE PLAN AND MAYBE  
REVISIT THE ZONING CODE AND IF  

02:10:53.495 --> 02:10:54.194
ABOUT IT IN THE PLAN AND MAYBE  
REVISIT THE ZONING CODE AND IF  
THERE ARE PLACES THAT ARE       

02:10:54.196 --> 02:10:54.862
REVISIT THE ZONING CODE AND IF  
THERE ARE PLACES THAT ARE       
CURRENTLY DOING SHORT TERM

THERE ARE PLACES THAT ARE       
CURRENTLY DOING SHORT TERM

NONCONFORMING USES THAT WOULD   

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.301

NONCONFORMING USES THAT WOULD   
BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.         

02:11:01.303 --> 02:11:02.102
NONCONFORMING USES THAT WOULD   
BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.         
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD 

02:11:02.104 --> 02:11:02.902
BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.         
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD 
BE PRECLUDED FROM SAYING WE'RE

THE MARKET.                     
THAT'S TRUE.                    
BUT IT'S NOT RELATIVE TO THE    

02:24:02.350 --> 02:24:03.282
THAT'S TRUE.                    
BUT IT'S NOT RELATIVE TO THE    
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WERE   

02:24:03.284 --> 02:24:03.616
BUT IT'S NOT RELATIVE TO THE    
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WERE   
SHORT.                          

02:24:03.618 --> 02:24:06.452
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WERE   
SHORT.                          
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE IT'S THE

SHORT.                          
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE IT'S THE 
STRAW THAT STIRS THE DRINK.     

02:24:07.088 --> 02:24:10.223
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE IT'S THE 
STRAW THAT STIRS THE DRINK.     
>> I THINK THOUGH IT IS         

02:24:10.225 --> 02:24:11.024
STRAW THAT STIRS THE DRINK.     
>> I THINK THOUGH IT IS         
DEPENDING ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  

02:24:11.026 --> 02:24:13.759
>> I THINK THOUGH IT IS         
DEPENDING ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  
>> SURE.                        

02:24:13.761 --> 02:24:14.460
DEPENDING ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  
>> SURE.                        
I TOTALLY GET IT.               

02:24:14.462 --> 02:24:15.461
>> SURE.                        
I TOTALLY GET IT.               
IT CAN AND CERTAINLY IN MY      

02:24:15.463 --> 02:24:16.962
I TOTALLY GET IT.               
IT CAN AND CERTAINLY IN MY      
NEIGHBORHOOD THERE'S ALREADY    

02:24:16.964 --> 02:24:17.730
IT CAN AND CERTAINLY IN MY      
NEIGHBORHOOD THERE'S ALREADY    
HOUSES IN A VERY WALKABLE, VERY 

02:24:17.732 --> 02:24:21.867
NEIGHBORHOOD THERE'S ALREADY    
HOUSES IN A VERY WALKABLE, VERY 
CLOSE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT ARE     

02:24:21.869 --> 02:24:22.635
HOUSES IN A VERY WALKABLE, VERY 
CLOSE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT ARE     
EMPTY TOTALLY GET IT OTHER THAN 

02:24:22.637 --> 02:24:26.038
CLOSE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT ARE     
EMPTY TOTALLY GET IT OTHER THAN 
EIGHT DAYS A YEAR BECAUSE YOU   

02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:26.905
EMPTY TOTALLY GET IT OTHER THAN 
EIGHT DAYS A YEAR BECAUSE YOU   
CAN GET FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A 

02:24:26.907 --> 02:24:29.341
EIGHT DAYS A YEAR BECAUSE YOU   
CAN GET FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A 
NIGHT FOR A BEGINNING OF THE    

02:24:29.343 --> 02:24:33.279
CAN GET FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A 
NIGHT FOR A BEGINNING OF THE    
YEAR AND SO I DO I THINK ADDING 

02:24:33.281 --> 02:24:34.080
NIGHT FOR A BEGINNING OF THE    
YEAR AND SO I DO I THINK ADDING 
SOMETHING IN I THINK SHORT TERM 

02:24:34.082 --> 02:24:37.283
YEAR AND SO I DO I THINK ADDING 
SOMETHING IN I THINK SHORT TERM 
RENTAL IS HAS AN EFFECT WHETHER 

02:24:37.285 --> 02:24:38.218
SOMETHING IN I THINK SHORT TERM 
RENTAL IS HAS AN EFFECT WHETHER 
IT'S A BIG EFFECT OR A SMALL    

02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:41.553
RENTAL IS HAS AN EFFECT WHETHER 
IT'S A BIG EFFECT OR A SMALL    
EFFECT, I THINK IT IS PART      

02:24:41.555 --> 02:24:42.322
IT'S A BIG EFFECT OR A SMALL    
EFFECT, I THINK IT IS PART      
OF THE LAND USE THAT IN TWO     

02:24:42.324 --> 02:24:45.191
EFFECT, I THINK IT IS PART      
OF THE LAND USE THAT IN TWO     
THOUSAND NINE DIDN'T EXIST.     

02:24:45.193 --> 02:24:46.191
OF THE LAND USE THAT IN TWO     
THOUSAND NINE DIDN'T EXIST.     
AND SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE   

02:24:46.193 --> 02:24:48.928
THOUSAND NINE DIDN'T EXIST.     
AND SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE   
TO HAVE A PARAGRAPH THAT THIS   

02:24:48.930 --> 02:24:49.795
AND SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE   
TO HAVE A PARAGRAPH THAT THIS   
IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS FOR US 

02:24:49.797 --> 02:24:52.731
TO HAVE A PARAGRAPH THAT THIS   
IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS FOR US 
NOW AND THAT WE SHOULD DO WE    

02:24:52.733 --> 02:24:56.201
IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS FOR US 
NOW AND THAT WE SHOULD DO WE    
SHOULD DRIVE RATHER THAN IT     

02:24:56.203 --> 02:24:57.036
NOW AND THAT WE SHOULD DO WE    
SHOULD DRIVE RATHER THAN IT     
DRIVING US AND JUST THAT WE ARE 

02:24:57.038 --> 02:25:00.105
SHOULD DRIVE RATHER THAN IT     
DRIVING US AND JUST THAT WE ARE 
AWARE OF IT AS MUCH AS

DRIVING US AND JUST THAT WE ARE 
AWARE OF IT AS MUCH AS          
POSSIBLE.                       

02:25:00.508 --> 02:25:01.407
AWARE OF IT AS MUCH AS          
POSSIBLE.                       
>> I THINK ADDING A PARAGRAPH   

02:25:01.409 --> 02:25:04.644

HERE AND KEEPING IT WHERE IT IS 

02:25:04.646 --> 02:25:05.477

SOMEONE MIGHT NOTES YES.        

02:25:08.249 --> 02:25:09.248
TO TALK ABOUT TRANSITION THAT

I THINK THEIR SUPPORT SO NOT SO 

02:25:09.250 --> 02:25:11.517
SOMEONE MIGHT NOTES YES.        
I THINK THEIR SUPPORT SO NOT SO 
WHAT IS NOT SUPPORTED IS ADDING 

02:25:11.519 --> 02:25:15.154
I THINK THEIR SUPPORT SO NOT SO 
WHAT IS NOT SUPPORTED IS ADDING 
LOCAL OR HUB.                   

02:25:15.156 --> 02:25:15.454
WHAT IS NOT SUPPORTED IS ADDING 
LOCAL OR HUB.                   
YEAH.                           

02:25:15.456 --> 02:25:16.189
LOCAL OR HUB.                   
YEAH.                           
SO BASICALLY JUST KEEPING IT    

02:25:16.191 --> 02:25:16.990
YEAH.                           
SO BASICALLY JUST KEEPING IT    
WHERE IT IS AND THEN ADDING AND 

02:25:16.992 --> 02:25:19.525
SO BASICALLY JUST KEEPING IT    
WHERE IT IS AND THEN ADDING AND 
I WOULD EVEN THINK IT COULD GO  

02:25:19.527 --> 02:25:20.226
WHERE IT IS AND THEN ADDING AND 
I WOULD EVEN THINK IT COULD GO  
UNDER THAT NEW AND DIVERSE      

02:25:20.228 --> 02:25:20.826
I WOULD EVEN THINK IT COULD GO  
UNDER THAT NEW AND DIVERSE      
HOUSING OPTIONS PARAGRAPH       

02:25:20.828 --> 02:25:23.562
UNDER THAT NEW AND DIVERSE      
HOUSING OPTIONS PARAGRAPH       
BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW WE   

02:25:23.564 --> 02:25:27.132
HOUSING OPTIONS PARAGRAPH       
BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW WE   
NEED MORE OPTIONS SO I COULD    

02:25:27.134 --> 02:25:27.900
BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW WE   
NEED MORE OPTIONS SO I COULD    
ADD A PARAGRAPH UNDER THERE     

02:25:27.902 --> 02:25:28.301
NEED MORE OPTIONS SO I COULD    
ADD A PARAGRAPH UNDER THERE     
ABOUT IT.                       

02:25:28.303 --> 02:25:30.703
ADD A PARAGRAPH UNDER THERE     
ABOUT IT.                       
RIGHT I JUST IT SOUNDS LIKE A   

02:25:30.705 --> 02:25:31.504
ABOUT IT.                       
RIGHT I JUST IT SOUNDS LIKE A

THERE WAS NO SUPPORT FOR THAT   
SO YEAH ADDING THE OTHER I

THE TIME WHERE YOU WANT TO      
PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE LAND USE

THE TIME WHERE YOU WANT TO      
PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE LAND USE 
FOR THOSE THINGS.

WOULD BE LIKE KIND OF MAKING A  
ZONING MAP RIGHT.               
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO
