IN ORDER WHAT IT SAYS NOW IS    
THE PORTION OF A PARCEL IS      

00:46:32.044 --> 00:46:32.643
IN ORDER WHAT IT SAYS NOW IS    
THE PORTION OF A PARCEL IS      
OWNED ARE THREE OR FOUR         

00:46:32.645 --> 00:46:33.243
THE PORTION OF A PARCEL IS      
OWNED ARE THREE OR FOUR

RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES ALL        
ENCOMPASSING.                   
SO THAT MEANS THAT YES, A       

00:46:39.351 --> 00:46:42.553
ENCOMPASSING.

MULTIFAMILY WOULD NEED TO       

00:46:42.555 --> 00:46:43.353
SO THAT MEANS THAT YES, A       
MULTIFAMILY WOULD NEED TO       
PROVIDE A CONFLICTING LAND USE  

00:46:43.355 --> 00:46:44.088
MULTIFAMILY WOULD NEED TO       
PROVIDE A CONFLICTING LAND USE  
BUFFER FROM A SINGLE FAMILY BUT 

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.024
PROVIDE A CONFLICTING LAND USE  
BUFFER FROM A SINGLE FAMILY BUT

BUFFER ADJACENT TO MULTIFAMILY. 
SO WE HAVE PROPOSED TO          

00:46:54.266 --> 00:46:54.932
BUFFER ADJACENT TO MULTIFAMILY. 
SO WE HAVE PROPOSED TO          
ELIMINATE THAT REQUIREMENT      

00:46:54.934 --> 00:46:55.466
SO WE HAVE PROPOSED TO

THERE COULD BE CHANGED SO THAT  

00:47:03.175 --> 00:47:06.143
IT COULD BE DISCUSSED THAT      
THERE COULD BE CHANGED SO THAT  
IT&apos;D BE MORE CLEAR THAT MULTI   

00:47:06.145 --> 00:47:07.045
THERE COULD BE CHANGED SO THAT  
IT&apos;D BE MORE CLEAR THAT MULTI   
FAMILY MUST BUFFER FROM SINGLE  

00:47:07.047 --> 00:47:07.544
IT&apos;D BE MORE CLEAR THAT MULTI   
FAMILY MUST BUFFER FROM SINGLE  
FAMILY ZONING.                  

00:47:07.546 --> 00:47:10.815
FAMILY MUST BUFFER FROM SINGLE  
FAMILY ZONING.

00:47:10.817 --> 00:47:11.215
FAMILY ZONING.                  
BUT THAT&apos;S NOT WHAT IT SAYS     
RIGHT NOW.

01:06:57.001 --> 01:06:59.635
IF I MEAN LIKE I SAID, THE      
SETBACKS THAT ARE IN THE PBT    
REGULATIONS ARE NOT EXACTLY     

01:06:59.637 --> 01:07:00.636
SETBACKS THAT ARE IN THE PBT    
REGULATIONS ARE NOT EXACTLY     
BASED ON A NUMBER WE GAVE A     

01:07:00.638 --> 01:07:04.039
REGULATIONS ARE NOT EXACTLY     
BASED ON A NUMBER WE GAVE A     
RANGE AND IT JUST HAPPENED TO   

01:07:04.041 --> 01:07:04.807
BASED ON A NUMBER WE GAVE A     
RANGE AND IT JUST HAPPENED TO   
FALL JUST BUT NOT ENOUGH OF A   

01:07:04.809 --> 01:07:05.541
RANGE AND IT JUST HAPPENED TO   
FALL JUST BUT NOT ENOUGH OF A   
RANGE LIKE ONLY A FOOT AND IT   

01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:07.376
FALL JUST BUT NOT ENOUGH OF A   
RANGE LIKE ONLY A FOOT AND IT   
JUST FELL OUTSIDE OF THAT       

01:07:07.378 --> 01:07:07.610
RANGE LIKE ONLY A FOOT AND IT   
JUST FELL OUTSIDE OF THAT       
RANGE.                          

01:07:07.612 --> 01:07:08.711
JUST FELL OUTSIDE OF THAT       
RANGE.                          
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW WHETHER THE     

01:07:08.713 --> 01:07:11.781
RANGE.                          
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW WHETHER THE     
INITIAL SURVEY WAS OFF THE SET  

01:07:11.783 --> 01:07:12.548
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW WHETHER THE     
INITIAL SURVEY WAS OFF THE SET  
BACKS AGAIN, IT&apos;S NOT LIKE WE   

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:15.584
INITIAL SURVEY WAS OFF THE SET  
BACKS AGAIN, IT&apos;S NOT LIKE WE   
SAID AN EXACT NUMBER IN THERE.  

01:07:15.586 --> 01:07:18.254
BACKS AGAIN, IT&apos;S NOT LIKE WE   
SAID AN EXACT NUMBER IN THERE.  
SO TRANSLATING THE SURVEY TO    

01:07:18.256 --> 01:07:19.054
SAID AN EXACT NUMBER IN THERE.  
SO TRANSLATING THE SURVEY TO    
THE SETBACKS DOESN&apos;T IT&apos;S NOT   

01:07:19.056 --> 01:07:20.857
SO TRANSLATING THE SURVEY TO    
THE SETBACKS DOESN&apos;T IT&apos;S NOT   
REALLY A DIRECT CORRELATION     

01:07:20.859 --> 01:07:25.161
THE SETBACKS DOESN&apos;T IT&apos;S NOT   
REALLY A DIRECT CORRELATION     
INITIALLY.                      

01:07:25.163 --> 01:07:26.395
REALLY A DIRECT CORRELATION     
INITIALLY.                      
OK, SO YOU&apos;RE SAYING THAT THE   

01:07:26.397 --> 01:07:29.065
INITIALLY.                      
OK, SO YOU&apos;RE SAYING THAT THE   
STATEMENT THAT I THINK I HEARD  

01:07:29.067 --> 01:07:32.101
OK, SO YOU&apos;RE SAYING THAT THE   
STATEMENT THAT I THINK I HEARD  
WHICH WAS THAT THE APPROVED     

01:07:32.103 --> 01:07:33.035
STATEMENT THAT I THINK I HEARD  
WHICH WAS THAT THE APPROVED     
SITE PLAN WAS TRANSLATED INTO   

01:07:33.037 --> 01:07:36.373
WHICH WAS THAT THE APPROVED     
SITE PLAN WAS TRANSLATED INTO   
THE TEXT OF THE PD INCORRECTLY  

01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:37.406
SITE PLAN WAS TRANSLATED INTO   
THE TEXT OF THE PD INCORRECTLY  
IS NOT A CORRECT DESCRIPTION    

01:07:37.408 --> 01:07:38.007
THE TEXT OF THE PD INCORRECTLY  
IS NOT A CORRECT DESCRIPTION    
OF WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE        

01:07:38.009 --> 01:07:40.109
IS NOT A CORRECT DESCRIPTION    
OF WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE        
THERE&apos;S A THE APPROVED SITE     

01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:41.010
OF WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE        
THERE&apos;S A THE APPROVED SITE     
PLAN FITS WITHIN THE APPROVED

01:07:41.446 --> 01:07:44.547
PLAN FITS WITHIN THE APPROVED   
PUDI REGULATIONS.               
SO YES, THAT SO RIGHT.          

01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:45.515
PUDI REGULATIONS.               
SO YES, THAT SO RIGHT.          
I DON&apos;T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS   

01:07:45.517 --> 01:07:48.384
SO YES, THAT SO RIGHT.          
I DON&apos;T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS   
MEANT BY THAT.                  

01:07:48.386 --> 01:07:49.385
I DON&apos;T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS   
MEANT BY THAT.                  
I MEAN I THINK THAT WAS YEAH.   

01:07:49.387 --> 01:07:50.219
MEANT BY THAT.                  
I MEAN I THINK THAT WAS YEAH.   
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TOO    

01:07:50.221 --> 01:07:52.155
I MEAN I THINK THAT WAS YEAH.   
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TOO    
DID I MISS HERE OR DID YOU ASK  

01:07:52.157 --> 01:07:55.425

DID I MISS HERE OR DID YOU ASK  
THEM.

SO WE DO STILL HAVE MR.         
LOCKWOOD ON THE LINE AND I      

01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:00.196
SO WE DO STILL HAVE MR.         
LOCKWOOD ON THE LINE AND I      
THINK WHAT PLANNER KOWALSKI WAS 

01:08:00.198 --> 01:08:03.466
LOCKWOOD ON THE LINE AND I      
THINK WHAT PLANNER KOWALSKI WAS

DISCREPANCY CAME IN INTO PLAY.  
AND THEN WE WENT THROUGH THE    

01:09:20.745 --> 01:09:23.446
DISCREPANCY CAME IN INTO PLAY.  
AND THEN WE WENT THROUGH THE    
PROCESS OF HAVING AN INTERIM    

01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:27.484
AND THEN WE WENT THROUGH THE    
PROCESS OF HAVING AN INTERIM    
SURVEY DONE BY OUR AS IN

WHICH IS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN  
.                               
WE DISCOVERED THAT THAT ISSUE   

01:09:32.557 --> 01:09:35.291
.                               
WE DISCOVERED THAT THAT ISSUE   
THAT WE WERE THAT THE THE THE   

01:09:35.293 --> 01:09:38.794
WE DISCOVERED THAT THAT ISSUE   
THAT WE WERE THAT THE THE THE   
BUILDING AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND 

01:09:38.796 --> 01:09:39.462
THAT WE WERE THAT THE THE THE   
BUILDING AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND 
THEY APPROVED THAT PLAN WAS     

01:09:39.464 --> 01:09:42.564
BUILDING AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND 
THEY APPROVED THAT PLAN WAS     
SLIGHTLY OUTSIDE OF THE         

01:09:42.566 --> 01:09:43.533
THEY APPROVED THAT PLAN WAS     
SLIGHTLY OUTSIDE OF THE         
PRESCRIBED IN THE PUDI AT THAT  

01:09:43.535 --> 01:09:46.502
SLIGHTLY OUTSIDE OF THE         
PRESCRIBED IN THE PUDI AT THAT  
POINT WE INITIATED THE PROCESS  

01:09:46.504 --> 01:09:47.303
PRESCRIBED IN THE PUDI AT THAT  
POINT WE INITIATED THE PROCESS  
OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING  

01:09:47.305 --> 01:09:50.773
POINT WE INITIATED THE PROCESS  
OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING  
MATCH UP OK.                    

01:09:50.775 --> 01:09:51.840
OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING  
MATCH UP OK.                    
SO I THINK THE QUESTION THAT    

01:09:51.842 --> 01:09:56.512
MATCH UP OK.                    
SO I THINK THE QUESTION THAT    
THE THAT CONCERNED THE RESIDENT 

01:09:56.514 --> 01:09:57.246
SO I THINK THE QUESTION THAT    
THE THAT CONCERNED THE RESIDENT 
IS CONCERNS THEN THE            

01:09:57.248 --> 01:09:57.847
THE THAT CONCERNED THE RESIDENT 
IS CONCERNS THEN THE            
MEASUREMENTS WHO DID THE        

01:09:57.849 --> 01:10:05.455
IS CONCERNS THEN THE            
MEASUREMENTS WHO DID THE        
MEASUREMENTS THAT WERE          

01:10:07.324 --> 01:10:14.764

01:10:14.766 --> 01:10:15.698
ANOTHER MR. LOCKWOOD I&apos;M SORRY  
I SHOULD BE MORE CLEAR YOU&apos;RE   
SAYING THAT THE MEASUREMENTS    

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:22.938
I SHOULD BE MORE CLEAR YOU&apos;RE   
SAYING THAT THE MEASUREMENTS    
WERE DONE INCORRECTLY, THAT     

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:23.539
SAYING THAT THE MEASUREMENTS    
WERE DONE INCORRECTLY, THAT     
THEY WERE WHATEVER YOUR         

01:10:23.541 --> 01:10:26.943
WERE DONE INCORRECTLY, THAT     
THEY WERE WHATEVER YOUR         
REFERENCE POINT WAS, IT         

01:10:26.945 --> 01:10:27.677
THEY WERE WHATEVER YOUR         
REFERENCE POINT WAS, IT         
ACTUALLY SET THE BUILDING       

01:10:27.679 --> 01:10:30.346
REFERENCE POINT WAS, IT         
ACTUALLY SET THE BUILDING       
SLIGHTLY OFF FROM WHERE IT WAS  

01:10:30.348 --> 01:10:30.813
ACTUALLY SET THE BUILDING       
SLIGHTLY OFF FROM WHERE IT WAS  
MEANT TO BE.                    

01:10:30.815 --> 01:10:33.583
SLIGHTLY OFF FROM WHERE IT WAS  
MEANT TO BE.                    
WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE 

01:10:33.585 --> 01:10:34.450
MEANT TO BE.                    
WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THOSE MEASUREMENTS I THINK  

01:10:34.452 --> 01:10:35.051
WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THOSE MEASUREMENTS I THINK  
IS THE QUESTION THAT THE        

01:10:35.053 --> 01:10:38.921
FOR THOSE MEASUREMENTS I THINK  
IS THE QUESTION THAT THE        
RESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.    

01:10:38.923 --> 01:10:42.024
IS THE QUESTION THAT THE        
RESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.    
SURE WOULD BE THE SURVEYOR AND  

01:10:42.026 --> 01:10:43.192
RESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.    
SURE WOULD BE THE SURVEYOR AND  
CIVIL ENGINEER WHO LAID OUT THE 

01:10:43.194 --> 01:10:46.028
SURE WOULD BE THE SURVEYOR AND  
CIVIL ENGINEER WHO LAID OUT THE 
SEQUENCE.                       

01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.895
CIVIL ENGINEER WHO LAID OUT THE 
SEQUENCE.                       
I THINK THE MEASUREMENTS FROM   

01:10:46.897 --> 01:10:47.630
SEQUENCE.                       
I THINK THE MEASUREMENTS FROM   
THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING AND  

01:10:47.632 --> 01:10:50.466
I THINK THE MEASUREMENTS FROM   
THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING AND  
NOT THE THE NEAREST CORNER IS   

01:10:50.468 --> 01:10:53.102
THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING AND  
NOT THE THE NEAREST CORNER IS   
MY UNDERSTANDING.               

01:10:53.104 --> 01:10:53.502
NOT THE THE NEAREST CORNER IS   
MY UNDERSTANDING.               
YES.                            

01:10:53.504 --> 01:10:57.372
MY UNDERSTANDING.               
YES.                            
IN THE PLAN LIKE I MEAN I CAN   

01:10:57.374 --> 01:10:58.107
YES.                            
IN THE PLAN LIKE I MEAN I CAN   
VERIFY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE     

01:10:58.109 --> 01:10:58.807
IN THE PLAN LIKE I MEAN I CAN   
VERIFY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE     
ORIGINAL APPROVED PLAN IT       

01:10:58.809 --> 01:11:01.210
VERIFY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE     
ORIGINAL APPROVED PLAN IT       
SCALES CORRECTLY TO THAT THOSE  

01:11:01.212 --> 01:11:01.944
ORIGINAL APPROVED PLAN IT       
SCALES CORRECTLY TO THAT THOSE  
DIMENSIONS BASED ON THAT SURVEY 

01:11:01.946 --> 01:11:05.348
SCALES CORRECTLY TO THAT THOSE  
DIMENSIONS BASED ON THAT SURVEY 
THAT WAS PROVIDED AT THAT TIME. 

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:06.582
DIMENSIONS BASED ON THAT SURVEY 
THAT WAS PROVIDED AT THAT TIME. 
SO AGAIN, I THINK THERE IS IT   

01:11:06.584 --> 01:11:09.318
THAT WAS PROVIDED AT THAT TIME. 
SO AGAIN, I THINK THERE IS IT   
WAS POSSIBLY A AN AREA WHERE    

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.152
SO AGAIN, I THINK THERE IS IT   
WAS POSSIBLY A AN AREA WHERE    
THEY CENTER THAT IS WHERE KIND  

01:11:10.154 --> 01:11:13.389
WAS POSSIBLY A AN AREA WHERE    
THEY CENTER THAT IS WHERE KIND  
OF AND I KNOW MR. LOCKE WHEN I  

01:11:13.391 --> 01:11:14.123
THEY CENTER THAT IS WHERE KIND  
OF AND I KNOW MR. LOCKE WHEN I  
WERE TRYING TO TALK TO SURVEY   

01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:16.992
OF AND I KNOW MR. LOCKE WHEN I  
WERE TRYING TO TALK TO SURVEY   
SURVEY TALK BUT AGAIN THAT&apos;S    

01:11:16.994 --> 01:11:17.794
WERE TRYING TO TALK TO SURVEY   
SURVEY TALK BUT AGAIN THAT&apos;S    
WHERE THAT THAT&apos;S WHERE THAT    

01:11:17.796 --> 01:11:19.828
SURVEY TALK BUT AGAIN THAT&apos;S    
WHERE THAT THAT&apos;S WHERE THAT    
ERROR CAME IN AND THEN WHEN     

01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:20.763
WHERE THAT THAT&apos;S WHERE THAT    
ERROR CAME IN AND THEN WHEN     
THEY RESURVEYED IT, I BELIEVE   

01:11:20.765 --> 01:11:21.597
ERROR CAME IN AND THEN WHEN     
THEY RESURVEYED IT, I BELIEVE   
THEY PROBABLY USE A SLIGHTLY    

01:11:21.599 --> 01:11:24.166
THEY RESURVEYED IT, I BELIEVE   
THEY PROBABLY USE A SLIGHTLY    
DIFFERENT CENTERING POINT.      

01:11:24.168 --> 01:11:25.234
THEY PROBABLY USE A SLIGHTLY    
DIFFERENT CENTERING POINT.      
I MEAN WE&apos;RE NOT TALKING ABOUT  

01:11:25.236 --> 01:11:27.970
DIFFERENT CENTERING POINT.      
I MEAN WE&apos;RE NOT TALKING ABOUT  
A LOT ON A BIG SITE HERE BUT I  

01:11:27.972 --> 01:11:29.071
I MEAN WE&apos;RE NOT TALKING ABOUT  
A LOT ON A BIG SITE HERE BUT I  
DID GO BACK TO SCALE THE PLAN   

01:11:29.073 --> 01:11:29.938
A LOT ON A BIG SITE HERE BUT I  
DID GO BACK TO SCALE THE PLAN   
AND SAY WELL OK, WELL THIS THE  

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.374
DID GO BACK TO SCALE THE PLAN   
AND SAY WELL OK, WELL THIS THE  
SITE PLAN IT WAS THAT REALLY    

01:11:32.376 --> 01:11:33.075
AND SAY WELL OK, WELL THIS THE  
SITE PLAN IT WAS THAT REALLY    
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SCALE 

01:11:33.077 --> 01:11:33.609
SITE PLAN IT WAS THAT REALLY    
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SCALE 
OF OUR SITE PLANS.              

01:11:33.611 --> 01:11:36.478
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SCALE 
OF OUR SITE PLANS.              
WAS THAT EXACTLY LIKE WAS THE   

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.213
OF OUR SITE PLANS.              
WAS THAT EXACTLY LIKE WAS THE   
SITE TIME NO OFF JUST IN ERROR  

01:11:37.215 --> 01:11:38.113
WAS THAT EXACTLY LIKE WAS THE   
SITE TIME NO OFF JUST IN ERROR  
ON THE THING BUT IT SCALES      

01:11:38.115 --> 01:11:40.849
SITE TIME NO OFF JUST IN ERROR  
ON THE THING BUT IT SCALES      
CORRECTLY ON THAT BASED ON THE  

01:11:40.851 --> 01:11:41.584
ON THE THING BUT IT SCALES      
CORRECTLY ON THAT BASED ON THE  
SURVEY THAT WAS SUBMITTED AND   

01:11:41.586 --> 01:11:42.251
CORRECTLY ON THAT BASED ON THE  
SURVEY THAT WAS SUBMITTED AND   
THAT SITE PLAN WAS BUILT UPON   

01:11:42.253 --> 01:11:44.721
SURVEY THAT WAS SUBMITTED AND   
THAT SITE PLAN WAS BUILT UPON   
THAT SURVEY AND THEN WE MADE    

01:11:44.723 --> 01:11:45.588
THAT SITE PLAN WAS BUILT UPON   
THAT SURVEY AND THEN WE MADE    
THE SETBACKS WITH A LITTLE BIT  

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:48.190
THAT SURVEY AND THEN WE MADE    
THE SETBACKS WITH A LITTLE BIT  
OF WIGGLE ROOM UPON THAT SITE   

01:11:48.192 --> 01:11:48.958
THE SETBACKS WITH A LITTLE BIT  
OF WIGGLE ROOM UPON THAT SITE   
AND THAT WAS BASED ON THE       

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.625
OF WIGGLE ROOM UPON THAT SITE   
AND THAT WAS BASED ON THE       
SURVEY THAT SUBMITTED.          

01:11:49.627 --> 01:11:51.927
AND THAT WAS BASED ON THE       
SURVEY THAT SUBMITTED.          
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A CONVOLUTED  

01:11:51.929 --> 01:11:52.228
SURVEY THAT SUBMITTED.          
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A CONVOLUTED  
WAY.                            

01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:53.028
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A CONVOLUTED  
WAY.                            
SO I GUESS WE DON&apos;T KNOW        

01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.696
WAY.                            
SO I GUESS WE DON&apos;T KNOW        
EXACTLY WHERE ULTIMATELY I      

01:11:53.698 --> 01:11:56.232
SO I GUESS WE DON&apos;T KNOW        
EXACTLY WHERE ULTIMATELY I      
WOULD BELIEVE IT WOULD BE THE   

01:11:56.234 --> 01:11:56.965
EXACTLY WHERE ULTIMATELY I      
WOULD BELIEVE IT WOULD BE THE   
CIVIL ENGINEER, THE SURVEYOR    

01:11:56.967 --> 01:11:59.802
WOULD BELIEVE IT WOULD BE THE   
CIVIL ENGINEER, THE SURVEYOR    
THAT WOULD HAVE TO DEFINE       

01:11:59.804 --> 01:12:00.603
CIVIL ENGINEER, THE SURVEYOR    
THAT WOULD HAVE TO DEFINE       
EXACTLY WHERE THAT ERROR        

01:12:00.605 --> 01:12:01.204
THAT WOULD HAVE TO DEFINE       
EXACTLY WHERE THAT ERROR        
OCCURRED AND WHAT THEY WERE     

01:12:01.206 --> 01:12:02.004
EXACTLY WHERE THAT ERROR        
OCCURRED AND WHAT THEY WERE     
BASING THEIR MEASUREMENTS UPON. 

01:12:02.006 --> 01:12:03.740
OCCURRED AND WHAT THEY WERE     
BASING THEIR MEASUREMENTS UPON. 
YEAH, AND I DON&apos;T THINK WE      

01:12:03.742 --> 01:12:04.473
BASING THEIR MEASUREMENTS UPON. 
YEAH, AND I DON&apos;T THINK WE      
ACTUALLY NEED TO DO A WHOLE     

01:12:04.475 --> 01:12:07.209
YEAH, AND I DON&apos;T THINK WE      
ACTUALLY NEED TO DO A WHOLE     
FORENSIC ANALYSIS BUT I THERE   

01:12:07.211 --> 01:12:11.380
ACTUALLY NEED TO DO A WHOLE     
FORENSIC ANALYSIS BUT I THERE   
THERE WAS I WANTED TO JUST MAKE 

01:12:11.382 --> 01:12:12.214
FORENSIC ANALYSIS BUT I THERE   
THERE WAS I WANTED TO JUST MAKE 
SURE THAT THERE WASN&apos;T AN       

01:12:12.216 --> 01:12:15.784
THERE WAS I WANTED TO JUST MAKE 
SURE THAT THERE WASN&apos;T AN       
IMPLICATION THAT THE CITY WAS   

01:12:15.786 --> 01:12:19.755
SURE THAT THERE WASN&apos;T AN       
IMPLICATION THAT THE CITY WAS   
AT FAULT AND IN THE END WE ARE  

01:12:19.757 --> 01:12:26.161
IMPLICATION THAT THE CITY WAS   
AT FAULT AND IN THE END WE ARE  
TALKING ABOUT A FOOT OR TWO SO  

01:12:26.163 --> 01:12:30.432
AT FAULT AND IN THE END WE ARE  
TALKING ABOUT A FOOT OR TWO SO  
IT DOESN&apos;T SEEM ALL THAT        

01:12:30.434 --> 01:12:31.200
TALKING ABOUT A FOOT OR TWO SO  
IT DOESN&apos;T SEEM ALL THAT        
DISTRESSING THEN I WOULD LIKE   

01:12:31.202 --> 01:12:35.004
IT DOESN&apos;T SEEM ALL THAT        
DISTRESSING THEN I WOULD LIKE   
TO AGAIN GIVE VOICE TO ANOTHER  

01:12:35.006 --> 01:12:38.674
DISTRESSING THEN I WOULD LIKE   
TO AGAIN GIVE VOICE TO ANOTHER  
RESIDENTS QUESTION WHICH IS SO  

01:12:38.676 --> 01:12:41.510
TO AGAIN GIVE VOICE TO ANOTHER  
RESIDENTS QUESTION WHICH IS SO  
I WONDER, MR. LOCKWOOD, IF YOU  

01:12:41.512 --> 01:12:45.614
RESIDENTS QUESTION WHICH IS SO  
I WONDER, MR. LOCKWOOD, IF YOU  
COULD TELL US HOW YOU ARE       

01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:46.249
I WONDER, MR. LOCKWOOD, IF YOU  
COULD TELL US HOW YOU ARE       
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HEATING    

01:12:46.251 --> 01:12:49.284
COULD TELL US HOW YOU ARE       
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HEATING    
THE BUILDING.                   

01:12:49.286 --> 01:12:50.353
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HEATING    
THE BUILDING.                   
WERE YOU UNABLE TO FULFILL YOUR 

01:12:50.355 --> 01:12:53.689
THE BUILDING.                   
WERE YOU UNABLE TO FULFILL YOUR 
INTENTION TO MAKE IT ALL        

01:12:53.691 --> 01:12:56.893
WERE YOU UNABLE TO FULFILL YOUR 
INTENTION TO MAKE IT ALL        
ELECTRIC HEATING OR WERE YOU    

01:12:56.895 --> 01:13:01.130
INTENTION TO MAKE IT ALL        
ELECTRIC HEATING OR WERE YOU    
SOAKED TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT    

01:13:01.132 --> 01:13:04.199
ELECTRIC HEATING OR WERE YOU    
SOAKED TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT    
NOW THAT THE BUILDING IS        

01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:04.867
SOAKED TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT    
NOW THAT THE BUILDING IS        
PRIMARILY HEATED VIA A HIGH     

01:13:04.869 --> 01:13:07.903
NOW THAT THE BUILDING IS        
PRIMARILY HEATED VIA A HIGH     
EFFICIENCY NATURAL GAS BOILER   

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:08.838
PRIMARILY HEATED VIA A HIGH     
EFFICIENCY NATURAL GAS BOILER   
SYSTEM WHICH IS I THINK THAT    

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.574
EFFICIENCY NATURAL GAS BOILER   
SYSTEM WHICH IS I THINK THAT    
WAS WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AT THE   

01:13:12.576 --> 01:13:13.242
SYSTEM WHICH IS I THINK THAT    
WAS WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AT THE   
TIME OF APPROVAL IS THAT WE     

01:13:13.244 --> 01:13:16.178
WAS WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AT THE   
TIME OF APPROVAL IS THAT WE     
WOULD SUBMIT A WAIVER TO THE    

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:16.845
TIME OF APPROVAL IS THAT WE     
WOULD SUBMIT A WAIVER TO THE    
DESIGN STANDARDS OF MICHIGAN    

01:13:16.847 --> 01:13:17.446
WOULD SUBMIT A WAIVER TO THE

YOU COULD ANYBODY ELSE.         
I HAVE PROCEDURAL QUESTIONS AS  

01:14:04.462 --> 01:14:08.898
YOU COULD ANYBODY ELSE.         
I HAVE PROCEDURAL QUESTIONS AS  
I UNDERSTAND PUDI IF IT&apos;S NOT

I HAVE PROCEDURAL QUESTIONS AS  
I UNDERSTAND PUDI IF IT&apos;S NOT   
WRITTEN IN THE PUDI IT FALLS    

01:14:09.701 --> 01:14:13.102
I UNDERSTAND PUDI IF IT&apos;S NOT   
WRITTEN IN THE PUDI IT FALLS    
BACK TO OUR BASE UDC TEXT       

01:14:13.104 --> 01:14:16.305
WRITTEN IN THE PUDI IT FALLS    
BACK TO OUR BASE UDC TEXT       
CORRECT?                        

01:14:16.307 --> 01:14:23.413
BACK TO OUR BASE UDC TEXT       
CORRECT?                        
WELL FOR WHAT WHAT WHAT SO      

01:14:37.761 --> 01:14:40.429
BECAUSE WE WERE PLANNED         
PROJECTS AND CREATED LANGUAGE   
ABOUT AVERAGING SETBACK AND     

01:14:40.431 --> 01:14:41.297
PROJECTS AND CREATED LANGUAGE   
ABOUT AVERAGING SETBACK AND     
SETBACK JUST AS PART OF OUR     

01:14:41.299 --> 01:14:42.365
ABOUT AVERAGING SETBACK AND     
SETBACK JUST AS PART OF OUR     
BASE UDC AND OUR BASE UDC ALSO  

01:14:42.367 --> 01:14:43.032
SETBACK JUST AS PART OF OUR     
BASE UDC AND OUR BASE UDC ALSO  
HAS MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM SET      

01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:43.366
BASE UDC AND OUR BASE UDC ALSO  
HAS MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM SET      
BACKS.                          

01:14:43.368 --> 01:14:44.033
HAS MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM SET      
BACKS.                          
I&apos;M CURIOUS WHY THAT PART       

01:14:44.035 --> 01:14:44.767
BACKS.                          
I&apos;M CURIOUS WHY THAT PART       
OF OUR UDC THAT ALLOWS THAT     

01:14:44.769 --> 01:14:45.435
I&apos;M CURIOUS WHY THAT PART       
OF OUR UDC THAT ALLOWS THAT     
SETBACK AVERAGING DIDN&apos;T APPLY  

01:14:45.437 --> 01:14:46.035
OF OUR UDC THAT ALLOWS THAT     
SETBACK AVERAGING DIDN&apos;T APPLY  
TO THIS PROJECT?                

01:14:46.037 --> 01:14:46.702
SETBACK AVERAGING DIDN&apos;T APPLY  
TO THIS PROJECT?                
WELL I THINK YOU&apos;D PROBABLY     

01:14:46.704 --> 01:14:47.503
TO THIS PROJECT?                
WELL I THINK YOU&apos;D PROBABLY     
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE WROTE I 

01:14:47.505 --> 01:14:48.071
WELL I THINK YOU&apos;D PROBABLY     
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE WROTE I 
LIKE IF IT&apos;S EXCLUDED YOU&apos;RE    

01:14:48.073 --> 01:14:48.804
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE WROTE I 
LIKE IF IT&apos;S EXCLUDED YOU&apos;RE    
SAYING IT WOULD IF WE DON&apos;T     

01:14:48.806 --> 01:14:50.806
LIKE IF IT&apos;S EXCLUDED YOU&apos;RE    
SAYING IT WOULD IF WE DON&apos;T     
WRITE IT IN THERE AND IT&apos;S      

01:14:50.808 --> 01:14:51.540
SAYING IT WOULD IF WE DON&apos;T     
WRITE IT IN THERE AND IT&apos;S      
AUTOMATIC BUT WE ADDRESS THE    

01:14:51.542 --> 01:14:54.643
WRITE IT IN THERE AND IT&apos;S      
AUTOMATIC BUT WE ADDRESS THE    
SET SETBACK SPECIFICALLY HERE.  

01:14:54.645 --> 01:14:55.711
AUTOMATIC BUT WE ADDRESS THE    
SET SETBACK SPECIFICALLY HERE.  
I THINK IT&apos;D BE DIFFERENT IF WE 

01:14:55.713 --> 01:14:56.412
SET SETBACK SPECIFICALLY HERE.  
I THINK IT&apos;D BE DIFFERENT IF WE 
DIDN&apos;T ADDRESS THE SETBACKS     

01:14:56.414 --> 01:14:57.446
I THINK IT&apos;D BE DIFFERENT IF WE 
DIDN&apos;T ADDRESS THE SETBACKS     
THEN THAT MAYBE THAT WOULD KICK 

01:14:57.448 --> 01:14:58.114
DIDN&apos;T ADDRESS THE SETBACKS     
THEN THAT MAYBE THAT WOULD KICK 
IN THAT QUALIFICATION.          

01:14:58.116 --> 01:14:58.981
THEN THAT MAYBE THAT WOULD KICK 
IN THAT QUALIFICATION.          
BUT WE WE DO ADDRESS THE        

01:14:58.983 --> 01:15:01.851
IN THAT QUALIFICATION.          
BUT WE WE DO ADDRESS THE        
SETBACKS HERE AND WE DON&apos;T      

01:15:01.853 --> 01:15:02.385
BUT WE WE DO ADDRESS THE        
SETBACKS HERE AND WE DON&apos;T      
ALLOW FOR AVERAGING             

01:15:02.387 --> 01:15:03.052
SETBACKS HERE AND WE DON&apos;T      
ALLOW FOR AVERAGING             
SPECIFICALLY IN THESE PADS.     

01:15:03.054 --> 01:15:06.221
ALLOW FOR AVERAGING             
SPECIFICALLY IN THESE PADS.     
SO I THINK IF IT WAS IF WE      

01:15:06.223 --> 01:15:06.855
SPECIFICALLY IN THESE PADS.     
SO I THINK IF IT WAS IF WE      
WEREN&apos;T NOTING A SETBACK        

01:15:06.857 --> 01:15:09.491
SO I THINK IF IT WAS IF WE      
WEREN&apos;T NOTING A SETBACK        
SPECIFICALLY HERE&apos;S THE RANGE   

01:15:09.493 --> 01:15:10.493
WEREN&apos;T NOTING A SETBACK        
SPECIFICALLY HERE&apos;S THE RANGE   
THEN IT WOULD FALL BACK TO THAT 

01:15:10.495 --> 01:15:13.162
SPECIFICALLY HERE&apos;S THE RANGE   
THEN IT WOULD FALL BACK TO THAT 
THAT UNDERLYING ZONING          

01:15:13.164 --> 01:15:13.963
THEN IT WOULD FALL BACK TO THAT 
THAT UNDERLYING ZONING          
DISTRICT, THE AVERAGE SORT      

01:15:13.965 --> 01:15:17.399
THAT UNDERLYING ZONING          
DISTRICT, THE AVERAGE SORT      
OF THING SPECIFIC WAS LIKE OK,  

01:15:17.401 --> 01:15:21.203
DISTRICT, THE AVERAGE SORT      
OF THING SPECIFIC WAS LIKE OK,  
SO IN A PUDI OUTLINE A SET BACK 

01:15:21.205 --> 01:15:24.706
OF THING SPECIFIC WAS LIKE OK,  
SO IN A PUDI OUTLINE A SET BACK 
IT&apos;S A FIRM NO IT DOESN&apos;T ADOPT 

01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:25.707
SO IN A PUDI OUTLINE A SET BACK 
IT&apos;S A FIRM NO IT DOESN&apos;T ADOPT 
SAME FLEXIBILITY AS THE REST    

01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:28.777
IT&apos;S A FIRM NO IT DOESN&apos;T ADOPT 
SAME FLEXIBILITY AS THE REST    
OF OUR ADC WE LOOK YES THAT&apos;S   

01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:29.611

CORRECT BECAUSE AGAIN I LOOK    

01:15:29.613 --> 01:15:30.379

NOT TO NOT TO AVOID COMING      
ABOARD.                         

01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:33.849
NOT TO NOT TO AVOID COMING      
ABOARD.                         
IT WAS A RELATIVELY MINOR ISSUE 

01:15:33.851 --> 01:15:34.583
