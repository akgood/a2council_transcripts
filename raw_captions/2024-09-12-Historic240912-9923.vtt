01:10:38.428 --> 01:10:41.462
I THINK IN THIS CASE YOU DO     
HAVE ON THE NORTH SIDE AND THEN 
WHAT WE'RE UNFORTUNATELY YOU    

01:10:41.464 --> 01:10:42.530

01:10:42.532 --> 01:10:45.799
WHAT WE'RE UNFORTUNATELY YOU    
SEE THIS SIDE BUT WHAT WHAT IS  
HAPPENING IS THAT THEY ARE

HAPPENING IS THAT THEY ARE      
TRYING TO KEEP THE ADDITION AS  
I GUESS NARROW OR AS LESS DEEP  

01:10:53.309 --> 01:10:53.708
TRYING TO KEEP THE ADDITION AS  
I GUESS NARROW OR AS LESS DEEP  
AS POSSIBLE.                    

01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:54.642
I GUESS NARROW OR AS LESS DEEP  
AS POSSIBLE.                    
THEY PROBABLY COULD HAVE FIT    

01:10:54.644 --> 01:10:57.945
AS POSSIBLE.                    
THEY PROBABLY COULD HAVE FIT    
EVERYTHING THEY WANTED BUT THEY 

01:10:57.947 --> 01:10:58.579
THEY PROBABLY COULD HAVE FIT    
EVERYTHING THEY WANTED BUT THEY 
WOULD BE THEN LOSING THEIR      

01:10:58.581 --> 01:10:59.447
EVERYTHING THEY WANTED BUT THEY 
WOULD BE THEN LOSING THEIR      
BACKYARD, GETTING CLOSER TO THE 

01:10:59.449 --> 01:11:01.749
WOULD BE THEN LOSING THEIR      
BACKYARD, GETTING CLOSER TO THE 
NEIGHBORS.                      

01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:03.117
BACKYARD, GETTING CLOSER TO THE 
NEIGHBORS.                      
SO IT SEEMS TO ME TO FIT THE    

01:11:03.119 --> 01:11:06.287
NEIGHBORS.                      
SO IT SEEMS TO ME TO FIT THE    
BEDROOM, THE KITCHEN THEY THEY  

01:11:06.289 --> 01:11:09.357
SO IT SEEMS TO ME TO FIT THE    
BEDROOM, THE KITCHEN THEY THEY  
BUMPED OUT AND THEN CHOSE TO    

01:11:09.359 --> 01:11:12.794

SUBORDINATE SUBORDINATED WITH   
THE LIKE THE LOWER ROOFLINE AND 

01:11:13.896 --> 01:11:17.464
SUBORDINATE SUBORDINATED WITH   
THE LIKE THE LOWER ROOFLINE AND 
AND WHILE KEEPING IT NOT QUITE  

01:11:17.466 --> 01:11:21.069
THE LIKE THE LOWER ROOFLINE AND 
AND WHILE KEEPING IT NOT QUITE  
AS FAR IT'S THE THREE FEET BUMP

AS FAR IT'S THE THREE FEET BUMP 
OUT VERSUS THE FIVE FEET.       

01:11:21.771 --> 01:11:23.904
AS FAR IT'S THE THREE FEET BUMP 
OUT VERSUS THE FIVE FEET.       
I THINK WHEN I ORIGINALLY SAW   

01:11:23.906 --> 01:11:24.906
