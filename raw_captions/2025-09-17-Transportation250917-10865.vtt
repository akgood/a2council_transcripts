THE VERY FIRST WAREHOUSE CLAUSE 

00:14:35.137 --> 00:14:36.103
OF THE FIVE HOUR GAP IN THE WAY 
THE VERY FIRST WAREHOUSE CLAUSE 
TO WALK OUT FROM PACARD         

00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:38.773

INSTEAD OF CASTING IT UPWARD    
AND THE COLOR TEMPERATURE       

00:49:44.312 --> 00:49:45.010
INSTEAD OF CASTING IT UPWARD    
AND THE COLOR TEMPERATURE       
CORRELATES A LOT TO THE WAY     

00:49:45.012 --> 00:49:47.546

OF CONNECT TO EACH OTHER BUT    
THOSE ARE I THINK OUR           
UNDERSTANDING IS THESE ARE ALL  

00:59:44.077 --> 00:59:47.312
THOSE ARE I THINK OUR           
UNDERSTANDING IS THESE ARE ALL  
THE MULTI LANE ROADWAYS IN THE  

00:59:47.314 --> 00:59:50.181
UNDERSTANDING IS THESE ARE ALL  
THE MULTI LANE ROADWAYS IN THE  
CITY'S JURISDICTION SO AND      

00:59:50.183 --> 00:59:50.982
THE MULTI LANE ROADWAYS IN THE  
CITY'S JURISDICTION SO AND      
WE'VE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE   

00:59:50.984 --> 00:59:54.085
CITY'S JURISDICTION SO AND      
WE'VE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE   
LOOKED AT IS THE PAST WORK      

00:59:54.087 --> 00:59:54.853
WE'VE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE   
LOOKED AT IS THE PAST WORK      
THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE CITY.   

00:59:54.855 --> 00:59:59.524
LOOKED AT IS THE PAST WORK      
THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE CITY.   
SO IN 2005 THERE WAS A STUDY    

00:59:59.526 --> 01:00:00.258
THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE CITY.   
SO IN 2005 THERE WAS A STUDY    
OF A NUMBER OF CORRIDORS AND    

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.527
SO IN 2005 THERE WAS A STUDY    
OF A NUMBER OF CORRIDORS AND    
THE CRITERIA THAT THEY USED     

01:00:02.529 --> 01:00:05.930
OF A NUMBER OF CORRIDORS AND    
THE CRITERIA THAT THEY USED     
WERE TRAFFIC DATA HEAVILY AND   

01:00:05.932 --> 01:00:06.698
THE CRITERIA THAT THEY USED     
WERE TRAFFIC DATA HEAVILY AND   
LOOKING FOR IN THIS CASE        

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:10.835
WERE TRAFFIC DATA HEAVILY AND   
LOOKING FOR IN THIS CASE        
STREETS THAT HAD A MAXIMUM      

01:00:10.837 --> 01:00:11.903
LOOKING FOR IN THIS CASE        
STREETS THAT HAD A MAXIMUM      
OF 800 VEHICLES PER HOUR AS A   

01:00:11.905 --> 01:00:14.673
STREETS THAT HAD A MAXIMUM

GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A ROAD DIET  

01:00:14.675 --> 01:00:15.340
OF 800 VEHICLES PER HOUR AS A   
GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A ROAD DIET  
THOUGH NOT CERTAINLY A HARD     

01:00:15.342 --> 01:00:18.677
GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A ROAD DIET  
THOUGH NOT CERTAINLY A HARD     
RULE THEY LOOKED CRAFT DATA AND 

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:21.947
THOUGH NOT CERTAINLY A HARD     
RULE THEY LOOKED CRAFT DATA AND 
OBVIOUSLY THE KINDS OF CRASHES  

01:00:21.949 --> 01:00:22.880
RULE THEY LOOKED CRAFT DATA AND 
OBVIOUSLY THE KINDS OF CRASHES  
THAT A ROADWAY RECONFIGURATION  

01:00:22.882 --> 01:00:26.384
OBVIOUSLY THE KINDS OF CRASHES  
THAT A ROADWAY RECONFIGURATION  
WOULD BENEFIT FROM REDUCING     

01:00:26.386 --> 01:00:26.784
THAT A ROADWAY RECONFIGURATION  
WOULD BENEFIT FROM REDUCING     
CRASHES.                        

01:00:26.786 --> 01:00:29.387
WOULD BENEFIT FROM REDUCING     
CRASHES.                        
AND ANOTHER THING IS DRIVEWAY   

01:00:29.389 --> 01:00:33.991
CRASHES.                        
AND ANOTHER THING IS DRIVEWAY   
DENSITY WITH THE MORE FREQUENT  

01:00:33.993 --> 01:00:34.759
AND ANOTHER THING IS DRIVEWAY   
DENSITY WITH THE MORE FREQUENT  
DRIVEWAY DENSITY WOULD INDICATE 

01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:37.228
DENSITY WITH THE MORE FREQUENT  
DRIVEWAY DENSITY WOULD INDICATE 
MORE BENEFIT FROM POTENTIALLY A 

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.762
DRIVEWAY DENSITY WOULD INDICATE 
MORE BENEFIT FROM POTENTIALLY A 
RECONFIGURATION.                

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:41.099
MORE BENEFIT FROM POTENTIALLY A 
RECONFIGURATION.                
IT WOULD PROVIDE A CENTER       

01:00:41.101 --> 01:00:42.100
RECONFIGURATION.                
IT WOULD PROVIDE A CENTER       
OF TURN LANE AND THE IMAGES ON  

01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:45.203
IT WOULD PROVIDE A CENTER       
OF TURN LANE AND THE IMAGES ON  
THE RIGHT SHOW A COUPLE         

01:00:45.205 --> 01:00:45.937
OF TURN LANE AND THE IMAGES ON  
THE RIGHT SHOW A COUPLE         
EXAMPLES FROM THESE REPORTS

EXAMPLES FROM THESE REPORTS     
FROM ONE OF THE CORRIDORS WHERE 
THERE IS AN EXISTING CONDITION  

01:00:50.077 --> 01:00:53.678
FROM ONE OF THE CORRIDORS WHERE 
THERE IS AN EXISTING CONDITION  
WITH MULTIPLE TURN LANES IN     

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.312
THERE IS AN EXISTING CONDITION  
WITH MULTIPLE TURN LANES IN     
SOME CASES AND THEN PROPOSED    

01:00:54.314 --> 01:00:57.516
WITH MULTIPLE TURN LANES IN     
SOME CASES AND THEN PROPOSED    
CONDITIONS SHOWING A REDUCTION  

01:00:57.518 --> 01:00:58.383
SOME CASES AND THEN PROPOSED    
CONDITIONS SHOWING A REDUCTION  
IN THE TRAVEL LANES AND THE     

01:00:58.385 --> 01:01:00.585
CONDITIONS SHOWING A REDUCTION  
IN THE TRAVEL LANES AND THE     
ADDITION OF BIKE LANES AND IN   

01:01:00.587 --> 01:01:01.452
IN THE TRAVEL LANES AND THE     
ADDITION OF BIKE LANES AND IN   
PARTICULAR THE LOWER FIGURE IS  

01:01:01.454 --> 01:01:05.023
ADDITION OF BIKE LANES AND IN   
PARTICULAR THE LOWER FIGURE IS  
WHAT WE THINK OF AS A CLASSIC   

01:01:05.025 --> 01:01:05.756
PARTICULAR THE LOWER FIGURE IS  
WHAT WE THINK OF AS A CLASSIC   
ROAD DIET WHERE THE EXISTING    

01:01:05.758 --> 01:01:08.726
WHAT WE THINK OF AS A CLASSIC   
ROAD DIET WHERE THE EXISTING    
CONDITION IN THIS CASE WAS FOR  

01:01:08.728 --> 01:01:09.360
ROAD DIET WHERE THE EXISTING    
CONDITION IN THIS CASE WAS FOR  
TRAVEL LANES TO IN EACH         

01:01:09.362 --> 01:01:12.330
CONDITION IN THIS CASE WAS FOR  
TRAVEL LANES TO IN EACH         
DIRECTION AND THE PROPOSED      

01:01:12.332 --> 01:01:13.131
TRAVEL LANES TO IN EACH         
DIRECTION AND THE PROPOSED      
FUTURE CONDITION WAS ONE TRAVEL 

01:01:13.133 --> 01:01:16.400
DIRECTION AND THE PROPOSED      
FUTURE CONDITION WAS ONE TRAVEL 
LANE IN EACH DIRECTION A CENTER 

01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:17.335
FUTURE CONDITION WAS ONE TRAVEL 
LANE IN EACH DIRECTION A CENTER 
LEFT TURN LANE AND BICYCLE      

01:01:17.337 --> 01:01:19.370
LANE IN EACH DIRECTION A CENTER 
LEFT TURN LANE AND BICYCLE      
LANES.

LEFT TURN LANE AND BICYCLE      
LANES.                          
SO AGAIN THERE'S A LOT          

01:01:20.406 --> 01:01:23.441
LANES.                          
SO AGAIN THERE'S A LOT          
OF DIFFERENCES IN THE EXISTING  

01:01:23.443 --> 01:01:24.209
SO AGAIN THERE'S A LOT          
OF DIFFERENCES IN THE EXISTING  
CONDITIONS BUT THAT'S ONE THAT  

01:01:24.211 --> 01:01:28.112
OF DIFFERENCES IN THE EXISTING  
CONDITIONS BUT THAT'S ONE THAT  
TYPICALLY LOOKED OUT FOR THOSE  

01:01:28.114 --> 01:01:31.382

TYPICALLY LOOKED OUT FOR THOSE  
TYPES OF ROADS.                 

01:01:31.384 --> 01:01:32.617
TYPICALLY LOOKED OUT FOR THOSE  
TYPES OF ROADS.                 
IN 2019 THERE WAS ANOTHER SET

WHERE WHAT ARE GOOD CANDIDATES  
FOR ROAD DIETS AND AGAIN IN     

01:01:51.672 --> 01:01:54.739
WHERE WHAT ARE GOOD CANDIDATES  
FOR ROAD DIETS AND AGAIN IN     
THESE CASES ROAD DIETS ARE      

01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:55.440
FOR ROAD DIETS AND AGAIN IN     
THESE CASES ROAD DIETS ARE      
DEFINED AS TAKING A FOUR TO

01:06:19.472 --> 01:06:20.237
WHERE OUR APPROACH NOW IS GOING

OF COURSE IT'LL CONSIDER        

01:06:20.239 --> 01:06:22.139
TO TAKE A BROADER FOCUS.        
OF COURSE IT'LL CONSIDER        
CONGESTION BUT ALSO FOCUS       

01:06:22.141 --> 01:06:22.940
OF COURSE IT'LL CONSIDER        
CONGESTION BUT ALSO FOCUS       
SAFETY AND COMMUNITY GOALS AND  

01:06:22.942 --> 01:06:26.911
CONGESTION BUT ALSO FOCUS       
SAFETY AND COMMUNITY GOALS AND  
ALSO CONSIDER THOSE NEGATIVE    

01:06:26.913 --> 01:06:27.545
SAFETY AND COMMUNITY GOALS AND  
ALSO CONSIDER THOSE NEGATIVE    
CONSEQUENCES OF TOO MUCH        

01:06:27.547 --> 01:06:31.415
ALSO CONSIDER THOSE NEGATIVE    
CONSEQUENCES OF TOO MUCH        
CAPACITY IN MORE CONVENTIONAL   

01:06:31.417 --> 01:06:34.218
CONSEQUENCES OF TOO MUCH        
CAPACITY IN MORE CONVENTIONAL   
APPROACHES THAT WE JUST         

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:34.585
CAPACITY IN MORE CONVENTIONAL   
APPROACHES THAT WE JUST         
REVIEWED.                       

01:06:34.587 --> 01:06:35.453
APPROACHES THAT WE JUST         
REVIEWED.                       
THERE'S A TYPICAL FOCUS ON THE

01:06:38.724 --> 01:06:39.390
THERE'S A TYPICAL FOCUS ON THE  
PEAK HOUR OR EVEN THE PEAK      
FIFTEEN MINUTES OF TRAFFIC      

01:06:39.392 --> 01:06:42.693
PEAK HOUR OR EVEN THE PEAK      
FIFTEEN MINUTES OF TRAFFIC      
OPERATIONS WE'RE IN THIS

OPERATIONS WE'RE IN THIS        
APPROACH.                       
WE'LL LOOK MORE AT A TWENTY

01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:07.118
DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN THE       
TYPICAL APPROACHES IN THE PAST  
FOR ROAD DIETS THE THOUGHT IS   

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:07.785
TYPICAL APPROACHES IN THE PAST  
FOR ROAD DIETS THE THOUGHT IS   
THAT YOUR FIRST LOOK AT WHAT    

01:07:07.787 --> 01:07:08.586
FOR ROAD DIETS THE THOUGHT IS   
THAT YOUR FIRST LOOK AT WHAT    
MOTOR VEHICLES NEED AND THEN    

01:07:08.588 --> 01:07:09.254
THAT YOUR FIRST LOOK AT WHAT    
MOTOR VEHICLES NEED AND THEN    
USE THE LEFTOVER SPACE FOR      

01:07:09.256 --> 01:07:09.987
MOTOR VEHICLES NEED AND THEN    
USE THE LEFTOVER SPACE FOR      
OTHER THINGS THAT THE COMMUNITY 

01:07:09.989 --> 01:07:10.655
USE THE LEFTOVER SPACE FOR      
OTHER THINGS THAT THE COMMUNITY 
MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ON THEIR     

01:07:10.657 --> 01:07:11.389
OTHER THINGS THAT THE COMMUNITY 
MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ON THEIR     
STREETS LIKE SIDEWALK BIKE      

01:07:11.391 --> 01:07:12.189
MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ON THEIR     
STREETS LIKE SIDEWALK BIKE

TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND OTHER 
THINGS.                         
WE'LL LOOK AT MITIGATION.       

01:07:54.801 --> 01:07:55.633
THINGS.

WE'LL LOOK AT MITIGATION.       
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS     
THAT COULD BE DONE TO MAKE THE

EACH OF THESE STEPS AND WE'LL   
HAVE AN EXAMPLE APPLICATION     
WITH ONE OF THE CORRIDORS.      

01:08:15.555 --> 01:08:16.720
HAVE AN EXAMPLE APPLICATION     
WITH ONE OF THE CORRIDORS.      
SO NOW I'M SHOWING A SLIDE

WITH ONE OF THE CORRIDORS.      
SO NOW I'M SHOWING A SLIDE      
OF THE SCREENING PROCESS THAT   

01:08:19.759 --> 01:08:20.524
SO NOW I'M SHOWING A SLIDE      
OF THE SCREENING PROCESS THAT   
WILL USE AGAIN IT'S FOLLOWING   

01:08:20.526 --> 01:08:23.728
OF THE SCREENING PROCESS THAT   
WILL USE AGAIN IT'S FOLLOWING   
THIS ONE REPORT METHODOLOGY     

01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:27.732
WILL USE AGAIN IT'S FOLLOWING   
THIS ONE REPORT METHODOLOGY     
PRETTY CLOSELY IF WE ADAPTED A  

01:08:27.734 --> 01:08:28.332
THIS ONE REPORT METHODOLOGY     
PRETTY CLOSELY IF WE ADAPTED A  
LITTLE BIT AS NEEDED.           

01:08:28.334 --> 01:08:30.801
PRETTY CLOSELY IF WE ADAPTED A  
LITTLE BIT AS NEEDED.           
BUT THERE'S FOUR BASIC STEPS IN 

01:08:30.803 --> 01:08:31.268
LITTLE BIT AS NEEDED.           
BUT THERE'S FOUR BASIC STEPS IN 
THIS PROCESS.                   

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:34.839
BUT THERE'S FOUR BASIC STEPS IN 
THIS PROCESS.                   
FIRST WE ACTUALLY START OUT     

01:08:34.841 --> 01:08:35.573
THIS PROCESS.                   
FIRST WE ACTUALLY START OUT     
CONSIDERING WHAT ARE THE        

01:08:35.575 --> 01:08:38.475
FIRST WE ACTUALLY START OUT     
CONSIDERING WHAT ARE THE        
POTENTIAL RECONFIGURED CROSS    

01:08:38.477 --> 01:08:39.410
CONSIDERING WHAT ARE THE        
POTENTIAL RECONFIGURED CROSS    
SECTIONS SO WE KNOW WHAT THE    

01:08:39.412 --> 01:08:40.178
POTENTIAL RECONFIGURED CROSS    
SECTIONS SO WE KNOW WHAT THE    
EXISTING ONES A LOT OF THESE    

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.547
SECTIONS SO WE KNOW WHAT THE    
EXISTING ONES A LOT OF THESE    
ARE TO TEND TO BE FIVE LANE     

01:08:42.549 --> 01:08:43.414
EXISTING ONES A LOT OF THESE    
ARE TO TEND TO BE FIVE LANE     
STREETS WITH TWO LANES IN EACH  

01:08:43.416 --> 01:08:47.084
ARE TO TEND TO BE FIVE LANE     
STREETS WITH TWO LANES IN EACH  
DIRECTION TO TURN LANES AND     

01:08:47.086 --> 01:08:49.753
STREETS WITH TWO LANES IN EACH  
DIRECTION TO TURN LANES AND     
WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR A     

01:08:49.755 --> 01:08:50.421
DIRECTION TO TURN LANES AND     
WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR A     
RECONFIGURED STREET AND TO      

01:08:50.423 --> 01:08:54.191
WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR A     
RECONFIGURED STREET AND TO      
THINK ABOUT THAT WILL LOOK AT   

01:08:54.193 --> 01:08:54.792
RECONFIGURED STREET AND TO      
THINK ABOUT THAT WILL LOOK AT   
THE CITY'S OTHER PLANS.         

01:08:54.794 --> 01:08:55.526
THINK ABOUT THAT WILL LOOK AT   
THE CITY'S OTHER PLANS.         
YOU KNOW, THERE'S TRANSIT       

01:08:55.528 --> 01:08:58.262
THE CITY'S OTHER PLANS.         
YOU KNOW, THERE'S TRANSIT       
CORRIDORS ARE MAPPED OUT.       

01:08:58.264 --> 01:08:59.096
YOU KNOW, THERE'S TRANSIT       
CORRIDORS ARE MAPPED OUT.       
YOU HAVE BIKE NETWORK MAPPED    

01:08:59.098 --> 01:09:02.433
CORRIDORS ARE MAPPED OUT.       
YOU HAVE BIKE NETWORK MAPPED    
OUT AND WILL BRING IN ALL THAT  

01:09:02.435 --> 01:09:03.234
YOU HAVE BIKE NETWORK MAPPED    
OUT AND WILL BRING IN ALL THAT  
INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHAT   

01:09:03.236 --> 01:09:05.603
OUT AND WILL BRING IN ALL THAT  
INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHAT   
WOULD BE AN OPTIMAL FUTURE      

01:09:05.605 --> 01:09:08.673
INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHAT   
WOULD BE AN OPTIMAL FUTURE      
CROSS SECTION AND THEN WE'RE    

01:09:08.675 --> 01:09:09.407
WOULD BE AN OPTIMAL FUTURE      
CROSS SECTION AND THEN WE'RE    
GOING TO COLLECT EXISTING       

01:09:09.409 --> 01:09:12.543
CROSS SECTION AND THEN WE'RE    
GOING TO COLLECT EXISTING       
CONDITIONS SPEED AND VOLUME     

01:09:12.545 --> 01:09:12.943
GOING TO COLLECT EXISTING       
CONDITIONS SPEED AND VOLUME

WE'LL HAVE WHAT WE CALL         
ACCOUNTS AUTOMATIC TRAFFIC      

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:17.481
WE'LL HAVE WHAT WE CALL         
ACCOUNTS AUTOMATIC TRAFFIC      
RECORDER THAT SHOULD BE OUT ANY 

01:09:17.483 --> 01:09:17.882
ACCOUNTS AUTOMATIC TRAFFIC      
RECORDER THAT SHOULD BE OUT ANY 
MOMENT NOW.

RECORDER THAT SHOULD BE OUT ANY 
MOMENT NOW.                     
WE'RE HOPING AND IT WILL        

01:09:21.187 --> 01:09:21.986
MOMENT NOW.                     
WE'RE HOPING AND IT WILL        
COLLECT HOURLY DATA THROUGHOUT  

01:09:21.988 --> 01:09:24.154
WE'RE HOPING AND IT WILL        
COLLECT HOURLY DATA THROUGHOUT  
A SEVEN DAY PERIOD.             

01:09:24.156 --> 01:09:25.222
COLLECT HOURLY DATA THROUGHOUT  
A SEVEN DAY PERIOD.             
SO HAVE A REALLY GOOD HANDLE ON 

01:09:25.224 --> 01:09:27.592
A SEVEN DAY PERIOD.             
SO HAVE A REALLY GOOD HANDLE ON 
WHAT THE DAILY PATTERNS ARE     

01:09:27.594 --> 01:09:28.659
SO HAVE A REALLY GOOD HANDLE ON 
WHAT THE DAILY PATTERNS ARE     
HOURLY PATTERNS AND THEN THE    

01:09:28.661 --> 01:09:32.297
WHAT THE DAILY PATTERNS ARE     
HOURLY PATTERNS AND THEN THE    
THIRD STEP WILL BE WE'LL LOOK   

01:09:32.299 --> 01:09:35.767
HOURLY PATTERNS AND THEN THE    
THIRD STEP WILL BE WE'LL LOOK   
AT THE BASELINE SIGNAL CAPACITY 

01:09:35.769 --> 01:09:36.701
THIRD STEP WILL BE WE'LL LOOK   
AT THE BASELINE SIGNAL CAPACITY 
FOR BOTH THE EXISTING CONDITION 

01:09:36.703 --> 01:09:40.104
AT THE BASELINE SIGNAL CAPACITY 
FOR BOTH THE EXISTING CONDITION 
AND THE PROPOSED CONDITIONS     

01:09:40.106 --> 01:09:41.072
FOR BOTH THE EXISTING CONDITION 
AND THE PROPOSED CONDITIONS     
THAT WE, YOU KNOW, THINK        

01:09:41.074 --> 01:09:44.342
AND THE PROPOSED CONDITIONS     
THAT WE, YOU KNOW, THINK        
OF WOULD BE THE OPTIMAL AGAIN   

01:09:44.344 --> 01:09:45.276
THAT WE, YOU KNOW, THINK        
OF WOULD BE THE OPTIMAL AGAIN   
BASED ON WHAT THE CITY'S PLANS  

01:09:45.278 --> 01:09:48.613
OF WOULD BE THE OPTIMAL AGAIN   
BASED ON WHAT THE CITY'S PLANS  
ARE AND THEN WE'LL COMPARE WHAT 

01:09:48.615 --> 01:09:51.115
BASED ON WHAT THE CITY'S PLANS  
ARE AND THEN WE'LL COMPARE WHAT 
THOSE OPERATIONS ARE TO THE     

01:09:51.117 --> 01:09:51.782
ARE AND THEN WE'LL COMPARE WHAT 
THOSE OPERATIONS ARE TO THE     
THRESHOLDS FOR ROADWAY          

01:09:51.784 --> 01:09:54.919
THOSE OPERATIONS ARE TO THE     
THRESHOLDS FOR ROADWAY          
RECONFIGURATION.                

01:09:54.921 --> 01:09:56.120
THRESHOLDS FOR ROADWAY          
RECONFIGURATION.                
AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS AND I'LL 

01:09:56.122 --> 01:09:56.721
RECONFIGURATION.                
AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS AND I'LL 
SHOW YOU AGAIN SHOWED THE       

01:09:56.723 --> 01:09:59.457
AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS AND I'LL 
SHOW YOU AGAIN SHOWED THE       
EXAMPLE BUT WHAT WHAT IS A      

01:09:59.459 --> 01:10:02.659

EXAMPLE BUT WHAT WHAT IS A      
TOLERABLE CONDITION IN TERMS    
OF ROAD TRAFFIC BEING A LITTLE  

01:10:03.696 --> 01:10:07.699
TOLERABLE CONDITION IN TERMS

01:10:07.701 --> 01:10:08.499
OF ROAD TRAFFIC BEING A LITTLE  
CONGESTED FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER  
OF HOURS OF THE DAY OR DO WE    

01:10:08.501 --> 01:10:11.102
CONGESTED FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER  
OF HOURS OF THE DAY OR DO WE    
NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALTERNATE

OF HOURS OF THE DAY OR DO WE    
NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALTERNATE   
ROUTES AND ALTERNATE MODES OR   

01:10:12.071 --> 01:10:14.104
NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALTERNATE

01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:17.809
WHATNOT?                        
AND SO IF WE'RE BELOW THAT      
THRESHOLD, A TYPICAL THRESHOLD

THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION THAT   

01:11:24.977 --> 01:11:25.643
WHOLE CORRIDOR WE'RE LOOKING AT 
THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION THAT   
WE FOCUSED ON IS NEAR EASY      

01:11:25.645 --> 01:11:28.512
THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION THAT   
WE FOCUSED ON IS NEAR EASY      
STREET WHERE THERE WAS SOME

WE'RE ABLE TO USE.              

01:11:29.849 --> 01:11:32.349
TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTED THAT     
WE'RE ABLE TO USE.              
IT'S A LITTLE OUTDATED.         

01:11:32.351 --> 01:11:33.284
WE'RE ABLE TO USE.              
IT'S A LITTLE OUTDATED.         
WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING NEW   

01:11:33.286 --> 01:11:35.086
IT'S A LITTLE OUTDATED.         
WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING NEW

01:11:35.955 --> 01:11:39.957
DATA BUT FOR THE PURPOSES       
OF EXAMPLE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE    
USED SO FIRST WE'LL LIKE LOOK   

01:11:39.959 --> 01:11:40.624
OF EXAMPLE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE    
USED SO FIRST WE'LL LIKE LOOK   
AT THE EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR  

01:11:40.626 --> 01:11:43.861
USED SO FIRST WE'LL LIKE LOOK   
AT THE EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR  
THE CORRIDOR IN THIS CASE ON    

01:11:43.863 --> 01:11:46.531
AT THE EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR  
THE CORRIDOR IN THIS CASE ON    
PACARD STREET WE HAVE TO TRAVEL 

01:11:46.533 --> 01:11:47.331
THE CORRIDOR IN THIS CASE ON    
PACARD STREET WE HAVE TO TRAVEL 
LANES IN EACH DIRECTION WITH    

01:11:47.333 --> 01:11:48.132
PACARD STREET WE HAVE TO TRAVEL 
LANES IN EACH DIRECTION WITH    
THE LEFT TURN TO A CENTER LEFT  

01:11:48.134 --> 01:11:50.801
LANES IN EACH DIRECTION WITH    
THE LEFT TURN TO A CENTER LEFT  
TURN LANES.                     

01:11:50.803 --> 01:11:51.568
THE LEFT TURN TO A CENTER LEFT  
TURN LANES.                     
THERE ARE CONVENTIONAL BIKE     

01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:54.171
TURN LANES.                     
THERE ARE CONVENTIONAL BIKE     
LANES AND SOMEWHAT NARROW       

01:11:54.173 --> 01:11:54.505
THERE ARE CONVENTIONAL BIKE     
LANES AND SOMEWHAT NARROW       
SIDEWALKS.                      

01:11:54.507 --> 01:11:55.639
LANES AND SOMEWHAT NARROW       
SIDEWALKS.                      
THE SPEED LIMIT IS THIRTY FIVE  

01:11:55.641 --> 01:11:59.109
SIDEWALKS.                      
THE SPEED LIMIT IS THIRTY FIVE  
MILES AN HOUR AND I HAVE AN     

01:11:59.111 --> 01:11:59.877
THE SPEED LIMIT IS THIRTY FIVE  
MILES AN HOUR AND I HAVE AN     
IMAGE HERE THAT SHOWS THE       

01:11:59.879 --> 01:12:02.680
MILES AN HOUR AND I HAVE AN     
IMAGE HERE THAT SHOWS THE       
CROSS-SECTION AGAIN WHICH HAS   

01:12:02.682 --> 01:12:03.614
IMAGE HERE THAT SHOWS THE       
CROSS-SECTION AGAIN WHICH HAS   
TEN FOOT TRAVEL LANES, A TEN    

01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:06.917
CROSS-SECTION AGAIN WHICH HAS   
TEN FOOT TRAVEL LANES, A TEN    
FOOT LEFT TURN LANE, FIVE FEET  

01:12:06.919 --> 01:12:09.887
TEN FOOT TRAVEL LANES, A TEN    
FOOT LEFT TURN LANE, FIVE FEET  
BIKE LANES, FOUR FOOT           

01:12:09.889 --> 01:12:10.220
FOOT LEFT TURN LANE, FIVE FEET  
BIKE LANES, FOUR FOOT           
SIDEWALKS.                      

01:12:10.222 --> 01:12:10.888
BIKE LANES, FOUR FOOT           
SIDEWALKS.                      
SO IT'S REALLY A CROSS SECTION  

01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:13.791
SIDEWALKS.                      
SO IT'S REALLY A CROSS SECTION  
WHERE ALL THE FEATURES ARE AT   

01:12:13.793 --> 01:12:14.591
SO IT'S REALLY A CROSS SECTION  
WHERE ALL THE FEATURES ARE AT   
THEIR MINIMUM WIDTH BUT THAT'S  

01:12:14.593 --> 01:12:17.461
WHERE ALL THE FEATURES ARE AT   
THEIR MINIMUM WIDTH BUT THAT'S  
WHAT WE HAVE NOW.               

01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:18.529
THEIR MINIMUM WIDTH BUT THAT'S  
WHAT WE HAVE NOW.               
SO THEN THE NEXT STEP WE MIGHT  

01:12:18.531 --> 01:12:21.632
WHAT WE HAVE NOW.               
SO THEN THE NEXT STEP WE MIGHT  
TAKE IT THIS STREET AND I'M     

01:12:21.634 --> 01:12:22.366
SO THEN THE NEXT STEP WE MIGHT  
TAKE IT THIS STREET AND I'M     
SWITCHING TO THE NEXT RIGHT     

01:12:22.368 --> 01:12:23.100
TAKE IT THIS STREET AND I'M     
SWITCHING TO THE NEXT RIGHT     
HERE WE WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT 

01:12:23.102 --> 01:12:25.903
SWITCHING TO THE NEXT RIGHT     
HERE WE WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT 
WHAT WOULD BE A MORE OPTIMAL    

01:12:25.905 --> 01:12:26.703
HERE WE WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT 
WHAT WOULD BE A MORE OPTIMAL    
CROSS SECTION IF THE ROAD WAS   

01:12:26.705 --> 01:12:28.739
WHAT WOULD BE A MORE OPTIMAL    
CROSS SECTION IF THE ROAD WAS   
GOING TO BE RECONFIGURED.       

01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:29.640
CROSS SECTION IF THE ROAD WAS   
GOING TO BE RECONFIGURED.       
SO SOME OF THE THINGS WE'LL     

01:12:29.642 --> 01:12:32.809
GOING TO BE RECONFIGURED.       
SO SOME OF THE THINGS WE'LL     
THINK ABOUT WOULD BE IN THE     

01:12:32.811 --> 01:12:33.277
SO SOME OF THE THINGS WE'LL     
THINK ABOUT WOULD BE IN THE     
VISION ZERO PLAN.               

01:12:33.279 --> 01:12:36.713
THINK ABOUT WOULD BE IN THE     
VISION ZERO PLAN.               
THERE ARE DIFFERENT AND HIGH    

01:12:36.715 --> 01:12:37.414
VISION ZERO PLAN.               
THERE ARE DIFFERENT AND HIGH    
INJURY NETWORKS MAPPED UP IN    

01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:39.550
THERE ARE DIFFERENT AND HIGH    
INJURY NETWORKS MAPPED UP IN    
THIS PARTICULAR STREET AS A     

01:12:39.552 --> 01:12:40.418
INJURY NETWORKS MAPPED UP IN    
THIS PARTICULAR STREET AS A     
TIER TWO HIGH INJURY NETWORK.   

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.754
THIS PARTICULAR STREET AS A     
TIER TWO HIGH INJURY NETWORK.   
IT'S NOT THE HIGHEST ONE BUT    

01:12:43.756 --> 01:12:44.588
TIER TWO HIGH INJURY NETWORK.   
IT'S NOT THE HIGHEST ONE BUT    
IT'S A FAIRLY HIGH QUARTER WITH 

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:48.392
IT'S NOT THE HIGHEST ONE BUT    
IT'S A FAIRLY HIGH QUARTER WITH 
A LOT OF INJURIES.              

01:12:48.394 --> 01:12:49.459
IT'S A FAIRLY HIGH QUARTER WITH 
A LOT OF INJURIES.              
THIS QUARTER IS ALSO PROPOSED   

01:12:49.461 --> 01:12:52.362
A LOT OF INJURIES.              
THIS QUARTER IS ALSO PROPOSED   
AS AN ALL AGES AND ABILITIES    

01:12:52.364 --> 01:12:53.430
THIS QUARTER IS ALSO PROPOSED   
AS AN ALL AGES AND ABILITIES    
MAJOR BIKE ROUTE AND IT'S HAS   

01:12:53.432 --> 01:12:56.433
AS AN ALL AGES AND ABILITIES    
MAJOR BIKE ROUTE AND IT'S HAS   
PRIORITY TRANSIT SERVICE        

01:12:56.435 --> 01:12:57.435
MAJOR BIKE ROUTE AND IT'S HAS   
PRIORITY TRANSIT SERVICE        
CORRIDOR WHICH IS YOU KNOW, NOT 

01:12:57.437 --> 01:13:00.771
PRIORITY TRANSIT SERVICE        
CORRIDOR WHICH IS YOU KNOW, NOT

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:08.646
RIGHT OF WAY AROUND BUT SOME    
IMPROVEMENTS TO TRANSIT.        
SO WHAT I HAVE AN IMAGE HERE IS 

01:13:08.648 --> 01:13:09.247
IMPROVEMENTS TO TRANSIT.        
SO WHAT I HAVE AN IMAGE HERE IS 
A POSSIBLE FUTURE CROSS         

01:13:09.249 --> 01:13:09.646
SO WHAT I HAVE AN IMAGE HERE IS 
A POSSIBLE FUTURE CROSS         
SECTION.                        

01:13:09.648 --> 01:13:11.548
A POSSIBLE FUTURE CROSS         
SECTION.                        
OBVIOUSLY THE SYSTEM FOR        

01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:12.482
SECTION.                        
OBVIOUSLY THE SYSTEM FOR        
EXAMPLE PURPOSES ONLY YOU KNOW  

01:13:12.484 --> 01:13:16.353
OBVIOUSLY THE SYSTEM FOR        
EXAMPLE PURPOSES ONLY YOU KNOW  
WE MAKE MAY ALL TOGETHER THINK  

01:13:16.355 --> 01:13:17.054
EXAMPLE PURPOSES ONLY YOU KNOW  
WE MAKE MAY ALL TOGETHER THINK  
OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR THIS 

01:13:17.056 --> 01:13:17.855
WE MAKE MAY ALL TOGETHER THINK  
OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR THIS 
CORRIDOR WHEN WE GET INTO THE   

01:13:17.857 --> 01:13:20.257
OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR THIS 
CORRIDOR WHEN WE GET INTO THE   
STUDY BUT IN THIS CASE WE ARE   

01:13:20.259 --> 01:13:23.895
CORRIDOR WHEN WE GET INTO THE   
STUDY BUT IN THIS CASE WE ARE   
SHOWING TWO TRAVEL LANES CHANGE 

01:13:23.897 --> 01:13:24.695
STUDY BUT IN THIS CASE WE ARE   
SHOWING TWO TRAVEL LANES CHANGE 
DIRECTION AT ELEVEN FEET AT     

01:13:24.697 --> 01:13:27.130
SHOWING TWO TRAVEL LANES CHANGE 
DIRECTION AT ELEVEN FEET AT     
CENTER TURN LANE AT 11 FEET AND 

01:13:27.132 --> 01:13:28.065
DIRECTION AT ELEVEN FEET AT     
CENTER TURN LANE AT 11 FEET AND 
THEN FIVE AND A HALF FEET       

01:13:28.067 --> 01:13:32.202
CENTER TURN LANE AT 11 FEET AND 
THEN FIVE AND A HALF FEET       
BUFFERS TO SEPARATE BIKE LANES  

01:13:32.204 --> 01:13:32.937
THEN FIVE AND A HALF FEET       
BUFFERS TO SEPARATE BIKE LANES  
FROM TRAVEL LANES AND AN EIGHT  

01:13:32.939 --> 01:13:35.005
BUFFERS TO SEPARATE BIKE LANES  
FROM TRAVEL LANES AND AN EIGHT  
FOOT BIKE EACH DIRECTION.       

01:13:35.007 --> 01:13:38.809
FROM TRAVEL LANES AND AN EIGHT  
FOOT BIKE EACH DIRECTION.       
SO THIS IS AND FOR THE MOST     

01:13:38.811 --> 01:13:39.543
FOOT BIKE EACH DIRECTION.       
SO THIS IS AND FOR THE MOST     
PART WE LOOK TO ACCOMMODATE A   

01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:42.980
SO THIS IS AND FOR THE MOST     
PART WE LOOK TO ACCOMMODATE A   
FUTURE CROSS SECTION WITHIN THE 

01:13:42.982 --> 01:13:43.647
PART WE LOOK TO ACCOMMODATE A   
FUTURE CROSS SECTION WITHIN THE 
SAME CURVES FOR THIS FIRST      

01:13:43.649 --> 01:13:43.981
FUTURE CROSS SECTION WITHIN THE 
SAME CURVES FOR THIS FIRST      
LOOK.                           

01:13:43.983 --> 01:13:47.051
SAME CURVES FOR THIS FIRST      
LOOK.                           
I MEAN OVER TIME MAYBE FULL     

01:13:47.053 --> 01:13:47.718
LOOK.                           
I MEAN OVER TIME MAYBE FULL     
RECONSTRUCTION MIGHT HAPPEN     

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.518
I MEAN OVER TIME MAYBE FULL     
RECONSTRUCTION MIGHT HAPPEN     
WHICH YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT  

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.321
RECONSTRUCTION MIGHT HAPPEN     
WHICH YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT  
CURVE LOCATIONS BUT WITH THE    

01:13:51.323 --> 01:13:54.791
WHICH YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT  
CURVE LOCATIONS BUT WITH THE    
COST AND OPPORTUNITIES TO       

01:13:54.793 --> 01:13:55.492
CURVE LOCATIONS BUT WITH THE    
COST AND OPPORTUNITIES TO       
RECONFIGURE A ROAD BY KEEPING   

01:13:55.494 --> 01:13:58.829
COST AND OPPORTUNITIES TO       
RECONFIGURE A ROAD BY KEEPING   
THE CURVE LANES TOGETHER ARE SO 

01:13:58.831 --> 01:13:59.730
RECONFIGURE A ROAD BY KEEPING   
THE CURVE LANES TOGETHER ARE SO 
GREAT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO,    

01:13:59.732 --> 01:14:01.799
THE CURVE LANES TOGETHER ARE SO 
GREAT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO,    
YOU KNOW, LOOK AT WHAT CAN YOU  

01:14:01.801 --> 01:14:02.599
GREAT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO,    
YOU KNOW, LOOK AT WHAT CAN YOU  
FITTING IN WITHOUT CHANGING     

01:14:02.601 --> 01:14:02.867
YOU KNOW, LOOK AT WHAT CAN YOU  
FITTING IN WITHOUT CHANGING     
CURVES.                         

01:14:02.869 --> 01:14:05.669
FITTING IN WITHOUT CHANGING     
CURVES.                         
SO IN THIS CASE THE SIDEWALKS   

01:14:05.671 --> 01:14:06.570
CURVES.                         
SO IN THIS CASE THE SIDEWALKS   
ARE NOT PROPOSING IN THIS       

01:14:06.572 --> 01:14:08.705
SO IN THIS CASE THE SIDEWALKS   
ARE NOT PROPOSING IN THIS       
EXAMPLE CHANGES TO THAT.        

01:14:08.707 --> 01:14:13.810
ARE NOT PROPOSING IN THIS       
EXAMPLE CHANGES TO THAT.        
SO SO NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW A   

01:14:13.812 --> 01:14:16.714
EXAMPLE CHANGES TO THAT.        
SO SO NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW A   
KIND OF A BUSY SLIDE.           

01:14:16.716 --> 01:14:20.585
SO SO NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW A   
KIND OF A BUSY SLIDE.           
SO THIS IS SHOWING A CHART      

01:14:20.587 --> 01:14:21.485
KIND OF A BUSY SLIDE.           
SO THIS IS SHOWING A CHART      
OF AGAIN I TALKED ABOUT HOW     

01:14:21.487 --> 01:14:22.285
SO THIS IS SHOWING A CHART      
OF AGAIN I TALKED ABOUT HOW     
WE'RE GOING TO BE COLLECTING    

01:14:22.287 --> 01:14:22.820
OF AGAIN I TALKED ABOUT HOW     
WE'RE GOING TO BE COLLECTING    
DATA FROM EACH STREET.          

01:14:22.822 --> 01:14:25.155
WE'RE GOING TO BE COLLECTING    
DATA FROM EACH STREET.          
THIS IS USING OLD DATA.         

01:14:25.157 --> 01:14:26.090
DATA FROM EACH STREET.          
THIS IS USING OLD DATA.         
IT'S KIND OF OUTDATED BUT IT'S  

01:14:26.092 --> 01:14:26.691
THIS IS USING OLD DATA.         
IT'S KIND OF OUTDATED BUT IT'S  
JUST AGAIN FOR PURPOSES         

01:14:26.693 --> 01:14:29.360
IT'S KIND OF OUTDATED BUT IT'S  
JUST AGAIN FOR PURPOSES         
OF EXAMPLE, THESE ARE HOURLY    

01:14:29.362 --> 01:14:29.960
JUST AGAIN FOR PURPOSES         
OF EXAMPLE, THESE ARE HOURLY    
TRAFFIC VOLUMES.                

01:14:29.962 --> 01:14:33.497
OF EXAMPLE, THESE ARE HOURLY    
TRAFFIC VOLUMES.                
WE HAVE GOING FROM TWENTY FOUR  

01:14:33.499 --> 01:14:36.133
TRAFFIC VOLUMES.                
WE HAVE GOING FROM TWENTY FOUR  
HOURS OF THE DAY SHOWN FOR THE  

01:14:36.135 --> 01:14:36.867
WE HAVE GOING FROM TWENTY FOUR  
HOURS OF THE DAY SHOWN FOR THE  
WESTBOUND TRAFFIC AND DARK BLUE 

01:14:36.869 --> 01:14:40.837
HOURS OF THE DAY SHOWN FOR THE  
WESTBOUND TRAFFIC AND DARK BLUE 
LINES AND THE EASTBOUND HOURLY  

01:14:40.839 --> 01:14:43.874
WESTBOUND TRAFFIC AND DARK BLUE 
LINES AND THE EASTBOUND HOURLY  
TRAFFIC IN LIGHTER BLUE THE     

01:14:43.876 --> 01:14:44.642
LINES AND THE EASTBOUND HOURLY  
TRAFFIC IN LIGHTER BLUE THE     
TRAFFIC OBVIOUSLY IS VERY LOW   

01:14:44.644 --> 01:14:45.575
TRAFFIC IN LIGHTER BLUE THE     
TRAFFIC OBVIOUSLY IS VERY LOW   
AT NIGHTTIME BUT IT RISES IN    

01:14:45.577 --> 01:14:48.579
TRAFFIC OBVIOUSLY IS VERY LOW   
AT NIGHTTIME BUT IT RISES IN    
BOTH THE MORNING AND AFTERNOON  

01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:49.179
AT NIGHTTIME BUT IT RISES IN    
BOTH THE MORNING AND AFTERNOON  
PEAK IN THE MORNING.            

01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:51.715
BOTH THE MORNING AND AFTERNOON  
PEAK IN THE MORNING.            
IT'S HEAVIER IN THE WESTBOUND   

01:14:51.717 --> 01:14:52.550
PEAK IN THE MORNING.            
IT'S HEAVIER IN THE WESTBOUND   
DIRECTION IN THE AFTERNOON,     

01:14:52.552 --> 01:14:53.150
IT'S HEAVIER IN THE WESTBOUND   
DIRECTION IN THE AFTERNOON,     
HEAVIER IN THE EASTBOUND        

01:14:53.152 --> 01:14:53.484
DIRECTION IN THE AFTERNOON,     
HEAVIER IN THE EASTBOUND        
DIRECTION.                      

01:14:53.486 --> 01:14:56.687
HEAVIER IN THE EASTBOUND        
DIRECTION.                      
THE HOURLY VOLUMES ARE IN THE   

01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:59.156
DIRECTION.                      
THE HOURLY VOLUMES ARE IN THE   
ORDER OF AROUND ELEVEN HUNDRED  

01:14:59.158 --> 01:15:02.860
THE HOURLY VOLUMES ARE IN THE   
ORDER OF AROUND ELEVEN HUNDRED  
TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED CARS PER    

01:15:02.862 --> 01:15:03.727

HOUR DURING THOSE PEAK HOURS    

01:15:03.729 --> 01:15:04.528
TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED CARS PER    
HOUR DURING THOSE PEAK HOURS    
AND THAT'S PROBABLY A TYPICAL   

01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:07.531
HOUR DURING THOSE PEAK HOURS    
AND THAT'S PROBABLY A TYPICAL   
PATTERN AND A LOT OF THE        

01:15:07.533 --> 01:15:11.435
AND THAT'S PROBABLY A TYPICAL   
PATTERN AND A LOT OF THE        
CORRIDORS THEN ALSO ON THIS     

01:15:11.437 --> 01:15:12.236
PATTERN AND A LOT OF THE        
CORRIDORS THEN ALSO ON THIS     
CHART ARE A COUPLE OF SOLID     

01:15:12.238 --> 01:15:14.471
CORRIDORS THEN ALSO ON THIS     
CHART ARE A COUPLE OF SOLID     
LINES AND WHAT THESE LINES ARE  

01:15:14.473 --> 01:15:17.775
CHART ARE A COUPLE OF SOLID     
LINES AND WHAT THESE LINES ARE  
SHOWING IS SORT OF A ROUGH      

01:15:17.777 --> 01:15:18.642
LINES AND WHAT THESE LINES ARE  
SHOWING IS SORT OF A ROUGH      
ESTIMATE OF CAPACITY FOR HOURLY 

01:15:18.644 --> 01:15:22.079
SHOWING IS SORT OF A ROUGH      
ESTIMATE OF CAPACITY FOR HOURLY 
TRAFFIC.                        

01:15:22.081 --> 01:15:23.147
ESTIMATE OF CAPACITY FOR HOURLY 
TRAFFIC.                        
SO A GOOD APPLES TO APPLES      

01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.948
TRAFFIC.                        
SO A GOOD APPLES TO APPLES      
COMPARISON OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING 

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:26.450
SO A GOOD APPLES TO APPLES      
COMPARISON OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING 
IN THE DATA FOR BOTH EXISTING   

01:15:26.452 --> 01:15:27.250
COMPARISON OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING 
IN THE DATA FOR BOTH EXISTING   
CONDITIONS WHERE WE HAVE FOR    

01:15:27.252 --> 01:15:30.821
IN THE DATA FOR BOTH EXISTING   
CONDITIONS WHERE WE HAVE FOR    
TRAVEL LANES JUST THE TOP LINE  

01:15:30.823 --> 01:15:31.455
CONDITIONS WHERE WE HAVE FOR    
TRAVEL LANES JUST THE TOP LINE  
IT'S A LITTLE OVER FOURTEEN     

01:15:31.457 --> 01:15:34.524
TRAVEL LANES JUST THE TOP LINE  
IT'S A LITTLE OVER FOURTEEN     
HUNDRED VEHICLES PER HOUR AND   

01:15:34.526 --> 01:15:35.192
IT'S A LITTLE OVER FOURTEEN     
HUNDRED VEHICLES PER HOUR AND   
THEN WHAT WOULD THE HOURLY      

01:15:35.194 --> 01:15:37.728
HUNDRED VEHICLES PER HOUR AND   
THEN WHAT WOULD THE HOURLY      
CAPACITY BE FOR A THREE LANE    

01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:38.462
THEN WHAT WOULD THE HOURLY      
CAPACITY BE FOR A THREE LANE    
ROADWAY MEANING ONE TRAVELING   

01:15:38.464 --> 01:15:42.233
CAPACITY BE FOR A THREE LANE    
ROADWAY MEANING ONE TRAVELING   
IN EACH DIRECTION LEFT HER      

01:15:42.235 --> 01:15:43.033
ROADWAY MEANING ONE TRAVELING   
IN EACH DIRECTION LEFT HER      
LANES AND THAT'S ABOUT ELEVEN   

01:15:43.035 --> 01:15:46.169
IN EACH DIRECTION LEFT HER      
LANES AND THAT'S ABOUT ELEVEN   
HUNDRED VEHICLES PER HOUR.      

01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:47.137
LANES AND THAT'S ABOUT ELEVEN   
HUNDRED VEHICLES PER HOUR.      
THESE NUMBERS ARE JUST TAKEN    

01:15:47.139 --> 01:15:49.372
HUNDRED VEHICLES PER HOUR.      
THESE NUMBERS ARE JUST TAKEN    
FROM AVERAGES PUBLISHED I THINK 

01:15:49.374 --> 01:15:52.909
THESE NUMBERS ARE JUST TAKEN    
FROM AVERAGES PUBLISHED I THINK 
IN THE END THEY CERP REPORT     

01:15:52.911 --> 01:15:53.678
FROM AVERAGES PUBLISHED I THINK 
IN THE END THEY CERP REPORT     
THEY'RE NOT SUPER REFINED BUT   

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.314
IN THE END THEY CERP REPORT     
THEY'RE NOT SUPER REFINED BUT   
WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS   

01:15:57.316 --> 01:15:58.082
THEY'RE NOT SUPER REFINED BUT   
WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS   
WHAT WE SEE IS FROM THE         

01:15:58.084 --> 01:16:01.118
WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS   
WHAT WE SEE IS FROM THE         
EXISTING CONDITIONS THE ROADWAY 

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.053
WHAT WE SEE IS FROM THE         
EXISTING CONDITIONS THE ROADWAY 
IS UNDER CAPACITY ALL HOURS     

01:16:02.055 --> 01:16:05.055
EXISTING CONDITIONS THE ROADWAY 
IS UNDER CAPACITY ALL HOURS     
OF THE DAY FOR 24 HOURS IT'S    

01:16:05.057 --> 01:16:05.856
IS UNDER CAPACITY ALL HOURS     
OF THE DAY FOR 24 HOURS IT'S    
ALL UNDER CAPACITY AND THAT'S   

01:16:05.858 --> 01:16:08.859
OF THE DAY FOR 24 HOURS IT'S    
ALL UNDER CAPACITY AND THAT'S   
THIS CHART AT THE BOTTOM        

01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:09.593
ALL UNDER CAPACITY AND THAT'S   
THIS CHART AT THE BOTTOM        
SHOWING THAT THE THREE LANE     

01:16:09.595 --> 01:16:12.496
THIS CHART AT THE BOTTOM        
SHOWING THAT THE THREE LANE     
SCENARIO WOULD REDUCE CAPACITY  

01:16:12.498 --> 01:16:16.167
SHOWING THAT THE THREE LANE     
SCENARIO WOULD REDUCE CAPACITY  
SUCH THAT THERE'D BE FIVE HOURS 

01:16:16.169 --> 01:16:16.967
SCENARIO WOULD REDUCE CAPACITY  
SUCH THAT THERE'D BE FIVE HOURS 
OF THE DAY WHERE TRAFFIC        

01:16:16.969 --> 01:16:20.203
SUCH THAT THERE'D BE FIVE HOURS 
OF THE DAY WHERE TRAFFIC        
VOLUMES WOULD EXCEED CAPACITY   

01:16:20.205 --> 01:16:26.010
OF THE DAY WHERE TRAFFIC        
VOLUMES WOULD EXCEED CAPACITY   
UNDER THIS SCENARIO UNDER THE   

01:16:26.012 --> 01:16:26.811
VOLUMES WOULD EXCEED CAPACITY   
UNDER THIS SCENARIO UNDER THE   
ESTIMATES OF CAPACITY THAT WE   

01:16:26.813 --> 01:16:29.446
UNDER THIS SCENARIO UNDER THE   
ESTIMATES OF CAPACITY THAT WE   
HAVE THAT OUR VERY KIND         

01:16:29.448 --> 01:16:30.013
ESTIMATES OF CAPACITY THAT WE   
HAVE THAT OUR VERY KIND         
OF GENERIC AND SOMEWHAT         

01:16:30.015 --> 01:16:30.480
HAVE THAT OUR VERY KIND         
OF GENERIC AND SOMEWHAT         
CONSERVATIVE.                   

01:16:30.482 --> 01:16:33.784
OF GENERIC AND SOMEWHAT         
CONSERVATIVE.                   
SO GIVEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT   

01:16:33.786 --> 01:16:34.385
CONSERVATIVE.                   
SO GIVEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT   
WELL MAYBE WE'D WANT TO         

01:16:34.387 --> 01:16:38.255
SO GIVEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT   
WELL MAYBE WE'D WANT TO         
TOLERATE A FOUR HOURS           

01:16:38.257 --> 01:16:39.056
WELL MAYBE WE'D WANT TO         
TOLERATE A FOUR HOURS           
OF CONGESTION PER DAY, WE'RE    

01:16:39.058 --> 01:16:41.225
TOLERATE A FOUR HOURS           
OF CONGESTION PER DAY, WE'RE    
ACTUALLY JUST ABOVE THAT        

01:16:41.227 --> 01:16:41.625
OF CONGESTION PER DAY, WE'RE    
ACTUALLY JUST ABOVE THAT        
THRESHOLD.                      

01:16:41.627 --> 01:16:42.560
ACTUALLY JUST ABOVE THAT        
THRESHOLD.                      
SO WHAT THIS WOULD TRIGGER IS   

01:16:42.562 --> 01:16:45.763
THRESHOLD.                      
SO WHAT THIS WOULD TRIGGER IS   
JUST TO TAKING A LITTLE MORE    

01:16:45.765 --> 01:16:46.697
SO WHAT THIS WOULD TRIGGER IS   
JUST TO TAKING A LITTLE MORE    
REFINED LOOK AT WHAT IS THE     

01:16:46.699 --> 01:16:49.834
JUST TO TAKING A LITTLE MORE    
REFINED LOOK AT WHAT IS THE     
ACTUAL CAPACITY ON THE STREET   

01:16:49.836 --> 01:16:52.669
REFINED LOOK AT WHAT IS THE     
ACTUAL CAPACITY ON THE STREET   
AT THESE INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE  

01:16:52.671 --> 01:16:53.570
ACTUAL CAPACITY ON THE STREET   
AT THESE INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE  
THESE ARE THE SOLID LINES THAT  

01:16:53.572 --> 01:16:56.741
AT THESE INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE  
THESE ARE THE SOLID LINES THAT  
SHOW CAPACITY ASSUME A ROUGH    

01:16:56.743 --> 01:17:00.677
THESE ARE THE SOLID LINES THAT  
SHOW CAPACITY ASSUME A ROUGH    
ESTIMATE OF FORTY PERCENT BRENE 

01:17:00.679 --> 01:17:04.915
SHOW CAPACITY ASSUME A ROUGH    
ESTIMATE OF FORTY PERCENT BRENE 
TIME FOR EACH FOR EIGHT FOR THE 

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:05.582
ESTIMATE OF FORTY PERCENT BRENE 
TIME FOR EACH FOR EIGHT FOR THE 
MAIN THOROUGHFARE WHICH IS      

01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:11.589
TIME FOR EACH FOR EIGHT FOR THE 
MAIN THOROUGHFARE WHICH IS      
QUITE CONSERVATIVE              

01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:27.605
                   OFTEN ON A   
MAJOR STREET YOU HAVE QUITE A   
BIT MORE OF THE TIME OF EACH    

01:17:27.607 --> 01:17:28.338
MAJOR STREET YOU HAVE QUITE A   
BIT MORE OF THE TIME OF EACH    
SIGNAL CYCLE WHICH IS REALLY    

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:29.139
BIT MORE OF THE TIME OF EACH    
SIGNAL CYCLE WHICH IS REALLY    
WHAT GOVERNS CAPACITY MIGHT BE  

01:17:29.141 --> 01:17:29.740
SIGNAL CYCLE WHICH IS REALLY    
WHAT GOVERNS CAPACITY MIGHT BE  
MORE LIKE 50 OR 60 PERCENT      

01:17:29.742 --> 01:17:30.141
WHAT GOVERNS CAPACITY MIGHT BE  
MORE LIKE 50 OR 60 PERCENT      
GREEN TIME.                     

01:17:30.143 --> 01:17:30.908
MORE LIKE 50 OR 60 PERCENT      
GREEN TIME.                     
SO AGAIN THIS IS A CONSERVATIVE 

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:31.575
GREEN TIME.                     
SO AGAIN THIS IS A CONSERVATIVE 
ASSUMPTION ON CAPACITY.         

01:17:31.577 --> 01:17:32.309
SO AGAIN THIS IS A CONSERVATIVE 
ASSUMPTION ON CAPACITY.         
SO WHAT WE DO I'M JUST SHOWING  

01:17:32.311 --> 01:17:33.110
ASSUMPTION ON CAPACITY.         
SO WHAT WE DO I'M JUST SHOWING  
THE NEXT SIDE WHERE WE THINK    

01:17:33.112 --> 01:17:33.711
SO WHAT WE DO I'M JUST SHOWING  
THE NEXT SIDE WHERE WE THINK    
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT      

01:17:33.713 --> 01:17:34.378
THE NEXT SIDE WHERE WE THINK    
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT      
CORRIDOR AND HOW THE SIGNALS    

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:34.911
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT      
CORRIDOR AND HOW THE SIGNALS    
ARE OPERATING.                  

01:17:34.913 --> 01:17:35.646
CORRIDOR AND HOW THE SIGNALS    
ARE OPERATING.                  
WE OFTEN WOULD FIND AND AGAIN   

01:17:35.648 --> 01:17:36.313
ARE OPERATING.                  
WE OFTEN WOULD FIND AND AGAIN   
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE BUT DURING   

01:17:36.315 --> 01:17:37.047
WE OFTEN WOULD FIND AND AGAIN   
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE BUT DURING   
THE PEAK HOURS THAT THE WAY THE 

01:17:37.049 --> 01:17:39.183
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE BUT DURING   
THE PEAK HOURS THAT THE WAY THE 
SIGNALS OPERATE PROVIDES QUITE  

01:17:39.185 --> 01:17:40.283
THE PEAK HOURS THAT THE WAY THE 
SIGNALS OPERATE PROVIDES QUITE  
A BIT MORE GREEN TIME TO THAT   

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:43.954
SIGNALS OPERATE PROVIDES QUITE  
A BIT MORE GREEN TIME TO THAT   
MAJOR THOROUGHFARES, THAT       

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:46.957
A BIT MORE GREEN TIME TO THAT   
MAJOR THOROUGHFARES, THAT       
ACTUALLY MEANS THAT IN THIS     

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:47.824
MAJOR THOROUGHFARES, THAT       
ACTUALLY MEANS THAT IN THIS     
CASE WE'D HAVE ONLY ONE HOUR    

01:17:47.826 --> 01:17:50.594
ACTUALLY MEANS THAT IN THIS     
CASE WE'D HAVE ONLY ONE HOUR    
OF THE DAY WOULD BE             

01:17:50.596 --> 01:17:51.128
CASE WE'D HAVE ONLY ONE HOUR    
OF THE DAY WOULD BE             
OVERCAPACITY OPERATIONS.        

01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:54.999
OF THE DAY WOULD BE             
OVERCAPACITY OPERATIONS.        
SO SO OUR FIRST IS JUST LOOKING 

01:17:55.001 --> 01:17:55.799
OVERCAPACITY OPERATIONS.        
SO SO OUR FIRST IS JUST LOOKING 
AT SORT OF GENERIC ASSUMPTIONS  

01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:59.135
SO SO OUR FIRST IS JUST LOOKING 
AT SORT OF GENERIC ASSUMPTIONS  
IF WE DON'T MEET THE THRESHOLDS 

01:17:59.137 --> 01:18:01.906
AT SORT OF GENERIC ASSUMPTIONS  
IF WE DON'T MEET THE THRESHOLDS 
OF FOUR HOURS OF CONGESTION PER 

01:18:01.908 --> 01:18:02.973
IF WE DON'T MEET THE THRESHOLDS 
OF FOUR HOURS OF CONGESTION PER 
DAY, WE'D TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT 

01:18:02.975 --> 01:18:06.076
OF FOUR HOURS OF CONGESTION PER 
DAY, WE'D TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT 
THE SIGNAL OPERATIONS AND IN    

01:18:06.078 --> 01:18:06.710
DAY, WE'D TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT 
THE SIGNAL OPERATIONS AND IN    
THIS EXAMPLE WE GOT DOWN TO     

01:18:06.712 --> 01:18:09.647
THE SIGNAL OPERATIONS AND IN    
THIS EXAMPLE WE GOT DOWN TO     
WOULD THERE BE ONLY ONE HOUR    

01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:10.614
THIS EXAMPLE WE GOT DOWN TO     
WOULD THERE BE ONLY ONE HOUR    
OF PER DAY WHERE THE TRAFFIC    

01:18:10.616 --> 01:18:13.884
WOULD THERE BE ONLY ONE HOUR    
OF PER DAY WHERE THE TRAFFIC    
WOULD EXCEED CONGESTION?        

01:18:13.886 --> 01:18:18.154
OF PER DAY WHERE THE TRAFFIC    
WOULD EXCEED CONGESTION?        
SO UNDER THIS METHOD THAT WOULD 

01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:21.458
WOULD EXCEED CONGESTION?        
SO UNDER THIS METHOD THAT WOULD 
BE FELT TO BE A GOOD            

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:22.259
SO UNDER THIS METHOD THAT WOULD 
BE FELT TO BE A GOOD            
RECOMMENDATION AND TO PROCEED   

01:18:22.261 --> 01:18:25.762
BE FELT TO BE A GOOD            
RECOMMENDATION AND TO PROCEED   
WITH ROAD RECONFIGURATION.      

01:18:25.764 --> 01:18:29.866
RECOMMENDATION AND TO PROCEED   
WITH ROAD RECONFIGURATION.      
SO HOWEVER, THERE MIGHT BE      

01:18:29.868 --> 01:18:30.567
WITH ROAD RECONFIGURATION.      
SO HOWEVER, THERE MIGHT BE      
CORRIDORS THAT WE HAVE THAT     

01:18:30.569 --> 01:18:32.936
SO HOWEVER, THERE MIGHT BE      
CORRIDORS THAT WE HAVE THAT     
WOULD WE'D STILL LOOKING AT THE 

01:18:32.938 --> 01:18:33.603
CORRIDORS THAT WE HAVE THAT     
WOULD WE'D STILL LOOKING AT THE 
MORE REFINED ANALYSIS WE'D      

01:18:33.605 --> 01:18:34.404
WOULD WE'D STILL LOOKING AT THE 
MORE REFINED ANALYSIS WE'D      
STILL FIND THAT MAYBE MORE MORE 

01:18:34.406 --> 01:18:37.408
MORE REFINED ANALYSIS WE'D      
STILL FIND THAT MAYBE MORE MORE 
THAN FOUR HOURS PER DAY WOULD   

01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:38.141
STILL FIND THAT MAYBE MORE MORE 
THAN FOUR HOURS PER DAY WOULD   
BE CONGESTED AND THAT'S WHAT    

01:18:38.143 --> 01:18:41.211
THAN FOUR HOURS PER DAY WOULD   
BE CONGESTED AND THAT'S WHAT    
WE'RE CALLING A MITIGATION      

01:18:41.213 --> 01:18:41.412
BE CONGESTED AND THAT'S WHAT    
WE'RE CALLING A MITIGATION      
STEP.                           

01:18:41.414 --> 01:18:42.345
WE'RE CALLING A MITIGATION      
STEP.                           
WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT     

01:18:42.347 --> 01:18:44.748
STEP.                           
WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT     
THOSE CORRIDORS.                

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:45.815
WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT     
THOSE CORRIDORS.                
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY   

01:18:45.817 --> 01:18:46.616
THOSE CORRIDORS.                
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY   
THERE WILL BE AT THIS POINT     

01:18:46.618 --> 01:18:47.250
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY   
THERE WILL BE AT THIS POINT     
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST STARTING     

01:18:47.252 --> 01:18:48.853
THERE WILL BE AT THIS POINT     
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST STARTING     
FROM SCRATCH.                   

01:18:48.855 --> 01:18:50.086
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST STARTING     
FROM SCRATCH.                   
BUT WE'D TAKE A CLOSER LOOK TO  

01:18:50.088 --> 01:18:52.056
FROM SCRATCH.                   
BUT WE'D TAKE A CLOSER LOOK TO  
SEE WHAT ARE THE TRADE AND      

01:18:52.058 --> 01:18:52.590
BUT WE'D TAKE A CLOSER LOOK TO  
SEE WHAT ARE THE TRADE AND      
BENEFITS OF ROADWAY             

01:18:52.592 --> 01:18:53.323
SEE WHAT ARE THE TRADE AND      
BENEFITS OF ROADWAY             
RECONFIGURATION AND WHAT ARE    

01:18:53.325 --> 01:18:56.459
BENEFITS OF ROADWAY             
RECONFIGURATION AND WHAT ARE    
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MITIGATE   

01:18:56.461 --> 01:18:56.726
RECONFIGURATION AND WHAT ARE    
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MITIGATE   
IT.                             

01:18:56.728 --> 01:19:00.363
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MITIGATE   
IT.                             
SO THE STEPS IN THIS PROJECT    

01:19:00.365 --> 01:19:03.733
IT.                             
SO THE STEPS IN THIS PROJECT    
WOULD BE AGAIN TO DOCUMENT THE  

01:19:03.735 --> 01:19:04.501
SO THE STEPS IN THIS PROJECT    
WOULD BE AGAIN TO DOCUMENT THE  
GOALS FOR EACH CORRIDOR STEP    

01:19:04.503 --> 01:19:08.238
WOULD BE AGAIN TO DOCUMENT THE  
GOALS FOR EACH CORRIDOR STEP    
NUMBER ONE DOCUMENT AND ARBOR   

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:08.973
GOALS FOR EACH CORRIDOR STEP    
NUMBER ONE DOCUMENT AND ARBOR   
MOVING TOGETHER QUARTER GOALS   

01:19:08.975 --> 01:19:12.309
NUMBER ONE DOCUMENT AND ARBOR   
MOVING TOGETHER QUARTER GOALS   
RELATED TO RECONFIGURATION AND  

01:19:12.311 --> 01:19:13.243
MOVING TOGETHER QUARTER GOALS   
RELATED TO RECONFIGURATION AND  
REALLY TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AND    

01:19:13.245 --> 01:19:16.347
RELATED TO RECONFIGURATION AND  
REALLY TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AND    
CONSIDER SHOULD WE MOVE FORWARD 

01:19:16.349 --> 01:19:16.947
REALLY TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AND    
CONSIDER SHOULD WE MOVE FORWARD 
WITH RECONFIGURATION?           

01:19:16.949 --> 01:19:20.217
CONSIDER SHOULD WE MOVE FORWARD 
WITH RECONFIGURATION?           
NO, SURE.                       

01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:21.185
WITH RECONFIGURATION?           
NO, SURE.                       
WHICH WILL TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT 

01:19:21.187 --> 01:19:21.985
NO, SURE.                       
WHICH WILL TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT 
THE TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND ROUTE  

01:19:21.987 --> 01:19:24.020
WHICH WILL TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT 
THE TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND ROUTE  
CHARACTERISTICS THAT MIGHT      

01:19:24.022 --> 01:19:24.788
THE TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND ROUTE  
CHARACTERISTICS THAT MIGHT      
SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE 

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:27.324
CHARACTERISTICS THAT MIGHT      
SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE 
PEAK HOUR VEHICLE TRAFFIC.      

01:19:27.326 --> 01:19:28.258
SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE 
PEAK HOUR VEHICLE TRAFFIC.      
THAT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE THE   

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:31.328
PEAK HOUR VEHICLE TRAFFIC.      
THAT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE THE   
MODE SPLIT THE TRIP LENGTH, THE 

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:31.962
THAT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE THE   
MODE SPLIT THE TRIP LENGTH, THE 
PURPOSE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR   

01:19:31.964 --> 01:19:35.198
MODE SPLIT THE TRIP LENGTH, THE 
PURPOSE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR   
BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN AND TRANSIT 

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.132
PURPOSE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR   
BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN AND TRANSIT 
USE AND POTENTIALLY LAND USE    

01:19:36.134 --> 01:19:39.169
BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN AND TRANSIT 
USE AND POTENTIALLY LAND USE    
CHANGES.                        

01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:40.070
USE AND POTENTIALLY LAND USE    
CHANGES.                        
A THIRD STEP IN HERE WOULD BE   

01:19:40.072 --> 01:19:42.907
CHANGES.                        
A THIRD STEP IN HERE WOULD BE   
TO CALCULATE THE PERSON         

01:19:42.909 --> 01:19:43.606
A THIRD STEP IN HERE WOULD BE   
TO CALCULATE THE PERSON         
THROUGHPUT FOR BOTH THE         

01:19:43.608 --> 01:19:44.141
TO CALCULATE THE PERSON         
THROUGHPUT FOR BOTH THE         
EXISTING AND POTENTIAL          

01:19:44.143 --> 01:19:47.444
THROUGHPUT FOR BOTH THE         
EXISTING AND POTENTIAL          
RECONFIGURE CROSS SECTIONS TO   

01:19:47.446 --> 01:19:48.112
EXISTING AND POTENTIAL          
RECONFIGURE CROSS SECTIONS TO   
THINK ABOUT OUR WEIGHT          

01:19:48.114 --> 01:19:51.215
RECONFIGURE CROSS SECTIONS TO   
THINK ABOUT OUR WEIGHT          
PROVIDING CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE   

01:19:51.217 --> 01:19:52.148
THINK ABOUT OUR WEIGHT          
PROVIDING CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE   
MAYBE NOT AS MUCH FOR VEHICLES  

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:55.251
PROVIDING CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE   
MAYBE NOT AS MUCH FOR VEHICLES  
BUT WILL WE PROVIDE THE SORT    

01:19:55.253 --> 01:19:55.886
MAYBE NOT AS MUCH FOR VEHICLES  
BUT WILL WE PROVIDE THE SORT    
OF MOBILITY NEEDED AND WHAT     

01:19:55.888 --> 01:19:58.155
BUT WILL WE PROVIDE THE SORT    
OF MOBILITY NEEDED AND WHAT     
WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?           

01:19:58.157 --> 01:19:59.223
OF MOBILITY NEEDED AND WHAT     
WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?           
NUMBER FOUR WILL LOOK A LOT     

01:19:59.225 --> 01:20:02.092
WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?           
NUMBER FOUR WILL LOOK A LOT     
OF SAFETY WILL IDENTIFY         

01:20:02.094 --> 01:20:03.026
NUMBER FOUR WILL LOOK A LOT     
OF SAFETY WILL IDENTIFY         
SPEEDING AND CRASH PATTERNS AND 

01:20:03.028 --> 01:20:06.296
OF SAFETY WILL IDENTIFY         
SPEEDING AND CRASH PATTERNS AND 
CONFLICTION IMPACTS TO          

01:20:06.298 --> 01:20:07.031
SPEEDING AND CRASH PATTERNS AND 
CONFLICTION IMPACTS TO          
EMERGENCY ROUTES POTENTIALLY    

01:20:07.033 --> 01:20:10.334
CONFLICTION IMPACTS TO          
EMERGENCY ROUTES POTENTIALLY    
AFFECTED BY RECONFIGURATION.    

01:20:10.336 --> 01:20:11.334
EMERGENCY ROUTES POTENTIALLY    
AFFECTED BY RECONFIGURATION.    
SO IN CONSIDERING ALL THE USUAL 

01:20:11.336 --> 01:20:14.338
AFFECTED BY RECONFIGURATION.    
SO IN CONSIDERING ALL THE USUAL 
RECONFIGURATION LEAD TO GREATER 

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:14.939
SO IN CONSIDERING ALL THE USUAL 
RECONFIGURATION LEAD TO GREATER 
SAFETY AND THAT'S ANOTHER       

01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:18.241
RECONFIGURATION LEAD TO GREATER 
SAFETY AND THAT'S ANOTHER       
FACTOR TO CONSIDER.             

01:20:18.243 --> 01:20:19.209
SAFETY AND THAT'S ANOTHER       
FACTOR TO CONSIDER.             
AND THEN FINALLY THE SO AFTER   

01:20:19.211 --> 01:20:22.312
FACTOR TO CONSIDER.             
AND THEN FINALLY THE SO AFTER   
LOOKING AT ALL THESE THINGS,    

01:20:22.314 --> 01:20:23.246
AND THEN FINALLY THE SO AFTER   
LOOKING AT ALL THESE THINGS,    
WE'LL WORK WITH THE WHOLE CITY  

01:20:23.248 --> 01:20:26.717
LOOKING AT ALL THESE THINGS,    
WE'LL WORK WITH THE WHOLE CITY  
TEAM TO ASSESS THE RISKS AND    

01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:27.518
WE'LL WORK WITH THE WHOLE CITY  
TEAM TO ASSESS THE RISKS AND    
BENEFITS OF RECONFIGURATION AND 

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.287
TEAM TO ASSESS THE RISKS AND    
BENEFITS OF RECONFIGURATION AND 
DEVELOP A RECOMMENDED DESIGN.   

01:20:30.289 --> 01:20:31.588
BENEFITS OF RECONFIGURATION AND 
DEVELOP A RECOMMENDED DESIGN.   
YOU KNOW, WE MAY NOT FIND THAT  

01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:32.289
DEVELOP A RECOMMENDED DESIGN.   
YOU KNOW, WE MAY NOT FIND THAT  
EVERY CORRIDOR IS A GOOD        

01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:34.558
YOU KNOW, WE MAY NOT FIND THAT  
EVERY CORRIDOR IS A GOOD        
CANDIDATE FOR RECONFIGURATION   

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.359
EVERY CORRIDOR IS A GOOD        
CANDIDATE FOR RECONFIGURATION   
BUT WE REALLY WANT TO TAKE A    

01:20:35.361 --> 01:20:38.595
CANDIDATE FOR RECONFIGURATION   
BUT WE REALLY WANT TO TAKE A    
CLOSE LOOK AND MAKE SURE WE'RE  

01:20:38.597 --> 01:20:42.066
BUT WE REALLY WANT TO TAKE A    
CLOSE LOOK AND MAKE SURE WE'RE  
CONSIDERING ALL THE BENEFITS.   

01:20:42.068 --> 01:20:43.200
CLOSE LOOK AND MAKE SURE WE'RE  
CONSIDERING ALL THE BENEFITS.   
>> I'VE GOT A QUICK QUESTION.   

01:20:43.202 --> 01:20:45.435
CONSIDERING ALL THE BENEFITS.   
>> I'VE GOT A QUICK QUESTION.   
SURE.                           

01:20:45.437 --> 01:20:46.203
>> I'VE GOT A QUICK QUESTION.   
SURE.                           
ABOUT THE DATA COLLECTION.      

01:20:46.205 --> 01:20:47.070
SURE.                           
ABOUT THE DATA COLLECTION.      
SO YOU MENTIONED THAT IT'S      

01:20:47.072 --> 01:20:50.007
ABOUT THE DATA COLLECTION.      
SO YOU MENTIONED THAT IT'S      
STARTING SOON AND I HAVE SEEN   

01:20:50.009 --> 01:20:53.276
SO YOU MENTIONED THAT IT'S      
STARTING SOON AND I HAVE SEEN   
SOME OF THE ADT STRIPS ON SOME  

01:20:53.278 --> 01:20:54.044
STARTING SOON AND I HAVE SEEN   
SOME OF THE ADT STRIPS ON SOME  
OF THESE CORRIDORS IN QUESTION  

01:20:54.046 --> 01:20:54.844
SOME OF THE ADT STRIPS ON SOME  
OF THESE CORRIDORS IN QUESTION  
JUST IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR    

01:20:54.846 --> 01:20:55.179
OF THESE CORRIDORS IN QUESTION  
JUST IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR    
HOURS.                          

01:20:55.181 --> 01:20:56.981
JUST IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR    
HOURS.                          
SO I ASSUME THAT THAT'S WHAT    

01:20:56.983 --> 01:21:00.417
HOURS.

THE VEHICLE DATA FOR AND ARE    

01:21:05.123 --> 01:21:08.691
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE COLLECTING 
THE VEHICLE DATA FOR AND ARE    
YOU LOOKING AT SPEEDS AS WELL   

01:21:08.693 --> 01:21:09.092
THE VEHICLE DATA FOR AND ARE    
YOU LOOKING AT SPEEDS AS WELL   
AS VOLUMES?                     

01:21:09.094 --> 01:21:12.162
YOU LOOKING AT SPEEDS AS WELL   
AS VOLUMES?                     
>> YES, WE ARE GOING TO BE      

01:21:12.164 --> 01:21:12.863
AS VOLUMES?                     
>> YES, WE ARE GOING TO BE      
GETTING WE'RE COLLECTING DATA   

01:21:12.865 --> 01:21:15.865
>> YES, WE ARE GOING TO BE      
GETTING WE'RE COLLECTING DATA   
FOR A ONE WEEK PERIOD AND I     

01:21:15.867 --> 01:21:16.699
GETTING WE'RE COLLECTING DATA   
FOR A ONE WEEK PERIOD AND I     
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT DATE  

01:21:16.701 --> 01:21:20.237
FOR A ONE WEEK PERIOD AND I     
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT DATE  
AND MIGHT NOT BE THE EXACT SAME 

01:21:20.239 --> 01:21:21.037
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT DATE  
AND MIGHT NOT BE THE EXACT SAME 
DATA ON EACH CORRIDOR YET BUT   

01:21:21.039 --> 01:21:23.841
AND MIGHT NOT BE THE EXACT SAME 
DATA ON EACH CORRIDOR YET BUT   
WE HAVE A CONTRACTOR TO DO THE  

01:21:23.843 --> 01:21:24.374
DATA ON EACH CORRIDOR YET BUT   
WE HAVE A CONTRACTOR TO DO THE  
COUNTS UNDERWAY.                

01:21:24.376 --> 01:21:25.242
WE HAVE A CONTRACTOR TO DO THE  
COUNTS UNDERWAY.                
THEY WILL BE SO THERE'LL BE     

01:21:25.244 --> 01:21:28.311
COUNTS UNDERWAY.                
THEY WILL BE SO THERE'LL BE     
SEVEN DAYS FOR WE CAN WE DO     

01:21:28.313 --> 01:21:28.912
THEY WILL BE SO THERE'LL BE     
SEVEN DAYS FOR WE CAN WE DO     
WANT TO AVOID A FOOTBALL.       

01:21:28.914 --> 01:21:31.848
SEVEN DAYS FOR WE CAN WE DO     
WANT TO AVOID A FOOTBALL.       
WE CAN GET MORE OF A TYPICAL    

01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:32.615
WANT TO AVOID A FOOTBALL.       
WE CAN GET MORE OF A TYPICAL    
WEEKEND WITHIN THAT SEVEN DAYS  

01:21:32.617 --> 01:21:35.819
WE CAN GET MORE OF A TYPICAL    
WEEKEND WITHIN THAT SEVEN DAYS  
AND IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE SPEED. 

01:21:35.821 --> 01:21:36.820
WEEKEND WITHIN THAT SEVEN DAYS  
AND IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE SPEED. 
SO WE'LL HAVE SPEEDS AND        

01:21:36.822 --> 01:21:40.124
AND IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE SPEED. 
SO WE'LL HAVE SPEEDS AND        
VOLUMES WE WILL NOT HAVE        

01:21:40.126 --> 01:21:40.791
SO WE'LL HAVE SPEEDS AND        
VOLUMES WE WILL NOT HAVE        
MULTIMODAL USERS LIKE BIKE      

01:21:40.793 --> 01:21:43.994
VOLUMES WE WILL NOT HAVE        
MULTIMODAL USERS LIKE BIKE      
VOLUMES AND WHATNOT ALTHOUGH WE 

01:21:43.996 --> 01:21:44.795
MULTIMODAL USERS LIKE BIKE      
VOLUMES AND WHATNOT ALTHOUGH WE 
WILL BE COLLECTING THAT LATER   

01:21:44.797 --> 01:21:46.530
VOLUMES AND WHATNOT ALTHOUGH WE 
WILL BE COLLECTING THAT LATER   
IN THE PROCESS.                 

01:21:46.532 --> 01:21:47.530
WILL BE COLLECTING THAT LATER   
IN THE PROCESS.                 
I'M JUST CURIOUS IS THERE A     

01:21:47.532 --> 01:21:50.834
IN THE PROCESS.                 
I'M JUST CURIOUS IS THERE A     
REASON ONLY SEVEN DAYS I MEAN   

01:21:50.836 --> 01:21:51.501
I'M JUST CURIOUS IS THERE A     
REASON ONLY SEVEN DAYS I MEAN   
JUST FROM AN OUTSIDER           

01:21:51.503 --> 01:21:54.871
REASON ONLY SEVEN DAYS I MEAN   
JUST FROM AN OUTSIDER           
PERSPECTIVE IT SEEMS LIKE THE   

01:21:54.873 --> 01:21:55.572
JUST FROM AN OUTSIDER           
PERSPECTIVE IT SEEMS LIKE THE   
STRIPS ARE OUT THERE JUST LET   

01:21:55.574 --> 01:21:57.441
PERSPECTIVE IT SEEMS LIKE THE   
STRIPS ARE OUT THERE JUST LET   
THEM BE FOR A LONG TIME BUT     

01:21:57.443 --> 01:21:58.775
STRIPS ARE OUT THERE JUST LET   
THEM BE FOR A LONG TIME BUT     
DOES IT TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT OR 

01:21:58.777 --> 01:22:01.812
THEM BE FOR A LONG TIME BUT     
DOES IT TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT OR 
SOMETHING TO COLLECT COLLEGE    

01:22:01.814 --> 01:22:02.746
DOES IT TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT OR 
SOMETHING TO COLLECT COLLEGE    
TOWN THINGS ARE VERY UP AND     

01:22:02.748 --> 01:22:06.216
SOMETHING TO COLLECT COLLEGE    
TOWN THINGS ARE VERY UP AND     
DOWN AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.      

01:22:06.218 --> 01:22:06.750
TOWN THINGS ARE VERY UP AND     
DOWN AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.      
>> ALL RIGHT.                   

01:22:06.752 --> 01:22:09.987
DOWN AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.      
>> ALL RIGHT.                   
WELL AND THAT WAS THAT'S WHY IT 

01:22:09.989 --> 01:22:10.787
>> ALL RIGHT.                   
WELL AND THAT WAS THAT'S WHY IT 
WAS CONSIDERED WE WANTED TO     

01:22:10.789 --> 01:22:13.790
WELL AND THAT WAS THAT'S WHY IT 
WAS CONSIDERED WE WANTED TO     
HAVE IT DEFINITELY OUT OF THE   

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:14.557
WAS CONSIDERED WE WANTED TO     
HAVE IT DEFINITELY OUT OF THE   
UNIVERSITY IN SESSION BUT NOT   

01:22:14.559 --> 01:22:17.794
HAVE IT DEFINITELY OUT OF THE   
UNIVERSITY IN SESSION BUT NOT   
NECESSARILY A SUPER PEAK.       

01:22:17.796 --> 01:22:21.297
UNIVERSITY IN SESSION BUT NOT   
NECESSARILY A SUPER PEAK.       
SO AND I THINK FOR EVENTS LIKE  

01:22:21.299 --> 01:22:21.965
NECESSARILY A SUPER PEAK.       
SO AND I THINK FOR EVENTS LIKE  
SAY A FOOTBALL GAME OR OTHER

SO AND I THINK FOR EVENTS LIKE  
SAY A FOOTBALL GAME OR OTHER    
SPECIAL EVENTS, THE CONCERT

SPECIAL EVENTS, THE CONCERT     
COMING UP THAT WE WANTED TO     
AVOID WE DON'T NECESSARILY

COMING UP THAT WE WANTED TO     
AVOID WE DON'T NECESSARILY      
DESIGN STREETS FOR THOSE        

01:22:30.076 --> 01:22:30.874
AVOID WE DON'T NECESSARILY      
DESIGN STREETS FOR THOSE        
HIGHEST PEAK EVENTS THAT WE     

01:22:30.876 --> 01:22:33.309
DESIGN STREETS FOR THOSE        
HIGHEST PEAK EVENTS THAT WE     
WANTED TO DESIGN FOR A TYPICAL  

01:22:33.311 --> 01:22:33.544
HIGHEST PEAK EVENTS THAT WE     
WANTED TO DESIGN FOR A TYPICAL  
EVENT.                          

01:22:33.546 --> 01:22:34.277
WANTED TO DESIGN FOR A TYPICAL  
EVENT.                          
THERE ARE TYPICAL CONDITIONS    

01:22:34.279 --> 01:22:38.082
EVENT.                          
THERE ARE TYPICAL CONDITIONS    
AND THEN MANAGE THE EVENTS AND  

01:22:38.084 --> 01:22:41.919
THERE ARE TYPICAL CONDITIONS    
AND THEN MANAGE THE EVENTS AND  
THE COST OF HAVING YOU KNOW,    

01:22:41.921 --> 01:22:42.986
AND THEN MANAGE THE EVENTS AND  
THE COST OF HAVING YOU KNOW,    
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE ALL THAT DATA 

01:22:42.988 --> 01:22:45.055
THE COST OF HAVING YOU KNOW,    
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE ALL THAT DATA 
OF CONTINUOUS COUNTERS BUT IT   

01:22:45.057 --> 01:22:45.989
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE ALL THAT DATA 
OF CONTINUOUS COUNTERS BUT IT   
WOULD BE A VERY HIGH COST AND   

01:22:45.991 --> 01:22:48.992
OF CONTINUOUS COUNTERS BUT IT   
WOULD BE A VERY HIGH COST AND   
THAT WOULD BE WELL IT WOULD     

01:22:48.994 --> 01:22:49.660
WOULD BE A VERY HIGH COST AND   
THAT WOULD BE WELL IT WOULD     
DELAY THE STUDY FOR A LONG      

01:22:49.662 --> 01:22:50.560
THAT WOULD BE WELL IT WOULD     
DELAY THE STUDY FOR A LONG      
PERIOD TO COLLECT ALL THE DATA  

01:22:50.562 --> 01:22:53.296
DELAY THE STUDY FOR A LONG      
PERIOD TO COLLECT ALL THE DATA  
SO A WEEK BECAUSE A VERY        

01:22:53.298 --> 01:22:54.097
PERIOD TO COLLECT ALL THE DATA  
SO A WEEK BECAUSE A VERY        
TYPICAL AMOUNT AND THEN WE KNOW 

01:22:54.099 --> 01:22:56.633
SO A WEEK BECAUSE A VERY        
TYPICAL AMOUNT AND THEN WE KNOW 
WE COULD LOOK AT CONTINUOUS     

01:22:56.635 --> 01:22:57.500
TYPICAL AMOUNT AND THEN WE KNOW 
WE COULD LOOK AT CONTINUOUS     
COUNTERS TO SEE IF WE'VE HIT    

01:22:57.502 --> 01:22:59.870
WE COULD LOOK AT CONTINUOUS     
COUNTERS TO SEE IF WE'VE HIT    
SOME UNUSUAL CONDITIONS.        

01:22:59.872 --> 01:23:00.670
COUNTERS TO SEE IF WE'VE HIT    
SOME UNUSUAL CONDITIONS.        
>> THANK YOU, LORD.             

01:23:00.672 --> 01:23:04.207
SOME UNUSUAL CONDITIONS.        
>> THANK YOU, LORD.             
YEAH, I HAD A SIMILAR QUESTION. 

01:23:04.209 --> 01:23:05.142
>> THANK YOU, LORD.             
YEAH, I HAD A SIMILAR QUESTION. 
JUST ONE OTHER POINT I'M        

01:23:05.144 --> 01:23:07.744
YEAH, I HAD A SIMILAR QUESTION. 
JUST ONE OTHER POINT I'M        
CURIOUS ABOUT.                  

01:23:07.746 --> 01:23:08.678
JUST ONE OTHER POINT I'M        
CURIOUS ABOUT.                  
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE    

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:11.781
CURIOUS ABOUT.                  
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE    
CITY DOES HAVE SOME HEIDA       

01:23:11.783 --> 01:23:15.652
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE    
CITY DOES HAVE SOME HEIDA       
INSTALLED AT SPECIFIC LIGHTS.   

01:23:15.654 --> 01:23:16.686
CITY DOES HAVE SOME HEIDA       
INSTALLED AT SPECIFIC LIGHTS.   
FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY I KNOW    

01:23:16.688 --> 01:23:19.455
INSTALLED AT SPECIFIC LIGHTS.   
FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY I KNOW    
THERE WAS A NEW TRAFFIC CAMERA  

01:23:19.457 --> 01:23:20.224
FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY I KNOW    
THERE WAS A NEW TRAFFIC CAMERA  
INSTALLED AT THE INTERSECTION   

01:23:20.226 --> 01:23:22.926
THERE WAS A NEW TRAFFIC CAMERA  
INSTALLED AT THE INTERSECTION   
OF STADIUM AND INDUSTRIAL AND   

01:23:22.928 --> 01:23:23.627
INSTALLED AT THE INTERSECTION   
OF STADIUM AND INDUSTRIAL AND   
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT LIGHT  

01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:26.930
OF STADIUM AND INDUSTRIAL AND   
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT LIGHT  
CAN DETECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 

01:23:26.932 --> 01:23:27.531
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT LIGHT  
CAN DETECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 
DETECT MULTIMODAL.              

01:23:27.533 --> 01:23:30.734
CAN DETECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 
DETECT MULTIMODAL.              
IS THAT A FACTOR BEING          

01:23:30.736 --> 01:23:31.535
DETECT MULTIMODAL.              
IS THAT A FACTOR BEING          
CONSIDERED AS WELL IN TERMS     

01:23:31.537 --> 01:23:34.538
IS THAT A FACTOR BEING          
CONSIDERED AS WELL IN TERMS     
OF DATA SOURCES FOR MEASURING   

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:34.938
CONSIDERED AS WELL IN TERMS     
OF DATA SOURCES FOR MEASURING   
STREET?                         

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:35.405
OF DATA SOURCES FOR MEASURING   
STREET?                         
>> YES.                         

01:23:35.407 --> 01:23:38.609
STREET?                         
>> YES.                         
SO WE WILL BE AND I'LL GET TO   

01:23:38.611 --> 01:23:39.709
>> YES.                         
SO WE WILL BE AND I'LL GET TO   
THAT IN THE NEXT STAGE WHEN WE  

01:23:39.711 --> 01:23:41.845
SO WE WILL BE AND I'LL GET TO   
THAT IN THE NEXT STAGE WHEN WE  
GET INTO DESIGN WE WILL BE      

01:23:41.847 --> 01:23:42.779
THAT IN THE NEXT STAGE WHEN WE  
GET INTO DESIGN WE WILL BE      
DOING TO GET MULTIMODAL COUNTS  

01:23:42.781 --> 01:23:43.380
GET INTO DESIGN WE WILL BE      
DOING TO GET MULTIMODAL COUNTS  
TO INCLUDE PEDESTRIANS AND      

01:23:43.382 --> 01:23:45.949
DOING TO GET MULTIMODAL COUNTS  
TO INCLUDE PEDESTRIANS AND      
BIKES.                          

01:23:45.951 --> 01:23:46.917
TO INCLUDE PEDESTRIANS AND      
BIKES.                          
WE REALLY NEED TO USE CAMERA    

01:23:46.919 --> 01:23:49.786
BIKES.                          
WE REALLY NEED TO USE CAMERA    
DATA COLLECTORS AND SO THAT'S   

01:23:49.788 --> 01:23:50.554
WE REALLY NEED TO USE CAMERA    
DATA COLLECTORS AND SO THAT'S   
PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU   

01:23:50.556 --> 01:23:51.087
DATA COLLECTORS AND SO THAT'S   
PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU   
HAVE INSTALLED.                 

01:23:51.089 --> 01:23:53.557
PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU   
HAVE INSTALLED.                 
MANY CITIES ARE INSTALLING      

01:23:53.559 --> 01:23:54.591
HAVE INSTALLED.                 
MANY CITIES ARE INSTALLING      
CAMERAS AS THEY UPGRADE SIGNAL  

01:23:54.593 --> 01:23:58.461
MANY CITIES ARE INSTALLING      
CAMERAS AS THEY UPGRADE SIGNAL  
EQUIPMENT OR YOU KNOW AND SO    

01:23:58.463 --> 01:23:59.162
CAMERAS AS THEY UPGRADE SIGNAL  
EQUIPMENT OR YOU KNOW AND SO    
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT   

01:23:59.164 --> 01:24:01.999
EQUIPMENT OR YOU KNOW AND SO    
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT   
WE WOULD BE USING TO COLLECT    

01:24:02.001 --> 01:24:02.866
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT   
WE WOULD BE USING TO COLLECT    
THE DETAILED WHAT WE CALL A     

01:24:02.868 --> 01:24:06.135
WE WOULD BE USING TO COLLECT    
THE DETAILED WHAT WE CALL A     
TURNING MOVEMENT AT THE         

01:24:06.137 --> 01:24:06.803
THE DETAILED WHAT WE CALL A     
TURNING MOVEMENT AT THE         
INTERSECTION AND WHAT WILL BE   

01:24:06.805 --> 01:24:08.838
TURNING MOVEMENT AT THE         
INTERSECTION AND WHAT WILL BE   
WE'LL BE DOING THAT KIND        

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.040
INTERSECTION AND WHAT WILL BE   
WE'LL BE DOING THAT KIND        
OF LATER AS WE FOCUS IN ON THE  

01:24:10.042 --> 01:24:13.309
WE'LL BE DOING THAT KIND        
OF LATER AS WE FOCUS IN ON THE  
MOST CHALLENGING LOCATIONS AND  

01:24:13.311 --> 01:24:14.143
OF LATER AS WE FOCUS IN ON THE  
MOST CHALLENGING LOCATIONS AND  
ESPECIALLY WHERE WE HAVE TWO    

01:24:14.145 --> 01:24:17.013
MOST CHALLENGING LOCATIONS AND  
ESPECIALLY WHERE WE HAVE TWO    
OF THESE CORRIDORS COMING       

01:24:17.015 --> 01:24:17.380
ESPECIALLY WHERE WE HAVE TWO    
OF THESE CORRIDORS COMING       
TOGETHER.                       

01:24:17.382 --> 01:24:18.048
OF THESE CORRIDORS COMING       
TOGETHER.                       
WE'LL GET THOSE MULTI-MODAL     

01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.448
TOGETHER.                       
WE'LL GET THOSE MULTI-MODAL     
COUNTS.                         

01:24:18.450 --> 01:24:21.018
WE'LL GET THOSE MULTI-MODAL     
COUNTS.                         
BUT FOR THE AMOUNT OF PLACES    

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:21.885
COUNTS.                         
BUT FOR THE AMOUNT OF PLACES    
THAT WE NEED AT THIS POINT      

01:24:21.887 --> 01:24:23.152
BUT FOR THE AMOUNT OF PLACES    
THAT WE NEED AT THIS POINT      
DOING WHAT WE CALL THE YARRA    

01:24:23.154 --> 01:24:27.558
THAT WE NEED AT THIS POINT      
DOING WHAT WE CALL THE YARRA    
TWO COUNTS WAS WHAT WE THINK IS 

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:31.061
DOING WHAT WE CALL THE YARRA    
TWO COUNTS WAS WHAT WE THINK IS 
SUFFICIENT FOR NOW AND WILL GET 

01:24:31.063 --> 01:24:31.995
TWO COUNTS WAS WHAT WE THINK IS 
SUFFICIENT FOR NOW AND WILL GET

UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SPEED   
AND THEN HAVE SOME IDEA OF HOW  
IT MIGHT CHANGE WITH DIFFERENT

THAT MEANS YOU KNOW, THAT'S     
ACTUALLY A VERY IN THIS CASE A  
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF SINGLE

WHEN EVEN THOUGH THERE WEREN'T  
A LOT OF BIKING TRIPS BUT THERE 
WERE SOME AND SO THIS CHART ON

A LOT OF BIKING TRIPS BUT THERE 
WERE SOME AND SO THIS CHART ON

01:33:04.476 --> 01:33:05.208
USING REPLICA DATA ON PAPPERT   
STREET AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS  
THE MAJORITY OF THE BIKING      

01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:07.943
STREET AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS  
THE MAJORITY OF THE BIKING      
TRIPS ARE OF LENGTH BETWEEN     

01:33:07.945 --> 01:33:08.878
THE MAJORITY OF THE BIKING      
TRIPS ARE OF LENGTH BETWEEN     
FOUR AND EIGHT MILES AND THAT'S 

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.914
TRIPS ARE OF LENGTH BETWEEN     
FOUR AND EIGHT MILES AND THAT'S 
THAT'S KIND OF TYPICAL.         

01:33:11.916 --> 01:33:12.782
FOUR AND EIGHT MILES AND THAT'S 
THAT'S KIND OF TYPICAL.         
IT'S A GOOD BIKING DISTANCE.    

01:33:12.784 --> 01:33:13.516
THAT'S KIND OF TYPICAL.         
IT'S A GOOD BIKING DISTANCE.    
THERE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE A FEW  

01:33:13.518 --> 01:33:15.151
IT'S A GOOD BIKING DISTANCE.    
THERE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE A FEW  
BIKING TRIPS OR EVEN LONGER     

01:33:15.153 --> 01:33:16.119
THERE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE A FEW  
BIKING TRIPS OR EVEN LONGER     
WHICH IS KIND OF A LITTLE MORE  

01:33:16.121 --> 01:33:16.385
BIKING TRIPS OR EVEN LONGER     
WHICH IS KIND OF A LITTLE MORE  
UNUSUAL.

WHICH IS KIND OF A LITTLE MORE  
UNUSUAL.                        
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT ACTIVE 

01:33:18.956 --> 01:33:19.889
UNUSUAL.                        
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT ACTIVE 
RIDERS FROM ANN ARBOR THAT ARE  

01:33:19.891 --> 01:33:23.359
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT ACTIVE 
RIDERS FROM ANN ARBOR THAT ARE  
NOT AFRAID TO TAKE LONG         

01:33:23.361 --> 01:33:23.693
RIDERS FROM ANN ARBOR THAT ARE  
NOT AFRAID TO TAKE LONG         
DISTANCES.                      

01:33:23.695 --> 01:33:24.727
NOT AFRAID TO TAKE LONG         
DISTANCES.                      
A LOT OF RIDERS IN THE TWO TO   

01:33:24.729 --> 01:33:26.962
DISTANCES.                      
A LOT OF RIDERS IN THE TWO TO

A LOT OF RIDERS IN THE TWO TO   
FOUR MILE RANGE.                
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AUTO 

01:33:30.602 --> 01:33:31.767
FOUR MILE RANGE.                
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AUTO 
A CHART ON THE RIGHT SHOWS THE  

01:33:31.769 --> 01:33:34.136
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AUTO 
A CHART ON THE RIGHT SHOWS THE

YOU CAN SEE IS ON PAPPERT       

01:33:35.006 --> 01:33:35.739
LENGTH OF AUTO TRIPS AND WHAT   
YOU CAN SEE IS ON PAPPERT       
STREET THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE 

01:33:35.741 --> 01:33:38.641
YOU CAN SEE IS ON PAPPERT       
STREET THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE 
SHORT TRIPS SO THE MOST COMMON  

01:33:38.643 --> 01:33:42.011
STREET THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE 
SHORT TRIPS SO THE MOST COMMON  
LENGTH OF AN AUTO TRIP          

01:33:42.013 --> 01:33:42.778
SHORT TRIPS SO THE MOST COMMON  
LENGTH OF AN AUTO TRIP          
UNPACKAGED IS ALSO BETWEEN FOUR 

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:43.479
LENGTH OF AN AUTO TRIP          
UNPACKAGED IS ALSO BETWEEN FOUR 
AND EIGHT MILES AND THAT'S      

01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:46.649
UNPACKAGED IS ALSO BETWEEN FOUR 
AND EIGHT MILES AND THAT'S      
REALLY ONE A TRIP LENGTH THAT   

01:33:46.651 --> 01:33:47.250
AND EIGHT MILES AND THAT'S      
REALLY ONE A TRIP LENGTH THAT   
HAS POTENTIAL FOR BIKING        

01:33:47.252 --> 01:33:50.619
REALLY ONE A TRIP LENGTH THAT   
HAS POTENTIAL FOR BIKING        
FURTHER THAT SHORTER TRIPS ARE  

01:33:50.621 --> 01:33:51.287
HAS POTENTIAL FOR BIKING        
FURTHER THAT SHORTER TRIPS ARE  
EVEN GREATER POTENTIAL FOR BIKE 

01:33:51.289 --> 01:33:54.123
FURTHER THAT SHORTER TRIPS ARE  
EVEN GREATER POTENTIAL FOR BIKE

EVEN GREATER POTENTIAL FOR BIKE 
LENGTH TRIPS.                   
SO WHAT WE'LL DO THIS KIND      

01:33:55.226 --> 01:33:58.294

SO WHAT WE'LL DO THIS KIND      
OF ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT  
ARE THE MODAL PATTERNS NOW?     

01:33:58.996 --> 01:34:01.864
OF ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT  
ARE THE MODAL PATTERNS NOW?     
WHERE ARE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES   

01:34:01.866 --> 01:34:02.866
ARE THE MODAL PATTERNS NOW?     
WHERE ARE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES   
OR MAYBE SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT 

01:34:02.868 --> 01:34:06.569
WHERE ARE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES   
OR MAYBE SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT 
FOR CHANGING MODE SHIFT IF WE   

01:34:06.571 --> 01:34:07.203
OR MAYBE SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT 
FOR CHANGING MODE SHIFT IF WE   
CHANGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND   

01:34:07.205 --> 01:34:12.241
FOR CHANGING MODE SHIFT IF WE   
CHANGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND   
PROVIDE IT OPPORTUNITIES.       

01:34:12.243 --> 01:34:13.109
CHANGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND   
PROVIDE IT OPPORTUNITIES.       
>> SO ANOTHER THING WE TALKED   

01:34:13.111 --> 01:34:13.710
PROVIDE IT OPPORTUNITIES.

ABOUT SPEED DATA.               
THIS IS AGAIN THIS IS DATA THAT

BUT WHAT WE CAN SEE IS WHERE    
THERE'S A POSTED SPEED LIMIT ON 

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:31.460
BUT WHAT WE CAN SEE IS WHERE    
THERE'S A POSTED SPEED LIMIT ON 
THE STREET OF 35 MILES AN HOUR. 

01:34:31.462 --> 01:34:36.031
THERE'S A POSTED SPEED LIMIT ON

SPEED REALLY AFFECTS IS THE     
DRIVERS FIELD OF VISION AT

SPEED REALLY AFFECTS IS THE     
DRIVERS FIELD OF VISION AT      
TWENTY MILES AN HOUR A DRIVER   

01:35:15.774 --> 01:35:16.639
DRIVERS FIELD OF VISION AT

HOUR IT'S QUITE NARROW.         

01:35:38.363 --> 01:35:39.495
NARROWED AND AT FORTY MILES AN  
HOUR IT'S QUITE NARROW.         
AND SO IN THIS CASE ON PACKARD  

01:35:39.497 --> 01:35:41.330
HOUR IT'S QUITE NARROW.         
AND SO IN THIS CASE ON PACKARD  
STREET WE'RE SEEING A LOT       

01:35:41.332 --> 01:35:42.031
AND SO IN THIS CASE ON PACKARD  
STREET WE'RE SEEING A LOT       
OF TRAFFIC AVERAGE BEING FORTY  

01:35:42.033 --> 01:35:42.565
STREET WE'RE SEEING A LOT       
OF TRAFFIC AVERAGE BEING FORTY  
ONE MILES AN HOUR.              

01:35:42.567 --> 01:35:46.035
OF TRAFFIC AVERAGE BEING FORTY  
ONE MILES AN HOUR.              
THAT WOULD BE A CLEAR SIGN THAT 

01:35:46.037 --> 01:35:46.636
ONE MILES AN HOUR.              
THAT WOULD BE A CLEAR SIGN THAT 
REDUCTION SPEED WOULD BE        

01:35:46.638 --> 01:35:49.538
THAT WOULD BE A CLEAR SIGN THAT 
REDUCTION SPEED WOULD BE        
IMPORTANT.                      

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:50.540
REDUCTION SPEED WOULD BE        
IMPORTANT.                      
I WAS STOPPING DISTANCE SORRY.  

01:35:50.542 --> 01:35:53.309
IMPORTANT.                      
I WAS STOPPING DISTANCE SORRY.  
THAT'S ALL I HAD REDUNDANT      

01:35:53.311 --> 01:35:54.010
I WAS STOPPING DISTANCE SORRY.  
THAT'S ALL I HAD REDUNDANT      
WHENEVER YOU HAVE AN

SLIDE.                          
IT'S GREAT THE METHODOLOGY SORT 
OF TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE THE   

01:36:12.463 --> 01:36:13.162
IT'S GREAT THE METHODOLOGY SORT 
OF TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE THE   
FACT THAT MODE SHIFTING WILL    

01:36:13.164 --> 01:36:13.897
OF TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE THE   
FACT THAT MODE SHIFTING WILL    
OCCUR IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS  

01:36:13.899 --> 01:36:14.330
FACT THAT MODE SHIFTING WILL    
OCCUR IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS  
DIFFERENT.                      

01:36:14.332 --> 01:36:15.531
OCCUR IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS  
DIFFERENT.                      
I JUST.                         

01:36:15.533 --> 01:36:16.598
DIFFERENT.                      
I JUST.                         
COULD YOU EXPLAIN MORE OF THAT  

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:20.002
I JUST.                         
COULD YOU EXPLAIN MORE OF THAT  
DATA ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE    

01:36:20.004 --> 01:36:20.669
COULD YOU EXPLAIN MORE OF THAT  
DATA ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE    
SLIDE WHERE YOU'RE TALKING      

01:36:20.671 --> 01:36:23.372
DATA ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE    
SLIDE WHERE YOU'RE TALKING      
ABOUT THAT?                     

01:36:23.374 --> 01:36:24.007
SLIDE WHERE YOU'RE TALKING      
ABOUT THAT?                     
WHERE IS THIS?                  

01:36:24.009 --> 01:36:24.874
ABOUT THAT?                     
WHERE IS THIS?                  
IT'S JUST LIKE TRIP DISTANCE    

01:36:24.876 --> 01:36:27.910
WHERE IS THIS?                  
IT'S JUST LIKE TRIP DISTANCE    
LIKE AND I APOLOGIZE IF YOU CAN 

01:36:27.912 --> 01:36:28.711
IT'S JUST LIKE TRIP DISTANCE    
LIKE AND I APOLOGIZE IF YOU CAN 
HEAR MY FAMILY SHOUTING AT THE  

01:36:28.713 --> 01:36:31.213
LIKE AND I APOLOGIZE IF YOU CAN 
HEAR MY FAMILY SHOUTING AT THE  
BASEBALL GAME IN THE BACKGROUND 

01:36:31.215 --> 01:36:35.251
HEAR MY FAMILY SHOUTING AT THE  
BASEBALL GAME IN THE BACKGROUND 
IS THIS LIKE ON THIS PARTICULAR 

01:36:35.253 --> 01:36:38.520
BASEBALL GAME IN THE BACKGROUND 
IS THIS LIKE ON THIS PARTICULAR 
SEGMENT FOR PEOPLE LIKE OR I'M  

01:36:38.522 --> 01:36:42.391
IS THIS LIKE ON THIS PARTICULAR 
SEGMENT FOR PEOPLE LIKE OR I'M  
SO HOW DO YOU THEN I UNDERSTAND 

01:36:42.393 --> 01:36:43.425
SEGMENT FOR PEOPLE LIKE OR I'M  
SO HOW DO YOU THEN I UNDERSTAND 
A LITTLE BIT OF THE TRANSLATION 

01:36:43.427 --> 01:36:46.896
SO HOW DO YOU THEN I UNDERSTAND 
A LITTLE BIT OF THE TRANSLATION 
BUT I I GUESS I'M UNSURE HOW    

01:36:46.898 --> 01:36:47.896
A LITTLE BIT OF THE TRANSLATION 
BUT I I GUESS I'M UNSURE HOW    
YOU TAKE THE NEGATIVE FROM THE  

01:36:47.898 --> 01:36:51.000
BUT I I GUESS I'M UNSURE HOW    
YOU TAKE THE NEGATIVE FROM THE  
BAD INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT TO  

01:36:51.002 --> 01:36:54.737
YOU TAKE THE NEGATIVE FROM THE  
BAD INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT TO  
PROJECT THE MOST OF YOU JUST    

01:36:54.739 --> 01:36:55.405
BAD INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT TO  
PROJECT THE MOST OF YOU JUST    
EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE.     

01:36:55.407 --> 01:36:56.338
PROJECT THE MOST OF YOU JUST    
EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE.     
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING  

01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:56.605
EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE.     
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING  
IT.                             

01:36:56.607 --> 01:36:58.641
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING  
IT.                             
I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW WELL WE   

01:36:58.643 --> 01:37:03.312
IT.                             
I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW WELL WE   
OFTEN LOOK AT YOU KNOW, THE     

01:37:03.314 --> 01:37:05.514
I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW WELL WE   
OFTEN LOOK AT YOU KNOW, THE     
TRIP LENGTH FOR THE AUTO TRIPS  

01:37:05.516 --> 01:37:06.449
OFTEN LOOK AT YOU KNOW, THE     
TRIP LENGTH FOR THE AUTO TRIPS  
AS AN INDICATOR OF WHAT IS      

01:37:06.451 --> 01:37:09.952
TRIP LENGTH FOR THE AUTO TRIPS  
AS AN INDICATOR OF WHAT IS      
THERE POTENTIAL FOR MORE BIKE   

01:37:09.954 --> 01:37:10.753
AS AN INDICATOR OF WHAT IS      
THERE POTENTIAL FOR MORE BIKE   
TRIPS AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE    

01:37:10.755 --> 01:37:14.189
THERE POTENTIAL FOR MORE BIKE   
TRIPS AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE    
LOOKING AT ON THE LEFT SIDE HOW 

01:37:14.191 --> 01:37:17.426
TRIPS AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE    
LOOKING AT ON THE LEFT SIDE HOW 
ARE PEOPLE CURRENTLY BIKING ON  

01:37:17.428 --> 01:37:17.927
LOOKING AT ON THE LEFT SIDE HOW 
ARE PEOPLE CURRENTLY BIKING ON  
THIS ROAD?                      

01:37:17.929 --> 01:37:18.928
ARE PEOPLE CURRENTLY BIKING ON  
THIS ROAD?                      
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT WITH 

01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:19.462
THIS ROAD?                      
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT WITH 
GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE.            

01:37:19.464 --> 01:37:20.963
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT WITH 
GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE.            
SO WE WE'D HOPE TO SEE A LOT    

01:37:20.965 --> 01:37:21.897
GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE.            
SO WE WE'D HOPE TO SEE A LOT    
MORE PEOPLE RIDING MAYBE A LOT  

01:37:21.899 --> 01:37:24.734
SO WE WE'D HOPE TO SEE A LOT    
MORE PEOPLE RIDING MAYBE A LOT  
OF ALL DIFFERENT POINTS AND     

01:37:24.736 --> 01:37:25.668
MORE PEOPLE RIDING MAYBE A LOT  
OF ALL DIFFERENT POINTS AND     
IT'S REALLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE   

01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:29.571
OF ALL DIFFERENT POINTS AND     
IT'S REALLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE   
IS PROBABLY THE MORE CRITICAL   

01:37:29.573 --> 01:37:30.506
IT'S REALLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE   
IS PROBABLY THE MORE CRITICAL   
PART IS WHAT WE WANT TO         

01:37:30.508 --> 01:37:32.641
IS PROBABLY THE MORE CRITICAL   
PART IS WHAT WE WANT TO         
UNDERSTAND IN THIS CORRIDOR     

01:37:32.643 --> 01:37:33.576
PART IS WHAT WE WANT TO         
UNDERSTAND IN THIS CORRIDOR     
THERE ARE A LOT OF SHORTER      

01:37:33.578 --> 01:37:37.580
UNDERSTAND IN THIS CORRIDOR     
THERE ARE A LOT OF SHORTER      
TRIPS THAT ARE POTENTIAL BIKE   

01:37:37.582 --> 01:37:40.616
THERE ARE A LOT OF SHORTER      
TRIPS THAT ARE POTENTIAL BIKE   
LENGTH TRIPS AND THAT THAT'S    

01:37:40.618 --> 01:37:41.484
TRIPS THAT ARE POTENTIAL BIKE   
LENGTH TRIPS AND THAT THAT'S    
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WITH      

01:37:41.486 --> 01:37:42.285
LENGTH TRIPS AND THAT THAT'S    
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WITH      
PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE WE'D   

01:37:42.287 --> 01:37:45.587
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WITH      
PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE WE'D   
EXPECT TO DRAW SOME OF THE DRAW 

01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:46.356
PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE WE'D   
EXPECT TO DRAW SOME OF THE DRAW 
SOME OF THOSE TRIPS OVER TO     

01:37:46.358 --> 01:37:52.328
EXPECT TO DRAW SOME OF THE DRAW 
SOME OF THOSE TRIPS OVER TO     
BIKE                            

01:38:05.776 --> 01:38:08.077
    .                           
>> OK, THAT MAKES SENSE.        
SO IT'S MORE IT'S KIND OF LIKE  

01:38:08.079 --> 01:38:08.811
>> OK, THAT MAKES SENSE.        
SO IT'S MORE IT'S KIND OF LIKE  
THE RIGHT THE LEFT SIDE INFORMS 

01:38:08.813 --> 01:38:09.545
SO IT'S MORE IT'S KIND OF LIKE  
THE RIGHT THE LEFT SIDE INFORMS 
A LITTLE BIT WHERE YOU THINK    

01:38:09.547 --> 01:38:10.279
THE RIGHT THE LEFT SIDE INFORMS 
A LITTLE BIT WHERE YOU THINK    
THE MODE SHIFT IS GOING TO      

01:38:10.281 --> 01:38:10.947
A LITTLE BIT WHERE YOU THINK    
THE MODE SHIFT IS GOING TO      
HAPPEN BUT THERE'S MORE FACTORS 

01:38:10.949 --> 01:38:11.681
THE MODE SHIFT IS GOING TO      
HAPPEN BUT THERE'S MORE FACTORS 
THAT GO INTO LIKE WHICH         

01:38:11.683 --> 01:38:12.348
HAPPEN BUT THERE'S MORE FACTORS 
THAT GO INTO LIKE WHICH         
OF THESE CAR TRIPS MIGHT BECOME 

01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.681
THAT GO INTO LIKE WHICH         
OF THESE CAR TRIPS MIGHT BECOME 
RIGHT.                          

01:38:12.683 --> 01:38:13.349
OF THESE CAR TRIPS MIGHT BECOME 
RIGHT.                          
YEAH AND WE CAN GET A LOT MORE  

01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:14.083
RIGHT.                          
YEAH AND WE CAN GET A LOT MORE  
I DIDN'T GET INTO THE FULL      

01:38:14.085 --> 01:38:14.817
YEAH AND WE CAN GET A LOT MORE  
I DIDN'T GET INTO THE FULL      
DETAIL BUT WE HAVE THINGS LIKE  

01:38:14.819 --> 01:38:15.618
I DIDN'T GET INTO THE FULL      
DETAIL BUT WE HAVE THINGS LIKE  
PURPOSE AND WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT 

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:16.352
DETAIL BUT WE HAVE THINGS LIKE  
PURPOSE AND WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT 
ORIGINS AND DESTINATIONS SO

THEY CAN STOP WITHIN 90 FEET AT 
FORTY MILES AN HOUR IT GOES ALL 
THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND   

01:39:13.911 --> 01:39:14.610
FORTY MILES AN HOUR IT GOES ALL 
THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND   
FIFTY FIVE FEET AND THERE'S     

01:39:14.612 --> 01:39:16.678
THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND   
FIFTY FIVE FEET AND THERE'S     
JUST DRIVER SLAMMING ON THE     

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:16.946
FIFTY FIVE FEET AND THERE'S     
JUST DRIVER SLAMMING ON THE     
BRAKES.                         

01:39:16.948 --> 01:39:20.249
JUST DRIVER SLAMMING ON THE     
BRAKES.                         
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS 

01:39:20.251 --> 01:39:21.049
BRAKES.                         
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS 
THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A        

01:39:21.051 --> 01:39:24.587
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS 
THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A        
FATALITY OR SEVERE INJURY ALSO  

01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:27.824
THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A        
FATALITY OR SEVERE INJURY ALSO  
REALLY CHANGES AT THESE SPEEDS  

01:39:27.826 --> 01:39:28.157
FATALITY OR SEVERE INJURY ALSO  
REALLY CHANGES AT THESE SPEEDS  
.                               

01:39:28.159 --> 01:39:29.324
REALLY CHANGES AT THESE SPEEDS  
.                               
SO AND THAT'S JUST BASED ON THE 

01:39:29.326 --> 01:39:31.560
.                               
SO AND THAT'S JUST BASED ON THE 
IMPACT AND POTENTIAL FOR

01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:32.762
IMPACT AND POTENTIAL FOR        
INJURY.                         
>> SO AT TWENTY MILES AN HOUR   

01:39:32.764 --> 01:39:35.464
INJURY.                         
>> SO AT TWENTY MILES AN HOUR   
WE HAVE THIRTEEN PERCENT        

01:39:35.466 --> 01:39:40.069
>> SO AT TWENTY MILES AN HOUR   
WE HAVE THIRTEEN PERCENT        
LIKELIHOOD OF A FATALITY OR     

01:39:40.071 --> 01:39:41.003
WE HAVE THIRTEEN PERCENT

PERCENT AND AT 40 MILES AN HOUR 
UP TO 73 PERCENT.               
SO THE MAJORITY OF CRASHES AND  

01:39:48.479 --> 01:39:51.714
UP TO 73 PERCENT.               
SO THE MAJORITY OF CRASHES AND  
IF WE GO BACK TO THE CHART ON   

01:39:51.716 --> 01:39:52.448
SO THE MAJORITY OF CRASHES AND  
IF WE GO BACK TO THE CHART ON   
THE LEFT SIDE WE DID LOOK AT    

01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:55.384
IF WE GO BACK TO THE CHART ON

HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN BUCKETS 

01:39:55.386 --> 01:39:56.319
THE LEFT SIDE WE DID LOOK AT    
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN BUCKETS 
OF SPEED AND SO WHAT WE FOUND   

01:39:56.321 --> 01:39:59.655
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN BUCKETS 
OF SPEED AND SO WHAT WE FOUND   
IS ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE      

01:39:59.657 --> 01:40:00.689
OF SPEED AND SO WHAT WE FOUND   
IS ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE      
DRIVERS WERE IN THAT 20 MILE AN

01:40:16.474 --> 01:40:19.375
MILES AN HOUR.                  
>> SO THIS CORRIDOR THERE'S     
CLEARLY A LOT OF SPEEDING

REASONS WHY IT'S ON THE HIGH    

01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:27.116
PROBLEM AND LIKELY ONE OF THE   
REASONS WHY IT'S ON THE HIGH    
INJURY NETWORK AND WE WOULD     

01:40:27.118 --> 01:40:28.017
REASONS WHY IT'S ON THE HIGH    
INJURY NETWORK AND WE WOULD     
DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT BEING A 

01:40:28.019 --> 01:40:32.020
INJURY NETWORK AND WE WOULD     
DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT BEING A 
PRIORITY HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THE 

01:40:32.022 --> 01:40:34.356
DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT BEING A 
PRIORITY HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THE 
SPEEDS ON THIS QUARTER.         

01:40:34.358 --> 01:40:38.627
PRIORITY HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THE 
SPEEDS ON THIS QUARTER.         
ANOTHER IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE  

01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:42.331
SPEEDS ON THIS QUARTER.         
ANOTHER IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE  
TO LOOK AT IS THE PRESENCE      

01:40:42.333 --> 01:40:43.332
ANOTHER IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE  
TO LOOK AT IS THE PRESENCE      
OF WHAT WE CALL A MULTIPLE      

01:40:43.334 --> 01:40:43.866
TO LOOK AT IS THE PRESENCE      
OF WHAT WE CALL A MULTIPLE      
THREAT CROSSING.                

01:40:43.868 --> 01:40:47.136
OF WHAT WE CALL A MULTIPLE      
THREAT CROSSING.                
SO ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE     

01:40:47.138 --> 01:40:48.171
THREAT CROSSING.                
SO ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE     
IMAGE OF THE SLIDE IS A MAP     

01:40:48.173 --> 01:40:50.906
SO ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE     
IMAGE OF THE SLIDE IS A MAP     
SHOWING ALL THE CORRIDORS.      

01:40:50.908 --> 01:40:51.974
IMAGE OF THE SLIDE IS A MAP     
SHOWING ALL THE CORRIDORS.      
WE HAVE AN ORANGE LINES AND     

01:40:51.976 --> 01:40:55.111
SHOWING ALL THE CORRIDORS.      
WE HAVE AN ORANGE LINES AND     
THEN THE GREEN DOTS ARE ALL     

01:40:55.113 --> 01:40:58.548
WE HAVE AN ORANGE LINES AND     
THEN THE GREEN DOTS ARE ALL     
PLACES WHERE WE HAVE CROSSINGS  

01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:59.482
THEN THE GREEN DOTS ARE ALL     
PLACES WHERE WE HAVE CROSSINGS  
THAT ARE NOT OUT OF REGULAR     

01:40:59.484 --> 01:41:02.952
PLACES WHERE WE HAVE CROSSINGS  
THAT ARE NOT OUT OF REGULAR     
TRAFFIC SIGNAL BUT RATHER HAVE  

01:41:02.954 --> 01:41:06.222
THAT ARE NOT OUT OF REGULAR     
TRAFFIC SIGNAL BUT RATHER HAVE  
AN RFP BUT WHEN EVEN AN RFP     

01:41:06.224 --> 01:41:09.658
TRAFFIC SIGNAL BUT RATHER HAVE  
AN RFP BUT WHEN EVEN AN RFP     
THEY'RE THEY'RE GREAT.          

01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:10.660
AN RFP BUT WHEN EVEN AN RFP     
THEY'RE THEY'RE GREAT.          
WE OF COURSE RECOMMEND THEM A   

01:41:10.662 --> 01:41:10.927
THEY'RE THEY'RE GREAT.          
WE OF COURSE RECOMMEND THEM A   
LOT.                            

01:41:10.929 --> 01:41:11.994
WE OF COURSE RECOMMEND THEM A   
LOT.                            
THERE'S A LOT IN ANN ARBOR AND  

01:41:11.996 --> 01:41:14.029
LOT.                            
THERE'S A LOT IN ANN ARBOR AND  
THAT'S A GREAT THING.           

01:41:14.031 --> 01:41:14.931
THERE'S A LOT IN ANN ARBOR AND  
THAT'S A GREAT THING.           
BUT THERE'S STILL WHEN YOU HAVE 

01:41:14.933 --> 01:41:17.567
THAT'S A GREAT THING.           
BUT THERE'S STILL WHEN YOU HAVE 
THE COMBINATION OF HIGH SPEEDS  

01:41:17.569 --> 01:41:18.533
BUT THERE'S STILL WHEN YOU HAVE 
THE COMBINATION OF HIGH SPEEDS  
AND YOU HAVE THE LACK           

01:41:18.535 --> 01:41:20.769
THE COMBINATION OF HIGH SPEEDS  
AND YOU HAVE THE LACK           
OF VISIBILITY WHERE ONE CAR     

01:41:20.771 --> 01:41:21.603
AND YOU HAVE THE LACK           
OF VISIBILITY WHERE ONE CAR     
STOPPING A PERSON STARTING TO   

01:41:21.605 --> 01:41:24.907
OF VISIBILITY WHERE ONE CAR     
STOPPING A PERSON STARTING TO   
CROSS AND THE ONCOMING CAR IN   

01:41:24.909 --> 01:41:25.707
STOPPING A PERSON STARTING TO   
CROSS AND THE ONCOMING CAR IN   
THE OTHER LANE DOESN'T SEE THE  

01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:26.375
CROSS AND THE ONCOMING CAR IN   
THE OTHER LANE DOESN'T SEE THE  
PEDESTRIAN WHICH ARE BLOCKED    

01:41:26.377 --> 01:41:29.345
THE OTHER LANE DOESN'T SEE THE  
PEDESTRIAN WHICH ARE BLOCKED    
FROM VIEW IS STILL A PLACE      

01:41:29.347 --> 01:41:32.615
PEDESTRIAN WHICH ARE BLOCKED    
FROM VIEW IS STILL A PLACE      
WHERE CRASHES CAN HAPPEN.       

01:41:32.617 --> 01:41:36.485
FROM VIEW IS STILL A PLACE      
WHERE CRASHES CAN HAPPEN.       
AND SO THE REALLY THE ONLY WAY  

01:41:36.487 --> 01:41:37.453
WHERE CRASHES CAN HAPPEN.       
AND SO THE REALLY THE ONLY WAY  
TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THAT IS 

01:41:37.455 --> 01:41:38.320
AND SO THE REALLY THE ONLY WAY  
TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THAT IS 
BY HAVING JUST ONE LANE TO      

01:41:38.322 --> 01:41:41.324
TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THAT IS 
BY HAVING JUST ONE LANE TO      
CROSS THE TIME SO THAT THERE'S  

01:41:41.326 --> 01:41:44.594
BY HAVING JUST ONE LANE TO      
CROSS THE TIME SO THAT THERE'S  
NO YOU KNOW, SOMEONE CAN CROSS  

01:41:44.596 --> 01:41:45.461
CROSS THE TIME SO THAT THERE'S  
NO YOU KNOW, SOMEONE CAN CROSS  
ONE LANE WAIT AND THEN CROSS    

01:41:45.463 --> 01:41:45.995
NO YOU KNOW, SOMEONE CAN CROSS  
ONE LANE WAIT AND THEN CROSS    
THE OTHER LINE.                 

01:41:45.997 --> 01:41:48.563
ONE LANE WAIT AND THEN CROSS    
THE OTHER LINE.                 
SO THIS IS A KIND OF SAFETY     

01:41:48.565 --> 01:41:49.498
THE OTHER LINE.                 
SO THIS IS A KIND OF SAFETY     
ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW, IS         

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.232
SO THIS IS A KIND OF SAFETY     
ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW, IS         
PROBABLY MORE PREVALENT IN SOME 

01:41:50.234 --> 01:41:52.567
ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW, IS         
PROBABLY MORE PREVALENT IN SOME 
QUARTERS THAN THE OTHERS WOULD  

01:41:52.569 --> 01:41:53.635
PROBABLY MORE PREVALENT IN SOME 
QUARTERS THAN THE OTHERS WOULD  
BE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND A   

01:41:53.637 --> 01:41:59.508
QUARTERS THAN THE OTHERS WOULD  
BE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND A   
RECONFIGURATION ANALYSIS AND    

01:41:59.510 --> 01:42:00.442
BE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND A   
RECONFIGURATION ANALYSIS AND    
THEN ANOTHER ELEMENT WOULD BE   

01:42:00.444 --> 01:42:01.143
RECONFIGURATION ANALYSIS AND    
THEN ANOTHER ELEMENT WOULD BE   
WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE PERSON   

01:42:01.145 --> 01:42:04.146
THEN ANOTHER ELEMENT WOULD BE   
WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE PERSON   
CAPACITY OR PERSON THROUGHPUT

THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT    

01:42:12.256 --> 01:42:12.855
FUTURE CONDITIONS AND HELP      
THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT    
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ROUND ANN      

01:42:12.857 --> 01:42:15.992
THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT    
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ROUND ANN      
ARBOR, WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THIS    

01:42:15.994 --> 01:42:16.459
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ROUND ANN      
ARBOR, WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THIS    
CORRIDOR.

CORRIDOR.                       
AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO OUR     
EXAMPLE OF PACKARD STREET, THE  

01:42:20.031 --> 01:42:20.830
AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO OUR     
EXAMPLE OF PACKARD STREET, THE  
EXISTING CONDITION IS TWO LANES 

01:42:20.832 --> 01:42:23.566
EXAMPLE OF PACKARD STREET, THE  
EXISTING CONDITION IS TWO LANES 
IN EACH DIRECTION WITH BIKE     

01:42:23.568 --> 01:42:24.500
EXISTING CONDITION IS TWO LANES 
IN EACH DIRECTION WITH BIKE     
LANES AND CENTER TURN LANE AND

IN EACH DIRECTION WITH BIKE     
LANES AND CENTER TURN LANE AND  
A PROPOSED CONDITION JUST       

01:42:27.838 --> 01:42:28.537
LANES AND CENTER TURN LANE AND  
A PROPOSED CONDITION JUST       
HYPOTHETICAL AT THIS POINT      

01:42:28.539 --> 01:42:29.138
A PROPOSED CONDITION JUST       
HYPOTHETICAL AT THIS POINT      
WOULD BE ONE LANE IN EACH       

01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:31.407
HYPOTHETICAL AT THIS POINT      
WOULD BE ONE LANE IN EACH       
DIRECTION LEFT TURN LANES AND   

01:42:31.409 --> 01:42:32.274
WOULD BE ONE LANE IN EACH       
DIRECTION LEFT TURN LANES AND   
MUCH WIDER BIKE LANES THAT ARE  

01:42:32.276 --> 01:42:35.143
DIRECTION LEFT TURN LANES AND   
MUCH WIDER BIKE LANES THAT ARE  
SEPARATED FROM TRAFFIC.         

01:42:35.145 --> 01:42:36.345
MUCH WIDER BIKE LANES THAT ARE  
SEPARATED FROM TRAFFIC.         
AND THEN THERE'S A TABLE ON THE 

01:42:36.347 --> 01:42:39.415
SEPARATED FROM TRAFFIC.         
AND THEN THERE'S A TABLE ON THE 
LEFT SIDE THAT SHOWS WHAT IS    

01:42:39.417 --> 01:42:42.584
AND THEN THERE'S A TABLE ON THE 
LEFT SIDE THAT SHOWS WHAT IS    
THE PERSON THROUGHPUT CAPACITY  

01:42:42.586 --> 01:42:43.618
LEFT SIDE THAT SHOWS WHAT IS    
THE PERSON THROUGHPUT CAPACITY  
FOR BOTH THE EXISTING AND THE   

01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:46.822
THE PERSON THROUGHPUT CAPACITY  
FOR BOTH THE EXISTING AND THE   
PROPOSED THREE LANES.           

01:42:46.824 --> 01:42:47.623
FOR BOTH THE EXISTING AND THE

KNOW, ANY CHANGES TO SERVICE OR 
BUS LANES.                      
SO THEY'RE BOTH 240 PER HOUR    

01:43:25.296 --> 01:43:29.131
BUS LANES.                      
SO THEY'RE BOTH 240 PER HOUR

SO THEY'RE BOTH 240 PER HOUR    
AND THAT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER  
OF BUSSES PER HOUR ON AVERAGE   

01:43:29.867 --> 01:43:33.602
AND THAT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER

01:43:33.604 --> 01:43:34.270
OF BUSSES PER HOUR ON AVERAGE   
AND HOW FULL THEY ARE AND THEN  
THE VEHICULAR CAPACITY          

01:43:34.272 --> 01:43:36.071
AND HOW FULL THEY ARE AND THEN  
THE VEHICULAR CAPACITY          
OF COURSE WILL CHANGE EXISTING  

01:43:36.073 --> 01:43:36.739
THE VEHICULAR CAPACITY          
OF COURSE WILL CHANGE EXISTING  
CONDITIONS FOUR THOUSAND TWO

TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY

SO JUST LOOKING OUT THERE IS AN 

01:43:49.087 --> 01:43:52.087
VEHICLES PER HOUR.              
SO JUST LOOKING OUT THERE IS AN 
OVERALL REDUCTION IN THIS SORT  

01:43:52.089 --> 01:43:52.888
SO JUST LOOKING OUT THERE IS AN 
OVERALL REDUCTION IN THIS SORT  
OF PERSON THROUGHPUT CAPACITY.  

01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:56.759
OVERALL REDUCTION IN THIS SORT  
OF PERSON THROUGHPUT CAPACITY.  
BUT THIS JUST GIVES US AN IDEA  

01:43:56.761 --> 01:43:57.626
OF PERSON THROUGHPUT CAPACITY.  
BUT THIS JUST GIVES US AN IDEA  
OF WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT 

01:43:57.628 --> 01:43:59.995
BUT THIS JUST GIVES US AN IDEA  
OF WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT 
DESIGN AND YOU KNOW, ARE WE     

01:43:59.997 --> 01:44:04.066
OF WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT 
DESIGN AND YOU KNOW, ARE WE     
PROVIDING SUFFICIENT MOBILITY

MEETS THE VISION FOR THE CITY.  

01:44:07.171 --> 01:44:11.506
AND YOU KNOW IN A WAY THAT      
MEETS THE VISION FOR THE CITY.  
SO AT THE END OF SORRY.         

01:44:11.508 --> 01:44:12.107
MEETS THE VISION FOR THE CITY.  
SO AT THE END OF SORRY.         
>> GO AHEAD.                    

01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.508
SO AT THE END OF SORRY.

THANKS LUCY.                    

01:44:12.976 --> 01:44:15.410
OH YEAH.                        
THANKS LUCY.                    
THAT'S REALLY CLEAR.            

01:44:15.412 --> 01:44:18.947
THANKS LUCY.                    
THAT'S REALLY CLEAR.            
I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS  

01:44:18.949 --> 01:44:19.949
THAT'S REALLY CLEAR.            
I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS  
ABOUT HOW YOU CALCULATE THE     

01:44:19.951 --> 01:44:22.651
I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS  
ABOUT HOW YOU CALCULATE THE     
INCREASED BIKE THROUGHPUT LIKE  

01:44:22.653 --> 01:44:26.856
ABOUT HOW YOU CALCULATE THE     
INCREASED BIKE THROUGHPUT LIKE  
CYCLIST THROUGHPUT CAPACITY     

01:44:26.858 --> 01:44:27.790
INCREASED BIKE THROUGHPUT LIKE  
CYCLIST THROUGHPUT CAPACITY     
JUST WITH WIDENING THE LANE AND 

01:44:27.792 --> 01:44:31.193
CYCLIST THROUGHPUT CAPACITY     
JUST WITH WIDENING THE LANE AND 
THEN ALSO IN TERMS OF THE       

01:44:31.195 --> 01:44:32.127
JUST WITH WIDENING THE LANE AND 
THEN ALSO IN TERMS OF THE       
TRANSIT CAPACITY LIKE WHY IS IT 

01:44:32.129 --> 01:44:35.430
THEN ALSO IN TERMS OF THE       
TRANSIT CAPACITY LIKE WHY IS IT 
THAT THE METHODOLOGY IS ONLY    

01:44:35.432 --> 01:44:39.435
TRANSIT CAPACITY LIKE WHY IS IT 
THAT THE METHODOLOGY IS ONLY    
BASED ON EXISTING A HOW FULL    

01:44:39.437 --> 01:44:40.169
THAT THE METHODOLOGY IS ONLY    
BASED ON EXISTING A HOW FULL    
THE BUSSES ARE IN THE CURRENT   

01:44:40.171 --> 01:44:42.638
BASED ON EXISTING A HOW FULL    
THE BUSSES ARE IN THE CURRENT   
CONDITION IF THE EXPECTATION OR 

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.441
THE BUSSES ARE IN THE CURRENT   
CONDITION IF THE EXPECTATION OR 
LIKE THE THEORY IS THAT PEOPLE  

01:44:46.443 --> 01:44:50.178
CONDITION IF THE EXPECTATION OR 
LIKE THE THEORY IS THAT PEOPLE  
WILL INCLUDE MODE SHIFT IN THE  

01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:50.612
LIKE THE THEORY IS THAT PEOPLE  
WILL INCLUDE MODE SHIFT IN THE  
NEW CONDITION?                  

01:44:50.614 --> 01:44:51.646
WILL INCLUDE MODE SHIFT IN THE  
NEW CONDITION?                  
>> WELL THOSE ARE GOOD          

01:44:51.648 --> 01:44:54.417
NEW CONDITION?                  
>> WELL THOSE ARE GOOD          
QUESTIONS AND THE BICYCLE       

01:44:54.419 --> 01:44:55.383
>> WELL THOSE ARE GOOD          
QUESTIONS AND THE BICYCLE       
CAPACITY IS BASED ON RESEARCH   

01:44:55.385 --> 01:44:58.788
QUESTIONS AND THE BICYCLE       
CAPACITY IS BASED ON RESEARCH   
AND WE'RE DRAWING THIS RIGHT    

01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:02.057
CAPACITY IS BASED ON RESEARCH   
AND WE'RE DRAWING THIS RIGHT    
FROM NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION    

01:45:02.059 --> 01:45:02.658
AND WE'RE DRAWING THIS RIGHT    
FROM NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION    
RESEARCH DATA SOURCES.          

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:03.926
FROM NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION    
RESEARCH DATA SOURCES.          
>> BUT THE IDEA IS IF YOU HAVE  

01:45:03.928 --> 01:45:06.127
RESEARCH DATA SOURCES.          
>> BUT THE IDEA IS IF YOU HAVE  
A LOT OF RIDERS AND PEOPLE      

01:45:06.129 --> 01:45:06.829
>> BUT THE IDEA IS IF YOU HAVE  
A LOT OF RIDERS AND PEOPLE      
WOULD BE SIDE BY SIDE, THEY     

01:45:06.831 --> 01:45:09.898
A LOT OF RIDERS AND PEOPLE      
WOULD BE SIDE BY SIDE, THEY     
COULD PASS A SLOW RIDER.        

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:13.635
WOULD BE SIDE BY SIDE, THEY     
COULD PASS A SLOW RIDER.        
THEY'D BE YOU CAN JUST ADD A    

01:45:13.637 --> 01:45:14.370
COULD PASS A SLOW RIDER.        
THEY'D BE YOU CAN JUST ADD A    
LOT MORE PEOPLE THROUGH ON THE  

01:45:14.372 --> 01:45:17.672
THEY'D BE YOU CAN JUST ADD A    
LOT MORE PEOPLE THROUGH ON THE  
WIDER BIKE LANES AND AGAIN      

01:45:17.674 --> 01:45:18.273
LOT MORE PEOPLE THROUGH ON THE  
WIDER BIKE LANES AND AGAIN      
THAT'S BASED ON RESEARCH.       

01:45:18.275 --> 01:45:20.943
WIDER BIKE LANES AND AGAIN      
THAT'S BASED ON RESEARCH.       
I'M TRANCED I THINK YOU HAVE A  

01:45:20.945 --> 01:45:21.877
THAT'S BASED ON RESEARCH.       
I'M TRANCED I THINK YOU HAVE A  
VERY FAIR POINT THAT IN THIS    

01:45:21.879 --> 01:45:25.146
I'M TRANCED I THINK YOU HAVE A  
VERY FAIR POINT THAT IN THIS    
CASE AND AGAIN THIS IS OUR      

01:45:25.148 --> 01:45:28.316
VERY FAIR POINT THAT IN THIS    
CASE AND AGAIN THIS IS OUR      
HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE WE DIDN'T  

01:45:28.318 --> 01:45:29.251
CASE AND AGAIN THIS IS OUR      
HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE WE DIDN'T  
PROJECT ANY BIG CHANGES TO      

01:45:29.253 --> 01:45:29.985
HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE WE DIDN'T  
PROJECT ANY BIG CHANGES TO      
TRANSIT SERVICE THAT MIGHT LEAD 

01:45:29.987 --> 01:45:33.154
PROJECT ANY BIG CHANGES TO      
TRANSIT SERVICE THAT MIGHT LEAD 
TO MORE RIDERSHIP BASED ON THE  

01:45:33.156 --> 01:45:33.589
TRANSIT SERVICE THAT MIGHT LEAD 
TO MORE RIDERSHIP BASED ON THE  
CITY'S PLAN.                    

01:45:33.591 --> 01:45:36.892
TO MORE RIDERSHIP BASED ON THE  
CITY'S PLAN.                    
THIS IS NOT PROPOSED AS A MAJOR 

01:45:36.894 --> 01:45:37.359
CITY'S PLAN.                    
THIS IS NOT PROPOSED AS A MAJOR 
TRANSIT CORRIDOR.               

01:45:37.361 --> 01:45:38.027
THIS IS NOT PROPOSED AS A MAJOR 
TRANSIT CORRIDOR.               
I THINK IN SOME OF THE          

01:45:38.029 --> 01:45:40.896
TRANSIT CORRIDOR.               
I THINK IN SOME OF THE          
CORRIDORS WHERE THERE'S A BRT   

01:45:40.898 --> 01:45:44.766
I THINK IN SOME OF THE          
CORRIDORS WHERE THERE'S A BRT   
SERVICE PROJECTED WE WOULD BE   

01:45:44.768 --> 01:45:45.501
CORRIDORS WHERE THERE'S A BRT   
SERVICE PROJECTED WE WOULD BE   
WORKING WITH THE RIDE TO LOOK   

01:45:45.503 --> 01:45:48.537
SERVICE PROJECTED WE WOULD BE   
WORKING WITH THE RIDE TO LOOK   
AT WHAT WOULD THE CAPACITY BE,  

01:45:48.539 --> 01:45:49.404
WORKING WITH THE RIDE TO LOOK   
AT WHAT WOULD THE CAPACITY BE,  
WOULD THERE BE MORE FREQUENCY?  

01:45:49.406 --> 01:45:52.474
AT WHAT WOULD THE CAPACITY BE,  
WOULD THERE BE MORE FREQUENCY?  
WOULD THEY BE FULLER BUSSES SO  

01:45:52.476 --> 01:45:53.409
WOULD THERE BE MORE FREQUENCY?  
WOULD THEY BE FULLER BUSSES SO  
WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE LOOKING  

01:45:53.411 --> 01:45:55.544
WOULD THEY BE FULLER BUSSES SO  
WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE LOOKING  
AT TRANSIT ON THE CORRIDORS,    

01:45:55.546 --> 01:45:56.345
WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE LOOKING  
AT TRANSIT ON THE CORRIDORS,    
THE APPROPRIATE CORRIDORS THAT  

01:45:56.347 --> 01:45:59.715
AT TRANSIT ON THE CORRIDORS,    
THE APPROPRIATE CORRIDORS THAT  
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE AND I    

01:45:59.717 --> 01:46:00.515
THE APPROPRIATE CORRIDORS THAT  
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE AND I    
THINK THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN   

01:46:00.517 --> 01:46:01.116
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE AND I    
THINK THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN   
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A        

01:46:01.118 --> 01:46:04.052
THINK THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN   
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A        
PLANNED BRT ROUTE LIKE ON THE   

01:46:04.054 --> 01:46:04.720
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A        
PLANNED BRT ROUTE LIKE ON THE   
CORRIDOR SEEMS CERTAINLY        

01:46:04.722 --> 01:46:08.256
PLANNED BRT ROUTE LIKE ON THE   
CORRIDOR SEEMS CERTAINLY        
RELEVANT I THINK WHEN WE'RE     

01:46:08.258 --> 01:46:11.826
CORRIDOR SEEMS CERTAINLY        
RELEVANT I THINK WHEN WE'RE     
CALLING IT CAPACITY TO ME THAT  

01:46:11.828 --> 01:46:15.431
RELEVANT I THINK WHEN WE'RE     
CALLING IT CAPACITY TO ME THAT  
MEANS LIKE WHAT'S POSSIBLE      

01:46:15.433 --> 01:46:16.231
CALLING IT CAPACITY TO ME THAT  
MEANS LIKE WHAT'S POSSIBLE      
BECAUSE I MEAN THERE AREN'T     

01:46:16.233 --> 01:46:18.867
MEANS LIKE WHAT'S POSSIBLE      
BECAUSE I MEAN THERE AREN'T     
NECESSARILY I DON'T WE'RE       

01:46:18.869 --> 01:46:19.534
BECAUSE I MEAN THERE AREN'T     
NECESSARILY I DON'T WE'RE       
SAYING THAT THERE ARE SEVEN     

01:46:19.536 --> 01:46:23.338
NECESSARILY I DON'T WE'RE       
SAYING THAT THERE ARE SEVEN     
HUNDRED AND FORTY CYCLISTS NOW  

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.206
SAYING THAT THERE ARE SEVEN     
HUNDRED AND FORTY CYCLISTS NOW  
AND THEN LIKE THE NINETEEN      

01:46:24.208 --> 01:46:24.940
HUNDRED AND FORTY CYCLISTS NOW  
AND THEN LIKE THE NINETEEN      
SEVENTY IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE.     

01:46:24.942 --> 01:46:27.509
AND THEN LIKE THE NINETEEN      
SEVENTY IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE.     
SO WITH TRANSIT I WOULD THINK   

01:46:27.511 --> 01:46:28.310
SEVENTY IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE.     
SO WITH TRANSIT I WOULD THINK   
AT LEAST WE WOULD SAY WHAT IF   

01:46:28.312 --> 01:46:31.247
SO WITH TRANSIT I WOULD THINK   
AT LEAST WE WOULD SAY WHAT IF   
THE BUSSES WERE FULL AND        

01:46:31.249 --> 01:46:32.114
AT LEAST WE WOULD SAY WHAT IF   
THE BUSSES WERE FULL AND        
ACTUALLY NO I THINK THIS IS     

01:46:32.116 --> 01:46:35.517
THE BUSSES WERE FULL AND        
ACTUALLY NO I THINK THIS IS     
ACTUALLY WITH THE BUSSES FOR OK 

01:46:35.519 --> 01:46:38.821
ACTUALLY NO I THINK THIS IS     
ACTUALLY WITH THE BUSSES FOR OK 
AND SO IT'S LIKE I THINK PEOPLE 

01:46:38.823 --> 01:46:39.654
ACTUALLY WITH THE BUSSES FOR OK 
AND SO IT'S LIKE I THINK PEOPLE 
FOR BUS STATION AND YOU KNOW    

01:46:39.656 --> 01:46:41.790
AND SO IT'S LIKE I THINK PEOPLE 
FOR BUS STATION AND YOU KNOW    
THERE'S SO MANY BUSSES PER HOUR 

01:46:41.792 --> 01:46:42.958
FOR BUS STATION AND YOU KNOW    
THERE'S SO MANY BUSSES PER HOUR 
SO OK AND SO IT'S LIKE FOR FOR  

01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:45.961
THERE'S SO MANY BUSSES PER HOUR 
SO OK AND SO IT'S LIKE FOR FOR  
THE ROADWAY YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT  

01:46:45.963 --> 01:46:46.728
SO OK AND SO IT'S LIKE FOR FOR  
THE ROADWAY YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT  
DESIGNING A TRANSIT SERVICE BUT 

01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:47.529
THE ROADWAY YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT  
DESIGNING A TRANSIT SERVICE BUT 
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT    

01:46:47.531 --> 01:46:50.966
DESIGNING A TRANSIT SERVICE BUT 
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT    
THERE'S A BRT WITH BIGGER       

01:46:50.968 --> 01:46:51.333
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT    
THERE'S A BRT WITH BIGGER       
VEHICLES.                       

01:46:51.335 --> 01:46:52.200
THERE'S A BRT WITH BIGGER       
VEHICLES.                       
YOU KNOW, WE COULD YOU WOULD    

01:46:52.202 --> 01:46:54.035

WHAT'S POSSIBLE.                
IT'S NOT IT'S YOU KNOW ONE      
PIECE OF THE STORY SO THAT HI   

01:47:04.848 --> 01:47:05.781
IT'S NOT IT'S YOU KNOW ONE      
PIECE OF THE STORY SO THAT HI

01:47:05.783 --> 01:47:09.551
PIECE OF THE STORY SO THAT HI   
LUCY MY NAME IS MATT CARPENTER. 
I'M A CEO OVER AT THE TRANSIT   

01:47:09.553 --> 01:47:09.885
LUCY MY NAME IS MATT CARPENTER. 
I'M A CEO OVER AT THE TRANSIT   
AUTHORITY.

AUTHORITY.                      
THE RIDE PERHAPS YOU'VE BEEN    
SPEAKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES BUT 

01:47:13.957 --> 01:47:17.126
THE RIDE PERHAPS YOU'VE BEEN    
SPEAKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES BUT 
YOU AND I HAVEN'T YET 60 PEOPLE 

01:47:17.128 --> 01:47:20.362
SPEAKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES BUT 
YOU AND I HAVEN'T YET 60 PEOPLE 
ON A BUS IS INCREDIBLY CROWDED  

01:47:20.364 --> 01:47:23.999
YOU AND I HAVEN'T YET 60 PEOPLE 
ON A BUS IS INCREDIBLY CROWDED  
BY THE WAY I HAD A METHOD, A    

01:47:24.001 --> 01:47:24.766
ON A BUS IS INCREDIBLY CROWDED  
BY THE WAY I HAD A METHOD, A    
LOGICAL QUESTION AND I'M NOT    

01:47:24.768 --> 01:47:28.737
BY THE WAY I HAD A METHOD, A    
LOGICAL QUESTION AND I'M NOT    
SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME BUT 

01:47:28.739 --> 01:47:29.438
LOGICAL QUESTION AND I'M NOT    
SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME BUT 
EVERYONE'S JUMPING IN AND       

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:30.171
SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME BUT 
EVERYONE'S JUMPING IN AND       
TRANSIT'S COME UP A COUPLE      

01:47:30.173 --> 01:47:30.505
EVERYONE'S JUMPING IN AND       
TRANSIT'S COME UP A COUPLE      
OF TIMES.

TRANSIT'S COME UP A COUPLE      
OF TIMES.                       
SO I HAD I HAD TO JUMP IN.      

01:47:32.476 --> 01:47:36.544
OF TIMES.                       
SO I HAD I HAD TO JUMP IN.      
MY QUESTION IS HOW IS THE STUDY 

01:47:36.546 --> 01:47:40.082
SO I HAD I HAD TO JUMP IN.      
MY QUESTION IS HOW IS THE STUDY 
AND HOW IS THE STUDY GOING TO   

01:47:40.084 --> 01:47:43.619
MY QUESTION IS HOW IS THE STUDY 
AND HOW IS THE STUDY GOING TO   
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE           

01:47:43.621 --> 01:47:44.353
AND HOW IS THE STUDY GOING TO   
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE           
CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF SLOWING    

01:47:44.355 --> 01:47:47.856
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE           
CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF SLOWING    
TRAFFIC ON BUS OPERATIONS?      

01:47:47.858 --> 01:47:51.726
CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF SLOWING    
TRAFFIC ON BUS OPERATIONS?      
AND WHAT I MEAN IS I APPRECIATE 

01:47:51.728 --> 01:47:52.560
TRAFFIC ON BUS OPERATIONS?      
AND WHAT I MEAN IS I APPRECIATE 
A MITIGATION POINT ABOUT BUS    

01:47:52.562 --> 01:47:55.096
AND WHAT I MEAN IS I APPRECIATE 
A MITIGATION POINT ABOUT BUS    
LANES IN CERTAIN PLACES BUT     

01:47:55.098 --> 01:47:56.131
A MITIGATION POINT ABOUT BUS    
LANES IN CERTAIN PLACES BUT     
MOST OF OUR BUSSES OPERATE IN   

01:47:56.133 --> 01:47:59.467
LANES IN CERTAIN PLACES BUT     
MOST OF OUR BUSSES OPERATE IN   
MIXED TRAFFIC AND AS THE

MOST OF OUR BUSSES OPERATE IN   
MIXED TRAFFIC AND AS THE        
TRAFFIC SLOWS DOWN, THE BUSSES  

01:48:03.507 --> 01:48:04.106
MIXED TRAFFIC AND AS THE        
TRAFFIC SLOWS DOWN, THE BUSSES  
WILL SLOW DOWN THE SLOWER       

01:48:04.108 --> 01:48:06.608
TRAFFIC SLOWS DOWN, THE BUSSES  
WILL SLOW DOWN THE SLOWER       
TRAFFIC, SLOWER BUSSES, THE     

01:48:06.610 --> 01:48:12.915
WILL SLOW DOWN THE SLOWER       
TRAFFIC, SLOWER BUSSES, THE     
LESS ATTRACTIVE SERVICE

>> SO MY QUESTION IS            
METHODOLOGICALLY WITH THE STUDY 
ARE BUSSES JUST GOING TO BE     

01:49:20.984 --> 01:49:24.085
METHODOLOGICALLY WITH THE STUDY 
ARE BUSSES JUST GOING TO BE     
TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER VEHICLE  

01:49:24.087 --> 01:49:25.120
ARE BUSSES JUST GOING TO BE     
TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER VEHICLE  
AND IF THEY GET SLOWED DOWN TOO 

01:49:25.122 --> 01:49:28.223
TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER VEHICLE  
AND IF THEY GET SLOWED DOWN TOO 
BAD IT'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE OR   

01:49:28.225 --> 01:49:32.094
AND IF THEY GET SLOWED DOWN TOO 
BAD IT'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE OR   
ARE BUSSES SOMEHOW ACKNOWLEDGE  

01:49:32.096 --> 01:49:33.028
BAD IT'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE OR   
ARE BUSSES SOMEHOW ACKNOWLEDGE

UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A THERE 
NOT A REGULAR VEHICLE?

>> THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT  
GOING ON HERE.                  
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'D 

01:49:47.344 --> 01:49:48.443
GOING ON HERE.                  
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'D 
SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THE TRANSIT 

01:49:48.445 --> 01:49:49.310
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'D 
SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THE TRANSIT 
SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE REALLY    

01:49:49.312 --> 01:49:51.780
SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THE TRANSIT 
SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE REALLY    
FRONT AND CENTER OF THINKING

ABOUT WHAT ARE THE RIGHT FUTURE 
CROSS SECTION.                  
SO AND I THINK SOME OF THE      

01:49:56.887 --> 01:49:59.488
CROSS SECTION.                  
SO AND I THINK SOME OF THE      
CORRIDORS WHERE THERE'S BRT     

01:49:59.490 --> 01:50:00.355
SO AND I THINK SOME OF THE      
CORRIDORS WHERE THERE'S BRT     
PLANS WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT    

01:50:00.357 --> 01:50:03.191
CORRIDORS WHERE THERE'S BRT     
PLANS WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT    
EXCLUSIVE BUS LANES JUST BEING

PLANS WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT    
EXCLUSIVE BUS LANES JUST BEING  
SOMETHING THAT WE'D WANT TO     

01:50:03.994 --> 01:50:04.325
EXCLUSIVE BUS LANES JUST BEING  
SOMETHING THAT WE'D WANT TO     
CONSIDER.                       

01:50:04.327 --> 01:50:07.929
SOMETHING THAT WE'D WANT TO     
CONSIDER.                       
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE AND WE 

01:50:07.931 --> 01:50:08.596
CONSIDER.                       
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE AND WE 
HAVE AND AGAIN REVIEWED YOU     

01:50:08.598 --> 01:50:12.000
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE AND WE 
HAVE AND AGAIN REVIEWED YOU     
KNOW, WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE   

01:50:12.002 --> 01:50:12.767
HAVE AND AGAIN REVIEWED YOU     
KNOW, WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE   
TO MEET AND DOWNLOAD DETAIL BUT 

01:50:12.769 --> 01:50:15.270
KNOW, WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE   
TO MEET AND DOWNLOAD DETAIL BUT 
I THINK WE'D WANT TO KNOW WHERE 

01:50:15.272 --> 01:50:18.306
TO MEET AND DOWNLOAD DETAIL BUT 
I THINK WE'D WANT TO KNOW WHERE 
OUR TRANSIT DELAYS MOST         

01:50:18.308 --> 01:50:19.041
I THINK WE'D WANT TO KNOW WHERE 
OUR TRANSIT DELAYS MOST         
PREVALENT AND HAVE THAT         

01:50:19.043 --> 01:50:22.244
OUR TRANSIT DELAYS MOST         
PREVALENT AND HAVE THAT         
FACTORED INTO THIS AS WELL AND  

01:50:22.246 --> 01:50:23.178
PREVALENT AND HAVE THAT         
FACTORED INTO THIS AS WELL AND  
THEN ARE THERE SOLUTIONS THAT   

01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:29.218
FACTORED INTO THIS AS WELL AND  
THEN ARE THERE SOLUTIONS THAT   
COULD BE A MITIGATION TO THAT   

01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:30.085
THEN ARE THERE SOLUTIONS THAT   
COULD BE A MITIGATION TO THAT   
SLOWING DOWN TRANSPORT ROUTES   

01:50:30.087 --> 01:50:34.689
COULD BE A MITIGATION TO THAT   
SLOWING DOWN TRANSPORT ROUTES   
BY THINGS LIKE QUEUE JUMP LANES 

01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:37.859
SLOWING DOWN TRANSPORT ROUTES   
BY THINGS LIKE QUEUE JUMP LANES 
OR YOU KNOW, THAT ALLOW TO GET  

01:50:37.861 --> 01:50:38.593
BY THINGS LIKE QUEUE JUMP LANES 
OR YOU KNOW, THAT ALLOW TO GET  
THE SAFETY BENEFIT IN ADDITION  

01:50:38.595 --> 01:50:41.763
OR YOU KNOW, THAT ALLOW TO GET  
THE SAFETY BENEFIT IN ADDITION  
TO NOT PENALIZING TRANSIT       

01:50:41.765 --> 01:50:42.564
THE SAFETY BENEFIT IN ADDITION

IS AN EVALUATION OF TRADEOFFS   

01:50:50.908 --> 01:50:52.807
CONSIDERED SO AND A LOT OF THIS 
IS AN EVALUATION OF TRADEOFFS   
THAT YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING

IS AN EVALUATION OF TRADEOFFS   
THAT YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING  
TO BE CALCULATING A PASS OR     

01:50:53.844 --> 01:50:56.612
THAT YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING

OF RECONFIGURING CURVES THIS    
WILL MAKE THINGS MUCH MORE      
DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT QUICKLY  

01:54:34.465 --> 01:54:38.233
WILL MAKE THINGS MUCH MORE      
DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT QUICKLY  
AND A LOT OF CALL OUTS FROM     

01:54:38.235 --> 01:54:41.570
DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT QUICKLY  
AND A LOT OF CALL OUTS FROM     
NOTES AND THINGS TO STILL NEED  

01:54:41.572 --> 01:54:42.371
AND A LOT OF CALL OUTS FROM     
NOTES AND THINGS TO STILL NEED  
TO BE RESOLVED BUT BASICALLY    

01:54:42.373 --> 01:54:45.840
NOTES AND THINGS TO STILL NEED  
TO BE RESOLVED BUT BASICALLY    
CONVEY THE CONCEPT SO THAT THEN 

01:54:45.842 --> 01:54:46.541
TO BE RESOLVED BUT BASICALLY    
CONVEY THE CONCEPT SO THAT THEN 
IT COULD GO FURTHER THROUGH THE 

01:54:46.543 --> 01:54:49.944
CONVEY THE CONCEPT SO THAT THEN 
IT COULD GO FURTHER THROUGH THE 
DESIGN PROCESS AND THIS WILL BE 

01:54:49.946 --> 01:54:50.278
IT COULD GO FURTHER THROUGH THE 
DESIGN PROCESS AND THIS WILL BE 
DONE.                           

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.947
DESIGN PROCESS AND THIS WILL BE 
DONE.                           
WHAT WE EXPECT WILL BE KEY      

01:54:52.949 --> 01:54:53.682
DONE.                           
WHAT WE EXPECT WILL BE KEY      
INTERSECTIONS ON EACH OF THESE  

01:54:53.684 --> 01:54:54.549
WHAT WE EXPECT WILL BE KEY      
INTERSECTIONS ON EACH OF THESE  
CORRIDORS THAT REALLY DO NEED   

01:54:54.551 --> 01:54:57.118
INTERSECTIONS ON EACH OF THESE  
CORRIDORS THAT REALLY DO NEED   
TO BE FIGURED OUT AND THEN YOU  

01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:57.652
CORRIDORS THAT REALLY DO NEED   
TO BE FIGURED OUT AND THEN YOU  
KNOW, THIS MIGHT MIGHT          

01:54:57.654 --> 01:55:00.588
TO BE FIGURED OUT AND THEN YOU  
KNOW, THIS MIGHT MIGHT          
HIGHLIGHT FURTHER FURTHER       

01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:01.122
KNOW, THIS MIGHT MIGHT          
HIGHLIGHT FURTHER FURTHER       
CHANGES TO DESIGN.              

01:55:01.124 --> 01:55:05.093
HIGHLIGHT FURTHER FURTHER       
CHANGES TO DESIGN.              
MAYBE THERE'S A QUEUE JUMP LANE 

01:55:05.095 --> 01:55:05.761
CHANGES TO DESIGN.              
MAYBE THERE'S A QUEUE JUMP LANE 
OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT COULD  

01:55:05.763 --> 01:55:06.495
MAYBE THERE'S A QUEUE JUMP LANE 
OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT COULD  
BE BROUGHT INTO THE FOLD AT     

01:55:06.497 --> 01:55:12.100
OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT COULD  
BE BROUGHT INTO THE FOLD AT     
THIS POINT SO THAT SET FOR OUR  

01:55:12.102 --> 01:55:12.900
BE BROUGHT INTO THE FOLD AT     
THIS POINT SO THAT SET FOR OUR  
METHODOLOGY CAN WE'LL GO BACK

THAT STOOD OUT TO ME WITH THE   

01:56:48.732 --> 01:56:49.464
I REALLY APPRECIATE ONE THING   
THAT STOOD OUT TO ME WITH THE   
RECONFIGURATION DIAGRAMS WE     

01:56:49.466 --> 01:56:53.001
THAT STOOD OUT TO ME WITH THE   
RECONFIGURATION DIAGRAMS WE     
WERE VISITING PARIS PRETTY      

01:56:53.003 --> 01:56:56.737
RECONFIGURATION DIAGRAMS WE     
WERE VISITING PARIS PRETTY      
RECENTLY LAST YEAR AND I        

01:56:56.739 --> 01:56:57.706
WERE VISITING PARIS PRETTY      
RECENTLY LAST YEAR AND I        
NOTICED A LOT OF THE TRANSIT    

01:56:57.708 --> 01:56:58.306
RECENTLY LAST YEAR AND I        
NOTICED A LOT OF THE TRANSIT    
LANES THEY HAD WERE DUAL        

01:56:58.308 --> 01:57:01.642
NOTICED A LOT OF THE TRANSIT    
LANES THEY HAD WERE DUAL        
PURPOSE RAPID TRANSIT AND BIKE  

01:57:01.644 --> 01:57:04.879
LANES THEY HAD WERE DUAL        
PURPOSE RAPID TRANSIT AND BIKE  
LANES.                          

01:57:04.881 --> 01:57:06.014
PURPOSE RAPID TRANSIT AND BIKE  
LANES.                          
SO A LOT OF THE DIAGRAMS YOU    

01:57:06.016 --> 01:57:06.814
LANES.                          
SO A LOT OF THE DIAGRAMS YOU    
SHOWED SEEMED LIKE THEY WOULD   

01:57:06.816 --> 01:57:09.750
SO A LOT OF THE DIAGRAMS YOU    
SHOWED SEEMED LIKE THEY WOULD   
BE WIDE ENOUGH TO FIT A BUS IN  

01:57:09.752 --> 01:57:12.286
SHOWED SEEMED LIKE THEY WOULD   
BE WIDE ENOUGH TO FIT A BUS IN  
THE BIKE LANE IF YOU NARROWED   

01:57:12.288 --> 01:57:13.221
BE WIDE ENOUGH TO FIT A BUS IN  
THE BIKE LANE IF YOU NARROWED   
THE BUFFER A LITTLE BIT AND     

01:57:13.223 --> 01:57:16.525
THE BIKE LANE IF YOU NARROWED   
THE BUFFER A LITTLE BIT AND     
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN 

01:57:16.527 --> 01:57:17.125
THE BUFFER A LITTLE BIT AND     
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN 
OVERSEAS A FEW TIMES.           

01:57:17.127 --> 01:57:17.992
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN 
OVERSEAS A FEW TIMES.           
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING  

01:57:17.994 --> 01:57:20.595
OVERSEAS A FEW TIMES.           
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING  
THAT'S JUST NOT DONE IN THE     

01:57:20.597 --> 01:57:21.329
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING  
THAT'S JUST NOT DONE IN THE     
UNITED STATES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE 

01:57:21.331 --> 01:57:24.266
THAT'S JUST NOT DONE IN THE     
UNITED STATES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE 
IT COULD ADDRESS MAT'S CONCERNS 

01:57:24.268 --> 01:57:27.969
UNITED STATES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE 
IT COULD ADDRESS MAT'S CONCERNS 
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, GETTING STUCK  

01:57:27.971 --> 01:57:28.770
IT COULD ADDRESS MAT'S CONCERNS 
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, GETTING STUCK  
IN TRAFFIC GIVEN THE BUSSES     

01:57:28.772 --> 01:57:29.637
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, GETTING STUCK  
IN TRAFFIC GIVEN THE BUSSES     
ONLY COME EVERY 15 TO 30        

01:57:29.639 --> 01:57:32.907
IN TRAFFIC GIVEN THE BUSSES     
ONLY COME EVERY 15 TO 30        
MINUTES AND WE HAVE A LOT       

01:57:32.909 --> 01:57:35.410
ONLY COME EVERY 15 TO 30        
MINUTES AND WE HAVE A LOT       
OF BUS BIKE LANES AND BASTION   

01:57:35.412 --> 01:57:36.344
MINUTES AND WE HAVE A LOT       
OF BUS BIKE LANES AND BASTION   
WHERE I DO A LOT OF WORK AND    

01:57:36.346 --> 01:57:37.012
OF BUS BIKE LANES AND BASTION   
WHERE I DO A LOT OF WORK AND    
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING     

01:57:37.014 --> 01:57:39.747
WHERE I DO A LOT OF WORK AND    
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING     
THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS IDEAL FOR  

01:57:39.749 --> 01:57:40.748
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING     
THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS IDEAL FOR  
THE BUS JUST WANT TO PROBABLY   

01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:43.818
THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS IDEAL FOR  
THE BUS JUST WANT TO PROBABLY   
GO FASTER THAN A TYPICAL BIKE   

01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:47.322
THE BUS JUST WANT TO PROBABLY   
GO FASTER THAN A TYPICAL BIKE   
RIDER WHICH IS MAYBE MOVING AT  

01:57:47.324 --> 01:57:47.923
GO FASTER THAN A TYPICAL BIKE   
RIDER WHICH IS MAYBE MOVING AT  
TWELVE MILES AN HOUR.           

01:57:47.925 --> 01:57:48.723
RIDER WHICH IS MAYBE MOVING AT  
TWELVE MILES AN HOUR.           
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU      

01:57:48.725 --> 01:57:51.792
TWELVE MILES AN HOUR.           
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU      
KNOW, WE DO IT WHERE THAT'S THE 

01:57:51.794 --> 01:57:52.527
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU      
KNOW, WE DO IT WHERE THAT'S THE 
OPTIMAL SOLUTION AND AGAIN IT'S 

01:57:52.529 --> 01:57:54.329
KNOW, WE DO IT WHERE THAT'S THE 
OPTIMAL SOLUTION AND AGAIN IT'S 
BALANCING TRADE OFFS TRADE OFFS 

01:57:54.331 --> 01:57:55.230
OPTIMAL SOLUTION AND AGAIN IT'S 
BALANCING TRADE OFFS TRADE OFFS 
AND CERTAINLY AT BUS MOVING AT  

01:57:55.232 --> 01:57:58.833
BALANCING TRADE OFFS TRADE OFFS 
AND CERTAINLY AT BUS MOVING AT  
12 OR 15 MILES AN HOUR IS       

01:57:58.835 --> 01:57:59.501
AND CERTAINLY AT BUS MOVING AT  
12 OR 15 MILES AN HOUR IS       
BETTER THAN BEING STUCK IN      

01:57:59.503 --> 01:58:01.436
12 OR 15 MILES AN HOUR IS       
BETTER THAN BEING STUCK IN      
TRAFFIC BUT IT'S DEFINITELY     

01:58:01.438 --> 01:58:02.303
BETTER THAN BEING STUCK IN      
TRAFFIC BUT IT'S DEFINITELY     
THAT WOULD BE IN THE MIX        

01:58:02.305 --> 01:58:08.610
TRAFFIC BUT IT'S DEFINITELY     
THAT WOULD BE IN THE MIX        
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER           

01:58:09.078 --> 01:58:12.747
                      ANY OTHER 
QUESTIONS?                      
NOT ONE TO THINK LUCY AGAIN.    

01:58:12.749 --> 01:58:13.348
QUESTIONS?                      
NOT ONE TO THINK LUCY AGAIN.    
>> OH YEAH.

SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FEET         
OF RETAIL.

02:21:59.574 --> 02:22:00.474

BECAUSE I THINK THEY ONLY HAVE  
ONE POINT TWO SPACES PER UNIT

BECAUSE I THINK THEY ONLY HAVE  
ONE POINT TWO SPACES PER UNIT
