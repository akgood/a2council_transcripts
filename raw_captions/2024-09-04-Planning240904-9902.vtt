00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.894
AND SO THIS OBVIOUSLY MAKES IT  
SO NO PARKING IS GOING TO BE    
ALLOWED TO BE SPACE FOR         

00:10:48.896 --> 00:10:49.562
SO NO PARKING IS GOING TO BE    
ALLOWED TO BE SPACE FOR         
ADDITIONAL PARKING ON THE SITE. 

00:10:49.564 --> 00:10:52.398
ALLOWED TO BE SPACE FOR         
ADDITIONAL PARKING ON THE SITE. 
SO THAT WAS THE BIGGEST         

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:52.699
ADDITIONAL PARKING ON THE SITE. 
SO THAT WAS THE BIGGEST         
CHALLENGE.                      

00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:53.732
SO THAT WAS THE BIGGEST         
CHALLENGE.                      
WE MANAGED TO FIGURE IT OUT AND 

00:10:53.734 --> 00:10:54.700
CHALLENGE.                      
WE MANAGED TO FIGURE IT OUT AND 
GET IT ALL APPROVED AND THEN WE 

00:10:54.702 --> 00:10:59.371
WE MANAGED TO FIGURE IT OUT AND 
GET IT ALL APPROVED AND THEN WE 
ALSO ADDED THE FOURTEEN SPACES  

00:10:59.373 --> 00:11:00.473
GET IT ALL APPROVED AND THEN WE 
ALSO ADDED THE FOURTEEN SPACES  
YOU CAN SEE ON THE SITE PLAN    

00:11:00.475 --> 00:11:03.342
ALSO ADDED THE FOURTEEN SPACES  
YOU CAN SEE ON THE SITE PLAN    
HERE WE HAVE THE NEW SEVEN NEW  

00:11:03.344 --> 00:11:04.444
YOU CAN SEE ON THE SITE PLAN    
HERE WE HAVE THE NEW SEVEN NEW  
BIKE SPACES SPACES WHICH IS THE 

00:11:04.446 --> 00:11:07.746
HERE WE HAVE THE NEW SEVEN NEW  
BIKE SPACES SPACES WHICH IS THE 
COVERED PORTION AND WE ALSO     

00:11:07.748 --> 00:11:08.547
BIKE SPACES SPACES WHICH IS THE 
COVERED PORTION AND WE ALSO     
PROVIDED SEVEN MORE INTERNALLY  

00:11:08.549 --> 00:11:11.484
COVERED PORTION AND WE ALSO     
PROVIDED SEVEN MORE INTERNALLY  
WHICH WILL BE IN THE BASEMENT.  

00:11:11.486 --> 00:11:12.652
PROVIDED SEVEN MORE INTERNALLY  
WHICH WILL BE IN THE BASEMENT.  
I'LL SHOW YOU THAT ON THE PLAN  

00:11:12.654 --> 00:11:13.118
WHICH WILL BE IN THE BASEMENT.  
I'LL SHOW YOU THAT ON THE PLAN  
IN A MINUTE.                    

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.887
I'LL SHOW YOU THAT ON THE PLAN  
IN A MINUTE.                    
SO THE SITE PLAN WAS A LITTLE   

00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:15.821
IN A MINUTE.                    
SO THE SITE PLAN WAS A LITTLE   
BIT OF A CHALLENGE IN THAT AREA 

00:11:15.823 --> 00:11:18.691
SO THE SITE PLAN WAS A LITTLE   
BIT OF A CHALLENGE IN THAT AREA 
BUT NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT     

00:11:18.693 --> 00:11:19.925
BIT OF A CHALLENGE IN THAT AREA 
BUT NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT     
THAN WHAT IT IS TODAY AND THIS  

00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:23.296
BUT NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT     
THAN WHAT IT IS TODAY AND THIS  
IS THE MAIN FLOOR PLAN.         

00:11:23.298 --> 00:11:24.330
THAN WHAT IT IS TODAY AND THIS  
IS THE MAIN FLOOR PLAN.         
YOU CAN KIND OF JUST SEE THAT   

00:11:24.332 --> 00:11:26.966
IS THE MAIN FLOOR PLAN.         
YOU CAN KIND OF JUST SEE THAT   
THOSE SEVEN PARKING SPACES      

00:11:26.968 --> 00:11:27.700
YOU CAN KIND OF JUST SEE THAT   
THOSE SEVEN PARKING SPACES      
WHERE WE'RE TALKING THEM IN     

00:11:27.702 --> 00:11:30.403
THOSE SEVEN PARKING SPACES      
WHERE WE'RE TALKING THEM IN     
THERE AND WE'RE THERE YOU CAN   

00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:33.739
WHERE WE'RE TALKING THEM IN     
THERE AND WE'RE THERE YOU CAN   
SEE THE EIGHT DOTS THERE ON THE 

00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:34.140
THERE AND WE'RE THERE YOU CAN   
SEE THE EIGHT DOTS THERE ON THE 
BACKSIDE THERE.                 

00:11:34.142 --> 00:11:35.341
SEE THE EIGHT DOTS THERE ON THE 
BACKSIDE THERE.                 
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A DO I HAVE 

00:11:35.343 --> 00:11:35.875
BACKSIDE THERE.                 
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A DO I HAVE 
A POINTER ON THIS?              

00:11:35.877 --> 00:11:38.410
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A DO I HAVE 
A POINTER ON THIS?              
I DON'T KNOW IF I OK, I GUESS I 

00:11:38.412 --> 00:11:38.911
A POINTER ON THIS?              
I DON'T KNOW IF I OK, I GUESS I 
DON'T NEED ONE.                 

00:11:38.913 --> 00:11:39.712
I DON'T KNOW IF I OK, I GUESS I 
DON'T NEED ONE.                 
YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHAT I'M    

00:11:39.714 --> 00:11:40.313
DON'T NEED ONE.                 
YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHAT I'M    
TALKING ABOUT THERE.            

00:11:40.315 --> 00:11:42.648
YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHAT I'M    
TALKING ABOUT THERE.            
I AND THEN THIS IS THE BASEMENT 

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.751
TALKING ABOUT THERE.            
I AND THEN THIS IS THE BASEMENT 
PLAN THAT SHOWS WHERE WE USED A 

00:11:45.753 --> 00:11:46.052
I AND THEN THIS IS THE BASEMENT 
PLAN THAT SHOWS WHERE WE USED A 
CLOSET.                         

00:11:46.054 --> 00:11:47.186
PLAN THAT SHOWS WHERE WE USED A 
CLOSET.                         
THOSE ANGLED THINGS ARE AT THE  

00:11:47.188 --> 00:11:50.022
CLOSET.                         
THOSE ANGLED THINGS ARE AT THE  
TOP OF BICYCLE'S.               

00:11:50.024 --> 00:11:51.090
THOSE ANGLED THINGS ARE AT THE  
TOP OF BICYCLE'S.               
WE USE AN INTERNAL CLOSET TO    

00:11:51.092 --> 00:11:53.826
TOP OF BICYCLE'S.               
WE USE AN INTERNAL CLOSET TO    
GET THE SEVEN INTERIOR PARKING  

00:11:53.828 --> 00:11:54.694
WE USE AN INTERNAL CLOSET TO    
GET THE SEVEN INTERIOR PARKING  
REQUIREMENT AND YOU COME RIGHT  

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:57.930
GET THE SEVEN INTERIOR PARKING  
REQUIREMENT AND YOU COME RIGHT  
DOWN A STAIR FROM THE OUTSIDE.  

00:11:57.932 --> 00:11:58.998
REQUIREMENT AND YOU COME RIGHT  
DOWN A STAIR FROM THE OUTSIDE.  
IT'S JUST A HALF A FLIGHT       

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.465
DOWN A STAIR FROM THE OUTSIDE.  
IT'S JUST A HALF A FLIGHT       
OF STAIRS.                      

00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:00.066
IT'S JUST A HALF A FLIGHT       
OF STAIRS.                      
IT GOES RIGHT DOWN INTO THE

OF STAIRS.                      
IT GOES RIGHT DOWN INTO THE     
BASEMENT SO WORKS OUT QUITE     

00:12:02.204 --> 00:12:02.601
IT GOES RIGHT DOWN INTO THE     
BASEMENT SO WORKS OUT QUITE     
NICELY.                         

00:12:02.603 --> 00:12:03.336
BASEMENT SO WORKS OUT QUITE     
NICELY.                         
THAT'S CLOSET REALLY WASN'T     

00:12:03.338 --> 00:12:04.336
NICELY.                         
THAT'S CLOSET REALLY WASN'T     
BEING USED FOR ANYTHING

THAT'S CLOSET REALLY WASN'T     
BEING USED FOR ANYTHING

00:12:09.377 --> 00:12:10.043
CURRENTLY JUST TO SHOW YOU A    
LITTLE BIT INTERNALLY.          
SO THIS IS THE EXISTING FIRST   

00:12:10.045 --> 00:12:12.045
LITTLE BIT INTERNALLY.          
SO THIS IS THE EXISTING FIRST   
FLOOR PLAN.                     

00:12:12.047 --> 00:12:13.045
SO THIS IS THE EXISTING FIRST   
FLOOR PLAN.                     
YOU CAN SEE ALL THOSE LARGE     

00:12:13.047 --> 00:12:16.315
FLOOR PLAN.                     
YOU CAN SEE ALL THOSE LARGE     
STUDY ROOMS SO PRETTY BIG THEN  

00:12:16.317 --> 00:12:16.983
YOU CAN SEE ALL THOSE LARGE     
STUDY ROOMS SO PRETTY BIG THEN  
I'M REALLY NOT BEING UTILIZED   

00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:17.917
STUDY ROOMS SO PRETTY BIG THEN  
I'M REALLY NOT BEING UTILIZED   
FOR MUCH AND THEN THIS WOULD BE 

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:20.319
I'M REALLY NOT BEING UTILIZED   
FOR MUCH AND THEN THIS WOULD BE 
THE REVISION OF THAT WHERE      

00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:21.053
FOR MUCH AND THEN THIS WOULD BE 
THE REVISION OF THAT WHERE      
WE'RE TAKING THOSE STUDY ROOMS  

00:12:21.055 --> 00:12:23.122
THE REVISION OF THAT WHERE      
WE'RE TAKING THOSE STUDY ROOMS  
AND ADDING THE ADDITIONAL BEDS, 

00:12:23.124 --> 00:12:24.056
WE'RE TAKING THOSE STUDY ROOMS  
AND ADDING THE ADDITIONAL BEDS, 
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THEM AND     

00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:27.260
AND ADDING THE ADDITIONAL BEDS, 
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THEM AND     
THEN ALSO ON THE THIRD FLOOR,

PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THEM AND     
THEN ALSO ON THE THIRD FLOOR,   
SAME KIND OF THING YOU CAN SEE  

00:12:28.262 --> 00:12:31.297

SAME KIND OF THING YOU CAN SEE  
THE EXISTING PLAN WITH THE      

00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:32.064
SAME KIND OF THING YOU CAN SEE  
THE EXISTING PLAN WITH THE      
LARGER STUDY SPACES THAT AREN'T 

00:12:32.066 --> 00:12:34.934
THE EXISTING PLAN WITH THE      
LARGER STUDY SPACES THAT AREN'T 
REALLY BEING UTILIZED AND THEN  

00:12:34.936 --> 00:12:35.801
LARGER STUDY SPACES THAT AREN'T 
REALLY BEING UTILIZED AND THEN  
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE         

00:12:35.803 --> 00:12:36.602
REALLY BEING UTILIZED AND THEN  
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE         
REVISION WHERE WE ADDED ALL THE 

00:12:36.604 --> 00:12:39.105
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE         
REVISION WHERE WE ADDED ALL THE 
BEDS AND REVISED THINGS

REVISION WHERE WE ADDED ALL THE 
BEDS AND REVISED THINGS         
SOMEWHAT TO GET ALL THOSE BEDS  

00:12:40.174 --> 00:12:41.774
BEDS AND REVISED THINGS

STUFF WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO   
TALK ABOUT THAT MUCH.           

00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:51.317
STUFF WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO   
TALK ABOUT THAT MUCH.           
I THOUGHT I'D THROW IN A FEW    

00:12:51.319 --> 00:12:51.918
TALK ABOUT THAT MUCH.           
I THOUGHT I'D THROW IN A FEW    
PICTURES OF THE INTERIOR.       

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.886
I THOUGHT I'D THROW IN A FEW    
PICTURES OF THE INTERIOR.       
IT'S A VERY NICE A LOT          

00:12:53.888 --> 00:12:54.587
PICTURES OF THE INTERIOR.       
IT'S A VERY NICE A LOT          
OF WOODWORK HISTORIC BUILDING   

00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:57.523
IT'S A VERY NICE A LOT          
OF WOODWORK HISTORIC BUILDING   
STILL LOOKS PRETTY GOOD EVEN    

00:12:57.525 --> 00:12:58.424
OF WOODWORK HISTORIC BUILDING   
STILL LOOKS PRETTY GOOD EVEN

WITH ALL THE PARTIES THAT GO ON 
THERE.                          
THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT

THERE.                          
THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT     
OF TOUCH UP NEEDED EVERY YEAR   

00:13:02.864 --> 00:13:05.331
THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT     
OF TOUCH UP NEEDED EVERY YEAR   
BUT I COULD SEE THERE'S A LOT   

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:05.965

THE LEFT IS THE WAY I LOOKED AT 
THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER.    

00:13:17.912 --> 00:13:20.746
THE LEFT IS THE WAY I LOOKED AT 
THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER.    
THE FRONT PORCH IT WAS GETTING  

00:13:20.748 --> 00:13:21.447
THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER.    
THE FRONT PORCH IT WAS GETTING  
A LITTLE DETERIORATED AND SO    

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:24.283
THE FRONT PORCH IT WAS GETTING  
A LITTLE DETERIORATED AND SO    
AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS THE  

00:13:24.285 --> 00:13:27.419
A LITTLE DETERIORATED AND SO    
AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS THE  
SLIDE ON THE RIGHT WHERE WE HAD 

00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:28.287
AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS THE  
SLIDE ON THE RIGHT WHERE WE HAD 
A NICE PORCH AND PATIO AND      

00:13:28.289 --> 00:13:31.223
SLIDE ON THE RIGHT WHERE WE HAD 
A NICE PORCH AND PATIO AND      
REALLY I THINK COMPLIMENTS      

00:13:31.225 --> 00:13:31.890
A NICE PORCH AND PATIO AND      
REALLY I THINK COMPLIMENTS      
OF BUILDING NEW LANDSCAPE.      

00:13:31.892 --> 00:13:35.394
REALLY I THINK COMPLIMENTS      
OF BUILDING NEW LANDSCAPE.      
IT REALLY LOOKS A LOT BETTER    

00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:35.894
OF BUILDING NEW LANDSCAPE.      
IT REALLY LOOKS A LOT BETTER    
THAN IT WAS.                    

00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:36.729
IT REALLY LOOKS A LOT BETTER    
THAN IT WAS.

00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:37.530
THAN IT WAS.                    
SO THERE'S A LOT                
OF IMPROVEMENTS MADE NOW THESE  

00:13:37.532 --> 00:13:40.032
SO THERE'S A LOT                
OF IMPROVEMENTS MADE NOW THESE  
PICTURES OF THE AREAS I THE     

00:13:40.034 --> 00:13:40.899
OF IMPROVEMENTS MADE NOW THESE  
PICTURES OF THE AREAS I THE     
BACK, THERE'S KIND OF A LOT     

00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:41.401
PICTURES OF THE AREAS I THE     
BACK, THERE'S KIND OF A LOT     
OF JUNK SHOWN THERE.            

00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:43.068
BACK, THERE'S KIND OF A LOT     
OF JUNK SHOWN THERE.            
BUT THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS THE

YES.                            
SO HERE'S THE HERE'S MAYBE THIS 

00:21:29.337 --> 00:21:32.838
YES.                            
SO HERE'S THE HERE'S MAYBE THIS 
IS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION BASED 

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.672
SO HERE'S THE HERE'S MAYBE THIS 
IS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION BASED 
ON THAT AND AT LEAST WHAT I CAN 

00:21:33.674 --> 00:21:36.675
IS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION BASED 
ON THAT AND AT LEAST WHAT I CAN 
FIND FROM THE TAX RECORDS THE   

00:21:36.677 --> 00:21:37.443
ON THAT AND AT LEAST WHAT I CAN 
FIND FROM THE TAX RECORDS THE   
SLIGHT IS POINT FOUR ACRES IS   

00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:39.845
FIND FROM THE TAX RECORDS THE   
SLIGHT IS POINT FOUR ACRES IS   
THAT SAME RATE I AND GOOGLE     

00:21:39.847 --> 00:21:40.513
SLIGHT IS POINT FOUR ACRES IS   
THAT SAME RATE I AND GOOGLE     
TELLS ME THAT THAT SEVENTEEN    

00:21:40.515 --> 00:21:44.383
THAT SAME RATE I AND GOOGLE     
TELLS ME THAT THAT SEVENTEEN    
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET ISH AND SO 

00:21:44.385 --> 00:21:45.417
TELLS ME THAT THAT SEVENTEEN    
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET ISH AND SO 
THE MAX BY ZONING WOULD BE      

00:21:45.419 --> 00:21:48.353
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET ISH AND SO 
THE MAX BY ZONING WOULD BE      
FORTY NINE OCCUPANTS.           

00:21:48.355 --> 00:21:49.021
THE MAX BY ZONING WOULD BE      
FORTY NINE OCCUPANTS.           
I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE            

00:21:49.023 --> 00:21:52.024
FORTY NINE OCCUPANTS.           
I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE            
IMPLICATION IS IF WE ALLOW A    

00:21:52.026 --> 00:21:52.757
I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE            
IMPLICATION IS IF WE ALLOW A    
SPECIAL LAND USE A GUIDE NOT    

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:55.394
IMPLICATION IS IF WE ALLOW A    
SPECIAL LAND USE A GUIDE NOT    
THE SITE PLAN BECAUSE FLIGHT    

00:21:55.396 --> 00:21:56.261
SPECIAL LAND USE A GUIDE NOT    
THE SITE PLAN BECAUSE FLIGHT    
PLAN IS ONLY FOR THEIR TWENTY   

00:21:56.263 --> 00:21:56.929
THE SITE PLAN BECAUSE FLIGHT    
PLAN IS ONLY FOR THEIR TWENTY   
EIGHT BUT ALLOW THE SPECIAL     

00:21:56.931 --> 00:21:59.932
PLAN IS ONLY FOR THEIR TWENTY   
EIGHT BUT ALLOW THE SPECIAL     
LAND USE TO GO UP TO FORTY NINE 

00:21:59.934 --> 00:22:00.866
EIGHT BUT ALLOW THE SPECIAL     
LAND USE TO GO UP TO FORTY NINE 
IF THEY WANT TO CHANGE INTERIOR 

00:22:00.868 --> 00:22:03.869
LAND USE TO GO UP TO FORTY NINE 
IF THEY WANT TO CHANGE INTERIOR 
AGAIN PRESUMABLY THAT GOES      

00:22:03.871 --> 00:22:04.270
IF THEY WANT TO CHANGE INTERIOR 
AGAIN PRESUMABLY THAT GOES      
THROUGH.                        

00:22:04.272 --> 00:22:05.036
AGAIN PRESUMABLY THAT GOES      
THROUGH.                        
SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE    

00:22:05.038 --> 00:22:07.973
THROUGH.                        
SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE    
IMPLICATION WOULD BE TO ALLOW   

00:22:07.975 --> 00:22:08.707
SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE    
IMPLICATION WOULD BE TO ALLOW   
THEM THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THE    

00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:11.644
IMPLICATION WOULD BE TO ALLOW   
THEM THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THE    
FUTURE SO THEY CAN DO WHATEVER  

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:12.511
THEM THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THE    
FUTURE SO THEY CAN DO WHATEVER  
THEY NEED TO WITH BUILDING BUT  

00:22:12.513 --> 00:22:13.178
FUTURE SO THEY CAN DO WHATEVER  
THEY NEED TO WITH BUILDING BUT  
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO  

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.780
THEY NEED TO WITH BUILDING BUT  
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO  
COME BACK TO THE PLANNING.      

00:22:15.782 --> 00:22:16.815
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO  
COME BACK TO THE PLANNING.      
YES THAT CAN BE DONE AND HAS

00:22:19.486 --> 00:22:20.553
YES THAT CAN BE DONE AND HAS    
BEEN DONE IN THE PAST.          
SO THERE'S NOT LIKE A WE'RE NOT
