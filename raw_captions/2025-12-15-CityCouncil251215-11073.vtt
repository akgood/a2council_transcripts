THE DOWNTOWN I WOULD LIKE TO    
ADD THAT IF WE HAD IF WE WERE   

01:10:29.757 --> 01:10:32.859
THE DOWNTOWN I WOULD LIKE TO    
ADD THAT IF WE HAD IF WE WERE   
TO DO THREE HUNDRED AND THREE

THAT WE'RE PLANNING ON BUILDING 

01:10:43.037 --> 01:10:43.969
PROPERTIES OUTSIDE THE DOWNTOWN 
THAT WE'RE PLANNING ON BUILDING 
BUT BETWEEN THOSE SITES WE      

01:10:43.971 --> 01:10:46.839
THAT WE'RE PLANNING ON BUILDING 
BUT BETWEEN THOSE SITES WE      
WOULD MAYBE BUILD ABOUT 50      

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:50.876
BUT BETWEEN THOSE SITES WE      
WOULD MAYBE BUILD ABOUT 50      
UNITS TOTAL AND IT'S THE        

01:10:50.878 --> 01:10:51.577
WOULD MAYBE BUILD ABOUT 50      
UNITS TOTAL AND IT'S THE        
DENSITY AND LIMITATIONS OUTSIDE 

01:10:51.579 --> 01:10:52.378
UNITS TOTAL AND IT'S THE

SO I NEED TO COMPETE WITH THE   

01:10:55.549 --> 01:10:58.584
NUMBER OF UNITS WE GAMBLE.      
SO I NEED TO COMPETE WITH THE
