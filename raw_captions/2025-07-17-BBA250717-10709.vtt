THERE WAS A DOOR THAT WAS RIGHT 
ON TOP OF THE OLD STAIRS AND    

00:13:05.257 --> 00:13:07.825
THERE WAS A DOOR THAT WAS RIGHT 
ON TOP OF THE OLD STAIRS AND

BUT OUR THOUGHT WAS OK, THERE'S 

00:13:19.238 --> 00:13:20.004
FLOOR NOT AS MUCH BUT WE WERE   
BUT OUR THOUGHT WAS OK, THERE'S 
A REQUIREMENT THAT THERE TO BE  

00:13:20.006 --> 00:13:20.838
BUT OUR THOUGHT WAS OK, THERE'S 
A REQUIREMENT THAT THERE TO BE  
SPACE BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE  

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.105
A REQUIREMENT THAT THERE TO BE

00:25:42.314 --> 00:25:42.980
STUFF.                          
BUT THAT SEEMS THAT SEEMS TO BE 
THE CRUX OF WHAT'S CAUSING A    

00:25:42.982 --> 00:25:45.649
BUT THAT SEEMS THAT SEEMS TO BE 
THE CRUX OF WHAT'S CAUSING A    
LOT OF THE PROBLEM.             

00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:46.950
THE CRUX OF WHAT'S CAUSING A    
LOT OF THE PROBLEM.             
YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU INSIST ON  

00:25:46.952 --> 00:25:50.320
LOT OF THE PROBLEM.             
YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU INSIST ON  
THE STARE THE DOOR AT THE       

00:25:50.322 --> 00:25:51.021
YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU INSIST ON  
THE STARE THE DOOR AT THE       
BOTTOM OF THE STAIR AND THE     

00:25:51.023 --> 00:25:53.957
THE STARE THE DOOR AT THE       
BOTTOM OF THE STAIR AND THE     
DOOR THE TOP OF THE STAIR ISN'T 

00:25:53.959 --> 00:25:57.194
BOTTOM OF THE STAIR AND THE     
DOOR THE TOP OF THE STAIR ISN'T 
THERE THEN THAT GETS A WHOLE    

00:25:57.196 --> 00:25:57.928
DOOR THE TOP OF THE STAIR ISN'T 
THERE THEN THAT GETS A WHOLE    
OTHER SET OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE   

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:58.595
THERE THEN THAT GETS A WHOLE    
OTHER SET OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE   
YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE       

00:25:58.597 --> 00:26:01.264
OTHER SET OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE   
YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE

IS PRACTICAL WITH YOU KNOW, THE 
EXISTING CONFINES YOU KNOW      

00:28:52.437 --> 00:28:55.973
IS PRACTICAL WITH YOU KNOW, THE 
EXISTING CONFINES YOU KNOW      
THAT'S ON THE OUTSIDE THE       

00:28:55.975 --> 00:28:57.073
EXISTING CONFINES YOU KNOW      
THAT'S ON THE OUTSIDE THE       
DISTRICT, THE OUTSIDE MORE THAN 

00:28:57.075 --> 00:28:57.507
THAT'S ON THE OUTSIDE THE

00:29:46.658 --> 00:29:47.457
TO SAY.                         
I MEAN THE CHALLENGE IS ONCE    
YOU TOUCH IT YOU'RE GOING TO    

00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:48.058
I MEAN THE CHALLENGE IS ONCE    
YOU TOUCH IT YOU'RE GOING TO    
BRING UP THE CODE .             

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.025
YOU TOUCH IT YOU'RE GOING TO    
BRING UP THE CODE .             
IT'S THE CHALLENGE IS THE END   

00:29:49.027 --> 00:29:53.029
BRING UP THE CODE .             
IT'S THE CHALLENGE IS THE END   
OF YOU KNOW, WHICH WE FEEL THAT 

00:29:53.031 --> 00:29:55.565
IT'S THE CHALLENGE IS THE END   
OF YOU KNOW, WHICH WE FEEL THAT 
LANDING AND FLUSH THE TRIGGER,  

00:29:55.567 --> 00:29:56.633
OF YOU KNOW, WHICH WE FEEL THAT 
LANDING AND FLUSH THE TRIGGER,  
ET CETERA, ALL THE REST THE WAY 

00:29:56.635 --> 00:30:03.006
LANDING AND FLUSH THE TRIGGER,  
ET CETERA, ALL THE REST THE WAY 
DOWN YOU REBUILD                

00:30:03.274 --> 00:30:08.244
                .               
IT WAS BUILT AS A HOUSE WHICH   
PROBABLY WHY IT WAS DRIVING OR  

00:30:08.246 --> 00:30:11.514
IT WAS BUILT AS A HOUSE WHICH   
PROBABLY WHY IT WAS DRIVING OR  
HAVING TO RIDE IN YOU THAT      

00:30:11.516 --> 00:30:12.049
PROBABLY WHY IT WAS DRIVING OR  
HAVING TO RIDE IN YOU THAT      
STAIRWAY, YOU KNOW.             

00:30:12.051 --> 00:30:19.022
HAVING TO RIDE IN YOU THAT      
STAIRWAY, YOU KNOW.             
SO THAT WAS THE                 

00:30:24.362 --> 00:30:32.469
                YOU KNOW, THE   
QUESTIONS ROUBAUD I THINK THAT  
QUESTION IS WHERE DO WE GO FROM 

00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:32.802
QUESTIONS ROUBAUD I THINK THAT  
QUESTION IS WHERE DO WE GO FROM 
HERE?                           

00:30:32.804 --> 00:30:33.803
QUESTION IS WHERE DO WE GO FROM 
HERE?                           
I MEAN THE STAIRS WE COULD      

00:30:33.805 --> 00:30:37.240
HERE?                           
I MEAN THE STAIRS WE COULD      
DISCUSS OUR FIRE RATING WINDOWS 

00:30:37.242 --> 00:30:41.211
I MEAN THE STAIRS WE COULD      
DISCUSS OUR FIRE RATING WINDOWS 
COVERED BUT CAN WE DO SOMETHING 

00:30:41.213 --> 00:30:42.178
DISCUSS OUR FIRE RATING WINDOWS 
COVERED BUT CAN WE DO SOMETHING 
WITH THE DOOR NOW THAT YOU SEE  

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.482
COVERED BUT CAN WE DO SOMETHING 
WITH THE DOOR NOW THAT YOU SEE  
WHERE ANGST WAS FOR US IN TERMS 

00:30:45.484 --> 00:30:47.783
WITH THE DOOR NOW THAT YOU SEE  
WHERE ANGST WAS FOR US IN TERMS 
OF THE DRAWING?                 

00:30:47.785 --> 00:30:48.885
WHERE ANGST WAS FOR US IN TERMS 
OF THE DRAWING?                 
I UNDERSTAND THAT I DIDN'T SEE  

00:30:48.887 --> 00:30:51.488
OF THE DRAWING?                 
I UNDERSTAND THAT I DIDN'T SEE  
THAT.                           

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:56.025
I UNDERSTAND THAT I DIDN'T SEE  
THAT.                           
IT JUST LOOKED THAT IN I MEAN I 

00:30:56.027 --> 00:31:00.063
THAT.                           
IT JUST LOOKED THAT IN I MEAN I 
GUESS, YOU KNOW, IS THERE A     

00:31:00.065 --> 00:31:02.666
IT JUST LOOKED THAT IN I MEAN I 
GUESS, YOU KNOW, IS THERE A     
MIDDLE GROUND HERE?             

00:31:02.668 --> 00:31:03.599
GUESS, YOU KNOW, IS THERE A     
MIDDLE GROUND HERE?             
DON'T WE LIVE WITH THE STAIRS   

00:31:03.601 --> 00:31:06.869
MIDDLE GROUND HERE?             
DON'T WE LIVE WITH THE STAIRS   
AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTER?     

00:31:06.871 --> 00:31:07.971
DON'T WE LIVE WITH THE STAIRS   
AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTER?     
I LIKE WE LIKE TO SEE IS THAT   

00:31:07.973 --> 00:31:10.573
AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTER?     
I LIKE WE LIKE TO SEE IS THAT   
WHICH YOU DON'T YOU THE DRAW    

00:31:10.575 --> 00:31:11.441
I LIKE WE LIKE TO SEE IS THAT   
WHICH YOU DON'T YOU THE DRAW    
THERE WITH THE HYDRAULICS I'M   

00:31:11.443 --> 00:31:12.375
WHICH YOU DON'T YOU THE DRAW    
THERE WITH THE HYDRAULICS I'M

00:31:14.713 --> 00:31:15.512
SURE WE CAN YOU GET A 7-ELEVEN  
THERE IF YOU START AT THE TOP   
WHEN YOU'RE STARING IT AND NO   

00:31:15.514 --> 00:31:16.145
THERE IF YOU START AT THE TOP   
WHEN YOU'RE STARING IT AND NO

00:31:51.883 --> 00:31:52.916
BEGETS A WHOLE OTHER QUESTION   
OF HOW DID WE GET TO THIS POINT 
WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE DRAWINGS   

00:31:52.918 --> 00:31:55.985
OF HOW DID WE GET TO THIS POINT 
WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE DRAWINGS   
WERE FINE BUT THEY DIDN'T SHOW

WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE DRAWINGS

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.838
THE BASIS THAT THIS EXISTING

00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:19.175
AND I HAVE MUCH MORE OF A       
PROBLEM WITH THE DOOR AT THE    
BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND A      

00:32:19.177 --> 00:32:20.042
PROBLEM WITH THE DOOR AT THE    
BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND A      
LITTLE TOO FOR THE LANDING AS   

00:32:20.044 --> 00:32:20.777
BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND A      
LITTLE TOO FOR THE LANDING AS   
YOU COME BARRELING DOWN THE     

00:32:20.779 --> 00:32:24.447
LITTLE TOO FOR THE LANDING AS   
YOU COME BARRELING DOWN THE

BE SOLVED BY PUTTING THE DOOR   
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.       
WE HAVE IT SHOWN AND JUST       

00:32:43.202 --> 00:32:46.636
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.       
WE HAVE IT SHOWN AND JUST       
MAKING IT POSSIBLE AND MAKING   

00:32:46.638 --> 00:32:47.370
WE HAVE IT SHOWN AND JUST

TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM            
OF SECURITY.                    
THE VARIANCE GOES WITH THE
