HAVING A LOCATION LIKE THIS IN  
THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN SIMPLY    

01:03:13.953 --> 01:03:14.952
HAVING A LOCATION LIKE THIS IN  
THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN SIMPLY    
JUST DOESN&apos;T DRIVE THE KIND     

01:03:14.954 --> 01:03:17.956
THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN SIMPLY    
JUST DOESN&apos;T DRIVE THE KIND     
OF ENERGY AND ATTRACTION AND    

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:18.757
JUST DOESN&apos;T DRIVE THE KIND     
OF ENERGY AND ATTRACTION AND    
YOU SEE THAT IN MULTIPLE CITIES 

01:03:18.759 --> 01:03:21.292
OF ENERGY AND ATTRACTION AND    
YOU SEE THAT IN MULTIPLE CITIES 
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES YOU&apos;RE

I ALSO THINK DRIVING PROJECTS   
THAT INCREASE REVENUE           

01:03:33.607 --> 01:03:36.707
I ALSO THINK DRIVING PROJECTS   
THAT INCREASE REVENUE           
GENERATION THAT CAN THEN BE     

01:03:36.709 --> 01:03:40.478

GENERATION THAT CAN THEN BE     
LATER ON USED FOR MORE FEASIBLE 
,MORE SENSIBLE AFFORDABLE

IF YOU RUN FIFTY MILES I GUESS  

01:47:46.457 --> 01:47:49.691
ELISSE OR FOUR MILLION A YEAR   
IF YOU RUN FIFTY MILES I GUESS  
YOU COULD GET THAT IF YOU HAVE

YOU COULD GET THAT IF YOU HAVE  
THE RIGHT TCV AND IT ENDS UP    

01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:53.394
YOU COULD GET THAT IF YOU HAVE  
THE RIGHT TCV AND IT ENDS UP    
BEING FOUR MILLION A YEAR BUT   

01:47:53.396 --> 01:47:54.163
THE RIGHT TCV AND IT ENDS UP    
BEING FOUR MILLION A YEAR BUT   
THE CITY ITSELF ONLY GETS       

01:47:54.165 --> 01:47:57.665
BEING FOUR MILLION A YEAR BUT   
THE CITY ITSELF ONLY GETS       
SIXTEEN MILLION WHICH IS ABOUT  

01:47:57.667 --> 01:47:58.233
THE CITY ITSELF ONLY GETS       
SIXTEEN MILLION WHICH IS ABOUT  
A THIRD OF THAT.                

01:47:58.235 --> 01:47:59.234
SIXTEEN MILLION WHICH IS ABOUT  
A THIRD OF THAT.                
SO THE REAL NUMBER IF YOU&apos;RE    

01:47:59.236 --> 01:48:05.140
A THIRD OF THAT.                
SO THE REAL NUMBER IF YOU&apos;RE    
BEING                           

01:48:18.021 --> 01:48:21.290
      FULLY I DON&apos;T WANT TO USE 
THE WORD TRANSPARENT THAT&apos;S     
YOU&apos;VE BEEN CORRECT.            

01:48:21.292 --> 01:48:22.090
THE WORD TRANSPARENT THAT&apos;S     
YOU&apos;VE BEEN CORRECT.            
YOU YOU WOULD GET SOMEWHERE IN  

01:48:22.092 --> 01:48:22.825

THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SEVENTY     
MILLION A YEAR.                 
SO I JUST THINK THAT OUGHT TO   

01:48:24.028 --> 01:48:24.360
MILLION A YEAR.                 
SO I JUST THINK THAT OUGHT TO   
BE LAID OUT.                    

01:48:24.362 --> 01:48:25.026
SO I JUST THINK THAT OUGHT TO   
BE LAID OUT.                    
THAT&apos;S THE REAL TERMS.          

01:48:25.028 --> 01:48:25.627
BE LAID OUT.

MONEY, ET CETERA.               
BUT IT&apos;S NOT THE CITY.          
THE SECOND ITEM I THINK THAT    

01:48:28.099 --> 01:48:28.897
BUT IT&apos;S NOT THE CITY.          
THE SECOND ITEM I THINK THAT    
GOES TO THAT IS THAT YOU&apos;RE     

01:48:28.899 --> 01:48:29.631
THE SECOND ITEM I THINK THAT    
GOES TO THAT IS THAT YOU&apos;RE     
ALSO PLANNING AND REALLY TRYING 

01:48:29.633 --> 01:48:29.964
GOES TO THAT IS THAT YOU&apos;RE     
ALSO PLANNING AND REALLY TRYING 
HARD.                           

01:48:29.966 --> 01:48:30.632
ALSO PLANNING AND REALLY TRYING 
HARD.                           
IF I READ THE EMAILS RIGHT TO   

01:48:30.634 --> 01:48:31.467

IF I READ THE EMAILS RIGHT TO   
GET TIFF&apos;S TIFF&apos;S WOULD MEAN    

01:48:31.469 --> 01:48:32.134
IF I READ THE EMAILS RIGHT TO   
GET TIFF&apos;S TIFF&apos;S WOULD MEAN    
THAT THAT MONEY WOULD BE WAY,   

01:48:32.136 --> 01:48:32.935
GET TIFF&apos;S TIFF&apos;S WOULD MEAN    
THAT THAT MONEY WOULD BE WAY,   
WAY LESS BECAUSE YOU WOULDN&apos;T   

01:48:32.937 --> 01:48:34.769
THAT THAT MONEY WOULD BE WAY,   
WAY LESS BECAUSE YOU WOULDN&apos;T   
BE PAYING ANY PROPERTY TAXES.   

01:48:34.771 --> 01:48:35.937

BE PAYING ANY PROPERTY TAXES.
