THAT I'VE HEARD RAISED ABOUT    
THIS LOCATION HAVE TO DO WITH   
SAFETY FOR PEDESTRIANS ALONG    

00:54:12.299 --> 00:54:13.331
THIS LOCATION HAVE TO DO WITH

00:54:35.856 --> 00:54:36.488
I WOULD LIKE TO BETTER          
UNDERSTAND THE STATUS OF THE

TRAFFIC SIGNAL BECAUSE I        
BELIEVE IN THE RESPONSE MUMOLO  

00:54:37.224 --> 00:54:40.225
TRAFFIC SIGNAL BECAUSE I        
BELIEVE IN THE RESPONSE MUMOLO  
THAT WE GOT IT SAID THAT THE    

00:54:40.227 --> 00:54:41.093
BELIEVE IN THE RESPONSE MUMOLO  
THAT WE GOT IT SAID THAT THE    
DEVELOPER WOULD NEED TO CONDUCT 

00:54:41.095 --> 00:54:44.195
THAT WE GOT IT SAID THAT THE    
DEVELOPER WOULD NEED TO CONDUCT 
ANOTHER STUDY TO DO THAT        

00:54:44.197 --> 00:54:44.863
DEVELOPER WOULD NEED TO CONDUCT 
ANOTHER STUDY TO DO THAT        
TRAFFIC AND THEY HAVE NOT       

00:54:44.865 --> 00:54:48.066
ANOTHER STUDY TO DO THAT        
TRAFFIC AND THEY HAVE NOT       
INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO DO   

00:54:48.068 --> 00:54:48.466
TRAFFIC AND THEY HAVE NOT       
INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO DO   
SO SO FAR.                      

00:54:48.468 --> 00:54:49.268
INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO DO   
SO SO FAR.

EVERYONE.                       
SO THE STATUS OF THE TRAFFIC    
LIGHT THERE WERE SOME INTERNAL  

00:55:27.307 --> 00:55:30.109
SO THE STATUS OF THE TRAFFIC    
LIGHT THERE WERE SOME INTERNAL  
DISCUSSIONS BEFORE THE SITE     

00:55:30.111 --> 00:55:30.976
LIGHT THERE WERE SOME INTERNAL

PLAN WAS SENT A PLANNING        

00:55:30.978 --> 00:55:31.576
DISCUSSIONS BEFORE THE SITE     
PLAN WAS SENT A PLANNING        
COMMISSION ABOUT A TRAFFIC      

00:55:31.578 --> 00:55:34.379
PLAN WAS SENT A PLANNING        
COMMISSION ABOUT A TRAFFIC      
LIGHT WAS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR  

00:55:34.381 --> 00:55:35.180
COMMISSION ABOUT A TRAFFIC      
LIGHT WAS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR  
THE SITE OR IF CROSSWALKS WERE  

00:55:35.182 --> 00:55:37.683
LIGHT WAS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR  
THE SITE OR IF CROSSWALKS WERE  
MORE APPROPRIATE.               

00:55:37.685 --> 00:55:38.417
THE SITE OR IF CROSSWALKS WERE  
MORE APPROPRIATE.               
TRANSPORTATION STAFF DECIDED    

00:55:38.419 --> 00:55:42.020
MORE APPROPRIATE.               
TRANSPORTATION STAFF DECIDED    
THAT THEY NEEDED MORE           

00:55:42.022 --> 00:55:42.821
TRANSPORTATION STAFF DECIDED    
THAT THEY NEEDED MORE           
INFORMATION AND MORE ANALYSIS   

00:55:42.823 --> 00:55:45.423
THAT THEY NEEDED MORE           
INFORMATION AND MORE ANALYSIS   
TO PUT IN A TRAFFIC SIGNAL IN

COMMISSION THAT IT WOULD BE     
CROSSWALKS.                     
I BELIEVE THE DEVELOPER DID

01:09:32.552 --> 01:09:33.151
I DO THINK THAT THIS COMING TO  
COUNCIL SERVES AN IMPORTANT     
EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE BOTH FOR

01:09:44.831 --> 01:09:47.931
THAT I STRUGGLED WITH THE

BUT I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S AN   

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:48.699
INCREASE AT THAT POINT IN TIME. 
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S AN
