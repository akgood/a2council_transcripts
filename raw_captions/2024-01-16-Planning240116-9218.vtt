BECAUSE I MEAN THE SEVENTIES    
AREN&apos;T THAT LONG AGO WHEN WE    
SAY THAT THE CITY OBTAINED THE  

00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:25.491
AREN&apos;T THAT LONG AGO WHEN WE    
SAY THAT THE CITY OBTAINED THE  
DEED OR OBTAINED ROADWAY RIGHTS 

00:17:25.493 --> 00:17:29.828
SAY THAT THE CITY OBTAINED THE  
DEED OR OBTAINED ROADWAY RIGHTS 
DID WE PURCHASE THEM?           

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.299
DEED OR OBTAINED ROADWAY RIGHTS 
DID WE PURCHASE THEM?           
I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN WE DID NOT  

00:17:34.301 --> 00:17:35.000
DID WE PURCHASE THEM?           
I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN WE DID NOT  
BUT I THE TIMING LINES UP.      

00:17:35.002 --> 00:17:38.471
I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN WE DID NOT  
BUT I THE TIMING LINES UP.      
I DID NOT DO THE RESEARCH BUT   

00:17:38.473 --> 00:17:39.204
BUT I THE TIMING LINES UP.      
I DID NOT DO THE RESEARCH BUT   
THE TIMING LINES UP THAT THESE  

00:17:39.206 --> 00:17:41.440
I DID NOT DO THE RESEARCH BUT   
THE TIMING LINES UP THAT THESE  
WERE ACQUIRED AT THE TIME THAT  

00:17:41.442 --> 00:17:43.842
THE TIMING LINES UP THAT THESE  
WERE ACQUIRED AT THE TIME THAT  
777 EISENHOWER WAS BUILT.       

00:17:43.844 --> 00:17:48.647
WERE ACQUIRED AT THE TIME THAT  
777 EISENHOWER WAS BUILT.       
OK I MEAN THIS MAKES SENSE.     

00:17:48.649 --> 00:17:52.485
777 EISENHOWER WAS BUILT.       
OK I MEAN THIS MAKES SENSE.     
I&apos;VE NEVER ASKED THIS QUESTION  

00:17:52.487 --> 00:17:53.352
OK I MEAN THIS MAKES SENSE.     
I&apos;VE NEVER ASKED THIS QUESTION  
BEFORE BECAUSE IT&apos;S ALWAYS BEEN 

00:17:53.354 --> 00:17:56.088
I&apos;VE NEVER ASKED THIS QUESTION  
BEFORE BECAUSE IT&apos;S ALWAYS BEEN 
LIKE REALLY REALLY OLD.         

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.155
BEFORE BECAUSE IT&apos;S ALWAYS BEEN 
LIKE REALLY REALLY OLD.         
THE ALLEY WAS DRAWN ON A MAP.   

00:17:57.157 --> 00:17:57.890
LIKE REALLY REALLY OLD.         
THE ALLEY WAS DRAWN ON A MAP.   
NOBODY EVER USED IT RIGHT.      

00:17:57.892 --> 00:18:00.592
THE ALLEY WAS DRAWN ON A MAP.   
NOBODY EVER USED IT RIGHT.      
THE ROAD WAS DRAWN BUT WE NEVER 

00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:01.526
NOBODY EVER USED IT RIGHT.      
THE ROAD WAS DRAWN BUT WE NEVER 
IT WAS NEVER USED THAT WAY AND  

00:18:01.528 --> 00:18:03.328
THE ROAD WAS DRAWN BUT WE NEVER 
IT WAS NEVER USED THAT WAY AND  
THIS JUST SEEMS RELATIVELY      

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.063
IT WAS NEVER USED THAT WAY AND  
THIS JUST SEEMS RELATIVELY      
RECENT AND THE REASON THAT I    

00:18:04.065 --> 00:18:07.466
THIS JUST SEEMS RELATIVELY      
RECENT AND THE REASON THAT I    
BRING IT UP IS WHEN WE HAD THE  

00:18:07.468 --> 00:18:10.836
RECENT AND THE REASON THAT I    
BRING IT UP IS WHEN WE HAD THE  
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE  

00:18:10.838 --> 00:18:11.837
BRING IT UP IS WHEN WE HAD THE  
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE  
IT WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE     

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:14.974
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE  
IT WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE     
ROAD RIGHT OF WAY ALONG KIND    

00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:15.841
IT WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE     
ROAD RIGHT OF WAY ALONG KIND    
OF THE TAXI ONE CORRIDORS AND   

00:18:15.843 --> 00:18:16.842
ROAD RIGHT OF WAY ALONG KIND    
OF THE TAXI ONE CORRIDORS AND   
THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO  

00:18:16.844 --> 00:18:19.878
OF THE TAXI ONE CORRIDORS AND   
THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO  
BUY IT MAKES ME THINK LIKE IF   

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.545
THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO  
BUY IT MAKES ME THINK LIKE IF   
WE BOUGHT THIS I FEEL LIKE      

00:18:20.547 --> 00:18:23.381
BUY IT MAKES ME THINK LIKE IF   
WE BOUGHT THIS I FEEL LIKE      
SOMEBODY SHOULD BACK FROM US    

00:18:23.383 --> 00:18:30.288
WE BOUGHT THIS I FEEL LIKE      
SOMEBODY SHOULD BACK FROM US    
PERSONALLY SO IF IF WE DIDN&apos;T   

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.056
SOMEBODY SHOULD BACK FROM US    
PERSONALLY SO IF IF WE DIDN&apos;T   
PURCHASE IT IF IT WAS JUST      

00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:31.757
PERSONALLY SO IF IF WE DIDN&apos;T   
PURCHASE IT IF IT WAS JUST      
CONVEYED AS PART OF THE

TWENTY ONE FEET I THINK         
CURRENTLY FROM COLOURBLIND TO   

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.340
TWENTY ONE FEET I THINK         
CURRENTLY FROM COLOURBLIND TO   
WHERE THE PROPERTY LINE IS NOW  

00:24:22.342 --> 00:24:23.007
CURRENTLY FROM COLOURBLIND TO   
WHERE THE PROPERTY LINE IS NOW  
IS ABOUT FORTY FIVE FEET.

SO WHAT THIS DOES THAT ACTUALLY 
MAKES IT POSSIBLE BECAUSE RIGHT 
NOW THE BUILDING CAN&apos;T BE       

00:24:30.084 --> 00:24:30.816
MAKES IT POSSIBLE BECAUSE RIGHT 
NOW THE BUILDING CAN&apos;T BE       
CLOSER THAN FORTY FIVE FEET.    

00:24:30.818 --> 00:24:31.950
NOW THE BUILDING CAN&apos;T BE       
CLOSER THAN FORTY FIVE FEET.    
RIGHT AND SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO 

00:24:31.952 --> 00:24:34.486
CLOSER THAN FORTY FIVE FEET.    
RIGHT AND SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO 
IS CONTINGENT UPON WORKING OUT

IT MIGHT IMPACT THE TYPES       
OF DEVELOPERS THAT MIGHT BE     
ABLE TO APPROACH THAT IF        

00:41:15.421 --> 00:41:16.153
OF DEVELOPERS THAT MIGHT BE     
ABLE TO APPROACH THAT IF        
THEY&apos;RE NOT REALLY WELL         

00:41:16.155 --> 00:41:19.690
ABLE TO APPROACH THAT IF        
THEY&apos;RE NOT REALLY WELL         
RESOURCED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE   

00:41:19.692 --> 00:41:20.357
THEY&apos;RE NOT REALLY WELL         
RESOURCED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE   
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT VERSUS       

00:41:20.359 --> 00:41:22.893
RESOURCED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE   
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT VERSUS       
SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO

TO ACCOMPLISH THAT VERSUS       
SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO   
GET TO A STAGE OF APPROVAL THAT 

00:41:24.163 --> 00:41:27.598
SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO   
GET TO A STAGE OF APPROVAL THAT 
OPENS UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR    

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.199
GET TO A STAGE OF APPROVAL THAT 
OPENS UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR    
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND       

00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:28.666
OPENS UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR    
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND       
DETAILED ANALYSIS.              

00:41:28.668 --> 00:41:31.202
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND       
DETAILED ANALYSIS.              
SO I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT 

00:41:31.204 --> 00:41:34.671
DETAILED ANALYSIS.              
SO I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT 
PART OF THE STUDY AND SO I JUST 

00:41:34.673 --> 00:41:35.506
SO I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT 
PART OF THE STUDY AND SO I JUST 
WANT TO POINT OUT PART OF IT IS 

00:41:35.508 --> 00:41:38.108
PART OF THE STUDY AND SO I JUST 
WANT TO POINT OUT PART OF IT IS 
JUST HOW THE CITY THINKS ABOUT  

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:38.843
WANT TO POINT OUT PART OF IT IS 
JUST HOW THE CITY THINKS ABOUT  
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE AS 

00:41:38.845 --> 00:41:41.846
JUST HOW THE CITY THINKS ABOUT  
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE AS 
A CITY I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S BEEN  

00:41:41.848 --> 00:41:42.713
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE AS 
A CITY I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S BEEN  
SOMETHING THAT I&apos;VE SEEN THAT   

00:41:42.715 --> 00:41:45.950
A CITY I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S BEEN  
SOMETHING THAT I&apos;VE SEEN THAT   
WE INVEST IN VERY SPECIFICALLY  

00:41:45.952 --> 00:41:47.017
SOMETHING THAT I&apos;VE SEEN THAT   
WE INVEST IN VERY SPECIFICALLY  
SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES DO WITH  

00:41:47.019 --> 00:41:50.487
WE INVEST IN VERY SPECIFICALLY  
SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES DO WITH  
YOU DEDICATED RESOURCES TOWARDS 

00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:53.323
SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES DO WITH  
YOU DEDICATED RESOURCES TOWARDS 
THAT END.                       

00:41:53.325 --> 00:41:54.158
YOU DEDICATED RESOURCES TOWARDS 
THAT END.                       
MAYBE IT&apos;S BECAUSE THERE&apos;S BEEN 

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.027
THAT END.                       
MAYBE IT&apos;S BECAUSE THERE&apos;S BEEN 
A SENSE THAT WE DON&apos;T NEED TO   

00:41:57.029 --> 00:41:58.061
MAYBE IT&apos;S BECAUSE THERE&apos;S BEEN 
A SENSE THAT WE DON&apos;T NEED TO   
WHETHER THAT&apos;S TRUE OR NOT, I   

00:41:58.063 --> 00:41:58.730
A SENSE THAT WE DON&apos;T NEED TO   
WHETHER THAT&apos;S TRUE OR NOT, I   
THINK IT&apos;S A QUESTION ABOUT     

00:41:58.732 --> 00:42:01.799
WHETHER THAT&apos;S TRUE OR NOT, I   
THINK IT&apos;S A QUESTION ABOUT     
WHETHER WHAT KIND OF UM WHAT    

00:42:01.801 --> 00:42:05.236
THINK IT&apos;S A QUESTION ABOUT     
WHETHER WHAT KIND OF UM WHAT    
KIND OF OUTCOMES DO WE GET AND  

00:42:05.238 --> 00:42:06.036
WHETHER WHAT KIND OF UM WHAT    
KIND OF OUTCOMES DO WE GET AND  
WHAT KIND OF OUTCOMES WOULD     

00:42:06.038 --> 00:42:06.904
KIND OF OUTCOMES DO WE GET AND  
WHAT KIND OF OUTCOMES WOULD     
CHANGE IF WE DID MAKE SOME      

00:42:06.906 --> 00:42:07.372
WHAT KIND OF OUTCOMES WOULD     
CHANGE IF WE DID MAKE SOME      
OF THOSE INVESTMENTS.           

00:42:07.374 --> 00:42:09.940
CHANGE IF WE DID MAKE SOME      
OF THOSE INVESTMENTS.           
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S A BIG PART    

00:42:09.942 --> 00:42:10.508
OF THOSE INVESTMENTS.           
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S A BIG PART    
OF THE REPORT AS WELL.          

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.241
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S A BIG PART

IF THOSE FOR THOSE OF YOU       

00:42:11.243 --> 00:42:13.644

IF THOSE FOR THOSE OF YOU
