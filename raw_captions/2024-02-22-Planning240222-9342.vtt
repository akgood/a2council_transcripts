LESS PARKING THAN WAS BEFORE    
MORE HOUSES, LESS PARKING AND I 
THINK THAT THAT&apos;S THAT MAKES    

00:30:33.168 --> 00:30:33.499
MORE HOUSES, LESS PARKING AND I 
THINK THAT THAT&apos;S THAT MAKES

00:30:33.501 --> 00:30:36.569
THINK THAT THAT&apos;S THAT MAKES    
SENSE.                          
I MEAN WHEN YOU COMPARE THE     

00:30:36.571 --> 00:30:40.674

I MEAN WHEN YOU COMPARE THE     
WHAT&apos;S ALLOWED IN R FOR A TO R  

00:30:40.676 --> 00:30:45.211
I MEAN WHEN YOU COMPARE THE     
WHAT&apos;S ALLOWED IN R FOR A TO R  
FOR D HEIGHT IS THE DIFFERENCE. 

00:30:45.213 --> 00:30:45.945
WHAT&apos;S ALLOWED IN R FOR A TO R  
FOR D HEIGHT IS THE DIFFERENCE. 
IT&apos;S THE KEY DIFFERENCE THE     

00:30:45.947 --> 00:30:46.680
FOR D HEIGHT IS THE DIFFERENCE. 
IT&apos;S THE KEY DIFFERENCE THE     
REST OF THE SET BACKS IF YOU    

00:30:46.682 --> 00:30:48.081
IT&apos;S THE KEY DIFFERENCE THE     
REST OF THE SET BACKS IF YOU    
HAVEN&apos;T DONE A COMPARISON CHART 

00:30:48.083 --> 00:30:51.617
REST OF THE SET BACKS IF YOU    
HAVEN&apos;T DONE A COMPARISON CHART 
AREN&apos;T THAT DIFFERENT BUT TWO   

00:30:51.619 --> 00:30:52.452
HAVEN&apos;T DONE A COMPARISON CHART 
AREN&apos;T THAT DIFFERENT BUT TWO   
AND A HALF TIMES THE DENSITY    

00:30:52.454 --> 00:30:56.022
AREN&apos;T THAT DIFFERENT BUT TWO   
AND A HALF TIMES THE DENSITY    
WHICH IS GREAT AND THEN THE     

00:30:56.024 --> 00:30:56.522
AND A HALF TIMES THE DENSITY    
WHICH IS GREAT AND THEN THE     
HEIGHT DIFFERENCE.              

00:30:56.524 --> 00:30:57.390
WHICH IS GREAT AND THEN THE     
HEIGHT DIFFERENCE.              
SO I THINK THAT THIS ACTUALLY   

00:30:57.392 --> 00:30:59.425
HEIGHT DIFFERENCE.              
SO I THINK THAT THIS ACTUALLY   
KIND OF STRIKES THE BALANCE

KIND OF STRIKES THE BALANCE

00:48:46.727 --> 00:48:47.526
MEMORIZED EVERY PAGE OF ALL THE 
SUBMISSIONS BUT IN ALL THE      
DISCUSSIONS WE&apos;VE HAD WITH THE  

00:48:47.528 --> 00:48:50.262
SUBMISSIONS BUT IN ALL THE      
DISCUSSIONS WE&apos;VE HAD WITH THE  
CITY OF THOSE WERE IMPORTANT    

00:48:50.264 --> 00:48:50.929

CITY OF THOSE WERE IMPORTANT    
COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT.      

00:48:50.931 --> 00:48:54.433
CITY OF THOSE WERE IMPORTANT    
COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT.      
SO I DON&apos;T THINK THAT&apos;S A       

00:48:54.435 --> 00:48:55.000
COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT.      
SO I DON&apos;T THINK THAT&apos;S A       
CONDITION OF THIS PLAN.         

00:48:55.002 --> 00:48:56.001
SO I DON&apos;T THINK THAT&apos;S A       
CONDITION OF THIS PLAN.         
WE WOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH  

00:48:56.003 --> 00:48:58.637
CONDITION OF THIS PLAN.         
WE WOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH  
COMMITTING THE ENERGY STAR      

00:48:58.639 --> 00:48:59.104
WE WOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH  
COMMITTING THE ENERGY STAR

ELECTRIFICATION AND PUTTING     
SOLAR PANELS ON THE ROOF OF THE 
SOLAR CONSULTANT.               

00:49:02.977 --> 00:49:05.778
SOLAR PANELS ON THE ROOF OF THE 
SOLAR CONSULTANT.               
SO I THINK WE COULD GET 10000   

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.147
SOLAR CONSULTANT.               
SO I THINK WE COULD GET 10000   
KILOWATT HOURS ANNUALLY OFF

SO I THINK WE COULD GET 10000   
KILOWATT HOURS ANNUALLY OFF

KILOWATT HOURS ANNUALLY OFF     
OF THE ROOF ALONE.              
SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE

SO IF THE AREA PLAN WAS SAYING  
LIKE THIS IS A GOOD PLACE FOR   
HOUSING, THERE&apos;S REALLY NO      

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:54.872
LIKE THIS IS A GOOD PLACE FOR   
HOUSING, THERE&apos;S REALLY NO      
WHERE LEFT IN THIS AREA FOR     

01:02:54.874 --> 01:02:55.173
HOUSING, THERE&apos;S REALLY NO      
WHERE LEFT IN THIS AREA FOR     
HOUSING.                        

01:02:55.175 --> 01:02:56.107
WHERE LEFT IN THIS AREA FOR     
HOUSING.                        
SO I THINK THIS IS THE PERFECT  

01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:57.842
HOUSING.                        
SO I THINK THIS IS THE PERFECT  
PLACE IDENTITY DENSITY GOING    

01:02:57.844 --> 01:02:58.576
SO I THINK THIS IS THE PERFECT  
PLACE IDENTITY DENSITY GOING    
BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT GAS, 

01:02:58.578 --> 01:03:02.079
PLACE IDENTITY DENSITY GOING    
BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT GAS, 
I I&apos;M ASSUMING YOU KNOW, YOU    

01:03:02.081 --> 01:03:02.780
BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT GAS, 
I I&apos;M ASSUMING YOU KNOW, YOU    
NEVER WANT TO ASSUME SO I&apos;M     

01:03:02.782 --> 01:03:04.348
I I&apos;M ASSUMING YOU KNOW, YOU    
NEVER WANT TO ASSUME SO I&apos;M     
ASKING THE EXISTING BUILDINGS   

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:08.819
NEVER WANT TO ASSUME SO I&apos;M     
ASKING THE EXISTING BUILDINGS   
HAVE GAS CONNECTIONS.           

01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:09.520
ASKING THE EXISTING BUILDINGS   
HAVE GAS CONNECTIONS.           
YES, THAT&apos;S CORRECT.            

01:03:09.522 --> 01:03:13.358
HAVE GAS CONNECTIONS.           
YES, THAT&apos;S CORRECT.            
THEY ALSO I THINK IT WAS        

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.125
YES, THAT&apos;S CORRECT.            
THEY ALSO I THINK IT WAS        
BROUGHT UP IN SOME OF THE       

01:03:14.127 --> 01:03:14.793
THEY ALSO I THINK IT WAS        
BROUGHT UP IN SOME OF THE       
PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE THIS WAS  

01:03:14.795 --> 01:03:20.398
BROUGHT UP IN SOME OF THE       
PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE THIS WAS  
THAT WE DID ATTEMPT TO INSTALL  

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.198
PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE THIS WAS  
THAT WE DID ATTEMPT TO INSTALL  
ALL ELECTRIC HEATING AND        

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:21.933
THAT WE DID ATTEMPT TO INSTALL  
ALL ELECTRIC HEATING AND        
COOLING SYSTEM IN THE ORIGINAL  

01:03:21.935 --> 01:03:24.502
ALL ELECTRIC HEATING AND

COOLING SYSTEM IN THE ORIGINAL  
DEVELOPMENT.                    
WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS     

01:03:25.438 --> 01:03:28.439
DEVELOPMENT.                    
WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS     
THERE IS ACTUALLY THE EQUIPMENT 

01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:29.107
WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS     
THERE IS ACTUALLY THE EQUIPMENT 
THAT WE PURCHASED.              

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:32.443
THERE IS ACTUALLY THE EQUIPMENT 
THAT WE PURCHASED.              
IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE WRONG   

01:03:32.445 --> 01:03:33.244
THAT WE PURCHASED.              
IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE WRONG   
CHOICE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE     

01:03:33.246 --> 01:03:39.550
IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE WRONG   
CHOICE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE     
HEAT PUMP THAT AUGMENTS THE     

01:03:39.552 --> 01:03:40.218
CHOICE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE     
HEAT PUMP THAT AUGMENTS THE     
RESISTANCE HEATING WHICH IS     

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:44.122

DEGREES AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND 
THERE ARE HEAT PUMPS THAT RUN   

01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:49.460
DEGREES AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND 
THERE ARE HEAT PUMPS THAT RUN   
TO ZERO DEGREES.                

01:03:49.462 --> 01:03:52.130
THERE ARE HEAT PUMPS THAT RUN   
TO ZERO DEGREES.                
AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN ORDER TO 

01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:55.767
TO ZERO DEGREES.                
AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN ORDER TO 
FIX THAT ISSUE.                 

01:03:55.769 --> 01:03:59.971
AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN ORDER TO 
FIX THAT ISSUE.                 
AND WE HAD FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD  

01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:00.572
FIX THAT ISSUE.                 
AND WE HAD FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD  
PEOPLE LIVING IN STUDIO         

01:04:00.574 --> 01:04:01.305
AND WE HAD FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD  
PEOPLE LIVING IN STUDIO         
APARTMENTS THAT WERE GETTING    

01:04:01.307 --> 01:04:02.606
PEOPLE LIVING IN STUDIO         
APARTMENTS THAT WERE GETTING    
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS MONTHLY   

01:04:02.608 --> 01:04:03.441
APARTMENTS THAT WERE GETTING    
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS MONTHLY   
ELECTRIC BILLS AND IT REALLY    

01:04:03.443 --> 01:04:06.945
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS MONTHLY   
ELECTRIC BILLS AND IT REALLY    
WASN&apos;T A REASONABLE WAY FOR     

01:04:06.947 --> 01:04:07.344
ELECTRIC BILLS AND IT REALLY    
WASN&apos;T A REASONABLE WAY FOR     
ANYONE.                         

01:04:07.346 --> 01:04:08.079
WASN&apos;T A REASONABLE WAY FOR     
ANYONE.                         
IT WASN&apos;T EFFICIENT, IT WASN&apos;T

ANYONE.                         
IT WASN&apos;T EFFICIENT, IT WASN&apos;T  
THE RIGHT ANSWER AND OTHER THAN 

01:04:11.117 --> 01:04:11.882
IT WASN&apos;T EFFICIENT, IT WASN&apos;T  
THE RIGHT ANSWER AND OTHER THAN 
REPLACING ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT, 

01:04:11.884 --> 01:04:15.086
THE RIGHT ANSWER AND OTHER THAN 
REPLACING ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT, 
THE DECISION WAS TO INSTALL SIX 

01:04:15.088 --> 01:04:15.720
REPLACING ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT, 
THE DECISION WAS TO INSTALL SIX 
GAS BOILERS INTERNALLY THAT     

01:04:15.722 --> 01:04:18.790
THE DECISION WAS TO INSTALL SIX 
GAS BOILERS INTERNALLY THAT     
DIDN&apos;T HAVE HYDRAULIC FLUID     

01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:22.126
GAS BOILERS INTERNALLY THAT     
DIDN&apos;T HAVE HYDRAULIC FLUID     
THAT RUNS IMPACTS PIPING        

01:04:22.128 --> 01:04:22.927
DIDN&apos;T HAVE HYDRAULIC FLUID     
THAT RUNS IMPACTS PIPING        
THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING TO THE  

01:04:22.929 --> 01:04:26.030
THAT RUNS IMPACTS PIPING        
THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING TO THE  
COILS OF THE OF THE MECHANICALS 

01:04:26.032 --> 01:04:26.630
THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING TO THE

AND IT DOES POWER.              

01:04:26.632 --> 01:04:29.867
COILS OF THE OF THE MECHANICALS 
AND IT DOES POWER.              
SO YES, THERE IS GAS IN THOSE   

01:04:29.869 --> 01:04:30.901
AND IT DOES POWER.              
SO YES, THERE IS GAS IN THOSE   
BUILDINGS BUT THAT IS THAT WAS  

01:04:30.903 --> 01:04:34.539
SO YES, THERE IS GAS IN THOSE   
BUILDINGS BUT THAT IS THAT WAS  
A WE HAVE THE EDUCATION NOW ON

AIRCONDITIONERS AND THE HEAT    
PUMP IS INSIDE OF THE UNIT.     
THE THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE NOW   

01:04:46.052 --> 01:04:49.420
PUMP IS INSIDE OF THE UNIT.     
THE THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE NOW   
IS A SPLIT SYSTEM WITH A        

01:04:49.422 --> 01:04:50.187
THE THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE NOW   
IS A SPLIT SYSTEM WITH A        
CONDENSER ON THE ROOF AND THEN  

01:04:50.189 --> 01:04:53.424
IS A SPLIT SYSTEM WITH A        
CONDENSER ON THE ROOF AND THEN  
THE THERMODYNAMIC FROM YOU KNOW

TALKS ABOUT I THINK THIS        
BUILDING IN PARTICULAR THIS IS  
IDEAL FOR OUR FORESEE THIS      

01:06:44.571 --> 01:06:45.170
BUILDING IN PARTICULAR THIS IS  
IDEAL FOR OUR FORESEE THIS      
BUILDING IS THE PRESENCE        

01:06:45.172 --> 01:06:48.406
IDEAL FOR OUR FORESEE THIS      
BUILDING IS THE PRESENCE        
OF NATURAL LAND FEATURES THAT   

01:06:48.408 --> 01:06:49.174
BUILDING IS THE PRESENCE        
OF NATURAL LAND FEATURES THAT   
MAY BE USED TO ADVANTAGE IN     

01:06:49.176 --> 01:06:49.841
OF NATURAL LAND FEATURES THAT   
MAY BE USED TO ADVANTAGE IN     
SCALING DOWN THE POTENTIAL      

01:06:49.843 --> 01:06:52.276
MAY BE USED TO ADVANTAGE IN     
SCALING DOWN THE POTENTIAL      
IMPACTS ON SURROUNDING AREAS.   

01:06:52.278 --> 01:06:53.278
SCALING DOWN THE POTENTIAL      
IMPACTS ON SURROUNDING AREAS.   
WE TALKED ABOUT ITS HIGHWAY ON  

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.681
IMPACTS ON SURROUNDING AREAS.   
WE TALKED ABOUT ITS HIGHWAY ON  
ONE SIDE LIKE A PUBLIC LAND ON  

01:06:56.683 --> 01:06:57.215
WE TALKED ABOUT ITS HIGHWAY ON  
ONE SIDE LIKE A PUBLIC LAND ON  
THE OTHER SIDE.

ONE SIDE LIKE A PUBLIC LAND ON  
THE OTHER SIDE.                 
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT PART   

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:01.286

OF IT.                          

01:08:33.712 --> 01:08:35.846
AND AGAIN THIS IS THE END       
OF IT.                          
THERE&apos;S NOT MUCH BEYOND IT.

THERE&apos;S NOT MUCH BEYOND IT.     
IT&apos;S THE FARTHEST ONE FROM

SURE.                           
OBVIOUSLY LIKE DOWN AND THERE&apos;S 
A LOT BUT IT SEEMS ODD THAT     

01:08:41.054 --> 01:08:44.088
OBVIOUSLY LIKE DOWN AND THERE&apos;S 
A LOT BUT IT SEEMS ODD THAT     
THIS WOULD BE THE PLACE RATHER  

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:47.825
A LOT BUT IT SEEMS ODD THAT     
THIS WOULD BE THE PLACE RATHER  
THAN TO TO DENSIFIED RATHER     

01:08:47.827 --> 01:08:48.359
THIS WOULD BE THE PLACE RATHER  
THAN TO TO DENSIFIED RATHER     
THAN DENSIFY THE ENTIRE         

01:08:48.361 --> 01:08:48.759
THAN TO TO DENSIFIED RATHER     
THAN DENSIFY THE ENTIRE         
QUARTER.                        

01:08:48.761 --> 01:08:51.929
THAN DENSIFY THE ENTIRE         
QUARTER.                        
SO AGAIN, I&apos;M TRYING TO THINK   

01:08:51.931 --> 01:08:54.865
QUARTER.                        
SO AGAIN, I&apos;M TRYING TO THINK   
LIKE WHAT IS THE ONE HUNDRED    

01:08:54.867 --> 01:08:55.799
SO AGAIN, I&apos;M TRYING TO THINK   
LIKE WHAT IS THE ONE HUNDRED    
PERCENT AGREE THAT THAT THE     

01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:59.003
LIKE WHAT IS THE ONE HUNDRED    
PERCENT AGREE THAT THAT THE     
BUILDING THAT WE&apos;RE TALKING     

01:08:59.005 --> 01:09:03.540
PERCENT AGREE THAT THAT THE     
BUILDING THAT WE&apos;RE TALKING     
ABOUT THE THE DENSITY IN THE    

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:06.443
BUILDING THAT WE&apos;RE TALKING     
ABOUT THE THE DENSITY IN THE    
FORM THERE IS TOTALLY RIGHT.    

01:09:06.445 --> 01:09:07.245
ABOUT THE THE DENSITY IN THE    
FORM THERE IS TOTALLY RIGHT.    
I&apos;M STRUGGLING WITH THE WHOLE   

01:09:07.247 --> 01:09:10.481
FORM THERE IS TOTALLY RIGHT.    
I&apos;M STRUGGLING WITH THE WHOLE   
PROPERTY AND I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT  

01:09:10.483 --> 01:09:13.751
I&apos;M STRUGGLING WITH THE WHOLE   
PROPERTY AND I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT  
IT MEETS THAT CRITERIA AND AND  

01:09:13.753 --> 01:09:14.618
PROPERTY AND I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT  
IT MEETS THAT CRITERIA AND AND  
THIS IS ABOUT HALF OF WHAT      

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:18.422
IT MEETS THAT CRITERIA AND AND  
THIS IS ABOUT HALF OF WHAT      
COULD BE BUILT ON THIS SITE AND 

01:09:18.424 --> 01:09:19.156
THIS IS ABOUT HALF OF WHAT      
COULD BE BUILT ON THIS SITE AND 
AGAIN MAYBE IT COULD BE BETTER  

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:21.225
COULD BE BUILT ON THIS SITE AND 
AGAIN MAYBE IT COULD BE BETTER  
MAYBE IT WOULD BE INFILL BUT    

01:09:21.227 --> 01:09:22.126
AGAIN MAYBE IT COULD BE BETTER  
MAYBE IT WOULD BE INFILL BUT    
ALSO THIS REZONING ONE OF THE   

01:09:22.128 --> 01:09:25.195
MAYBE IT WOULD BE INFILL BUT    
ALSO THIS REZONING ONE OF THE   
OTHER THINGS THAT&apos;S DIFFERENT   

01:09:25.197 --> 01:09:29.366
ALSO THIS REZONING ONE OF THE   
OTHER THINGS THAT&apos;S DIFFERENT   
BETWEEN OUR FOUR AND OUR        

01:09:29.368 --> 01:09:29.667
OTHER THINGS THAT&apos;S DIFFERENT   
BETWEEN OUR FOUR AND OUR

FORCES.                         
THE AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE ARE    
FORTY FOUR GUYS THAT WE TALK    

01:09:33.306 --> 01:09:34.171
THE AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE ARE    
FORTY FOUR GUYS THAT WE TALK    
ABOUT OUR FORCES SO MUCH NOT    

01:09:34.173 --> 01:09:36.774
FORTY FOUR GUYS THAT WE TALK    
ABOUT OUR FORCES SO MUCH NOT    
OUR FERDY OK AND OUR FOUR D IS  

01:09:36.776 --> 01:09:37.508
ABOUT OUR FORCES SO MUCH NOT    
OUR FERDY OK AND OUR FOUR D IS  
THE AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE AND    

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:40.912
OUR FERDY OK AND OUR FOUR D IS  
THE AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE AND    
AGAIN THEY HAVEN&apos;T GONE THEY    

01:09:40.914 --> 01:09:41.679
THE AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE AND    
AGAIN THEY HAVEN&apos;T GONE THEY    
HAVEN&apos;T USED UP ALL THAT OPEN

THERE&apos;S STILL MORE OPEN SPACE   
THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO   
BUILD ON IF THEY WERE TO ADD
