AT THIS POINT IT DOES NOT LOOK  
LIKE THERE WILL BE A CONFLICT   

00:13:55.494 --> 00:13:56.293
AT THIS POINT IT DOES NOT LOOK  
LIKE THERE WILL BE A CONFLICT   
THOUGH THAT HUMAN RIGHTS

OF POLICE THE FIRST WEDNESDAY I 
BELIEVE AND ONE OF THE ISSUES   

01:23:34.569 --> 01:23:38.037
OF POLICE THE FIRST WEDNESDAY I 
BELIEVE AND ONE OF THE ISSUES   
THAT WE HAVE I THINK AT ONE     

01:23:38.039 --> 01:23:39.039
BELIEVE AND ONE OF THE ISSUES   
THAT WE HAVE I THINK AT ONE     
POINT WE WERE AS COMMISSION AND 

01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:42.342
THAT WE HAVE I THINK AT ONE     
POINT WE WERE AS COMMISSION AND 
MANAGERS WERE QUITE OPTIMISTIC  

01:23:42.344 --> 01:23:46.279
POINT WE WERE AS COMMISSION AND 
MANAGERS WERE QUITE OPTIMISTIC  
THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE THE       

01:23:46.281 --> 01:23:47.113
MANAGERS WERE QUITE OPTIMISTIC  
THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE THE       
REVIEWING ALL THE CASES BY THE  

01:23:47.115 --> 01:23:49.883
THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE THE       
REVIEWING ALL THE CASES BY THE  
END OF JUNE.                    

01:23:49.885 --> 01:23:53.520
REVIEWING ALL THE CASES BY THE  
END OF JUNE.                    
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T SEE THAT THIS IS    

01:23:53.522 --> 01:23:54.454
END OF JUNE.                    
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T SEE THAT THIS IS    
GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE 

01:23:54.456 --> 01:23:57.858
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T SEE THAT THIS IS    
GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE 
ONLY RECEIVED DOCUMENTS AND     

01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:01.994
GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE 
ONLY RECEIVED DOCUMENTS AND     
VIDEOS ON FEW CASES FROM TWENTY 

01:24:01.996 --> 01:24:05.865
ONLY RECEIVED DOCUMENTS AND     
VIDEOS ON FEW CASES FROM TWENTY 
TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY    

01:24:05.867 --> 01:24:06.500
VIDEOS ON FEW CASES FROM TWENTY 
TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY    
ONE THEY WERE THIRTY SEVEN      

01:24:06.502 --> 01:24:09.335
TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY    
ONE THEY WERE THIRTY SEVEN      
THIRTY SIX CASES AND I BELIEVE  

01:24:09.337 --> 01:24:12.739
ONE THEY WERE THIRTY SEVEN      
THIRTY SIX CASES AND I BELIEVE  
THAT WE HAVE INFORMATION        

01:24:12.741 --> 01:24:13.806
THIRTY SIX CASES AND I BELIEVE  
THAT WE HAVE INFORMATION        
DOCUMENTS ETC. ON UNDER TEN     

01:24:13.808 --> 01:24:21.114
THAT WE HAVE INFORMATION        
DOCUMENTS ETC. ON UNDER TEN     
OF THOSE ONES SO AND AT LEAST   

01:24:21.116 --> 01:24:24.984
DOCUMENTS ETC. ON UNDER TEN     
OF THOSE ONES SO AND AT LEAST   
OF THE CASES I REVIEWED THERE   

01:24:24.986 --> 01:24:25.818
OF THOSE ONES SO AND AT LEAST   
OF THE CASES I REVIEWED THERE   
WERE TWO CASES OR COMPLAINTS    

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:29.456
OF THE CASES I REVIEWED THERE   
WERE TWO CASES OR COMPLAINTS    
THAT ONE HAD SEVEN VIDEOS AND   

01:24:29.458 --> 01:24:33.026
WERE TWO CASES OR COMPLAINTS    
THAT ONE HAD SEVEN VIDEOS AND   
THE OTHER ONE HAD TEN AND IF    

01:24:33.028 --> 01:24:33.960
THAT ONE HAD SEVEN VIDEOS AND   
THE OTHER ONE HAD TEN AND IF    
YOU LOOK AT THE TIME THAT IS    

01:24:33.962 --> 01:24:37.263
THE OTHER ONE HAD TEN AND IF    
YOU LOOK AT THE TIME THAT IS    
NEEDED THAT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY WOULD BE 

01:24:37.265 --> 01:24:40.933
YOU LOOK AT THE TIME THAT IS    
NEEDED THAT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY WOULD BE 
CLOSE TO OVER SEVEN OR SO HOURS 

01:24:40.935 --> 01:24:45.339
NEEDED THAT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY WOULD BE 
CLOSE TO OVER SEVEN OR SO HOURS 
OF VIDEO TO REVIEW AND THERE    

01:24:45.341 --> 01:24:48.674
CLOSE TO OVER SEVEN OR SO HOURS 
OF VIDEO TO REVIEW AND THERE    
ARE SOME ISSUES WITH WHAT THE   

01:24:48.676 --> 01:24:51.911
OF VIDEO TO REVIEW AND THERE    
ARE SOME ISSUES WITH WHAT THE   
REST IS LIKE WHEN WE ARE GOING  

01:24:51.913 --> 01:24:52.712
ARE SOME ISSUES WITH WHAT THE   
REST IS LIKE WHEN WE ARE GOING  
TO RECEIVE DOCUMENTATIONS ON    

01:24:52.714 --> 01:24:56.115
REST IS LIKE WHEN WE ARE GOING  
TO RECEIVE DOCUMENTATIONS ON    
THE OTHER CASES.                

01:24:56.117 --> 01:24:59.986
TO RECEIVE DOCUMENTATIONS ON    
THE OTHER CASES.                
YEAH, SO THAT WOULD REALLY SLOW 

01:24:59.988 --> 01:25:02.756
THE OTHER CASES.                
YEAH, SO THAT WOULD REALLY SLOW 
US DOWN IN TERMS OF REVIEWING   

01:25:02.758 --> 01:25:03.156
YEAH, SO THAT WOULD REALLY SLOW 
US DOWN IN TERMS OF REVIEWING   
THE CASES.                      

01:25:03.158 --> 01:25:07.360
US DOWN IN TERMS OF REVIEWING   
THE CASES.                      
SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD  

01:25:07.362 --> 01:25:08.228
THE CASES.                      
SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD  
BE SOME KIND OF MECHANISM TO    

01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:11.130
SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD  
BE SOME KIND OF MECHANISM TO    
ACCELERATE THE INFORMATION      

01:25:11.132 --> 01:25:15.869
BE SOME KIND OF MECHANISM TO    
ACCELERATE THE INFORMATION      
COMING OUR WAY SO WE WILL HAVE  

01:25:15.871 --> 01:25:19.305
ACCELERATE THE INFORMATION      
COMING OUR WAY SO WE WILL HAVE  
A CHANCE TO REVIEW THEM IN A    

01:25:19.307 --> 01:25:19.940
COMING OUR WAY SO WE WILL HAVE  
A CHANCE TO REVIEW THEM IN A    
TIMELY FASHION AND REASONABLE   

01:25:19.942 --> 01:25:20.273
A CHANCE TO REVIEW THEM IN A    
TIMELY FASHION AND REASONABLE   
TIME.                           

01:25:20.275 --> 01:25:23.443
TIMELY FASHION AND REASONABLE   
TIME.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH SO THAT&amp;apos;S ONE OF THE    

01:25:23.445 --> 01:25:24.177
TIME.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH SO THAT&amp;apos;S ONE OF THE    
INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE    

01:25:24.179 --> 01:25:24.511
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH SO THAT&amp;apos;S ONE OF THE    
INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE    
ORDINANCE.                      

01:25:24.513 --> 01:25:25.912
INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE    
ORDINANCE.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE CAN REMIND THEM THAT THEY 

01:25:25.914 --> 01:25:26.913
ORDINANCE.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE CAN REMIND THEM THAT THEY 
MAY BE OUTSIDE OF THEIR THIRTY  

01:25:26.915 --> 01:25:27.647
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE CAN REMIND THEM THAT THEY 
MAY BE OUTSIDE OF THEIR THIRTY  
DAY WINDOW BUT THERE&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY 

01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:30.050
MAY BE OUTSIDE OF THEIR THIRTY  
DAY WINDOW BUT THERE&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY 
NO PUNISHMENT FOR THE POLICE IF 

01:25:30.052 --> 01:25:30.950
DAY WINDOW BUT THERE&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY 
NO PUNISHMENT FOR THE POLICE IF 
THEY IF THEY DON&amp;apos;T COMPLY WITH  

01:25:30.952 --> 01:25:31.284
NO PUNISHMENT FOR THE POLICE IF 
THEY IF THEY DON&amp;apos;T COMPLY WITH  
THAT.                           

01:25:31.286 --> 01:25:33.887
THEY IF THEY DON&amp;apos;T COMPLY WITH  
THAT.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE CAN CERTAINLY REMIND   

01:25:33.889 --> 01:25:34.520
THAT.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE CAN CERTAINLY REMIND   
THEM OF THAT.                   

01:25:34.522 --> 01:25:35.688
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE CAN CERTAINLY REMIND   
THEM OF THAT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WE NEED TO GET THE        

01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:38.558
THEM OF THAT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WE NEED TO GET THE        
ASSIGNMENTS TO THE POLICE SO    

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.492
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WE NEED TO GET THE        
ASSIGNMENTS TO THE POLICE SO    
THEY KNOW WHO TO GIVE THE CASES
