I THINK EVERYBODY IS AWARE      

00:13:06.676 --> 00:13:09.476
ITSELF.                         
I THINK EVERYBODY IS AWARE      
OF GENERALLY THE LOCATION BUT I 

00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:10.177
I THINK EVERYBODY IS AWARE      
OF GENERALLY THE LOCATION BUT I 
THINK THIS AREA IS PROBABLY     

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:11.045
OF GENERALLY THE LOCATION BUT I 
THINK THIS AREA IS PROBABLY     
VERY HELPFUL TO SEE AND TO GIVE 

00:13:11.047 --> 00:13:13.314
THINK THIS AREA IS PROBABLY     
VERY HELPFUL TO SEE AND TO GIVE 
IT A SENSE OF SCALE.            

00:13:13.316 --> 00:13:14.281
VERY HELPFUL TO SEE AND TO GIVE 
IT A SENSE OF SCALE.            
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A TIME WHEN 

00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:14.949
IT A SENSE OF SCALE.            
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A TIME WHEN 
THIS BUILDING COULD HAVE FELT   

00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:17.118
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A TIME WHEN 
THIS BUILDING COULD HAVE FELT   
LIKE IT WAS A LARGE BUILDING    

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.919
THIS BUILDING COULD HAVE FELT   
LIKE IT WAS A LARGE BUILDING    
THAT WAS OUT OF SCALE.          

00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:18.786
LIKE IT WAS A LARGE BUILDING    
THAT WAS OUT OF SCALE.          
BUT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD HAS       

00:13:18.788 --> 00:13:21.422
THAT WAS OUT OF SCALE.          
BUT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD HAS       
DRASTICALLY CHANGED AND WE'RE   

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:22.489
BUT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD HAS       
DRASTICALLY CHANGED AND WE'RE   
KIND OF RIGHT IN THE CENTER     

00:13:22.491 --> 00:13:23.324
DRASTICALLY CHANGED AND WE'RE   
KIND OF RIGHT IN THE CENTER     
OF ALL OF THAT HEIGHT AND I DO  

00:13:23.326 --> 00:13:25.760
KIND OF RIGHT IN THE CENTER     
OF ALL OF THAT HEIGHT AND I DO  
BELIEVE THAT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD  

00:13:25.762 --> 00:13:26.561
OF ALL OF THAT HEIGHT AND I DO  
BELIEVE THAT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD  
IS GOING TO EVOLVE EVEN MORE    

00:13:26.563 --> 00:13:27.294
BELIEVE THAT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD  
IS GOING TO EVOLVE EVEN MORE    
WITH ADDITIONAL HEIGHT GOING    

00:13:27.296 --> 00:13:27.561
IS GOING TO EVOLVE EVEN MORE    
WITH ADDITIONAL HEIGHT GOING    
AROUND IT.                      

00:13:27.563 --> 00:13:29.897
WITH ADDITIONAL HEIGHT GOING    
AROUND IT.                      
NOTHING WE'RE WORKING ON BUT    

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:30.664
AROUND IT.                      
NOTHING WE'RE WORKING ON BUT    
JUST BASED ON I THINK WE'RE     

00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:31.366
NOTHING WE'RE WORKING ON BUT    
JUST BASED ON I THINK WE'RE     
SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS      

00:13:31.368 --> 00:13:32.933
JUST BASED ON I THINK WE'RE     
SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS      
WOULD GO THE BUILDING DID GO    

00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:33.501
SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS      
WOULD GO THE BUILDING DID GO    
THROUGH DESIGN REVIEW.          

00:13:33.503 --> 00:13:37.105
WOULD GO THE BUILDING DID GO    
THROUGH DESIGN REVIEW.          
>> WE HAD A VERY GOOD MEETING   

00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:37.505
THROUGH DESIGN REVIEW.          
>> WE HAD A VERY GOOD MEETING   
WITH THEM.                      

00:13:37.507 --> 00:13:38.372
>> WE HAD A VERY GOOD MEETING   
WITH THEM.                      
THE SUGGESTIONS THAT CAME FROM  

00:13:38.374 --> 00:13:41.008
WITH THEM.                      
THE SUGGESTIONS THAT CAME FROM  
THEM WERE REALLY TO ARTICULATE  

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:41.743
THE SUGGESTIONS THAT CAME FROM  
THEM WERE REALLY TO ARTICULATE  
A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY WHAT  

00:13:41.745 --> 00:13:44.779
THEM WERE REALLY TO ARTICULATE  
A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY WHAT  
SOME OF THE MATERIALS ARE.      

00:13:44.781 --> 00:13:45.680
A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY WHAT  
SOME OF THE MATERIALS ARE.      
WE WENT BACK AND FORTH WITH     

00:13:45.682 --> 00:13:46.414
SOME OF THE MATERIALS ARE.      
WE WENT BACK AND FORTH WITH     
THAT I THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO   

00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:48.615
WE WENT BACK AND FORTH WITH     
THAT I THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO   
SEE IN THE RENDERINGS A LITTLE  

00:13:48.617 --> 00:13:49.350
THAT I THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO   
SEE IN THE RENDERINGS A LITTLE  
BIT MORE DETAIL THAT WE ADDED   

00:13:49.352 --> 00:13:52.887
SEE IN THE RENDERINGS A LITTLE  
BIT MORE DETAIL THAT WE ADDED   
TO THE LOWER BASE TO THE SOME   

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:53.854
BIT MORE DETAIL THAT WE ADDED   
TO THE LOWER BASE TO THE SOME   
OF THE STONE SORRY TO THE BRICK 

00:13:53.856 --> 00:13:56.024
TO THE LOWER BASE TO THE SOME   
OF THE STONE SORRY TO THE BRICK 
DETAILS AND OVERALL THE IDEA    

00:13:56.026 --> 00:13:59.960
OF THE STONE SORRY TO THE BRICK 
DETAILS AND OVERALL THE IDEA    
OF THE SCALE AND HOW WE WENT    

00:13:59.962 --> 00:14:00.761
DETAILS AND OVERALL THE IDEA    
OF THE SCALE AND HOW WE WENT    
AROUND THE ENTIRE BUILDING WAS  

00:14:00.763 --> 00:14:01.528
OF THE SCALE AND HOW WE WENT    
AROUND THE ENTIRE BUILDING WAS  
SOMETHING WE DID A GREAT DEAL   

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.331
AROUND THE ENTIRE BUILDING WAS  
SOMETHING WE DID A GREAT DEAL   
OF WORK AND HAD A VERY POSITIVE 

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:05.066
SOMETHING WE DID A GREAT DEAL   
OF WORK AND HAD A VERY POSITIVE 
MEETING THAT CAME FROM DESIGN   

00:14:05.068 --> 00:14:07.668
OF WORK AND HAD A VERY POSITIVE 
MEETING THAT CAME FROM DESIGN   
REVIEW.                         

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.602
MEETING THAT CAME FROM DESIGN   
REVIEW.                         
SO I THINK DESIGN REVIEW WAS    

00:14:08.604 --> 00:14:09.002
REVIEW.                         
SO I THINK DESIGN REVIEW WAS    
FANTASTIC.                      

00:14:09.004 --> 00:14:12.206
SO I THINK DESIGN REVIEW WAS    
FANTASTIC.                      
WE THEN KIND OF WENT FURTHER    

00:14:12.208 --> 00:14:13.007
FANTASTIC.                      
WE THEN KIND OF WENT FURTHER    
WITH THE PROJECT AND EVENTUALLY 

00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:15.676
WE THEN KIND OF WENT FURTHER    
WITH THE PROJECT AND EVENTUALLY 
I'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE  

00:14:15.678 --> 00:14:16.344
WITH THE PROJECT AND EVENTUALLY 
I'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE  
HAD OUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS BUT  

00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:19.547
I'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE  
HAD OUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS BUT  
THAT DID HAVE A BIG IMPACT.     

00:14:19.549 --> 00:14:20.614
HAD OUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS BUT  
THAT DID HAVE A BIG IMPACT.     
BUT THE BUILDING ITSELF IS IS   

00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:23.351
THAT DID HAVE A BIG IMPACT.     
BUT THE BUILDING ITSELF IS IS   
REALLY SOMEWHAT OF A UNIQUE     

00:14:23.353 --> 00:14:23.751
BUT THE BUILDING ITSELF IS IS   
REALLY SOMEWHAT OF A UNIQUE     
SITE.                           

00:14:23.753 --> 00:14:24.952
REALLY SOMEWHAT OF A UNIQUE     
SITE.                           
IT JUST SITS ON BASICALLY SOUTH 

00:14:24.954 --> 00:14:28.122
SITE.                           
IT JUST SITS ON BASICALLY SOUTH 
UNIVERSITY BUT IT DOES FEED     

00:14:28.124 --> 00:14:28.790
IT JUST SITS ON BASICALLY SOUTH 
UNIVERSITY BUT IT DOES FEED     
FROM THE ALLEY AT THE REAR.     

00:14:28.792 --> 00:14:30.992
UNIVERSITY BUT IT DOES FEED     
FROM THE ALLEY AT THE REAR.

KIND OF THAT CROWDED AREA IS    
LIFTED UP ON A FRAME SO THAT WE 

00:17:05.281 --> 00:17:08.282
KIND OF THAT CROWDED AREA IS    
LIFTED UP ON A FRAME SO THAT WE 
COULD PUT OUR MECHANICAL UNITS  

00:17:08.284 --> 00:17:09.117
LIFTED UP ON A FRAME SO THAT WE 
COULD PUT OUR MECHANICAL UNITS  
WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THAT       

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:09.784
COULD PUT OUR MECHANICAL UNITS  
WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THAT       
LITTLE SECTION DOWN IN THE      

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:12.486
WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THAT       
LITTLE SECTION DOWN IN THE      
LOWER HAND CORNER BELOW AND     

00:17:12.488 --> 00:17:13.253
LITTLE SECTION DOWN IN THE      
LOWER HAND CORNER BELOW AND     
THEN THE SOLAR PANELS SIT ON    

00:17:13.255 --> 00:17:14.054
LOWER HAND CORNER BELOW AND     
THEN THE SOLAR PANELS SIT ON    
BASICALLY A TRELLIS UP ABOVE.   

00:17:14.056 --> 00:17:17.024
THEN THE SOLAR PANELS SIT ON    
BASICALLY A TRELLIS UP ABOVE.   
WE'VE TRIED TO MAXIMIZE THAT AS 

00:17:17.026 --> 00:17:17.792
BASICALLY A TRELLIS UP ABOVE.   
WE'VE TRIED TO MAXIMIZE THAT AS 
MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THAT 

00:17:17.794 --> 00:17:20.795
WE'VE TRIED TO MAXIMIZE THAT AS 
MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THAT 
AREA AND THAT'S WE'VE COME UP   

00:17:20.797 --> 00:17:21.629
MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THAT 
AREA AND THAT'S WE'VE COME UP   
WITH THE NUMBER OF SOLAR PANELS 

00:17:21.631 --> 00:17:22.530
AREA AND THAT'S WE'VE COME UP   
WITH THE NUMBER OF SOLAR PANELS 
WE DO HAVE TO WORK WITH THE     

00:17:22.532 --> 00:17:24.898
WITH THE NUMBER OF SOLAR PANELS 
WE DO HAVE TO WORK WITH THE     
RIGIDITY OF THE SOLAR PANELS    

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.866
WE DO HAVE TO WORK WITH THE     
RIGIDITY OF THE SOLAR PANELS    
BUT THEY FIT I THINK VERY, VERY 

00:17:25.868 --> 00:17:26.100
RIGIDITY OF THE SOLAR PANELS    
BUT THEY FIT I THINK VERY, VERY 
WELL.                           

00:17:26.102 --> 00:17:29.237
BUT THEY FIT I THINK VERY, VERY 
WELL.                           
SO THIS WOULD BE A PRETTY DENSE 

00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:29.837
WELL.                           
SO THIS WOULD BE A PRETTY DENSE 
ROOFTOP OF SOLAR.               

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:31.772
SO THIS WOULD BE A PRETTY DENSE 
ROOFTOP OF SOLAR.               
WE DO MANY SPACE.               

00:17:31.774 --> 00:17:32.706
ROOFTOP OF SOLAR.               
WE DO MANY SPACE.               
I MEAN THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US.  

00:17:32.708 --> 00:17:33.774
WE DO MANY SPACE.               
I MEAN THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US.  
WE CAN'T PUT SOLAR OVER THAT    

00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:37.111
I MEAN THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US.  
WE CAN'T PUT SOLAR OVER THAT    
BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO HAVE SOME 

00:17:37.113 --> 00:17:37.745
WE CAN'T PUT SOLAR OVER THAT    
BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO HAVE SOME 
LIGHT OBVIOUSLY AROUND THE POOL 

00:17:37.747 --> 00:17:40.047
BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO HAVE SOME 
LIGHT OBVIOUSLY AROUND THE POOL 
AND THE PLACE IS THAT PEOPLE    

00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:40.814
LIGHT OBVIOUSLY AROUND THE POOL 
AND THE PLACE IS THAT PEOPLE    
WOULD SIT THERE DOES HAPPEN TO  

00:17:40.816 --> 00:17:41.349
AND THE PLACE IS THAT PEOPLE    
WOULD SIT THERE DOES HAPPEN TO  
BE A FEW LITTLE TRELLIS         

00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:43.617
WOULD SIT THERE DOES HAPPEN TO  
BE A FEW LITTLE TRELLIS         
STRUCTURES.                     

00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:44.518
BE A FEW LITTLE TRELLIS         
STRUCTURES.                     
WE TALKED ABOUT SOLAR ON THOSE  

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.385
STRUCTURES.                     
WE TALKED ABOUT SOLAR ON THOSE  
BUT IT WAS SO LIMITING THAT IT  

00:17:45.387 --> 00:17:48.021
WE TALKED ABOUT SOLAR ON THOSE  
BUT IT WAS SO LIMITING THAT IT  
JUST DIDN'T REALLY MAKE ANY     

00:17:48.023 --> 00:17:48.289
BUT IT WAS SO LIMITING THAT IT  
JUST DIDN'T REALLY MAKE ANY     
SENSE.                          

00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:49.189
JUST DIDN'T REALLY MAKE ANY     
SENSE.                          
THE UNITS I THINK WE ALREADY    

00:17:49.191 --> 00:17:52.126
SENSE.                          
THE UNITS I THINK WE ALREADY    
KIND TALKED ABOUT THE SIZE AND  

00:17:52.128 --> 00:17:52.793
THE UNITS I THINK WE ALREADY    
KIND TALKED ABOUT THE SIZE AND  
SCALE THE TOTAL PARKING MAY     

00:17:52.795 --> 00:17:53.427
KIND TALKED ABOUT THE SIZE AND  
SCALE THE TOTAL PARKING MAY     
HAVE BEEN MENTIONED.            

00:17:53.429 --> 00:17:56.029
SCALE THE TOTAL PARKING MAY     
HAVE BEEN MENTIONED.            
I'M SORRY I JUST DON'T REMEMBER 

00:17:56.031 --> 00:17:56.731
HAVE BEEN MENTIONED.            
I'M SORRY I JUST DON'T REMEMBER 
BUT THAT'S SEVENTY SEVEN SPACES 

00:17:56.733 --> 00:17:59.733
I'M SORRY I JUST DON'T REMEMBER 
BUT THAT'S SEVENTY SEVEN SPACES 
THE TOTAL HEIGHT IS BELOW THE   

00:17:59.735 --> 00:18:00.368
BUT THAT'S SEVENTY SEVEN SPACES 
THE TOTAL HEIGHT IS BELOW THE   
ONE NINETY FIVE WHICH IS        

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.337
THE TOTAL HEIGHT IS BELOW THE   
ONE NINETY FIVE WHICH IS        
PERMITTED AND IT'S SEVENTEEN    

00:18:03.339 --> 00:18:03.938
ONE NINETY FIVE WHICH IS        
PERMITTED AND IT'S SEVENTEEN    
DIFFERENT LEVELS AS WAS         

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.940
PERMITTED AND IT'S SEVENTEEN    
DIFFERENT LEVELS AS WAS         
EXPLAINED IT WAS AND DURING THE 

00:18:06.942 --> 00:18:07.675
DIFFERENT LEVELS AS WAS         
EXPLAINED IT WAS AND DURING THE 
PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS IT 

00:18:07.677 --> 00:18:08.476
EXPLAINED IT WAS AND DURING THE 
PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS IT 
WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE TALKED    

00:18:08.478 --> 00:18:11.078
PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS IT 
WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE TALKED    
ABOUT THE RAFAAT SO I JUST      

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.812
WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE TALKED    
ABOUT THE RAFAAT SO I JUST      
WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE    

00:18:11.814 --> 00:18:15.116
ABOUT THE RAFAAT SO I JUST      
WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE    
TOTAL ARE FOR THE PROJECT ENDED 

00:18:15.118 --> 00:18:15.783
WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE    
TOTAL ARE FOR THE PROJECT ENDED 
UP BEING TWELVE HUNDRED AND     

00:18:15.785 --> 00:18:17.484
TOTAL ARE FOR THE PROJECT ENDED 
UP BEING TWELVE HUNDRED AND     
EIGHTY THREE SQUARE FEET SO IF  

00:18:17.486 --> 00:18:18.418
UP BEING TWELVE HUNDRED AND     
EIGHTY THREE SQUARE FEET SO IF  
YOU GUYS REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE 

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.152
EIGHTY THREE SQUARE FEET SO IF  
YOU GUYS REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE 
TRYING TO MAXIMIZE FFR IN       

00:18:19.154 --> 00:18:22.089
YOU GUYS REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE 
TRYING TO MAXIMIZE FFR IN       
DISCUSSIONS THAT THAT DID A     

00:18:22.091 --> 00:18:22.589
TRYING TO MAXIMIZE FFR IN       
DISCUSSIONS THAT THAT DID A     
PRETTY GOOD JOB?                

00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:25.592
DISCUSSIONS THAT THAT DID A     
PRETTY GOOD JOB?                
I MEAN I THINK WE ACHIEVED KIND 

00:18:25.594 --> 00:18:26.460
PRETTY GOOD JOB?                
I MEAN I THINK WE ACHIEVED KIND 
OF WHAT YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT IS 

00:18:26.462 --> 00:18:27.294
I MEAN I THINK WE ACHIEVED KIND 
OF WHAT YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT IS 
A DIFFERENT WAY TO TALK TO A    

00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:28.062
OF WHAT YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT IS 
A DIFFERENT WAY TO TALK TO A    
PLANNING COMMISSION WHERE I'M   

00:18:28.064 --> 00:18:30.198
A DIFFERENT WAY TO TALK TO A    
PLANNING COMMISSION WHERE I'M   
ACTUALLY TRYING TO TELL YOU WE  

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:30.931
PLANNING COMMISSION WHERE I'M   
ACTUALLY TRYING TO TELL YOU WE  
ACHIEVED EXTRA F.R. BUT THAT    

00:18:30.933 --> 00:18:33.867
ACTUALLY TRYING TO TELL YOU WE  
ACHIEVED EXTRA F.R. BUT THAT    
WAS YOUR GOAL THE BUILDING THIS 

00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:34.701
ACHIEVED EXTRA F.R. BUT THAT    
WAS YOUR GOAL THE BUILDING THIS 
IS JUST SHOWING YOU THE         

00:18:34.703 --> 00:18:37.905
WAS YOUR GOAL THE BUILDING THIS 
IS JUST SHOWING YOU THE         
RENDERING FROM THE OUTSIDE      

00:18:37.907 --> 00:18:38.606
IS JUST SHOWING YOU THE         
RENDERING FROM THE OUTSIDE      
ARCHITECTURALLY WE WANTED TO    

00:18:38.608 --> 00:18:39.340
RENDERING FROM THE OUTSIDE      
ARCHITECTURALLY WE WANTED TO    
STRENGTHEN THAT CORNER THAT     

00:18:39.342 --> 00:18:41.108
ARCHITECTURALLY WE WANTED TO    
STRENGTHEN THAT CORNER THAT     
LOOK TO THE CAMPUS.             

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.042
STRENGTHEN THAT CORNER THAT     
LOOK TO THE CAMPUS.             
THOSE ARE BASICALLY UNITS AND   

00:18:42.044 --> 00:18:45.512
LOOK TO THE CAMPUS.             
THOSE ARE BASICALLY UNITS AND   
LIVING AREAS THAT'S SOMEWHAT    

00:18:45.514 --> 00:18:46.280
THOSE ARE BASICALLY UNITS AND   
LIVING AREAS THAT'S SOMEWHAT    
OF A GLASS WALL BASICALLY FLOOR 

00:18:46.282 --> 00:18:49.116
LIVING AREAS THAT'S SOMEWHAT    
OF A GLASS WALL BASICALLY FLOOR 
TO FLOOR GLASS THAT RUNS UP     

00:18:49.118 --> 00:18:49.717
OF A GLASS WALL BASICALLY FLOOR 
TO FLOOR GLASS THAT RUNS UP     
THAT ENTIRE CORNER.             

00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:50.384
TO FLOOR GLASS THAT RUNS UP     
THAT ENTIRE CORNER.             
THE BASE YOU'LL SEE NEXT.       

00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:53.087
THAT ENTIRE CORNER.             
THE BASE YOU'LL SEE NEXT.       
IT'S WHAT'S ALL BRICK.          

00:18:53.089 --> 00:18:54.255
THE BASE YOU'LL SEE NEXT.       
IT'S WHAT'S ALL BRICK.          
WE DIVIDE IT, WE GET UP ABOVE   

00:18:54.257 --> 00:18:56.823
IT'S WHAT'S ALL BRICK.          
WE DIVIDE IT, WE GET UP ABOVE   
WHICH IS NOT ONLY REQUIRED BY   

00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:57.658
WE DIVIDE IT, WE GET UP ABOVE   
WHICH IS NOT ONLY REQUIRED BY   
SOME OF THE ZONING RULES, IT    

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.228
WHICH IS NOT ONLY REQUIRED BY   
SOME OF THE ZONING RULES, IT    
WAS ALSO A REQUEST FROM DESIGN  

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.561
SOME OF THE ZONING RULES, IT    
WAS ALSO A REQUEST FROM DESIGN  
REVIEW.                         

00:19:01.563 --> 00:19:02.263
WAS ALSO A REQUEST FROM DESIGN  
REVIEW.                         
SO WE ADDRESS THAT THEY TALKED  

00:19:02.265 --> 00:19:04.231
REVIEW.                         
SO WE ADDRESS THAT THEY TALKED  
ABOUT SETTING THAT PIECE THAT   

00:19:04.233 --> 00:19:04.898
SO WE ADDRESS THAT THEY TALKED  
ABOUT SETTING THAT PIECE THAT   
SEPARATED THE TWO FROM THE      

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.634
ABOUT SETTING THAT PIECE THAT   
SEPARATED THE TWO FROM THE      
THREE STOREY BUILDING TO THE    

00:19:07.636 --> 00:19:08.269
SEPARATED THE TWO FROM THE      
THREE STOREY BUILDING TO THE    
UPPER HIGHER BUILDING WITH      

00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:09.136
THREE STOREY BUILDING TO THE    
UPPER HIGHER BUILDING WITH      
SOMETHING THAT COULD DELINEATED 

00:19:09.138 --> 00:19:12.172
UPPER HIGHER BUILDING WITH      
SOMETHING THAT COULD DELINEATED 
AND CLEARLY DIVIDE IT.          

00:19:12.174 --> 00:19:12.940
SOMETHING THAT COULD DELINEATED 
AND CLEARLY DIVIDE IT.          
SO WE'RE USING BLACK MIDDLE     

00:19:12.942 --> 00:19:15.742
AND CLEARLY DIVIDE IT.          
SO WE'RE USING BLACK MIDDLE     
PANEL FOR THAT AND THEN AS WE   

00:19:15.744 --> 00:19:16.877
SO WE'RE USING BLACK MIDDLE     
PANEL FOR THAT AND THEN AS WE   
GO UP YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHTER   

00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:19.179
PANEL FOR THAT AND THEN AS WE   
GO UP YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHTER   
SHADES OF GRAY AND THEN YOU SEE 

00:19:19.181 --> 00:19:20.014
GO UP YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHTER   
SHADES OF GRAY AND THEN YOU SEE 
THE RED BRICK COLOR THAT WRAPS  

00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:22.983
SHADES OF GRAY AND THEN YOU SEE 
THE RED BRICK COLOR THAT WRAPS  
AROUND THE REST OF THE          

00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:23.751
THE RED BRICK COLOR THAT WRAPS  
AROUND THE REST OF THE          
BUILDING, THE TOP OF THE        

00:19:23.753 --> 00:19:24.485
AROUND THE REST OF THE          
BUILDING, THE TOP OF THE        
BUILDING ON THE BACK SOUTH,     

00:19:24.487 --> 00:19:25.018
BUILDING, THE TOP OF THE        
BUILDING ON THE BACK SOUTH,     
EAST AND WEST.                  

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.821
BUILDING ON THE BACK SOUTH,     
EAST AND WEST.                  
YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A   

00:19:27.823 --> 00:19:28.222
EAST AND WEST.                  
YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A   
LANTERN UP THERE.               

00:19:28.224 --> 00:19:28.956
YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A   
LANTERN UP THERE.               
THOSE ARE THE AMENITY SPACES.   

00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:31.391
LANTERN UP THERE.               
THOSE ARE THE AMENITY SPACES.   
SO THAT TOP YOU SHOULD GLOW A   

00:19:31.393 --> 00:19:31.892
THOSE ARE THE AMENITY SPACES.   
SO THAT TOP YOU SHOULD GLOW A   
LITTLE BIT AT NIGHT.            

00:19:31.894 --> 00:19:34.594
SO THAT TOP YOU SHOULD GLOW A   
LITTLE BIT AT NIGHT.            
THIS GETS YOU A LITTLE CLOSER   

00:19:34.596 --> 00:19:35.296
LITTLE BIT AT NIGHT.            
THIS GETS YOU A LITTLE CLOSER   
TO THE STREET LEVEL.            

00:19:35.298 --> 00:19:36.263
THIS GETS YOU A LITTLE CLOSER   
TO THE STREET LEVEL.            
WE DID TRY TO STRENGTHEN THAT   

00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:38.866
TO THE STREET LEVEL.            
WE DID TRY TO STRENGTHEN THAT   
ENTRANCE INTO THE BUILDING BUT  

00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:39.800
WE DID TRY TO STRENGTHEN THAT   
ENTRANCE INTO THE BUILDING BUT  
STILL GIVE SOME ENTRY TO EACH   

00:19:39.802 --> 00:19:41.768
ENTRANCE INTO THE BUILDING BUT  
STILL GIVE SOME ENTRY TO EACH   
OF THE DIFFERENT RETAIL SPACES  

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.069
STILL GIVE SOME ENTRY TO EACH   
OF THE DIFFERENT RETAIL SPACES  
.                               

00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:43.003
OF THE DIFFERENT RETAIL SPACES  
.                               
YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY'RE DIVIDED 

00:19:43.005 --> 00:19:43.737
.                               
YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY'RE DIVIDED 
AND HAVE A METAL PANEL THAT     

00:19:43.739 --> 00:19:45.973
YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY'RE DIVIDED 
AND HAVE A METAL PANEL THAT     
WRAPS AROUND IT.                

00:19:45.975 --> 00:19:46.841
AND HAVE A METAL PANEL THAT     
WRAPS AROUND IT.                
THE BRICK IS PRETTY MUCH        

00:19:46.843 --> 00:19:47.574
WRAPS AROUND IT.                
THE BRICK IS PRETTY MUCH        
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK    

00:19:47.576 --> 00:19:49.976
THE BRICK IS PRETTY MUCH        
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK    
WE'D BE OUT OF CHARACTER WITH   

00:19:49.978 --> 00:19:50.645
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK    
WE'D BE OUT OF CHARACTER WITH   
WITH WHAT YOU'D SEE IN ANN      

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:51.312
WE'D BE OUT OF CHARACTER WITH   
WITH WHAT YOU'D SEE IN ANN      
ARBOR AND WE TRIED TO           

00:19:51.314 --> 00:19:54.314
WITH WHAT YOU'D SEE IN ANN      
ARBOR AND WE TRIED TO           
STRENGTHEN THAT WITH A FEW

A BIKE THE BIKE PARKING WAS     
MOVED TOWARDS THE BACK.         
IT'S JUST NOT UTILIZED AS

IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY AN ALLEY   
BUT IT'S KIND OF AN ALLEY AND   
SO THAT THAT IS THE GOAL AND I  

00:46:17.465 --> 00:46:18.463
BUT IT'S KIND OF AN ALLEY AND   
SO THAT THAT IS THE GOAL AND I  
THINK IT COULD ADD THAT I THINK 

00:46:18.465 --> 00:46:20.499
SO THAT THAT IS THE GOAL AND I  
THINK IT COULD ADD THAT I THINK 
I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY'S AWARE  

00:46:20.501 --> 00:46:21.400
THINK IT COULD ADD THAT I THINK 
I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY'S AWARE  
OF IT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE    

00:46:21.402 --> 00:46:22.200
I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY'S AWARE  
OF IT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE    
SLIDE THAT'S HERE RIGHT NOW,    

00:46:22.202 --> 00:46:26.071
OF IT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE    
SLIDE THAT'S HERE RIGHT NOW,    
BEHI THE KIND OF AREA WHERE THE 

00:46:26.073 --> 00:46:26.438
SLIDE THAT'S HERE RIGHT NOW,    
BEHI THE KIND OF AREA WHERE THE 
TRASH IS.                       

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.841
BEHI THE KIND OF AREA WHERE THE 
TRASH IS.                       
YEAH, THAT AREA HAS BEEN        

00:46:28.843 --> 00:46:32.477
TRASH IS.                       
YEAH, THAT AREA HAS BEEN        
SECURED NOW BY LANDMARK.        

00:46:32.479 --> 00:46:33.412
YEAH, THAT AREA HAS BEEN        
SECURED NOW BY LANDMARK.        
SO THEY EFFECTIVELY HAVE A      

00:46:33.414 --> 00:46:36.281
SECURED NOW BY LANDMARK.        
SO THEY EFFECTIVELY HAVE A      
PIECE OF LAND THAT THEY WERE    

00:46:36.283 --> 00:46:36.949
SO THEY EFFECTIVELY HAVE A      
PIECE OF LAND THAT THEY WERE    
PREVIOUSLY JUST GOING TO PUT    

00:46:36.951 --> 00:46:37.683
PIECE OF LAND THAT THEY WERE    
PREVIOUSLY JUST GOING TO PUT    
THEIR TRASH ON BUT NOW THEY     

00:46:37.685 --> 00:46:38.217
PREVIOUSLY JUST GOING TO PUT    
THEIR TRASH ON BUT NOW THEY     
ACTUALLY OWN IT.                

00:46:38.219 --> 00:46:40.219
THEIR TRASH ON BUT NOW THEY     
ACTUALLY OWN IT.                
THEY CAN'T BUILD ON IT BECAUSE  

00:46:40.221 --> 00:46:40.820
ACTUALLY OWN IT.                
THEY CAN'T BUILD ON IT BECAUSE  
THE CITY'S GOT A LOT            

00:46:40.822 --> 00:46:43.522
THEY CAN'T BUILD ON IT BECAUSE  
THE CITY'S GOT A LOT            
OF INFRASTRUCTURE UNDERNEATH.   

00:46:43.524 --> 00:46:44.456
THE CITY'S GOT A LOT            
OF INFRASTRUCTURE UNDERNEATH.   
THEY MIGHT BE BUILT ON THE      

00:46:44.458 --> 00:46:45.223
OF INFRASTRUCTURE UNDERNEATH.   
THEY MIGHT BE BUILT ON THE      
EASTERN HALF OR A FOOT OR       

00:46:45.225 --> 00:46:48.093
THEY MIGHT BE BUILT ON THE      
EASTERN HALF OR A FOOT OR       
SOMETHING BUT SO THAT DOES GIVE 

00:46:48.095 --> 00:46:48.894
EASTERN HALF OR A FOOT OR       
SOMETHING BUT SO THAT DOES GIVE 
WAY MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN WE    

00:46:48.896 --> 00:46:51.864
SOMETHING BUT SO THAT DOES GIVE 
WAY MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN WE    
HAD BEFORE FOR A POTENTIAL

THE INTENT THE IDEA FOR SURE    
OF TRYING TO GET MORE AND MORE  
LOADING ON THE FRONT IS         

00:47:00.408 --> 00:47:01.240
OF TRYING TO GET MORE AND MORE  
LOADING ON THE FRONT IS         
SOMETHING WE FOUGHT WITH AND    

00:47:01.242 --> 00:47:03.976
LOADING ON THE FRONT IS         
SOMETHING WE FOUGHT WITH AND

OF THE SITE IS A BUS STOP.      
SO THIS WOULD CONNECT INTO THE  
TRANSIT CENTER AS WELL THEN     

01:15:10.062 --> 01:15:10.795
SO THIS WOULD CONNECT INTO THE  
TRANSIT CENTER AS WELL THEN

ON ALL OF THESE BECAUSE I THINK 
A LOT OF DIFFERENT              

01:39:36.661 --> 01:39:37.392
ON ALL OF THESE BECAUSE I THINK 
A LOT OF DIFFERENT              
COMMISSIONERS' AWESOME POINTS   

01:39:37.394 --> 01:39:39.027
A LOT OF DIFFERENT              
COMMISSIONERS' AWESOME POINTS   
HERE.                           

01:39:39.029 --> 01:39:40.095
COMMISSIONERS' AWESOME POINTS   
HERE.                           
SO I'LL START WITH THE LAST ONE 

01:39:40.097 --> 01:39:43.132
HERE.                           
SO I'LL START WITH THE LAST ONE 
BEING THE STORAGE COMPONENT     

01:39:43.134 --> 01:39:43.399
SO I'LL START WITH THE LAST ONE 
BEING THE STORAGE COMPONENT     
OF THIS.                        

01:39:43.401 --> 01:39:44.500
BEING THE STORAGE COMPONENT     
OF THIS.                        
SO THIS IS A THIS IS SOMETHING  

01:39:44.502 --> 01:39:45.334
OF THIS.                        
SO THIS IS A THIS IS SOMETHING  
THAT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY DO OUR  

01:39:45.336 --> 01:39:47.737
SO THIS IS A THIS IS SOMETHING  
THAT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY DO OUR  
BEST TO WORK INTO THIS AND      

01:39:47.739 --> 01:39:48.537
THAT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY DO OUR  
BEST TO WORK INTO THIS AND      
WHERE MY MIND HAS BEEN GOING    

01:39:48.539 --> 01:39:51.073
BEST TO WORK INTO THIS AND      
WHERE MY MIND HAS BEEN GOING    
DURING THESE CONVERSATIONS IT'S 

01:39:51.075 --> 01:39:52.007
WHERE MY MIND HAS BEEN GOING    
DURING THESE CONVERSATIONS IT'S 
ALWAYS HARD TO USE THE          

01:39:52.009 --> 01:39:54.943
DURING THESE CONVERSATIONS IT'S 
ALWAYS HARD TO USE THE          
DEAD CORNERS IN THE INSIDE      

01:39:54.945 --> 01:39:55.945
ALWAYS HARD TO USE THE          
DEAD CORNERS IN THE INSIDE      
OF OF A AL BUILDING LIKE THIS.  

01:39:55.947 --> 01:39:57.012
DEAD CORNERS IN THE INSIDE      
OF OF A AL BUILDING LIKE THIS.  
SO THAT'S WHY WE PUT THE        

01:39:57.014 --> 01:39:59.481
OF OF A AL BUILDING LIKE THIS.  
SO THAT'S WHY WE PUT THE        
ELEVATOR CORE THERE.            

01:39:59.483 --> 01:40:00.483
SO THAT'S WHY WE PUT THE        
ELEVATOR CORE THERE.            
NOT ONLY IS IT THE MOST EASY    

01:40:00.485 --> 01:40:03.686
ELEVATOR CORE THERE.            
NOT ONLY IS IT THE MOST EASY    
FOR FOLKS TO COME INTO THE      

01:40:03.688 --> 01:40:04.453
NOT ONLY IS IT THE MOST EASY    
FOR FOLKS TO COME INTO THE      
MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING AND THEN 

01:40:04.455 --> 01:40:05.254
FOR FOLKS TO COME INTO THE      
MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING AND THEN 
BRANCH OUT TO THEIR APARTMENTS  

01:40:05.256 --> 01:40:05.654
MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING AND THEN 
BRANCH OUT TO THEIR APARTMENTS  
BUT IT'S DARK.                  

01:40:05.656 --> 01:40:07.055
BRANCH OUT TO THEIR APARTMENTS  
BUT IT'S DARK.                  
YOU DON'T GET THE NATURAL LIGHT 

01:40:07.057 --> 01:40:08.290
BUT IT'S DARK.                  
YOU DON'T GET THE NATURAL LIGHT 
THAT YOU WANT TO TO COME INTO A 

01:40:08.292 --> 01:40:08.925
YOU DON'T GET THE NATURAL LIGHT 
THAT YOU WANT TO TO COME INTO A 
LOT OF DIFFERENT APARTMENTS.    

01:40:08.927 --> 01:40:10.659
THAT YOU WANT TO TO COME INTO A 
LOT OF DIFFERENT APARTMENTS.    
SO WITH THAT SAID, THESE        

01:40:10.661 --> 01:40:11.660
LOT OF DIFFERENT APARTMENTS.    
SO WITH THAT SAID, THESE        
ELEVATOR CORDS HERE HAVE A LOT  

01:40:11.662 --> 01:40:14.530
SO WITH THAT SAID, THESE        
ELEVATOR CORDS HERE HAVE A LOT  
OF ADDITIONAL SPACE AROUND      

01:40:14.532 --> 01:40:14.764
ELEVATOR CORDS HERE HAVE A LOT  
OF ADDITIONAL SPACE AROUND      
THEM.                           

01:40:14.766 --> 01:40:15.564
OF ADDITIONAL SPACE AROUND      
THEM.                           
SO IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT   

01:40:15.566 --> 01:40:18.267
THEM.                           
SO IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT   
I'VE DONE IN A LOT OF IT'S      

01:40:18.269 --> 01:40:19.168
SO IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT   
I'VE DONE IN A LOT OF IT'S      
THESE DEAD CORNERS THAT WE CAN  

01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:19.969
I'VE DONE IN A LOT OF IT'S      
THESE DEAD CORNERS THAT WE CAN  
TEND TO WORK SOME OF THESE MORE 

01:40:19.971 --> 01:40:22.271
THESE DEAD CORNERS THAT WE CAN  
TEND TO WORK SOME OF THESE MORE 
STORAGE UNITS.                  

01:40:22.273 --> 01:40:23.172
TEND TO WORK SOME OF THESE MORE 
STORAGE UNITS.                  
SO IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.     

01:40:23.174 --> 01:40:24.039
STORAGE UNITS.                  
SO IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.     
THIS IS AS FAR AS OUR           

01:40:24.041 --> 01:40:26.342
SO IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.     
THIS IS AS FAR AS OUR           
ARCHITECTURE HAS GONE AT THIS   

01:40:26.344 --> 01:40:26.675
THIS IS AS FAR AS OUR           
ARCHITECTURE HAS GONE AT THIS   
POINT.                          

01:40:26.677 --> 01:40:27.676
ARCHITECTURE HAS GONE AT THIS   
POINT.                          
SO IT'S A PERFECT TIME TO START 

01:40:27.678 --> 01:40:29.545
POINT.                          
SO IT'S A PERFECT TIME TO START 
TAKING A LOOK AT THAT AS WELL   

01:40:29.547 --> 01:40:30.412
SO IT'S A PERFECT TIME TO START 
TAKING A LOOK AT THAT AS WELL   
AS INTO THE UNITS THEMSELVES.   

01:40:30.414 --> 01:40:30.946
TAKING A LOOK AT THAT AS WELL   
AS INTO THE UNITS THEMSELVES.   
SO EXCELLENT POINT.             

01:40:30.948 --> 01:40:32.748
AS INTO THE UNITS THEMSELVES.   
SO EXCELLENT POINT.             
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WE CAN 

01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:37.520
SO EXCELLENT POINT.             
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WE CAN 
DO TO MAXIMIZE THAT WITH THE    

01:40:37.522 --> 01:40:40.455
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WE CAN 
DO TO MAXIMIZE THAT WITH THE    
FINANCING THROUGH MISHNA.       

01:40:40.457 --> 01:40:41.523
DO TO MAXIMIZE THAT WITH THE    
FINANCING THROUGH MISHNA.       
THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET REALLY 

01:40:41.525 --> 01:40:44.627
FINANCING THROUGH MISHNA.       
THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET REALLY 
CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT'S I LIKE 

01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:45.361
THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET REALLY 
CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT'S I LIKE 
TO THINK OF THESE THINGS AS     

01:40:45.363 --> 01:40:46.161
CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT'S I LIKE 
TO THINK OF THESE THINGS AS     
JUST A SERIES OF LEVERS WHERE I 

01:40:46.163 --> 01:40:48.364
TO THINK OF THESE THINGS AS     
JUST A SERIES OF LEVERS WHERE I 
PUSH ONE UP AND I PUSH ONE DOWN 

01:40:48.366 --> 01:40:48.564
JUST A SERIES OF LEVERS WHERE I 
PUSH ONE UP AND I PUSH ONE DOWN 
.                               

01:40:48.566 --> 01:40:49.765
PUSH ONE UP AND I PUSH ONE DOWN 
.                               
>> I'VE GOT TO KIND OF GET THIS 

01:40:49.767 --> 01:40:50.499
.                               
>> I'VE GOT TO KIND OF GET THIS 
TO BALANCE BECAUSE IT IS SO     

01:40:50.501 --> 01:40:52.834
>> I'VE GOT TO KIND OF GET THIS 
TO BALANCE BECAUSE IT IS SO     
COMPETITIVE, SO THE THE BEST    

01:40:52.836 --> 01:40:53.902
TO BALANCE BECAUSE IT IS SO     
COMPETITIVE, SO THE THE BEST    
WAY FOR OUR NUMBERS TO WORK THE 

01:40:53.904 --> 01:40:57.072
COMPETITIVE, SO THE THE BEST    
WAY FOR OUR NUMBERS TO WORK THE 
BEST IS TO MAXIMIZE THE UNIT    

01:40:57.074 --> 01:40:57.406
WAY FOR OUR NUMBERS TO WORK THE 
BEST IS TO MAXIMIZE THE UNIT    
COUNT.                          

01:40:57.408 --> 01:40:58.207
BEST IS TO MAXIMIZE THE UNIT    
COUNT.                          
SO BACK TO THE CONVERSATION     

01:40:58.209 --> 01:40:59.408
COUNT.                          
SO BACK TO THE CONVERSATION     
OF CAN WE GO HIGHER?            

01:40:59.410 --> 01:41:00.676
SO BACK TO THE CONVERSATION     
OF CAN WE GO HIGHER?            
I WOULD LOVE TO BUT GOING       

01:41:00.678 --> 01:41:03.913
OF CAN WE GO HIGHER?            
I WOULD LOVE TO BUT GOING       
HIGHER CHANGED OUR CONSTRUCTION 

01:41:03.915 --> 01:41:04.246
I WOULD LOVE TO BUT GOING       
HIGHER CHANGED OUR CONSTRUCTION 
TYPES.                          

01:41:04.248 --> 01:41:05.180
HIGHER CHANGED OUR CONSTRUCTION 
TYPES.                          
SO WE'RE CURRENTLY IN A WOOD    

01:41:05.182 --> 01:41:07.783
TYPES.                          
SO WE'RE CURRENTLY IN A WOOD    
FRAME BUILDING TYPE.            

01:41:07.785 --> 01:41:08.851
SO WE'RE CURRENTLY IN A WOOD    
FRAME BUILDING TYPE.            
IF WE WERE TO GO HIGHER ALL     

01:41:08.853 --> 01:41:09.585
FRAME BUILDING TYPE.            
IF WE WERE TO GO HIGHER ALL     
OF A SUDDEN WE'RE INTO STEEL    

01:41:09.587 --> 01:41:11.520
IF WE WERE TO GO HIGHER ALL     
OF A SUDDEN WE'RE INTO STEEL    
AND CONCRETE.                   

01:41:11.522 --> 01:41:12.522
OF A SUDDEN WE'RE INTO STEEL    
AND CONCRETE.                   
IT'S PUSHING OUR COST UP AND    

01:41:12.524 --> 01:41:15.291
AND CONCRETE.                   
IT'S PUSHING OUR COST UP AND    
IT'S KIND OF WHAT I SAID ABOUT  

01:41:15.293 --> 01:41:15.958
IT'S PUSHING OUR COST UP AND    
IT'S KIND OF WHAT I SAID ABOUT  
BALANCING THOSE LEVERS.         

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:16.959
IT'S KIND OF WHAT I SAID ABOUT  
BALANCING THOSE LEVERS.         
WE'RE TRADING ONE FOR THE OTHER 

01:41:16.961 --> 01:41:20.095
BALANCING THOSE LEVERS.         
WE'RE TRADING ONE FOR THE OTHER 
SO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE    

01:41:20.097 --> 01:41:20.495
WE'RE TRADING ONE FOR THE OTHER 
SO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE    
UNITS HERE.                     

01:41:20.497 --> 01:41:21.163
SO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE    
UNITS HERE.                     
MY NUMBERS WILL WORK MUCH       

01:41:21.165 --> 01:41:22.364
UNITS HERE.                     
MY NUMBERS WILL WORK MUCH       
BETTER IF I COULD HAVE MORE     

01:41:22.366 --> 01:41:23.366
MY NUMBERS WILL WORK MUCH       
BETTER IF I COULD HAVE MORE     
UNITS HERE BUT THE REALITY IS I 

01:41:23.368 --> 01:41:27.502
BETTER IF I COULD HAVE MORE     
UNITS HERE BUT THE REALITY IS I 
CAN'T BALANCE IT.               

01:41:27.504 --> 01:41:28.171
UNITS HERE BUT THE REALITY IS I 
CAN'T BALANCE IT.               
>> IT DOESN'T WORK.             

01:41:28.173 --> 01:41:31.506
CAN'T BALANCE IT.               
>> IT DOESN'T WORK.             
BUT THAT SAID, GETTING INTO I   

01:41:31.508 --> 01:41:32.408
>> IT DOESN'T WORK.             
BUT THAT SAID, GETTING INTO I   
THINK THAT KIND OF PLAYS INTO   

01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:33.142
BUT THAT SAID, GETTING INTO I   
THINK THAT KIND OF PLAYS INTO   
THE PARKING QUESTION THAT THAT  

01:41:33.144 --> 01:41:35.411
THINK THAT KIND OF PLAYS INTO   
THE PARKING QUESTION THAT THAT  
CAME UP HERE MR. DOES REQUIRE   

01:41:35.413 --> 01:41:38.547
THE PARKING QUESTION THAT THAT  
CAME UP HERE MR. DOES REQUIRE   
THE TWO TO ONE PARKING RATIO    

01:41:38.549 --> 01:41:39.482
CAME UP HERE MR. DOES REQUIRE   
THE TWO TO ONE PARKING RATIO    
BUT YOU CAN REQUEST A WAIVER    

01:41:39.484 --> 01:41:39.948
THE TWO TO ONE PARKING RATIO    
BUT YOU CAN REQUEST A WAIVER    
FOR THOSE.                      

01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:42.618
BUT YOU CAN REQUEST A WAIVER    
FOR THOSE.                      
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND I      

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.519
FOR THOSE.                      
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND I      
DON'T HAVE IT LOCKED UP YET BUT 

01:41:43.521 --> 01:41:44.420
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND I      
DON'T HAVE IT LOCKED UP YET BUT 
WE'VE REQUESTED A WAIVER TO GO  

01:41:44.422 --> 01:41:46.655
DON'T HAVE IT LOCKED UP YET BUT 
WE'VE REQUESTED A WAIVER TO GO  
FROM TWO TO ONE DOWN TO ONE TO  

01:41:46.657 --> 01:41:47.089
WE'VE REQUESTED A WAIVER TO GO  
FROM TWO TO ONE DOWN TO ONE TO  
ONE.                            

01:41:47.091 --> 01:41:47.924
FROM TWO TO ONE DOWN TO ONE TO  
ONE.                            
SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SEVENTY   

01:41:47.926 --> 01:41:48.690
ONE.                            
SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SEVENTY   
SPACES HERE WITH SIXTY SIX      

01:41:48.692 --> 01:41:50.926
SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SEVENTY   
SPACES HERE WITH SIXTY SIX

WITH TRANSPORTATION             

01:53:59.556 --> 01:54:00.355
GOING TO HAVE TO WORK THROUGH   
WITH TRANSPORTATION             
ENGINEERING'S JUST TO ACCESS    

01:54:00.357 --> 01:54:03.091
WITH TRANSPORTATION             
ENGINEERING'S JUST TO ACCESS    
THE SITE PERIOD.                

01:54:03.093 --> 01:54:04.126
ENGINEERING'S JUST TO ACCESS    
THE SITE PERIOD.                
BUT THEN WE DON'T WANT TO       

01:54:04.128 --> 01:54:04.926
THE SITE PERIOD.                
BUT THEN WE DON'T WANT TO       
DESIGN THIS STRICTLY FOR CARS   

01:54:04.928 --> 01:54:06.394
BUT THEN WE DON'T WANT TO       
DESIGN THIS STRICTLY FOR CARS   
AND THAT PROCESS THAT IS THE    

01:54:06.396 --> 01:54:07.061
DESIGN THIS STRICTLY FOR CARS   
AND THAT PROCESS THAT IS THE    
OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THAT        

01:54:07.063 --> 01:54:07.796
AND THAT PROCESS THAT IS THE    
OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THAT        
DISCUSSION BROADER TO SAY HOW   

01:54:07.798 --> 01:54:10.431
OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THAT        
DISCUSSION BROADER TO SAY HOW   
DO WE MAKE THIS MUCH MORE       

01:54:10.433 --> 01:54:10.799
DISCUSSION BROADER TO SAY HOW   
DO WE MAKE THIS MUCH MORE       
COMPREHENSIVE?                  

01:54:10.801 --> 01:54:11.866
DO WE MAKE THIS MUCH MORE       
COMPREHENSIVE?                  
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD MIDLAKE  

01:54:11.868 --> 01:54:14.836
COMPREHENSIVE?                  
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD MIDLAKE  
SPOT, NOT A TRAFFIC ENGINEER.   

01:54:14.838 --> 01:54:18.106
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD MIDLAKE  
SPOT, NOT A TRAFFIC ENGINEER.   
SO I'M GOING TO ARGUE FOR THAT  

01:54:18.108 --> 01:54:18.774
SPOT, NOT A TRAFFIC ENGINEER.   
SO I'M GOING TO ARGUE FOR THAT  
AND IT PROBABLY WARRANTS        

01:54:18.776 --> 01:54:21.643
SO I'M GOING TO ARGUE FOR THAT  
AND IT PROBABLY WARRANTS        
SIGNALIZATION AT LOCATION AS    

01:54:21.645 --> 01:54:21.976
AND IT PROBABLY WARRANTS        
SIGNALIZATION AT LOCATION AS    
WELL.                           

01:54:21.978 --> 01:54:22.711
SIGNALIZATION AT LOCATION AS    
WELL.                           
I THINK THAT'S THE SAFEST WAY   

01:54:22.713 --> 01:54:25.347
WELL.                           
I THINK THAT'S THE SAFEST WAY   
FOR FOLKS TO CROSS MID BLOCK.   

01:54:25.349 --> 01:54:26.481
I THINK THAT'S THE SAFEST WAY   
FOR FOLKS TO CROSS MID BLOCK.   
I'D BE VERY NERVOUS OF JUST     

01:54:26.483 --> 01:54:27.215
FOR FOLKS TO CROSS MID BLOCK.   
I'D BE VERY NERVOUS OF JUST     
KIND OF THE ZEBRA STRIPES ON    

01:54:27.217 --> 01:54:29.351
I'D BE VERY NERVOUS OF JUST     
KIND OF THE ZEBRA STRIPES ON    
STATE STREET.                   

01:54:29.353 --> 01:54:30.419
KIND OF THE ZEBRA STRIPES ON    
STATE STREET.                   
YEAH, IT SEEMS THAT DISASTER    

01:54:30.421 --> 01:54:33.355
STATE STREET.                   
YEAH, IT SEEMS THAT DISASTER    
WAITING TO HAPPEN.              

01:54:33.357 --> 01:54:34.456
YEAH, IT SEEMS THAT DISASTER    
WAITING TO HAPPEN.              
BUT THE OTHER REASON WHY I      

01:54:34.458 --> 01:54:36.991
WAITING TO HAPPEN.              
BUT THE OTHER REASON WHY I      
THINK FULL SIGNAL INTERSECTION  

01:54:36.993 --> 01:54:41.263
BUT THE OTHER REASON WHY I      
THINK FULL SIGNAL INTERSECTION  
HERE AND PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIONS 

01:54:41.265 --> 01:54:42.063
THINK FULL SIGNAL INTERSECTION  
HERE AND PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIONS 
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IS WE      

01:54:42.065 --> 01:54:44.433
HERE AND PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIONS 
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IS WE      
TALKED ABOUT THE BUS STOP HERE  

01:54:44.435 --> 01:54:45.500
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IS WE      
TALKED ABOUT THE BUS STOP HERE  
ON THE NORTHBOUND SIDE OF STATE 

01:54:45.502 --> 01:54:48.302
TALKED ABOUT THE BUS STOP HERE  
ON THE NORTHBOUND SIDE OF STATE 
STREET FOLKS WHO ARE COMING     

01:54:48.304 --> 01:54:48.970
ON THE NORTHBOUND SIDE OF STATE 
STREET FOLKS WHO ARE COMING     
BACK IF THEY'RE WORKING         

01:54:48.972 --> 01:54:49.704
STREET FOLKS WHO ARE COMING     
BACK IF THEY'RE WORKING         
DOWNTOWN THEY GET OFF ON THE    

01:54:49.706 --> 01:54:50.372
BACK IF THEY'RE WORKING         
DOWNTOWN THEY GET OFF ON THE    
OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.       

01:54:50.374 --> 01:54:53.041
DOWNTOWN THEY GET OFF ON THE    
OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.       
SO HOW DO THEY GET ACROSS AND   

01:54:53.043 --> 01:54:53.875
OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.       
SO HOW DO THEY GET ACROSS AND   
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING  

01:54:53.877 --> 01:54:56.411
SO HOW DO THEY GET ACROSS AND   
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING  
TO DO.                          

01:54:56.413 --> 01:54:57.278
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING  
TO DO.

THEY'RE GOING TO FROGGER THEIR  
WAY ACROSS.                     

01:54:59.483 --> 01:55:03.986
THEY'RE GOING TO FROGGER THEIR  
WAY ACROSS.                     
SO SO SO THIS IS A BIGGER       

01:55:03.988 --> 01:55:04.786
WAY ACROSS.                     
SO SO SO THIS IS A BIGGER       
DISCUSSION BUT I THINK IT'S     

01:55:04.788 --> 01:55:08.122
SO SO SO THIS IS A BIGGER       
DISCUSSION BUT I THINK IT'S     
TOTALLY WARRANTED AND THIS IS   

01:55:08.124 --> 01:55:08.857
DISCUSSION BUT I THINK IT'S     
TOTALLY WARRANTED AND THIS IS   
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO  

01:55:08.859 --> 01:55:11.860
TOTALLY WARRANTED AND THIS IS   
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO  
GET OUR ENGINEERS AND CITIES    

01:55:11.862 --> 01:55:12.660
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO  
GET OUR ENGINEERS AND CITIES    
ENGINEERS TOGETHER AND TRY TO   

01:55:12.662 --> 01:55:18.433
GET OUR ENGINEERS AND CITIES    
ENGINEERS TOGETHER AND TRY TO   
SOLVE THAT THE PERMEABLE        

01:55:18.435 --> 01:55:18.833
ENGINEERS TOGETHER AND TRY TO   
SOLVE THAT THE PERMEABLE        
PARKING.                        

01:55:18.835 --> 01:55:19.700
SOLVE THAT THE PERMEABLE        
PARKING.                        
I'VE DONE THIS ON OTHER         

01:55:19.702 --> 01:55:20.301
PARKING.                        
I'VE DONE THIS ON OTHER         
PROJECTS BUT NOT IN THE         

01:55:20.303 --> 01:55:22.770
I'VE DONE THIS ON OTHER         
PROJECTS BUT NOT IN THE         
AFFORDABLE SPACE MAINLY JUST    

01:55:22.772 --> 01:55:23.438
PROJECTS BUT NOT IN THE         
AFFORDABLE SPACE MAINLY JUST    
BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO        

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.472
AFFORDABLE SPACE MAINLY JUST    
BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO        
BALANCE THINGS ON THE HEAD OF A 

01:55:24.474 --> 01:55:26.608
BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO        
BALANCE THINGS ON THE HEAD OF A 
NEEDLE.                         

01:55:26.610 --> 01:55:27.676
BALANCE THINGS ON THE HEAD OF A 
NEEDLE.                         
SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.    

01:55:27.678 --> 01:55:30.545
NEEDLE.                         
SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.    
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE I'M      

01:55:30.547 --> 01:55:31.613
SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.    
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE I'M      
GOING TO PUT IN THE BASKET I    

01:55:31.615 --> 01:55:32.547
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE I'M      
GOING TO PUT IN THE BASKET I    
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DO IF THE  

01:55:32.549 --> 01:55:36.751
GOING TO PUT IN THE BASKET I    
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DO IF THE  
NUMBERS CAN SUPPORT IT.         

01:55:36.753 --> 01:55:37.652
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DO IF THE  
NUMBERS CAN SUPPORT IT.         
THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY THE THE   

01:55:37.654 --> 01:55:38.453
NUMBERS CAN SUPPORT IT.         
THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY THE THE   
NAME OF THE GAME WITH THE       

01:55:38.455 --> 01:55:41.122
THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY THE THE   
NAME OF THE GAME WITH THE       
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PIECE IS     

01:55:41.124 --> 01:55:41.856
NAME OF THE GAME WITH THE       
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PIECE IS     
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT WHAT CAN I FIT 

01:55:41.858 --> 01:55:44.559
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PIECE IS     
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT WHAT CAN I FIT 
AND STILL MAKE THIS WORK        

01:55:44.561 --> 01:55:45.560
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT WHAT CAN I FIT 
AND STILL MAKE THIS WORK        
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE A MARKET  

01:55:45.562 --> 01:55:46.361
AND STILL MAKE THIS WORK        
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE A MARKET  
DEVELOPMENT WHERE I COULD JUST  

01:55:46.363 --> 01:55:47.829
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE A MARKET  
DEVELOPMENT WHERE I COULD JUST  
CHARGE MORE RENT AND MAKE IT SO 

01:55:47.831 --> 01:55:51.933
DEVELOPMENT WHERE I COULD JUST  
CHARGE MORE RENT AND MAKE IT SO 
I THINK IT'S THERE ANY SORT     

01:55:51.935 --> 01:55:52.901
CHARGE MORE RENT AND MAKE IT SO 
I THINK IT'S THERE ANY SORT     
OF WE DON'T HAVE ANY SORT       

01:55:52.903 --> 01:55:55.937
I THINK IT'S THERE ANY SORT     
OF WE DON'T HAVE ANY SORT       
OF COVERING OR CARPORTS OR      

01:55:55.939 --> 01:55:56.537
OF WE DON'T HAVE ANY SORT       
OF COVERING OR CARPORTS OR      
ANYTHING OVER THESE.            

01:55:56.539 --> 01:55:57.371
OF COVERING OR CARPORTS OR      
ANYTHING OVER THESE.            
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN 

01:55:57.373 --> 01:56:00.375
ANYTHING OVER THESE.            
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN 
EXPLORE AS WELL ON THE SOLAR    

01:56:00.377 --> 01:56:00.909
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN 
EXPLORE AS WELL ON THE SOLAR    
SIDE OF THINGS.                 

01:56:00.911 --> 01:56:02.844
EXPLORE AS WELL ON THE SOLAR    
SIDE OF THINGS.                 
>> CAN WE COVER ?               

01:56:02.846 --> 01:56:04.246

LOOK AT THAT.                   

01:56:06.883 --> 01:56:07.649
YEAH, WE CAN WE CAN TAKE A HARD 
LOOK AT THAT.                   
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE          

01:56:07.651 --> 01:56:08.116
LOOK AT THAT.                   
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE          
POSSIBLE.                       

01:56:08.118 --> 01:56:10.685
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE          
POSSIBLE.                       
IT'S ONE OF THOSE LET ME MAKE

01:56:13.223 --> 01:56:17.893
COME BACK WITH A FULL PLAN.     
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH          
EXPLORING AS WELL.              

01:56:17.895 --> 01:56:18.593
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH          
EXPLORING AS WELL.
