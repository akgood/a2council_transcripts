A LITTLE CONFUSED.              
SO THEY WERE HERE AND GOT A 26  
FOOT VARIANCE.                  

00:29:41.056 --> 00:29:42.122
SO THEY WERE HERE AND GOT A 26  
FOOT VARIANCE.                  
DID THEY NOT KNOW ABOUT THE

IF THEY DID, WHY DIDN'T THEY DO

NEED FOR 15 FOOT VARIANCE THEN  
IF THEY DID, WHY DIDN'T THEY DO 
IT THEN AND COULD YOU

SO THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING 
OR MISCOMMUNICATION AND IT      
WASN'T CLEAR THAT THE 15 FOOT

WASN'T CLEAR THAT THE 15 FOOT   
BUFFER WOULD BE REQUIRED.       

00:30:00.809 --> 00:30:01.808
WASN'T CLEAR THAT THE 15 FOOT   
BUFFER WOULD BE REQUIRED.       
WHEN THEY DID COME TO ZIBA IN   

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:02.742
BUFFER WOULD BE REQUIRED.       
WHEN THEY DID COME TO ZIBA IN   
DECEMBER IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY 

00:30:02.744 --> 00:30:04.478
WHEN THEY DID COME TO ZIBA IN   
DECEMBER IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY 
WEREN'T GOING TO MEET THE

00:30:05.213 --> 00:30:06.013
WEREN'T GOING TO MEET THE

REAR SETBACK BACK BECAUSE THEY  

00:30:06.015 --> 00:30:08.215
RESIDENTIAL SET BACK OR THE     
REAR SETBACK BACK BECAUSE THEY  
WERE ADJACENT THE RESIDENTIAL   

00:30:08.217 --> 00:30:09.149
REAR SETBACK BACK BECAUSE THEY  
WERE ADJACENT THE RESIDENTIAL   
ZONING TO THE WEST AND THEN     

00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:12.585
WERE ADJACENT THE RESIDENTIAL   
ZONING TO THE WEST AND THEN     
UPON FURTHER REVIEW WHEN THEY

UPON FURTHER REVIEW WHEN THEY   
SUBMITTED FOR THEIR SITE PLAN   

00:30:13.255 --> 00:30:15.788
UPON FURTHER REVIEW WHEN THEY   
SUBMITTED FOR THEIR SITE PLAN   
IT WAS REALIZED THAT THEY WERE  

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.790
SUBMITTED FOR THEIR SITE PLAN   
IT WAS REALIZED THAT THEY WERE  
GOING TO NEED ALSO A SEPARATE   

00:30:16.792 --> 00:30:19.659
IT WAS REALIZED THAT THEY WERE  
GOING TO NEED ALSO A SEPARATE   
15 FOOT LANDSCAPE BUFFER        

00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:20.293
GOING TO NEED ALSO A SEPARATE

00:30:21.363 --> 00:30:24.230
RESIDENTIAL ZONING.             
SO BOTH OF THESE ARE            
REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE

WHAT THE SET BACK THAT WAS      
GRANTED.                        

00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:12.112
WHAT THE SET BACK THAT WAS      
GRANTED.                        
SO IT'S ABOUT FOUR FEET I       

00:31:12.114 --> 00:31:14.781
GRANTED.                        
SO IT'S ABOUT FOUR FEET I       
BELIEVE I GUESS I DIDN'T ASK    

00:31:14.783 --> 00:31:18.251
SO IT'S ABOUT FOUR FEET I       
BELIEVE I GUESS I DIDN'T ASK    
THE RIGHT QUESTION I IMAGINE A  

00:31:18.253 --> 00:31:19.186
BELIEVE I GUESS I DIDN'T ASK    
THE RIGHT QUESTION I IMAGINE A  
BUFFER IS A BUNCH OF TREES THAT 

00:31:19.188 --> 00:31:19.852
THE RIGHT QUESTION I IMAGINE A  
BUFFER IS A BUNCH OF TREES THAT 
YOU CAN'T SEE THROUGH.          

00:31:19.854 --> 00:31:22.355
BUFFER IS A BUNCH OF TREES THAT 
YOU CAN'T SEE THROUGH.          
SO YOU SOMETHING WALKING IT

YOU CAN'T SEE THROUGH.          
SO YOU SOMETHING WALKING IT     
IT'S A BUFFER.

SO YOU SOMETHING WALKING IT     
IT'S A BUFFER.

00:31:23.625 --> 00:31:25.625
IT'S A BUFFER.                  
SO IT MEANS ESSENTIALLY THAT IT 
WOULD BE OPEN BETWEEN THIS NEW
