THANKS.                         
YEAH I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS  
OF MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE ME SO I 

01:39:29.331 --> 01:39:32.564
YEAH I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS  
OF MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE ME SO I 
WILL ALSO STRESS THE FACT THAT  

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:35.734
OF MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE ME SO I 
WILL ALSO STRESS THE FACT THAT  
THIS IS A THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS  

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:38.838
WILL ALSO STRESS THE FACT THAT  
THIS IS A THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS  
TO REACH THIS SCORE TO TO MEET  

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:39.372
THIS IS A THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS  
TO REACH THIS SCORE TO TO MEET  
THIS ORDINANCE.                 

01:39:39.374 --> 01:39:40.306
TO REACH THIS SCORE TO TO MEET  
THIS ORDINANCE.                 
I THINK THAT IS A PIECE THAT    

01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:42.908
THIS ORDINANCE.                 
I THINK THAT IS A PIECE THAT    
WE'VE HEARD CONSISTENTLY IS     

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:43.842
I THINK THAT IS A PIECE THAT    
WE'VE HEARD CONSISTENTLY IS     
THAT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO    

01:39:43.844 --> 01:39:44.510
WE'VE HEARD CONSISTENTLY IS     
THAT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO    
HAVE REALLY FIXATED ON THE      

01:39:44.512 --> 01:39:47.413
THAT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO    
HAVE REALLY FIXATED ON THE      
CHECKLIST PATHWAY WITH REGARDS  

01:39:47.415 --> 01:39:48.247
HAVE REALLY FIXATED ON THE      
CHECKLIST PATHWAY WITH REGARDS  
TO THE HOME ENERGY RATING, HER  

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:51.817
CHECKLIST PATHWAY WITH REGARDS  
TO THE HOME ENERGY RATING, HER  
SCORE THE BEST SCORE WOULD BE   

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:58.558
TO THE HOME ENERGY RATING, HER  
SCORE THE BEST SCORE WOULD BE   
ZERO WHICH IS A NET ZERO HOME   

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:14.774
AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT  
100 IS SORT OF THE AVERAGE.     
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO   

01:40:14.776 --> 01:40:15.375
100 IS SORT OF THE AVERAGE.     
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO   
MEET A SCORE THAT'S BELOW       

01:40:15.377 --> 01:40:16.209
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO   
MEET A SCORE THAT'S BELOW       
AVERAGE FOR OUR RENTAL UNITS.   

01:40:16.211 --> 01:40:16.876
MEET A SCORE THAT'S BELOW       
AVERAGE FOR OUR RENTAL UNITS.   
THIS IS A PLACE TO BEGIN.       

01:40:16.878 --> 01:40:17.676
AVERAGE FOR OUR RENTAL UNITS.   
THIS IS A PLACE TO BEGIN.       
SO IT'S TRYING TO HIT THE LOWER 

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:18.344
THIS IS A PLACE TO BEGIN.       
SO IT'S TRYING TO HIT THE LOWER 
PERFORMING HOMES IN OUR         

01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:19.011
SO IT'S TRYING TO HIT THE LOWER 
PERFORMING HOMES IN OUR         
COMMUNITY AS A AS A STARTING    

01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:19.612
PERFORMING HOMES IN OUR         
COMMUNITY AS A AS A STARTING    
PLACE FOR OUR COMMUNITY.        

01:40:19.614 --> 01:40:20.346
COMMUNITY AS A AS A STARTING    
PLACE FOR OUR COMMUNITY.        
SO I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO     

01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:21.080
PLACE FOR OUR COMMUNITY.        
SO I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO     
PHASE THIS IN IN A WAY THAT'S   

01:40:21.082 --> 01:40:21.880
SO I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO     
PHASE THIS IN IN A WAY THAT'S   
THAT'S MANAGEABLE AND WE HAVE   

01:40:21.882 --> 01:40:22.682
PHASE THIS IN IN A WAY THAT'S   
THAT'S MANAGEABLE AND WE HAVE   
BUILT IN THIS SORT OF PHASED IN 

01:40:22.684 --> 01:40:23.416
THAT'S MANAGEABLE AND WE HAVE   
BUILT IN THIS SORT OF PHASED IN 
COMPLIANCE PERIOD THAT SOME     

01:40:23.418 --> 01:40:23.950
BUILT IN THIS SORT OF PHASED IN 
COMPLIANCE PERIOD THAT SOME     
FOLKS SPOKE TO.                 

01:40:23.952 --> 01:40:26.652
COMPLIANCE PERIOD THAT SOME     
FOLKS SPOKE TO.                 
BUT I THINK HAS BEEN LOST FOR   

01:40:26.654 --> 01:40:30.422
FOLKS SPOKE TO.                 
BUT I THINK HAS BEEN LOST FOR   
SOME OTHERS IN TERMS OF OF HOW  

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:31.057
BUT I THINK HAS BEEN LOST FOR   
SOME OTHERS IN TERMS OF OF HOW  
THE IMPLEMENTATION HAPPENS.     

01:40:31.059 --> 01:40:34.126
SOME OTHERS IN TERMS OF OF HOW  
THE IMPLEMENTATION HAPPENS.     
BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE HAS 

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:34.927
THE IMPLEMENTATION HAPPENS.     
BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE HAS 
BEEN SOME SORT OF LEVEL         

01:40:34.929 --> 01:40:37.296
BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE HAS 
BEEN SOME SORT OF LEVEL         
OF ORCHESTRATED CONFUSION       

01:40:37.298 --> 01:40:38.164
BEEN SOME SORT OF LEVEL         
OF ORCHESTRATED CONFUSION       
AROUND THIS THAT WE'VE SEEN ON  

01:40:38.166 --> 01:40:38.498
OF ORCHESTRATED CONFUSION       
AROUND THIS THAT WE'VE SEEN ON  
SOCIAL MEDIA.                   

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.233
AROUND THIS THAT WE'VE SEEN ON  
SOCIAL MEDIA.                   
BUT I ALSO THINK THERE'S SOME   

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:42.101
SOCIAL MEDIA.                   
BUT I ALSO THINK THERE'S SOME   
GENUINE CONFUSION THAT'S IN OUR 

01:40:42.103 --> 01:40:42.768
BUT I ALSO THINK THERE'S SOME   
GENUINE CONFUSION THAT'S IN OUR 
COMMUNITY AND SOME GENERAL      

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:45.371
GENUINE CONFUSION THAT'S IN OUR 
COMMUNITY AND SOME GENERAL      
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS WHETHER OR 

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:46.405
COMMUNITY AND SOME GENERAL      
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS WHETHER OR 
NOT IT'S HOW THIS IS GOING TO   

01:40:46.407 --> 01:40:49.274
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS WHETHER OR 
NOT IT'S HOW THIS IS GOING TO   
ROLL OUT.                       

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:50.476
NOT IT'S HOW THIS IS GOING TO   
ROLL OUT.                       
AND I WANT TO YOU KNOW, THINK   

01:40:50.478 --> 01:40:51.276
ROLL OUT.                       
AND I WANT TO YOU KNOW, THINK   
FOLKS THAT CAME BEFORE US       

01:40:51.278 --> 01:40:53.712
AND I WANT TO YOU KNOW, THINK   
FOLKS THAT CAME BEFORE US       
TONIGHT AND RAISED QUESTIONS    

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:57.049
FOLKS THAT CAME BEFORE US       
TONIGHT AND RAISED QUESTIONS    
AND I THINK SPOKE WITH GENUINE  

01:40:57.051 --> 01:40:57.816
TONIGHT AND RAISED QUESTIONS    
AND I THINK SPOKE WITH GENUINE  
CONCERN ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT    

01:40:57.818 --> 01:41:01.120
AND I THINK SPOKE WITH GENUINE  
CONCERN ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT    
PLAY OUT IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY.  

01:41:01.122 --> 01:41:02.522
CONCERN ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT    
PLAY OUT IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY.  
AND SO, YOU KNOW, ONE QUESTION  

01:41:02.524 --> 01:41:03.189
PLAY OUT IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY.  
AND SO, YOU KNOW, ONE QUESTION  
I DID WANT TO POSE TO STAFF     

01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:05.424
AND SO, YOU KNOW, ONE QUESTION  
I DID WANT TO POSE TO STAFF     
TONIGHT THEY GOT BASED ON       

01:41:05.426 --> 01:41:06.158
I DID WANT TO POSE TO STAFF     
TONIGHT THEY GOT BASED ON       
PUBLIC COMMENT IS JUST A        

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:06.893
TONIGHT THEY GOT BASED ON       
PUBLIC COMMENT IS JUST A        
QUESTION AROUND THE CHECKLIST   

01:41:06.895 --> 01:41:09.261
PUBLIC COMMENT IS JUST A        
QUESTION AROUND THE CHECKLIST   
AND HOW THAT MIGHT EVOLVE AND   

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:09.761
QUESTION AROUND THE CHECKLIST   
AND HOW THAT MIGHT EVOLVE AND   
CHANGE OVER TIME.               

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:10.729
AND HOW THAT MIGHT EVOLVE AND   
CHANGE OVER TIME.               
I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT      

01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:12.030
CHANGE OVER TIME.               
I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT      
OF FIXATION ON THE CHECKLIST

OF FIXATION ON THE CHECKLIST    
AND IT'S BEEN CREATED IN A WAY  

01:41:13.101 --> 01:41:13.766
OF FIXATION ON THE CHECKLIST    
AND IT'S BEEN CREATED IN A WAY  
TO CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY      

01:41:13.768 --> 01:41:16.335
AND IT'S BEEN CREATED IN A WAY  
TO CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY      
AROUND IT AND HAVE DIFFERENT    

01:41:16.337 --> 01:41:17.269

LOOKING AT THE BUILDING SCIENCE 
OF EVERYTHING AND HOW IT        

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.446
LOOKING AT THE BUILDING SCIENCE 
OF EVERYTHING AND HOW IT        
RELATES TO CARBON EMISSIONS SO  

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:02.415
OF EVERYTHING AND HOW IT        
RELATES TO CARBON EMISSIONS SO  
FIRST TAKING ANY ITEM THAT HAS  

01:42:02.417 --> 01:42:03.282
RELATES TO CARBON EMISSIONS SO  
FIRST TAKING ANY ITEM THAT HAS  
ANY IMPACT ON THE BUILDING      

01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:05.918
FIRST TAKING ANY ITEM THAT HAS  
ANY IMPACT ON THE BUILDING      
ITSELF, HOW IT WORKS THE IS HOW 

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.685
ANY IMPACT ON THE BUILDING      
ITSELF, HOW IT WORKS THE IS HOW 
IT WORKS PARTICULARLY HEATING   

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:09.488
ITSELF, HOW IT WORKS THE IS HOW 
IT WORKS PARTICULARLY HEATING   
AND COOLING AND STATING IF YOU  

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:10.356
IT WORKS PARTICULARLY HEATING   
AND COOLING AND STATING IF YOU  
MADE THIS CHANGE HOW MUCH OF A

MADE THIS CHANGE HOW MUCH OF A  
PERCENT REDUCTION IN            

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:13.592
MADE THIS CHANGE HOW MUCH OF A  
PERCENT REDUCTION IN            
CARBON EMISSIONS WOULD YOU SEE? 

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:14.726
PERCENT REDUCTION IN            
CARBON EMISSIONS WOULD YOU SEE? 
AND THEN WE DESIGNED A ONE TO   

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:15.327
CARBON EMISSIONS WOULD YOU SEE? 
AND THEN WE DESIGNED A ONE TO   
ONE POINT VALUE FOR THAT.       

01:42:15.329 --> 01:42:17.529
AND THEN WE DESIGNED A ONE TO   
ONE POINT VALUE FOR THAT.       
SO IF YOU HAD SOMETHING THAT    

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:18.330
ONE POINT VALUE FOR THAT.

PERCENT, IT GETS 30 POINTS ON   

01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:20.732
DROPPED YOUR EMISSIONS BY 30    
PERCENT, IT GETS 30 POINTS ON

PERCENT, IT GETS 30 POINTS ON   
THE CHECKLIST.                  
WELL, WE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT   

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:22.501

WELL, WE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT   
THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS OUT  

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.504
WELL, WE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT   
THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS OUT  
THERE THAT DO IMPACTORS         

01:42:24.506 --> 01:42:25.370
THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS OUT  
THERE THAT DO IMPACTORS         
SUSTAINABILITY TO IMPACT THE    

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:26.104

ITEMS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE     
ABLE TO QUANTIFY.               
AND SO WE ESTABLISHED A         

01:42:33.681 --> 01:42:34.213
ABLE TO QUANTIFY.               
AND SO WE ESTABLISHED A         
STANDARD SCORING SYSTEM         

01:42:34.215 --> 01:42:34.847
AND SO WE ESTABLISHED A         
STANDARD SCORING SYSTEM         
THROUGHOUT ESSENTIALLY          

01:42:34.849 --> 01:42:37.250
STANDARD SCORING SYSTEM         
THROUGHOUT ESSENTIALLY          
ACCORDING TO POINTS THAT HAS    

01:42:37.252 --> 01:42:37.983
THROUGHOUT ESSENTIALLY          
ACCORDING TO POINTS THAT HAS    
NOTHING TO DO WITH GENERAL

ACCORDING TO POINTS THAT HAS    
NOTHING TO DO WITH GENERAL      
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ANOTHER   

01:42:38.786 --> 01:42:40.386
NOTHING TO DO WITH GENERAL      
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ANOTHER   
TWO POINTS OF IT HAS TO DO WITH 

01:42:40.388 --> 01:42:41.220
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ANOTHER   
TWO POINTS OF IT HAS TO DO WITH 
SUSTAINABILITY SO WE COULD GET  

01:42:41.222 --> 01:42:44.190
TWO POINTS OF IT HAS TO DO WITH 
SUSTAINABILITY SO WE COULD GET  
TWO OR FOUR ITEMS AND AGAIN     

01:42:44.192 --> 01:42:44.990
SUSTAINABILITY SO WE COULD GET  
TWO OR FOUR ITEMS AND AGAIN     
BEING CONSISTENT ACROSS THAT    

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:48.527
TWO OR FOUR ITEMS AND AGAIN     
BEING CONSISTENT ACROSS THAT    
THE ONLY ONE THAT GOES SLIGHTLY 

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:49.428
BEING CONSISTENT ACROSS THAT    
THE ONLY ONE THAT GOES SLIGHTLY 
OUT OF THAT IS YOU SAW THE      

01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:50.162
THE ONLY ONE THAT GOES SLIGHTLY 
OUT OF THAT IS YOU SAW THE      
RENTER SUSTAINABILITY SERIES    

01:42:50.164 --> 01:42:52.265
OUT OF THAT IS YOU SAW THE      
RENTER SUSTAINABILITY SERIES    
AND WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR IS AS     

01:42:52.267 --> 01:42:53.065
RENTER SUSTAINABILITY SERIES    
AND WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR IS AS     
WE'RE DOING OUR MODELING THERE  

01:42:53.067 --> 01:42:55.634
AND WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR IS AS     
WE'RE DOING OUR MODELING THERE  
IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER         

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:56.302
WE'RE DOING OUR MODELING THERE  
IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER         
OF EMISSIONS THAT COULD BE      

01:42:56.304 --> 01:42:57.102
IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER         
OF EMISSIONS THAT COULD BE      
CHANGED JUST FROM PLUG LOADS    

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:59.638
OF EMISSIONS THAT COULD BE      
CHANGED JUST FROM PLUG LOADS    
AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CAN'T 

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.505
CHANGED JUST FROM PLUG LOADS    
AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CAN'T 
READILY BE CONTROLLED BY YOU    

01:43:00.507 --> 01:43:01.374
AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CAN'T 
READILY BE CONTROLLED BY YOU

AND SO THAT ACCOUNTS FOR TENANT 

01:43:04.712 --> 01:43:05.378
OWNER OF THE PROPERTY.          
AND SO THAT ACCOUNTS FOR TENANT 
BEHAVIOR IN HOW THEY'RE

BEHAVIOR IN HOW THEY'RE         
MONITORING THOSE.               
SO THAT'S WHY THAT ONE IS A     

01:43:08.749 --> 01:43:09.548
MONITORING THOSE.               
SO THAT'S WHY THAT ONE IS A     
SLIGHTLY HIGHER SCORE COMPARED  

01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.882
SO THAT'S WHY THAT ONE IS A     
SLIGHTLY HIGHER SCORE COMPARED  
TO THE OTHERS.
