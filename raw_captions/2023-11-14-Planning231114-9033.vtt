WE&apos;VE DESIGNED IT FOR IT TO     

00:40:22.621 --> 00:40:25.554
IT BECOMES AN ISSUE AGAIN,      
WE&apos;VE DESIGNED IT FOR IT TO     
HOPEFULLY NOT TO BE BUT WE JUST 

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:26.256
WE&apos;VE DESIGNED IT FOR IT TO     
HOPEFULLY NOT TO BE BUT WE JUST 
KNOW AGAIN WHAT HAPPENS ON HERE 

00:40:26.258 --> 00:40:29.058
HOPEFULLY NOT TO BE BUT WE JUST

00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:36.265
PEOPLE HAVE BEHAVIORS LIKE THAT 
AND SO JUST TRYING TO           
POTENTIALLY ALLEVIATE THAT AT   

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:37.266
AND SO JUST TRYING TO           
POTENTIALLY ALLEVIATE THAT AT   
SOME POINT IN TIME IF WE NEED   

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:37.934
POTENTIALLY ALLEVIATE THAT AT   
SOME POINT IN TIME IF WE NEED

AN ISSUE GREAT.                 

00:40:40.138 --> 00:40:41.070
TO BUT HOPEFULLY THAT WON&apos;T BE  
AN ISSUE GREAT.                 
I WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT       

00:40:41.072 --> 00:40:44.274

00:40:45.243 --> 00:40:47.943
COOPERATION WITH THE NEIGHBORS, 
WHICH IS MY FINAL THING THAT I  
WAS GOING TO BRING UP THE SOLID 

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:49.111

WAS GOING TO BRING UP THE SOLID 
E CONDITION THAT WE HAVE TO GET 

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.314

E CONDITION THAT WE HAVE TO GET 
THAT SORTED.                    

00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:52.181
E CONDITION THAT WE HAVE TO GET 
THAT SORTED.                    
I LIKE THE COLLABORATIVE        

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:52.515
THAT SORTED.                    
I LIKE THE COLLABORATIVE        
APPROACH.                       

00:40:52.517 --> 00:40:56.152
I LIKE THE COLLABORATIVE        
APPROACH.                       
IS IT DRIVEN BECAUSE            

00:40:56.154 --> 00:40:56.886
APPROACH.                       
IS IT DRIVEN BECAUSE            
OF REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SOLID    

00:40:56.888 --> 00:40:57.486
IS IT DRIVEN BECAUSE            
OF REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SOLID    
WASTE TURNAROUND STUFF?         

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:57.954
OF REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SOLID    
WASTE TURNAROUND STUFF?         
IS THAT CORRECT?                

00:40:57.956 --> 00:41:00.757
WASTE TURNAROUND STUFF?         
IS THAT CORRECT?                
THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S DRIVING IT THAT   

00:41:00.759 --> 00:41:01.558
IS THAT CORRECT?

STARTED THIS PROJECT BACK IN    
TWENTY EIGHTEEN.                
WE CHECKED IN ON THE            

00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:26.341
TWENTY EIGHTEEN.                
WE CHECKED IN ON THE            
CONVERSATION I THINK POST COVID 

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.443
WE CHECKED IN ON THE            
CONVERSATION I THINK POST COVID 
WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOT 

00:47:27.445 --> 00:47:29.911
CONVERSATION I THINK POST COVID 
WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOT 
NECESSARILY POTENTIALLY A POWER 

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:30.646
WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOT 
NECESSARILY POTENTIALLY A POWER 
IN THE CIRCUIT AND THAT THEY    

00:47:30.648 --> 00:47:31.246
NECESSARILY POTENTIALLY A POWER 
IN THE CIRCUIT AND THAT THEY    
WERE LOOKING AT DOING           

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:34.049
IN THE CIRCUIT AND THAT THEY    
WERE LOOKING AT DOING           
IMPROVEMENTS BUT WHO KNOWS WHEN 

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:34.783
WERE LOOKING AT DOING           
IMPROVEMENTS BUT WHO KNOWS WHEN 
THAT WAS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE  

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:38.154
IMPROVEMENTS BUT WHO KNOWS WHEN 
THAT WAS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE  
AND SO WE MADE THE DECISION     

00:47:38.156 --> 00:47:38.954
THAT WAS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE  
AND SO WE MADE THE DECISION     
JUST BECAUSE WE THINK IT&apos;S THE  

00:47:38.956 --> 00:47:41.824
AND SO WE MADE THE DECISION     
JUST BECAUSE WE THINK IT&apos;S THE  
RIGHT WAY.                      

00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:42.824
JUST BECAUSE WE THINK IT&apos;S THE  
RIGHT WAY.                      
WE KNOW THE CITY IS TRYING TO   

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:43.292
RIGHT WAY.                      
WE KNOW THE CITY IS TRYING TO   
PROMOTE THAT.                   

00:47:43.294 --> 00:47:45.894
WE KNOW THE CITY IS TRYING TO   
PROMOTE THAT.                   
I WOULD SAY THE HOTEL WE DID    

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:46.595
PROMOTE THAT.                   
I WOULD SAY THE HOTEL WE DID    
DOWN HERE ON STREET TEN YEARS   

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:49.331
I WOULD SAY THE HOTEL WE DID    
DOWN HERE ON STREET TEN YEARS   
AGO IS ALMOST EIGHT PERCENT GAS 

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:50.265
DOWN HERE ON STREET TEN YEARS   
AGO IS ALMOST EIGHT PERCENT GAS 
TO EVERY ROOM, EVERY PUBLIC     

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:50.800
AGO IS ALMOST EIGHT PERCENT GAS 
TO EVERY ROOM, EVERY PUBLIC     
SPACE, EVERYTHING ELSE.         

00:47:50.802 --> 00:47:53.402
TO EVERY ROOM, EVERY PUBLIC     
SPACE, EVERYTHING ELSE.         
AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE        

00:47:53.404 --> 00:47:54.136
SPACE, EVERYTHING ELSE.         
AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE        
DESIGNED THE BUILDING TO THE    

00:47:54.138 --> 00:47:56.805
AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE        
DESIGNED THE BUILDING TO THE    
BEST OF OUR ABILITY TO MATCH UP 

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:57.572
DESIGNED THE BUILDING TO THE    
BEST OF OUR ABILITY TO MATCH UP 
THE CITY&apos;S INTERESTS WITH WHAT  

00:47:57.574 --> 00:48:00.643
BEST OF OUR ABILITY TO MATCH UP 
THE CITY&apos;S INTERESTS WITH WHAT  
WAS COMMERCIALLY VIABLE.        

00:48:00.645 --> 00:48:01.711
THE CITY&apos;S INTERESTS WITH WHAT  
WAS COMMERCIALLY VIABLE.        
AND SO THE 70 PERCENT IN THE    

00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:08.184
WAS COMMERCIALLY VIABLE.        
AND SO THE 70 PERCENT IN THE    
ROOMS THOSE ARE QUALITY         

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:23.833
                        UNITS.

BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE LOW   

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:25.968
SPOKE TO THE BEST FRIEDERICH    
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE LOW   
EMISSION CONTROLS AND           

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:26.368
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE LOW   
EMISSION CONTROLS AND

FROM AN ELECTRIC SOLUTION.      

00:48:36.848 --> 00:48:37.680
SPACES HAVE BECOME CHALLENGING  
FROM AN ELECTRIC SOLUTION.      
IT&apos;S EASIER TO DO OBVIOUSLY THE 

00:48:37.682 --> 00:48:38.280
FROM AN ELECTRIC SOLUTION.      
IT&apos;S EASIER TO DO OBVIOUSLY THE 
ROOMS ARE SMALLER FACE TO       

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:38.680
IT&apos;S EASIER TO DO OBVIOUSLY THE 
ROOMS ARE SMALLER FACE TO       
CONDITION.

CONDITION.                      
RIGHT.                          
SO WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT THE BAR  

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:40.415
RIGHT.                          
SO WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT THE BAR

00:48:43.187 --> 00:48:43.885
PUBLIC CORRIDORS.               
BUT AGAIN THE A LARGE PART      
OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE AND THE   

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:46.022
BUT AGAIN THE A LARGE PART      
OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE AND THE   
ACTUAL USE WILL BE ELECTRIC.    

00:48:46.024 --> 00:48:47.089
OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE AND THE   
ACTUAL USE WILL BE ELECTRIC.    
AND SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF HOW WE    

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:47.490
ACTUAL USE WILL BE ELECTRIC.    
AND SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF HOW WE    
GOT THERE.                      

00:48:47.492 --> 00:48:50.192

00:49:54.058 --> 00:49:54.790
ABOUT LAUNDRY NOW THAT THE      
RECENT DISCUSSION OF IT SEEMS   
LIKE I&apos;M VERY STEEPED IN THE    

00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:56.959
RECENT DISCUSSION OF IT SEEMS   
LIKE I&apos;M VERY STEEPED IN THE    
DOMESTIC BUT THE RECENT         

00:49:56.961 --> 00:49:57.692
LIKE I&apos;M VERY STEEPED IN THE    
DOMESTIC BUT THE RECENT         
DISCUSSION OF THE ELECTRICITY   

00:49:57.694 --> 00:50:01.163
DOMESTIC BUT THE RECENT         
DISCUSSION OF THE ELECTRICITY   
REMINDED ME THAT I THINK SOME   

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:01.831
DISCUSSION OF THE ELECTRICITY   
REMINDED ME THAT I THINK SOME   
CONCERN HAD BEEN RAISED ABOUT   

00:50:01.833 --> 00:50:05.967
REMINDED ME THAT I THINK SOME   
CONCERN HAD BEEN RAISED ABOUT   
THE ABILITY TO DO THE VOLUME    

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:06.368
CONCERN HAD BEEN RAISED ABOUT   
THE ABILITY TO DO THE VOLUME    
OF WATER.                       

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:06.902
THE ABILITY TO DO THE VOLUME    
OF WATER.                       
YEAH, EXACTLY.                  

00:50:06.904 --> 00:50:09.805
OF WATER.                       
YEAH, EXACTLY.                  
AND I JUST WONDERED IF THAT IS  

00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:10.605
YEAH, EXACTLY.                  
AND I JUST WONDERED IF THAT IS  
ANOTHER THING THAT&apos;S ENTERING   

00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:13.542
AND I JUST WONDERED IF THAT IS  
ANOTHER THING THAT&apos;S ENTERING   
INTO THE 30 PERCENT THAT CAN&apos;T  

00:50:13.544 --> 00:50:13.809
ANOTHER THING THAT&apos;S ENTERING   
INTO THE 30 PERCENT THAT CAN&apos;T  
BE DONE.                        

00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:14.143
INTO THE 30 PERCENT THAT CAN&apos;T  
BE DONE.                        
YEAH.                           

00:50:14.145 --> 00:50:15.177
BE DONE.                        
YEAH.                           
AND AGAIN I IN THE CALCULATION  

00:50:15.179 --> 00:50:17.679
YEAH.                           
AND AGAIN I IN THE CALCULATION  
WE DID AT THE TIME WITH OUR     

00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:18.380
AND AGAIN I IN THE CALCULATION  
WE DID AT THE TIME WITH OUR     
ENGINEERING TEAM WAS THAT THE   

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:21.517
WE DID AT THE TIME WITH OUR     
ENGINEERING TEAM WAS THAT THE   
AMOUNT OF POWER THAT WOULD BE   

00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:22.184
ENGINEERING TEAM WAS THAT THE   
AMOUNT OF POWER THAT WOULD BE   
NEEDED TO RUN THOSE SYSTEMS     

00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:24.453
AMOUNT OF POWER THAT WOULD BE   
NEEDED TO RUN THOSE SYSTEMS     
VERSUS BURNING NATURAL GAS ON   

00:50:24.455 --> 00:50:25.087
NEEDED TO RUN THOSE SYSTEMS     
VERSUS BURNING NATURAL GAS ON   
SITE AGAIN SOURCING THE POWER   

00:50:25.089 --> 00:50:28.624
VERSUS BURNING NATURAL GAS ON   
SITE AGAIN SOURCING THE POWER   
FROM A GRID THAT IS BURNING     

00:50:28.626 --> 00:50:29.625
SITE AGAIN SOURCING THE POWER   
FROM A GRID THAT IS BURNING     
COAL AND NATURAL GAS THAT THE   

00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:33.362
FROM A GRID THAT IS BURNING     
COAL AND NATURAL GAS THAT THE   
IMPACTS AND THE ENERGY USAGE    

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:34.162
COAL AND NATURAL GAS THAT THE   
IMPACTS AND THE ENERGY USAGE    
WOULD BE HIGHER THAN BURNING    

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.832
IMPACTS AND THE ENERGY USAGE    
WOULD BE HIGHER THAN BURNING    
NATURAL GAS ON SITE.            

00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:43.739
WOULD BE HIGHER THAN BURNING

WHAT HAPPENS IN HOTELS LIKE     

00:51:22.246 --> 00:51:26.282
THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED ELECTRIC.  
WHAT HAPPENS IN HOTELS LIKE     
THIS IS THERE&apos;S A HOT WATER     

00:51:26.284 --> 00:51:27.149
WHAT HAPPENS IN HOTELS LIKE     
THIS IS THERE&apos;S A HOT WATER     
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY 

00:51:27.151 --> 00:51:30.085
THIS IS THERE&apos;S A HOT WATER     
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY 
USES WHAT&apos;S CALLED AN ELECTRIC  

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:30.486
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY 
USES WHAT&apos;S CALLED AN ELECTRIC  
MAINTAINER.                     

00:51:30.488 --> 00:51:34.156
USES WHAT&apos;S CALLED AN ELECTRIC  
MAINTAINER.                     
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOTEL IS    

00:51:34.158 --> 00:51:34.790
MAINTAINER.                     
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOTEL IS    
NOT AT FULL OCCUPANCY.          

00:51:34.792 --> 00:51:35.725
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOTEL IS    
NOT AT FULL OCCUPANCY.          
IT DOESN&apos;T HAVE A MASSIVE SURGE 

00:51:35.727 --> 00:51:38.427
NOT AT FULL OCCUPANCY.          
IT DOESN&apos;T HAVE A MASSIVE SURGE 
OF EVERYONE TAKING A SHOWER AT  

00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:39.461
IT DOESN&apos;T HAVE A MASSIVE SURGE 
OF EVERYONE TAKING A SHOWER AT  
THE SAME TIME IT RUNS OFF OF A  

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:42.264
OF EVERYONE TAKING A SHOWER AT  
THE SAME TIME IT RUNS OFF OF A  
MODERATOR WHICH IS AN ELECTRIC  

00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:43.065
THE SAME TIME IT RUNS OFF OF A  
MODERATOR WHICH IS AN ELECTRIC  
UNIT THAT MAINTAINS TEMPERATURE 

00:51:43.067 --> 00:51:46.401
MODERATOR WHICH IS AN ELECTRIC

IN A TANK SYSTEM WITHIN THE     
BUILDING AT THE MOMENT THAT YOU 

00:51:47.238 --> 00:51:50.639
IN A TANK SYSTEM WITHIN THE     
BUILDING AT THE MOMENT THAT YOU 
HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY     

00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:51.306
BUILDING AT THE MOMENT THAT YOU 
HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY     
NINE SHOWERS RUNNING AT THE     

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:52.041
HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY     
NINE SHOWERS RUNNING AT THE     
SAME TIME THEY&apos;RE TRYING TO     

00:51:52.043 --> 00:51:53.708
NINE SHOWERS RUNNING AT THE     
SAME TIME THEY&apos;RE TRYING TO     
WASH SHEETS AND COOK SOMETHING  

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.110

IN THE KITCHEN.                 
WHAT KICKS IN IS THE GAS SYSTEM 

00:51:58.015 --> 00:51:58.614
IN THE KITCHEN.                 
WHAT KICKS IN IS THE GAS SYSTEM 
TO BOOST THE MECHANICAL         

00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:01.483
WHAT KICKS IN IS THE GAS SYSTEM 
TO BOOST THE MECHANICAL         
COMPONENTS SO THE 30 PERCENT IS 

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:02.151
TO BOOST THE MECHANICAL         
COMPONENTS SO THE 30 PERCENT IS 
MAYBE A LITTLE MISLEADING       

00:52:02.153 --> 00:52:05.187
COMPONENTS SO THE 30 PERCENT IS 
MAYBE A LITTLE MISLEADING       
BECAUSE THAT&apos;S AT PEAK USAGE    

00:52:05.189 --> 00:52:08.724
MAYBE A LITTLE MISLEADING       
BECAUSE THAT&apos;S AT PEAK USAGE    
WHICH IS AT LIMITED TIMES IN    

00:52:08.726 --> 00:52:09.125
BECAUSE THAT&apos;S AT PEAK USAGE    
WHICH IS AT LIMITED TIMES IN    
OPERATIONS.                     

00:52:09.127 --> 00:52:10.059
WHICH IS AT LIMITED TIMES IN    
OPERATIONS.                     
SO THIS IS A VERY, VERY         

00:52:10.061 --> 00:52:12.928
OPERATIONS.                     
SO THIS IS A VERY, VERY         
EFFICIENT BUILDING.             

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:16.899
SO THIS IS A VERY, VERY         
EFFICIENT BUILDING.             
NICK HAD ALSO MENTIONED YOU CAN 

00:52:16.901 --> 00:52:17.566
EFFICIENT BUILDING.             
NICK HAD ALSO MENTIONED YOU CAN 
HAVE THE MOST EFFICIENT         

00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:18.167
NICK HAD ALSO MENTIONED YOU CAN 
HAVE THE MOST EFFICIENT         
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM BUT YOU CAN   

00:52:18.169 --> 00:52:20.569
HAVE THE MOST EFFICIENT         
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM BUT YOU CAN   
HAVE A VERY INEFFICIENT         

00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:24.373
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM BUT YOU CAN   
HAVE A VERY INEFFICIENT         
BUILDING ON PHELIM AND SO OR    

00:52:24.375 --> 00:52:25.073
HAVE A VERY INEFFICIENT         
BUILDING ON PHELIM AND SO OR    
THE BITTER REALITY OF THIS

RECYCLED CONTENT, A NUMBER      
OF OTHER ELEMENTS THAT GO INTO  
THE DESIGN OF THESE BUILDINGS   

00:52:37.522 --> 00:52:40.589
OF OTHER ELEMENTS THAT GO INTO  
THE DESIGN OF THESE BUILDINGS   
IN PLANTS, THE UTILIZATION      

00:52:40.591 --> 00:52:41.256
THE DESIGN OF THESE BUILDINGS   
IN PLANTS, THE UTILIZATION      
OF SOME OF THE MECHANICAL

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED 
TO MENTION THIS SITE USED TO BE 
HAD A 20TH CENTURY AUTOMOBILE   

00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:18.527
TO MENTION THIS SITE USED TO BE 
HAD A 20TH CENTURY AUTOMOBILE   
REPAIR STATION AND THEN A       

00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:18.993
HAD A 20TH CENTURY AUTOMOBILE   
REPAIR STATION AND THEN A       
PARKING LOT.                    

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:19.594
REPAIR STATION AND THEN A       
PARKING LOT.                    
SO FROM A UTILIZATION           

00:53:19.596 --> 00:53:22.464
PARKING LOT.                    
SO FROM A UTILIZATION           
STANDPOINT SEEING THIS MORE     

00:53:22.466 --> 00:53:23.198
SO FROM A UTILIZATION           
STANDPOINT SEEING THIS MORE     
INTO THE URBAN CORE RATHER THAN 

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.167
STANDPOINT SEEING THIS MORE     
INTO THE URBAN CORE RATHER THAN 
THE DOWNTOWN PERIPHERY IS       

00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:27.001
INTO THE URBAN CORE RATHER THAN 
THE DOWNTOWN PERIPHERY IS       
REALLY, REALLY GREAT FROM THE   

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:30.972
THE DOWNTOWN PERIPHERY IS       
REALLY, REALLY GREAT FROM THE   
DESIGN REVIEW BOARD STANDARDS.  

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:31.973

DESIGN REVIEW BOARD STANDARDS.  
I THINK WHAT THIS WILL MASS     

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:34.442
DESIGN REVIEW BOARD STANDARDS.  
I THINK WHAT THIS WILL MASS     
APPROPRIATELY WITH CITY HALL AS

I THINK WHAT THIS WILL MASS     
APPROPRIATELY WITH CITY HALL AS

SO I THINK DRIVING IN FROM HERE 

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:42.818
STORIES AS WELL.                
SO I THINK DRIVING IN FROM HERE 
ON IS GOING TO CREATE A LOT     

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:43.585
SO I THINK DRIVING IN FROM HERE 
ON IS GOING TO CREATE A LOT     
OF VISUAL CONTRASTS AS WELL AS  

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:45.988
ON IS GOING TO CREATE A LOT
