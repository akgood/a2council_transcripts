RIGHT.                          

00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:44.189
BECAUSE IT WAS DURING COLD IT   
RIGHT.                          
AND SO WE HAD A LOT OF YOU      

00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:45.190
RIGHT.                          
AND SO WE HAD A LOT OF YOU      
KNOW, WE WERE TOLD WASH YOUR    

00:27:45.192 --> 00:27:45.723
AND SO WE HAD A LOT OF YOU      
KNOW, WE WERE TOLD WASH YOUR    
HANDS OR YOU COULD DIE.         

00:27:45.725 --> 00:27:48.193
KNOW, WE WERE TOLD WASH YOUR    
HANDS OR YOU COULD DIE.         
AND IN THIS CASE WE DIDN&apos;T HAVE 

00:27:48.195 --> 00:27:48.927
HANDS OR YOU COULD DIE.         
AND IN THIS CASE WE DIDN&apos;T HAVE 
A HAND WASHING STATION WHERE    

00:27:48.929 --> 00:27:49.595
AND IN THIS CASE WE DIDN&apos;T HAVE 
A HAND WASHING STATION WHERE    
EVERYBODY COULD ACCESS IT.      

00:27:49.597 --> 00:27:52.431
A HAND WASHING STATION WHERE    
EVERYBODY COULD ACCESS IT.      
SO I ACTUALLY LOCATED THE TYPE  

00:27:52.433 --> 00:27:53.165
EVERYBODY COULD ACCESS IT.      
SO I ACTUALLY LOCATED THE TYPE  
OF HAND WASHING STATION THAT    

00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:53.966
SO I ACTUALLY LOCATED THE TYPE  
OF HAND WASHING STATION THAT    
THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT GETTING 

00:27:53.968 --> 00:27:56.434
OF HAND WASHING STATION THAT    
THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT GETTING 
AN AND MADE THAT CLEAR TO       

00:27:56.436 --> 00:27:57.169
THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT GETTING 
AN AND MADE THAT CLEAR TO       
LOGISTICS THAT THIS IS ONE WAY  

00:27:57.171 --> 00:28:00.238
AN AND MADE THAT CLEAR TO       
LOGISTICS THAT THIS IS ONE WAY  
WE CAN ELIMINATE ONE BARRIER TO 

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.972
LOGISTICS THAT THIS IS ONE WAY  
WE CAN ELIMINATE ONE BARRIER TO 
SAFELY GETTING THROUGH THE      

00:28:00.974 --> 00:28:03.208
WE CAN ELIMINATE ONE BARRIER TO 
SAFELY GETTING THROUGH THE      
DISASTER EXPERIENCE.            

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.142
SAFELY GETTING THROUGH THE      
DISASTER EXPERIENCE.            
AND THIS IS A SMALL ONE.        

00:28:04.144 --> 00:28:05.077
DISASTER EXPERIENCE.            
AND THIS IS A SMALL ONE.        
I MEAN THEY GET MUCH BIGGER BUT 

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:08.079
AND THIS IS A SMALL ONE.        
I MEAN THEY GET MUCH BIGGER BUT 
THIS IS AN EASILY YOU CAN       

00:28:08.081 --> 00:28:08.814
I MEAN THEY GET MUCH BIGGER BUT 
THIS IS AN EASILY YOU CAN       
EASILY SEE HOW IT&apos;S IMPORTANT   

00:28:08.816 --> 00:28:12.050
THIS IS AN EASILY YOU CAN       
EASILY SEE HOW IT&apos;S IMPORTANT   
TO HAVE THE TYPE OF EYES THAT   

00:28:12.052 --> 00:28:12.917
EASILY SEE HOW IT&apos;S IMPORTANT   
TO HAVE THE TYPE OF EYES THAT   
WE BRING TO THESE EXPERIENCES   

00:28:12.919 --> 00:28:14.987
TO HAVE THE TYPE OF EYES THAT   
WE BRING TO THESE EXPERIENCES   
THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL MISS.     

00:28:14.989 --> 00:28:15.454
WE BRING TO THESE EXPERIENCES   
THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL MISS.     
RIGHT.                          

00:28:15.456 --> 00:28:16.321
THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL MISS.     
RIGHT.                          
AND THERE&apos;S THE THERE&apos;S THE     

00:28:16.323 --> 00:28:18.890
RIGHT.                          
AND THERE&apos;S THE THERE&apos;S THE     
HAND THE HAND CRANK THAT TURNS  

00:28:18.892 --> 00:28:19.958
AND THERE&apos;S THE THERE&apos;S THE     
HAND THE HAND CRANK THAT TURNS  
ON THE WATER SO YOU DON&apos;T NEED  

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.625
HAND THE HAND CRANK THAT TURNS  
ON THE WATER SO YOU DON&apos;T NEED  
TO PRESS ON WITH YOUR FOOT.     

00:28:20.627 --> 00:28:21.160
ON THE WATER SO YOU DON&apos;T NEED  
TO PRESS ON WITH YOUR FOOT.     
HERE&apos;S AN OBVIOUS ONE.          

00:28:21.162 --> 00:28:24.896
TO PRESS ON WITH YOUR FOOT.     
HERE&apos;S AN OBVIOUS ONE.          
WHAT&apos;S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE  

00:28:24.898 --> 00:28:25.097
HERE&apos;S AN OBVIOUS ONE.          
WHAT&apos;S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE  
?                               

00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:26.165
WHAT&apos;S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE  
?                               
I REALLY THOUGHT I WAS BEING    

00:28:26.167 --> 00:28:26.765
?                               
I REALLY THOUGHT I WAS BEING    
PARKED RIGHT THERE WAS A SHOW   

00:28:26.767 --> 00:28:29.467
I REALLY THOUGHT I WAS BEING    
PARKED RIGHT THERE WAS A SHOW   
ON MTV CALLED AND I THOUGHT     

00:28:29.469 --> 00:28:30.235
PARKED RIGHT THERE WAS A SHOW   
ON MTV CALLED AND I THOUGHT     
THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS REAL.   

00:28:30.237 --> 00:28:30.602
ON MTV CALLED AND I THOUGHT     
THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS REAL.   
RIGHT.                          

00:28:30.604 --> 00:28:33.271
THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS REAL.   
RIGHT.                          
AND I WON&apos;T TELL YOU WHERE THIS 

00:28:33.273 --> 00:28:34.239
RIGHT.                          
AND I WON&apos;T TELL YOU WHERE THIS 
WAS BUT WHEN I SAW THIS I       

00:28:34.241 --> 00:28:37.109
AND I WON&apos;T TELL YOU WHERE THIS 
WAS BUT WHEN I SAW THIS I       
THOUGHT THIS REALLY SENDS THE   

00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:37.843
WAS BUT WHEN I SAW THIS I       
THOUGHT THIS REALLY SENDS THE   
WRONG SIGNAL TO PEOPLE.         

00:28:37.845 --> 00:28:38.510
THOUGHT THIS REALLY SENDS THE   
WRONG SIGNAL TO PEOPLE.         
I&apos;M SOMEBODY WHO THEY&apos;RE        

00:28:38.512 --> 00:28:41.379
WRONG SIGNAL TO PEOPLE.         
I&apos;M SOMEBODY WHO THEY&apos;RE        
PROBABLY GOING TO TRY TO        

00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:41.780
I&apos;M SOMEBODY WHO THEY&apos;RE        
PROBABLY GOING TO TRY TO        
ACCOMMODATE.                    

00:28:41.782 --> 00:28:42.448
PROBABLY GOING TO TRY TO        
ACCOMMODATE.                    
BUT AT THE SHELTER THERE WERE   

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.582
ACCOMMODATE.                    
BUT AT THE SHELTER THERE WERE   
SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE AND I SAW  

00:28:44.584 --> 00:28:45.250
BUT AT THE SHELTER THERE WERE   
SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE AND I SAW  
WITH MY OWN EYES ABOUT TWENTY   

00:28:45.252 --> 00:28:45.984
SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE AND I SAW  
WITH MY OWN EYES ABOUT TWENTY   
IN WHEELCHAIRS AND I JUST       

00:28:45.986 --> 00:28:48.387
WITH MY OWN EYES ABOUT TWENTY   
IN WHEELCHAIRS AND I JUST       
THOUGHT THIS CAN&apos;T HAPPEN.      

00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.753
IN WHEELCHAIRS AND I JUST       
THOUGHT THIS CAN&apos;T HAPPEN.      
RIGHT.                          

00:28:48.755 --> 00:28:49.655
THOUGHT THIS CAN&apos;T HAPPEN.      
RIGHT.                          
AND SO IN THIS CASE THOUGH THE  

00:28:49.657 --> 00:28:52.491
RIGHT.                          
AND SO IN THIS CASE THOUGH THE  
PROBLEM WASN&apos;T THAT THERE WAS   

00:28:52.493 --> 00:28:53.091
AND SO IN THIS CASE THOUGH THE  
PROBLEM WASN&apos;T THAT THERE WAS   
JUST ONE BATHROOM.              

00:28:53.093 --> 00:28:53.658
PROBLEM WASN&apos;T THAT THERE WAS   
JUST ONE BATHROOM.              
THERE WAS ACTUALLY AN           

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.261
JUST ONE BATHROOM.              
THERE WAS ACTUALLY AN           
ACCESSIBLE BATHROOM BUT THE     

00:28:56.263 --> 00:28:57.062
THERE WAS ACTUALLY AN           
ACCESSIBLE BATHROOM BUT THE     
SIGN LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT     

00:28:57.064 --> 00:28:57.796
ACCESSIBLE BATHROOM BUT THE     
SIGN LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT     
THIS IS WHERE I WAS BEING       

00:28:57.798 --> 00:29:00.198
SIGN LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT     
THIS IS WHERE I WAS BEING       
ENCOURAGED TO LOOK.             

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.332
THIS IS WHERE I WAS BEING       
ENCOURAGED TO LOOK.             
AND IF YOU LOOKED AT THE HOW    

00:29:01.334 --> 00:29:02.067
ENCOURAGED TO LOOK.             
AND IF YOU LOOKED AT THE HOW    
STEEP THE STAIRS ARE WITH NO    

00:29:02.069 --> 00:29:04.269
AND IF YOU LOOKED AT THE HOW    
STEEP THE STAIRS ARE WITH NO    
HANDRAILS AGAIN ACCESS A        

00:29:04.271 --> 00:29:05.136
STEEP THE STAIRS ARE WITH NO    
HANDRAILS AGAIN ACCESS A        
FUNCTIONAL NEED EVEN FOR A      

00:29:05.138 --> 00:29:08.473
HANDRAILS AGAIN ACCESS A        
FUNCTIONAL NEED EVEN FOR A      
PREGNANT MOM OR AN OLDER        

00:29:08.475 --> 00:29:09.174
FUNCTIONAL NEED EVEN FOR A      
PREGNANT MOM OR AN OLDER        
PERSON, THIS COULD BE VERY      

00:29:09.176 --> 00:29:09.641
PREGNANT MOM OR AN OLDER        
PERSON, THIS COULD BE VERY      
DANGEROUS.                      

00:29:09.643 --> 00:29:16.114
PERSON, THIS COULD BE VERY      
DANGEROUS.                      
AND SO WE WE ASKED              

00:29:28.961 --> 00:29:30.729
                   THE SHELTER  
MANAGER TO LOOK AT THE          
ENVIRONMENT A LITTLE            

00:29:30.731 --> 00:29:31.529
MANAGER TO LOOK AT THE          
ENVIRONMENT A LITTLE            
DIFFERENTLY, LOOK FOR SIGNS SO  

00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:32.263
ENVIRONMENT A LITTLE            
DIFFERENTLY, LOOK FOR SIGNS SO  
YOU GUIDE PEOPLE INTO THE RIGHT 

00:29:32.265 --> 00:29:32.597
DIFFERENTLY, LOOK FOR SIGNS SO  
YOU GUIDE PEOPLE INTO THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION.                      

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:33.331
YOU GUIDE PEOPLE INTO THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION.                      
BUT HAVING THAT UNIVERSAL       

00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:34.065
DIRECTION.                      
BUT HAVING THAT UNIVERSAL       
SYMBOL OF ACCESS ON THERE IS IS 

00:29:34.067 --> 00:29:34.666
BUT HAVING THAT UNIVERSAL       
SYMBOL OF ACCESS ON THERE IS IS 
WHY THIS WAS PROBLEMATIC        

00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:35.466
SYMBOL OF ACCESS ON THERE IS IS 
WHY THIS WAS PROBLEMATIC        
BECAUSE IT LED ME TO BELIEVE    

00:29:35.468 --> 00:29:36.134
WHY THIS WAS PROBLEMATIC        
BECAUSE IT LED ME TO BELIEVE    
THIS WAS THE ONLY OPTION SO     

00:29:36.136 --> 00:29:36.935
BECAUSE IT LED ME TO BELIEVE    
THIS WAS THE ONLY OPTION SO     
THIS WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE 

00:29:36.937 --> 00:29:37.668
THIS WAS THE ONLY OPTION SO     
THIS WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE 
TYPE OF WORK THAT I DO IN THESE 

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:38.070
THIS WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE 
TYPE OF WORK THAT I DO IN THESE 
IN THESE AREAS.                 

00:29:38.072 --> 00:29:38.403
TYPE OF WORK THAT I DO IN THESE 
IN THESE AREAS.                 
RIGHT.                          

00:29:38.405 --> 00:29:39.204
IN THESE AREAS.                 
RIGHT.                          
AND THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT THE SIGN 

00:29:39.206 --> 00:29:39.737
RIGHT.                          
AND THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT THE SIGN 
LOOKED LIKE.                    

00:29:39.739 --> 00:29:40.271
AND THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT THE SIGN 
LOOKED LIKE.                    
SO THEY DID FIX THAT AND        

00:29:40.273 --> 00:29:40.839
LOOKED LIKE.                    
SO THEY DID FIX THAT AND        
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS A       

00:29:40.841 --> 00:29:41.506
SO THEY DID FIX THAT AND        
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS A       
BATHROOM THERE WHERE PEOPLE     

00:29:41.508 --> 00:29:42.240
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS A       
BATHROOM THERE WHERE PEOPLE     
COULD ACCESS IT AND SO WE       

00:29:42.242 --> 00:29:42.907
BATHROOM THERE WHERE PEOPLE     
COULD ACCESS IT AND SO WE       
WEREN&apos;T STUCK WITH THAT.        

00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:43.508
COULD ACCESS IT AND SO WE       
WEREN&apos;T STUCK WITH THAT.        
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT        

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.411
WEREN&apos;T STUCK WITH THAT.        
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT        
BECAUSE THIS TELLS ME IF YOU    

00:29:46.413 --> 00:29:47.312
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT        
BECAUSE THIS TELLS ME IF YOU    
HAVE A A DISASTER IN ANN ARBOR  

00:29:47.314 --> 00:29:50.682
BECAUSE THIS TELLS ME IF YOU    
HAVE A A DISASTER IN ANN ARBOR  
I LOOK AT SEVERAL DATA SETS TO  

00:29:50.684 --> 00:29:51.482
HAVE A A DISASTER IN ANN ARBOR  
I LOOK AT SEVERAL DATA SETS TO  
DETERMINE WHAT THE DISABILITY   

00:29:51.484 --> 00:29:54.085
I LOOK AT SEVERAL DATA SETS TO  
DETERMINE WHAT THE DISABILITY   
PROFILE IS OF THE PEOPLE WHO    

00:29:54.087 --> 00:29:57.122
DETERMINE WHAT THE DISABILITY   
PROFILE IS OF THE PEOPLE WHO    
ARE LIKELY IN THAT DISASTER BY  

00:29:57.124 --> 00:29:57.522
PROFILE IS OF THE PEOPLE WHO    
ARE LIKELY IN THAT DISASTER BY  
COUNTY.                         

00:29:57.524 --> 00:29:58.623
ARE LIKELY IN THAT DISASTER BY  
COUNTY.                         
WE START WITH THE U.S. CENSUS.  

00:29:58.625 --> 00:30:01.592
COUNTY.                         
WE START WITH THE U.S. CENSUS.  
OF COURSE IT&apos;S DATED DATA,      

00:30:01.594 --> 00:30:02.693
WE START WITH THE U.S. CENSUS.  
OF COURSE IT&apos;S DATED DATA,      
IT&apos;S EVERY TEN YEARS SO WE      

00:30:02.695 --> 00:30:05.263
OF COURSE IT&apos;S DATED DATA,      
IT&apos;S EVERY TEN YEARS SO WE      
DON&apos;T GO BY ONE DATA SET BUT WE 

00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:06.264
IT&apos;S EVERY TEN YEARS SO WE      
DON&apos;T GO BY ONE DATA SET BUT WE 
DO GET SORT OF AN APPROXIMATION 

00:30:06.266 --> 00:30:09.601
DON&apos;T GO BY ONE DATA SET BUT WE 
DO GET SORT OF AN APPROXIMATION 
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THAT  

00:30:09.603 --> 00:30:10.068
DO GET SORT OF AN APPROXIMATION 
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THAT  
IN THAT AREA.                   

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.102
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THAT  
IN THAT AREA.                   
WE ALSO LOOK AT THE SVI THESE   

00:30:11.104 --> 00:30:13.571
IN THAT AREA.                   
WE ALSO LOOK AT THE SVI THESE   
SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX      

00:30:13.573 --> 00:30:14.405
WE ALSO LOOK AT THE SVI THESE   
SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX      
WHICH GIVES US AN IDEA          

00:30:14.407 --> 00:30:17.108
SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX      
WHICH GIVES US AN IDEA          
OF WHETHER THERE&apos;S A SOCIAL     

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.975
WHICH GIVES US AN IDEA          
OF WHETHER THERE&apos;S A SOCIAL     
ECONOMIC DIMENSION TO THE       

00:30:17.977 --> 00:30:21.446
OF WHETHER THERE&apos;S A SOCIAL     
ECONOMIC DIMENSION TO THE       
DISASTER POPULATION.            

00:30:21.448 --> 00:30:22.614
ECONOMIC DIMENSION TO THE       
DISASTER POPULATION.            
IS IT A RURAL AREA OR ARE THEY  

00:30:22.616 --> 00:30:22.947

OUR STRATEGY FOR HOW WE         
COMMUNICATE AROUND THAT         
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DATA SO   

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.690
COMMUNICATE AROUND THAT         
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DATA SO   
WE LOOK AT THAT CONFIRMATORY    

00:31:39.692 --> 00:31:40.492
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DATA SO   
WE LOOK AT THAT CONFIRMATORY    
DATA TO GIVE MORE DIMENSION TO  

00:31:40.494 --> 00:31:43.562
WE LOOK AT THAT CONFIRMATORY

00:31:45.032 --> 00:31:45.831
GIVEN AREA.                     
AND THEN HERE&apos;S AN EXAMPLE      
OF HOW WE ACTUALLY PUT THAT TO  

00:31:45.833 --> 00:31:48.132
AND THEN HERE&apos;S AN EXAMPLE      
OF HOW WE ACTUALLY PUT THAT TO  
WORK FOR US.                    

00:31:48.134 --> 00:31:48.967
OF HOW WE ACTUALLY PUT THAT TO  
WORK FOR US.                    
WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE POWER

WORK FOR US.                    
WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE POWER   
OUTAGES.                        

00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:52.270
WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE POWER   
OUTAGES.                        
WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE ABOUT   

00:31:52.272 --> 00:31:53.004

WHO WERE ELECTRICITY DEPENDENT  

00:31:53.673 --> 00:31:56.875
ALMOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE   
WHO WERE ELECTRICITY DEPENDENT  
AND SO WE WHEN WE SENT OUT OUR  

00:31:56.877 --> 00:31:57.542
WHO WERE ELECTRICITY DEPENDENT  
AND SO WE WHEN WE SENT OUT OUR  
DISASTER SURVIVOR ASSISTANCE    

00:31:57.544 --> 00:31:59.811
AND SO WE WHEN WE SENT OUT OUR  
DISASTER SURVIVOR ASSISTANCE    
TEAMS TO CANVASS THE            

00:31:59.813 --> 00:32:00.578
DISASTER SURVIVOR ASSISTANCE    
TEAMS TO CANVASS THE            
NEIGHBORHOODS, WE WANTED THEM   

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.246
TEAMS TO CANVASS THE            
NEIGHBORHOODS, WE WANTED THEM   
TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT

TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT         
IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WHO WERE     

00:32:03.517 --> 00:32:04.182
TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT         
IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WHO WERE     
LIKELY POWER DEPENDENT,         

00:32:04.184 --> 00:32:06.985
IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WHO WERE     
LIKELY POWER DEPENDENT,         
DIALYSIS, OXYGEN DEPENDENT ALL  

00:32:06.987 --> 00:32:08.086
LIKELY POWER DEPENDENT,         
DIALYSIS, OXYGEN DEPENDENT ALL  
THE OTHER WAYS THIS IT COULD BE 

00:32:08.088 --> 00:32:10.822
DIALYSIS, OXYGEN DEPENDENT ALL  
THE OTHER WAYS THIS IT COULD BE 
I USE A POWER ASSIST WHEELCHAIR 

00:32:10.824 --> 00:32:11.823
THE OTHER WAYS THIS IT COULD BE 
I USE A POWER ASSIST WHEELCHAIR 
SO MY CHAIR IS POWER DEPENDENT. 

00:32:11.825 --> 00:32:14.659
I USE A POWER ASSIST WHEELCHAIR 
SO MY CHAIR IS POWER DEPENDENT. 
IF IT DIES A CHAIR BECOMES 50   

00:32:14.661 --> 00:32:15.226
SO MY CHAIR IS POWER DEPENDENT. 
IF IT DIES A CHAIR BECOMES 50   
POUNDS HEAVIER.                 

00:32:15.228 --> 00:32:15.760
IF IT DIES A CHAIR BECOMES 50   
POUNDS HEAVIER.                 
ALL RIGHT.                      

00:32:15.762 --> 00:32:16.627
POUNDS HEAVIER.                 
ALL RIGHT.                      
SO THAT&apos;S AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE   

00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:18.796
ALL RIGHT.                      
SO THAT&apos;S AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE   
WE TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE  

00:32:18.798 --> 00:32:19.564
SO THAT&apos;S AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE   
WE TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE  
INTENTIONAL AND GO BEYOND THE   

00:32:19.566 --> 00:32:20.432
WE TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE  
INTENTIONAL AND GO BEYOND THE   
DATA SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY  

00:32:20.434 --> 00:32:22.167
INTENTIONAL AND GO BEYOND THE   
DATA SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY  
GET PEOPLE CONNECTED TO         

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:26.605
DATA SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY  
GET PEOPLE CONNECTED TO         
RECOVERY A LOT FASTER.          

00:32:26.607 --> 00:32:28.006
GET PEOPLE CONNECTED TO         
RECOVERY A LOT FASTER.          
AND THIS JUST GIVES YOU AN IDEA 

00:32:28.008 --> 00:32:29.841
RECOVERY A LOT FASTER.          
AND THIS JUST GIVES YOU AN IDEA 
OF THE SORT OF FRAMEWORK THAT   

00:32:29.843 --> 00:32:33.811
AND THIS JUST GIVES YOU AN IDEA 
OF THE SORT OF FRAMEWORK THAT   
THAT I TRY TO EDUCATE ON THAT   

00:32:33.813 --> 00:32:34.780
OF THE SORT OF FRAMEWORK THAT   
THAT I TRY TO EDUCATE ON THAT   
TAKES THE FOCUS OFF OF A        

00:32:34.782 --> 00:32:37.782
THAT I TRY TO EDUCATE ON THAT   
TAKES THE FOCUS OFF OF A        
DIAGNOSIS OR HOW PEOPLE SHOW AS 

00:32:37.784 --> 00:32:38.450
TAKES THE FOCUS OFF OF A        
DIAGNOSIS OR HOW PEOPLE SHOW AS 
INDIVIDUALS AND WE PUT THE      

00:32:38.452 --> 00:32:39.117
DIAGNOSIS OR HOW PEOPLE SHOW AS 
INDIVIDUALS AND WE PUT THE      
FOCUS ON THE ENVIRONMENT.       

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:42.187
INDIVIDUALS AND WE PUT THE      
FOCUS ON THE ENVIRONMENT.       
ARE WE LOOKING AT COMMUNICATION 

00:32:42.189 --> 00:32:42.720
FOCUS ON THE ENVIRONMENT.       
ARE WE LOOKING AT COMMUNICATION 
FOR EVERYBODY?                  

00:32:42.722 --> 00:32:43.522
ARE WE LOOKING AT COMMUNICATION 
FOR EVERYBODY?                  
ARE WE LOOKING AT HOW EVERYBODY 

00:32:43.524 --> 00:32:46.224
FOR EVERYBODY?                  
ARE WE LOOKING AT HOW EVERYBODY 
MAINTAINS IF HOSPITALS WERE     

00:32:46.226 --> 00:32:46.524
ARE WE LOOKING AT HOW EVERYBODY 
MAINTAINS IF HOSPITALS WERE     
DAMAGED?                        

00:32:46.526 --> 00:32:47.392
MAINTAINS IF HOSPITALS WERE     
DAMAGED?                        
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE   

00:32:47.394 --> 00:32:50.428
DAMAGED?                        
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE   
RELIANT ON THE HOSPITAL THAN    

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.096
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE   
RELIANT ON THE HOSPITAL THAN    
OTHERS AS WAS THE CASE IN       

00:32:51.098 --> 00:32:53.097
RELIANT ON THE HOSPITAL THAN    
OTHERS AS WAS THE CASE IN       
ROLLING FORK, MISSISSIPPI.      

00:32:53.099 --> 00:32:53.898
OTHERS AS WAS THE CASE IN       
ROLLING FORK, MISSISSIPPI.      
THAT ENTIRE HOSPITAL WAS WIPED  

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.832
ROLLING FORK, MISSISSIPPI.      
THAT ENTIRE HOSPITAL WAS WIPED  
OUT SO WE HAD TO LOOK AT THAT   

00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:57.669
THAT ENTIRE HOSPITAL WAS WIPED  
OUT SO WE HAD TO LOOK AT THAT   
AS A A RISK FACTOR FOR PEOPLE   

00:32:57.671 --> 00:32:58.436
OUT SO WE HAD TO LOOK AT THAT   
AS A A RISK FACTOR FOR PEOPLE   
EVEN IF THEIR HOMES WERE        

00:32:58.438 --> 00:33:01.673
AS A A RISK FACTOR FOR PEOPLE   
EVEN IF THEIR HOMES WERE        
DAMAGED, IF THE HOSPITALS WIPED 

00:33:01.675 --> 00:33:02.407
EVEN IF THEIR HOMES WERE        
DAMAGED, IF THE HOSPITALS WIPED 
OUT AND YOU&apos;RE IN A RURAL AREA  

00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:04.976
DAMAGED, IF THE HOSPITALS WIPED 
OUT AND YOU&apos;RE IN A RURAL AREA  
THAT&apos;S A PROBLEM.               

00:33:04.978 --> 00:33:05.777
OUT AND YOU&apos;RE IN A RURAL AREA  
THAT&apos;S A PROBLEM.               
INDEPENDENTS WE NEED WE WANT    

00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:06.511
THAT&apos;S A PROBLEM.               
INDEPENDENTS WE NEED WE WANT    
PEOPLE TO BE AS INDEPENDENT AS

WE HAVE ACCESSIBLE SHELTERS IS  
ONE WAY TO DO THAT MAKING SURE

ONE WAY TO DO THAT MAKING SURE  
THAT WE HAVE ACCESSIBLE

00:55:41.399 --> 00:55:42.132
MOVIE THEATERS AND TRIED TO USE 
VISUAL DEVICES.                 
USING YOUR CELL PHONE DOESN&apos;T   

00:55:42.134 --> 00:55:45.201
VISUAL DEVICES.                 
USING YOUR CELL PHONE DOESN&apos;T
