                      SO THE    
WINDOWS SO WHAT ARE THE WINDOWS 
RIGHT NOW IF BECAUSE THEY HAVE  

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:36.556
WINDOWS SO WHAT ARE THE WINDOWS 
RIGHT NOW IF BECAUSE THEY HAVE  
TO MEET A PARTICULAR STANDARD

TO MEET A PARTICULAR STANDARD   
TO FUNCTION AND EGRESS WINDOW   
ARE THEY CASEMENT'S YES.        

00:19:43.197 --> 00:19:47.133
TO FUNCTION AND EGRESS WINDOW   
ARE THEY CASEMENT'S YES.        
SO THE CASEMENT'S AND THEY MEET 

00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:47.900
ARE THEY CASEMENT'S YES.        
SO THE CASEMENT'S AND THEY MEET 
THE OPENING WIDTH AND HEIGHT    

00:19:47.902 --> 00:19:51.103
SO THE CASEMENT'S AND THEY MEET 
THE OPENING WIDTH AND HEIGHT    
THAT'S REQUIRED FOR AN EGRESS   

00:19:51.105 --> 00:19:51.504
THE OPENING WIDTH AND HEIGHT    
THAT'S REQUIRED FOR AN EGRESS   
WINDOW.

WINDOW.                         
>> YES.                         
SO IS THERE A REASON WHY THERE  

00:19:54.642 --> 00:19:57.209
>> YES.                         
SO IS THERE A REASON WHY THERE  
WAS A NOTE THAT THEY WERE GOING 

00:19:57.211 --> 00:20:02.080
SO IS THERE A REASON WHY THERE  
WAS A NOTE THAT THEY WERE GOING 
TO BE REWORKED BY I DON'T KNOW  

00:20:02.082 --> 00:20:02.848
WAS A NOTE THAT THEY WERE GOING 
TO BE REWORKED BY I DON'T KNOW  
THE ARCHITECT PUT THAT IN THERE 

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:08.621
TO BE REWORKED BY I DON'T KNOW  
THE ARCHITECT PUT THAT IN THERE 
ORIGINALLY BUT WE TOOK IT THERE 

00:20:08.623 --> 00:20:09.489
THE ARCHITECT PUT THAT IN THERE 
ORIGINALLY BUT WE TOOK IT THERE 
ARE A COUPLE OF WINDOWS THAT    

00:20:09.491 --> 00:20:12.724
ORIGINALLY BUT WE TOOK IT THERE 
ARE A COUPLE OF WINDOWS THAT    
ARE NOT THE SAME.               

00:20:12.726 --> 00:20:13.426
ARE A COUPLE OF WINDOWS THAT    
ARE NOT THE SAME.               
SOME OF THOSE ARE STARK         

00:20:13.428 --> 00:20:13.826
ARE NOT THE SAME.               
SOME OF THOSE ARE STARK         
WINDOWS.                        

00:20:13.828 --> 00:20:16.495
SOME OF THOSE ARE STARK         
WINDOWS.                        
SOME ARE REPLACEMENT WINDOWS    

00:20:16.497 --> 00:20:17.396
WINDOWS.                        
SOME ARE REPLACEMENT WINDOWS    
AND THERE'S SOME ALSO WOOD      

00:20:17.398 --> 00:20:20.933
SOME ARE REPLACEMENT WINDOWS    
AND THERE'S SOME ALSO WOOD      
CASEMENT WINDOWS IN THERE ALSO. 

00:20:20.935 --> 00:20:24.203
AND THERE'S SOME ALSO WOOD      
CASEMENT WINDOWS IN THERE ALSO. 
SO THERE'S A VARIANCE           

00:20:24.205 --> 00:20:30.709
CASEMENT WINDOWS IN THERE ALSO. 
SO THERE'S A VARIANCE           
OF DIFFERENT WINDOWS.           

00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:34.713
SO THERE'S A VARIANCE           
OF DIFFERENT WINDOWS.           
IS THERE IS THERE A RULE OR     

00:20:34.715 --> 00:20:38.150
OF DIFFERENT WINDOWS.           
IS THERE IS THERE A RULE OR     
CODE TO HOW MANY INCHES THE     

00:20:38.152 --> 00:20:39.151
IS THERE IS THERE A RULE OR     
CODE TO HOW MANY INCHES THE     
WINDOW HAS TO BE OFF THE GROUND 

00:20:39.153 --> 00:20:41.954

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:46.692
FOR OBSTRUCTIONS TO MAXIMUM     
FORTY FOR NO OUTSIDE THAT THIS  
IS GRADE LEVEL AND THAT'S WHY   

00:20:46.694 --> 00:20:50.095
FORTY FOR NO OUTSIDE THAT THIS  
IS GRADE LEVEL AND THAT'S WHY   
WINDOWS ARE MADE BECAUSE I'M    

00:20:50.097 --> 00:20:50.830
IS GRADE LEVEL AND THAT'S WHY   
WINDOWS ARE MADE BECAUSE I'M    
PRETTY SURE THERE'S A SIX INCH  

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:54.132
WINDOWS ARE MADE BECAUSE I'M    
PRETTY SURE THERE'S A SIX INCH

OUT AND THERE'S BEEN IT GETS    
BLOCKED, DEBRIS DOES FALL OVER  
LIKE IS IT ALLOWED TO BE        

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:09.916
BLOCKED, DEBRIS DOES FALL OVER
