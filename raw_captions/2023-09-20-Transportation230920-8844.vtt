TRAFFIC VOLUME AT THESE         
INTERCHANGES IS GOING TO MAKE   

00:27:11.905 --> 00:27:15.273
TRAFFIC VOLUME AT THESE         
INTERCHANGES IS GOING TO MAKE   
IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HAVE SAFE  

00:27:15.275 --> 00:27:18.910
INTERCHANGES IS GOING TO MAKE   
IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HAVE SAFE  
NON MOTORIZED ROUTES THROUGH    

00:27:18.912 --> 00:27:19.244
IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HAVE SAFE  
NON MOTORIZED ROUTES THROUGH    
THERE.                          

00:27:19.246 --> 00:27:20.178
NON MOTORIZED ROUTES THROUGH    
THERE.                          
SO I THINK IT IS WORTH          

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.148
THERE.                          
SO I THINK IT IS WORTH          
MENTIONING THAT WE&apos;RE NOT IN    

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.050
SO I THINK IT IS WORTH          
MENTIONING THAT WE&apos;RE NOT IN    
FAVOR OF THINGS LIKE NEW LANES  

00:27:26.052 --> 00:27:26.752
MENTIONING THAT WE&apos;RE NOT IN    
FAVOR OF THINGS LIKE NEW LANES  
ON US TWENTY THREE THAT WILL    

00:27:26.754 --> 00:27:27.219

ON US TWENTY THREE THAT WILL    
INCREASE VOLUME.                

00:27:27.221 --> 00:27:28.053
ON US TWENTY THREE THAT WILL    
INCREASE VOLUME.                
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY     

00:27:28.055 --> 00:27:30.456
INCREASE VOLUME.                
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY     
GOOD COMMENT THAT WE HEARD      

00:27:30.458 --> 00:27:31.189
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY     
GOOD COMMENT THAT WE HEARD      
EARLIER IN THE IN THE MEETING.  

00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:34.459
GOOD COMMENT THAT WE HEARD      
EARLIER IN THE IN THE MEETING.  
SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN     

00:27:34.461 --> 00:27:35.194
EARLIER IN THE IN THE MEETING.  
SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN     
APPROPRIATE THING TO ADD TO     

00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:41.200
SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN     
APPROPRIATE THING TO ADD TO     
THIS RESOLUTION                 

00:27:41.468 --> 00:27:46.104
               .                
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS SOME 
INTEREST IN AMENDMENT TO ADD A  

00:27:46.106 --> 00:27:46.505
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS SOME 
INTEREST IN AMENDMENT TO ADD A  
RESOLVED CLAUSE.                

00:27:46.507 --> 00:27:49.107
INTEREST IN AMENDMENT TO ADD A  
RESOLVED CLAUSE.                
IS THAT A MOTION TO REJECT A    

00:27:49.109 --> 00:27:52.944

WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC TOOLS     
THAT ARE ELIGIBLE IN THIS       
PROGRAM WHERE THE STREETS ARE   

00:55:13.352 --> 00:55:16.353
THAT ARE ELIGIBLE IN THIS       
PROGRAM WHERE THE STREETS ARE   
ELIGIBLE FOR THAT INPUT THAT WE 

00:55:16.355 --> 00:55:17.221
PROGRAM WHERE THE STREETS ARE   
ELIGIBLE FOR THAT INPUT THAT WE 
HAVE ASKED PEOPLE TO PROVIDE US

IN THE PAST AND ARE FREQUENTLY  
ASKED QUESTIONS AND THE MAP I   
JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO   

00:55:25.264 --> 00:55:28.598
ASKED QUESTIONS AND THE MAP I   
JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO   
REVIEW THAT WE DO HAVE A HIGH,  

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.101
JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO   
REVIEW THAT WE DO HAVE A HIGH,  
MEDIUM AND LOW CATEGORIZATION   

00:55:31.103 --> 00:55:31.968
REVIEW THAT WE DO HAVE A HIGH,  
MEDIUM AND LOW CATEGORIZATION   
FOR ALL OF OUR MAJOR STREET AND 

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:35.405
MEDIUM AND LOW CATEGORIZATION   
FOR ALL OF OUR MAJOR STREET AND 
THIS WAS REALLY BASED ON A NEAT 

00:55:35.407 --> 00:55:38.975
FOR ALL OF OUR MAJOR STREET AND 
THIS WAS REALLY BASED ON A NEAT 
SCORE ON THE SEVERITY           

00:55:38.977 --> 00:55:39.643
THIS WAS REALLY BASED ON A NEAT 
SCORE ON THE SEVERITY           
OF CRASHES AND WHETHER THEY     

00:55:39.645 --> 00:55:40.444
SCORE ON THE SEVERITY           
OF CRASHES AND WHETHER THEY     
WERE IDENTIFIED AS A TIER ONE   

00:55:40.446 --> 00:55:43.646
OF CRASHES AND WHETHER THEY     
WERE IDENTIFIED AS A TIER ONE   
OR TIER TWO ROADWAY AND THEN    

00:55:43.648 --> 00:55:47.684
WERE IDENTIFIED AS A TIER ONE   
OR TIER TWO ROADWAY AND THEN    
THEY TOOK THE SUMMATION OF ALL  

00:55:47.686 --> 00:55:48.485
OR TIER TWO ROADWAY AND THEN    
THEY TOOK THE SUMMATION OF ALL  
OF THOSE AND REALLY SPLIT THEM  

00:55:48.487 --> 00:55:51.488
THEY TOOK THE SUMMATION OF ALL  
OF THOSE AND REALLY SPLIT THEM  
INTO THIRDS BY MEDIUM AND LOW   

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:55.092
OF THOSE AND REALLY SPLIT THEM  
INTO THIRDS BY MEDIUM AND LOW   
BASED ON THAT SEVERITY AND I AM 

00:55:55.094 --> 00:55:56.025
INTO THIRDS BY MEDIUM AND LOW   
BASED ON THAT SEVERITY AND I AM 
GOING TO JUST WALK THROUGH THE  

00:55:56.027 --> 00:55:59.029
BASED ON THAT SEVERITY AND I AM 
GOING TO JUST WALK THROUGH THE  
TOOL RATHER QUICKLY.            

00:55:59.031 --> 00:56:03.466
GOING TO JUST WALK THROUGH THE  
TOOL RATHER QUICKLY.            
BUT AGAIN, THE GREAT THING WITH 

00:56:03.468 --> 00:56:06.002
TOOL RATHER QUICKLY.            
BUT AGAIN, THE GREAT THING WITH 
THIS TOOL IS ANYONE CAN GO UP   

00:56:06.004 --> 00:56:07.104
BUT AGAIN, THE GREAT THING WITH 
THIS TOOL IS ANYONE CAN GO UP   
TO THE TABS AT THE TOP AND SKIP 

00:56:07.106 --> 00:56:10.039
THIS TOOL IS ANYONE CAN GO UP   
TO THE TABS AT THE TOP AND SKIP 
TO A PARTICULAR SECTION THEY    

00:56:10.041 --> 00:56:13.777
TO THE TABS AT THE TOP AND SKIP 
TO A PARTICULAR SECTION THEY    
WANT OR SOMEONE CAN SCROLL      

00:56:13.779 --> 00:56:14.611
TO A PARTICULAR SECTION THEY    
WANT OR SOMEONE CAN SCROLL      
THROUGH THE SAME INFORMATION.   

00:56:14.613 --> 00:56:18.181
WANT OR SOMEONE CAN SCROLL      
THROUGH THE SAME INFORMATION.   
SO AGAIN IT PROVIDES BACKGROUND 

00:56:18.183 --> 00:56:18.749
THROUGH THE SAME INFORMATION.   
SO AGAIN IT PROVIDES BACKGROUND 
ON WHY MAJOR STREETS ARE        

00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:21.718
SO AGAIN IT PROVIDES BACKGROUND 
ON WHY MAJOR STREETS ARE        
IMPORTANT, WHY WE&apos;RE FOCUSING   

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.886
ON WHY MAJOR STREETS ARE        
IMPORTANT, WHY WE&apos;RE FOCUSING   
THIS PROGRAM ON THAT, HOW WE

ONE OF THE REASON YOU MAY HAVE  

01:05:01.205 --> 01:05:01.904
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THAT.          
ONE OF THE REASON YOU MAY HAVE  
HEARD SUZANNE MENTION THAT WE   

01:05:01.906 --> 01:05:02.705
ONE OF THE REASON YOU MAY HAVE  
HEARD SUZANNE MENTION THAT WE

01:05:02.707 --> 01:05:05.007
HEARD SUZANNE MENTION THAT WE

01:05:05.009 --> 01:05:05.642
ARE THINKING ABOUT USING KIND   
OF TEMPORARY DEVICES OR THINGS  
LIKE THAT ARE THE REASON FOR    

01:05:05.644 --> 01:05:08.511
OF TEMPORARY DEVICES OR THINGS  
LIKE THAT ARE THE REASON FOR    
THAT IS BASED ON OUR            

01:05:08.513 --> 01:05:09.245
LIKE THAT ARE THE REASON FOR    
THAT IS BASED ON OUR            
CONVERSATIONS WITH FEDERAL      

01:05:09.247 --> 01:05:09.912
THAT IS BASED ON OUR            
CONVERSATIONS WITH FEDERAL      
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE  

01:05:09.914 --> 01:05:12.314
CONVERSATIONS WITH FEDERAL      
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE  
OF THE GRANT THAT WE RECEIVE    

01:05:12.316 --> 01:05:13.149
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE  
OF THE GRANT THAT WE RECEIVE    
WHICH WAS A PLANNING GRANT, WE  

01:05:13.151 --> 01:05:15.785
OF THE GRANT THAT WE RECEIVE    
WHICH WAS A PLANNING GRANT, WE  
HAVE TO KIND OF EVALUATE THE    

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:16.385
WHICH WAS A PLANNING GRANT, WE  
HAVE TO KIND OF EVALUATE THE    
EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE          

01:05:16.387 --> 01:05:17.120
HAVE TO KIND OF EVALUATE THE    
EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE          
DEPLOYMENTS BEFORE THEY CAN BE  

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:19.688
EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE          
DEPLOYMENTS BEFORE THEY CAN BE  
PUT IN INCREMENTS.              

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:20.890
DEPLOYMENTS BEFORE THEY CAN BE  
PUT IN INCREMENTS.              
AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE       

01:05:20.892 --> 01:05:23.760
PUT IN INCREMENTS.              
AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE       
REASONS WHY WE&apos;RE TAKING THAT   

01:05:23.762 --> 01:05:24.094
AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE       
REASONS WHY WE&apos;RE TAKING THAT   
APPROACH.                       

01:05:24.096 --> 01:05:24.761
REASONS WHY WE&apos;RE TAKING THAT   
APPROACH.                       
BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS SOME         

01:05:24.763 --> 01:05:25.295
APPROACH.                       
BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS SOME         
FLEXIBILITY FOR US.             

01:05:25.297 --> 01:05:27.296
BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS SOME         
FLEXIBILITY FOR US.             
IT REALLY ALLOWS TO LEARN AND   

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:27.764
FLEXIBILITY FOR US.             
IT REALLY ALLOWS TO LEARN AND   
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.               

01:05:27.766 --> 01:05:31.734
IT REALLY ALLOWS TO LEARN AND   
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.               
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A VALUABLE LESSON     

01:05:31.736 --> 01:05:32.601
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.               
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A VALUABLE LESSON     
WE&apos;RE LEARNING AS PART OF A     

01:05:32.603 --> 01:05:33.336
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A VALUABLE LESSON     
WE&apos;RE LEARNING AS PART OF A     
QUICK ONE WHERE WE&apos;VE HAD TO    

01:05:33.338 --> 01:05:33.937
WE&apos;RE LEARNING AS PART OF A     
QUICK ONE WHERE WE&apos;VE HAD TO    
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS EVEN WITH A    

01:05:33.939 --> 01:05:35.838
QUICK ONE WHERE WE&apos;VE HAD TO    
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS EVEN WITH A    
LITTLE LITIGATOR&apos;S.             

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.806
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS EVEN WITH A    
LITTLE LITIGATOR&apos;S.             
SO WE THINK THAT APPROACH MAKES 

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:39.442
LITTLE LITIGATOR&apos;S.             
SO WE THINK THAT APPROACH MAKES 
SENSE EVEN IN THIS APPLICATION  

01:05:39.444 --> 01:05:40.410
SO WE THINK THAT APPROACH MAKES 
SENSE EVEN IN THIS APPLICATION  
AND OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKET     

01:05:40.412 --> 01:05:42.711
SENSE EVEN IN THIS APPLICATION  
AND OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKET     
WHERE YOU CAN GET LIKE RECYCLED 

01:05:42.713 --> 01:05:43.746
AND OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKET     
WHERE YOU CAN GET LIKE RECYCLED 
RUBBER SPEEDUPS FOR EXAMPLE, IF 

01:05:43.748 --> 01:05:47.783
WHERE YOU CAN GET LIKE RECYCLED 
RUBBER SPEEDUPS FOR EXAMPLE, IF 
HE ACTUALLY DEPLOYS.            

01:05:47.785 --> 01:05:48.685
RUBBER SPEEDUPS FOR EXAMPLE, IF 
HE ACTUALLY DEPLOYS.            
SO JUST USING THAT AS KIND      

01:05:48.687 --> 01:05:51.387
HE ACTUALLY DEPLOYS.            
SO JUST USING THAT AS KIND      
OF AN EXAMPLE AS FOR WHY WE DO  

01:05:51.389 --> 01:05:52.022
SO JUST USING THAT AS KIND      
OF AN EXAMPLE AS FOR WHY WE DO  
THAT AND THEN MAYBE SUZANNE,    

01:05:52.024 --> 01:05:54.990
OF AN EXAMPLE AS FOR WHY WE DO  
THAT AND THEN MAYBE SUZANNE,    
THE OTHER THING I MIGHT JUST    

01:05:54.992 --> 01:05:55.825
THAT AND THEN MAYBE SUZANNE,    
THE OTHER THING I MIGHT JUST    
WANT TO UNPACK OR JUST A QUICK  

01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:58.828
THE OTHER THING I MIGHT JUST    
WANT TO UNPACK OR JUST A QUICK  
SECOND IS THE ENGAGEMENT IS     

01:05:58.830 --> 01:05:59.395
WANT TO UNPACK OR JUST A QUICK  
SECOND IS THE ENGAGEMENT IS     
INFORM AND CONSULT.             

01:05:59.397 --> 01:06:03.133
SECOND IS THE ENGAGEMENT IS     
INFORM AND CONSULT.             
SO THE IDEA MANY OF YOU ARE     

01:06:03.135 --> 01:06:05.869
INFORM AND CONSULT.             
SO THE IDEA MANY OF YOU ARE     
FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT SOME     

01:06:05.871 --> 01:06:06.536
SO THE IDEA MANY OF YOU ARE     
FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT SOME     
OF THE SPECTRUM OF PUBLIC       

01:06:06.538 --> 01:06:07.303
FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT SOME     
OF THE SPECTRUM OF PUBLIC       
ENGAGEMENT KIND OF STARTS ON    

01:06:07.305 --> 01:06:10.473
OF THE SPECTRUM OF PUBLIC       
ENGAGEMENT KIND OF STARTS ON    
ONE END OF INFORM AND ON THE    

01:06:10.475 --> 01:06:13.876
ENGAGEMENT KIND OF STARTS ON    
ONE END OF INFORM AND ON THE    
OTHER END GOES TO EMPOWER.      

01:06:13.878 --> 01:06:17.814
ONE END OF INFORM AND ON THE    
OTHER END GOES TO EMPOWER.      
&gt;&gt; THE IDEA IS THAT THESE ARE   

01:06:17.816 --> 01:06:18.614
OTHER END GOES TO EMPOWER.      
&gt;&gt; THE IDEA IS THAT THESE ARE   
REALLY DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS.   

01:06:18.616 --> 01:06:19.549
&gt;&gt; THE IDEA IS THAT THESE ARE   
REALLY DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS.   
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE REFLECTED WHAT THE  

01:06:19.551 --> 01:06:22.651
REALLY DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS.

WE&apos;LL MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS   
BASED ON THAT.                  
BUT REALLY IT&apos;S NOT WE&apos;RE       

01:06:34.932 --> 01:06:38.067
BASED ON THAT.                  
BUT REALLY IT&apos;S NOT WE&apos;RE

DISTINCTION BECAUSE I THINK     
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT

DISTRACTIONS THE KINDS OF DATA  

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:45.802
SAID THIS I HAVE SOME           
DISTRACTIONS THE KINDS OF DATA  
COLLECTION AND TRACKING THAT    

01:07:45.804 --> 01:07:46.402
DISTRACTIONS THE KINDS OF DATA  
COLLECTION AND TRACKING THAT    
ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.            

01:07:46.404 --> 01:07:47.137
COLLECTION AND TRACKING THAT    
ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.            
SO I KNOW IN OTHER PROJECTS     

01:07:47.139 --> 01:07:47.771
ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.            
SO I KNOW IN OTHER PROJECTS     
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC   

01:07:47.773 --> 01:07:48.571
SO I KNOW IN OTHER PROJECTS     
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC   
BACKLASH, THINGS THAT ARE       

01:07:48.573 --> 01:07:49.072
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC   
BACKLASH, THINGS THAT ARE       
REALLY VISIBLE LIKE MAIN        

01:07:49.074 --> 01:07:49.739
BACKLASH, THINGS THAT ARE       
REALLY VISIBLE LIKE MAIN        
STREET, IT&apos;S BEEN REALLY        

01:07:49.741 --> 01:07:50.473

VALUABLE TO SAY LIKE YOU&apos;RE     
ACTUALLY ONLY BEING SLOWED DOWN 
30 SECONDS AT PEAK TIMES OR     

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:52.742
ACTUALLY ONLY BEING SLOWED DOWN 
30 SECONDS AT PEAK TIMES OR     
WHATEVER KINDS OF DATA IS THERE 

01:07:52.744 --> 01:07:55.377
30 SECONDS AT PEAK TIMES OR     
WHATEVER KINDS OF DATA IS THERE 
TO SORT OF COUNTER THE FEELINGS 

01:07:55.379 --> 01:07:56.045
WHATEVER KINDS OF DATA IS THERE 
TO SORT OF COUNTER THE FEELINGS 
THAT PEOPLE BRING TO THESE      

01:07:56.047 --> 01:07:56.513
TO SORT OF COUNTER THE FEELINGS 
THAT PEOPLE BRING TO THESE      
KINDS OF THINGS.                

01:07:56.515 --> 01:07:59.582
THAT PEOPLE BRING TO THESE      
KINDS OF THINGS.                
AND SO I&apos;M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT   

01:07:59.584 --> 01:08:00.250
KINDS OF THINGS.                
AND SO I&apos;M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT   
THAT DATA COLLECTION IS GOING   

01:08:00.252 --> 01:08:03.720
AND SO I&apos;M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT   
THAT DATA COLLECTION IS GOING   
TO LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE PLANS 

01:08:03.722 --> 01:08:06.956
THAT DATA COLLECTION IS GOING   
TO LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE PLANS 
ARE FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.         

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.057
TO LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE PLANS 
ARE FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.         
AND AGAIN, NON ENGINEER I THINK 

01:08:08.059 --> 01:08:10.860
ARE FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.         
AND AGAIN, NON ENGINEER I THINK 
ONE OF THE BEST PIECES          

01:08:10.862 --> 01:08:11.795
AND AGAIN, NON ENGINEER I THINK 
ONE OF THE BEST PIECES          
OF INFORMATION THAT WE CAN HAVE 

01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:13.863
ONE OF THE BEST PIECES          
OF INFORMATION THAT WE CAN HAVE 
IS COLLECTING THIS DATA BEFORE  

01:08:13.865 --> 01:08:14.630
OF INFORMATION THAT WE CAN HAVE 
IS COLLECTING THIS DATA BEFORE  
UTILIZING THAT UTILIZING OUR    

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:18.067
IS COLLECTING THIS DATA BEFORE  
UTILIZING THAT UTILIZING OUR    
CURRENT CAMERA TECHNOLOGY TO    

01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:19.034
UTILIZING THAT UTILIZING OUR    
CURRENT CAMERA TECHNOLOGY TO    
SEE WHAT THAT DELAY IS AT THE   

01:08:19.036 --> 01:08:22.071
CURRENT CAMERA TECHNOLOGY TO    
SEE WHAT THAT DELAY IS AT THE   
SIGNALS AND THAT&apos;S OBVIOUSLY    

01:08:22.073 --> 01:08:22.604
SEE WHAT THAT DELAY IS AT THE   
SIGNALS AND THAT&apos;S OBVIOUSLY    
INTERSECTION BASED.             

01:08:22.606 --> 01:08:23.539
SIGNALS AND THAT&apos;S OBVIOUSLY    
INTERSECTION BASED.             
AND THEN WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT    

01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:26.342
INTERSECTION BASED.             
AND THEN WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT    
THE CRASHES WHICH WE ARE        

01:08:26.344 --> 01:08:27.076
AND THEN WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT    
THE CRASHES WHICH WE ARE        
OBVIOUSLY INFORMED OF THOSE     

01:08:27.078 --> 01:08:30.546
THE CRASHES WHICH WE ARE        
OBVIOUSLY INFORMED OF THOSE     
CRASHES AND THEN WE RECEIVED    

01:08:30.548 --> 01:08:31.280
OBVIOUSLY INFORMED OF THOSE     
CRASHES AND THEN WE RECEIVED    
THE FINALIZED CRASH DATA.       

01:08:31.282 --> 01:08:33.982
CRASHES AND THEN WE RECEIVED    
THE FINALIZED CRASH DATA.       
SO I FEEL LIKE THOSE THREE      

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:34.750
THE FINALIZED CRASH DATA.       
SO I FEEL LIKE THOSE THREE      
COMPONENTS STAFF HAVE ACCESS TO 

01:08:34.752 --> 01:08:38.554
SO I FEEL LIKE THOSE THREE      
COMPONENTS STAFF HAVE ACCESS TO 
AND ARE EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO  

01:08:38.556 --> 01:08:41.824
COMPONENTS STAFF HAVE ACCESS TO 
AND ARE EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO  
ANALYZE FAIRLY QUICKLY AND OUR  

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:42.591
AND ARE EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO  
ANALYZE FAIRLY QUICKLY AND OUR  
USED TO COLLECTING THAT         

01:08:42.593 --> 01:08:43.292
ANALYZE FAIRLY QUICKLY AND OUR  
USED TO COLLECTING THAT         
INFORMATION AND IT WILL HAVE TO 

01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:45.961
USED TO COLLECTING THAT         
INFORMATION AND IT WILL HAVE TO 
BE A KIND OF BEFORE CONDITION   

01:08:45.963 --> 01:08:46.929
INFORMATION AND IT WILL HAVE TO 
BE A KIND OF BEFORE CONDITION   
DURING WE NEED TO LET THINGS    

01:08:46.931 --> 01:08:49.999
BE A KIND OF BEFORE CONDITION   
DURING WE NEED TO LET THINGS    
NORMALIZE AND THEN AFTER AND    

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.000
DURING WE NEED TO LET THINGS    
NORMALIZE AND THEN AFTER AND    
THAT IS ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT   

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:51.734
NORMALIZE AND THEN AFTER AND    
THAT IS ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT   
WE ALSO CALLED OUT IN THE GRANT 

01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:52.235
THAT IS ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT   
WE ALSO CALLED OUT IN THE GRANT 
APPLICATION.                    

01:08:52.237 --> 01:08:54.871
WE ALSO CALLED OUT IN THE GRANT 
APPLICATION.                    
SO THAT WOULD BE PART OF OUR    

01:08:54.873 --> 01:08:55.504
APPLICATION.                    
SO THAT WOULD BE PART OF OUR    
REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN        

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:58.041
SO THAT WOULD BE PART OF OUR    
REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN        
FEDERAL HIGHWAY AS WELL.        

01:08:58.043 --> 01:08:58.907
REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN

DEDICATED LEFT TURN LANE.       
SO AGAIN, AS YOU CAN KIND       
OF APPRECIATE FOR CARS AND YOU

THEREFORE MAY REAR END THAT     
VEHICLE.                        
SO THE ADDITION OF THE CENTER   

01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:48.890
VEHICLE.                        
SO THE ADDITION OF THE CENTER   
TURN ALLOWS FOR VEHICLES TO     

01:24:48.892 --> 01:24:49.758
SO THE ADDITION OF THE CENTER   
TURN ALLOWS FOR VEHICLES TO

KNOW, TAKE THEIR TURN AS IT     
WERE.                           
IT ALSO REDUCES RIGHT ANGLE     

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.042
WERE.                           
IT ALSO REDUCES RIGHT ANGLE     
CRASHES AS A SIDE STREET        

01:25:07.044 --> 01:25:07.909
IT ALSO REDUCES RIGHT ANGLE     
CRASHES AS A SIDE STREET        
MOTORISTS CROSS THREE VERSUS

01:25:08.512 --> 01:25:11.446
MOTORISTS CROSS THREE VERSUS    
FOUR LANES OF TRAVEL.           
SO YOU JUST HAVE LESS COGNITIVE 

01:25:11.448 --> 01:25:12.581
FOUR LANES OF TRAVEL.           
SO YOU JUST HAVE LESS COGNITIVE 
BURDEN TO BE ABLE TO FIND A GAP 

01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:15.450
SO YOU JUST HAVE LESS COGNITIVE 
BURDEN TO BE ABLE TO FIND A GAP 
ACROSS OR LANES.

YOU ONLY HAVE THREE LANES AND   
REALLY TO TRAVEL LANES TO TO    
THREAD THE NEEDLE BETWEEN THERE 

01:25:19.022 --> 01:25:22.024
REALLY TO TRAVEL LANES TO TO    
THREAD THE NEEDLE BETWEEN THERE 
ARE FEWER LANES FOR PEDESTRIANS 

01:25:22.026 --> 01:25:22.424
THREAD THE NEEDLE BETWEEN THERE 
ARE FEWER LANES FOR PEDESTRIANS 
ACROSS.                         

01:25:22.426 --> 01:25:23.358
ARE FEWER LANES FOR PEDESTRIANS 
ACROSS.                         
THERE&apos;S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO  

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.461
ACROSS.                         
THERE&apos;S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO  
INSTALL PEDESTRIAN REFUGE       

01:25:26.463 --> 01:25:27.129
THERE&apos;S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO  
INSTALL PEDESTRIAN REFUGE       
ISLANDS IN THAT CENTER TURN

THEY HAVE OTHER RESOURCES       

01:29:42.386 --> 01:29:43.251
CONTEXT SENSITIVE SOLUTIONS.    
THEY HAVE OTHER RESOURCES       
RELATED TO ROAD DIETS THAT WE   

01:29:43.253 --> 01:29:46.187
THEY HAVE OTHER RESOURCES       
RELATED TO ROAD DIETS THAT WE   
CAN OFTEN GO TO TO ANALYZE      

01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.921
RELATED TO ROAD DIETS THAT WE   
CAN OFTEN GO TO TO ANALYZE      
THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN WHICH    

01:29:46.923 --> 01:29:48.890
CAN OFTEN GO TO TO ANALYZE      
THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN WHICH    
DATA WE SHOULD COLLECTING AND   

01:29:48.892 --> 01:29:52.660
THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN WHICH    
DATA WE SHOULD COLLECTING AND   
SO FORTH AND SO ON.

THOSE INTENDED BENEFITS ARE AS  
PART OF THE ROAD DIET.          
&gt;&gt; SO NOW WHAT I&apos;D LIKE TO DO   

01:30:47.184 --> 01:30:50.818
PART OF THE ROAD DIET.          
&gt;&gt; SO NOW WHAT I&apos;D LIKE TO DO   
AND I WILL NOTE THIS IS NOT AN  

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:53.587
&gt;&gt; SO NOW WHAT I&apos;D LIKE TO DO   
AND I WILL NOTE THIS IS NOT AN  
EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF EVERY ROAD   

01:30:53.589 --> 01:30:54.689
AND I WILL NOTE THIS IS NOT AN  
EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF EVERY ROAD   
THAT WE HAVE DONE OR WILL DO.   

01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:55.623
EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF EVERY ROAD   
THAT WE HAVE DONE OR WILL DO.   
IT&apos;S REALLY JUST MEANT TO KIND  

01:30:55.625 --> 01:30:57.859
THAT WE HAVE DONE OR WILL DO.   
IT&apos;S REALLY JUST MEANT TO KIND  
OF GIVE A LITTLE CONTEXT IN     

01:30:57.861 --> 01:30:58.726
IT&apos;S REALLY JUST MEANT TO KIND  
OF GIVE A LITTLE CONTEXT IN     
TERMS OF SOME OF THE MORE       

01:30:58.728 --> 01:31:01.962
OF GIVE A LITTLE CONTEXT IN     
TERMS OF SOME OF THE MORE       
RECENT ROAD RECONFIGURING ONES  

01:31:01.964 --> 01:31:02.863
TERMS OF SOME OF THE MORE       
RECENT ROAD RECONFIGURING ONES  
THAT I&apos;M KIND OF FAMILIAR WITH  

01:31:02.865 --> 01:31:03.598
RECENT ROAD RECONFIGURING ONES  
THAT I&apos;M KIND OF FAMILIAR WITH  
SINCE I&apos;VE BEEN HERE AT THE     

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:06.401
THAT I&apos;M KIND OF FAMILIAR WITH  
SINCE I&apos;VE BEEN HERE AT THE     
CITY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  

01:31:06.403 --> 01:31:09.938
SINCE I&apos;VE BEEN HERE AT THE     
CITY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  
SO WHEN I FIRST CAME TO TOWN IN 

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:10.805
CITY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  
SO WHEN I FIRST CAME TO TOWN IN 
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE JUST PUT IN  

01:31:10.807 --> 01:31:14.042
SO WHEN I FIRST CAME TO TOWN IN 
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE JUST PUT IN  
THE NORTH MAPLE ROAD SO AGAIN   

01:31:14.044 --> 01:31:15.142
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE JUST PUT IN  
THE NORTH MAPLE ROAD SO AGAIN   
YOU CAN SEE THE PICTURE ON THE  

01:31:15.144 --> 01:31:17.579
THE NORTH MAPLE ROAD SO AGAIN   
YOU CAN SEE THE PICTURE ON THE  
LEFT IS THE BEFORE CONDITION    

01:31:17.581 --> 01:31:18.179
YOU CAN SEE THE PICTURE ON THE  
LEFT IS THE BEFORE CONDITION    
WHICH WAS TWO LANES OF TRAVEL   

01:31:18.181 --> 01:31:21.282
LEFT IS THE BEFORE CONDITION    
WHICH WAS TWO LANES OF TRAVEL   
IN EACH DIRECTION AND THEN THE  

01:31:21.284 --> 01:31:21.983
WHICH WAS TWO LANES OF TRAVEL   
IN EACH DIRECTION AND THEN THE  
AFTER CONDITION IS THE PICTURE  

01:31:21.985 --> 01:31:25.053
IN EACH DIRECTION AND THEN THE  
AFTER CONDITION IS THE PICTURE  
ON THE RIGHT WE CHOSE ONE LANE  

01:31:25.055 --> 01:31:25.754
AFTER CONDITION IS THE PICTURE  
ON THE RIGHT WE CHOSE ONE LANE  
IN EACH DIRECTION CENTER TURN   

01:31:25.756 --> 01:31:28.823
ON THE RIGHT WE CHOSE ONE LANE  
IN EACH DIRECTION CENTER TURN   
LANE AND A BUFFER BIKE LANE.    

01:31:28.825 --> 01:31:29.857
IN EACH DIRECTION CENTER TURN   
LANE AND A BUFFER BIKE LANE.    
SO THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE    

01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:30.658
LANE AND A BUFFER BIKE LANE.    
SO THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE    
OF A ROAD TAKING A FOUR TO      

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:32.593
SO THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE    
OF A ROAD TAKING A FOUR TO      
THREE WITH A BICYCLE AMENITY.   

01:31:32.595 --> 01:31:36.530
OF A ROAD TAKING A FOUR TO      
THREE WITH A BICYCLE AMENITY.   
ONE THING TO NOTE IS YOU MAY    

01:31:36.532 --> 01:31:37.132
THREE WITH A BICYCLE AMENITY.   
ONE THING TO NOTE IS YOU MAY    
NOTE THAT THE BICYCLE LANE      

01:31:37.134 --> 01:31:39.934
ONE THING TO NOTE IS YOU MAY    
NOTE THAT THE BICYCLE LANE      
PICTURED HERE IS JUST PAINT THE 

01:31:39.936 --> 01:31:40.701
NOTE THAT THE BICYCLE LANE      
PICTURED HERE IS JUST PAINT THE 
ROAD BUT SUSANNE AND SIGERSON   

01:31:40.703 --> 01:31:44.072
PICTURED HERE IS JUST PAINT THE 
ROAD BUT SUSANNE AND SIGERSON   
TAHITI ARE WORKING ON QUICK     

01:31:44.074 --> 01:31:44.939
ROAD BUT SUSANNE AND SIGERSON   
TAHITI ARE WORKING ON QUICK     
BILLS TO POINT OUT WHICH WILL   

01:31:44.941 --> 01:31:47.742
TAHITI ARE WORKING ON QUICK     
BILLS TO POINT OUT WHICH WILL   
TAKE ELEVEN MILES OF EXISTING   

01:31:47.744 --> 01:31:48.543
BILLS TO POINT OUT WHICH WILL   
TAKE ELEVEN MILES OF EXISTING   
BIKE LANES INCLUDING THIS ONE   

01:31:48.545 --> 01:31:49.343
TAKE ELEVEN MILES OF EXISTING   
BIKE LANES INCLUDING THIS ONE

CYCLE TRACKS IF YOU WILL SO YOU 
WILL HAVE VERTICAL SEPARATION   

01:31:58.621 --> 01:32:03.124
CYCLE TRACKS IF YOU WILL SO YOU 
WILL HAVE VERTICAL SEPARATION   
FOR THE MAPLE ROAD BIKE LANE    

01:32:03.126 --> 01:32:06.694
WILL HAVE VERTICAL SEPARATION   
FOR THE MAPLE ROAD BIKE LANE    
FROM MOTORISTS AND BICYCLE      

01:32:06.696 --> 01:32:11.165
FOR THE MAPLE ROAD BIKE LANE    
FROM MOTORISTS AND BICYCLE      
ANOTHER RECENT PROJECT IS       

01:32:11.167 --> 01:32:11.499
FROM MOTORISTS AND BICYCLE      
ANOTHER RECENT PROJECT IS       
S-BAHN.

IN EACH DIRECTION.              

01:32:18.875 --> 01:32:20.007
YOU HAD SURE YOU HAVE TWO LANES 
IN EACH DIRECTION.              
WE DID THE ROAD TWO YEARS AGO,  

01:32:20.009 --> 01:32:23.411
IN EACH DIRECTION.              
WE DID THE ROAD TWO YEARS AGO,  
TOOK AWAY TWO LANES CENTER TURN 

01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:24.245
WE DID THE ROAD TWO YEARS AGO,  
TOOK AWAY TWO LANES CENTER TURN

THE ONLY THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO 

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:56.104
TO PUT IN A BIKE FACILITY AND   
THE ONLY THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO 
PUT IN THAT IS TO PUT IN A      

01:38:56.106 --> 01:38:56.304
THE ONLY THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO

WE&apos;VE DONE OUR WORK IN THE

01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:03.311
PAST.                           
BUT WE KNOW WE NEED TO THINK A  
LITTLE BIT MORE HOLISTICALLY    

01:39:03.313 --> 01:39:04.312
BUT WE KNOW WE NEED TO THINK A  
LITTLE BIT MORE HOLISTICALLY

01:39:15.091 --> 01:39:16.057
YOU KNOW, TRAFFIC AND KIND      
OF CONGESTION VEHICULAR DELAYED 
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO    

01:39:16.059 --> 01:39:16.657

THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO    
REPORT TO THE COUNCIL ON

THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO

01:39:19.395 --> 01:39:20.327
REPORT TO THE COUNCIL ON        
PURSUANT TO THAT RESOLUTION.    
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS    

01:39:20.329 --> 01:39:22.530
PURSUANT TO THAT RESOLUTION.    
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS    
STILL KIND OF BAKED INTO THE    

01:39:22.532 --> 01:39:26.433
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS    
STILL KIND OF BAKED INTO THE    
PROCESS AND THEN PARKING IS     

01:39:26.435 --> 01:39:27.168
STILL KIND OF BAKED INTO THE

ANOTHER THING WHETHER THERE&apos;S   

01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:30.271

ANOTHER THING WHETHER THERE&apos;S   
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT IN ON-STREET

PARKING ONE OF THE ROAD I       
THOUGHT I DIDN&apos;T HIGHLIGHT AS   

01:39:34.477 --> 01:39:35.409
PARKING ONE OF THE ROAD I       
THOUGHT I DIDN&apos;T HIGHLIGHT AS   
IT WAS KIND OF ATYPICAL IS WE   

01:39:35.411 --> 01:39:38.746
THOUGHT I DIDN&apos;T HIGHLIGHT AS   
IT WAS KIND OF ATYPICAL IS WE   
DID HAVE A ROAD ON WOOD.        

01:39:38.748 --> 01:39:39.947
IT WAS KIND OF ATYPICAL IS WE   
DID HAVE A ROAD ON WOOD.        
WE WERE ABLE TO PUT IN A BIKE   

01:39:39.949 --> 01:39:43.016
DID HAVE A ROAD ON WOOD.        
WE WERE ABLE TO PUT IN A BIKE   
FACILITY BY REMOVING ONE OF THE 

01:39:43.018 --> 01:39:43.484
WE WERE ABLE TO PUT IN A BIKE   
FACILITY BY REMOVING ONE OF THE 
TRAVEL LANES.                   

01:39:43.486 --> 01:39:44.518
FACILITY BY REMOVING ONE OF THE 
TRAVEL LANES.                   
BUT WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO PUT IN 

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.720
TRAVEL LANES.                   
BUT WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO PUT IN 
SOME ON-STREET PARKING OVER     

01:39:46.722 --> 01:39:47.554
BUT WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO PUT IN 
SOME ON-STREET PARKING OVER     
THERE AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY BY  

01:39:47.556 --> 01:39:51.125
SOME ON-STREET PARKING OVER     
THERE AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY BY  
REMOVAL OF A CENTER TURN LANE   

01:39:51.127 --> 01:39:51.859
THERE AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY BY  
REMOVAL OF A CENTER TURN LANE   
BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT HOW MANY   

01:39:51.861 --> 01:39:54.428
REMOVAL OF A CENTER TURN LANE   
BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT HOW MANY   
PEOPLE WERE USING THAT CENTER   

01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:55.296
BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT HOW MANY   
PEOPLE WERE USING THAT CENTER   
LANE AND IT WAS VERY FEW.       

01:39:55.298 --> 01:39:58.099
PEOPLE WERE USING THAT CENTER   
LANE AND IT WAS VERY FEW.       
SO THAT WAS A KIND OF ATYPICAL  

01:39:58.101 --> 01:39:58.899
LANE AND IT WAS VERY FEW.       
SO THAT WAS A KIND OF ATYPICAL  
APPLICATION OF A ROAD DIET.     

01:39:58.901 --> 01:40:02.036
SO THAT WAS A KIND OF ATYPICAL  
APPLICATION OF A ROAD DIET.     
BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW    

01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:03.037
APPLICATION OF A ROAD DIET.     
BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW    
YOU CAN APPROACH THESE THINGS   

01:40:03.039 --> 01:40:03.771
BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW    
YOU CAN APPROACH THESE THINGS   
THROUGH DIFFERENT LENSES IN     

01:40:03.773 --> 01:40:06.007
YOU CAN APPROACH THESE THINGS   
THROUGH DIFFERENT LENSES IN     
TERMS WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE     

01:40:06.009 --> 01:40:09.476
THROUGH DIFFERENT LENSES IN

THE LAST THING I WANTED TO      

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.412
THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE AND    
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO      
MENTION IN THE SPACE IS WE DO   

01:40:11.414 --> 01:40:13.881
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO      
MENTION IN THE SPACE IS WE DO   
SOMETIMES GET CONCERNS FROM     

01:40:13.883 --> 01:40:14.582
MENTION IN THE SPACE IS WE DO   
SOMETIMES GET CONCERNS FROM     
ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD IS SOME   

01:40:14.584 --> 01:40:17.451
SOMETIMES GET CONCERNS FROM     
ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD IS SOME   
OF THE SPILLOVER TRAFFIC.       

01:40:17.453 --> 01:40:21.189
ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD IS SOME   
OF THE SPILLOVER TRAFFIC.       
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO  

01:40:21.191 --> 01:40:24.491
OF THE SPILLOVER TRAFFIC.       
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO  
KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF THAT    

01:40:24.493 --> 01:40:25.293
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO  
KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF THAT    
THERE THERE IS A WAY TO         

01:40:25.295 --> 01:40:25.760
KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF THAT    
THERE THERE IS A WAY TO         
QUANTIFY THAT.                  

01:40:25.762 --> 01:40:28.829
THERE THERE IS A WAY TO         
QUANTIFY THAT.                  
THERE IS A WAY TO STUDY THAT.   

01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:32.599
QUANTIFY THAT.                  
THERE IS A WAY TO STUDY THAT.   
BUT IT ALSO IT IT&apos;S SOMETIMES   

01:40:32.601 --> 01:40:33.368
THERE IS A WAY TO STUDY THAT.   
BUT IT ALSO IT IT&apos;S SOMETIMES   
HARD TO KNOW HOW FAR THAT       

01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:33.935
BUT IT ALSO IT IT&apos;S SOMETIMES   
HARD TO KNOW HOW FAR THAT       
SPILLOVER EFFECT IS.            

01:40:33.937 --> 01:40:37.438
HARD TO KNOW HOW FAR THAT       
SPILLOVER EFFECT IS.            
SO TO THE EXTENT WE CAN WE TRY  

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:37.805
SPILLOVER EFFECT IS.            
SO TO THE EXTENT WE CAN WE TRY  
TO ANALYZE IT.                  

01:40:37.807 --> 01:40:40.875
SO TO THE EXTENT WE CAN WE TRY  
TO ANALYZE IT.                  
WE TRY TO LOOK AT WHERE THERE&apos;S 

01:40:40.877 --> 01:40:41.809
TO ANALYZE IT.                  
WE TRY TO LOOK AT WHERE THERE&apos;S 
DATA AND IF THERE ISN&apos;T THE     

01:40:41.811 --> 01:40:45.312
WE TRY TO LOOK AT WHERE THERE&apos;S 
DATA AND IF THERE ISN&apos;T THE     
DATA MAYBE LOOK AT WHAT SOME    

01:40:45.314 --> 01:40:46.046
DATA AND IF THERE ISN&apos;T THE     
DATA MAYBE LOOK AT WHAT SOME    
OF THE USAGE PATTERNS ARE AND   

01:40:46.048 --> 01:40:47.982
DATA MAYBE LOOK AT WHAT SOME    
OF THE USAGE PATTERNS ARE AND   
MAKE SOME INFORMED DECISIONS    

01:40:47.984 --> 01:40:48.649
OF THE USAGE PATTERNS ARE AND   
MAKE SOME INFORMED DECISIONS    
ABOUT WHAT THAT SPILLOVER       

01:40:48.651 --> 01:40:51.385
MAKE SOME INFORMED DECISIONS    
ABOUT WHAT THAT SPILLOVER       
EFFECTS INTO ADJACENT           

01:40:51.387 --> 01:40:51.919
ABOUT WHAT THAT SPILLOVER       
EFFECTS INTO ADJACENT           
NEIGHBORHOODS MIGHT BE.         

01:40:51.921 --> 01:40:56.290
EFFECTS INTO ADJACENT           
NEIGHBORHOODS MIGHT BE.         
SO YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S SOMETHING     

01:40:56.292 --> 01:40:57.425
NEIGHBORHOODS MIGHT BE.         
SO YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S SOMETHING     
THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF IN TERMS 

01:40:57.427 --> 01:41:00.395
SO YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S SOMETHING     
THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF IN TERMS 
OF SOLVING ONE PROBLEM AND      

01:41:00.397 --> 01:41:01.262
THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF IN TERMS 
OF SOLVING ONE PROBLEM AND      
HOPEFULLY NOT CREATING ANOTHER. 

01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:03.697
OF SOLVING ONE PROBLEM AND      
HOPEFULLY NOT CREATING ANOTHER. 
SO ALL OF THAT KIND OF IS BAKED 

01:41:03.699 --> 01:41:04.465
HOPEFULLY NOT CREATING ANOTHER. 
SO ALL OF THAT KIND OF IS BAKED 
INTO THE ANALYSIS WHICH THEN    

01:41:04.467 --> 01:41:07.634
SO ALL OF THAT KIND OF IS BAKED 
INTO THE ANALYSIS WHICH THEN    
LEADS US TO A DECISION.         

01:41:07.636 --> 01:41:11.439
INTO THE ANALYSIS WHICH THEN    
LEADS US TO A DECISION.         
AND SO I THINK WITH THAT PRETTY 

01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:12.239
LEADS US TO A DECISION.         
AND SO I THINK WITH THAT PRETTY 
MUCH CONCLUDES THE THINGS I     

01:41:12.241 --> 01:41:12.974
AND SO I THINK WITH THAT PRETTY 
MUCH CONCLUDES THE THINGS I     
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN, I    

01:41:12.976 --> 01:41:15.376
MUCH CONCLUDES THE THINGS I     
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN, I    
KNOW THIS IS A VERY CURSORY     

01:41:15.378 --> 01:41:15.709
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN, I    
KNOW THIS IS A VERY CURSORY     
OVERVIEW.                       

01:41:15.711 --> 01:41:16.376
KNOW THIS IS A VERY CURSORY     
OVERVIEW.                       
THIS IS JUST KIND OF AN         

01:41:16.378 --> 01:41:18.579
OVERVIEW.                       
THIS IS JUST KIND OF AN         
INTRODUCTION OF THE CONCEPT SO  

01:41:18.581 --> 01:41:19.346
THIS IS JUST KIND OF AN         
INTRODUCTION OF THE CONCEPT SO  
THAT MAYBE WE&apos;RE SHARING OUR    

01:41:19.348 --> 01:41:20.047
INTRODUCTION OF THE CONCEPT SO  
THAT MAYBE WE&apos;RE SHARING OUR    
COMMON UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT 

01:41:20.049 --> 01:41:23.217
THAT MAYBE WE&apos;RE SHARING OUR    
COMMON UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT 
ROTIS ARE AND WHAT SOME         

01:41:23.219 --> 01:41:23.884
COMMON UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT 
ROTIS ARE AND WHAT SOME         
OF THOSE FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES   

01:41:23.886 --> 01:41:24.151
ROTIS ARE AND WHAT SOME         
OF THOSE FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES   
ARE.

THANK YOU.                      
DISCUSSION ON THIS MULLY I      
STILL LIKE GOING FIRST NOT NOT  

01:41:38.467 --> 01:41:39.499
DISCUSSION ON THIS MULLY I      
STILL LIKE GOING FIRST NOT NOT  
CHAIR ANYMORE SO I REALLY       

01:41:39.501 --> 01:41:43.204
STILL LIKE GOING FIRST NOT NOT  
CHAIR ANYMORE SO I REALLY       
APPRECIATED THAT YOU GAVE US A  

01:41:43.206 --> 01:41:43.971
CHAIR ANYMORE SO I REALLY       
APPRECIATED THAT YOU GAVE US A  
COMPLETE LIST OF ALL THE MULTI  

01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:45.639
APPRECIATED THAT YOU GAVE US A  
COMPLETE LIST OF ALL THE MULTI  
LANE ROADS IN THE CITY.         

01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:46.640
COMPLETE LIST OF ALL THE MULTI  
LANE ROADS IN THE CITY.         
HOW MANY OF THOSE HAVE VOLUMES? 

01:41:46.642 --> 01:41:49.377
LANE ROADS IN THE CITY.         
HOW MANY OF THOSE HAVE VOLUMES? 
OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A DAY 

01:41:49.379 --> 01:41:49.710
HOW MANY OF THOSE HAVE VOLUMES? 
OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A DAY 
.                               

01:41:49.712 --> 01:41:53.713
OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A DAY 
.                               
YOU KNOW IT&apos;S FUNNY YOU ASK     

01:41:53.715 --> 01:41:54.548
.                               
YOU KNOW IT&apos;S FUNNY YOU ASK     
THAT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO PUT 

01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:57.351
YOU KNOW IT&apos;S FUNNY YOU ASK     
THAT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO PUT 
TOGETHER A TABLE THAT SHOWED    

01:41:57.353 --> 01:41:58.351
THAT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO PUT 
TOGETHER A TABLE THAT SHOWED    
WHICH ROADS LIKE WHAT VOLUMES   

01:41:58.353 --> 01:42:01.355
TOGETHER A TABLE THAT SHOWED    
WHICH ROADS LIKE WHAT VOLUMES   
WERE ONE OF THE THINGS I WILL   

01:42:01.357 --> 01:42:02.156
WHICH ROADS LIKE WHAT VOLUMES   
WERE ONE OF THE THINGS I WILL   
SAY IS A LOT OF THE VOLUME      

01:42:02.158 --> 01:42:02.956
WERE ONE OF THE THINGS I WILL   
SAY IS A LOT OF THE VOLUME      
COUNTS THAT I HAVE ARE PRE      

01:42:02.958 --> 01:42:05.326
SAY IS A LOT OF THE VOLUME      
COUNTS THAT I HAVE ARE PRE      
PANDEMIC SO THAT DATA PROBABLY  

01:42:05.328 --> 01:42:08.695
COUNTS THAT I HAVE ARE PRE      
PANDEMIC SO THAT DATA PROBABLY  
NEEDS TO BE REFRESHED.          

01:42:08.697 --> 01:42:10.030
PANDEMIC SO THAT DATA PROBABLY  
NEEDS TO BE REFRESHED.          
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS SOME 

01:42:10.032 --> 01:42:13.066
NEEDS TO BE REFRESHED.          
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS SOME 
SEGMENTS OF RODWAY MAY HAVE     

01:42:13.068 --> 01:42:16.370
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS SOME 
SEGMENTS OF RODWAY MAY HAVE     
VEHICULAR VOLUMES THAT ARE      

01:42:16.372 --> 01:42:16.903
SEGMENTS OF RODWAY MAY HAVE     
VEHICULAR VOLUMES THAT ARE      
RELATIVELY HIGH.                

01:42:16.905 --> 01:42:17.838
VEHICULAR VOLUMES THAT ARE      
RELATIVELY HIGH.                
FOR EXAMPLE, LAST TIME I        

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:20.907
RELATIVELY HIGH.                
FOR EXAMPLE, LAST TIME I        
CHECKED PLIMOTH RIGHT NEAR THE  

01:42:20.909 --> 01:42:24.945
FOR EXAMPLE, LAST TIME I        
CHECKED PLIMOTH RIGHT NEAR THE  
FREEWAY HAD AN AVERAGE DAILY    

01:42:24.947 --> 01:42:28.648
CHECKED PLIMOTH RIGHT NEAR THE  
FREEWAY HAD AN AVERAGE DAILY    
TRAFFIC VOLUME OF CLOSE TO      

01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:29.349
FREEWAY HAD AN AVERAGE DAILY    
TRAFFIC VOLUME OF CLOSE TO      
THIRTY THOUSAND IF I&apos;M NOT      

01:42:29.351 --> 01:42:29.684
TRAFFIC VOLUME OF CLOSE TO      
THIRTY THOUSAND IF I&apos;M NOT      
MISTAKEN.                       

01:42:29.686 --> 01:42:31.952
THIRTY THOUSAND IF I&apos;M NOT      
MISTAKEN.                       
BUT AREAS TO THE WEST THAT FOR  

01:42:31.954 --> 01:42:32.886
MISTAKEN.                       
BUT AREAS TO THE WEST THAT FOR  
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GET PAST GREEN 

01:42:32.888 --> 01:42:35.922
BUT AREAS TO THE WEST THAT FOR  
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GET PAST GREEN 
DROP OFF RIGHT.                 

01:42:35.924 --> 01:42:36.924
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GET PAST GREEN 
DROP OFF RIGHT.                 
LET&apos;S GET THAT DOWN PARKWAY     

01:42:36.926 --> 01:42:37.525
DROP OFF RIGHT.                 
LET&apos;S GET THAT DOWN PARKWAY     
THEY PROBABLY DROP BELOW THE    

01:42:37.527 --> 01:42:39.926
LET&apos;S GET THAT DOWN PARKWAY     
THEY PROBABLY DROP BELOW THE    
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR MAYBE   

01:42:39.928 --> 01:42:40.594
THEY PROBABLY DROP BELOW THE    
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR MAYBE   
EVEN A TWENTY THOUSAND          

01:42:40.596 --> 01:42:41.328
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR MAYBE   
EVEN A TWENTY THOUSAND          
THRESHOLD AND WE DO SEE THAT A  

01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:43.964
EVEN A TWENTY THOUSAND          
THRESHOLD AND WE DO SEE THAT A  
LOT AROUND THE INTERSTATES,     

01:42:43.966 --> 01:42:44.699
THRESHOLD AND WE DO SEE THAT A  
LOT AROUND THE INTERSTATES,     
ESPECIALLY THE VEHICLES THAT    

01:42:44.701 --> 01:42:47.434
LOT AROUND THE INTERSTATES,     
ESPECIALLY THE VEHICLES THAT    
ARE COMING OFF THE FREEWAY      

01:42:47.436 --> 01:42:47.768
ESPECIALLY THE VEHICLES THAT    
ARE COMING OFF THE FREEWAY      
RAMP.                           

01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:50.670
ARE COMING OFF THE FREEWAY      
RAMP.                           
THEY TEND TO DISPERSE RIGHT     

01:42:50.672 --> 01:42:51.638
RAMP.                           
THEY TEND TO DISPERSE RIGHT     
AFTER THAT BUT RIGHT AROUND THE 

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:52.373
THEY TEND TO DISPERSE RIGHT     
AFTER THAT BUT RIGHT AROUND THE 
INTERCHANGES THEY TEND TO HAVE  

01:42:52.375 --> 01:42:54.708
AFTER THAT BUT RIGHT AROUND THE 
INTERCHANGES THEY TEND TO HAVE  
A LOT OF TRAFFIC.               

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:55.876
INTERCHANGES THEY TEND TO HAVE  
A LOT OF TRAFFIC.               
SO THAT&apos;S JUST THE LONG WINDED  

01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:56.610
A LOT OF TRAFFIC.               
SO THAT&apos;S JUST THE LONG WINDED  
WAY OF SAYING I DON&apos;T HAVE A    

01:42:56.612 --> 01:42:57.978
SO THAT&apos;S JUST THE LONG WINDED  
WAY OF SAYING I DON&apos;T HAVE A    
GREAT ANSWER IN TERMS OF WHICH  

01:42:57.980 --> 01:42:58.846
WAY OF SAYING I DON&apos;T HAVE A    
GREAT ANSWER IN TERMS OF WHICH  
OF THESE ROADS ARE I KNOW THERE 

01:42:58.848 --> 01:42:59.713
GREAT ANSWER IN TERMS OF WHICH  
OF THESE ROADS ARE I KNOW THERE 
ARE SOME THAT ARE WELL THAT     

01:42:59.715 --> 01:43:02.116
OF THESE ROADS ARE I KNOW THERE 
ARE SOME THAT ARE WELL THAT     
DEFINITELY ARE UNDER THAT       

01:43:02.118 --> 01:43:02.850
ARE SOME THAT ARE WELL THAT     
DEFINITELY ARE UNDER THAT       
PRESSURE FROM PARKWAY, FOR      

01:43:02.852 --> 01:43:03.117
DEFINITELY ARE UNDER THAT       
PRESSURE FROM PARKWAY, FOR      
EXAMPLE.                        

01:43:03.119 --> 01:43:05.919
PRESSURE FROM PARKWAY, FOR      
EXAMPLE.                        
BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT FOR   

01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:06.854
EXAMPLE.                        
BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT FOR   
EXAMPLE, FULLER IN FRONT OF THE 

01:43:06.856 --> 01:43:07.721
BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT FOR   
EXAMPLE, FULLER IN FRONT OF THE 
HOSPITAL, IT IS PROBABLY A      

01:43:07.723 --> 01:43:10.191
EXAMPLE, FULLER IN FRONT OF THE 
HOSPITAL, IT IS PROBABLY A      
LITTLE HIGHER THAN OTHER        

01:43:10.193 --> 01:43:10.590
HOSPITAL, IT IS PROBABLY A      
LITTLE HIGHER THAN OTHER        
PLACES.                         

01:43:10.592 --> 01:43:11.458
LITTLE HIGHER THAN OTHER        
PLACES.                         
SO LONG STORY SHORT, IT IS      

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:14.227
PLACES.                         
SO LONG STORY SHORT, IT IS      
SOMETHING WE PROBABLY HAVE TO   

01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:15.029
SO LONG STORY SHORT, IT IS      
SOMETHING WE PROBABLY HAVE TO   
GO OUT, MAKE SURE WE HAVE MORE  

01:43:15.031 --> 01:43:15.763
SOMETHING WE PROBABLY HAVE TO   
GO OUT, MAKE SURE WE HAVE MORE  
RECENT COUNTS TO REALLY         

01:43:15.765 --> 01:43:18.099
GO OUT, MAKE SURE WE HAVE MORE  
RECENT COUNTS TO REALLY         
UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF HOW   

01:43:18.101 --> 01:43:18.966
RECENT COUNTS TO REALLY         
UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF HOW   
MANY VEHICLES ARE USING THE     

01:43:18.968 --> 01:43:21.569
UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF HOW   
MANY VEHICLES ARE USING THE     
SCORES.                         

01:43:21.571 --> 01:43:22.570
MANY VEHICLES ARE USING THE

EITHER FORM.                    

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:32.072
EXECUTED SO I THINK IT CAN TAKE 
EITHER FORM.                    
ONE OF THE THINGS I WILL SAY    

01:44:32.074 --> 01:44:32.773
EITHER FORM.

EARLIER I THINK SOME OF THESE   
CORRIDORS WILL BE A LITTLE BIT  

01:44:36.312 --> 01:44:38.745
EARLIER I THINK SOME OF THESE   
CORRIDORS WILL BE A LITTLE BIT  
EASIER OR CONSIDERATION THAN    

01:44:38.747 --> 01:44:39.146
CORRIDORS WILL BE A LITTLE BIT  
EASIER OR CONSIDERATION THAN    
OTHERS.                         

01:44:39.148 --> 01:44:40.080
EASIER OR CONSIDERATION THAN    
OTHERS.                         
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I    

01:44:40.082 --> 01:44:40.914
OTHERS.

THEY DO HAVE SOME SOME PLANS    

01:44:50.826 --> 01:44:54.661
WITH OUR FRIENDS AT THE RAIJA.  
THEY DO HAVE SOME SOME PLANS    
FOR HIGHER ORDER TRANSIT        

01:44:54.663 --> 01:44:55.329
THEY DO HAVE SOME SOME PLANS    
FOR HIGHER ORDER TRANSIT        
WHETHER THAT&apos;S EXPRESS ROUTES   

01:44:55.331 --> 01:44:57.864
FOR HIGHER ORDER TRANSIT        
WHETHER THAT&apos;S EXPRESS ROUTES

01:44:59.068 --> 01:45:02.402
.                               
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ROADS 
LIKE PLYMOUTH IS A GOOD EXAMPLE 

01:45:02.404 --> 01:45:03.403
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ROADS 
LIKE PLYMOUTH IS A GOOD EXAMPLE 
I THINK IS ONE OF THE CORRIDORS 

01:45:03.405 --> 01:45:06.040
LIKE PLYMOUTH IS A GOOD EXAMPLE 
I THINK IS ONE OF THE CORRIDORS 
YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION IS       

01:45:06.042 --> 01:45:09.243
I THINK IS ONE OF THE CORRIDORS 
YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION IS       
SHOULD SHOULD WE GO OUT AND     

01:45:09.245 --> 01:45:10.244
YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION IS       
SHOULD SHOULD WE GO OUT AND     
ROAD DIED NOW IF THERE IS A     

01:45:10.246 --> 01:45:13.447
SHOULD SHOULD WE GO OUT AND     
ROAD DIED NOW IF THERE IS A     
PLAN FOR TRANSIT TO COME BACK   

01:45:13.449 --> 01:45:17.617
ROAD DIED NOW IF THERE IS A     
PLAN FOR TRANSIT TO COME BACK   
AND RECLAIM SOME OF THAT SPACE  

01:45:17.619 --> 01:45:18.518
PLAN FOR TRANSIT TO COME BACK   
AND RECLAIM SOME OF THAT SPACE  
OR DEDICATED TRANSIT LANES IF   

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:19.586
AND RECLAIM SOME OF THAT SPACE  
OR DEDICATED TRANSIT LANES IF   
WE EVER WANT TO DO A TRUE BUS   

01:45:19.588 --> 01:45:21.188
OR DEDICATED TRANSIT LANES IF   
WE EVER WANT TO DO A TRUE BUS   
RAPID TRANSIT.                  

01:45:21.190 --> 01:45:22.489
WE EVER WANT TO DO A TRUE BUS   
RAPID TRANSIT.                  
AND SO I JUST SAY ALL THAT TO   

01:45:22.491 --> 01:45:25.692
RAPID TRANSIT.                  
AND SO I JUST SAY ALL THAT TO

QUICKLY THROUGH THOSE ZONES.    
SO THE OTHER THE OTHER APPROACH 
THAT WE&apos;VE BEEN TRYING NOW ON

SO THE OTHER THE OTHER APPROACH 
THAT WE&apos;VE BEEN TRYING NOW ON   
STATE STREET IS TO BASICALLY    

01:52:44.032 --> 01:52:47.433
THAT WE&apos;VE BEEN TRYING NOW ON   
STATE STREET IS TO BASICALLY    
HAVE THE BUSSES PULL UP TO THE  

01:52:47.435 --> 01:52:48.068
STATE STREET IS TO BASICALLY    
HAVE THE BUSSES PULL UP TO THE

CURB AND GO THERE.              
WELL, WE&apos;RE NOW RUNNING INTO    
PROBLEMS WITH WHERE THE         

01:52:51.774 --> 01:52:52.605
WELL, WE&apos;RE NOW RUNNING INTO    
PROBLEMS WITH WHERE THE         
DELINEATOR ARE AT AND HOW

DELINEATOR ARE AT AND HOW       
COMFORTABLE DRIVERS ARE WITH    
THE LANE WIDTH AND ARE THE      

01:52:56.578 --> 01:52:59.813
COMFORTABLE DRIVERS ARE WITH    
THE LANE WIDTH AND ARE THE      
DRIVERS COMFORTABLE GOING INTO

WE DON&apos;T WANT TO GO FORWARD     
WITH THIS STUFF MOVING FORWARD. 
BUT I THINK AS WE MOVE INTO     

01:53:12.494 --> 01:53:13.093
WITH THIS STUFF MOVING FORWARD. 
BUT I THINK AS WE MOVE INTO     
THESE MAJOR CORRIDORS           

01:53:13.095 --> 01:53:15.829
BUT I THINK AS WE MOVE INTO     
THESE MAJOR CORRIDORS           
ESPECIALLY IF WE&apos;RE TALKING

BRINGING THIS UP.               
&gt;&gt; WE ARE FINDING RES           
CROSSWALKS IN THE INTERSECTION  

02:09:59.967 --> 02:10:00.732
&gt;&gt; WE ARE FINDING RES           
CROSSWALKS IN THE INTERSECTION  
CAN POSE SOME DIFFICULTIES IN   

02:10:00.734 --> 02:10:01.467
CROSSWALKS IN THE INTERSECTION  
CAN POSE SOME DIFFICULTIES IN   
IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDING UPON   

02:10:01.469 --> 02:10:02.133
CAN POSE SOME DIFFICULTIES IN   
IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDING UPON   
WHAT THE EXISTING ROAD          

02:10:02.135 --> 02:10:02.768
IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDING UPON   
WHAT THE EXISTING ROAD          
CHARACTERISTIC IS, ESPECIALLY   

02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:03.435
WHAT THE EXISTING ROAD          
CHARACTERISTIC IS, ESPECIALLY   
THE GEOMETRIES OF A ROADWAY.    

02:10:03.437 --> 02:10:04.169
CHARACTERISTIC IS, ESPECIALLY   
THE GEOMETRIES OF A ROADWAY.    
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FEEL       

02:10:04.171 --> 02:10:04.703
THE GEOMETRIES OF A ROADWAY.    
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FEEL       
PRETTY ADAMANT ABOUT            

02:10:04.705 --> 02:10:08.507
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FEEL       
PRETTY ADAMANT ABOUT            
MAINTAINING OR FOCUSING ON IS   

02:10:08.509 --> 02:10:09.241
PRETTY ADAMANT ABOUT            
MAINTAINING OR FOCUSING ON IS   
ADA COMPLIANCE MAKING SURE THAT 

02:10:09.243 --> 02:10:12.345
MAINTAINING OR FOCUSING ON IS   
ADA COMPLIANCE MAKING SURE THAT 
THE CROSSWALK CATCHES ALL THE   

02:10:12.347 --> 02:10:13.011
ADA COMPLIANCE MAKING SURE THAT 
THE CROSSWALK CATCHES ALL THE   
SLOPES AND CROSS FLOWS.         

02:10:13.013 --> 02:10:15.814
THE CROSSWALK CATCHES ALL THE   
SLOPES AND CROSS FLOWS.         
SO THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST     

02:10:15.816 --> 02:10:16.415
SLOPES AND CROSS FLOWS.         
SO THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST     
DEFINING DOMESTIQUES EVEN       

02:10:16.417 --> 02:10:19.752
SO THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST     
DEFINING DOMESTIQUES EVEN       
BEFORE WE DEFINE WHAT THE SPEED 

02:10:19.754 --> 02:10:20.853
DEFINING DOMESTIQUES EVEN       
BEFORE WE DEFINE WHAT THE SPEED 
SHOULD LOOK AND FEEL LIKE, WE   

02:10:20.855 --> 02:10:21.653
BEFORE WE DEFINE WHAT THE SPEED 
SHOULD LOOK AND FEEL LIKE, WE   
REALLY NEED TO IDENTIFY WITH    

02:10:21.655 --> 02:10:23.122
SHOULD LOOK AND FEEL LIKE, WE   
REALLY NEED TO IDENTIFY WITH    
THAT CROSSWALK EXPERIENCE       

02:10:23.124 --> 02:10:27.125
REALLY NEED TO IDENTIFY WITH    
THAT CROSSWALK EXPERIENCE       
SHOULD BE LIGHT AND THEN ONE    

02:10:27.127 --> 02:10:27.726
THAT CROSSWALK EXPERIENCE       
SHOULD BE LIGHT AND THEN ONE    
OF THE THINGS THAT&apos;S            

02:10:27.728 --> 02:10:28.593
SHOULD BE LIGHT AND THEN ONE    
OF THE THINGS THAT&apos;S            
INTERESTING IS THE SAP WHO WAS  

02:10:28.595 --> 02:10:31.430
OF THE THINGS THAT&apos;S            
INTERESTING IS THE SAP WHO WAS  
OUT THERE DURING CONSTRUCTION   

02:10:31.432 --> 02:10:32.031
INTERESTING IS THE SAP WHO WAS  
OUT THERE DURING CONSTRUCTION   
EXPLAINED TO ME GRANGER         

02:10:32.033 --> 02:10:34.900
OUT THERE DURING CONSTRUCTION   
EXPLAINED TO ME GRANGER         
ACTUALLY CHANGES A LITTLE BIT   

02:10:34.902 --> 02:10:35.534
EXPLAINED TO ME GRANGER         
ACTUALLY CHANGES A LITTLE BIT   
IN THE SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN   

02:10:35.536 --> 02:10:38.303
ACTUALLY CHANGES A LITTLE BIT   
IN THE SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN   
FORCE AND OLIVIA.               

02:10:38.305 --> 02:10:39.071
IN THE SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN   
FORCE AND OLIVIA.               
THERE ARE SO THE EXPERIENCE     

02:10:39.073 --> 02:10:42.307
FORCE AND OLIVIA.               
THERE ARE SO THE EXPERIENCE     
OVER ONCE BE VERY DIFFERENT     

02:10:42.309 --> 02:10:43.041
THERE ARE SO THE EXPERIENCE     
OVER ONCE BE VERY DIFFERENT     
THAN THE EXPERIENCE FROM THE    

02:10:43.043 --> 02:10:43.742
OVER ONCE BE VERY DIFFERENT     
THAN THE EXPERIENCE FROM THE    
OTHER AND IT&apos;S EVEN DIFFERENT   

02:10:43.744 --> 02:10:45.911
THAN THE EXPERIENCE FROM THE    
OTHER AND IT&apos;S EVEN DIFFERENT   
DEPENDING ON THE APPROACH       

02:10:45.913 --> 02:10:46.912
OTHER AND IT&apos;S EVEN DIFFERENT   
DEPENDING ON THE APPROACH       
BECAUSE THE ROAD KIND OF SLOPES 

02:10:46.914 --> 02:10:50.449
DEPENDING ON THE APPROACH       
BECAUSE THE ROAD KIND OF SLOPES 
UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE THE S IS 

02:10:50.451 --> 02:10:51.250
BECAUSE THE ROAD KIND OF SLOPES 
UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE THE S IS 
I THINK A LITTLE BIT HIGHER     

02:10:51.252 --> 02:10:53.085
UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE THE S IS 
I THINK A LITTLE BIT HIGHER     
THAN THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ROAD 

02:10:53.087 --> 02:10:54.086
I THINK A LITTLE BIT HIGHER     
THAN THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ROAD 
AND SO TRYING TO MEET THOSE     

02:10:54.088 --> 02:10:57.389
THAN THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ROAD 
AND SO TRYING TO MEET THOSE     
GRADIENTS ESPECIALLY FOR THAT   

02:10:57.391 --> 02:10:57.956
AND SO TRYING TO MEET THOSE     
GRADIENTS ESPECIALLY FOR THAT   
ADA COMPLIANCE PROVED           

02:10:57.958 --> 02:10:58.357
GRADIENTS ESPECIALLY FOR THAT   
ADA COMPLIANCE PROVED           
CHALLENGING.

ADA COMPLIANCE PROVED           
CHALLENGING.                    
SO THEY DID THE BEST THAT THEY  

02:11:01.696 --> 02:11:02.495
CHALLENGING.                    
SO THEY DID THE BEST THAT THEY  
COULD TO KIND OF CREATE SOME    

02:11:02.497 --> 02:11:03.228

COULD TO KIND OF CREATE SOME    
LIFTS AND SOME OTHER THINGS     

02:11:03.230 --> 02:11:05.231
COULD TO KIND OF CREATE SOME    
LIFTS AND SOME OTHER THINGS     
THAT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT.     

02:11:05.233 --> 02:11:08.834
LIFTS AND SOME OTHER THINGS     
THAT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT.     
I HAVE HEARD SAME CONCERNS FROM 

02:11:08.836 --> 02:11:09.668
THAT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT.     
I HAVE HEARD SAME CONCERNS FROM 
RESIDENTS AND OTHERS THAT IT    

02:11:09.670 --> 02:11:10.336
I HAVE HEARD SAME CONCERNS FROM 
RESIDENTS AND OTHERS THAT IT    
DOESN&apos;T SEEM TO BE ACHIEVING    

02:11:10.338 --> 02:11:12.938
