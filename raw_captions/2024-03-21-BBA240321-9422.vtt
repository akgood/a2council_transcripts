SLAB FOUNDATION ALL THE WAY TO  

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.925
DOESN&apos;T GO FROM FULL STRUCTURE  
SLAB FOUNDATION ALL THE WAY TO  
ROOF BUT IT HAS VERY MUCH THAT  

00:07:13.927 --> 00:07:14.926
SLAB FOUNDATION ALL THE WAY TO  
ROOF BUT IT HAS VERY MUCH THAT  
SIDE BY SIDE IN NATURE IT DOES  

00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:18.162
ROOF BUT IT HAS VERY MUCH THAT  
SIDE BY SIDE IN NATURE IT DOES  
SIT ATOP A SHARED BASEMENT THAT 

00:07:18.164 --> 00:07:18.997
SIDE BY SIDE IN NATURE IT DOES  
SIT ATOP A SHARED BASEMENT THAT 
IS IS SUBDIVIDED AND SHARED BY  

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.465
SIT ATOP A SHARED BASEMENT THAT 
IS IS SUBDIVIDED AND SHARED BY  
TWO UNITS.                      

00:07:21.467 --> 00:07:22.233
IS IS SUBDIVIDED AND SHARED BY  
TWO UNITS.                      
THERE&apos;S A FIRE MASONRY FIREWALL 

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:23.033
TWO UNITS.                      
THERE&apos;S A FIRE MASONRY FIREWALL 
THAT&apos;S IN BETWEEN AND THERE WAS 

00:07:23.035 --> 00:07:25.603
THERE&apos;S A FIRE MASONRY FIREWALL 
THAT&apos;S IN BETWEEN AND THERE WAS 
ONE TIME I BELIEVE A DOOR THAT  

00:07:25.605 --> 00:07:26.370
THAT&apos;S IN BETWEEN AND THERE WAS 
ONE TIME I BELIEVE A DOOR THAT  
WAS FULLY CLOSING THAT WAS ALSO 

00:07:26.372 --> 00:07:26.704
ONE TIME I BELIEVE A DOOR THAT  
WAS FULLY CLOSING THAT WAS ALSO 
RATED.                          

00:07:26.706 --> 00:07:29.774
WAS FULLY CLOSING THAT WAS ALSO 
RATED.                          
SO IT REALLY BRINGS IT BACK     

00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:32.744
RATED.                          
SO IT REALLY BRINGS IT BACK     
DOWN TO MORE OF A TWO ALMOST A  

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:33.545
SO IT REALLY BRINGS IT BACK     
DOWN TO MORE OF A TWO ALMOST A

DOOR IS MISSING.                
IT&apos;S OPEN TO FOUR.

00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:55.099
IT&apos;S OPEN TO FOUR.              
BUT WE&apos;RE REALLY WE ARE MAKING  
THIS A MUCH SAFER CONDITION BY  

00:12:55.101 --> 00:12:55.800
BUT WE&apos;RE REALLY WE ARE MAKING  
THIS A MUCH SAFER CONDITION BY  
INSTALLING THE DEMISE IN WALLS  

00:12:55.802 --> 00:12:56.567
THIS A MUCH SAFER CONDITION BY  
INSTALLING THE DEMISE IN WALLS  
BETWEEN THE UNITS THAT WE&apos;RE    

00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:59.570
INSTALLING THE DEMISE IN WALLS

FURNACES ARE GOING TO BE        
LOCATED AND RATED ENCLOSURES.   
SO WE&apos;RE ACTUALLY MAKING ANY    

00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:14.952
LOCATED AND RATED ENCLOSURES.   
SO WE&apos;RE ACTUALLY MAKING ANY

THERE IS NONE AND I&apos;LL JUST

SURE IT&apos;S MAINTAINED IN THE

I THINK WITH THAT NOW I THINK   

00:13:41.914 --> 00:13:42.814
UNITS THEMSELVES.               
I THINK WITH THAT NOW I THINK   
I&apos;VE SAID OK WHEN WE SAY THANK

YOU FOR SUMMARY THEY&apos;RE VERY    

00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:05.069
                            ,   
VERY GOOD.                      
CAN I JUST ADD A COUPLE         

00:14:05.071 --> 00:14:05.403
VERY GOOD.                      
CAN I JUST ADD A COUPLE         
OF THINGS?                      

00:14:05.405 --> 00:14:06.270
CAN I JUST ADD A COUPLE         
OF THINGS?                      
I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT    

00:14:06.272 --> 00:14:07.505
OF THINGS?                      
I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT    
THE BETTER EQUIVALENT OR BETTER 

00:14:07.507 --> 00:14:08.972
I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT    
THE BETTER EQUIVALENT OR BETTER 
THAN CODE IT&apos;S NOT LOOKING AT   

00:14:08.974 --> 00:14:09.774
THE BETTER EQUIVALENT OR BETTER 
THAN CODE IT&apos;S NOT LOOKING AT   
IT IS WHAT IT IS RIGHT.         

00:14:09.776 --> 00:14:10.842
THAN CODE IT&apos;S NOT LOOKING AT   
IT IS WHAT IT IS RIGHT.         
IT&apos;S LOOKING AT IT AS WHAT THE  

00:14:10.844 --> 00:14:11.642
IT IS WHAT IT IS RIGHT.         
IT&apos;S LOOKING AT IT AS WHAT THE  
CODE REQUIREMENTS ARE AND THAT  

00:14:11.644 --> 00:14:12.376
IT&apos;S LOOKING AT IT AS WHAT THE  
CODE REQUIREMENTS ARE AND THAT  
THEY&apos;RE PRESENTING SOMETHING    

00:14:12.378 --> 00:14:12.643
CODE REQUIREMENTS ARE AND THAT  
THEY&apos;RE PRESENTING SOMETHING    
EQUALLY.                        

00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:13.310
THEY&apos;RE PRESENTING SOMETHING    
EQUALLY.                        
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS        

00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:14.045
EQUALLY.                        
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS        
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM OR SPRINKLER 

00:14:14.047 --> 00:14:14.845
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS        
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM OR SPRINKLER 
SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED   

00:14:14.847 --> 00:14:15.713
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM OR SPRINKLER 
SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED   
IN THAT AREA NOT THE WHOLE      

00:14:15.715 --> 00:14:16.480
SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED   
IN THAT AREA NOT THE WHOLE      
BUILDING BUT THE AREA THAT&apos;S    

00:14:16.482 --> 00:14:19.216
IN THAT AREA NOT THE WHOLE      
BUILDING BUT THE AREA THAT&apos;S    
BEING REMODELED OR IN THE AREA  

00:14:19.218 --> 00:14:22.686
BUILDING BUT THE AREA THAT&apos;S    
BEING REMODELED OR IN THE AREA  
WITH THE CHANGE OF USE.         

00:14:22.688 --> 00:14:23.755
BEING REMODELED OR IN THE AREA  
WITH THE CHANGE OF USE.         
I JUST WANTED TO ADVOCATE FOR   

00:14:23.757 --> 00:14:27.091
WITH THE CHANGE OF USE.         
I JUST WANTED TO ADVOCATE FOR   
THAT AND REALIZE THAT&apos;S A BIG   

00:14:27.093 --> 00:14:30.094
I JUST WANTED TO ADVOCATE FOR   
THAT AND REALIZE THAT&apos;S A BIG   
AND YEAH, BECAUSE WE DIDN&apos;T     

00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:31.162
THAT AND REALIZE THAT&apos;S A BIG   
AND YEAH, BECAUSE WE DIDN&apos;T     
DIDN&apos;T COME OUT IN THE PACKET.  

00:14:31.164 --> 00:14:31.996
AND YEAH, BECAUSE WE DIDN&apos;T     
DIDN&apos;T COME OUT IN THE PACKET.  
YEAH IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S LOADED   

00:14:31.998 --> 00:14:34.532
DIDN&apos;T COME OUT IN THE PACKET.  
YEAH IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S LOADED   
IN THE VERY BEGINNING IT&apos;S      

00:14:34.534 --> 00:14:35.332
YEAH IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S LOADED   
IN THE VERY BEGINNING IT&apos;S      
MENTIONED BRIEFLY BUT YES THAT  

00:14:35.334 --> 00:14:37.335
IN THE VERY BEGINNING IT&apos;S      
MENTIONED BRIEFLY BUT YES THAT  
IS THAT IS THE MAIN REASON FOR  

00:14:37.337 --> 00:14:38.269
MENTIONED BRIEFLY BUT YES THAT  
IS THAT IS THE MAIN REASON FOR  
STATE THAT THE CHANGE OF FUZE   

00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:41.739
IS THAT IS THE MAIN REASON FOR  
STATE THAT THE CHANGE OF FUZE   
TRIGGERS THE REQUIREMENT FOR A  

00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:42.473
STATE THAT THE CHANGE OF FUZE   
TRIGGERS THE REQUIREMENT FOR A  
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM WHICH WE     

00:14:42.475 --> 00:14:45.677
TRIGGERS THE REQUIREMENT FOR A  
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM WHICH WE     
FEEL IS QUITE AN UNDERTAKING TO 

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:49.580
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM WHICH WE     
FEEL IS QUITE AN UNDERTAKING TO 
ADD EIGHT BEDROOMS.             

00:14:49.582 --> 00:14:50.515
FEEL IS QUITE AN UNDERTAKING TO 
ADD EIGHT BEDROOMS.             
THIS COULD BE A PRESIDENTIAL    

00:14:50.517 --> 00:14:51.182
ADD EIGHT BEDROOMS.             
THIS COULD BE A PRESIDENTIAL    
LEVEL OUR THIRTEEN SYSTEM OR    

00:14:51.184 --> 00:14:54.051
THIS COULD BE A PRESIDENTIAL    
LEVEL OUR THIRTEEN SYSTEM OR    
BROKEN SYSTEM TRIGGER FOR THIS  

00:14:54.053 --> 00:14:54.451
LEVEL OUR THIRTEEN SYSTEM OR    
BROKEN SYSTEM TRIGGER FOR THIS  
KIND OF USE.                    

00:14:54.453 --> 00:14:55.419
BROKEN SYSTEM TRIGGER FOR THIS  
KIND OF USE.                    
I BELIEVE WE WOULD BE IN OUR    

00:14:55.421 --> 00:14:58.055
KIND OF USE.                    
I BELIEVE WE WOULD BE IN OUR    
THIRTEEN FROM WHAT WE WOULD BE  

00:14:58.057 --> 00:14:58.389
I BELIEVE WE WOULD BE IN OUR    
THIRTEEN FROM WHAT WE WOULD BE  
AFTER.                          

00:14:58.391 --> 00:14:59.056
THIRTEEN FROM WHAT WE WOULD BE  
AFTER.                          
I MEAN THERE WAS THE MORE       

00:14:59.058 --> 00:15:00.692
AFTER.                          
I MEAN THERE WAS THE MORE       
AFFORDABLE SYSTEMS VERSUS THE   

00:15:00.694 --> 00:15:01.893
I MEAN THERE WAS THE MORE       
AFFORDABLE SYSTEMS VERSUS THE   
YES IT WOULDN&apos;T BE A FORM       

00:15:01.895 --> 00:15:04.895
AFFORDABLE SYSTEMS VERSUS THE   
YES IT WOULDN&apos;T BE A FORM       
OF A13 SYSTEM OF ENERGY OR      

00:15:04.897 --> 00:15:05.830
YES IT WOULDN&apos;T BE A FORM       
OF A13 SYSTEM OF ENERGY OR      
WHATEVER A 13 HOUR SYSTEM WHICH 

00:15:05.832 --> 00:15:06.364
OF A13 SYSTEM OF ENERGY OR      
WHATEVER A 13 HOUR SYSTEM WHICH 
IS RESIDENTIALLY OK.            

00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:06.764
WHATEVER A 13 HOUR SYSTEM WHICH 
IS RESIDENTIALLY OK.            
ALL RIGHT.                      

00:15:06.766 --> 00:15:09.233
IS RESIDENTIALLY OK.            
ALL RIGHT.                      
AND I BELIEVE WE ARE LOOKING    

00:15:09.235 --> 00:15:10.033
ALL RIGHT.                      
AND I BELIEVE WE ARE LOOKING    
INTO WHAT THAT THAT COULD       

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:12.669
AND I BELIEVE WE ARE LOOKING    
INTO WHAT THAT THAT COULD       
ENTAIL.                         

00:15:12.671 --> 00:15:13.671
INTO WHAT THAT THAT COULD       
ENTAIL.                         
BUT THERE&apos;S STILL YOU KNOW, WE  

00:15:13.673 --> 00:15:14.472
ENTAIL.                         
BUT THERE&apos;S STILL YOU KNOW, WE  
NEED TO LOOK AT THE INCOMING    

00:15:14.474 --> 00:15:15.073
BUT THERE&apos;S STILL YOU KNOW, WE  
NEED TO LOOK AT THE INCOMING    
SERVICES IF THERE&apos;S EVEN AN     

00:15:15.075 --> 00:15:16.707
NEED TO LOOK AT THE INCOMING    
SERVICES IF THERE&apos;S EVEN AN     
EXISTING HAPPENED.              

00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:17.608
SERVICES IF THERE&apos;S EVEN AN     
EXISTING HAPPENED.              
IF THAT WAS SO IT COULD BE      

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:22.279
EXISTING HAPPENED.              
IF THAT WAS SO IT COULD BE      
QUITE AN EXTENSIVE UNDERTAKING  

00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:23.314
IF THAT WAS SO IT COULD BE      
QUITE AN EXTENSIVE UNDERTAKING  
PER YOUR PICK OF THE INTENT IS  

00:15:23.316 --> 00:15:25.849
QUITE AN EXTENSIVE UNDERTAKING  
PER YOUR PICK OF THE INTENT IS  
TO MAKE THOSE B BEDROOMS THE    

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:26.383
PER YOUR PICK OF THE INTENT IS  
TO MAKE THOSE B BEDROOMS THE    
BASEMENT, CORRECT?              

00:15:26.385 --> 00:15:26.851
TO MAKE THOSE B BEDROOMS THE    
BASEMENT, CORRECT?              
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.                     

00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:27.785
BASEMENT, CORRECT?              
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.                     
SO THERE&apos;D BE TWO BEDROOMS AND  

00:15:27.787 --> 00:15:29.853
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.                     
SO THERE&apos;D BE TWO BEDROOMS AND  
MEET WITH UNITS.                

00:15:29.855 --> 00:15:30.955
SO THERE&apos;D BE TWO BEDROOMS AND  
MEET WITH UNITS.                
WE&apos;D BE ADDING TWO BEDROOMS TO  

00:15:30.957 --> 00:15:33.557
MEET WITH UNITS.                
WE&apos;D BE ADDING TWO BEDROOMS TO  
THE EXISTING EACH EXISTING UNIT 

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.425
WE&apos;D BE ADDING TWO BEDROOMS TO  
THE EXISTING EACH EXISTING UNIT 
ALONG WITH FURNACES WOULDN&apos;T BE 

00:15:34.427 --> 00:15:37.895
THE EXISTING EACH EXISTING UNIT 
ALONG WITH FURNACES WOULDN&apos;T BE 
MAINTAINED WITHIN UNIT IN THE   

00:15:37.897 --> 00:15:38.696
ALONG WITH FURNACES WOULDN&apos;T BE 
MAINTAINED WITHIN UNIT IN THE   
BASEMENT AND A RATED CLOSET AND 

00:15:38.698 --> 00:15:39.497
MAINTAINED WITHIN UNIT IN THE   
BASEMENT AND A RATED CLOSET AND 
THEN THERE WOULD BE A WASHER    

00:15:39.499 --> 00:15:44.501
BASEMENT AND A RATED CLOSET AND 
THEN THERE WOULD BE A WASHER    
DRYER IN EACH UNIT AS ONE AND   

00:15:44.503 --> 00:15:45.603
THEN THERE WOULD BE A WASHER    
DRYER IN EACH UNIT AS ONE AND   
YOU&apos;RE HAVING TO PUT IN MEANS   

00:15:45.605 --> 00:15:48.606
DRYER IN EACH UNIT AS ONE AND   
YOU&apos;RE HAVING TO PUT IN MEANS   
OF EGRESS.                      

00:15:48.608 --> 00:15:49.640
YOU&apos;RE HAVING TO PUT IN MEANS   
OF EGRESS.                      
EACH BEDROOM HAS A MEANS        

00:15:49.642 --> 00:15:53.111
OF EGRESS.                      
EACH BEDROOM HAS A MEANS        
OF EGRESS SO WILL BE AN EGRESS  

00:15:53.113 --> 00:15:53.844
EACH BEDROOM HAS A MEANS        
OF EGRESS SO WILL BE AN EGRESS  
WINDOW IN HIS BEDROOM LOCATED   

00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:54.578
OF EGRESS SO WILL BE AN EGRESS  
WINDOW IN HIS BEDROOM LOCATED   
WHICH THERE&apos;S CURRENTLY ONLY    

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.048
WINDOW IN HIS BEDROOM LOCATED   
WHICH THERE&apos;S CURRENTLY ONLY    
MEANS CURRENTLY FROM THE THE    

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.551
WHICH THERE&apos;S CURRENTLY ONLY    
MEANS CURRENTLY FROM THE THE    
BASEMENT IS BACK UP THROUGH THE 

00:16:00.553 --> 00:16:01.552
MEANS CURRENTLY FROM THE THE    
BASEMENT IS BACK UP THROUGH THE 
STAIR AND I THINK ONE THERE&apos;S   

00:16:01.554 --> 00:16:04.155
BASEMENT IS BACK UP THROUGH THE 
STAIR AND I THINK ONE THERE&apos;S   
ONE EXTERIOR THERE WITHIN ON    

00:16:04.157 --> 00:16:07.625
STAIR AND I THINK ONE THERE&apos;S   
ONE EXTERIOR THERE WITHIN ON    
THE IN THE BASEMENT ITSELF SO   

00:16:07.627 --> 00:16:11.529
ONE EXTERIOR THERE WITHIN ON    
THE IN THE BASEMENT ITSELF SO   
CURRENT SO WHEN THE NEW SCHEME  

00:16:11.531 --> 00:16:12.263
THE IN THE BASEMENT ITSELF SO   
CURRENT SO WHEN THE NEW SCHEME  
ANY INDIVIDUAL UNIT WITHIN THE

&gt;&gt; SO IT DOES HAVE A THIRD      
STORY BUT THE CEILINGS ARE      
PRETTY LOW SO THERE ARE I THINK

YEAH YEAH THAT IS CONSIDERED    
TWO AND A HALF STOREY SO A      
LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT MORE    

00:16:49.102 --> 00:16:49.967
TWO AND A HALF STOREY SO A      
LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT MORE    
INFORMATION SEEMS TO BE COMING  

00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:52.970
LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT MORE    
INFORMATION SEEMS TO BE COMING  
OUT WITH EACH RIGHT.            

00:16:52.972 --> 00:16:56.474

OUT WITH EACH RIGHT.            
SO WHAT THE TOP THREE TOP FLOOR 

00:16:56.476 --> 00:16:57.075
OUT WITH EACH RIGHT.            
SO WHAT THE TOP THREE TOP FLOOR 
REGARDLESS OF THE CEILING       

00:16:57.077 --> 00:17:00.677
SO WHAT THE TOP THREE TOP FLOOR 
REGARDLESS OF THE CEILING       
HEIGHT IT IS BEING USED AS A

AND I THINK THAT THAT&apos;S         
SOMETHING THAT THE OUR SCOPE    

00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:07.751
AND I THINK THAT THAT&apos;S         
SOMETHING THAT THE OUR SCOPE    
OF WORK REALLY ONLY ENTAILS THE 

00:17:07.753 --> 00:17:13.658
SOMETHING THAT THE OUR SCOPE    
OF WORK REALLY ONLY ENTAILS THE 
BASEMENT                        

00:17:18.597 --> 00:17:26.937
         AND YOU KNOW THAT IN

OF TIMES WHERE I THINK THERE&apos;S  
HABITABLE SPACE UP THERE BUT    

00:17:31.077 --> 00:17:31.876
OF TIMES WHERE I THINK THERE&apos;S  
HABITABLE SPACE UP THERE BUT    
IT&apos;S BEING QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE 

00:17:31.878 --> 00:17:34.344
HABITABLE SPACE UP THERE BUT    
IT&apos;S BEING QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE 
THE CEILING IS QUITE LOW AND I  

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.179
IT&apos;S BEING QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE 
THE CEILING IS QUITE LOW AND I  
DON&apos;T KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE    

00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:38.482
THE CEILING IS QUITE LOW AND I  
DON&apos;T KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE    
WAS UM ATTEMPTS I THINK TO

FLOORS ARE BEING USED AS A      
BEDROOM THAT MEANS THAT I MEAN  
IT&apos;S A LITTLE HARD TO FOLLOW    

00:18:16.489 --> 00:18:17.221
BEDROOM THAT MEANS THAT I MEAN  
IT&apos;S A LITTLE HARD TO FOLLOW    
THE WHOLE STAIRCASE SCENARIO    

00:18:17.223 --> 00:18:17.554
IT&apos;S A LITTLE HARD TO FOLLOW    
THE WHOLE STAIRCASE SCENARIO    
HERE.                           

00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:20.257
THE WHOLE STAIRCASE SCENARIO    
HERE.                           
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY&apos;RE THERE ARE 

00:18:20.259 --> 00:18:20.958
HERE.                           
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY&apos;RE THERE ARE 
INTERNAL STAIRCASES AND THEY&apos;RE 

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.128
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY&apos;RE THERE ARE 
INTERNAL STAIRCASES AND THEY&apos;RE 
ALSO STAIRCASES THAT ARE        

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.862
INTERNAL STAIRCASES AND THEY&apos;RE 
ALSO STAIRCASES THAT ARE        
ESSENTIALLY FIRE ESCAPES AND    

00:18:24.864 --> 00:18:27.297
ALSO STAIRCASES THAT ARE        
ESSENTIALLY FIRE ESCAPES AND    
THERE ARE FIRES.                

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:31.034
ESSENTIALLY FIRE ESCAPES AND    
THERE ARE FIRES.                
BUT BUT ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS TO 

00:18:31.036 --> 00:18:32.102
THERE ARE FIRES.                
BUT BUT ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS TO 
GET TO THE BEDROOMS ON THE VERY 

00:18:32.104 --> 00:18:35.172
BUT BUT ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS TO 
GET TO THE BEDROOMS ON THE VERY 
TOP FLOOR ARE THROUGH ANOTHER   

00:18:35.174 --> 00:18:36.107
GET TO THE BEDROOMS ON THE VERY 
TOP FLOOR ARE THROUGH ANOTHER   
BEDROOM ON THE FLOOR BELOW      

00:18:36.109 --> 00:18:38.976
TOP FLOOR ARE THROUGH ANOTHER   
BEDROOM ON THE FLOOR BELOW      
RIGHT.                          

00:18:38.978 --> 00:18:40.111
BEDROOM ON THE FLOOR BELOW      
RIGHT.                          
WHICH I BELIEVE IS THAT IS THAT 

00:18:40.113 --> 00:18:41.044
RIGHT.                          
WHICH I BELIEVE IS THAT IS THAT 
IS ONE THING I BELIEVE HAS BEEN 

00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:42.380
WHICH I BELIEVE IS THAT IS THAT 
IS ONE THING I BELIEVE HAS BEEN 
CITED BY INSPECTION INSPECTORS  

00:18:42.382 --> 00:18:46.483
IS ONE THING I BELIEVE HAS BEEN 
CITED BY INSPECTION INSPECTORS  
IN THE PAST SO ON.              

00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:50.521
CITED BY INSPECTION INSPECTORS  
IN THE PAST SO ON.              
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE&apos;S REALLY NO WAY TO 

00:18:50.523 --> 00:18:51.121
IN THE PAST SO ON.              
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE&apos;S REALLY NO WAY TO 
CONTROL THIS SUITE.             

00:18:51.123 --> 00:18:52.056
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE&apos;S REALLY NO WAY TO 
CONTROL THIS SUITE.             
I GUESS YOU GUYS ARE USING IT   

00:18:52.058 --> 00:18:54.191
CONTROL THIS SUITE.             
I GUESS YOU GUYS ARE USING IT   
AS A BEDROOM OF A BEDROOM       

00:18:54.193 --> 00:18:55.126
I GUESS YOU GUYS ARE USING IT   
AS A BEDROOM OF A BEDROOM       
BEDROOM WOULD BE CONVERTED INTO 

00:18:55.128 --> 00:18:55.526
AS A BEDROOM OF A BEDROOM       
BEDROOM WOULD BE CONVERTED INTO 
A SINGLE DESK.                  

00:18:55.528 --> 00:18:55.926
BEDROOM WOULD BE CONVERTED INTO 
A SINGLE DESK.                  
YEAH, YEAH.                     

00:18:55.928 --> 00:18:59.162
A SINGLE DESK.                  
YEAH, YEAH.                     
I THINK WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FOR 

00:18:59.164 --> 00:19:02.700
YEAH, YEAH.                     
I THINK WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FOR 
A LARGE TYPE AND WHAT WAS A     

00:19:02.702 --> 00:19:03.433
I THINK WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FOR 
A LARGE TYPE AND WHAT WAS A     
CONSTRUCTION TYPE IS A FIVE     

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:05.736
A LARGE TYPE AND WHAT WAS A     
CONSTRUCTION TYPE IS A FIVE     
YEAR FIVE EIGHTY FIVE FEET.     

00:19:05.738 --> 00:19:06.704
CONSTRUCTION TYPE IS A FIVE     
YEAR FIVE EIGHTY FIVE FEET.     
SO THERE&apos;S THE SEPARATION       

00:19:06.706 --> 00:19:09.773
YEAR FIVE EIGHTY FIVE FEET.     
SO THERE&apos;S THE SEPARATION       
BETWEEN UNITS IS REALLY         

00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:10.540
SO THERE&apos;S THE SEPARATION       
BETWEEN UNITS IS REALLY         
WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS BUILT IN 

00:19:10.542 --> 00:19:10.874
BETWEEN UNITS IS REALLY         
WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS BUILT IN 
THE 20S.                        

00:19:10.876 --> 00:19:11.208
WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS BUILT IN 
THE 20S.                        
RIGHT.

IT LOOKS LIKE JUST WOOD.        
&gt;&gt; IT&apos;LL BE ENCASED IN FIVE     
EIGHTHS OF BUT THAT WOULD BE    

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:20.544
&gt;&gt; IT&apos;LL BE ENCASED IN FIVE     
EIGHTHS OF BUT THAT WOULD BE    
AGAIN OUR STRUCTURE, OUR DEMISE 

00:25:20.546 --> 00:25:23.213
EIGHTHS OF BUT THAT WOULD BE    
AGAIN OUR STRUCTURE, OUR DEMISE 
AND WALLS ARE GOING RIGHT UP TO
