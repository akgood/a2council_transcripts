CRITICAL AREAS PARTICULARLY     
TRYING TO HAVE MORE DIVERSITY   

00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:41.918
CRITICAL AREAS PARTICULARLY     
TRYING TO HAVE MORE DIVERSITY

I THINK THAT IS REALLY WHERE    
OFTENTIMES A PUBLIC SECTOR      

00:06:43.622 --> 00:06:46.523
I THINK THAT IS REALLY WHERE    
OFTENTIMES A PUBLIC SECTOR      
EMPLOYER EMPLOYER CAN REALLY

COST OF THE ELECTRIC THE TIME   

00:28:32.329 --> 00:28:32.761
THAT THAT IT IS REALLY ONLY THE 
COST OF THE ELECTRIC THE TIME   
OF CHARGING.                    

00:28:32.763 --> 00:28:33.495
COST OF THE ELECTRIC THE TIME   
OF CHARGING.

WE HAVE WE HAVE RESTRICTED A    
LOT OF OUR HOUSING

WE HAVE WE HAVE RESTRICTED A    
LOT OF OUR HOUSING              
OPPORTUNITIES AND ADDED A LOT   

01:11:08.482 --> 01:11:09.281
LOT OF OUR HOUSING              
OPPORTUNITIES AND ADDED A LOT   
OF REGULATIONS WHICH DRIVES A   

01:11:09.283 --> 01:11:09.982
OPPORTUNITIES AND ADDED A LOT   
OF REGULATIONS WHICH DRIVES A   
LOT OF SOME OF THAT CONVERSION  

01:11:09.984 --> 01:11:10.583
OF REGULATIONS WHICH DRIVES A   
LOT OF SOME OF THAT CONVERSION  
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT       

01:11:10.585 --> 01:11:14.319
LOT OF SOME OF THAT CONVERSION  
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT       
THINGS LIKE HISTORIC HOMES      

01:11:14.321 --> 01:11:18.991
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT       
THINGS LIKE HISTORIC HOMES      
BEING SORT OF TRIED TO MAXIMIZE 

01:11:18.993 --> 01:11:19.758
THINGS LIKE HISTORIC HOMES      
BEING SORT OF TRIED TO MAXIMIZE 
TWO SIX BEDROOM UNITS BECAUSE   

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.559
BEING SORT OF TRIED TO MAXIMIZE 
TWO SIX BEDROOM UNITS BECAUSE   
WE DON'T PROVIDE A LOT          

01:11:20.561 --> 01:11:22.594
TWO SIX BEDROOM UNITS BECAUSE   
WE DON'T PROVIDE A LOT          
OF FLEXIBILITY FOR THAT.        

01:11:22.596 --> 01:11:23.529
WE DON'T PROVIDE A LOT          
OF FLEXIBILITY FOR THAT.        
SO TO DATE WE HAVEN'T TALKED    

01:11:23.531 --> 01:11:26.265
OF FLEXIBILITY FOR THAT.        
SO TO DATE WE HAVEN'T TALKED    
MUCH ABOUT DIFFERENTIATE THAT   

01:11:26.267 --> 01:11:26.866
SO TO DATE WE HAVEN'T TALKED    
MUCH ABOUT DIFFERENTIATE THAT   
FROM NEIGHBORHOOD TO            

01:11:26.868 --> 01:11:30.202
MUCH ABOUT DIFFERENTIATE THAT   
FROM NEIGHBORHOOD TO            
NEIGHBORHOOD PERSPECTIVE BUT I  

01:11:30.204 --> 01:11:31.137
FROM NEIGHBORHOOD TO            
NEIGHBORHOOD PERSPECTIVE BUT I  
THINK SOME OF THAT FRANKLY WILL 

01:11:31.139 --> 01:11:32.004
NEIGHBORHOOD PERSPECTIVE BUT I  
THINK SOME OF THAT FRANKLY WILL 
ALSO COME OUT OF THE CONTEXT    

01:11:32.006 --> 01:11:34.640
THINK SOME OF THAT FRANKLY WILL 
ALSO COME OUT OF THE CONTEXT    
OF SORT OF THAT LOW, MODERATE,  

01:11:34.642 --> 01:11:38.110
ALSO COME OUT OF THE CONTEXT    
OF SORT OF THAT LOW, MODERATE,  
HIGH POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT  

01:11:38.112 --> 01:11:38.378
OF SORT OF THAT LOW, MODERATE,  
HIGH POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT  
GROWTH.                         

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.445
HIGH POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT  
GROWTH.                         
WE THINK STACY TALKED ABOUT IT  

01:11:39.447 --> 01:11:41.880
GROWTH.                         
WE THINK STACY TALKED ABOUT IT  
BUT ONE OF YOUR DIRECTIONS TO   

01:11:41.882 --> 01:11:45.050
WE THINK STACY TALKED ABOUT IT  
BUT ONE OF YOUR DIRECTIONS TO   
US WAS ALSO TO TRY AND REDUCE   

01:11:45.052 --> 01:11:45.851
BUT ONE OF YOUR DIRECTIONS TO   
US WAS ALSO TO TRY AND REDUCE   
THE NUMBER OF ZONING DISTRICTS  

01:11:45.853 --> 01:11:49.755
US WAS ALSO TO TRY AND REDUCE   
THE NUMBER OF ZONING DISTRICTS  
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND 

01:11:49.757 --> 01:11:50.089
THE NUMBER OF ZONING DISTRICTS  
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND 
MORE FLEXIBLE.                  

01:11:50.091 --> 01:11:53.459
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND 
MORE FLEXIBLE.                  
AND SO I THINK THAT'LL PROBABLY 

01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:54.594
MORE FLEXIBLE.                  
AND SO I THINK THAT'LL PROBABLY 
BE A PART OF THAT IS I DON'T    

01:11:54.596 --> 01:11:56.995
AND SO I THINK THAT'LL PROBABLY 
BE A PART OF THAT IS I DON'T    
KNOW HOW HOW LOW WE'LL GET.     

01:11:56.997 --> 01:11:57.997
BE A PART OF THAT IS I DON'T    
KNOW HOW HOW LOW WE'LL GET.     
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET BACK  

01:11:57.999 --> 01:12:00.266
KNOW HOW HOW LOW WE'LL GET.     
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET BACK  
TO OUR ORIGINAL FOUR FROM       

01:12:00.268 --> 01:12:08.207
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET BACK

WE CAN LOOK AT IT.

WE HAVE NOT DIFFERENTIATED YET  
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE         

01:12:11.378 --> 01:12:12.245

BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE         
CONSIDER AS WE'RE PUTTING FORTH 

01:12:12.247 --> 01:12:12.645

THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.     
AND I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE 

01:12:43.011 --> 01:12:46.211

HAPPENING AROUND THE CITY COMES 

01:12:52.187 --> 01:12:54.187
LOT OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE     
HAPPENING AROUND THE CITY COMES 
FROM A FEELING OF LOSS          

01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.654
HAPPENING AROUND THE CITY COMES 
FROM A FEELING OF LOSS          
OF PLACE.

PART OF IT'S JUST EDUCATION     

01:14:31.085 --> 01:14:31.750
PROBABLY PART OF IT, PROBABLY   
PART OF IT'S JUST EDUCATION     
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE TAX      

01:14:31.752 --> 01:14:34.754
PART OF IT'S JUST EDUCATION     
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE TAX

01:14:34.756 --> 01:14:37.089
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE TAX      
IMPLICATIONS IS GOING TO GOING  
TO MIGHT BE OR AND MIGHT NOT BE 

01:14:37.091 --> 01:14:37.289
IMPLICATIONS IS GOING TO GOING  
TO MIGHT BE OR AND MIGHT NOT BE 
.                               

01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:38.023
TO MIGHT BE OR AND MIGHT NOT BE 
.                               
BUT IT'S ALSO YEAH.             

01:14:38.025 --> 01:14:41.260
.                               
BUT IT'S ALSO YEAH.             
IT'S ALSO JUST REALLY NOT VERY
