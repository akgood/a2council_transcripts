IT WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL TO    
HAVE REGULATE.                  
SO I JUST WASN'T SURE WHY THIS  

00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:22.199
HAVE REGULATE.                  
SO I JUST WASN'T SURE WHY THIS

SURE WHY THOSE WERE             
SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT.        

00:15:26.773 --> 00:15:29.240
SURE WHY THOSE WERE             
SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT.        
>> YEAH, THE ONLY REASON THAT   

00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:30.040

>> YEAH, THE ONLY REASON THAT   
THOSE ARE SPECIFICALLY CALLED   

00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:33.009

THOSE ARE SPECIFICALLY CALLED   
OUT ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY   

00:15:33.011 --> 00:15:33.778
THOSE ARE SPECIFICALLY CALLED   
OUT ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY   
SIX OR SEVEN USES ON OUR        

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.080
OUT ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY   
SIX OR SEVEN USES ON OUR

NO REQUIRED BICYCLE PARKING.    

00:15:37.817 --> 00:15:40.951
CURRENT PARKING TABLE THAT HAVE

SO IT WAS A CARRY OVER OF THE   

00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:41.685
NO REQUIRED BICYCLE PARKING.    
SO IT WAS A CARRY OVER OF THE
