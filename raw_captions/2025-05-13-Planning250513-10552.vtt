IS A PROBLEM FOR CITIES ALL     
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THAT     

00:47:23.471 --> 00:47:26.237
IS A PROBLEM FOR CITIES ALL

00:47:42.156 --> 00:47:45.323
TO GROW CITIES FOR DIVERSE      
POPULATIONS AND I THINK IT'S

REALLY CAREFULLY COMMUNICATED

UNDERSTAND.

SO THAT NOT EXPERTS LIKE ME CAN 
UNDERSTAND.

SUBDISTRICTS BECAUSE I THINK    

00:47:57.905 --> 00:47:58.637
ABOUT NOT CREATING NEW          
SUBDISTRICTS BECAUSE I THINK    
THAT THAT COULD FURTHER DELAY

THAT THAT COULD FURTHER DELAY   
SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

HOUSING STOCK AND I HAVE SEEN   

01:04:42.107 --> 01:04:42.840

HOUSING STOCK AND I HAVE SEEN   
FIRSTHAND HOW DISRUPTIVE IT CAN 

01:04:42.842 --> 01:04:45.309
HOUSING STOCK AND I HAVE SEEN   
FIRSTHAND HOW DISRUPTIVE IT CAN 
BE WHEN A DEVELOPER BUYS A      

01:04:45.311 --> 01:04:49.146
FIRSTHAND HOW DISRUPTIVE IT CAN 
BE WHEN A DEVELOPER BUYS A      
PIECE OF LAND EIGHT SECONDS     

01:04:49.148 --> 01:04:49.880
BE WHEN A DEVELOPER BUYS A      
PIECE OF LAND EIGHT SECONDS     
LEFT AND THEN DEMOLISHES IT     

01:04:49.882 --> 01:04:50.081

LEFT AND THEN DEMOLISHES IT     
RIGHT.                          

01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:50.882
LEFT AND THEN DEMOLISHES IT     
RIGHT.                          
AND SO MAYBE THAT NOW IT        

01:04:50.884 --> 01:04:53.350
RIGHT.

WE WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO     
BECAUSE SOME NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE 

03:35:01.184 --> 03:35:04.386
WE WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO     
BECAUSE SOME NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE 
BEEN HISTORICALLY SORT

EMBEDDED STRUCTURE AND THEN WE  
TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT, THEN WHAT 
WE'RE DOING IS CONTINUING THAT  

03:35:21.372 --> 03:35:24.472
TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT, THEN WHAT 
WE'RE DOING IS CONTINUING THAT  
HOUSING SEGREGATION INTO THE    

03:35:24.474 --> 03:35:25.140
WE'RE DOING IS CONTINUING THAT

YEAH UM I DO HAVE A QUESTION    
BECAUSE I'M I'M STILL NOT QUITE 

03:37:42.579 --> 03:37:43.478
YEAH UM I DO HAVE A QUESTION    
BECAUSE I'M I'M STILL NOT QUITE 
GRASPING THIS BUT IF BUT        

03:37:43.480 --> 03:37:46.948
BECAUSE I'M I'M STILL NOT QUITE 
GRASPING THIS BUT IF BUT        
COMBINATION ARE POSSIBLE AND

WE'RE NOT RESTRICTING THE

THIS IS WHAT'S FREAKING PEOPLE  
THEY'RE CALLING BLOCKBUSTING.   

03:37:55.125 --> 03:37:58.393
THIS IS WHAT'S FREAKING PEOPLE  
THEY'RE CALLING BLOCKBUSTING.   
SO THE WAY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY 

03:37:58.395 --> 03:37:59.327
THEY'RE CALLING BLOCKBUSTING.   
SO THE WAY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY 
DISCUSSING IT THAT WOULD BE     

03:37:59.329 --> 03:38:03.030
SO THE WAY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

PERMITTED BUT BLOCKBUSTING HAS

THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO

THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO  
MAKE THAT COMMENT TO ONE THE    

03:38:30.627 --> 03:38:31.359
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO  
MAKE THAT COMMENT TO ONE THE    
PUBLIC COMMENTER SAID UM BUT    

03:38:31.361 --> 03:38:33.895
MAKE THAT COMMENT TO ONE THE

SO IN THIS IF WE'RE IN THE LOW

THAT WORD AND IF THAT'S NOT THE

THE IDEA STILL THOUGH IS THAT   

03:38:58.388 --> 03:39:01.222
ACCURATE WORD.                  
THE IDEA STILL THOUGH IS THAT

THE IDEA STILL THOUGH IS THAT

03:39:01.959 --> 03:39:05.026
WITHOUT USING A NUMBER OF UNITS

COULD STILL BE A LOCKWOOD

03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:38.993
YEAH I THINK I THINK TO BE      
CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  
IS YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY

CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  
IS YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY      
PURCHASED EVERY LOT ON A BLOCK

IS YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY      
PURCHASED EVERY LOT ON A BLOCK  
AND IN THE CONTEXT OF A

NEIGHBORHOOD IF THAT WOULD BE   
POSSIBLE.                       
BUT THAT WOULDN'T MEAN THEY     

03:39:47.070 --> 03:39:50.705
POSSIBLE.                       
BUT THAT WOULDN'T MEAN THEY     
COULD BUILD A CORNER TO CORNER  

03:39:50.707 --> 03:39:51.506
BUT THAT WOULDN'T MEAN THEY     
COULD BUILD A CORNER TO CORNER  
APARTMENT BLOCK ON THAT.        

03:39:51.508 --> 03:39:52.440
COULD BUILD A CORNER TO CORNER  
APARTMENT BLOCK ON THAT.        
IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO MEET     

03:39:52.442 --> 03:39:53.108
APARTMENT BLOCK ON THAT.        
IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO MEET     
THESE BROAD BASED STANDARDS     

03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:54.976
IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO MEET     
THESE BROAD BASED STANDARDS     
WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE TO        

03:39:54.978 --> 03:39:55.577

WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE TO        
REALIZE WHATEVER DENSITY        
OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE FORM      

03:39:56.246 --> 03:39:59.180
REALIZE WHATEVER DENSITY        
OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE FORM      
OF STANDARDS THAT GET           

03:39:59.182 --> 03:39:59.781

ULTIMATELY PRESCRIBED TO        
REGULATE IT.                    
SO IT MIGHT IT MIGHT RESULT IN  

03:40:03.586 --> 03:40:07.555
REGULATE IT.                    
SO IT MIGHT IT MIGHT RESULT IN  
TAKING HOUSES FROM A BLOCK IN   

03:40:07.557 --> 03:40:08.223
SO IT MIGHT IT MIGHT RESULT IN  
TAKING HOUSES FROM A BLOCK IN   
THIS MOST EXTREME CASE AND      

03:40:08.225 --> 03:40:10.792
TAKING HOUSES FROM A BLOCK IN   
THIS MOST EXTREME CASE AND      
ALLOWING THEM TO BE REPLACED BY

THIS MOST EXTREME CASE AND      
ALLOWING THEM TO BE REPLACED BY 
TWELVE NEW STRUCTURES.          

03:40:11.394 --> 03:40:14.328
ALLOWING THEM TO BE REPLACED BY 
TWELVE NEW STRUCTURES.          
BUT UNDER THE NEW CODE IT MIGHT 

03:40:14.330 --> 03:40:14.996
TWELVE NEW STRUCTURES.          
BUT UNDER THE NEW CODE IT MIGHT 
ALLOW MULTIPLE UNITS IN THOSE   

03:40:14.998 --> 03:40:15.797
BUT UNDER THE NEW CODE IT MIGHT 
ALLOW MULTIPLE UNITS IN THOSE   
BUT THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE 

03:40:15.799 --> 03:40:18.066
ALLOW MULTIPLE UNITS IN THOSE   
BUT THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE 
BROKEN UP IN SOME WAY.          

03:40:18.068 --> 03:40:19.200
BUT THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE 
BROKEN UP IN SOME WAY.          
SO THAT'S WHAT I AM HEARING     

03:40:19.202 --> 03:40:21.703
BROKEN UP IN SOME WAY.          
SO THAT'S WHAT I AM HEARING

03:41:18.227 --> 03:41:20.061
              WE'RE LOOKING AT

03:41:20.063 --> 03:41:20.395
A SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR LAND

RIGHT.                          

03:41:20.397 --> 03:41:21.196
ACQUISITION COSTS.              
RIGHT.                          
WHICH WOULD MAKE THE COST PER   

03:41:21.198 --> 03:41:21.863
RIGHT.                          
WHICH WOULD MAKE THE COST PER   
UNIT SO ASTRONOMICAL THAT IT

SO WE CANNOT IMAGINE EVERYTHING 

03:41:23.266 --> 03:41:23.798
WOULD NOT PENCIL OUT.

THAT'S WRONG AND I THOUGHT THAT 
WHEN WE GOT AWAY FROM THE UNIT  
BASED RESTRICTION AND WENT AND

WHEN WE GOT AWAY FROM THE UNIT

HYPOTHETICAL THAT IS TRULY LIKE 

03:44:59.482 --> 03:45:00.114
LAW TO BLOCK OFF THAT           
HYPOTHETICAL THAT IS TRULY LIKE 
APPLYING THIS KIND              

03:45:00.116 --> 03:45:04.219
HYPOTHETICAL THAT IS TRULY LIKE 
APPLYING THIS KIND              
OF HYPOTHETICAL I I THINK WHAT  

03:45:04.221 --> 03:45:05.152
APPLYING THIS KIND              
OF HYPOTHETICAL I I THINK WHAT  
I WAS GETTING ON THE TABLE IS   

03:45:05.154 --> 03:45:05.786
OF HYPOTHETICAL I I THINK WHAT  
I WAS GETTING ON THE TABLE IS   
THAT YOU COULD USE FOREIGN      

03:45:05.788 --> 03:45:08.056
I WAS GETTING ON THE TABLE IS   
THAT YOU COULD USE FOREIGN      
INTERVENTION TO LIMIT YEAH.     

03:45:08.058 --> 03:45:09.056
THAT YOU COULD USE FOREIGN      
INTERVENTION TO LIMIT YEAH.     
>> BECAUSE YOU COULD DO THE     

03:45:09.058 --> 03:45:11.793
INTERVENTION TO LIMIT YEAH.     
>> BECAUSE YOU COULD DO THE     
SAME WAY WE DO AN EASY ONE.     

03:45:11.795 --> 03:45:12.927
>> BECAUSE YOU COULD DO THE     
SAME WAY WE DO AN EASY ONE.     
WE HAVE A MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE SO  

03:45:12.929 --> 03:45:13.661
SAME WAY WE DO AN EASY ONE.     
WE HAVE A MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE SO  
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BREAK.       

03:45:13.663 --> 03:45:16.564
WE HAVE A MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE SO  
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BREAK.       
YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE IT SO SO     

03:45:16.566 --> 03:45:17.431
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BREAK.       
YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE IT SO SO     
THAT WE COULD DO THAT ON A      

03:45:17.433 --> 03:45:19.099
YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE IT SO SO     
THAT WE COULD DO THAT ON A      
RESIDENTIAL SCALE IS THE        

03:45:19.101 --> 03:45:19.367
THAT WE COULD DO THAT ON A      
RESIDENTIAL SCALE IS THE        
ANSWER.                         

03:45:19.369 --> 03:45:20.167
RESIDENTIAL SCALE IS THE        
ANSWER.                         
>> SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD      

03:45:20.169 --> 03:45:22.736
ANSWER.                         
>> SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD      
RECOMMEND BECAUSE WE ALREADY    

03:45:22.738 --> 03:45:23.371
>> SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD      
RECOMMEND BECAUSE WE ALREADY    
USE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS AND   

03:45:23.373 --> 03:45:24.105
RECOMMEND BECAUSE WE ALREADY    
USE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS AND   
SO ADDING THOSE IS FINE         

03:45:24.107 --> 03:45:24.438
USE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS AND   
SO ADDING THOSE IS FINE         
SETBACKS.                       

03:45:24.440 --> 03:45:27.141
SO ADDING THOSE IS FINE         
SETBACKS.                       
HYDES PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.   

03:45:27.143 --> 03:45:28.076
SETBACKS.                       
HYDES PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.   
I THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T       

03:45:28.078 --> 03:45:30.745
HYDES PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.   
I THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T       
UNDERSTAND IS FORM BASE         

03:45:30.747 --> 03:45:31.679
I THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T       
UNDERSTAND IS FORM BASE         
CODE AND TO BE CLEAR THIS WOULD 

03:45:31.681 --> 03:45:32.480
UNDERSTAND IS FORM BASE         
CODE AND TO BE CLEAR THIS WOULD 
OBVIOUSLY BE A HYBRID BECAUSE   

03:45:32.482 --> 03:45:35.016
CODE AND TO BE CLEAR THIS WOULD 
OBVIOUSLY BE A HYBRID BECAUSE   
FORM BASE CODE ONLY REGULATING  

03:45:35.018 --> 03:45:35.850
OBVIOUSLY BE A HYBRID BECAUSE   
FORM BASE CODE ONLY REGULATING  
BY FORM WERE REGULATED BY USE   

03:45:35.852 --> 03:45:38.853
FORM BASE CODE ONLY REGULATING  
BY FORM WERE REGULATED BY USE   
AND FORM SO THAT MAYBE WE COULD 

03:45:38.855 --> 03:45:42.523
BY FORM WERE REGULATED BY USE   
AND FORM SO THAT MAYBE WE COULD 
JUST ADD SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT  

03:45:42.525 --> 03:45:45.826
AND FORM SO THAT MAYBE WE COULD 
JUST ADD SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT  
WE MEAN BY FORM BASED TO MAYBE  

03:45:45.828 --> 03:45:46.660
JUST ADD SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT  
WE MEAN BY FORM BASED TO MAYBE  
CLARIFY THAT TO THE PUBLIC AND  

03:45:46.662 --> 03:45:47.428
WE MEAN BY FORM BASED TO MAYBE  
CLARIFY THAT TO THE PUBLIC AND  
BRING IT BACK TO YOU FOR THE    

03:45:47.430 --> 03:45:49.563
CLARIFY THAT TO THE PUBLIC AND  
BRING IT BACK TO YOU FOR THE    
SECOND ROUND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 

03:45:49.565 --> 03:45:50.397
BRING IT BACK TO YOU FOR THE    
SECOND ROUND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 
GETTING THE VISION CORRECT.     

03:45:50.399 --> 03:45:51.166
SECOND ROUND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 
GETTING THE VISION CORRECT.     
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE        

03:45:51.168 --> 03:45:53.835
GETTING THE VISION CORRECT.

HELPFUL FOR ME THE WAY I

HELPFUL FOR ME THE WAY I        
UNDERSTAND FOR BASE CODE WOULD  

03:45:54.637 --> 03:45:55.469
HELPFUL FOR ME THE WAY I        
UNDERSTAND FOR BASE CODE WOULD  
BE LIKE IN OUR DOWNTOWN WE KIND 

03:45:55.471 --> 03:45:58.105
UNDERSTAND FOR BASE CODE WOULD  
BE LIKE IN OUR DOWNTOWN WE KIND 
OF HAVE A LITTLE HYBRID BECAUSE 

03:45:58.107 --> 03:45:58.872
BE LIKE IN OUR DOWNTOWN WE KIND 
OF HAVE A LITTLE HYBRID BECAUSE 
THERE'S AT THE 12 FOOT MARK     

03:45:58.874 --> 03:46:02.343
OF HAVE A LITTLE HYBRID BECAUSE 
THERE'S AT THE 12 FOOT MARK     
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO USE A        

03:46:02.345 --> 03:46:03.011
THERE'S AT THE 12 FOOT MARK     
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO USE A        
DIFFERENT TYPE OF MATERIAL SO   

03:46:03.013 --> 03:46:03.811
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO USE A        
DIFFERENT TYPE OF MATERIAL SO   
THAT IT JUST PROVIDES A SENSE   

03:46:03.813 --> 03:46:05.012
DIFFERENT TYPE OF MATERIAL SO   
THAT IT JUST PROVIDES A SENSE   
OF SCALE AS YOUR PEDESTRIAN     

03:46:05.014 --> 03:46:06.180
THAT IT JUST PROVIDES A SENSE   
OF SCALE AS YOUR PEDESTRIAN     
THAT IS A TYPE OF A FORM BASED  

03:46:06.182 --> 03:46:06.514
OF SCALE AS YOUR PEDESTRIAN     
THAT IS A TYPE OF A FORM BASED  
RIGHT.                          

03:46:06.516 --> 03:46:07.181
THAT IS A TYPE OF A FORM BASED  
RIGHT.                          
LIKE YOU'RE NOT REGULATING BY   

03:46:07.183 --> 03:46:09.550
RIGHT.                          
LIKE YOU'RE NOT REGULATING BY   
FSR BUT YOU'RE REGULATING BY A  

03:46:09.552 --> 03:46:10.185
LIKE YOU'RE NOT REGULATING BY   
FSR BUT YOU'RE REGULATING BY A  
MATERIAL THAT WHICH CREATES A   

03:46:10.187 --> 03:46:12.987
FSR BUT YOU'RE REGULATING BY A  
MATERIAL THAT WHICH CREATES A   
DIFFERENT SEGMENTATION OR       

03:46:12.989 --> 03:46:13.588
MATERIAL THAT WHICH CREATES A   
DIFFERENT SEGMENTATION OR       
VISUAL SEPARATION.              

03:46:13.590 --> 03:46:14.455
DIFFERENT SEGMENTATION OR       
VISUAL SEPARATION.              
SO I THINK USING SOME EXAMPLES  

03:46:14.457 --> 03:46:17.492
VISUAL SEPARATION.              
SO I THINK USING SOME EXAMPLES  
TO GET FAMILIARITY WITH WHAT    

03:46:17.494 --> 03:46:18.226
SO I THINK USING SOME EXAMPLES  
TO GET FAMILIARITY WITH WHAT    
FORM BASED MEANS WOULD BE       

03:46:18.228 --> 03:46:24.765
TO GET FAMILIARITY WITH WHAT    
FORM BASED MEANS WOULD BE       
HELPFUL FOR SURE WE DO WE KNOW  

03:46:24.767 --> 03:46:25.633
FORM BASED MEANS WOULD BE       
HELPFUL FOR SURE WE DO WE KNOW  
WE'RE GOING TO DELETE THE       

03:46:25.635 --> 03:46:29.069
HELPFUL FOR SURE WE DO WE KNOW  
WE'RE GOING TO DELETE THE       
PICTURE ON ONE OF NINE THAT I   

03:46:29.071 --> 03:46:30.004
WE'RE GOING TO DELETE THE       
PICTURE ON ONE OF NINE THAT I   
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS TO REMOVE   

03:46:30.006 --> 03:46:32.573
PICTURE ON ONE OF NINE THAT I   
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS TO REMOVE   
THE TOP GRAPHICS SO THAT WE HAD 

03:46:32.575 --> 03:46:33.274
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS TO REMOVE   
THE TOP GRAPHICS SO THAT WE HAD 
MORE ROOM FOR THESE BOTTOM      

03:46:33.276 --> 03:46:36.511
THE TOP GRAPHICS SO THAT WE HAD 
MORE ROOM FOR THESE BOTTOM      
IMAGES TO MAKE THOSE LARGER     

03:46:36.513 --> 03:46:37.111
MORE ROOM FOR THESE BOTTOM      
IMAGES TO MAKE THOSE LARGER     
BECAUSE OF THAT GRAPHIC IN      

03:46:37.113 --> 03:46:40.447
IMAGES TO MAKE THOSE LARGER     
BECAUSE OF THAT GRAPHIC IN      
PARTICULAR LOOKS LIKE EVEN      

03:46:40.449 --> 03:46:43.784
BECAUSE OF THAT GRAPHIC IN      
PARTICULAR LOOKS LIKE EVEN      
THOUGH IT SAYS IT'S ROWHOUSES   

03:46:43.786 --> 03:46:44.752
PARTICULAR LOOKS LIKE EVEN      
THOUGH IT SAYS IT'S ROWHOUSES   
THE WAY IT'S DRAWN I MEAN       

03:46:44.754 --> 03:46:45.353
THOUGH IT SAYS IT'S ROWHOUSES   
THE WAY IT'S DRAWN I MEAN       
LITERALLY I HAD CONVERSATIONS   

03:46:45.355 --> 03:46:48.556
THE WAY IT'S DRAWN I MEAN       
LITERALLY I HAD CONVERSATIONS   
WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THIS AND I    

03:46:48.558 --> 03:46:52.026
LITERALLY I HAD CONVERSATIONS   
WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THIS AND I    
WAS UNABLE TO DEFEND BECAUSE    

03:46:52.028 --> 03:46:52.961
WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THIS AND I    
WAS UNABLE TO DEFEND BECAUSE    
THEY SAW WHAT THEY SAW AND I    

03:46:52.963 --> 03:46:55.863
WAS UNABLE TO DEFEND BECAUSE    
THEY SAW WHAT THEY SAW AND I    
WAS TRYING TO SAY NO, THAT'S    

03:46:55.865 --> 03:46:59.467
THEY SAW WHAT THEY SAW AND I    
WAS TRYING TO SAY NO, THAT'S    
NOT WHAT THOSE ARE ROWHOUSES    

03:46:59.469 --> 03:47:00.301
WAS TRYING TO SAY NO, THAT'S    
NOT WHAT THOSE ARE ROWHOUSES    
THERE ARE THERE'S I GUESS YOU   

03:47:00.303 --> 03:47:03.537
NOT WHAT THOSE ARE ROWHOUSES    
THERE ARE THERE'S I GUESS YOU   
WOULD SAY ONE WITH ARTICULATION 

03:47:03.539 --> 03:47:07.442
THERE ARE THERE'S I GUESS YOU   
WOULD SAY ONE WITH ARTICULATION 
THERE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG   

03:47:07.444 --> 03:47:08.175
WOULD SAY ONE WITH ARTICULATION 
THERE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG   
LONG THING RIGHT TO THEM IT     

03:47:08.177 --> 03:47:11.211
THERE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG   
LONG THING RIGHT TO THEM IT     
LOOKS LIKE A BIG LONG THING AND 

03:47:11.213 --> 03:47:11.912
LONG THING RIGHT TO THEM IT     
LOOKS LIKE A BIG LONG THING AND 
IT'S JUST BECAUSE THESE AREN'T  

03:47:11.914 --> 03:47:12.647
LOOKS LIKE A BIG LONG THING AND 
IT'S JUST BECAUSE THESE AREN'T  
LEGIBLE TO THE PUBLIC IN THE    

03:47:12.649 --> 03:47:15.849
IT'S JUST BECAUSE THESE AREN'T  
LEGIBLE TO THE PUBLIC IN THE    
WAYS THAT THEY ARE LEGIBLE TO.  

03:47:15.851 --> 03:47:16.684
LEGIBLE TO THE PUBLIC IN THE    
WAYS THAT THEY ARE LEGIBLE TO.  
AND SO THEY WERE INSISTING TO   

03:47:16.686 --> 03:47:18.886
WAYS THAT THEY ARE LEGIBLE TO.  
AND SO THEY WERE INSISTING TO   
ME, OH NO, NO, THAT'S JUST      

03:47:18.888 --> 03:47:20.087
AND SO THEY WERE INSISTING TO   
ME, OH NO, NO, THAT'S JUST      
THAT'S A BIG LONG LOCKWOOD LIKE 

03:47:20.089 --> 03:47:22.122
ME, OH NO, NO, THAT'S JUST      
THAT'S A BIG LONG LOCKWOOD LIKE 
BUILDING.                       

03:47:22.124 --> 03:47:26.093
THAT'S A BIG LONG LOCKWOOD LIKE 
BUILDING.                       
SO THERE'S A REAL THERE THERE I 

03:47:26.095 --> 03:47:30.131
BUILDING.                       
SO THERE'S A REAL THERE THERE I 
KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE       

03:47:30.133 --> 03:47:30.998
SO THERE'S A REAL THERE THERE I 
KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE       
INTEGRITY IN THE WORDS THAT WE  

03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:33.867
KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE       
INTEGRITY IN THE WORDS THAT WE  
USE BUT THERE IS ALSO A REAL    

03:47:33.869 --> 03:47:34.635
INTEGRITY IN THE WORDS THAT WE  
USE BUT THERE IS ALSO A REAL    
COMMUNICATION GAP AND WHERE WE  

03:47:34.637 --> 03:47:38.239
USE BUT THERE IS ALSO A REAL    
COMMUNICATION GAP AND WHERE WE  
HEAR IT EVERY NIGHT HERE, HALF  

03:47:38.241 --> 03:47:39.173
COMMUNICATION GAP AND WHERE WE  
HEAR IT EVERY NIGHT HERE, HALF  
OF WHAT WE HEAR IS FRIGHTENING  

03:47:39.175 --> 03:47:41.709
HEAR IT EVERY NIGHT HERE, HALF  
OF WHAT WE HEAR IS FRIGHTENING  
BECAUSE IT IS FRIGHTENING BUT   

03:47:41.711 --> 03:47:42.710
OF WHAT WE HEAR IS FRIGHTENING  
BECAUSE IT IS FRIGHTENING BUT   
IT'S NOT IN THE PLAN AND THAT   

03:47:42.712 --> 03:47:45.613
BECAUSE IT IS FRIGHTENING BUT   
IT'S NOT IN THE PLAN AND THAT   
IS REALLY I'M TRYING TO HAVE    

03:47:45.615 --> 03:47:46.413
IT'S NOT IN THE PLAN AND THAT

GOT BUILT IN THIS ONE I DON'T   
OBJECT TO THAT.

03:48:35.799 --> 03:48:36.264
HORRIBLE THINGS THAT COULD BE   
BUILT THAT ARE WAY OUT

THAT'S GOT TO MEAN SOMETHING.   

03:48:55.685 --> 03:48:58.419
GENTLE INCREASES IN DENSITY.    
THAT'S GOT TO MEAN SOMETHING.   
WE'RE HEARING FROM EVERYBODY MY

NORTON'S COMMENT ABOUT GENTLE   
THE PRESENCE OF GENTIL IN THE   
PLAN COMES FROM THE QUOTES      

03:51:55.231 --> 03:51:55.896
THE PRESENCE OF GENTIL IN THE   
PLAN COMES FROM THE QUOTES      
OF THE RESIDENTS WHICH WE'VE    

03:51:55.898 --> 03:51:58.232
PLAN COMES FROM THE QUOTES      
OF THE RESIDENTS WHICH WE'VE    
STRUCK AND THE ONLY PLACE THAT  

03:51:58.234 --> 03:52:01.568
OF THE RESIDENTS WHICH WE'VE    
STRUCK AND THE ONLY PLACE THAT  
IT SURVIVES IN THE ACTUAL PLAN  

03:52:01.570 --> 03:52:02.502
STRUCK AND THE ONLY PLACE THAT  
IT SURVIVES IN THE ACTUAL PLAN  
WOULD BE ON PAGE FIFTY THREE    

03:52:02.504 --> 03:52:05.739
IT SURVIVES IN THE ACTUAL PLAN  
WOULD BE ON PAGE FIFTY THREE    
WHEN WE SPEAK OF MISSING MIDDLE 

03:52:05.741 --> 03:52:09.443
WOULD BE ON PAGE FIFTY THREE    
WHEN WE SPEAK OF MISSING MIDDLE 
AND SO IT'S JUST ONE MODIFIER   

03:52:09.445 --> 03:52:10.411
WHEN WE SPEAK OF MISSING MIDDLE 
AND SO IT'S JUST ONE MODIFIER   
TO THE AMOUNT OF DENSITY THERE. 

03:52:10.413 --> 03:52:14.181
AND SO IT'S JUST ONE MODIFIER   
TO THE AMOUNT OF DENSITY THERE. 
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER   

03:52:14.183 --> 03:52:14.982
TO THE AMOUNT OF DENSITY THERE. 
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER   
FOR US TO SETTLE ON EITHER

SEE WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE    
THAT DOESN'T GET LOST AND I     

03:59:00.355 --> 03:59:01.021
SEE WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE    
THAT DOESN'T GET LOST AND I     
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING   

03:59:01.023 --> 03:59:01.755
THAT DOESN'T GET LOST AND I     
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING   
ABOUT THE MISSING MIDDLE BUT    

03:59:01.757 --> 03:59:04.758
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING   
ABOUT THE MISSING MIDDLE BUT    
THAT'S KIND OF DESCRIBING TYPE  

03:59:04.760 --> 03:59:05.492
ABOUT THE MISSING MIDDLE BUT    
THAT'S KIND OF DESCRIBING TYPE  
MORE THAN IT IS THESE QUESTIONS 

03:59:05.494 --> 03:59:08.662
THAT'S KIND OF DESCRIBING TYPE  
MORE THAN IT IS THESE QUESTIONS 
ABOUT FORMING FIT WITH THE      

03:59:08.664 --> 03:59:09.129
MORE THAN IT IS THESE QUESTIONS 
ABOUT FORMING FIT WITH THE      
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   

03:59:09.131 --> 03:59:10.063
ABOUT FORMING FIT WITH THE      
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
AND SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE 

03:59:10.065 --> 03:59:12.666
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
AND SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THAT CONCEPT ISN'T    

03:59:12.668 --> 03:59:16.470
AND SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THAT CONCEPT ISN'T    
COMPLETELY JETTISONED?          

03:59:16.472 --> 03:59:17.538
SURE THAT THAT CONCEPT ISN'T    
COMPLETELY JETTISONED?          
I JUST DON'T I DON'T THINK WE   

03:59:17.540 --> 03:59:18.338
COMPLETELY JETTISONED?          
I JUST DON'T I DON'T THINK WE   
CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON     

03:59:18.340 --> 03:59:20.741
I JUST DON'T I DON'T THINK WE   
CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON     
WHAT IT MEANS AND THEREFORE I   

03:59:20.743 --> 03:59:21.574
CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON     
WHAT IT MEANS AND THEREFORE I   
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD USE IT    

03:59:21.576 --> 03:59:23.376
WHAT IT MEANS AND THEREFORE I   
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD USE IT    
BECAUSE YOUR DEFINITION         

03:59:23.378 --> 03:59:24.210
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD USE IT    
BECAUSE YOUR DEFINITION         
OF GENERAL WON'T MEET MY        

03:59:24.212 --> 03:59:27.514
BECAUSE YOUR DEFINITION         
OF GENERAL WON'T MEET MY        
DEFINITION OF GENTLE AND SO     

03:59:27.516 --> 03:59:28.382
OF GENERAL WON'T MEET MY        
DEFINITION OF GENTLE AND SO     
BECAUSE I THINK HAVING A BLOCK  

03:59:28.384 --> 03:59:31.919
DEFINITION OF GENTLE AND SO     
BECAUSE I THINK HAVING A BLOCK  
A FOUR BLOCK THE BLOCK THAT I'M

BECAUSE I THINK HAVING A BLOCK  
A FOUR BLOCK THE BLOCK THAT I'M 
ON ON STYLE CHURCH FULL OF TOWN 

03:59:35.524 --> 03:59:36.356
A FOUR BLOCK THE BLOCK THAT I'M 
ON ON STYLE CHURCH FULL OF TOWN 
HOUSES WOULD BE FINE FOR ME     

03:59:36.358 --> 03:59:39.659
ON ON STYLE CHURCH FULL OF TOWN 
HOUSES WOULD BE FINE FOR ME     
THREE STOREY TOWNHOUSES BECAUSE 

03:59:39.661 --> 03:59:40.494
HOUSES WOULD BE FINE FOR ME     
THREE STOREY TOWNHOUSES BECAUSE 
THEY'RE LIKE THE ROW HOUSES     

03:59:40.496 --> 03:59:41.361
THREE STOREY TOWNHOUSES BECAUSE 
THEY'RE LIKE THE ROW HOUSES     
THAT I GREW UP WITH IN DC THAT  

03:59:41.363 --> 03:59:44.131
THEY'RE LIKE THE ROW HOUSES     
THAT I GREW UP WITH IN DC THAT  
WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS A   

03:59:44.133 --> 03:59:44.931
THAT I GREW UP WITH IN DC THAT  
WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS A   
RESIDENT THAT MADE VERY CLEAR   

03:59:44.933 --> 03:59:48.068
WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS A   
RESIDENT THAT MADE VERY CLEAR   
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS   

03:59:48.070 --> 03:59:48.968
RESIDENT THAT MADE VERY CLEAR   
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS   
WE'VE BUY FROM WHO YOU WOULD    

03:59:48.970 --> 03:59:51.739
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS   
WE'VE BUY FROM WHO YOU WOULD    
SAY THAT'S NOT GENTLE.          

03:59:51.741 --> 03:59:53.106
WE'VE BUY FROM WHO YOU WOULD    
SAY THAT'S NOT GENTLE.          
SO I JUST DON'T THINK WE CAN    

03:59:53.108 --> 03:59:56.243
SAY THAT'S NOT GENTLE.          
SO I JUST DON'T THINK WE CAN    
GET TO AGREEMENT ON GENERAL AND 

03:59:56.245 --> 03:59:57.177
SO I JUST DON'T THINK WE CAN    
GET TO AGREEMENT ON GENERAL AND

A GREAT JUMPING OFF POINT FOR   

04:11:53.461 --> 04:11:55.929
TO ACCOMPLISH I THINK WOULD BE  
A GREAT JUMPING OFF POINT FOR   
US TO START DOING THE ZONING    

04:11:55.931 --> 04:11:56.929
A GREAT JUMPING OFF POINT FOR   
US TO START DOING THE ZONING    
WORK TO FIGURE OUT WITH DEEPER

DIVES WHAT IS IT ABOUT THESE    
EXAMPLES IN EACH ONE OF THOSE   

04:12:00.969 --> 04:12:01.701
DIVES WHAT IS IT ABOUT THESE    
EXAMPLES IN EACH ONE OF THOSE   
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE      

04:12:01.703 --> 04:12:04.203
EXAMPLES IN EACH ONE OF THOSE   
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE      
DOING MORE RESEARCH ABOUT

WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE      
DOING MORE RESEARCH ABOUT       
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF DUPLEXES

DOING MORE RESEARCH ABOUT       
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF DUPLEXES  
ARE THE ONES WE LIKE WERE THE   

04:12:05.640 --> 04:12:11.978
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF DUPLEXES  
ARE THE ONES WE LIKE WERE THE   
ONES WE DON'T                   

04:12:25.659 --> 04:12:27.594
              LIKE WATER        
VERSIONS OF STACK FLATS THAT WE 
LIKE AND DON'T LIKE WHAT OUR

FROM THE MINE WHERE PEOPLE ARE  
SAYING THAT'S A RESIDENTIAL     
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   

04:22:58.292 --> 04:22:58.891
SAYING THAT'S A RESIDENTIAL     
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
THAT'S NOT A MAJOR ARTERY.      

04:22:58.893 --> 04:22:59.558
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
THAT'S NOT A MAJOR ARTERY.      
THERE'S NOT A BUS LINE OUT      

04:22:59.560 --> 04:23:00.159
THAT'S NOT A MAJOR ARTERY.      
THERE'S NOT A BUS LINE OUT      
OF THERE MAKING ALL THESE       

04:23:00.161 --> 04:23:00.959
THERE'S NOT A BUS LINE OUT      
OF THERE MAKING ALL THESE       
ARGUMENTS AND THERE'S MERIT IN  

04:23:00.961 --> 04:23:01.826
OF THERE MAKING ALL THESE

ARGUMENTS AND THERE'S MERIT IN  
THAT IF WE'RE ALREADY SAYING IN 
HERE THAT THIS DISTRICT SELF    

04:23:02.430 --> 04:23:03.128
THAT IF WE'RE ALREADY SAYING IN 
HERE THAT THIS DISTRICT SELF    
REGULATES WHEN ADJACENT TO      

04:23:03.130 --> 04:23:03.929
HERE THAT THIS DISTRICT SELF    
REGULATES WHEN ADJACENT TO      
ESTABLISH RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 

04:23:03.931 --> 04:23:04.663
REGULATES WHEN ADJACENT TO      
ESTABLISH RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
AND WE ARE BACKING IT UP IN THE 

04:23:04.665 --> 04:23:06.198
ESTABLISH RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
AND WE ARE BACKING IT UP IN THE 
HUB AND HUB IS HIGH RISE        

04:23:06.200 --> 04:23:06.999
AND WE ARE BACKING IT UP IN THE 
HUB AND HUB IS HIGH RISE        
THERE'S IT SHOULD TAPER DOWN    

04:23:07.001 --> 04:23:09.334
HUB AND HUB IS HIGH RISE        
THERE'S IT SHOULD TAPER DOWN    
FROM THAT APPROPRIATELY TO      

04:23:09.336 --> 04:23:10.302
THERE'S IT SHOULD TAPER DOWN    
FROM THAT APPROPRIATELY TO      
RESIDENTIAL AND I THINK IT CAN  

04:23:10.304 --> 04:23:13.538
FROM THAT APPROPRIATELY TO      
RESIDENTIAL AND I THINK IT CAN  
WITHOUT CHANGING THE CHARACTER  

04:23:13.540 --> 04:23:13.939
RESIDENTIAL AND I THINK IT CAN  
WITHOUT CHANGING THE CHARACTER  
OF THE DISTRICT.                

04:23:13.941 --> 04:23:16.942
WITHOUT CHANGING THE CHARACTER  
OF THE DISTRICT.                
SO I WANTED TO SAY THAT IT SAYS 

04:23:16.944 --> 04:23:18.076
OF THE DISTRICT.                
SO I WANTED TO SAY THAT IT SAYS 
LOW TO MID RISE I THINK IN THE  

04:23:18.078 --> 04:23:21.080
SO I WANTED TO SAY THAT IT SAYS 
LOW TO MID RISE I THINK IN THE  
TABLE FOR ONE OR TWO BUT ALSO   

04:23:21.082 --> 04:23:22.014
LOW TO MID RISE I THINK IN THE  
TABLE FOR ONE OR TWO BUT ALSO   
SAYS YOU KNOW, IN OTHER PLACES  

04:23:22.016 --> 04:23:22.814
TABLE FOR ONE OR TWO BUT ALSO   
SAYS YOU KNOW, IN OTHER PLACES  
HIGHER INTENSITY USAGE AND      

04:23:22.816 --> 04:23:25.217
SAYS YOU KNOW, IN OTHER PLACES  
HIGHER INTENSITY USAGE AND      
HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING AND      

04:23:25.219 --> 04:23:26.084
HIGHER INTENSITY USAGE AND      
HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING AND      
AGAIN THAT'S NOT REALLY I THINK 

04:23:26.086 --> 04:23:28.921
HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING AND      
AGAIN THAT'S NOT REALLY I THINK 
THE THRUST OF WHAT I'M SAYING   

04:23:28.923 --> 04:23:29.821
AGAIN THAT'S NOT REALLY I THINK 
THE THRUST OF WHAT I'M SAYING   
THE MAIN POINT IS BECAUSE IT    

04:23:29.823 --> 04:23:30.655
THE THRUST OF WHAT I'M SAYING   
THE MAIN POINT IS BECAUSE IT    
BACKS INTO SOME HUB AND BECAUSE 

04:23:30.657 --> 04:23:32.858
THE MAIN POINT IS BECAUSE IT    
BACKS INTO SOME HUB AND BECAUSE 
IT ALSO GOES RIGHT UP AGAINST   

04:23:32.860 --> 04:23:33.658
BACKS INTO SOME HUB AND BECAUSE 
IT ALSO GOES RIGHT UP AGAINST   
SOME HOUSES, I THINK IT'S GOT   

04:23:33.660 --> 04:23:36.695
IT ALSO GOES RIGHT UP AGAINST   
SOME HOUSES, I THINK IT'S GOT   
TO HAVE ITS OK IF IT'S HIGH     

04:23:36.697 --> 04:23:37.396
SOME HOUSES, I THINK IT'S GOT   
TO HAVE ITS OK IF IT'S HIGH     
RISE IN SPOTS BUT IT'S IT'S GOT 

04:23:37.398 --> 04:23:40.532
TO HAVE ITS OK IF IT'S HIGH     
RISE IN SPOTS BUT IT'S IT'S GOT 
TO TAPER AS YOU GET CLOSER TO   

04:23:40.534 --> 04:23:41.066
RISE IN SPOTS BUT IT'S IT'S GOT 
TO TAPER AS YOU GET CLOSER TO   
RESIDENTIAL REALLY.             

04:23:41.068 --> 04:23:41.900
TO TAPER AS YOU GET CLOSER TO   
RESIDENTIAL REALLY.             
AND I THINK THAT SOLVES FOR THE 

04:23:41.902 --> 04:23:44.436
RESIDENTIAL REALLY.             
AND I THINK THAT SOLVES FOR THE 
MILLER OBJECTION BECAUSE THE    

04:23:44.438 --> 04:23:45.070
AND I THINK THAT SOLVES FOR THE 
MILLER OBJECTION BECAUSE THE    
MILLER OBJECTION WE'RE GETTING  

04:23:45.072 --> 04:23:47.739
MILLER OBJECTION BECAUSE THE    
MILLER OBJECTION WE'RE GETTING  
IS THIS IS TOO DENSE FOR US AND 

04:23:47.741 --> 04:23:48.573
MILLER OBJECTION WE'RE GETTING  
IS THIS IS TOO DENSE FOR US AND 
IF THE TAPERING IS RIGHT THEN   

04:23:48.575 --> 04:23:51.243
IS THIS IS TOO DENSE FOR US AND 
IF THE TAPERING IS RIGHT THEN   
THAT SOLVES SOME OF THE         

04:23:51.245 --> 04:23:51.911
IF THE TAPERING IS RIGHT THEN   
THAT SOLVES SOME OF THE         
OBJECTION TO MILLER IS ALSO     

04:23:51.913 --> 04:23:53.011
THAT SOLVES SOME OF THE         
OBJECTION TO MILLER IS ALSO     
THAT THE RIGHT OF WAY IS VERY   

04:23:53.013 --> 04:23:55.981
OBJECTION TO MILLER IS ALSO     
THAT THE RIGHT OF WAY IS VERY   
NARROW AND THAT IT'S THE SAME   

04:23:55.983 --> 04:23:56.682
THAT THE RIGHT OF WAY IS VERY   
NARROW AND THAT IT'S THE SAME   
AS THE PRESIDENT LIKE MANY

BECAUSE SOME TRANSITION BACKS

WE CAN DESIGN A TAPER MECHANISM 
LIKE WE DID IN ONE TO DO THAT

STOREYS WOULD HAVE BEEN         
APPROXIMATE TO THE              
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE AND 

04:29:07.694 --> 04:29:08.627
APPROXIMATE TO THE              
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE AND 
A LOT OF HOUSING GETS BUILT

INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE AND 
A LOT OF HOUSING GETS BUILT

BUT BECAUSE WE'RE SO SPECIAL    

04:29:12.199 --> 04:29:12.798
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE .   
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE SO SPECIAL    
HERE IN MICHIGAN WE DECIDED     

04:29:12.800 --> 04:29:15.400
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE SO SPECIAL    
HERE IN MICHIGAN WE DECIDED     
LET'S KEEP THAT AROUND FIVE

HERE IN MICHIGAN WE DECIDED     
LET'S KEEP THAT AROUND FIVE

LET'S KEEP THAT AROUND FIVE     
STORIES INSTEAD.                
UM, SO THAT WAS THE INTENTION   

04:29:19.807 --> 04:29:23.241
STORIES INSTEAD.                
UM, SO THAT WAS THE INTENTION   
OF IT IS TO AND ALSO TO         

04:29:23.243 --> 04:29:26.779
UM, SO THAT WAS THE INTENTION   
OF IT IS TO AND ALSO TO         
COMMUNICATE A SMALLER SCALE     

04:29:26.781 --> 04:29:27.745
OF IT IS TO AND ALSO TO         
COMMUNICATE A SMALLER SCALE     
OF DEVELOPMENT UM OUT JUST IN   

04:29:27.747 --> 04:29:30.982
COMMUNICATE A SMALLER SCALE     
OF DEVELOPMENT UM OUT JUST IN   
THE WAY I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

04:29:30.984 --> 04:29:32.017
OF DEVELOPMENT UM OUT JUST IN   
THE WAY I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE   

04:29:32.019 --> 04:29:32.684
THE WAY I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE   
COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE       

04:29:32.686 --> 04:29:35.453
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE   
COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE       
OF YEARS IS TALKING A LOT ABOUT 

04:29:35.455 --> 04:29:38.890
COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE       
OF YEARS IS TALKING A LOT ABOUT 
THE DEVELOPMENT ON SOMETHING    

04:29:38.892 --> 04:29:42.928
OF YEARS IS TALKING A LOT ABOUT 
THE DEVELOPMENT ON SOMETHING    
THE YARD AND SIX EIGHTEEN AS    

04:29:42.930 --> 04:29:43.561
THE DEVELOPMENT ON SOMETHING    
THE YARD AND SIX EIGHTEEN AS    
EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES           

04:29:43.563 --> 04:29:47.199
THE YARD AND SIX EIGHTEEN AS    
EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES           
OF DEVELOPMENT TYPOLOGY THAT I  

04:29:47.201 --> 04:29:47.866
EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES           
OF DEVELOPMENT TYPOLOGY THAT I  
THINK WOULD BE REALLY           

04:29:47.868 --> 04:29:48.400
OF DEVELOPMENT TYPOLOGY THAT I  
THINK WOULD BE REALLY           
APPROPRIATE ALONG THESE         

04:29:48.402 --> 04:29:50.101
THINK WOULD BE REALLY           
APPROPRIATE ALONG THESE         
CORRIDORS UM WITHOUT THE        

04:29:50.103 --> 04:29:51.003
APPROPRIATE ALONG THESE         
CORRIDORS UM WITHOUT THE        
SPECIFICITY AS TO HOW FAR IT    

04:29:51.005 --> 04:29:54.706
CORRIDORS UM WITHOUT THE        
SPECIFICITY AS TO HOW FAR IT    
WOULD DROP AS IT GETS CLOSER TO 

04:29:54.708 --> 04:29:55.373
SPECIFICITY AS TO HOW FAR IT    
WOULD DROP AS IT GETS CLOSER TO 
RESIDENTIAL OR WITH WHAT        

04:29:55.375 --> 04:29:58.443
WOULD DROP AS IT GETS CLOSER TO 
RESIDENTIAL OR WITH WHAT        
PROXIMITY WHETHER IT WOULD DROP 

04:29:58.445 --> 04:30:02.180
RESIDENTIAL OR WITH WHAT        
PROXIMITY WHETHER IT WOULD DROP 
BELOW FOUR STORIES AT ALL.      

04:30:02.182 --> 04:30:03.248
PROXIMITY WHETHER IT WOULD DROP 
BELOW FOUR STORIES AT ALL.      
SO I THINK WHAT NOW IS BEING    

04:30:03.250 --> 04:30:06.018
BELOW FOUR STORIES AT ALL.      
SO I THINK WHAT NOW IS BEING    
CONSIDERED IS THAT THIS         

04:30:06.020 --> 04:30:06.752
SO I THINK WHAT NOW IS BEING    
CONSIDERED IS THAT THIS         
DISTRICT IS REALLY MORE         

04:30:06.754 --> 04:30:07.152
CONSIDERED IS THAT THIS         
DISTRICT IS REALLY MORE         
REFERENTIAL.                    

04:30:07.154 --> 04:30:10.755
DISTRICT IS REALLY MORE         
REFERENTIAL.                    
SO IT I GUESS WHAT I'M HEARING  

04:30:10.757 --> 04:30:11.523
REFERENTIAL.                    
SO IT I GUESS WHAT I'M HEARING  
IS THAT IT MIGHT DROP THE THREE 

04:30:11.525 --> 04:30:13.491
SO IT I GUESS WHAT I'M HEARING  
IS THAT IT MIGHT DROP THE THREE 
STORIES WHEN IT GETS CLOSE TO   

04:30:13.493 --> 04:30:14.192
IS THAT IT MIGHT DROP THE THREE 
STORIES WHEN IT GETS CLOSE TO   
RESIDENTIAL AND HAVE THE SAME   

04:30:14.194 --> 04:30:17.596
STORIES WHEN IT GETS CLOSE TO   
RESIDENTIAL AND HAVE THE SAME   
LIMIT AS WHEN IT'S ADJACENT TO  

04:30:17.598 --> 04:30:18.597
RESIDENTIAL AND HAVE THE SAME   
LIMIT AS WHEN IT'S ADJACENT TO  
HUB WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BIT  

04:30:18.599 --> 04:30:21.700
LIMIT AS WHEN IT'S ADJACENT TO  
HUB WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BIT  
DIFFERENT ABOUT HOW WE WERE     

04:30:21.702 --> 04:30:22.434
HUB WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BIT  
DIFFERENT ABOUT HOW WE WERE     
LAYING OUT THAT DISTRICT.       

04:30:22.436 --> 04:30:28.106
DIFFERENT ABOUT HOW WE WERE     
LAYING OUT THAT DISTRICT.       
BUT THAT'S THE PREROGATIVE.     

04:30:28.108 --> 04:30:29.040
LAYING OUT THAT DISTRICT.       
BUT THAT'S THE PREROGATIVE.     
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I       

04:30:29.042 --> 04:30:31.075
BUT THAT'S THE PREROGATIVE.     
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I       
RECALL READING IN THE SOMEWHERE 

04:30:31.077 --> 04:30:31.877
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I       
RECALL READING IN THE SOMEWHERE 
IS THAT THAT YEAH, IT'S         

04:30:31.879 --> 04:30:35.347
RECALL READING IN THE SOMEWHERE 
IS THAT THAT YEAH, IT'S         
ACTUALLY THE END OF THIS        

04:30:35.349 --> 04:30:39.150
IS THAT THAT YEAH, IT'S         
ACTUALLY THE END OF THIS        
CHAPTER THAT THE THE THE WILL   

04:30:39.152 --> 04:30:40.084
ACTUALLY THE END OF THIS        
CHAPTER THAT THE THE THE WILL   
NOW LET ME JUST QUOTE IT        

04:30:40.086 --> 04:30:42.855
CHAPTER THAT THE THE THE WILL   
NOW LET ME JUST QUOTE IT        
BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THERE      

04:30:42.857 --> 04:30:43.722
NOW LET ME JUST QUOTE IT        
BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THERE      
THERE'S A DESIRE FOR SOME       

04:30:43.724 --> 04:30:47.192
BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THERE      
THERE'S A DESIRE FOR SOME       
FLEXIBILITY AROUND WHERE THESE  

04:30:47.194 --> 04:30:47.926
THERE'S A DESIRE FOR SOME       
FLEXIBILITY AROUND WHERE THESE  
WHERE THE BOUNDARIES OF THESE   

04:30:47.928 --> 04:30:55.233
FLEXIBILITY AROUND WHERE THESE  
WHERE THE BOUNDARIES OF THESE   
THINGS ARE AND SO ONE WAY TO TO 

04:30:55.235 --> 04:30:56.368
WHERE THE BOUNDARIES OF THESE   
THINGS ARE AND SO ONE WAY TO TO 
I SHOULD JUST OH GOD I REALLY   

04:30:56.370 --> 04:30:57.636
THINGS ARE AND SO ONE WAY TO TO 
I SHOULD JUST OH GOD I REALLY   
HATE THE WAY SCREEN DOES THAT   

04:30:57.638 --> 04:31:01.539
I SHOULD JUST OH GOD I REALLY   
HATE THE WAY SCREEN DOES THAT   
UM IT IS YEAH.                  

04:31:01.541 --> 04:31:02.407
HATE THE WAY SCREEN DOES THAT   
UM IT IS YEAH.                  
ALLOWING CERTAIN BOUNDARIES TO  

04:31:02.409 --> 04:31:06.411
UM IT IS YEAH.                  
ALLOWING CERTAIN BOUNDARIES TO  
BE FLUID RATHER THAN STRICTLY   

04:31:06.413 --> 04:31:10.282
ALLOWING CERTAIN BOUNDARIES TO  
BE FLUID RATHER THAN STRICTLY   
PRESCRIPTIVE AND SO I SUPPOSE   

04:31:10.284 --> 04:31:12.918
BE FLUID RATHER THAN STRICTLY   
PRESCRIPTIVE AND SO I SUPPOSE   
THAT THE CHANGE THAT            

04:31:12.920 --> 04:31:13.719
PRESCRIPTIVE AND SO I SUPPOSE   
THAT THE CHANGE THAT            
COMMISSIONER ADAMS IS PROPOSING 

04:31:13.721 --> 04:31:17.923
THAT THE CHANGE THAT            
COMMISSIONER ADAMS IS PROPOSING 
WOULD ENABLE GREATER FLUIDITY   

04:31:17.925 --> 04:31:21.359
COMMISSIONER ADAMS IS PROPOSING 
WOULD ENABLE GREATER FLUIDITY   
WHERE TRANSITION MEETS HUB AND  

04:31:21.361 --> 04:31:25.163
WOULD ENABLE GREATER FLUIDITY   
WHERE TRANSITION MEETS HUB AND  
WE MIGHT WANT GREATER FLUIDITY

ACTUALLY.                       

04:48:18.010 --> 04:48:21.144
THAT'S GOING TO BE HARD         
ACTUALLY.                       
BUT THAT THAT DECISION WAS      

04:48:21.146 --> 04:48:21.379
ACTUALLY.                       
BUT THAT THAT DECISION WAS      
MADE.                           

04:48:21.381 --> 04:48:22.079
BUT THAT THAT DECISION WAS      
MADE.                           
YEAH, I THINK SO.               

04:48:22.081 --> 04:48:25.182
MADE.

YEAH, I THINK SO.               
I MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT     
THOSE USERS NOW DO HAVE TO BE   

04:48:27.686 --> 04:48:31.889
I MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT     
THOSE USERS NOW DO HAVE TO BE   
BUILT WITH A STREET WALL AND MY 

04:48:31.891 --> 04:48:32.756
THOSE USERS NOW DO HAVE TO BE   
BUILT WITH A STREET WALL AND MY 
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE ADD   

04:48:32.758 --> 04:48:36.059
BUILT WITH A STREET WALL AND MY 
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE ADD   
INDUSTRIAL TO THE INTENT        

04:48:36.061 --> 04:48:36.894
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE ADD   
INDUSTRIAL TO THE INTENT        
SECTION HERE TO BE A LITTLE BIT 

04:48:36.896 --> 04:48:39.997
INDUSTRIAL TO THE INTENT        
SECTION HERE TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
MORE CLEAR ABOUT THAT NOW WE    

04:48:39.999 --> 04:48:40.798
SECTION HERE TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
MORE CLEAR ABOUT THAT NOW WE    
EXPECT OUR LIGHT INDUSTRIAL TO  

04:48:40.800 --> 04:48:44.134
MORE CLEAR ABOUT THAT NOW WE    
EXPECT OUR LIGHT INDUSTRIAL TO  
BE MEETING THOSE SAME           

04:48:44.136 --> 04:48:44.802
EXPECT OUR LIGHT INDUSTRIAL TO  
BE MEETING THOSE SAME           
INTENTIONS ABOUT WALKABLE NODES 

04:48:44.804 --> 04:48:47.471
BE MEETING THOSE SAME           
INTENTIONS ABOUT WALKABLE NODES 
AND CORRIDORS AND I WOULD ALSO  

04:48:47.473 --> 04:48:51.208
INTENTIONS ABOUT WALKABLE NODES 
AND CORRIDORS AND I WOULD ALSO  
SUGGEST THAT IN THE LAST IF WE  

04:48:51.210 --> 04:48:51.842
AND CORRIDORS AND I WOULD ALSO  
SUGGEST THAT IN THE LAST IF WE  
ALSO CONSIDER ADDING A HIGH     

04:48:51.844 --> 04:48:52.576
SUGGEST THAT IN THE LAST IF WE  
ALSO CONSIDER ADDING A HIGH     
RISE EXAMPLE TO OUR BUILDING    

04:48:52.578 --> 04:48:55.446
ALSO CONSIDER ADDING A HIGH     
RISE EXAMPLE TO OUR BUILDING    
TYPES THE HIGH RISE EXAMPLE I   

04:48:55.448 --> 04:48:58.649
RISE EXAMPLE TO OUR BUILDING    
TYPES THE HIGH RISE EXAMPLE I   
DON'T THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE   

04:48:58.651 --> 04:48:59.616
TYPES THE HIGH RISE EXAMPLE I   
DON'T THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE   
THE STREETBALL CONCEPT THAT I'M 

04:48:59.618 --> 04:49:03.354
DON'T THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE   
THE STREETBALL CONCEPT THAT I'M 
NOT PROPOSING TO CHANGE IT BUT  

04:49:03.356 --> 04:49:04.121
THE STREETBALL CONCEPT THAT I'M 
NOT PROPOSING TO CHANGE IT BUT  
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA WITH      

04:49:04.123 --> 04:49:06.356
NOT PROPOSING TO CHANGE IT BUT  
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA WITH      
COLLAPSING FLECK'S THIS ONE WAS 

04:49:06.358 --> 04:49:07.024
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA WITH      
COLLAPSING FLECK'S THIS ONE WAS 
THAT THIS ONE ACCOMMODATES      

04:49:07.026 --> 04:49:07.424
COLLAPSING FLECK'S THIS ONE WAS 
THAT THIS ONE ACCOMMODATES      
INDUSTRIAL.                     

04:49:07.426 --> 04:49:10.127
THAT THIS ONE ACCOMMODATES      
INDUSTRIAL.                     
IT WASN'T HE WASN'T JUDGMENT

IT WASN'T HE WASN'T JUDGMENT    
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE INDUSTRIAL 

04:49:11.130 --> 04:49:14.398
IT WASN'T HE WASN'T JUDGMENT    
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE INDUSTRIAL 
HISTORY WELL ON THE TABLE THAT  

04:49:14.400 --> 04:49:15.132
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE INDUSTRIAL 
HISTORY WELL ON THE TABLE THAT  
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WE TALKED  

04:49:15.134 --> 04:49:18.335

WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WE TALKED  
ABOUT A STREETWALKING RIGHT BUT 

04:49:18.337 --> 04:49:19.069
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WE TALKED  
ABOUT A STREETWALKING RIGHT BUT 
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A STREET.    

04:49:19.071 --> 04:49:21.372
ABOUT A STREETWALKING RIGHT BUT 
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A STREET.    
SO THERE'S A BIG THERE THOUGH   

04:49:21.374 --> 04:49:25.809
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A STREET.    
SO THERE'S A BIG THERE THOUGH   
I'M OK SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE  

04:49:25.811 --> 04:49:30.014
SO THERE'S A BIG THERE THOUGH   
I'M OK SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE  
OR TWO OR I THINK WE WERE ON AT

I'M OK SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE  
OR TWO OR I THINK WE WERE ON AT 
ONE POINT ONE ONE TO HIGHER

MR. LEONARD WAS THE THE STREET  
THE STREET MALL.                
BUT YOU WERE TRYING TO DESIGN A 

05:08:47.271 --> 05:08:47.937
THE STREET MALL.                
BUT YOU WERE TRYING TO DESIGN A 
STREET WALL WITH THESE HOUSES   

05:08:47.939 --> 05:08:51.273
BUT YOU WERE TRYING TO DESIGN A 
STREET WALL WITH THESE HOUSES   
AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT BRING 

05:08:51.275 --> 05:08:54.577
STREET WALL WITH THESE HOUSES   
AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT BRING 
OUR CHURCH BUILDING CLOSER TO   

05:08:54.579 --> 05:08:55.044
AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT BRING 
OUR CHURCH BUILDING CLOSER TO

05:08:55.046 --> 05:08:56.045
OUR CHURCH BUILDING CLOSER TO   
THE SIDEWALK?                   
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE 

05:08:56.047 --> 05:08:58.648
THE SIDEWALK?                   
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE 
IT WOULD BE A MORE ACTIVE USE   

05:08:58.650 --> 05:08:59.382
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE 
IT WOULD BE A MORE ACTIVE USE   
BUT WE HAD THESE SETBACKS FROM  

05:08:59.384 --> 05:09:02.819
IT WOULD BE A MORE ACTIVE USE   
BUT WE HAD THESE SETBACKS FROM

STARS ARE NOT THE SAME AS THEIR 

05:15:57.969 --> 05:15:58.767
BECAUSE THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH  
STARS ARE NOT THE SAME AS THEIR 
EXPERIENCES WITH HOTELS, STARS  

05:15:58.769 --> 05:16:02.638
STARS ARE NOT THE SAME AS THEIR 
EXPERIENCES WITH HOTELS, STARS  
CAN BE PARTY HOUSES.

EXPERIENCES WITH HOTELS, STARS  
CAN BE PARTY HOUSES.            
YOU KNOW ONE GETS A FAIR NUMBER

CAN BE PARTY HOUSES.            
YOU KNOW ONE GETS A FAIR NUMBER

DENSITY INCREASING HOUSING.     
AND SO TO YOU IF IF YOU LET     
THEM USE DISASTERS THAT'S HOW   

05:17:15.813 --> 05:17:16.712
AND SO TO YOU IF IF YOU LET     
THEM USE DISASTERS THAT'S HOW   
THEY WILL BE USED AND SO THEY   

05:17:16.714 --> 05:17:20.049
THEM USE DISASTERS THAT'S HOW   
THEY WILL BE USED AND SO THEY   
WOULD NEVER BE SOMEONE'S, YOU   

05:17:20.051 --> 05:17:20.883
THEY WILL BE USED AND SO THEY   
WOULD NEVER BE SOMEONE'S, YOU

OR WHATEVER.                    
AND SO I THINK THAT SAME LOGIC  

05:17:24.421 --> 05:17:27.923
OR WHATEVER.                    
AND SO I THINK THAT SAME LOGIC  
I CAN I CAN SEE THAT SAME LOGIC 

05:17:27.925 --> 05:17:32.128
AND SO I THINK THAT SAME LOGIC  
I CAN I CAN SEE THAT SAME LOGIC 
APPLIED HERE THAT THE STAR IS A 

05:17:32.130 --> 05:17:34.830
I CAN I CAN SEE THAT SAME LOGIC 
APPLIED HERE THAT THE STAR IS A 
REALLY IT'S A VERY SEDUCTIVE    

05:17:34.832 --> 05:17:35.131
APPLIED HERE THAT THE STAR IS A 
REALLY IT'S A VERY SEDUCTIVE    
USE.                            

05:17:35.133 --> 05:17:38.600
REALLY IT'S A VERY SEDUCTIVE    
USE.                            
IT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY PRIVATE 

05:17:38.602 --> 05:17:39.602
USE.                            
IT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY PRIVATE 
INTENSIVE USE AND IT WOULD IT

IT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY PRIVATE 
INTENSIVE USE AND IT WOULD IT   
COULD TAKE OVER AND IT WOULD BE 

05:17:43.207 --> 05:17:43.906
INTENSIVE USE AND IT WOULD IT   
COULD TAKE OVER AND IT WOULD BE 
I THINK IT WOULD BE UPSETTING   

05:17:43.908 --> 05:17:44.774
COULD TAKE OVER AND IT WOULD BE 
I THINK IT WOULD BE UPSETTING   
TO MANY PEOPLE IF I WERE IN     

05:17:44.776 --> 05:17:47.075
I THINK IT WOULD BE UPSETTING   
TO MANY PEOPLE IF I WERE IN     
TRANSITION DISTRICTS DIDN'T     

05:17:47.077 --> 05:17:50.946

TRANSITION DISTRICTS DIDN'T     
ACCOMPLISH GREATER MULTI-FAMILY 

05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:51.747
TRANSITION DISTRICTS DIDN'T

05:17:54.819 --> 05:17:57.719
LOUDER PARTIES ON THE WEEKENDS  
AND MORE POSSIBILITIES FOR THAT 
AND BEING REALLY, YOU KNOW,     

05:17:57.721 --> 05:17:58.120
AND MORE POSSIBILITIES FOR THAT 
AND BEING REALLY, YOU KNOW,     
GRAPHIC.

AND BEING REALLY, YOU KNOW,     
GRAPHIC.                        
BUT IT'S WHAT I HEARD FROM SOME 

05:18:01.926 --> 05:18:02.791

BUT IT'S WHAT I HEARD FROM SOME 
COMMENTARY AND I FEEL LIKE I    

05:18:02.793 --> 05:18:07.929

NEED TO BRING IT.               

05:18:07.931 --> 05:18:12.367
COMMENTARY AND I FEEL LIKE I    
NEED TO BRING IT.
