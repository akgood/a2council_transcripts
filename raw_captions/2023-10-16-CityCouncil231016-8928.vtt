01:46:22.639 --> 01:46:23.372
CORE.                           
SO THERE&apos;S NOT REALLY AN        
ITERATION OF DEVELOPMENT ON     

01:46:23.374 --> 01:46:25.573
SO THERE&apos;S NOT REALLY AN

BALANCE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AND 

01:46:34.818 --> 01:46:38.019
SORT OF UNDERSTAND HOW TO       
BALANCE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AND 
IT COULD BE THAT GETTING CASH   

01:46:38.021 --> 01:46:42.457
BALANCE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AND 
IT COULD BE THAT GETTING CASH   
PAYMENT TO USE IN OTHER PARTS   

01:46:42.459 --> 01:46:43.191
IT COULD BE THAT GETTING CASH   
PAYMENT TO USE IN OTHER PARTS   
OF THE CITY MIGHT NET US OUT    

01:46:43.193 --> 01:46:46.194
PAYMENT TO USE IN OTHER PARTS   
OF THE CITY MIGHT NET US OUT
