WE&apos;RE AS THIS THIS NEW FACILITY 
MAY NOT GENERATE ADDITIONAL     
TRIPS AND THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT  

00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:06.304
MAY NOT GENERATE ADDITIONAL     
TRIPS AND THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT  
BE DELIBERATELY LEAVING THEIR   

00:44:06.306 --> 00:44:08.239
TRIPS AND THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT  
BE DELIBERATELY LEAVING THEIR   
HOMES TO COME TO IT.            

00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:11.975
BE DELIBERATELY LEAVING THEIR   
HOMES TO COME TO IT.            
IT IS GOING TO CREATE MORE      

00:44:11.977 --> 00:44:12.743
HOMES TO COME TO IT.            
IT IS GOING TO CREATE MORE      
TRAFFIC AS PEOPLE DRIVE BY AND  

00:44:12.745 --> 00:44:15.947
IT IS GOING TO CREATE MORE      
TRAFFIC AS PEOPLE DRIVE BY AND

REGARD TO THE TRAFFIC.          
SO COMMISSIONER DID SHE DID     
MENTION LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT AT 

00:45:19.879 --> 00:45:23.481
SO COMMISSIONER DID SHE DID     
MENTION LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT AT 
THE FIRST MEETING FOR THIS THAT 

00:45:23.483 --> 00:45:26.918
MENTION LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT AT 
THE FIRST MEETING FOR THIS THAT 
PART OF THE EVALUATION OF THE   

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.785
THE FIRST MEETING FOR THIS THAT 
PART OF THE EVALUATION OF THE   
TRIP GENERATION FOR THIS TYPE   

00:45:27.787 --> 00:45:28.452
PART OF THE EVALUATION OF THE   
TRIP GENERATION FOR THIS TYPE   
OF USE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE     

00:45:28.454 --> 00:45:31.488
TRIP GENERATION FOR THIS TYPE   
OF USE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE     
FACT THAT THERE ARE PASSERSBY   

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:35.059
OF USE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE     
FACT THAT THERE ARE PASSERSBY   
TRIPS THAT GENERATED WHERE IT&apos;S 

00:45:35.061 --> 00:45:35.893
FACT THAT THERE ARE PASSERSBY   
TRIPS THAT GENERATED WHERE IT&apos;S 
NOT THE ORIGINAL DESTINATION    

00:45:35.895 --> 00:45:39.497
TRIPS THAT GENERATED WHERE IT&apos;S 
NOT THE ORIGINAL DESTINATION    
AND AND I APOLOGIZE I DON&apos;T     

00:45:39.499 --> 00:45:42.833
NOT THE ORIGINAL DESTINATION    
AND AND I APOLOGIZE I DON&apos;T     
HAVE THE THE REVISED TRAFFIC    

00:45:42.835 --> 00:45:43.768
AND AND I APOLOGIZE I DON&apos;T     
HAVE THE THE REVISED TRAFFIC    
IMPACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME.  

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.070
HAVE THE THE REVISED TRAFFIC    
IMPACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME.  
BUT IF I&apos;M RECALLING CORRECTLY  

00:45:46.072 --> 00:45:46.804
IMPACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME.  
BUT IF I&apos;M RECALLING CORRECTLY  
THOSE GENERATION NUMBERS DID    

00:45:46.806 --> 00:45:51.041
BUT IF I&apos;M RECALLING CORRECTLY  
THOSE GENERATION NUMBERS DID    
GET REDUCED WITH THE            

00:45:51.043 --> 00:45:53.811
THOSE GENERATION NUMBERS DID    
GET REDUCED WITH THE            
ELIMINATION OF THE DRIVE        

00:45:53.813 --> 00:45:57.647
GET REDUCED WITH THE            
ELIMINATION OF THE DRIVE        
THROUGH AND I THINK AT THE THE  

00:45:57.649 --> 00:45:58.448
ELIMINATION OF THE DRIVE        
THROUGH AND I THINK AT THE THE  
INITIAL ONSET OF THIS PROJECT   

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:02.520
THROUGH AND I THINK AT THE THE  
INITIAL ONSET OF THIS PROJECT   
OUR POSITION AND THE FINDINGS   

00:46:02.522 --> 00:46:08.959
INITIAL ONSET OF THIS PROJECT   
OUR POSITION AND THE FINDINGS   
FROM OUR TRAFFIC TEAM WAS       

00:46:22.841 --> 00:46:25.108
                          THAT  
THE LEVEL OF SERVICE OF PRAIRIE 
STREET WOULDN&apos;T BE DEGRADED AS  

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:25.842
THE LEVEL OF SERVICE OF PRAIRIE 
STREET WOULDN&apos;T BE DEGRADED AS  
A RESULT OF THE PROJECT WITH    

00:46:25.844 --> 00:46:26.544
STREET WOULDN&apos;T BE DEGRADED AS  
A RESULT OF THE PROJECT WITH    
THE DRIVE THROUGH AND COME TO   

00:46:26.546 --> 00:46:27.244
A RESULT OF THE PROJECT WITH    
THE DRIVE THROUGH AND COME TO   
THE SAME FINDINGS WITH THE      

00:46:27.246 --> 00:46:27.845
THE DRIVE THROUGH AND COME TO   
THE SAME FINDINGS WITH THE      
ELIMINATION OF THE DRIVE        

00:46:27.847 --> 00:46:28.645
THE SAME FINDINGS WITH THE      
ELIMINATION OF THE DRIVE        
THROUGH AND EVEN MORE SO AND    

00:46:28.647 --> 00:46:29.347
ELIMINATION OF THE DRIVE        
THROUGH AND EVEN MORE SO AND    
THAT&apos;S WITH COMPARISON OF THE   

00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:30.181
THROUGH AND EVEN MORE SO AND    
THAT&apos;S WITH COMPARISON OF THE   
EXISTING USE TO WHAT&apos;S PROPOSED 

00:46:30.183 --> 00:46:31.048
THAT&apos;S WITH COMPARISON OF THE   
EXISTING USE TO WHAT&apos;S PROPOSED 
NOW I THINK I&apos;LL HAND IT OVER   

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.316
EXISTING USE TO WHAT&apos;S PROPOSED 
NOW I THINK I&apos;LL HAND IT OVER   
TO MR. PHILLIPS FOR DISCUSSION  

00:46:33.318 --> 00:46:36.286
NOW I THINK I&apos;LL HAND IT OVER   
TO MR. PHILLIPS FOR DISCUSSION  
ON THE GENERATOR.               

00:46:36.288 --> 00:46:39.924
TO MR. PHILLIPS FOR DISCUSSION  
ON THE GENERATOR.               
GOOD EVENING.                   

00:46:39.926 --> 00:46:41.025
ON THE GENERATOR.               
GOOD EVENING.                   
WE TYPICALLY THE TWO SOURCES    

00:46:41.027 --> 00:46:43.994
GOOD EVENING.                   
WE TYPICALLY THE TWO SOURCES    
OF FUEL FOR GENERATORS ARE      

00:46:43.996 --> 00:46:44.761
WE TYPICALLY THE TWO SOURCES    
OF FUEL FOR GENERATORS ARE      
DIESEL AND NATURAL GAS WITH     

00:46:44.763 --> 00:46:48.198
OF FUEL FOR GENERATORS ARE      
DIESEL AND NATURAL GAS WITH     
DIESEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE      

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.768
DIESEL AND NATURAL GAS WITH     
DIESEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE      
WORSE IN TERMS OF BEING A FUEL  

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:52.870
DIESEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE      
WORSE IN TERMS OF BEING A FUEL  
THAT HAS OIL AS A COMPONENT     

00:46:52.872 --> 00:46:55.105
WORSE IN TERMS OF BEING A FUEL  
THAT HAS OIL AS A COMPONENT     
OF IT.                          

00:46:55.107 --> 00:46:56.273
THAT HAS OIL AS A COMPONENT     
OF IT.                          
THE PROPANE IS A IS A DIFFERENT 

00:46:56.275 --> 00:46:58.909
OF IT.                          
THE PROPANE IS A IS A DIFFERENT 
TECHNOLOGY THAT THE GENERATOR   

00:46:58.911 --> 00:46:59.743
THE PROPANE IS A IS A DIFFERENT 
TECHNOLOGY THAT THE GENERATOR   
REALLY IS DETERMINED BY THE     

00:46:59.745 --> 00:47:00.411
TECHNOLOGY THAT THE GENERATOR   
REALLY IS DETERMINED BY THE     
SIZE AND TYPE OF GENERATOR      

00:47:00.413 --> 00:47:03.447
REALLY IS DETERMINED BY THE     
SIZE AND TYPE OF GENERATOR      
GENERATORS DETERMINED BY IT TO  

00:47:03.449 --> 00:47:04.215
SIZE AND TYPE OF GENERATOR      
GENERATORS DETERMINED BY IT TO  
USE IN WHAT IT&apos;S GOING TO BACK  

00:47:04.217 --> 00:47:07.184
GENERATORS DETERMINED BY IT TO  
USE IN WHAT IT&apos;S GOING TO BACK  
UP IN THIS CASE THE CREDIT      

00:47:07.186 --> 00:47:11.388
USE IN WHAT IT&apos;S GOING TO BACK  
UP IN THIS CASE THE CREDIT      
UNION HAS REMAINED IN OPERATION 

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:14.691
UP IN THIS CASE THE CREDIT      
UNION HAS REMAINED IN OPERATION 
THROUGH A POWER OUTAGE SO THAT  

00:47:14.693 --> 00:47:15.525
UNION HAS REMAINED IN OPERATION 
THROUGH A POWER OUTAGE SO THAT  
OPERATING THE BUILDING IMPLIES  

00:47:15.527 --> 00:47:15.859
THROUGH A POWER OUTAGE SO THAT  
OPERATING THE BUILDING IMPLIES  
A LOAD.                         

00:47:15.861 --> 00:47:19.530
OPERATING THE BUILDING IMPLIES  
A LOAD.                         
IN FACT, MAKING THE BUILDING    

00:47:19.532 --> 00:47:20.397
A LOAD.                         
IN FACT, MAKING THE BUILDING    
ALL ELECTRIC CAN EVEN INCREASE  

00:47:20.399 --> 00:47:23.033
IN FACT, MAKING THE BUILDING    
ALL ELECTRIC CAN EVEN INCREASE  
THAT LOAD TO SOME EXTENT.       

00:47:23.035 --> 00:47:24.167
ALL ELECTRIC CAN EVEN INCREASE  
THAT LOAD TO SOME EXTENT.       
SO THAT&apos;S GOING TO DRIVE THE    

00:47:24.169 --> 00:47:26.837
THAT LOAD TO SOME EXTENT.       
SO THAT&apos;S GOING TO DRIVE THE    
TYPE OF GENERATOR IT IS AND     

00:47:26.839 --> 00:47:27.838
SO THAT&apos;S GOING TO DRIVE THE    
TYPE OF GENERATOR IT IS AND     
PROPANE IS NOT A COMMON IN OUR  

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.141
TYPE OF GENERATOR IT IS AND     
PROPANE IS NOT A COMMON IN OUR  
EXPERIENCE GENERATOR FUEL BUT   

00:47:31.143 --> 00:47:31.909
PROPANE IS NOT A COMMON IN OUR  
EXPERIENCE GENERATOR FUEL BUT   
THAT&apos;S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT 

00:47:31.911 --> 00:47:35.079
EXPERIENCE GENERATOR FUEL BUT   
THAT&apos;S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT 
AND BATTERIES ARE FRANKLY QUITE 

00:47:35.081 --> 00:47:36.080
THAT&apos;S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT 
AND BATTERIES ARE FRANKLY QUITE 
NEW AND SO THAT THEY HAVE TO BE 

00:47:36.082 --> 00:47:38.448
AND BATTERIES ARE FRANKLY QUITE 
NEW AND SO THAT THEY HAVE TO BE 
LOOKED AT IN THE SCALE OF THE   

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:39.283
NEW AND SO THAT THEY HAVE TO BE 
LOOKED AT IN THE SCALE OF THE   
POWER THEY NEEDED TO PROVIDE.   

00:47:39.285 --> 00:47:42.319
LOOKED AT IN THE SCALE OF THE   
POWER THEY NEEDED TO PROVIDE.   
SO THOSE THINGS GOING FORWARD   

00:47:42.321 --> 00:47:43.153
POWER THEY NEEDED TO PROVIDE.   
SO THOSE THINGS GOING FORWARD   
WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT BUT WE     

00:47:43.155 --> 00:47:44.688
SO THOSE THINGS GOING FORWARD   
WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT BUT WE     
HAVEN&apos;T GOTTEN INTO ENGINEERING 

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:51.228
WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT BUT WE     
HAVEN&apos;T GOTTEN INTO ENGINEERING 
YET AT THIS POINT               

00:47:52.698 --> 00:47:58.302
                 .              
I TO ANSWER THAT THIRD QUESTION 
AS FAR AS USE ON THE ADJACENT   

00:47:58.304 --> 00:48:00.905
I TO ANSWER THAT THIRD QUESTION 
AS FAR AS USE ON THE ADJACENT   
PARCEL WE DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC  

00:48:00.907 --> 00:48:04.008
AS FAR AS USE ON THE ADJACENT   
PARCEL WE DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC  
PLANS FOR THAT.                 

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.208
PARCEL WE DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC  
PLANS FOR THAT.                 
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO MAKE IT THROUGH 

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.943
PLANS FOR THAT.                 
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO MAKE IT THROUGH 
PHASE ONE OF THE PROJECT BEFORE 

00:48:05.945 --> 00:48:08.746
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO MAKE IT THROUGH 
PHASE ONE OF THE PROJECT BEFORE 
DETERMINING WHAT THE USE        

00:48:08.748 --> 00:48:09.347
PHASE ONE OF THE PROJECT BEFORE 
DETERMINING WHAT THE USE        
OF THAT PARCEL WOULD BE.        

00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:12.016
DETERMINING WHAT THE USE        
OF THAT PARCEL WOULD BE.        
BUT OF COURSE WHATEVER ZONING   

00:48:12.018 --> 00:48:13.050
OF THAT PARCEL WOULD BE.        
BUT OF COURSE WHATEVER ZONING   
IS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME THAT   

00:48:13.052 --> 00:48:15.986
BUT OF COURSE WHATEVER ZONING   
IS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME THAT   
WE DID, WE WOULD CERTAINLY      

00:48:15.988 --> 00:48:16.920
IS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME THAT   
WE DID, WE WOULD CERTAINLY      
CONSIDER THAT AS WE WERE TO     

00:48:16.922 --> 00:48:23.227
WE DID, WE WOULD CERTAINLY      
CONSIDER THAT AS WE WERE TO     
MOVE FORWARD SO                 

00:48:26.732 --> 00:48:33.771

00:52:13.259 --> 00:52:16.427
CONVERSATION THAT WE&apos;RE         
CURRENTLY IN.                   
SO OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT     

00:52:16.429 --> 00:52:17.527
CURRENTLY IN.                   
SO OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT     
YOU&apos;RE CURRENT AND I SAY THIS   

00:52:17.529 --> 00:52:20.831
SO OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT     
YOU&apos;RE CURRENT AND I SAY THIS   
CORRECTLY DESIGN TEAM DOESN&apos;T   

00:52:20.833 --> 00:52:24.268
YOU&apos;RE CURRENT AND I SAY THIS   
CORRECTLY DESIGN TEAM DOESN&apos;T   
HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH US         

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:25.069
CORRECTLY DESIGN TEAM DOESN&apos;T

TECHNOLOGY IS ANOTHER REASON    

00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:28.872
HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH US         
TECHNOLOGY IS ANOTHER REASON    
WHY WE&apos;RE NOT MOVING TO A       

00:52:28.874 --> 00:52:32.175
TECHNOLOGY IS ANOTHER REASON    
WHY WE&apos;RE NOT MOVING TO A       
COMPLETELY SUSTAINABLE MODEL    

00:52:32.177 --> 00:52:33.143
WHY WE&apos;RE NOT MOVING TO A       
COMPLETELY SUSTAINABLE MODEL    
FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE I  

00:52:33.145 --> 00:52:36.413
COMPLETELY SUSTAINABLE MODEL    
FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE I  
THINK WHAT I HEARD FROM IBM     

00:52:36.415 --> 00:52:40.984
FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE I  
THINK WHAT I HEARD FROM IBM     
BLACK WAS THAT IT IS A NEW      

00:52:40.986 --> 00:52:44.087
THINK WHAT I HEARD FROM IBM     
BLACK WAS THAT IT IS A NEW      
PROGRAM AND A NEW TIME HERE AND 

00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.755
BLACK WAS THAT IT IS A NEW      
PROGRAM AND A NEW TIME HERE AND 
WE DON&apos;T HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH   

00:52:44.757 --> 00:52:47.825
PROGRAM AND A NEW TIME HERE AND 
WE DON&apos;T HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH   
IT SO WE DON&apos;T KNOW HOW TO DO   

00:52:47.827 --> 00:52:51.695
WE DON&apos;T HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH   
IT SO WE DON&apos;T KNOW HOW TO DO   
THE THING THAT WE WOULD LATER   

00:52:51.697 --> 00:52:52.363
IT SO WE DON&apos;T KNOW HOW TO DO   
THE THING THAT WE WOULD LATER   
CONSIDER SO AND YOU CAN         

00:52:52.365 --> 00:52:55.665
THE THING THAT WE WOULD LATER   
CONSIDER SO AND YOU CAN         
DISABUSE THEM BUT YEAH, I       

00:52:55.667 --> 00:52:58.268
CONSIDER SO AND YOU CAN         
DISABUSE THEM BUT YEAH, I       
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT THAT         

00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:59.269
DISABUSE THEM BUT YEAH, I       
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT THAT         
IMPLICATION AND NOT AT ALL WHAT 

00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:02.672
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT THAT         
IMPLICATION AND NOT AT ALL WHAT 
WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WAS     

00:53:02.674 --> 00:53:06.710
IMPLICATION AND NOT AT ALL WHAT 
WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WAS     
PAST EXPERIENCE SO AS YOU KNOW, 

00:53:06.712 --> 00:53:07.444
WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WAS     
PAST EXPERIENCE SO AS YOU KNOW, 
CONSTRUCTION IS A LENGTHY       

00:53:07.446 --> 00:53:10.581
PAST EXPERIENCE SO AS YOU KNOW, 
CONSTRUCTION IS A LENGTHY       
PROCESS AND SO PROJECTS ARE     

00:53:10.583 --> 00:53:11.314
CONSTRUCTION IS A LENGTHY

ACCESSORY STRUCTURE AND THAT&apos;S  
TRICKY TO DO.                   
SO THAT&apos;S                       

01:17:30.273 --> 01:17:32.074
          BUT THAT&apos;S NOT THE    
ONLY ONE THAT&apos;S BEEN HERE FOR A

BELIEVE THAT THE SOLAR          
READINESS JUST HAS TO HAVE SOME

TO ADVANCE TO THE CITY COUNCIL. 

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.279
LANGUAGE AND MATERIALS PREPARED

HIJACK THE PRESENTATION I THINK 

01:41:14.363 --> 01:41:16.964
INTERRUPT THE PRESENTATION OR   
HIJACK THE PRESENTATION I THINK 
DEFEATS THE POINT OF WHAT WE    

01:41:16.966 --> 01:41:17.698
HIJACK THE PRESENTATION I THINK 
DEFEATS THE POINT OF WHAT WE    
ARE TRYING TO CONVEY.           

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:18.799
DEFEATS THE POINT OF WHAT WE    
ARE TRYING TO CONVEY.           
AND SO I WONDER IF THERE&apos;S A    

01:41:18.801 --> 01:41:21.535

AND SO I WONDER IF THERE&apos;S A    
DIFFERENT WAY WE CAN PRESENT    

01:41:21.537 --> 01:41:22.402

DIFFERENT WAY WE CAN PRESENT    
THE INFORMATION WHETHER IT&apos;S AT 

01:41:22.404 --> 01:41:25.473

01:41:28.811 --> 01:41:29.810
TABLES WHERE WE WOULD HAVE      
STAFF AT TABLES TALKING ABOUT   
THE IMPACT AND THEN PEOPLE CAN  

01:41:29.812 --> 01:41:32.646
STAFF AT TABLES TALKING ABOUT   
THE IMPACT AND THEN PEOPLE CAN  
MOVE LIKE A DIRECT PROCESS      

01:41:32.648 --> 01:41:33.614
THE IMPACT AND THEN PEOPLE CAN  
MOVE LIKE A DIRECT PROCESS      
WHERE THEY CAN MOVE FROM ONE    

01:41:33.616 --> 01:41:34.281
MOVE LIKE A DIRECT PROCESS      
WHERE THEY CAN MOVE FROM ONE
