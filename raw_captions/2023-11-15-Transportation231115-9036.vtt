BASICALLY ANY CURB SESSION THAT 
OCCURRED IN THESE LOCATIONS.    
WE SAW IT AND RECORDED IT SO    

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.914
OCCURRED IN THESE LOCATIONS.    
WE SAW IT AND RECORDED IT SO    
MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS AND OUR 

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:41.785
WE SAW IT AND RECORDED IT SO    
MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS AND OUR 
OVERALL FINDINGS IS THAT THAT   

00:28:41.787 --> 00:28:44.955
MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS AND OUR 
OVERALL FINDINGS IS THAT THAT   
PARKING METERS ARE WHEN THE     

00:28:44.957 --> 00:28:48.425
OVERALL FINDINGS IS THAT THAT   
PARKING METERS ARE WHEN THE     
METERS ARE HIGHLY UTILIZED      

00:28:48.427 --> 00:28:49.526
PARKING METERS ARE WHEN THE     
METERS ARE HIGHLY UTILIZED      
DURING TIMES WHERE THERE IS NO

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:52.729
DURING TIMES WHERE THERE IS NO  
ENFORCEMENT OCCURRING.          
&gt;&gt; SO THAT&apos;S CHALLENGING        

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:53.596
ENFORCEMENT OCCURRING.          
&gt;&gt; SO THAT&apos;S CHALLENGING        
BECAUSE YOU&apos;RE NOT ABLE TO      

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:56.733
&gt;&gt; SO THAT&apos;S CHALLENGING        
BECAUSE YOU&apos;RE NOT ABLE TO      
MANAGE THOSE PEAK TIMES.        

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:57.667
BECAUSE YOU&apos;RE NOT ABLE TO      
MANAGE THOSE PEAK TIMES.        
MOST KIRP SESSIONS ARE LESS     

00:28:57.669 --> 00:29:00.937
MANAGE THOSE PEAK TIMES.        
MOST KIRP SESSIONS ARE LESS     
THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES ACTUALLY   

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:01.739
MOST KIRP SESSIONS ARE LESS     
THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES ACTUALLY   
MANY ARE LESS THAN EVEN FIVE

THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES ACTUALLY   
MANY ARE LESS THAN EVEN FIVE    
MINUTES.                        

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.242
MANY ARE LESS THAN EVEN FIVE    
MINUTES.                        
SO THAT&apos;S DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE  

00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:05.909
MINUTES.                        
SO THAT&apos;S DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE  
AND WE SEE THAT CHALLENGE       

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:08.712
SO THAT&apos;S DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE  
AND WE SEE THAT CHALLENGE       
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.             

00:29:08.714 --> 00:29:09.713
AND WE SEE THAT CHALLENGE       
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.             
THE SHORT TERM PARKERS ARE      

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:12.750
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.             
THE SHORT TERM PARKERS ARE      
PARKING ANYWHERE THEY&apos;RE        

00:29:12.752 --> 00:29:13.550
THE SHORT TERM PARKERS ARE      
PARKING ANYWHERE THEY&apos;RE        
PARKING IN NO PARKING ZONES,    

00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:16.686
PARKING ANYWHERE THEY&apos;RE        
PARKING IN NO PARKING ZONES,    
CROSSWALKS ANYWHERE THEY CAN    

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:17.621
PARKING IN NO PARKING ZONES,    
CROSSWALKS ANYWHERE THEY CAN    
FIND A SPACE BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE    

00:29:17.623 --> 00:29:20.157
CROSSWALKS ANYWHERE THEY CAN    
FIND A SPACE BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE    
THINKING WELL IT&apos;S SHORT TERM   

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:21.091
FIND A SPACE BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE    
THINKING WELL IT&apos;S SHORT TERM   
WE CAN GET IN AND OUT QUICKLY   

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:24.795
THINKING WELL IT&apos;S SHORT TERM   
WE CAN GET IN AND OUT QUICKLY   
AND AVOID A CITATION.           

00:29:24.797 --> 00:29:25.863
WE CAN GET IN AND OUT QUICKLY

BUT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT     

00:29:25.865 --> 00:29:26.463
AND AVOID A CITATION.           
BUT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT     
AMOUNT OF CURB VIOLATIONS.      

00:29:26.465 --> 00:29:29.432
BUT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT     
AMOUNT OF CURB VIOLATIONS.      
SO ON THIS SIDE YOU SEE IN THE  

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:30.067
AMOUNT OF CURB VIOLATIONS.      
SO ON THIS SIDE YOU SEE IN THE  
SOUTH UNIVERSITY STUDY AREA     

00:29:30.069 --> 00:29:33.103
SO ON THIS SIDE YOU SEE IN THE  
SOUTH UNIVERSITY STUDY AREA     
ABOUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF ALL  

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:33.771
SOUTH UNIVERSITY STUDY AREA     
ABOUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF ALL  
THE CURB SESSIONS OCCURRING     

00:29:33.773 --> 00:29:36.873
ABOUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF ALL  
THE CURB SESSIONS OCCURRING     
WERE VIOLATIONS.                

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:37.974
THE CURB SESSIONS OCCURRING     
WERE VIOLATIONS.                
SO THIS IS PARKING IN FRONT     

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:40.577
WERE VIOLATIONS.                
SO THIS IS PARKING IN FRONT     
OF A DRIVEWAY IN A NO PARKING   

00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:41.044
SO THIS IS PARKING IN FRONT     
OF A DRIVEWAY IN A NO PARKING   
ON A BIKE.                      

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:45.082
OF A DRIVEWAY IN A NO PARKING   
ON A BIKE.                      
WELL A CROSSWALK AND THE MEDIAN 

00:29:45.084 --> 00:29:45.816
ON A BIKE.                      
WELL A CROSSWALK AND THE MEDIAN 
DURATION OF THOSE VIOLATIONS    

00:29:45.818 --> 00:29:48.885
WELL A CROSSWALK AND THE MEDIAN 
DURATION OF THOSE VIOLATIONS    
WAS FOUR MINUTES.               

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:49.820
DURATION OF THOSE VIOLATIONS    
WAS FOUR MINUTES.               
SO AGAIN, HARD TO ENFORCE BUT   

00:29:49.822 --> 00:29:52.589
WAS FOUR MINUTES.               
SO AGAIN, HARD TO ENFORCE BUT   
THIS YOU KNOW, THIS IS ABOUT    

00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:53.490
SO AGAIN, HARD TO ENFORCE BUT   
THIS YOU KNOW, THIS IS ABOUT    
CURB VIOLATIONS A DAY AND THIS  

00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:54.191
THIS YOU KNOW, THIS IS ABOUT    
CURB VIOLATIONS A DAY AND THIS

THAT&apos;S AN IMPORTANT PART.       
THIS IS JUST WHAT WE&apos;RE SEEING  
IN THE CAMERA DATA AND THEN     

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:04.835
THIS IS JUST WHAT WE&apos;RE SEEING  
IN THE CAMERA DATA AND THEN     
THERE IS A GAP WE LOOKED AT THE 

00:30:04.837 --> 00:30:05.369
IN THE CAMERA DATA AND THEN     
THERE IS A GAP WE LOOKED AT THE 
METER TRANSACTIONS.             

00:30:05.371 --> 00:30:06.170
THERE IS A GAP WE LOOKED AT THE

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.476
THERE&apos;S A GAP BETWEEN THE METER

SO THAT&apos;S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT  

00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:13.477
PAYMENT IN THE ACTUAL USE.      
SO THAT&apos;S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT  
FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN&apos;T PAYING    

00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:15.679
SO THAT&apos;S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

WHAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO  
LOOK AT AND STUDY IN THE        
CIRCULATION STUDY WHICH IS THAT 

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.260
LOOK AT AND STUDY IN THE        
CIRCULATION STUDY WHICH IS THAT 
THERE&apos;S LOTS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS 

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:28.863
CIRCULATION STUDY WHICH IS THAT 
THERE&apos;S LOTS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS 
FOR THINGS THAT NEED TO AND

SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE DOWNTOWN   
ENVIRONMENT.                    
THOSE ARE ALL TRYING TO FIT IN  

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:33.201
ENVIRONMENT.                    
THOSE ARE ALL TRYING TO FIT IN  
THE SAME NARROW RIGHT AWAY

PRIORITY CORRIDORS AND THE      
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT TRANSIT     
NEEDS LOTS OF DISCUSSION AROUND 

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:45.246
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT TRANSIT     
NEEDS LOTS OF DISCUSSION AROUND 
NEW EVENTS STREETS CHANGES      

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:48.983
NEEDS LOTS OF DISCUSSION AROUND

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:53.788
PATTERNS IF THERE&apos;S TO A        
RESTORATION MOVES FORWARD.      
SO HOW THIS ALL SORTS OUT AND   

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:54.556
RESTORATION MOVES FORWARD.      
SO HOW THIS ALL SORTS OUT AND

SO IT&apos;S GREAT TO SEE THAT       

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:01.021
IN THE DOWNTOWN ENVIRONMENT.    
SO IT&apos;S GREAT TO SEE THAT       
PEOPLE ARE USING IT AND THAT    

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:01.689
SO IT&apos;S GREAT TO SEE THAT       
PEOPLE ARE USING IT AND THAT    
LIKE THE SECOND POINT HERE      

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:05.025
PEOPLE ARE USING IT AND THAT    
LIKE THE SECOND POINT HERE      
EIGHTY SIX PERCENT MORE LIKELY

BIKE WAY FOR MANY PEOPLE YOU    
KNOW THIS IS OPENING UP NEW     
WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO GET       

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:13.033
KNOW THIS IS OPENING UP NEW     
WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO GET       
DOWNTOWN MORE EASILY AND I      

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:13.601
WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO GET       
DOWNTOWN MORE EASILY AND I      
THINK PERTINENT FOR THE         

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:14.334
DOWNTOWN MORE EASILY AND I      
THINK PERTINENT FOR THE         
DISCUSSION TONIGHT 80 PERCENT   

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:17.372
THINK PERTINENT FOR THE         
DISCUSSION TONIGHT 80 PERCENT   
WOULD USE A BIKE WAY MORE IF    

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:18.172
DISCUSSION TONIGHT 80 PERCENT   
WOULD USE A BIKE WAY MORE IF    
THERE ARE MORE CONNECTIONS TO   

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:18.873
WOULD USE A BIKE WAY MORE IF    
THERE ARE MORE CONNECTIONS TO   
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT&apos;S SOMETHING  

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:22.876
THERE ARE MORE CONNECTIONS TO   
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT&apos;S SOMETHING  
WILL BE COMING BACK TO.         

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:23.945
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT&apos;S SOMETHING  
WILL BE COMING BACK TO.         
SO WITH THAT I MENTIONED KIND   

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.847
WILL BE COMING BACK TO.         
SO WITH THAT I MENTIONED KIND   
OF THE AGENDA.                  

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:27.782
SO WITH THAT I MENTIONED KIND   
OF THE AGENDA.                  
THERE&apos;S FOUR BIG AREAS OF WORK  

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:31.085
OF THE AGENDA.                  
THERE&apos;S FOUR BIG AREAS OF WORK  
FOR THE CIRCULATION STUDY IN A  

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:32.020
THERE&apos;S FOUR BIG AREAS OF WORK  
FOR THE CIRCULATION STUDY IN A  
FEW SLIDES ON EACH OF THESE SO  

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:34.855
FOR THE CIRCULATION STUDY IN A  
FEW SLIDES ON EACH OF THESE SO  
WE CAN KIND OF TALK THROUGH THE 

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:35.723
FEW SLIDES ON EACH OF THESE SO  
WE CAN KIND OF TALK THROUGH THE 
SET UP THE RATIONALE, SOME      

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:36.524
WE CAN KIND OF TALK THROUGH THE 
SET UP THE RATIONALE, SOME      
OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND THEN  

01:11:36.526 --> 01:11:39.227
SET UP THE RATIONALE, SOME      
OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND THEN  
THE PIECES THAT WILL BE LOOKING 

01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:42.696
OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND THEN  
THE PIECES THAT WILL BE LOOKING 
AT WITHIN EACH OF THESE.        

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:43.897
THE PIECES THAT WILL BE LOOKING 
AT WITHIN EACH OF THESE.        
SO ON THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION 

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:46.233
AT WITHIN EACH OF THESE.        
SO ON THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION 
FRONT THERE&apos;S LOTS OF LANGUAGE  

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:49.704
SO ON THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION 
FRONT THERE&apos;S LOTS OF LANGUAGE  
THAT GETS THROWN AROUND FOR     

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:50.638
FRONT THERE&apos;S LOTS OF LANGUAGE  
THAT GETS THROWN AROUND FOR     
WHAT WE MEAN BY BIKEWAYS AND    

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.371
THAT GETS THROWN AROUND FOR     
WHAT WE MEAN BY BIKEWAYS AND    
SEPARATED BIKE LANES AND ALL    

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:54.008
WHAT WE MEAN BY BIKEWAYS AND    
SEPARATED BIKE LANES AND ALL    
THE OTHER VERBIAGE.             

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:54.942
SEPARATED BIKE LANES AND ALL    
THE OTHER VERBIAGE.             
&gt;&gt; WE&apos;VE BEEN KIND OF THINKING  

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:57.578
THE OTHER VERBIAGE.             
&gt;&gt; WE&apos;VE BEEN KIND OF THINKING  
ABOUT THIS AS A LOW STRESS      

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:58.446
&gt;&gt; WE&apos;VE BEEN KIND OF THINKING  
ABOUT THIS AS A LOW STRESS      
BICYCLE NETWORK AND THERE&apos;S     

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:01.649
ABOUT THIS AS A LOW STRESS      
BICYCLE NETWORK AND THERE&apos;S     
LOTS OF WAYS THAT WE CAN GET AT 

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:01.982
BICYCLE NETWORK AND THERE&apos;S     
LOTS OF WAYS THAT WE CAN GET AT 
THAT.                           

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.016
LOTS OF WAYS THAT WE CAN GET AT 
THAT.                           
BUT THE IDEA IS IS THAT WE&apos;RE   

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:03.751
THAT.                           
BUT THE IDEA IS IS THAT WE&apos;RE   
BUILDING OUT A NETWORK          

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:06.254
BUT THE IDEA IS IS THAT WE&apos;RE   
BUILDING OUT A NETWORK          
OF BICYCLE FACILITIES THAT ARE  

01:12:06.256 --> 01:12:07.021
BUILDING OUT A NETWORK          
OF BICYCLE FACILITIES THAT ARE  
COMFORTABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AND  

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:09.023
OF BICYCLE FACILITIES THAT ARE  
COMFORTABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AND  
OF COURSE SAFE FOR AS MANY      

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:09.824
COMFORTABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AND  
OF COURSE SAFE FOR AS MANY      
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO ENCOURAGE 

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:13.227
OF COURSE SAFE FOR AS MANY      
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO ENCOURAGE 
THAT RIDERSHIP AND SO THE CITY  

01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.961
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO ENCOURAGE 
THAT RIDERSHIP AND SO THE CITY  
IN THE DENHA HAVE MADE SOME     

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:16.931
THAT RIDERSHIP AND SO THE CITY  
IN THE DENHA HAVE MADE SOME     
GREAT PROGRESS BUILDING OUT A   

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:17.732
IN THE DENHA HAVE MADE SOME     
GREAT PROGRESS BUILDING OUT A   
COMPLETE LOOP IN THE DOWNTOWN   

01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:18.432
GREAT PROGRESS BUILDING OUT A

THAT&apos;S WELCOMING TO THAT        
BROADER RANGE OF USERS.         
SO THAT&apos;S CREATING SOME GAPS IN 

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:33.561
BROADER RANGE OF USERS.         
SO THAT&apos;S CREATING SOME GAPS IN 
THE NETWORK.                    

01:15:33.563 --> 01:15:34.295
SO THAT&apos;S CREATING SOME GAPS IN 
THE NETWORK.                    
AND SO THROUGH THIS STUDY WE&apos;LL 

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:37.330
THE NETWORK.                    
AND SO THROUGH THIS STUDY WE&apos;LL 
BE ABLE TO LOOK AT A NUMBER     

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:37.965
AND SO THROUGH THIS STUDY WE&apos;LL 
BE ABLE TO LOOK AT A NUMBER     
OF THESE CONNECTIONS AND KIND   

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:40.801
BE ABLE TO LOOK AT A NUMBER     
OF THESE CONNECTIONS AND KIND   
OF MAJOR CONDUITS INTO DOWNTOWN 

01:15:40.803 --> 01:15:41.835
OF THESE CONNECTIONS AND KIND   
OF MAJOR CONDUITS INTO DOWNTOWN 
AND START TO SEE WHAT THE       

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:42.636
OF MAJOR CONDUITS INTO DOWNTOWN 
AND START TO SEE WHAT THE       
OPPORTUNITY IS TO REALLY EXPAND 

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:45.372
AND START TO SEE WHAT THE       
OPPORTUNITY IS TO REALLY EXPAND 
THAT LOW STRESS NETWORK.        

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:46.307
OPPORTUNITY IS TO REALLY EXPAND 
THAT LOW STRESS NETWORK.        
AND I THINK WHAT&apos;S INTERESTING  

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:48.775
THAT LOW STRESS NETWORK.        
AND I THINK WHAT&apos;S INTERESTING  
TO LOOK AT IN THIS DIAGRAM MORE 

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:49.643
AND I THINK WHAT&apos;S INTERESTING  
TO LOOK AT IN THIS DIAGRAM MORE 
SO THAN THESE KIND OF LIGHTER   

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:52.846
TO LOOK AT IN THIS DIAGRAM MORE 
SO THAN THESE KIND OF LIGHTER   
GREEN AREAS THAT ARE ADDED ON   

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:53.514
SO THAN THESE KIND OF LIGHTER   
GREEN AREAS THAT ARE ADDED ON   
THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT ARE     

01:15:53.516 --> 01:15:56.483
GREEN AREAS THAT ARE ADDED ON   
THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT ARE     
JUST A BLOCK AWAY FROM A        

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:57.151
THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT ARE     
JUST A BLOCK AWAY FROM A        
POTENTIAL NEW LOW STRESS ROUTE

STS AND KIND OF WHY TRANSIT STS 
AND WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT?    

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.121
STS AND KIND OF WHY TRANSIT STS 
AND WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT?    
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY RECOGNIZE   

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.856
AND WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT?    
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY RECOGNIZE   
THAT THE TRANSIT SYSTEM IS AN   

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:10.657
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY RECOGNIZE   
THAT THE TRANSIT SYSTEM IS AN   
INVALUABLE PART OF OUR OVERALL  

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:13.093
THAT THE TRANSIT SYSTEM IS AN   
INVALUABLE PART OF OUR OVERALL  
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND       

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:14.027
INVALUABLE PART OF OUR OVERALL  
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND       
PROVIDING ACCESS FOR A BROAD    

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:17.798
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND       
PROVIDING ACCESS FOR A BROAD    
RANGE THE COMMUNITY AND EVEN    

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.532
PROVIDING ACCESS FOR A BROAD    
RANGE THE COMMUNITY AND EVEN    
WELL OUTSIDE OF ANN ARBOR AND   

01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:19.266
RANGE THE COMMUNITY AND EVEN    
WELL OUTSIDE OF ANN ARBOR AND   
OUTSIDE OF THE DOWNTOWN TO BE   

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:21.802
WELL OUTSIDE OF ANN ARBOR AND   
OUTSIDE OF THE DOWNTOWN TO BE   
ABLE TO ACCESS JOBS AND OTHER   

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:24.971
OUTSIDE OF THE DOWNTOWN TO BE   
ABLE TO ACCESS JOBS AND OTHER   
IMPORTANT DESTINATIONS IN TOWN  

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:25.205
ABLE TO ACCESS JOBS AND OTHER   
IMPORTANT DESTINATIONS IN TOWN

.                               
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE KEY   
FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO BE      

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:29.342
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE KEY   
FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO BE      
LOOKING AT IS HOW DO WE REALLY  

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:31.945
FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO BE      
LOOKING AT IS HOW DO WE REALLY  
MAKE SURE THAT TRANSIT SERVICE  

01:17:31.947 --> 01:17:35.983
LOOKING AT IS HOW DO WE REALLY  
MAKE SURE THAT TRANSIT SERVICE  
CAN BE PRIORITIZED IN DOWNTOWN  

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:37.117
MAKE SURE THAT TRANSIT SERVICE  
CAN BE PRIORITIZED IN DOWNTOWN  
BOTH THE RIDE AND THE EVENT     

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:40.187
CAN BE PRIORITIZED IN DOWNTOWN  
BOTH THE RIDE AND THE EVENT     
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OPERATE  

01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.854
BOTH THE RIDE AND THE EVENT     
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OPERATE  
IN OBVIOUSLY TRANSIT SYSTEMS    

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:44.125
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OPERATE  
IN OBVIOUSLY TRANSIT SYSTEMS    
AND THEY HAVE PLANS FOR         

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:44.925
IN OBVIOUSLY TRANSIT SYSTEMS    
AND THEY HAVE PLANS FOR         
EXPANDED TRANSIT SERVICE, MORE  

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:47.961
AND THEY HAVE PLANS FOR         
EXPANDED TRANSIT SERVICE, MORE  
FREQUENT TRANSIT SERVICE.       

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:48.863
EXPANDED TRANSIT SERVICE, MORE  
FREQUENT TRANSIT SERVICE.       
ALL OF THAT REALLY REQUIRES     

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:51.231
FREQUENT TRANSIT SERVICE.       
ALL OF THAT REALLY REQUIRES     
THAT OPERATIONS BE MORE MORE    

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:52.032
ALL OF THAT REALLY REQUIRES     
THAT OPERATIONS BE MORE MORE    
TIMELY, MORE SMOOTHLY, MORE     

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:55.001
THAT OPERATIONS BE MORE MORE    
TIMELY, MORE SMOOTHLY, MORE     
PREDICTABLE TO HELP SUPPORT     

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:55.802
TIMELY, MORE SMOOTHLY, MORE     
PREDICTABLE TO HELP SUPPORT     
RIDERSHIP AND GREATER TRANSIT

RIDERSHIP AND GREATER TRANSIT   
USE.                            
THAT DOES MEAN THAT WE NEED TO  

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.141
USE.                            
THAT DOES MEAN THAT WE NEED TO  
START THINKING ABOUT DEDICATED  

01:18:00.143 --> 01:18:03.176
THAT DOES MEAN THAT WE NEED TO  
START THINKING ABOUT DEDICATED  
TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT 

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:04.077
START THINKING ABOUT DEDICATED  
TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT 
THAT MIGHT MEAN IN THE DOWNTOWN 

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:04.478
TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT

THINK ABOUT EVENT STREETS AND   
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES.        

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.832
THINK ABOUT EVENT STREETS AND   
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES.        
SO THIS MAP JUST SHOWS A NUMBER 

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.869
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES.        
SO THIS MAP JUST SHOWS A NUMBER 
OF THE CORRIDORS THAT ARE UNDER

WE&apos;RE ALREADY SEEING A PATTERN  
OF LOTS OF CAFE DINING USES,    

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:48.422
WE&apos;RE ALREADY SEEING A PATTERN  
OF LOTS OF CAFE DINING USES,    
THE CAFE PERMIT USES THINGS

OF LOTS OF CAFE DINING USES,    
THE CAFE PERMIT USES THINGS     
LIKE THAT.

THE CAFE PERMIT USES THINGS     
LIKE THAT.                      
SO WE&apos;LL BE LOOKING AT THESE    

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.559
LIKE THAT.                      
SO WE&apos;LL BE LOOKING AT THESE    
CORRIDORS IN MORE DETAIL AND    

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.595
SO WE&apos;LL BE LOOKING AT THESE    
CORRIDORS IN MORE DETAIL AND    
IT&apos;S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING HERE 

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:59.332
CORRIDORS IN MORE DETAIL AND    
IT&apos;S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING HERE 
THAT FOR INSTANCE ON LIBERTY    

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:00.200
IT&apos;S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING HERE 
THAT FOR INSTANCE ON LIBERTY    
STREET IT WOULDN&apos;T BE THE       

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:00.867
THAT FOR INSTANCE ON LIBERTY

INTENT THAT ALL OF LIBERTY      
STREET BE CLOSED TURNED INTO AN 
EVENT STREET THAT&apos;S AN OPTION.  

01:24:04.607 --> 01:24:07.507
STREET BE CLOSED TURNED INTO AN 
EVENT STREET THAT&apos;S AN OPTION.  
BUT WE REALLY DO WANT TO LOOK   

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:08.241
EVENT STREET THAT&apos;S AN OPTION.  
BUT WE REALLY DO WANT TO LOOK   
KIND OF BLOCK BY BLOCK AT WHERE

IT CAN OR MIGHT NOT BE          
SUCCESSFUL AND AND SO IT&apos;S      
REALLY A BLOCK BY BLOCK

THE EVENT STREETS AND WHAT      
MIGHT WORK.                     
OK, LAAR LOOKING AT FIFTH IN

JUST WANTED TO MENTION A FEW    
KIND OF HIGH LEVEL REASONS WHY  

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:31.798
JUST WANTED TO MENTION A FEW    
KIND OF HIGH LEVEL REASONS WHY  
ARE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT TWO

&gt;&gt; THIS WOULD BE KIND OF WOULD  

01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:14.781
FOR IS THAT THE OLD MAP?        
&gt;&gt; THIS WOULD BE KIND OF WOULD  
BE THE PROPOSED ONE ESSENTIALLY 

01:29:14.783 --> 01:29:18.518
&gt;&gt; THIS WOULD BE KIND OF WOULD  
BE THE PROPOSED ONE ESSENTIALLY 
I THINK THESE ARE THESE ARE     

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.385
BE THE PROPOSED ONE ESSENTIALLY 
I THINK THESE ARE THESE ARE     
SPOTS THAT WE WE CAN START TO   

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:22.221
I THINK THESE ARE THESE ARE     
SPOTS THAT WE WE CAN START TO   
LOOK AT TO WITHIN THE           

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:25.258
SPOTS THAT WE WE CAN START TO   
LOOK AT TO WITHIN THE           
CIRCULATION STUDY A COUPLE      

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:25.926
LOOK AT TO WITHIN THE           
CIRCULATION STUDY A COUPLE      
OF CHALLENGES THAT ARE GETTING  

01:29:25.928 --> 01:29:28.628
CIRCULATION STUDY A COUPLE      
OF CHALLENGES THAT ARE GETTING  
A LITTLE WAYS OUTSIDE OF THE    

01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:29.028
OF CHALLENGES THAT ARE GETTING  
A LITTLE WAYS OUTSIDE OF THE    
DISTRICT.                       

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:32.999
A LITTLE WAYS OUTSIDE OF THE    
DISTRICT.                       
SO HOW THAT DOVETAILS WITH WHAT 

01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:34.001
DISTRICT.                       
SO HOW THAT DOVETAILS WITH WHAT 
THE CITY MAY BE LOOKING AT AND  

01:29:34.003 --> 01:29:34.601
SO HOW THAT DOVETAILS WITH WHAT 
THE CITY MAY BE LOOKING AT AND  
THOSE AREAS THAT&apos;S A            

01:29:34.603 --> 01:29:37.070
THE CITY MAY BE LOOKING AT AND  
THOSE AREAS THAT&apos;S A            
CONVERSATION THAT WE CAN SORT   

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:37.671
THOSE AREAS THAT&apos;S A            
CONVERSATION THAT WE CAN SORT   
THROUGH ON THIS.                

01:29:37.673 --> 01:29:41.541
CONVERSATION THAT WE CAN SORT   
THROUGH ON THIS.                
YOU KNOW, THE ONE OVER HERE IS  

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:42.175
THROUGH ON THIS.                
YOU KNOW, THE ONE OVER HERE IS  
KIND OF WHERE WASHTENAW COMES   

01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:44.845
YOU KNOW, THE ONE OVER HERE IS  
KIND OF WHERE WASHTENAW COMES   
IN AND HITS HILL STREET AND     

01:29:44.847 --> 01:29:45.712
KIND OF WHERE WASHTENAW COMES   
IN AND HITS HILL STREET AND     
THAT WHOLE AREA WASHTENAW       

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:49.549
IN AND HITS HILL STREET AND     
THAT WHOLE AREA WASHTENAW       
ITSELF IS AN IMPORTANT CORRIDOR 

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:50.484
THAT WHOLE AREA WASHTENAW       
ITSELF IS AN IMPORTANT CORRIDOR 
AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW IN THE  

01:29:50.486 --> 01:29:52.552
ITSELF IS AN IMPORTANT CORRIDOR 
AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW IN THE  
CITY&apos;S WORKING THROUGH A STUDY  

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:53.419
AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW IN THE  
CITY&apos;S WORKING THROUGH A STUDY  
KIND OF LOOKING AT WHAT THE     

01:29:53.421 --> 01:29:56.490
CITY&apos;S WORKING THROUGH A STUDY  
KIND OF LOOKING AT WHAT THE     
FUTURE OF THOSE CORRIDORS MIGHT 

01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:57.023
KIND OF LOOKING AT WHAT THE     
FUTURE OF THOSE CORRIDORS MIGHT 
POTENTIALLY BE.                 

01:29:57.025 --> 01:30:00.326
FUTURE OF THOSE CORRIDORS MIGHT 
POTENTIALLY BE.                 
SO THAT&apos;S AN AREA THAT I THINK  

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:01.094
POTENTIALLY BE.                 
SO THAT&apos;S AN AREA THAT I THINK  
IS GOING TO NEED SOME CONTINUED 

01:30:01.096 --> 01:30:01.762
SO THAT&apos;S AN AREA THAT I THINK  
IS GOING TO NEED SOME CONTINUED 
AND ONGOING DISCUSSION TO       

01:30:01.764 --> 01:30:07.734
IS GOING TO NEED SOME CONTINUED 
AND ONGOING DISCUSSION TO       
FIGURE OUT                      

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:23.350
           WHAT&apos;S THE BEST WAY  
TO MAKE A CONNECTION THROUGH    
THEIR AGAIN, THAT&apos;S NOT TO SAY  

01:30:23.352 --> 01:30:23.950
TO MAKE A CONNECTION THROUGH    
THEIR AGAIN, THAT&apos;S NOT TO SAY  
THAT WE&apos;RE IGNORING THAT IN     

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:24.684
THEIR AGAIN, THAT&apos;S NOT TO SAY  
THAT WE&apos;RE IGNORING THAT IN     
THIS STUDY BUT IT&apos;S SOMETHING   

01:30:24.686 --> 01:30:25.419
THAT WE&apos;RE IGNORING THAT IN     
THIS STUDY BUT IT&apos;S SOMETHING   
THAT WE CAN START START TO LOOK 

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:25.686
THIS STUDY BUT IT&apos;S SOMETHING   
THAT WE CAN START START TO LOOK 
AT.                             

01:30:25.688 --> 01:30:26.353
THAT WE CAN START START TO LOOK 
AT.                             
THERE&apos;S NOT REALLY A CLEAR      

01:30:26.355 --> 01:30:27.220
AT.                             
THERE&apos;S NOT REALLY A CLEAR      
ANSWER AT THE MOMENT FOR HOW WE

ANSWER AT THE MOMENT FOR HOW WE 
WORK THROUGH THAT.              
&gt;&gt; BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THIS HAS 

01:30:28.524 --> 01:30:29.255
WORK THROUGH THAT.              
&gt;&gt; BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THIS HAS 
A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT 

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:29.990
&gt;&gt; BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THIS HAS 
A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT 
PEOPLE MAY NEED EVEN THOUGH

FILLING IN GAPS THAT YOU        
IDENTIFIED ON A PREVIOUS SLIDE  
AND THAT&apos;S GREAT AND THAT

STUDY TO IDENTIFY HOW WE SHOULD 

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:48.828
BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOUR    
STUDY TO IDENTIFY HOW WE SHOULD 
BE PRIORITIZING THE GAPS SO     

01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:49.662
STUDY TO IDENTIFY HOW WE SHOULD 
BE PRIORITIZING THE GAPS SO     
THAT WHEN IT COMES TIME TO DO   

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:52.832
BE PRIORITIZING THE GAPS SO     
THAT WHEN IT COMES TIME TO DO   
IT LIKE I WANT TO KNOW WHICH    

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:53.633
THAT WHEN IT COMES TIME TO DO   
IT LIKE I WANT TO KNOW WHICH    
ONE OF THESE IS GOING TO HAVE   

01:32:53.635 --> 01:32:56.836
IT LIKE I WANT TO KNOW WHICH    
ONE OF THESE IS GOING TO HAVE   
THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK LIKE 

01:32:56.838 --> 01:32:57.637
ONE OF THESE IS GOING TO HAVE   
THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK LIKE 
WE NEED TO DO THAT ONE FIRST    

01:32:57.639 --> 01:32:58.371
THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK LIKE 
WE NEED TO DO THAT ONE FIRST    
AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THE         

01:32:58.373 --> 01:33:00.973
WE NEED TO DO THAT ONE FIRST    
AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THE         
CHEAPEST ONE AND IT MIGHT NOT   

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:01.708
AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THE         
CHEAPEST ONE AND IT MIGHT NOT   
BE THE EASIEST ONE BUT IT MIGHT 

01:33:01.710 --> 01:33:02.575
CHEAPEST ONE AND IT MIGHT NOT

THINK THE CITY IS NOW LOOKING   
AT GOING THROUGH AND PUTTING    

01:33:44.753 --> 01:33:46.719
THINK THE CITY IS NOW LOOKING   
AT GOING THROUGH AND PUTTING    
YOU KNOW, DELINEATOR AND

YOU KNOW, DELINEATOR AND        
POTENTIALLY RIGHT TO MAKE THAT  
MORE OF A PROTECTED FACILITY    

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.057
POTENTIALLY RIGHT TO MAKE THAT  
MORE OF A PROTECTED FACILITY    
GOING SOUTH OR THINGS LIKE

THAT.                           
SO TO YOUR POINT ABOUT PHASING, 
THERE MAY ALSO BE WAYS TO SORT  

01:33:55.664 --> 01:33:58.030
SO TO YOUR POINT ABOUT PHASING, 
THERE MAY ALSO BE WAYS TO SORT  
OF INCREMENTALLY PHASE THINGS   

01:33:58.032 --> 01:33:59.099
THERE MAY ALSO BE WAYS TO SORT  
OF INCREMENTALLY PHASE THINGS   
IN TO BE ABLE TO GET ACTION     

01:33:59.101 --> 01:34:02.401
OF INCREMENTALLY PHASE THINGS   
IN TO BE ABLE TO GET ACTION     
SOONER ON SOME ITEMS AS AN      

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:03.102
IN TO BE ABLE TO GET ACTION     
SOONER ON SOME ITEMS AS AN      
INTERIM SOLUTION AND THEN BE    

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:04.104
SOONER ON SOME ITEMS AS AN      
INTERIM SOLUTION AND THEN BE    
ABLE TO BUILD IT OUT IN A MORE  

01:34:04.106 --> 01:34:06.572
INTERIM SOLUTION AND THEN BE    
ABLE TO BUILD IT OUT IN A MORE  
PERMANENT WAY OVER TIME.        

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:07.540
ABLE TO BUILD IT OUT IN A MORE  
PERMANENT WAY OVER TIME.

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:08.208
PERMANENT WAY OVER TIME.        
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE ARE DEFINITELY      
THINGS THAT WE CAN BE LOOKING

THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO EXTEND   

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.014
CURIOUS ABOUT IF THE CITY IS    
THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO EXTEND   
THIS EITHER AFTERWARDS OR SORT

STAB AT THIS, ALLOW OTHERS TO   
CHIME IN AS WELL.               

01:35:09.404 --> 01:35:10.070
STAB AT THIS, ALLOW OTHERS TO   
CHIME IN AS WELL.               
YOU&apos;RE RIGHT ABOUT THE          

01:35:10.072 --> 01:35:12.371
CHIME IN AS WELL.               
YOU&apos;RE RIGHT ABOUT THE          
GEOGRAPHY.                      

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:13.272
YOU&apos;RE RIGHT ABOUT THE          
GEOGRAPHY.                      
WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE DOWNTOWN. 

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:15.608
GEOGRAPHY.                      
WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE DOWNTOWN. 
OBVIOUSLY THE DENHA IS THE      

01:35:15.610 --> 01:35:16.509
WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE DOWNTOWN. 
OBVIOUSLY THE DENHA IS THE      
MAJOR PARTNER IN TAKING ON THIS 

01:35:16.511 --> 01:35:19.445
OBVIOUSLY THE DENHA IS THE      
MAJOR PARTNER IN TAKING ON THIS 
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO FOCUS ON   

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:20.246
MAJOR PARTNER IN TAKING ON THIS 
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO FOCUS ON   
THE DOWNTOWN AND THE GEOGRAPHY  

01:35:20.248 --> 01:35:23.516
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO FOCUS ON   
THE DOWNTOWN AND THE GEOGRAPHY  
THAT THEY CAN HELP SUPPORT.     

01:35:23.518 --> 01:35:24.683
THE DOWNTOWN AND THE GEOGRAPHY  
THAT THEY CAN HELP SUPPORT.     
BUT AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY BEING THE  

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:27.920
THAT THEY CAN HELP SUPPORT.     
BUT AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY BEING THE  
NUCLEUS OF CITY THAT MAKES A    

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:28.621
BUT AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY BEING THE  
NUCLEUS OF CITY THAT MAKES A    
LOT OF SENSE FROM THE CITY&apos;S    

01:35:28.623 --> 01:35:29.221
NUCLEUS OF CITY THAT MAKES A    
LOT OF SENSE FROM THE CITY&apos;S    
PERSPECTIVE AS WELL.

LOT OF SENSE FROM THE CITY&apos;S    
PERSPECTIVE AS WELL.            
SO I THINK IT&apos;S A GREAT         

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:34.360
PERSPECTIVE AS WELL.            
SO I THINK IT&apos;S A GREAT         
PARTNERSHIP.                    

01:35:34.362 --> 01:35:38.631
SO I THINK IT&apos;S A GREAT         
PARTNERSHIP.                    
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS WELL 

01:35:38.633 --> 01:35:42.334
PARTNERSHIP.                    
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS WELL 
I THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THE   

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:43.103
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS WELL 
I THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THE   
STUDY AND SEE WHAT CAN BE       

01:35:43.105 --> 01:35:46.372
I THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THE   
STUDY AND SEE WHAT CAN BE       
TRANSLATED OUTSIDE OF THE       

01:35:46.374 --> 01:35:46.706
STUDY AND SEE WHAT CAN BE       
TRANSLATED OUTSIDE OF THE       
DOWNTOWN.                       

01:35:46.708 --> 01:35:47.573
TRANSLATED OUTSIDE OF THE       
DOWNTOWN.                       
WE&apos;RE HAPPY TO DO THAT.         

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:48.641
DOWNTOWN.                       
WE&apos;RE HAPPY TO DO THAT.         
I THINK WE WILL NOT PUT OUR     

01:35:48.643 --> 01:35:50.877
WE&apos;RE HAPPY TO DO THAT.         
I THINK WE WILL NOT PUT OUR     
BLINDERS ON WHERE THESE LINES   

01:35:50.879 --> 01:35:53.913
I THINK WE WILL NOT PUT OUR     
BLINDERS ON WHERE THESE LINES   
AND THAT&apos;S THE END THE END      

01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:54.414
BLINDERS ON WHERE THESE LINES   
AND THAT&apos;S THE END THE END      
OF THE WORLD THERE.             

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:55.415
AND THAT&apos;S THE END THE END      
OF THE WORLD THERE.             
I THINK THAT THAT&apos;S NOT HOW WE  

01:35:55.417 --> 01:35:57.550
OF THE WORLD THERE.             
I THINK THAT THAT&apos;S NOT HOW WE  
WOULD APPROACH IT AND I WOULD   

01:35:57.552 --> 01:35:58.084
I THINK THAT THAT&apos;S NOT HOW WE  
WOULD APPROACH IT AND I WOULD   
SAY THERE ARE OTHER             

01:35:58.086 --> 01:35:58.884
WOULD APPROACH IT AND I WOULD   
SAY THERE ARE OTHER             
COMPLEMENTARY EFFORTS THAT ARE  

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:01.420
SAY THERE ARE OTHER             
COMPLEMENTARY EFFORTS THAT ARE  
UNDERWAY.                       

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:02.288
COMPLEMENTARY EFFORTS THAT ARE  
UNDERWAY.                       
SO OBVIOUSLY WITH WHAT WE&apos;RE    

01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:06.092
UNDERWAY.                       
SO OBVIOUSLY WITH WHAT WE&apos;RE    
TRYING TO DO WITH THE IP AND    

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:06.626
SO OBVIOUSLY WITH WHAT WE&apos;RE    
TRYING TO DO WITH THE IP AND    
INTEGRATION OF THE              

01:36:06.628 --> 01:36:09.428
TRYING TO DO WITH THE IP AND    
INTEGRATION OF THE              
TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND THE ALL 

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:10.330
INTEGRATION OF THE              
TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND THE ALL 
AGES AND THAT NETWORK TRYING TO 

01:36:10.332 --> 01:36:11.064
TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND THE ALL 
AGES AND THAT NETWORK TRYING TO 
MAKE SURE THAT ANY TIME WE      

01:36:11.066 --> 01:36:13.566
AGES AND THAT NETWORK TRYING TO 
MAKE SURE THAT ANY TIME WE      
TOUCH A STREET THAT WE REFLECT  

01:36:13.568 --> 01:36:14.267
MAKE SURE THAT ANY TIME WE      
TOUCH A STREET THAT WE REFLECT  
WHAT THE PLAN CALLS FOR.        

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:17.670
TOUCH A STREET THAT WE REFLECT  
WHAT THE PLAN CALLS FOR.        
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING I THINK     

01:36:17.672 --> 01:36:18.371
WHAT THE PLAN CALLS FOR.        
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING I THINK     
MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE   

01:36:18.373 --> 01:36:20.840
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING I THINK     
MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE   
COUNCIL HALF THE RESOLUTION     

01:36:20.842 --> 01:36:21.508
MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE   
COUNCIL HALF THE RESOLUTION     
THAT YOU ALL SUGGESTED RELATED  

01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:24.377
COUNCIL HALF THE RESOLUTION     
THAT YOU ALL SUGGESTED RELATED  
TO ROADS.                       

01:36:24.379 --> 01:36:25.445
THAT YOU ALL SUGGESTED RELATED  
TO ROADS.
