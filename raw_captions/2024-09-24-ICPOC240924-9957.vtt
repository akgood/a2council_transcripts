TURNING IT ON AND OFF WHEN THEY 
DON'T NEED TO.                  

00:38:57.318 --> 00:38:58.318
TURNING IT ON AND OFF WHEN THEY 
DON'T NEED TO.

WE NEED TO DELINEATE THOSE      
REASONS.                        
ONE OTHER REASON IS SOMETIMES   

00:39:06.094 --> 00:39:09.628
REASONS.                        
ONE OTHER REASON IS SOMETIMES

00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:32.618
BECAUSE PEOPLE WON'T TELL US SO 
THERE THERE ARE A LOT           
OF REASONS WHY THE BUFFER IS    

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.585
THERE THERE ARE A LOT           
OF REASONS WHY THE BUFFER IS    
WHAT WE TALK ABOUT IS SAID 30   

00:39:33.587 --> 00:39:36.356
OF REASONS WHY THE BUFFER IS

IT'S REALLY A GOOD THING FOR    
THE POLICE OFFICERS TO HAVE

IT'S REALLY A GOOD THING FOR    
THE POLICE OFFICERS TO HAVE

A POLICE OFFICER ENGAGES IN A   
PRETTY DANGEROUS SITUATION,     

00:39:48.269 --> 00:39:51.804
A POLICE OFFICER ENGAGES IN A   
PRETTY DANGEROUS SITUATION,     
THEY ONLY HAVE TWO HANDS SO     

00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:52.571
PRETTY DANGEROUS SITUATION,     
THEY ONLY HAVE TWO HANDS SO     
THEY MAY HAVE TO USE THEIR

00:39:54.709 --> 00:39:55.708
THEY MAY HAVE TO USE THEIR      
HANDS TO TO ADDRESS IT.         
SO WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL   

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.845
HANDS TO TO ADDRESS IT.         
SO WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL   
PRESS THE BUTTON TO ALLOW FOR

ACTUALLY PRESS THE BUTTON SO    

00:40:06.421 --> 00:40:07.086
HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE THEY       
ACTUALLY PRESS THE BUTTON SO    
IT'LL BUFFER BACK THIRTY

SECONDS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT     
HAPPENED BEFORE THE OFFICER     

00:40:10.892 --> 00:40:11.490
SECONDS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT     
HAPPENED BEFORE THE OFFICER     
ACTUALLY ACTIVATED IT AND       

00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:13.992
HAPPENED BEFORE THE OFFICER     
ACTUALLY ACTIVATED IT AND       
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT INSTEAD    

00:40:13.994 --> 00:40:14.727
ACTUALLY ACTIVATED IT AND       
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT INSTEAD    
OF SOMETHING ALREADY HAPPENING  

00:40:14.729 --> 00:40:17.930
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT INSTEAD    
OF SOMETHING ALREADY HAPPENING  
AND THEN THEY PRESS THE RECORD  

00:40:17.932 --> 00:40:18.731
OF SOMETHING ALREADY HAPPENING  
AND THEN THEY PRESS THE RECORD  
AND THEN YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT    

00:40:18.733 --> 00:40:21.534
AND THEN THEY PRESS THE RECORD  
AND THEN YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT    
HAPPENED BEFORE.                

00:40:21.536 --> 00:40:22.534
AND THEN YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT    
HAPPENED BEFORE.                
SO A BUFFER IS BACK FOR THAT    

00:40:22.536 --> 00:40:23.302
HAPPENED BEFORE.                
SO A BUFFER IS BACK FOR THAT    
REASON AND IS RUNNING ALL THE   

00:40:23.304 --> 00:40:26.138
SO A BUFFER IS BACK FOR THAT    
REASON AND IS RUNNING ALL THE   
TIME FOR IT BECAUSE WE WANT IT  

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:26.972
REASON AND IS RUNNING ALL THE   
TIME FOR IT BECAUSE WE WANT IT  
WE WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE

WHAT WE'RE DOING BEFORE WE      
ACTUALLY ENGAGE.                
SO THERE ARE SOME REASONS I     

00:40:32.747 --> 00:40:33.679
ACTUALLY ENGAGE.                
SO THERE ARE SOME REASONS I     
WOULD JUST SAY I MEAN THERE IS  

00:40:33.681 --> 00:40:36.515
SO THERE ARE SOME REASONS I     
WOULD JUST SAY I MEAN THERE IS  
A SECTION THAT I SAW TALKS      

00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:37.450
WOULD JUST SAY I MEAN THERE IS  
A SECTION THAT I SAW TALKS      
ABOUT TIMES TO TURN IT UP AND

AREA.                           

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.413

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.835
LANGUAGE ISSUE WITH FROM WHAT I 
UNDERSTAND THERE'S THERE'S      
ACTIVATED AND THEN THERE'S      

00:47:02.837 --> 00:47:06.205
UNDERSTAND THERE'S THERE'S      
ACTIVATED AND THEN THERE'S      
ACTIVATED ON FULL RECORD BUT    

00:47:06.207 --> 00:47:10.308
ACTIVATED AND THEN THERE'S      
ACTIVATED ON FULL RECORD BUT    
ACTIVATED IS USED KIND OF JUST  

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:11.476
ACTIVATED ON FULL RECORD BUT    
ACTIVATED IS USED KIND OF JUST  
USED YOU KNOW, LIKE AS IT AS IT 

00:47:11.478 --> 00:47:13.612
ACTIVATED IS USED KIND OF JUST  
USED YOU KNOW, LIKE AS IT AS IT 
WOULD BE IN ANY OTHER SENTENCE  

00:47:13.614 --> 00:47:17.082
USED YOU KNOW, LIKE AS IT AS IT 
WOULD BE IN ANY OTHER SENTENCE  
AND I THINK MAYBE THAT IS       

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:17.983
WOULD BE IN ANY OTHER SENTENCE  
AND I THINK MAYBE THAT IS       
LEADING TO SOME CONFUSION LIKE  

00:47:17.985 --> 00:47:18.717
AND I THINK MAYBE THAT IS       
LEADING TO SOME CONFUSION LIKE  
ACTIVATE IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE 

00:47:18.719 --> 00:47:22.054
LEADING TO SOME CONFUSION LIKE  
ACTIVATE IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE 
TO BE ON RECORD OR DOES IT HAVE 

00:47:22.056 --> 00:47:25.323
ACTIVATE IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE 
TO BE ON RECORD OR DOES IT HAVE 
TO BE ON RECORD AND THEN IT HAS 

00:47:25.325 --> 00:47:26.024
TO BE ON RECORD OR DOES IT HAVE 
TO BE ON RECORD AND THEN IT HAS 
LIKE ACTIVATED TO ON RECORD.    

00:47:26.026 --> 00:47:28.560
TO BE ON RECORD AND THEN IT HAS 
LIKE ACTIVATED TO ON RECORD.    
SO MAYBE IT'S JUST DIFFERENT    

00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:29.161
LIKE ACTIVATED TO ON RECORD.    
SO MAYBE IT'S JUST DIFFERENT    
WORDING FOR THE DIFFERENT       

00:47:29.163 --> 00:47:32.831
SO MAYBE IT'S JUST DIFFERENT    
WORDING FOR THE DIFFERENT       
STATES THAT THAT DON'T CROSS    

00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:33.432
