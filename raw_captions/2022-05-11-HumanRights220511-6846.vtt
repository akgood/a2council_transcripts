00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.089
TOPIC OR TWO ON THE SHOOTINGS   
THAT LIBBY HAD MENTIONED.       
I THINK THEY COULD DO SOME      

00:21:35.091 --> 00:21:38.391
THAT LIBBY HAD MENTIONED.       
I THINK THEY COULD DO SOME      
RESEARCH ON WHAT OTHER CITIES   

00:21:38.393 --> 00:21:42.095
I THINK THEY COULD DO SOME      
RESEARCH ON WHAT OTHER CITIES   
ARE DOING ABOUT BOTH ABOUT      

00:21:42.097 --> 00:21:42.863
RESEARCH ON WHAT OTHER CITIES   
ARE DOING ABOUT BOTH ABOUT      
HANDLING THE POLICE, ADDRESSING 

00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:46.366
ARE DOING ABOUT BOTH ABOUT      
HANDLING THE POLICE, ADDRESSING 
THIS WITH THE POLICE AND ABOUT  

00:21:46.368 --> 00:21:47.100
HANDLING THE POLICE, ADDRESSING 
THIS WITH THE POLICE AND ABOUT  
HOW THEY HANDLED THE TENSIONS

HOW THEY HANDLED THE TENSIONS   
THAT ARISE AS A RESULT.         

00:21:50.272 --> 00:21:51.038
HOW THEY HANDLED THE TENSIONS   
THAT ARISE AS A RESULT.         
SO THERE&amp;apos;S LOTS                 

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.507
THAT ARISE AS A RESULT.         
SO THERE&amp;apos;S LOTS                 
OF POSSIBILITIES OF NEW TOPICS  

00:21:53.509 --> 00:21:54.641
SO THERE&amp;apos;S LOTS                 
OF POSSIBILITIES OF NEW TOPICS  
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET    

00:21:54.643 --> 00:21:57.845
OF POSSIBILITIES OF NEW TOPICS  
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET    
MORE INFORMATION ON ABOUT WHAT

FOUND THEM TO BE INCREDIBLY     
INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL.        

00:22:23.406 --> 00:22:24.404
FOUND THEM TO BE INCREDIBLY     
INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL.        
I THOUGHT THEY WERE REALLY WELL 

00:22:24.406 --> 00:22:27.508
INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL.        
I THOUGHT THEY WERE REALLY WELL 
DONE AND AND I APPRECIATED THE

AND YOU KNOW, I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW I    
KNOW WE&amp;apos;RE LACKING QUORUM       

00:22:35.585 --> 00:22:35.982
AND YOU KNOW, I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW I    
KNOW WE&amp;apos;RE LACKING QUORUM       
TONIGHT.                        

00:22:35.984 --> 00:22:36.717

TONIGHT.                        
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT EMBARKING ON  
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD       

00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:39.687
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT EMBARKING ON  
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD       
NECESSARILY REQUIRE A FORMAL    

00:22:39.689 --> 00:22:40.287
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD       
NECESSARILY REQUIRE A FORMAL    
VOTE OF THE BODY.               

00:22:40.289 --> 00:22:43.557
NECESSARILY REQUIRE A FORMAL    
VOTE OF THE BODY.               
BUT I I CERTAINLY THOUGHT THAT  

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:44.291
VOTE OF THE BODY.               
BUT I I CERTAINLY THOUGHT THAT  
THAT THE WORK LAST TIME WAS     

00:22:44.293 --> 00:22:46.326
BUT I I CERTAINLY THOUGHT THAT  
THAT THE WORK LAST TIME WAS     
GREAT AND I WOULD LOVE TO TO

00:22:47.263 --> 00:22:50.464
GREAT AND I WOULD LOVE TO TO    
PARTICIPATE IN THAT AGAIN WE&amp;apos;VE 
ACTUALLY USED THE INFORMATION   

00:22:50.466 --> 00:22:51.264
PARTICIPATE IN THAT AGAIN WE&amp;apos;VE 
ACTUALLY USED THE INFORMATION   
THAT WE&amp;apos;VE GOT FROM SOME        

00:22:51.266 --> 00:22:54.100
ACTUALLY USED THE INFORMATION   
THAT WE&amp;apos;VE GOT FROM SOME        
OF THOSE REPORTS.

THAT WE&amp;apos;VE GOT FROM SOME        
OF THOSE REPORTS.               
SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S BEEN VERY       

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.303
OF THOSE REPORTS.
