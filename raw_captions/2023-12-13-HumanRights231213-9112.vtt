01:37:35.168 --> 01:37:35.900
VERY GOOD REASON I INVITED THEM 
TO COME BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR    
RESEARCH THAT REALLY HELPED TO  

01:37:35.902 --> 01:37:36.300
TO COME BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR    
RESEARCH THAT REALLY HELPED TO  
IDENTIFY IT.                    

01:37:36.302 --> 01:37:39.370
RESEARCH THAT REALLY HELPED TO  
IDENTIFY IT.                    
WE COULD GET OUR EXPECTATIONS   

01:37:39.372 --> 01:37:43.441
IDENTIFY IT.                    
WE COULD GET OUR EXPECTATIONS   
OF CONTRACTORS IN LINE WITH

WE COULD GET OUR EXPECTATIONS   
OF CONTRACTORS IN LINE WITH

01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:47.277

LOGISTICAL REASON WHY IT SHOULD 
ALSO BE DELAYED AS HUMAN RIGHTS 

01:37:59.592 --> 01:38:02.593
LOGISTICAL REASON WHY IT SHOULD 
ALSO BE DELAYED AS HUMAN RIGHTS 
AS A COMMISSION ALSO NEEDS TO   

01:38:02.595 --> 01:38:03.393
ALSO BE DELAYED AS HUMAN RIGHTS

OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. 

01:38:22.482 --> 01:38:25.883

SO I THINK SOMEBODY HAS         
MENTIONED TO ME THAT THEY       

01:39:01.053 --> 01:39:03.121
WEREN&apos;T THEY WERE THINKING THAT 
WE WOULD BE THE WILL BE AN      
AFFIDAVIT CONTRACTORS ALREADY   

01:39:03.123 --> 01:39:03.854

DISCRIMINATE AGAINST X Y AND    
THEN WE ALSO DON&apos;T ASK ABOUT    
CRIMINAL LEGAL HISTORY UNTIL AN 

01:39:05.958 --> 01:39:06.624
THEN WE ALSO DON&apos;T ASK ABOUT    
CRIMINAL LEGAL HISTORY UNTIL AN 
OFFER IS MADE AND THEN A        

01:39:06.626 --> 01:39:07.357
CRIMINAL LEGAL HISTORY UNTIL AN 
OFFER IS MADE AND THEN A        
BACKGROUND CHECK IS CONDUCTED   

01:39:07.359 --> 01:39:08.092
