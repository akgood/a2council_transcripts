BE SOMETHING I&apos;LL TALK A LITTLE 
BIT ABOUT ON HORIZON ISSUES     

00:28:45.546 --> 00:28:47.746
BE SOMETHING I&apos;LL TALK A LITTLE 
BIT ABOUT ON HORIZON ISSUES     
THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING     

00:28:47.748 --> 00:28:48.480
BIT ABOUT ON HORIZON ISSUES     
THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING     
ABOUT A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT 

00:28:48.482 --> 00:28:50.181
THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING     
ABOUT A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT 
IN THE FUTURE.                  

00:28:50.183 --> 00:28:50.949
ABOUT A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT 
IN THE FUTURE.                  
IT&apos;S SOMETHING WE&apos;RE GOING TO   

00:28:50.951 --> 00:28:51.683
IN THE FUTURE.                  
IT&apos;S SOMETHING WE&apos;RE GOING TO   
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FOR THIS    

00:28:51.685 --> 00:28:54.553
IT&apos;S SOMETHING WE&apos;RE GOING TO   
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FOR THIS    
YEAR IN FISCAL OR TWENTY FIVE   

00:28:54.555 --> 00:28:55.287
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FOR THIS    
YEAR IN FISCAL OR TWENTY FIVE   
WE WOULD PROPOSE THE FIVE       

00:28:55.289 --> 00:28:55.921
YEAR IN FISCAL OR TWENTY FIVE   
WE WOULD PROPOSE THE FIVE       
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO     

00:28:55.923 --> 00:28:58.590
WE WOULD PROPOSE THE FIVE       
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO     
COME OUT OF THE FUND BALANCE    

00:28:58.592 --> 00:28:59.058
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO     
COME OUT OF THE FUND BALANCE    
FROM RESURFACING.               

00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.725
COME OUT OF THE FUND BALANCE    
FROM RESURFACING.               
SO THIS IS SOME BALANCE.        

00:28:59.727 --> 00:29:02.660
FROM RESURFACING.               
SO THIS IS SOME BALANCE.        
IT HASN&apos;T BEEN USED FROM A      

00:29:02.662 --> 00:29:03.261
SO THIS IS SOME BALANCE.        
IT HASN&apos;T BEEN USED FROM A      
PREVIOUS YEAR THAT&apos;S NOW        

00:29:03.263 --> 00:29:03.595
IT HASN&apos;T BEEN USED FROM A      
PREVIOUS YEAR THAT&apos;S NOW        
AVAILABLE.                      

00:29:03.597 --> 00:29:06.364
PREVIOUS YEAR THAT&apos;S NOW        
AVAILABLE.                      
SO IT&apos;S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT  

00:29:06.366 --> 00:29:07.198
AVAILABLE.                      
SO IT&apos;S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT  
WHEN WE&apos;RE DOING THESE TYPES    

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.200
SO IT&apos;S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT  
WHEN WE&apos;RE DOING THESE TYPES    
OF INITIATIVES THE SIZE OF THE  

00:29:09.202 --> 00:29:09.834
WHEN WE&apos;RE DOING THESE TYPES    
OF INITIATIVES THE SIZE OF THE  
PIE IS FIXED.                   

00:29:09.836 --> 00:29:10.902
OF INITIATIVES THE SIZE OF THE  
PIE IS FIXED.                   
SO IF WE&apos;RE DOING MORE OF ONE   

00:29:10.904 --> 00:29:17.409
PIE IS FIXED.                   
SO IF WE&apos;RE DOING MORE OF ONE   
THING LIKE TRAFICON THEN WE     

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.690
TAKE IT AWAY FROM SOMETHING AND 
IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE DOING  
SOME RESURFACING.               

00:29:32.692 --> 00:29:33.492
IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE DOING  
SOME RESURFACING.               
SO THERE&apos;S SORT OF THAT NATURAL 

00:29:33.494 --> 00:29:34.025
SOME RESURFACING.               
SO THERE&apos;S SORT OF THAT NATURAL 
TENSION BETWEEN DIFFERENT       

00:29:34.027 --> 00:29:34.693
SO THERE&apos;S SORT OF THAT NATURAL 
TENSION BETWEEN DIFFERENT       
MULTIPLE PRIORITIES AND IT      

00:29:34.695 --> 00:29:35.427
TENSION BETWEEN DIFFERENT       
MULTIPLE PRIORITIES AND IT      
WOULD TAKE ALMOST HALF OF WHAT  

00:29:35.429 --> 00:29:36.295
MULTIPLE PRIORITIES AND IT      
WOULD TAKE ALMOST HALF OF WHAT  
THE BALANCE IS THAT EXISTS IN   

00:29:36.297 --> 00:29:36.962
WOULD TAKE ALMOST HALF OF WHAT  
THE BALANCE IS THAT EXISTS IN   
THE RESURFACING FUND FROM THE   

00:29:36.964 --> 00:29:37.429
THE BALANCE IS THAT EXISTS IN   
THE RESURFACING FUND FROM THE   
PREVIOUS YEAR.                  

00:29:37.431 --> 00:29:38.163
THE RESURFACING FUND FROM THE   
PREVIOUS YEAR.                  
MOVING ON TO THE SOLID WASTE    

00:29:38.165 --> 00:29:38.764
PREVIOUS YEAR.

SERVICE DELIVERY ISSUE FOR US.

SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD A 
GATE FAILURE.

00:36:08.421 --> 00:36:09.087
GATE FAILURE.                   
SO WE WERE GOING TO BE          
INVESTIGATING, YOU KNOW, WHAT   

00:36:09.089 --> 00:36:09.888

INVESTIGATING, YOU KNOW, WHAT   
DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE CITY?    
THEY WOULD LIKE US TO TAKE      

00:36:12.225 --> 00:36:12.890
DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE CITY?    
THEY WOULD LIKE US TO TAKE      
OWNERSHIP OVER OF IT.           

00:36:12.892 --> 00:36:13.624
THEY WOULD LIKE US TO TAKE      
OWNERSHIP OVER OF IT.

00:36:24.003 --> 00:36:24.735
LIABILITY THAT WE WOULD BE      
INCURRING IN THE LONG RUN AND   
BASED ON THE CURRENT FUNDING

INCURRING IN THE LONG RUN AND   
BASED ON THE CURRENT FUNDING    
FOR THE YETI&apos;S DAM, THE BRIDGE  

00:36:28.075 --> 00:36:28.873
BASED ON THE CURRENT FUNDING    
FOR THE YETI&apos;S DAM, THE BRIDGE  
WOULD ALSO LIKELY AT THIS       

00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:32.309
FOR THE YETI&apos;S DAM, THE BRIDGE  
WOULD ALSO LIKELY AT THIS       
CURRENT STATE OF , YOU KNOW, BE

WHICH WOULD BE ANOTHER          
CHALLENGE FOR PARKS.            
SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS IN   

00:36:37.116 --> 00:36:39.650
CHALLENGE FOR PARKS.            
SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS IN   
THE LONG RUN AND FIGURE OUT     

00:36:39.652 --> 00:36:40.485
SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS IN   
THE LONG RUN AND FIGURE OUT     
WHAT OUR STRATEGY IS IF WE ARE  

00:36:40.487 --> 00:36:41.419
THE LONG RUN AND FIGURE OUT     
WHAT OUR STRATEGY IS IF WE ARE  
GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE OWNERSHIP

AND AGAIN, SOMETHING IT&apos;S A     
HORIZON ISSUE THAT WE&apos;LL NEED   

00:36:46.359 --> 00:36:50.595
AND AGAIN, SOMETHING IT&apos;S A     
HORIZON ISSUE THAT WE&apos;LL NEED   
TO EXPLORE ON SOLID WASTE.      

00:36:50.597 --> 00:36:51.529
HORIZON ISSUE THAT WE&apos;LL NEED   
TO EXPLORE ON SOLID WASTE.      
SO A FEW ITEMS THERE.           

00:36:51.531 --> 00:36:52.330

ABOUT THAT BUT THAT&apos;S A HORIZON 
ISSUE WILL NEED TO BE DISCUSSED 
FOR FOR THE UTILITY FUNDS.      

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:24.909
ISSUE WILL NEED TO BE DISCUSSED 
FOR FOR THE UTILITY FUNDS.      
SO ON THE WATER SIDE I THINK    

00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:27.545
FOR FOR THE UTILITY FUNDS.      
SO ON THE WATER SIDE I THINK    
YOU&apos;RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THIS 

00:40:27.547 --> 00:40:28.479
SO ON THE WATER SIDE I THINK    
YOU&apos;RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
BECAUSE WE JUST CAME TO YOU FOR 

00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:29.147
YOU&apos;RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
BECAUSE WE JUST CAME TO YOU FOR 
APPROVAL OF THE WATER STRATEGIC 

00:40:29.149 --> 00:40:31.983
BECAUSE WE JUST CAME TO YOU FOR 
APPROVAL OF THE WATER STRATEGIC 
PLAN BUT WE&apos;RE IN THE YEAR LIKE 

00:40:31.985 --> 00:40:34.853
APPROVAL OF THE WATER STRATEGIC 
PLAN BUT WE&apos;RE IN THE YEAR LIKE 
THINK THIS IS GREENISH COLOR.   

00:40:34.855 --> 00:40:38.589
PLAN BUT WE&apos;RE IN THE YEAR LIKE 
THINK THIS IS GREENISH COLOR.   
WHERE ARE WE TO DO THAT AND THE 

00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:42.460
THINK THIS IS GREENISH COLOR.   
WHERE ARE WE TO DO THAT AND THE 
TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION?       

00:40:42.462 --> 00:40:43.061
WHERE ARE WE TO DO THAT AND THE 
TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION?       
SO TWENTY THREE.                

00:40:43.063 --> 00:40:43.928
TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION?       
SO TWENTY THREE.                
TWENTY FOUR THAT&apos;S WHERE WE&apos;RE  

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.430
SO TWENTY THREE.                
TWENTY FOUR THAT&apos;S WHERE WE&apos;RE  
EVALUATING RIGHT NOW.           

00:40:46.432 --> 00:40:47.398
TWENTY FOUR THAT&apos;S WHERE WE&apos;RE  
EVALUATING RIGHT NOW.           
WE WILL BE CONTINUING WITH OUR  

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.601
EVALUATING RIGHT NOW.           
WE WILL BE CONTINUING WITH OUR  
PILOT PLANT IS UP AND RUNNING.  

00:40:50.603 --> 00:40:51.336
WE WILL BE CONTINUING WITH OUR  
PILOT PLANT IS UP AND RUNNING.  
WE&apos;RE STILL WORKING OUT SOME    

00:40:51.338 --> 00:40:52.269
PILOT PLANT IS UP AND RUNNING.  
WE&apos;RE STILL WORKING OUT SOME    
BUGS BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:53.771
WE&apos;RE STILL WORKING OUT SOME    
BUGS BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
NEXT YEAR WE INTEND TO GET A    

00:40:53.773 --> 00:40:54.539
BUGS BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
NEXT YEAR WE INTEND TO GET A    
LOT OF GOOD DATA THAT WILL HELP 

00:40:54.541 --> 00:40:55.206
NEXT YEAR WE INTEND TO GET A    
LOT OF GOOD DATA THAT WILL HELP 
INFORM THE DECISIONS AND WE     

00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:57.207
LOT OF GOOD DATA THAT WILL HELP 
INFORM THE DECISIONS AND WE     
NEED TO MAKE IN TERMS OF WHAT   

00:40:57.209 --> 00:40:58.042
INFORM THE DECISIONS AND WE     
NEED TO MAKE IN TERMS OF WHAT   
DOES THE REHABILITATION OF THE  

00:40:58.044 --> 00:40:58.709
NEED TO MAKE IN TERMS OF WHAT   
DOES THE REHABILITATION OF THE  
WATER TREATMENT LOOK LIKE FOR   

00:40:58.711 --> 00:41:01.311
DOES THE REHABILITATION OF THE  
WATER TREATMENT LOOK LIKE FOR   
THE NEXT SEVERAL GENERATION?    

00:41:01.313 --> 00:41:02.246
WATER TREATMENT LOOK LIKE FOR   
THE NEXT SEVERAL GENERATION?    
SO THAT&apos;S REALLY WHAT YOU&apos;LL BE 

00:41:02.248 --> 00:41:03.046
THE NEXT SEVERAL GENERATION?    
SO THAT&apos;S REALLY WHAT YOU&apos;LL BE 
SEEING OVER THE COURSE OF THE   

00:41:03.048 --> 00:41:05.449
SO THAT&apos;S REALLY WHAT YOU&apos;LL BE 
SEEING OVER THE COURSE OF THE   
NEXT YEAR.

SEEING OVER THE COURSE OF THE   
NEXT YEAR.                      
THE UTILITY SYSTEM CAPACITY     

00:41:06.152 --> 00:41:06.817
NEXT YEAR.                      
THE UTILITY SYSTEM CAPACITY     
ANALYZES THOSE ARE THE THREE    

00:41:06.819 --> 00:41:09.887
THE UTILITY SYSTEM CAPACITY     
ANALYZES THOSE ARE THE THREE    
ANALYZES THAT I MENTIONED ON    

00:41:09.889 --> 00:41:10.688
ANALYZES THOSE ARE THE THREE    
ANALYZES THAT I MENTIONED ON    
OUR THREE DIFFERENT UTILITIES.  

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.825
ANALYZES THAT I MENTIONED ON    
OUR THREE DIFFERENT UTILITIES.  
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY    

00:41:13.827 --> 00:41:14.558
OUR THREE DIFFERENT UTILITIES.  
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY    
IMPORTANT HISTORICALLY WE&apos;VE    

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.395
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY    
IMPORTANT HISTORICALLY WE&apos;VE    
TAKEN THE POSITION WHERE WE     

00:41:17.397 --> 00:41:18.129
IMPORTANT HISTORICALLY WE&apos;VE    
TAKEN THE POSITION WHERE WE     
DON&apos;T REALLY AUGMENT THE

CAPACITY TO SERVE THEM.         

00:41:25.204 --> 00:41:26.170
FOR WHAT IT COST TO BUILD THE   
CAPACITY TO SERVE THEM.         
IF WE WERE GOING TO BE SERIOUS  

00:41:26.172 --> 00:41:28.472
CAPACITY TO SERVE THEM.         
IF WE WERE GOING TO BE SERIOUS  
AS A COMMUNITY ABOUT

DEVELOPMENT, DO WE WANT TO BE   
AHEAD OF THAT?                  
WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE ABOUT

AHEAD OF THAT?                  
WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE ABOUT   
WHAT BOULT ALLOWS US TO DO IN

RATEPAYERS.                     
BUT WHAT WE&apos;RE FINDING WITH     
SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT   

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:44.822
BUT WHAT WE&apos;RE FINDING WITH     
SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT   
WE&apos;VE BEEN SEEING THAT ARE      

00:41:44.824 --> 00:41:45.489
SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT   
WE&apos;VE BEEN SEEING THAT ARE      
LARGE PARTICULARLY ON THE       

00:41:45.491 --> 00:41:47.124
WE&apos;VE BEEN SEEING THAT ARE      
LARGE PARTICULARLY ON THE       
SANITARY SIDE WHERE THERE&apos;S NOT

SOME OF THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS, 

00:41:50.864 --> 00:41:54.331
SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO SERVE    
SOME OF THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS, 
YOU KNOW THE COST IT REALLY     

00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:55.266
SOME OF THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS, 
YOU KNOW THE COST IT REALLY     
BECOMES A BARRIER TO GET INTO   

00:41:55.268 --> 00:41:58.669
YOU KNOW THE COST IT REALLY     
BECOMES A BARRIER TO GET INTO   
THE CITY AND BUILD BECAUSE THE  

00:41:58.671 --> 00:41:59.436
BECOMES A BARRIER TO GET INTO   
THE CITY AND BUILD BECAUSE THE  
COSTS ARE SO SUBSTANTIAL TO     

00:41:59.438 --> 00:42:00.171
THE CITY AND BUILD BECAUSE THE  
COSTS ARE SO SUBSTANTIAL TO     
IMPROVE THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE   

00:42:00.173 --> 00:42:02.507
COSTS ARE SO SUBSTANTIAL TO     
IMPROVE THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE   
TO ACCOMMODATE.                 

00:42:02.509 --> 00:42:03.507
IMPROVE THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE   
TO ACCOMMODATE.                 
SO IT PROBABLY AN APPROPRIATE   

00:42:03.509 --> 00:42:04.308
TO ACCOMMODATE.                 
SO IT PROBABLY AN APPROPRIATE   
CONVERSATION TO BE HAVING IS IS 

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.144
SO IT PROBABLY AN APPROPRIATE   
CONVERSATION TO BE HAVING IS IS 
THERE YOU DO WE WANT TO BE      

00:42:07.146 --> 00:42:07.811
CONVERSATION TO BE HAVING IS IS 
THERE YOU DO WE WANT TO BE      
THINKING ABOUT MAKING SOME      

00:42:07.813 --> 00:42:09.813
THERE YOU DO WE WANT TO BE      
THINKING ABOUT MAKING SOME      
INVESTMENTS SO WE&apos;RE MORE       

00:42:09.815 --> 00:42:10.481
THINKING ABOUT MAKING SOME      
INVESTMENTS SO WE&apos;RE MORE       
FRIENDLY TO ALLOW FOLKS WHO     

00:42:10.483 --> 00:42:13.484
INVESTMENTS SO WE&apos;RE MORE       
FRIENDLY TO ALLOW FOLKS WHO     
WANT TO DEVELOP TO BE ABLE TO   

00:42:13.486 --> 00:42:14.552
FRIENDLY TO ALLOW FOLKS WHO     
WANT TO DEVELOP TO BE ABLE TO   
GET IN AND THE CAPACITY EXISTS  

00:42:14.554 --> 00:42:15.285
WANT TO DEVELOP TO BE ABLE TO   
GET IN AND THE CAPACITY EXISTS  
BECAUSE IN SOME OF THESE CASES  

00:42:15.287 --> 00:42:18.056
GET IN AND THE CAPACITY EXISTS  
BECAUSE IN SOME OF THESE CASES  
THE CAPACITY COULD TAKE YEARS   

00:42:18.058 --> 00:42:18.923
BECAUSE IN SOME OF THESE CASES  
THE CAPACITY COULD TAKE YEARS   
FOR US TO BUILD AND THAT MIGHT  

00:42:18.925 --> 00:42:21.658
THE CAPACITY COULD TAKE YEARS   
FOR US TO BUILD AND THAT MIGHT  
NOT MEET THE TIMELINE FOR       

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.493
FOR US TO BUILD AND THAT MIGHT  
NOT MEET THE TIMELINE FOR       
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME AND AND 

00:42:22.495 --> 00:42:24.595
NOT MEET THE TIMELINE FOR       
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME AND AND 
INVEST IN THE CITY.             

00:42:24.597 --> 00:42:25.529
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME AND AND 
INVEST IN THE CITY.             
SO DEFINITELY A HORIZON ISSUE   

00:42:25.531 --> 00:42:28.632
INVEST IN THE CITY.             
SO DEFINITELY A HORIZON ISSUE   
AND THAT SORT OF TIES INTO THE  

00:42:28.634 --> 00:42:29.300
SO DEFINITELY A HORIZON ISSUE   
AND THAT SORT OF TIES INTO THE  
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ZONING 

00:42:29.302 --> 00:42:30.000
AND THAT SORT OF TIES INTO THE

CHANGE THAT WE&apos;VE BEEN          
DISCUSSING ON THE WATER SYSTEM. 

00:42:33.172 --> 00:42:36.707
CHANGE THAT WE&apos;VE BEEN          
DISCUSSING ON THE WATER SYSTEM. 
SO TWO FIGURES HERE AND I&apos;M     

00:42:36.709 --> 00:42:37.475
DISCUSSING ON THE WATER SYSTEM. 
SO TWO FIGURES HERE AND I&apos;M     
GETTING CLOSE ON THE WATER      

00:42:37.477 --> 00:42:40.745
SO TWO FIGURES HERE AND I&apos;M

00:42:40.747 --> 00:42:41.946
GETTING CLOSE ON THE WATER      
MAINS BY DECADE INSTALLED.      
SO THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM YOU&apos;LL 

00:42:41.948 --> 00:42:44.982
MAINS BY DECADE INSTALLED.      
SO THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM YOU&apos;LL 
SEE THAT THERE&apos;S SORT OF A BIG

AMBULANCE.                      

01:12:24.328 --> 01:12:25.328
OF WHICH COULD BE TO GET A USED 
AMBULANCE.                      
THEY&apos;RE USED FOR A REASON THAT  

01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:26.161

THEY&apos;RE USED FOR A REASON THAT

01:12:26.163 --> 01:12:27.964
THEY&apos;RE USED FOR A REASON THAT  
COMES WITH A HOST OF CHALLENGES 
IN TERMS OF ONGOING MAINTENANCE 

01:12:27.966 --> 01:12:31.500
COMES WITH A HOST OF CHALLENGES 
IN TERMS OF ONGOING MAINTENANCE 
COSTS, THE COST OF A NEW ONE IS 

01:12:31.502 --> 01:12:32.035
IN TERMS OF ONGOING MAINTENANCE 
COSTS, THE COST OF A NEW ONE IS

AND ASSUMING THAT PARKING RATES 
GET THAT THOSE RATES GET        
APPROVED, FINANCIAL STEWARDSHIP 

01:22:10.448 --> 01:22:11.113
GET THAT THOSE RATES GET        
APPROVED, FINANCIAL STEWARDSHIP 
IS SOMETHING THAT WE&apos;RE ALWAYS

SO THROUGH OUR RATE STUDY WE    
UTILIZE SPECIALIZED SOFTWARE    

01:22:18.255 --> 01:22:19.053
SO THROUGH OUR RATE STUDY WE    
UTILIZE SPECIALIZED SOFTWARE    
FROM A COMPANY CALLED MUNY      

01:22:19.055 --> 01:22:22.090
UTILIZE SPECIALIZED SOFTWARE    
FROM A COMPANY CALLED MUNY

01:22:26.563 --> 01:22:27.328
THEY DEVELOPED A MODELING       
SYSTEM WHERE WE ARE NOW ABLE TO 
LOOK AT THE IMPACTS THAT        

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:30.365
SYSTEM WHERE WE ARE NOW ABLE TO 
LOOK AT THE IMPACTS THAT        
CHANGES IN UTILIZATION AND      

01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:31.199
LOOK AT THE IMPACTS THAT        
CHANGES IN UTILIZATION AND      
CHANGES IN RATES HAVE ON THE    

01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:34.469
CHANGES IN UTILIZATION AND      
CHANGES IN RATES HAVE ON THE    
FINANCE PICTURE OF OUR PARKING
