AND SO I WENT THROUGH AND       

00:06:33.373 --> 00:06:37.241
INCH RISE.                      
AND SO I WENT THROUGH AND       
CREATED THAT IN THE ONLY SPACE  

00:06:37.243 --> 00:06:38.343
AND SO I WENT THROUGH AND       
CREATED THAT IN THE ONLY SPACE  
THAT IS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE     

00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:41.847
CREATED THAT IN THE ONLY SPACE  
THAT IS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE     
FACT THAT THE BUILDING IS       

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.916
THAT IS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE     
FACT THAT THE BUILDING IS       
ENTIRELY BUILT OUT OF STEEL     

00:06:44.918 --> 00:06:49.154
FACT THAT THE BUILDING IS       
ENTIRELY BUILT OUT OF STEEL     
CONCRETE THERE'S NO WOOD OR     

00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:49.888
ENTIRELY BUILT OUT OF STEEL     
CONCRETE THERE'S NO WOOD OR     
ANYTHING IN THE BUILDING.       

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:50.922
CONCRETE THERE'S NO WOOD OR     
ANYTHING IN THE BUILDING.       
IT WAS BUILT TO BE COMPLETELY   

00:06:50.924 --> 00:06:53.692
ANYTHING IN THE BUILDING.       
IT WAS BUILT TO BE COMPLETELY   
FIREPROOF ON PURPOSE AND HAS    

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:56.561
IT WAS BUILT TO BE COMPLETELY   
FIREPROOF ON PURPOSE AND HAS    
THESE MASSIVE BEAMS GOING EVERY 

00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:56.961
FIREPROOF ON PURPOSE AND HAS    
THESE MASSIVE BEAMS GOING EVERY 
WHICH WAY.                      

00:06:56.963 --> 00:07:00.898
THESE MASSIVE BEAMS GOING EVERY 
WHICH WAY.                      
SO ON THE THIRD PLAN YOU CAN    

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.936
WHICH WAY.                      
SO ON THE THIRD PLAN YOU CAN    
SEE THAT THE IDEA OF A LANDING  

00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:05.870
SO ON THE THIRD PLAN YOU CAN    
SEE THAT THE IDEA OF A LANDING  
A SECOND LANDING AT THE BOTTOM  

00:07:05.872 --> 00:07:08.739
SEE THAT THE IDEA OF A LANDING  
A SECOND LANDING AT THE BOTTOM  
OF THE STAIRS IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR 

00:07:08.741 --> 00:07:12.310
A SECOND LANDING AT THE BOTTOM  
OF THE STAIRS IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR 
TWO REASONS.                    

00:07:12.312 --> 00:07:16.347
OF THE STAIRS IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR 
TWO REASONS.                    
ONE IS HEADROOM ISSUE THERE IS  

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:19.284
TWO REASONS.                    
ONE IS HEADROOM ISSUE THERE IS  
THE MAIN CARRYING BEAM FOR THE  

00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:20.218
ONE IS HEADROOM ISSUE THERE IS  
THE MAIN CARRYING BEAM FOR THE  
ALL THE FLOORS ABOVE GOES RIGHT 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.487
THE MAIN CARRYING BEAM FOR THE  
ALL THE FLOORS ABOVE GOES RIGHT 
WHERE THAT WOULD OVERHEAD       

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:27.758
ALL THE FLOORS ABOVE GOES RIGHT 
WHERE THAT WOULD OVERHEAD       
OF THAT LANDING WHICH ONLY      

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.493
WHERE THAT WOULD OVERHEAD       
OF THAT LANDING WHICH ONLY      
LEAVES YOU I THINK IT'S LIKE    

00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:31.129
OF THAT LANDING WHICH ONLY      
LEAVES YOU I THINK IT'S LIKE    
FIVE FOOT EIGHT OR SOMETHING    

00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:35.633
LEAVES YOU I THINK IT'S LIKE    
FIVE FOOT EIGHT OR SOMETHING    
FIVE FOOT SIX HEADROOM AND THAT 

00:07:35.635 --> 00:07:38.703
FIVE FOOT EIGHT OR SOMETHING    
FIVE FOOT SIX HEADROOM AND THAT 
THAT BEAM IS NOT IT'S THAT'S    

00:07:38.705 --> 00:07:39.604
FIVE FOOT SIX HEADROOM AND THAT 
THAT BEAM IS NOT IT'S THAT'S    
IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE THAT BEING   

00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:43.308
THAT BEAM IS NOT IT'S THAT'S    
IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE THAT BEING   
THE OTHER REASON IS THAT THERE  

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:50.881
IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE THAT BEING   
THE OTHER REASON IS THAT THERE  
IS THE MAIN HVAC SYSTEM THAT    

00:07:50.883 --> 00:07:51.550
THE OTHER REASON IS THAT THERE  
IS THE MAIN HVAC SYSTEM THAT    
WAS JUST INSTALLED ALSO RUNS    

00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:54.219
IS THE MAIN HVAC SYSTEM THAT    
WAS JUST INSTALLED ALSO RUNS    
THROUGH THERE WHICH WOULD COST  

00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:57.622
WAS JUST INSTALLED ALSO RUNS    
THROUGH THERE WHICH WOULD COST  
A LOT OF MONEY TO MOVE BUT IT   

00:07:57.624 --> 00:07:58.423
THROUGH THERE WHICH WOULD COST  
A LOT OF MONEY TO MOVE BUT IT   
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE   

00:07:58.425 --> 00:07:58.923
A LOT OF MONEY TO MOVE BUT IT   
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE   
THERE'S NO HEADROOM.            

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:02.126
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE   
THERE'S NO HEADROOM.            
SO WE'RE BASICALLY ASKING FOR   

00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:05.463
THERE'S NO HEADROOM.            
SO WE'RE BASICALLY ASKING FOR   
JUST ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH     

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:09.767
SO WE'RE BASICALLY ASKING FOR   
JUST ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH     
OF HEIGHT VARIANCE FROM THE     

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:10.768
JUST ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH     
OF HEIGHT VARIANCE FROM THE     
SEVEN TO SEVEN AND A QUARTER    

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.671
OF HEIGHT VARIANCE FROM THE     
SEVEN TO SEVEN AND A QUARTER    
RISER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO    

00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:20.745
SEVEN TO SEVEN AND A QUARTER    
RISER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO    
MAKE A MUCH WIDER AND MUCH LESS 

00:08:20.747 --> 00:08:24.950
RISER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO    
MAKE A MUCH WIDER AND MUCH LESS 
STEEP ANGLE AND DEFINITELY A    

00:08:24.952 --> 00:08:28.686
MAKE A MUCH WIDER AND MUCH LESS 
STEEP ANGLE AND DEFINITELY A    
MUCH SAFER STAIRCASE.           

00:08:28.688 --> 00:08:29.921
STEEP ANGLE AND DEFINITELY A    
MUCH SAFER STAIRCASE.           
THE WHOLE IDEA IS JUST TO MAKE  

00:08:29.923 --> 00:08:32.156
MUCH SAFER STAIRCASE.           
THE WHOLE IDEA IS JUST TO MAKE  
THIS A LOT SAFER.               

00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:36.728
THE WHOLE IDEA IS JUST TO MAKE  
THIS A LOT SAFER.               
THIS IS THE MAIN STAIRS BETWEEN 

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.596
THIS A LOT SAFER.               
THIS IS THE MAIN STAIRS BETWEEN 
THE MAIN FLOOR AND THE BASEMENT 

00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:38.263
THIS IS THE MAIN STAIRS BETWEEN 
THE MAIN FLOOR AND THE BASEMENT 
WHICH GETS USED HUNDREDS        

00:08:38.265 --> 00:08:40.498
THE MAIN FLOOR AND THE BASEMENT 
WHICH GETS USED HUNDREDS        
OF TIMES EVERY SINGLE DAY AND   

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.635
WHICH GETS USED HUNDREDS        
OF TIMES EVERY SINGLE DAY AND   
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT SO 

00:08:44.637 --> 00:08:47.505
OF TIMES EVERY SINGLE DAY AND   
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT SO 
THAT THIS IS LIKE A LOT SAFER   

00:08:47.507 --> 00:08:48.839
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT SO 
THAT THIS IS LIKE A LOT SAFER   
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE THAT USE THE 

00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:55.480
THAT THIS IS LIKE A LOT SAFER   
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE THAT USE THE 
STAIR AND THE I WOULD JUST AS

OF THE PROPOSED.                
YEAH, WE JUST IN THE LAST       
MEETING THEY SAID IT WOULD NOT

YEAH, WE JUST IN THE LAST       
MEETING THEY SAID IT WOULD NOT  
BE REQUIRED TO BE ON FIRE       

00:11:16.522 --> 00:11:17.388
MEETING THEY SAID IT WOULD NOT  
BE REQUIRED TO BE ON FIRE       
EXCEPT SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE    

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.225
BE REQUIRED TO BE ON FIRE       
EXCEPT SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE    
THE TWO SO WE REMOVED THAT IN   

00:11:21.227 --> 00:11:22.060
EXCEPT SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE    
THE TWO SO WE REMOVED THAT IN   
ORDER TO MAKE IT MORE OPEN TO

BUT IF IT'S IF THE LANDING IS   

00:17:21.287 --> 00:17:22.053
LANDING TO MY SECOND FROM ME.   
BUT IF IT'S IF THE LANDING IS   
CUT IN HALF, THE LANDING IS     

00:17:22.055 --> 00:17:24.788
BUT IF IT'S IF THE LANDING IS   
CUT IN HALF, THE LANDING IS     
TURNED INTO TWO STEPS.          

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.189
CUT IN HALF, THE LANDING IS     
TURNED INTO TWO STEPS.

DOES RELATE TO THE CODE BUT     
RELATES TO THE USE OF THE THE   
LOWER LEVEL THE UNIVERSITY

00:19:00.219 --> 00:19:03.287
FOR FRATERNITIES TO HAVE SOCIAL 
EVENTS AND ONE OF THOSE         
REQUIREMENTS IS TO LIMIT ACCESS 

00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:04.221
EVENTS AND ONE OF THOSE         
REQUIREMENTS IS TO LIMIT ACCESS 
TO THE AREA WHERE THERE IS      

00:19:04.223 --> 00:19:07.892
REQUIREMENTS IS TO LIMIT ACCESS 
TO THE AREA WHERE THERE IS      
EVENT ONLY HAVE ONE DOOR IN ONE 

00:19:07.894 --> 00:19:11.362
TO THE AREA WHERE THERE IS      
EVENT ONLY HAVE ONE DOOR IN ONE 
DOOR OUT SO THAT THEY CAN       

00:19:11.364 --> 00:19:12.162
EVENT ONLY HAVE ONE DOOR IN ONE 
DOOR OUT SO THAT THEY CAN       
CONTROL THE PEOPLE COMING IN    

00:19:12.164 --> 00:19:14.031
DOOR OUT SO THAT THEY CAN

OF THAT NATURE SO THAT DOOR AT  

00:19:15.101 --> 00:19:18.535
AND OUT CHECK IDS AND THINGS    
OF THAT NATURE SO THAT DOOR AT  
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HELPS     

00:19:18.537 --> 00:19:22.172
OF THAT NATURE SO THAT DOOR AT  
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HELPS     
COMPLY WITH THAT REQUIREMENT.   

00:19:22.174 --> 00:19:22.940
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HELPS     
COMPLY WITH THAT REQUIREMENT.   
SO AGAIN, NOT A                 

00:19:22.942 --> 00:19:23.674
COMPLY WITH THAT REQUIREMENT.   
SO AGAIN, NOT A                 
CODE REQUIREMENT BUT I'M JUST   

00:19:23.676 --> 00:19:28.579
SO AGAIN, NOT A                 
CODE REQUIREMENT BUT I'M JUST   
SHARING ANOTHER REASON WHY THAT 

00:19:28.581 --> 00:19:29.580
CODE REQUIREMENT BUT I'M JUST   
SHARING ANOTHER REASON WHY THAT

DWIGHT WAS EXPLAINING THE WHOLE 
GOAL IS TO MOVE ALL OF THE

LEVEL AND THE WAY THAT THEY     

00:19:43.362 --> 00:19:44.295
SOCIAL EVENTS TO THAT LOWER     
LEVEL AND THE WAY THAT THEY     
MEET THAT CODE IS ACTUALLY THE  

00:19:44.297 --> 00:19:47.731
LEVEL AND THE WAY THAT THEY     
MEET THAT CODE IS ACTUALLY THE  
STUDENTS MOST OF THE STUDENTS   

00:19:47.733 --> 00:19:51.201
MEET THAT CODE IS ACTUALLY THE  
STUDENTS MOST OF THE STUDENTS   
THAT ARE GUESTS WILL COME IN    

00:19:51.203 --> 00:19:52.069
STUDENTS MOST OF THE STUDENTS   
THAT ARE GUESTS WILL COME IN    
THROUGH THE OUTSIDE DOOR THAT   

00:19:52.071 --> 00:19:52.803
THAT ARE GUESTS WILL COME IN    
THROUGH THE OUTSIDE DOOR THAT   
THEY COME AROUND THE OUTSIDE    

00:19:52.805 --> 00:19:55.772
THROUGH THE OUTSIDE DOOR THAT   
THEY COME AROUND THE OUTSIDE    
AND COME IN THAT DOOR SO THEY   

00:19:55.774 --> 00:19:58.108
THEY COME AROUND THE OUTSIDE    
AND COME IN THAT DOOR SO THEY   
CAN MANAGE THAT ACCESS THAT WAY 

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.309
AND COME IN THAT DOOR SO THEY   
CAN MANAGE THAT ACCESS THAT WAY 
.

.                               
SO IT'S I GUESS IT'S NOT A      
CODE REASON BUT IT'S JUST A     

00:20:03.749 --> 00:20:06.383
SO IT'S I GUESS IT'S NOT A      
CODE REASON BUT IT'S JUST A     
SUPPORTS THE USE OF IT.         

00:20:06.385 --> 00:20:07.317
CODE REASON BUT IT'S JUST A     
SUPPORTS THE USE OF IT.         
SORRY, BUT THAT BEING SAID,     

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:10.153

00:21:10.282 --> 00:21:11.082
BASEMENT THAT INCLUDED NEW      
BATHROOMS IN THE BASEMENT.      
IT WOULD BE HOPE THAT THOSE     

00:21:11.084 --> 00:21:13.884
BATHROOMS IN THE BASEMENT.      
IT WOULD BE HOPE THAT THOSE

IT WOULD BE HOPE THAT THOSE     
WOULD BE ADDED AT SOME POINT IN

00:21:14.287 --> 00:21:14.952
WOULD BE ADDED AT SOME POINT IN 
THE FUTURE.                     
>> BUT THAT'S STILL THAT'S      

00:21:14.954 --> 00:21:15.419

YOU MADE THIS ONE STEP THEN     

00:29:07.126 --> 00:29:07.991
FOR ONE LANE FOR ONE STEP IF    
YOU MADE THIS ONE STEP THEN     
THIS THEN THE RAILING COULD GO  

00:29:07.993 --> 00:29:11.528
YOU MADE THIS ONE STEP THEN     
THIS THEN THE RAILING COULD GO  
THERE TEN INCHES GOING THAT WAY 

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.462
THIS THEN THE RAILING COULD GO  
THERE TEN INCHES GOING THAT WAY 
THE RAIN IS COMING DOWN THE

VARIANCE PLAN WOULD BE APPROVED 

00:37:01.433 --> 00:37:02.365
AND NOW IF WE SAY THE PROPOSED  
VARIANCE PLAN WOULD BE APPROVED 
WITH THE STEP IN THE HANDRAIL,  

00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:05.134
VARIANCE PLAN WOULD BE APPROVED 
WITH THE STEP IN THE HANDRAIL,  
IT'S ALL BEING IN THE SAME      

00:37:05.136 --> 00:37:05.535
WITH THE STEP IN THE HANDRAIL,  
IT'S ALL BEING IN THE SAME

IT WOULD NEED THAT SO IT        

00:37:06.404 --> 00:37:08.971
RIGHT AREA.                     
IT WOULD NEED THAT SO IT        
WOULDN'T NEED TO COME IN FOR    

00:37:08.973 --> 00:37:09.339
IT WOULD NEED THAT SO IT        
WOULDN'T NEED TO COME IN FOR    
REVIEW.                         

00:37:09.341 --> 00:37:10.273
WOULDN'T NEED TO COME IN FOR    
REVIEW.                         
WE WOULD EVALUATE IT IF THERE   

00:37:10.275 --> 00:37:13.142
REVIEW.                         
WE WOULD EVALUATE IT IF THERE   
WERE NON-COMPLIANT ELEMENTS     

00:37:13.144 --> 00:37:17.013
WE WOULD EVALUATE IT IF THERE   
WERE NON-COMPLIANT ELEMENTS     
FOUND THE APPLICANT WOULD BE IN 

00:37:17.015 --> 00:37:18.014
WERE NON-COMPLIANT ELEMENTS     
FOUND THE APPLICANT WOULD BE IN 
FORMED AND THEN IF THEY WOULD

FOUND THE APPLICANT WOULD BE IN 
FORMED AND THEN IF THEY WOULD   
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME    

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.784
FORMED AND THEN IF THEY WOULD   
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME    
BACK TO THE BOARD SO SO THE     

00:37:21.786 --> 00:37:25.588
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME    
BACK TO THE BOARD SO SO THE     
CITY DIDN'T DENHA THE CHANCE TO 

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:25.989
BACK TO THE BOARD SO SO THE     
CITY DIDN'T DENHA THE CHANCE TO 
REVIEW THIS.                    

00:37:25.991 --> 00:37:26.790
CITY DIDN'T DENHA THE CHANCE TO 
REVIEW THIS.                    
>> THIS WAS THIS WAS REVIEWED

AND WHAT THEY'RE APPEALING NOW  
IS THAT THEY'RE APPEALING WHAT  
WE FOUND ON PLAN REVIEW.        

00:37:34.032 --> 00:37:36.566
IS THAT THEY'RE APPEALING WHAT  
WE FOUND ON PLAN REVIEW.        
SO THEY SUBMITTED THIS THEIR    

00:37:36.568 --> 00:37:37.300
WE FOUND ON PLAN REVIEW.        
SO THEY SUBMITTED THIS THEIR    
PROPOSED PLAN WAS SORT OF THEIR 

00:37:37.302 --> 00:37:40.903
SO THEY SUBMITTED THIS THEIR    
PROPOSED PLAN WAS SORT OF THEIR 
LAST WHAT THEY GAVE US LAST     

00:37:40.905 --> 00:37:41.571
PROPOSED PLAN WAS SORT OF THEIR

TIME SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED    

00:37:41.573 --> 00:37:44.607
LAST WHAT THEY GAVE US LAST     
TIME SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED    
THE VARIANCE FROM THE WIDTH AND 

00:37:44.609 --> 00:37:45.275
TIME SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED    
THE VARIANCE FROM THE WIDTH AND 
RAZOR HEIGHT AND THAT WAS THE   

00:37:45.277 --> 00:37:48.277
THE VARIANCE FROM THE WIDTH AND 
RAZOR HEIGHT AND THAT WAS THE   
PART THAT WAS EVALUATED.        

00:37:48.279 --> 00:37:49.212
RAZOR HEIGHT AND THAT WAS THE   
PART THAT WAS EVALUATED.        
IF THERE'S A RECONFIGURATION WE 

00:37:49.214 --> 00:37:52.715
PART THAT WAS EVALUATED.        
IF THERE'S A RECONFIGURATION WE 
JUST NEED TO LOOK AT TO DO A    

00:37:52.717 --> 00:37:53.449
IF THERE'S A RECONFIGURATION WE 
JUST NEED TO LOOK AT TO DO A    
PLAN REVIEW AND THEN WHEN THE   

00:37:53.451 --> 00:37:55.518
JUST NEED TO LOOK AT TO DO A    
PLAN REVIEW AND THEN WHEN THE   
ELEMENTS THAT COMPLIANT ARE     

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.352
PLAN REVIEW AND THEN WHEN THE   
ELEMENTS THAT COMPLIANT ARE     
IDENTIFIED THEN IT WOULD COME   

00:37:56.354 --> 00:37:59.989
ELEMENTS THAT COMPLIANT ARE     
IDENTIFIED THEN IT WOULD COME   
BACK HERE IT IN ORDER FOR US TO 

00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:03.893
IDENTIFIED THEN IT WOULD COME   
BACK HERE IT IN ORDER FOR US TO 
BE ABLE TO INSPECT IT TO TO GET 

00:38:03.895 --> 00:38:07.763
BACK HERE IT IN ORDER FOR US TO 
BE ABLE TO INSPECT IT TO TO GET 
A TO GET A CLEAR APPROVAL IF IF 

00:38:07.765 --> 00:38:08.431
BE ABLE TO INSPECT IT TO TO GET 
A TO GET A CLEAR APPROVAL IF IF 
THE VARIANCE IS APPROVED WE     

00:38:08.433 --> 00:38:11.167
A TO GET A CLEAR APPROVAL IF IF 
THE VARIANCE IS APPROVED WE     
JUST NEED SOMETHING TO GO BY AS 

00:38:11.169 --> 00:38:11.768
THE VARIANCE IS APPROVED WE     
JUST NEED SOMETHING TO GO BY AS 
IT IS RIGHT NOW WITH THE        

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:12.469
JUST NEED SOMETHING TO GO BY AS 
IT IS RIGHT NOW WITH THE        
CHANGES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.    

00:38:12.471 --> 00:38:15.037
IT IS RIGHT NOW WITH THE        
CHANGES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.    
I'D HAVE NO WAY TO INSTRUCT     

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:18.308
CHANGES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.    
I'D HAVE NO WAY TO INSTRUCT     
SOMEBODY IN THE FIELD OF HOW TO 

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.108
I'D HAVE NO WAY TO INSTRUCT     
SOMEBODY IN THE FIELD OF HOW TO

SOMEBODY IN THE FIELD OF HOW TO 
INSPECT WHAT WAS APPROVED.      
>> SO ON YOUR REVIEW, DID YOU   

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:23.313
INSPECT WHAT WAS APPROVED.      
>> SO ON YOUR REVIEW, DID YOU   
GUYS CATCH THE HANDRAIL         

00:38:23.315 --> 00:38:23.780
>> SO ON YOUR REVIEW, DID YOU   
GUYS CATCH THE HANDRAIL         
SCENARIO?                       

00:38:23.782 --> 00:38:26.516
GUYS CATCH THE HANDRAIL         
SCENARIO?                       
>> I DON'T KNOW.                

00:38:26.518 --> 00:38:27.584
SCENARIO?                       
>> I DON'T KNOW.                
ALL THAT I KNOW IS THAT THE     

00:38:27.586 --> 00:38:28.250
>> I DON'T KNOW.                
ALL THAT I KNOW IS THAT THE     
ONLY VARIANCE THAT WAS          

00:38:28.252 --> 00:38:31.354
ALL THAT I KNOW IS THAT THE     
ONLY VARIANCE THAT WAS          
REQUESTED WAS THE WAS THIS SURE 

00:38:31.356 --> 00:38:34.557
ONLY VARIANCE THAT WAS          
REQUESTED WAS THE WAS THIS SURE 
TO BE READ FACTNESS HANDRAIL?   

00:38:34.559 --> 00:38:35.324
REQUESTED WAS THE WAS THIS SURE 
TO BE READ FACTNESS HANDRAIL?   
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.             

00:38:35.326 --> 00:38:41.364
TO BE READ FACTNESS HANDRAIL?   
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.             
BUT I MEAN I ASK A              

00:38:41.366 --> 00:38:42.097
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.             
BUT I MEAN I ASK A              
CODE INTERPRETATION QUESTION    

00:38:42.099 --> 00:38:42.865
BUT I MEAN I ASK A              
CODE INTERPRETATION QUESTION    
AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS     

00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:45.701
CODE INTERPRETATION QUESTION    
AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS     
BUILDING CODE OR HOUSING        

00:38:45.703 --> 00:38:46.803
AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS     
BUILDING CODE OR HOUSING        
CODE BUT WHERE THAT DOOR IS AT  

00:38:46.805 --> 00:38:50.206
BUILDING CODE OR HOUSING        
CODE BUT WHERE THAT DOOR IS AT  
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS THAT'S A  

00:38:50.208 --> 00:38:53.977
CODE BUT WHERE THAT DOOR IS AT  
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS THAT'S A  
FIRE RATED STAIRWAY THAT GOES   

00:38:53.979 --> 00:38:58.047
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS THAT'S A  
FIRE RATED STAIRWAY THAT GOES   
UP AND THEN GOES DOWN IS OPEN   

00:38:58.049 --> 00:38:58.514
FIRE RATED STAIRWAY THAT GOES   
UP AND THEN GOES DOWN IS OPEN   
ON THE BOTTOM.                  

00:38:58.516 --> 00:38:58.848
UP AND THEN GOES DOWN IS OPEN   
ON THE BOTTOM.                  
YEAH.                           

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.251
ON THE BOTTOM.                  
YEAH.                           
SO THAT IF IT'S FIRE RATED THEN 

00:39:01.253 --> 00:39:01.917
YEAH.                           
SO THAT IF IT'S FIRE RATED THEN 
THIS PLAN DOESN'T WORK.         

00:39:01.919 --> 00:39:05.154
SO THAT IF IT'S FIRE RATED THEN 
THIS PLAN DOESN'T WORK.         
OK, SO THERE'S A STAIRWAY AND   

00:39:05.156 --> 00:39:09.025
THIS PLAN DOESN'T WORK.         
OK, SO THERE'S A STAIRWAY AND   
THERE'S FIRE RATED DOORS AT     

00:39:09.027 --> 00:39:09.759
OK, SO THERE'S A STAIRWAY AND   
THERE'S FIRE RATED DOORS AT     
EVERY LEVEL AND THE DOOR THAT'S 

00:39:09.761 --> 00:39:13.095
THERE'S FIRE RATED DOORS AT     
EVERY LEVEL AND THE DOOR THAT'S 
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS IS A   

00:39:13.097 --> 00:39:13.729
EVERY LEVEL AND THE DOOR THAT'S 
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS IS A   
FIRE RATED DOOR INCIDENT.       

00:39:13.731 --> 00:39:16.665
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS IS A   
FIRE RATED DOOR INCIDENT.       
NO I'M SORRY I'VE GOT GLASS AND 

00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:17.600
FIRE RATED DOOR INCIDENT.       
NO I'M SORRY I'VE GOT GLASS AND 
NO WELL IT WAS AGAIN THAT'S     

00:39:17.602 --> 00:39:21.004
NO I'M SORRY I'VE GOT GLASS AND 
NO WELL IT WAS AGAIN THAT'S     
PROBABLY A A NONCONFORMING USE  

00:39:21.006 --> 00:39:24.940
NO WELL IT WAS AGAIN THAT'S     
PROBABLY A A NONCONFORMING USE  
BASED ON THE TIME THAT IT HAS   

00:39:24.942 --> 00:39:25.375
PROBABLY A A NONCONFORMING USE  
BASED ON THE TIME THAT IT HAS   
BEEN THERE.                     

00:39:25.377 --> 00:39:26.242
BASED ON THE TIME THAT IT HAS   
BEEN THERE.                     
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT   

00:39:26.244 --> 00:39:28.311
BEEN THERE.                     
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT   
IS IF WE REMOVE THAT DOOR, ARE  

00:39:28.313 --> 00:39:32.281
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT   
IS IF WE REMOVE THAT DOOR, ARE  
WE CREATING ARE WE VIOLATING    

00:39:32.283 --> 00:39:32.882
IS IF WE REMOVE THAT DOOR, ARE  
WE CREATING ARE WE VIOLATING    
SOME OTHER CODE OR CREATING     

00:39:32.884 --> 00:39:36.352
WE CREATING ARE WE VIOLATING    
SOME OTHER CODE OR CREATING     
ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO 

00:39:36.354 --> 00:39:39.588
SOME OTHER CODE OR CREATING     
ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO 
SOLVE OR IS THERE A WAY TO KEEP 

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.623
ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO 
SOLVE OR IS THERE A WAY TO KEEP 
THE DOOR AND WE JUST TAKE THE   

00:39:40.625 --> 00:39:44.093
SOLVE OR IS THERE A WAY TO KEEP 
THE DOOR AND WE JUST TAKE THE   
BUT YOUR VARIANCE CAN DESTROYED 

00:39:44.095 --> 00:39:44.927
THE DOOR AND WE JUST TAKE THE   
BUT YOUR VARIANCE CAN DESTROYED 
THE FIRE RATING IN THAT ROOM IN 

00:39:44.929 --> 00:39:48.497
BUT YOUR VARIANCE CAN DESTROYED 
THE FIRE RATING IN THAT ROOM IN 
THAT ROOM BY HAVING NO RETURN.  

00:39:48.499 --> 00:39:49.399
THE FIRE RATING IN THAT ROOM IN 
THAT ROOM BY HAVING NO RETURN.  
BUT THE MAIN IS THIS ER THE     

00:39:49.401 --> 00:39:52.434
THAT ROOM BY HAVING NO RETURN.  
BUT THE MAIN IS THIS ER THE     
MAIN POWER THAT COMES IN AT THE 

00:39:52.436 --> 00:39:55.638
BUT THE MAIN IS THIS ER THE     
MAIN POWER THAT COMES IN AT THE 
TOP AT THE TOP IS REVERSE FOR   

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.573
MAIN POWER THAT COMES IN AT THE 
TOP AT THE TOP IS REVERSE FOR   
THE FIRST PART NOT ENOUGH IT    

00:39:56.575 --> 00:39:57.240
TOP AT THE TOP IS REVERSE FOR   
THE FIRST PART NOT ENOUGH IT    
WOULDN'T THE BASEMENT WOULD     

00:39:57.242 --> 00:39:59.876
THE FIRST PART NOT ENOUGH IT    
WOULDN'T THE BASEMENT WOULD     
HAVE TO BE A FIRE IN THE        

00:39:59.878 --> 00:40:00.343
WOULDN'T THE BASEMENT WOULD     
HAVE TO BE A FIRE IN THE        
ASSEMBLY.                       

00:40:00.345 --> 00:40:00.944
HAVE TO BE A FIRE IN THE        
ASSEMBLY.                       
SO WE'RE GETTING TO A POINT
