I THINK THAT IS A WONDERFUL     
PROCESS.                        
BUT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE     

00:55:32.194 --> 00:55:33.126
PROCESS.                        
BUT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE     
THAT WE FOLLOW NOT ONLY THE     

00:55:33.128 --> 00:55:34.761
BUT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE     
THAT WE FOLLOW NOT ONLY THE     
CITY POLICIES BUT WE ALSO HAVE  

00:55:34.763 --> 00:55:39.032
THAT WE FOLLOW NOT ONLY THE     
CITY POLICIES BUT WE ALSO HAVE  
FEDERAL PROCUREMENT POLICIES WE

FEDERAL PROCUREMENT POLICIES WE 
HAVE TO ADHERE TO AS WELL.      

00:55:39.968 --> 00:55:41.000
FEDERAL PROCUREMENT POLICIES WE 
HAVE TO ADHERE TO AS WELL.      
SO THAT DOES ADD A LITTLE BIT   

00:55:41.002 --> 00:55:42.435
HAVE TO ADHERE TO AS WELL.      
SO THAT DOES ADD A LITTLE BIT   
IN OUR DELAY.                   

00:55:42.437 --> 00:55:43.303
SO THAT DOES ADD A LITTLE BIT   
IN OUR DELAY.                   
BUT THAT'S WHY GETTING SOME     

00:55:43.305 --> 00:55:44.037

SO I CAN I                      

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:23.136
           IT IS WELL HARD AND  
I WISH WE COULD MOVE UP         

00:57:35.583 --> 00:57:37.584
                        OUR     
DEADLINE AND I THINK THE ONLY   
WAY THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO    

00:57:37.586 --> 00:57:38.451
DEADLINE AND I THINK THE ONLY   
WAY THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO    
MOVE THAT UP IS IF OUR GRANT    

00:57:38.453 --> 00:57:39.085
WAY THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO    
MOVE THAT UP IS IF OUR GRANT    
AGREEMENT AMENDMENT IS DONE     

00:57:39.087 --> 00:57:39.353
MOVE THAT UP IS IF OUR GRANT    
AGREEMENT AMENDMENT IS DONE     
SOONER.                         

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:40.286
AGREEMENT AMENDMENT IS DONE     
SOONER.                         
BUT AGAIN, REMEMBER WE DO STILL 

00:57:40.288 --> 00:57:40.954
SOONER.                         
BUT AGAIN, REMEMBER WE DO STILL 
HAVE CONSTRUCTION WINDOWS IN    

00:57:40.956 --> 00:57:41.488
BUT AGAIN, REMEMBER WE DO STILL 
HAVE CONSTRUCTION WINDOWS IN    
THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.          

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:42.288
HAVE CONSTRUCTION WINDOWS IN    
THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.          
WE CAN'T DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE 

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:42.956
THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.          
WE CAN'T DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE 
THE PAVEMENT HAS TO BE WARM     

00:57:42.958 --> 00:57:43.690
WE CAN'T DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE 
THE PAVEMENT HAS TO BE WARM     
ENOUGH FOR NEW TREATMENTS TO    

00:57:43.692 --> 00:57:44.558
THE PAVEMENT HAS TO BE WARM     
ENOUGH FOR NEW TREATMENTS TO    
ACTUALLY ADHERE TO PAVEMENT     

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:44.724
ENOUGH FOR NEW TREATMENTS TO    
ACTUALLY ADHERE TO PAVEMENT     
PARKING.

ACTUALLY ADHERE TO PAVEMENT     
PARKING.                        
SO IF IF IT'S TOO HOT, IF IT'S  

00:57:45.527 --> 00:57:46.126
PARKING.                        
SO IF IF IT'S TOO HOT, IF IT'S  
TOO COLD, YOU KNOW THOSE        

00:57:46.128 --> 00:57:46.860
SO IF IF IT'S TOO HOT, IF IT'S  
TOO COLD, YOU KNOW THOSE        
CONDITIONS HAVE TO BE JUST      

00:57:46.862 --> 00:57:47.661

RIGHT IN ORDER FOR THAT TO WORK 
AS WELL.                        
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE     

00:57:48.664 --> 00:57:49.529
AS WELL.                        
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE     
WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF TO TRY TO 

00:57:49.531 --> 00:57:50.130
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE     
WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF TO TRY TO 
GET THOSE TREATMENTS OUT AND
