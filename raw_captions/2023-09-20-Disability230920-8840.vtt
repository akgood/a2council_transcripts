NEVER TO CHARGE A PERSON FOR    
USING IT SO BUSINESS TO         
CONSUMER SHOULD ALWAYS BE FREE  

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:17.388
USING IT SO BUSINESS TO         
CONSUMER SHOULD ALWAYS BE FREE  
AND I THINK THAT                

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.826
CONSUMER SHOULD ALWAYS BE FREE  
AND I THINK THAT                
PHILOSOPHICALLY MAXIMIZES       

00:27:20.828 --> 00:27:21.693
AND I THINK THAT                
PHILOSOPHICALLY MAXIMIZES       
ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY TO AS  

00:27:21.695 --> 00:27:24.096
PHILOSOPHICALLY MAXIMIZES       
ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY TO AS  
MANY PEOPLE NEED HELP AND IT    

00:27:24.098 --> 00:27:24.763
ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY TO AS  
MANY PEOPLE NEED HELP AND IT    
MAXIMIZES THE PAY OF THE        

00:27:24.765 --> 00:27:25.497
MANY PEOPLE NEED HELP AND IT    
MAXIMIZES THE PAY OF THE        
CAREGIVER THAT I DON&apos;T FEEL     

00:27:25.499 --> 00:27:28.166
MAXIMIZES THE PAY OF THE        
CAREGIVER THAT I DON&apos;T FEEL     
CARE COMPANIES SHOULD TAKE THE  

00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:28.900
CAREGIVER THAT I DON&apos;T FEEL     
CARE COMPANIES SHOULD TAKE THE  
MONEY OUT OF THE CAREGIVERS     

00:27:28.902 --> 00:27:29.567
CARE COMPANIES SHOULD TAKE THE  
MONEY OUT OF THE CAREGIVERS     
POCKET BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE DOING    

00:27:29.569 --> 00:27:30.235
MONEY OUT OF THE CAREGIVERS     
POCKET BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE DOING    
NINETEEN POINT NINE PERCENT     

00:27:30.237 --> 00:27:31.870
POCKET BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE DOING    
NINETEEN POINT NINE PERCENT     
OF THE WORK.                    

00:27:31.872 --> 00:27:32.771
NINETEEN POINT NINE PERCENT     
OF THE WORK.                    
SO BUT THAT CREATES A CHALLENGE 

00:27:32.773 --> 00:27:33.505
OF THE WORK.                    
SO BUT THAT CREATES A CHALLENGE 
IN HOW DO YOU BUILD SOMETHING   

00:27:33.507 --> 00:27:33.906
SO BUT THAT CREATES A CHALLENGE 
IN HOW DO YOU BUILD SOMETHING   
SUSTAINABLE.                    

00:27:33.908 --> 00:27:36.275
IN HOW DO YOU BUILD SOMETHING   
SUSTAINABLE.                    
SO I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS   

00:27:36.277 --> 00:27:37.142
SUSTAINABLE.                    
SO I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS   
WE&apos;VE BEEN DOING IS WE OPERATE

00:28:11.845 --> 00:28:14.278
ARE TO VARYING DEGREES.         
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT LET&apos;S    
SAY FROM AN EMPLOYER            

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:14.846
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT LET&apos;S    
SAY FROM AN EMPLOYER            
PERSPECTIVE RIGHT.              

00:28:14.848 --> 00:28:15.513
SAY FROM AN EMPLOYER            
PERSPECTIVE RIGHT.              
LIKE THE WAY CHILDCARE WAS IN A 

00:28:15.515 --> 00:28:21.987
PERSPECTIVE RIGHT.              
LIKE THE WAY CHILDCARE WAS IN A 
COUNTRY TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO 

00:28:35.034 --> 00:28:37.035
NO ONE WAS COVERING IT.         
BUT PEOPLE REALIZE THAT         
EMPLOYEE CAREGIVERS ARE GOING   

00:28:37.037 --> 00:28:37.769
BUT PEOPLE REALIZE THAT         
EMPLOYEE CAREGIVERS ARE GOING   
TO BURN OUT AND LEAVE THE       

00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:38.436
EMPLOYEE CAREGIVERS ARE GOING   
TO BURN OUT AND LEAVE THE       
WORKFORCE IN LARGE NUMBERS IF   

00:28:38.438 --> 00:28:39.104
TO BURN OUT AND LEAVE THE       
WORKFORCE IN LARGE NUMBERS IF   
THEY&apos;RE MANAGING CARE FOR

THEY&apos;RE MANAGING CARE FOR       
SOMEONE AT HOME.                
SO WE THINK THERE&apos;S AN          

00:28:40.307 --> 00:28:40.972
SOMEONE AT HOME.                
SO WE THINK THERE&apos;S AN          
OPPORTUNITY FOR A NICE SHIFT    

00:28:40.974 --> 00:28:41.640
SO WE THINK THERE&apos;S AN          
OPPORTUNITY FOR A NICE SHIFT    
WHERE IF WE BUILD A SCALE       

00:28:41.642 --> 00:28:42.273
OPPORTUNITY FOR A NICE SHIFT    
WHERE IF WE BUILD A SCALE       
PLATFORM WE&apos;VE ALREADY STARTED  

00:28:42.275 --> 00:28:43.074
WHERE IF WE BUILD A SCALE       
PLATFORM WE&apos;VE ALREADY STARTED  
GETTING IN BOUNDS FROM LARGE    

00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:43.775
PLATFORM WE&apos;VE ALREADY STARTED  
GETTING IN BOUNDS FROM LARGE    
COMPANIES THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE 

00:28:43.777 --> 00:28:44.576
GETTING IN BOUNDS FROM LARGE    
COMPANIES THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO HELP THEM WITH COVERING      

00:28:44.578 --> 00:28:45.243
COMPANIES THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO HELP THEM WITH COVERING      
THEIR EMPLOYEES SO PEOPLE CAN   

00:28:45.245 --> 00:28:45.911
TO HELP THEM WITH COVERING      
THEIR EMPLOYEES SO PEOPLE CAN   
STAY GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.        

00:28:45.913 --> 00:28:46.511
THEIR EMPLOYEES SO PEOPLE CAN   
STAY GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.        
SO THAT&apos;S ONE POSSIBLE LONG     

00:28:46.513 --> 00:28:47.245
STAY GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.        
SO THAT&apos;S ONE POSSIBLE LONG     
TERM SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY AND   

00:28:47.247 --> 00:28:47.913
SO THAT&apos;S ONE POSSIBLE LONG     
TERM SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY AND   
THEN HEALTH INSURANCE IS ONE    

00:28:47.915 --> 00:28:48.480
TERM SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY AND   
THEN HEALTH INSURANCE IS ONE    
OF THE BIG ONES.                

00:28:48.482 --> 00:28:49.147
THEN HEALTH INSURANCE IS ONE    
OF THE BIG ONES.                
SO IN A LOT OF POPULATIONS WE   

00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.947
OF THE BIG ONES.                
SO IN A LOT OF POPULATIONS WE   
SERVE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE      

00:28:49.949 --> 00:28:50.582
SO IN A LOT OF POPULATIONS WE   
SERVE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE      
OLDER POPULATION ABOUT SIXTY    

00:28:50.584 --> 00:28:51.249
SERVE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE      
OLDER POPULATION ABOUT SIXTY    
FIVE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE IS NOW

OLDER POPULATION ABOUT SIXTY    
FIVE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE IS NOW  
OVER HALF OF THE WAY MEDICARE   

00:28:52.052 --> 00:28:52.717
FIVE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE IS NOW  
OVER HALF OF THE WAY MEDICARE

COUNTRY PRIVATELY MANAGED       
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS AND    

00:28:55.822 --> 00:28:59.357
COUNTRY PRIVATELY MANAGED       
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS AND    
THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN

THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN  
KEEPING PEOPLE OUT              

00:28:59.893 --> 00:29:00.625

STAY HEALTHY AND AVOID E.R.     
VISITS.                         
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER KIND          

00:29:04.631 --> 00:29:07.632
VISITS.                         
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER KIND          
OF SOURCE THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO

BUT I THINK THERE IS A LONGER   

00:29:13.974 --> 00:29:14.705
OF LIKE THREE OR FOUR YEARS.    
BUT I THINK THERE IS A LONGER   
TERM SUSTAINABILITY QUESTION    

00:29:14.707 --> 00:29:15.306
BUT I THINK THERE IS A LONGER   
TERM SUSTAINABILITY QUESTION    
THAT WE&apos;LL HAVE TO KIND         

00:29:15.308 --> 00:29:15.974
TERM SUSTAINABILITY QUESTION    
THAT WE&apos;LL HAVE TO KIND         
OF ADDRESS HOW WE CAN KIND

OF KEEP THE SERVICE ALIVE.      
BUT ON A COUNTERINTUITIVE NOTE, 

00:29:19.145 --> 00:29:21.546
OF KEEP THE SERVICE ALIVE.      
BUT ON A COUNTERINTUITIVE NOTE, 
AS THE MORE THE PLATFORM GROWS  

00:29:21.548 --> 00:29:22.614
BUT ON A COUNTERINTUITIVE NOTE, 
AS THE MORE THE PLATFORM GROWS  
,THE MORE PEOPLE ARE JUMPING

00:34:28.388 --> 00:34:31.522
CARE.

THE ONLY REASON WE ACTUALLY     
EVEN HAD TO INTRODUCE A         
VARIABILITY IN PRICING IS THAT  

00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:01.452
EVEN HAD TO INTRODUCE A         
VARIABILITY IN PRICING IS THAT  
WE REALIZED FOR SHORT           

00:35:01.454 --> 00:35:02.253
VARIABILITY IN PRICING IS THAT  
WE REALIZED FOR SHORT           
APPOINTMENTS LIKE TWO OR THREE

00:35:12.698 --> 00:35:13.398
APPOINTMENT.                    
SO THEN WE STARTED INTRODUCING  
DYNAMIC PRICING WHERE IT MIGHT  

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.467
SO THEN WE STARTED INTRODUCING  
DYNAMIC PRICING WHERE IT MIGHT  
GET CLOSER TO TWICE AN HOUR IF  

00:35:16.469 --> 00:35:17.502
DYNAMIC PRICING WHERE IT MIGHT  
GET CLOSER TO TWICE AN HOUR IF  
YOU HAD TO DO A SHORT SHIFT.    

00:35:17.504 --> 00:35:18.269
GET CLOSER TO TWICE AN HOUR IF  
YOU HAD TO DO A SHORT SHIFT.    
BUT WE GENERALLY FOUND THE

I&apos;D SAY EVEN IN SOME HIGH COST  

00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:22.073
THAT.                           
I&apos;D SAY EVEN IN SOME HIGH COST  
AREAS LIKE EVEN BOSTON,         

00:35:22.075 --> 00:35:24.843

BE A REASONABLE IF THE STUDENT  

00:35:28.681 --> 00:35:29.347
PROGRAM THAT 15 TO 20 SEEMED TO 
BE A REASONABLE IF THE STUDENT  
COULD GET THAT BECAUSE THEY     

00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:31.615
BE A REASONABLE IF THE STUDENT  
COULD GET THAT BECAUSE THEY     
WERE GETTING SUPPLEMENTAL KIND  

00:35:31.617 --> 00:35:32.383
COULD GET THAT BECAUSE THEY     
WERE GETTING SUPPLEMENTAL KIND

THAT OUR MATH ON THE AGENCY     

00:37:24.163 --> 00:37:24.962
IF WE START SPENDING A LOT ON   
THAT OUR MATH ON THE AGENCY     
BASED INSURANCE WAS THAT TO GET 

00:37:24.964 --> 00:37:27.899
THAT OUR MATH ON THE AGENCY     
BASED INSURANCE WAS THAT TO GET
