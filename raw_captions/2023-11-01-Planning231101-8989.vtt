WHAT I SEE AS THE TOTAL FOR THE 
BROWNFIELD WAS TWO POINT SEVEN  

00:37:33.935 --> 00:37:37.403
WHAT I SEE AS THE TOTAL FOR THE 
BROWNFIELD WAS TWO POINT SEVEN  
MILLION AND THERE IS A MILLION  

00:37:37.405 --> 00:37:40.840
BROWNFIELD WAS TWO POINT SEVEN  
MILLION AND THERE IS A MILLION  
GOING INTO THE AFFORDABLE       

00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:41.674
MILLION AND THERE IS A MILLION  
GOING INTO THE AFFORDABLE       
HOUSING FUND BY VIRTUE OF THERE 

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:44.710
GOING INTO THE AFFORDABLE       
HOUSING FUND BY VIRTUE OF THERE 
BEING A BROWNFIELD AGREEMENT.   

00:37:44.712 --> 00:37:48.881
HOUSING FUND BY VIRTUE OF THERE 
BEING A BROWNFIELD AGREEMENT.   
BUT I AM NOT CLEAR ON THAT.     

00:37:48.883 --> 00:37:52.151
BEING A BROWNFIELD AGREEMENT.   
BUT I AM NOT CLEAR ON THAT.     
AND SO I WAS HOPING THAT IF MR. 

00:37:52.153 --> 00:37:55.521
BUT I AM NOT CLEAR ON THAT.     
AND SO I WAS HOPING THAT IF MR. 
DELACOURT IS ANYWHERE WITHIN    

00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:56.556
AND SO I WAS HOPING THAT IF MR. 
DELACOURT IS ANYWHERE WITHIN    
THE RANGE OF MY VOICE HE WOULD  

00:37:56.558 --> 00:37:59.992
DELACOURT IS ANYWHERE WITHIN

SUBSTANTIVE REMODEL NOT JUST    
LIKE A FACADE CHANGE BUT IF     

01:49:45.896 --> 01:49:46.695
SUBSTANTIVE REMODEL NOT JUST    
LIKE A FACADE CHANGE BUT IF

LIKE A FACADE CHANGE BUT IF     
THEY WERE CHANGING SQUARE       
FOOTAGE OR FOR PLAN OR          

01:49:47.297 --> 01:49:50.199
THEY WERE CHANGING SQUARE

SOMETHING THAT WOULD REQUIRE

01:49:51.001 --> 01:49:54.136
SOMETHING THAT WOULD REQUIRE    
THE THE SECOND STORY AND THAT   
THAT WOULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT 

01:49:54.138 --> 01:49:54.803
THE THE SECOND STORY AND THAT   
THAT WOULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT 
BUT THAT COULD HAPPEN TODAY.    

01:49:54.805 --> 01:49:58.273
THAT WOULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT 
BUT THAT COULD HAPPEN TODAY.    
IT&apos;S NOT A FACTOR OF ONE.       

01:49:58.275 --> 01:49:58.974
BUT THAT COULD HAPPEN TODAY.    
IT&apos;S NOT A FACTOR OF ONE.       
IT COULD HAPPEN DEPENDING ON    

01:49:58.976 --> 01:50:02.077

01:51:47.816 --> 01:51:51.052
.                               
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.   
FIRST I WANTED TO JUST ADDRESS  

01:51:51.054 --> 01:51:52.120
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.   
FIRST I WANTED TO JUST ADDRESS  
ONE OTHER THING WHICH IS TO BE  

01:51:52.122 --> 01:51:54.756
FIRST I WANTED TO JUST ADDRESS  
ONE OTHER THING WHICH IS TO BE  
CLEAR THAT ZONING AND OCCUPANCY 

01:51:54.758 --> 01:51:55.223
ONE OTHER THING WHICH IS TO BE  
CLEAR THAT ZONING AND OCCUPANCY 
ARE SEPARATE.                   

01:51:55.225 --> 01:51:56.357
CLEAR THAT ZONING AND OCCUPANCY 
ARE SEPARATE.                   
SO ZONING JUST AS KIND OF WHAT  

01:51:56.359 --> 01:51:58.827
ARE SEPARATE.                   
SO ZONING JUST AS KIND OF WHAT  
USES WHETHER THAT SPACE IS      

01:51:58.829 --> 01:51:59.761
SO ZONING JUST AS KIND OF WHAT  
USES WHETHER THAT SPACE IS      
RENTED OR OWNER OCCUPIED IS IS  

01:51:59.763 --> 01:52:02.931
USES WHETHER THAT SPACE IS      
RENTED OR OWNER OCCUPIED IS IS  
NOT TIED TO THE ZONING ITSELF.  

01:52:02.933 --> 01:52:04.065
RENTED OR OWNER OCCUPIED IS IS  
NOT TIED TO THE ZONING ITSELF.  
SO THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS TO  

01:52:04.067 --> 01:52:05.733
NOT TIED TO THE ZONING ITSELF.  
SO THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS TO  
KNOW KIND OF WITHIN OUR ZONING  

01:52:05.735 --> 01:52:06.067
SO THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS TO  
KNOW KIND OF WITHIN OUR ZONING  
CODE .                          

01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:09.904
KNOW KIND OF WITHIN OUR ZONING  
CODE .                          
THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK    

01:52:09.906 --> 01:52:10.705
CODE .                          
THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK

01:52:10.707 --> 01:52:11.506
THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK    
THE REST ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT

THINGS IN THINGS OUT SO DEED

01:52:29.793 --> 01:52:33.060
RESTRICTIONS ARE HOW CAN YOU    
HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW THAT IS  
OR IS NOT TIED TO ZONING ZONING 

01:52:33.062 --> 01:52:37.265
HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW THAT IS  
OR IS NOT TIED TO ZONING ZONING 
VIEWS RESTRICTIONS AS SOMETHING 

01:52:37.267 --> 01:52:38.032
OR IS NOT TIED TO ZONING ZONING 
VIEWS RESTRICTIONS AS SOMETHING 
THAT YOU DO OUTSIDE AND         

01:52:38.034 --> 01:52:41.503
VIEWS RESTRICTIONS AS SOMETHING 
THAT YOU DO OUTSIDE AND         
SEPARATE THE ZONING IS THE CITY 

01:52:41.505 --> 01:52:42.370
THAT YOU DO OUTSIDE AND         
SEPARATE THE ZONING IS THE CITY 
REGULATING THE LAND AND A DEED  

01:52:42.372 --> 01:52:45.373
SEPARATE THE ZONING IS THE CITY 
REGULATING THE LAND AND A DEED  
RESTRICTION UNLESS THE CITY     

01:52:45.375 --> 01:52:46.240
REGULATING THE LAND AND A DEED  
RESTRICTION UNLESS THE CITY     
PUTS IT THERE BUT A DEED        

01:52:46.242 --> 01:52:49.377
RESTRICTION UNLESS THE CITY     
PUTS IT THERE BUT A DEED        
RESTRICTION IS SOMETHING THAT A 

01:52:49.379 --> 01:52:50.112
PUTS IT THERE BUT A DEED        
RESTRICTION IS SOMETHING THAT A 
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER PUTS ON  

01:52:50.114 --> 01:52:50.779
RESTRICTION IS SOMETHING THAT A 
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER PUTS ON  
THEIR OWN LAND OR SOMEHOW       

01:52:50.781 --> 01:52:53.448
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER PUTS ON  
THEIR OWN LAND OR SOMEHOW       
NEGOTIATES GREECE TO PUT ON     

01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:53.748
THEIR OWN LAND OR SOMEHOW       
NEGOTIATES GREECE TO PUT ON     
OTHERS.                         

01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:57.318
NEGOTIATES GREECE TO PUT ON     
OTHERS.                         
AND SO THAT IS A FOR AN OWNER   

01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:00.088
OTHERS.                         
AND SO THAT IS A FOR AN OWNER   
OF THAT PROPERTY I ASSUME THEY  

01:53:00.090 --> 01:53:01.022
AND SO THAT IS A FOR AN OWNER   
OF THAT PROPERTY I ASSUME THEY  
WOULD NEED TO COMPLY WITH BOTH  

01:53:01.024 --> 01:53:04.526
OF THAT PROPERTY I ASSUME THEY  
WOULD NEED TO COMPLY WITH BOTH  
BUT THE CITY JUST STAYS IN OUR  

01:53:04.528 --> 01:53:07.996
WOULD NEED TO COMPLY WITH BOTH  
BUT THE CITY JUST STAYS IN OUR  
LANE OF ZONING AND ZONING.      

01:53:07.998 --> 01:53:08.863
BUT THE CITY JUST STAYS IN OUR  
LANE OF ZONING AND ZONING.      
WE DO NOT ENFORCE DEED          

01:53:08.865 --> 01:53:09.331
LANE OF ZONING AND ZONING.      
WE DO NOT ENFORCE DEED          
RESTRICTIONS.                   

01:53:09.333 --> 01:53:12.567
WE DO NOT ENFORCE DEED          
RESTRICTIONS.                   
WE DON&apos;T REQUIRE THEM GENERALLY 

01:53:12.569 --> 01:53:15.837
RESTRICTIONS.                   
WE DON&apos;T REQUIRE THEM GENERALLY 
ACQUIRE THEM.                   

01:53:15.839 --> 01:53:16.971
WE DON&apos;T REQUIRE THEM GENERALLY 
ACQUIRE THEM.                   
SO THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING FROM 

01:53:16.973 --> 01:53:17.706
ACQUIRE THEM.                   
SO THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING FROM 
THE PROPERTY OWNERS PERSPECTIVE 

01:53:17.708 --> 01:53:19.241
SO THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING FROM 
THE PROPERTY OWNERS PERSPECTIVE 
IT WOULD BE ABOVE BEYOND BUT WE 

01:53:19.243 --> 01:53:23.077
THE PROPERTY OWNERS PERSPECTIVE 
IT WOULD BE ABOVE BEYOND BUT WE 
VIEW THEM AS A SELF SELF        

01:53:23.079 --> 01:53:27.115
IT WOULD BE ABOVE BEYOND BUT WE 
VIEW THEM AS A SELF SELF        
CREATED , SELF IMPOSED AND AND  

01:53:27.117 --> 01:53:28.015
VIEW THEM AS A SELF SELF        
CREATED , SELF IMPOSED AND AND  
IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE  

01:53:28.017 --> 01:53:31.052
CREATED , SELF IMPOSED AND AND  
IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE  
TO ABIDE BY THEM THAT IS FINE.  

01:53:31.054 --> 01:53:32.120
IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE  
TO ABIDE BY THEM THAT IS FINE.  
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT&apos;S IN  

01:53:32.122 --> 01:53:35.390
TO ABIDE BY THEM THAT IS FINE.  
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT&apos;S IN  
MY MIND IS LIKE THAT THEY HAVE  

01:53:35.392 --> 01:53:35.990
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT&apos;S IN  
MY MIND IS LIKE THAT THEY HAVE  
THAT AGREEMENT THAT THEY        

01:53:35.992 --> 01:53:38.593
MY MIND IS LIKE THAT THEY HAVE  
THAT AGREEMENT THAT THEY        
ENTERED INTO I&apos;M TRYING TO      

01:53:38.595 --> 01:53:39.327
THAT AGREEMENT THAT THEY        
ENTERED INTO I&apos;M TRYING TO      
THINK THROUGH IF WE DO REZONE   

01:53:39.329 --> 01:53:43.098
ENTERED INTO I&apos;M TRYING TO      
THINK THROUGH IF WE DO REZONE   
IT, DOES IT POSE ANY ADDITIONAL 

01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:43.998
THINK THROUGH IF WE DO REZONE   
IT, DOES IT POSE ANY ADDITIONAL 
BURDEN OR HARDSHIP LIKE OR IS   

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.667
IT, DOES IT POSE ANY ADDITIONAL 
BURDEN OR HARDSHIP LIKE OR IS   
IT GOING TO LEAD TO SOME        

01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:49.704
BURDEN OR HARDSHIP LIKE OR IS   
IT GOING TO LEAD TO SOME        
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE          

01:53:49.706 --> 01:53:50.371
IT GOING TO LEAD TO SOME        
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE          
OF BECAUSE OF NONCONFORMITY     

01:53:50.373 --> 01:53:56.211
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE          
OF BECAUSE OF NONCONFORMITY     
THAT ARE                        

01:53:56.679 --> 01:54:01.182
         CREATED ?              
I&apos;M I I CAN&apos;T REALLY SAY I

THAT&apos;S ONE STANDARDS AND SO     
MAYBE THEY CAN&apos;T REDEVELOP AS

BUT WHAT I FOUND WEIRD IS THAT  
IT CREATES A LITTLE DONUT       
AROUND A CREDIT UNION WHICH I   

02:01:14.251 --> 02:01:15.050
IT CREATES A LITTLE DONUT       
AROUND A CREDIT UNION WHICH I

02:01:18.188 --> 02:01:21.722
DON&apos;T THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE 
A DONUT AROUND A CREDIT UNION   
AND THAT IT LEAVES JUST THE THE 

02:01:21.724 --> 02:01:22.524
A DONUT AROUND A CREDIT UNION   
AND THAT IT LEAVES JUST THE THE 
POST OFFICE KIND OF HANGING OUT

IS A WORKABLE ZONING DISTRICT?  
I CERTAINLY THINK IT&apos;S A        
WORKABLE ZONING DISTRICT.       

02:11:01.603 --> 02:11:02.536
I CERTAINLY THINK IT&apos;S A        
WORKABLE ZONING DISTRICT.       
WE&apos;RE HEARING A LOT OF CALLS    

02:11:02.538 --> 02:11:05.139
WORKABLE ZONING DISTRICT.       
WE&apos;RE HEARING A LOT OF CALLS    
SORT OF THE I WANT TO DOUBLE    

02:11:05.141 --> 02:11:05.740

DO I HAVE MY CONCEPT?           

02:11:06.742 --> 02:11:09.744

DO I HAVE MY CONCEPT?           
DO I HAVE MY SKETCH RIGHT.      

02:11:09.746 --> 02:11:10.744
DO I HAVE MY CONCEPT?           
DO I HAVE MY SKETCH RIGHT.      
WE WE&apos;RE GETTING MORE OF THOSE  

02:11:10.746 --> 02:11:13.347
DO I HAVE MY SKETCH RIGHT.      
WE WE&apos;RE GETTING MORE OF THOSE  
COMPARED TO OTHER DISTRICTS BUT 

02:11:13.349 --> 02:11:14.147
WE WE&apos;RE GETTING MORE OF THOSE  
COMPARED TO OTHER DISTRICTS BUT 
THE OTHER DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN   

02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:16.450
COMPARED TO OTHER DISTRICTS BUT 
THE OTHER DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN   
AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER.        

02:11:16.452 --> 02:11:20.320
THE OTHER DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN   
AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER.        
IT&apos;S MY PERSONAL OPINION THAT   

02:11:20.322 --> 02:11:21.188
AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER.        
IT&apos;S MY PERSONAL OPINION THAT

IT&apos;S VERY MUCH CORRIDOR BY      
CORRIDOR.                       
I THINK THE STADIUM CORRIDOR AS 

02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:28.162
CORRIDOR.                       
I THINK THE STADIUM CORRIDOR AS 
AN EXAMPLE THERE&apos;S NOT A LOT    

02:11:28.164 --> 02:11:28.829
I THINK THE STADIUM CORRIDOR AS 
AN EXAMPLE THERE&apos;S NOT A LOT    
OF VACANCIES ON STADIUM         

02:11:28.831 --> 02:11:29.162
AN EXAMPLE THERE&apos;S NOT A LOT    
OF VACANCIES ON STADIUM         
BOULEVARD.                      

02:11:29.164 --> 02:11:32.633

02:14:34.082 --> 02:14:34.815
SOMETHING THAT MR LEO JUST SAID 
WHICH IS THAT DEVELOPMENT ALONG 
THIS CORRIDOR IS LIKELY TO BE   

02:14:34.817 --> 02:14:38.218
WHICH IS THAT DEVELOPMENT ALONG 
THIS CORRIDOR IS LIKELY TO BE   
SLOW BECAUSE IT IS SLOW NOW AND 

02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:41.855
THIS CORRIDOR IS LIKELY TO BE   
SLOW BECAUSE IT IS SLOW NOW AND 
I WANT TO REAFFIRM THAT THE THE

02:14:44.726 --> 02:14:45.492
I WANT TO REAFFIRM THAT THE THE 
BUILDING THAT YOU ARE IN PARTS  
OF THE BUILDING ITSELF IT       

02:14:45.494 --> 02:14:49.897
BUILDING THAT YOU ARE IN PARTS  
OF THE BUILDING ITSELF IT       
CURRENTLY IF YOUR LANDLORD      

02:14:49.899 --> 02:14:52.632
OF THE BUILDING ITSELF IT       
CURRENTLY IF YOUR LANDLORD      
WANTED TO SELL THAT BUILDING OR 

02:14:52.634 --> 02:14:53.400
CURRENTLY IF YOUR LANDLORD      
WANTED TO SELL THAT BUILDING OR 
DEVELOP IT THEMSELVES, THEY     

02:14:53.402 --> 02:14:57.204
WANTED TO SELL THAT BUILDING OR 
DEVELOP IT THEMSELVES, THEY     
COULD BUILD A FIFTY FIVE FOOT   

02:14:57.206 --> 02:14:57.671
DEVELOP IT THEMSELVES, THEY     
COULD BUILD A FIFTY FIVE FOOT   
STRUCTURE.                      

02:14:57.673 --> 02:15:00.674
COULD BUILD A FIFTY FIVE FOOT   
STRUCTURE.                      
SO THAT&apos;S LIKE A FOUR STOREY    

02:15:00.676 --> 02:15:00.941
STRUCTURE.                      
SO THAT&apos;S LIKE A FOUR STOREY    
ISH.                            

02:15:00.943 --> 02:15:01.341
SO THAT&apos;S LIKE A FOUR STOREY    
ISH.                            
RIGHT.                          

02:15:01.343 --> 02:15:05.545
ISH.                            
RIGHT.                          
IF IF THEY WANTED TO DO THAT    

02:15:05.547 --> 02:15:06.146
RIGHT.                          
IF IF THEY WANTED TO DO THAT    
THEY COULD ALREADY DO IT.       

02:15:06.148 --> 02:15:09.315
IF IF THEY WANTED TO DO THAT    
THEY COULD ALREADY DO IT.       
SO THE REZONING WILL MAKE PARTS 

02:15:09.317 --> 02:15:10.017
THEY COULD ALREADY DO IT.       
SO THE REZONING WILL MAKE PARTS 
OF THAT BUILDING POSSIBLE.      

02:15:10.019 --> 02:15:13.220
SO THE REZONING WILL MAKE PARTS 
OF THAT BUILDING POSSIBLE.      
IT&apos;LL GIVE AN EXTRA TWO STOREY  

02:15:13.222 --> 02:15:16.489
OF THAT BUILDING POSSIBLE.      
IT&apos;LL GIVE AN EXTRA TWO STOREY  
TO STORIES PROBABLY FOUR PARTS  

02:15:16.491 --> 02:15:17.524
IT&apos;LL GIVE AN EXTRA TWO STOREY  
TO STORIES PROBABLY FOUR PARTS  
OF THAT BUILDING AND THEN PARTS 

02:15:17.526 --> 02:15:21.095
TO STORIES PROBABLY FOUR PARTS  
OF THAT BUILDING AND THEN PARTS 
OF THE PARKING LOT COULD GO AS  

02:15:21.097 --> 02:15:21.895
OF THAT BUILDING AND THEN PARTS 
OF THE PARKING LOT COULD GO AS  
HIGH AS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY  

02:15:21.897 --> 02:15:22.229
OF THE PARKING LOT COULD GO AS  
HIGH AS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY  
FEET.                           

02:15:22.231 --> 02:15:24.965
HIGH AS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY  
FEET.                           
AND SO I THINK SOMETIMES IT&apos;S   

02:15:24.967 --> 02:15:28.469
FEET.                           
AND SO I THINK SOMETIMES IT&apos;S   
AN ASSUMPTION THAT WHEN WE      

02:15:28.471 --> 02:15:29.403
AND SO I THINK SOMETIMES IT&apos;S   
AN ASSUMPTION THAT WHEN WE      
PERMIT GREATER HEIGHT WE ARE    

02:15:29.405 --> 02:15:31.071
AN ASSUMPTION THAT WHEN WE      
PERMIT GREATER HEIGHT WE ARE    
CREATING WEALTH AND WE ARE      

02:15:31.073 --> 02:15:35.509
PERMIT GREATER HEIGHT WE ARE    
CREATING WEALTH AND WE ARE      
ADDING VALUE.                   

02:15:35.511 --> 02:15:39.179
CREATING WEALTH AND WE ARE      
ADDING VALUE.                   
NOW IF IF THERE WERE A DESIRE   

02:15:39.181 --> 02:15:42.649
ADDING VALUE.                   
NOW IF IF THERE WERE A DESIRE   
TO MAXIMIZE VALUE THROUGH       

02:15:42.651 --> 02:15:43.516
NOW IF IF THERE WERE A DESIRE   
TO MAXIMIZE VALUE THROUGH       
GREATER HEIGHT LIKE I SAID      

02:15:43.518 --> 02:15:46.653
TO MAXIMIZE VALUE THROUGH       
GREATER HEIGHT LIKE I SAID      
FIFTY FIVE FEET IS ALREADY      

02:15:46.655 --> 02:15:50.457
GREATER HEIGHT LIKE I SAID      
FIFTY FIVE FEET IS ALREADY      
PERMITTED AND WE&apos;RE NOT SEEING  

02:15:50.459 --> 02:15:51.191
FIFTY FIVE FEET IS ALREADY      
PERMITTED AND WE&apos;RE NOT SEEING  
YOUR LANDLORD SELLING THE       

02:15:51.193 --> 02:15:51.992
PERMITTED AND WE&apos;RE NOT SEEING  
YOUR LANDLORD SELLING THE       
BUILDING AND WANTING TO DEVELOP 

02:15:51.994 --> 02:15:56.997
YOUR LANDLORD SELLING THE       
BUILDING AND WANTING TO DEVELOP 
IT IN THOSE TERMS REZONING IT   

02:15:56.999 --> 02:15:57.731
BUILDING AND WANTING TO DEVELOP 
IT IN THOSE TERMS REZONING IT   
TOOK ONE WHAT EFFECT DOES IT    

02:15:57.733 --> 02:15:58.065
IT IN THOSE TERMS REZONING IT   
TOOK ONE WHAT EFFECT DOES IT    
HAVE?                           

02:15:58.067 --> 02:16:02.168
TOOK ONE WHAT EFFECT DOES IT    
HAVE?                           
WELL IT DOES PERMIT GREATER     

02:16:02.170 --> 02:16:04.537
HAVE?                           
WELL IT DOES PERMIT GREATER     
HEIGHT BUT IT MAKES SOME IN     

02:16:04.539 --> 02:16:05.505
WELL IT DOES PERMIT GREATER     
HEIGHT BUT IT MAKES SOME IN     
SOME WAYS IT MAKES DEVELOPMENT  

02:16:05.507 --> 02:16:08.642
HEIGHT BUT IT MAKES SOME IN     
SOME WAYS IT MAKES DEVELOPMENT  
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CURRENTLY   

02:16:08.644 --> 02:16:09.309
SOME WAYS IT MAKES DEVELOPMENT  
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CURRENTLY   
BECAUSE OF THE PARKING          

02:16:09.311 --> 02:16:12.779
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CURRENTLY   
BECAUSE OF THE PARKING          
RESTRICTIONS.                   

02:16:12.781 --> 02:16:13.179
BECAUSE OF THE PARKING          
RESTRICTIONS.                   
RIGHT.                          

02:16:13.181 --> 02:16:16.483
RESTRICTIONS.                   
RIGHT.                          
IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE KIND  

02:16:16.485 --> 02:16:17.350
RIGHT.                          
IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE KIND  
SURFACE PARKING THAT&apos;S THERE    

02:16:17.352 --> 02:16:21.554
IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE KIND  
SURFACE PARKING THAT&apos;S THERE    
AND SO IF YOU WERE GOING TO     

02:16:21.556 --> 02:16:22.222
SURFACE PARKING THAT&apos;S THERE    
AND SO IF YOU WERE GOING TO     
HAVE A TALLER BUILDING YOU ARE  

02:16:22.224 --> 02:16:24.424
AND SO IF YOU WERE GOING TO     
HAVE A TALLER BUILDING YOU ARE  
GOING TO NEED MORE PARKING      

02:16:24.426 --> 02:16:25.325
HAVE A TALLER BUILDING YOU ARE  
GOING TO NEED MORE PARKING      
ESPECIALLY IF IT&apos;S MIXED USE    

02:16:25.327 --> 02:16:26.059
GOING TO NEED MORE PARKING      
ESPECIALLY IF IT&apos;S MIXED USE    
AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE     

02:16:26.061 --> 02:16:29.062
ESPECIALLY IF IT&apos;S MIXED USE    
AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE     
GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD PARKING

AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE     
GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD PARKING

YOUR BUILDING AND THAT&apos;S        
EXPENSIVE.                      
SO WE ARE ADDING HEIGHT WHICH   

02:16:36.471 --> 02:16:40.340
EXPENSIVE.                      
SO WE ARE ADDING HEIGHT WHICH   
POSSIBLY ADDS WEALTH BUT WE ARE 

02:16:40.342 --> 02:16:41.141
SO WE ARE ADDING HEIGHT WHICH   
POSSIBLY ADDS WEALTH BUT WE ARE 
THEN TAKING SOME OF THAT WEALTH 

02:16:41.143 --> 02:16:44.310
POSSIBLY ADDS WEALTH BUT WE ARE

BACK BY MAKING THE PARKING MORE 

02:16:44.312 --> 02:16:45.145
THEN TAKING SOME OF THAT WEALTH

EXPENSIVE SO I DON&apos;T HAVE A

SIXTY TWO SO IT&apos;S NOT THE       
YOUNGEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD  
BUT IT IS WORKING VERY WELL.    

02:17:07.036 --> 02:17:10.837
YOUNGEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD  
BUT IT IS WORKING VERY WELL.    
IT HAS A NUMBER OF VERY VIBRANT

BUT IT IS WORKING VERY WELL.    
IT HAS A NUMBER OF VERY VIBRANT 
SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO I DO    

02:17:14.109 --> 02:17:14.908
IT HAS A NUMBER OF VERY VIBRANT 
SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO I DO    
NOT KNOW WHAT THE CALCULUS YOUR 

02:17:14.910 --> 02:17:18.111
SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO I DO    
NOT KNOW WHAT THE CALCULUS YOUR 
LANDLORD MIGHT BE MAKING.

I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD BE 
AND SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR        
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT COULD

CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT COULD       
HAPPEN IF THAT IF THE BUILDING

OR YOU JUST WANTED US TO KNOW   
IT?                             
I MEAN IT HAS CONSEQUENCES IN   

02:44:26.306 --> 02:44:27.238

EITHER DIRECTION IS ALL I KIND  
OF POINT OUT.                   
AND SO IT&apos;S TRYING TO MEASURE   

02:44:31.111 --> 02:44:31.877
OF POINT OUT.                   
AND SO IT&apos;S TRYING TO MEASURE   
THE LESSER OF THE TWO IDEALS    

02:44:31.879 --> 02:44:34.947
AND SO IT&apos;S TRYING TO MEASURE   
THE LESSER OF THE TWO IDEALS    
OF WATER OPTIONS.               

02:44:34.949 --> 02:44:38.683
THE LESSER OF THE TWO IDEALS    
OF WATER OPTIONS.               
AH, I THINK THIS ONE WE HAVE    

02:44:38.685 --> 02:44:39.351
OF WATER OPTIONS.               
AH, I THINK THIS ONE WE HAVE    
SOME KIND OF LEGAL BINDING      

02:44:39.353 --> 02:44:40.085
AH, I THINK THIS ONE WE HAVE    
SOME KIND OF LEGAL BINDING      
ADDITIONAL STUFF THAT WE CAN    

02:44:40.087 --> 02:44:42.721
SOME KIND OF LEGAL BINDING      
ADDITIONAL STUFF THAT WE CAN    
REFERENCE.                      

02:44:42.723 --> 02:44:43.789
ADDITIONAL STUFF THAT WE CAN    
REFERENCE.                      
IT WOULD BE VERY HESITANT       

02:44:43.791 --> 02:44:46.725
REFERENCE.                      
IT WOULD BE VERY HESITANT       
RELATIVE TO REMOVING A REQUEST  

02:44:46.727 --> 02:44:47.592
IT WOULD BE VERY HESITANT       
RELATIVE TO REMOVING A REQUEST  
BECAUSE THE PLAN COULD BE AND   

02:44:47.594 --> 02:44:51.062
RELATIVE TO REMOVING A REQUEST  
BECAUSE THE PLAN COULD BE AND   
PLANNING A DRIVE THROUGH OR     

02:44:51.064 --> 02:44:55.033
BECAUSE THE PLAN COULD BE AND   
PLANNING A DRIVE THROUGH OR     
SOMETHING ELSE IT DOESN&apos;T SEEM  

02:44:55.035 --> 02:44:55.767
PLANNING A DRIVE THROUGH OR     
SOMETHING ELSE IT DOESN&apos;T SEEM  
LIKE THAT&apos;S THE CASE AND WITHIN 

02:44:55.769 --> 02:44:59.437
SOMETHING ELSE IT DOESN&apos;T SEEM  
LIKE THAT&apos;S THE CASE AND WITHIN 
THE PDR OR OFFICE IT WOULD BE A 

02:44:59.439 --> 02:45:00.172
LIKE THAT&apos;S THE CASE AND WITHIN 
THE PDR OR OFFICE IT WOULD BE A 
SPECIAL EXCEPTION WHICH COULD   

02:45:00.174 --> 02:45:00.739
THE PDR OR OFFICE IT WOULD BE A 
SPECIAL EXCEPTION WHICH COULD   
EASILY BE DENIED FOR DRIVE      

02:45:00.741 --> 02:45:03.174
SPECIAL EXCEPTION WHICH COULD   
EASILY BE DENIED FOR DRIVE      
THROUGH SPECIFICALLY BUT IT     

02:45:03.176 --> 02:45:06.879
EASILY BE DENIED FOR DRIVE      
THROUGH SPECIFICALLY BUT IT     
DOES LEAVE A WEIRD EXTRA PARCEL 

02:45:06.881 --> 02:45:07.613
THROUGH SPECIFICALLY BUT IT     
DOES LEAVE A WEIRD EXTRA PARCEL 
ALSO TO THE SOUTH.              

02:45:07.615 --> 02:45:11.015
DOES LEAVE A WEIRD EXTRA PARCEL 
ALSO TO THE SOUTH.              
BUT I THINK IN THE I&apos;M ALSO     

02:45:11.017 --> 02:45:11.783
ALSO TO THE SOUTH.              
BUT I THINK IN THE I&apos;M ALSO     
JUST MEASURING IT ON PROCESSING 

02:45:11.785 --> 02:45:14.453
BUT I THINK IN THE I&apos;M ALSO     
JUST MEASURING IT ON PROCESSING 
COST AND THEN IF WE DO INCLUDE  

02:45:14.455 --> 02:45:15.320
JUST MEASURING IT ON PROCESSING 
COST AND THEN IF WE DO INCLUDE  
IT WE MAY ADD PROCESSING COST   

02:45:15.322 --> 02:45:18.723
COST AND THEN IF WE DO INCLUDE  
IT WE MAY ADD PROCESSING COST   
EVEN IT&apos;S NOT GRANTED THAT COST 

02:45:18.725 --> 02:45:22.193
IT WE MAY ADD PROCESSING COST   
EVEN IT&apos;S NOT GRANTED THAT COST 
WILL GET ROLLED UP SOMEWHERE IN 

02:45:22.195 --> 02:45:22.894
EVEN IT&apos;S NOT GRANTED THAT COST 
WILL GET ROLLED UP SOMEWHERE IN 
A FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT    

02:45:22.896 --> 02:45:23.629
WILL GET ROLLED UP SOMEWHERE IN 
A FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT    
PROJECT AND WE KNOW WHERE THAT  

02:45:23.631 --> 02:45:26.565
A FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT    
PROJECT AND WE KNOW WHERE THAT  
COST GOES AND IT&apos;S IT&apos;S TO WHO  

02:45:26.567 --> 02:45:29.835
PROJECT AND WE KNOW WHERE THAT  
COST GOES AND IT&apos;S IT&apos;S TO WHO  
OCCUPIES THESE PROPERTIES.      

02:45:29.837 --> 02:45:30.869
COST GOES AND IT&apos;S IT&apos;S TO WHO  
OCCUPIES THESE PROPERTIES.      
AND SO THE OBJECTIVE FOR        

02:45:30.871 --> 02:45:31.736
OCCUPIES THESE PROPERTIES.      
AND SO THE OBJECTIVE FOR        
HOUSING IS TO MAYBE REDUCE SOME 

02:45:31.738 --> 02:45:34.473
AND SO THE OBJECTIVE FOR        
HOUSING IS TO MAYBE REDUCE SOME 
OF THOSE COSTS AND HOPE THAT IT 

02:45:34.475 --> 02:45:35.240
HOUSING IS TO MAYBE REDUCE SOME 
OF THOSE COSTS AND HOPE THAT IT 
REDUCES THE OVERALL COST        

02:45:35.242 --> 02:45:37.075
OF THOSE COSTS AND HOPE THAT IT 
REDUCES THE OVERALL COST        
OF HOUSING.                     

02:45:37.077 --> 02:45:38.210
REDUCES THE OVERALL COST        
OF HOUSING.
