OUT THROUGH THE CITY.           
IT'S REALLY GOING TO COME DOWN  

01:24:50.551 --> 01:24:50.882
OUT THROUGH THE CITY.           
IT'S REALLY GOING TO COME DOWN  
TO MONEY.                       

01:24:50.884 --> 01:24:52.150
IT'S REALLY GOING TO COME DOWN  
TO MONEY.                       
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT BOILS     

01:24:52.152 --> 01:24:53.085
TO MONEY.                       
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT BOILS     
DOWN TO AND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY  

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:56.487
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT BOILS     
DOWN TO AND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY  
GOING TO LOSE IN THIS WILL BE   

01:24:56.489 --> 01:24:57.322
DOWN TO AND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY  
GOING TO LOSE IN THIS WILL BE   
THAT THE MOST AFFORDABLE HOMES  

01:24:57.324 --> 01:25:00.792
GOING TO LOSE IN THIS WILL BE   
THAT THE MOST AFFORDABLE HOMES  
IN THE CITY, THAT'S ACTUALLY    

01:25:00.794 --> 01:25:01.593
THAT THE MOST AFFORDABLE HOMES  
IN THE CITY, THAT'S ACTUALLY    
WHAT'S GOING TO BE LOST HERE    

01:25:01.595 --> 01:25:04.529
IN THE CITY, THAT'S ACTUALLY    
WHAT'S GOING TO BE LOST HERE    
BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY GOING TO 

01:25:04.531 --> 01:25:08.333
WHAT'S GOING TO BE LOST HERE    
BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY GOING TO 
BE BOUGHT UP BY SPECULATORS AND 

01:25:08.335 --> 01:25:12.303
BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY GOING TO 
BE BOUGHT UP BY SPECULATORS AND 
AND THE END RESULT WILL BE      

01:25:12.305 --> 01:25:13.104
BE BOUGHT UP BY SPECULATORS AND 
AND THE END RESULT WILL BE      
HOMES, NOT HOMES UNLESS         

01:25:13.106 --> 01:25:16.574
AND THE END RESULT WILL BE      
HOMES, NOT HOMES UNLESS         
OF COURSE YOU GUYS GET BEHIND   

01:25:16.576 --> 01:25:17.342
HOMES, NOT HOMES UNLESS         
OF COURSE YOU GUYS GET BEHIND   
THIS PROGRAM WHICH I HIGHLY     

01:25:17.344 --> 01:25:20.612
OF COURSE YOU GUYS GET BEHIND   
THIS PROGRAM WHICH I HIGHLY     
RECOMMEND BECAUSE THESE HOMES   

01:25:20.614 --> 01:25:23.214
THIS PROGRAM WHICH I HIGHLY     
RECOMMEND BECAUSE THESE HOMES   
WOULD FIT INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 

01:25:23.216 --> 01:25:24.015
RECOMMEND BECAUSE THESE HOMES   
WOULD FIT INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 
AND THE BIGGEST IMPORTANT       

01:25:24.017 --> 01:25:28.453
WOULD FIT INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 
AND THE BIGGEST IMPORTANT       
ASPECT OF THIS IS EQUITY.       

01:25:28.455 --> 01:25:29.254
AND THE BIGGEST IMPORTANT       
ASPECT OF THIS IS EQUITY.       
THESE PEOPLE LIVING IN HERE     

01:25:29.256 --> 01:25:31.889
ASPECT OF THIS IS EQUITY.       
THESE PEOPLE LIVING IN HERE     
WILL IN FACT HAVE EQUITY AND    

01:25:31.891 --> 01:25:35.727
THESE PEOPLE LIVING IN HERE     
WILL IN FACT HAVE EQUITY AND    
HOME OWNERSHIP AND THEY WILL    

01:25:35.729 --> 01:25:36.361
WILL IN FACT HAVE EQUITY AND    
HOME OWNERSHIP AND THEY WILL    
FIT INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.     

01:25:36.363 --> 01:25:39.497
HOME OWNERSHIP AND THEY WILL    
FIT INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.     
SO I REALLY THINK THAT THAT     

01:25:39.499 --> 01:25:40.632
FIT INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.     
SO I REALLY THINK THAT THAT     
WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA AND I 

01:25:40.634 --> 01:25:43.735
SO I REALLY THINK THAT THAT     
WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA AND I 
HONESTLY THINK THAT YOU         

01:25:43.737 --> 01:25:44.369

HONESTLY THINK THAT YOU         
PROBABLY SHOULD SLOW DOWN A     

01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:46.471
HONESTLY THINK THAT YOU         
PROBABLY SHOULD SLOW DOWN A     
LITTLE BIT AND THINK ABOUT IT.  

01:25:46.473 --> 01:25:47.339
PROBABLY SHOULD SLOW DOWN A     
LITTLE BIT AND THINK ABOUT IT.

LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL ADDRESSING 
THE PLAN ARE MAKING TWO         
MISTAKES.                       

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:43.861
THE PLAN ARE MAKING TWO         
MISTAKES.                       
THE FIRST MISTAKE IS MAKING IS  

01:26:43.863 --> 01:26:47.699
MISTAKES.                       
THE FIRST MISTAKE IS MAKING IS  
IT'S GETTING TOO SPECIFIC.      

01:26:47.701 --> 01:26:48.700
THE FIRST MISTAKE IS MAKING IS  
IT'S GETTING TOO SPECIFIC.      
THE THE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS     

01:26:48.702 --> 01:26:52.003
IT'S GETTING TOO SPECIFIC.      
THE THE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS     
ROLL ISN'T TO SPECIFY EVERY     

01:26:52.005 --> 01:26:52.637
THE THE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS     
ROLL ISN'T TO SPECIFY EVERY     
LAST DETAIL ABOUT WHAT'S        

01:26:52.639 --> 01:26:53.338
ROLL ISN'T TO SPECIFY EVERY     
LAST DETAIL ABOUT WHAT'S        
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN EVERYWHERE   

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:53.738
LAST DETAIL ABOUT WHAT'S        
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN EVERYWHERE   
IN THE CITY.                    

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:56.007
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN EVERYWHERE   
IN THE CITY.                    
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SET A          

01:26:56.009 --> 01:26:56.808
IN THE CITY.                    
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SET A          
DIRECTION THAT THEN WE USE WHEN 

01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:59.611
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SET A          
DIRECTION THAT THEN WE USE WHEN 
WE'RE MAKING THE LAWS OF THE    

01:26:59.613 --> 01:27:00.478
DIRECTION THAT THEN WE USE WHEN 
WE'RE MAKING THE LAWS OF THE    
ZONING ORDINANCE AND I THINK    

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.649
WE'RE MAKING THE LAWS OF THE    
ZONING ORDINANCE AND I THINK    
TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE       

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:04.382
ZONING ORDINANCE AND I THINK    
TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE       
HEIGHTS AND UNIT DENSITY IS     

01:27:04.384 --> 01:27:07.652
TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE       
HEIGHTS AND UNIT DENSITY IS     
JUST TOO SPECIFIC TO HAVE IN    

01:27:07.654 --> 01:27:08.453
HEIGHTS AND UNIT DENSITY IS     
JUST TOO SPECIFIC TO HAVE IN    
THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND WE   

01:27:08.455 --> 01:27:09.254
JUST TOO SPECIFIC TO HAVE IN    
THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND WE   
SHOULD BE STICKING TO A BROADER 

01:27:09.256 --> 01:27:11.556
THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND WE   
SHOULD BE STICKING TO A BROADER 
NOTIONS OF THE SHAPE AND FORM   

01:27:11.558 --> 01:27:12.190
SHOULD BE STICKING TO A BROADER 
NOTIONS OF THE SHAPE AND FORM   
OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT ZONING    

01:27:12.192 --> 01:27:14.759
NOTIONS OF THE SHAPE AND FORM   
OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT ZONING    
DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS LOOK   

01:27:14.761 --> 01:27:15.093
OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT ZONING    
DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS LOOK   
LIKE.                           

01:27:15.095 --> 01:27:16.160
DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS LOOK   
LIKE.                           
I ALSO THINK THE OTHER MISTAKE  

01:27:16.162 --> 01:27:19.497
LIKE.                           
I ALSO THINK THE OTHER MISTAKE  
IT MAKES IS WE'RE MAKING THE    

01:27:19.499 --> 01:27:20.165
I ALSO THINK THE OTHER MISTAKE  
IT MAKES IS WE'RE MAKING THE    
SAME MISTAKES THAT WE'VE MADE   

01:27:20.167 --> 01:27:22.834
IT MAKES IS WE'RE MAKING THE    
SAME MISTAKES THAT WE'VE MADE   
THAT GOT US INTO THIS MESS BY   

01:27:22.836 --> 01:27:26.871
SAME MISTAKES THAT WE'VE MADE   
THAT GOT US INTO THIS MESS BY   
MAKING THINGS HARD TO BUILD AT  

01:27:26.873 --> 01:27:27.138
THAT GOT US INTO THIS MESS BY   
MAKING THINGS HARD TO BUILD AT  
ALL.                            

01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.073
MAKING THINGS HARD TO BUILD AT  
ALL.                            
IT'S HARD TO CHANGE AT ALL.     

01:27:28.075 --> 01:27:28.807
ALL.                            
IT'S HARD TO CHANGE AT ALL.     
WE'RE KEEPING THE HEIGHT LIMIT  

01:27:28.809 --> 01:27:31.076
IT'S HARD TO CHANGE AT ALL.     
WE'RE KEEPING THE HEIGHT LIMIT  
EFFECTIVELY THE SAME IF WE'RE

I'M INVOLVED IN THE STARTUP     
COMMUNITY HARBOR AND I FIRMLY   
BELIEVE THIS IS AN IDEA THAT    

02:05:50.608 --> 02:05:51.207
COMMUNITY HARBOR AND I FIRMLY   
BELIEVE THIS IS AN IDEA THAT    
COULD POTENTIALLY SATISFY       

02:05:51.209 --> 02:05:51.941
BELIEVE THIS IS AN IDEA THAT    
COULD POTENTIALLY SATISFY       
SEVERAL OBJECTIVES IN RELATION  

02:05:51.943 --> 02:05:54.744
COULD POTENTIALLY SATISFY       
SEVERAL OBJECTIVES IN RELATION  
TO THE HOUSING DENSITY AND      

02:05:54.746 --> 02:05:55.611
SEVERAL OBJECTIVES IN RELATION  
TO THE HOUSING DENSITY AND      
DEVELOPMENT AND MAYBE EVEN HAVE 

02:05:55.613 --> 02:05:57.914
TO THE HOUSING DENSITY AND      
DEVELOPMENT AND MAYBE EVEN HAVE 
A SIDE BENEFIT OF FIXING SOME   

02:05:57.916 --> 02:05:58.447
DEVELOPMENT AND MAYBE EVEN HAVE 
A SIDE BENEFIT OF FIXING SOME   
TRAFFIC ISSUES.                 

02:05:58.449 --> 02:06:02.385
A SIDE BENEFIT OF FIXING SOME   
TRAFFIC ISSUES.                 
BUT IN HAS MADE GOOD PROGRESS   

02:06:02.387 --> 02:06:05.755
TRAFFIC ISSUES.                 
BUT IN HAS MADE GOOD PROGRESS   
IN DEVELOPING A STARTUP         

02:06:05.757 --> 02:06:06.422
BUT IN HAS MADE GOOD PROGRESS   
IN DEVELOPING A STARTUP         
ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY IN      

02:06:06.424 --> 02:06:10.026
IN DEVELOPING A STARTUP         
ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY IN      
BIOTECH AND BUT THAT TAKES      

02:06:10.028 --> 02:06:10.760
ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY IN      
BIOTECH AND BUT THAT TAKES      
NURTURING ENCOURAGEMENT, LAB

BIOTECH AND BUT THAT TAKES      
NURTURING ENCOURAGEMENT, LAB    
SPACE ETC. I ALSO THINK THIS    

02:06:14.232 --> 02:06:14.963
NURTURING ENCOURAGEMENT, LAB    
SPACE ETC. I ALSO THINK THIS    
TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT COULD BE    

02:06:14.965 --> 02:06:17.232
SPACE ETC. I ALSO THINK THIS    
TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT COULD BE    
SUCCESSFUL IN PULLING A CENTER  

02:06:17.234 --> 02:06:17.933
TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT COULD BE    
SUCCESSFUL IN PULLING A CENTER  
OF GRAVITY AWAY FROM DOWNTOWN   

02:06:17.935 --> 02:06:20.803
SUCCESSFUL IN PULLING A CENTER  
OF GRAVITY AWAY FROM DOWNTOWN   
ANN ARBOR.                      

02:06:20.805 --> 02:06:21.737
OF GRAVITY AWAY FROM DOWNTOWN   
ANN ARBOR.                      
BUTTERCUP COULD BE MORE OF A    

02:06:21.739 --> 02:06:25.141
ANN ARBOR.                      
BUTTERCUP COULD BE MORE OF A    
CATALYST TO CREATING A NEW      

02:06:25.143 --> 02:06:25.842
BUTTERCUP COULD BE MORE OF A    
CATALYST TO CREATING A NEW      
DOWNTOWN VERSUS THE ONE

DEVELOPMENT THOSE DEVELOPMENTS  
AS I BELIEVE YOU NEED TO GO     

02:06:29.781 --> 02:06:32.314
DEVELOPMENT THOSE DEVELOPMENTS  
AS I BELIEVE YOU NEED TO GO     
WHERE THE POPULATION IS AND IN  

02:06:32.316 --> 02:06:33.116

WHERE THE POPULATION IS AND IN  
THIS TOWN, AS EVERYBODY KNOWS,  

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:33.783

BELIEVE THIS COULD ORGANICALLY  
SPAWN BOTH COMMERCIAL AND

RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THAT 
AREA.                           
SO YOU HAVE NORTH CAMPUS THAT

04:02:11.716 --> 04:02:15.384
DIFFERENT FRAMEWORK AND TO SAY  
THAT WHEN YOU GOT TO THE WORK

OUT.                            

04:02:15.653 --> 04:02:19.021
SESSION IT WAS JUST A REPORT    
OUT.                            
IT NEGATES THE FACT THAT YOU    

04:02:19.023 --> 04:02:19.721
OUT.                            
IT NEGATES THE FACT THAT YOU    
TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO         

04:02:19.723 --> 04:02:23.692
IT NEGATES THE FACT THAT YOU    
TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO         
RESTRICT WHAT WAS IN THE LOW    

04:02:23.694 --> 04:02:23.960

RESTRICT WHAT WAS IN THE LOW    
DENSITY.                        
SO THAT'S WHERE I AM CONFUSED   

04:02:26.831 --> 04:02:29.931
DENSITY.                        
SO THAT'S WHERE I AM CONFUSED   
BECAUSE I CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT

IT GOT IGNORED WHEN WE GAVE IT  
WHEN I GAVE IT IN SEPTEMBER AND 
AND WELL JULY SEPTEMBER,

ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S OUR     

04:02:59.130 --> 04:03:02.531

04:03:05.769 --> 04:03:06.469
OF MY QUESTION.                 
AND SO IF THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN  
IN A REGULAR MEETING BECAUSE    

04:03:06.471 --> 04:03:07.202
AND SO IF THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN  
IN A REGULAR MEETING BECAUSE    
WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DO IT   

04:03:07.204 --> 04:03:10.172
IN A REGULAR MEETING BECAUSE    
WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DO IT   
IN A PUBLIC FRAMEWORK AND       

04:03:10.174 --> 04:03:10.839
WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DO IT   
IN A PUBLIC FRAMEWORK AND       
ACTUALLY HAVE MOTIONS THAT      

04:03:10.841 --> 04:03:14.043
IN A PUBLIC FRAMEWORK AND       
ACTUALLY HAVE MOTIONS THAT      
RESTORES MY CONFIDENCE BECAUSE  

04:03:14.045 --> 04:03:14.977

RESTORES MY CONFIDENCE BECAUSE  
HAVING IT IN A WORK SESSION     

04:03:14.979 --> 04:03:16.845
RESTORES MY CONFIDENCE BECAUSE  
HAVING IT IN A WORK SESSION     
WHERE WE'RE GIVING DIRECTION    

04:03:16.847 --> 04:03:17.646
HAVING IT IN A WORK SESSION     
WHERE WE'RE GIVING DIRECTION    
BUT THEN THAT DIRECTION         

04:03:17.648 --> 04:03:21.850
WHERE WE'RE GIVING DIRECTION    
BUT THEN THAT DIRECTION         
EVAPORATES WHEN THE DOCUMENT    

04:03:21.852 --> 04:03:22.818
BUT THEN THAT DIRECTION         
EVAPORATES WHEN THE DOCUMENT    
COMES BACK THAT DOES NOT FEEL   

04:03:22.820 --> 04:03:25.554
EVAPORATES WHEN THE DOCUMENT    
COMES BACK THAT DOES NOT FEEL

05:17:27.994 --> 05:17:28.660
IN A LOT OF THINGS TO TAKE AWAY 
FROM THIS TONIGHT AND ONE THING 
THAT REALLY RESONATED WITH ME   

05:17:28.662 --> 05:17:30.628
FROM THIS TONIGHT AND ONE THING 
THAT REALLY RESONATED WITH ME   
IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO IS       

05:17:30.630 --> 05:17:31.429
THAT REALLY RESONATED WITH ME   
IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO IS       
COMMISSIONER MILLS I BELIEVE    

05:17:31.431 --> 05:17:34.665
IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO IS       
COMMISSIONER MILLS I BELIEVE    
HE'S TALKED ABOUT WE NEED TO    

05:17:34.667 --> 05:17:35.699
COMMISSIONER MILLS I BELIEVE    
HE'S TALKED ABOUT WE NEED TO    
CONVERGE ON A DEFINITION OF LOW 

05:17:35.701 --> 05:17:36.434
HE'S TALKED ABOUT WE NEED TO    
CONVERGE ON A DEFINITION OF LOW 
DENSITY HOUSING AND IT SEEMS    

05:17:36.436 --> 05:17:38.836
CONVERGE ON A DEFINITION OF LOW 
DENSITY HOUSING AND IT SEEMS    
LIKE A LOT OF THE CONFUSION,    

05:17:38.838 --> 05:17:39.871
DENSITY HOUSING AND IT SEEMS    
LIKE A LOT OF THE CONFUSION,    
DIFFERENT VOICES FROM THE PAST  

05:17:39.873 --> 05:17:43.274
LIKE A LOT OF THE CONFUSION,    
DIFFERENT VOICES FROM THE PAST  
FIVE HOURS IS THE CONFUSION     

05:17:43.276 --> 05:17:43.674
DIFFERENT VOICES FROM THE PAST  
FIVE HOURS IS THE CONFUSION     
AROUND THAT.                    

05:17:43.676 --> 05:17:47.144
FIVE HOURS IS THE CONFUSION     
AROUND THAT.                    
AND I DO SUPPORT THE IDEA       

05:17:47.146 --> 05:17:47.978
AROUND THAT.                    
AND I DO SUPPORT THE IDEA       
OF USING VISUALS OR EVEN A      

05:17:47.980 --> 05:17:50.314
AND I DO SUPPORT THE IDEA       
OF USING VISUALS OR EVEN A      
VALUE LIKE VALUES BASED         

05:17:50.316 --> 05:17:53.951
OF USING VISUALS OR EVEN A      
VALUE LIKE VALUES BASED         
COMMUNICATION METHOD WITH THE   

05:17:53.953 --> 05:17:54.718
VALUE LIKE VALUES BASED         
COMMUNICATION METHOD WITH THE   
PUBLIC ON WHAT THAT VISION      

05:17:54.720 --> 05:17:55.119
COMMUNICATION METHOD WITH THE   
PUBLIC ON WHAT THAT VISION      
LOOKS LIKE.

HERE BUT LIKE THINKING ABOUT    
THIS AS LIKE A VISION BOARD IN  
SOME SENSE A BRAINSTORM AND     

05:18:10.836 --> 05:18:14.305
THIS AS LIKE A VISION BOARD IN  
SOME SENSE A BRAINSTORM AND     
MAYBE SOME PERSPECTIVE LIKE

MAYBE SOME PERSPECTIVE LIKE     
JUST GIVING A HYPOTHETICAL      

05:18:15.008 --> 05:18:18.075
MAYBE SOME PERSPECTIVE LIKE     
JUST GIVING A HYPOTHETICAL      
OF WHAT THESE FACES LOOK IT CAN 

05:18:18.077 --> 05:18:18.542
JUST GIVING A HYPOTHETICAL      
OF WHAT THESE FACES LOOK IT CAN 
BE BENEFICIAL.                  

05:18:18.544 --> 05:18:19.210
OF WHAT THESE FACES LOOK IT CAN 
BE BENEFICIAL.                  
SO MAYBE IT'S LIKE TREE LINED

I THINK THE LOW RISE DENSITY    
DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE DEFINED

DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE DEFINED

I LIVE IN A SINGLE FAMILY       
NEIGHBORHOOD AND A THREE STOREY 

05:19:44.597 --> 05:19:48.266
I LIVE IN A SINGLE FAMILY       
NEIGHBORHOOD AND A THREE STOREY 
HOUSE NEXT TO ME WOULD BE FINE  

05:19:48.268 --> 05:19:48.999
NEIGHBORHOOD AND A THREE STOREY 
HOUSE NEXT TO ME WOULD BE FINE  
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT A FOUR OR   

05:19:49.001 --> 05:19:51.635
HOUSE NEXT TO ME WOULD BE FINE  
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT A FOUR OR   
FIVE STORY NEXT TO ME.

BUT I WOULDN'T WANT A FOUR OR   
FIVE STORY NEXT TO ME.          
I THINK HAVING THAT SPECIF      

05:19:55.174 --> 05:19:56.040
FIVE STORY NEXT TO ME.          
I THINK HAVING THAT SPECIF      
DISEASE WILL DECREASE THE       

05:19:56.042 --> 05:19:59.476
I THINK HAVING THAT SPECIF      
DISEASE WILL DECREASE THE       
VAGUENESS THE UNCERTAINTY.      

05:19:59.478 --> 05:20:00.311
DISEASE WILL DECREASE THE       
VAGUENESS THE UNCERTAINTY.      
PEOPLE HAVE POSSIBLY DISTRUST   

05:20:00.313 --> 05:20:03.881
VAGUENESS THE UNCERTAINTY.      
PEOPLE HAVE POSSIBLY DISTRUST   
ABOUT BAITING AND SWITCHING AND 

05:20:03.883 --> 05:20:07.818
PEOPLE HAVE POSSIBLY DISTRUST   
ABOUT BAITING AND SWITCHING AND 
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST    

05:20:07.820 --> 05:20:11.088
ABOUT BAITING AND SWITCHING AND 
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST    
THAT I THE WAY AFTER THE FIRST  

05:20:11.090 --> 05:20:14.258
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST    
THAT I THE WAY AFTER THE FIRST  
PUBLIC COMMENT BUT IF YOU HAD   

05:20:14.260 --> 05:20:15.492
THAT I THE WAY AFTER THE FIRST  
PUBLIC COMMENT BUT IF YOU HAD   
MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE THERE ARE A 

05:20:15.494 --> 05:20:18.429
PUBLIC COMMENT BUT IF YOU HAD   
MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE THERE ARE A 
LOT OF FIFTY PEOPLE OUT THERE   

05:20:18.431 --> 05:20:19.330
MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE THERE ARE A 
LOT OF FIFTY PEOPLE OUT THERE   
THAT THAT MADE A POINT          

05:20:19.332 --> 05:20:19.897
LOT OF FIFTY PEOPLE OUT THERE   
THAT THAT MADE A POINT          
OF GETTING THERE AND I THINK    

05:20:19.899 --> 05:20:22.366
THAT THAT MADE A POINT          
OF GETTING THERE AND I THINK    
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE    

05:20:22.368 --> 05:20:23.234
OF GETTING THERE AND I THINK    
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE    
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE NEED   

05:20:23.236 --> 05:20:23.967
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE    
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE NEED   
TO BE HEARD AND THERE ALL SIDES 

05:20:23.969 --> 05:20:24.302
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE NEED   
TO BE HEARD AND THERE ALL SIDES 
TO IT.                          

05:20:24.304 --> 05:20:27.238
TO BE HEARD AND THERE ALL SIDES 
TO IT.                          
BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A COMMON  

05:20:27.240 --> 05:20:27.838
TO IT.                          
BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A COMMON  
GROUND SOMEWHERE AND SOME       

05:20:27.840 --> 05:20:30.941
BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A COMMON  
GROUND SOMEWHERE AND SOME       
COMPROMISE AND AND I HOPE THAT  

05:20:30.943 --> 05:20:34.078
GROUND SOMEWHERE AND SOME       
COMPROMISE AND AND I HOPE THAT  
IN THE QUEST FOR MORE HOUSING   

05:20:34.080 --> 05:20:37.348
COMPROMISE AND AND I HOPE THAT  
IN THE QUEST FOR MORE HOUSING   
THAT THEY'RE NOT DESTROYING     

05:20:37.350 --> 05:20:38.215
IN THE QUEST FOR MORE HOUSING   
THAT THEY'RE NOT DESTROYING     
THAT SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD 

05:20:38.217 --> 05:20:41.652
THAT THEY'RE NOT DESTROYING     
THAT SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD 
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING I LIKE 

05:20:41.654 --> 05:20:42.453
THAT SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD 
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING I LIKE 
THE ONE DOWN AND SO THAT'S      

05:20:42.455 --> 05:20:45.556
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING I LIKE 
THE ONE DOWN AND SO THAT'S      
SOMETHING THAT I WANT AND I     

05:20:45.558 --> 05:20:45.923
THE ONE DOWN AND SO THAT'S      
SOMETHING THAT I WANT AND I     
LIKE THAT.                      

05:20:45.925 --> 05:20:47.024
SOMETHING THAT I WANT AND I     
LIKE THAT.                      
THAT'S WHY I MOVED IN THIS AREA 

05:20:47.026 --> 05:20:49.427
LIKE THAT.                      
THAT'S WHY I MOVED IN THIS AREA 
AND I REALLY DON'T WANT THAT    

05:20:49.429 --> 05:20:52.897
THAT'S WHY I MOVED IN THIS AREA 
AND I REALLY DON'T WANT THAT    
FOR CHARACTER OF THAT           

05:20:52.899 --> 05:20:53.564
AND I REALLY DON'T WANT THAT    
FOR CHARACTER OF THAT           
NEIGHBORHOOD DESTROYED.         

05:20:53.566 --> 05:20:57.101
FOR CHARACTER OF THAT           
NEIGHBORHOOD DESTROYED.         
AND SO I THINK WHEN DENSITY     

05:20:57.103 --> 05:20:57.768
NEIGHBORHOOD DESTROYED.         
AND SO I THINK WHEN DENSITY     
DOES COME INTO THE SINGLE       

05:20:57.770 --> 05:21:00.738
AND SO I THINK WHEN DENSITY     
DOES COME INTO THE SINGLE       
FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS TO 

05:21:00.740 --> 05:21:02.005
DOES COME INTO THE SINGLE       
FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS TO 
BE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STYLE  

05:21:02.007 --> 05:21:04.608
FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS TO 
BE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STYLE  
OF HOUSES AROUND.               

05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:05.776
BE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STYLE  
OF HOUSES AROUND.               
SO THAT'S NOT THE THING THAT    

05:21:05.778 --> 05:21:08.011
OF HOUSES AROUND.               
SO THAT'S NOT THE THING THAT    
STANDS OUT.                     

05:21:08.013 --> 05:21:09.013
SO THAT'S NOT THE THING THAT    
STANDS OUT.                     
BUT ANYWAY, I DON'T WANT TO     

05:21:09.015 --> 05:21:11.615
STANDS OUT.
