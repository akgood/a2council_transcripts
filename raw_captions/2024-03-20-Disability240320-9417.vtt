WE ALSO WORKING ON EXOSKELETONS 

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.392
A PROSTHETIC FOR THE STUDY.     
WE ALSO WORKING ON EXOSKELETONS 
FOR AGE-RELATED MOBILITY        

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.492
WE ALSO WORKING ON EXOSKELETONS 
FOR AGE-RELATED MOBILITY        
LIMITATIONS SO THAT WITH THE    

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:11.929
FOR AGE-RELATED MOBILITY        
LIMITATIONS SO THAT WITH THE    
ULTIMATE GOAL OF OF ENABLING    

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:16.768

ULTIMATE GOAL OF OF ENABLING    
AGING IN PLACE AND MORE ACTIVE  

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.471
ULTIMATE GOAL OF OF ENABLING    
AGING IN PLACE AND MORE ACTIVE  
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AS AS   

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:21.006
AGING IN PLACE AND MORE ACTIVE  
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AS AS   
AS PEOPLE AGE.

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:24.375
AS PEOPLE AGE.                  
AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE     
EXOSKELETON AGAIN USES MOTORS   

00:12:24.377 --> 00:12:27.478
AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE     
EXOSKELETON AGAIN USES MOTORS   
AND SO THIS DEVICE GOES AROUND  

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.782
EXOSKELETON AGAIN USES MOTORS   
AND SO THIS DEVICE GOES AROUND  
THE BODY OR AN INTACT LIMB THAT

THE BODY OR AN INTACT LIMB THAT 
MAYBE JUST WEAKENED DUE TO      
ADVANCED AGE AND SO THE IDEA IS 

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:35.853
MAYBE JUST WEAKENED DUE TO      
ADVANCED AGE AND SO THE IDEA IS 
THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY     

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.490
ADVANCED AGE AND SO THE IDEA IS 
THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY     
IMPROVE MOBILITY ESPECIALLY     

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:39.290
THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY     
IMPROVE MOBILITY ESPECIALLY     
CLIMBING STAIRS AND AGAIN       

00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:43.160
IMPROVE MOBILITY ESPECIALLY     
CLIMBING STAIRS AND AGAIN       
STANDING FROM A SEATED POSITION 

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:43.761
CLIMBING STAIRS AND AGAIN       
STANDING FROM A SEATED POSITION 
WHICH ARE COMMON COMMON         

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:47.165
STANDING FROM A SEATED POSITION 
WHICH ARE COMMON COMMON         
CHALLENGES AND ALSO ENDURANCE.  

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:51.202
WHICH ARE COMMON COMMON         
CHALLENGES AND ALSO ENDURANCE.  
BYE BYE AGAIN TRYING TO TO      

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:54.638
CHALLENGES AND ALSO ENDURANCE.  
BYE BYE AGAIN TRYING TO TO      
REDUCE THE METABOLIC COST       

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.372
BYE BYE AGAIN TRYING TO TO      
REDUCE THE METABOLIC COST       
OF PERFORMING THESE ACTIVITIES. 

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:58.909
REDUCE THE METABOLIC COST       
OF PERFORMING THESE ACTIVITIES. 
AND SO WE ARE CURRENTLY         

00:12:58.911 --> 00:12:59.477
OF PERFORMING THESE ACTIVITIES. 
AND SO WE ARE CURRENTLY         
RECRUITING INDIVIDUALS.         

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:00.278
AND SO WE ARE CURRENTLY         
RECRUITING INDIVIDUALS.

OSTEOARTHRITIS.                 

00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:05.443
YOU TODAY IS EXOSKELETONS FOR   
OSTEOARTHRITIS.                 
SO AND NOW THIS POPULATION      

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:06.310
OSTEOARTHRITIS.                 
SO AND NOW THIS POPULATION      
TENDS TO HAVE SOME OVERLAP WITH 

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:09.413
SO AND NOW THIS POPULATION      
TENDS TO HAVE SOME OVERLAP WITH 
THE THE POPULATION IN THE       

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.916
TENDS TO HAVE SOME OVERLAP WITH 
THE THE POPULATION IN THE       
PREVIOUS SLIDE OF COURSE AS     

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:12.850
THE THE POPULATION IN THE       
PREVIOUS SLIDE OF COURSE AS     
PEOPLE AGE THE DEVICE BECOMES   

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:16.287
PREVIOUS SLIDE OF COURSE AS     
PEOPLE AGE THE DEVICE BECOMES   
MORE COMMON BUT WE&apos;RE           

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:17.021
PEOPLE AGE THE DEVICE BECOMES   
MORE COMMON BUT WE&apos;RE           
PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT USING   

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.224
MORE COMMON BUT WE&apos;RE           
PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT USING   
EXOSKELETONS TO PARTIALLY       

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:24.028
PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT USING   
EXOSKELETONS TO PARTIALLY       
OFFLOAD MUSCLE CONTRACTION THAT 

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.895
EXOSKELETONS TO PARTIALLY       
OFFLOAD MUSCLE CONTRACTION THAT 
THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME    

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:25.496
OFFLOAD MUSCLE CONTRACTION THAT 
THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME    
OF THE PAIN THAT PEOPLE         

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:28.366
THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME    
OF THE PAIN THAT PEOPLE         
EXPERIENCE WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. 

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:32.002
OF THE PAIN THAT PEOPLE         
EXPERIENCE WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. 
SO SO FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH THAT 

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:32.603
EXPERIENCE WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. 
SO SO FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH THAT 
THAT FOR EXAMPLE HAVE           

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:34.905
SO SO FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH THAT 
THAT FOR EXAMPLE HAVE           
SIGNIFICANT PAIN DURING         

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:35.706
THAT FOR EXAMPLE HAVE           
SIGNIFICANT PAIN DURING         
CLIMBING RAMPS OR STAIRS,       

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.876
SIGNIFICANT PAIN DURING         
CLIMBING RAMPS OR STAIRS,       
THAT&apos;S BECAUSE YOUR MUSCLES ARE 

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:39.844
CLIMBING RAMPS OR STAIRS,       
THAT&apos;S BECAUSE YOUR MUSCLES ARE 
ARE PROVIDING A LOT OF FORCE    

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:42.913
THAT&apos;S BECAUSE YOUR MUSCLES ARE 
ARE PROVIDING A LOT OF FORCE    
AND THAT FORCE IS COMPRESSING   

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:43.747
ARE PROVIDING A LOT OF FORCE    
AND THAT FORCE IS COMPRESSING   
THE ARTICULAR SURFACES OF OF    

00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:47.418
AND THAT FORCE IS COMPRESSING   
THE ARTICULAR SURFACES OF OF    
THE JOINTS OF YOUR BONES AND    

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.152
THE ARTICULAR SURFACES OF OF    
THE JOINTS OF YOUR BONES AND    
THAT THAT BERNABEI INTERACTION  

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:51.088
THE JOINTS OF YOUR BONES AND    
THAT THAT BERNABEI INTERACTION  
IS PAINFUL.                     

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.223
THAT THAT BERNABEI INTERACTION  
IS PAINFUL.                     
AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF WE   

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:52.990
IS PAINFUL.                     
AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF WE   
COULD OFFLOAD SOME OF THAT      

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:55.693
AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF WE   
COULD OFFLOAD SOME OF THAT      
MUSCULAR FORCE BY LETTING THE   

00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:56.327
COULD OFFLOAD SOME OF THAT      
MUSCULAR FORCE BY LETTING THE   
EXOSKELETON PROVIDE THAT        

00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:58.930
MUSCULAR FORCE BY LETTING THE   
EXOSKELETON PROVIDE THAT        
INSTEAD OF THE PERSON&apos;S OWN     

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:00.064
EXOSKELETON PROVIDE THAT        
INSTEAD OF THE PERSON&apos;S OWN     
MUSCLES, THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE  

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:03.201
INSTEAD OF THE PERSON&apos;S OWN     
MUSCLES, THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE  
TO REDUCE PAIN DURING THESE     

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:03.868
MUSCLES, THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE  
TO REDUCE PAIN DURING THESE     
CHALLENGING ACTIVITIES AND      

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.238
TO REDUCE PAIN DURING THESE     
CHALLENGING ACTIVITIES AND      
THEREFORE INCREASE MOBILITY AND 

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.908
CHALLENGING ACTIVITIES AND      
THEREFORE INCREASE MOBILITY AND 
OF COURSE WITH INCREASED        

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.708
THEREFORE INCREASE MOBILITY AND 
OF COURSE WITH INCREASED        
MOBILITY AND INCREASED NUMBER   

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.346
OF COURSE WITH INCREASED        
MOBILITY AND INCREASED NUMBER   
OF STEPS THAT ALSO CAN HELP     

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:19.016
MOBILITY AND INCREASED NUMBER   
OF STEPS THAT ALSO CAN HELP     
WITH STRENGTH AND AND           

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:22.086
OF STEPS THAT ALSO CAN HELP     
WITH STRENGTH AND AND           
POTENTIALLY WEIGHT RELATED      

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.221
WITH STRENGTH AND AND           
POTENTIALLY WEIGHT RELATED      
IMPACTS ON OA BECAUSE IT&apos;S KIND 

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:26.957
POTENTIALLY WEIGHT RELATED      
IMPACTS ON OA BECAUSE IT&apos;S KIND 
OF LIKE A VICIOUS CYCLE THAT IF 

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:27.892
IMPACTS ON OA BECAUSE IT&apos;S KIND 
OF LIKE A VICIOUS CYCLE THAT IF 
YOU LOSE MOBILITY IT CAN BECOME 

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:31.328
OF LIKE A VICIOUS CYCLE THAT IF 
YOU LOSE MOBILITY IT CAN BECOME 
WORSE OVER TIME.                

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.463
YOU LOSE MOBILITY IT CAN BECOME 
WORSE OVER TIME.                
AND SO WE WANT WE WANT TO WE    

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:33.297
WORSE OVER TIME.                
AND SO WE WANT WE WANT TO WE    
WANT TO BREAK THAT THAT CYCLE   

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.800
AND SO WE WANT WE WANT TO WE    
WANT TO BREAK THAT THAT CYCLE   
AND ABLE PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE    

00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:39.103
WANT TO BREAK THAT THAT CYCLE   
AND ABLE PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE    
STEPS AND A DAY AND HOPEFULLY   

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:39.804
AND ABLE PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE    
STEPS AND A DAY AND HOPEFULLY   
PREVENT FURTHER PROGRESSION     

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:43.373
STEPS AND A DAY AND HOPEFULLY   
PREVENT FURTHER PROGRESSION     
OF OF THE OF THE ARTHRITIS.     

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.208
PREVENT FURTHER PROGRESSION     
OF OF THE OF THE ARTHRITIS.     
AND SO HERE WE&apos;RE RECRUITING    

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.645
OF OF THE OF THE ARTHRITIS.     
AND SO HERE WE&apos;RE RECRUITING    
INDIVIDUALS 18 TO EIGHTY FIVE   

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:48.246
AND SO HERE WE&apos;RE RECRUITING

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:06.614
WHETHER IT HELPS IS OBVIOUSLY   
NO DEVICE WILL WORK FOR ALL BUT

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:07.649
NO DEVICE WILL WORK FOR ALL BUT 
IT WOULD BE REALLY NEAT TO DO   
LIKE A STUDY TO SEE OUT         

00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:11.119
IT WOULD BE REALLY NEAT TO DO   
LIKE A STUDY TO SEE OUT         
OF THOSE WHO ARE BLIND LOW      

00:58:11.121 --> 00:58:15.290

SEEING TEST TO SEE WHO          
QUALIFIES AT THE THEATER BUT IF 

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:23.131
SEEING TEST TO SEE WHO          
QUALIFIES AT THE THEATER BUT IF 
SOMEONE&apos;S HAVING TROUBLE SEEING 

00:58:23.133 --> 00:58:25.467
QUALIFIES AT THE THEATER BUT IF 
SOMEONE&apos;S HAVING TROUBLE SEEING 
IF THEY WANT SOMETHING EXTRA I  

00:58:25.469 --> 00:58:29.805
SOMEONE&apos;S HAVING TROUBLE SEEING 
IF THEY WANT SOMETHING EXTRA I  
THINK THIS IS TO THOSE WHO HAVE 

00:58:29.807 --> 00:58:33.575
IF THEY WANT SOMETHING EXTRA I  
THINK THIS IS TO THOSE WHO HAVE 
VISUAL DONGES WHAT HEARING AIDS 

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:34.442
THINK THIS IS TO THOSE WHO HAVE 
VISUAL DONGES WHAT HEARING AIDS 
WERE TO THOSE WITH HEARING

VISUAL DONGES WHAT HEARING AIDS 
WERE TO THOSE WITH HEARING      
DIFFICULTIES.                   

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:38.747
WERE TO THOSE WITH HEARING      
DIFFICULTIES.                   
SO OBVIOUSLY IT WON&apos;T WORK FOR  

00:58:38.749 --> 00:58:39.747
DIFFICULTIES.                   
SO OBVIOUSLY IT WON&apos;T WORK FOR  
EVERYONE BUT BUT IT WILL IT CAN 

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:41.783
SO OBVIOUSLY IT WON&apos;T WORK FOR
