00:24:43.343 --> 00:24:46.812
OUR CALCULATIONS JUST SHOWING   
HOW WE GET TO THE AVERAGE.      
YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT IS        

00:24:46.814 --> 00:24:47.212
HOW WE GET TO THE AVERAGE.      
YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT IS        
TRAPEZOIDAL.                    

00:24:47.214 --> 00:24:47.679
YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT IS        
TRAPEZOIDAL.                    
OH SORRY.                       

00:24:47.681 --> 00:24:47.880
TRAPEZOIDAL.                    
OH SORRY.                       
YEAH.                           

00:24:47.882 --> 00:24:51.049
OH SORRY.                       
YEAH.                           
SO YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE       

00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:54.719
YEAH.                           
SO YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE       
LIGHTS ARE KIND OF DIVIDED, YOU 

00:24:54.721 --> 00:24:58.556
SO YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE       
LIGHTS ARE KIND OF DIVIDED, YOU 
KNOW, IN HALF ON THE LONG YOU   

00:24:58.558 --> 00:24:59.591
LIGHTS ARE KIND OF DIVIDED, YOU 
KNOW, IN HALF ON THE LONG YOU   
KNOW, GOING ALONG THE STREETS   

00:24:59.593 --> 00:25:02.294
KNOW, IN HALF ON THE LONG YOU   
KNOW, GOING ALONG THE STREETS   
BUT THEN AS THESE CURVE AROUND  

00:25:02.296 --> 00:25:03.161
KNOW, GOING ALONG THE STREETS   
BUT THEN AS THESE CURVE AROUND  
YOU GET SOME ODDLY SHAPED ONES  

00:25:03.163 --> 00:25:06.231
BUT THEN AS THESE CURVE AROUND  
YOU GET SOME ODDLY SHAPED ONES  
IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THE   

00:25:06.233 --> 00:25:07.032
YOU GET SOME ODDLY SHAPED ONES  
IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THE   
TRAPEZOID BUT THE POINT IN THE  

00:25:07.034 --> 00:25:10.235
IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THE   
TRAPEZOID BUT THE POINT IN THE  
BACK SO THE EXISTING HOUSE      

00:25:10.237 --> 00:25:13.138
TRAPEZOID BUT THE POINT IN THE  
BACK SO THE EXISTING HOUSE      
EXTENDS OVER THIS HEAD BACK NOW 

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.206
BACK SO THE EXISTING HOUSE      
EXTENDS OVER THIS HEAD BACK NOW 
I GUESS WE'LL GET TO THAT.      

00:25:14.208 --> 00:25:17.175
EXTENDS OVER THIS HEAD BACK NOW 
I GUESS WE'LL GET TO THAT.      
SO NEXT SLIDE THIS IS UNUSUAL   

00:25:17.177 --> 00:25:17.576
I GUESS WE'LL GET TO THAT.      
SO NEXT SLIDE THIS IS UNUSUAL   
TO ME.                          

00:25:17.578 --> 00:25:20.578
SO NEXT SLIDE THIS IS UNUSUAL   
TO ME.                          
I MEAN IT'S AN R1 B ISLAND      

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.647
TO ME.                          
I MEAN IT'S AN R1 B ISLAND      
THERE IN THE MIDST OF OUR ONE C 

00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:24.783
I MEAN IT'S AN R1 B ISLAND      
THERE IN THE MIDST OF OUR ONE C 
AND THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT   

00:25:24.785 --> 00:25:25.884
THERE IN THE MIDST OF OUR ONE C 
AND THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT   
OUR ONE C HAS A 30 FOOT REAR    

00:25:25.886 --> 00:25:28.887
AND THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT   
OUR ONE C HAS A 30 FOOT REAR    
YARD SET BACK ACROSS THE        

00:25:28.889 --> 00:25:29.254
OUR ONE C HAS A 30 FOOT REAR    
YARD SET BACK ACROSS THE        
STREET.                         

00:25:29.256 --> 00:25:30.021
YARD SET BACK ACROSS THE        
STREET.                         
THOSE BLUE SITES WOULD HAVE 30  

00:25:30.023 --> 00:25:33.091
STREET.                         
THOSE BLUE SITES WOULD HAVE 30  
FOOT REAR YARD SET BACK.        

00:25:33.093 --> 00:25:36.361
THOSE BLUE SITES WOULD HAVE 30  
FOOT REAR YARD SET BACK.        
WELL THEY HAVE A 40 FOOT BEING  

00:25:36.363 --> 00:25:37.428
FOOT REAR YARD SET BACK.        
WELL THEY HAVE A 40 FOOT BEING  
R1 B I DON'T REALLY SEE A       

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.096
WELL THEY HAVE A 40 FOOT BEING  
R1 B I DON'T REALLY SEE A       
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOT      

00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:40.432
R1 B I DON'T REALLY SEE A       
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOT      
SIZES ON THE NEXT SLIDE.        

00:25:40.434 --> 00:25:43.334
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOT      
SIZES ON THE NEXT SLIDE.        
SO THERE'S OUR SET BACK         

00:25:43.336 --> 00:25:43.802
SIZES ON THE NEXT SLIDE.        
SO THERE'S OUR SET BACK         
REQUIREMENTS.                   

00:25:43.804 --> 00:25:44.536
SO THERE'S OUR SET BACK         
REQUIREMENTS.                   
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT WAYS,  

00:25:44.538 --> 00:25:47.672
REQUIREMENTS.                   
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT WAYS,  
YOU KNOW, THAT THE CITY ZONING  

00:25:47.674 --> 00:25:48.473
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT WAYS,  
YOU KNOW, THAT THE CITY ZONING  
ORDINANCE HAS FOR CALCULATING   

00:25:48.475 --> 00:25:50.642
YOU KNOW, THAT THE CITY ZONING  
ORDINANCE HAS FOR CALCULATING   
THE REAR YARD IN AN INSTANCE    

00:25:50.644 --> 00:25:55.147
ORDINANCE HAS FOR CALCULATING   
THE REAR YARD IN AN INSTANCE    
LIKE THIS IF IT WAS INTERPRETED 

00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:57.682
THE REAR YARD IN AN INSTANCE    
LIKE THIS IF IT WAS INTERPRETED 
THAT THIS WAS AN IRREGULAR SITE 

00:25:57.684 --> 00:25:58.616
LIKE THIS IF IT WAS INTERPRETED 
THAT THIS WAS AN IRREGULAR SITE 
WHICH I KNOW THAT HAS TO BE     

00:25:58.618 --> 00:25:59.417
THAT THIS WAS AN IRREGULAR SITE 
WHICH I KNOW THAT HAS TO BE     
WEIGHED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE   

00:25:59.419 --> 00:26:02.287
WHICH I KNOW THAT HAS TO BE     
WEIGHED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE   
CITY BUT IF IF IT WAS THEN THE  

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:03.088
WEIGHED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE   
CITY BUT IF IF IT WAS THEN THE  
GREEN LINE SO THAT YOU TAKE     

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.591
CITY BUT IF IF IT WAS THEN THE  
GREEN LINE SO THAT YOU TAKE     
THAT TEN FOOT LINE AT THE BACK  

00:26:05.593 --> 00:26:06.724
GREEN LINE SO THAT YOU TAKE     
THAT TEN FOOT LINE AT THE BACK  
AND THEN YOU GO PARALLEL TO THE 

00:26:06.726 --> 00:26:07.426
THAT TEN FOOT LINE AT THE BACK  
AND THEN YOU GO PARALLEL TO THE 
FRONT OF THE FLAT AND CAST IT   

00:26:07.428 --> 00:26:10.228
AND THEN YOU GO PARALLEL TO THE 
FRONT OF THE FLAT AND CAST IT   
OFF AND SO AT FORTY FEET THAT   

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.929
FRONT OF THE FLAT AND CAST IT   
OFF AND SO AT FORTY FEET THAT   
GREEN LINE WOULD MEAN THAT YOU  

00:26:10.931 --> 00:26:14.432
OFF AND SO AT FORTY FEET THAT   
GREEN LINE WOULD MEAN THAT YOU  
KNOW, WE'D BE JUST A LITTLE BIT 

00:26:14.434 --> 00:26:17.469
GREEN LINE WOULD MEAN THAT YOU  
KNOW, WE'D BE JUST A LITTLE BIT 
BEYOND THE RED LINE IS WHERE IF 

00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:18.537
KNOW, WE'D BE JUST A LITTLE BIT 
BEYOND THE RED LINE IS WHERE IF 
YOU TAKE THE 40 FOOT SET BACK   

00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:19.504
BEYOND THE RED LINE IS WHERE IF 
YOU TAKE THE 40 FOOT SET BACK   
PARALLEL TO THE BACK OF A FLAT  

00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:21.507
YOU TAKE THE 40 FOOT SET BACK   
PARALLEL TO THE BACK OF A FLAT  
LINE THEN THE EXISTING HOUSE IS 

00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:22.374
PARALLEL TO THE BACK OF A FLAT  
LINE THEN THE EXISTING HOUSE IS 
YOU KNOW WAY OVER IT AT THE

SO WE JUST CONSIDERED IF THIS   

00:26:32.886 --> 00:26:36.688
PORCH AND THIS NEXT SLIDE.      
SO WE JUST CONSIDERED IF THIS   
WAS AN R1 C LOT AND IF YOU DID  

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.891
SO WE JUST CONSIDERED IF THIS   
WAS AN R1 C LOT AND IF YOU DID  
THE IRREGULAR CALCULATION THERE 

00:26:39.893 --> 00:26:40.859
WAS AN R1 C LOT AND IF YOU DID  
THE IRREGULAR CALCULATION THERE 
USING THAT TEN FOOT LINE, THEN  

00:26:40.861 --> 00:26:44.429
THE IRREGULAR CALCULATION THERE 
USING THAT TEN FOOT LINE, THEN  
THE THE RED DASH LINE WOULD BE  

00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:46.698
USING THAT TEN FOOT LINE, THEN  
THE THE RED DASH LINE WOULD BE  
A 30 FOOT SET BACK AND WE       

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.832
THE THE RED DASH LINE WOULD BE  
A 30 FOOT SET BACK AND WE       
WOULDN'T BE HERE ASKING FOR A

FOOTPRINT YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN A 
STEP AND THEN YOU GO UP A STEP  
INTO THE BATHROOM AND SWING     

00:28:15.422 --> 00:28:16.221
STEP AND THEN YOU GO UP A STEP  
INTO THE BATHROOM AND SWING     
THAT DOOR OPEN AND STAND VERY

00:28:19.793 --> 00:28:20.325
CLOSE TO THE SINK.              
SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT ANOTHER

00:28:23.563 --> 00:28:24.696
BATHROOM THAT COULD BE          
REMODELED IN ANY WAY EASILY.    
I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A     

00:28:24.698 --> 00:28:26.932
REMODELED IN ANY WAY EASILY.    
I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A     
BUDGET FOR THE ORIGINAL BUILDER 

00:28:26.934 --> 00:28:27.599
I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A     
BUDGET FOR THE ORIGINAL BUILDER 
TO GET THE BASEMENT STAIRS IN   

00:28:27.601 --> 00:28:30.268
BUDGET FOR THE ORIGINAL BUILDER 
TO GET THE BASEMENT STAIRS IN   
THERE REAL TIGHTLY AND AND PUT  

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.269
TO GET THE BASEMENT STAIRS IN   
THERE REAL TIGHTLY AND AND PUT  
THE SECOND FLOOR STAIRS ON TOP

THERE REAL TIGHTLY AND AND PUT  
THE SECOND FLOOR STAIRS ON TOP  
OF IT.

THE SECOND FLOOR STAIRS ON TOP  
OF IT.                          
SO IT'S WHAT THAT IS PROPOSED   

00:28:34.742 --> 00:28:38.610
OF IT.                          
SO IT'S WHAT THAT IS PROPOSED   
ADDITION THESE WERE ALSO IN

WE TOOK WE LOOKED AROUND AT ALL 
THREE ELEVATIONS AND ALL THREE  

00:43:56.529 --> 00:43:57.328
WE TOOK WE LOOKED AROUND AT ALL 
THREE ELEVATIONS AND ALL THREE  
WOULD REQUIRE TO BE TWENTY FEET 

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.931
THREE ELEVATIONS AND ALL THREE  
WOULD REQUIRE TO BE TWENTY FEET 
MAX EVEN THOUGH SAY THE OTHER

BECAUSE IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT   
BANDING SITE AND IT MAKES SENSE 
AS MEMBER ALSO POINTED OUT THAT 

00:56:29.514 --> 00:56:30.413
BANDING SITE AND IT MAKES SENSE 
AS MEMBER ALSO POINTED OUT THAT 
THAT'S THERE ON THE FIRST FLOOR 

00:56:30.415 --> 00:56:32.749
AS MEMBER ALSO POINTED OUT THAT 
THAT'S THERE ON THE FIRST FLOOR 
SO I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE.    

00:56:32.751 --> 00:56:33.716
THAT'S THERE ON THE FIRST FLOOR 
SO I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE.    
IT WOULD LOOK PECULIAR IF IT    

00:56:33.718 --> 00:56:36.519
SO I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE.    
IT WOULD LOOK PECULIAR IF IT    
WAS RAISED ABOVE THAT BOTTOM    

00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:39.989
IT WOULD LOOK PECULIAR IF IT    
WAS RAISED ABOVE THAT BOTTOM    
BAND.                           

00:56:39.991 --> 00:56:40.991
WAS RAISED ABOVE THAT BOTTOM    
BAND.                           
I DO THINK THAT THERE'S ROOM IF 

00:56:40.993 --> 00:56:41.858
BAND.                           
I DO THINK THAT THERE'S ROOM IF 
YOU COULD NAVIGATE BACK TO THE  

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.526
I DO THINK THAT THERE'S ROOM IF 
YOU COULD NAVIGATE BACK TO THE  
THE FACADE THAT THEY'RE         

00:56:43.528 --> 00:56:49.633
YOU COULD NAVIGATE BACK TO THE  
THE FACADE THAT THEY'RE         
PROPOSING JOHN                  

00:56:52.937 --> 00:56:56.506
               PRITCHARD'S A    
LITTLE BIT OVER THE WINDOW      
OPENING SO MAYBE THE VARIANCE   

00:56:56.508 --> 00:56:57.407
LITTLE BIT OVER THE WINDOW      
OPENING SO MAYBE THE VARIANCE   
IF THEY WERE TO COME BACK AND   

00:56:57.409 --> 00:56:59.709
OPENING SO MAYBE THE VARIANCE   
IF THEY WERE TO COME BACK AND   
LOWER MAYBE THERE WOULD STILL   

00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:00.477
IF THEY WERE TO COME BACK AND   
LOWER MAYBE THERE WOULD STILL   
BE A VARIANCE ON THE TABLE WITH 

00:57:00.479 --> 00:57:03.079
LOWER MAYBE THERE WOULD STILL   
BE A VARIANCE ON THE TABLE WITH 
BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH 

00:57:03.081 --> 00:57:04.081
BE A VARIANCE ON THE TABLE WITH 
BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH 
AS WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED ON    

00:57:04.083 --> 00:57:04.548
BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH 
AS WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED ON    
THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.            

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:07.617
AS WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED ON    
THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.            
BUT I DO SEE HOW THAT LIMITS    

00:57:07.619 --> 00:57:11.087
THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.            
BUT I DO SEE HOW THAT LIMITS    
THEIR ABILITY TO TO LAND THE    

00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:12.121
BUT I DO SEE HOW THAT LIMITS    
THEIR ABILITY TO TO LAND THE    
SIGN AND I DO FEEL LIKE IT'S    

00:57:12.123 --> 00:57:15.191
THEIR ABILITY TO TO LAND THE    
SIGN AND I DO FEEL LIKE IT'S    
GOING TO CREATE THE MOST IMPACT 

00:57:15.193 --> 00:57:16.125
SIGN AND I DO FEEL LIKE IT'S    
GOING TO CREATE THE MOST IMPACT 
AND FOR AND I'M SUPPORTING      

00:57:16.127 --> 00:57:19.362
GOING TO CREATE THE MOST IMPACT 
AND FOR AND I'M SUPPORTING      
BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY FIRST     

00:57:19.364 --> 00:57:23.166
AND FOR AND I'M SUPPORTING      
BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY FIRST     
TIME BUSINESS AND THE AREA THAT 

00:57:23.168 --> 00:57:24.100
BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY FIRST     
TIME BUSINESS AND THE AREA THAT 
THAT I COULD SEE WHY COMING     

00:57:24.102 --> 00:57:26.770
TIME BUSINESS AND THE AREA THAT 
THAT I COULD SEE WHY COMING     
OVER THE BRIDGE AT THAT MAKES   

00:57:26.772 --> 00:57:27.870
THAT I COULD SEE WHY COMING     
OVER THE BRIDGE AT THAT MAKES   
VERY GOOD SENSE TO HAVE THE     

00:57:27.872 --> 00:57:31.140
OVER THE BRIDGE AT THAT MAKES   
VERY GOOD SENSE TO HAVE THE     
SIGN IN THAT PLANE ABOVE THOSE  

00:57:31.142 --> 00:57:31.608
VERY GOOD SENSE TO HAVE THE     
SIGN IN THAT PLANE ABOVE THOSE  
TWO WINDOWS.                    

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:32.775
SIGN IN THAT PLANE ABOVE THOSE  
TWO WINDOWS.                    
SO I WISH THERE WAS A LITTLE    

00:57:32.777 --> 00:57:35.011
TWO WINDOWS.                    
SO I WISH THERE WAS A LITTLE    
BIT MORE BACKUP JUST TO SHOW    

00:57:35.013 --> 00:57:38.081
SO I WISH THERE WAS A LITTLE    
BIT MORE BACKUP JUST TO SHOW    
THAT IF THEY SPLIT IT DOWN HOW  

00:57:38.083 --> 00:57:38.749
BIT MORE BACKUP JUST TO SHOW    
THAT IF THEY SPLIT IT DOWN HOW  
WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE         

00:57:38.751 --> 00:57:42.185
THAT IF THEY SPLIT IT DOWN HOW  
WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE         
EXISTING FACADE ELEMENT.        

00:57:42.187 --> 00:57:43.120
WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE         
EXISTING FACADE ELEMENT.        
BUT AGAIN IT SEEMS LIKE IT      

00:57:43.122 --> 00:57:43.820
EXISTING FACADE ELEMENT.        
BUT AGAIN IT SEEMS LIKE IT      
WOULD STILL BE IN THE           

00:57:43.822 --> 00:57:44.387
BUT AGAIN IT SEEMS LIKE IT      
WOULD STILL BE IN THE           
NEIGHBORHOOD OF HAVING A        

00:57:44.389 --> 00:57:46.355
WOULD STILL BE IN THE           
NEIGHBORHOOD OF HAVING A        
VARIANCE.                       

00:57:46.357 --> 00:57:47.590
NEIGHBORHOOD OF HAVING A        
VARIANCE.                       
>> YEAH, IF YOU LOOK AT THESE   

00:57:47.592 --> 00:57:48.324
VARIANCE.                       
>> YEAH, IF YOU LOOK AT THESE   
WINDOWS THERE'S THIS I THINK    

00:57:48.326 --> 00:57:50.360
>> YEAH, IF YOU LOOK AT THESE   
WINDOWS THERE'S THIS I THINK    
YOU CALL EYEBROW.

YOU CALL EYEBROW.               
SURE.                           
THERE'S LIKE THESE BRICKS THAT  

00:57:51.697 --> 00:57:54.364
SURE.                           
THERE'S LIKE THESE BRICKS THAT  
WOULD CREATE A LITTLE YEAH.     

00:57:54.366 --> 00:57:55.398
THERE'S LIKE THESE BRICKS THAT  
WOULD CREATE A LITTLE YEAH.     
>> THERE'S ANOTHER THERE'S LIKE 

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:55.866
WOULD CREATE A LITTLE YEAH.     
>> THERE'S ANOTHER THERE'S LIKE 
TWO ELEMENTS THERE.             

00:57:55.868 --> 00:57:56.199
>> THERE'S ANOTHER THERE'S LIKE 
TWO ELEMENTS THERE.             
YEAH.

TWO ELEMENTS THERE.             
YEAH.                           
AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER ONE

RIGHT ABOVE IT RIGHT HERE.      
SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS        

00:58:01.406 --> 00:58:02.205
RIGHT ABOVE IT RIGHT HERE.      
SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS        
THERE'S SOME ARTICULATION ON

SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS        
THERE'S SOME ARTICULATION ON    
THAT PARTICULAR IT'S A GOOD     

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.842
THERE'S SOME ARTICULATION ON

ARTICULATION OF EYEBROWS.       
YES.                            
NOT EVEN AN ARCHITECTURAL YEAH  

00:58:12.517 --> 00:58:13.249
YES.                            
NOT EVEN AN ARCHITECTURAL YEAH  
I'M JUST LOOKING SO I'M LOOKING 

00:58:13.251 --> 00:58:16.586
NOT EVEN AN ARCHITECTURAL YEAH  
I'M JUST LOOKING SO I'M LOOKING 
AT THE PREVIOUS SIDE A HUMAN    

00:58:16.588 --> 00:58:17.320
I'M JUST LOOKING SO I'M LOOKING 
AT THE PREVIOUS SIDE A HUMAN    
ELEMENT ON SO IT LOOKS LIKE     

00:58:17.322 --> 00:58:20.823
AT THE PREVIOUS SIDE A HUMAN    
ELEMENT ON SO IT LOOKS LIKE     
THEY STARTED 2016 AND THEN IT   

00:58:20.825 --> 00:58:24.561
ELEMENT ON SO IT LOOKS LIKE     
THEY STARTED 2016 AND THEN IT   
WAS THERE THROUGH 2022 AND IT   

00:58:24.563 --> 00:58:27.297
THEY STARTED 2016 AND THEN IT   
WAS THERE THROUGH 2022 AND IT   
WAS RIGHT IN THAT SPOT IN THAT  

00:58:27.299 --> 00:58:28.298
WAS THERE THROUGH 2022 AND IT   
WAS RIGHT IN THAT SPOT IN THAT  
SPACE AND IT SEEMS ACTUALLY     

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.634
WAS RIGHT IN THAT SPOT IN THAT  
SPACE AND IT SEEMS ACTUALLY     
LIKE A PRETTY REASONABLE SPOT   

00:58:31.636 --> 00:58:32.102
SPACE AND IT SEEMS ACTUALLY     
LIKE A PRETTY REASONABLE SPOT   
AND SPACE FOR IT.               

00:58:32.104 --> 00:58:35.838
LIKE A PRETTY REASONABLE SPOT   
AND SPACE FOR IT.               
I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S LIKE A   

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.709
AND SPACE FOR IT.               
I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S LIKE A   
LITTLE SQUARE WHERE YOU CAN PUT 

00:58:39.711 --> 00:58:40.510
I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S LIKE A   
LITTLE SQUARE WHERE YOU CAN PUT 
ASIDE A BAND AND THERE'S        

00:58:40.512 --> 00:58:42.745
LITTLE SQUARE WHERE YOU CAN PUT 
ASIDE A BAND AND THERE'S        
THERE'S ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS   

00:58:42.747 --> 00:58:46.315
ASIDE A BAND AND THERE'S        
THERE'S ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS   
WILL GO RANDOM ARCHITECTURAL    

00:58:46.317 --> 00:58:47.317
THERE'S ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS   
WILL GO RANDOM ARCHITECTURAL    
DETAILS THAT GO AND I DON'T I   

00:58:47.319 --> 00:58:50.620
WILL GO RANDOM ARCHITECTURAL    
DETAILS THAT GO AND I DON'T I   
DON'T SEE WHERE YOU COULD PUT   

00:58:50.622 --> 00:58:51.521
DETAILS THAT GO AND I DON'T I   
DON'T SEE WHERE YOU COULD PUT   
THAT SIGN IN A DIFFERENT SPOT   

00:58:51.523 --> 00:58:54.857
DON'T SEE WHERE YOU COULD PUT   
THAT SIGN IN A DIFFERENT SPOT   
ON THAT FACADE BECAUSE IT JUST  

00:58:54.859 --> 00:58:55.625
THAT SIGN IN A DIFFERENT SPOT   
ON THAT FACADE BECAUSE IT JUST  
IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE  

00:58:55.627 --> 00:58:57.761
ON THAT FACADE BECAUSE IT JUST  
IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE  
IT ON A DIFFERENT SPOT ON THAT  

00:58:57.763 --> 00:59:01.631
IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE  
IT ON A DIFFERENT SPOT ON THAT  
FACADE.                         

00:59:01.633 --> 00:59:02.699
IT ON A DIFFERENT SPOT ON THAT  
FACADE.                         
I GUESS WE COULD SAY WELL THEY  

00:59:02.701 --> 00:59:03.566
FACADE.                         
I GUESS WE COULD SAY WELL THEY  
COULD PUT IT ON A DIFFERENT     

00:59:03.568 --> 00:59:05.635
I GUESS WE COULD SAY WELL THEY  
COULD PUT IT ON A DIFFERENT     
FACADE.                         

00:59:05.637 --> 00:59:06.803
COULD PUT IT ON A DIFFERENT     
FACADE.                         
BUT IN THIS CASE, LIKE I THINK  

00:59:06.805 --> 00:59:10.139
FACADE.                         
BUT IN THIS CASE, LIKE I THINK  
THAT SEEMS THE ONE PLACE YOU    

00:59:10.141 --> 00:59:13.676
BUT IN THIS CASE, LIKE I THINK  
THAT SEEMS THE ONE PLACE YOU    
COULD PUT THIS SIGN UNLESS YOU  

00:59:13.678 --> 00:59:14.444
THAT SEEMS THE ONE PLACE YOU    
COULD PUT THIS SIGN UNLESS YOU  
JUST DID A LITTLE SQUARE IN     

00:59:14.446 --> 00:59:17.713
COULD PUT THIS SIGN UNLESS YOU  
JUST DID A LITTLE SQUARE IN     
BETWEEN THE WINDOWS BECAUSE     

00:59:17.715 --> 00:59:18.314
JUST DID A LITTLE SQUARE IN     
BETWEEN THE WINDOWS BECAUSE     
THERE'S A THERE'S A VERY        

00:59:18.316 --> 00:59:19.115
BETWEEN THE WINDOWS BECAUSE     
THERE'S A THERE'S A VERY        
OBVIOUS SPACE ON THE BUILDING   

00:59:19.117 --> 00:59:23.853
THERE'S A THERE'S A VERY        
OBVIOUS SPACE ON THE BUILDING   
WHERE A LINE COULD GO AND THAT  

00:59:23.855 --> 00:59:27.824
OBVIOUS SPACE ON THE BUILDING   
WHERE A LINE COULD GO AND THAT  
SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY REMARKABLE  

00:59:27.826 --> 00:59:35.031
WHERE A LINE COULD GO AND THAT  
SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY REMARKABLE  
PICTURE OF THE OF THE           

00:59:36.501 --> 00:59:41.738
                      DAVE DID  
YOU I I'D LIKE TO I'M GOING TO  
VOTE AGAINST THIS.              

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.707
YOU I I'D LIKE TO I'M GOING TO  
VOTE AGAINST THIS.              
I SEE TWO OPTIONS.              

00:59:44.709 --> 00:59:45.675
VOTE AGAINST THIS.              
I SEE TWO OPTIONS.              
ONE IS IF THEY INSIST ON THIS   

00:59:45.677 --> 00:59:48.911
I SEE TWO OPTIONS.              
ONE IS IF THEY INSIST ON THIS   
FACADE BEING WHERE THEY WANT TO 

00:59:48.913 --> 00:59:49.646
ONE IS IF THEY INSIST ON THIS   
FACADE BEING WHERE THEY WANT TO 
SIGN AS OPPOSED TO WHERE THE    

00:59:49.648 --> 00:59:52.415
FACADE BEING WHERE THEY WANT TO 
SIGN AS OPPOSED TO WHERE THE    
YOU WOULD ENTER THEIR OFFICE    

00:59:52.417 --> 00:59:53.449
SIGN AS OPPOSED TO WHERE THE    
YOU WOULD ENTER THEIR OFFICE    
SPACE OFF A DETROIT STREET, I   

00:59:53.451 --> 00:59:56.653
YOU WOULD ENTER THEIR OFFICE    
SPACE OFF A DETROIT STREET, I   
THINK THEY COULD COMPLY WITH    

00:59:56.655 --> 00:59:57.387
SPACE OFF A DETROIT STREET, I   
THINK THEY COULD COMPLY WITH    
THE ORDINANCE BY PUTTING IT     

00:59:57.389 --> 00:59:58.254
THINK THEY COULD COMPLY WITH    
THE ORDINANCE BY PUTTING IT     
WHERE THE ENTRANCES TO THEIR    

00:59:58.256 --> 00:59:59.956
THE ORDINANCE BY PUTTING IT     
WHERE THE ENTRANCES TO THEIR    
OFFICE SPACE DETROIT STREET.    

00:59:59.958 --> 01:00:00.891
WHERE THE ENTRANCES TO THEIR    
OFFICE SPACE DETROIT STREET.    
BUT THEY COULD ALSO YOU'VE GOT  

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:04.761
OFFICE SPACE DETROIT STREET.    
BUT THEY COULD ALSO YOU'VE GOT  
THE DECORATIVE GRASSES THAT YOU 

01:00:04.763 --> 01:00:05.695
BUT THEY COULD ALSO YOU'VE GOT  
THE DECORATIVE GRASSES THAT YOU 
SEE THAT ARE REALLY TALL THAT   

01:00:05.697 --> 01:00:09.131
THE DECORATIVE GRASSES THAT YOU 
SEE THAT ARE REALLY TALL THAT   
HAVE SECURE ANOTHER PLACE THAT  

01:00:09.133 --> 01:00:12.268
SEE THAT ARE REALLY TALL THAT   
HAVE SECURE ANOTHER PLACE THAT  
GRAY SPACE THAT COULD ALSO HAVE 

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:13.003
HAVE SECURE ANOTHER PLACE THAT  
GRAY SPACE THAT COULD ALSO HAVE 
THE SIGN AND BE IN COMPLIANCE   

01:00:13.005 --> 01:00:15.571
GRAY SPACE THAT COULD ALSO HAVE 
THE SIGN AND BE IN COMPLIANCE   
WITH THE ORDINANCE.             

01:00:15.573 --> 01:00:16.873
THE SIGN AND BE IN COMPLIANCE   
WITH THE ORDINANCE.             
SO I SEE IF THEY WANT TO BE ON  

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:19.408
WITH THE ORDINANCE.             
SO I SEE IF THEY WANT TO BE ON  
THIS FACADE CHANGE THE          

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.377
SO I SEE IF THEY WANT TO BE ON  
THIS FACADE CHANGE THE          
LANDSCAPING, PUT IT ON THIS     

01:00:20.379 --> 01:00:21.044
THIS FACADE CHANGE THE          
LANDSCAPING, PUT IT ON THIS     
FACADE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE   

01:00:21.046 --> 01:00:24.181
LANDSCAPING, PUT IT ON THIS     
FACADE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE
