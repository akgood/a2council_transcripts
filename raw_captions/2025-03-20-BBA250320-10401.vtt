00:08:57.884 --> 00:09:00.084
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M         
UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY,    
MIKE.                           

00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:04.089
UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY,    
MIKE.                           
>> SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS  

00:09:04.091 --> 00:09:05.022
MIKE.                           
>> SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS  
RELIEF FROM FULL HEIGHT WALLS.  

00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:08.593
>> SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS  
RELIEF FROM FULL HEIGHT WALLS.  
BUT AS I READ THE CODE IT LOOKS 

00:09:08.595 --> 00:09:09.394
RELIEF FROM FULL HEIGHT WALLS.  
BUT AS I READ THE CODE IT LOOKS 
LIKE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE FULL 

00:09:09.396 --> 00:09:09.794
BUT AS I READ THE CODE IT LOOKS 
LIKE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE FULL 
HEIGHT.                         

00:09:09.796 --> 00:09:10.528
LIKE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE FULL 
HEIGHT.                         
THEY HAVE TO BE FORTY EIGHT     

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.065
HEIGHT.                         
THEY HAVE TO BE FORTY EIGHT     
INCHES IS THAT TRUE?            

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:18.803
THEY HAVE TO BE FORTY EIGHT     
INCHES IS THAT TRUE?            
I DON'T RECALL A SPECIFIC       

00:09:18.805 --> 00:09:21.439
INCHES IS THAT TRUE?            
I DON'T RECALL A SPECIFIC       
HEIGHT FOR THE WALLS.           

00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:25.242
I DON'T RECALL A SPECIFIC       
HEIGHT FOR THE WALLS.           
WELL I WAS READING IN AND YOU   

00:09:25.244 --> 00:09:26.177
HEIGHT FOR THE WALLS.           
WELL I WAS READING IN AND YOU   
YOU'RE MUCH MORE WELL VERSED IN 

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:27.144
WELL I WAS READING IN AND YOU   
YOU'RE MUCH MORE WELL VERSED IN 
THIS THAN I AM BUT IT SAYS      

00:09:27.146 --> 00:09:29.780
YOU'RE MUCH MORE WELL VERSED IN 
THIS THAN I AM BUT IT SAYS      
SPECIFICALLY FORTY EIGHT INCHES 

00:09:29.782 --> 00:09:33.418
THIS THAN I AM BUT IT SAYS      
SPECIFICALLY FORTY EIGHT INCHES 
IN ONE OF THE SECTIONS.         

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.485
SPECIFICALLY FORTY EIGHT INCHES 
IN ONE OF THE SECTIONS.         
SO IF THAT IS THE HEIGHT THAT   

00:09:34.487 --> 00:09:35.352
IN ONE OF THE SECTIONS.         
SO IF THAT IS THE HEIGHT THAT   
WE NEED TO HAVE WE CAN MAKE     

00:09:35.354 --> 00:09:37.788
SO IF THAT IS THE HEIGHT THAT   
WE NEED TO HAVE WE CAN MAKE     
THAT WORK BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN  

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.593
WE NEED TO HAVE WE CAN MAKE     
THAT WORK BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN  
SEE OVER THAT HEIGHT WALL THAT  

00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:47.966
THAT WORK BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN  
SEE OVER THAT HEIGHT WALL THAT  
WOULD BE FINE                   

00:09:48.234 --> 00:10:00.011
              HAD IT A MINUTE   
AGO WALLS IT'S PAGE ELEVEN I    
THINK MINIMUM HEIGHT OF NOT     

00:10:00.013 --> 00:10:03.013
AGO WALLS IT'S PAGE ELEVEN I    
THINK MINIMUM HEIGHT OF NOT     
LESS THAN FOUR FEET TWELVE TEN  

00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:09.454
THINK MINIMUM HEIGHT OF NOT     
LESS THAN FOUR FEET TWELVE TEN  
POINT TWO POINT TWO             

00:10:10.322 --> 00:10:13.224
                   .            
I THINK THAT JUST REFERS TO THE 
HEIGHT WHERE A NON-POROUS       

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:17.662
I THINK THAT JUST REFERS TO THE 
HEIGHT WHERE A NON-POROUS       
SURFACE NEEDS TO BE USED WHICH  

00:10:17.664 --> 00:10:18.195
HEIGHT WHERE A NON-POROUS       
SURFACE NEEDS TO BE USED WHICH  
IS INTERESTING.                 

00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:20.998
SURFACE NEEDS TO BE USED WHICH  
IS INTERESTING.                 
YEAH, I HATE THAT LESS THAN     

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.599
IS INTERESTING.                 
YEAH, I HATE THAT LESS THAN     
FOUR FEET ABOVE THE FLOOR       

00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:22.200
YEAH, I HATE THAT LESS THAN     
FOUR FEET ABOVE THE FLOOR       
EXCEPT FOR THE STRUCTURAL       

00:10:22.202 --> 00:10:24.268
FOUR FEET ABOVE THE FLOOR       
EXCEPT FOR THE STRUCTURAL       
ELEMENTS MATERIALS USED IN SUCH 

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.705
EXCEPT FOR THE STRUCTURAL       
ELEMENTS MATERIALS USED IN SUCH 
WALLS.                          

00:10:27.707 --> 00:10:28.038
ELEMENTS MATERIALS USED IN SUCH 
WALLS.

SO THIS IS THAT THAT PART IS    
JUST TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE    

00:10:31.778 --> 00:10:32.576
SO THIS IS THAT THAT PART IS    
JUST TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE    
NON-POROUS SURFACES ARE QUITE

FULL HEIGHT ACCORDING TO CODE . 
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THERE WOULD 

00:21:23.962 --> 00:21:24.762
FULL HEIGHT ACCORDING TO CODE . 
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THERE WOULD 
BE ADDRESSED IF YOU DON'T HAVE

A FULL WALL.                    
SO IF THE WALLS ARE FULL HEIGHT 
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A   

00:21:31.637 --> 00:21:32.503

THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A   
TEACHER GO INTO THE BATHROOM.

THOSE CHANGING STATIONS AND THE 
PRESCHOOL TOILET ROOMS HAVE A   
EVENT ABOVE THEM WORKS GREAT OK 

00:22:17.048 --> 00:22:21.284
YOU HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE SO    
I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH ALL  
THE REQUIREMENTS WE'RE GOING TO 

00:22:21.286 --> 00:22:22.186
I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH ALL  
THE REQUIREMENTS WE'RE GOING TO 
LOOK TO GET AROUND IT AS FAR AS 

00:22:22.188 --> 00:22:24.788
THE REQUIREMENTS WE'RE GOING TO 
LOOK TO GET AROUND IT AS FAR AS 
THE STAFFING ISSUE, IS IT A     

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:25.322
LOOK TO GET AROUND IT AS FAR AS 
THE STAFFING ISSUE, IS IT A     
BIBLICAL ISSUE?                 

00:22:25.324 --> 00:22:31.896
THE STAFFING ISSUE, IS IT A     
BIBLICAL ISSUE?                 
YOU KNOW, HOW IS IT MANAGED?    

00:22:31.898 --> 00:22:32.896
BIBLICAL ISSUE?                 
YOU KNOW, HOW IS IT MANAGED?    
I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS     

00:22:32.898 --> 00:22:36.267
YOU KNOW, HOW IS IT MANAGED?    
I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS     
WOULD BE WHAT IS THE INTENT     

00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:39.737
I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS     
WOULD BE WHAT IS THE INTENT     
OF THE BUILDING CODE ?          

00:22:39.739 --> 00:22:40.871
WOULD BE WHAT IS THE INTENT     
OF THE BUILDING CODE ?          
IT TALKS ABOUT PRIVACY QUITE    

00:22:40.873 --> 00:22:44.341
OF THE BUILDING CODE ?          
IT TALKS ABOUT PRIVACY QUITE    
FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT BUT FOR   

00:22:44.343 --> 00:22:46.910
IT TALKS ABOUT PRIVACY QUITE    
FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT BUT FOR   
THESE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN       

00:22:46.912 --> 00:22:50.915
FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT BUT FOR   
THESE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN       
PRIVACY IS NOT THEIR ISSUE.     

00:22:50.917 --> 00:22:52.115
THESE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN       
PRIVACY IS NOT THEIR ISSUE.     
SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHY    

00:22:52.117 --> 00:22:55.085
PRIVACY IS NOT THEIR ISSUE.     
SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHY    
THE CODE STATES THAT IF YOU     

00:22:55.087 --> 00:22:55.953
SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHY    
THE CODE STATES THAT IF YOU     
HAVE TWO IN A ROOM THERE'S ONE  

00:22:55.955 --> 00:22:59.023
THE CODE STATES THAT IF YOU     
HAVE TWO IN A ROOM THERE'S ONE
