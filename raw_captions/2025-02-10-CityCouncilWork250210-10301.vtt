IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.      
SO THERE WE HAVE A FULL TIME IN 
THE CITY WHO WOULD DO NOTHING   

00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:23.257
SO THERE WE HAVE A FULL TIME IN 
THE CITY WHO WOULD DO NOTHING   
BUT THE CITY SITE AND THEIR     

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:26.027
THE CITY WHO WOULD DO NOTHING   
BUT THE CITY SITE AND THEIR     
WHOLE JOB WOULD BE TO FORM      

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:26.694

RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE          
LANDLORD.

SIDE, IT IS THE LANDLORD SIDE   

00:13:31.434 --> 00:13:34.402
BUSINESS IS NOT THE SOFTWARE    
SIDE, IT IS THE LANDLORD SIDE   
AND SO REALLY THE VALUE THAT    

00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:35.203

AND SO REALLY THE VALUE THAT    
WE'RE BRINGING TO THE RENTER IS 

00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:38.406
AND SO REALLY THE VALUE THAT    
WE'RE BRINGING TO THE RENTER IS 
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVERY  

00:13:38.408 --> 00:13:39.073
WE'RE BRINGING TO THE RENTER IS 
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVERY  
PROPERTY FOR THEM AND THEN THE  

00:13:39.075 --> 00:13:39.807
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVERY  
PROPERTY FOR THEM AND THEN THE  
DATA ON THAT'S GOING TO BE UP   

00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:40.908
PROPERTY FOR THEM AND THEN THE  
DATA ON THAT'S GOING TO BE UP

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.043
DATA ON THAT'S GOING TO BE UP

AND SO TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO    
HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM    

00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:45.380
AND SO TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO    
HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM

00:19:29.959 --> 00:19:30.957
COLLEGE AND ALSO NON RENTER IN  
A NON UNIVERSITY AFFILIATED.    
SO I CAN IMAGINE THIS SITE      

00:19:30.959 --> 00:19:31.626
A NON UNIVERSITY AFFILIATED.    
SO I CAN IMAGINE THIS SITE      
CATERING VERY MUCH THE SAME     

00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:34.127
SO I CAN IMAGINE THIS SITE      
CATERING VERY MUCH THE SAME     
POPULATION THERE BEING SOME     

00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:34.795
CATERING VERY MUCH THE SAME     
POPULATION THERE BEING SOME     
TYPE OF CONFUSION AROUND WHAT   

00:19:34.797 --> 00:19:37.131
POPULATION THERE BEING SOME     
TYPE OF CONFUSION AROUND WHAT   
THOSE TWO RESOURCES LOOK LIKE.  

00:19:37.133 --> 00:19:40.934
TYPE OF CONFUSION AROUND WHAT   
THOSE TWO RESOURCES LOOK LIKE.  
IS THERE A REASON THAT THESE    

00:19:40.936 --> 00:19:41.936
THOSE TWO RESOURCES LOOK LIKE.  
IS THERE A REASON THAT THESE    
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BE MERGED  

00:19:41.938 --> 00:19:42.669
IS THERE A REASON THAT THESE    
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BE MERGED  
AND IN A COMMUNITY LIKE OURS    

00:19:42.671 --> 00:19:45.272
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BE MERGED  
AND IN A COMMUNITY LIKE OURS    
WHERE WE HAVE BOTH POPULATIONS  

00:19:45.274 --> 00:19:47.808
AND IN A COMMUNITY LIKE OURS    
WHERE WE HAVE BOTH POPULATIONS  
SO I THINK THE UNIVERSITY       

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.742
WHERE WE HAVE BOTH POPULATIONS  
SO I THINK THE UNIVERSITY       
OF MICHIGAN JUST DOES A REALLY  

00:19:48.744 --> 00:19:49.476
SO I THINK THE UNIVERSITY       
OF MICHIGAN JUST DOES A REALLY  
GOOD JOB FOR STUDENTS IN        

00:19:49.478 --> 00:19:52.446
OF MICHIGAN JUST DOES A REALLY  
GOOD JOB FOR STUDENTS IN        
PARTICULAR AND THERE'S THINGS   

00:19:52.448 --> 00:19:53.247
GOOD JOB FOR STUDENTS IN        
PARTICULAR AND THERE'S THINGS   
LIKE THEY USE THEIR STUDENT LOG 

00:19:53.249 --> 00:19:56.383
PARTICULAR AND THERE'S THINGS   
LIKE THEY USE THEIR STUDENT LOG 
IN TO GET INTO THE ROOMMATE AND 

00:19:56.385 --> 00:19:56.784
LIKE THEY USE THEIR STUDENT LOG 
IN TO GET INTO THE ROOMMATE AND 
SUBLEASED PAGE.                 

00:19:56.786 --> 00:19:57.518
IN TO GET INTO THE ROOMMATE AND 
SUBLEASED PAGE.                 
IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT          

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.154
SUBLEASED PAGE.                 
IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT          
EXPERIENCE THAN IF YOU'RE A NON 

00:20:00.156 --> 00:20:00.688
IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT          
EXPERIENCE THAN IF YOU'RE A NON 
STUDENT RENTER.                 

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:01.289
EXPERIENCE THAN IF YOU'RE A NON 
STUDENT RENTER.                 
FOR EXAMPLE, STUDENTS FIND      

00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:03.291
STUDENT RENTER.                 
FOR EXAMPLE, STUDENTS FIND      
HOUSING SIX MONTHS TO NINE      

00:20:03.293 --> 00:20:03.824
FOR EXAMPLE, STUDENTS FIND      
HOUSING SIX MONTHS TO NINE      
MONTHS IN ADVANCE.              

00:20:03.826 --> 00:20:07.961
HOUSING SIX MONTHS TO NINE      
MONTHS IN ADVANCE.              
SO IF YOUR FACULTY AND STAFF OR 

00:20:07.963 --> 00:20:08.962
MONTHS IN ADVANCE.              
SO IF YOUR FACULTY AND STAFF OR 
JUST A STUDENT IN THE CITY      

00:20:08.964 --> 00:20:11.598
SO IF YOUR FACULTY AND STAFF OR 
JUST A STUDENT IN THE CITY      
FINDING HOUSING IS VERY         

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:11.932
JUST A STUDENT IN THE CITY      
FINDING HOUSING IS VERY         
DIFFERENT.                      

00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:12.800
FINDING HOUSING IS VERY         
DIFFERENT.                      
AND SO IF YOU GO TO THAT SITE   

00:20:12.802 --> 00:20:13.700
DIFFERENT.                      
AND SO IF YOU GO TO THAT SITE   
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO   

00:20:13.702 --> 00:20:16.470
AND SO IF YOU GO TO THAT SITE   
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO   
USE THAT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO   

00:20:16.472 --> 00:20:16.870
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO   
USE THAT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO   
USE IT.                         

00:20:16.872 --> 00:20:17.871
USE THAT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO   
USE IT.                         
SO I KNOW THAT'S A HUGE PART    

00:20:17.873 --> 00:20:20.407
USE IT.

CHALLENGING AND THEN REALLY     
STARTING TO DO SOME KNOWLEDGE   

00:25:13.636 --> 00:25:16.136

THAT THERE'S A LOT              
OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND  
SUBJECT MATTER KNOWLEDGE IN     

00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:20.874
OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND  
SUBJECT MATTER KNOWLEDGE IN     
THOSE KEY PROGRAM AREAS.        

00:25:20.876 --> 00:25:24.211
SUBJECT MATTER KNOWLEDGE IN     
THOSE KEY PROGRAM AREAS.        
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THAT 

00:25:24.213 --> 00:25:24.944
THOSE KEY PROGRAM AREAS.        
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THAT 
WE NEED TO CROSS OVER AND       

00:25:24.946 --> 00:25:27.547
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THAT 
WE NEED TO CROSS OVER AND       
CREATE LESS SILOS WITHIN EACH   

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:28.682
WE NEED TO CROSS OVER AND       
CREATE LESS SILOS WITHIN EACH   
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT  

00:25:28.684 --> 00:25:29.216
CREATE LESS SILOS WITHIN EACH   
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT  
THE ORGANIZATION MORE           

00:25:29.218 --> 00:25:30.984
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT  
THE ORGANIZATION MORE           
HOLISTICALLY.                   

00:25:30.986 --> 00:25:36.256
THE ORGANIZATION MORE           
HOLISTICALLY.                   
SO THE PRIMARY FOCUS OVER THE   

00:25:36.258 --> 00:25:36.924
HOLISTICALLY.                   
SO THE PRIMARY FOCUS OVER THE   
LAST SIX MONTHS HAS BEEN VERY   

00:25:36.926 --> 00:25:38.892
SO THE PRIMARY FOCUS OVER THE   
LAST SIX MONTHS HAS BEEN VERY   
MUCH INTERNAL TO H.R. IN TERMS  

00:25:38.894 --> 00:25:39.759
LAST SIX MONTHS HAS BEEN VERY   
MUCH INTERNAL TO H.R. IN TERMS

SOME COMFORT , CREATING         
COMMUNICATION AND TEAM DYNAMICS 

00:25:43.432 --> 00:25:46.967

A LITTLE LESS IN TERMS THE      
ORGANIZATION EXTERNALLY.        

00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:54.375
A LITTLE LESS IN TERMS THE      
ORGANIZATION EXTERNALLY.        
SO THAT'S OUR GOING TO BE OUR   

00:26:08.056 --> 00:26:10.590
FOCUS OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. 
BUT IN ADDITION TO REALLY       
FOCUSING INTERNALLY, THERE WERE 

00:26:10.592 --> 00:26:11.257
BUT IN ADDITION TO REALLY

A FEW KEY AREAS THAT H.R. HAD   
SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT IN AND  
SO WE RECENTLY NEGOTIATED TWO

YOU'VE SEEN BOTH OF THOSE       

00:26:13.729 --> 00:26:14.528

WITH THE DISTRICT COURT         
EMPLOYEE.

SO THEY ARE VERY CAR CENTRIC.   

00:55:26.146 --> 00:55:29.080
NEAR HIGHWAY INTERCHANGES.      
SO THEY ARE VERY CAR CENTRIC.   
THEY HAVE LARGE PARKING LOTS    

00:55:29.082 --> 00:55:29.948
SO THEY ARE VERY CAR CENTRIC.   
THEY HAVE LARGE PARKING LOTS    
LIKE I MENTIONED THEY ARE NO

00:55:33.386 --> 00:55:36.889
LIKE I MENTIONED THEY ARE NO    
ONE'S DESIRED FORMAT AND THE    
GOAL WOULD BE TO TRANSITION     

00:55:36.891 --> 00:55:37.889

00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:41.059
GOAL WOULD BE TO TRANSITION     
OVER TIME INTO WALKABLE MIXED   
USE HUBS.

OVER TIME INTO WALKABLE MIXED   
USE HUBS.                       
THERE WAS JUST A SLIGHT

USE HUBS.                       
THERE WAS JUST A SLIGHT

00:55:45.031 --> 00:55:45.964
THERE WAS JUST A SLIGHT         
DIFFERENCE IN HOW TO DO THAT.   
AND SO STEPH HAD PROPOSED       

00:55:45.966 --> 00:55:48.900
DIFFERENCE IN HOW TO DO THAT.   
AND SO STEPH HAD PROPOSED       
RELAXING SOME OF THE FORM BASED 

00:55:48.902 --> 00:55:49.734
AND SO STEPH HAD PROPOSED       
RELAXING SOME OF THE FORM BASED 
STANDARDS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE 

00:55:49.736 --> 00:55:52.937
RELAXING SOME OF THE FORM BASED 
STANDARDS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE 
A MORE INCREMENTAL APPROACH.    

00:55:52.939 --> 00:55:54.039
STANDARDS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE 
A MORE INCREMENTAL APPROACH.    
>> SO THINK OF LOTS IN THOSE    

00:55:54.041 --> 00:55:57.008
A MORE INCREMENTAL APPROACH.    
>> SO THINK OF LOTS IN THOSE    
PARKING LOTS FOR EXAMPLE,       

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:57.842
>> SO THINK OF LOTS IN THOSE    
PARKING LOTS FOR EXAMPLE,       
PLANNING COMMISSION WANTED A

PARKING LOTS FOR EXAMPLE,       
PLANNING COMMISSION WANTED A    
MORE COMPLETE SORT OF OVERHAUL  

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:04.082
PLANNING COMMISSION WANTED A    
MORE COMPLETE SORT OF OVERHAUL  
OF THAT OF REDEVELOPMENT WHEN   

00:56:04.084 --> 00:56:08.386
MORE COMPLETE SORT OF OVERHAUL  
OF THAT OF REDEVELOPMENT WHEN   
WE EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT, YOU  

00:56:08.388 --> 00:56:09.320
OF THAT OF REDEVELOPMENT WHEN   
WE EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT, YOU  
KNOW, IN ORDER TO TRANSITION    

00:56:09.322 --> 00:56:12.690
WE EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT, YOU  
KNOW, IN ORDER TO TRANSITION    
THESE AREAS IT'S GOING TO TAKE  

00:56:12.692 --> 00:56:16.328
KNOW, IN ORDER TO TRANSITION    
THESE AREAS IT'S GOING TO TAKE  
A LONG TIME AND THAT A LOT      

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:16.929
THESE AREAS IT'S GOING TO TAKE  
A LONG TIME AND THAT A LOT      
OF THESE STORES OR THESE

SO SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO COME   

00:56:21.769 --> 00:56:24.503
OF 40 YEAR LONG LEASES.         
SO SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO COME   
IN, BUY ALL OF THOSE LEASES     

00:56:24.505 --> 00:56:25.303
SO SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO COME   
IN, BUY ALL OF THOSE LEASES     
OUT, POTENTIALLY DEMOLISH THOSE

THEY COULD EVEN START TO        
REDEVELOP THAT.                 
THIS IS GOING TO DELAY THE      

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.648
REDEVELOP THAT.                 
THIS IS GOING TO DELAY THE      
PROCESS QUITE A BIT AND SO THAT 

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:37.282
THIS IS GOING TO DELAY THE      
PROCESS QUITE A BIT AND SO THAT 
IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

01:01:51.398 --> 01:01:52.296
NEIGHBORHOODS.                  
SO WE STARTED USING THAT AS A   
WAY TO ILLUSTRATE AND WE'RE NOT

SO WE STARTED USING THAT AS A   
WAY TO ILLUSTRATE AND WE'RE NOT

NEIGHBORHOODS.                  
BUT IT WAS IT WAS A QUESTION    
THAT WHETHER OR NOT THE NUMBER

BUT IT WAS IT WAS A QUESTION    
THAT WHETHER OR NOT THE NUMBER  
OF UNITS WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO   

01:03:17.617 --> 01:03:20.484
THAT WHETHER OR NOT THE NUMBER  
OF UNITS WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO   
TO DO THAT SCALE SO AND I DON'T 

01:03:20.486 --> 01:03:23.054
OF UNITS WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO   
TO DO THAT SCALE SO AND I DON'T 
SIT HERE KNOWING WHAT THAT      

01:03:23.056 --> 01:03:23.755
TO DO THAT SCALE SO AND I DON'T 
SIT HERE KNOWING WHAT THAT      
RECOMMENDATION WILL BE BUT BUT  

01:03:23.757 --> 01:03:24.622
SIT HERE KNOWING WHAT THAT      
RECOMMENDATION WILL BE BUT BUT  
I THINK THE PLAN IS GOING TO    

01:03:24.624 --> 01:03:27.292
RECOMMENDATION WILL BE BUT BUT  
I THINK THE PLAN IS GOING TO    
ATTEMPT TO DEFINE OR IDENTIFY   

01:03:27.294 --> 01:03:30.595
I THINK THE PLAN IS GOING TO    
ATTEMPT TO DEFINE OR IDENTIFY   
THE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT     

01:03:30.597 --> 01:03:31.730
ATTEMPT TO DEFINE OR IDENTIFY   
THE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT     
FORM BASED SCALE IS TO SORT     

01:03:31.732 --> 01:03:32.330
THE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT     
FORM BASED SCALE IS TO SORT     
OF GET TO SOME OF THOSE         

01:03:32.332 --> 01:03:35.166
FORM BASED SCALE IS TO SORT     
OF GET TO SOME OF THOSE         
CONCERNS BECAUSE CERTAINLY EVEN 

01:03:35.168 --> 01:03:35.867
OF GET TO SOME OF THOSE         
CONCERNS BECAUSE CERTAINLY EVEN 
WITH THAT I'M SURE THAT THERE   

01:03:35.869 --> 01:03:38.869
CONCERNS BECAUSE CERTAINLY EVEN 
WITH THAT I'M SURE THAT THERE   
ARE SOME THAT WERE LIKE I       

01:03:38.871 --> 01:03:39.637
WITH THAT I'M SURE THAT THERE   
ARE SOME THAT WERE LIKE I       
THOUGHT YOU SAID FOUR UNITS AND 

01:03:39.639 --> 01:03:39.971
ARE SOME THAT WERE LIKE I       
THOUGHT YOU SAID FOUR UNITS AND 
THAT'S IT.                      

01:03:39.973 --> 01:03:42.774
THOUGHT YOU SAID FOUR UNITS AND 
THAT'S IT.                      
I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY   

01:03:42.776 --> 01:03:43.575
THAT'S IT.                      
I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY   
ANOTHER CATEGORY OF PEOPLE WHO  

01:03:43.577 --> 01:03:44.309
I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY   
ANOTHER CATEGORY OF PEOPLE WHO  
ARE MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT THE 

01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:47.411
ANOTHER CATEGORY OF PEOPLE WHO  
ARE MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT THE 
SCALABILITY OF IT IS AND AREN'T 

01:03:47.413 --> 01:03:48.113
ARE MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT THE 
SCALABILITY OF IT IS AND AREN'T 
SO IMPORTANT WHETHER THAT'S     

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:50.882
SCALABILITY OF IT IS AND AREN'T 
SO IMPORTANT WHETHER THAT'S     
THREE UNITS OR FOUR UNITS OR    

01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:51.282
SO IMPORTANT WHETHER THAT'S     
THREE UNITS OR FOUR UNITS OR    
SIX UNITS.                      

01:03:51.284 --> 01:03:52.416
THREE UNITS OR FOUR UNITS OR    
SIX UNITS.                      
SO SO I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT 

01:03:52.418 --> 01:03:54.152
SIX UNITS.                      
SO SO I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT 
THAT TO GO UNSAID.              

01:03:54.154 --> 01:03:55.153
SO SO I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT 
THAT TO GO UNSAID.              
I THINK THAT THERE WAS A        

01:03:55.155 --> 01:03:55.887
THAT TO GO UNSAID.              
I THINK THAT THERE WAS A        
RECOGNITION THAT THERE NEEDS TO 

01:03:55.889 --> 01:03:57.788
I THINK THAT THERE WAS A        
RECOGNITION THAT THERE NEEDS TO 
BE A SCALABILITY AND THAT'S     

01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:58.657
RECOGNITION THAT THERE NEEDS TO 
BE A SCALABILITY AND THAT'S     
SOMETHING WE THINK WE CAN FIND  

01:03:58.659 --> 01:03:59.390
BE A SCALABILITY AND THAT'S     
SOMETHING WE THINK WE CAN FIND  
IN THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO

01:04:52.579 --> 01:04:56.180
GO AHEAD.                       
I CAN START BECAUSE THERE IS SO 
MUCH PENT UP DEMAND FOR

HOUSING.                        
THE FEAR IS THAT IF WE DON'T    
LIMIT THE AMOUNT IN THAT ZONE   

01:05:00.554 --> 01:05:01.352
THE FEAR IS THAT IF WE DON'T    
LIMIT THE AMOUNT IN THAT ZONE   
THAT IT COULD COMPLETELY TAKE   

01:05:01.354 --> 01:05:01.686
LIMIT THE AMOUNT IN THAT ZONE

BIOTECH COMPANIES AND           
RESIDENTIAL THERE IS A CONCERN  
THAT IT COULD ALL BECOME        

01:05:09.329 --> 01:05:11.396
RESIDENTIAL THERE IS A CONCERN  
THAT IT COULD ALL BECOME        
RESIDENTIAL BECAUSE OF THE      

01:05:11.398 --> 01:05:12.263
THAT IT COULD ALL BECOME        
RESIDENTIAL BECAUSE OF THE

BUT WE ARE STARTING TO ANSWER   

01:07:07.947 --> 01:07:08.546
BETTER SENSE OF THAT.           
BUT WE ARE STARTING TO ANSWER   
SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS.        

01:07:08.548 --> 01:07:10.548
BUT WE ARE STARTING TO ANSWER   
SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS.        
WE'RE STARTING TO ANSWER SOME   

01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:11.349
SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS.        
WE'RE STARTING TO ANSWER SOME   
OF THE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS  

01:07:11.351 --> 01:07:14.519
WE'RE STARTING TO ANSWER SOME   
OF THE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS  
ABOUT THINGS LIKE SANTARUS WHO  

01:07:14.521 --> 01:07:15.386
OF THE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS  
ABOUT THINGS LIKE SANTARUS WHO  
ARE STORMWATER, WATER, ALL      

01:07:15.388 --> 01:07:20.858
ABOUT THINGS LIKE SANTARUS WHO  
ARE STORMWATER, WATER, ALL      
OF THOSE ARE THOSE ANALYZES     

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:21.459
ARE STORMWATER, WATER, ALL      
OF THOSE ARE THOSE ANALYZES     
COME BASED ON PRINCIPLES,       

01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:21.792
OF THOSE ARE THOSE ANALYZES     
COME BASED ON PRINCIPLES,       
RIGHT?                          

01:07:21.794 --> 01:07:24.461
COME BASED ON PRINCIPLES,       
RIGHT?                          
THEY COME BASED ON PROJECTIONS  

01:07:24.463 --> 01:07:25.496
RIGHT?                          
THEY COME BASED ON PROJECTIONS  
HOW MANY PEOPLE WATERS ARE USED 

01:07:25.498 --> 01:07:26.330
THEY COME BASED ON PROJECTIONS  
HOW MANY PEOPLE WATERS ARE USED 
NOW AND WHAT IS OUR PROJECTED   

01:07:26.332 --> 01:07:29.501
HOW MANY PEOPLE WATERS ARE USED 
NOW AND WHAT IS OUR PROJECTED   
USE.                            

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:30.568
NOW AND WHAT IS OUR PROJECTED   
USE.                            
AND SO THE IMPACT OF THOSE      

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:33.871
USE.                            
AND SO THE IMPACT OF THOSE      
STUDIES IS GOING TO I WOULD SAY 

01:07:33.873 --> 01:07:40.178
AND SO THE IMPACT OF THOSE      
STUDIES IS GOING TO I WOULD SAY 
IMPACT THE IMPLEMENTATION       

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.895
OF OUR VISION IN THIS           
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND AN       
EXTREME EXAMPLE IF WE PUT SOME  

01:07:56.897 --> 01:07:57.695
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND AN       
EXTREME EXAMPLE IF WE PUT SOME  
ZONE ON THAT MAP IT SAYS WE     

01:07:57.697 --> 01:07:58.429
EXTREME EXAMPLE IF WE PUT SOME  
ZONE ON THAT MAP IT SAYS WE     
THINK THAT THIS IS A HIGH       

01:07:58.431 --> 01:07:59.096
ZONE ON THAT MAP IT SAYS WE     
THINK THAT THIS IS A HIGH       
POTENTIAL FOR DENSIFICATION     

01:07:59.098 --> 01:07:59.764
THINK THAT THIS IS A HIGH       
POTENTIAL FOR DENSIFICATION     
GROWTH AND A FULL DIVERSITY     

01:07:59.766 --> 01:08:00.498

GROWTH AND A FULL DIVERSITY     
OF USES BUT SIMILAR WE FIND OUT 

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.232
GROWTH AND A FULL DIVERSITY     
OF USES BUT SIMILAR WE FIND OUT 
THAT THERE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE   

01:08:01.234 --> 01:08:01.966
OF USES BUT SIMILAR WE FIND OUT 
THAT THERE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE   
NEEDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE      

01:08:01.968 --> 01:08:02.600
THAT THERE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE   
NEEDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE      
BARRIERS TO REALIZING THE       

01:08:02.602 --> 01:08:03.268
NEEDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE      
BARRIERS TO REALIZING THE       
DEVELOPMENT AT THAT GEOGRAPHY   

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.801
BARRIERS TO REALIZING THE       
DEVELOPMENT AT THAT GEOGRAPHY   
OF THAT SCALE.                  

01:08:03.803 --> 01:08:04.402
DEVELOPMENT AT THAT GEOGRAPHY   
OF THAT SCALE.                  
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY         

01:08:04.404 --> 01:08:05.203
OF THAT SCALE.                  
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY         
IMPORTANT THAT WE COMMUNICATE   

01:08:05.205 --> 01:08:05.936
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY         
IMPORTANT THAT WE COMMUNICATE   
IN THAT PLAN THAT WE HAVE TO

IN THAT PLAN THAT WE HAVE TO    
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND      

01:08:06.539 --> 01:08:08.239
IN THAT PLAN THAT WE HAVE TO    
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND      
FACILITATE THAT SUPPLY BEFORE   

01:08:08.241 --> 01:08:08.940
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND      
FACILITATE THAT SUPPLY BEFORE   
WE FLIP THE SWITCH TO ALLOW     

01:08:08.942 --> 01:08:09.741
FACILITATE THAT SUPPLY BEFORE   
WE FLIP THE SWITCH TO ALLOW     
THOSE LAND USERS TO COME IN     

01:08:09.743 --> 01:08:12.143
WE FLIP THE SWITCH TO ALLOW     
THOSE LAND USERS TO COME IN     
PLACE TO TO GET IMPLEMENTED.    

01:08:12.145 --> 01:08:15.580
THOSE LAND USERS TO COME IN     
PLACE TO TO GET IMPLEMENTED.    
WE CAN THE COMPLAINT IS THE     

01:08:15.582 --> 01:08:16.447
PLACE TO TO GET IMPLEMENTED.    
WE CAN THE COMPLAINT IS THE     
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO IDENTIFY   

01:08:16.449 --> 01:08:17.181
WE CAN THE COMPLAINT IS THE     
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO IDENTIFY   
THAT AS OUR GOAL BUT IT'S ALSO  

01:08:17.183 --> 01:08:19.183
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO IDENTIFY   
THAT AS OUR GOAL BUT IT'S ALSO  
THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO LAY    

01:08:19.185 --> 01:08:19.918
THAT AS OUR GOAL BUT IT'S ALSO  
THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO LAY    
OUT THE VERY DELIBERATE WAY IN  

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.785
THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO LAY    
OUT THE VERY DELIBERATE WAY IN  
WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO    

01:08:20.787 --> 01:08:23.554
OUT THE VERY DELIBERATE WAY IN  
WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

WE'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS AS 
WE LEAN INTO MORE MIXED USES

MORE CHALLENGING TO MEET ALL

BREAKTHROUGH IN THOSE AREAS.    
WHY DO WE NECESSARILY ASSUME

THEN RECONSIDER IT AT SOME      
POINT IN THE FUTURE.            
I THINK I WOULD I WOULD JUST

POINT IN THE FUTURE.            
I THINK I WOULD I WOULD JUST    
SHARE THAT IT'S IT'S NOT        

01:17:07.847 --> 01:17:08.712
I THINK I WOULD I WOULD JUST    
SHARE THAT IT'S IT'S NOT        
IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S HARDER TO   

01:17:08.714 --> 01:17:12.116
SHARE THAT IT'S IT'S NOT        
IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S HARDER TO   
GO BACK THAN IT IS FORWARD.

THINK ABOUT NONCONFORMITY IS    
LIKE YOU KNOW, ZONING IS A      

01:17:20.793 --> 01:17:23.994
THINK ABOUT NONCONFORMITY IS    
LIKE YOU KNOW, ZONING IS A      
PROSPECTIVE SO WHEN WE MAKE A   

01:17:23.996 --> 01:17:24.662
LIKE YOU KNOW, ZONING IS A      
PROSPECTIVE SO WHEN WE MAKE A   
CHANGE WE DON'T REQUIRE         

01:17:24.664 --> 01:17:27.665
PROSPECTIVE SO WHEN WE MAKE A   
CHANGE WE DON'T REQUIRE         
EVERYBODY TO WHO HAS DONE

IT.                             

01:17:28.735 --> 01:17:30.801
SOMETHING IN THE PAST TO CHANGE 
IT.                             
BUT IN THE EVENT WE FOR FOR     

01:17:30.803 --> 01:17:34.438
IT.                             
BUT IN THE EVENT WE FOR FOR     
EXAMPLE ESTABLISHED ALLOWED

EXAMPLE ESTABLISHED ALLOWED     
HOUSING IN THE INDUSTRIAL THE   
MANUFACTURING ZONES THAT WE     

01:17:38.977 --> 01:17:39.510
HOUSING IN THE INDUSTRIAL THE   
MANUFACTURING ZONES THAT WE     
DON'T ALLOW TODAY AND           

01:17:39.512 --> 01:17:42.913
MANUFACTURING ZONES THAT WE     
DON'T ALLOW TODAY AND           
DEVELOPMENT HAPPEN THERE AND    

01:17:42.915 --> 01:17:43.680
DON'T ALLOW TODAY AND           
DEVELOPMENT HAPPEN THERE AND    
THEN WE CHANGE OUR MIND, WE     

01:17:43.682 --> 01:17:45.682
DEVELOPMENT HAPPEN THERE AND    
THEN WE CHANGE OUR MIND, WE     
WOULD BE RENDERING THOSE

WOULD BE RENDERING THOSE        
PROPERTIES NONCONFORMING.       
SO THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE SOME 

01:17:47.153 --> 01:17:47.684
PROPERTIES NONCONFORMING.       
SO THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE SOME 
LIMITATIONS ON THERE.           

01:17:47.686 --> 01:17:50.087
SO THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE SOME 
LIMITATIONS ON THERE.           
SO IT'S IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT 

01:17:50.089 --> 01:17:50.754
LIMITATIONS ON THERE.           
SO IT'S IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT 
IT'S MORE CHALLENGING THAN      

01:17:50.756 --> 01:17:53.690
SO IT'S IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT 
IT'S MORE CHALLENGING THAN      
GOING THE OTHER DIRECTION.      

01:17:53.692 --> 01:17:54.925
IT'S MORE CHALLENGING THAN

WE WILL HAVE TO BE REALLY       
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT MAKING SURE

WE WILL HAVE TO BE REALLY       
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT MAKING SURE    
THAT THE TIMING OF WHEN WE

THOUGHTFUL ABOUT MAKING SURE    
THAT THE TIMING OF WHEN WE      
IMPLEMENT THAT GOAL I THINK

THAT THE TIMING OF WHEN WE      
IMPLEMENT THAT GOAL I THINK     
IT'S EASY FOR HER TO ARTICULATE

IMPLEMENT THAT GOAL I THINK     
IT'S EASY FOR HER TO ARTICULATE 
A VISION AND THE PLAN.          

01:18:59.525 --> 01:19:00.457
IT'S EASY FOR HER TO ARTICULATE 
A VISION AND THE PLAN.          
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT     

01:19:00.459 --> 01:19:01.191
A VISION AND THE PLAN.          
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT     
WE'RE GOING BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT     
WE'RE GOING BE ABLE TO SUPPORT  
THOSE BUILDINGS AND THE REASON

WE'RE GOING BE ABLE TO SUPPORT  
THOSE BUILDINGS AND THE REASON  
I THINK YOUR MAYBE YOUR LAST    

01:19:06.798 --> 01:19:07.831
THOSE BUILDINGS AND THE REASON  
I THINK YOUR MAYBE YOUR LAST    
QUESTION THAT IS WHY DO WE      

01:19:07.833 --> 01:19:08.499
I THINK YOUR MAYBE YOUR LAST    
QUESTION THAT IS WHY DO WE      
THINK IT MIGHT HAPPEN THERE     

01:19:08.501 --> 01:19:13.837
QUESTION THAT IS WHY DO WE      
THINK IT MIGHT HAPPEN THERE     
VERSUS OTHER PLACES?            

01:19:13.839 --> 01:19:14.871
THINK IT MIGHT HAPPEN THERE     
VERSUS OTHER PLACES?            
>> THE OTHER AREAS HAVE BEEN    

01:19:14.873 --> 01:19:17.941
VERSUS OTHER PLACES?            
>> THE OTHER AREAS HAVE BEEN    
OPEN TO RESIDENTIAL AND         

01:19:17.943 --> 01:19:18.742
>> THE OTHER AREAS HAVE BEEN    
OPEN TO RESIDENTIAL AND         
COMMERCIAL FOR SOME TIME AND    

01:19:18.744 --> 01:19:21.311
OPEN TO RESIDENTIAL AND         
COMMERCIAL FOR SOME TIME AND    
IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I'M A REAL 

01:19:21.313 --> 01:19:22.012
COMMERCIAL FOR SOME TIME AND    
IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I'M A REAL 
ESTATE PROFESSIONAL BUT I THINK 

01:19:22.014 --> 01:19:25.515
IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I'M A REAL 
ESTATE PROFESSIONAL BUT I THINK 
PART OF THE REASON THAT AN AREA 

01:19:25.517 --> 01:19:26.250
ESTATE PROFESSIONAL BUT I THINK 
PART OF THE REASON THAT AN AREA 
LIKE SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS REALLY 

01:19:26.252 --> 01:19:29.286
PART OF THE REASON THAT AN AREA 
LIKE SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS REALLY 
ATTRACTIVE IS BECAUSE THE COST  

01:19:29.288 --> 01:19:29.987
LIKE SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS REALLY 
ATTRACTIVE IS BECAUSE THE COST  
AND THE VALUATION OF THOSE      

01:19:29.989 --> 01:19:32.889
ATTRACTIVE IS BECAUSE THE COST  
AND THE VALUATION OF THOSE      
BUILDINGS MIGHT BE LESS THAN    

01:19:32.891 --> 01:19:33.824
AND THE VALUATION OF THOSE      
BUILDINGS MIGHT BE LESS THAN    
THEY ARE IN WASHINGTON OR MIGHT 

01:19:33.826 --> 01:19:34.491
BUILDINGS MIGHT BE LESS THAN    
THEY ARE IN WASHINGTON OR MIGHT 
BE LESS THAN THEY ARE IN        

01:19:34.493 --> 01:19:34.825
THEY ARE IN WASHINGTON OR MIGHT 
BE LESS THAN THEY ARE IN        
PLYMOUTH.                       

01:19:34.827 --> 01:19:36.860
BE LESS THAN THEY ARE IN        
PLYMOUTH.                       
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE 

01:19:36.862 --> 01:19:37.561
PLYMOUTH.                       
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE 
MIGHT BE AN INCREASED CHANCE    

01:19:37.563 --> 01:19:41.031
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE 
MIGHT BE AN INCREASED CHANCE    
FOR ONE OF THE USES OF THOSE    

01:19:41.033 --> 01:19:41.832
MIGHT BE AN INCREASED CHANCE

BACKUP DISTANCES TO SHOW THAT   
HOW THIS WOULD BE SAFELY        
SERVICED AND WOULD MAKE SURE    

01:48:37.801 --> 01:48:38.533
HOW THIS WOULD BE SAFELY        
SERVICED AND WOULD MAKE SURE    
THAT THESE TRUCKS ARE NOT

TONIGHT IS THE FACT THAT THERE  

02:18:58.521 --> 02:19:01.321
OF EVERYTHING I GOING TO SAY

RESIDENTIAL USE.                
BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY TOOK A LOOK 
AT THE MAP, I THINK MOST        

02:21:55.897 --> 02:21:56.829
BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY TOOK A LOOK 
AT THE MAP, I THINK MOST        
OF THEM ARE LOCATED RIGHT ALONG 

02:21:56.831 --> 02:21:59.933
AT THE MAP, I THINK MOST        
OF THEM ARE LOCATED RIGHT ALONG 
RAILROADS AND OR DIRECTLY       

02:21:59.935 --> 02:22:00.867

02:22:04.673 --> 02:22:08.041
BELIEVE THOSE AREN'T DESIRABLE  
RESIDENTIAL LAND ANYWAYS.       
BUT IF WE LOOK AT INNOVATION    

02:22:08.043 --> 02:22:09.175
RESIDENTIAL LAND ANYWAYS.       
BUT IF WE LOOK AT INNOVATION    
THAT IS PRIME LOCATION UP NORTH 

02:22:09.177 --> 02:22:12.945
BUT IF WE LOOK AT INNOVATION    
THAT IS PRIME LOCATION UP NORTH 
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE      

02:22:12.947 --> 02:22:13.647
THAT IS PRIME LOCATION UP NORTH 
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE      
CURRENTLY THE BIGGEST SHORTAGE  

02:22:13.649 --> 02:22:16.450
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE      
CURRENTLY THE BIGGEST SHORTAGE  
UP NORTH IS NOT RESIDENTIAL     

02:22:16.452 --> 02:22:17.184
CURRENTLY THE BIGGEST SHORTAGE  
UP NORTH IS NOT RESIDENTIAL     
UNITS BUT ACTUALLY COMMERCIAL   

02:22:17.186 --> 02:22:20.220
UP NORTH IS NOT RESIDENTIAL     
UNITS BUT ACTUALLY COMMERCIAL   
BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF FRIENDS 

02:22:20.222 --> 02:22:23.623
UNITS BUT ACTUALLY COMMERCIAL   
BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF FRIENDS 
WHO GO TO SCHOOL AND CAMPUS AND 

02:22:23.625 --> 02:22:24.424
BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF FRIENDS 
WHO GO TO SCHOOL AND CAMPUS AND 
SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE UP   

02:22:24.426 --> 02:22:24.625
WHO GO TO SCHOOL AND CAMPUS AND 
SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE UP   
NORTH.                          

02:22:24.627 --> 02:22:27.860
SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE UP   
NORTH.                          
THE FIRST REASON IT'S NOT       

02:22:27.862 --> 02:22:28.694
NORTH.                          
THE FIRST REASON IT'S NOT       
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH    

02:22:28.696 --> 02:22:31.564
THE FIRST REASON IT'S NOT       
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH    
HOUSING UNITS UP NORTH BECAUSE  

02:22:31.566 --> 02:22:35.134
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH    
HOUSING UNITS UP NORTH BECAUSE  
THERE'S CLOSE TO NO AMENITIES   

02:22:35.136 --> 02:22:36.136
HOUSING UNITS UP NORTH BECAUSE  
THERE'S CLOSE TO NO AMENITIES   
FOR ANY KIND OF SOCIAL EVENTS   

02:22:36.138 --> 02:22:39.640
THERE'S CLOSE TO NO AMENITIES   
FOR ANY KIND OF SOCIAL EVENTS   
OR JUST DINING PLACES UP NORTH  

02:22:39.642 --> 02:22:42.709
FOR ANY KIND OF SOCIAL EVENTS   
OR JUST DINING PLACES UP NORTH  
AND I THINK I HEARD ABOUT THE   

02:22:42.711 --> 02:22:43.443
OR JUST DINING PLACES UP NORTH  
AND I THINK I HEARD ABOUT THE   
WORRY THAT RESIDENTIAL UNITS    

02:22:43.445 --> 02:22:46.846
AND I THINK I HEARD ABOUT THE   
WORRY THAT RESIDENTIAL UNITS    
MIGHT JUST TAKE OVER THE PLAN.  

02:22:46.848 --> 02:22:47.914
WORRY THAT RESIDENTIAL UNITS    
MIGHT JUST TAKE OVER THE PLAN.  
BUT WHAT IF WE PRIORITIZE THAT  

02:22:47.916 --> 02:22:50.684
MIGHT JUST TAKE OVER THE PLAN.  
BUT WHAT IF WE PRIORITIZE THAT  
TO BECOME COMMERCIAL USE RATHER 

02:22:50.686 --> 02:22:54.354
BUT WHAT IF WE PRIORITIZE THAT  
TO BECOME COMMERCIAL USE RATHER 
THAN RESIDENTIAL INSTEAD        

02:22:54.356 --> 02:22:54.955
TO BECOME COMMERCIAL USE RATHER 
THAN RESIDENTIAL INSTEAD        
OF PRIORITIZING LET'S SAY       

02:22:54.957 --> 02:22:58.224
THAN RESIDENTIAL INSTEAD        
OF PRIORITIZING LET'S SAY       
OFFICE SPACE BECAUSE I KNOW WE

I DON'T THINK THAT WAS AT ALL   

02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:08.527
ZONE.                           
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS AT ALL   
ABOUT LOOKING FOR MORE DENSITY  

02:34:08.529 --> 02:34:09.095
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS AT ALL   
ABOUT LOOKING FOR MORE DENSITY  
OR LARGER BUILDINGS.            

02:34:09.097 --> 02:34:09.962
ABOUT LOOKING FOR MORE DENSITY  
OR LARGER BUILDINGS.            
IT'S ABOUT MORE FLEXIBILITY     

02:34:09.964 --> 02:34:13.099
OR LARGER BUILDINGS.            
IT'S ABOUT MORE FLEXIBILITY     
WITH LIMITED TO FOUR CLASSES    

02:34:13.101 --> 02:34:13.900
IT'S ABOUT MORE FLEXIBILITY     
WITH LIMITED TO FOUR CLASSES    
THAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY CREATING   

02:34:13.902 --> 02:34:16.669
WITH LIMITED TO FOUR CLASSES    
THAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY CREATING   
AN INCENTIVE AND A LOT HAS TO

WE'RE SEEING THIS HAPPEN NOW    
UNDER OUR CURRENT ZONING CODE . 

02:34:24.545 --> 02:34:27.980
WE'RE SEEING THIS HAPPEN NOW    
UNDER OUR CURRENT ZONING CODE . 
SO WHY SHOULD WE ALLOW YOU TO   

02:34:27.982 --> 02:34:31.383
UNDER OUR CURRENT ZONING CODE . 
SO WHY SHOULD WE ALLOW YOU TO   
BUILD FOUR OR SIX BEDROOM UNITS 

02:34:31.385 --> 02:34:32.318
SO WHY SHOULD WE ALLOW YOU TO   
BUILD FOUR OR SIX BEDROOM UNITS 
BUT PREVENT YOU FROM BUILDING   

02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:32.985
BUILD FOUR OR SIX BEDROOM UNITS 
BUT PREVENT YOU FROM BUILDING   
SIX TWO BEDROOM UNITS?          

02:34:32.987 --> 02:34:35.054
BUT PREVENT YOU FROM BUILDING   
SIX TWO BEDROOM UNITS?          
THE LADDER IS ACTUALLY LESS     

02:34:35.056 --> 02:34:35.387
SIX TWO BEDROOM UNITS?          
THE LADDER IS ACTUALLY LESS     
DENSE.                          

02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:38.825
THE LADDER IS ACTUALLY LESS     
DENSE.                          
IT'S HALF AS MANY BEDS AND IF   

02:34:38.827 --> 02:34:40.025
DENSE.                          
IT'S HALF AS MANY BEDS AND IF   
WE GO WITH A UNIT DENSITY BASED 

02:34:40.027 --> 02:34:43.395
IT'S HALF AS MANY BEDS AND IF   
WE GO WITH A UNIT DENSITY BASED 
LIMIT THEN THIS IS THIS IS THE  

02:34:43.397 --> 02:34:46.732
WE GO WITH A UNIT DENSITY BASED 
LIMIT THEN THIS IS THIS IS THE  
SITUATION THAT WE'RE CREATING.  

02:34:46.734 --> 02:34:47.599
LIMIT THEN THIS IS THIS IS THE  
SITUATION THAT WE'RE CREATING.  
BUT EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTALLY     

02:34:47.601 --> 02:34:50.670
SITUATION THAT WE'RE CREATING.  
BUT EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTALLY     
THAN THAT, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD  

02:34:50.672 --> 02:34:51.537
BUT EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTALLY     
THAN THAT, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD  
GET AWAY FROM REGULATING, YOU   

02:34:51.539 --> 02:34:52.304
THAN THAT, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD  
GET AWAY FROM REGULATING, YOU   
KNOW, DENSITY THROUGH THIS      

02:34:52.306 --> 02:34:55.274
GET AWAY FROM REGULATING, YOU   
KNOW, DENSITY THROUGH THIS      
MEANS FOR A PRETTY BASIC        

02:34:55.276 --> 02:34:56.041
KNOW, DENSITY THROUGH THIS      
MEANS FOR A PRETTY BASIC        
REASON, WHICH IS THAT I DON'T   

02:34:56.043 --> 02:34:59.111
MEANS FOR A PRETTY BASIC        
REASON, WHICH IS THAT I DON'T   
THINK GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE IN   

02:34:59.113 --> 02:34:59.846
REASON, WHICH IS THAT I DON'T   
THINK GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE IN   
THE BUSINESS OF DEFINING WHAT A

THINK GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE IN   
THE BUSINESS OF DEFINING WHAT A 
FAMILY IS AND OUR UNIFIED

LITERALLY DOES THIS BUT YOU CAN 
LOOK IT UP IF WE MOVE TOWARDS   
JUST BUILDING FORM BASED        

02:35:10.524 --> 02:35:11.490
LOOK IT UP IF WE MOVE TOWARDS   
JUST BUILDING FORM BASED

COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BECAUSE

COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BECAUSE   
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T THINK

YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T THINK    
REGULATING A FAMILY IS IS THE   

02:35:18.533 --> 02:35:21.934
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T THINK    
REGULATING A FAMILY IS IS THE   
GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS.

REGULATING A FAMILY IS IS THE
