00:25:16.907 --> 00:25:19.775
DETENTION&apos;S SYSTEM IS WILL BE   
ABLE TO HANDLE THAT.            
THERE&apos;S THE MODIFICATIONS THAT

ABLE TO HANDLE THAT.            
THERE&apos;S THE MODIFICATIONS THAT

THROUGHOUT THE SITE, THAT IS    

00:25:25.082 --> 00:25:27.549
POROUS PAVERS THAT ARE USED     
THROUGHOUT THE SITE, THAT IS    
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WORKING 

00:25:27.551 --> 00:25:28.550
THROUGHOUT THE SITE, THAT IS    
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WORKING 
ON THE SITE BECAUSE IN THE PAST 

00:25:28.552 --> 00:25:29.284
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WORKING 
ON THE SITE BECAUSE IN THE PAST 
WE&apos;VE HAD SOME CONCERNS ON

WE&apos;VE HAD SOME CONCERNS ON      
THAT.                           
BUT IT DOES APPEAR TO BE        

00:25:31.922 --> 00:25:32.788
THAT.                           
BUT IT DOES APPEAR TO BE        
WORKING ON THE SITE SO THEY&apos;RE  

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.455
BUT IT DOES APPEAR TO BE        
WORKING ON THE SITE SO THEY&apos;RE  
GOING TO CONTINUE USING THOSE   

00:25:33.457 --> 00:25:36.191
WORKING ON THE SITE SO THEY&apos;RE  
GOING TO CONTINUE USING THOSE   
SO THAT WOULD HAVE SOME IMPACT  

00:25:36.193 --> 00:25:36.858
GOING TO CONTINUE USING THOSE   
SO THAT WOULD HAVE SOME IMPACT  
AGAIN TO THE NATURAL            

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.128
SO THAT WOULD HAVE SOME IMPACT  
AGAIN TO THE NATURAL

SO AS WHAT&apos;S BEFORE YOU         
REGARDING THE LANDSCAPE         
MODIFICATION IS THAT THE        

00:25:43.768 --> 00:25:46.868
REGARDING THE LANDSCAPE         
MODIFICATION IS THAT THE        
CODE REQUIRES OBVIOUSLY THREE   

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:47.836
MODIFICATION IS THAT THE        
CODE REQUIRES OBVIOUSLY THREE   
TREES TO BE PLACED WITHIN THE

00:25:48.572 --> 00:25:50.672
TREES TO BE PLACED WITHIN THE

TREES.                          

00:25:50.674 --> 00:25:51.606
RIGHT AWAY TO COUNT OF THREE    
TREES.                          
THESE TREES ARE ALREADY IN      

00:25:51.608 --> 00:25:51.940
TREES.                          
THESE TREES ARE ALREADY IN      
THERE.                          

00:25:51.942 --> 00:25:52.741
THESE TREES ARE ALREADY IN      
THERE.                          
THEY IN THERE AS PART OF THE    

00:25:52.743 --> 00:25:54.976
THERE.                          
THEY IN THERE AS PART OF THE    
PREVIOUS APPROVED SITE PLAN.    

00:25:54.978 --> 00:25:55.744
THEY IN THERE AS PART OF THE    
PREVIOUS APPROVED SITE PLAN.    
BUT CODE DOES REQUIRE BECAUSE   

00:25:55.746 --> 00:25:58.280
PREVIOUS APPROVED SITE PLAN.    
BUT CODE DOES REQUIRE BECAUSE   
THE WHOLE SITE IS BROUGHT UP TO 

00:25:58.282 --> 00:25:59.080
BUT CODE DOES REQUIRE BECAUSE   
THE WHOLE SITE IS BROUGHT UP TO 
CODE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS  

00:25:59.082 --> 00:25:59.548
THE WHOLE SITE IS BROUGHT UP TO 
CODE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS  
ALL ONE SITE.                   

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.283
CODE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS  
ALL ONE SITE.                   
SO WE AS PLANNING AT AS ONE     

00:26:02.285 --> 00:26:02.518
ALL ONE SITE.                   
SO WE AS PLANNING AT AS ONE     
SITE.                           

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.587
SO WE AS PLANNING AT AS ONE     
SITE.                           
SO THE CODE WOULD AGAIN HIT     

00:26:05.589 --> 00:26:06.388
SITE.                           
SO THE CODE WOULD AGAIN HIT     
THOSE STREET TREE REQUIREMENT   

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.222
SO THE CODE WOULD AGAIN HIT     
THOSE STREET TREE REQUIREMENT   
IN THERE BUT IT USED TO BE A    

00:26:07.224 --> 00:26:07.589
THOSE STREET TREE REQUIREMENT   
IN THERE BUT IT USED TO BE A    
VARIANCE.                       

00:26:07.591 --> 00:26:09.725
IN THERE BUT IT USED TO BE A    
VARIANCE.                       
NOW IT&apos;S A LANDSCAPE            

00:26:09.727 --> 00:26:10.192
VARIANCE.                       
NOW IT&apos;S A LANDSCAPE            
MODIFICATION.                   

00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:10.893
NOW IT&apos;S A LANDSCAPE            
MODIFICATION.                   
SO AGAIN THAT IS SUPPORTED BY   

00:26:10.895 --> 00:26:13.194
MODIFICATION.                   
SO AGAIN THAT IS SUPPORTED BY   
STAFF THE RIGHT WAY IS          

00:26:13.196 --> 00:26:13.895
SO AGAIN THAT IS SUPPORTED BY   
STAFF THE RIGHT WAY IS          
EXTREMELY NARROW THERE BETWEEN

00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:14.963
EXTREMELY NARROW THERE BETWEEN  
THE CURRENT SIDEWALK THERE&apos;S    
UTILITIES.                      

00:26:14.965 --> 00:26:17.032
THE CURRENT SIDEWALK THERE&apos;S    
UTILITIES.                      
IT&apos;S IT&apos;S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO

IT&apos;S IT&apos;S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO    
PUT THEM IN THAT AREA.          
BUT AGAIN, THAT&apos;S A SEPARATE    

00:26:20.738 --> 00:26:21.536
PUT THEM IN THAT AREA.          
BUT AGAIN, THAT&apos;S A SEPARATE    
MOTION THAT YOU NEED TO         

00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:21.804
BUT AGAIN, THAT&apos;S A SEPARATE

APPROVE.                        

00:26:21.806 --> 00:26:22.537
MOTION THAT YOU NEED TO         
APPROVE.                        
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS FROM       

00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:25.541
APPROVE.                        
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS FROM       
FOLLOW UP LAST WE HAD SOME

CONCERNS REGARDING THE TRAFFIC  

00:26:26.276 --> 00:26:28.143
FOLLOW UP LAST WE HAD SOME      
CONCERNS REGARDING THE TRAFFIC  
OF COURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   

00:26:28.145 --> 00:26:29.077
CONCERNS REGARDING THE TRAFFIC  
OF COURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   
I DID FOLLOW UP WITH THE        

00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:29.811
OF COURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   
I DID FOLLOW UP WITH THE        
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER THAT    

00:26:29.813 --> 00:26:32.314
I DID FOLLOW UP WITH THE        
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER THAT    
REVIEWED THIS SHEET, THE STUDY  

00:26:32.316 --> 00:26:35.784
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER THAT    
REVIEWED THIS SHEET, THE STUDY  
OVERALL THAT THEY WERE REQUIRED 

00:26:35.786 --> 00:26:36.719
REVIEWED THIS SHEET, THE STUDY  
OVERALL THAT THEY WERE REQUIRED 
TO CONTRIBUTE IT DID NOT HAVE   

00:26:36.721 --> 00:26:37.519
OVERALL THAT THEY WERE REQUIRED 
TO CONTRIBUTE IT DID NOT HAVE   
THE TRAFFIC CONES AT THE        

00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:40.122
TO CONTRIBUTE IT DID NOT HAVE   
THE TRAFFIC CONES AT THE

00:26:40.124 --> 00:26:40.555
THE TRAFFIC CONES AT THE        
INTERSECTIONS WITHIN THE        
ROUNDABOUT.                     

00:26:40.557 --> 00:26:41.290
INTERSECTIONS WITHIN THE        
ROUNDABOUT.                     
THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS    

00:26:41.292 --> 00:26:43.825
ROUNDABOUT.                     
THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS    
ASKED LAST TIME I ASKED FOLLOW  

00:26:43.827 --> 00:26:44.693
THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS    
ASKED LAST TIME I ASKED FOLLOW  
UP ON THAT THAT SHE JUST DIDN&apos;T 

00:26:44.695 --> 00:26:48.030
ASKED LAST TIME I ASKED FOLLOW  
UP ON THAT THAT SHE JUST DIDN&apos;T 
THOSE WERE NOT REQUIRED BY THE

THOSE WERE NOT REQUIRED BY THE  
GENERATION HERE.                

00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:49.364
THOSE WERE NOT REQUIRED BY THE  
GENERATION HERE.                
SO IT&apos;S NOT SOMETHING THAT SHE  

00:26:49.366 --> 00:26:51.332
GENERATION HERE.                
SO IT&apos;S NOT SOMETHING THAT SHE

00:26:51.334 --> 00:26:52.000
SO IT&apos;S NOT SOMETHING THAT SHE

JUST CONTEXTUALLY SPEAKING FOR  

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:45.239
AMERICAN.                       
JUST CONTEXTUALLY SPEAKING FOR  
THOSE LISTENING LET&apos;S JUST SAY  

00:39:45.241 --> 00:39:46.073
JUST CONTEXTUALLY SPEAKING FOR  
THOSE LISTENING LET&apos;S JUST SAY  
I WAS RUNNING SOME VERY ROUGH   

00:39:46.075 --> 00:39:49.476
THOSE LISTENING LET&apos;S JUST SAY  
I WAS RUNNING SOME VERY ROUGH   
MATH HERE THEY ARE VOLUNTARY    

00:39:49.478 --> 00:39:50.211
I WAS RUNNING SOME VERY ROUGH   
MATH HERE THEY ARE VOLUNTARY    
SAYING THAT THEY&apos;RE GOING TO    

00:39:50.213 --> 00:39:51.746
MATH HERE THEY ARE VOLUNTARY    
SAYING THAT THEY&apos;RE GOING TO    
REDUCE THEIR BUILDING BY ABOUT  

00:39:51.748 --> 00:39:52.480
SAYING THAT THEY&apos;RE GOING TO    
REDUCE THEIR BUILDING BY ABOUT  
FIFTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET.    

00:39:52.482 --> 00:39:56.150
REDUCE THEIR BUILDING BY ABOUT  
FIFTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET.    
SO IF WE HAVE FIFTEEN PEOPLE    

00:39:56.152 --> 00:39:56.951
FIFTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET.    
SO IF WE HAVE FIFTEEN PEOPLE    
PER SQUARE FOOT LET&apos;S JUST LOOK 

00:39:56.953 --> 00:39:59.920
SO IF WE HAVE FIFTEEN PEOPLE    
PER SQUARE FOOT LET&apos;S JUST LOOK 
AT IT THAT WAY AND THEY USE A   

00:39:59.922 --> 00:40:00.521
PER SQUARE FOOT LET&apos;S JUST LOOK 
AT IT THAT WAY AND THEY USE A   
HALF PERCENT CAP RATE.          

00:40:00.523 --> 00:40:01.255
AT IT THAT WAY AND THEY USE A   
HALF PERCENT CAP RATE.          
THEY&apos;RE LITERALLY SAYING I&apos;M    

00:40:01.257 --> 00:40:03.056
HALF PERCENT CAP RATE.          
THEY&apos;RE LITERALLY SAYING I&apos;M    
GOING TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF MY 

00:40:03.058 --> 00:40:03.725
THEY&apos;RE LITERALLY SAYING I&apos;M    
GOING TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF MY

00:40:03.727 --> 00:40:04.325
GOING TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF MY 
BUILDING BY THREE HUNDRED       
THOUSAND DOLLARS.               

00:40:04.327 --> 00:40:06.960
BUILDING BY THREE HUNDRED       
THOUSAND DOLLARS.               
SO THAT IS BASICALLY SAYING I I 

00:40:06.962 --> 00:40:07.895
THOUSAND DOLLARS.               
SO THAT IS BASICALLY SAYING I I 
DON&apos;T THINK THIS IS GOING TO    

00:40:07.897 --> 00:40:10.831
SO THAT IS BASICALLY SAYING I I 
DON&apos;T THINK THIS IS GOING TO    
LEASE FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS  

00:40:10.833 --> 00:40:11.699
DON&apos;T THINK THIS IS GOING TO    
LEASE FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS  
OF RENT JUST FROM A VALUATION   

00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:12.100
LEASE FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS  
OF RENT JUST FROM A VALUATION   
STANDPOINT.                     

00:40:12.102 --> 00:40:14.902
OF RENT JUST FROM A VALUATION

00:48:22.224 --> 00:48:22.790

YEARS OF HISTORY BUT IT APPEARS 
THAT THERE NEVER WAS ANY

THAT THERE NEVER WAS ANY

KNOW BUT I THINK THAT A LOT     
OF LAWYERS WOULD PROBABLY GET   

00:48:54.256 --> 00:48:57.157
KNOW BUT I THINK THAT A LOT     
OF LAWYERS WOULD PROBABLY GET   
INVOLVED TO SAY WHAT THE

01:22:08.115 --> 01:22:09.214
ACTUAL CONFLICT BUT IT&apos;S ALSO   
THE PERCEPTION THEREOF.

THE PERCEPTION THEREOF.         
SO IT GETS VERY TRICKY AND IT   
DOES LIKE AS A MAJORITY COMPEL

GOING TO FIVE IS ACTUALLY       
HELPFUL GIVEN THAT WE CAN&apos;T     

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:58.790
