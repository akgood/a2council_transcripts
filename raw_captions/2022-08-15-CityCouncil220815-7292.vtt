00:44:18.839 --> 00:44:19.705
DISFIGURING DISEASES AND MAYBE  
THEY&amp;apos;RE FLOURISHING LESS WELL   
THAN ADJACENT TREES SO THEY MAY 

00:44:19.707 --> 00:44:22.874
THEY&amp;apos;RE FLOURISHING LESS WELL   
THAN ADJACENT TREES SO THEY MAY 
NOT BE AS LARGE BUT THEY ARE    

00:44:22.876 --> 00:44:23.275
THAN ADJACENT TREES SO THEY MAY 
NOT BE AS LARGE BUT THEY ARE    
NOT DYING.

ENGAGEMENT ALL THOSE STEPS IT   
TAKES YEARS ALL THE PROJECTS    

01:04:42.828 --> 01:04:43.627
ENGAGEMENT ALL THOSE STEPS IT   
TAKES YEARS ALL THE PROJECTS

REBUILD WAITING THAT TIME       
BEFORE WE ADDRESS A NEW SAFETY  
CONCERN BECOMES PROBLEMATIC.    

01:04:56.008 --> 01:04:57.240
BEFORE WE ADDRESS A NEW SAFETY

AND SO THE IDEA OF QUICK BUILD  

01:04:57.242 --> 01:04:59.109
CONCERN BECOMES PROBLEMATIC.    
AND SO THE IDEA OF QUICK BUILD  
IS TO GO OUT USED MATERIALS

AND SO THE IDEA OF QUICK BUILD  
IS TO GO OUT USED MATERIALS

THROUGH WHICH I BELIEVE WAS A   

01:06:49.188 --> 01:06:51.621
PROJECT WAS GOING TO COME       
THROUGH WHICH I BELIEVE WAS A   
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PROJECT OR   

01:06:51.623 --> 01:06:55.392
THROUGH WHICH I BELIEVE WAS A   
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PROJECT OR

TRANSIT CAR DEPENDENCY BECAUSE  
IT FORCES DEVELOPMENT TO BE FAR 
APART.                          

01:39:13.463 --> 01:39:14.196
IT FORCES DEVELOPMENT TO BE FAR 
APART.                          
IT MAKES SMALLER DEVELOPMENTS   

01:39:14.198 --> 01:39:17.199

WHY?                            

01:39:25.309 --> 01:39:28.643
BUILDING SIX SIX BEDROOM UNITS.

FIVE PARKIS FOR EACH FOR EACH   
FOR EACH UNIT.                  
AND SO THIS DEVELOPER HAS TO    

01:39:34.651 --> 01:39:39.087

IT WOULD REQUIRE A SPECIAL      
EXCEPTION USE AND SO THAT WOULD 

02:08:52.941 --> 02:08:53.607

EXCEPTION USE AND SO THAT WOULD 
GO BEFORE THE PLANNING

GO BEFORE THE PLANNING

TO OUR VISION FOR 20 MINUTES    
NEIGHBORHOODS, THIS ORDINANCE   
AFFIRMS THAT IT&amp;apos;S BETTER TO USE 

02:30:49.490 --> 02:30:50.255
NEIGHBORHOODS, THIS ORDINANCE   
AFFIRMS THAT IT&amp;apos;S BETTER TO USE 
SPACE TO HOUSE PEOPLE THAN

EXPENSE FROM THE COST           
OF HOUSING PEOPLE.              

02:30:57.197 --> 02:30:57.863
EXPENSE FROM THE COST           
OF HOUSING PEOPLE.              
SO MANDATORY PARKING WINDOWS    

02:30:57.865 --> 02:31:00.599

SO MANDATORY PARKING WINDOWS    
ADD UNNECESSARY EXPENSE.        

02:31:00.601 --> 02:31:01.701
SO MANDATORY PARKING WINDOWS    
ADD UNNECESSARY EXPENSE.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF THAT IS PRETTY EASY   

02:31:01.703 --> 02:31:04.136
ADD UNNECESSARY EXPENSE.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF THAT IS PRETTY EASY   
AND UNCONTROVERSIAL.            

02:31:04.138 --> 02:31:05.337
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF THAT IS PRETTY EASY   
AND UNCONTROVERSIAL.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WELL    

02:31:05.339 --> 02:31:08.641
AND UNCONTROVERSIAL.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WELL    
LET&amp;apos;S TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND DO 

02:31:08.643 --> 02:31:09.408
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WELL    
LET&amp;apos;S TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND DO 
PARKING DO A PARKING MAXIMUM    

02:31:09.410 --> 02:31:12.945
LET&amp;apos;S TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND DO 
PARKING DO A PARKING MAXIMUM    
AND IN FACT THIS ORDINANCE DOES 

02:31:12.947 --> 02:31:16.615
PARKING DO A PARKING MAXIMUM    
AND IN FACT THIS ORDINANCE DOES 
GO ANOTHER STEP AND SET A       

02:31:16.617 --> 02:31:20.386
AND IN FACT THIS ORDINANCE DOES 
GO ANOTHER STEP AND SET A       
PARKING MAXIMUM FOR TAXI ONE IN 

02:31:20.388 --> 02:31:20.819
GO ANOTHER STEP AND SET A       
PARKING MAXIMUM FOR TAXI ONE IN 
TWO WAYS.                       

02:31:20.821 --> 02:31:23.656
PARKING MAXIMUM FOR TAXI ONE IN 
TWO WAYS.                       
THE FIRST WAY IS IT SETS A CAP  

02:31:23.658 --> 02:31:24.523
TWO WAYS.                       
THE FIRST WAY IS IT SETS A CAP  
AT THREE PARKING SPACES FOR     

02:31:24.525 --> 02:31:28.994
THE FIRST WAY IS IT SETS A CAP  
AT THREE PARKING SPACES FOR     
1000 SQUARE FEET OF FOUR FLOOR  

02:31:28.996 --> 02:31:31.897
AT THREE PARKING SPACES FOR     
1000 SQUARE FEET OF FOUR FLOOR  
AREA BUT AND THAT&amp;apos;S GOOD STAFF  

02:31:31.899 --> 02:31:35.968
1000 SQUARE FEET OF FOUR FLOOR  
AREA BUT AND THAT&amp;apos;S GOOD STAFF  
DECIDED THAT THESE ARE MIXED    

02:31:35.970 --> 02:31:36.235
AREA BUT AND THAT&amp;apos;S GOOD STAFF  
DECIDED THAT THESE ARE MIXED    
USE.                            

02:31:36.237 --> 02:31:37.102
DECIDED THAT THESE ARE MIXED    
USE.                            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IDEALLY THESE ARE MIXED USE  

02:31:37.104 --> 02:31:39.738
USE.                            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IDEALLY THESE ARE MIXED USE  
DEVELOPMENTS AND SET THE NUMBER 

02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:40.473
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IDEALLY THESE ARE MIXED USE  
DEVELOPMENTS AND SET THE NUMBER 
AT SOMETHING THAT COULD FLEX    

02:31:40.475 --> 02:31:43.876
DEVELOPMENTS AND SET THE NUMBER 
AT SOMETHING THAT COULD FLEX    
THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE 

02:31:43.878 --> 02:31:44.610
AT SOMETHING THAT COULD FLEX    
THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
THAN YOU WOULD NEED FOR A       

02:31:44.612 --> 02:31:45.277
THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
THAN YOU WOULD NEED FOR A       
STRICTLY RESIDENTIAL PLACE.     

02:31:45.279 --> 02:31:47.946
THAN YOU WOULD NEED FOR A       
STRICTLY RESIDENTIAL PLACE.     
BUT LESS THAN YOU WOULD NEED    

02:31:47.948 --> 02:31:48.747
STRICTLY RESIDENTIAL PLACE.     
BUT LESS THAN YOU WOULD NEED    
FOR A STRICT OFFICE BUILDING.   

02:31:48.749 --> 02:31:50.949
BUT LESS THAN YOU WOULD NEED    
FOR A STRICT OFFICE BUILDING.   
SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD       

02:31:50.951 --> 02:31:51.416
FOR A STRICT OFFICE BUILDING.   
SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD       
APPROACH FOR NOW.               

02:31:51.418 --> 02:31:52.051
SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD       
APPROACH FOR NOW.               
WE&amp;apos;LL SEE HOW IT WORKS.         

02:31:52.053 --> 02:31:54.786
APPROACH FOR NOW.               
WE&amp;apos;LL SEE HOW IT WORKS.         
BUT AN IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW  

02:31:54.788 --> 02:31:55.521
WE&amp;apos;LL SEE HOW IT WORKS.         
BUT AN IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW  
IS THAT THIS ORDINANCE ALSO     

02:31:55.523 --> 02:31:58.857
BUT AN IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW  
IS THAT THIS ORDINANCE ALSO

PARKING AND ONE THING I DO      

02:40:35.776 --> 02:40:36.608

WORRY ABOUT A LITTLE BIT IS     

02:40:36.610 --> 02:40:39.878

WORRY ABOUT A LITTLE BIT IS     
WHETHER FINANCING WILL WILL

WORRY ABOUT A LITTLE BIT IS     
WHETHER FINANCING WILL WILL

02:40:43.417 --> 02:40:46.851
SORT OF KEEP PACE WITH US       
CHANGE OR IF DEVELOPERS WILL    
STILL FIND THAT THAT THEY NEED  

02:40:46.853 --> 02:40:47.585
CHANGE OR IF DEVELOPERS WILL    
STILL FIND THAT THAT THEY NEED  
TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT        

02:40:47.587 --> 02:40:50.721
STILL FIND THAT THAT THEY NEED  
TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT        
OF PARKING IN ORDER TO GET THE

MODEST ON THIS SITE THAT HE HAS 
A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING
