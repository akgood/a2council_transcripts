YOU KNOW, IT PROVIDES, YOU      
KNOW, ADDITIONAL PROTECTION AND 
SO WE'RE PLANNING THAT USED TO

KNOW, ADDITIONAL PROTECTION AND 
SO WE'RE PLANNING THAT USED TO  
BE LIKE A CLOSED OFF AREA ON.   

00:32:59.453 --> 00:33:00.519
SO WE'RE PLANNING THAT USED TO  
BE LIKE A CLOSED OFF AREA ON.   
SO YOU CAN SEE ON THIS PICTURE  

00:33:00.521 --> 00:33:01.119
BE LIKE A CLOSED OFF AREA ON.   
SO YOU CAN SEE ON THIS PICTURE  
THERE'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A      

00:33:01.121 --> 00:33:03.321
SO YOU CAN SEE ON THIS PICTURE  
THERE'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A      
CORNER FENCE THAT'S STILL       

00:33:03.323 --> 00:33:03.922
THERE'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A      
CORNER FENCE THAT'S STILL       
THAT'S THERE BECAUSE THIS       

00:33:03.924 --> 00:33:04.656
CORNER FENCE THAT'S STILL       
THAT'S THERE BECAUSE THIS       
PICTURE WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE    

00:33:04.658 --> 00:33:08.059
THAT'S THERE BECAUSE THIS       
PICTURE WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE    
FENCE GOT TAKEN DOWN FOR THE    

00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:08.793
PICTURE WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE    
FENCE GOT TAKEN DOWN FOR THE    
RETAINING WALL AND SO WE'RE     

00:33:08.795 --> 00:33:10.728
FENCE GOT TAKEN DOWN FOR THE    
RETAINING WALL AND SO WE'RE     
SEEKING TO RESTORE THAT.        

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.863
RETAINING WALL AND SO WE'RE     
SEEKING TO RESTORE THAT.        
WELL, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THAT   

00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:14.966
SEEKING TO RESTORE THAT.        
WELL, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THAT   
WE FULLY THE OTHER THING THAT   

00:33:14.968 --> 00:33:15.667
WELL, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THAT   
WE FULLY THE OTHER THING THAT   
WE LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS 

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:16.468
WE FULLY THE OTHER THING THAT   
WE LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS 
OF THE RETAINING WALL IS THAT   

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.837
WE LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS 
OF THE RETAINING WALL IS THAT   
THERE'S AN EASEMENT THERE FOR A 

00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:19.371
OF THE RETAINING WALL IS THAT   
THERE'S AN EASEMENT THERE FOR A 
SEWER EASEMENT.                 

00:33:19.373 --> 00:33:22.673
THERE'S AN EASEMENT THERE FOR A 
SEWER EASEMENT.                 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO  

00:33:22.675 --> 00:33:23.741
SEWER EASEMENT.                 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO  
BUT WE'RE GOING TO ADD IN WE    

00:33:23.743 --> 00:33:24.442
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO  
BUT WE'RE GOING TO ADD IN WE    
WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANN ARBOR     

00:33:24.444 --> 00:33:27.311
BUT WE'RE GOING TO ADD IN WE    
WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANN ARBOR     
VIDES WHEREVER WE CAN JUST TO   

00:33:27.313 --> 00:33:30.882
WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANN ARBOR     
VIDES WHEREVER WE CAN JUST TO   
KIND OF SO THE CONDITION OF THE 

00:33:30.884 --> 00:33:31.483
VIDES WHEREVER WE CAN JUST TO   
KIND OF SO THE CONDITION OF THE 
PROPERTY HAS CHANGED.           

00:33:31.485 --> 00:33:35.186
KIND OF SO THE CONDITION OF THE 
PROPERTY HAS CHANGED.           
YEAH, DUE TO STORM SIZE STORM   

00:33:35.188 --> 00:33:39.124
PROPERTY HAS CHANGED.           
YEAH, DUE TO STORM SIZE STORM   
AS THE STORM DAMAGE DONE IT WAS 

00:33:39.126 --> 00:33:39.858
YEAH, DUE TO STORM SIZE STORM   
AS THE STORM DAMAGE DONE IT WAS 
TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT WAS LIKE 

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.361
AS THE STORM DAMAGE DONE IT WAS 
TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT WAS LIKE 
A PRETTY YEAH WE THERE ARE A    

00:33:43.363 --> 00:33:45.831
TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT WAS LIKE 
A PRETTY YEAH WE THERE ARE A    
BUNCH OF REALLY BIG TREES THAT  

00:33:45.833 --> 00:33:46.698
A PRETTY YEAH WE THERE ARE A    
BUNCH OF REALLY BIG TREES THAT  
FELL DOWN IN THE NATURE AREA.   

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.168
BUNCH OF REALLY BIG TREES THAT  
FELL DOWN IN THE NATURE AREA.   
THEY ACTUALLY ARE THE ONES THAT 

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:50.902
FELL DOWN IN THE NATURE AREA.   
THEY ACTUALLY ARE THE ONES THAT 
KNOCKED DOWN OUR TREES AS WELL  

00:33:50.904 --> 00:33:57.275
THEY ACTUALLY ARE THE ONES THAT 
KNOCKED DOWN OUR TREES AS WELL  
AS OUR FENCE                    

00:34:10.756 --> 00:34:12.924
             AT THAT TIME AS    
WELL SO THAT WHEN THE SOIL      
EROSION OCCURRED THAT WAS       

00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:13.658
WELL SO THAT WHEN THE SOIL      
EROSION OCCURRED THAT WAS       
ALREADY SOMETHING WE DIDN'T     

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.392
EROSION OCCURRED THAT WAS       
ALREADY SOMETHING WE DIDN'T     
REALIZE THAT IT WAS SLOWLY      

00:34:14.394 --> 00:34:14.893
ALREADY SOMETHING WE DIDN'T     
REALIZE THAT IT WAS SLOWLY      
HAVING AN ISSUE.                

00:34:14.895 --> 00:34:15.626
REALIZE THAT IT WAS SLOWLY      
HAVING AN ISSUE.                
BUT THEN ONCE WE MOVED IN WE    

00:34:15.628 --> 00:34:16.228
HAVING AN ISSUE.                
BUT THEN ONCE WE MOVED IN WE    
WERE NOTICING THE GAP           

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.895
BUT THEN ONCE WE MOVED IN WE    
WERE NOTICING THE GAP           
UNDERNEATH THE FENCE GETTING    

00:34:16.897 --> 00:34:17.562
WERE NOTICING THE GAP           
UNDERNEATH THE FENCE GETTING    
GETTING LARGER SO WE HAD TO     

00:34:17.564 --> 00:34:18.363
UNDERNEATH THE FENCE GETTING    
GETTING LARGER SO WE HAD TO     
BOARD THAT UP AND THEN WE LOST  

00:34:18.365 --> 00:34:19.164
GETTING LARGER SO WE HAD TO     
BOARD THAT UP AND THEN WE LOST  
A TON OF TREES ON THE ON THE    

00:34:19.166 --> 00:34:19.897
BOARD THAT UP AND THEN WE LOST  
A TON OF TREES ON THE ON THE    
SOUTH SIDE OF THE FENCE AND SO  

00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:20.565
A TON OF TREES ON THE ON THE    
SOUTH SIDE OF THE FENCE AND SO  
THAT KIND OF JUST THERE WAS NO  

00:34:20.567 --> 00:34:24.736
SOUTH SIDE OF THE FENCE AND SO  
THAT KIND OF JUST THERE WAS NO  
LIKE GREENERY AND STUFF LIKE    

00:34:24.738 --> 00:34:25.737
THAT KIND OF JUST THERE WAS NO  
LIKE GREENERY AND STUFF LIKE    
THAT ALL GOT DAMAGED AND SO THE 

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:28.039
LIKE GREENERY AND STUFF LIKE    
THAT ALL GOT DAMAGED AND SO THE 
JUST GOT WORSE.                 

00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:29.007
THAT ALL GOT DAMAGED AND SO THE 
JUST GOT WORSE.                 
TO SUMMARIZE, YOU GUYS MOVED    

00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:29.274
JUST GOT WORSE.                 
TO SUMMARIZE, YOU GUYS MOVED    
IN.                             

00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:31.877
TO SUMMARIZE, YOU GUYS MOVED    
IN.                             
THE FENCE WAS ALREADY THERE.    

00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:32.877
IN.                             
THE FENCE WAS ALREADY THERE.    
YOU HAD A BIG STORM COME        

00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:33.578
THE FENCE WAS ALREADY THERE.    
YOU HAD A BIG STORM COME        
THROUGH, KNOCKED DOWN PART      

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.045
YOU HAD A BIG STORM COME        
THROUGH, KNOCKED DOWN PART      
OF THE FENCE.                   

00:34:34.047 --> 00:34:36.380
THROUGH, KNOCKED DOWN PART      
OF THE FENCE.                   
YOU HAD SOME SOIL EROSION AS    

00:34:36.382 --> 00:34:36.715
OF THE FENCE.                   
YOU HAD SOME SOIL EROSION AS    
WELL.                           

00:34:36.717 --> 00:34:39.850
YOU HAD SOME SOIL EROSION AS    
WELL.                           
AND SO YOU GUYS BUILT RETAINING 

00:34:39.852 --> 00:34:40.852
WELL.                           
AND SO YOU GUYS BUILT RETAINING 
WALL AND WHEN YOU BOUGHT THAT   

00:34:40.854 --> 00:34:41.519
AND SO YOU GUYS BUILT RETAINING 
WALL AND WHEN YOU BOUGHT THAT   
RETAINING WALL AND TOOK DOWN    

00:34:41.521 --> 00:34:44.022
WALL AND WHEN YOU BOUGHT THAT   
RETAINING WALL AND TOOK DOWN    
PART OF THE OTHER PART OF THE   

00:34:44.024 --> 00:34:45.022
RETAINING WALL AND TOOK DOWN    
PART OF THE OTHER PART OF THE   
FENCE THAT WAS HIT BY TREES OR  

00:34:45.024 --> 00:34:47.625
PART OF THE OTHER PART OF THE   
FENCE THAT WAS HIT BY TREES OR  
WHATEVER AND THEN YOU JUST WANT 

00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:48.560
FENCE THAT WAS HIT BY TREES OR  
WHATEVER AND THEN YOU JUST WANT 
TO PUT IT BACK SO THAT YOU HAVE 

00:34:48.562 --> 00:34:49.293
WHATEVER AND THEN YOU JUST WANT 
TO PUT IT BACK SO THAT YOU HAVE 
A FULLY ENCLOSED BACKYARD THAT  

00:34:49.295 --> 00:34:51.929
TO PUT IT BACK SO THAT YOU HAVE 
A FULLY ENCLOSED BACKYARD THAT  
MATCHES.                        

00:34:51.931 --> 00:34:52.164
A FULLY ENCLOSED BACKYARD THAT  
MATCHES.                        
RIGHT.                          

00:34:52.166 --> 00:34:53.231
MATCHES.                        
RIGHT.                          
SO IT WAS ALL FENCED BEFORE THE 

00:34:53.233 --> 00:34:55.132
RIGHT.                          
SO IT WAS ALL FENCED BEFORE THE 
STORM FULLY LIKE FULLY AROUND.  

00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:56.167
SO IT WAS ALL FENCED BEFORE THE 
STORM FULLY LIKE FULLY AROUND.  
THERE WAS NO BREAKS, NO GAP     

00:34:56.169 --> 00:34:56.834
STORM FULLY LIKE FULLY AROUND.  
THERE WAS NO BREAKS, NO GAP     
DOWN THERE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT   

00:34:56.836 --> 00:34:59.304
THERE WAS NO BREAKS, NO GAP     
DOWN THERE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT   
IT WAS LIKE FULLY JUST SECLUDED 

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:03.040
DOWN THERE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT   
IT WAS LIKE FULLY JUST SECLUDED 
BACK THERE WITH NO ACCESS.      

00:35:03.042 --> 00:35:04.008
IT WAS LIKE FULLY JUST SECLUDED 
BACK THERE WITH NO ACCESS.      
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE    

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.642
BACK THERE WITH NO ACCESS.      
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE    
RULES ARE NOW THAT WE'VE        

00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:05.243
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE    
RULES ARE NOW THAT WE'VE        
LEARNED THAT THERE'S AN         

00:35:05.245 --> 00:35:06.945
RULES ARE NOW THAT WE'VE        
LEARNED THAT THERE'S AN         
EASEMENT THERE.                 

00:35:06.947 --> 00:35:08.212
LEARNED THAT THERE'S AN         
EASEMENT THERE.                 
BUT THAT'S JUST NEXT STEPS FOR  

00:35:08.214 --> 00:35:13.918
EASEMENT THERE.                 
BUT THAT'S JUST NEXT STEPS FOR  
US TO FIGURE OUT OK, SO         

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.088
BUT THAT'S JUST NEXT STEPS FOR  
US TO FIGURE OUT OK, SO         
FOLLOWING THE STORM DAMAGE SO   

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:17.956
US TO FIGURE OUT OK, SO         
FOLLOWING THE STORM DAMAGE SO   
THE FENCE PREEXISTED, THERE ARE 

00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:21.193
FOLLOWING THE STORM DAMAGE SO   
THE FENCE PREEXISTED, THERE ARE 
SIX FOOT FENCE ALL AROUND WHEN  

00:35:21.195 --> 00:35:22.060
THE FENCE PREEXISTED, THERE ARE 
SIX FOOT FENCE ALL AROUND WHEN  
YOU MOVED IN AND FOLLOWING THE  

00:35:22.062 --> 00:35:25.763
SIX FOOT FENCE ALL AROUND WHEN  
YOU MOVED IN AND FOLLOWING THE  
STORM DAMAGE YOU NOT YOU HAD TO 

00:35:25.765 --> 00:35:26.530
YOU MOVED IN AND FOLLOWING THE  
STORM DAMAGE YOU NOT YOU HAD TO 
PUT THAT RETAINING WALL BECAUSE 

00:35:26.532 --> 00:35:30.001
STORM DAMAGE YOU NOT YOU HAD TO 
PUT THAT RETAINING WALL BECAUSE 
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT IN THERE.   

00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:33.337
PUT THAT RETAINING WALL BECAUSE 
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT IN THERE.   
I MEAN ANY EXTRA GROUND         

00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:36.974
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT IN THERE.

I MEAN ANY EXTRA GROUND         
COVER YOU COULD PUT TO MINIMIZE 
EROSION.

SAW THAT BARRIER AREA BEHIND    
THE RETAINING WALL OUR PLAN IS  
TO LIKE THAT WAS FULL           

00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:10.108
THE RETAINING WALL OUR PLAN IS  
TO LIKE THAT WAS FULL           
OF INVASIVE LIKE HONEYSUCKLE    

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:10.642
TO LIKE THAT WAS FULL           
OF INVASIVE LIKE HONEYSUCKLE    
AND BUCKTHORN.                  

00:36:10.644 --> 00:36:14.312
OF INVASIVE LIKE HONEYSUCKLE    
AND BUCKTHORN.
