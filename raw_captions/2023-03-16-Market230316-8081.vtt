NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WERE      
POTENTIALLY THINGS THAT WE      

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:57.356
NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WERE      
POTENTIALLY THINGS THAT WE

POTENTIALLY THINGS THAT WE      
COULD ADDRESS THE THINGS THAT

00:26:58.092 --> 00:27:00.859
COULD ADDRESS THE THINGS THAT

THE U.S. I KIND OF DUG THROUGH  

00:27:00.861 --> 00:27:04.329
MIGHT BE WORTH INCLUDING FOR    
THE U.S. I KIND OF DUG THROUGH  
MORE OF THOSE AND COMPARED WITH 

00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:05.197
THE U.S. I KIND OF DUG THROUGH  
MORE OF THOSE AND COMPARED WITH 
SOME OTHER BODIES I ALSO AT     

00:27:05.199 --> 00:27:05.998
MORE OF THOSE AND COMPARED WITH 
SOME OTHER BODIES I ALSO AT     
LEAST AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING   

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.800
SOME OTHER BODIES I ALSO AT     
LEAST AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING   
ABOUT THIS TO WHAT MIGHT WORK   

00:27:08.802 --> 00:27:12.103
LEAST AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING   
ABOUT THIS TO WHAT MIGHT WORK   
WITH SOME IDEAS WITH THIS BUT   

00:27:12.105 --> 00:27:13.105
ABOUT THIS TO WHAT MIGHT WORK   
WITH SOME IDEAS WITH THIS BUT   
IT KIND OF BROKE IT DOWN TO     

00:27:13.107 --> 00:27:13.638
WITH SOME IDEAS WITH THIS BUT   
IT KIND OF BROKE IT DOWN TO     
THESE FOUR THINGS.              

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.841
IT KIND OF BROKE IT DOWN TO     
THESE FOUR THINGS.              
SO THE FIRST ONE IS TERM        

00:27:15.843 --> 00:27:16.241
THESE FOUR THINGS.              
SO THE FIRST ONE IS TERM        
LIMITS.                         

00:27:16.243 --> 00:27:19.745
SO THE FIRST ONE IS TERM        
LIMITS.                         
AND SO THIS THIS ACTUALLY WOULD 

00:27:19.747 --> 00:27:20.612
LIMITS.                         
AND SO THIS THIS ACTUALLY WOULD 
MOSTLY APPLY TO ME BUT IT WOULD 

00:27:20.614 --> 00:27:23.749
AND SO THIS THIS ACTUALLY WOULD 
MOSTLY APPLY TO ME BUT IT WOULD 
IN GENERAL THE INTENTION IS TO  

00:27:23.751 --> 00:27:24.749
MOSTLY APPLY TO ME BUT IT WOULD 
IN GENERAL THE INTENTION IS TO  
GET NEW BLOOD AND KEEP THINGS   

00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:27.352
IN GENERAL THE INTENTION IS TO  
GET NEW BLOOD AND KEEP THINGS   
ROTATING.                       

00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:28.286
GET NEW BLOOD AND KEEP THINGS   
ROTATING.                       
YOU DON&apos;T WANT TO HAVE JUST     

00:27:28.288 --> 00:27:29.087
ROTATING.                       
YOU DON&apos;T WANT TO HAVE JUST     
ETERNALLY INCUMBENTS AND THERE  

00:27:29.089 --> 00:27:31.790
YOU DON&apos;T WANT TO HAVE JUST     
ETERNALLY INCUMBENTS AND THERE  
HAVE BEEN BODIES WHICH HAVE     

00:27:31.792 --> 00:27:32.524
ETERNALLY INCUMBENTS AND THERE  
HAVE BEEN BODIES WHICH HAVE     
BEEN PLAGUED BY THAT AND SO     

00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:35.527
HAVE BEEN BODIES WHICH HAVE     
BEEN PLAGUED BY THAT AND SO     
THAT&apos;S THE INTENTION OF HAVING  

00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:39.398
BEEN PLAGUED BY THAT AND SO     
THAT&apos;S THE INTENTION OF HAVING  
TERM LIMITS FOR THIS PAC HAS    

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.198
THAT&apos;S THE INTENTION OF HAVING  
TERM LIMITS FOR THIS PAC HAS    
THE PARKS COMMITTEE HAS SIMILAR 

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.568
TERM LIMITS FOR THIS PAC HAS    
THE PARKS COMMITTEE HAS SIMILAR 
LANGUAGE IN THIS AND THE IDEA   

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:44.635
THE PARKS COMMITTEE HAS SIMILAR 
LANGUAGE IN THIS AND THE IDEA   
WITH THIS IS THAT NO PERSON CAN 

00:27:44.637 --> 00:27:47.872
LANGUAGE IN THIS AND THE IDEA   
WITH THIS IS THAT NO PERSON CAN 
SERVE MORE THAN THEIR CASE I    

00:27:47.874 --> 00:27:51.109
WITH THIS IS THAT NO PERSON CAN 
SERVE MORE THAN THEIR CASE I    
GUESS SIX YEARS IN TOTAL BUT    

00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:52.110
SERVE MORE THAN THEIR CASE I    
GUESS SIX YEARS IN TOTAL BUT    
THEN THEY CAN ESSENTIALLY GO    

00:27:52.112 --> 00:27:54.979
GUESS SIX YEARS IN TOTAL BUT    
THEN THEY CAN ESSENTIALLY GO    
FALLOW FOR THREE YEARS AND COME 

00:27:54.981 --> 00:27:55.880
THEN THEY CAN ESSENTIALLY GO    
FALLOW FOR THREE YEARS AND COME 
BACK TO LIFE IF THAT&apos;S SO       

00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:58.916
FALLOW FOR THREE YEARS AND COME 
BACK TO LIFE IF THAT&apos;S SO       
DEEMED SO THAT DOES KIND        

00:27:58.918 --> 00:27:59.651
BACK TO LIFE IF THAT&apos;S SO       
DEEMED SO THAT DOES KIND        
OF SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT 

00:27:59.653 --> 00:28:00.418
DEEMED SO THAT DOES KIND        
OF SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT 
WAY AND THAT SEEMS REASONABLE   

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.086
OF SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT 
WAY AND THAT SEEMS REASONABLE   
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT    

00:28:01.088 --> 00:28:01.886
WAY AND THAT SEEMS REASONABLE   
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT    
WAY AND THAT SEEMS REASONABLE   

00:28:01.888 --> 00:28:04.422
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT    
WAY AND THAT SEEMS REASONABLE   
MAYBE A CLEANER WAY TO DO IT    

00:28:04.424 --> 00:28:05.223
WAY AND THAT SEEMS REASONABLE   
MAYBE A CLEANER WAY TO DO IT    
WOULD BE TO KIND OF DO HOW WE   

00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:07.092
MAYBE A CLEANER WAY TO DO IT    
WOULD BE TO KIND OF DO HOW WE   
DO SOMETIMES WE CAN HAVE        

00:28:07.094 --> 00:28:07.759
WOULD BE TO KIND OF DO HOW WE   
DO SOMETIMES WE CAN HAVE        
PARTIAL APPOINTMENTS WHERE      

00:28:07.761 --> 00:28:08.493
DO SOMETIMES WE CAN HAVE        
PARTIAL APPOINTMENTS WHERE      
PEOPLE ARE APPOINTED MID-TERM   

00:28:08.495 --> 00:28:12.029
PARTIAL APPOINTMENTS WHERE

SO SAY SOMETHING WHERE EACH     
PERSON SORT OF MAXIMUM OF TWO   

00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:16.334
SO SAY SOMETHING WHERE EACH     
PERSON SORT OF MAXIMUM OF TWO   
FULL TERMS AND THEN THEY WOULD  

00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:18.970
PERSON SORT OF MAXIMUM OF TWO   
FULL TERMS AND THEN THEY WOULD  
HAVE TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE TERM  

00:28:18.972 --> 00:28:22.073
FULL TERMS AND THEN THEY WOULD  
HAVE TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE TERM  
OFF BEFORE BEING REAPPOINTED    

00:28:22.075 --> 00:28:23.241
HAVE TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE TERM  
OFF BEFORE BEING REAPPOINTED    
SEEMS A FAIRLY MINOR CHANGE BUT 

00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:26.945
OFF BEFORE BEING REAPPOINTED    
SEEMS A FAIRLY MINOR CHANGE BUT 
I THINK WOULD BE I THINK IT I

SOMETIMES IF ONE PERSON IS NOT  
PRESENT THEN OFTENTIMES WE&apos;RE   

00:32:24.017 --> 00:32:30.022
SOMETIMES IF ONE PERSON IS NOT  
PRESENT THEN OFTENTIMES WE&apos;RE   
MISSING A HUGE                  

00:32:43.703 --> 00:32:45.937
               FRAGMENT OF THAT 
THAT VOICE.                     
SO IT WOULD BE IT COULD BE AN   

00:32:45.939 --> 00:32:46.805
THAT VOICE.                     
SO IT WOULD BE IT COULD BE AN   
ADVANTAGE TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE   

00:32:46.807 --> 00:32:47.338
SO IT WOULD BE IT COULD BE AN   
ADVANTAGE TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE   
ON ALSO EVEN FOR THIS           

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.073
ADVANTAGE TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE   
ON ALSO EVEN FOR THIS           
DISCUSSION OF TRYING TO WORK ON 

00:32:48.075 --> 00:32:48.873
ON ALSO EVEN FOR THIS           
DISCUSSION OF TRYING TO WORK ON 
SUBCOMMITTEES AND THINGS LIKE   

00:32:48.875 --> 00:32:49.207
DISCUSSION OF TRYING TO WORK ON 
SUBCOMMITTEES AND THINGS LIKE   
THAT.                           

00:32:49.209 --> 00:32:49.841
SUBCOMMITTEES AND THINGS LIKE   
THAT.                           
WE JUST HAVE FEWER MINDS TO     

00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:50.575
THAT.                           
WE JUST HAVE FEWER MINDS TO     
WORK TOGETHER ON THINGS SO      

00:32:50.577 --> 00:32:51.309
WE JUST HAVE FEWER MINDS TO     
WORK TOGETHER ON THINGS SO      
THERE COULD BE AN ADVANTAGE FOR 

00:32:51.311 --> 00:32:51.642
WORK TOGETHER ON THINGS SO      
THERE COULD BE AN ADVANTAGE FOR 
THAT.                           

00:32:51.644 --> 00:32:52.377
THERE COULD BE AN ADVANTAGE FOR 
THAT.                           
SO ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO     

00:32:52.379 --> 00:32:52.977
THAT.                           
SO ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO     
HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL VENDOR      

00:32:52.979 --> 00:32:53.811
SO ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO     
HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL VENDOR

00:32:55.215 --> 00:32:55.814
INCLUDING DALYS, ANNUALIZE      
ARTISAN&apos;S OR FOOD FOLKS AND     
THAT MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING    

00:32:55.816 --> 00:32:56.614
ARTISAN&apos;S OR FOOD FOLKS AND     
THAT MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING    
WAY TO GET MORE VOICE WITHIN    

00:32:56.616 --> 00:32:57.281

WAY TO GET MORE VOICE WITHIN    
AND MORE AGENCY OF SOME         

00:32:57.283 --> 00:32:57.882
WAY TO GET MORE VOICE WITHIN

THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO DO 

00:33:01.921 --> 00:33:02.220

THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO DO 
IT.

THEN VOTE TO INCLUDE THAT.      
I MEAN AGAIN IT WILL HAVE TO GO 

00:34:44.357 --> 00:34:45.990
THEN VOTE TO INCLUDE THAT.      
I MEAN AGAIN IT WILL HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH ANOTHER ROUND OF LEGAL  

00:34:45.992 --> 00:34:46.557
I MEAN AGAIN IT WILL HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH ANOTHER ROUND OF LEGAL  
VALIDATION BECAUSE IT&apos;S         

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:47.291
THROUGH ANOTHER ROUND OF LEGAL  
VALIDATION BECAUSE IT&apos;S         
CERTAINLY SUPPORTED BY LAWS.    

00:34:47.293 --> 00:34:50.694
VALIDATION BECAUSE IT&apos;S         
CERTAINLY SUPPORTED BY LAWS.    
BUT AT LEAST MAKING SURE THAT   

00:34:50.696 --> 00:34:51.363
CERTAINLY SUPPORTED BY LAWS.    
BUT AT LEAST MAKING SURE THAT   
WE&apos;RE OK WITH THAT AND          

00:34:51.365 --> 00:34:54.265
BUT AT LEAST MAKING SURE THAT   
WE&apos;RE OK WITH THAT AND          
PERCEIVING THAT FORWARD.        

00:34:54.267 --> 00:34:55.232
WE&apos;RE OK WITH THAT AND          
PERCEIVING THAT FORWARD.        
BUT THAT&apos;S HOW I ENVISION THAT  

00:34:55.234 --> 00:34:58.136
PERCEIVING THAT FORWARD.        
BUT THAT&apos;S HOW I ENVISION THAT  
PROCESS WITH MOVE FORWARD.      

00:34:58.138 --> 00:34:58.602
BUT THAT&apos;S HOW I ENVISION THAT  
PROCESS WITH MOVE FORWARD.      
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        

00:34:58.604 --> 00:34:59.404
PROCESS WITH MOVE FORWARD.      
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS ONE   

00:34:59.406 --> 00:35:02.106
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS ONE   
IT ALSO NEEDS TO GO TO COUNCIL  

00:35:02.108 --> 00:35:02.873
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS ONE   
IT ALSO NEEDS TO GO TO COUNCIL  
BECAUSE IT IS OUR BYLAWS.       

00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:04.108
IT ALSO NEEDS TO GO TO COUNCIL  
BECAUSE IT IS OUR BYLAWS.       
SO I HAVE TO GO TO LEGAL FIRST  

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.076
BECAUSE IT IS OUR BYLAWS.       
SO I HAVE TO GO TO LEGAL FIRST  
THEN.                           

00:35:05.078 --> 00:35:06.411
SO I HAVE TO GO TO LEGAL FIRST  
THEN.

00:35:06.413 --> 00:35:09.180
THEN.                           
BUT YES, I THINK TO ME IT MAKES 
A LOT MORE A LOT OF SENSE TO

BUT YES, I THINK TO ME IT MAKES 
A LOT MORE A LOT OF SENSE TO    
ESPECIALLY BRING MORE VENDORS   

00:35:09.916 --> 00:35:10.181
A LOT MORE A LOT OF SENSE TO    
ESPECIALLY BRING MORE VENDORS

00:35:10.183 --> 00:35:12.784
ESPECIALLY BRING MORE VENDORS   
ON.                             
I WILL SPOUTED A LITTLE STRANGE 

00:35:12.786 --> 00:35:13.718
ON.                             
I WILL SPOUTED A LITTLE STRANGE 
THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT 

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.386
I WILL SPOUTED A LITTLE STRANGE 
THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN       

00:35:14.388 --> 00:35:17.388
THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN       
ACTUALLY OUTVOTE PEOPLE THAT    

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.624
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN       
ACTUALLY OUTVOTE PEOPLE THAT    
ARE INVOLVED IN THE MARKET      

00:35:20.626 --> 00:35:21.025
ACTUALLY OUTVOTE PEOPLE THAT    
ARE INVOLVED IN THE MARKET      
DIRECTLY.                       

00:35:21.027 --> 00:35:22.060
ARE INVOLVED IN THE MARKET      
DIRECTLY.                       
I REALLY LIKE THE LANGUAGE      

00:35:22.062 --> 00:35:24.929
DIRECTLY.                       
I REALLY LIKE THE LANGUAGE      
OF HAVING MAYBE AN AT LARGE     

00:35:24.931 --> 00:35:25.597
I REALLY LIKE THE LANGUAGE      
OF HAVING MAYBE AN AT LARGE     
VENDOR REPRESENTATIVE SO THEN   

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:29.300
OF HAVING MAYBE AN AT LARGE     
VENDOR REPRESENTATIVE SO THEN   
THAT WAY THEY LITERALLY ARE THE 

00:35:29.302 --> 00:35:29.934
VENDOR REPRESENTATIVE SO THEN   
THAT WAY THEY LITERALLY ARE THE 
ENCOMPASSING OF ANYONE WITHOUT  

00:35:29.936 --> 00:35:32.136
THAT WAY THEY LITERALLY ARE THE 
ENCOMPASSING OF ANYONE WITHOUT  
HAVING TO THE BORDER.           

00:35:32.138 --> 00:35:33.104
ENCOMPASSING OF ANYONE WITHOUT  
HAVING TO THE BORDER.           
I KNOW THAT&apos;S FOR EXAMPLE HOW   

00:35:33.106 --> 00:35:33.738
HAVING TO THE BORDER.           
I KNOW THAT&apos;S FOR EXAMPLE HOW   
THE GREEN BELT DOES THEIRS.     

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.307
I KNOW THAT&apos;S FOR EXAMPLE HOW   
THE GREEN BELT DOES THEIRS.     
THEY KIND HAVE THAT FLOATING    

00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:37.241
THE GREEN BELT DOES THEIRS.     
THEY KIND HAVE THAT FLOATING    
WILD CARD SEAT THAT IS MORE     

00:35:37.243 --> 00:35:40.478
THEY KIND HAVE THAT FLOATING    
WILD CARD SEAT THAT IS MORE     
GENERALLY LARGE OF OURS COULD   

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.915

GENERALLY LARGE OF OURS COULD   
BE VENDOR AT LARGE AND THEN

AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THAT      

00:40:16.823 --> 00:40:17.622
AN ADDITIONAL STALL AVAILABLE   
AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THAT      
PEOPLE CAN GET A FOURTH STALL.  

00:40:17.624 --> 00:40:20.725
AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THAT      
PEOPLE CAN GET A FOURTH STALL.  
SO THERE ARE ALREADY THINGS IN  

00:40:20.727 --> 00:40:21.592
PEOPLE CAN GET A FOURTH STALL.  
SO THERE ARE ALREADY THINGS IN  
THE RULES THAT PROVIDE FOR THIS 

00:40:21.594 --> 00:40:24.595
SO THERE ARE ALREADY THINGS IN  
THE RULES THAT PROVIDE FOR THIS 
BUT THIS WOULD BE HAVING A      

00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:31.002
THE RULES THAT PROVIDE FOR THIS 
BUT THIS WOULD BE HAVING A      
FOURTH ASSIGNED STALL TO        

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.640
                         I      
DON&apos;T KNOW IF PEOPLE WANT TO    
JUST QUICKLY READ IT OVER OR WE 

00:40:35.642 --> 00:40:36.507
DON&apos;T KNOW IF PEOPLE WANT TO    
JUST QUICKLY READ IT OVER OR WE 
SHOULD JUST DOVE INTO THE       

00:40:36.509 --> 00:40:39.376
JUST QUICKLY READ IT OVER OR WE 
SHOULD JUST DOVE INTO THE       
CONVERSATION.                   

00:40:39.378 --> 00:40:43.347
SHOULD JUST DOVE INTO THE       
CONVERSATION.                   
SO JUST TO CLARIFY TOO THAT I&apos;M 

00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:44.048
CONVERSATION.                   
SO JUST TO CLARIFY TOO THAT I&apos;M 
WONDERING ABOUT THE HISTORY     

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:44.515
SO JUST TO CLARIFY TOO THAT I&apos;M 
WONDERING ABOUT THE HISTORY     
OF THIS TOO.                    

00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:46.384
WONDERING ABOUT THE HISTORY     
OF THIS TOO.                    
SO I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME  

00:40:46.386 --> 00:40:47.184
OF THIS TOO.                    
SO I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME  
PEOPLE WHO WERE GRANDFATHERED   

00:40:47.186 --> 00:40:51.054
SO I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME  
PEOPLE WHO WERE GRANDFATHERED   
IN FOR YEARS FOR THREE OR FOUR  

00:40:51.056 --> 00:40:51.455
PEOPLE WHO WERE GRANDFATHERED   
IN FOR YEARS FOR THREE OR FOUR  
VENDORS.

DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU KIND       

00:40:54.126 --> 00:40:54.825
VENDORS.                        
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU KIND       
OF DESCRIBE THAT BACKGROUND A   

00:40:54.827 --> 00:40:55.226
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU KIND       
OF DESCRIBE THAT BACKGROUND A   
LITTLE BIT?                     

00:40:55.228 --> 00:40:56.493
OF DESCRIBE THAT BACKGROUND A   
LITTLE BIT?                     
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE 

00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:58.896
LITTLE BIT?                     
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE 
WAS A WHILE IN THE EARLY        

00:40:58.898 --> 00:41:02.299
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE 
WAS A WHILE IN THE EARLY        
EIGHTIES WHERE THE MARKET WAS   

00:41:02.301 --> 00:41:03.101
WAS A WHILE IN THE EARLY        
EIGHTIES WHERE THE MARKET WAS   
GETTING STIFF OPPOSITION FROM   

00:41:03.103 --> 00:41:06.570
EIGHTIES WHERE THE MARKET WAS   
GETTING STIFF OPPOSITION FROM   
THE RECENT AT THE TIME          

00:41:06.572 --> 00:41:10.007
GETTING STIFF OPPOSITION FROM   
THE RECENT AT THE TIME          
EXPANSION OF GROCERY OFFERINGS  

00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:10.941
THE RECENT AT THE TIME          
EXPANSION OF GROCERY OFFERINGS  
AND THEY WERE HAVING A HARD     

00:41:10.943 --> 00:41:11.676
EXPANSION OF GROCERY OFFERINGS  
AND THEY WERE HAVING A HARD     
TIME JUST FILLING THE MARKET AT

TIME JUST FILLING THE MARKET AT 
ALL.

00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:14.879
ALL.                            
SO THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
PEOPLE TO GET A FOURTH STALL AT 

00:41:14.881 --> 00:41:17.882
SO THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
PEOPLE TO GET A FOURTH STALL AT

SOME POINT NOT SURE EXACT       
TIMELINE UNFORTUNATELY ON THIS  
ONE IS THAT WAS RESCINDED SO    

00:41:25.258 --> 00:41:26.190
TIMELINE UNFORTUNATELY ON THIS  
ONE IS THAT WAS RESCINDED SO    
THAT PEOPLE THEN WERE ABLE TO

THE DONOGHUE&apos;S HAVE DONE THAT

00:43:07.326 --> 00:43:09.427
                  IT BECOMES A  
LOT MORE DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS    
THAT ARE LOCKED IN NEXT TO      

00:43:09.429 --> 00:43:10.228
LOT MORE DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS    
THAT ARE LOCKED IN NEXT TO      
OTHER PEOPLE THAT ALSO HAVE     

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.561
THAT ARE LOCKED IN NEXT TO      
OTHER PEOPLE THAT ALSO HAVE     
THREE STALLS.                   

00:43:10.563 --> 00:43:11.361
OTHER PEOPLE THAT ALSO HAVE     
THREE STALLS.                   
SO LOGISTIC WE THIS IS VERY,    

00:43:11.363 --> 00:43:12.096
THREE STALLS.                   
SO LOGISTIC WE THIS IS VERY,    
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUR OUR   

00:43:12.098 --> 00:43:12.763
SO LOGISTIC WE THIS IS VERY,    
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUR OUR   
HEAD AROUND MAINLY BECAUSE      

00:43:12.765 --> 00:43:13.364
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUR OUR   
HEAD AROUND MAINLY BECAUSE      
OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE, ON ONE     

00:43:13.366 --> 00:43:14.232
HEAD AROUND MAINLY BECAUSE      
OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE, ON ONE     
SIDE OF THE MAIN AISLE WE HAVE  

00:43:14.234 --> 00:43:14.966
OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE, ON ONE     
SIDE OF THE MAIN AISLE WE HAVE  
SOMETHING LIKE THREE TO SIX.    

00:43:14.968 --> 00:43:15.667
SIDE OF THE MAIN AISLE WE HAVE  
SOMETHING LIKE THREE TO SIX.    
WELL IF YOU TAKE IT IN SEGMENTS 

00:43:15.669 --> 00:43:17.301
SOMETHING LIKE THREE TO SIX.    
WELL IF YOU TAKE IT IN SEGMENTS 
OR BY THEMSELVES WE HAVE THREE  

00:43:17.303 --> 00:43:18.535
WELL IF YOU TAKE IT IN SEGMENTS 
OR BY THEMSELVES WE HAVE THREE  
VENDORS IN A ROW ON ONE SIDE    

00:43:18.537 --> 00:43:19.303
OR BY THEMSELVES WE HAVE THREE  
VENDORS IN A ROW ON ONE SIDE    
THAT&apos;S FORESTALLS THREE STALLS, 

00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:21.105
VENDORS IN A ROW ON ONE SIDE    
THAT&apos;S FORESTALLS THREE STALLS, 
THREE STALLS AND THEN NEXT TO   

00:43:21.107 --> 00:43:21.839
THAT&apos;S FORESTALLS THREE STALLS, 
THREE STALLS AND THEN NEXT TO   
THEM IT&apos;S ANOTHER THREE THREE   

00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:25.976
THREE STALLS AND THEN NEXT TO   
THEM IT&apos;S ANOTHER THREE THREE   
THREE THREE AND THAT&apos;S THE SAME 

00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:26.778
THEM IT&apos;S ANOTHER THREE THREE   
THREE THREE AND THAT&apos;S THE SAME 
ACROSS THE WAY THE MAIN AISLE.  

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.646
THREE THREE AND THAT&apos;S THE SAME 
ACROSS THE WAY THE MAIN AISLE.  
SO THIS IS I&apos;M NOT SURE         

00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:30.348
ACROSS THE WAY THE MAIN AISLE.  
SO THIS IS I&apos;M NOT SURE         
LOGISTICALLY HOW THIS WOULD     

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:30.548
SO THIS IS I&apos;M NOT SURE         
LOGISTICALLY HOW THIS WOULD     
WORK.                           

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.883
LOGISTICALLY HOW THIS WOULD     
WORK.                           
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING.            

00:43:32.885 --> 00:43:36.220
WORK.                           
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING.            
THE OTHER IS WE&apos;RE JUST NOT     

00:43:36.222 --> 00:43:37.255
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING.            
THE OTHER IS WE&apos;RE JUST NOT     
SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE EVEN WANT  

00:43:37.257 --> 00:43:40.557
THE OTHER IS WE&apos;RE JUST NOT     
SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE EVEN WANT  
TO FORESTALL.                   

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:41.492
SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE EVEN WANT  
TO FORESTALL.                   
BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT  

00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:44.195
TO FORESTALL.                   
BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT  
WE KNOW WOULD WANT THEM BUT     

00:43:44.197 --> 00:43:45.229
BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT  
WE KNOW WOULD WANT THEM BUT     
DIRECTLY NEXT TO THEM IS EITHER 

00:43:45.231 --> 00:43:47.564
WE KNOW WOULD WANT THEM BUT     
DIRECTLY NEXT TO THEM IS EITHER 
A ONE PERSON STALL ALREADY      

00:43:47.566 --> 00:43:48.332
DIRECTLY NEXT TO THEM IS EITHER 
A ONE PERSON STALL ALREADY      
PREASSIGNED OR A WALKWAY.       

00:43:48.334 --> 00:43:49.233
A ONE PERSON STALL ALREADY      
PREASSIGNED OR A WALKWAY.       
SO WE DON&apos;T REALLY HAVE WIGGLE  

00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:52.403
PREASSIGNED OR A WALKWAY.       
SO WE DON&apos;T REALLY HAVE WIGGLE  
ROOM SO THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE A 

00:43:52.405 --> 00:43:53.170
SO WE DON&apos;T REALLY HAVE WIGGLE  
ROOM SO THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE A 
PART OF A BROADER CONVERSATION  

00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.572
ROOM SO THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE A 
PART OF A BROADER CONVERSATION  
OF YOU.                         

00:43:55.574 --> 00:43:56.641
PART OF A BROADER CONVERSATION  
OF YOU.                         
DO WE HAVE TO REASSIGN STALLS   

00:43:56.643 --> 00:43:59.410
OF YOU.                         
DO WE HAVE TO REASSIGN STALLS   
TO PEOPLE WHICH I THINK COULD   

00:43:59.412 --> 00:44:02.713
DO WE HAVE TO REASSIGN STALLS   
TO PEOPLE WHICH I THINK COULD   
CAUSE A LOT OF CONFLICT?

SIDE OF THAT TOO IS THAT&apos;S FIVE 
WE&apos;RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET

SIDE OF THAT TOO IS THAT&apos;S FIVE 
WE&apos;RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET     
SEVEN MORE BY JULY 1ST BASED ON 

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.693
WE&apos;RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET

SAY ALL TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE      
WANTED THOSE PEOPLE COULDN&apos;T    
GET THAT FORSTALL ALL AT ONCE.  

00:46:03.036 --> 00:46:03.367
WANTED THOSE PEOPLE COULDN&apos;T    
GET THAT FORSTALL ALL AT ONCE.  
RIGHT.                          

00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:04.502
GET THAT FORSTALL ALL AT ONCE.  
RIGHT.                          
WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO DO A      

00:46:04.504 --> 00:46:07.171
RIGHT.                          
WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO DO A      
PHASED IN TIER SYSTEM TO EVEN   

00:46:07.173 --> 00:46:10.073
WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO DO A      
PHASED IN TIER SYSTEM TO EVEN   
IF WE HAD THE SPACE NEXT TO     

00:46:10.075 --> 00:46:10.508
PHASED IN TIER SYSTEM TO EVEN   
IF WE HAD THE SPACE NEXT TO

IF WE HAD THE SPACE NEXT TO     
EACH OTHER.                     
SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS TO     

00:46:11.343 --> 00:46:13.977
EACH OTHER.                     
SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS TO     
THINK ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT      

00:46:13.979 --> 00:46:20.283
SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS TO     
THINK ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT      
OF THIS BUT I&apos;D BE INTERESTED   

00:46:20.285 --> 00:46:24.554
THINK ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT      
OF THIS BUT I&apos;D BE INTERESTED   
GO AHEAD I GUESS THEN TWO SO I  

00:46:24.556 --> 00:46:27.524
OF THIS BUT I&apos;D BE INTERESTED   
GO AHEAD I GUESS THEN TWO SO I  
UNDERSTAND TO THE THOUGHT IS IF 

00:46:27.526 --> 00:46:28.325
GO AHEAD I GUESS THEN TWO SO I  
UNDERSTAND TO THE THOUGHT IS IF 
YOU WERE SOMEONE WITH THREE     

00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:29.126
UNDERSTAND TO THE THOUGHT IS IF 
YOU WERE SOMEONE WITH THREE     
STALLS WHO WANTED TO FORESTALL  

00:46:29.128 --> 00:46:31.361
YOU WERE SOMEONE WITH THREE     
STALLS WHO WANTED TO FORESTALL  
A PERMANENT FORESTALL THEY MOST 

00:46:31.363 --> 00:46:32.096
STALLS WHO WANTED TO FORESTALL  
A PERMANENT FORESTALL THEY MOST 
LIKELY WANT THEM ALL TO BE      

00:46:32.098 --> 00:46:32.496
A PERMANENT FORESTALL THEY MOST 
LIKELY WANT THEM ALL TO BE      
CONTIGUOUS.                     

00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:35.265
LIKELY WANT THEM ALL TO BE      
CONTIGUOUS.                     
THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHERE THE         

00:46:35.267 --> 00:46:35.900
CONTIGUOUS.                     
THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHERE THE         
SHIPPING AND EVERYTHING WOULD   

00:46:35.902 --> 00:46:36.634
THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHERE THE         
SHIPPING AND EVERYTHING WOULD   
HAPPEN IF THEY HAD HIGH         

00:46:36.636 --> 00:46:39.202
SHIPPING AND EVERYTHING WOULD   
HAPPEN IF THEY HAD HIGH         
SENIORITY THEY COULD OTHER      

00:46:39.204 --> 00:46:39.903
HAPPEN IF THEY HAD HIGH         
SENIORITY THEY COULD OTHER      
FOLKS AND THEN THAT WOULD BE    

00:46:39.905 --> 00:46:42.773
SENIORITY THEY COULD OTHER      
FOLKS AND THEN THAT WOULD BE    
KIND OF A CHAIN REACTION WHAT   

00:46:42.775 --> 00:46:43.140
FOLKS AND THEN THAT WOULD BE    
KIND OF A CHAIN REACTION WHAT   
YOU&apos;RE SAYING.                  

00:46:43.142 --> 00:46:43.673
KIND OF A CHAIN REACTION WHAT   
YOU&apos;RE SAYING.                  
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.                     

00:46:43.675 --> 00:46:44.641
YOU&apos;RE SAYING.                  
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.                     
BUT THE WAY THAT IT CURRENTLY   

00:46:44.643 --> 00:46:46.944
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.                     
BUT THE WAY THAT IT CURRENTLY   
WORKS TECHNICALLY IS THAT YOU   

00:46:46.946 --> 00:46:47.745
BUT THE WAY THAT IT CURRENTLY   
WORKS TECHNICALLY IS THAT YOU   
COULD GET A FOURTH STALL THAT&apos;S 

00:46:47.747 --> 00:46:50.481
WORKS TECHNICALLY IS THAT YOU   
COULD GET A FOURTH STALL THAT&apos;S 
NOT NEXT TO THE OTHER STALLS    

00:46:50.483 --> 00:46:51.515
COULD GET A FOURTH STALL THAT&apos;S 
NOT NEXT TO THE OTHER STALLS    
AND EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD KIND   

00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:52.215
NOT NEXT TO THE OTHER STALLS    
AND EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD KIND   
OF HAVE TO WAIT TILL IT OPENS   

00:46:52.217 --> 00:46:53.684
AND EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD KIND   
OF HAVE TO WAIT TILL IT OPENS   
UP AND THEN YOU&apos;D BE ABLE TO    

00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:54.685
OF HAVE TO WAIT TILL IT OPENS   
UP AND THEN YOU&apos;D BE ABLE TO    
SHIFT INTO IT WHICH IS ALREADY  

00:46:54.687 --> 00:46:55.353
UP AND THEN YOU&apos;D BE ABLE TO    
SHIFT INTO IT WHICH IS ALREADY  
HOW IT WORKS FOR IF YOU&apos;RE      

00:46:55.355 --> 00:46:58.088
SHIFT INTO IT WHICH IS ALREADY  
HOW IT WORKS FOR IF YOU&apos;RE      
GETTING YOUR SECOND STALL, IF   

00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:58.722
HOW IT WORKS FOR IF YOU&apos;RE      
GETTING YOUR SECOND STALL, IF   
YOU&apos;RE GETTING YOUR THIRD       

00:46:58.724 --> 00:46:59.056
GETTING YOUR SECOND STALL, IF   
YOU&apos;RE GETTING YOUR THIRD       
STALL.                          

00:46:59.058 --> 00:46:59.924
YOU&apos;RE GETTING YOUR THIRD       
STALL.                          
I JUST FEEL LIKE IF WE HAD A    

00:46:59.926 --> 00:47:02.526
STALL.                          
I JUST FEEL LIKE IF WE HAD A    
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO DO 

00:47:02.528 --> 00:47:03.293
I JUST FEEL LIKE IF WE HAD A    
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO DO 
IT AT ONCE IT WOULD BE          

00:47:03.295 --> 00:47:05.929
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO DO 
IT AT ONCE IT WOULD BE          
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO PULL    

00:47:05.931 --> 00:47:09.499
IT AT ONCE IT WOULD BE          
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO PULL    
OFF SO THAT&apos;S EXACTLY HOW IT    

00:47:09.501 --> 00:47:09.900
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO PULL    
OFF SO THAT&apos;S EXACTLY HOW IT    
WOULD WORK.                     

00:47:09.902 --> 00:47:13.170
OFF SO THAT&apos;S EXACTLY HOW IT    
WOULD WORK.                     
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS

ANYONE REALLY WOULD GET         
FORESTALLS DIRECTLY IN A ROW

AND THEN THAT WOULD GIVE US     
BEFORE WE EVEN TALK ABOUT IT, I 

00:47:55.281 --> 00:47:55.946

BEFORE WE EVEN TALK ABOUT IT, I 
THINK THAT WOULD GIVE US        

00:47:55.948 --> 00:47:58.982

THINK THAT WOULD GIVE US        
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT THAT&apos;S A   

00:47:58.984 --> 00:47:59.316
THINK THAT WOULD GIVE US        
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT THAT&apos;S A   
GOOD IDEA.                      

00:47:59.318 --> 00:48:03.220
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT THAT&apos;S A   
GOOD IDEA.                      
&gt;&gt; IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU   

00:48:03.222 --> 00:48:06.189

I&apos;M NOT EVEN CERTAIN I DON&apos;T    

00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:07.391
WOULD EVEN WANT TO OR NOT?      
I&apos;M NOT EVEN CERTAIN I DON&apos;T

00:48:07.393 --> 00:48:09.626
I&apos;M NOT EVEN CERTAIN I DON&apos;T    
KNOW.                           
I&apos;D HAVE TO I&apos;D HAVE TO THINK   

00:48:09.628 --> 00:48:13.630
KNOW.                           
I&apos;D HAVE TO I&apos;D HAVE TO THINK   
ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE THING IS   

00:48:13.632 --> 00:48:14.765
I&apos;D HAVE TO I&apos;D HAVE TO THINK   
ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE THING IS   
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS IF      

00:48:14.767 --> 00:48:17.300
ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE THING IS   
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS IF      
THERE&apos;S ONLY THOSE FEW TIMES I  

00:48:17.302 --> 00:48:18.202
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS IF      
THERE&apos;S ONLY THOSE FEW TIMES I  
NEED IT BUT WOULD BE GUARANTEED 

00:48:18.204 --> 00:48:21.605
THERE&apos;S ONLY THOSE FEW TIMES I  
NEED IT BUT WOULD BE GUARANTEED 
IN MY FORSTALL WHEN I DID NEED  

00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:24.808
NEED IT BUT WOULD BE GUARANTEED 
IN MY FORSTALL WHEN I DID NEED  
IT INSTEAD OF MAYBE THE MAYBE   

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:25.776
IN MY FORSTALL WHEN I DID NEED  
IT INSTEAD OF MAYBE THE MAYBE   
OF FOUR WEEKS THAT I NEED IT    

00:48:25.778 --> 00:48:29.380
IT INSTEAD OF MAYBE THE MAYBE   
OF FOUR WEEKS THAT I NEED IT    
FOR OUR ALSO THE FOUR WEEKS AT  

00:48:29.382 --> 00:48:32.816
OF FOUR WEEKS THAT I NEED IT    
FOR OUR ALSO THE FOUR WEEKS AT  
THE MARKETS THE BUSIEST RIGHT.  

00:48:32.818 --> 00:48:33.984
FOR OUR ALSO THE FOUR WEEKS AT  
THE MARKETS THE BUSIEST RIGHT.  
&gt;&gt; SO IT MIGHT MIGHT ACTUALLY   

00:48:33.986 --> 00:48:36.654
THE MARKETS THE BUSIEST RIGHT.  
&gt;&gt; SO IT MIGHT MIGHT ACTUALLY   
GENERATE I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW TO    

00:48:36.656 --> 00:48:39.990
&gt;&gt; SO IT MIGHT MIGHT ACTUALLY   
GENERATE I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW TO    
FIGURE IT OUT EXACTLY BUT I     

00:48:39.992 --> 00:48:40.557
GENERATE I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW TO    
FIGURE IT OUT EXACTLY BUT I     
MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP           

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:41.291
FIGURE IT OUT EXACTLY BUT I     
MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP           
GENERATING MORE MONEY FOR THE   

00:48:41.293 --> 00:48:43.861
MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP           
GENERATING MORE MONEY FOR THE   
MARKET BECAUSE ANY TIME YOU     

00:48:43.863 --> 00:48:44.795
GENERATING MORE MONEY FOR THE   
MARKET BECAUSE ANY TIME YOU     
HAVE AN ANNUAL VENDOR WHO HOLDS 

00:48:44.797 --> 00:48:46.997
MARKET BECAUSE ANY TIME YOU     
HAVE AN ANNUAL VENDOR WHO HOLDS 
A STALL AND DOESN&apos;T COME IN AND 

00:48:46.999 --> 00:48:47.831
HAVE AN ANNUAL VENDOR WHO HOLDS 
A STALL AND DOESN&apos;T COME IN AND 
THEN THEY&apos;RE ABLE TO RENT IT    

00:48:47.833 --> 00:48:51.469
A STALL AND DOESN&apos;T COME IN AND 
THEN THEY&apos;RE ABLE TO RENT IT    
OUT ON A DAILY LEVEL, IT BRINGS 

00:48:51.471 --> 00:48:52.136
THEN THEY&apos;RE ABLE TO RENT IT    
OUT ON A DAILY LEVEL, IT BRINGS 
OBVIOUSLY IT BRINGS MORE MONEY  

00:48:52.138 --> 00:48:52.403
OUT ON A DAILY LEVEL, IT BRINGS 
OBVIOUSLY IT BRINGS MORE MONEY  
IN.                             

00:48:52.405 --> 00:48:55.339
OBVIOUSLY IT BRINGS MORE MONEY  
IN.                             
SO THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO  

00:48:55.341 --> 00:48:55.806
IN.                             
SO THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO  
CONSIDER TOO.                   

00:48:55.808 --> 00:48:59.576
SO THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO  
CONSIDER TOO.                   
I DON&apos;T THINK IF I HAD TO GUESS 

00:48:59.578 --> 00:49:00.343
CONSIDER TOO.                   
I DON&apos;T THINK IF I HAD TO GUESS 
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT     

00:49:00.345 --> 00:49:00.978
I DON&apos;T THINK IF I HAD TO GUESS 
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT     
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO     

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.246
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT     
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO     
WANT TO FORESTALL BUT IT WOULD  

00:49:03.248 --> 00:49:03.947
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO     
WANT TO FORESTALL BUT IT WOULD  
BE NICE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

WANT TO FORESTALL BUT IT WOULD  
BE NICE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR 
THE PEOPLE WHO DID WELL THANKS

BE NICE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR 
THE PEOPLE WHO DID WELL THANKS  
FOR SHARING.                    

00:49:09.555 --> 00:49:12.890

00:49:13.792 --> 00:49:15.993
THAT&apos;S HELPFUL.                 
DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY       
THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS?            

00:49:15.995 --> 00:49:20.297
DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY       
THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS?            
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I&apos;M A       

00:49:20.299 --> 00:49:20.965
THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS?            
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I&apos;M A       
LITTLE TORN BECAUSE IN SOME     

00:49:20.967 --> 00:49:24.501
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I&apos;M A       
LITTLE TORN BECAUSE IN SOME     
WAYS THAT I I, I LIKE HAVING    

00:49:24.503 --> 00:49:25.236
LITTLE TORN BECAUSE IN SOME     
WAYS THAT I I, I LIKE HAVING    
DIVERSITY AT THE MARKET AND     

00:49:25.238 --> 00:49:28.305
WAYS THAT I I, I LIKE HAVING    
DIVERSITY AT THE MARKET AND     
HAVING MORE VENDORS WOULD BE    

00:49:28.307 --> 00:49:29.306
DIVERSITY AT THE MARKET AND     
HAVING MORE VENDORS WOULD BE    
THAT IN MY IDEAL WORLD HAVING   

00:49:29.308 --> 00:49:32.510
HAVING MORE VENDORS WOULD BE    
THAT IN MY IDEAL WORLD HAVING   
EVERYTHING RUNNING REALLY WELL. 

00:49:32.512 --> 00:49:33.443

EVERYTHING RUNNING REALLY WELL. 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW     

00:49:33.445 --> 00:49:35.846
EVERYTHING RUNNING REALLY WELL. 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW     
THERE ARE A LOT OF VENDORS THAT 

00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:36.647
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW     
THERE ARE A LOT OF VENDORS THAT

00:49:36.649 --> 00:49:37.281
THERE ARE A LOT OF VENDORS THAT 
HAVE BIG OPERATIONS WHICH HAVE

A REALLY BIG DIVERSITY          
OF PRODUCTS AND SO THAT THAT&apos;S  

00:49:40.553 --> 00:49:43.854

OF PRODUCTS AND SO THAT THAT&apos;S  
IT&apos;S KIND OF THE SAME THING AND 

00:49:43.856 --> 00:49:44.555

IT&apos;S KIND OF THE SAME THING AND 
THEY&apos;RE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY

IT&apos;S KIND OF THE SAME THING AND 
THEY&apos;RE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY  
DO THEIR THING REALLY WELL AND  

00:49:45.358 --> 00:49:48.592
THEY&apos;RE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY  
DO THEIR THING REALLY WELL AND  
THAT THEY PUT OUT THE PART.     

00:49:48.594 --> 00:49:49.593
DO THEIR THING REALLY WELL AND  
THAT THEY PUT OUT THE PART.     
&gt;&gt; SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF NICE TO    

00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:51.595
THAT THEY PUT OUT THE PART.     
&gt;&gt; SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF NICE TO    
HAVE THEM DO KIND OF WE JUST    

00:49:51.597 --> 00:49:52.196
&gt;&gt; SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF NICE TO    
HAVE THEM DO KIND OF WE JUST    
NEED A BIGGER MARKET.           

00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:55.332

INCUMBENTS AND THEN ESSENTIALLY 
PULLS UP THE LADDER SO THAT A   
SMALL SMALL OPERATOR REALLY

NO SPACE FOR THEM, THEN THAT    
WOULD BE A LOSS FOR THE OF THE  
FUTURE BECAUSE MOST FARMERS DO  

00:52:43.535 --> 00:52:44.301
WOULD BE A LOSS FOR THE OF THE  
FUTURE BECAUSE MOST FARMERS DO  
DON&apos;T START OUT AT A GIANT

SCALE.                          

00:52:44.636 --> 00:52:47.704
DON&apos;T START OUT AT A GIANT      
SCALE.                          
THEY START SMALL SCALE AND THEN 

00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:48.571
SCALE.                          
THEY START SMALL SCALE AND THEN 
THEY GROW AND SO THAT WE        

00:52:48.573 --> 00:52:51.741
THEY START SMALL SCALE AND THEN 
THEY GROW AND SO THAT WE        
SOMEHOW JUST SAID WELL YOU&apos;RE

DIFFICULT SITUATIONS WHERE      
THEY&apos;RE LITERALLY BETWEEN A     
WALKWAY AND ANOTHER PERMANENT

HAVING PEOPLE PAY YEARLY FOR A  
FOR SALE OR IS IT EASIER FOR    

00:53:56.542 --> 00:53:59.543
HAVING PEOPLE PAY YEARLY FOR A  
FOR SALE OR IS IT EASIER FOR    
PEOPLE JUST TO PAY YOU PER DAY  

00:53:59.545 --> 00:54:00.077
FOR SALE OR IS IT EASIER FOR    
PEOPLE JUST TO PAY YOU PER DAY

RIGHT ANSWER IS, BUT I THINK IT 
IS GOOD THAT WE DO HAVE AT      

00:54:05.283 --> 00:54:06.850
RIGHT ANSWER IS, BUT I THINK IT 
IS GOOD THAT WE DO HAVE AT      
LEAST SOME OPTION TO BEGIN WITH 

00:54:06.852 --> 00:54:10.453
IS GOOD THAT WE DO HAVE AT      
LEAST SOME OPTION TO BEGIN WITH 
AND IT&apos;S NOT EITHER PERMANENT   

00:54:10.455 --> 00:54:10.988
LEAST SOME OPTION TO BEGIN WITH 
AND IT&apos;S NOT EITHER PERMANENT   
FORESTALL OR NOTHING.           

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:14.391
AND IT&apos;S NOT EITHER PERMANENT   
FORESTALL OR NOTHING.           
WE ARE ALREADY SORT OF IN

ORCHARD STACK BACK AT HOME AND  
THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S REALLY A          
MULTIGENERATIONAL INVESTMENT    

01:08:31.516 --> 01:08:35.050
THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S REALLY A          
MULTIGENERATIONAL INVESTMENT    
ESPECIALLY SOMEONE THAT&apos;S IN 15

IT&apos;S TOUGH TO PLANT TREES IF    

01:08:39.391 --> 01:08:40.189
YEARS AWAY FROM RETIREMENT.     
IT&apos;S TOUGH TO PLANT TREES IF    
YOU DON&apos;T HAVE SOMEONE COMING

I THOUGHT WHY IT&apos;S A GOOD THING 
FOR THE MARKET TO BE SURE TO

MAKING A LIVING THAT WILL       
SUPPLY THE MARKET INTO THE      
AFTERNOON.                      

01:10:45.516 --> 01:10:46.482
SUPPLY THE MARKET INTO THE      
AFTERNOON.                      
AND I&apos;VE ALSO NOTICED THAT      

01:10:46.484 --> 01:10:48.684
AFTERNOON.

TREND AS WE&apos;VE KIND OF WENT     

01:10:48.686 --> 01:10:49.585
AND I&apos;VE ALSO NOTICED THAT

SO I THINK THAT&apos;S A BAD THING   
FOR THE MARKET AND MAYBE A      

01:10:57.995 --> 01:10:59.962
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S A BAD THING   
FOR THE MARKET AND MAYBE A      
REASON TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING   

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.466
FOR THE MARKET AND MAYBE A      
REASON TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING   
THE TYPE OF VENDORS THAT CAN    

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:04.267
REASON TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING   
THE TYPE OF VENDORS THAT CAN    
BRING A SERIOUS SUPPLY TO THE   

01:11:04.269 --> 01:11:07.904
THE TYPE OF VENDORS THAT CAN    
BRING A SERIOUS SUPPLY TO THE   
MARKET SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME   

01:11:07.906 --> 01:11:08.638
BRING A SERIOUS SUPPLY TO THE   
MARKET SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME   
OF MY OBSERVATIONS AND I        

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.473

OF MY OBSERVATIONS AND I

BUT FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE    

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:15.578
UNDERSTAND THERE&apos;S TWO SIDES    
BUT FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE    
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA AND 

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:18.714
BUT FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE    
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA AND 
I I AGREE WITH JEFF THAT I JUST

I I AGREE WITH JEFF THAT I JUST 
GIVE IT TIME AND I THINK THAT   

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.718
I I AGREE WITH JEFF THAT I JUST 
GIVE IT TIME AND I THINK THAT   
IT WILL WORK ITS WAY.           

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.619
GIVE IT TIME AND I THINK THAT   
IT WILL WORK ITS WAY.           
FOLKS WILL HAVE TO WAIT THEIR   

01:11:23.621 --> 01:11:24.220
IT WILL WORK ITS WAY.           
FOLKS WILL HAVE TO WAIT THEIR   
TURN TO GET THE CONVENIENCE     

01:11:24.222 --> 01:11:26.956

01:11:34.132 --> 01:11:34.864
OF YEARS.                       
BUT IT WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK  
THAT FOLKS CAN WORK TOWARDS     

01:11:34.866 --> 01:11:37.600
BUT IT WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK  
THAT FOLKS CAN WORK TOWARDS     
THAT.                           

01:11:37.602 --> 01:11:39.701
THAT FOLKS CAN WORK TOWARDS     
THAT.
