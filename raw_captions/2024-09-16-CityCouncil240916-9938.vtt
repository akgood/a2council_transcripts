PLACEMAKING AND WAYFINDING AND  

00:09:31.534 --> 00:09:32.333
ENHANCE PUBLIC SPACES           
PLACEMAKING AND WAYFINDING AND  
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT 

00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:32.967
PLACEMAKING AND WAYFINDING AND  
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT 
CAN SUPPORT THOSE SEASONAL      

00:09:32.969 --> 00:09:36.003
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT 
CAN SUPPORT THOSE SEASONAL      
STREET CLOSURES AND THE         

00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:38.672
CAN SUPPORT THOSE SEASONAL      
STREET CLOSURES AND THE         
ACTIVATION OF THOSE STREETS.    

00:09:38.674 --> 00:09:39.740
STREET CLOSURES AND THE         
ACTIVATION OF THOSE STREETS.    
>> SO WITH STREET DESIGN WE'RE  

00:09:39.742 --> 00:09:42.777
ACTIVATION OF THOSE STREETS.    
>> SO WITH STREET DESIGN WE'RE  
LOOKING AT FLEXIBLE STREETS.    

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:43.944
>> SO WITH STREET DESIGN WE'RE  
LOOKING AT FLEXIBLE STREETS.    
WE ARE LOOKING AT KERBEROS AND  

00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:47.148
LOOKING AT FLEXIBLE STREETS.    
WE ARE LOOKING AT KERBEROS AND  
SHARED STREETS AND I'LL PULL    

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.982
WE ARE LOOKING AT KERBEROS AND  
SHARED STREETS AND I'LL PULL    
OUT LIBERTY STREET AS A GOOD    

00:09:47.984 --> 00:09:51.219
SHARED STREETS AND I'LL PULL    
OUT LIBERTY STREET AS A GOOD    
EXAMPLE OF A POTENTIAL PROJECT  

00:09:51.221 --> 00:09:55.056
OUT LIBERTY STREET AS A GOOD    
EXAMPLE OF A POTENTIAL PROJECT  
THAT WE SEE KIND OF RISING TO   

00:09:55.058 --> 00:09:55.523
EXAMPLE OF A POTENTIAL PROJECT  
THAT WE SEE KIND OF RISING TO   
THE TOP.                        

00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:56.490
THAT WE SEE KIND OF RISING TO   
THE TOP.                        
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIBERTY 

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:59.127
THE TOP.                        
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIBERTY 
STREET, IT IS REALLY THE MAIN   

00:09:59.129 --> 00:09:59.994
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIBERTY 
STREET, IT IS REALLY THE MAIN   
CONNECTOR FROM THE STATE STREET 

00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:03.264
STREET, IT IS REALLY THE MAIN   
CONNECTOR FROM THE STATE STREET 
NEIGHBORHOOD DOWN TO THE MAIN

CONNECTOR FROM THE STATE STREET 
NEIGHBORHOOD DOWN TO THE MAIN   
STREET NEIGHBORHOOD.            

00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:06.901
NEIGHBORHOOD DOWN TO THE MAIN   
STREET NEIGHBORHOOD.            
THAT STREET HAS NOT BEEN        

00:10:06.903 --> 00:10:07.568
STREET NEIGHBORHOOD.            
THAT STREET HAS NOT BEEN        
TOUCHED IN A LONG TIME.         

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.469
THAT STREET HAS NOT BEEN        
TOUCHED IN A LONG TIME.         
IF YOU ARE WALKING ALONG        

00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:11.305
TOUCHED IN A LONG TIME.         
IF YOU ARE WALKING ALONG        
LIBERTY I WOULD SUGGEST YOU     

00:10:11.307 --> 00:10:14.708
IF YOU ARE WALKING ALONG        
LIBERTY I WOULD SUGGEST YOU     
NOTICE THE VARIOUS WIDTHS       

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.143
LIBERTY I WOULD SUGGEST YOU     
NOTICE THE VARIOUS WIDTHS       
OF THE SIDEWALK.                

00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:16.076
NOTICE THE VARIOUS WIDTHS       
OF THE SIDEWALK.                
IT CAN BE BLOCK TO BLOCK        

00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:16.911
OF THE SIDEWALK.                
IT CAN BE BLOCK TO BLOCK        
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE FROM ONE    

00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:18.580
IT CAN BE BLOCK TO BLOCK        
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE FROM ONE    
SIDE OF THE STREET TO THE NEXT. 

00:10:18.582 --> 00:10:19.780
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE FROM ONE    
SIDE OF THE STREET TO THE NEXT. 
>> THERE ARE ALSO SOME KIND     

00:10:19.782 --> 00:10:23.250
SIDE OF THE STREET TO THE NEXT. 
>> THERE ARE ALSO SOME KIND     
OF FUNKY LANE CONFIGURATIONS ON 

00:10:23.252 --> 00:10:23.952
>> THERE ARE ALSO SOME KIND     
OF FUNKY LANE CONFIGURATIONS ON 
CERTAIN BLOCKS OF LIBERTY       

00:10:23.954 --> 00:10:26.321
OF FUNKY LANE CONFIGURATIONS ON 
CERTAIN BLOCKS OF LIBERTY       
STREET SO WE REALLY BELIEVE     

00:10:26.323 --> 00:10:27.155
CERTAIN BLOCKS OF LIBERTY       
STREET SO WE REALLY BELIEVE     
THAT LIBERTY STREET IS READY    

00:10:27.157 --> 00:10:31.326
STREET SO WE REALLY BELIEVE     
THAT LIBERTY STREET IS READY    
FOR AN INTEREST A MAJOR         

00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:32.126
THAT LIBERTY STREET IS READY    
FOR AN INTEREST A MAJOR         
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT AND THAT 

00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:34.795
FOR AN INTEREST A MAJOR         
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT AND THAT 
COULD BE REALLY TRANSFORMING    

00:10:34.797 --> 00:10:35.462
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT AND THAT 
COULD BE REALLY TRANSFORMING    
FOR OUR DOWNTOWN.               

00:10:35.464 --> 00:10:36.364
COULD BE REALLY TRANSFORMING    
FOR OUR DOWNTOWN.

SESSION IN OCTOBER AND THEN     
FINALLY FOR SEASONAL STREETS    

00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:51.866
SESSION IN OCTOBER AND THEN     
FINALLY FOR SEASONAL STREETS    
ACTIVATION, WE'RE LOOKING AT    

00:12:51.868 --> 00:12:52.566
FINALLY FOR SEASONAL STREETS    
ACTIVATION, WE'RE LOOKING AT    
INVESTMENTS, INFRASTRUCTURE     

00:12:52.568 --> 00:12:55.937
ACTIVATION, WE'RE LOOKING AT    
INVESTMENTS, INFRASTRUCTURE     
INVESTMENTS THE DDA CAN MAKE TO 

00:12:55.939 --> 00:12:56.604
INVESTMENTS, INFRASTRUCTURE     
INVESTMENTS THE DDA CAN MAKE TO 
MAKE THOSE SEASONAL STREET      

00:12:56.606 --> 00:12:59.607
INVESTMENTS THE DDA CAN MAKE TO 
MAKE THOSE SEASONAL STREET      
CLOSURES EASIER FOR             

00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:03.511
MAKE THOSE SEASONAL STREET      
CLOSURES EASIER FOR             
ORGANIZATIONS TO CLOSE TO       

00:13:03.513 --> 00:13:04.112
CLOSURES EASIER FOR             
ORGANIZATIONS TO CLOSE TO       
ACTIVATE MAINLY BARRICADE       

00:13:04.114 --> 00:13:07.614
ORGANIZATIONS TO CLOSE TO       
ACTIVATE MAINLY BARRICADE       
IMPROVEMENTS.                   

00:13:07.616 --> 00:13:08.582
ACTIVATE MAINLY BARRICADE       
IMPROVEMENTS.                   
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT   

00:13:08.584 --> 00:13:11.618
IMPROVEMENTS.                   
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT   
OUR CURRENT BARRICADE SITUATION 

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.553
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT   
OUR CURRENT BARRICADE SITUATION 
IS LESS THAN IDEAL MAIN STREET  

00:13:12.555 --> 00:13:14.923
OUR CURRENT BARRICADE SITUATION 
IS LESS THAN IDEAL MAIN STREET  
AREA ASSOCIATION HAS ACTUALLY   

00:13:14.925 --> 00:13:15.656
IS LESS THAN IDEAL MAIN STREET  
AREA ASSOCIATION HAS ACTUALLY   
DONE A FABULOUS JOB WRAPPING    

00:13:15.658 --> 00:13:18.692
AREA ASSOCIATION HAS ACTUALLY   
DONE A FABULOUS JOB WRAPPING    
THOSE TYPE THREE BARRICADES.    

00:13:18.694 --> 00:13:19.694
DONE A FABULOUS JOB WRAPPING    
THOSE TYPE THREE BARRICADES.    
THEY LOOK A WHOLE LOT BETTER    

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:22.530
THOSE TYPE THREE BARRICADES.    
THEY LOOK A WHOLE LOT BETTER    
BUT WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH    

00:13:22.532 --> 00:13:23.530
THEY LOOK A WHOLE LOT BETTER    
BUT WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH    
THOSE PVC PCBS THAT YOU SEE     

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:26.934
BUT WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH    
THOSE PVC PCBS THAT YOU SEE     
KIND OF STREWN TO SIDE TO SIDE  

00:13:26.936 --> 00:13:27.368
THOSE PVC PCBS THAT YOU SEE     
KIND OF STREWN TO SIDE TO SIDE  
ON THE CLOSURES.                

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.505
KIND OF STREWN TO SIDE TO SIDE  
ON THE CLOSURES.                
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT MANY       

00:13:30.507 --> 00:13:31.072
ON THE CLOSURES.                
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT MANY       
DIFFERENT OPTIONS.              

00:13:31.074 --> 00:13:34.641
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT MANY       
DIFFERENT OPTIONS.              
THERE ARE OPTIONS RELATED TO    

00:13:34.643 --> 00:13:35.443
DIFFERENT OPTIONS.              
THERE ARE OPTIONS RELATED TO    
SEASONAL CLOSURES VERSUS LONG   

00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:39.080
THERE ARE OPTIONS RELATED TO    
SEASONAL CLOSURES VERSUS LONG   
TERM SO OUR HOPE IS THAT OUT    

00:13:39.082 --> 00:13:39.813
SEASONAL CLOSURES VERSUS LONG   
TERM SO OUR HOPE IS THAT OUT    
OF THIS STUDY WE'RE GOING TO    

00:13:39.815 --> 00:13:42.216
TERM SO OUR HOPE IS THAT OUT    
OF THIS STUDY WE'RE GOING TO    
COME OUT WITH SOME SOLID        

00:13:42.218 --> 00:13:42.917
OF THIS STUDY WE'RE GOING TO    
COME OUT WITH SOME SOLID        
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT 

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:45.652
COME OUT WITH SOME SOLID        
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT 
WILL SUPPORT NEIGHBORHOODS WHO  

00:13:45.654 --> 00:13:46.387
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT 
WILL SUPPORT NEIGHBORHOODS WHO  
ARE DOING THESE SEASONAL OR     

00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:49.490
WILL SUPPORT NEIGHBORHOODS WHO  
ARE DOING THESE SEASONAL OR     
LONGER TERM STREET CLOSURES.    

00:13:49.492 --> 00:13:50.691
ARE DOING THESE SEASONAL OR     
LONGER TERM STREET CLOSURES.    
SO NAVIGATION AND SAFETY THIS   

00:13:50.693 --> 00:13:54.062
LONGER TERM STREET CLOSURES.    
SO NAVIGATION AND SAFETY THIS   
IS TALKING ABOUT TWO WAY        

00:13:54.064 --> 00:13:57.565
SO NAVIGATION AND SAFETY THIS   
IS TALKING ABOUT TWO WAY        
RESTORATION ON 5TH DIVISION.    

00:13:57.567 --> 00:13:58.499
IS TALKING ABOUT TWO WAY

PROJECT.                        
THIS IS NOT A PROJECT THAT      
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE       

00:14:46.648 --> 00:14:48.249
                          NEXT  
FEW YEARS.                      
THIS IS A LONG RANGE PROJECT

00:14:49.118 --> 00:14:49.750
THIS IS A LONG RANGE PROJECT    
THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGING  
INTERSECTIONS AND I WOULD ALSO  

00:14:49.752 --> 00:14:50.484
THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGING  
INTERSECTIONS AND I WOULD ALSO  
POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THIS     

00:14:50.486 --> 00:14:51.352
INTERSECTIONS AND I WOULD ALSO  
POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THIS     
PROJECT AREA DOES EXTEND BEYOND 

00:14:51.354 --> 00:14:51.885
POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THIS     
PROJECT AREA DOES EXTEND BEYOND 
THE CURRENT BOUNDARIES.         

00:14:51.887 --> 00:14:52.587
PROJECT AREA DOES EXTEND BEYOND 
THE CURRENT BOUNDARIES.         
BUT IF I WERE A BETTING WOMAN I 

00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:53.521
THE CURRENT BOUNDARIES.         
BUT IF I WERE A BETTING WOMAN I 
WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO 

00:14:53.523 --> 00:14:54.155
BUT IF I WERE A BETTING WOMAN I 
WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO 
BE INCLUDED IN OUR DEVELOPMENT  

00:14:54.157 --> 00:14:54.422
WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO 
BE INCLUDED IN OUR DEVELOPMENT  
PLAN.

THE DOTTED LINES INDICATE TO    

00:15:16.078 --> 00:15:19.680
WASHINGTON STREET.              
THE DOTTED LINES INDICATE TO    
THOSE PROJECT AREAS AND MUCH    

00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:20.481
THE DOTTED LINES INDICATE TO    
THOSE PROJECT AREAS AND MUCH    
OF THOSE PROJECT AREAS DOES     

00:15:20.483 --> 00:15:21.081
THOSE PROJECT AREAS AND MUCH    
OF THOSE PROJECT AREAS DOES     
EXTEND BEYOND THE CURRENT       

00:15:21.083 --> 00:15:24.118
OF THOSE PROJECT AREAS DOES     
EXTEND BEYOND THE CURRENT       
BOUNDARIES.                     

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.019
EXTEND BEYOND THE CURRENT       
BOUNDARIES.                     
AND THEN FINALLY TRANSIT        

00:15:25.021 --> 00:15:28.022
BOUNDARIES.                     
AND THEN FINALLY TRANSIT        
ENHANCEMENTS.                   

00:15:28.024 --> 00:15:29.123
AND THEN FINALLY TRANSIT        
ENHANCEMENTS.                   
WE OF COURSE HAVE BEEN WORKING  

00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:32.026
ENHANCEMENTS.                   
WE OF COURSE HAVE BEEN WORKING  
REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE RTA AND 

00:15:32.028 --> 00:15:32.860
WE OF COURSE HAVE BEEN WORKING  
REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE RTA AND 
THEIR LONG RANGE PLANS AND ON   

00:15:32.862 --> 00:15:36.196
REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE RTA AND 
THEIR LONG RANGE PLANS AND ON   
THIS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT OUR  

00:15:36.198 --> 00:15:39.166
THEIR LONG RANGE PLANS AND ON   
THIS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT OUR  
OVERALL APPROACH IS TO RESERVE  

00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:40.000
THIS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT OUR  
OVERALL APPROACH IS TO RESERVE  
STREET SPACE ON KEY TRANSIT     

00:15:40.002 --> 00:15:43.837
OVERALL APPROACH IS TO RESERVE  
STREET SPACE ON KEY TRANSIT     
CORRIDORS FOR FUTURE            

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:44.205
STREET SPACE ON KEY TRANSIT     
CORRIDORS FOR FUTURE            
IMPROVEMENTS.                   

00:15:44.207 --> 00:15:45.405
CORRIDORS FOR FUTURE            
IMPROVEMENTS.                   
SO I THINK THERE'S STILL A LOT  

00:15:45.407 --> 00:15:48.442
IMPROVEMENTS.                   
SO I THINK THERE'S STILL A LOT  
OF STUDY TO BE DONE AND WORK TO 

00:15:48.444 --> 00:15:49.377
SO I THINK THERE'S STILL A LOT  
OF STUDY TO BE DONE AND WORK TO 
BE DONE BOTH ON THE SIDE AND ON 

00:15:49.379 --> 00:15:51.245
OF STUDY TO BE DONE AND WORK TO 
BE DONE BOTH ON THE SIDE AND ON 
OUR SIDE.                       

00:15:51.247 --> 00:15:52.279
BE DONE BOTH ON THE SIDE AND ON 
OUR SIDE.                       
BUT IN THE SHORT TERM WHAT      

00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:55.249
OUR SIDE.                       
BUT IN THE SHORT TERM WHAT      
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TRANSIT     

00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:55.917
BUT IN THE SHORT TERM WHAT      
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TRANSIT     
IMPROVEMENTS ON RIGHT NOW       

00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:59.753

THE TOP FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD   
FROM SO LOOKING AT SIGNAL       

00:16:02.692 --> 00:16:03.423
THE TOP FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD   
FROM SO LOOKING AT SIGNAL

COULDN'T SEE THE DINING ROOM    

00:27:26.175 --> 00:27:29.509
RESIDING IN AN AREA THAT I      
COULDN'T SEE THE DINING ROOM    
BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF MY JOB   

00:27:29.511 --> 00:27:30.177

00:28:00.209 --> 00:28:01.141
RESISTANCE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY  
ACROSS THE BOARD.               
MOST COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE       

00:28:01.143 --> 00:28:04.477
ACROSS THE BOARD.               
MOST COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE

MOST COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE       
ARISEN TEND TO FOCUS ON BROADER 
LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT CONCERNS   

00:28:05.147 --> 00:28:08.081

IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IN A TIME   
OF LABOR SHORTAGE WHICH I THINK 

00:33:05.914 --> 00:33:08.915
IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IN A TIME   
OF LABOR SHORTAGE WHICH I THINK 
MANY OF OUR INDUSTRIES HERE IN  

00:33:08.917 --> 00:33:09.849
OF LABOR SHORTAGE WHICH I THINK 
MANY OF OUR INDUSTRIES HERE IN  
ANN ARBOR FACED OPENING UP THE  

00:33:09.851 --> 00:33:13.119
MANY OF OUR INDUSTRIES HERE IN  
ANN ARBOR FACED OPENING UP THE  
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO    

00:33:13.121 --> 00:33:13.853

MIGHT OTHERWISE BE EXCLUDED.    

00:33:13.855 --> 00:33:15.922
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO    
MIGHT OTHERWISE BE EXCLUDED.    
IT IS A GOOD THING IT'S IN THE  

00:33:15.924 --> 00:33:16.690

IT IS A GOOD THING IT'S IN THE  
PUBLIC INTEREST AS WELL AS THE  
INDIVIDUAL WORKERS INTEREST AND 

00:33:19.694 --> 00:33:20.627
PUBLIC INTEREST AS WELL AS THE  
INDIVIDUAL WORKERS INTEREST AND 
OF COURSE IT INCREASES THE POOL 

00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:21.228
INDIVIDUAL WORKERS INTEREST AND 
OF COURSE IT INCREASES THE POOL 
AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYERS.         

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.497
OF COURSE IT INCREASES THE POOL 
AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYERS.         
SO IT SEEMS LIKE A WIN WIN WIN  

00:33:24.499 --> 00:33:25.298
AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYERS.         
SO IT SEEMS LIKE A WIN WIN WIN  
TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS THAT ARE  

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.268
SO IT SEEMS LIKE A WIN WIN WIN  
TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS THAT ARE  
NOT IN FACT ESSENTIAL TO THE

01:17:54.133 --> 01:17:58.668
ACQUIRING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY 
AS THEY REPLACE THEIR EXISTING  
AND IS THROUGH KNAP THAT THE    

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:02.239
AS THEY REPLACE THEIR EXISTING  
AND IS THROUGH KNAP THAT THE    
TESTING OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS    

01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:05.775
AND IS THROUGH KNAP THAT THE    
TESTING OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS    
REGULARLY ROUTINELY DONE AND    

01:18:05.777 --> 01:18:06.810
TESTING OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS    
REGULARLY ROUTINELY DONE AND    
THAT WHEN KNAPP SAYS HEY, WE    

01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:10.014
REGULARLY ROUTINELY DONE AND    
THAT WHEN KNAPP SAYS HEY, WE    
GOT A REAL GOOD ONE, THEY COULD 

01:18:10.016 --> 01:18:14.418
THAT WHEN KNAPP SAYS HEY, WE    
GOT A REAL GOOD ONE, THEY COULD 
BE ADOPTED BY THE BY THE

GOT A REAL GOOD ONE, THEY COULD 
BE ADOPTED BY THE BY THE        
CONTROLLED BUT I MEAN THE OTHER

PARTS OF MAPPING IT COULD BE    

01:18:18.424 --> 01:18:19.156

PARTS OF MAPPING IT COULD BE    
ADOPTED BY THE CONTROLLED BURN  

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:20.958
PARTS OF MAPPING IT COULD BE

ADOPTED BY THE CONTROLLED BURN  
PART.                           
IT WAS REALLY SAID MUCH MORE    

01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:25.596
PART.                           
IT WAS REALLY SAID MUCH MORE    
CLEARLY BY MR. WONG BUT HE MADE 

01:18:25.598 --> 01:18:28.833
IT WAS REALLY SAID MUCH MORE    
CLEARLY BY MR. WONG BUT HE MADE 
IT SOUND AS IF THE UPGRADING IS 

01:18:28.835 --> 01:18:29.700
CLEARLY BY MR. WONG BUT HE MADE 
IT SOUND AS IF THE UPGRADING IS 
ALREADY A ROUTINE AND IF WE     

01:18:29.702 --> 01:18:30.500
IT SOUND AS IF THE UPGRADING IS 
ALREADY A ROUTINE AND IF WE     
WANT THEM TO ARTICULATE THAT AS 

01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:33.303
ALREADY A ROUTINE AND IF WE     
WANT THEM TO ARTICULATE THAT AS 
A PLAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO    

01:18:33.305 --> 01:18:33.637
WANT THEM TO ARTICULATE THAT AS 
A PLAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO    
THAT.                           

01:18:33.639 --> 01:18:34.604
A PLAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO    
THAT.                           
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT   

01:18:34.606 --> 01:18:37.508
THAT.                           
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT   
WE NEED THAT AND I THINK THE    

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:38.441
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT   
WE NEED THAT AND I THINK THE    
SUNSET IS A GOOD IDEA FOR THE   

01:18:38.443 --> 01:18:40.244
WE NEED THAT AND I THINK THE    
SUNSET IS A GOOD IDEA FOR THE   
REASONS THAT MR. MAYOR          

01:18:40.246 --> 01:18:40.978
SUNSET IS A GOOD IDEA FOR THE   
REASONS THAT MR. MAYOR          
ARTICULATED BECAUSE THIS POLICY 

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:44.081
REASONS THAT MR. MAYOR          
ARTICULATED BECAUSE THIS POLICY 
APPLIES TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS  

01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:47.751
ARTICULATED BECAUSE THIS POLICY 
APPLIES TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS  
AS WELL AS THE CITY WHO WILL    

01:18:47.753 --> 01:18:48.551
APPLIES TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS  
AS WELL AS THE CITY WHO WILL    
NOT NECESSARILY UPDATE AS       

01:18:48.553 --> 01:18:48.819
AS WELL AS THE CITY WHO WILL    
NOT NECESSARILY UPDATE AS       
QUICKLY.

NOT NECESSARILY UPDATE AS       
QUICKLY.                        
SO IT'S MORE PRUDENT TO OFFER A

QUICKLY.                        
SO IT'S MORE PRUDENT TO OFFER A 
SUNSET IN MY OPINION I GOT BOB  

01:18:56.395 --> 01:18:58.262
SO IT'S MORE PRUDENT TO OFFER A

I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO POINT  
OUT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A      

01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:05.468
I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO POINT  
OUT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A      
PATTERN SET FORTH IN THE
