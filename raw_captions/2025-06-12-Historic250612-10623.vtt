TO MAKE IT ENERGY EFFICIENT IS  
CERTAIN TO DESTROY A LOT MORE   

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:07.869

TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULDN'T  
RIGHT THE STRUCTURE TO THE      

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:39.641
TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULDN'T

00:28:39.643 --> 00:28:43.144
RIGHT THE STRUCTURE TO THE      
POINT WHERE IT TAKE A LONG TIME 
BUT IT COULD COLLAPSE RIGHT.    

00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:44.146
POINT WHERE IT TAKE A LONG TIME 
BUT IT COULD COLLAPSE RIGHT.    
IF YOU HAVE WATER COMING INTO   

00:28:44.148 --> 00:28:44.746
BUT IT COULD COLLAPSE RIGHT.    
IF YOU HAVE WATER COMING INTO   
THE WALL IT COULD READ THE

SO THE PROPER WAY TO DO IT FOR  

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.789
NO MOLD AND EVERYTHING ELSE.    
SO THE PROPER WAY TO DO IT FOR  
BUILDING CODE TODAY WOULD BE TO

00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:04.679
IS THAT JUST THROUGHOUT ON THE  
HISTORIC HOUSE AS WELL?         
>> YEAH, YEAH.                  

00:32:04.681 --> 00:32:07.649
HISTORIC HOUSE AS WELL?         
>> YEAH, YEAH.                  
THE WINDOWS ARE THEY'VE BEEN    

00:32:07.651 --> 00:32:08.049
>> YEAH, YEAH.                  
THE WINDOWS ARE THEY'VE BEEN    
CHANGED.                        

00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:11.886
THE WINDOWS ARE THEY'VE BEEN    
CHANGED.                        
I I WAS US TO WEAR WHEN JILL    

00:32:11.888 --> 00:32:12.587
CHANGED.                        
I I WAS US TO WEAR WHEN JILL    
SAID THERE WAS ALUMINUM SIDING  

00:32:12.589 --> 00:32:15.590
I I WAS US TO WEAR WHEN JILL    
SAID THERE WAS ALUMINUM SIDING  
ON ONE TIME SO THAT'S WHY THEY  

00:32:15.592 --> 00:32:16.257
SAID THERE WAS ALUMINUM SIDING  
ON ONE TIME SO THAT'S WHY THEY  
HAVE PIECES OF ALUMINUM ON      

00:32:16.259 --> 00:32:16.958
ON ONE TIME SO THAT'S WHY THEY  
HAVE PIECES OF ALUMINUM ON      
THERE BUT THEY CHOSE TO NEVER   

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.360
HAVE PIECES OF ALUMINUM ON      
THERE BUT THEY CHOSE TO NEVER   
TAKE IT OFF.                    

00:32:19.362 --> 00:32:20.362
THERE BUT THEY CHOSE TO NEVER   
TAKE IT OFF.                    
SO IT'S A MIXTURE OF ALUMINUM   

00:32:20.364 --> 00:32:22.430
TAKE IT OFF.                    
SO IT'S A MIXTURE OF ALUMINUM   
WOOD AND STACKED MOLDINGS.      

00:32:22.432 --> 00:32:23.165
SO IT'S A MIXTURE OF ALUMINUM   
WOOD AND STACKED MOLDINGS.      
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE         

00:32:23.167 --> 00:32:23.899
WOOD AND STACKED MOLDINGS.      
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE         
COVERING UP THE ORIGINAL        

00:32:23.901 --> 00:32:24.499
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE         
COVERING UP THE ORIGINAL        
MOLDINGS WITH A NEW PIECE       

00:32:24.501 --> 00:32:26.234
COVERING UP THE ORIGINAL        
MOLDINGS WITH A NEW PIECE       
OF WOOD.                        

00:32:26.236 --> 00:32:27.135
MOLDINGS WITH A NEW PIECE       
OF WOOD.                        
SO I'M KIND OF CURIOUS TO       

00:32:27.137 --> 00:32:27.735
OF WOOD.                        
SO I'M KIND OF CURIOUS TO       
WHAT'S BEHIND THERE.            

00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:30.472
SO I'M KIND OF CURIOUS TO       
WHAT'S BEHIND THERE.            
USUALLY IF SOMEBODY PUTS A      

00:32:30.474 --> 00:32:31.473
WHAT'S BEHIND THERE.            
USUALLY IF SOMEBODY PUTS A      
PIECE OF WOOD OVER A PIECE      

00:32:31.475 --> 00:32:32.140
USUALLY IF SOMEBODY PUTS A      
PIECE OF WOOD OVER A PIECE      
OF WOOD IT MEANS THAT THEY'RE   

00:32:32.142 --> 00:32:34.375
PIECE OF WOOD OVER A PIECE      
OF WOOD IT MEANS THAT THEY'RE   
HIDING SOMETHING IT COULD BE    

00:32:34.377 --> 00:32:35.210
OF WOOD IT MEANS THAT THEY'RE   
HIDING SOMETHING IT COULD BE    
ROTTEN IN THERE, WHO KNOWS?     

00:32:35.212 --> 00:32:38.713
HIDING SOMETHING IT COULD BE    
ROTTEN IN THERE, WHO KNOWS?     
>> BUT WITH YOU KNOW, WE WOULD  

00:32:38.715 --> 00:32:39.814
ROTTEN IN THERE, WHO KNOWS?     
>> BUT WITH YOU KNOW, WE WOULD  
BE ABLE TO MATCH LIKE A HOUSE   

00:32:39.816 --> 00:32:42.784
>> BUT WITH YOU KNOW, WE WOULD  
BE ABLE TO MATCH LIKE A HOUSE   
ACROSS A STREET FOR INSTANCE,   

00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:43.518
BE ABLE TO MATCH LIKE A HOUSE   
ACROSS A STREET FOR INSTANCE,   
HAS SOME REALLY NICE WINDOW     

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.121
ACROSS A STREET FOR INSTANCE,   
HAS SOME REALLY NICE WINDOW     
TRIM THEN I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S  

00:32:46.123 --> 00:32:46.855
HAS SOME REALLY NICE WINDOW     
TRIM THEN I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S  
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THIS HOUSE 

00:32:46.857 --> 00:32:49.857
TRIM THEN I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S  
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THIS HOUSE 
LOOKED LIKE WHEN IT WAS BUILT   

00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:50.525
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THIS HOUSE 
LOOKED LIKE WHEN IT WAS BUILT   
AND WE COULD MATCH THAT, YOU    

00:32:50.527 --> 00:32:57.032
LOOKED LIKE WHEN IT WAS BUILT   
AND WE COULD MATCH THAT, YOU    
KNOW, THE HEADPIECE WOULD MATCH 

00:32:57.034 --> 00:32:57.999
AND WE COULD MATCH THAT, YOU    
KNOW, THE HEADPIECE WOULD MATCH 
SOME OF IT WAS ORIGINALLY AND   

00:32:58.001 --> 00:32:59.066
KNOW, THE HEADPIECE WOULD MATCH 
SOME OF IT WAS ORIGINALLY AND   
WE'D HAVE A CHANCE TO REDO IT   

00:32:59.068 --> 00:33:02.103
SOME OF IT WAS ORIGINALLY AND   
WE'D HAVE A CHANCE TO REDO IT   
ALL TO THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD 

00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:02.937
WE'D HAVE A CHANCE TO REDO IT   
ALL TO THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD 
I THINK THAT SOUNDS NICE BUT    

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:05.140
ALL TO THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD 
I THINK THAT SOUNDS NICE BUT    
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I THINK   

00:33:05.142 --> 00:33:05.807
I THINK THAT SOUNDS NICE BUT    
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I THINK   
WE'RE HEARING THAT RIGHT.       

00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:06.674
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I THINK   
WE'RE HEARING THAT RIGHT.       
IS THAT NOT A PROBLEM THAT      

00:33:06.676 --> 00:33:09.143
WE'RE HEARING THAT RIGHT.       
IS THAT NOT A PROBLEM THAT      
WASN'T IN THIS APPLICATION THAT 

00:33:09.145 --> 00:33:09.944
IS THAT NOT A PROBLEM THAT      
WASN'T IN THIS APPLICATION THAT 
THE WINDOW TRIM IS NOT IN THIS  

00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:10.344
WASN'T IN THIS APPLICATION THAT 
THE WINDOW TRIM IS NOT IN THIS

00:33:16.352 --> 00:33:17.519
I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS LIKE PART

YEAH, NO IT'S NOT PART OF THE

WRAPPING SOME OF THE CELLS AND

WRAPPING SOME OF THE CELLS AND  
STUFF AND RESTORING THAT IS     

00:33:25.862 --> 00:33:26.194
WRAPPING SOME OF THE CELLS AND  
STUFF AND RESTORING THAT IS     
GREAT.                          

00:33:26.196 --> 00:33:28.896
STUFF AND RESTORING THAT IS     
GREAT.                          
YOU CAN'T BASE IT ON A HOUSE    

00:33:28.898 --> 00:33:29.497
GREAT.                          
YOU CAN'T BASE IT ON A HOUSE    
ACROSS THE STREET THOUGH.       

00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:30.298
YOU CAN'T BASE IT ON A HOUSE    
ACROSS THE STREET THOUGH.       
YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT USED 

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.767
ACROSS THE STREET THOUGH.       
YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT USED 
TO BE THERE OR JUST GO WITH

SOMETHING VERY PLAIN AND        

00:33:33.503 --> 00:33:37.038
TO BE THERE OR JUST GO WITH     
SOMETHING VERY PLAIN AND        
SIMILAR TO WHAT'S THERE NOW.    

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.039

SIMILAR TO WHAT'S THERE NOW.    
>> WELL, IT COULD BE IT COULD   

00:33:38.041 --> 00:33:39.640
SIMILAR TO WHAT'S THERE NOW.    
>> WELL, IT COULD BE IT COULD   
BE TOTALLY ORIGINAL UNDERNEATH  

00:33:39.642 --> 00:33:40.308
>> WELL, IT COULD BE IT COULD   
BE TOTALLY ORIGINAL UNDERNEATH  
BECAUSE IT COULD BE STACKED     

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.841
BE TOTALLY ORIGINAL UNDERNEATH  
BECAUSE IT COULD BE STACKED     
THINGS ON TOP.                  

00:33:40.843 --> 00:33:41.776
BECAUSE IT COULD BE STACKED     
THINGS ON TOP.                  
>> SO AND YOU MAY SEE THAT THIS 

00:33:41.778 --> 00:33:44.846
THINGS ON TOP.                  
>> SO AND YOU MAY SEE THAT THIS
