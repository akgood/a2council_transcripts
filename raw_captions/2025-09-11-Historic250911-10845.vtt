THAT WAS BROUGHT UP DURING OUR  

00:12:04.851 --> 00:12:05.749
THE TWO DRIVEWAY'S ONE THING    
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP DURING OUR  
VISIT WAS THAT THE CURB CUTS    

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:08.853
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP DURING OUR  
VISIT WAS THAT THE CURB CUTS

I'D AGREE AND I'D JUST ADD A    
COUPLE OF THINGS.               
THE ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT   

00:12:49.362 --> 00:12:53.397
COUPLE OF THINGS.               
THE ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT   
THE FOR THIS PROPERTY THE THE   

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:54.332
THE ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT   
THE FOR THIS PROPERTY THE THE   
THE NORTH PROPERTY LINE IS

SO THIS THIS THERE'S NOT LIKE A 

00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:05.910
RIGHT AT THAT NINE FOOT EDGE.   
SO THIS THIS THERE'S NOT LIKE A 
LOT OF ROOM TO TO TO BUILD A    

00:13:05.912 --> 00:13:08.513

WIDER DRIVEWAY AND THE REASON   
I'M BRINGING THAT UP IS BECAUSE 

00:13:09.515 --> 00:13:10.315
WIDER DRIVEWAY AND THE REASON   
I'M BRINGING THAT UP IS BECAUSE 
THE DRIVEWAY DOES EXTEND ALL    

00:13:10.317 --> 00:13:12.917
I'M BRINGING THAT UP IS BECAUSE 
THE DRIVEWAY DOES EXTEND ALL    
THE WAY TO THE HOUSE AND WE

SITE AND SEEING HOW NARROW IT   
IS NOTING THAT THE PROPERTY     
LINE IS RIGHT THERE AND THEN    

00:13:30.336 --> 00:13:32.469
IS NOTING THAT THE PROPERTY     
LINE IS RIGHT THERE AND THEN    
THE OTHER KEY THING IS THAT THE 

00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:35.539
LINE IS RIGHT THERE AND THEN    
THE OTHER KEY THING IS THAT THE 
GRAVEL ALREADY DOES GO EXTEND   

00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:35.974
THE OTHER KEY THING IS THAT THE 
GRAVEL ALREADY DOES GO EXTEND

DISCUSSION I REMEMBER US SORT   
OF GOING OVER WAS JUST TRYING   

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.985
DISCUSSION I REMEMBER US SORT   
OF GOING OVER WAS JUST TRYING   
TO DECIDE HOW FAR BACK OR WHERE

OF GOING OVER WAS JUST TRYING   
TO DECIDE HOW FAR BACK OR WHERE

00:39:33.898 --> 00:39:36.299
THAT.                           
BUT I THINK THAT FROM AN

OF SOLIDS TO VOID'S AND         
PROPORTION OF OPENINGS.         
IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATE TO DESIGN 

01:30:47.902 --> 01:30:50.870
PROPORTION OF OPENINGS.         
IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATE TO DESIGN 
A NEW ADDITION IN A MANNER THAT 

01:30:50.872 --> 01:30:51.638
IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATE TO DESIGN 
A NEW ADDITION IN A MANNER THAT 
MAKES IT CLEAR WHAT IS HISTORIC 

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.640
A NEW ADDITION IN A MANNER THAT

AND WHAT IS NEW.                

01:30:53.642 --> 01:30:54.240
MAKES IT CLEAR WHAT IS HISTORIC

ALL RIGHT.                      

01:30:54.242 --> 01:30:55.341
AND WHAT IS NEW.                
ALL RIGHT.                      
I HAVE A FEW MORE COMMENTS FOR  

01:30:55.343 --> 01:31:01.381
ALL RIGHT.                      
I HAVE A FEW MORE COMMENTS FOR  
YOU.                            

01:31:01.383 --> 01:31:02.582
I HAVE A FEW MORE COMMENTS FOR  
YOU.                            
>> SO NORMALLY WHEN WE TALK     

01:31:02.584 --> 01:31:05.818
YOU.                            
>> SO NORMALLY WHEN WE TALK     
ABOUT RESIDENTIAL HOUSES AND    

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.519
>> SO NORMALLY WHEN WE TALK     
ABOUT RESIDENTIAL HOUSES AND    
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH 

01:31:06.521 --> 01:31:13.193
ABOUT RESIDENTIAL HOUSES AND    
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH 
THIS WAS IS WE WE INVOKE THE 50 

01:31:13.195 --> 01:31:14.127
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH 
THIS WAS IS WE WE INVOKE THE 50 
PERCENT RULE THAT'S IN THE      

01:31:14.129 --> 01:31:14.728
THIS WAS IS WE WE INVOKE THE 50 
PERCENT RULE THAT'S IN THE      
DESIGN GUIDELINES.              

01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:15.128
PERCENT RULE THAT'S IN THE      
DESIGN GUIDELINES.              
IT'S NOT A RULE.                

01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:16.662
DESIGN GUIDELINES.              
IT'S NOT A RULE.                
IT'S A GUIDELINE.               

01:31:16.664 --> 01:31:17.731
IT'S NOT A RULE.                
IT'S A GUIDELINE.               
BUT THAT SAYS THAT THE NEITHER  

01:31:17.733 --> 01:31:21.067
IT'S A GUIDELINE.               
BUT THAT SAYS THAT THE NEITHER  
THE FOOTPRINT NOR THE ADDITIONS 

01:31:21.069 --> 01:31:21.835
BUT THAT SAYS THAT THE NEITHER  
THE FOOTPRINT NOR THE ADDITIONS 
FLOOR AREA SHOULD BE MORE THAN  

01:31:21.837 --> 01:31:25.104
THE FOOTPRINT NOR THE ADDITIONS 
FLOOR AREA SHOULD BE MORE THAN  
50 PERCENT OF THAT OF THE       

01:31:25.106 --> 01:31:25.639
FLOOR AREA SHOULD BE MORE THAN  
50 PERCENT OF THAT OF THE       
ORIGINAL HOUSE.                 

01:31:25.641 --> 01:31:29.342
50 PERCENT OF THAT OF THE       
ORIGINAL HOUSE.                 
SO WITH THAT THE THE THE THE    

01:31:29.344 --> 01:31:30.109
ORIGINAL HOUSE.                 
SO WITH THAT THE THE THE THE    
FOOTPRINT INCREASE IN THIS      

01:31:30.111 --> 01:31:33.312
SO WITH THAT THE THE THE THE    
FOOTPRINT INCREASE IN THIS      
BUILDING IS 107 PERCENT AND THE 

01:31:33.314 --> 01:31:36.516
FOOTPRINT INCREASE IN THIS      
BUILDING IS 107 PERCENT AND THE 
FLOOR AREA IS AN INCREASE       

01:31:36.518 --> 01:31:37.316
BUILDING IS 107 PERCENT AND THE 
FLOOR AREA IS AN INCREASE       
OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT  

01:31:37.318 --> 01:31:37.650
FLOOR AREA IS AN INCREASE       
OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT  
PERCENT.                        

01:31:37.652 --> 01:31:40.186
OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT  
PERCENT.                        
SO THE REASON THIS IS DIFFERENT 

01:31:40.188 --> 01:31:40.987
PERCENT.                        
SO THE REASON THIS IS DIFFERENT 
THOUGH IS THAT IT'S DOWNTOWN,   

01:31:40.989 --> 01:31:44.991
SO THE REASON THIS IS DIFFERENT 
THOUGH IS THAT IT'S DOWNTOWN,   
IT'S IN THE DENHA IT'S FLANKED  

01:31:44.993 --> 01:31:45.692
THOUGH IS THAT IT'S DOWNTOWN,   
IT'S IN THE DENHA IT'S FLANKED  
BY VERY LARGE BUILDINGS ON BOTH 

01:31:45.694 --> 01:31:46.125
IT'S IN THE DENHA IT'S FLANKED  
BY VERY LARGE BUILDINGS ON BOTH 
SIDES.                          

01:31:46.127 --> 01:31:48.595
BY VERY LARGE BUILDINGS ON BOTH 
SIDES.                          
IT HAS IT IS A SMALL BACKYARD.  

01:31:48.597 --> 01:31:51.831
SIDES.                          
IT HAS IT IS A SMALL BACKYARD.  
NOBODY ELSE REALLY DOES AND     

01:31:51.833 --> 01:31:52.932
IT HAS IT IS A SMALL BACKYARD.  
NOBODY ELSE REALLY DOES AND     
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT IN IN 

01:31:52.934 --> 01:31:56.937
NOBODY ELSE REALLY DOES AND     
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT IN IN 
CONTEXT THAT WE'RE LOOKING SITE 

01:31:56.939 --> 01:31:57.704
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT IN IN 
CONTEXT THAT WE'RE LOOKING SITE 
SPECIFICALLY RATHER THAN        

01:31:57.706 --> 01:32:00.473
CONTEXT THAT WE'RE LOOKING SITE 
SPECIFICALLY RATHER THAN        
THINKING ABOUT THIS LIKE YOU    

01:32:00.475 --> 01:32:01.240
SPECIFICALLY RATHER THAN        
THINKING ABOUT THIS LIKE YOU    
WOULD ABOUT THE OLD FOURTH WARD 

01:32:01.242 --> 01:32:01.975
THINKING ABOUT THIS LIKE YOU    
WOULD ABOUT THE OLD FOURTH WARD 
OR THE OLD WEST SIDE OR THE     

01:32:01.977 --> 01:32:04.077
WOULD ABOUT THE OLD FOURTH WARD 
OR THE OLD WEST SIDE OR THE     
BROADWAY HISTORIC DISTRICT, YOU 

01:32:04.079 --> 01:32:04.810
OR THE OLD WEST SIDE OR THE     
BROADWAY HISTORIC DISTRICT, YOU 
REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE      

01:32:04.812 --> 01:32:05.545
BROADWAY HISTORIC DISTRICT, YOU 
REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE      
SETTING AND TAKE THAT INTO      

01:32:05.547 --> 01:32:07.881
REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE      
SETTING AND TAKE THAT INTO      
CONSIDERATION.                  

01:32:07.883 --> 01:32:08.881
SETTING AND TAKE THAT INTO      
CONSIDERATION.                  
THE VOLUME OF THE ADDITIONS IS  

01:32:08.883 --> 01:32:09.482
CONSIDERATION.                  
THE VOLUME OF THE ADDITIONS IS  
PUSHING THE SIZE LIMITS         

01:32:09.484 --> 01:32:11.585
THE VOLUME OF THE ADDITIONS IS  
PUSHING THE SIZE LIMITS         
COMPARED TO THE HISTORIC        

01:32:11.587 --> 01:32:12.452
PUSHING THE SIZE LIMITS         
COMPARED TO THE HISTORIC        
BUILDING THEY DID MANAGE TO     

01:32:12.454 --> 01:32:13.219
COMPARED TO THE HISTORIC        
BUILDING THEY DID MANAGE TO     
MAKE IT LOWER WHICH I           

01:32:13.221 --> 01:32:16.122
BUILDING THEY DID MANAGE TO     
MAKE IT LOWER WHICH I           
APPRECIATE BUT THE DESIGN       

01:32:16.124 --> 01:32:16.856
MAKE IT LOWER WHICH I           
APPRECIATE BUT THE DESIGN       
MATERIALS ARE LOW KEY AND       

01:32:16.858 --> 01:32:19.592
APPRECIATE BUT THE DESIGN       
MATERIALS ARE LOW KEY AND       
COMPATIBLE IN THE WORK PROPOSED 

01:32:19.594 --> 01:32:20.293

SEEING THE GRAPHICS HERE OR THE 
PHOTOGRAPHS IT FEELS TO ME LIKE 
WHEN WE WERE STANDING BEHIND    

01:32:46.455 --> 01:32:47.186
PHOTOGRAPHS IT FEELS TO ME LIKE 
WHEN WE WERE STANDING BEHIND    
THIS BUILDING THAT THE THE      

01:32:47.188 --> 01:32:50.223
WHEN WE WERE STANDING BEHIND    
THIS BUILDING THAT THE THE      
NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS ON BOTH   

01:32:50.225 --> 01:32:52.959
THIS BUILDING THAT THE THE      
NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS ON BOTH   
SIDES FELT A LOT CLOSER AND I   

01:32:52.961 --> 01:32:53.627
NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS ON BOTH   
SIDES FELT A LOT CLOSER AND I   
FELT LIKE THE PARKING LOT       

01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:56.729
SIDES FELT A LOT CLOSER AND I   
FELT LIKE THE PARKING LOT       
BEHIND THE BUILDING WAS MUCH    

01:32:56.731 --> 01:32:57.663
FELT LIKE THE PARKING LOT       
BEHIND THE BUILDING WAS MUCH    
MORE ENCLOSED AND ENCAPSULATED. 

01:32:57.665 --> 01:33:01.300
BEHIND THE BUILDING WAS MUCH    
MORE ENCLOSED AND ENCAPSULATED. 
I ONLY SAY THAT BECAUSE TO TO   

01:33:01.302 --> 01:33:01.968
MORE ENCLOSED AND ENCAPSULATED. 
I ONLY SAY THAT BECAUSE TO TO   
SORT OF REINFORCE WHAT JILL     

01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:04.470
I ONLY SAY THAT BECAUSE TO TO   
SORT OF REINFORCE WHAT JILL     
SAID IN THE STAFF REPORT I FEEL 

01:33:04.472 --> 01:33:05.105
SORT OF REINFORCE WHAT JILL     
SAID IN THE STAFF REPORT I FEEL 
LIKE WHERE THIS EDITION GOES    

01:33:05.107 --> 01:33:08.375
SAID IN THE STAFF REPORT I FEEL 
LIKE WHERE THIS EDITION GOES    
BEHIND THE BUILDING HOW YOU CAN 

01:33:08.377 --> 01:33:09.275
LIKE WHERE THIS EDITION GOES    
BEHIND THE BUILDING HOW YOU CAN 
SEE THE MASSING OF THE BUILDING 

01:33:09.277 --> 01:33:09.876
BEHIND THE BUILDING HOW YOU CAN 
SEE THE MASSING OF THE BUILDING 
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO IT.          

01:33:09.878 --> 01:33:13.546
SEE THE MASSING OF THE BUILDING 
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO IT.          
I DON'T THINK EVEN THOUGH IT'S  

01:33:13.548 --> 01:33:15.748
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO IT.          
I DON'T THINK EVEN THOUGH IT'S  
GOING ABOVE THE RESIDENTIAL     

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:16.582
I DON'T THINK EVEN THOUGH IT'S  
GOING ABOVE THE RESIDENTIAL     
GUIDELINE FOR ADDITIONS, I      

01:33:16.584 --> 01:33:20.052
GOING ABOVE THE RESIDENTIAL     
GUIDELINE FOR ADDITIONS, I      
DON'T THINK IT POSES THE RISK   

01:33:20.054 --> 01:33:23.856
GUIDELINE FOR ADDITIONS, I      
DON'T THINK IT POSES THE RISK   
OF DWARFING OR OVER COMPETING   

01:33:23.858 --> 01:33:24.957
DON'T THINK IT POSES THE RISK   
OF DWARFING OR OVER COMPETING   
WITH IT WITH THE THE MAIN HOUSE 

01:33:24.959 --> 01:33:25.458
OF DWARFING OR OVER COMPETING   
WITH IT WITH THE THE MAIN HOUSE 
THAT'S BEING RESTORED.          

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:28.127
WITH IT WITH THE THE MAIN HOUSE 
THAT'S BEING RESTORED.          
I DIDN'T GET THE SENSE THERE    

01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:28.961
THAT'S BEING RESTORED.          
I DIDN'T GET THE SENSE THERE    
WAS A THREAT OF THAT ESPECIALLY 

01:33:28.963 --> 01:33:29.763
I DIDN'T GET THE SENSE THERE    
WAS A THREAT OF THAT ESPECIALLY 
BECAUSE IT'S SO ENCLOSED BY     

01:33:29.765 --> 01:33:31.965
WAS A THREAT OF THAT ESPECIALLY 
BECAUSE IT'S SO ENCLOSED BY     
EVERYTHING.                     

01:33:31.967 --> 01:33:36.736
BECAUSE IT'S SO ENCLOSED BY     
EVERYTHING.                     
YEAH, THE I MEAN THIS THIS IS   

01:33:36.738 --> 01:33:39.406
EVERYTHING.                     
YEAH, THE I MEAN THIS THIS IS   
REALLY A GOOD PHOTO HERE JUST   

01:33:39.408 --> 01:33:42.775
YEAH, THE I MEAN THIS THIS IS   
REALLY A GOOD PHOTO HERE JUST   
TO GET A FEEL FOR THE CONTEXT   

01:33:42.777 --> 01:33:43.743
REALLY A GOOD PHOTO HERE JUST   
TO GET A FEEL FOR THE CONTEXT   
WHERE YOU HAVE THE NEIGHBORING  

01:33:43.745 --> 01:33:50.282
TO GET A FEEL FOR THE CONTEXT   
WHERE YOU HAVE THE NEIGHBORING  
BUILDINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH RIGHT 

01:33:50.284 --> 01:33:54.253
WHERE YOU HAVE THE NEIGHBORING  
BUILDINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH RIGHT 
IN LINE MORE OR LESS WITH WITH  

01:33:54.255 --> 01:33:54.820
BUILDINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH RIGHT 
IN LINE MORE OR LESS WITH WITH  
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED.          

01:33:54.822 --> 01:33:58.725
IN LINE MORE OR LESS WITH WITH  
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED.          
SO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY     

01:33:58.727 --> 01:34:02.194
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED.          
SO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY     
IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT  

01:34:02.196 --> 01:34:06.232
SO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY     
IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT  
THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS   

01:34:06.234 --> 01:34:06.966
IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT  
THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS   
THREE STORIES THAT THIS IS      

01:34:06.968 --> 01:34:07.767
THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS   
THREE STORIES THAT THIS IS      
OBVIOUSLY A TWO STORY ADDITION  

01:34:07.769 --> 01:34:09.902
THREE STORIES THAT THIS IS      
OBVIOUSLY A TWO STORY ADDITION  
WITH THE ONE STORY THAT YOU CAN 

01:34:09.904 --> 01:34:13.272
OBVIOUSLY A TWO STORY ADDITION  
WITH THE ONE STORY THAT YOU CAN 
SEE LIKE A LITTLE BIT POKING    

01:34:13.274 --> 01:34:14.240
WITH THE ONE STORY THAT YOU CAN 
SEE LIKE A LITTLE BIT POKING    
OUT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.  

01:34:14.242 --> 01:34:15.075
SEE LIKE A LITTLE BIT POKING    
OUT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.  
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE AN      

01:34:15.077 --> 01:34:15.942
OUT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.  
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE AN      
ADDITION WHERE THEY THEY BUMPED 

01:34:15.944 --> 01:34:17.910
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE AN      
ADDITION WHERE THEY THEY BUMPED 
UP THE FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE     

01:34:17.912 --> 01:34:18.944
ADDITION WHERE THEY THEY BUMPED 
UP THE FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE     
THAT LOOKS LIKE A KIND OF A     

01:34:18.946 --> 01:34:21.881
UP THE FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE     
THAT LOOKS LIKE A KIND OF A     
HALF STOREY OR SOMETHING LIKE   

01:34:21.883 --> 01:34:22.148
THAT LOOKS LIKE A KIND OF A     
HALF STOREY OR SOMETHING LIKE   
THAT.                           

01:34:22.150 --> 01:34:22.916
HALF STOREY OR SOMETHING LIKE
