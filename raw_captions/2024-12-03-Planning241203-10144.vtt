NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES BUT    
FOR NOT CONFORMING NO FORMAL    

00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:06.202
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES BUT    
FOR NOT CONFORMING NO FORMAL

00:37:06.204 --> 00:37:07.036
FOR NOT CONFORMING NO FORMAL    
STRUCTURE NOT FOR ME COMPLETELY 
SEPARATE SO WE'RE NOT MAKING

ANY CHANGES OR NOT FORMING LOTS 

00:37:10.142 --> 00:37:11.140

ANY CHANGES OR NOT FORMING LOTS 
AND I THINK THIS IS WHY I'M     

00:37:11.142 --> 00:37:14.310
ANY CHANGES OR NOT FORMING LOTS 
AND I THINK THIS IS WHY I'M     
CONFUSED BECAUSE THE TABLE THAT

CONFUSED BECAUSE THE TABLE THAT 
YOU SHOWED WAS ABOUT

CONFUSED BECAUSE THE TABLE THAT 
YOU SHOWED WAS ABOUT            
NONCONFORMING LOTS.             

00:37:17.549 --> 00:37:18.481
YOU SHOWED WAS ABOUT            
NONCONFORMING LOTS.             
WELL, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THAT  

00:37:18.483 --> 00:37:19.349
NONCONFORMING LOTS.             
WELL, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THAT  
WAS THE INFORMATION THAT WAS    

00:37:19.351 --> 00:37:19.716
WELL, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THAT  
WAS THE INFORMATION THAT WAS    
REQUESTED THAT THIS             

00:37:19.718 --> 00:37:21.851
WAS THE INFORMATION THAT WAS    
REQUESTED THAT THIS             
ORGANIZATION WE SUPPLY THAT     

00:37:21.853 --> 00:37:22.519
REQUESTED THAT THIS             
ORGANIZATION WE SUPPLY THAT     
INFORMATION IT WAS TALKING      

00:37:22.521 --> 00:37:27.323
ORGANIZATION WE SUPPLY THAT     
INFORMATION IT WAS TALKING      
ABOUT IT WAS A IT WAS JUST A    

00:37:27.325 --> 00:37:29.826
INFORMATION IT WAS TALKING      
ABOUT IT WAS A IT WAS JUST A    
GENERALITY ABOUT HOW MANY ME    

00:37:29.828 --> 00:37:33.296
ABOUT IT WAS A IT WAS JUST A    
GENERALITY ABOUT HOW MANY ME    
LOTS DO WE HAVE IN THE CITY?    

00:37:33.298 --> 00:37:34.230
GENERALITY ABOUT HOW MANY ME    
LOTS DO WE HAVE IN THE CITY?    
BUT IF YOU HAVE A               

00:37:34.232 --> 00:37:37.500
LOTS DO WE HAVE IN THE CITY?    
BUT IF YOU HAVE A               
NON-PERFORMING LOT IT DOESN'T   

00:37:37.502 --> 00:37:38.234
BUT IF YOU HAVE A               
NON-PERFORMING LOT IT DOESN'T   
NECESSARILY MEAN YOU IF IF YOU  

00:37:38.236 --> 00:37:39.034
NON-PERFORMING LOT IT DOESN'T   
NECESSARILY MEAN YOU IF IF YOU  
CAN STILL MEET ALL THE          

00:37:39.036 --> 00:37:39.669
NECESSARILY MEAN YOU IF IF YOU  
CAN STILL MEET ALL THE          
REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER FIFTY   

00:37:39.671 --> 00:37:44.340
CAN STILL MEET ALL THE          
REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER FIFTY   
FIVE YOU CAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO  

00:37:44.342 --> 00:37:47.276
REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER FIFTY   
FIVE YOU CAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO  
HAVE ZIBA UNLESS YOU'RE IN OUR  

00:37:47.278 --> 00:37:47.676
FIVE YOU CAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO  
HAVE ZIBA UNLESS YOU'RE IN OUR  
FORESE LOT.                     

00:37:47.678 --> 00:37:50.947
HAVE ZIBA UNLESS YOU'RE IN OUR  
FORESE LOT.                     
I'M A RECOGNIZED COMMISSIONER   

00:37:50.949 --> 00:37:54.717
FORESE LOT.                     
I'M A RECOGNIZED COMMISSIONER   
NORTEN FOR A MOMENT.            

00:37:54.719 --> 00:37:55.684
I'M A RECOGNIZED COMMISSIONER   
NORTEN FOR A MOMENT.            
I THINK THE POINT IS YOU CAN    

00:37:55.686 --> 00:37:58.721
NORTEN FOR A MOMENT.            
I THINK THE POINT IS YOU CAN    
HAVE A CONFORMING STRUCTURE,    

00:37:58.723 --> 00:37:59.589
I THINK THE POINT IS YOU CAN    
HAVE A CONFORMING STRUCTURE,    
YOU CAN HAVE A CONFORMING       

00:37:59.591 --> 00:38:02.459
HAVE A CONFORMING STRUCTURE,    
YOU CAN HAVE A CONFORMING       
STRUCTURE ON A NON CONFORMING.  

00:38:02.461 --> 00:38:03.393
YOU CAN HAVE A CONFORMING       
STRUCTURE ON A NON CONFORMING.  
THAT'S CORRECT BECAUSE THE NON  

00:38:03.395 --> 00:38:04.093
STRUCTURE ON A NON CONFORMING.  
THAT'S CORRECT BECAUSE THE NON  
DEFINITION NONCONFORMING LOT    

00:38:04.095 --> 00:38:06.962
THAT'S CORRECT BECAUSE THE NON  
DEFINITION NONCONFORMING LOT    
ALLOWS FOR FOR CERTAIN KINDS    

00:38:06.964 --> 00:38:07.697
DEFINITION NONCONFORMING LOT    
ALLOWS FOR FOR CERTAIN KINDS    
OF STRUCTURES SINGLE FAMILY     

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:11.000
ALLOWS FOR FOR CERTAIN KINDS    
OF STRUCTURES SINGLE FAMILY     
STRUCTURES SO THAT'S WHY        

00:38:11.002 --> 00:38:11.500
OF STRUCTURES SINGLE FAMILY     
STRUCTURES SO THAT'S WHY        
THEY'RE SEPARATE.               

00:38:11.502 --> 00:38:14.003
STRUCTURES SO THAT'S WHY        
THEY'RE SEPARATE.               
SO THE DATA THE TABLE WAS       

00:38:14.005 --> 00:38:14.803
THEY'RE SEPARATE.               
SO THE DATA THE TABLE WAS       
SHOWING WE HAVE GOBS            

00:38:14.805 --> 00:38:18.841
SO THE DATA THE TABLE WAS       
SHOWING WE HAVE GOBS            
OF NONCONFORMING LOTS WHICH     

00:38:18.843 --> 00:38:19.476
SHOWING WE HAVE GOBS            
OF NONCONFORMING LOTS WHICH     
REALLY SUGGESTS WE NEED TO      

00:38:19.478 --> 00:38:21.410
OF NONCONFORMING LOTS WHICH     
REALLY SUGGESTS WE NEED TO      
CHANGE THE ZONING BUT THAT'S A  

00:38:21.412 --> 00:38:21.945
REALLY SUGGESTS WE NEED TO      
CHANGE THE ZONING BUT THAT'S A  
SEPARATE ISSUE.                 

00:38:21.947 --> 00:38:22.811
CHANGE THE ZONING BUT THAT'S A  
SEPARATE ISSUE.                 
THIS IS JUST DEALING WITH IF    

00:38:22.813 --> 00:38:25.915
SEPARATE ISSUE.                 
THIS IS JUST DEALING WITH IF    
YOU HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT YOU   

00:38:25.917 --> 00:38:26.782
THIS IS JUST DEALING WITH IF    
YOU HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT YOU   
WANT TO SOMEHOW CHANGE AND IT   

00:38:26.784 --> 00:38:30.319
YOU HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT YOU   
WANT TO SOMEHOW CHANGE AND IT   
COULD BE ON A NON CONFORMING    

00:38:30.321 --> 00:38:31.054
WANT TO SOMEHOW CHANGE AND IT   
COULD BE ON A NON CONFORMING    
LOT DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS   

00:38:31.056 --> 00:38:33.756
COULD BE ON A NON CONFORMING    
LOT DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS   
YOU'RE STILL COMPLYING WITH     

00:38:33.758 --> 00:38:34.523
LOT DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS   
YOU'RE STILL COMPLYING WITH     
WHAT YOU COULD DO OTHERWISE     

00:38:34.525 --> 00:38:37.960
YOU'RE STILL COMPLYING WITH     
WHAT YOU COULD DO OTHERWISE     
CORRECT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS 

00:38:37.962 --> 00:38:38.627
WHAT YOU COULD DO OTHERWISE     
CORRECT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS 
YOU CAN GET APPROVAL.           

00:38:38.629 --> 00:38:39.362
CORRECT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS 
YOU CAN GET APPROVAL.           
SO REALLY THE QUESTION IS       

00:38:39.364 --> 00:38:41.063
YOU CAN GET APPROVAL.           
SO REALLY THE QUESTION IS       
BOILING DOWN TO WHO WHO'S GOING

IT WAS DRAFTED ORIGINALLY.      
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME     
JUST STRICTLY FOR LEGAL         

01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:56.737
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME     
JUST STRICTLY FOR LEGAL

01:09:56.739 --> 01:09:58.038
JUST STRICTLY FOR LEGAL         
DRAFTING.                       
COULD WE PLAY WITH THIS MORE    

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.242
DRAFTING.                       
COULD WE PLAY WITH THIS MORE    
BEFORE CURRENT FORWARD AND I'M  

01:10:01.244 --> 01:10:03.578
COULD WE PLAY WITH THIS MORE    
BEFORE CURRENT FORWARD AND I'M  
HAPPY TO GIVE YOU SOME THOUGHTS 

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:04.712
BEFORE CURRENT FORWARD AND I'M  
HAPPY TO GIVE YOU SOME THOUGHTS 
ON WHY I THINK IT'S PRETTY SURE 

01:10:04.714 --> 01:10:08.382
HAPPY TO GIVE YOU SOME THOUGHTS 
ON WHY I THINK IT'S PRETTY SURE 
WHAT WE COULD DO IS WE COULD    

01:10:08.384 --> 01:10:12.787
ON WHY I THINK IT'S PRETTY SURE 
WHAT WE COULD DO IS WE COULD    
ACTUALLY READ YOUR CALENDAR IS  

01:10:12.789 --> 01:10:13.588
WHAT WE COULD DO IS WE COULD    
ACTUALLY READ YOUR CALENDAR IS

01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:20.495
ACTUALLY READ YOUR CALENDAR IS  
COMING UP ON THIS AGENDA.       
SO I HAD TO THINK ABOUT         

01:10:22.364 --> 01:10:30.204
                        SO WE   
COULD POSTPONE THIS FOR EXAMPLE 
FOR A VOTE AND FEBRUARY 2ND     

01:10:30.206 --> 01:10:30.938
COULD POSTPONE THIS FOR EXAMPLE 
FOR A VOTE AND FEBRUARY 2ND     
MEETING IN FEBRUARY OR          

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:34.375
FOR A VOTE AND FEBRUARY 2ND     
MEETING IN FEBRUARY OR          
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES AND 

01:10:34.377 --> 01:10:35.109
MEETING IN FEBRUARY OR          
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES AND 
SCHEDULE FOR A WORKING SESSION  

01:10:35.111 --> 01:10:38.512
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES AND 
SCHEDULE FOR A WORKING SESSION  
IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN         

01:10:38.514 --> 01:10:39.179
SCHEDULE FOR A WORKING SESSION  
IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN         
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES     

01:10:39.181 --> 01:10:42.616
IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN         
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES     
MAKE SURE TO BRING IT BACK TO   

01:10:42.618 --> 01:10:43.284
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES     
MAKE SURE TO BRING IT BACK TO   
WORKING SESSION FOR IT TOTALLY  

01:10:43.286 --> 01:10:46.119
MAKE SURE TO BRING IT BACK TO   
WORKING SESSION FOR IT TOTALLY  
GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO    

01:10:46.121 --> 01:10:47.154
WORKING SESSION FOR IT TOTALLY  
GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO    
AND I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO  

01:10:47.156 --> 01:10:47.821
GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

01:10:47.823 --> 01:10:50.491

BUT THE WAY THIS IS DRAFTED IS  

01:10:50.493 --> 01:10:53.393
HAVE THESE CRITERIA LISTED.     
BUT THE WAY THIS IS DRAFTED IS  
JUST HARD TO FOLLOW IN PART     

01:10:53.395 --> 01:10:54.328
BUT THE WAY THIS IS DRAFTED IS  
JUST HARD TO FOLLOW IN PART     
OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT   

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:54.862
JUST HARD TO FOLLOW IN PART     
OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT   
WAS DRAFTED ORIGINALLY          

01:10:54.864 --> 01:10:57.865
OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT   
WAS DRAFTED ORIGINALLY          
COMMISSIONER?                   

01:10:57.867 --> 01:10:59.132
WAS DRAFTED ORIGINALLY          
COMMISSIONER?                   
WELL, WE'VE WE'VE HAD A WORKING 

01:10:59.134 --> 01:11:02.703
COMMISSIONER?                   
WELL, WE'VE WE'VE HAD A WORKING 
SESSION RIGHT ON IT WHICH WAS   

01:11:02.705 --> 01:11:05.005
WELL, WE'VE WE'VE HAD A WORKING 
SESSION RIGHT ON IT WHICH WAS   
EXTENSIVE.                      

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:09.810
SESSION RIGHT ON IT WHICH WAS   
EXTENSIVE.                      
I THINK THE CONCERNS ARE CLEAR  

01:11:09.812 --> 01:11:10.043
EXTENSIVE.                      
I THINK THE CONCERNS ARE CLEAR

WE'VE RAISED A CONCERN THAT THE 
FIRST POINT IS ACTUALLY         

01:11:14.017 --> 01:11:17.351
WE'VE RAISED A CONCERN THAT THE 
FIRST POINT IS ACTUALLY         
CREATING SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT  

01:11:17.353 --> 01:11:18.185
FIRST POINT IS ACTUALLY         
CREATING SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT  
IT DOESN'T INTEND AND THAT'S    

01:11:18.187 --> 01:11:21.656
CREATING SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT  
IT DOESN'T INTEND AND THAT'S    
GOING TO BE CORRECTED.          

01:11:21.658 --> 01:11:22.390
IT DOESN'T INTEND AND THAT'S    
GOING TO BE CORRECTED.          
THE ALTERATION DOES NOT CREATE  

01:11:22.392 --> 01:11:25.626
GOING TO BE CORRECTED.          
THE ALTERATION DOES NOT CREATE  
A NEW NONCONFORMITY ON THE LOT  

01:11:25.628 --> 01:11:28.930
THE ALTERATION DOES NOT CREATE  
A NEW NONCONFORMITY ON THE LOT  
OR AN ADJACENT LOT.             

01:11:28.932 --> 01:11:30.064
A NEW NONCONFORMITY ON THE LOT

IS THERE ANYTHING UNCLEAR ABOUT 

01:11:30.066 --> 01:11:33.701

THAT DOES NOT CREATE A NEW      
NONCONFORMITY SO I COULDN'T     

01:11:36.639 --> 01:11:40.007
THAT DOES NOT CREATE A NEW      
NONCONFORMITY SO I COULDN'T     
WELL NO, I'M NOT GOING TO TRY   

01:11:40.009 --> 01:11:41.175
NONCONFORMITY SO I COULDN'T     
WELL NO, I'M NOT GOING TO TRY   
AS I CAN DO THOSE CASES.        

01:11:41.177 --> 01:11:44.077
WELL NO, I'M NOT GOING TO TRY   
AS I CAN DO THOSE CASES.        
THAT'S THAT'S JOHN.

THAT MIGHT NOT BE EASY FOR A
