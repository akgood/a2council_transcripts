00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:56.851
I&apos;M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT IT AS 
IF IT WAS JUST BRICK RIGHT.     
LIKE IF THIS GETS APPROVED THEN 

00:25:56.853 --> 00:25:57.786
IF IT WAS JUST BRICK RIGHT.     
LIKE IF THIS GETS APPROVED THEN 
THEY CAN TEAR THIS DOWN AND     

00:25:57.788 --> 00:25:58.487
LIKE IF THIS GETS APPROVED THEN 
THEY CAN TEAR THIS DOWN AND     
JUST EXTEND THE HOUSE OR MAYBE  

00:25:58.489 --> 00:25:59.988
THEY CAN TEAR THIS DOWN AND     
JUST EXTEND THE HOUSE OR MAYBE  
NOT THEN BUT THE NEXT OWNERS    

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.922
JUST EXTEND THE HOUSE OR MAYBE  
NOT THEN BUT THE NEXT OWNERS    
THAT MAKING IT A SUN ROOM       

00:26:00.924 --> 00:26:01.190

THAT MAKING IT A SUN ROOM       
FOREVER.                        
SO IF THE IDEA IS USING YOUR    

00:26:04.294 --> 00:26:07.929
FOREVER.
