ORIGINAL PROPOSAL BUT GOT ADDED 
AS THEY WERE HAVING THESE       

00:28:40.656 --> 00:28:42.589
ORIGINAL PROPOSAL BUT GOT ADDED 
AS THEY WERE HAVING THESE       
PRELIMINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH  

00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:42.989
AS THEY WERE HAVING THESE       
PRELIMINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH  
PEOPLE.                         

00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:46.893
PRELIMINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH  
PEOPLE.

00:28:46.895 --> 00:28:47.761
PEOPLE.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I DO THINK THAT THEY      
DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT OF FEEDBACK   

00:28:47.763 --> 00:28:48.694
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I DO THINK THAT THEY      
DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT OF FEEDBACK   
FOR ME ON HOW THOSE ARE GOING   

00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:51.764
DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT OF FEEDBACK

BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING 

00:29:02.411 --> 00:29:03.076
WOULD LIKE REGULAR UPDATES ON   
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING 
THAT ONLY HAS SPACE FOR 12      

00:29:03.078 --> 00:29:06.379
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING 
THAT ONLY HAS SPACE FOR 12      
PEOPLE TO REGISTER FOR, YOU     

00:29:06.381 --> 00:29:07.047

TWELVE PEOPLE TO BE THERE AND   
AND TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK AND AND 

00:29:13.655 --> 00:29:14.454
