00:32:40.889 --> 00:32:41.521
AND SO I MEAN THIS IS NOT TO    
SAY LIKE WE RUSH INTO IT BUT AT 
LEAST FROM A TRANSPORTATION     

00:32:41.523 --> 00:32:44.524
SAY LIKE WE RUSH INTO IT BUT AT 
LEAST FROM A TRANSPORTATION     
STANDPOINT THINK ABOUT          

00:32:44.526 --> 00:32:45.258
LEAST FROM A TRANSPORTATION     
STANDPOINT THINK ABOUT          
POTENTIAL CORRIDORS OR AREAS    

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.695
STANDPOINT THINK ABOUT          
POTENTIAL CORRIDORS OR AREAS    
THAT COULD UTILIZE LINEAR PARKS 

00:32:48.697 --> 00:32:52.065
POTENTIAL CORRIDORS OR AREAS    
THAT COULD UTILIZE LINEAR PARKS 
NOT ONLY AS EQUITABLE           

00:32:52.067 --> 00:32:56.169
THAT COULD UTILIZE LINEAR PARKS 
NOT ONLY AS EQUITABLE           
PEDESTRIAN WALKABLE AREA BUT    

00:32:56.171 --> 00:32:57.003
NOT ONLY AS EQUITABLE           
PEDESTRIAN WALKABLE AREA BUT    
THAT HELPS PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS   

00:32:57.005 --> 00:32:59.606
PEDESTRIAN WALKABLE AREA BUT    
THAT HELPS PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS   
TO RECREATION SO THE BASICALLY  

00:32:59.608 --> 00:33:03.877
THAT HELPS PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS   
TO RECREATION SO THE BASICALLY  
A STUDY OF THE POTENTIAL USE    

00:33:03.879 --> 00:33:07.280
TO RECREATION SO THE BASICALLY  
A STUDY OF THE POTENTIAL USE    
OF LINEAR PARKS AND SO ANYWAYS  

00:33:07.282 --> 00:33:08.181
A STUDY OF THE POTENTIAL USE    
OF LINEAR PARKS AND SO ANYWAYS  
I WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE     

00:33:08.183 --> 00:33:10.517
OF LINEAR PARKS AND SO ANYWAYS  
I WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE     
RADAR AND IT JUST WAS FROM      

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:14.220
I WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE     
RADAR AND IT JUST WAS FROM      
WALKING AND SEEING THAT MAP     

00:33:14.222 --> 00:33:15.154
RADAR AND IT JUST WAS FROM      
WALKING AND SEEING THAT MAP     
OF THE RADIAL ACCESS TO PARKS   

00:33:15.156 --> 00:33:18.759
WALKING AND SEEING THAT MAP     
OF THE RADIAL ACCESS TO PARKS   
AND SO I KNOW THE PARKS LIKE    

00:33:18.761 --> 00:33:19.292
OF THE RADIAL ACCESS TO PARKS   
AND SO I KNOW THE PARKS LIKE    
TAPPED OUT ALREADY.             

00:33:19.294 --> 00:33:21.561
AND SO I KNOW THE PARKS LIKE    
TAPPED OUT ALREADY.             
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF PARKS BUT THE  

00:33:21.563 --> 00:33:22.328
TAPPED OUT ALREADY.             
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF PARKS BUT THE  
USE OF LINEAR PARKS COULD BE    

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.665
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF PARKS BUT THE  
USE OF LINEAR PARKS COULD BE    
USEFUL I THINK FOR NOT ONLY     

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:26.366
USE OF LINEAR PARKS COULD BE    
USEFUL I THINK FOR NOT ONLY     
CREATING RECREATION BUT GETTING 

00:33:26.368 --> 00:33:29.769
USEFUL I THINK FOR NOT ONLY     
CREATING RECREATION BUT GETTING 
PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE WALKING 

00:33:29.771 --> 00:33:30.236
CREATING RECREATION BUT GETTING 
PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE WALKING 
IN AREAS.                       

00:33:30.238 --> 00:33:30.937
PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE WALKING 
IN AREAS.                       
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S IT FOR ME.            

00:33:30.939 --> 00:33:34.007
IN AREAS.                       
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S IT FOR ME.            
YEAH, ONE IF I COULD HELP       

00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.807
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S IT FOR ME.            
YEAH, ONE IF I COULD HELP       
UNPACK THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN   

00:33:34.809 --> 00:33:38.077
YEAH, ONE IF I COULD HELP       
UNPACK THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN   
YOU SAY A STUDY I JUST WANT TO  

00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:41.247
UNPACK THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN   
YOU SAY A STUDY I JUST WANT TO  
CLARIFY WHAT YOUR EXPECTATION   

00:33:41.249 --> 00:33:42.381
YOU SAY A STUDY I JUST WANT TO  
CLARIFY WHAT YOUR EXPECTATION   
IS ON THAT SO AND AND AGAIN IF  

00:33:42.383 --> 00:33:46.119
CLARIFY WHAT YOUR EXPECTATION   
IS ON THAT SO AND AND AGAIN IF  
THE IDEA IS TO INITIATE A STUDY 

00:33:46.121 --> 00:33:46.853
IS ON THAT SO AND AND AGAIN IF  
THE IDEA IS TO INITIATE A STUDY 
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD POLICY     

00:33:46.855 --> 00:33:49.756
THE IDEA IS TO INITIATE A STUDY 
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD POLICY     
AGENDA RECOMMENDATION THE IDEA  

00:33:49.758 --> 00:33:50.723
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD POLICY     
AGENDA RECOMMENDATION THE IDEA  
IS TO GET LIKE AN UPDATE FROM   

00:33:50.725 --> 00:33:54.160
AGENDA RECOMMENDATION THE IDEA  
IS TO GET LIKE AN UPDATE FROM   
PARKS OR YOU MAY RECALL A       

00:33:54.162 --> 00:33:54.861
IS TO GET LIKE AN UPDATE FROM   
PARKS OR YOU MAY RECALL A       
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WE GOT AN  

00:33:54.863 --> 00:33:55.561
PARKS OR YOU MAY RECALL A       
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WE GOT AN  
UPDATE FROM THE TREE LINE       

00:33:55.563 --> 00:33:57.530
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WE GOT AN  
UPDATE FROM THE TREE LINE       
CONSERVANCY.                    

00:33:57.532 --> 00:33:58.465
UPDATE FROM THE TREE LINE       
CONSERVANCY.                    
I THINK THAT COULD BE SOMETHING 

00:33:58.467 --> 00:33:59.265
CONSERVANCY.                    
I THINK THAT COULD BE SOMETHING 
I CAN EASILY PROGRAM BECAUSE I  

00:33:59.267 --> 00:34:01.934
I THINK THAT COULD BE SOMETHING 
I CAN EASILY PROGRAM BECAUSE I  
HAVE A RESOURCE THAT I CAN      

00:34:01.936 --> 00:34:02.235
I CAN EASILY PROGRAM BECAUSE I  
HAVE A RESOURCE THAT I CAN      
PRESENT.                        

00:34:02.237 --> 00:34:02.902
HAVE A RESOURCE THAT I CAN      
PRESENT.                        
BUT IF IT&apos;S TALKING ABOUT       

00:34:02.904 --> 00:34:05.771
PRESENT.                        
BUT IF IT&apos;S TALKING ABOUT       
DEVELOPING A NEW REPORT OR NEW  

00:34:05.773 --> 00:34:06.573
BUT IF IT&apos;S TALKING ABOUT       
DEVELOPING A NEW REPORT OR NEW  
STUDY AND WE DON&apos;T HAVE FUNDING 

00:34:06.575 --> 00:34:07.340
DEVELOPING A NEW REPORT OR NEW  
STUDY AND WE DON&apos;T HAVE FUNDING 
AND WE DON&apos;T HAVE THE CAPACITY  

00:34:07.342 --> 00:34:10.043
STUDY AND WE DON&apos;T HAVE FUNDING 
AND WE DON&apos;T HAVE THE CAPACITY  
TO DO THAT, THAT FEELS LIKE     

00:34:10.045 --> 00:34:10.710
AND WE DON&apos;T HAVE THE CAPACITY  
TO DO THAT, THAT FEELS LIKE     
THAT MIGHT TRANSITION MORE      

00:34:10.712 --> 00:34:13.813
TO DO THAT, THAT FEELS LIKE     
THAT MIGHT TRANSITION MORE      
TOWARDS ASKING COUNCIL OR       

00:34:13.815 --> 00:34:14.514
THAT MIGHT TRANSITION MORE      
TOWARDS ASKING COUNCIL OR       
SOMEONE TO PUT RESOURCES        

00:34:14.516 --> 00:34:14.848
TOWARDS ASKING COUNCIL OR       
SOMEONE TO PUT RESOURCES        
TOWARDS THAT.

SOMEONE TO PUT RESOURCES        
TOWARDS THAT.                   
SO I JUST WANT TO SURE I        

00:34:17.718 --> 00:34:18.351

UNDERSTAND IF WE SHOULD BE      
TALKING ABOUT IT HERE OR IF YOU 
THINK MAYBE THIS POLICY AGENDA

RESOURCES OR CONNECTIONS FOR, I 
MIGHT RECOMMEND THAT THE FALL   

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:37.236
RESOURCES OR CONNECTIONS FOR, I 
MIGHT RECOMMEND THAT THE FALL   
OF THE ROAD DIET OR ROAD        

00:34:37.238 --> 00:34:40.506
MIGHT RECOMMEND THAT THE FALL   
OF THE ROAD DIET OR ROAD        
RECONFIGURATION EFFORT THAT&apos;S   

00:34:40.508 --> 00:34:41.508
OF THE ROAD DIET OR ROAD        
RECONFIGURATION EFFORT THAT&apos;S   
WHAT WE&apos;RE STARTING TO GET INTO 

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:44.978
RECONFIGURATION EFFORT THAT&apos;S   
WHAT WE&apos;RE STARTING TO GET INTO 
IF THERE ARE ROAD DIETS DONE OR 

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.845
WHAT WE&apos;RE STARTING TO GET INTO 
IF THERE ARE ROAD DIETS DONE OR 
ROAD NARROWINGS DONE THAT COULD 

00:34:45.847 --> 00:34:48.581
IF THERE ARE ROAD DIETS DONE OR 
ROAD NARROWINGS DONE THAT COULD 
OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR       

00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:49.181
ROAD NARROWINGS DONE THAT COULD 
OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR       
LINEAR PARKS PERHAPS.           

00:34:49.183 --> 00:34:49.982
OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR       
LINEAR PARKS PERHAPS.           
YEAH, I LOVE THAT IDEA.         

00:34:49.984 --> 00:34:52.585
LINEAR PARKS PERHAPS.           
YEAH, I LOVE THAT IDEA.         
THANK FOR CLEARLY ARTICULATE    

00:34:52.587 --> 00:34:55.755
YEAH, I LOVE THAT IDEA.         
THANK FOR CLEARLY ARTICULATE    
WAS TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY HOW   

00:34:55.757 --> 00:34:56.623
THANK FOR CLEARLY ARTICULATE    
WAS TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY HOW   
CAN WE KIND OF HAVE MULTIPLE    

00:34:56.625 --> 00:35:00.426
WAS TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY HOW   
CAN WE KIND OF HAVE MULTIPLE    
PURPOSE FOR IF WE ARE TAKING    

00:35:00.428 --> 00:35:01.194
CAN WE KIND OF HAVE MULTIPLE    
PURPOSE FOR IF WE ARE TAKING    
AWAY FROM AUTO CENTRIC TOWARDS  

00:35:01.196 --> 00:35:04.597
PURPOSE FOR IF WE ARE TAKING    
AWAY FROM AUTO CENTRIC TOWARDS  
THAT I JUST STOP LOOKING AT     

00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:08.367
AWAY FROM AUTO CENTRIC TOWARDS  
THAT I JUST STOP LOOKING AT     
PHOTOS SO THEY JUST DID AN      

00:35:08.369 --> 00:35:12.004
THAT I JUST STOP LOOKING AT     
PHOTOS SO THEY JUST DID AN      
INCREDIBLE JOB WITH LINEAR      

00:35:12.006 --> 00:35:12.739
PHOTOS SO THEY JUST DID AN      
INCREDIBLE JOB WITH LINEAR      
PARKS AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF   

00:35:12.741 --> 00:35:15.808
INCREDIBLE JOB WITH LINEAR      
PARKS AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF   
YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR IT&apos;S NOT  

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:16.675
PARKS AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF   
YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR IT&apos;S NOT  
ONLY IS IT USED FOR PEDESTRIAN  

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:23.016
YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR IT&apos;S NOT  
ONLY IS IT USED FOR PEDESTRIAN  
BUT IT&apos;S ALSO RECREATION        

00:35:36.864 --> 00:35:38.698
                         AND    
ACCESS TO KIND OF LIKE GREEN    
TREES AND THINGS OF THAT        

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.098
ACCESS TO KIND OF LIKE GREEN    
TREES AND THINGS OF THAT        
NATURE.                         

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:39.833
TREES AND THINGS OF THAT        
NATURE.                         
SO SO YEAH MORE I GUESS THE     

00:35:39.835 --> 00:35:40.433
NATURE.                         
SO SO YEAH MORE I GUESS THE     
POLICY SIDE NOT LOOKING FOR A   

00:35:40.435 --> 00:35:41.233
SO SO YEAH MORE I GUESS THE     
POLICY SIDE NOT LOOKING FOR A   
CONSULTANT STUDY THIS BUT JUST  

00:35:41.235 --> 00:35:42.034
POLICY SIDE NOT LOOKING FOR A   
CONSULTANT STUDY THIS BUT JUST  
PUTTING IT ON YOUR RADAR THAT I 

00:35:42.036 --> 00:35:42.702
CONSULTANT STUDY THIS BUT JUST  
PUTTING IT ON YOUR RADAR THAT I 
THINK WE COULD KNOCK OUT A FEW  

00:35:42.704 --> 00:35:43.502
PUTTING IT ON YOUR RADAR THAT I 
THINK WE COULD KNOCK OUT A FEW  
DIFFERENT STONES WITH OR NOT    

00:35:43.504 --> 00:35:44.170
THINK WE COULD KNOCK OUT A FEW  
DIFFERENT STONES WITH OR NOT    
KNOCK OUT A FEW DIFFERENT BIRDS 

00:35:44.172 --> 00:35:44.770
DIFFERENT STONES WITH OR NOT    
KNOCK OUT A FEW DIFFERENT BIRDS 
WITH ONE STONE KIND.            

00:35:44.772 --> 00:35:45.438
KNOCK OUT A FEW DIFFERENT BIRDS 
WITH ONE STONE KIND.            
SO AND I THINK ONE OTHER ASPECT 

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.306
WITH ONE STONE KIND.            
SO AND I THINK ONE OTHER ASPECT 
OF THAT COULD BE THE DISCUSSION 

00:35:46.308 --> 00:35:47.340
SO AND I THINK ONE OTHER ASPECT 
OF THAT COULD BE THE DISCUSSION 
OF PEDESTRIANISM ROADS IN THE   

00:35:47.342 --> 00:35:48.008
OF THAT COULD BE THE DISCUSSION 
OF PEDESTRIANISM ROADS IN THE   
DOWNTOWN CORE WHICH I THINK     

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.310
OF PEDESTRIANISM ROADS IN THE   
DOWNTOWN CORE WHICH I THINK     
COULD BE A FALLOUT FROM THE     

00:35:51.312 --> 00:35:51.945
DOWNTOWN CORE WHICH I THINK     
COULD BE A FALLOUT FROM THE     
DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION&apos;S STUDY.   

00:35:51.947 --> 00:35:54.781
COULD BE A FALLOUT FROM THE     
DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION&apos;S STUDY.   
THERE COULD BE RECOMMENDATIONS  

00:35:54.783 --> 00:35:55.548
DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION&apos;S STUDY.   
THERE COULD BE RECOMMENDATIONS  
PEDESTRIAN ISING CERTAIN BLOCKS 

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.119
THERE COULD BE RECOMMENDATIONS  
PEDESTRIAN ISING CERTAIN BLOCKS 
WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED A     

00:35:59.121 --> 00:35:59.519
PEDESTRIAN ISING CERTAIN BLOCKS 
WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED A     
LINEAR PARK.                    

00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:03.089
WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED A     
LINEAR PARK.                    
SO THAT KIND OF GOES TOGETHER.  

00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:04.023
LINEAR PARK.                    
SO THAT KIND OF GOES TOGETHER.  
I THINK THAT BEFORE I FORGET    

00:36:04.025 --> 00:36:06.859
SO THAT KIND OF GOES TOGETHER.  
I THINK THAT BEFORE I FORGET    
THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER AGENDA    

00:36:06.861 --> 00:36:07.226
I THINK THAT BEFORE I FORGET    
THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER AGENDA    
ITEM.                           

00:36:07.228 --> 00:36:07.827
THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER AGENDA    
ITEM.                           
THE DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION&apos;S      

00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:10.729
ITEM.                           
THE DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION&apos;S      
STUDY RESULTS I DON&apos;T KNOW IF   

00:36:10.731 --> 00:36:11.498
THE DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION&apos;S      
STUDY RESULTS I DON&apos;T KNOW IF   
YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHEN SUMMER OR 

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.500
STUDY RESULTS I DON&apos;T KNOW IF   
YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHEN SUMMER OR 
FALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I&apos;M 

00:36:14.502 --> 00:36:15.367
YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHEN SUMMER OR 
FALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I&apos;M 
SURE WILL BE A GOOD AGENDA      

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:17.937
FALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I&apos;M 
SURE WILL BE A GOOD AGENDA      
TOPIC.                          

00:36:17.939 --> 00:36:22.074

00:36:25.346 --> 00:36:26.212
THANKS, RAYMOND.                
I THINK LAST MONTH WE HAD       
FLOATED THE IDEA OF ADDING BUS  

00:36:26.214 --> 00:36:28.848
I THINK LAST MONTH WE HAD       
FLOATED THE IDEA OF ADDING BUS  
LANES TO THE WORK PLAN BUT I    

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:29.783
FLOATED THE IDEA OF ADDING BUS

THAT BECAUSE IT SORT OF HELPS   

00:59:31.498 --> 00:59:34.866
BUS TRACKING SYSTEM AND I LIKE  
THAT BECAUSE IT SORT OF HELPS   
OUT WHEN WE HAVE SERVICE THAT   

00:59:34.868 --> 00:59:35.567
THAT BECAUSE IT SORT OF HELPS   
OUT WHEN WE HAVE SERVICE THAT   
ISN&apos;T TOO FREQUENT BEING ABLE   

00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:39.137
OUT WHEN WE HAVE SERVICE THAT   
ISN&apos;T TOO FREQUENT BEING ABLE   
TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THE BUS IS

01:16:00.253 --> 01:16:01.485
ALSO AFFECTS HOW LIGHT IT IS    
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.           
&gt;&gt; IT IS A FIELD CORRECT ME IF  

01:16:01.487 --> 01:16:03.754
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.           
&gt;&gt; IT IS A FIELD CORRECT ME IF  
I&apos;M WRONG BOTH CYNTHY AND I&apos;M   

01:16:03.756 --> 01:16:04.655
&gt;&gt; IT IS A FIELD CORRECT ME IF  
I&apos;M WRONG BOTH CYNTHY AND I&apos;M   
SURE THAT IT IS A FIELD ON THE  

01:16:04.657 --> 01:16:06.791
I&apos;M WRONG BOTH CYNTHY AND I&apos;M   
SURE THAT IT IS A FIELD ON THE  
TEN BUT AGAIN THE CONSISTENCY   

01:16:06.793 --> 01:16:07.658
SURE THAT IT IS A FIELD ON THE  
TEN BUT AGAIN THE CONSISTENCY   
WITH WHICH THAT&apos;S REPORTED OUT  

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.794
TEN BUT AGAIN THE CONSISTENCY   
WITH WHICH THAT&apos;S REPORTED OUT  
MIGHT FLUCTUATE AS WELL.        

01:16:10.796 --> 01:16:11.729
WITH WHICH THAT&apos;S REPORTED OUT  
MIGHT FLUCTUATE AS WELL.        
&gt;&gt; SO LIGHTING CONDITIONS IN    

01:16:11.731 --> 01:16:14.865
MIGHT FLUCTUATE AS WELL.        
&gt;&gt; SO LIGHTING CONDITIONS IN    
OTHER WORDS THE LIGHTING        

01:16:14.867 --> 01:16:15.499
&gt;&gt; SO LIGHTING CONDITIONS IN    
OTHER WORDS THE LIGHTING        
CONDITIONS ARE TYPICALLY        

01:16:15.501 --> 01:16:18.969
OTHER WORDS THE LIGHTING        
CONDITIONS ARE TYPICALLY        
RECORDED.                       

01:16:18.971 --> 01:16:20.304
CONDITIONS ARE TYPICALLY        
RECORDED.                       
&gt;&gt; SO THAT DOES TEND TO BE A    

01:16:20.306 --> 01:16:23.140
RECORDED.                       
&gt;&gt; SO THAT DOES TEND TO BE A    
PRETTY PRETTY STABLE CONDITION. 

01:16:23.142 --> 01:16:27.011
&gt;&gt; SO THAT DOES TEND TO BE A    
PRETTY PRETTY STABLE CONDITION. 
BUT AS YOU SAID IN VERSUS TIME  

01:16:27.013 --> 01:16:31.047
PRETTY PRETTY STABLE CONDITION. 
BUT AS YOU SAID IN VERSUS TIME  
A DAY WITH THE GAS SMALLER DATA 

01:16:31.049 --> 01:16:32.149
BUT AS YOU SAID IN VERSUS TIME  
A DAY WITH THE GAS SMALLER DATA 
SET TRENDS ARE A LITTLE BIT     

01:16:32.151 --> 01:16:37.788
A DAY WITH THE GAS SMALLER DATA 
SET TRENDS ARE A LITTLE BIT     
OF TIME MOLIK.                  

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:38.856
SET TRENDS ARE A LITTLE BIT     
OF TIME MOLIK.                  
BUT JUST BECAUSE I REMEMBER WE  

01:16:38.858 --> 01:16:42.058
OF TIME MOLIK.                  
BUT JUST BECAUSE I REMEMBER WE  
DUG INTO TIME TO THE LIGHTING   

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:42.893
BUT JUST BECAUSE I REMEMBER WE  
DUG INTO TIME TO THE LIGHTING   
CONDITIONS IN PAST YEARS AND    

01:16:42.895 --> 01:16:43.527
DUG INTO TIME TO THE LIGHTING   
CONDITIONS IN PAST YEARS AND    
HISTORICALLY MOST OF OUR        

01:16:43.529 --> 01:16:46.330
CONDITIONS IN PAST YEARS AND    
HISTORICALLY MOST OF OUR        
CRASHES ARE HAPPENING IN LIGHT  

01:16:46.332 --> 01:16:46.730
HISTORICALLY MOST OF OUR        
CRASHES ARE HAPPENING IN LIGHT  
CONDITIONS.                     

01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:49.733
CRASHES ARE HAPPENING IN LIGHT  
CONDITIONS.                     
SO I I DON&apos;T KNOW LIKE WHAT     

01:16:49.735 --> 01:16:50.801
CONDITIONS.                     
SO I I DON&apos;T KNOW LIKE WHAT     
THIS I HAVEN&apos;T DUG IN ON THIS   

01:16:50.803 --> 01:16:53.471
SO I I DON&apos;T KNOW LIKE WHAT     
THIS I HAVEN&apos;T DUG IN ON THIS   
YEAR BUT IN GENERAL IN THE PAST 

01:16:53.473 --> 01:16:54.205
THIS I HAVEN&apos;T DUG IN ON THIS   
YEAR BUT IN GENERAL IN THE PAST 
YEARS WE&apos;VE ACTUALLY NOT        

01:16:54.207 --> 01:16:57.441
YEAR BUT IN GENERAL IN THE PAST 
YEARS WE&apos;VE ACTUALLY NOT        
MATCHED THAT NATIONAL TREND AND 

01:16:57.443 --> 01:16:58.241
YEARS WE&apos;VE ACTUALLY NOT        
MATCHED THAT NATIONAL TREND AND 
MOST OF THE CRASHES HAVE BEEN   

01:16:58.243 --> 01:17:00.877
MATCHED THAT NATIONAL TREND AND 
MOST OF THE CRASHES HAVE BEEN   
DURING DAYLIGHT.                

01:17:00.879 --> 01:17:04.681
MOST OF THE CRASHES HAVE BEEN   
DURING DAYLIGHT.                
I THINK THE TRENDS ARE ALSO THE 

01:17:04.683 --> 01:17:05.582
DURING DAYLIGHT.                
I THINK THE TRENDS ARE ALSO THE 
MOST CRASHES ARE DAYLIGHT IN    

01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:05.850
I THINK THE TRENDS ARE ALSO THE 
MOST CRASHES ARE DAYLIGHT IN    
GENERAL.                        

01:17:05.852 --> 01:17:12.223
MOST CRASHES ARE DAYLIGHT IN    
GENERAL.                        
IT&apos;S JUST THE                   

01:17:25.671 --> 01:17:27.838
              INCREASE IN       
CRASHES OVERALL IN THE LAST     
COUPLE YEARS ACCORDING TO THAT  

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.906
CRASHES OVERALL IN THE LAST     
COUPLE YEARS ACCORDING TO THAT  
I THINK IS NEAR TIMES IS PRETTY 

01:17:28.908 --> 01:17:29.640
COUPLE YEARS ACCORDING TO THAT  
I THINK IS NEAR TIMES IS PRETTY 
MUCH ENTIRELY ACCOUNTED FOR AN  

01:17:29.642 --> 01:17:30.307
I THINK IS NEAR TIMES IS PRETTY 
MUCH ENTIRELY ACCOUNTED FOR AN  
INCREASE AT NIGHTTIME.          

01:17:30.309 --> 01:17:31.175
MUCH ENTIRELY ACCOUNTED FOR AN  
INCREASE AT NIGHTTIME.          
SO I JUST WASN&apos;T SURE IF THAT   

01:17:31.177 --> 01:17:31.975
INCREASE AT NIGHTTIME.          
SO I JUST WASN&apos;T SURE IF THAT   
WAS SOMETHING BUT YEAH, I WOULD 

01:17:31.977 --> 01:17:32.909
SO I JUST WASN&apos;T SURE IF THAT   
WAS SOMETHING BUT YEAH, I WOULD 
EXPECT THE MOST JUST BY RAW     

01:17:32.911 --> 01:17:33.744
WAS SOMETHING BUT YEAH, I WOULD 
EXPECT THE MOST JUST BY RAW     
NUMBER TO BE DURING THE DAY BUT 

01:17:33.746 --> 01:17:34.044
EXPECT THE MOST JUST BY RAW     
NUMBER TO BE DURING THE DAY BUT 
OK.                             

01:17:34.046 --> 01:17:34.711
NUMBER TO BE DURING THE DAY BUT 
OK.                             
&gt;&gt; YEAH AND FORTUNATELY THE     

01:17:34.713 --> 01:17:35.679
OK.                             
&gt;&gt; YEAH AND FORTUNATELY THE     
SAMPLE SIZE IS FAIRLY SMALL SO  

01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:38.849
&gt;&gt; YEAH AND FORTUNATELY THE     
SAMPLE SIZE IS FAIRLY SMALL SO  
IT&apos;S HARD TO MAKE CONCLUSIONS   

01:17:38.851 --> 01:17:39.784
SAMPLE SIZE IS FAIRLY SMALL SO  
IT&apos;S HARD TO MAKE CONCLUSIONS   
YEAR OVER YEAR HERE IN ANN      

01:17:39.786 --> 01:17:46.790
IT&apos;S HARD TO MAKE CONCLUSIONS

ABOUT TRENDS THOUGH IN ANN      
ARBOR IS THAT THE THE OVERALL   
TREND IS GOING SLIGHTLY DOWN IN

ARBOR IS THAT THE THE OVERALL   
TREND IS GOING SLIGHTLY DOWN IN 
A GOOD WAY.                     

01:18:30.602 --> 01:18:34.971
TREND IS GOING SLIGHTLY DOWN IN 
A GOOD WAY.                     
BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TAKE OUT  

01:18:34.973 --> 01:18:35.839
A GOOD WAY.                     
BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TAKE OUT  
MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES FROM THAT 

01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:39.109
BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TAKE OUT  
MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES FROM THAT 
YOU&apos;RE LOOKING AT SERIOUS,

COMES TO PEDESTRIANS AND        
BICYCLES WE ARE NOT DOING GOOD  
AT THIS POINT AT REDUCING THE

PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT THE        
CROSSWALK ON STADIUM AND WE ARE 
DOING A GOOD JOB I THINK        

01:58:23.993 --> 01:58:27.061
CROSSWALK ON STADIUM AND WE ARE 
DOING A GOOD JOB I THINK        
OF CATALOGING SIDEWALK APPS AND 

01:58:27.063 --> 01:58:30.698
DOING A GOOD JOB I THINK        
OF CATALOGING SIDEWALK APPS AND 
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE WE ALSO     

01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:35.002
OF CATALOGING SIDEWALK APPS AND 
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE WE ALSO     
NEED TO HAVE A BETTER PROCESS   

01:58:35.004 --> 01:58:41.109
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE WE ALSO

01:58:55.791 --> 01:58:58.826
               CROSSWALK APPS   
AND AFTER I SAW THE EMAIL THAT  
WE SENT ON THIS TOPIC AND I     

01:58:58.828 --> 01:58:59.461
AND AFTER I SAW THE EMAIL THAT  
WE SENT ON THIS TOPIC AND I     
CHECKED THE DISTANCE BETWEEN    

01:58:59.463 --> 01:59:00.328
WE SENT ON THIS TOPIC AND I     
CHECKED THE DISTANCE BETWEEN    
CROSSWALKS IN THAT AREA AND IT  

01:59:00.330 --> 01:59:00.995
CHECKED THE DISTANCE BETWEEN    
CROSSWALKS IN THAT AREA AND IT  
IS IT IS PRETTY BIG AND IT&apos;S    

01:59:00.997 --> 01:59:01.796
CROSSWALKS IN THAT AREA AND IT  
IS IT IS PRETTY BIG AND IT&apos;S    
MUCH FURTHER THAN THE STRETCH   

01:59:01.798 --> 01:59:02.464
IS IT IS PRETTY BIG AND IT&apos;S    
MUCH FURTHER THAN THE STRETCH   
OF STADIUM THAT&apos;S EAST          

01:59:02.466 --> 01:59:03.198
MUCH FURTHER THAN THE STRETCH   
OF STADIUM THAT&apos;S EAST          
OF PACARD, FOR EXAMPLE.         

01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:04.231
OF STADIUM THAT&apos;S EAST          
OF PACARD, FOR EXAMPLE.         
THERE&apos;S A COUPLE OF THEM THAT   

01:59:04.233 --> 01:59:04.966
OF PACARD, FOR EXAMPLE.         
THERE&apos;S A COUPLE OF THEM THAT   
ARE MUCH CLOSER AT CROSS        

01:59:04.968 --> 01:59:05.500
THERE&apos;S A COUPLE OF THEM THAT   
ARE MUCH CLOSER AT CROSS        
STREETS THERE.                  

01:59:05.502 --> 01:59:07.769
ARE MUCH CLOSER AT CROSS        
STREETS THERE.                  
SO I MEAN I AGREE THIS LOOKS    

01:59:07.771 --> 01:59:08.770
STREETS THERE.                  
SO I MEAN I AGREE THIS LOOKS    
LIKE A PLACE WHERE WE NEED A    

01:59:08.772 --> 01:59:09.637
SO I MEAN I AGREE THIS LOOKS    
LIKE A PLACE WHERE WE NEED A    
CROSSWALK BUT HOW DO WE HOW DO  

01:59:09.639 --> 01:59:12.907
LIKE A PLACE WHERE WE NEED A    
CROSSWALK BUT HOW DO WE HOW DO  
WE GET THAT PRIORITIZED?        

01:59:12.909 --> 01:59:14.241
CROSSWALK BUT HOW DO WE HOW DO  
WE GET THAT PRIORITIZED?

01:59:14.243 --> 01:59:14.942
WE GET THAT PRIORITIZED?        
HOW DO WE GET IT ON THE LIST    
AND HOW DO WE START CHIPPING    

01:59:14.944 --> 01:59:15.476
HOW DO WE GET IT ON THE LIST    
AND HOW DO WE START CHIPPING    
AWAY AT THAT LIST?

AWAY AT THAT LIST?

02:00:17.807 --> 02:00:21.576
NEEDED BUT THERE&apos;S AN ACTUAL    
ENGINEERING PROBLEM I BELIEVE   
BECAUSE THE SIDEWALKS FROM      

02:00:21.578 --> 02:00:25.246
ENGINEERING PROBLEM I BELIEVE   
BECAUSE THE SIDEWALKS FROM      
FERNDALE AND IROQUOIS BOTH HAVE 

02:00:25.248 --> 02:00:29.317
BECAUSE THE SIDEWALKS FROM

THERE ARE RAMPS THAT GUIDE      
PEOPLE FROM THE SIDEWALKS DOWN

02:00:40.296 --> 02:00:41.028
ONTO THE STADIUM BOULEVARD BUT  
THEN THERE&apos;S NO CROSSWALK SO I

REALLY THINK THAT&apos;S A PROBLEM   
FOR VISION IMPAIRED PEOPLE OR   

02:00:41.765 --> 02:00:44.598

ANYONE THAT&apos;S WALKING.          
AND THERE&apos;S HERE&apos;S A RAMP RIGHT 
DOWN ON THE STADIUM BOULEVARD   

02:00:49.038 --> 02:00:49.837
AND THERE&apos;S HERE&apos;S A RAMP RIGHT 
DOWN ON THE STADIUM BOULEVARD   
INVITING YOU RIGHT ONTO THE     

02:00:49.839 --> 02:00:50.171
DOWN ON THE STADIUM BOULEVARD   
INVITING YOU RIGHT ONTO THE

ROAD.                           
BUT THEN THERE&apos;S NO CROSSWALK.  
SO I&apos;VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT     

02:00:53.509 --> 02:00:53.975
BUT THEN THERE&apos;S NO CROSSWALK.  
SO I&apos;VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT     
THAT WAS A PROBLEM.             

02:00:53.977 --> 02:00:56.544
SO I&apos;VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT     
THAT WAS A PROBLEM.             
IT SEEMED LIKE MAYBE AT ONE     

02:00:56.546 --> 02:00:57.211
THAT WAS A PROBLEM.             
IT SEEMED LIKE MAYBE AT ONE     
POINT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD       

02:00:57.213 --> 02:00:57.679
IT SEEMED LIKE MAYBE AT ONE     
POINT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD       
INSTALL ONE.                    

02:00:57.681 --> 02:01:01.015
POINT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD       
INSTALL ONE.                    
SO LET&apos;S AT THE RAMPS IN PLACE  

02:01:01.017 --> 02:01:01.683
INSTALL ONE.                    
SO LET&apos;S AT THE RAMPS IN PLACE  
BUT THEN THE CROSSWALK WAS      

02:01:01.685 --> 02:01:02.149
SO LET&apos;S AT THE RAMPS IN PLACE  
BUT THEN THE CROSSWALK WAS      
NEVER INSTALLED.                

02:01:02.151 --> 02:01:04.886
BUT THEN THE CROSSWALK WAS      
NEVER INSTALLED.                
SO I DO SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM   

02:01:04.888 --> 02:01:05.687
NEVER INSTALLED.                
SO I DO SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM   
AND IT&apos;S BEEN THAT WAY FOR      

02:01:05.689 --> 02:01:08.823
SO I DO SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM   
AND IT&apos;S BEEN THAT WAY FOR

THE EAST SIDE OF PACARD THERE   
ARE AT LEAST ONE TO RFD.        
YOU KNOW THE ROAD I THINK IS    

02:01:23.906 --> 02:01:26.340
ARE AT LEAST ONE TO RFD.
