ALSO NO KIND OF RENEWAL         
OPPORTUNITY FOR CURRENT.        

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.474

01:12:07.658 --> 01:12:08.591
SHE DID WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TO MOVE THE   
DATE BACK THREE TIMES NOW SO I  
THINK IT JUST KIND OF FELL      

01:12:08.593 --> 01:12:09.192
DATE BACK THREE TIMES NOW SO I  
THINK IT JUST KIND OF FELL      
THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THIS

THINK IT JUST KIND OF FELL      
THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THIS      
PARTICULAR CASE.                

01:12:10.929 --> 01:12:11.994
THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THIS      
PARTICULAR CASE.                
BUT MOST OF THE TENANTS IN THE  

01:12:11.996 --> 01:12:12.862
PARTICULAR CASE.                
BUT MOST OF THE TENANTS IN THE  
BUILDING HAVE BEEN INFORMED AND 

01:12:12.864 --> 01:12:16.131
BUT MOST OF THE TENANTS IN THE

INTERSECTION SO DOWN AT THE     
BOTTOM OF BROADWAY WHERE THE    
BRIDGE IS NOW THAT IS TO BE THE

BOTTOM OF BROADWAY WHERE THE    
BRIDGE IS NOW THAT IS TO BE THE 
SPOT WHERE YOU WOULD FORWARD    

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:16.558
BRIDGE IS NOW THAT IS TO BE THE 
SPOT WHERE YOU WOULD FORWARD    
THE RIVER AND SO FOR THE FIRST  

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.763
SPOT WHERE YOU WOULD FORWARD    
THE RIVER AND SO FOR THE FIRST  
PROBABLY 40 OR 50 YEARS OF THE

THE RIVER AND SO FOR THE FIRST  
PROBABLY 40 OR 50 YEARS OF THE  
CITY THAT WAS A MEETING SPOT    

01:13:21.366 --> 01:13:23.265
PROBABLY 40 OR 50 YEARS OF THE  
CITY THAT WAS A MEETING SPOT    
AND THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE THE DEPOT CAME 

01:13:23.267 --> 01:13:23.465
CITY THAT WAS A MEETING SPOT    
AND THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE THE DEPOT CAME 
.                               

01:13:23.467 --> 01:13:24.666
AND THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE THE DEPOT CAME 
.                               
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT BECAME A   

01:13:24.668 --> 01:13:27.636
.                               
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT BECAME A   
IT BECAME A PLACE FIRST WHERE   

01:13:27.638 --> 01:13:31.273
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT BECAME A   
IT BECAME A PLACE FIRST WHERE   
THE NATIVE AMERICANS WERE WOULD 

01:13:31.275 --> 01:13:32.074
IT BECAME A PLACE FIRST WHERE   
THE NATIVE AMERICANS WERE WOULD 
MEET WITH WITH THE GERMAN       

01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:35.244
THE NATIVE AMERICANS WERE WOULD 
MEET WITH WITH THE GERMAN       
SETTLERS WHO WERE HERE AND THEN 

01:13:35.246 --> 01:13:35.978
MEET WITH WITH THE GERMAN       
SETTLERS WHO WERE HERE AND THEN 
LATER IT BECAME A MEETING PLACE 

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:39.181
SETTLERS WHO WERE HERE AND THEN 
LATER IT BECAME A MEETING PLACE 
FOR THE GERMAN SETTLERS.        

01:13:39.183 --> 01:13:43.985
LATER IT BECAME A MEETING PLACE 
FOR THE GERMAN SETTLERS.        
I I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE&amp;apos;S MUCH    

01:13:43.987 --> 01:13:44.754
FOR THE GERMAN SETTLERS.        
I I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE&amp;apos;S MUCH    
OF THAT LEFT SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SAY     

01:13:44.756 --> 01:13:46.822
I I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE&amp;apos;S MUCH    
OF THAT LEFT SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SAY     
THAT PRESERVING ANYTHING OF THE 

01:13:46.824 --> 01:13:47.489
OF THAT LEFT SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SAY     
THAT PRESERVING ANYTHING OF THE 
NATIVE HISTORY THERE IS NOT     

01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:50.493
THAT PRESERVING ANYTHING OF THE 
NATIVE HISTORY THERE IS NOT     
REALLY ANY NOW SAME FOR THE     

01:13:50.495 --> 01:13:51.026
NATIVE HISTORY THERE IS NOT     
REALLY ANY NOW SAME FOR THE     
BUILDING ITSELF.                

01:13:51.028 --> 01:13:51.827
REALLY ANY NOW SAME FOR THE     
BUILDING ITSELF.                
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS    

01:13:51.829 --> 01:13:54.864
BUILDING ITSELF.                
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS    
WAS ABLE TO GET A               

01:13:54.866 --> 01:13:58.334
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS    
WAS ABLE TO GET A               
NONCONTRIBUTING STATUS WAS      

01:13:58.336 --> 01:13:59.134
WAS ABLE TO GET A               
NONCONTRIBUTING STATUS WAS      
BECAUSE THERE IS LITERALLY NOT  

01:13:59.136 --> 01:13:59.935
NONCONTRIBUTING STATUS WAS      
BECAUSE THERE IS LITERALLY NOT  
ONE MATERIAL LEFT ON THE HOUSE. 

01:13:59.937 --> 01:14:01.671
BECAUSE THERE IS LITERALLY NOT  
ONE MATERIAL LEFT ON THE HOUSE. 
OTHER INCITING UNDER THREE      

01:14:01.673 --> 01:14:05.040
ONE MATERIAL LEFT ON THE HOUSE. 
OTHER INCITING UNDER THREE      
LAYERS OF OTHER SIDING THAT HAS 

01:14:05.042 --> 01:14:06.108
OTHER INCITING UNDER THREE      
LAYERS OF OTHER SIDING THAT HAS 
NO ABILITY TO BE SAVED ANYMORE. 

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:09.445
LAYERS OF OTHER SIDING THAT HAS 
NO ABILITY TO BE SAVED ANYMORE. 
THE REST OF IT IS TWO BUILDINGS 

01:14:09.447 --> 01:14:10.112
NO ABILITY TO BE SAVED ANYMORE. 
THE REST OF IT IS TWO BUILDINGS 
THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER.         

01:14:10.114 --> 01:14:10.913
THE REST OF IT IS TWO BUILDINGS 
THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER.         
IT&amp;apos;S NOT HISTORIC BECAUSE MORE  

01:14:10.915 --> 01:14:13.782
THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER.         
IT&amp;apos;S NOT HISTORIC BECAUSE MORE  
THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE OF THE   

01:14:13.784 --> 01:14:16.418
IT&amp;apos;S NOT HISTORIC BECAUSE MORE  
THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE OF THE   
BUILDING WAS MOVED THERE AND    

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.219
THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE OF THE   
BUILDING WAS MOVED THERE AND    
THE ONLY THING IN NINETEEN      

01:14:17.221 --> 01:14:17.953
BUILDING WAS MOVED THERE AND    
THE ONLY THING IN NINETEEN      
FORTY FOUR THAT YOU WOULD HAVE  

01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:21.256
THE ONLY THING IN NINETEEN      
FORTY FOUR THAT YOU WOULD HAVE  
WOULD BE THE MACING AND THE AGE 

01:14:21.258 --> 01:14:21.890
FORTY FOUR THAT YOU WOULD HAVE  
WOULD BE THE MACING AND THE AGE 
OF THE BUILDING WHICH THE       

01:14:21.892 --> 01:14:24.926
WOULD BE THE MACING AND THE AGE 
OF THE BUILDING WHICH THE       
SECRETARY OF THE INTERIORS      

01:14:24.928 --> 01:14:25.661
OF THE BUILDING WHICH THE       
SECRETARY OF THE INTERIORS      
GUIDELINE SAYS IS NOT IN AND    

01:14:25.663 --> 01:14:28.264
SECRETARY OF THE INTERIORS      
GUIDELINE SAYS IS NOT IN AND    
OF ITSELF ENOUGH TO CALL A      

01:14:28.266 --> 01:14:28.864
GUIDELINE SAYS IS NOT IN AND    
OF ITSELF ENOUGH TO CALL A      
BUILDING HISTORIC.              

01:14:28.866 --> 01:14:32.535
OF ITSELF ENOUGH TO CALL A      
BUILDING HISTORIC.              
SO WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN        

01:14:32.537 --> 01:14:33.335
BUILDING HISTORIC.              
SO WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN        
GETTING IT DELISTED AS A        

01:14:33.337 --> 01:14:36.572
SO WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN        
GETTING IT DELISTED AS A        
CONTRIBUTING RESOURCE AND FROM  

01:14:36.574 --> 01:14:41.243
GETTING IT DELISTED AS A        
CONTRIBUTING RESOURCE AND FROM  
THERE WE ARE JUST WE ARE KIND   

01:14:41.245 --> 01:14:44.279
CONTRIBUTING RESOURCE AND FROM  
THERE WE ARE JUST WE ARE KIND   
OF KEEPING THE ORIGINAL         

01:14:44.281 --> 01:14:45.014
THERE WE ARE JUST WE ARE KIND   
OF KEEPING THE ORIGINAL         
FOOTPRINT OF THE TWO HOUSES     

01:14:45.016 --> 01:14:45.881
OF KEEPING THE ORIGINAL         
FOOTPRINT OF THE TWO HOUSES     
THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER THERE IN 

01:14:45.883 --> 01:14:48.484
FOOTPRINT OF THE TWO HOUSES     
THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER THERE IN 
NINETEEN THIRTY AND AND THAT&amp;apos;S  

01:14:48.486 --> 01:14:49.418
THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER THERE IN 
NINETEEN THIRTY AND AND THAT&amp;apos;S  
WHY THE BACK OF IT IS MORE      

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.120
NINETEEN THIRTY AND AND THAT&amp;apos;S  
WHY THE BACK OF IT IS MORE      
MODERN IS TO TRY AND SORT       

01:14:52.122 --> 01:14:52.821
WHY THE BACK OF IT IS MORE      
MODERN IS TO TRY AND SORT       
OF WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE IN   

01:14:52.823 --> 01:14:55.924
MODERN IS TO TRY AND SORT       
OF WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE IN   
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND ESPECIALLY 

01:14:55.926 --> 01:14:56.659
OF WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE IN   
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND ESPECIALLY 
THE ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIANS    

01:14:56.661 --> 01:15:00.329
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND ESPECIALLY 
THE ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIANS    
THERE YOU KIND OF MAKE A HYPHEN 

01:15:00.331 --> 01:15:00.996
THE ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIANS    
THERE YOU KIND OF MAKE A HYPHEN 
AND A DIFFERENT LOOKING         

01:15:00.998 --> 01:15:04.300
THERE YOU KIND OF MAKE A HYPHEN 
AND A DIFFERENT LOOKING         
BUILDING IN THE BACK SO THAT IT 

01:15:04.302 --> 01:15:05.234
AND A DIFFERENT LOOKING         
BUILDING IN THE BACK SO THAT IT 
COULD SORT OF HAVE THE REMINDER 

01:15:05.236 --> 01:15:07.936
BUILDING IN THE BACK SO THAT IT 
COULD SORT OF HAVE THE REMINDER 
OF WHAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD USED   

01:15:07.938 --> 01:15:08.703
COULD SORT OF HAVE THE REMINDER 
OF WHAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD USED   
TO LOOK LIKE THE ROOFLINES WERE 

01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:11.640
OF WHAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD USED   
TO LOOK LIKE THE ROOFLINES WERE 
DESIGNED TO MATCH THE           

01:15:11.642 --> 01:15:12.040
TO LOOK LIKE THE ROOFLINES WERE 
DESIGNED TO MATCH THE           
STREETSCAPE.                    

01:15:12.042 --> 01:15:12.775
DESIGNED TO MATCH THE           
STREETSCAPE.                    
THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING      

01:15:12.777 --> 01:15:15.610
STREETSCAPE.                    
THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING      
RIGHT NOW IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER 

01:15:15.612 --> 01:15:16.578
THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING      
RIGHT NOW IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER 
THAN THE OTHER BUILDINGS ALL ON 

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.146
RIGHT NOW IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER 
THAN THE OTHER BUILDINGS ALL ON 
EITHER SIDE OF IT.              

01:15:17.148 --> 01:15:20.148
THAN THE OTHER BUILDINGS ALL ON 
EITHER SIDE OF IT.

STREET SAY IF THIS DESIGN       
DOESN&amp;apos;T GO FORWARD AND A NEW    

01:18:50.895 --> 01:18:54.296
STREET SAY IF THIS DESIGN       
DOESN&amp;apos;T GO FORWARD AND A NEW    
PLAN SHOWS UP THAT IT CAN&amp;apos;T BE  

01:18:54.298 --> 01:18:55.030

01:18:55.032 --> 01:18:57.566
PLAN SHOWS UP THAT IT CAN&amp;apos;T BE  
FURTHER THAN TWENTY FIVE FEET.  
SO PUTTING A STEP BACK MAX BOMB 

01:18:57.568 --> 01:18:58.266
FURTHER THAN TWENTY FIVE FEET.  
SO PUTTING A STEP BACK MAX BOMB 
CONTINUES TO ENCOURAGE AND      

01:18:58.268 --> 01:19:01.936
SO PUTTING A STEP BACK MAX BOMB

I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT THAT IS A     
MEASUREMENT THAT THE CITY WANTS 

01:39:52.021 --> 01:39:54.689
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT THAT IS A     
MEASUREMENT THAT THE CITY WANTS 
TO GET THE BUSINESS OF DOING    

01:39:54.691 --> 01:39:58.159

THAT REQUIRES AN ONGOING        
PERFORMANCE WHICH ANY STANDARD  
AROUND THAT ZERO OR LEAD TO MY  

01:40:15.044 --> 01:40:18.446
PERFORMANCE WHICH ANY STANDARD  
AROUND THAT ZERO OR LEAD TO MY

FEET IN CASE YOU KNOW THERE&amp;apos;S   
THERE&amp;apos;S ISSUES OUT THERE SO     

01:52:31.413 --> 01:52:32.045
FEET IN CASE YOU KNOW THERE&amp;apos;S   
THERE&amp;apos;S ISSUES OUT THERE SO     
YES, THERE&amp;apos;S FLEXIBILITY BUILT

THERE&amp;apos;S ISSUES OUT THERE SO     
YES, THERE&amp;apos;S FLEXIBILITY BUILT  
IN OK AND THEN IN THE UDC ARE   

01:52:35.918 --> 01:52:36.650
YES, THERE&amp;apos;S FLEXIBILITY BUILT  
IN OK AND THEN IN THE UDC ARE   
OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENT FOR OUR  

01:52:36.652 --> 01:52:39.519
IN OK AND THEN IN THE UDC ARE   
OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENT FOR OUR  
FORCES.                         

01:52:39.521 --> 01:52:40.720
OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENT FOR OUR  
FORCES.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT I BELIEVE IT WAS WHAT   

01:52:40.722 --> 01:52:44.024
FORCES.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT I BELIEVE IT WAS WHAT   
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT GIVE ME ONE 

01:52:44.026 --> 01:52:44.824
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT I BELIEVE IT WAS WHAT   
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT GIVE ME ONE 
SECOND HERE AND WE ARE          

01:52:44.826 --> 01:52:47.894
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT GIVE ME ONE 
SECOND HERE AND WE ARE          
ADJUSTING DOWN TO TWENTY THREE  

01:52:47.896 --> 01:52:51.230
SECOND HERE AND WE ARE          
ADJUSTING DOWN TO TWENTY THREE  
HERE IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY FORTY   

01:52:51.232 --> 01:52:52.065
ADJUSTING DOWN TO TWENTY THREE  
HERE IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY FORTY   
IT&amp;apos;S FORTY PERCENT YES.         

01:52:52.067 --> 01:52:55.836
HERE IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY FORTY   
IT&amp;apos;S FORTY PERCENT YES.         
SO YES WITH A COVER OF THE      

01:52:55.838 --> 01:52:59.572
IT&amp;apos;S FORTY PERCENT YES.         
SO YES WITH A COVER OF THE      
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE ON SITE THE  

01:52:59.574 --> 01:53:00.306
SO YES WITH A COVER OF THE      
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE ON SITE THE  
BUILDING AND THE CARPORT AND    

01:53:00.308 --> 01:53:00.640
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE ON SITE THE  
BUILDING AND THE CARPORT AND    
THE DRIVE.

BUILDING AND THE CARPORT AND    
THE DRIVE.                      
YES AND IN FACT I THINK IT&amp;apos;S    

01:53:02.377 --> 01:53:03.043
THE DRIVE.                      
YES AND IN FACT I THINK IT&amp;apos;S    
YES THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.

YES AND IN FACT I THINK IT&amp;apos;S    
YES THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.          
TWENTY THREE PERCENT OK AND     

01:53:06.382 --> 01:53:10.683
YES THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.          
TWENTY THREE PERCENT OK AND     
THEN WITH THE THE SET BACK SO   

01:53:10.685 --> 01:53:11.417
TWENTY THREE PERCENT OK AND     
THEN WITH THE THE SET BACK SO   
AGAIN IF WE WERE USING OUR      

01:53:11.419 --> 01:53:13.553
THEN WITH THE THE SET BACK SO   
AGAIN IF WE WERE USING OUR      
FORCE SEE THE SET BACK IS       

01:53:13.555 --> 01:53:17.590
AGAIN IF WE WERE USING OUR      
FORCE SEE THE SET BACK IS       
TWENTY FIVE FEET ON THE FRONT   

01:53:17.592 --> 01:53:18.691
FORCE SEE THE SET BACK IS       
TWENTY FIVE FEET ON THE FRONT   
AND SO PART OF THE BENEFIT HERE 

01:53:18.693 --> 01:53:19.559
TWENTY FIVE FEET ON THE FRONT   
AND SO PART OF THE BENEFIT HERE 
IS WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BRING THAT    

01:53:19.561 --> 01:53:22.328
AND SO PART OF THE BENEFIT HERE 
IS WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BRING THAT    
FORWARD AND THEN WE JUST HAD A  

01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:25.399
IS WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BRING THAT    
FORWARD AND THEN WE JUST HAD A  
CONVERSATION ABOUT MAKING A     

01:53:25.401 --> 01:53:29.670
FORWARD AND THEN WE JUST HAD A  
CONVERSATION ABOUT MAKING A     
MAXIMUM TO THIS SO THAT THAT    

01:53:29.672 --> 01:53:30.604
CONVERSATION ABOUT MAKING A     
MAXIMUM TO THIS SO THAT THAT    
ACTIVATION IF THIS DEVELOPMENT  

01:53:30.606 --> 01:53:34.174
MAXIMUM TO THIS SO THAT THAT    
ACTIVATION IF THIS DEVELOPMENT  
ISN&amp;apos;T DONE STAYS WITH THE PD    

01:53:34.176 --> 01:53:35.041
ACTIVATION IF THIS DEVELOPMENT  
ISN&amp;apos;T DONE STAYS WITH THE PD    
AND THAT WE WON&amp;apos;T GET ANYTHING  

01:53:35.043 --> 01:53:37.944
ISN&amp;apos;T DONE STAYS WITH THE PD    
AND THAT WE WON&amp;apos;T GET ANYTHING  
THAT SET BACK MORE THAN TWENTY  

01:53:37.946 --> 01:53:38.578
AND THAT WE WON&amp;apos;T GET ANYTHING  
THAT SET BACK MORE THAN TWENTY  
FIVE FEET WHICH WOULD ASSUME    

01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:41.514
THAT SET BACK MORE THAN TWENTY  
FIVE FEET WHICH WOULD ASSUME    
THAT IT&amp;apos;S STAYING WITHIN THE    

01:53:41.516 --> 01:53:45.552
FIVE FEET WHICH WOULD ASSUME    
THAT IT&amp;apos;S STAYING WITHIN THE    
EXISTING HOUR FORESEE THAT WE   

01:53:45.554 --> 01:53:49.655
THAT IT&amp;apos;S STAYING WITHIN THE    
EXISTING HOUR FORESEE THAT WE   
CAN WE CAN ADD THAT OK AND SO   

01:53:49.657 --> 01:53:53.393
EXISTING HOUR FORESEE THAT WE   
CAN WE CAN ADD THAT OK AND SO   
AND THEN COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY 

01:53:53.395 --> 01:53:56.797
CAN WE CAN ADD THAT OK AND SO   
AND THEN COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY 
THE DRIVEWAY WITH THE DRIVEWAY  

01:53:56.799 --> 01:54:00.133
AND THEN COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY 
THE DRIVEWAY WITH THE DRIVEWAY  
WIDTH IS APPROXIMATELY TEN FEET 

01:54:00.135 --> 01:54:00.834
THE DRIVEWAY WITH THE DRIVEWAY  
WIDTH IS APPROXIMATELY TEN FEET 
MULTIFAMILY REQUIRES I BELIEVE  

01:54:00.836 --> 01:54:05.338
WIDTH IS APPROXIMATELY TEN FEET 
MULTIFAMILY REQUIRES I BELIEVE  
BETWEEN 18 OR 24 BUT IF THIS    

01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:06.205
MULTIFAMILY REQUIRES I BELIEVE  
BETWEEN 18 OR 24 BUT IF THIS    
WERE A ONE WAY DRIVE YOU KNOW   

01:54:06.207 --> 01:54:09.242
BETWEEN 18 OR 24 BUT IF THIS    
WERE A ONE WAY DRIVE YOU KNOW   
TEN FEET WOULD BE SUFFICIENT    

01:54:09.244 --> 01:54:09.910
WERE A ONE WAY DRIVE YOU KNOW   
TEN FEET WOULD BE SUFFICIENT    
BUT IT&amp;apos;S NOT A TWO WAY DRIVE.   

01:54:09.912 --> 01:54:12.212
TEN FEET WOULD BE SUFFICIENT    
BUT IT&amp;apos;S NOT A TWO WAY DRIVE.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT IS THAT BECAUSE THE    

01:54:12.214 --> 01:54:13.146
BUT IT&amp;apos;S NOT A TWO WAY DRIVE.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT IS THAT BECAUSE THE    
FIRE EGRESS IS THAT TO ALLOW    

01:54:13.148 --> 01:54:16.482
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT IS THAT BECAUSE THE    
FIRE EGRESS IS THAT TO ALLOW    
THE FIRE TRUCKS IN LIKE WHY DO  

01:54:16.484 --> 01:54:19.018
FIRE EGRESS IS THAT TO ALLOW    
THE FIRE TRUCKS IN LIKE WHY DO  
WE HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT AND    

01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:23.456
THE FIRE TRUCKS IN LIKE WHY DO  
WE HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT AND    
OUR FOUR C DOES IT ASSUME THEY  

01:54:23.458 --> 01:54:24.357
WE HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT AND    
OUR FOUR C DOES IT ASSUME THEY  
GOT A LOT I GUESS IS WHAT I&amp;apos;M   

01:54:24.359 --> 01:54:26.993
OUR FOUR C DOES IT ASSUME THEY  
GOT A LOT I GUESS IS WHAT I&amp;apos;M   
WHAT I&amp;apos;M WONDERING ABOUT.       

01:54:26.995 --> 01:54:28.195
GOT A LOT I GUESS IS WHAT I&amp;apos;M   
WHAT I&amp;apos;M WONDERING ABOUT.       
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S WHY YOU MADE THE  

01:54:28.197 --> 01:54:31.497
WHAT I&amp;apos;M WONDERING ABOUT.       
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S WHY YOU MADE THE  
RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE IT LESS. 

01:54:31.499 --> 01:54:31.931
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S WHY YOU MADE THE  
RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE IT LESS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.                         

01:54:31.933 --> 01:54:35.168
RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE IT LESS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.                         
I MEAN THE PD DOES ALLOW FOR,   

01:54:35.170 --> 01:54:35.902
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.                         
I MEAN THE PD DOES ALLOW FOR,   
YOU KNOW, REDUCTIONS WHETHER IT 

01:54:35.904 --> 01:54:39.106
I MEAN THE PD DOES ALLOW FOR,   
YOU KNOW, REDUCTIONS WHETHER IT 
IS FOR SETBACKS, HEIGHT,        

01:54:39.108 --> 01:54:39.706
YOU KNOW, REDUCTIONS WHETHER IT 
IS FOR SETBACKS, HEIGHT,        
DRIVEWAY PARKING.               

01:54:39.708 --> 01:54:42.108
IS FOR SETBACKS, HEIGHT,        
DRIVEWAY PARKING.               
THE PD DOES ALLOW FOR THOSE     

01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:42.409
DRIVEWAY PARKING.               
THE PD DOES ALLOW FOR THOSE     
CHANGES.                        

01:54:42.411 --> 01:54:46.747
THE PD DOES ALLOW FOR THOSE     
CHANGES.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, OK, SO THEN THE OTHER    

01:54:46.749 --> 01:54:50.717
CHANGES.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, OK, SO THEN THE OTHER    
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD CAME FROM  

01:54:50.719 --> 01:54:53.987
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, OK, SO THEN THE OTHER    
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD CAME FROM  
THE PETITIONER WHEN THE         

01:54:53.989 --> 01:54:54.654
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD CAME FROM  
THE PETITIONER WHEN THE         
PETITIONER NOTED THAT THEY      

01:54:54.656 --> 01:54:58.325
THE PETITIONER WHEN THE         
PETITIONER NOTED THAT THEY      
WOULD HAVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE   

01:54:58.327 --> 01:54:59.125
PETITIONER NOTED THAT THEY      
WOULD HAVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE   
THE SAME VARIANCE OF A FOUR     

01:54:59.127 --> 01:55:02.295
WOULD HAVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE   
THE SAME VARIANCE OF A FOUR     
HUNDRED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ON A   

01:55:02.297 --> 01:55:05.665
THE SAME VARIANCE OF A FOUR     
HUNDRED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ON A   
TWENTY ACRE LOT AND THEN I      

01:55:05.667 --> 01:55:08.902
HUNDRED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ON A   
TWENTY ACRE LOT AND THEN I      
HEARD THREE PREVAILING ISSUES.  

01:55:08.904 --> 01:55:09.870
TWENTY ACRE LOT AND THEN I      
HEARD THREE PREVAILING ISSUES.  
ONE WAS THE CONFLICTING LAND    

01:55:09.872 --> 01:55:12.839
HEARD THREE PREVAILING ISSUES.  
ONE WAS THE CONFLICTING LAND    
USE BUFFER WHICH I THINK YOU    

01:55:12.841 --> 01:55:13.473
ONE WAS THE CONFLICTING LAND    
USE BUFFER WHICH I THINK YOU    
ARE RESOLVING BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S      

01:55:13.475 --> 01:55:17.210
USE BUFFER WHICH I THINK YOU    
ARE RESOLVING BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S      
COMING UP AGAINST A PAVED       

01:55:17.212 --> 01:55:17.878
ARE RESOLVING BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S      
COMING UP AGAINST A PAVED       
PARKING LOT AS OPPOSED TO A     

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:18.278
COMING UP AGAINST A PAVED       
PARKING LOT AS OPPOSED TO A

PARKING LOT AS OPPOSED TO A     
RESIDENTIAL.                    
IS THAT CORRECT?                

01:55:18.881 --> 01:55:21.048
RESIDENTIAL.

IS THAT CORRECT?                
CORRECT.                        
AND THEN WE IT WAS THE SET BACK 

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:25.451
CORRECT.                        
AND THEN WE IT WAS THE SET BACK 
ON THE NORTH OR THE FRONT

AND THEN WE IT WAS THE SET BACK 
ON THE NORTH OR THE FRONT       
OF THE DEVELOPMENT WHICH WE     

01:55:28.056 --> 01:55:29.056
ON THE NORTH OR THE FRONT       
OF THE DEVELOPMENT WHICH WE     
JUST TALKED ABOUT AND THEN THE  

01:55:29.058 --> 01:55:32.759
OF THE DEVELOPMENT WHICH WE     
JUST TALKED ABOUT AND THEN THE  
DRIVEWAY WITH ISSUE I THINK     

01:55:32.761 --> 01:55:36.629
JUST TALKED ABOUT AND THEN THE  
DRIVEWAY WITH ISSUE I THINK     
COMMISSIONER MILLS TRIED TO ASK 

01:55:36.631 --> 01:55:37.431
DRIVEWAY WITH ISSUE I THINK     
COMMISSIONER MILLS TRIED TO ASK 
A SIMILAR QUESTION IN THIS VEIN 

01:55:37.433 --> 01:55:40.534
COMMISSIONER MILLS TRIED TO ASK 
A SIMILAR QUESTION IN THIS VEIN 
AROUND WHAT THE VARIANCES       

01:55:40.536 --> 01:55:41.267
A SIMILAR QUESTION IN THIS VEIN 
AROUND WHAT THE VARIANCES       
BETWEEN WOULD BE AND THAT GOT   

01:55:41.269 --> 01:55:44.337
AROUND WHAT THE VARIANCES       
BETWEEN WOULD BE AND THAT GOT   
INTO THE CONVERSATION AROUND    

01:55:44.339 --> 01:55:48.074
BETWEEN WOULD BE AND THAT GOT   
INTO THE CONVERSATION AROUND    
THE UNITS AND THE PARKING.      

01:55:48.076 --> 01:55:50.910
INTO THE CONVERSATION AROUND    
THE UNITS AND THE PARKING.      
SO WE&amp;apos;RE STILL BUILDING A SIX   

01:55:50.912 --> 01:55:51.912
THE UNITS AND THE PARKING.      
SO WE&amp;apos;RE STILL BUILDING A SIX   
UNIT SIX BEDROOM WITH ONE

YEAH, YEAH.                     
I MEAN ESSENTIALLY WHEN THIS    
THIS PROJECT STARTED THEY WERE  

01:56:15.203 --> 01:56:16.135
I MEAN ESSENTIALLY WHEN THIS    
THIS PROJECT STARTED THEY WERE  
REQUIRED TO HAVE THE MINIMUM    

01:56:16.137 --> 01:56:16.736
THIS PROJECT STARTED THEY WERE  
REQUIRED TO HAVE THE MINIMUM    
OF SIX PARKING SPACES.          

01:56:16.738 --> 01:56:17.070
REQUIRED TO HAVE THE MINIMUM

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       

01:56:17.072 --> 01:56:19.406
OF SIX PARKING SPACES.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       
BUT THEN THAT WENT AWAY AND SO  

01:56:19.408 --> 01:56:19.705

ON.                             
AND SO AT THIS STAGE THIS IS

01:56:27.982 --> 01:56:28.648
TO BUILD THAT THIS WAY THAT IT  
IS THIS WAY IT&amp;apos;S NO LONGER      
BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENT      

01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:31.484

MR. SELBY.

I MAY BE A QUESTION FOR HER,    
MR. SELBY.

BUT AND THEN YOU THEN YOU YOU   

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:39.426

BUT AND THEN YOU THEN YOU YOU   
MENTIONED THE PART OF OUR       

01:56:39.428 --> 01:56:42.195
BUT AND THEN YOU THEN YOU YOU   
MENTIONED THE PART OF OUR       
CODE THAT REQUIRES THAT         

01:56:42.197 --> 01:56:42.863
MENTIONED THE PART OF OUR       
CODE THAT REQUIRES THAT

01:56:47.269 --> 01:56:50.637
UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS FROM      
LIVING TOGETHER IN A UNIT AS A  
AS A PART OF YOUR ANSWER TO     

01:56:50.639 --> 01:56:51.304

AS A PART OF YOUR ANSWER TO     
COMMISSIONER MILLS, DID YOU     

01:56:51.306 --> 01:56:54.641
AS A PART OF YOUR ANSWER TO     
COMMISSIONER MILLS, DID YOU     
WANT TO SAY MORE ABOUT THAT?    

01:56:54.643 --> 01:56:58.044
COMMISSIONER MILLS, DID YOU     
WANT TO SAY MORE ABOUT THAT?    
BECAUSE I&amp;apos;VE I&amp;apos;VE QUESTIONED    

01:56:58.046 --> 01:56:58.979
WANT TO SAY MORE ABOUT THAT?    
BECAUSE I&amp;apos;VE I&amp;apos;VE QUESTIONED    
WHY THAT&amp;apos;S IN THE CODE AND      

01:56:58.981 --> 01:56:59.679
BECAUSE I&amp;apos;VE I&amp;apos;VE QUESTIONED    
WHY THAT&amp;apos;S IN THE CODE AND      
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TWO CONVERSATIONS     

01:56:59.681 --> 01:57:02.315
WHY THAT&amp;apos;S IN THE CODE AND      
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TWO CONVERSATIONS     
ABOUT THAT.                     

01:57:02.317 --> 01:57:03.249
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TWO CONVERSATIONS     
ABOUT THAT.                     
THERE WAS A BUILDING            

01:57:03.251 --> 01:57:06.019
ABOUT THAT.                     
THERE WAS A BUILDING            
CODE REQUIREMENT OR SORT OF A   

01:57:06.021 --> 01:57:06.819
THERE WAS A BUILDING            
CODE REQUIREMENT OR SORT OF A   
SAFETY ISSUE THAT WAS           

01:57:06.821 --> 01:57:09.756
CODE REQUIREMENT OR SORT OF A   
SAFETY ISSUE THAT WAS           
UNDERLYING THAT AND THEN I WAS  

01:57:09.758 --> 01:57:10.523
SAFETY ISSUE THAT WAS           
UNDERLYING THAT AND THEN I WAS  
CONCERNED ABOUT LIKE IS THIS A  

01:57:10.525 --> 01:57:13.960
UNDERLYING THAT AND THEN I WAS  
CONCERNED ABOUT LIKE IS THIS A  
LEGACY THING THAT WAS IN OUR    

01:57:13.962 --> 01:57:14.628
CONCERNED ABOUT LIKE IS THIS A  
LEGACY THING THAT WAS IN OUR    
CODE BECAUSE WE WERE BEING A    

01:57:14.630 --> 01:57:17.563
LEGACY THING THAT WAS IN OUR    
CODE BECAUSE WE WERE BEING A    
DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMUNITY     

01:57:17.565 --> 01:57:18.398
CODE BECAUSE WE WERE BEING A    
DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMUNITY     
WHEN THIS WAS DRAFTED AND WE    

01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.333
DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMUNITY     
WHEN THIS WAS DRAFTED AND WE    
WANT IT TO RESTRICT UNRELATED   

01:57:21.335 --> 01:57:22.302
WHEN THIS WAS DRAFTED AND WE    
WANT IT TO RESTRICT UNRELATED   
PEOPLE AND WHEN WE LOOK EVEN    

01:57:22.304 --> 01:57:23.102
WANT IT TO RESTRICT UNRELATED   
PEOPLE AND WHEN WE LOOK EVEN    
FURTHER BACK WE CAN SEE THAT    

01:57:23.104 --> 01:57:25.238
PEOPLE AND WHEN WE LOOK EVEN    
FURTHER BACK WE CAN SEE THAT    
THIS ACTUALLY HAS A LOT TO DO   

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:28.307
FURTHER BACK WE CAN SEE THAT    
THIS ACTUALLY HAS A LOT TO DO   
WITH THE CONTROL OF THE         

01:57:28.309 --> 01:57:29.108
THIS ACTUALLY HAS A LOT TO DO   
WITH THE CONTROL OF THE         
MOVEMENT OF HUMAN BODIES AROUND 

01:57:29.110 --> 01:57:32.545
WITH THE CONTROL OF THE         
MOVEMENT OF HUMAN BODIES AROUND 
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.             

01:57:32.547 --> 01:57:33.680
MOVEMENT OF HUMAN BODIES AROUND 
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.             
AND SO IS THERE ANY MORE ABOUT  

01:57:33.682 --> 01:57:40.586
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.             
AND SO IS THERE ANY MORE ABOUT  
THAT THAT YOU WANTED TO SHARE?  

01:57:40.588 --> 01:57:40.986
AND SO IS THERE ANY MORE ABOUT  
THAT THAT YOU WANTED TO SHARE?  
SURE.                           

01:57:40.988 --> 01:57:42.221
THAT THAT YOU WANTED TO SHARE?  
SURE.                           
WHICH I CAN MAYBE I&amp;apos;LL TAKE A   

01:57:42.223 --> 01:57:44.824
SURE.                           
WHICH I CAN MAYBE I&amp;apos;LL TAKE A   
STAB AT THAT.                   

01:57:44.826 --> 01:57:46.025
WHICH I CAN MAYBE I&amp;apos;LL TAKE A   
STAB AT THAT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT IS A LEGACY CODE ?     

01:57:46.027 --> 01:57:49.061
STAB AT THAT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT IS A LEGACY CODE ?     
IT IS IN THE PAST AND CURRENTLY 

01:57:49.063 --> 01:57:51.931
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT IS A LEGACY CODE ?     
IT IS IN THE PAST AND CURRENTLY 
THE CITY HAS REGULATED THAT THE 

01:57:51.933 --> 01:57:55.869
IT IS IN THE PAST AND CURRENTLY 
THE CITY HAS REGULATED THAT THE 
SITE WHO CAN OCCUPY A HOUSEHOLD 

01:57:55.871 --> 01:57:56.469
THE CITY HAS REGULATED THAT THE 
SITE WHO CAN OCCUPY A HOUSEHOLD 
SHOULD BE REGULATED.            

01:57:56.471 --> 01:58:00.005
SITE WHO CAN OCCUPY A HOUSEHOLD 
SHOULD BE REGULATED.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DEFINES FAMILY AND THEN   

01:58:00.007 --> 01:58:00.640
SHOULD BE REGULATED.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DEFINES FAMILY AND THEN   
IT PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE.     

01:58:00.642 --> 01:58:01.841
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DEFINES FAMILY AND THEN   
IT PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF IT IS NOT A FAMILY IT CAN 

01:58:01.843 --> 01:58:04.310
IT PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF IT IS NOT A FAMILY IT CAN 
BE UP TO A CERTAIN NUMBER       

01:58:04.312 --> 01:58:07.580
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF IT IS NOT A FAMILY IT CAN 
BE UP TO A CERTAIN NUMBER       
OF UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS AND    

01:58:07.582 --> 01:58:08.348
BE UP TO A CERTAIN NUMBER       
OF UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS AND    
THE MAJORITY OF OUR DISTRICTS.  

01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:12.152
OF UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS AND    
THE MAJORITY OF OUR DISTRICTS.  
IT&amp;apos;S FOR THEY ARE FOR DISTRICT  

01:58:12.154 --> 01:58:16.022
THE MAJORITY OF OUR DISTRICTS.  
IT&amp;apos;S FOR THEY ARE FOR DISTRICT  
IT&amp;apos;S SIX SO IT IS IT IS         

01:58:16.024 --> 01:58:16.689
IT&amp;apos;S FOR THEY ARE FOR DISTRICT  
IT&amp;apos;S SIX SO IT IS IT IS         
DEFINITELY A LONG TIME          

01:58:16.691 --> 01:58:18.658
IT&amp;apos;S SIX SO IT IS IT IS         
DEFINITELY A LONG TIME          
PROVISION.                      

01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:22.528
DEFINITELY A LONG TIME          
PROVISION.                      
I THINK IT&amp;apos;S ALSO COME OUT      

01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:23.129
PROVISION.                      
I THINK IT&amp;apos;S ALSO COME OUT      
OF SOME COURT CASES             

01:58:23.131 --> 01:58:26.666
I THINK IT&amp;apos;S ALSO COME OUT      
OF SOME COURT CASES             
HISTORICALLY THAT CHALLENGED    

01:58:26.668 --> 01:58:31.303
OF SOME COURT CASES             
HISTORICALLY THAT CHALLENGED    
THE CITY&amp;apos;S DEFINITION OF FAMILY 

01:58:31.305 --> 01:58:32.037
HISTORICALLY THAT CHALLENGED    
THE CITY&amp;apos;S DEFINITION OF FAMILY 
AT ONE POINT IN TIME.           

01:58:32.039 --> 01:58:33.506
THE CITY&amp;apos;S DEFINITION OF FAMILY 
AT ONE POINT IN TIME.           
SO I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S ALSO SOME    

01:58:33.508 --> 01:58:34.306
AT ONE POINT IN TIME.           
SO I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S ALSO SOME    
JUDICIAL BACKGROUND TO THAT     

01:58:34.308 --> 01:58:34.774
SO I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S ALSO SOME    
JUDICIAL BACKGROUND TO THAT     
STANDARD AS WELL.               

01:58:34.776 --> 01:58:38.210
JUDICIAL BACKGROUND TO THAT     
STANDARD AS WELL.               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT NONE OF THAT WOULD BE AT 

01:58:38.212 --> 01:58:38.945
STANDARD AS WELL.               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT NONE OF THAT WOULD BE AT 
PLAY SINCE THIS IS A PEABODY    

01:58:38.947 --> 01:58:42.349
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT NONE OF THAT WOULD BE AT 
PLAY SINCE THIS IS A PEABODY    
AND IT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT ZONING.    

01:58:42.351 --> 01:58:43.549
PLAY SINCE THIS IS A PEABODY    
AND IT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT ZONING.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, THE CITY COULD STIPULATE 

01:58:43.551 --> 01:58:46.218
AND IT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT ZONING.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, THE CITY COULD STIPULATE 
SO THESE SUPPLEMENTAL           

01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:46.953
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, THE CITY COULD STIPULATE 
SO THESE SUPPLEMENTAL           
REGULATIONS DO DEFAULT TO THE R 

01:58:46.955 --> 01:58:48.955
SO THESE SUPPLEMENTAL           
REGULATIONS DO DEFAULT TO THE R 
FOR C TO DEFINE USES.           

01:58:48.957 --> 01:58:49.989
REGULATIONS DO DEFAULT TO THE R 
FOR C TO DEFINE USES.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT OCCUPANCY WOULD 

01:58:49.991 --> 01:58:50.623
FOR C TO DEFINE USES.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT OCCUPANCY WOULD 
FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY.        

01:58:50.625 --> 01:58:52.992
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT OCCUPANCY WOULD 
FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY.        
BUT YES, THE PLANNING           

01:58:52.994 --> 01:58:53.793
FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY.        
BUT YES, THE PLANNING           
COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL 

01:58:53.795 --> 01:58:56.962
BUT YES, THE PLANNING           
COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL 
COULD CHOOSE TO APPLY A         

01:58:56.964 --> 01:58:57.664
COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL 
COULD CHOOSE TO APPLY A         
DIFFERENT STANDARD BUT IT       

01:58:57.666 --> 01:58:58.364
COULD CHOOSE TO APPLY A         
DIFFERENT STANDARD BUT IT       
SHOULD BE CALLED OUT IF THAT&amp;apos;S  

01:58:58.366 --> 01:59:00.700
DIFFERENT STANDARD BUT IT       
SHOULD BE CALLED OUT IF THAT&amp;apos;S  
A DESIRE.                       

01:59:00.702 --> 01:59:01.101

A DESIRE.

CODE MOVED FORWARD IS THAT      
BUILDINGS TAKE MORE ENERGY.     
WELL, WE HAVE MORE ENERGY       

02:46:15.067 --> 02:46:19.269
BUILDINGS TAKE MORE ENERGY.     
WELL, WE HAVE MORE ENERGY       
EFFICIENT UNITS AND THINGS LIKE 

02:46:19.271 --> 02:46:21.738
WELL, WE HAVE MORE ENERGY       
EFFICIENT UNITS AND THINGS LIKE 
THAT.                           

02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:22.772
EFFICIENT UNITS AND THINGS LIKE 
THAT.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE AMOUNT OF AIR            

02:46:22.774 --> 02:46:26.443
THAT.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE AMOUNT OF AIR            
RECIRCULATED FOR HEALTHY SPACES 

02:46:26.445 --> 02:46:27.243
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE AMOUNT OF AIR            
RECIRCULATED FOR HEALTHY SPACES 
ACTUALLY DEMANDS KIND OF MORE   

02:46:27.245 --> 02:46:30.314
RECIRCULATED FOR HEALTHY SPACES 
ACTUALLY DEMANDS KIND OF MORE   
ENERGY ON THE SYSTEMS VERSUS    

02:46:30.316 --> 02:46:30.981
ACTUALLY DEMANDS KIND OF MORE   
ENERGY ON THE SYSTEMS VERSUS    
OUR OUR OLDER SYSTEMS THAT      

02:46:30.983 --> 02:46:33.817
ENERGY ON THE SYSTEMS VERSUS    
OUR OUR OLDER SYSTEMS THAT      
DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO ACTUALLY TURN    

02:46:33.819 --> 02:46:34.718
OUR OUR OLDER SYSTEMS THAT      
DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO ACTUALLY TURN    
OVER AIR AT THE SAME VOLUME     

02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:35.252
DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO ACTUALLY TURN    
OVER AIR AT THE SAME VOLUME     
THAT IT DOES NOW.               

02:46:35.254 --> 02:46:38.555
OVER AIR AT THE SAME VOLUME     
THAT IT DOES NOW.               
SO IT&amp;apos;S A TRADEOFF THAT MANY    

02:46:38.557 --> 02:46:41.791
THAT IT DOES NOW.               
SO IT&amp;apos;S A TRADEOFF THAT MANY    
PROJECTS ARE REQUIRING          

02:46:41.793 --> 02:46:42.559
SO IT&amp;apos;S A TRADEOFF THAT MANY    
PROJECTS ARE REQUIRING          
UPGRADING THEIR SERVICE TO MEET 

02:46:42.561 --> 02:46:43.227
PROJECTS ARE REQUIRING          
UPGRADING THEIR SERVICE TO MEET 
THE CURRENT MECHANICAL AND      

02:46:43.229 --> 02:46:46.463
UPGRADING THEIR SERVICE TO MEET 
THE CURRENT MECHANICAL AND      
ENERGY CODE BECAUSE THERE&amp;apos;S     

02:46:46.465 --> 02:46:47.464
THE CURRENT MECHANICAL AND      
ENERGY CODE BECAUSE THERE&amp;apos;S     
JUST MORE REQUIREMENTS TO IT AS 

02:46:47.466 --> 02:46:49.766
ENERGY CODE BECAUSE THERE&amp;apos;S     
JUST MORE REQUIREMENTS TO IT AS 
WELL.                           

02:46:49.768 --> 02:46:50.734
JUST MORE REQUIREMENTS TO IT AS 
WELL.                           
SO WHILE WE&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY SAVING  

02:46:50.736 --> 02:46:53.937
WELL.                           
SO WHILE WE&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY SAVING  
ENERGY WITH A CERTAIN SYSTEMS,  

02:46:53.939 --> 02:46:54.738
SO WHILE WE&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY SAVING  
ENERGY WITH A CERTAIN SYSTEMS,  
THERE&amp;apos;S JUST MORE REQUIREMENT   

02:46:54.740 --> 02:46:56.707
ENERGY WITH A CERTAIN SYSTEMS,  
THERE&amp;apos;S JUST MORE REQUIREMENT   
TO MEET THE HIGHER QUALITY      

02:46:56.709 --> 02:46:57.374
THERE&amp;apos;S JUST MORE REQUIREMENT

BUT THE CIRCULATION FAN DOESN&amp;apos;T 

02:49:15.147 --> 02:49:18.315
HOUSE I&amp;apos;VE LIVED IN IS IS WEIRD 
BUT THE CIRCULATION FAN DOESN&amp;apos;T 
WORK EVEN ON A GAS FURNACE WHEN 

02:49:18.317 --> 02:49:18.915
BUT THE CIRCULATION FAN DOESN&amp;apos;T

02:49:33.965 --> 02:49:34.764
ELECTRIC HEAT IS NO LESS        
RELIABLE IN IN A IN A POWER     
OUTAGE SITUATION THAN GAS HEAT  

02:49:34.766 --> 02:49:36.733
RELIABLE IN IN A IN A POWER     
OUTAGE SITUATION THAN GAS HEAT  
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S FORESTIER.         

02:49:36.735 --> 02:49:37.601
OUTAGE SITUATION THAN GAS HEAT

AND OK YEAH YEAH I MEAN THERE&amp;apos;S 

02:49:51.983 --> 02:49:52.982
THERE&amp;apos;S THE BACKUP GENERATION   
AND OK YEAH YEAH I MEAN THERE&amp;apos;S 
ALSO LIKE WELL OUR CLIMATE IS   

02:49:52.984 --> 02:49:56.419
AND OK YEAH YEAH I MEAN THERE&amp;apos;S 
ALSO LIKE WELL OUR CLIMATE IS   
SUCH THAT WE&amp;apos;RE OUR NATURAL GAS 

02:49:56.421 --> 02:50:00.223
ALSO LIKE WELL OUR CLIMATE IS   
SUCH THAT WE&amp;apos;RE OUR NATURAL GAS 
SYSTEM IS PREPARED FOR COLD BUT 

02:50:00.225 --> 02:50:04.227
SUCH THAT WE&amp;apos;RE OUR NATURAL GAS 
SYSTEM IS PREPARED FOR COLD BUT 
NOT OTHER PLACE IN TERMS OF THE 

02:50:04.229 --> 02:50:04.961
SYSTEM IS PREPARED FOR COLD BUT 
NOT OTHER PLACE IN TERMS OF THE 
RESEARCH LEONARD THAT I THINK   

02:50:04.963 --> 02:50:06.997
NOT OTHER PLACE IN TERMS OF THE 
RESEARCH LEONARD THAT I THINK   
YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARDS   

02:50:06.999 --> 02:50:07.864
RESEARCH LEONARD THAT I THINK   
YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARDS   
TO LIKE THE EMISSIONS           

02:50:07.866 --> 02:50:11.567
YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARDS   
TO LIKE THE EMISSIONS           
COMPARISONS, I I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW     

02:50:11.569 --> 02:50:14.804
TO LIKE THE EMISSIONS           
COMPARISONS, I I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW     
THAT THAT&amp;apos;S I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT I 

02:50:14.806 --> 02:50:15.671
COMPARISONS, I I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW     
THAT THAT&amp;apos;S I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT I 
WOULD PUT TOO MUCH EFFORT IN    

02:50:15.673 --> 02:50:16.039
THAT THAT&amp;apos;S I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT I 
WOULD PUT TOO MUCH EFFORT IN    
THAT IN PART.                   

02:50:16.041 --> 02:50:18.641
WOULD PUT TOO MUCH EFFORT IN    
THAT IN PART.                   
I MEAN IT DIDN&amp;apos;T GO FAR ENOUGH  

02:50:18.643 --> 02:50:19.576
THAT IN PART.                   
I MEAN IT DIDN&amp;apos;T GO FAR ENOUGH  
BUT JUST CAME OUT WITH THIS     

02:50:19.578 --> 02:50:22.713
I MEAN IT DIDN&amp;apos;T GO FAR ENOUGH  
BUT JUST CAME OUT WITH THIS     
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN WHICH  

02:50:22.715 --> 02:50:23.647
BUT JUST CAME OUT WITH THIS     
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN WHICH  
DOES MOVE UP THE RETIREMENT     

02:50:23.649 --> 02:50:26.949
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN WHICH  
DOES MOVE UP THE RETIREMENT     
DATE OF THE COAL OF PARTS THE   

02:50:26.951 --> 02:50:28.017
DOES MOVE UP THE RETIREMENT     
DATE OF THE COAL OF PARTS THE   
COAL FLEET AND SO IT IS GETTING 

02:50:28.019 --> 02:50:31.254
DATE OF THE COAL OF PARTS THE   
COAL FLEET AND SO IT IS GETTING 
CLEANER AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO 

02:50:31.256 --> 02:50:31.621
COAL FLEET AND SO IT IS GETTING 
CLEANER AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO 
GET CLEANER.                    

02:50:31.623 --> 02:50:34.424
CLEANER AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO 
GET CLEANER.                    
AND SO AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THIS  

02:50:34.426 --> 02:50:37.894
GET CLEANER.                    
AND SO AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THIS  
IS THE DIRECTION THAT THE GRID  

02:50:37.896 --> 02:50:38.862
AND SO AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THIS  
IS THE DIRECTION THAT THE GRID  
IS HEADING AND THAT YES, RIGHT  

02:50:38.864 --> 02:50:42.265
IS THE DIRECTION THAT THE GRID  
IS HEADING AND THAT YES, RIGHT  
NOW IT MAY BE IT MAY INCREASE   

02:50:42.267 --> 02:50:46.135
IS HEADING AND THAT YES, RIGHT  
NOW IT MAY BE IT MAY INCREASE   
IN EMISSIONS TEMPORARILY BUT    

02:50:46.137 --> 02:50:46.936
NOW IT MAY BE IT MAY INCREASE   
IN EMISSIONS TEMPORARILY BUT    
THEN WE ARE NOT LOCKING         

02:50:46.938 --> 02:50:49.172
IN EMISSIONS TEMPORARILY BUT    
THEN WE ARE NOT LOCKING         
OURSELVES INTO ADDITIONAL       

02:50:49.174 --> 02:50:49.773
THEN WE ARE NOT LOCKING         
OURSELVES INTO ADDITIONAL       
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE          

02:50:49.775 --> 02:50:57.080
OURSELVES INTO ADDITIONAL       
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE          
ADDITIONAL MATERIALS AND THAT   

02:50:57.082 --> 02:50:57.947
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE          
ADDITIONAL MATERIALS AND THAT   
ARE NEEDED FOR ADDING IN        

02:50:57.949 --> 02:51:01.018
ADDITIONAL MATERIALS AND THAT   
ARE NEEDED FOR ADDING IN        
ANOTHER KIND OF ANOTHER SYSTEM  

02:51:01.020 --> 02:51:01.351
ARE NEEDED FOR ADDING IN        
ANOTHER KIND OF ANOTHER SYSTEM  
.                               

02:51:01.353 --> 02:51:02.085
ANOTHER KIND OF ANOTHER SYSTEM  
.                               
SO LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE&amp;apos;RE     

02:51:02.087 --> 02:51:02.952
.                               
SO LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE&amp;apos;RE     
JUST NOT ADDING IN WE&amp;apos;RE NOT    

02:51:02.954 --> 02:51:05.822
SO LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE&amp;apos;RE     
JUST NOT ADDING IN WE&amp;apos;RE NOT    
EXTEND THAT GAS INFRASTRUCTURE  

02:51:05.824 --> 02:51:06.389
JUST NOT ADDING IN WE&amp;apos;RE NOT    
EXTEND THAT GAS INFRASTRUCTURE  
TO THAT PLACE AND HAVING IT&amp;apos;S   

02:51:06.391 --> 02:51:09.258
EXTEND THAT GAS INFRASTRUCTURE  
TO THAT PLACE AND HAVING IT&amp;apos;S   
NOT QUITE THE SAME AS STRANDED  

02:51:09.260 --> 02:51:10.127
TO THAT PLACE AND HAVING IT&amp;apos;S   
NOT QUITE THE SAME AS STRANDED  
ASSET BUT WE TALK ABOUT SOME    

02:51:10.129 --> 02:51:10.727
NOT QUITE THE SAME AS STRANDED  
ASSET BUT WE TALK ABOUT SOME    
KIND OF COAL PLANT RETIREMENTS  

02:51:10.729 --> 02:51:13.696
ASSET BUT WE TALK ABOUT SOME    
KIND OF COAL PLANT RETIREMENTS  
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE SAME IDEA LIKE     

02:51:13.698 --> 02:51:14.264
KIND OF COAL PLANT RETIREMENTS  
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE SAME IDEA LIKE     
YOU&amp;apos;RE ADDING A NEW             

02:51:14.266 --> 02:51:14.997
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE SAME IDEA LIKE     
YOU&amp;apos;RE ADDING A NEW             
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS GOING TO 

02:51:14.999 --> 02:51:17.300
YOU&amp;apos;RE ADDING A NEW             
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS GOING TO 
BE OBSOLETE PRETTY SOON.        

02:51:17.302 --> 02:51:18.468
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS GOING TO 
BE OBSOLETE PRETTY SOON.        
SO I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT I WOULD DO 

02:51:18.470 --> 02:51:25.008
BE OBSOLETE PRETTY SOON.        
SO I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT I WOULD DO 
THAT THAT RESEARCH THE RESEARCH 

02:51:38.256 --> 02:51:40.590
THAT I THINK WOULD BE REALLY    
USEFUL THAT WE&amp;apos;VE HEARD ABOUT   
RECENTLY IS WHETHER THERE ARE   

02:51:40.592 --> 02:51:41.258
USEFUL THAT WE&amp;apos;VE HEARD ABOUT   
RECENTLY IS WHETHER THERE ARE   
HARD TO ELECTRIFY SYSTEMS.      

02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:41.925
RECENTLY IS WHETHER THERE ARE   
HARD TO ELECTRIFY SYSTEMS.      
SO THIS IDEA OF KIND OF BACKUP  

02:51:41.927 --> 02:51:42.925
HARD TO ELECTRIFY SYSTEMS.      
SO THIS IDEA OF KIND OF BACKUP  
FOR WHEN YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT A HIGH YOU  

02:51:42.927 --> 02:51:43.793
SO THIS IDEA OF KIND OF BACKUP  
FOR WHEN YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT A HIGH YOU  
KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE AN ELEVATOR 

02:51:43.795 --> 02:51:44.461
FOR WHEN YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT A HIGH YOU  
KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE AN ELEVATOR 
OR WHATEVER OTHER KIND          

02:51:44.463 --> 02:51:45.062
KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE AN ELEVATOR 
OR WHATEVER OTHER KIND          
OF SYSTEMS LIKE THAT I THINK    

02:51:45.064 --> 02:51:45.696
OR WHATEVER OTHER KIND          
OF SYSTEMS LIKE THAT I THINK    
SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE         

02:51:45.698 --> 02:51:46.163
OF SYSTEMS LIKE THAT I THINK    
SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE         
EXCEPTION.                      

02:51:46.165 --> 02:51:46.630
SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE         
EXCEPTION.                      
WE HEARD THE OTHER DAY          

02:51:46.632 --> 02:51:47.297
EXCEPTION.                      
WE HEARD THE OTHER DAY          
SOMETHING ABOUT COMMERCIAL      

02:51:47.299 --> 02:51:48.097
WE HEARD THE OTHER DAY          
SOMETHING ABOUT COMMERCIAL      
KITCHENS AND AIR CIRCULATION OR 

02:51:48.099 --> 02:51:48.698
SOMETHING ABOUT COMMERCIAL      
KITCHENS AND AIR CIRCULATION OR 
MAKE UP AIR FOR THAT.           

02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:49.232
KITCHENS AND AIR CIRCULATION OR 
MAKE UP AIR FOR THAT.           
I&amp;apos;M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT.         

02:51:49.234 --> 02:51:51.601
MAKE UP AIR FOR THAT.           
I&amp;apos;M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT.         
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE THIS  

02:51:51.603 --> 02:51:54.937
I&amp;apos;M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT.         
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE THIS  
BEFORE WHEN THE THE SITE ON THE 

02:51:54.939 --> 02:51:55.972
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE THIS  
BEFORE WHEN THE THE SITE ON THE 
SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN KIND OF LAB  

02:51:55.974 --> 02:51:59.142
BEFORE WHEN THE THE SITE ON THE 
SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN KIND OF LAB  
SPACE LIKE I THINK THINKING     

02:51:59.144 --> 02:51:59.942
SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN KIND OF LAB  
SPACE LIKE I THINK THINKING     
THROUGH THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE I WOULD    

02:51:59.944 --> 02:52:03.547
SPACE LIKE I THINK THINKING     
THROUGH THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE I WOULD    
PUT ANY RESEARCH TIME IN TERMS  

02:52:03.549 --> 02:52:04.214
THROUGH THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE I WOULD    
PUT ANY RESEARCH TIME IN TERMS  
OF WHETHER THERE ARE THINGS     

02:52:04.216 --> 02:52:07.683
PUT ANY RESEARCH TIME IN TERMS  
OF WHETHER THERE ARE THINGS     
LIKE THAT THAT REALLY ARE JUST  

02:52:07.685 --> 02:52:10.520
OF WHETHER THERE ARE THINGS     
LIKE THAT THAT REALLY ARE JUST  
HARD TO ELECTRIFY BUT OTHERWISE 

02:52:10.522 --> 02:52:14.925
LIKE THAT THAT REALLY ARE JUST  
HARD TO ELECTRIFY BUT OTHERWISE 
I&amp;apos;M EXCITED TO HAVE US MOVE     

02:52:14.927 --> 02:52:15.391
HARD TO ELECTRIFY BUT OTHERWISE 
I&amp;apos;M EXCITED TO HAVE US MOVE     
FORWARD ON THIS.                

02:52:15.393 --> 02:52:22.499
I&amp;apos;M EXCITED TO HAVE US MOVE     
FORWARD ON THIS.                
I DON&amp;apos;T LIKE IT&amp;apos;S NOT THE BEST  

02:52:22.501 --> 02:52:22.966
FORWARD ON THIS.                
I DON&amp;apos;T LIKE IT&amp;apos;S NOT THE BEST  
OF MY KNOWLEDGE.                

02:52:22.968 --> 02:52:25.535
I DON&amp;apos;T LIKE IT&amp;apos;S NOT THE BEST  
OF MY KNOWLEDGE.                
IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S GOOD THAT THE THAT    

02:52:25.537 --> 02:52:26.302
OF MY KNOWLEDGE.                
IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S GOOD THAT THE THAT    
THE ENERGY CODE IS MOVING       

02:52:26.304 --> 02:52:30.340
IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S GOOD THAT THE THAT    
THE ENERGY CODE IS MOVING       
TOWARDS EFFICIENCY.             

02:52:30.342 --> 02:52:31.475
THE ENERGY CODE IS MOVING       
TOWARDS EFFICIENCY.             
I MEAN I&amp;apos;VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A  

02:52:31.477 --> 02:52:32.208
TOWARDS EFFICIENCY.             
I MEAN I&amp;apos;VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A  
LOT OF THE DISCUSSIONS KIND     

02:52:32.210 --> 02:52:32.809
I MEAN I&amp;apos;VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A  
LOT OF THE DISCUSSIONS KIND     
OF AROUND THIS TOO.             

02:52:32.811 --> 02:52:34.945
LOT OF THE DISCUSSIONS KIND     
OF AROUND THIS TOO.             
THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF MONEY COMING   

02:52:34.947 --> 02:52:35.779
OF AROUND THIS TOO.             
THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF MONEY COMING   
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 

02:52:35.781 --> 02:52:37.781
THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF MONEY COMING   
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 
THE STATES TO BOTH IMPLEMENT    

02:52:37.783 --> 02:52:38.582
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 
THE STATES TO BOTH IMPLEMENT    
THE EXISTING ENERGY CODE THAT   

02:52:38.584 --> 02:52:39.115
THE STATES TO BOTH IMPLEMENT    
THE EXISTING ENERGY CODE THAT   
THEY HAVE HAVE BETTER           

02:52:39.117 --> 02:52:43.053
THE EXISTING ENERGY CODE THAT   
THEY HAVE HAVE BETTER           
ENFORCEMENT ON IT AND TO MOVE   

02:52:43.055 --> 02:52:43.720
THEY HAVE HAVE BETTER           
ENFORCEMENT ON IT AND TO MOVE   
TO MORE INNOVATIVE ENERGY       

02:52:43.722 --> 02:52:46.156
ENFORCEMENT ON IT AND TO MOVE   
TO MORE INNOVATIVE ENERGY       
CODE SO I THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S     

02:52:46.158 --> 02:52:46.490
TO MORE INNOVATIVE ENERGY       
CODE SO I THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S     
REALLY GREAT.                   

02:52:46.492 --> 02:52:49.426
CODE SO I THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S     
REALLY GREAT.                   
IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING AS FAR AS YOU    

02:52:49.428 --> 02:52:50.226
REALLY GREAT.                   
IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING AS FAR AS YOU    
KNOW, ALL ELECTRIC THOUGH.      

02:52:50.228 --> 02:52:50.560
IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING AS FAR AS YOU    
KNOW, ALL ELECTRIC THOUGH.      
YEAH.                           

02:52:50.562 --> 02:52:54.030
KNOW, ALL ELECTRIC THOUGH.      
YEAH.                           
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THE    

02:52:54.032 --> 02:52:54.765
YEAH.                           
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THE    
TWO PRONGED APPROACH IS REALLY  

02:52:54.767 --> 02:52:57.666
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THE    
TWO PRONGED APPROACH IS REALLY  
WISE.                           

02:52:57.668 --> 02:52:58.634
TWO PRONGED APPROACH IS REALLY  
WISE.                           
SO I&amp;apos;M I&amp;apos;M EXCITED TO SEE THIS  

02:52:58.636 --> 02:53:01.404
WISE.                           
SO I&amp;apos;M I&amp;apos;M EXCITED TO SEE THIS  
TO SEE KIND OF THIS COME        

02:53:01.406 --> 02:53:02.339
SO I&amp;apos;M I&amp;apos;M EXCITED TO SEE THIS  
TO SEE KIND OF THIS COME        
FORWARD AND HOPE THAT WE MOVE   

02:53:02.341 --> 02:53:05.674
TO SEE KIND OF THIS COME        
FORWARD AND HOPE THAT WE MOVE   
FORWARD ON SOLAR SOON AND HAPPY 

02:53:05.676 --> 02:53:06.575
FORWARD AND HOPE THAT WE MOVE   
FORWARD ON SOLAR SOON AND HAPPY 
TO GET MORE RESEARCH ON         

02:53:06.577 --> 02:53:12.482
FORWARD ON SOLAR SOON AND HAPPY 
TO GET MORE RESEARCH ON         
ELECTRIFICATION                 

02:53:12.616 --> 02:53:21.691
                COMMISSIONER, I 
WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE      
TOPIC AND I DIDN&amp;apos;T THINK THAT   

02:53:21.693 --> 02:53:24.827
WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE      
TOPIC AND I DIDN&amp;apos;T THINK THAT   
WAS SUCH A LONG LIST BUT I&amp;apos;D    

02:53:24.829 --> 02:53:25.761
TOPIC AND I DIDN&amp;apos;T THINK THAT   
WAS SUCH A LONG LIST BUT I&amp;apos;D    
LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE TOPIC AND  

02:53:25.763 --> 02:53:28.998
WAS SUCH A LONG LIST BUT I&amp;apos;D    
LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE TOPIC AND  
THIS ISN&amp;apos;T SO MUCH FOR RESEARCH 

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.767
LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE TOPIC AND  
THIS ISN&amp;apos;T SO MUCH FOR RESEARCH 
BUT MORE FOR CONSIDERATION.     

02:53:31.769 --> 02:53:32.935
THIS ISN&amp;apos;T SO MUCH FOR RESEARCH 
BUT MORE FOR CONSIDERATION.     
AND I THINK THE I&amp;apos;M SORRY THAT  

02:53:32.937 --> 02:53:35.871
BUT MORE FOR CONSIDERATION.     
AND I THINK THE I&amp;apos;M SORRY THAT  
I&amp;apos;M NOT REMEMBERING NAMES OTHER 

02:53:35.873 --> 02:53:36.773
AND I THINK THE I&amp;apos;M SORRY THAT  
I&amp;apos;M NOT REMEMBERING NAMES OTHER 
THAN THE ONES I ALREADY KNOW    

02:53:36.775 --> 02:53:39.875
I&amp;apos;M NOT REMEMBERING NAMES OTHER 
THAN THE ONES I ALREADY KNOW    
BUT I&amp;apos;D LIKE TO THANK A         

02:53:39.877 --> 02:53:40.443

PLUMBERS UNION FOR COMING AND I 
THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE US      
SOMEWHERE IN OUR DELIBERATIONS  

02:53:47.486 --> 02:53:51.087
THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE US      
SOMEWHERE IN OUR DELIBERATIONS  
TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF A JUST 

02:53:51.089 --> 02:53:51.487
SOMEWHERE IN OUR DELIBERATIONS  
TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF A JUST 
TRANSITION.                     

02:53:51.489 --> 02:53:52.288
TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF A JUST 
TRANSITION.                     
I THINK THAT SOME OF THE        

02:53:52.290 --> 02:53:55.391
TRANSITION.                     
I THINK THAT SOME OF THE        
ANXIETY ABOUT THIS IS TOO BIG   

02:53:55.393 --> 02:53:58.595
I THINK THAT SOME OF THE        
ANXIETY ABOUT THIS IS TOO BIG   
OF A JUMP TOO FAST CONCERNS     

02:53:58.597 --> 02:54:06.969
ANXIETY ABOUT THIS IS TOO BIG   
OF A JUMP TOO FAST CONCERNS     
WILL BE WILL BE NOT COMPLETELY  

02:54:06.971 --> 02:54:10.439
OF A JUMP TOO FAST CONCERNS     
WILL BE WILL BE NOT COMPLETELY  
CHANGING OUR JOB MARKET BUT     

02:54:10.441 --> 02:54:11.241
WILL BE WILL BE NOT COMPLETELY  
CHANGING OUR JOB MARKET BUT     
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BE ACCELERATING  

02:54:11.243 --> 02:54:13.976
CHANGING OUR JOB MARKET BUT     
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BE ACCELERATING  
A TRANSITION OUT OF ONE SET     

02:54:13.978 --> 02:54:14.911
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO BE ACCELERATING  
A TRANSITION OUT OF ONE SET     
OF JOBS TO ANOTHER SET OF JOBS. 

02:54:14.913 --> 02:54:18.314
A TRANSITION OUT OF ONE SET     
OF JOBS TO ANOTHER SET OF JOBS. 
AND I KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT     

02:54:18.316 --> 02:54:19.015
OF JOBS TO ANOTHER SET OF JOBS. 
AND I KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT     
WHEN PEOPLE IF I WERE TO        

02:54:19.017 --> 02:54:21.884
AND I KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT     
WHEN PEOPLE IF I WERE TO        
ELECTRIFY MY EXISTING HOUSE     

02:54:21.886 --> 02:54:22.952
WHEN PEOPLE IF I WERE TO        
ELECTRIFY MY EXISTING HOUSE     
WHICH HAS GAS, I WOULD BE       

02:54:22.954 --> 02:54:26.456
ELECTRIFY MY EXISTING HOUSE     
WHICH HAS GAS, I WOULD BE       
HIRING SOMEONE FROM THE FROM A  

02:54:26.458 --> 02:54:30.393
WHICH HAS GAS, I WOULD BE       
HIRING SOMEONE FROM THE FROM A  
UNION TO COME AND CHANGE ON MY  

02:54:30.395 --> 02:54:31.061
HIRING SOMEONE FROM THE FROM A  
UNION TO COME AND CHANGE ON MY  
ELECTRIC BOARDS BECAUSE I&amp;apos;M     

02:54:31.063 --> 02:54:33.396
UNION TO COME AND CHANGE ON MY  
ELECTRIC BOARDS BECAUSE I&amp;apos;M     
SURE THEY CAN&amp;apos;T DO I&amp;apos;M SURE MY  

02:54:33.398 --> 02:54:34.396
ELECTRIC BOARDS BECAUSE I&amp;apos;M     
SURE THEY CAN&amp;apos;T DO I&amp;apos;M SURE MY  
MY HOUSE IS NOT EQUIPPED FOR ME 

02:54:34.398 --> 02:54:37.032
SURE THEY CAN&amp;apos;T DO I&amp;apos;M SURE MY  
MY HOUSE IS NOT EQUIPPED FOR ME 
TO ELECTRIFY.                   

02:54:37.034 --> 02:54:38.167
MY HOUSE IS NOT EQUIPPED FOR ME 
TO ELECTRIFY.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS 

02:54:38.169 --> 02:54:38.968
TO ELECTRIFY.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS 
THAT THAT THE TRANSITION WE&amp;apos;RE  

02:54:38.970 --> 02:54:41.570
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS 
THAT THAT THE TRANSITION WE&amp;apos;RE  
ENVISIONING HERE THERE ARE SOME 

02:54:41.572 --> 02:54:42.372
THAT THAT THE TRANSITION WE&amp;apos;RE  
ENVISIONING HERE THERE ARE SOME 
LOSSES THAT WILL BE OFFSET BY   

02:54:42.374 --> 02:54:45.341
ENVISIONING HERE THERE ARE SOME 
LOSSES THAT WILL BE OFFSET BY   
GAINS IN OTHER WAYS.            

02:54:45.343 --> 02:54:46.275
LOSSES THAT WILL BE OFFSET BY   
GAINS IN OTHER WAYS.            
BUT I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S SOMETHING    

02:54:46.277 --> 02:54:48.778
GAINS IN OTHER WAYS.            
BUT I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S SOMETHING    
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT      

02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:49.578
BUT I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S SOMETHING    
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT      
BECAUSE ONE OF THE FEATURES     

02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:50.347
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT      
BECAUSE ONE OF THE FEATURES     
OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY PLAN IS   

02:54:50.349 --> 02:54:53.048
BECAUSE ONE OF THE FEATURES     
OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY PLAN IS   
EQUITY.                         

02:54:53.050 --> 02:54:54.116
OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY PLAN IS   
EQUITY.                         
AND I THINK WHAT WE&amp;apos;VE HEARD IS 

02:54:54.118 --> 02:54:57.387
EQUITY.                         
AND I THINK WHAT WE&amp;apos;VE HEARD IS 
A QUESTION FROM THE EQUITY SIDE 

02:54:57.389 --> 02:55:01.123
AND I THINK WHAT WE&amp;apos;VE HEARD IS 
A QUESTION FROM THE EQUITY SIDE 
AND I PERSONALLY WOULD BE       

02:55:01.125 --> 02:55:04.527
A QUESTION FROM THE EQUITY SIDE 
AND I PERSONALLY WOULD BE       
DISTRESSED IF UNIONIZED JOBS    

02:55:04.529 --> 02:55:08.431
AND I PERSONALLY WOULD BE       
DISTRESSED IF UNIONIZED JOBS    
THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKED BY    

02:55:08.433 --> 02:55:13.102
DISTRESSED IF UNIONIZED JOBS    
THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKED BY    
UNION LABORERS WERE GOT         

02:55:13.104 --> 02:55:16.172
THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKED BY    
UNION LABORERS WERE GOT         
SWITCHED OVER TO JOBS THAT      

02:55:16.174 --> 02:55:16.673
UNION LABORERS WERE GOT         
SWITCHED OVER TO JOBS THAT      
AREN&amp;apos;T UNIONIZED YET.           

02:55:16.675 --> 02:55:17.674
SWITCHED OVER TO JOBS THAT      
AREN&amp;apos;T UNIONIZED YET.           
AND I&amp;apos;M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT  

02:55:17.676 --> 02:55:20.276
AREN&amp;apos;T UNIONIZED YET.           
AND I&amp;apos;M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT  
YOU DO GEOTHERMAL BECAUSE THAT  

02:55:20.278 --> 02:55:21.010
AND I&amp;apos;M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT  
YOU DO GEOTHERMAL BECAUSE THAT  
MEANS THERE IS UNIONIZATION IN  

02:55:21.012 --> 02:55:21.477
YOU DO GEOTHERMAL BECAUSE THAT  
MEANS THERE IS UNIONIZATION IN  
THE INDUSTRY.                   

02:55:21.479 --> 02:55:24.747
MEANS THERE IS UNIONIZATION IN  
THE INDUSTRY.                   
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T CARE FOR GROCERY    

02:55:24.749 --> 02:55:28.585
THE INDUSTRY.                   
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T CARE FOR GROCERY    
STORES FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE THEIR 

02:55:28.587 --> 02:55:29.252
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T CARE FOR GROCERY    
STORES FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE THEIR 
WORKFORCE IS NOT UNIONIZED      

02:55:29.254 --> 02:55:31.387
STORES FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE THEIR 
WORKFORCE IS NOT UNIONIZED      
UNLESS THEY&amp;apos;RE CO-OP BECAUSE    

02:55:31.389 --> 02:55:31.988
WORKFORCE IS NOT UNIONIZED      
UNLESS THEY&amp;apos;RE CO-OP BECAUSE    
THAT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT THING.       

02:55:31.990 --> 02:55:32.989
UNLESS THEY&amp;apos;RE CO-OP BECAUSE    
THAT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT THING.       
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T CARE FOR LARGE      

02:55:32.991 --> 02:55:35.558
THAT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT THING.       
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T CARE FOR LARGE      
GROCERY CHAINS THAT ARE         

02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:36.226
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T CARE FOR LARGE      
GROCERY CHAINS THAT ARE         
UNIONIZED BECAUSE THAT&amp;apos;S A      

02:55:36.228 --> 02:55:36.893
GROCERY CHAINS THAT ARE         
UNIONIZED BECAUSE THAT&amp;apos;S A      
REALLY STRONG UNION AND WE      

02:55:36.895 --> 02:55:39.562
UNIONIZED BECAUSE THAT&amp;apos;S A      
REALLY STRONG UNION AND WE      
SHOULD BE SHOPPING THERE UNLESS 

02:55:39.564 --> 02:55:40.230
REALLY STRONG UNION AND WE      
SHOULD BE SHOPPING THERE UNLESS 
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO THE FARMER&amp;apos;S     

02:55:40.232 --> 02:55:42.898
SHOULD BE SHOPPING THERE UNLESS 
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO THE FARMER&amp;apos;S     
MARKET WHICH IS A DIFFERENT     

02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:43.166
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO THE FARMER&amp;apos;S     
MARKET WHICH IS A DIFFERENT     
MATTER.

MARKET WHICH IS A DIFFERENT     
MATTER.                         
AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE 

02:55:44.035 --> 02:55:47.303
MATTER.                         
AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE 
NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW DOES

AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE 
NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW DOES 
THIS AFFECT OUR COMMITMENTS TO

NOT JUST SUSTAINABLE ENERGY BUT 
SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS SO WE   
LIKE TO PUT THAT UP FOR

SCENARIOS THAT WOULD BE SILLY   
BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE    
NEED TO THINK ABOUT.            

02:56:56.308 --> 02:56:57.406
BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE

THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE

WOULDN&amp;apos;T BE REDUCING ANYBODY&amp;apos;S  
CARBON FOOTPRINT IF OUR MORE    
STRICT REGULATIONS PUSHED MORE  

02:57:08.719 --> 02:57:09.352
CARBON FOOTPRINT IF OUR MORE    
STRICT REGULATIONS PUSHED MORE  
DEVELOPMENT TO THE PERIPHERY    

02:57:09.354 --> 02:57:11.387
STRICT REGULATIONS PUSHED MORE  
DEVELOPMENT TO THE PERIPHERY    
AND CAUSED MORE PEOPLE TO DRIVE 

02:57:11.389 --> 02:57:11.755
DEVELOPMENT TO THE PERIPHERY    
AND CAUSED MORE PEOPLE TO DRIVE 
IN.                             

02:57:11.757 --> 02:57:12.889
AND CAUSED MORE PEOPLE TO DRIVE 
IN.                             
HOWEVER, IF THE WHOLE STATE     

02:57:12.891 --> 02:57:16.792
IN.                             
HOWEVER, IF THE WHOLE STATE     
CHANGES AND UPDATES ITS         

02:57:16.794 --> 02:57:17.460
HOWEVER, IF THE WHOLE STATE     
CHANGES AND UPDATES ITS         
BUILDING CODE WE WILL NOT HAVE  

02:57:17.462 --> 02:57:20.563
CHANGES AND UPDATES ITS         
BUILDING CODE WE WILL NOT HAVE  
TO WORRY ABOUT.                 

02:57:20.565 --> 02:57:21.798
BUILDING CODE WE WILL NOT HAVE  
TO WORRY ABOUT.                 
SO I HOPE THAT THE PACE OF THAT 

02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:24.333
TO WORRY ABOUT.

SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE GRID     
RESILIENCE IS THERE WHETHER

SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE GRID     
RESILIENCE IS THERE WHETHER     
IT&amp;apos;S A GAS FIRED BACKUP OR A    

03:01:20.371 --> 03:01:21.037
RESILIENCE IS THERE WHETHER     
IT&amp;apos;S A GAS FIRED BACKUP OR A    
BATTERY PLAN OR A DISTRIBUTED   

03:01:21.039 --> 03:01:23.306
IT&amp;apos;S A GAS FIRED BACKUP OR A    
BATTERY PLAN OR A DISTRIBUTED   
GRID THAT MAYBE THE CLIMATE     

03:01:23.308 --> 03:01:24.040
BATTERY PLAN OR A DISTRIBUTED   
GRID THAT MAYBE THE CLIMATE     
MILITARY CAN HELP EFFECTUATE    

03:01:24.042 --> 03:01:27.076
GRID THAT MAYBE THE CLIMATE     
MILITARY CAN HELP EFFECTUATE    
GRID RESILIENCE AND LIFE SAFETY 

03:01:27.078 --> 03:01:27.677
MILITARY CAN HELP EFFECTUATE    
GRID RESILIENCE AND LIFE SAFETY 
IS PREDOMINANTLY ONE OF MY      

03:01:27.679 --> 03:01:31.013
GRID RESILIENCE AND LIFE SAFETY 
IS PREDOMINANTLY ONE OF MY      
CONCERNS KIND GOING INTO THIS   

03:01:31.015 --> 03:01:31.747
IS PREDOMINANTLY ONE OF MY      
CONCERNS KIND GOING INTO THIS   
JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE   

03:01:31.749 --> 03:01:34.383
CONCERNS KIND GOING INTO THIS   
JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE   
REDUNDANCIES THAT CAN KEEP      

03:01:34.385 --> 03:01:38.454
JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE   
REDUNDANCIES THAT CAN KEEP      
PEOPLE WARM RELATIVE TO AGAIN I 

03:01:38.456 --> 03:01:44.794
REDUNDANCIES THAT CAN KEEP      
PEOPLE WARM RELATIVE TO AGAIN I 
UNDERSTAND AGAIN HAVING         

03:01:59.743 --> 03:02:02.344
ITEMIZERS AND MAKE UP FOR THERE 
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF THAT BEING SAID AGAIN 

03:02:02.346 --> 03:02:03.378
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF THAT BEING SAID AGAIN 
GRID RESILIENCE IS A CONCERN    

03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:04.146
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALL OF THAT BEING SAID AGAIN 
GRID RESILIENCE IS A CONCERN    
OF MINE SEPARATION OF USES.     

03:02:04.148 --> 03:02:05.114
GRID RESILIENCE IS A CONCERN    
OF MINE SEPARATION OF USES.     
SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS    

03:02:05.116 --> 03:02:05.782
OF MINE SEPARATION OF USES.     
SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS    
THAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN         

03:02:05.784 --> 03:02:06.649
SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS    
THAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN         
ADDRESSING THIS IS THE SCALE    

03:02:06.651 --> 03:02:07.750
THAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN         
ADDRESSING THIS IS THE SCALE    
OF A PROJECT AND THEN ALSO THE  

03:02:07.752 --> 03:02:08.451
ADDRESSING THIS IS THE SCALE    
OF A PROJECT AND THEN ALSO THE  
KIND OF USE IS REQUIRED SO A    

03:02:08.453 --> 03:02:09.118
OF A PROJECT AND THEN ALSO THE  
KIND OF USE IS REQUIRED SO A    
LABORATORY A RESTAURANT HAS     

03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:10.052
KIND OF USE IS REQUIRED SO A    
LABORATORY A RESTAURANT HAS     
DIFFERENT THERMAL REQUIREMENTS  

03:02:10.054 --> 03:02:10.453
LABORATORY A RESTAURANT HAS     
DIFFERENT THERMAL REQUIREMENTS  
THAN HOMES.                     

03:02:10.455 --> 03:02:14.123
DIFFERENT THERMAL REQUIREMENTS  
THAN HOMES.                     
SO I THINK THAT LOOKING AT IT   

03:02:14.125 --> 03:02:17.593
THAN HOMES.                     
SO I THINK THAT LOOKING AT IT   
BY A USE CASE WOULD BE MORE     

03:02:17.595 --> 03:02:18.227
SO I THINK THAT LOOKING AT IT   
BY A USE CASE WOULD BE MORE     
AMICABLE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE,      

03:02:18.229 --> 03:02:22.097
BY A USE CASE WOULD BE MORE     
AMICABLE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE,      
HOTELS, HOTELS, RESTAURANTS,    

03:02:22.099 --> 03:02:23.099
AMICABLE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE,      
HOTELS, HOTELS, RESTAURANTS,    
LABS THOSE ARE SOME OF THE USES 

03:02:23.101 --> 03:02:23.766
HOTELS, HOTELS, RESTAURANTS,    
LABS THOSE ARE SOME OF THE USES 
THAT KIND OF COME TO MIND.      

03:02:23.768 --> 03:02:26.469
LABS THOSE ARE SOME OF THE USES 
THAT KIND OF COME TO MIND.      
SO AS WELL AS THE SCALE OF A    

03:02:26.471 --> 03:02:26.869
THAT KIND OF COME TO MIND.      
SO AS WELL AS THE SCALE OF A    
PROJECT.                        

03:02:26.871 --> 03:02:27.203
SO AS WELL AS THE SCALE OF A    
PROJECT.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       

03:02:27.205 --> 03:02:29.939

TWENTY FOUR UNITS RELATIVE TO   
500 DIFFERENT PERFORMERS,

500 DIFFERENT PERFORMERS,       
DIFFERENT KINDS SHARED WALLS    
REQUIREMENTS THAT GO INTO IT SO 

03:02:36.614 --> 03:02:37.646
DIFFERENT KINDS SHARED WALLS    
REQUIREMENTS THAT GO INTO IT SO 
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS   

03:02:37.648 --> 03:02:38.580
REQUIREMENTS THAT GO INTO IT SO 
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS   
THAT I THINK AGAIN THIS IS VERY 

03:02:38.582 --> 03:02:41.584
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS   
THAT I THINK AGAIN THIS IS VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS     

03:02:41.586 --> 03:02:42.317
THAT I THINK AGAIN THIS IS VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS     
BECAUSE IT OFTEN COMES TO THIS  

03:02:42.319 --> 03:02:45.020
IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS     
BECAUSE IT OFTEN COMES TO THIS  
TABLE WE ASKED PETITIONERS HAVE 

03:02:45.022 --> 03:02:45.822
BECAUSE IT OFTEN COMES TO THIS  
TABLE WE ASKED PETITIONERS HAVE 
YOU TRIED THINKING ABOUT THIS   

03:02:45.824 --> 03:02:46.288
TABLE WE ASKED PETITIONERS HAVE 
YOU TRIED THINKING ABOUT THIS   
OR CODIFYING THIS?              

03:02:46.290 --> 03:02:49.492
YOU TRIED THINKING ABOUT THIS   
OR CODIFYING THIS?              
DOES BRING CLARITY AND THAT IS  

03:02:49.494 --> 03:02:49.959
OR CODIFYING THIS?              
DOES BRING CLARITY AND THAT IS  
IMPORTANT.                      

03:02:49.961 --> 03:02:53.362
DOES BRING CLARITY AND THAT IS  
IMPORTANT.                      
THAT IS OUR JOB TO DO THAT.     

03:02:53.364 --> 03:02:56.832
IMPORTANT.                      
THAT IS OUR JOB TO DO THAT.     
SO I THINK THAT WE NEED IN MY   

03:02:56.834 --> 03:02:57.533
THAT IS OUR JOB TO DO THAT.     
SO I THINK THAT WE NEED IN MY   
MIND THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR US   

03:02:57.535 --> 03:03:01.236
SO I THINK THAT WE NEED IN MY

TO TACKLE.                      

03:03:01.238 --> 03:03:02.405
MIND THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR US   
TO TACKLE.                      
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO    

03:03:02.407 --> 03:03:04.907
TO TACKLE.                      
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO    
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH.            

03:03:04.909 --> 03:03:05.975
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO    
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH.            
I SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT ON THIS  

03:03:05.977 --> 03:03:08.044
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH.            
I SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT ON THIS  
ONE.                            

03:03:08.046 --> 03:03:09.178
I SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT ON THIS  
ONE.                            
THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS A VERY 

03:03:09.180 --> 03:03:10.046
ONE.                            
THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS A VERY 
NECESSARY TOPIC FOR US TO BRING 

03:03:10.048 --> 03:03:12.514
THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS A VERY 
NECESSARY TOPIC FOR US TO BRING 
CLARITY TO THE COMMUNITY FOR.   

03:03:12.516 --> 03:03:16.385
NECESSARY TOPIC FOR US TO BRING 
CLARITY TO THE COMMUNITY FOR.   
SO AGAIN IN MY MIND THE         

03:03:16.387 --> 03:03:19.021
CLARITY TO THE COMMUNITY FOR.   
SO AGAIN IN MY MIND THE         
SEPARATION OF USES SCALE ARE    

03:03:19.023 --> 03:03:19.955
SO AGAIN IN MY MIND THE         
SEPARATION OF USES SCALE ARE    
TWO THINGS THAT WE SHOULD THINK 

03:03:19.957 --> 03:03:20.823
SEPARATION OF USES SCALE ARE    
TWO THINGS THAT WE SHOULD THINK 
ABOUT AS WELL AS THE CONCEPTUAL 

03:03:20.825 --> 03:03:24.594
TWO THINGS THAT WE SHOULD THINK 
ABOUT AS WELL AS THE CONCEPTUAL 
AND REALLY FROM THE STANDPOINT  

03:03:24.596 --> 03:03:27.063
ABOUT AS WELL AS THE CONCEPTUAL 
AND REALLY FROM THE STANDPOINT  
OF ALSO THIS SEEMS LIKE A I     

03:03:27.065 --> 03:03:27.997
AND REALLY FROM THE STANDPOINT  
OF ALSO THIS SEEMS LIKE A I     
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT WORD  

03:03:27.999 --> 03:03:31.467
OF ALSO THIS SEEMS LIKE A I     
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT WORD  
IS HERE BUT THERE COULD BE      

03:03:31.469 --> 03:03:32.135
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT WORD  
IS HERE BUT THERE COULD BE      
ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS OR          

03:03:32.137 --> 03:03:35.438
IS HERE BUT THERE COULD BE      
ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS OR          
CONTEMPLATIONS GIVEN TO         

03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:36.038

AND SPECIFIC INSTRUMENTS THAT   
COULD BE BROUGHT TO INCENTIVIZE 

03:03:47.352 --> 03:03:50.552
AND SPECIFIC INSTRUMENTS THAT   
COULD BE BROUGHT TO INCENTIVIZE 
US FURTHER.

THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY PART    
OF THE ORDINANCE.               
BUT I THINK AS WE&amp;apos;VE HAD THE    

03:04:15.145 --> 03:04:18.213
OF THE ORDINANCE.               
BUT I THINK AS WE&amp;apos;VE HAD THE    
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A

BUT I THINK AS WE&amp;apos;VE HAD THE    
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A 
COUPLE OF THESE WEBINARS THAT   

03:04:18.883 --> 03:04:21.283
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A

RESOURCES FOR ME AS I&amp;apos;VE BEEN   
LEARNING MORE AND MORE FROM THE 
KIND OF ARCHITECTURE            

03:04:25.256 --> 03:04:26.054
LEARNING MORE AND MORE FROM THE 
KIND OF ARCHITECTURE            
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW YOU DESIGN   

03:04:26.056 --> 03:04:28.857
KIND OF ARCHITECTURE            
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW YOU DESIGN   
THESE BUILDINGS IS THAT YOU     

03:04:28.859 --> 03:04:33.195
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW YOU DESIGN   
THESE BUILDINGS IS THAT YOU     
SEEM TO BE REALLY FLIPPING A    

03:04:33.197 --> 03:04:34.096
THESE BUILDINGS IS THAT YOU     
SEEM TO BE REALLY FLIPPING A    
PROCESS FOR DESIGN IN TERMS     

03:04:34.098 --> 03:04:37.132
SEEM TO BE REALLY FLIPPING A    
PROCESS FOR DESIGN IN TERMS     
OF HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THESE    

03:04:37.134 --> 03:04:37.900
PROCESS FOR DESIGN IN TERMS     
OF HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THESE    
BUILDINGS AND THAT WE&amp;apos;RE ASKING 

03:04:37.902 --> 03:04:38.768
OF HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THESE    
BUILDINGS AND THAT WE&amp;apos;RE ASKING 
PEOPLE TO KIND OF SWITCH THINGS 

03:04:38.770 --> 03:04:40.569
BUILDINGS AND THAT WE&amp;apos;RE ASKING 
PEOPLE TO KIND OF SWITCH THINGS 
REALLY LATE IN THE PROCESS AND  

03:04:40.571 --> 03:04:41.437
PEOPLE TO KIND OF SWITCH THINGS 
REALLY LATE IN THE PROCESS AND  
THAT WHAT I&amp;apos;VE LEARNED IS THAT  

03:04:41.439 --> 03:04:42.104
REALLY LATE IN THE PROCESS AND  
THAT WHAT I&amp;apos;VE LEARNED IS THAT  
YOU START THINKING ABOUT YOUR   

03:04:42.106 --> 03:04:44.807
THAT WHAT I&amp;apos;VE LEARNED IS THAT  
YOU START THINKING ABOUT YOUR   
ENERGY SYSTEMS REALLY EARLY IN  

03:04:44.809 --> 03:04:45.674
YOU START THINKING ABOUT YOUR   
ENERGY SYSTEMS REALLY EARLY IN  
THE PROCESS WHICH IS NOT WHAT   

03:04:45.676 --> 03:04:48.343
ENERGY SYSTEMS REALLY EARLY IN  
THE PROCESS WHICH IS NOT WHAT   
TYPICALLY HAPPENS.              

03:04:48.345 --> 03:04:52.314
THE PROCESS WHICH IS NOT WHAT   
TYPICALLY HAPPENS.              
AND SO I DON&amp;apos;T THINK ABOUT      

03:04:52.316 --> 03:04:53.348
TYPICALLY HAPPENS.              
AND SO I DON&amp;apos;T THINK ABOUT      
ABOUT IT AS PART OF THE         

03:04:53.350 --> 03:04:54.049
AND SO I DON&amp;apos;T THINK ABOUT      
ABOUT IT AS PART OF THE         
CODE BUT MAYBE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S     

03:04:54.051 --> 03:04:54.650
ABOUT IT AS PART OF THE         
CODE BUT MAYBE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S     
SOME SORT OF WAY FOR US TO      

03:04:54.652 --> 03:04:56.719
CODE BUT MAYBE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S     
SOME SORT OF WAY FOR US TO      
PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE    

03:04:56.721 --> 03:05:00.388
SOME SORT OF WAY FOR US TO

ABOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS ITSELF 
BECAUSE IT DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO BE   

03:05:12.236 --> 03:05:15.971
ABOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS ITSELF 
BECAUSE IT DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO BE   
MORE IT CAN BE A LOT LESS

ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION?          
I DON&amp;apos;T WANT SOLAR TO LINGER    
TOO LONG LIKE HOW WOULD STAFF

THAT LANGUAGE WASN&amp;apos;T PUBLISHED  
UNTIL LATE LAST WEEK SO I GUESS 

03:07:21.799 --> 03:07:25.434
THAT LANGUAGE WASN&amp;apos;T PUBLISHED  
UNTIL LATE LAST WEEK SO I GUESS 
I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THAT WE 

03:07:25.436 --> 03:07:26.101
UNTIL LATE LAST WEEK SO I GUESS 
I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THAT WE 
POSTPONE THAT TO THE 6TH.       

03:07:26.103 --> 03:07:29.771
I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THAT WE 
POSTPONE THAT TO THE 6TH.       
HOWEVER, I AM HEARING A LOT     

03:07:29.773 --> 03:07:32.841
POSTPONE THAT TO THE 6TH.       
HOWEVER, I AM HEARING A LOT     
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF CONVERSATION 

03:07:32.843 --> 03:07:33.676
HOWEVER, I AM HEARING A LOT     
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF CONVERSATION 
ABOUT THESE TWO ORDINANCES.     

03:07:33.678 --> 03:07:34.576
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF CONVERSATION 
ABOUT THESE TWO ORDINANCES.     
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I     

03:07:34.578 --> 03:07:35.411
ABOUT THESE TWO ORDINANCES.     
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I     
WOULD PROPOSE IS WHEN THIS COME 

03:07:35.413 --> 03:07:37.546
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I     
WOULD PROPOSE IS WHEN THIS COME 
THEY COME BACK TO SIX WE SPLIT  

03:07:37.548 --> 03:07:41.083
WOULD PROPOSE IS WHEN THIS COME 
THEY COME BACK TO SIX WE SPLIT  
THEM SO THAT IF THE COMMISSION  

03:07:41.085 --> 03:07:42.184
THEY COME BACK TO SIX WE SPLIT

IS OF THE MIND TO TAKE ACTION   
MORE QUICKLY AND ONE THAN THE   
OTHER AS I&amp;apos;M TAKING A FEW MORE  

03:07:46.524 --> 03:07:48.824
MORE QUICKLY AND ONE THAN THE   
OTHER AS I&amp;apos;M TAKING A FEW MORE  
NOTES THE ELECTRIFICATION I     

03:07:48.826 --> 03:07:52.794
OTHER AS I&amp;apos;M TAKING A FEW MORE  
NOTES THE ELECTRIFICATION I     
OF COURSE I HOPE IS TO BE ABLE

03:07:53.498 --> 03:07:56.498
OF COURSE I HOPE IS TO BE ABLE  
TO SUCCESSFULLY ANSWER ALL      
THESE QUESTIONS BUT I THINK     

03:07:56.500 --> 03:07:57.099
TO SUCCESSFULLY ANSWER ALL      
THESE QUESTIONS BUT I THINK     
THAT THERE MIGHT BE MORE        

03:07:57.101 --> 03:07:57.633
THESE QUESTIONS BUT I THINK     
THAT THERE MIGHT BE MORE        
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT             

03:07:57.635 --> 03:08:00.102
THAT THERE MIGHT BE MORE        
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT             
ELECTRIFICATION REGARDLESS SO   

03:08:00.104 --> 03:08:04.873
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT             
ELECTRIFICATION REGARDLESS SO   
SO A LONG WAY OF SAYING MY      

03:08:04.875 --> 03:08:05.541
ELECTRIFICATION REGARDLESS SO   
SO A LONG WAY OF SAYING MY      
RECOMMENDATIONS STILL WOULD BE  

03:08:05.543 --> 03:08:08.077

INTENTION WOULD BE THEN TO      

03:08:09.813 --> 03:08:11.880
BUT WHEN THEY COME BACK MY

SPLIT THEM AND THEN THE         

03:08:11.882 --> 03:08:12.681
INTENTION WOULD BE THEN TO      
SPLIT THEM AND THEN THE         
COMMISSION COULD CONSIDER THESE 

03:08:12.683 --> 03:08:13.315
SPLIT THEM AND THEN THE         
COMMISSION COULD CONSIDER THESE 
INDEPENDENTLY AND THEN THEY
