TURNAROUND WHERE THE TRASH      
TRUCK WOULD ACTUALLY BACK UP    
INTO THE BUILDING.              

01:26:03.514 --> 01:26:06.414

01:26:07.484 --> 01:26:09.884
DOCK.                           
SO THE MAIL AND THE BUILDING&apos;S  
DELIVERIES COULD BE DROPPED OFF 

01:26:09.886 --> 01:26:13.388
SO THE MAIL AND THE BUILDING&apos;S

01:26:15.525 --> 01:26:20.829
BE THE MAILROOM IN THE BACK

TEMPLATING FOR THAT NORTH SIDE  
OF THE BUILDING.                

01:26:32.776 --> 01:26:35.544
TEMPLATING FOR THAT NORTH SIDE  
OF THE BUILDING.                
BUT THE ACTUAL BUILDINGS        

01:26:35.546 --> 01:26:36.378
OF THE BUILDING.                
BUT THE ACTUAL BUILDINGS        
DELIVERIES AND DROP OFFS WOULD  

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:36.945
BUT THE ACTUAL BUILDINGS        
DELIVERIES AND DROP OFFS WOULD  
BE THROUGH THE LOADING DOCK     

01:26:36.947 --> 01:26:40.115
DELIVERIES AND DROP OFFS WOULD  
BE THROUGH THE LOADING DOCK     
WHICH IS OFF OF THAT ALLEY TO   

01:26:40.117 --> 01:26:40.649
BE THROUGH THE LOADING DOCK

WHICH IS OFF OF THAT ALLEY TO   
THE WEST SIDE.                  
SO THAT&apos;S WHERE AMAZON AND      

01:26:43.754 --> 01:26:44.753
THE WEST SIDE.

BE USED YOU WANT IT TO BE USED  
.                               
SO I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT     

01:30:42.425 --> 01:30:49.330
.                               
SO I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT     
EXPERIENCE SO IF PACKAGES       

01:30:49.332 --> 01:30:50.131
SO I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT     
EXPERIENCE SO IF PACKAGES       
OF SOME OF THE VEHICLES THAT    

01:30:50.133 --> 01:30:53.968
EXPERIENCE SO IF PACKAGES       
OF SOME OF THE VEHICLES THAT    
TEND TO STAY AROUND FOR A WHILE 

01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:54.769
OF SOME OF THE VEHICLES THAT    
TEND TO STAY AROUND FOR A WHILE 
ARE PARKED AND THEY AND THEY    

01:30:54.771 --> 01:30:57.605
TEND TO STAY AROUND FOR A WHILE 
ARE PARKED AND THEY AND THEY    
COME IN THAT KAPUTT I THINK     

01:30:57.607 --> 01:31:00.908
ARE PARKED AND THEY AND THEY    
COME IN THAT KAPUTT I THINK     
THAT&apos;S NOT A BAD SOLUTION.      

01:31:00.910 --> 01:31:01.942
COME IN THAT KAPUTT I THINK     
THAT&apos;S NOT A BAD SOLUTION.      
I MEAN I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT 

01:31:01.944 --> 01:31:04.679
THAT&apos;S NOT A BAD SOLUTION.      
I MEAN I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT 
DOUBLE PARKED OUT ON THE STREET 

01:31:04.681 --> 01:31:05.480
I MEAN I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT 
DOUBLE PARKED OUT ON THE STREET 
OR CERTAINLY IN THE BIKE LANE   

01:31:05.482 --> 01:31:08.850
DOUBLE PARKED OUT ON THE STREET 
OR CERTAINLY IN THE BIKE LANE   
AND THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN TURN  

01:31:08.852 --> 01:31:09.650
OR CERTAINLY IN THE BIKE LANE   
AND THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN TURN  
AROUND THERE I THINK IS REALLY  

01:31:09.652 --> 01:31:09.918
AND THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN TURN  
AROUND THERE I THINK IS REALLY  
HELPFUL.                        

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.785
AROUND THERE I THINK IS REALLY  
HELPFUL.                        
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAUGHT   

01:31:10.787 --> 01:31:13.054
HELPFUL.                        
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAUGHT   
MY EYE I&apos;M IN FAVOR OF BUILDING 

01:31:13.056 --> 01:31:16.958
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAUGHT   
MY EYE I&apos;M IN FAVOR OF BUILDING 
UP TO THE LINE BUT THERE IS A   

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.959
MY EYE I&apos;M IN FAVOR OF BUILDING 
UP TO THE LINE BUT THERE IS A   
LOT OF FOOT TRAFFIC AND A LOT   

01:31:17.961 --> 01:31:20.895
UP TO THE LINE BUT THERE IS A   
LOT OF FOOT TRAFFIC AND A LOT   
OF BICYCLE TRAFFIC AND THIS IS  

01:31:20.897 --> 01:31:21.496
LOT OF FOOT TRAFFIC AND A LOT   
OF BICYCLE TRAFFIC AND THIS IS  
LIKE FIVE FOOT TRAFFIC.         

01:31:21.498 --> 01:31:23.898
OF BICYCLE TRAFFIC AND THIS IS  
LIKE FIVE FOOT TRAFFIC.         
SO I&apos;M REALLY GLAD FIRST OF ALL 

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:24.699
LIKE FIVE FOOT TRAFFIC.         
SO I&apos;M REALLY GLAD FIRST OF ALL 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE BACKING  

01:31:24.701 --> 01:31:28.302
SO I&apos;M REALLY GLAD FIRST OF ALL 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE BACKING  
OUT BUT HAVING THAT FIVE FOOT I 

01:31:28.304 --> 01:31:29.137
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE BACKING  
OUT BUT HAVING THAT FIVE FOOT I 
THINK I THINK IT&apos;S GOING TO BE  

01:31:29.139 --> 01:31:32.273
OUT BUT HAVING THAT FIVE FOOT I 
THINK I THINK IT&apos;S GOING TO BE  
REAL HELPFUL JUST TO BE ABLE TO 

01:31:32.275 --> 01:31:35.676
THINK I THINK IT&apos;S GOING TO BE  
REAL HELPFUL JUST TO BE ABLE TO 
SEE PEDESTRIANS AND AND AND THE 

01:31:35.678 --> 01:31:36.478
REAL HELPFUL JUST TO BE ABLE TO 
SEE PEDESTRIANS AND AND AND THE 
OTHER REASON THAT IF THERE&apos;S    

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.379
SEE PEDESTRIANS AND AND AND THE 
OTHER REASON THAT IF THERE&apos;S    
ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAVING       

01:31:38.381 --> 01:31:39.180
OTHER REASON THAT IF THERE&apos;S    
ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAVING       
EXTERNAL ACCESS TO THAT BIKE    

01:31:39.182 --> 01:31:40.147
ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAVING       
EXTERNAL ACCESS TO THAT BIKE    
ROOM IS THAT IF THERE ARE BIKES 

01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:43.384
EXTERNAL ACCESS TO THAT BIKE    
ROOM IS THAT IF THERE ARE BIKES 
GOING IN THERE, IT&apos;S GOING TO   

01:31:43.386 --> 01:31:44.118
ROOM IS THAT IF THERE ARE BIKES 
GOING IN THERE, IT&apos;S GOING TO   
SLOW ANY TRAFFIC THAT DECIDES   

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:50.492
GOING IN THERE, IT&apos;S GOING TO   
SLOW ANY TRAFFIC THAT DECIDES   
TO USE THAT DOWN HOPEFULLY SO I 

01:31:50.494 --> 01:31:55.163
SLOW ANY TRAFFIC THAT DECIDES   
TO USE THAT DOWN HOPEFULLY SO I 
I APPRECIATE ALSO LOWER NOT     

01:31:55.165 --> 01:31:58.065
TO USE THAT DOWN HOPEFULLY SO I 
I APPRECIATE ALSO LOWER NOT     
HAVING MUCH PARKING VEHICULAR   

01:31:58.067 --> 01:31:58.733
I APPRECIATE ALSO LOWER NOT     
HAVING MUCH PARKING VEHICULAR   
PARKING I THINK THAT&apos;S GREAT.   

01:31:58.735 --> 01:32:02.169
HAVING MUCH PARKING VEHICULAR   
PARKING I THINK THAT&apos;S GREAT.   
I&apos;M CURIOUS WHILE YOU&apos;VE GOT    

01:32:02.171 --> 01:32:05.306
PARKING I THINK THAT&apos;S GREAT.   
I&apos;M CURIOUS WHILE YOU&apos;VE GOT    
THE SLIDES UP YOU SHOWED SOME   

01:32:05.308 --> 01:32:06.207
I&apos;M CURIOUS WHILE YOU&apos;VE GOT    
THE SLIDES UP YOU SHOWED SOME   
THERE&apos;S A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT   

01:32:06.209 --> 01:32:09.377
THE SLIDES UP YOU SHOWED SOME   
THERE&apos;S A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT   
IS THE FENCE ALONG THE EASTERN  

01:32:09.379 --> 01:32:10.344
THERE&apos;S A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT   
IS THE FENCE ALONG THE EASTERN  
PROPERTY LINE AND IS THE        

01:32:10.346 --> 01:32:10.945
IS THE FENCE ALONG THE EASTERN  
PROPERTY LINE AND IS THE        
PICTURE INDICATIVE OF KIND      

01:32:10.947 --> 01:32:15.750
PROPERTY LINE AND IS THE        
PICTURE INDICATIVE OF KIND      
OF THE WHAT YOU&apos;RE IMAGINING?   

01:32:15.752 --> 01:32:16.551
PICTURE INDICATIVE OF KIND      
OF THE WHAT YOU&apos;RE IMAGINING?   
THAT IS CORRECT.                

01:32:16.553 --> 01:32:17.685
OF THE WHAT YOU&apos;RE IMAGINING?   
THAT IS CORRECT.                
CAN YOU CLARIFY IS IT WOOD OR   

01:32:17.687 --> 01:32:19.954
THAT IS CORRECT.                
CAN YOU CLARIFY IS IT WOOD OR   
METAL?                          

01:32:19.956 --> 01:32:20.922
CAN YOU CLARIFY IS IT WOOD OR   
METAL?                          
I THOUGHT IT WAS A METAL FLAT   

01:32:20.924 --> 01:32:23.925
METAL?                          
I THOUGHT IT WAS A METAL FLAT   
SYSTEM BUT I&apos;M NOT 100 PERCENT  

01:32:23.927 --> 01:32:27.328
I THOUGHT IT WAS A METAL FLAT   
SYSTEM BUT I&apos;M NOT 100 PERCENT  
SURE IT&apos;S A METAL SYSTEM TO     

01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:27.996
SYSTEM BUT I&apos;M NOT 100 PERCENT  
SURE IT&apos;S A METAL SYSTEM TO     
FORWARD JUST WOULD FINISH BUT   

01:32:27.998 --> 01:32:30.565
SURE IT&apos;S A METAL SYSTEM TO     
FORWARD JUST WOULD FINISH BUT   
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE METAL SYSTEM   

01:32:30.567 --> 01:32:31.999
FORWARD JUST WOULD FINISH BUT   
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE METAL SYSTEM   
AND SO THERE IS A SIX FOOT TALL 

01:32:32.001 --> 01:32:34.702
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE METAL SYSTEM   
AND SO THERE IS A SIX FOOT TALL 
FENCE.                          

01:32:34.704 --> 01:32:35.803
AND SO THERE IS A SIX FOOT TALL 
FENCE.                          
WE DID WANT TO CREATE PRIVACY   

01:32:35.805 --> 01:32:39.240
FENCE.                          
WE DID WANT TO CREATE PRIVACY   
FOR THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORS AND  

01:32:39.242 --> 01:32:43.544
WE DID WANT TO CREATE PRIVACY   
FOR THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORS AND  
SO BY HAVING THIS SLADDEN WE    

01:32:43.546 --> 01:32:46.547
FOR THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORS AND  
SO BY HAVING THIS SLADDEN WE    
CAN STILL WANT A SOLID FENCE    

01:32:46.549 --> 01:32:47.681
SO BY HAVING THIS SLADDEN WE    
CAN STILL WANT A SOLID FENCE    
BUT WE CAN STILL GET A LOT      

01:32:47.683 --> 01:32:49.884
CAN STILL WANT A SOLID FENCE    
BUT WE CAN STILL GET A LOT      
OF OPACITY THAT WAY AND WE      

01:32:49.886 --> 01:32:50.651
BUT WE CAN STILL GET A LOT      
OF OPACITY THAT WAY AND WE      
DIDN&apos;T WANT TO POLLUTE THE      

01:32:50.653 --> 01:32:51.286
OF OPACITY THAT WAY AND WE      
DIDN&apos;T WANT TO POLLUTE THE      
ADJACENT PROPERTIES WITH OUR    

01:32:51.288 --> 01:32:53.888
DIDN&apos;T WANT TO POLLUTE THE      
ADJACENT PROPERTIES WITH OUR    
LIGHT AS WELL.                  

01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:54.789
ADJACENT PROPERTIES WITH OUR    
LIGHT AS WELL.                  
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE 

01:32:54.791 --> 01:32:55.223
LIGHT AS WELL.                  
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE 
CHOSE THAT.                     

01:32:55.225 --> 01:32:58.359
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE 
CHOSE THAT.                     
OK, THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING    

01:32:58.361 --> 01:32:58.693

BUT A LOT OF WHAT YOU SAID      
ABOUT THE LEASES MAKES ME THINK 
THAT I MEAN THERE WILL PROBABLY 

01:37:25.628 --> 01:37:28.429
ABOUT THE LEASES MAKES ME THINK 
THAT I MEAN THERE WILL PROBABLY 
BE A LOT OF STUDENTS BUT LIKE   

01:37:28.431 --> 01:37:29.463
THAT I MEAN THERE WILL PROBABLY 
BE A LOT OF STUDENTS BUT LIKE   
I&apos;M TRYING TO PRETEND LIKE I&apos;M  

01:37:29.465 --> 01:37:32.566
BE A LOT OF STUDENTS BUT LIKE   
I&apos;M TRYING TO PRETEND LIKE I&apos;M  
NOT AS OLD AS I AM AND I&apos;M LIKE 

01:37:32.568 --> 01:37:33.468
I&apos;M TRYING TO PRETEND LIKE I&apos;M  
NOT AS OLD AS I AM AND I&apos;M LIKE 
MY YOUNG TWENTIES AND I&apos;M NOT A 

01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:34.201
NOT AS OLD AS I AM AND I&apos;M LIKE 
MY YOUNG TWENTIES AND I&apos;M NOT A 
STUDENT BUT I MIGHT WANT TO     

01:37:34.203 --> 01:37:35.002
MY YOUNG TWENTIES AND I&apos;M NOT A 
STUDENT BUT I MIGHT WANT TO     
LIVE DOWNTOWN AND IT MAKES ME   

01:37:35.004 --> 01:37:37.138
STUDENT BUT I MIGHT WANT TO     
LIVE DOWNTOWN AND IT MAKES ME   
CURIOUS ABOUT THE APPROACH TO   

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:40.541
LIVE DOWNTOWN AND IT MAKES ME   
CURIOUS ABOUT THE APPROACH TO   
SOUND PROOFING BETWEEN UNITS    

01:37:40.543 --> 01:37:41.442
CURIOUS ABOUT THE APPROACH TO   
SOUND PROOFING BETWEEN UNITS    
AND WHAT YOU&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT  

01:37:41.444 --> 01:37:44.411
SOUND PROOFING BETWEEN UNITS    
AND WHAT YOU&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT  
THERE IS A DESIGN TO ANY        

01:37:44.413 --> 01:37:48.248
AND WHAT YOU&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT  
THERE IS A DESIGN TO ANY        
SPECIFIC SCREENING WOULD BE     

01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:48.949
THERE IS A DESIGN TO ANY        
SPECIFIC SCREENING WOULD BE     
BETTER WOULD KNOW BETTER BUT    

01:37:48.951 --> 01:37:51.452
SPECIFIC SCREENING WOULD BE     
BETTER WOULD KNOW BETTER BUT    
THERE IS A SIT DOWN             

01:37:51.454 --> 01:37:52.152
BETTER WOULD KNOW BETTER BUT    
THERE IS A SIT DOWN             
TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENT THAT   

01:37:52.154 --> 01:37:56.023
THERE IS A SIT DOWN             
TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENT THAT   
WE DESIGNED TO WHERE THERE IS   

01:37:56.025 --> 01:37:56.791
TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENT THAT   
WE DESIGNED TO WHERE THERE IS   
SOUND INSULATION BETWEEN UNITS  

01:37:56.793 --> 01:37:59.593
WE DESIGNED TO WHERE THERE IS   
SOUND INSULATION BETWEEN UNITS  
AND ACTUALLY BETWEEN BEDROOMS.  

01:37:59.595 --> 01:38:00.661
SOUND INSULATION BETWEEN UNITS  
AND ACTUALLY BETWEEN BEDROOMS.  
SO THAT SOUND TRANSMISSION IS   

01:38:00.663 --> 01:38:02.730
AND ACTUALLY BETWEEN BEDROOMS.  
SO THAT SOUND TRANSMISSION IS   
NOT AN ISSUE.                   

01:38:02.732 --> 01:38:03.865
SO THAT SOUND TRANSMISSION IS   
NOT AN ISSUE.                   
WE OPERATE A LOT OF STUDENT     

01:38:03.867 --> 01:38:06.967
NOT AN ISSUE.                   
WE OPERATE A LOT OF STUDENT     
HOUSING PROPERTIES.             

01:38:06.969 --> 01:38:08.001
WE OPERATE A LOT OF STUDENT     
HOUSING PROPERTIES.             
WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL BE     

01:38:08.003 --> 01:38:11.372
HOUSING PROPERTIES.             
WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL BE     
VERY ATTRACTIVE TO A STUDENT    

01:38:11.374 --> 01:38:14.475
WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL BE     
VERY ATTRACTIVE TO A STUDENT    
RESIDENT AND SO WE WOULD EXPECT 

01:38:14.477 --> 01:38:15.443
VERY ATTRACTIVE TO A STUDENT    
RESIDENT AND SO WE WOULD EXPECT 
A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE THAT     

01:38:15.445 --> 01:38:16.176
RESIDENT AND SO WE WOULD EXPECT 
A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE THAT     
SOMETIMES COMES WITH REALLY     

01:38:16.178 --> 01:38:18.946
A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE THAT     
SOMETIMES COMES WITH REALLY     
SPENDING THE MONEY ON THE THE   

01:38:18.948 --> 01:38:22.816
SOMETIMES COMES WITH REALLY     
SPENDING THE MONEY ON THE THE   
SOUND DAMPENING BETWEEN UNIT    

01:38:22.818 --> 01:38:23.151
SPENDING THE MONEY ON THE THE   
SOUND DAMPENING BETWEEN UNIT    
WALLS.                          

01:38:23.153 --> 01:38:24.184
SOUND DAMPENING BETWEEN UNIT    
WALLS.                          
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW ASHWINI, IF YOU 

01:38:24.186 --> 01:38:25.753
WALLS.                          
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW ASHWINI, IF YOU 
COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT    

01:38:25.755 --> 01:38:26.788
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW ASHWINI, IF YOU 
COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT    
I&apos;M NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT BUT   

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:27.655
COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT    
I&apos;M NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT BUT   
THERE IS A SOUND TRANSMISSION   

01:38:27.657 --> 01:38:30.023
I&apos;M NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT BUT   
THERE IS A SOUND TRANSMISSION   
COEFFICIENT.                    

01:38:30.025 --> 01:38:31.191
THERE IS A SOUND TRANSMISSION   
COEFFICIENT.                    
I KNOW THE NUMBERS AND I KNOW   

01:38:31.193 --> 01:38:32.259
COEFFICIENT.                    
I KNOW THE NUMBERS AND I KNOW   
IF THAT IS SO YOU TELL ME SO IF

OBVIOUSLY THAT MAKES FOR A      

01:41:44.187 --> 01:41:44.986
THE DESIGN IS GREAT.            
OBVIOUSLY THAT MAKES FOR A      
BASELINE AND MOST RAZIE DOESN&apos;T

THAT.                           

01:41:54.764 --> 01:41:55.696
I&apos;M GOING TO LET YOU SPEAK TO   
THAT.                           
I THINK WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE   

01:41:55.698 --> 01:41:58.698
THAT.                           
I THINK WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE   
WILLING TO DO THAT SO THE       

01:41:58.700 --> 01:41:59.467
I THINK WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE   
WILLING TO DO THAT SO THE       
INTENT WAS ACTUALLY TO COMPLY   

01:41:59.469 --> 01:42:00.200
WILLING TO DO THAT SO THE       
INTENT WAS ACTUALLY TO COMPLY   
WITH THE UTC BEFORE IT WAS      

01:42:00.202 --> 01:42:03.236
INTENT WAS ACTUALLY TO COMPLY   
WITH THE UTC BEFORE IT WAS      
AMENDED AND THERE WERE CERTAIN  

01:42:03.238 --> 01:42:06.406
WITH THE UTC BEFORE IT WAS      
AMENDED AND THERE WERE CERTAIN  
FAAB BONUSES RELATED TO         

01:42:06.408 --> 01:42:07.108
AMENDED AND THERE WERE CERTAIN  
FAAB BONUSES RELATED TO         
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LEAD.       

01:42:07.110 --> 01:42:07.908
FAAB BONUSES RELATED TO         
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LEAD.       
I BELIEVE THAT REQUIRED         

01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:10.077
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LEAD.       
I BELIEVE THAT REQUIRED         
CERTIFICATION AND WE WERE READY 

01:42:10.079 --> 01:42:10.511
I BELIEVE THAT REQUIRED         
CERTIFICATION AND WE WERE READY 
TO DO THAT.                     

01:42:10.513 --> 01:42:11.378
CERTIFICATION AND WE WERE READY 
TO DO THAT.                     
SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD   

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:11.979
TO DO THAT.
