HUD TERMINOLOGY AND THEY        
CALCULATE IT EVERY YEAR AND     
IT&apos;S BASED ON THE FORTIETH      

00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:00.226
CALCULATE IT EVERY YEAR AND

00:19:40.641 --> 00:19:41.940
WHAT IS THE LARGEST SOURCE      
OF SUBSIDY FOR HOUSING.         
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART ON THE 

00:19:41.942 --> 00:19:44.709

THAT IS WHAT&apos;S KEEPING MY       

00:22:51.165 --> 00:22:51.831
BALLOT LANGUAGE LOOKS LIKE AND  
THAT IS WHAT&apos;S KEEPING MY       
PROJECT AFLOAT BECAUSE IF WE    

00:22:51.833 --> 00:22:52.564
THAT IS WHAT&apos;S KEEPING MY       
PROJECT AFLOAT BECAUSE IF WE    
DIDN&apos;T HAVE THAT AFFORDABLE     

00:22:52.566 --> 00:22:55.501
PROJECT AFLOAT BECAUSE IF WE    
DIDN&apos;T HAVE THAT AFFORDABLE     
HOUSING, I DO NOT KNOW HOW I    

00:22:55.503 --> 00:22:56.302
DIDN&apos;T HAVE THAT AFFORDABLE

01:15:24.415 --> 01:15:25.414
OF ANN ARBOR WE HAVE OUR OWN    
RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM.      
SO I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO   

01:15:25.416 --> 01:15:28.584
RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM.      
SO I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO   
FIND OUT WHAT&apos;S IN ANN ARBOR IS 

01:15:28.586 --> 01:15:29.251
SO I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO   
FIND OUT WHAT&apos;S IN ANN ARBOR IS 
THROUGH OUR OWN RENTAL          

01:15:29.253 --> 01:15:29.785
FIND OUT WHAT&apos;S IN ANN ARBOR IS 
THROUGH OUR OWN RENTAL

01:15:29.787 --> 01:15:32.722
THROUGH OUR OWN RENTAL          
INSPECTION PROGRAM.             
BUT AS I SAID EARLIER, MOST     

01:15:32.724 --> 01:15:33.388
INSPECTION PROGRAM.             
BUT AS I SAID EARLIER, MOST     
OF OUR VOUCHERS ARE NOT         

01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:34.056

OF OUR VOUCHERS ARE NOT         
ACTUALLY UTILIZED IN THE CITY   

01:15:34.058 --> 01:15:34.523
