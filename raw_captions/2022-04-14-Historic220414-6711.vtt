I THINK THAT TURNING THE        

00:23:58.745 --> 00:24:01.680
IN.

DRIVEWAY IS KIND OF I THINK     

00:24:02.449 --> 00:24:03.148
DOORWAY, YOU KNOW, TOWARD THE   
DRIVEWAY IS KIND OF I THINK     
DIFFERENT ENOUGH FROM THE       

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:03.816
DRIVEWAY IS KIND OF I THINK     
DIFFERENT ENOUGH FROM THE       
NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE     

00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:06.151
DIFFERENT ENOUGH FROM THE       
NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE

00:24:10.056 --> 00:24:10.722
FROM THE BACK AND IT&amp;apos;S NOT IN.  
SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S CLEARLY PART    
OF THE ADDITION AND SEPARATE    

00:24:10.724 --> 00:24:13.625
SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S CLEARLY PART    
OF THE ADDITION AND SEPARATE    
AND THE SCALE IS STILL I THINK  

00:24:13.627 --> 00:24:17.262
OF THE ADDITION AND SEPARATE    
AND THE SCALE IS STILL I THINK  
NICELY DONE IN RELATION TO THE  

00:24:17.264 --> 00:24:18.029
AND THE SCALE IS STILL I THINK  
NICELY DONE IN RELATION TO THE  
REST OF THE HOUSE AND THE       

00:24:18.031 --> 00:24:21.033
NICELY DONE IN RELATION TO THE  
REST OF THE HOUSE AND THE       
PROPORTIONS I THINK THE WINDOWS 

00:24:21.035 --> 00:24:24.368
REST OF THE HOUSE AND THE       
PROPORTIONS I THINK THE WINDOWS 
AS THEY&amp;apos;VE BEEN DESIGNED OR     

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:28.406
PROPORTIONS I THINK THE WINDOWS 
AS THEY&amp;apos;VE BEEN DESIGNED OR     
MODERN ENOUGH THAT THEY         

00:24:28.408 --> 00:24:29.107

MODERN ENOUGH THAT THEY         
DEFINITELY LOOK I THINK         

00:24:29.109 --> 00:24:29.841
MODERN ENOUGH THAT THEY         
DEFINITELY LOOK I THINK         
DISTINCT FROM FROM THE EXISTING 

00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:33.010
DEFINITELY LOOK I THINK         
DISTINCT FROM FROM THE EXISTING 
WINDOWS AND MUCH NEWER AND      

00:24:33.012 --> 00:24:36.214
DISTINCT FROM FROM THE EXISTING

TREATMENT UM, THE ONLY OTHER    
THING I WAS TRYING TO LOOK AT   

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.318
TREATMENT UM, THE ONLY OTHER    
THING I WAS TRYING TO LOOK AT   
THE FOUNDATION YOU CAN SEE THE  

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.052
THING I WAS TRYING TO LOOK AT   
THE FOUNDATION YOU CAN SEE THE  
COOKSTOWN FOUNDATION OF THE     

00:24:41.054 --> 00:24:44.055
THE FOUNDATION YOU CAN SEE THE  
COOKSTOWN FOUNDATION OF THE     
ORIGINAL HOUSE IF YOU WALK      

00:24:44.057 --> 00:24:44.856
COOKSTOWN FOUNDATION OF THE     
ORIGINAL HOUSE IF YOU WALK      
AROUND I THINK TO THE WEST SIDE 

00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:47.793
ORIGINAL HOUSE IF YOU WALK      
AROUND I THINK TO THE WEST SIDE 
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE SIDING GOES PRETTY 

00:24:47.795 --> 00:24:48.460
AROUND I THINK TO THE WEST SIDE 
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE SIDING GOES PRETTY 
FAR DOWN TO TWO DEGREE.         

00:24:48.462 --> 00:24:51.096
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE SIDING GOES PRETTY

SO IT&amp;apos;S REALLY NOT VERY VISIBLE 

00:24:51.098 --> 00:24:51.896
FAR DOWN TO TWO DEGREE.         
SO IT&amp;apos;S REALLY NOT VERY VISIBLE
