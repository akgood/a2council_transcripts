IS A LOT OF CONTINUED           
EXPLOITATION OR EFFORTS TO      
CREATE LOOPHOLES TO GET AROUND  

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:03.436

01:39:03.438 --> 01:39:05.971
CREATE LOOPHOLES TO GET AROUND  
THE INTENT OF THE ORDINANCE.    
I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE SOME    

01:39:05.973 --> 01:39:06.739
THE INTENT OF THE ORDINANCE.    
I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE SOME

AND WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE AS 
I MENTIONED LAST LAST MEETING   

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:10.676
AND WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE AS

PROTECTING OUR RESIDENTS AND    

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:36.936
AND FINALLY I WILL ALSO SAY     
THAT I JUST THINK THIS IS THE   
REASON THAT WE CREATED THE      

01:39:36.938 --> 01:39:37.470
THAT I JUST THINK THIS IS THE   
REASON THAT WE CREATED THE      
RENTERS COMMISSION.             

01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:38.237
REASON THAT WE CREATED THE      
RENTERS COMMISSION.             
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A         

01:39:38.239 --> 01:39:38.804

WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A         
DRAMATIC POWER IMBALANCE.       

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:39.471
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A         
DRAMATIC POWER IMBALANCE.       
WE KNOW THAT WE NEEDED A        

01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:40.006
DRAMATIC POWER IMBALANCE.       
WE KNOW THAT WE NEEDED A        
PROCESS FOR FOUR FOUR           

01:39:40.008 --> 01:39:40.873
WE KNOW THAT WE NEEDED A        
PROCESS FOR FOUR FOUR           
ORDINANCES LIKE THIS AND OTHERS 

01:39:40.875 --> 01:39:41.474

03:34:49.777 --> 03:34:50.509
THAT WE EXPECT TO PREVENT BY    
PROHIBITING RIGHT TURN ON RED   
AND THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL    

03:34:50.511 --> 03:34:53.278
PROHIBITING RIGHT TURN ON RED

TURNING WHEN THEY HAVE THE      
GREEN LIGHT AND A PEDESTRIAN    

03:34:56.383 --> 03:34:57.082
TURNING WHEN THEY HAVE THE

03:34:57.084 --> 03:34:59.918
GREEN LIGHT AND A PEDESTRIAN    
POTENTIALLY HAVE THE WRONG

POTENTIALLY HAVE THE WRONG      
SIGNAL.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS IS KIND OF DIFFICULT 

03:35:01.155 --> 03:35:02.020
SIGNAL.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS IS KIND OF DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE REALLY WE HAVE TO LOOK  

03:35:02.022 --> 03:35:04.289
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS IS KIND OF DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE REALLY WE HAVE TO LOOK  
AT THE HISTORIC TRENDS IN ORDER 

03:35:04.291 --> 03:35:05.023
BECAUSE REALLY WE HAVE TO LOOK  
AT THE HISTORIC TRENDS IN ORDER

03:35:07.895 --> 03:35:08.961
TO KIND OF SPECULATE WHAT THE   
FUTURE IMPACT WOULD BE.         
AND SO REALLY THIS GETS BACK TO 

03:35:08.963 --> 03:35:09.695
FUTURE IMPACT WOULD BE.         
AND SO REALLY THIS GETS BACK TO 
WHAT&amp;apos;S IDENTIFIED IN THE        

03:35:09.697 --> 03:35:12.364
AND SO REALLY THIS GETS BACK TO 
WHAT&amp;apos;S IDENTIFIED IN THE        
SUPPLEMENTAL MEMO THAT THE      

03:35:12.366 --> 03:35:13.165

03:35:15.736 --> 03:35:18.870
THREE CRASHES THAT WERE

WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE THAT    

03:35:18.872 --> 03:35:19.905

PORT HURON WAS ONE BECAUSE ALL  
THE BUSSES THAT ARE COMING OUT  

03:39:24.284 --> 03:39:25.216
PORT HURON WAS ONE BECAUSE ALL  
THE BUSSES THAT ARE COMING OUT

,I THINK IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO CAUSE    
PEOPLE TO TRY TO TURN ON GREEN  

03:43:13.014 --> 03:43:16.815
,I THINK IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO CAUSE    
PEOPLE TO TRY TO TURN ON GREEN  
UH AT TIMES WHERE IT&amp;apos;S IN       

03:43:16.817 --> 03:43:20.618
PEOPLE TO TRY TO TURN ON GREEN  
UH AT TIMES WHERE IT&amp;apos;S IN       
CONFLICT WITH DEATH SYRIANS WHO 

03:43:20.620 --> 03:43:21.386
UH AT TIMES WHERE IT&amp;apos;S IN       
CONFLICT WITH DEATH SYRIANS WHO 
ARE MOVING IN THE SAME          

03:43:21.388 --> 03:43:24.790
CONFLICT WITH DEATH SYRIANS WHO

DIRECTION BECAUSE LIKE WHAT YOU 

03:43:24.792 --> 03:43:25.457
ARE MOVING IN THE SAME          
DIRECTION BECAUSE LIKE WHAT YOU 
JUST SAID BECAUSE REMEMBER      

03:43:25.459 --> 03:43:28.660
DIRECTION BECAUSE LIKE WHAT YOU 
JUST SAID BECAUSE REMEMBER      
HAYNER THEY MAYBE HAVE BEEN     

03:43:28.662 --> 03:43:32.864
JUST SAID BECAUSE REMEMBER      
HAYNER THEY MAYBE HAVE BEEN     
WAITING HERE FOR THREE, FOUR OR 

03:43:32.866 --> 03:43:33.565
HAYNER THEY MAYBE HAVE BEEN     
WAITING HERE FOR THREE, FOUR OR 
FIVE MINUTES AND FRUSTRATED AND 

03:43:33.567 --> 03:43:36.167
WAITING HERE FOR THREE, FOUR OR 
FIVE MINUTES AND FRUSTRATED AND 
GOING TO TAKE SOME CHANCES THAT 

03:43:36.169 --> 03:43:40.105
FIVE MINUTES AND FRUSTRATED AND 
GOING TO TAKE SOME CHANCES THAT 
ARE NOT GOING TO BE POSITIVE.   

03:43:40.107 --> 03:43:46.945
GOING TO TAKE SOME CHANCES THAT 
ARE NOT GOING TO BE POSITIVE.   
AND SO I HOPE THAT              

03:44:01.227 --> 03:44:03.694
                   AFTER THIS   
PASSES THAT THERE ARE OTHER     
INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES    

03:44:03.696 --> 03:44:04.363
PASSES THAT THERE ARE OTHER     
INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES    
THAT ARE DEPLOYED THAT IMPROVE  

03:44:04.365 --> 03:44:05.096
INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES    
THAT ARE DEPLOYED THAT IMPROVE  
SAFETY.                         

03:44:05.098 --> 03:44:06.497
THAT ARE DEPLOYED THAT IMPROVE  
SAFETY.                         
UH, I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A     

03:44:06.499 --> 03:44:07.232
SAFETY.                         
UH, I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A     
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.    

03:44:07.234 --> 03:44:07.966
UH, I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A     
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.    
BUT IF THIS IS IF NOTHING ELSE  

03:44:07.968 --> 03:44:08.767
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.    
BUT IF THIS IS IF NOTHING ELSE  
IS FOLLOWED UP, THIS IS GOING   

03:44:08.769 --> 03:44:09.700
BUT IF THIS IS IF NOTHING ELSE  
IS FOLLOWED UP, THIS IS GOING   
TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR  

03:44:09.702 --> 03:44:10.736
IS FOLLOWED UP, THIS IS GOING   
TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR  
TWO ZERO GOALS GOING TO BE      

03:44:10.738 --> 03:44:14.206
TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR  
TWO ZERO GOALS GOING TO BE      
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO QUALITY    

03:44:14.208 --> 03:44:14.806
TWO ZERO GOALS GOING TO BE      
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO QUALITY    
OF LIVING STANDARDS.            

03:44:14.808 --> 03:44:15.406
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO QUALITY    
OF LIVING STANDARDS.            
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE                

03:44:15.408 --> 03:44:16.007
OF LIVING STANDARDS.            
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE                
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO            

03:44:16.009 --> 03:44:18.877
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE                
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO            
AFFORDABILITY, MIGHT BE EVEN    

03:44:18.879 --> 03:44:19.611
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO            
AFFORDABILITY, MIGHT BE EVEN    
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO SAFETY.    

03:44:19.613 --> 03:44:26.318
AFFORDABILITY, MIGHT BE EVEN    
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO SAFETY.    
SO THOSE ARE REAL THINGS.       

03:44:26.320 --> 03:44:26.985
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO SAFETY.    
SO THOSE ARE REAL THINGS.

AND LATER ON WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 
ELDERLY DRIVERS, THE DANGERS    

03:47:16.556 --> 03:47:17.289
AND LATER ON WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 
ELDERLY DRIVERS, THE DANGERS    
AND THE NUMBER OF CRASHES       

03:47:17.291 --> 03:47:20.825
ELDERLY DRIVERS, THE DANGERS    
AND THE NUMBER OF CRASHES       
INVOLVING NOT ONLY THE DRIVERS  

03:47:20.827 --> 03:47:21.660
AND THE NUMBER OF CRASHES       
INVOLVING NOT ONLY THE DRIVERS  
YOU KNOW I THINK OF THE PEOPLE  

03:47:21.662 --> 03:47:24.395
INVOLVING NOT ONLY THE DRIVERS  
YOU KNOW I THINK OF THE PEOPLE  
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHO WHO      

03:47:24.397 --> 03:47:25.130
YOU KNOW I THINK OF THE PEOPLE  
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHO WHO

03:47:25.132 --> 03:47:25.797
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHO WHO      
STRUGGLE WITH MAKING SURE THEIR 
PARENTS ARE DRIVING SAFELY      

03:47:25.799 --> 03:47:28.667
STRUGGLE WITH MAKING SURE THEIR 
PARENTS ARE DRIVING SAFELY      
ELDERLY PARENTS ARE DRIVING     

03:47:28.669 --> 03:47:29.101
PARENTS ARE DRIVING SAFELY      
ELDERLY PARENTS ARE DRIVING     
SAFELY.

ELDERLY PARENTS ARE DRIVING     
SAFELY.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO TURNING RIGHT ON RIGHT IS 

03:47:32.572 --> 03:47:33.037
SAFELY.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO TURNING RIGHT ON RIGHT IS 
NOT A RIGHT.                    

03:47:33.039 --> 03:47:36.274
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO TURNING RIGHT ON RIGHT IS 
NOT A RIGHT.                    
WE EXERCISE YIELDING ALL THE    

03:47:36.276 --> 03:47:36.508
NOT A RIGHT.                    
WE EXERCISE YIELDING ALL THE

WE EXERCISE YIELDING ALL THE    
TIME.                           
SO YOU KNOW, I I WOULD THINK    

03:47:37.844 --> 03:47:40.945
TIME.                           
SO YOU KNOW, I I WOULD THINK    
THAT TO YIELD OR NOT TO YIELD   

03:47:40.947 --> 03:47:41.746
SO YOU KNOW, I I WOULD THINK    
THAT TO YIELD OR NOT TO YIELD   
IS IS NOT REALLY A QUESTION.    

03:47:41.748 --> 03:47:44.082
THAT TO YIELD OR NOT TO YIELD   
IS IS NOT REALLY A QUESTION.    
IT&amp;apos;S YIELD WE PRACTICES ALL THE 

03:47:44.084 --> 03:47:47.552
IS IS NOT REALLY A QUESTION.    
IT&amp;apos;S YIELD WE PRACTICES ALL THE 
TIME IN INTERSECTIONS WHEN WE   

03:47:47.554 --> 03:47:51.422
IT&amp;apos;S YIELD WE PRACTICES ALL THE 
TIME IN INTERSECTIONS WHEN WE   
ENCOUNTER PEDESTRIANS TO AFFIRM 

03:47:51.424 --> 03:47:52.323
TIME IN INTERSECTIONS WHEN WE   
ENCOUNTER PEDESTRIANS TO AFFIRM 
THIS SHOULD NOT BE A DIFFICULT  

03:47:52.325 --> 03:47:52.657
ENCOUNTER PEDESTRIANS TO AFFIRM 
THIS SHOULD NOT BE A DIFFICULT  
THING.                          

03:47:52.659 --> 03:47:55.927
THIS SHOULD NOT BE A DIFFICULT  
THING.                          
I THINK ARBOR IS CAPABLE ITS    

03:47:55.929 --> 03:47:59.363
THING.                          
I THINK ARBOR IS CAPABLE ITS    
RESIDENTS ARE CAPABLE KNOWING   

03:47:59.365 --> 03:48:00.031
I THINK ARBOR IS CAPABLE ITS    
RESIDENTS ARE CAPABLE KNOWING   
THAT THIS CRASH DATA IS         

03:48:00.033 --> 03:48:03.101
RESIDENTS ARE CAPABLE KNOWING   
THAT THIS CRASH DATA IS         
AVAILABLE IF YOU CONSIDER

I THOUGHT I HEARD COUNCILOR

I THOUGHT I HEARD COUNCILOR     
GRISWOLD SAY THERE WOULD BE     

04:36:56.533 --> 04:36:57.065
I THOUGHT I HEARD COUNCILOR     
GRISWOLD SAY THERE WOULD BE     
AGGRESSIVE PROACTIVE            

04:36:57.067 --> 04:37:00.536
GRISWOLD SAY THERE WOULD BE     
AGGRESSIVE PROACTIVE            
ENFORCEMENT SEPARATE FROM       

04:37:00.538 --> 04:37:01.136
AGGRESSIVE PROACTIVE            
ENFORCEMENT SEPARATE FROM       
COMMUNITY STANDARDS.            

04:37:01.138 --> 04:37:01.736
ENFORCEMENT SEPARATE FROM       
COMMUNITY STANDARDS.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THAT CORRECT?             

04:37:01.738 --> 04:37:08.811
COMMUNITY STANDARDS.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THAT CORRECT?             
NO, NOT NECESSARILY SEPARATE    

04:37:08.813 --> 04:37:09.577
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THAT CORRECT?             
NO, NOT NECESSARILY SEPARATE    
BUT IT WOULD START WITH         

04:37:09.579 --> 04:37:13.648
NO, NOT NECESSARILY SEPARATE    
BUT IT WOULD START WITH         
EDUCATION AND NOTICES AND       

04:37:13.650 --> 04:37:16.885
BUT IT WOULD START WITH         
EDUCATION AND NOTICES AND       
DEVELOP INTO A STANDARD AND     

04:37:16.887 --> 04:37:17.820

I&amp;apos;LL LEAVE THAT UP TO THE LEGAL 
DEPARTMENT FOR WHAT THEY&amp;apos;RE

DIFFERENT APPROACH TO           
ENFORCEMENT.                    
IT WOULD STILL BE ENFORCED BY   

04:37:36.574 --> 04:37:37.172
ENFORCEMENT.

04:37:37.174 --> 04:37:39.975
IT WOULD STILL BE ENFORCED BY

I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND SOME    

04:37:39.977 --> 04:37:40.909

I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND SOME    
OF WHAT WE ARE DRAFTING IS TO

POSSIBLE SO THAT IT COULD BE    
MORE EFFECTIVELY ENFORCED BY

04:37:51.021 --> 04:37:51.887
