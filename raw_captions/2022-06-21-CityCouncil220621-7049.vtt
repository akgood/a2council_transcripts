SO JUST CLARIFICATION THIS THIS 
IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CASE THAT    
WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM COUNCIL.    

01:00:02.445 --> 01:00:03.445
IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CASE THAT    
WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM COUNCIL.    
THIS WAS THERE WAS NO PROPOSED  

01:00:03.447 --> 01:00:06.748
WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM COUNCIL.    
THIS WAS THERE WAS NO PROPOSED  
RODWAY RECONFIGURATION IN THIS  

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:07.382
THIS WAS THERE WAS NO PROPOSED  
RODWAY RECONFIGURATION IN THIS  
SEGMENT SO THIS NEVER WOULD     

01:00:07.384 --> 01:00:08.182
RODWAY RECONFIGURATION IN THIS  
SEGMENT SO THIS NEVER WOULD     
HAVE COME TO COME TO COUNCIL    

01:00:08.184 --> 01:00:10.518
SEGMENT SO THIS NEVER WOULD     
HAVE COME TO COME TO COUNCIL    
UNDER THAT PREVIOUS POLICY.     

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.586
HAVE COME TO COME TO COUNCIL    
UNDER THAT PREVIOUS POLICY.     
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT  

01:00:11.588 --> 01:00:14.823
UNDER THAT PREVIOUS POLICY.     
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT  
OUT THAT IN EVERY INSTANCE WHEN 

01:00:14.825 --> 01:00:15.490
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT  
OUT THAT IN EVERY INSTANCE WHEN 
THERE WAS A RECONFIGURATION     

01:00:15.492 --> 01:00:16.224
OUT THAT IN EVERY INSTANCE WHEN 
THERE WAS A RECONFIGURATION     
UNDER THE OTHER POLICY THEY

01:00:17.628 --> 01:00:18.893
UNDER THE OTHER POLICY THEY     
WERE ALL VOTED DOWN.

01:00:18.895 --> 01:00:19.294
WERE ALL VOTED DOWN.            
SO I THINK IT WAS MORE OF A     
VETO OPTION.                    

01:00:19.296 --> 01:00:22.130
SO I THINK IT WAS MORE OF A

TRANSPORTATION PLAN.            
SO YOU&amp;apos;VE ACTUALLY ALREADY      
APPROVED THIS AS AN ALL AGES

SO THAT&amp;apos;S THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO

01:00:56.666 --> 01:00:59.534
SO THAT&amp;apos;S THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO 
LINE IT IN TERMS OF COST ROAD   
RECONFIGURATIONS ARE TYPICALLY  

01:00:59.536 --> 01:01:00.501
LINE IT IN TERMS OF COST ROAD   
RECONFIGURATIONS ARE TYPICALLY  
ABOUT PAINT ON THE GROUND SO    

01:01:00.503 --> 01:01:01.069
RECONFIGURATIONS ARE TYPICALLY  
ABOUT PAINT ON THE GROUND SO    
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT A HUGE COST.         

01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:04.239
ABOUT PAINT ON THE GROUND SO

HOWEVER, ALL AGES AND ABILITY   
ROUTE ON A ROAD LIKE THAT I     

01:01:04.975 --> 01:01:07.976
HOWEVER, ALL AGES AND ABILITY   
ROUTE ON A ROAD LIKE THAT I     
COULD IMAGINE STAFF MIGHT COME  

01:01:07.978 --> 01:01:08.777
ROUTE ON A ROAD LIKE THAT I     
COULD IMAGINE STAFF MIGHT COME  
BACK IN AND BELIEVE THAT POST   

01:01:08.779 --> 01:01:11.179
COULD IMAGINE STAFF MIGHT COME  
BACK IN AND BELIEVE THAT POST   
AND DELINEATOR MIGHT ALSO BE    

01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:11.579
BACK IN AND BELIEVE THAT POST   
AND DELINEATOR MIGHT ALSO BE    
APPROPRIATE.                    

01:01:11.581 --> 01:01:15.217
AND DELINEATOR MIGHT ALSO BE    
APPROPRIATE.                    
BUT I DIDN&amp;apos;T WANT TO PUT THAT   

01:01:15.219 --> 01:01:15.950
APPROPRIATE.                    
BUT I DIDN&amp;apos;T WANT TO PUT THAT   
INTO THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE I   

01:01:15.952 --> 01:01:16.551
BUT I DIDN&amp;apos;T WANT TO PUT THAT   
INTO THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE I   
FELT LIKE THAT MIGHT BE         

01:01:16.553 --> 01:01:18.986
INTO THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE I   
FELT LIKE THAT MIGHT BE         
MICROMANAGING THE DESIGN.       

01:01:18.988 --> 01:01:20.154
FELT LIKE THAT MIGHT BE         
MICROMANAGING THE DESIGN.       
SO I THINK THAT THEY ARE MORE   

01:01:20.156 --> 01:01:20.822
MICROMANAGING THE DESIGN.       
SO I THINK THAT THEY ARE MORE

BUT WORKPLACE SAFETY AND        

01:14:58.507 --> 01:14:59.173

BUT WORKPLACE SAFETY AND        
QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE AND  

01:14:59.175 --> 01:15:01.475
BUT WORKPLACE SAFETY AND        
QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE AND
