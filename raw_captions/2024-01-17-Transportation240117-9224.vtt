00:48:43.344 --> 00:48:44.143
FOR EXAMPLE, RED LIGHT CAMERAS  
ARE ONE SO THEY&apos;RE SPEEDING     
THEN ANOTHER COMMON APPLICATION 

00:48:44.145 --> 00:48:47.546

SO YEAH, DOES THE SECOND BULLET 

00:57:25.532 --> 00:57:26.431
REMOVED WITHOUT CONCERN.        
SO YEAH, DOES THE SECOND BULLET 
POINT WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT IS IT 

00:57:26.433 --> 00:57:27.832
SO YEAH, DOES THE SECOND BULLET 
POINT WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT IS IT 
REDUNDANT?                      

00:57:27.834 --> 00:57:28.834
POINT WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT IS IT 
REDUNDANT?                      
WELL, THE ONE THING I WOULD     

00:57:28.836 --> 00:57:29.634
REDUNDANT?

MAYBE JUST IF I MAY CHECK THE   

00:57:29.636 --> 00:57:30.402
WELL, THE ONE THING I WOULD     
MAYBE JUST IF I MAY CHECK THE   
THOUGHT IS UP ABOVE WHERE WE    

00:57:30.404 --> 00:57:30.935
MAYBE JUST IF I MAY CHECK THE   
THOUGHT IS UP ABOVE WHERE WE    
TALK ABOUT NEW REVENUES.        

00:57:30.937 --> 00:57:31.870
THOUGHT IS UP ABOVE WHERE WE    
TALK ABOUT NEW REVENUES.        
I THINK THIS IS MEANT TO OFFSET 

00:57:31.872 --> 00:57:32.204
TALK ABOUT NEW REVENUES.        
I THINK THIS IS MEANT TO OFFSET 
GAS TAX.                        

00:57:32.206 --> 00:57:33.205
I THINK THIS IS MEANT TO OFFSET 
GAS TAX.                        
&gt;&gt; THE OTHER ONE IS JUST MORE   

00:57:33.207 --> 00:57:33.672

RIGHT.                          

00:57:34.007 --> 00:57:36.074
REVENUE IN GENERAL.             
RIGHT.                          
AND I THINK THE BULLET POINT    

00:57:36.076 --> 00:57:36.808
RIGHT.                          
AND I THINK THE BULLET POINT    
DOWN BELOW REALLY TALKS ABOUT   

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.177
AND I THINK THE BULLET POINT    
DOWN BELOW REALLY TALKS ABOUT   
THE OVERRELIANCE ON PROPERTY    

00:57:39.179 --> 00:57:40.078
DOWN BELOW REALLY TALKS ABOUT   
THE OVERRELIANCE ON PROPERTY    
TAX ESPECIALLY WITH LOCAL AND   

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:40.679
THE OVERRELIANCE ON PROPERTY    
TAX ESPECIALLY WITH LOCAL AND   
REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS.           

00:57:40.681 --> 00:57:43.948
TAX ESPECIALLY WITH LOCAL AND   
REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS.           
SO THEY DO FEEL SOMEWHAT        

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:44.616
REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS.           
SO THEY DO FEEL SOMEWHAT        
DISTINCT TO ME EVEN THOUGH      

00:57:44.618 --> 00:57:47.152
SO THEY DO FEEL SOMEWHAT        
DISTINCT TO ME EVEN THOUGH      
THERE IS OVERLAP, YOU KNOW THAT 

00:57:47.154 --> 00:57:48.119
DISTINCT TO ME EVEN THOUGH      
THERE IS OVERLAP, YOU KNOW THAT 
VENN DIAGRAM INCLUDES A LOT     

00:57:48.121 --> 00:57:48.986
THERE IS OVERLAP, YOU KNOW THAT

OF THE SAME TOOLS AND THE SAME  
TYPES OF TAXES.

BUT ONE IS REALLY KIND OF FOR   
THE STATE AND HOW IT COLLECTS

THE OTHER IS JUST ALLOWING      
MUNICIPAL REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS

BEING A LEGISLATIVE EXPERT.     

00:59:54.715 --> 00:59:55.913
CAN DIRECT SOME DOT TO KNOW NOT

PERHAPS MORE PROGRESSIVE VOTES  
HAVE MOVED IN A DIRECTION AWAY  
FROM SORT OF LEVEL OF SERVICE,  

01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:12.930
HAVE MOVED IN A DIRECTION AWAY  
FROM SORT OF LEVEL OF SERVICE,  
VEHICULAR LEVEL OF SERVICE.     

01:00:12.932 --> 01:00:14.165
FROM SORT OF LEVEL OF SERVICE,  
VEHICULAR LEVEL OF SERVICE.     
BUT I I IT&apos;S NOT TOO UNCOMMON   

01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:17.502
VEHICULAR LEVEL OF SERVICE.     
BUT I I IT&apos;S NOT TOO UNCOMMON   
FOR STATE LEGISLATURES TO HELP  

01:00:17.504 --> 01:00:18.303
BUT I I IT&apos;S NOT TOO UNCOMMON   
FOR STATE LEGISLATURES TO HELP  
PUT THEIR WEIGHT ON THE SCALE   

01:00:18.305 --> 01:00:21.473
FOR STATE LEGISLATURES TO HELP  
PUT THEIR WEIGHT ON THE SCALE   
IF THEY&apos;RE NOT GETTING THE SORT 

01:00:21.475 --> 01:00:24.675
PUT THEIR WEIGHT ON THE SCALE   
IF THEY&apos;RE NOT GETTING THE SORT 
OF ACTION OUT OF A STATE DOT    

01:00:24.677 --> 01:00:25.677
IF THEY&apos;RE NOT GETTING THE SORT 
OF ACTION OUT OF A STATE DOT    
THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THEIR     

01:00:25.679 --> 01:00:28.880

THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THEIR     
VALUES.                         

01:00:28.882 --> 01:00:31.916
THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THEIR     
VALUES.

01:00:31.918 --> 01:00:32.617

STANDARD.

01:20:33.252 --> 01:20:36.086
STANDARD.                       
I THINK IT&apos;S CAPTURED IN THAT   
BULLET THERE.                   

01:20:36.088 --> 01:20:37.154
I THINK IT&apos;S CAPTURED IN THAT   
BULLET THERE.                   
WE DON&apos;T EXPECT THE CITY TO PAY 

01:20:37.156 --> 01:20:37.687
BULLET THERE.                   
WE DON&apos;T EXPECT THE CITY TO PAY

01:20:37.689 --> 01:20:39.355
WE DON&apos;T EXPECT THE CITY TO PAY

THAT I THINK IS THE MINIMUM     

01:20:44.796 --> 01:20:47.230
PERMITTING TO GET THAT DONE.    
THAT I THINK IS THE MINIMUM     
STANDARD.                       

01:20:47.232 --> 01:20:48.364
THAT I THINK IS THE MINIMUM     
STANDARD.                       
&gt;&gt; BEYOND THAT, THE RIDE IS     

01:20:48.366 --> 01:20:51.168
STANDARD.                       
&gt;&gt; BEYOND THAT, THE RIDE IS     
ENTIRELY FINANCIALLY            

01:20:51.170 --> 01:20:51.901
&gt;&gt; BEYOND THAT, THE RIDE IS     
ENTIRELY FINANCIALLY            
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BENCHES,    

01:20:51.903 --> 01:20:54.104
ENTIRELY FINANCIALLY            
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BENCHES,    
THE SHELTERS, THE POLES SIGNS   

01:20:54.106 --> 01:20:55.039
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BENCHES,    
THE SHELTERS, THE POLES SIGNS   
WE HANDLE ALL OF THAT AND

01:21:02.348 --> 01:21:03.680
THAT&apos;S USUALLY PROVIDED THROUGH 
SORT OF UTILIZATION FORMULAS.   
SO IF I THINK OF A BUS STOP HAS 

01:21:03.682 --> 01:21:06.683
SORT OF UTILIZATION FORMULAS.   
SO IF I THINK OF A BUS STOP HAS 
MORE THAN 50 BUILDINGS A DAY,   

01:21:06.685 --> 01:21:07.550
SO IF I THINK OF A BUS STOP HAS 
MORE THAN 50 BUILDINGS A DAY,   
WE CONSIDER IT FOR OUR SHELTER  

01:21:07.552 --> 01:21:10.220
MORE THAN 50 BUILDINGS A DAY,   
WE CONSIDER IT FOR OUR SHELTER  
FOR EXAMPLE.                    

01:21:10.222 --> 01:21:11.154
WE CONSIDER IT FOR OUR SHELTER  
FOR EXAMPLE.                    
BUT THERE ARE MANY BUS STOPS    

01:21:11.156 --> 01:21:11.822
FOR EXAMPLE.                    
BUT THERE ARE MANY BUS STOPS    
THAT DON&apos;T QUITE HIT THAT       

01:21:11.824 --> 01:21:14.324
BUT THERE ARE MANY BUS STOPS    
THAT DON&apos;T QUITE HIT THAT       
THRESHOLD.                      

01:21:14.326 --> 01:21:15.125
THAT DON&apos;T QUITE HIT THAT       
THRESHOLD.                      
IT JUST DOESN&apos;T SEEM TO MAKE    

01:21:15.127 --> 01:21:15.925
THRESHOLD.                      
IT JUST DOESN&apos;T SEEM TO MAKE    
SENSE FOR TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR   

01:21:15.927 --> 01:21:17.961
IT JUST DOESN&apos;T SEEM TO MAKE    
SENSE FOR TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR   
BUS SHELTER THAT MIGHT NOT GET  

01:21:17.963 --> 01:21:18.461

USED THAT OFTEN.                

01:21:18.463 --> 01:21:19.263
BUS SHELTER THAT MIGHT NOT GET  
USED THAT OFTEN.                
SO THERE&apos;S A DEGREE OF THAT     

01:21:19.265 --> 01:21:21.732
USED THAT OFTEN.

01:44:57.949 --> 01:44:58.747
IMPROVED TRANSIT.               
I THINK THAT WAS A SUGGESTION   
THAT CAME OUT OF THE LAST

CARBON REDUCTION PROGRAM GRANTS 
.                               
THE BIG THING TO NOTE HERE IS   

02:01:16.126 --> 02:01:23.064
.                               
THE BIG THING TO NOTE HERE IS   
WE JUST CLOSED THE SURVEY ON A  

02:01:23.066 --> 02:01:23.798
THE BIG THING TO NOTE HERE IS   
WE JUST CLOSED THE SURVEY ON A  
PREFERENCE SURVEY ABOUT COLOR   

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:24.599

02:01:26.402 --> 02:01:27.568
TEMPERATURE AND WATTAGE OR THE  
STREET LIGHT UPGRADE.           
SO AGAIN, THE IDEA IS TO TAKE   

02:01:27.570 --> 02:01:30.237
STREET LIGHT UPGRADE.           
SO AGAIN, THE IDEA IS TO TAKE   
ALL THE HIGH PRESSURE SODIUM    

02:01:30.239 --> 02:01:31.106
SO AGAIN, THE IDEA IS TO TAKE   
ALL THE HIGH PRESSURE SODIUM    
THAT D.T. OWNS AND OPERATES AND 

02:01:31.108 --> 02:01:34.242
ALL THE HIGH PRESSURE SODIUM

SEVERAL DIFFERENT PILOTS THAT

DIFFERENT COLOR TEMPERATURES.   

02:01:45.288 --> 02:01:46.387
WERE OF DIFFERENT WATTAGES AND  
DIFFERENT COLOR TEMPERATURES.   
THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO BE        

02:01:46.389 --> 02:01:49.256
DIFFERENT COLOR TEMPERATURES.   
THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO BE        
SENSITIVE TO AND SOMEWHAT       

02:01:49.258 --> 02:01:50.191
THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO BE
