WARD.                           
MY IMPRESSION OF THIS PLAN IS   
THAT IT WILL NOT INCREASE       

01:14:25.066 --> 01:14:25.798
MY IMPRESSION OF THIS PLAN IS   
THAT IT WILL NOT INCREASE       
AFFORDABILITY BUT IT WILL       

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.532
THAT IT WILL NOT INCREASE

I WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING     

01:14:30.204 --> 01:14:32.471
GREATER GENTRIFICATION.         
I WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING     
THAT'S A VERY APPEALING CONCEPT 

01:14:32.473 --> 01:14:33.371
I WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING     
THAT'S A VERY APPEALING CONCEPT 
THAT'S BEEN THROWN AROUND AND I 

01:14:33.373 --> 01:14:34.072
THAT'S A VERY APPEALING CONCEPT 
THAT'S BEEN THROWN AROUND AND I 
THINK IS A FALLACY THE IDEA     

01:14:34.074 --> 01:14:37.576
THAT'S BEEN THROWN AROUND AND I 
THINK IS A FALLACY THE IDEA     
THAT INCREASING HOUSING STOCK   

01:14:37.578 --> 01:14:41.180
THINK IS A FALLACY THE IDEA     
THAT INCREASING HOUSING STOCK   
IN ANN ARBOR WILL SOMEHOW LOWER 

01:14:41.182 --> 01:14:42.247
THAT INCREASING HOUSING STOCK   
IN ANN ARBOR WILL SOMEHOW LOWER 
THE COST OF HOUSING IN ANN      

01:14:42.249 --> 01:14:42.981
IN ANN ARBOR WILL SOMEHOW LOWER 
THE COST OF HOUSING IN ANN      
ARBOR WHICH IS INTUITIVELY VERY 

01:14:42.983 --> 01:14:45.151
THE COST OF HOUSING IN ANN      
ARBOR WHICH IS INTUITIVELY VERY 
APPEALING IN MORE SUPPLY MEANS  

01:14:45.153 --> 01:14:45.617
ARBOR WHICH IS INTUITIVELY VERY 
APPEALING IN MORE SUPPLY MEANS  
LOWER PRICES.                   

01:14:45.619 --> 01:14:48.920
APPEALING IN MORE SUPPLY MEANS  
LOWER PRICES.                   
THIS WOULD BE TRUE IF ANN ARBOR 

01:14:48.922 --> 01:14:49.621
LOWER PRICES.                   
THIS WOULD BE TRUE IF ANN ARBOR 
WERE AN ISLAND WITH A FIXED     

01:14:49.623 --> 01:14:50.289
THIS WOULD BE TRUE IF ANN ARBOR 
WERE AN ISLAND WITH A FIXED     
NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND A FIXED    

01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:52.757
WERE AN ISLAND WITH A FIXED     
NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND A FIXED    
FIXED HOUSING STOCK.            

01:14:52.759 --> 01:14:54.026
NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND A FIXED    
FIXED HOUSING STOCK.            
BUT ANN ARBOR IS PART OF A MUCH 

01:14:54.028 --> 01:14:56.462

BUT ANN ARBOR IS PART OF A MUCH 
LARGER METRO AREA AND APPEALS

PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE HERE SO     
INCREASING HOUSING STOCK IN ANN 

01:15:01.168 --> 01:15:04.570
PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE HERE SO     
INCREASING HOUSING STOCK IN ANN 
ARBOR WILL HAVE A SMALL EFFECT  

01:15:04.572 --> 01:15:05.503
INCREASING HOUSING STOCK IN ANN 
ARBOR WILL HAVE A SMALL EFFECT  
ON HOUSING STOCK IN THE ENTIRE

NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT AND           
INCREASING THE HOUSING PINEY

OVER THE ENTIRE METRO AREA AND  
THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT THAT

THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT THAT 
ANN ARBOR WOULDN'T SIMPLY

THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT THAT 
ANN ARBOR WOULDN'T SIMPLY

01:17:00.855 --> 01:17:01.653
ANN ARBOR WOULDN'T SIMPLY       
BECOME A GREATER CONCENTRATION  
OF GENTRIFICATION AND THE LOWER 

01:17:01.655 --> 01:17:04.322
BECOME A GREATER CONCENTRATION  
OF GENTRIFICATION AND THE LOWER 
HOUSING COMES FROM INCREASED    

01:17:04.324 --> 01:17:04.957

01:17:04.959 --> 01:17:08.761

SO IN MY MIND IF YOU WANT       

01:17:08.763 --> 01:17:12.031
SUPPLY WOULD OCCUR ELSEWHERE.   
SO IN MY MIND IF YOU WANT       
AFFORDABILITY YOU HAVE TO DO    

01:17:12.033 --> 01:17:12.831
SO IN MY MIND IF YOU WANT       
AFFORDABILITY YOU HAVE TO DO    
SOMETHING THAT CONSTRAINS AND   

01:17:12.833 --> 01:17:13.432
AFFORDABILITY YOU HAVE TO DO    
SOMETHING THAT CONSTRAINS AND   
CHANNELS MARKET FORCES AND      

01:17:13.434 --> 01:17:15.834
SOMETHING THAT CONSTRAINS AND   
CHANNELS MARKET FORCES AND      
POTENTIALLY COME THROUGH WITH

CHANNELS MARKET FORCES AND      
POTENTIALLY COME THROUGH WITH

BUT WHAT I SEE IN THESE TIMES   
OF CHANGE IS THAT WE CAN ALLOW  

01:24:14.988 --> 01:24:18.590

IT REQUIRES VISION.             
IT REQUIRES PASSION.            
THERE'S PLENTY OF THAT'S        

01:24:27.968 --> 01:24:29.634
IT REQUIRES PASSION.            
THERE'S PLENTY OF THAT'S        
AVAILABLE.

THERE'S PLENTY OF THAT'S        
AVAILABLE.

THAT THE BEST WE CAN DO IS LOOK

I TOTALLY AGREE THAT HISTORIC   
DISTRICTS BRING SOME VALUE TO   

02:43:07.716 --> 02:43:08.448

DISTRICTS BRING SOME VALUE TO   
THE COMMUNITY AND THERE'S       

02:43:08.450 --> 02:43:11.651
DISTRICTS BRING SOME VALUE TO   
THE COMMUNITY AND THERE'S       
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL ABOUT THE  

02:43:11.653 --> 02:43:12.218
THE COMMUNITY AND THERE'S       
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL ABOUT THE  
PLACES THAT WE'RE IN.

HISTORIC DISTRICT IS BECOMING   
AN INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PLACE   

02:43:19.327 --> 02:43:19.726
HISTORIC DISTRICT IS BECOMING   
AN INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PLACE

THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT WE     
ALREADY GOT IN OUR PACKET AND

REVIEW PERIOD AND THEN I THINK  
IT'S HARD TO PLAN AROUND THE
