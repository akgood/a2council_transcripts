WE AGAIN WANT TO REITERATE THAT 

00:11:51.867 --> 00:11:55.234
AND IS VERY CLOSE TO COMPLIANT. 
WE AGAIN WANT TO REITERATE THAT 
WE'VE EXAMINED OTHER I'LL LET   

00:11:55.236 --> 00:11:56.235
WE AGAIN WANT TO REITERATE THAT

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:03.409
WAYS TO CREATE A FULLY          
COMPLIANT STAIR SYSTEM AND IT   
WOULD BE SO INVASIVE AND        

00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:04.177
COMPLIANT STAIR SYSTEM AND IT   
WOULD BE SO INVASIVE AND        
FUNCTIONAL IN SUCH A NEGATIVE   

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:07.747
WOULD BE SO INVASIVE AND        
FUNCTIONAL IN SUCH A NEGATIVE   
IMPACT IN THE OTHER AREAS THAT  

00:12:07.749 --> 00:12:11.417
FUNCTIONAL IN SUCH A NEGATIVE   
IMPACT IN THE OTHER AREAS THAT  
IT MAKES IT NOT A REASONABLE    

00:12:11.419 --> 00:12:11.751
IMPACT IN THE OTHER AREAS THAT  
IT MAKES IT NOT A REASONABLE    
CONSIDERATION.                  

00:12:11.753 --> 00:12:14.220
IT MAKES IT NOT A REASONABLE    
CONSIDERATION.                  
SO WE'RE LEFT WITH A CHOICE     

00:12:14.222 --> 00:12:14.921
CONSIDERATION.                  
SO WE'RE LEFT WITH A CHOICE     
OF EITHER KEEPING THIS NARROW   

00:12:14.923 --> 00:12:18.591
SO WE'RE LEFT WITH A CHOICE     
OF EITHER KEEPING THIS NARROW   
STEEP STAIR SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT 

00:12:18.593 --> 00:12:19.325
OF EITHER KEEPING THIS NARROW   
STEEP STAIR SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT 
FIRE PROTECTED OR CREATING A    

00:12:19.327 --> 00:12:22.262
STEEP STAIR SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT 
FIRE PROTECTED OR CREATING A    
FIRE PROTECTED STAIR SYSTEM

FIRE PROTECTED STAIR SYSTEM     
THAT IS MORE FUNCTIONAL AND     
SAFER THAN WHAT IS THERE NOW.   

00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:33.039
THAT IS MORE FUNCTIONAL AND     
SAFER THAN WHAT IS THERE NOW.   
SO YEAH, THIS BUILDING IS       

00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:33.840
SAFER THAN WHAT IS THERE NOW.   
SO YEAH, THIS BUILDING IS       
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAKE     

00:12:33.842 --> 00:12:37.877
SO YEAH, THIS BUILDING IS       
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAKE     
CHANGES TO ITS IT WAS LITERALLY 

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:41.714
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAKE     
CHANGES TO ITS IT WAS LITERALLY 
BUILT TO BE FIREPROOF BACK THEN 

00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:45.818
CHANGES TO ITS IT WAS LITERALLY 
BUILT TO BE FIREPROOF BACK THEN 
AND SO THE I SPENT I DON'T EVEN 

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.519
BUILT TO BE FIREPROOF BACK THEN 
AND SO THE I SPENT I DON'T EVEN 
KNOW LIKE TWO WEEKS OR THREE    

00:12:46.521 --> 00:12:49.255
AND SO THE I SPENT I DON'T EVEN 
KNOW LIKE TWO WEEKS OR THREE    
WEEKS TRYING TO COME UP WITH    

00:12:49.257 --> 00:12:52.525
KNOW LIKE TWO WEEKS OR THREE    
WEEKS TRYING TO COME UP WITH    
ANY OTHER VERSION IN ORDER TO   

00:12:52.527 --> 00:12:53.459
WEEKS TRYING TO COME UP WITH    
ANY OTHER VERSION IN ORDER TO   
FIT ANY ANY VERSION OF THE      

00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:54.194
ANY OTHER VERSION IN ORDER TO   
FIT ANY ANY VERSION OF THE      
STAIR IN THERE THAT WOULD MEET  

00:12:54.196 --> 00:12:56.629
FIT ANY ANY VERSION OF THE      
STAIR IN THERE THAT WOULD MEET  
THE REGULAR CODE AND IT'S       

00:12:56.631 --> 00:12:57.230
STAIR IN THERE THAT WOULD MEET  
THE REGULAR CODE AND IT'S       
IMPOSSIBLE JUST BECAUSE         

00:12:57.232 --> 00:13:00.866
THE REGULAR CODE AND IT'S       
IMPOSSIBLE JUST BECAUSE         
OF WHERE THE WALLS ARE IT WOULD 

00:13:00.868 --> 00:13:03.970
IMPOSSIBLE JUST BECAUSE         
OF WHERE THE WALLS ARE IT WOULD 
IT WOULD MEAN COMPLETELY        

00:13:03.972 --> 00:13:07.473
OF WHERE THE WALLS ARE IT WOULD 
IT WOULD MEAN COMPLETELY        
DESTROYING THEN POSSIBLY THERE  

00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:08.141
IT WOULD MEAN COMPLETELY        
DESTROYING THEN POSSIBLY THERE  
ALTHOUGH BEARING WALLS IS THE   

00:13:08.143 --> 00:13:08.540
DESTROYING THEN POSSIBLY THERE  
ALTHOUGH BEARING WALLS IS THE   
PROBLEM.                        

00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:12.578
ALTHOUGH BEARING WALLS IS THE   
PROBLEM.                        
SO THERE REALLY IS NO WAY TO    

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.345
PROBLEM.                        
SO THERE REALLY IS NO WAY TO    
MOVE THE THE WALLS THAT WOULD   

00:13:13.347 --> 00:13:16.115
SO THERE REALLY IS NO WAY TO    
MOVE THE THE WALLS THAT WOULD   
BE REQUIRED TO MOVE IT LIKE THE 

00:13:16.117 --> 00:13:16.849
MOVE THE THE WALLS THAT WOULD   
BE REQUIRED TO MOVE IT LIKE THE 
EXTRA TWO OR THREE FEET IN      

00:13:16.851 --> 00:13:19.452
BE REQUIRED TO MOVE IT LIKE THE 
EXTRA TWO OR THREE FEET IN      
ORDER TO FIT ANY OTHER VERSION  

00:13:19.454 --> 00:13:23.522
EXTRA TWO OR THREE FEET IN      
ORDER TO FIT ANY OTHER VERSION  
OF OF THE COMPLIANT STAIRS IN   

00:13:23.524 --> 00:13:23.856
ORDER TO FIT ANY OTHER VERSION  
OF OF THE COMPLIANT STAIRS IN   
THERE.                          

00:13:23.858 --> 00:13:24.924
OF OF THE COMPLIANT STAIRS IN   
THERE.                          
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED     

00:13:24.926 --> 00:13:27.694
THERE.                          
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED     
LIKE FORTY DIFFERENT VERSIONS   

00:13:27.696 --> 00:13:31.230
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED     
LIKE FORTY DIFFERENT VERSIONS   
TO SEE HOW IT DOESN'T WORK BUT  

00:13:31.232 --> 00:13:31.697
LIKE FORTY DIFFERENT VERSIONS   
TO SEE HOW IT DOESN'T WORK BUT  
IS IMPOSSIBLE.                  

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:32.498
TO SEE HOW IT DOESN'T WORK BUT  
IS IMPOSSIBLE.                  
WE'VE HAD ENGINEERS EVERYBODY   

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.968
IS IMPOSSIBLE.                  
WE'VE HAD ENGINEERS EVERYBODY   
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO   

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.071
WE'VE HAD ENGINEERS EVERYBODY   
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO   
MAKE IT STRAIGHT OR THIS WALL   

00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:42.609
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO   
MAKE IT STRAIGHT OR THIS WALL   
OUR THERE WELL BUT BECAUSE THE  

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:43.276
MAKE IT STRAIGHT OR THIS WALL   
OUR THERE WELL BUT BECAUSE THE  
WAY THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED       

00:13:43.278 --> 00:13:46.478
OUR THERE WELL BUT BECAUSE THE  
WAY THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED       
THERE'S LIKE THIS INNER CORE    

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.785
WAY THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED       
THERE'S LIKE THIS INNER CORE    
OF POSTS AND SOLID              

00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:09.535
                   CONCRETE IN  
THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING THE  
EXISTING STAIRS ARE UP AGAINST  

00:14:09.537 --> 00:14:09.736
THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING THE  
EXISTING STAIRS ARE UP AGAINST  
THAT.

EXISTING STAIRS ARE UP AGAINST  
THAT.                           
SO YOU CAN THIS ONLY IS ONE     

00:14:10.838 --> 00:14:11.604
THAT.                           
SO YOU CAN THIS ONLY IS ONE     
SMALL SECTION OF THAT THAT WE   

00:14:11.606 --> 00:14:12.471
SO YOU CAN THIS ONLY IS ONE     
SMALL SECTION OF THAT THAT WE   
CAN ENGINEER SO THAT WE CAN     

00:14:12.473 --> 00:14:13.406
SMALL SECTION OF THAT THAT WE   
CAN ENGINEER SO THAT WE CAN     
REMOVE IN ORDER TO BECAUSE IT'S 

00:14:13.408 --> 00:14:14.140
CAN ENGINEER SO THAT WE CAN     
REMOVE IN ORDER TO BECAUSE IT'S 
LIKE NOT A MAJOR THEME IN ORDER 

00:14:14.142 --> 00:14:14.908
REMOVE IN ORDER TO BECAUSE IT'S 
LIKE NOT A MAJOR THEME IN ORDER 
TO FIT THIS L SHAPE STAIR IN    

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.641
LIKE NOT A MAJOR THEME IN ORDER 
TO FIT THIS L SHAPE STAIR IN    
THERE YOU CAN'T GO STRAIGHT     

00:14:15.643 --> 00:14:16.375
TO FIT THIS L SHAPE STAIR IN    
THERE YOU CAN'T GO STRAIGHT     
BECAUSE ABOVE THAT THERE'S A    

00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:17.109
THERE YOU CAN'T GO STRAIGHT     
BECAUSE ABOVE THAT THERE'S A    
HUGE ROOM THAT THERE'S JUST NO  

00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:17.843
BECAUSE ABOVE THAT THERE'S A    
HUGE ROOM THAT THERE'S JUST NO  
WAY YOU LIKE BUNK SOMETHING     

00:14:17.845 --> 00:14:20.713
HUGE ROOM THAT THERE'S JUST NO  
WAY YOU LIKE BUNK SOMETHING

SO THERE'S YOU CAN'T GO UP, YOU 

00:14:25.887 --> 00:14:26.619
ROOM.                           
SO THERE'S YOU CAN'T GO UP, YOU 
CAN'T GO STRAIGHT AND YOU CAN'T 

00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:28.087
SO THERE'S YOU CAN'T GO UP, YOU 
CAN'T GO STRAIGHT AND YOU CAN'T 
GO BACKWARDS BECAUSE OF THAT    

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:29.021
CAN'T GO STRAIGHT AND YOU CAN'T 
GO BACKWARDS BECAUSE OF THAT    
BEING WHERE THE COLUMN THE MAIN 

00:14:29.023 --> 00:14:32.091
GO BACKWARDS BECAUSE OF THAT    
BEING WHERE THE COLUMN THE MAIN 
COLUMNS THAT THAT SUPPORT THE

BEING WHERE THE COLUMN THE MAIN 
COLUMNS THAT THAT SUPPORT THE   
WHOLE BUILDING ARE.             

00:14:32.694 --> 00:14:35.561
COLUMNS THAT THAT SUPPORT THE   
WHOLE BUILDING ARE.             
SO THIS REALLY IS THE ONLY      

00:14:35.563 --> 00:14:36.662
WHOLE BUILDING ARE.             
SO THIS REALLY IS THE ONLY      
VERSION THAT CAN FIT AND IT'S   

00:14:36.664 --> 00:14:40.533
SO THIS REALLY IS THE ONLY      
VERSION THAT CAN FIT AND IT'S   
SO CLOSE IT SEEMS WAY SMARTER   

00:14:40.535 --> 00:14:44.103
VERSION THAT CAN FIT AND IT'S   
SO CLOSE IT SEEMS WAY SMARTER   
TO MAKE SOMETHING SAFE THAN SAY 

00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:45.037
SO CLOSE IT SEEMS WAY SMARTER   
TO MAKE SOMETHING SAFE THAN SAY 
THAT IT'S OFF BY A QUARTER      

00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:47.806
TO MAKE SOMETHING SAFE THAN SAY 
THAT IT'S OFF BY A QUARTER      
OF AN INCH AND WE'RE GOING TO I

THAT IT'S OFF BY A QUARTER      
OF AN INCH AND WE'RE GOING TO I 
MEAN THE EXISTING STAIRS ARE    

00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:51.511
OF AN INCH AND WE'RE GOING TO I 
MEAN THE EXISTING STAIRS ARE    
REALLY SLIPPERY AND WE'RE JUST  

00:14:51.513 --> 00:14:54.947
MEAN THE EXISTING STAIRS ARE    
REALLY SLIPPERY AND WE'RE JUST

DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A FIRE     
RATED ENCLOSURE EARLIER         

00:18:20.655 --> 00:18:27.793
DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A FIRE     
RATED ENCLOSURE EARLIER         
REPORTER I GUESS IT IS THE WAY  

00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:28.494
RATED ENCLOSURE EARLIER         
REPORTER I GUESS IT IS THE WAY  
THAT WE DID IT THAT'S YOU'RE    

00:18:28.496 --> 00:18:31.230
REPORTER I GUESS IT IS THE WAY  
THAT WE DID IT THAT'S YOU'RE    
SAYING THAT YOU THINK THAT YOU

THE REASON IS HOW FAR IT HAS TO

THE REASON IS HOW FAR IT HAS TO 
COME DOWN BEFORE IT HITS A

GET THE CLEARANCE UNDERNEATH    

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.296
AND SO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO   
GET THE CLEARANCE UNDERNEATH    
THAT OTHER B SO WE DON'T YOU    

00:25:11.298 --> 00:25:12.097
GET THE CLEARANCE UNDERNEATH    
THAT OTHER B SO WE DON'T YOU    
DON'T SEE THAT WITH THAT WE     

00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:14.900
THAT OTHER B SO WE DON'T YOU    
DON'T SEE THAT WITH THAT WE     
DON'T WE WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW 

00:25:14.902 --> 00:25:20.705
DON'T SEE THAT WITH THAT WE     
DON'T WE WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW 
YOU CAN MODIFY IT MAKES IT      

00:25:20.707 --> 00:25:24.309
DON'T WE WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW

STAIR YOU KNOW SO IT'S NOT LIKE 

00:27:11.051 --> 00:27:11.816
CLOSE TO A NORMAL RESIDENTIAL   
STAIR YOU KNOW SO IT'S NOT LIKE

00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:21.493
QUESTION I THOUGHT ABOUT BUT    
I'M SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL       
DIMENSION OF THE TREAD BECAUSE  

00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:25.230
I'M SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL       
DIMENSION OF THE TREAD BECAUSE  
THE CODE DEFINITION IS FROM     

00:27:25.232 --> 00:27:28.700
DIMENSION OF THE TREAD BECAUSE  
THE CODE DEFINITION IS FROM     
DOZING EDGE TO NOSING EDGE.     

00:27:28.702 --> 00:27:29.668
THE CODE DEFINITION IS FROM     
DOZING EDGE TO NOSING EDGE.     
SO IS THAT TEN AND THREE        

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.469
DOZING EDGE TO NOSING EDGE.     
SO IS THAT TEN AND THREE        
QUARTERS OF AN INCH OR IS IT    

00:27:30.471 --> 00:27:32.871
SO IS THAT TEN AND THREE        
QUARTERS OF AN INCH OR IS IT    
TEN INCHES?                     

00:27:32.873 --> 00:27:33.939
QUARTERS OF AN INCH OR IS IT    
TEN INCHES?                     
IT'S TEN INCHES YEAH THAT SORT  

00:27:33.941 --> 00:27:36.808
TEN INCHES?                     
IT'S TEN INCHES YEAH THAT SORT  
OF THING IS IS TINY THREE       

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:40.445
IT'S TEN INCHES YEAH THAT SORT  
OF THING IS IS TINY THREE       
QUARTER SO IT'S A FALLING SHORT 

00:27:40.447 --> 00:27:40.646
OF THING IS IS TINY THREE       
QUARTER SO IT'S A FALLING SHORT 
.                               

00:27:40.648 --> 00:27:41.980
QUARTER SO IT'S A FALLING SHORT 
.                               
IT IS BUT IT ALSO IT ALSO IS    

00:27:41.982 --> 00:27:44.850

SORT OF WEIRD HOW THEY          
MENTIONED IT THAT THEY SAY THAT 
THE FLAT PART OF THE TREAD IS   

00:27:47.988 --> 00:27:48.853
MENTIONED IT THAT THEY SAY THAT 
THE FLAT PART OF THE TREAD IS   
SUPPOSED TO BE 11 INCHES AND SO 

00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:52.157
THE FLAT PART OF THE TREAD IS   
SUPPOSED TO BE 11 INCHES AND SO 
THEY DON'T SAY THAT THEY DON'T  

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.158
SUPPOSED TO BE 11 INCHES AND SO

THERE'S NOTHING IN IT EXCEPT    
FOR LIKE DRAPES FURNISHINGS     
THAT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE   

00:29:01.862 --> 00:29:05.363
FOR LIKE DRAPES FURNISHINGS     
THAT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE   
OF THE APPLICATION TALK ABOUT   

00:29:05.365 --> 00:29:06.131
THAT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE   
OF THE APPLICATION TALK ABOUT   
IT BEING A THREE DAY TYPE       

00:29:06.133 --> 00:29:10.002
OF THE APPLICATION TALK ABOUT   
IT BEING A THREE DAY TYPE       
OF CONSTRUCTION AND COMBUSTIBLE 

00:29:10.004 --> 00:29:10.869
IT BEING A THREE DAY TYPE       
OF CONSTRUCTION AND COMBUSTIBLE 
WOULD BE A TYPE TWO             

00:29:10.871 --> 00:29:11.170
OF CONSTRUCTION AND COMBUSTIBLE 
WOULD BE A TYPE TWO             
CONSTRUCTION.

YOU MAY BE ME MAYBE YOU HAVE A  
BETTER CONSTRUCTION TYPE THAN   

00:29:25.953 --> 00:29:26.618
YOU MAY BE ME MAYBE YOU HAVE A  
BETTER CONSTRUCTION TYPE THAN   
THREE YOU KNOW THREE EIGHT      

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.320
BETTER CONSTRUCTION TYPE THAN   
THREE YOU KNOW THREE EIGHT      
WITHIN FIVE WALLS AND MOST      

00:29:28.322 --> 00:29:29.054
THREE YOU KNOW THREE EIGHT      
WITHIN FIVE WALLS AND MOST      
OF THE CONSTRUCTION SO YEAH THE 

00:29:29.056 --> 00:29:32.257
WITHIN FIVE WALLS AND MOST      
OF THE CONSTRUCTION SO YEAH THE 
ONLY THING OVER ANYTHING IS     

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:33.057
OF THE CONSTRUCTION SO YEAH THE 
ONLY THING OVER ANYTHING IS     
PLASTER WHICH IS ALSO YEAH.

ONLY THING OVER ANYTHING IS     
PLASTER WHICH IS ALSO YEAH.     
LIKE COMBUSTIBLE SO YEAH YEAH.  

00:29:36.163 --> 00:29:39.664
PLASTER WHICH IS ALSO YEAH.     
LIKE COMBUSTIBLE SO YEAH YEAH.  
SO THAT HAS A POTENTIAL VALUE   

00:29:39.666 --> 00:29:46.738
LIKE COMBUSTIBLE SO YEAH YEAH.  
SO THAT HAS A POTENTIAL VALUE   
OF FIRE RESISTANT SO WHEN YOU   

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.009
SO THAT HAS A POTENTIAL VALUE   
OF FIRE RESISTANT SO WHEN YOU   
JUST LOOKING AT THE I GUESS     

00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:51.876
OF FIRE RESISTANT SO WHEN YOU   
JUST LOOKING AT THE I GUESS     
IT'S THE BASEMENT PLAN IF YOU   

00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:58.116
JUST LOOKING AT THE I GUESS     
IT'S THE BASEMENT PLAN IF YOU   
WERE TO TAKE OFF TO RISERS AND  

00:29:58.118 --> 00:29:59.051
IT'S THE BASEMENT PLAN IF YOU   
WERE TO TAKE OFF TO RISERS AND  
HAVE A LANDING AT THE BOTTOM    

00:29:59.053 --> 00:30:02.921
WERE TO TAKE OFF TO RISERS AND  
HAVE A LANDING AT THE BOTTOM    
AND TURN THE STAIR ONE MORE     

00:30:02.923 --> 00:30:05.957
HAVE A LANDING AT THE BOTTOM    
AND TURN THE STAIR ONE MORE     
TIME, WOULD THAT BE ABLE WOULD  

00:30:05.959 --> 00:30:09.494
AND TURN THE STAIR ONE MORE     
TIME, WOULD THAT BE ABLE WOULD  
YOU BE ABLE TO MAKE THE         

00:30:09.496 --> 00:30:10.095
TIME, WOULD THAT BE ABLE WOULD  
YOU BE ABLE TO MAKE THE         
GEOMETRY WORK THAT WAY?         

00:30:10.097 --> 00:30:13.465
YOU BE ABLE TO MAKE THE         
GEOMETRY WORK THAT WAY?         
THIS IS WHAT HE'S SAYING FOR    

00:30:13.467 --> 00:30:14.199
GEOMETRY WORK THAT WAY?         
THIS IS WHAT HE'S SAYING FOR    
THE LANDING HERE AND THEN PUT   

00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:17.469
THIS IS WHAT HE'S SAYING FOR    
THE LANDING HERE AND THEN PUT   
TWO STEPS THERE AND THEN THE    

00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:21.873
THE LANDING HERE AND THEN PUT   
TWO STEPS THERE AND THEN THE    
QUESTION DO YOU REALLY NEED DO  

00:30:21.875 --> 00:30:22.674
TWO STEPS THERE AND THEN THE    
QUESTION DO YOU REALLY NEED DO  
YOU REALLY NEED THE STAIR TO    

00:30:22.676 --> 00:30:25.543
QUESTION DO YOU REALLY NEED DO  
YOU REALLY NEED THE STAIR TO    
DISCHARGE BOTH WAYS?            

00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:26.611
YOU REALLY NEED THE STAIR TO    
DISCHARGE BOTH WAYS?            
WELL, THE REASON IS THERE'S NO  

00:30:26.613 --> 00:30:29.147
DISCHARGE BOTH WAYS?            
WELL, THE REASON IS THERE'S NO  
WAY TO GET IN THAT ROOM NOW

YOU WHY THERE HAS TO BE SORT    
OF WHETHER THIS THERE HAS TO BE 

00:31:11.224 --> 00:31:11.690
YOU WHY THERE HAS TO BE SORT    
OF WHETHER THIS THERE HAS TO BE 
ENCLOSED OR NOT.

OF WHETHER THIS THERE HAS TO BE 
ENCLOSED OR NOT.                
>> YEAH BUT THE ONE REASON IS

CLOSE THAT ROOM OFF BECAUSE     

00:31:20.633 --> 00:31:24.269
THEY SORT OF WANT TO BE ABLE TO 
CLOSE THAT ROOM OFF BECAUSE     
OF THE NOISE ONE FOR ONE REASON

OF THE NOISE ONE FOR ONE REASON 
BUT THEY WANTED THEY WANTED TO  

00:31:25.205 --> 00:31:29.074
OF THE NOISE ONE FOR ONE REASON 
BUT THEY WANTED THEY WANTED TO  
BE ABLE TO THIS ENTIRE TIME YOU 

00:31:29.076 --> 00:31:29.941
BUT THEY WANTED THEY WANTED TO  
BE ABLE TO THIS ENTIRE TIME YOU 
GO DOWN THE STAIRS AND IT'S     

00:31:29.943 --> 00:31:33.178
BE ABLE TO THIS ENTIRE TIME YOU 
GO DOWN THE STAIRS AND IT'S     
OPEN TO THE WHOLE BASEMENT AND  

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.915
GO DOWN THE STAIRS AND IT'S     
OPEN TO THE WHOLE BASEMENT AND  
THE IDEA WAS TO BE ABLE TO      

00:31:36.917 --> 00:31:40.485
OPEN TO THE WHOLE BASEMENT AND  
THE IDEA WAS TO BE ABLE TO      
CLOSE OFF THE DOOR TO THE       

00:31:40.487 --> 00:31:41.286
THE IDEA WAS TO BE ABLE TO      
CLOSE OFF THE DOOR TO THE       
BASEMENT SINCE THAT'S WHERE ALL 

00:31:41.288 --> 00:31:43.621
CLOSE OFF THE DOOR TO THE       
BASEMENT SINCE THAT'S WHERE ALL 
THE LOUD THINGS HAPPEN.         

00:31:43.623 --> 00:31:44.589
BASEMENT SINCE THAT'S WHERE ALL 
THE LOUD THINGS HAPPEN.         
>> BUT YOU ONLY NEED ONE DOOR   

00:31:44.591 --> 00:31:45.189
THE LOUD THINGS HAPPEN.         
>> BUT YOU ONLY NEED ONE DOOR   
THEN LIKE AT THE TOP.           

00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:48.393
>> BUT YOU ONLY NEED ONE DOOR   
THEN LIKE AT THE TOP.           
WELL, THERE IS THERE IS A DOOR  

00:31:48.395 --> 00:31:48.927
THEN LIKE AT THE TOP.           
WELL, THERE IS THERE IS A DOOR  
AT THE TOP I BELIEVE.           

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:52.230
WELL, THERE IS THERE IS A DOOR  
AT THE TOP I BELIEVE.           
I MEAN IT IT'S NOT THE BEST FOR 

00:31:52.232 --> 00:31:56.100
AT THE TOP I BELIEVE.           
I MEAN IT IT'S NOT THE BEST FOR 
WELL I GUESS WHERE I'M GOING    

00:31:56.102 --> 00:31:58.669
I MEAN IT IT'S NOT THE BEST FOR 
WELL I GUESS WHERE I'M GOING    
WITH THIS IS IF THE IF THE      

00:31:58.671 --> 00:31:59.704
WELL I GUESS WHERE I'M GOING    
WITH THIS IS IF THE IF THE      
STAIR DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A FIRE 

00:31:59.706 --> 00:32:02.540
WITH THIS IS IF THE IF THE      
STAIR DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A FIRE 
RATED THERE AND YOU KNOW,       

00:32:02.542 --> 00:32:03.141
STAIR DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A FIRE 
RATED THERE AND YOU KNOW,       
CONFIGURED THE WAY YOU'RE       

00:32:03.143 --> 00:32:03.941
RATED THERE AND YOU KNOW,       
CONFIGURED THE WAY YOU'RE       
SHOWING IT AND LET'S JUST SAY   

00:32:03.943 --> 00:32:07.546
CONFIGURED THE WAY YOU'RE       
SHOWING IT AND LET'S JUST SAY   
IT WAS A COMMUNICATOR THERE AND 

00:32:07.548 --> 00:32:08.480
SHOWING IT AND LET'S JUST SAY   
IT WAS A COMMUNICATOR THERE AND 
I GUESS THIS IS ALSO FOR THE    

00:32:08.482 --> 00:32:10.548
IT WAS A COMMUNICATOR THERE AND 
I GUESS THIS IS ALSO FOR THE    
BUILDING DEPARTMENT WILL THAT   

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.650
I GUESS THIS IS ALSO FOR THE    
BUILDING DEPARTMENT WILL THAT   
WOULD THAT HELP YOU WITH YOUR   

00:32:11.652 --> 00:32:15.286
BUILDING DEPARTMENT WILL THAT   
WOULD THAT HELP YOU WITH YOUR   
GEOMETRY IF YOU COME DOWN TO    

00:32:15.288 --> 00:32:18.457
WOULD THAT HELP YOU WITH YOUR   
GEOMETRY IF YOU COME DOWN TO    
THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIR AND     

00:32:18.459 --> 00:32:19.257
GEOMETRY IF YOU COME DOWN TO    
THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIR AND     
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE LANDING   

00:32:19.259 --> 00:32:20.058
THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIR AND     
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE LANDING   
THE WAY YOU HAVE IT, YOU CUT    

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.028
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE LANDING   
THE WAY YOU HAVE IT, YOU CUT    
BACK TWO STEPS, MAKE A RIGHT    

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.898
THE WAY YOU HAVE IT, YOU CUT    
BACK TWO STEPS, MAKE A RIGHT    
ANGLE, TURN TO THE BOTTOM?      

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.899
BACK TWO STEPS, MAKE A RIGHT    
ANGLE, TURN TO THE BOTTOM?      
>> I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE BECAUSE 

00:32:27.901 --> 00:32:30.836
ANGLE, TURN TO THE BOTTOM?      
>> I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE BECAUSE 
ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH WHERE IT 

00:32:30.838 --> 00:32:31.903
>> I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE BECAUSE 
ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH WHERE IT 
IS I'D HAVE TO DO THAT IN 3D.   

00:32:31.905 --> 00:32:33.004
ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH WHERE IT 
IS I'D HAVE TO DO THAT IN 3D.   
I DO THE THINGS IN 3D IN        

00:32:33.006 --> 00:32:36.474
IS I'D HAVE TO DO THAT IN 3D.   
I DO THE THINGS IN 3D IN        
COMPUTER.                       

00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:37.542
I DO THE THINGS IN 3D IN        
COMPUTER.                       
THE ISSUE IS WHERE THAT LANDING 

00:32:37.544 --> 00:32:38.409
COMPUTER.                       
THE ISSUE IS WHERE THAT LANDING 
IS THE FIRST LANDING YOU GO     

00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:41.079
THE ISSUE IS WHERE THAT LANDING 
IS THE FIRST LANDING YOU GO     
DOWN TO LANDING AND THEN YOU    

00:32:41.081 --> 00:32:41.580
IS THE FIRST LANDING YOU GO     
DOWN TO LANDING AND THEN YOU    
TAKE A LEFT OFF.                

00:32:41.582 --> 00:32:44.916
DOWN TO LANDING AND THEN YOU    
TAKE A LEFT OFF.                
SO THAT'S THAT RIGHT THERE.     

00:32:44.918 --> 00:32:45.851
TAKE A LEFT OFF.                
SO THAT'S THAT RIGHT THERE.     
THAT SPOT IS THE TRICKIEST IN   

00:32:45.853 --> 00:32:47.986
SO THAT'S THAT RIGHT THERE.     
THAT SPOT IS THE TRICKIEST IN   
THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT THE THE  

00:32:47.988 --> 00:32:48.453
THAT SPOT IS THE TRICKIEST IN   
THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT THE THE  
HEADROOM.                       

00:32:48.455 --> 00:32:55.627
THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT THE THE  
HEADROOM.                       
SO IF YOU CONTINUE DOWN THERE'S 

00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:59.564
HEADROOM.                       
SO IF YOU CONTINUE DOWN THERE'S 
A HUGE BEAM THAT THAT RUNS ON   

00:32:59.566 --> 00:33:00.565
SO IF YOU CONTINUE DOWN THERE'S 
A HUGE BEAM THAT THAT RUNS ON   
THIS UP AND DOWN THE PAGE NEXT  

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:04.002
A HUGE BEAM THAT THAT RUNS ON   
THIS UP AND DOWN THE PAGE NEXT  
TO THE STAIRS TO THE RIGHT      

00:33:04.004 --> 00:33:06.604
THIS UP AND DOWN THE PAGE NEXT  
TO THE STAIRS TO THE RIGHT      
OF THE STAIRS AND THAT'S ONE    

00:33:06.606 --> 00:33:07.139
TO THE STAIRS TO THE RIGHT      
OF THE STAIRS AND THAT'S ONE    
THE MAIN BEAMS.                 

00:33:07.141 --> 00:33:10.908
OF THE STAIRS AND THAT'S ONE    
THE MAIN BEAMS.                 
SO I WOULD HAVE TO SEE IF THE   

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.044
THE MAIN BEAMS.                 
SO I WOULD HAVE TO SEE IF THE   
STEPS IF YOU GO DOWN TO A       

00:33:12.046 --> 00:33:15.447
SO I WOULD HAVE TO SEE IF THE   
STEPS IF YOU GO DOWN TO A       
LANDING AT THE BOTTOM VERY      

00:33:15.449 --> 00:33:16.114
STEPS IF YOU GO DOWN TO A       
LANDING AT THE BOTTOM VERY      
BOTTOM OF THIS AND THEN YOU     

00:33:16.116 --> 00:33:19.050
LANDING AT THE BOTTOM VERY      
BOTTOM OF THIS AND THEN YOU     
HAVE TWO MORE STEPS I'D HAVE TO 

00:33:19.052 --> 00:33:19.785
BOTTOM OF THIS AND THEN YOU     
HAVE TWO MORE STEPS I'D HAVE TO 
SEE IF THERE'S ENOUGH HEADROOM  

00:33:19.787 --> 00:33:20.185
HAVE TWO MORE STEPS I'D HAVE TO 
SEE IF THERE'S ENOUGH HEADROOM  
TO DO THAT.                     

00:33:20.187 --> 00:33:23.288
SEE IF THERE'S ENOUGH HEADROOM  
TO DO THAT.                     
SO I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION  

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.691
TO DO THAT.                     
SO I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION  
IF WE CAN HAVE A DETERMINATION  

00:33:26.693 --> 00:33:27.525
SO I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION  
IF WE CAN HAVE A DETERMINATION  
THAT THIS CAN BE A              

00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:30.995
IF WE CAN HAVE A DETERMINATION  
THAT THIS CAN BE A              
COMMUNICATING STAIR AGAIN IF    

00:33:30.997 --> 00:33:31.796
THAT THIS CAN BE A              
COMMUNICATING STAIR AGAIN IF    
THIS WERE TABLED I THINK WE     

00:33:31.798 --> 00:33:32.531
COMMUNICATING STAIR AGAIN IF    
THIS WERE TABLED I THINK WE     
COULD GO BACK AND EXAMINE THAT  

00:33:32.533 --> 00:33:34.932
THIS WERE TABLED I THINK WE     
COULD GO BACK AND EXAMINE THAT  
AS AN OPTION.                   

00:33:34.934 --> 00:33:38.803
COULD GO BACK AND EXAMINE THAT  
AS AN OPTION.                   
I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR THAT       

00:33:38.805 --> 00:33:39.737
AS AN OPTION.                   
I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR THAT       
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO 

00:33:39.739 --> 00:33:42.807
I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR THAT       
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO 
HELP YOU A LOT NOT ONLY HERE IN 

00:33:42.809 --> 00:33:43.508
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO 
HELP YOU A LOT NOT ONLY HERE IN 
TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY BUT      

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.977
HELP YOU A LOT NOT ONLY HERE IN 
TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY BUT      
BEING ABLE TO MEET THE          

00:33:45.979 --> 00:33:46.511
TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY BUT      
BEING ABLE TO MEET THE          
CODE WHERE YOU WANT TO.         

00:33:46.513 --> 00:33:47.446
BEING ABLE TO MEET THE          
CODE WHERE YOU WANT TO.         
AND I THINK IT'S IT'S LAUDABLE  

00:33:47.448 --> 00:33:50.448
CODE WHERE YOU WANT TO.         
AND I THINK IT'S IT'S LAUDABLE  
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS 

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.116
AND I THINK IT'S IT'S LAUDABLE  
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS 
WORK BETTER ESPECIALLY YOU      

00:33:51.118 --> 00:33:54.485
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS 
WORK BETTER ESPECIALLY YOU      
KNOW, GIVEN HOW THE SPACE IS    

00:33:54.487 --> 00:33:55.220
WORK BETTER ESPECIALLY YOU      
KNOW, GIVEN HOW THE SPACE IS    
BEING USED AND AND THE FACT     

00:33:55.222 --> 00:33:58.156
KNOW, GIVEN HOW THE SPACE IS    
BEING USED AND AND THE FACT     
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE BUILDING   

00:33:58.158 --> 00:33:58.923
BEING USED AND AND THE FACT     
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE BUILDING   
IS FIREPROOF THAT IT'S NOT      

00:33:58.925 --> 00:34:01.927
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE BUILDING   
IS FIREPROOF THAT IT'S NOT      
SPRINKLERED BUT YOU KNOW,       

00:34:01.929 --> 00:34:02.861
IS FIREPROOF THAT IT'S NOT      
SPRINKLERED BUT YOU KNOW,       
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY A SAFER WAY 

00:34:02.863 --> 00:34:06.264
SPRINKLERED BUT YOU KNOW,       
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY A SAFER WAY 
UP AND DOWN FROM THOSE LEVELS.  

00:34:06.266 --> 00:34:09.133
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY A SAFER WAY 
UP AND DOWN FROM THOSE LEVELS.  
AND AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE 

00:34:09.135 --> 00:34:10.135
UP AND DOWN FROM THOSE LEVELS.  
AND AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE 
THIS TOO FAR, BUT I DO THINK    

00:34:10.137 --> 00:34:13.304
AND AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE 
THIS TOO FAR, BUT I DO THINK    
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A     

00:34:13.306 --> 00:34:14.039
THIS TOO FAR, BUT I DO THINK    
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A     
PROBLEM WITH THOSE HANDRAILS AT 

00:34:14.041 --> 00:34:17.375
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A     
PROBLEM WITH THOSE HANDRAILS AT 
THE VERY BOTTOM AND THE         

00:34:17.377 --> 00:34:18.109
PROBLEM WITH THOSE HANDRAILS AT 
THE VERY BOTTOM AND THE         
INTERMEDIATE HANDRAIL BECAUSE   

00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:20.845
THE VERY BOTTOM AND THE         
INTERMEDIATE HANDRAIL BECAUSE   
YOU'RE GOING AROUND THE WONDER  

00:34:20.847 --> 00:34:21.713
INTERMEDIATE HANDRAIL BECAUSE   
YOU'RE GOING AROUND THE WONDER  
THAT GOING UP IN INCHES WIDE.   

00:34:21.715 --> 00:34:21.913
YOU'RE GOING AROUND THE WONDER  
THAT GOING UP IN INCHES WIDE.   
YEAH.                           

00:34:21.915 --> 00:34:25.917
THAT GOING UP IN INCHES WIDE.   
YEAH.                           
SO ALL OF THAT IS TO SAY THAT I 

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:28.186
YEAH.                           
SO ALL OF THAT IS TO SAY THAT I 
PERSONALLY THINK THERE'S MAYBE  

00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:28.953
SO ALL OF THAT IS TO SAY THAT I 
PERSONALLY THINK THERE'S MAYBE  
ANOTHER SOLUTION THERE AND IT   

00:34:28.955 --> 00:34:35.494
PERSONALLY THINK THERE'S MAYBE  
ANOTHER SOLUTION THERE AND IT   
WOULD BE THROUGH NOT HAVING     

00:34:49.342 --> 00:34:51.209
                            TO  
TREAT THAT AS A FIRE AND        
CLOSURE.                        

00:34:51.211 --> 00:34:54.312
TREAT THAT AS A FIRE AND        
CLOSURE.                        
HEY, LOOK AT THE CEILING HEIGHT 

00:34:54.314 --> 00:34:54.913
CLOSURE.                        
HEY, LOOK AT THE CEILING HEIGHT 
DOWNSTAIRS IT LOOKS LIKE THE    

00:34:54.915 --> 00:34:55.647
HEY, LOOK AT THE CEILING HEIGHT 
DOWNSTAIRS IT LOOKS LIKE THE    
FORCE WAS ONLY ABOUT A FOOT     

00:34:55.649 --> 00:34:56.314
DOWNSTAIRS IT LOOKS LIKE THE    
FORCE WAS ONLY ABOUT A FOOT     
THICK WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE      

00:34:56.316 --> 00:34:56.981
FORCE WAS ONLY ABOUT A FOOT     
THICK WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE      
ABOUT EIGHT POINT EIGHT AND     

00:34:56.983 --> 00:34:57.782
THICK WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE      
ABOUT EIGHT POINT EIGHT AND     
CEILING HEIGHT DOWN THERE AS    

00:34:57.784 --> 00:34:57.983
ABOUT EIGHT POINT EIGHT AND     
CEILING HEIGHT DOWN THERE AS    
WELL.                           

00:34:57.985 --> 00:34:58.783
CEILING HEIGHT DOWN THERE AS    
WELL.                           
>> IT DEPENDS TO THE TO YEAH    

00:34:58.785 --> 00:34:59.517
WELL.                           
>> IT DEPENDS TO THE TO YEAH    
FOR NIGHT IT'S IT'S ABOUT NINE  

00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:00.318
>> IT DEPENDS TO THE TO YEAH    
FOR NIGHT IT'S IT'S ABOUT NINE  
FEET WHERE THERE'S NO BEAMS BUT 

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.119
FOR NIGHT IT'S IT'S ABOUT NINE  
FEET WHERE THERE'S NO BEAMS BUT 
THE BEAMS COME DOWN LIKE 16 OR  

00:35:01.121 --> 00:35:01.720
FEET WHERE THERE'S NO BEAMS BUT 
THE BEAMS COME DOWN LIKE 16 OR  
18 INCHES DEPENDING ON WHERE    

00:35:01.722 --> 00:35:06.358
THE BEAMS COME DOWN LIKE 16 OR  
18 INCHES DEPENDING ON WHERE    
YOU ARE RIGHT.                  

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.025
18 INCHES DEPENDING ON WHERE    
YOU ARE RIGHT.                  
THEY HAVE IT HERE.              

00:35:07.027 --> 00:35:07.358
YOU ARE RIGHT.                  
THEY HAVE IT HERE.              
YEAH.                           

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.495
THEY HAVE IT HERE.              
YEAH.                           
COULD BRING IN A WINTER HELP    

00:35:10.497 --> 00:35:13.532
YEAH.                           
COULD BRING IN A WINTER HELP    
LIKE BREAKING THE LANDING INTO  

00:35:13.534 --> 00:35:14.466
COULD BRING IN A WINTER HELP    
LIKE BREAKING THE LANDING INTO  
THREE STEPS THAT THAT WOULD     

00:35:14.468 --> 00:35:18.203
LIKE BREAKING THE LANDING INTO  
THREE STEPS THAT THAT WOULD     
YEAH I DIDN'T THINK THAT THAT   

00:35:18.205 --> 00:35:18.737
THREE STEPS THAT THAT WOULD     
YEAH I DIDN'T THINK THAT THAT   
WAS GOING TO YEAH.              

00:35:18.739 --> 00:35:21.406
YEAH I DIDN'T THINK THAT THAT   
WAS GOING TO YEAH.              
SO THERE WAS A MINIMUM          

00:35:21.408 --> 00:35:22.140
WAS GOING TO YEAH.              
SO THERE WAS A MINIMUM          
DIMENSIONS TWO SIX INCHES       

00:35:22.142 --> 00:35:22.940
SO THERE WAS A MINIMUM          
DIMENSIONS TWO SIX INCHES       
AROUND THE CORNER I THINK THERE 

00:35:22.942 --> 00:35:24.776
DIMENSIONS TWO SIX INCHES       
AROUND THE CORNER I THINK THERE 
ARE THERE ARE THE CONFIGURATION 

00:35:24.778 --> 00:35:25.943
AROUND THE CORNER I THINK THERE 
ARE THERE ARE THE CONFIGURATION 
IF THERE WAS A WAY TO DO IT     

00:35:25.945 --> 00:35:28.980
ARE THERE ARE THE CONFIGURATION 
IF THERE WAS A WAY TO DO IT     
WITHOUT WINDERS IT WOULD BE     

00:35:28.982 --> 00:35:29.447
IF THERE WAS A WAY TO DO IT     
WITHOUT WINDERS IT WOULD BE     
SAFER RIGHT?                    

00:35:29.449 --> 00:35:29.648
WITHOUT WINDERS IT WOULD BE     
SAFER RIGHT?                    
SURE.                           

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:33.084
SAFER RIGHT?                    
SURE.                           
PRESSURE WELL SINCE THERE'S NOT 

00:35:33.086 --> 00:35:36.621
SURE.                           
PRESSURE WELL SINCE THERE'S NOT 
A FIRE IF IT'S NOT AS A FIRE    

00:35:36.623 --> 00:35:37.488
PRESSURE WELL SINCE THERE'S NOT 
A FIRE IF IT'S NOT AS A FIRE    
GOING TO A WINDOW IT WOULD HELP 

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.157
A FIRE IF IT'S NOT AS A FIRE    
GOING TO A WINDOW IT WOULD HELP 
PULL THAT STAIR BACK FOR THE    

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:40.825
GOING TO A WINDOW IT WOULD HELP 
PULL THAT STAIR BACK FOR THE    
GIVING YOU'RE GIVING YOUR 12    

00:35:40.827 --> 00:35:44.962
PULL THAT STAIR BACK FOR THE    
GIVING YOU'RE GIVING YOUR 12    
INCH OR 10 INCH PAST FOR        

00:35:44.964 --> 00:35:45.329
GIVING YOU'RE GIVING YOUR 12    
INCH OR 10 INCH PAST FOR        
HANDRAIL.                       

00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:45.664
INCH OR 10 INCH PAST FOR        
HANDRAIL.                       
YEAH.                           

00:35:45.666 --> 00:35:48.199
HANDRAIL.                       
YEAH.                           
YEAH, I'M SURE THAT ALL THE     

00:35:48.201 --> 00:35:51.636
YEAH.                           
YEAH, I'M SURE THAT ALL THE     
CONFIGURATIONS COULD WORK       

00:35:51.638 --> 00:35:51.969
YEAH, I'M SURE THAT ALL THE     
CONFIGURATIONS COULD WORK       
THERE.                          

00:35:51.971 --> 00:35:54.905
CONFIGURATIONS COULD WORK       
THERE.                          
OK, SO ANY OTHER DISCUSSION     

00:35:54.907 --> 00:35:59.610
THERE.                          
OK, SO ANY OTHER DISCUSSION     
OF A MOTION TO TABLE I GUESS    

00:35:59.612 --> 00:36:00.378
OK, SO ANY OTHER DISCUSSION     
OF A MOTION TO TABLE I GUESS    
CLARITY THAT THEY WANT TO TABLE 

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.647
OF A MOTION TO TABLE I GUESS    
CLARITY THAT THEY WANT TO TABLE 
AT RIGHT.                       

00:36:02.649 --> 00:36:03.914
CLARITY THAT THEY WANT TO TABLE 
AT RIGHT.                       
YOU KNOW, GIVEN WHAT HAS BEEN   

00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:07.118
AT RIGHT.                       
YOU KNOW, GIVEN WHAT HAS BEEN   
DISCUSSED I THINK WE CAN COME   

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:07.786
YOU KNOW, GIVEN WHAT HAS BEEN   
DISCUSSED I THINK WE CAN COME   
BACK AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION THAT WILL GIVE US A 
BETTER CHANCE TO EITHER DEVELOP 
A COMPLIANT STAIR OR PROVIDE

YOU LAY ON THE TABLE AND THEN   
YOU NEED A MOTION KICK IT OFF   

00:36:42.922 --> 00:36:45.590
