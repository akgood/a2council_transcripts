00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.192
MR. GERBER THAT WE WOULD PURSUE 
KEEPING THOSE WELLS.            
THAT WAS THE INTENT.            

00:42:05.194 --> 00:42:05.826
KEEPING THOSE WELLS.            
THAT WAS THE INTENT.            
BUT CONSTRUCTION IS             

00:42:05.828 --> 00:42:08.229
THAT WAS THE INTENT.            
BUT CONSTRUCTION IS             
CONSTRUCTION RIGHT?             

00:42:08.231 --> 00:42:09.163
BUT CONSTRUCTION IS             
CONSTRUCTION RIGHT?             
AND IT WASN'T SURE WHAT WOULD   

00:42:09.165 --> 00:42:09.564

AND IT WASN'T SURE WHAT WOULD   
HAPPEN.                         

00:42:09.566 --> 00:42:11.899
AND IT WASN'T SURE WHAT WOULD   
HAPPEN.                         
WE DID LOSE ONE OF THOSE WELLS  

00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:12.500
HAPPEN.                         
WE DID LOSE ONE OF THOSE WELLS  
IN THE PROCESS.                 

00:42:12.502 --> 00:42:13.434
WE DID LOSE ONE OF THOSE WELLS  
IN THE PROCESS.                 
SO WE HAVE 10 WELLS NOW THEY    

00:42:13.436 --> 00:42:16.470
IN THE PROCESS.                 
SO WE HAVE 10 WELLS NOW THEY    
ARE CURRENTLY HEATING COOLING A 

00:42:16.472 --> 00:42:19.339
SO WE HAVE 10 WELLS NOW THEY    
ARE CURRENTLY HEATING COOLING A 
PORTION OF THE BUILDING AND OUR 

00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:20.307
ARE CURRENTLY HEATING COOLING A 
PORTION OF THE BUILDING AND OUR 
INTENT IS TO USE THEM TO THE    

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:23.243
PORTION OF THE BUILDING AND OUR 
INTENT IS TO USE THEM TO THE    
EXTENT THAT WE CAN ON THIS      

00:42:23.245 --> 00:42:23.610
INTENT IS TO USE THEM TO THE    
EXTENT THAT WE CAN ON THIS

EXTENT THAT WE CAN ON THIS      
BUILDING.                       
SO AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T WE JUST    

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.782
BUILDING.                       
SO AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T WE JUST    
KICKED OFF HIRED AN MSP FIRM    

00:42:27.784 --> 00:42:30.918
SO AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T WE JUST    
KICKED OFF HIRED AN MSP FIRM    
LAST WEEK, GAVE THEM THAT       

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.318
KICKED OFF HIRED AN MSP FIRM    
LAST WEEK, GAVE THEM THAT       
DIRECTION.

LAST WEEK, GAVE THEM THAT       
DIRECTION.                      
BUT AS YOU ALL KNOW, THAT TAKES 

00:42:32.388 --> 00:42:35.656
DIRECTION.                      
BUT AS YOU ALL KNOW, THAT TAKES 
MONTHS TO GET THROUGH THAT      

00:42:35.658 --> 00:42:36.490
BUT AS YOU ALL KNOW, THAT TAKES 
MONTHS TO GET THROUGH THAT      
DESIGN AND I CAN'T TELL YOU     

00:42:36.492 --> 00:42:38.760
MONTHS TO GET THROUGH THAT      
DESIGN AND I CAN'T TELL YOU     
TODAY HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO   

00:42:38.762 --> 00:42:39.427
DESIGN AND I CAN'T TELL YOU     
TODAY HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO   
USE BUT THAT'S THE INTENT.      

00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:41.995
TODAY HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO   
USE BUT THAT'S THE INTENT.      
THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL           

00:42:41.997 --> 00:42:43.030
USE BUT THAT'S THE INTENT.      
THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL           
INVESTMENT IN THAT IN THOSE     

00:42:43.032 --> 00:42:46.734
THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL

WELLS THAT WE'D LIKE TO REUSE.  

00:42:46.736 --> 00:42:47.601
INVESTMENT IN THAT IN THOSE     
WELLS THAT WE'D LIKE TO REUSE.  
BUT IT'S IT'S NOWHERE NEAR      

00:42:47.603 --> 00:42:48.368
WELLS THAT WE'D LIKE TO REUSE.  
BUT IT'S IT'S NOWHERE NEAR      
ENOUGH TO HEAT AND COOL THE     

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.538
BUT IT'S IT'S NOWHERE NEAR      
ENOUGH TO HEAT AND COOL THE     
BUILDING AND THE LIMIT WITHDREW

00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.512
IS IS TYPICALLY ON THE ON THE   
COOLING I'M SORRY THE LIMIT IS  
ON THE HEATING SIDE.            

00:42:58.514 --> 00:42:58.846
COOLING I'M SORRY THE LIMIT IS  
ON THE HEATING SIDE.            
RIGHT.

ON THE HEATING SIDE.            
RIGHT.                          
SO WE HAVE ENOUGH TO COOL IT    

00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:02.049
RIGHT.                          
SO WE HAVE ENOUGH TO COOL IT    
SUPPLEMENT THE HEATING SIDE AND 

00:43:02.051 --> 00:43:02.717
SO WE HAVE ENOUGH TO COOL IT    
SUPPLEMENT THE HEATING SIDE AND 
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT    

00:43:02.719 --> 00:43:06.153
SUPPLEMENT THE HEATING SIDE AND

WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE GAS     
CONNECTION.                     
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NATURAL   

00:43:09.759 --> 00:43:12.293
CONNECTION.                     
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NATURAL   
GAS GENERATOR BEYOND THAT AGAIN 

00:43:12.295 --> 00:43:13.160
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NATURAL   
GAS GENERATOR BEYOND THAT AGAIN 
WE HAVEN'T DONE THE DESIGN.     

00:43:13.162 --> 00:43:14.027
GAS GENERATOR BEYOND THAT AGAIN 
WE HAVEN'T DONE THE DESIGN.     
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING

SUPPLEMENTAL GAS HEAT FOR THE   
COLD WEATHER MONTHS.            

00:43:27.443 --> 00:43:28.442
SUPPLEMENTAL GAS HEAT FOR THE   
COLD WEATHER MONTHS.            
WE WILL AT A MINIMUM PUT MAKE   

00:43:28.444 --> 00:43:31.845
COLD WEATHER MONTHS.            
WE WILL AT A MINIMUM PUT MAKE   
IT SOLAR READY ON THE ROOF AS   

00:43:31.847 --> 00:43:32.513
WE WILL AT A MINIMUM PUT MAKE   
IT SOLAR READY ON THE ROOF AS   
TO WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO PUT   

00:43:32.515 --> 00:43:35.449
IT SOLAR READY ON THE ROOF AS   
TO WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO PUT   
SOLAR PANELS UP OR NOT.         

00:43:35.451 --> 00:43:36.383
TO WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO PUT   
SOLAR PANELS UP OR NOT.         
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT       

00:43:36.385 --> 00:43:37.084
SOLAR PANELS UP OR NOT.         
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT       
BECAUSE THESE ARE GOING TO BE   

00:43:37.086 --> 00:43:38.652
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT       
BECAUSE THESE ARE GOING TO BE   
FOR SALE UNITS.                 

00:43:38.654 --> 00:43:39.554
BECAUSE THESE ARE GOING TO BE   
FOR SALE UNITS.                 
SO THEN YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT   

00:43:39.556 --> 00:43:40.387
FOR SALE UNITS.                 
SO THEN YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT   
WHO GETS THE SOLAR AND WHO      

00:43:40.389 --> 00:43:42.757
SO THEN YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT   
WHO GETS THE SOLAR AND WHO      
DOESN'T KIND OF THINGS BUT WE   

00:43:42.759 --> 00:43:43.691
WHO GETS THE SOLAR AND WHO      
DOESN'T KIND OF THINGS BUT WE   
WILL PREP IT FOR THAT AND ALL   

00:43:43.693 --> 00:43:47.261
DOESN'T KIND OF THINGS BUT WE   
WILL PREP IT FOR THAT AND ALL   
THE CAR SPACES WILL BE HAVE EV  

00:43:47.263 --> 00:43:50.798
WILL PREP IT FOR THAT AND ALL   
THE CAR SPACES WILL BE HAVE EV  
CHARGERS THEY WON'T BE READY.   

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.732
THE CAR SPACES WILL BE HAVE EV  
CHARGERS THEY WON'T BE READY.   
THEY'LL HAVE FULL CHARGERS THAT

DEVOTE A WHOLE BUNCH OF SPACE   
IT'S NOT GOING TO GET USED TO   
I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT     

00:57:22.745 --> 00:57:25.078
IT'S NOT GOING TO GET USED TO   
I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT     
THAT EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:35.581
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOR         
DENSITIES.                      
WE LOOKED AT FOUR STOREYS.      

01:08:35.583 --> 01:08:39.185
DENSITIES.                      
WE LOOKED AT FOUR STOREYS.      
WE LOOKED AT FOUR UNITS WHICH   

01:08:39.187 --> 01:08:39.985
WE LOOKED AT FOUR STOREYS.      
WE LOOKED AT FOUR UNITS WHICH   
HAD PARKING UNDERNEATH THE      

01:08:39.987 --> 01:08:43.455
WE LOOKED AT FOUR UNITS WHICH   
HAD PARKING UNDERNEATH THE      
BUILDING WHICH RAISED IT.       

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:46.492
HAD PARKING UNDERNEATH THE      
BUILDING WHICH RAISED IT.       
SO THESE SORT OF ITERATIONS     

01:08:46.494 --> 01:08:47.160
BUILDING WHICH RAISED IT.       
SO THESE SORT OF ITERATIONS     
WITH THE STRAIGHT DISTRICT      

01:08:47.162 --> 01:08:50.330
SO THESE SORT OF ITERATIONS     
WITH THE STRAIGHT DISTRICT      
COMMISSION SEEM TO NOT FIT      

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:51.197
WITH THE STRAIGHT DISTRICT      
COMMISSION SEEM TO NOT FIT      
THEIR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THIS     

01:08:51.199 --> 01:08:54.600
COMMISSION SEEM TO NOT FIT      
THEIR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THIS     
NEIGHBORHOOD SHOULD BE AND      

01:08:54.602 --> 01:08:55.201
THEIR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THIS     
NEIGHBORHOOD SHOULD BE AND      
WANTED LOWER DENSITY.           

01:08:55.203 --> 01:08:56.335
NEIGHBORHOOD SHOULD BE AND      
WANTED LOWER DENSITY.           
SO WE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION   

01:08:56.337 --> 01:08:59.171
WANTED LOWER DENSITY.           
SO WE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION   
IN WHICH WE BASICALLY HAVE A    

01:08:59.173 --> 01:09:02.175
SO WE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION   
IN WHICH WE BASICALLY HAVE A    
DUPLEX AND ONE OF THOSE HOUSING 

01:09:02.177 --> 01:09:05.677
IN WHICH WE BASICALLY HAVE A    
DUPLEX AND ONE OF THOSE HOUSING 
UNITS HAS AN 82 ABOVE THE       

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:06.311
DUPLEX AND ONE OF THOSE HOUSING 
UNITS HAS AN 82 ABOVE THE       
GARAGE ATTACHED TO IT.          

01:09:06.313 --> 01:09:09.382
UNITS HAS AN 82 ABOVE THE       
GARAGE ATTACHED TO IT.          
SO THE DWELLING UNITS ARE       

01:09:09.384 --> 01:09:10.149
GARAGE ATTACHED TO IT.          
SO THE DWELLING UNITS ARE       
SEPARATED BY GARAGE WHICH MAKES 

01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:12.851
SO THE DWELLING UNITS ARE       
SEPARATED BY GARAGE WHICH MAKES 
FOR GREAT ACOUSTICS SEPARATION  

01:09:12.853 --> 01:09:13.786
SEPARATED BY GARAGE WHICH MAKES 
FOR GREAT ACOUSTICS SEPARATION  
AND THE ACTU IS QUITE A WAYS    

01:09:13.788 --> 01:09:16.956
FOR GREAT ACOUSTICS SEPARATION  
AND THE ACTU IS QUITE A WAYS    
OFF TO THIS SIDE OF THAT.       

01:09:16.958 --> 01:09:21.060
AND THE ACTU IS QUITE A WAYS    
OFF TO THIS SIDE OF THAT.       
SO THE ACTU IS A NICE SIZE UNIT 

01:09:21.062 --> 01:09:21.794
OFF TO THIS SIDE OF THAT.       
SO THE ACTU IS A NICE SIZE UNIT 
ONE BEDROOM BUT FIVE HUNDRED    

01:09:21.796 --> 01:09:25.064
SO THE ACTU IS A NICE SIZE UNIT 
ONE BEDROOM BUT FIVE HUNDRED    
AND THIRTY FIVE SQUARE FEET AND 

01:09:25.066 --> 01:09:29.135
ONE BEDROOM BUT FIVE HUNDRED    
AND THIRTY FIVE SQUARE FEET AND 
IT WILL BELONG TO THE UNIT THAT 

01:09:29.137 --> 01:09:32.371
AND THIRTY FIVE SQUARE FEET AND 
IT WILL BELONG TO THE UNIT THAT 
IS CLOSEST TO THE SOUTH.        

01:09:32.373 --> 01:09:40.078
IT WILL BELONG TO THE UNIT THAT 
IS CLOSEST TO THE SOUTH.        
THEY'RE AND THE OTHER UNIT      

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:40.813
IS CLOSEST TO THE SOUTH.        
THEY'RE AND THE OTHER UNIT      
THEY'RE BOTH ROUGHLY TWENTY

80S FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE    
SQUARE ONE OF THE THINGS ON THE 
SITE PLAN THAT I LOOKED AT      

01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:51.457
SQUARE ONE OF THE THINGS ON THE 
SITE PLAN THAT I LOOKED AT      
DOING IS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN    

01:09:51.459 --> 01:09:52.324
SITE PLAN THAT I LOOKED AT      
DOING IS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN    
DOING HOUSING IN THE OLD WEST   

01:09:52.326 --> 01:09:55.160
DOING IS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN    
DOING HOUSING IN THE OLD WEST   
SIDE FOR MORE YEARS.            

01:09:55.162 --> 01:09:59.131
DOING HOUSING IN THE OLD WEST   
SIDE FOR MORE YEARS.            
I WANT TO SAY BUT OVER MANY     

01:09:59.133 --> 01:09:59.832
SIDE FOR MORE YEARS.            
I WANT TO SAY BUT OVER MANY     
PROJECTS AND WHEN WE DO         

01:09:59.834 --> 01:10:02.734
I WANT TO SAY BUT OVER MANY     
PROJECTS AND WHEN WE DO         
GARAGE'S WE FIND OUT THAT IF    

01:10:02.736 --> 01:10:03.436
PROJECTS AND WHEN WE DO         
GARAGE'S WE FIND OUT THAT IF    
IT'S A ONE CAR GARAGE THERE'S   

01:10:03.438 --> 01:10:06.572
GARAGE'S WE FIND OUT THAT IF    
IT'S A ONE CAR GARAGE THERE'S   
NO THERE NO CARS IN THE ONE CAR 

01:10:06.574 --> 01:10:07.239
IT'S A ONE CAR GARAGE THERE'S   
NO THERE NO CARS IN THE ONE CAR 
GARAGE, THEIR BIKES AND         

01:10:07.241 --> 01:10:09.742
NO THERE NO CARS IN THE ONE CAR 
GARAGE, THEIR BIKES AND         
STROLLERS AND ALL KINDS         

01:10:09.744 --> 01:10:10.276
GARAGE, THEIR BIKES AND         
STROLLERS AND ALL KINDS         
OF HOUSEHOLD STUFF.             

01:10:10.278 --> 01:10:13.613
STROLLERS AND ALL KINDS         
OF HOUSEHOLD STUFF.             
SO WE SORT OF ENVISIONED IN     

01:10:13.615 --> 01:10:14.547
OF HOUSEHOLD STUFF.             
SO WE SORT OF ENVISIONED IN     
THIS PROJECT WITH A TWO CAR     

01:10:14.549 --> 01:10:17.883
SO WE SORT OF ENVISIONED IN     
THIS PROJECT WITH A TWO CAR     
GARAGE THERE MAY BE NO CARS     

01:10:17.885 --> 01:10:18.217
THIS PROJECT WITH A TWO CAR     
GARAGE THERE MAY BE NO CARS     
THERE.                          

01:10:18.219 --> 01:10:19.085
GARAGE THERE MAY BE NO CARS     
THERE.                          
THERE MAY BE ONE CAR IN THAT    

01:10:19.087 --> 01:10:22.121
THERE.                          
THERE MAY BE ONE CAR IN THAT    
GARAGE AND THE REST THE OTHER   

01:10:22.123 --> 01:10:25.591
THERE MAY BE ONE CAR IN THAT    
GARAGE AND THE REST THE OTHER   
SIDE WILL BE BIKES AND STROLLER 

01:10:25.593 --> 01:10:26.526
GARAGE AND THE REST THE OTHER   
SIDE WILL BE BIKES AND STROLLER 
AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS.  

01:10:26.528 --> 01:10:28.994
SIDE WILL BE BIKES AND STROLLER 
AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS.  
SO THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED I    

01:10:28.996 --> 01:10:29.829
AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS.  
SO THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED I    
WANTED TO NARROW THE IMPACT     

01:10:29.831 --> 01:10:33.832
SO THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED I    
WANTED TO NARROW THE IMPACT     
OF THE DRIVEWAY CURB CUTS.      

01:10:33.834 --> 01:10:34.900
WANTED TO NARROW THE IMPACT     
OF THE DRIVEWAY CURB CUTS.      
SO THAT'S WHY THE CURB CUTS ARE 

01:10:34.902 --> 01:10:36.668
OF THE DRIVEWAY CURB CUTS.      
SO THAT'S WHY THE CURB CUTS ARE 
NARROW AND AT THE STREET AND    

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:41.306
SO THAT'S WHY THE CURB CUTS ARE 
NARROW AND AT THE STREET AND    
THEY ARE I CAN'T REMEMBER       

01:10:41.308 --> 01:10:41.941
NARROW AND AT THE STREET AND    
THEY ARE I CAN'T REMEMBER       
EXACTLY BUT THEY'RE ABOUT 13    

01:10:41.943 --> 01:10:45.344
THEY ARE I CAN'T REMEMBER       
EXACTLY BUT THEY'RE ABOUT 13    
FEET WIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE     

01:10:45.346 --> 01:10:46.145
EXACTLY BUT THEY'RE ABOUT 13    
FEET WIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE     
THAT I THINK SO THAT THEY'RE    

01:10:46.147 --> 01:10:48.748
FEET WIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE     
THAT I THINK SO THAT THEY'RE    
SORT OF THEY'RE NOT A FULL      

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:49.748
THAT I THINK SO THAT THEY'RE    
SORT OF THEY'RE NOT A FULL      
TWENTY FOOT TWENTY TWO FEET     

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:50.382
SORT OF THEY'RE NOT A FULL      
TWENTY FOOT TWENTY TWO FEET     
WIDE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF  

01:10:50.384 --> 01:10:53.151
TWENTY FOOT TWENTY TWO FEET     
WIDE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF  
YOU WERE BACKING CARS OUT       

01:10:53.153 --> 01:10:53.519
WIDE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF  
YOU WERE BACKING CARS OUT       
OF THERE.                       

01:10:53.521 --> 01:10:56.789
YOU WERE BACKING CARS OUT       
OF THERE.                       
SO THAT REDUCES THE AUTO IMPACT 

01:10:56.791 --> 01:10:57.422
OF THERE.                       
SO THAT REDUCES THE AUTO IMPACT 
ON THE STREET.                  

01:10:57.424 --> 01:10:58.324
SO THAT REDUCES THE AUTO IMPACT 
ON THE STREET.                  
JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT.  

01:10:58.326 --> 01:11:00.693
ON THE STREET.                  
JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT.  
THE OTHER THING WHEN THIS WAS   

01:11:00.695 --> 01:11:01.561
JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT.  
THE OTHER THING WHEN THIS WAS   
ALMONDS CLEANERS THEY BASICALLY 

01:11:01.563 --> 01:11:04.964
THE OTHER THING WHEN THIS WAS   
ALMONDS CLEANERS THEY BASICALLY 
HAD PAVED THE ENTIRE SITE       

01:11:04.966 --> 01:11:05.898
ALMONDS CLEANERS THEY BASICALLY 
HAD PAVED THE ENTIRE SITE       
EXCEPT FOR A SMALL BRANCH AREA  

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.200
HAD PAVED THE ENTIRE SITE       
EXCEPT FOR A SMALL BRANCH AREA  
SO IMPERVIOUS AREA WAS VERY,    

01:11:08.202 --> 01:11:09.034
EXCEPT FOR A SMALL BRANCH AREA  
SO IMPERVIOUS AREA WAS VERY,    
VERY LITTLE AND WE'RE ENDING UP 

01:11:09.036 --> 01:11:12.471
SO IMPERVIOUS AREA WAS VERY,    
VERY LITTLE AND WE'RE ENDING UP 
HERE WITH CAN'T REMEMBER MAYBE  

01:11:12.473 --> 01:11:15.874
VERY LITTLE AND WE'RE ENDING UP 
HERE WITH CAN'T REMEMBER MAYBE  
CATHY REMEMBERS WHAT THE GROUND 

01:11:15.876 --> 01:11:16.342
HERE WITH CAN'T REMEMBER MAYBE  
CATHY REMEMBERS WHAT THE GROUND 
COVERAGE WAS HERE.              

01:11:16.344 --> 01:11:17.210
CATHY REMEMBERS WHAT THE GROUND 
COVERAGE WAS HERE.              
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED SHE COULD  

01:11:17.212 --> 01:11:20.279
COVERAGE WAS HERE.              
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED SHE COULD  
CHIME IN ON THAT.               

01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:21.047
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED SHE COULD  
CHIME IN ON THAT.               
BUT WE'VE DRASTICALLY REDUCED   

01:11:21.049 --> 01:11:24.683
CHIME IN ON THAT.               
BUT WE'VE DRASTICALLY REDUCED   
THE IMPERMEABLE AREA ON THE     

01:11:24.685 --> 01:11:27.119
BUT WE'VE DRASTICALLY REDUCED   
THE IMPERMEABLE AREA ON THE     
SITE FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE.   

01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:28.120
THE IMPERMEABLE AREA ON THE     
SITE FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE.   
BUT YET WE'RE STILL TAKING CARE 

01:11:28.122 --> 01:11:28.854
SITE FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE.   
BUT YET WE'RE STILL TAKING CARE 
OF THE STORMWATER AND THE       

01:11:28.856 --> 01:11:32.491
BUT YET WE'RE STILL TAKING CARE 
OF THE STORMWATER AND THE       
DISCHARGE FROM THE SOME PUMPS   

01:11:32.493 --> 01:11:34.894
OF THE STORMWATER AND THE       
DISCHARGE FROM THE SOME PUMPS   
WILL BE HANDLED ON SITE SO THAT 

01:11:34.896 --> 01:11:36.095
DISCHARGE FROM THE SOME PUMPS   
WILL BE HANDLED ON SITE SO THAT 
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF IN  

01:11:36.097 --> 01:11:39.431
WILL BE HANDLED ON SITE SO THAT 
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF IN  
THE BUILDINGS.                  

01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:43.135
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF IN  
THE BUILDINGS.                  
>> ARE WE SET TO DESIGN A KIND  

01:11:43.137 --> 01:11:44.003
THE BUILDINGS.                  
>> ARE WE SET TO DESIGN A KIND  
OF A COMMERCIAL STYLE BUILDING  

01:11:44.005 --> 01:11:47.806
>> ARE WE SET TO DESIGN A KIND  
OF A COMMERCIAL STYLE BUILDING  
WHICH IS FLAT ROOF AND KIND     

01:11:47.808 --> 01:11:50.977
OF A COMMERCIAL STYLE BUILDING  
WHICH IS FLAT ROOF AND KIND     
OF IN KEEPING WITH THE          

01:11:50.979 --> 01:11:54.079
WHICH IS FLAT ROOF AND KIND     
OF IN KEEPING WITH THE          
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ON THE     

01:11:54.081 --> 01:11:55.013
OF IN KEEPING WITH THE          
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ON THE     
SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND    

01:11:55.015 --> 01:11:58.651
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ON THE     
SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND    
THE LARGE APARTMENT BUILDING TO 

01:11:58.653 --> 01:12:02.621
SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND    
THE LARGE APARTMENT BUILDING TO 
THE EAST SO SO THAT HAS A MORE  

01:12:02.623 --> 01:12:03.488
THE LARGE APARTMENT BUILDING TO 
THE EAST SO SO THAT HAS A MORE  
OF A COMMERCIAL FEEL BUT YET IT 

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:04.156
THE EAST SO SO THAT HAS A MORE  
OF A COMMERCIAL FEEL BUT YET IT 
HAS THE SCALE AND CHARACTER     

01:12:04.158 --> 01:12:06.458
OF A COMMERCIAL FEEL BUT YET IT 
HAS THE SCALE AND CHARACTER     
OF A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.  

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.627
HAS THE SCALE AND CHARACTER     
OF A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.  
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT PART  

01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:10.529
OF A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.  
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT PART  
OF OUR PRESENTATION WHERE WE    

01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:11.363
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT PART  
OF OUR PRESENTATION WHERE WE    
SUPERIMPOSE THE SITE PLAN ON    

01:12:11.365 --> 01:12:14.600
OF OUR PRESENTATION WHERE WE    
SUPERIMPOSE THE SITE PLAN ON    
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, IT'S PRETTY   

01:12:14.602 --> 01:12:18.303
SUPERIMPOSE THE SITE PLAN ON    
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, IT'S PRETTY   
OBVIOUS THAT IT'S IT'S QUITE A  

01:12:18.305 --> 01:12:19.004
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, IT'S PRETTY   
OBVIOUS THAT IT'S IT'S QUITE A  
SMALL DEVELOPMENT COMPARED TO   

01:12:19.006 --> 01:12:22.274
OBVIOUS THAT IT'S IT'S QUITE A  
SMALL DEVELOPMENT COMPARED TO   
THE HOUSES AROUND IT.           

01:12:22.276 --> 01:12:23.308
SMALL DEVELOPMENT COMPARED TO   
THE HOUSES AROUND IT.           
SO THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY OUR  

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:26.512
THE HOUSES AROUND IT.           
SO THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY OUR  
APPROACH IN THIS PROJECT.       

01:12:26.514 --> 01:12:30.916
SO THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY OUR  
APPROACH IN THIS PROJECT.       
AND IF YOU HAVE I'LL BE HERE TO 

01:12:30.918 --> 01:12:31.551
APPROACH IN THIS PROJECT.       
AND IF YOU HAVE I'LL BE HERE TO 
ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AND  

01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:32.217
AND IF YOU HAVE I'LL BE HERE TO

COMMUNITY IN SEVEN DIFFERENT    
WAYS.                           

01:56:16.174 --> 01:56:19.909
COMMUNITY IN SEVEN DIFFERENT    
WAYS.                           
THE CHALLENGE IS JUST JUST      

01:56:19.911 --> 01:56:24.013
WAYS.                           
THE CHALLENGE IS JUST JUST      
BECAUSE YOU MAKE A 50 STORIES   

01:56:24.015 --> 01:56:24.714
THE CHALLENGE IS JUST JUST      
BECAUSE YOU MAKE A 50 STORIES   
DOESN'T MEAN THE CAPITAL WILL   

01:56:24.716 --> 01:56:25.715
BECAUSE YOU MAKE A 50 STORIES   
DOESN'T MEAN THE CAPITAL WILL   
BE THERE TO BUILD IT AND THEN   

01:56:25.717 --> 01:56:28.351
DOESN'T MEAN THE CAPITAL WILL   
BE THERE TO BUILD IT AND THEN   
ADDITIONALLY HOW MUCH OF THAT   

01:56:28.353 --> 01:56:29.285
BE THERE TO BUILD IT AND THEN   
ADDITIONALLY HOW MUCH OF THAT   
IS GOING TO BE SOUGHT THROUGH   

01:56:29.287 --> 01:56:31.888
ADDITIONALLY HOW MUCH OF THAT   
IS GOING TO BE SOUGHT THROUGH   
THE LAND?                       

01:56:31.890 --> 01:56:32.889
IS GOING TO BE SOUGHT THROUGH   
THE LAND?                       
THE LAND OWNERS ARE GOING TO    

01:56:32.891 --> 01:56:33.689
THE LAND?                       
THE LAND OWNERS ARE GOING TO    
TRY TO CAPTURE THAT THROUGH     

01:56:33.691 --> 01:56:36.292
THE LAND OWNERS ARE GOING TO    
TRY TO CAPTURE THAT THROUGH     
INCREASED LAND VALUE.           

01:56:36.294 --> 01:56:36.759
TRY TO CAPTURE THAT THROUGH     
INCREASED LAND VALUE.           
RIGHT.                          

01:56:36.761 --> 01:56:42.131
INCREASED LAND VALUE.           
RIGHT.                          
SO I THINK AT A HIGH LEVEL MORE 

01:56:42.133 --> 01:56:42.866
RIGHT.                          
SO I THINK AT A HIGH LEVEL MORE 
CAPITAL MARKETS ARE EXTREMELY   

01:56:42.868 --> 01:56:43.600
SO I THINK AT A HIGH LEVEL MORE 
CAPITAL MARKETS ARE EXTREMELY   
CYCLICAL AND I THINK YOUR       

01:56:43.602 --> 01:56:45.402
CAPITAL MARKETS ARE EXTREMELY   
CYCLICAL AND I THINK YOUR       
COMMUNITY IS DOING A GREAT JOB  

01:56:45.404 --> 01:56:46.202
CYCLICAL AND I THINK YOUR       
COMMUNITY IS DOING A GREAT JOB  
IN MAKING HAY WHILE THE CAPITAL 

01:56:46.204 --> 01:56:49.506
COMMUNITY IS DOING A GREAT JOB  
IN MAKING HAY WHILE THE CAPITAL 
IS THERE BECAUSE WHEN WHEN WHEN 

01:56:49.508 --> 01:56:52.976
IN MAKING HAY WHILE THE CAPITAL 
IS THERE BECAUSE WHEN WHEN WHEN 
ONE BUILDING DOESN'T FILL OR    

01:56:52.978 --> 01:56:53.777
IS THERE BECAUSE WHEN WHEN WHEN 
ONE BUILDING DOESN'T FILL OR    
THERE'S TWO YEARS OF NEGATIVE   

01:56:53.779 --> 01:56:54.510
ONE BUILDING DOESN'T FILL OR    
THERE'S TWO YEARS OF NEGATIVE   
RENT GROWTH, THE SPIGOT WILL    

01:56:54.512 --> 01:56:57.280
THERE'S TWO YEARS OF NEGATIVE   
RENT GROWTH, THE SPIGOT WILL    
TURN OFF AND YOU CAN MAKE ONE   

01:56:57.282 --> 01:56:58.081
RENT GROWTH, THE SPIGOT WILL    
TURN OFF AND YOU CAN MAKE ONE   
HUNDRED STORIES AND NO ONE WILL 

01:56:58.083 --> 01:56:58.815
TURN OFF AND YOU CAN MAKE ONE   
HUNDRED STORIES AND NO ONE WILL 
GIVE YOU THE MONEY TO BUILD IT. 

01:56:58.817 --> 01:57:00.883
HUNDRED STORIES AND NO ONE WILL 
GIVE YOU THE MONEY TO BUILD IT. 
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S  

01:57:00.885 --> 01:57:04.186
GIVE YOU THE MONEY TO BUILD IT. 
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S  
JUST GOOD TO BE TO BE SMART

IT'S KIND OF BALANCING THAT     
THAT YOU THINK ABOUT FOR HOW

WHAT I SEE WITH ADDITIONAL      
HEIGHT IS WHAT THEY MENTIONED   

01:58:21.933 --> 01:58:22.465
WHAT I SEE WITH ADDITIONAL      
HEIGHT IS WHAT THEY MENTIONED   
ON THE CAPITAL SIDE.            

01:58:22.467 --> 01:58:23.399
HEIGHT IS WHAT THEY MENTIONED   
ON THE CAPITAL SIDE.            
IT'S NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO

IT'S NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO  
TOP OUT AT THAT HEIGHT THEY'RE  

01:58:26.004 --> 01:58:26.603
IT'S NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO  
TOP OUT AT THAT HEIGHT THEY'RE  
GIVEN YOU WILL INDUCE SOME      

01:58:26.605 --> 01:58:29.605
TOP OUT AT THAT HEIGHT THEY'RE  
GIVEN YOU WILL INDUCE SOME      
VARIETY IN THE BUILDING THAT    

01:58:29.607 --> 01:58:34.177
GIVEN YOU WILL INDUCE SOME      
VARIETY IN THE BUILDING THAT

THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE CLEAN YOU 
KNOW, JOE MENTIONED THERE'S NO

EXTRA HEIGHT AFFORDS YOU TO DO  

01:58:45.490 --> 01:58:48.491
AND SIMPLE BUILDING BUT THE     
EXTRA HEIGHT AFFORDS YOU TO DO  
IS ASSESS YOUR UNIT MIX AND     

01:58:48.493 --> 01:58:49.426
EXTRA HEIGHT AFFORDS YOU TO DO  
IS ASSESS YOUR UNIT MIX AND     
THINK WHERE CAN WE ADD IN SOME

TREATING THOSE FLOORS PERHAPS A 
LITTLE MORE DIFFERENTLY AND     
GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE

LIKE I THINK WHAT REALLY        
CARRIES THE MOST WEIGHT FOR     
AFFORDABILITY A LOT OF PRIVATE

DEVELOPMENT YOU'RE GOING TO     
STOP YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE 

02:09:58.129 --> 02:10:00.595

STOP YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE 
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THROUGH

STOP YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE 
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THROUGH    
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

02:10:04.168 --> 02:10:05.100
OR MANDATING AFFORDABLE         
REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO DO IT 
BY A TON OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE

OVERALL LEVEL DOWN IN MY        

02:10:08.305 --> 02:10:09.038
PRIVATE SPACE AND BRINGING THE  
OVERALL LEVEL DOWN IN MY        
OPINION BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S    

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:09.738
OVERALL LEVEL DOWN IN MY        
OPINION BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S    
GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE SO     

02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:11.741
OPINION BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S    
GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE SO     
MUCH MORE.                      

02:10:11.743 --> 02:10:12.141
GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE SO     
MUCH MORE.                      
RIGHT.                          

02:10:12.143 --> 02:10:13.075
MUCH MORE.                      
RIGHT.                          
BECAUSE YOU COULD BUILD A       

02:10:13.077 --> 02:10:15.677
RIGHT.                          
BECAUSE YOU COULD BUILD A       
THOUSAND AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT   

02:10:15.679 --> 02:10:16.612
BECAUSE YOU COULD BUILD A       
THOUSAND AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT   
IF YOU KNOW A THOUSAND MORE     

02:10:16.614 --> 02:10:18.948
THOUSAND AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT   
IF YOU KNOW A THOUSAND MORE     
IT'S JUST LIKE THE MATH DOESN'T 

02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:19.915
IF YOU KNOW A THOUSAND MORE     
IT'S JUST LIKE THE MATH DOESN'T 
WORK WHEN YOU REALLY BREAK IT   

02:10:19.917 --> 02:10:20.816
IT'S JUST LIKE THE MATH DOESN'T 
WORK WHEN YOU REALLY BREAK IT   
DOWN I'D BE HAPPY TO TO TRY TO  

02:10:20.818 --> 02:10:22.651
WORK WHEN YOU REALLY BREAK IT   
DOWN I'D BE HAPPY TO TO TRY TO  
IMPACT A LITTLE BIT MORE        

02:10:22.653 --> 02:10:23.252
DOWN I'D BE HAPPY TO TO TRY TO  
IMPACT A LITTLE BIT MORE        
MATHEMATICALLY BUT THE          

02:10:23.254 --> 02:10:23.853
IMPACT A LITTLE BIT MORE        
MATHEMATICALLY BUT THE          
SUSTAINABILITY DOES SOMEWHAT    

02:10:23.855 --> 02:10:27.055
MATHEMATICALLY BUT THE          
SUSTAINABILITY DOES SOMEWHAT    
RUN A LITTLE COUNTER TO THAT.   

02:10:27.057 --> 02:10:27.489
SUSTAINABILITY DOES SOMEWHAT    
RUN A LITTLE COUNTER TO THAT.   
RIGHT.                          

02:10:27.491 --> 02:10:28.257
RUN A LITTLE COUNTER TO THAT.   
RIGHT.                          
WHEN WE DO THESE SUSTAINABLE    

02:10:28.259 --> 02:10:28.991
RIGHT.                          
WHEN WE DO THESE SUSTAINABLE    
THINGS WE'RE MAKING THESE       

02:10:28.993 --> 02:10:31.193
WHEN WE DO THESE SUSTAINABLE    
THINGS WE'RE MAKING THESE       
THINGS MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD  

02:10:31.195 --> 02:10:31.827
THINGS WE'RE MAKING THESE       
THINGS MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD  
AND THEREFORE INCREASING THE    

02:10:31.829 --> 02:10:34.763
THINGS MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD  
AND THEREFORE INCREASING THE    
HURDLE FOR ATTRACTING CAPITAL.  

02:10:34.765 --> 02:10:35.730
AND THEREFORE INCREASING THE    
HURDLE FOR ATTRACTING CAPITAL.  
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE     

02:10:35.732 --> 02:10:36.365
HURDLE FOR ATTRACTING CAPITAL.  
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE     
MOST SUSTAINABLE THING YOU CAN  

02:10:36.367 --> 02:10:39.101
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE     
MOST SUSTAINABLE THING YOU CAN  
DO IS REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON    

02:10:39.103 --> 02:10:41.970
MOST SUSTAINABLE THING YOU CAN  
DO IS REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON    
VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND           

02:10:41.972 --> 02:10:42.904
DO IS REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON    
VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND           
INCREASING THE ABILITY FOR FOR  

02:10:42.906 --> 02:10:46.775
VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND           
INCREASING THE ABILITY FOR FOR  
YOU TO NOT NEED A CAR AND WALK  

02:10:46.777 --> 02:10:50.045
INCREASING THE ABILITY FOR FOR  
YOU TO NOT NEED A CAR AND WALK  
EVERYWHERE AND CREATING THESE

YOU TO NOT NEED A CAR AND WALK

SOCIETY LIKE BUILDING DENSITY   
IN THESE PLACES IS ABSOLUTELY   

02:11:01.559 --> 02:11:02.425
SOCIETY LIKE BUILDING DENSITY   
IN THESE PLACES IS ABSOLUTELY   
THE WAY TO DO IT.               

02:11:02.427 --> 02:11:03.292
IN THESE PLACES IS ABSOLUTELY   
THE WAY TO DO IT.               
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WHAT       

02:11:03.294 --> 02:11:03.959
THE WAY TO DO IT.               
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WHAT       
HAPPENS IN DALLAS WHEN THEY     

02:11:03.961 --> 02:11:06.428
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WHAT       
HAPPENS IN DALLAS WHEN THEY     
JUST ABANDONED RINGS AROUND THE

HAPPENS IN DALLAS WHEN THEY     
JUST ABANDONED RINGS AROUND THE 
METROPLEX AND GO TO THE NEXT

JUST ABANDONED RINGS AROUND THE 
METROPLEX AND GO TO THE NEXT    
ONE OUT THOSE CITY SERVICES ARE 

02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:10.199
METROPLEX AND GO TO THE NEXT    
ONE OUT THOSE CITY SERVICES ARE 
STRUGGLING SO MUCH TO KEEP KEEP 

02:11:10.201 --> 02:11:12.935
ONE OUT THOSE CITY SERVICES ARE 
STRUGGLING SO MUCH TO KEEP KEEP 
UP WITH PAYS.                   

02:11:12.937 --> 02:11:14.003

STILL CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT.    
IT'S JUST NOT A SUSTAINABLE WAY 

02:11:17.374 --> 02:11:18.140
STILL CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT.    
IT'S JUST NOT A SUSTAINABLE WAY 
TO BUILD A SOCIETY NOT NOTHING  

02:11:18.142 --> 02:11:21.110
IT'S JUST NOT A SUSTAINABLE WAY 
TO BUILD A SOCIETY NOT NOTHING

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS      
GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.      
I DO THINK THERE IS THERE IS

SUSTAINABILITY COMPONENT TO THE 
PROJECT YOU CAN SEE IN THIS     
IMAGE HERE YOU HAVE INTEGRATED  

02:12:02.253 --> 02:12:03.118
PROJECT YOU CAN SEE IN THIS     
IMAGE HERE YOU HAVE INTEGRATED  
THESE EXTERIOR LOUVERS INTO THE 

02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:05.821
IMAGE HERE YOU HAVE INTEGRATED  
THESE EXTERIOR LOUVERS INTO THE 
SIDE SO YOU'RE WELCOMING        

02:12:05.823 --> 02:12:06.489
THESE EXTERIOR LOUVERS INTO THE

ADDITIONAL FRESH OUTSIDE AIR    
THAT'S NOT BEING FED DOWN TO

THE CORRIDORS AND THEN INTO THE
