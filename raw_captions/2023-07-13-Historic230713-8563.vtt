UPPER MIDDLE CLASS AND IT&apos;S     
JUST A WAY THE UNIVERSITY IS    

01:09:15.423 --> 01:09:15.888
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS AND IT&apos;S     
JUST A WAY THE UNIVERSITY IS    
HISPANO OUT.

I THINK THIS WOULD BE AN        
ADDITION AND THE TRACK RECORD   

01:09:18.893 --> 01:09:23.296
I THINK THIS WOULD BE AN        
ADDITION AND THE TRACK RECORD   
OF MR RAHMATI IN THE BUILDING

SO I&apos;D LIKE TO TOUCH ON JUST A  
FEW KIND OF CODE SAFETY ISSUES. 
I MEAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT      

01:09:45.019 --> 01:09:46.019
FEW KIND OF CODE SAFETY ISSUES. 
I MEAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT      
OF THE BUILDING A BLOCK MASONRY 

01:09:46.021 --> 01:09:49.922
I MEAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT      
OF THE BUILDING A BLOCK MASONRY 
FIREWALL&apos;S ON THE PROPERTY      

01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:50.623
OF THE BUILDING A BLOCK MASONRY 
FIREWALL&apos;S ON THE PROPERTY

LINES, THE MIDDLE&apos;S WOOD        
STRUCTURE.                      
IT WAS INTENDED THAT WHEN A

IT WAS INTENDED THAT WHEN A     
FIRE HAPPENS THE INTERIOR THE   

01:09:56.931 --> 01:09:57.730
IT WAS INTENDED THAT WHEN A     
FIRE HAPPENS THE INTERIOR THE   
STRUCTURE WE COULD BASICALLY    

01:09:57.732 --> 01:10:01.467
FIRE HAPPENS THE INTERIOR THE   
STRUCTURE WE COULD BASICALLY    
BURN OUT AND MAINTAIN THE       

01:10:01.469 --> 01:10:02.001
STRUCTURE WE COULD BASICALLY    
BURN OUT AND MAINTAIN THE       
SAFETY OF THE ADJACENT

SAFETY OF THE ADJACENT          
STRUCTURES.                     
WE SURE WE CAN JUST REPLACE THE 

01:10:05.507 --> 01:10:08.307
STRUCTURES.                     
WE SURE WE CAN JUST REPLACE THE 
JOINT I ONCE THE BARON HAPPENS, 

01:10:08.309 --> 01:10:09.042
WE SURE WE CAN JUST REPLACE THE 
JOINT I ONCE THE BARON HAPPENS, 
EVERYTHING IN THE BUILDING      

01:10:09.044 --> 01:10:09.909
JOINT I ONCE THE BARON HAPPENS, 
EVERYTHING IN THE BUILDING      
BASICALLY SHOULD BE JUST TAKEN  

01:10:09.911 --> 01:10:12.244
EVERYTHING IN THE BUILDING      
BASICALLY SHOULD BE JUST TAKEN  
OUT AND REBUILT.                

01:10:12.246 --> 01:10:13.312
BASICALLY SHOULD BE JUST TAKEN  
OUT AND REBUILT.                
SO IF WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THE   

01:10:13.314 --> 01:10:15.981
OUT AND REBUILT.                
SO IF WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THE   
SAME STRUCTURE, SURE WE COULD   

01:10:15.983 --> 01:10:19.418
SO IF WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THE   
SAME STRUCTURE, SURE WE COULD   
BECAUSE WE&apos;RE TRYING TO CHANGE  

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:19.818
SAME STRUCTURE, SURE WE COULD   
BECAUSE WE&apos;RE TRYING TO CHANGE  
THE MARKET.                     

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.886
BECAUSE WE&apos;RE TRYING TO CHANGE  
THE MARKET.                     
WE CAN&apos;T IF YOU NEED TO USE     

01:10:20.888 --> 01:10:24.356
THE MARKET.                     
WE CAN&apos;T IF YOU NEED TO USE     
AGAIN LIKE A MASONIC TEMPLE WE  

01:10:24.358 --> 01:10:25.290
WE CAN&apos;T IF YOU NEED TO USE     
AGAIN LIKE A MASONIC TEMPLE WE  
CAN&apos;T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THE    

01:10:25.292 --> 01:10:28.461
AGAIN LIKE A MASONIC TEMPLE WE  
CAN&apos;T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THE    
THIRD FOR AT ALL.               

01:10:28.463 --> 01:10:29.328
CAN&apos;T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THE    
THIRD FOR AT ALL.               
WE COULD JUST REBUILD BUT       

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:31.797
THIRD FOR AT ALL.               
WE COULD JUST REBUILD BUT       
THERE&apos;S NO MARKET FOR THAT TYPE 

01:10:31.799 --> 01:10:32.265
WE COULD JUST REBUILD BUT       
THERE&apos;S NO MARKET FOR THAT TYPE 
OF STRUCTURE.                   

01:10:32.267 --> 01:10:32.999
THERE&apos;S NO MARKET FOR THAT TYPE 
OF STRUCTURE.                   
WE COULD GO TO BUSINESS BUT WE  

01:10:33.001 --> 01:10:35.635
OF STRUCTURE.                   
WE COULD GO TO BUSINESS BUT WE  
STILL CANNOT BUILD ANY ANY      

01:10:35.637 --> 01:10:36.301
WE COULD GO TO BUSINESS BUT WE  
STILL CANNOT BUILD ANY ANY      
BIGGER SQUARE FOOTAGE.          

01:10:36.303 --> 01:10:40.239
STILL CANNOT BUILD ANY ANY      
BIGGER SQUARE FOOTAGE.          
SO IT REALLY IS NOT VIABLE FOR  

01:10:40.241 --> 01:10:40.440
BIGGER SQUARE FOOTAGE.          
SO IT REALLY IS NOT VIABLE FOR  
THAT.                           

01:10:40.442 --> 01:10:43.042
SO IT REALLY IS NOT VIABLE FOR  
THAT.                           
WE STILL HAVE TO PUT STAIRS IN  

01:10:43.044 --> 01:10:43.876
THAT.                           
WE STILL HAVE TO PUT STAIRS IN  
ELEVATORS AND WE&apos;RE NOT GETTING 

01:10:43.878 --> 01:10:47.479
WE STILL HAVE TO PUT STAIRS IN  
ELEVATORS AND WE&apos;RE NOT GETTING 
LESS BANG FOR THE SO TO DO      

01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:51.250
ELEVATORS AND WE&apos;RE NOT GETTING 
LESS BANG FOR THE SO TO DO      
RESIDENTIAL WE CAN BUILD THIS   

01:10:51.252 --> 01:10:52.284
LESS BANG FOR THE SO TO DO      
RESIDENTIAL WE CAN BUILD THIS   
THING OUT OF THE WOOD TO GET    

01:10:52.286 --> 01:10:52.952
RESIDENTIAL WE CAN BUILD THIS   
THING OUT OF THE WOOD TO GET    
OVER ANY HIGHER THAN THE THREE  

01:10:52.954 --> 01:10:54.387
THING OUT OF THE WOOD TO GET    
OVER ANY HIGHER THAN THE THREE  
FEET IN TYPE THREE              

01:10:54.389 --> 01:10:54.854
OVER ANY HIGHER THAN THE THREE  
FEET IN TYPE THREE              
CONSTRUCTION.                   

01:10:54.856 --> 01:10:58.123
FEET IN TYPE THREE              
CONSTRUCTION.                   
SO THAT&apos;S WHY YOU HAVE TO GO TO 

01:10:58.125 --> 01:10:59.358
CONSTRUCTION.                   
SO THAT&apos;S WHY YOU HAVE TO GO TO 
STEEL AND THEN WITH THAT WE GOT 

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.662
SO THAT&apos;S WHY YOU HAVE TO GO TO 
STEEL AND THEN WITH THAT WE GOT 
THE FIRE ON THE SIDE.           

01:11:02.664 --> 01:11:05.998
STEEL AND THEN WITH THAT WE GOT 
THE FIRE ON THE SIDE.           
I THINK THE DETAIL OF THE FLOOR 

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:06.899
THE FIRE ON THE SIDE.           
I THINK THE DETAIL OF THE FLOOR 
ALSO IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT  

01:11:06.901 --> 01:11:09.968
I THINK THE DETAIL OF THE FLOOR 
ALSO IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT  
TRYING TO DISTINGUISH THE SIDE, 

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:13.105
ALSO IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT  
TRYING TO DISTINGUISH THE SIDE, 
WE COULD INSET THOSE WALLS LIKE 

01:11:13.107 --> 01:11:14.140
TRYING TO DISTINGUISH THE SIDE, 
WE COULD INSET THOSE WALLS LIKE 
EIGHT INCHES LET&apos;S SAY JUST TO  

01:11:14.142 --> 01:11:18.878
WE COULD INSET THOSE WALLS LIKE 
EIGHT INCHES LET&apos;S SAY JUST TO  
DISTINGUISH THE OLD TO THE NEW  

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.180
EIGHT INCHES LET&apos;S SAY JUST TO  
DISTINGUISH THE OLD TO THE NEW  
CMU.                            

01:11:21.182 --> 01:11:22.148
DISTINGUISH THE OLD TO THE NEW  
CMU.                            
THERE&apos;S SOME STRUCTURAL ISSUES  

01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:22.815
CMU.                            
THERE&apos;S SOME STRUCTURAL ISSUES  
TO DEAL WITH BUT WE COULD       

01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:25.684
THERE&apos;S SOME STRUCTURAL ISSUES  
TO DEAL WITH BUT WE COULD       
PROBABLY SOMEHOW OFFSET THE NEW 

01:11:25.686 --> 01:11:29.055
TO DEAL WITH BUT WE COULD       
PROBABLY SOMEHOW OFFSET THE NEW 
WALLS SO THAT THEY ARE OFFSET   

01:11:29.057 --> 01:11:29.922
PROBABLY SOMEHOW OFFSET THE NEW 
WALLS SO THAT THEY ARE OFFSET   
FROM THE OLD TO DISTINGUISH     

01:11:29.924 --> 01:11:33.325
WALLS SO THAT THEY ARE OFFSET   
FROM THE OLD TO DISTINGUISH     
WHERE THE OLD STRUCTURE USED TO 

01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:34.093
FROM THE OLD TO DISTINGUISH     
WHERE THE OLD STRUCTURE USED TO 
BE AND THE NEW STARTED.         

01:11:34.095 --> 01:11:35.094
WHERE THE OLD STRUCTURE USED TO 
BE AND THE NEW STARTED.         
SO THAT&apos;S ONE WAY WE COULD TRY  

01:11:35.096 --> 01:11:36.995
BE AND THE NEW STARTED.         
SO THAT&apos;S ONE WAY WE COULD TRY  
TO PUSH THIS THING DOWN A       

01:11:36.997 --> 01:11:40.566
SO THAT&apos;S ONE WAY WE COULD TRY  
TO PUSH THIS THING DOWN A       
LITTLE BIT IN THE HIDING TRYING 

01:11:40.568 --> 01:11:41.234
TO PUSH THIS THING DOWN A       
LITTLE BIT IN THE HIDING TRYING 
TO HIDE THAT FIRST FLOOR WE&apos;RE  

01:11:41.236 --> 01:11:44.336
LITTLE BIT IN THE HIDING TRYING 
TO HIDE THAT FIRST FLOOR WE&apos;RE  
TRYING TO BATTLE HEITZ TO GET   

01:11:44.338 --> 01:11:45.104
TO HIDE THAT FIRST FLOOR WE&apos;RE  
TRYING TO BATTLE HEITZ TO GET   
ENOUGH RESIDENTIAL UNITS WE     

01:11:45.106 --> 01:11:48.874
TRYING TO BATTLE HEITZ TO GET   
ENOUGH RESIDENTIAL UNITS WE     
JUST CAN&apos;T GET THE OFFICE SPACE 

01:11:48.876 --> 01:11:49.608
ENOUGH RESIDENTIAL UNITS WE     
JUST CAN&apos;T GET THE OFFICE SPACE 
IN AND WE&apos;RE TRYING TO PUSH     

01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:51.944
JUST CAN&apos;T GET THE OFFICE SPACE 
IN AND WE&apos;RE TRYING TO PUSH     
BACK WHAT WE CAN AND I THINK ON 

01:11:51.946 --> 01:11:55.748
IN AND WE&apos;RE TRYING TO PUSH     
BACK WHAT WE CAN AND I THINK ON 
THE LEFT SIDE HERE THERE&apos;S THE  

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:56.182
BACK WHAT WE CAN AND I THINK ON 
THE LEFT SIDE HERE THERE&apos;S THE  
SKYSCRAPERS.                    

01:11:56.184 --> 01:11:59.986
THE LEFT SIDE HERE THERE&apos;S THE  
SKYSCRAPERS.                    
SO YOU SEE YOU SURE YOU GOT THE 

01:11:59.988 --> 01:12:00.786
SKYSCRAPERS.                    
SO YOU SEE YOU SURE YOU GOT THE 
THREE CIRCLES THEN YOU&apos;VE GOT   

01:12:00.788 --> 01:12:03.822
SO YOU SEE YOU SURE YOU GOT THE 
THREE CIRCLES THEN YOU&apos;VE GOT   
THE SKYSCRAPER IN THE END WE&apos;RE 

01:12:03.824 --> 01:12:04.490
THREE CIRCLES THEN YOU&apos;VE GOT   
THE SKYSCRAPER IN THE END WE&apos;RE 
NOT WHERE GOING A COUPLE        

01:12:04.492 --> 01:12:06.391
THE SKYSCRAPER IN THE END WE&apos;RE 
NOT WHERE GOING A COUPLE        
STORIES.                        

01:12:06.393 --> 01:12:07.293
NOT WHERE GOING A COUPLE        
STORIES.                        
I MEAN WE&apos;RE KEEPING THIS WHOLE 

01:12:07.295 --> 01:12:10.963
STORIES.                        
I MEAN WE&apos;RE KEEPING THIS WHOLE 
THING THREE FOOT ABOVE.         

01:12:10.965 --> 01:12:11.698
I MEAN WE&apos;RE KEEPING THIS WHOLE 
THING THREE FOOT ABOVE.         
THEY HAVE TO CHANGE.            

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.664
THING THREE FOOT ABOVE.         
THEY HAVE TO CHANGE.            
THE STRUCTURE HAS TO CHANGE     

01:12:12.666 --> 01:12:14.900
THEY HAVE TO CHANGE.            
THE STRUCTURE HAS TO CHANGE     
THEN TO PROTECT THE VARIABLES   

01:12:14.902 --> 01:12:18.470
THE STRUCTURE HAS TO CHANGE     
THEN TO PROTECT THE VARIABLES   
IN EACH SIDE ALMOST STICK WITH  

01:12:18.472 --> 01:12:19.138
THEN TO PROTECT THE VARIABLES   
IN EACH SIDE ALMOST STICK WITH  
WOODEN STRUCTURE THAT BURN IS   

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.207
IN EACH SIDE ALMOST STICK WITH  
WOODEN STRUCTURE THAT BURN IS   
INTENDED TO BURN DOWN           

01:12:21.209 --> 01:12:22.208
WOODEN STRUCTURE THAT BURN IS   
INTENDED TO BURN DOWN           
EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT IT&apos;S   

01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:25.944
INTENDED TO BURN DOWN           
EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT IT&apos;S   
FURNIVAL&apos;S BUILDINGS TO GO UP.  

01:12:25.946 --> 01:12:26.779
EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT IT&apos;S   
FURNIVAL&apos;S BUILDINGS TO GO UP.  
THEY&apos;RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE 

01:12:26.781 --> 01:12:29.448
FURNIVAL&apos;S BUILDINGS TO GO UP.
