REGIONAL DETENTION BASINS THAT  
COVER THE ENTIRE MALL COMPLEX.  

00:21:08.664 --> 00:21:09.396
REGIONAL DETENTION BASINS THAT  
COVER THE ENTIRE MALL COMPLEX.  
MOST LIKELY THEY&apos;LL NEED        

00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:11.865
COVER THE ENTIRE MALL COMPLEX.  
MOST LIKELY THEY&apos;LL NEED        
OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED SOME SITE

00:21:15.805 --> 00:21:16.503
MODIFICATIONS ON WITHIN A       
DEVELOPMENT AREA.               
&gt;&gt; HOWEVER, THOSE PONDS         

00:21:16.505 --> 00:21:19.840
DEVELOPMENT AREA.               
&gt;&gt; HOWEVER, THOSE PONDS         
PROBABLY HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY   

00:21:19.842 --> 00:21:21.108
&gt;&gt; HOWEVER, THOSE PONDS         
PROBABLY HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY   
MAYBE NEED TO BE CLEANED OUT AT 

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.377
PROBABLY HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY   
MAYBE NEED TO BE CLEANED OUT AT 
MOST.

MAYBE NEED TO BE CLEANED OUT AT 
MOST.                           
SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR           

00:21:24.246 --> 00:21:24.778
MOST.

THERE WAS AN EXTRA RIGHT TURN   

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.345
HERE.                           
THERE WAS AN EXTRA RIGHT TURN   
LANE TRAFFIC TRANSPORTATION     

00:21:58.347 --> 00:21:59.213
THERE WAS AN EXTRA RIGHT TURN   
LANE TRAFFIC TRANSPORTATION     
STUDY CAME BACK AND SAID THAT   

00:21:59.215 --> 00:22:01.948
LANE TRAFFIC TRANSPORTATION     
STUDY CAME BACK AND SAID THAT   
THAT&apos;S NOT NECESSARY SO THAT    

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:02.549
STUDY CAME BACK AND SAID THAT   
THAT&apos;S NOT NECESSARY SO THAT    
THAT WAS REMOVED.               

00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:03.550
THAT&apos;S NOT NECESSARY SO THAT    
THAT WAS REMOVED.               
PART OF THE WHAT CAME THROUGH   

00:22:03.552 --> 00:22:05.952
THAT WAS REMOVED.               
PART OF THE WHAT CAME THROUGH   
THE MULTIMODAL IS THE ADDITION  

00:22:05.954 --> 00:22:06.953
PART OF THE WHAT CAME THROUGH   
THE MULTIMODAL IS THE ADDITION  
OF SOME OF THE BIKE LANES ON    

00:22:06.955 --> 00:22:07.554
THE MULTIMODAL IS THE ADDITION  
OF SOME OF THE BIKE LANES ON    
BRIARWOOD CIRCLE.               

00:22:07.556 --> 00:22:10.724
OF SOME OF THE BIKE LANES ON    
BRIARWOOD CIRCLE.               
UNFORTUNATELY, AS WAS POINTED   

00:22:10.726 --> 00:22:14.627
BRIARWOOD CIRCLE.               
UNFORTUNATELY, AS WAS POINTED   
OUT, SIMON AND AS WELL AS       

00:22:14.629 --> 00:22:15.262
UNFORTUNATELY, AS WAS POINTED   
OUT, SIMON AND AS WELL AS       
THINGS THEY DON&apos;T CONTROL ALL   

00:22:15.264 --> 00:22:15.929
OUT, SIMON AND AS WELL AS       
THINGS THEY DON&apos;T CONTROL ALL   
THE PARCELS IN THERE.           

00:22:15.931 --> 00:22:18.231
THINGS THEY DON&apos;T CONTROL ALL   
THE PARCELS IN THERE.           
SO THE BIKE LANES AT THIS TIME  

00:22:18.233 --> 00:22:18.899
THE PARCELS IN THERE.           
SO THE BIKE LANES AT THIS TIME  
ARE PRETTY LIMITED TO THE       

00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:19.666
SO THE BIKE LANES AT THIS TIME  
ARE PRETTY LIMITED TO THE       
FRONTAGE THAT THAT THEY DO      

00:22:19.668 --> 00:22:22.036
ARE PRETTY LIMITED TO THE       
FRONTAGE THAT THAT THEY DO      
CONTROL.                        

00:22:22.038 --> 00:22:22.903
FRONTAGE THAT THAT THEY DO      
CONTROL.                        
SO BASICALLY BRIARWOOD RIGHT    

00:22:22.905 --> 00:22:23.503
CONTROL.                        
SO BASICALLY BRIARWOOD RIGHT    
NOW HAS FIVE LANES.             

00:22:23.505 --> 00:22:25.905
SO BASICALLY BRIARWOOD RIGHT    
NOW HAS FIVE LANES.             
IT WOULD GO ON THE FOUR WITH A  

00:22:25.907 --> 00:22:26.707
NOW HAS FIVE LANES.             
IT WOULD GO ON THE FOUR WITH A  
BIKE LANE ON THE ONE SIDE       

00:22:26.709 --> 00:22:30.143
IT WOULD GO ON THE FOUR WITH A  
BIKE LANE ON THE ONE SIDE       
SEPARATED I THINK IT&apos;S A COUPLE 

00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:30.811
BIKE LANE ON THE ONE SIDE       
SEPARATED I THINK IT&apos;S A COUPLE 
OF FEET BY SOME STRIPING IN     

00:22:30.813 --> 00:22:33.747
SEPARATED I THINK IT&apos;S A COUPLE 
OF FEET BY SOME STRIPING IN     
THAT AREA SO THAT IS A RESULT   

00:22:33.749 --> 00:22:34.615
OF FEET BY SOME STRIPING IN     
THAT AREA SO THAT IS A RESULT   
OF THE MULTIMODAL TRIP OF STUDY 

00:22:34.617 --> 00:22:37.617
THAT AREA SO THAT IS A RESULT   
OF THE MULTIMODAL TRIP OF STUDY 
AS WELL AS AGAIN SOME OF THE

BUILDING OF UNITS AND THERE&apos;S A 

01:02:43.823 --> 01:02:47.224
THAT WE CAN BE A FULLY ELECTRIC 
BUILDING OF UNITS AND THERE&apos;S A 
ZEBU VARIANCE OF I DON&apos;T KNOW,

TEN YEARS SO ANYWAY JUST TO ADD 

01:04:01.067 --> 01:04:01.899
NOT GOING TO BE INSTALLED IN    
TEN YEARS SO ANYWAY JUST TO ADD 
TO THAT THEY&apos;RE AWARE THAT IT   

01:04:01.901 --> 01:04:04.969
TEN YEARS SO ANYWAY JUST TO ADD 
TO THAT THEY&apos;RE AWARE THAT IT   
IS AN ISSUE BUT I&apos;M NOT SURE    

01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:05.703
TO THAT THEY&apos;RE AWARE THAT IT   
IS AN ISSUE BUT I&apos;M NOT SURE    
OF THE TIMELINE ON THAT.        

01:04:05.705 --> 01:04:06.570
IS AN ISSUE BUT I&apos;M NOT SURE    
OF THE TIMELINE ON THAT.        
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THERE&apos;S DIVERSITY  

01:04:06.572 --> 01:04:07.805
OF THE TIMELINE ON THAT.        
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THERE&apos;S DIVERSITY  
AS WELL.                        

01:04:07.807 --> 01:04:08.072
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THERE&apos;S DIVERSITY  
AS WELL.                        
RIGHT.                          

01:04:08.074 --> 01:04:08.972
AS WELL.                        
RIGHT.                          
SO A CHARGING STATION DOESN&apos;T   

01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:11.608
RIGHT.                          
SO A CHARGING STATION DOESN&apos;T   
MEAN THAT THAT&apos;S AVAILABLE.     

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:12.709
SO A CHARGING STATION DOESN&apos;T   
MEAN THAT THAT&apos;S AVAILABLE.     
LIKE I PLUG IN AND I&apos;M RIGHT.   

01:04:12.711 --> 01:04:13.644
MEAN THAT THAT&apos;S AVAILABLE.     
LIKE I PLUG IN AND I&apos;M RIGHT.   
YOU CAN HEAR WHAT THEIR         

01:04:13.646 --> 01:04:15.880
LIKE I PLUG IN AND I&apos;M RIGHT.   
YOU CAN HEAR WHAT THEIR         
SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING 

01:04:15.882 --> 01:04:16.380
YOU CAN HEAR WHAT THEIR         
SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING 
ALL THE TIME.                   

01:04:16.382 --> 01:04:17.482
SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING 
ALL THE TIME.                   
SO I THINK YOU COULD TAKE THAT  

01:04:17.484 --> 01:04:20.284
ALL THE TIME.                   
SO I THINK YOU COULD TAKE THAT  
90 AND YOU CAN RATIONALIZE A    

01:04:20.286 --> 01:04:23.521
SO I THINK YOU COULD TAKE THAT  
90 AND YOU CAN RATIONALIZE A    
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF DIVERSITY  

01:04:23.523 --> 01:04:24.254
90 AND YOU CAN RATIONALIZE A    
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF DIVERSITY  
ON THAT JUST TO BRING THE       

01:04:24.256 --> 01:04:24.955
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF DIVERSITY  
ON THAT JUST TO BRING THE       
OVERALL LOAD DOWN ON IT.        

01:04:24.957 --> 01:04:27.958
ON THAT JUST TO BRING THE       
OVERALL LOAD DOWN ON IT.        
SO IT DOESN&apos;T HAMSTRING THE     

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.526
OVERALL LOAD DOWN ON IT.        
SO IT DOESN&apos;T HAMSTRING THE     
INITIAL UPFRONT DESIGN.         

01:04:28.528 --> 01:04:31.495
SO IT DOESN&apos;T HAMSTRING THE     
INITIAL UPFRONT DESIGN.         
SO SO MAYBE A TIP WOULD BE      

01:04:31.497 --> 01:04:34.665
INITIAL UPFRONT DESIGN.         
SO SO MAYBE A TIP WOULD BE      
DESIGN YOUR SECONDARY SERVICE   

01:04:34.667 --> 01:04:35.299
SO SO MAYBE A TIP WOULD BE      
DESIGN YOUR SECONDARY SERVICE   
FOR THE PARKING AND YOUR        

01:04:35.301 --> 01:04:35.933

FOR THE PARKING AND YOUR        
PRIMARY SURFACE FOR THE         

01:04:35.935 --> 01:04:36.633
FOR THE PARKING AND YOUR        
PRIMARY SURFACE FOR THE         
RESIDENTIAL AND IF YOU NEED     

01:04:36.635 --> 01:04:42.406
PRIMARY SURFACE FOR THE         
RESIDENTIAL AND IF YOU NEED     
THAT ONE SERVICE ONLY WELL AND  

01:04:42.408 --> 01:04:43.708
RESIDENTIAL AND IF YOU NEED     
THAT ONE SERVICE ONLY WELL AND  
SO YES, SOMEHOW IF IT NEEDS TO  

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:47.145
THAT ONE SERVICE ONLY WELL AND  
SO YES, SOMEHOW IF IT NEEDS TO  
BE GAS POWERED WE SHOULD GAS    

01:04:47.147 --> 01:04:50.648
SO YES, SOMEHOW IF IT NEEDS TO  
BE GAS POWERED WE SHOULD GAS    
POWER THOSE EVVY PANELS SO THAT 

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:51.582
BE GAS POWERED WE SHOULD GAS    
POWER THOSE EVVY PANELS SO THAT 
WHEN YOU CAN UNTAP IT AND PLUG  

01:04:51.584 --> 01:04:55.018
POWER THOSE EVVY PANELS SO THAT 
WHEN YOU CAN UNTAP IT AND PLUG

OF THEIR MONEY OFF OF THE DRIVE 
THRU WINDOWS.

THERE MIGHT BE NUANCES TO THAT. 

01:54:01.998 --> 01:54:02.897
WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES BECAUSE   
THERE MIGHT BE NUANCES TO THAT. 
IT MIGHT BE AN EMPLOYMENT OR    

01:54:02.899 --> 01:54:03.364
THERE MIGHT BE NUANCES TO THAT.

02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:34.254
REALLY WHAT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE 
IS.                             
IT REALLY SAYS SO THE CHARTER

EXCUSED BY A VOTE OF SIX OF THE 
MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.             

02:00:42.365 --> 02:00:45.966
EXCUSED BY A VOTE OF SIX OF THE 
MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.             
SO ALL OF THE ALL OF THE RULES  

02:00:45.968 --> 02:00:49.403
MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.             
SO ALL OF THE ALL OF THE RULES  
REGARDING ETHICS GO BACK TO

SO ALL OF THE ALL OF THE RULES  
REGARDING ETHICS GO BACK TO     
THAT.

REGARDING ETHICS GO BACK TO     
THAT.                           
AND SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A         

02:00:50.406 --> 02:00:50.938
THAT.                           
AND SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A         
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE.

AND SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A         
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE.         
BUT THE THING I WANTED TO TO    

02:00:52.742 --> 02:00:53.607
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE.         
BUT THE THING I WANTED TO TO    
KIND OF POINT OUT IS THAT THE   

02:00:53.609 --> 02:00:56.277
BUT THE THING I WANTED TO TO    
KIND OF POINT OUT IS THAT THE   
UNDERLYING POLICIES OF CONFLICT 

02:00:56.279 --> 02:00:56.978
KIND OF POINT OUT IS THAT THE   
UNDERLYING POLICIES OF CONFLICT 
OF INTEREST ARE STILL THE SAME. 

02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:01.182
UNDERLYING POLICIES OF CONFLICT 
OF INTEREST ARE STILL THE SAME. 
AND THE INTERESTING THING IS I  

02:01:01.184 --> 02:01:02.049
OF INTEREST ARE STILL THE SAME. 
AND THE INTERESTING THING IS I  
DON&apos;T KNOW IN TWENTY YEARS I&apos;M  

02:01:02.051 --> 02:01:02.983
AND THE INTERESTING THING IS I  
DON&apos;T KNOW IN TWENTY YEARS I&apos;M  
NOT AWARE OF ANY TIME WHEN A

IT&apos;S A LITTLE BIT OF A I DON&apos;T  
WANT TO CALL IT A I WON&apos;T CALL  

02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:20.201
IT&apos;S A LITTLE BIT OF A I DON&apos;T  
WANT TO CALL IT A I WON&apos;T CALL  
IT A RUBBER STAMP.

WANT TO CALL IT A I WON&apos;T CALL  
IT A RUBBER STAMP.              
THEY HAVE THE DECISION TO

IT A RUBBER STAMP.              
THEY HAVE THE DECISION TO       
DECIDE BUT EVEN AT THEIR BODY I 

02:01:24.474 --> 02:01:27.641
THEY HAVE THE DECISION TO       
DECIDE BUT EVEN AT THEIR BODY I 
THINK THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO     

02:01:27.643 --> 02:01:28.375
DECIDE BUT EVEN AT THEIR BODY I 
THINK THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO     
PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE   

02:01:28.377 --> 02:01:29.043
THINK THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO     
PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE   
BODY AND IF SOMEBODY BELIEVES   

02:01:29.045 --> 02:01:31.379
PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE   
BODY AND IF SOMEBODY BELIEVES   
THAT THEY HAVE A CONFLICT, THEY 

02:01:31.381 --> 02:01:35.048
BODY AND IF SOMEBODY BELIEVES   
THAT THEY HAVE A CONFLICT, THEY 
STEP AWAY.                      

02:01:35.050 --> 02:01:36.183
THAT THEY HAVE A CONFLICT, THEY 
STEP AWAY.                      
BUT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT   

02:01:36.185 --> 02:01:39.186
STEP AWAY.                      
BUT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT   
THAT THE OTHER QUESTION THAT

BUT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT   
THAT THE OTHER QUESTION THAT    
CAME UP THAT I JUST WANTED TO

ONE OF THE UNDERLYING THINGS    
THAT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS

THERE&apos;S TWO PARTS OF THIS THAT  
ARE VERY INDIVIDUAL AND I THINK 
PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET CONFUSED   

02:02:38.815 --> 02:02:39.480
ARE VERY INDIVIDUAL AND I THINK 
PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET CONFUSED   
THINKING ABOUT THAT THE         

02:02:39.482 --> 02:02:42.617
PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET CONFUSED   
THINKING ABOUT THAT THE         
CONFLICT IS ABOUT WHETHER OR    

02:02:42.619 --> 02:02:43.350
THINKING ABOUT THAT THE         
CONFLICT IS ABOUT WHETHER OR    
NOT THE PERSON CAN MAKE AN      

02:02:43.352 --> 02:02:45.586
CONFLICT IS ABOUT WHETHER OR    
NOT THE PERSON CAN MAKE AN

OBJECTIVE VOTE AND IT&apos;S NEVER   
ABOUT THAT AT ALL.              
WE&apos;VE HAD MANY PEOPLE OVER THE

ABOUT THAT AT ALL.              
WE&apos;VE HAD MANY PEOPLE OVER THE  
YEARS WHO CALL AND SAY WELL, I

IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WITH
