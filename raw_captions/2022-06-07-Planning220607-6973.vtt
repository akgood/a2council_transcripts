00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:07.597
GREW BY ABOUT 200 SQUARE FEET   
AND IT GREW TOWARDS THE SOUTH   
PROPERTY PREVIOUSLY AS I KIND   

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:11.534
AND IT GREW TOWARDS THE SOUTH   
PROPERTY PREVIOUSLY AS I KIND   
OF NOTED THAT WHERE WE HAD THAT

PROPERTY PREVIOUSLY AS I KIND   
OF NOTED THAT WHERE WE HAD THAT 
RECESS IN THE MIDDLE IT WENT    

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:15.238
OF NOTED THAT WHERE WE HAD THAT

SMALL BUMP AND SO IT KIND       
OF CAME ABOUT SIX FEET CLOSER   

00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:19.942
SMALL BUMP AND SO IT KIND       
OF CAME ABOUT SIX FEET CLOSER   
BY ALIGNING ITSELF WITH THE

OF CAME ABOUT SIX FEET CLOSER   
BY ALIGNING ITSELF WITH THE     
WITH THE LOWER LEVEL BUILDING   

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:26.148
BY ALIGNING ITSELF WITH THE     
WITH THE LOWER LEVEL BUILDING   
DEFINED IT DEFINES THE PARKING  

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.950
WITH THE LOWER LEVEL BUILDING   
DEFINED IT DEFINES THE PARKING  
I BELIEVE THAT&apos;S WHAT THEY&apos;RE   

00:41:26.952 --> 00:41:27.683
DEFINED IT DEFINES THE PARKING  
I BELIEVE THAT&apos;S WHAT THEY&apos;RE   
REFERENCING BECAUSE FORMALLY    

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:30.687
I BELIEVE THAT&apos;S WHAT THEY&apos;RE   
REFERENCING BECAUSE FORMALLY    
THAT WAS OUT THERE AND THE      

00:41:30.689 --> 00:41:31.620
REFERENCING BECAUSE FORMALLY    
THAT WAS OUT THERE AND THE      
WHERE THE THE POINT AT WHICH WE 

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:34.724
THAT WAS OUT THERE AND THE      
WHERE THE THE POINT AT WHICH WE 
MET THE S PROPERTY LINE FROM    

00:41:34.726 --> 00:41:35.458
WHERE THE THE POINT AT WHICH WE 
MET THE S PROPERTY LINE FROM    
WHAT WE COULD TELL FROM THE     

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.861
MET THE S PROPERTY LINE FROM    
WHAT WE COULD TELL FROM THE     
GARDEN PLANS WAS GOING TO ALIGN 

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:39.596
WHAT WE COULD TELL FROM THE     
GARDEN PLANS WAS GOING TO ALIGN 
MOSTLY WITH THEIR ELEVATOR CORE 

00:41:39.598 --> 00:41:42.198
GARDEN PLANS WAS GOING TO ALIGN 
MOSTLY WITH THEIR ELEVATOR CORE 
AND STAIR OR THEIR STAIR FOR    

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:42.998
MOSTLY WITH THEIR ELEVATOR CORE 
AND STAIR OR THEIR STAIR FOR    
THAT ALSO ABOVE THE PROPERTY    

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.272
AND STAIR OR THEIR STAIR FOR    
THAT ALSO ABOVE THE PROPERTY    
LINE ON THAT SIDE.              

00:41:49.274 --> 00:41:50.272
THAT ALSO ABOVE THE PROPERTY    
LINE ON THAT SIDE.              
&gt;&gt; SO THE PUDI THAT WE&apos;RE       

00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:53.542
LINE ON THAT SIDE.              
&gt;&gt; SO THE PUDI THAT WE&apos;RE       
TALKING ABOUT WOULD MAKE IT     

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:54.243
&gt;&gt; SO THE PUDI THAT WE&apos;RE       
TALKING ABOUT WOULD MAKE IT     
CLOSER BASICALLY BY ELIMINATING

THERE HAVE A BALCONY IN THE     
BEDROOM UNITS ON THE FIRST I    
THINK AND SECOND FLOOR THAT ARE 

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:10.439
BEDROOM UNITS ON THE FIRST I    
THINK AND SECOND FLOOR THAT ARE 
BASICALLY GOING TO HAVE, YOU    

00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:11.206
THINK AND SECOND FLOOR THAT ARE 
BASICALLY GOING TO HAVE, YOU    
KNOW, JUST A COMPLETE WALL      

00:55:11.208 --> 00:55:14.175
BASICALLY GOING TO HAVE, YOU

FOR THE CITY BUT IT IS NOT      
ACCURATE TO CALL IT WITH NO     

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:25.387
FOR THE CITY BUT IT IS NOT      
ACCURATE TO CALL IT WITH NO     
DETRIMENTAL IMPACT TO THE

ADJACENT PROPERTY OR            
NEIGHBORING OWNERS.             
SO SO I DO WANT TO EARLIER I    

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:34.163
NEIGHBORING OWNERS.             
SO SO I DO WANT TO EARLIER I

SO SO I DO WANT TO EARLIER I    
SAID I THINK IT&apos;S A BY PRODUCT

I THINK THAT THAT THE THE       
PERSON WE HAD THE SECTIONAL     

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:49.711
I THINK THAT THAT THE THE

CAN SHARE MY SHARE MY SCREEN    
AGAIN THAT MIGHT BE THE EASIEST 
.                               

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:20.275
AGAIN THAT MIGHT BE THE EASIEST

&gt;&gt; IS THAT OK TO DO?            

00:56:20.277 --> 00:56:20.742
.                               
&gt;&gt; IS THAT OK TO DO?            
YEAH ABSOLUTELY.                

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:23.812
&gt;&gt; IS THAT OK TO DO?            
YEAH ABSOLUTELY.                
GO FOR IT OK, JUST GET BACK TO  

00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:29.752
YEAH ABSOLUTELY.                
GO FOR IT OK, JUST GET BACK TO  
PAGE                            

00:56:29.819 --> 00:56:36.658
     BACK TO THE FLOOR PLAN     

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:39.194
                            SO  
WE DON&apos;T HAVE TO GET TO THE     
SAME POINT THAT MIGHT SURE      

00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:47.769
WE DON&apos;T HAVE TO GET TO THE     
SAME POINT THAT MIGHT SURE      
BETTER SO THIS GREEN LIGHT IS A 

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:48.503
SAME POINT THAT MIGHT SURE      
BETTER SO THIS GREEN LIGHT IS A 
SLIGHT ERROR SHOULD BE OVER AT  

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:54.209
BETTER SO THIS GREEN LIGHT IS A 
SLIGHT ERROR SHOULD BE OVER AT  
THIS CARMELINA IN OUR STUDY     

00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:55.177
SLIGHT ERROR SHOULD BE OVER AT  
THIS CARMELINA IN OUR STUDY     
THERE WE DID HAVE FULL PLANS    

00:56:55.179 --> 00:56:58.580
THIS CARMELINA IN OUR STUDY     
THERE WE DID HAVE FULL PLANS    
OF THE GARNETTE WE JUST DO YOU  

00:56:58.582 --> 00:56:59.114
THERE WE DID HAVE FULL PLANS    
OF THE GARNETTE WE JUST DO YOU  
KNOW WE GATHERED THEIR          

00:56:59.116 --> 00:56:59.581
OF THE GARNETTE WE JUST DO YOU  
KNOW WE GATHERED THEIR          
FOOTPRINT.                      

00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:02.418
KNOW WE GATHERED THEIR          
FOOTPRINT.                      
I THINK THE THERE&apos;S A BEDROOM   

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.251
FOOTPRINT.                      
I THINK THE THERE&apos;S A BEDROOM   
LOCATED HERE WITH A BALCONY SO  

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:06.255
I THINK THE THERE&apos;S A BEDROOM   
LOCATED HERE WITH A BALCONY SO  
THAT HAPPENS AT THIS RECESS.    

00:57:06.257 --> 00:57:07.189
LOCATED HERE WITH A BALCONY SO  
THAT HAPPENS AT THIS RECESS.    
SO I THINK THEY&apos;RE ABOUT FIVE   

00:57:07.191 --> 00:57:08.089
THAT HAPPENS AT THIS RECESS.    
SO I THINK THEY&apos;RE ABOUT FIVE   
FEET SET BACK FROM THE PROPERTY 

00:57:08.091 --> 00:57:09.991
SO I THINK THEY&apos;RE ABOUT FIVE   
FEET SET BACK FROM THE PROPERTY 
LINE CURRENTLY WE WILL BE       

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:13.328
FEET SET BACK FROM THE PROPERTY 
LINE CURRENTLY WE WILL BE       
ROUGHLY EIGHT FEET BACK.        

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:14.196
LINE CURRENTLY WE WILL BE       
ROUGHLY EIGHT FEET BACK.        
SO THERE&apos;S ABOUT 13 FEET        

00:57:14.198 --> 00:57:17.198
ROUGHLY EIGHT FEET BACK.        
SO THERE&apos;S ABOUT 13 FEET        
BETWEEN WHERE THAT FIRST        

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.200
SO THERE&apos;S ABOUT 13 FEET        
BETWEEN WHERE THAT FIRST        
OPENING WILL BE AND WHERE THIS  

00:57:18.202 --> 00:57:18.666
BETWEEN WHERE THAT FIRST        
OPENING WILL BE AND WHERE THIS  
RECESS OCCURS.                  

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:22.036
OPENING WILL BE AND WHERE THIS  
RECESS OCCURS.                  
I BELIEVE THERE&apos;S SOME OVERLAP  

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:25.373
RECESS OCCURS.                  
I BELIEVE THERE&apos;S SOME OVERLAP  
IN THE SECOND BALCONY IN THIS   

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:26.441
I BELIEVE THERE&apos;S SOME OVERLAP  
IN THE SECOND BALCONY IN THIS   
ZONE THAT WILL NOT BE AT THAT   

00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:28.977
IN THE SECOND BALCONY IN THIS   
ZONE THAT WILL NOT BE AT THAT   
13 FOOT DISTANCE AND THEN THEY  

00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:32.347
ZONE THAT WILL NOT BE AT THAT   
13 FOOT DISTANCE AND THEN THEY

I THINK I UNDERSTAND.           
CAN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY MY   

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:00.081
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.           
CAN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY MY   
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS      

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:00.814
CAN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY MY   
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS      
WOULD BE CONVERSION OF THAT     

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.383
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS

SPACE.                          

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:04.552
WOULD BE CONVERSION OF THAT     
SPACE.                          
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD NOT BE ADDING AN    

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:07.622
SPACE.                          
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD NOT BE ADDING AN    
EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF FLOOR.     

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:08.556
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD NOT BE ADDING AN    
EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF FLOOR.     
SO THE ONLY ADDING IS THREE     

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:11.458
EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF FLOOR.     
SO THE ONLY ADDING IS THREE     
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET.           

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.326
SO THE ONLY ADDING IS THREE

01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:34.615
TALKING ABOUT NOT WANTING TO DO

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:41.889
SQUARE FEET ALLOW FOR A FULL    
BASEMENT IF THAT WAS SOMETHING  
THAT WAS DECIDED IT&apos;S NOT HIGH  

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:42.189
BASEMENT IF THAT WAS SOMETHING  
THAT WAS DECIDED IT&apos;S NOT HIGH  
ENOUGH.                         

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:45.893
THAT WAS DECIDED IT&apos;S NOT HIGH  
ENOUGH.                         
I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT THE I DON&apos;T   

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:46.827
ENOUGH.                         
I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT THE I DON&apos;T   
THINK BUT I&apos;LL LET MR. NEVILLE

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:54.235
SAY THE FIRST I THINK THE FIRST

HUNDRED SQUARE FEET MIGHT BE A  

01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:54.769
FLOOR IS ROUGHLY FIFTY NINE     
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET MIGHT BE A  
LITTLE OFF ON THAT.             

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:58.505
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET MIGHT BE A  
LITTLE OFF ON THAT.             
&gt;&gt; SO NO, I DON&apos;T THINK THAT WE 

01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.273
LITTLE OFF ON THAT.             
&gt;&gt; SO NO, I DON&apos;T THINK THAT WE 
COULD DO A FULL THREE THOUSAND  

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:01.675
&gt;&gt; SO NO, I DON&apos;T THINK THAT WE 
COULD DO A FULL THREE THOUSAND  
SQUARE FEET.                    

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:02.509
COULD DO A FULL THREE THOUSAND  
SQUARE FEET.                    
WE COULD JUST MATCH THE         

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:03.210

WE COULD JUST MATCH THE

BUILDING FOOTPRINT WOULDN&apos;T WE  
GO DOWN?                        
I THINK THAT WOULD EXCEED THE   

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:06.681
GO DOWN?                        
I THINK THAT WOULD EXCEED THE   
THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET THAT 

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:08.516
I THINK THAT WOULD EXCEED THE   
THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET THAT 
WE CAN SERVE WITH A SINGLE

BE DONE.                        
IT&apos;S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETIMES  
THE STANDARD IS YOU HAVE TO

IT&apos;S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETIMES  
THE STANDARD IS YOU HAVE TO     
PROVE THAT THERE IS AN          

01:32:13.862 --> 01:32:14.660
THE STANDARD IS YOU HAVE TO

AND YOU DIDN&apos;T RENT IT.         

01:32:22.236 --> 01:32:23.169

AND YOU DIDN&apos;T RENT IT.         
THAT&apos;S DIFFERENT THAN YOU
