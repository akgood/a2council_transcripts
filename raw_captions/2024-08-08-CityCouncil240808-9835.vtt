01:12:25.706 --> 01:12:26.572
WE WERE FOR THAT THE FIFTY      
EIGHT WATT FIXTURE TURNED DOWN  
TO THE LOWER SETTING OF FORTY   

01:12:26.574 --> 01:12:30.008
EIGHT WATT FIXTURE TURNED DOWN  
TO THE LOWER SETTING OF FORTY   
EIGHT WATT AT THE TWENTY SEVEN  

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:30.443
TO THE LOWER SETTING OF FORTY   
EIGHT WATT AT THE TWENTY SEVEN  
HUNDRED KELVIN COLOR            

01:12:30.445 --> 01:12:33.212
EIGHT WATT AT THE TWENTY SEVEN  
HUNDRED KELVIN COLOR            
TEMPERATURE THE LUMINAIRES      

01:12:33.214 --> 01:12:34.247
HUNDRED KELVIN COLOR            
TEMPERATURE THE LUMINAIRES      
VALUE OF THAT WOULD BE AROUND   

01:12:34.249 --> 01:12:37.883
TEMPERATURE THE LUMINAIRES      
VALUE OF THAT WOULD BE AROUND   
6000 WHICH IS A TWENTY PERCENT  

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:38.484
VALUE OF THAT WOULD BE AROUND   
6000 WHICH IS A TWENTY PERCENT  
DECREASE FROM THE EXISTING      

01:12:38.486 --> 01:12:41.053
6000 WHICH IS A TWENTY PERCENT  
DECREASE FROM THE EXISTING      
LUMINAIRES AND BASED ON LIKE    

01:12:41.055 --> 01:12:41.753
DECREASE FROM THE EXISTING      
LUMINAIRES AND BASED ON LIKE    
ONE HUNDRED WEIGHTLIFT          

01:12:41.755 --> 01:12:44.823
LUMINAIRES AND BASED ON LIKE    
ONE HUNDRED WEIGHTLIFT          
CURRENTLY OUT THERE WITH THE    

01:12:44.825 --> 01:12:45.557
ONE HUNDRED WEIGHTLIFT          
CURRENTLY OUT THERE WITH THE    
SHIELDING WITH THE ADDITIONAL   

01:12:45.559 --> 01:12:46.292
CURRENTLY OUT THERE WITH THE    
SHIELDING WITH THE ADDITIONAL   
SHIELDING THAT WOULD DROP DOWN  

01:12:46.294 --> 01:12:48.427
SHIELDING WITH THE ADDITIONAL   
SHIELDING THAT WOULD DROP DOWN  
TO AROUND FORTY NINE WATTS      

01:12:48.429 --> 01:12:49.429
SHIELDING THAT WOULD DROP DOWN  
TO AROUND FORTY NINE WATTS      
WHICH WOULD BE A TOTAL OF LIKE  

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:50.296
TO AROUND FORTY NINE WATTS      
WHICH WOULD BE A TOTAL OF LIKE  
A THIRTY FOUR PERCENT DECREASE. 

01:12:50.298 --> 01:12:56.235
WHICH WOULD BE A TOTAL OF LIKE  
A THIRTY FOUR PERCENT DECREASE. 
SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW A NOT   

01:12:56.237 --> 01:12:57.035
A THIRTY FOUR PERCENT DECREASE. 
SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW A NOT   
INSIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE   

01:12:57.037 --> 01:13:00.305
SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW A NOT   
INSIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE   
AMOUNT OF OVERALL LIGHT BUT     

01:13:00.307 --> 01:13:01.040
INSIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE   
AMOUNT OF OVERALL LIGHT BUT     
CERTAINLY NOT AS DRASTIC AS     

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:01.774
AMOUNT OF OVERALL LIGHT BUT     
CERTAINLY NOT AS DRASTIC AS     
LIKE A SEVENTY TWO PERCENT      

01:13:01.776 --> 01:13:03.709
CERTAINLY NOT AS DRASTIC AS     
LIKE A SEVENTY TWO PERCENT      
REDUCTION WHICH IS WHAT WE SAW  

01:13:03.711 --> 01:13:04.710
LIKE A SEVENTY TWO PERCENT      
REDUCTION WHICH IS WHAT WE SAW  
WITH THE TWENTY NINE WHAT WAS   

01:13:04.712 --> 01:13:11.584
REDUCTION WHICH IS WHAT WE SAW  
WITH THE TWENTY NINE WHAT WAS   
SHIELDING YOUR SECOND OR        

01:13:11.586 --> 01:13:17.957
WITH THE TWENTY NINE WHAT WAS   
SHIELDING YOUR SECOND OR

ALTERNATIVE TO HELP CONTROL THE 
LIGHT BUT I COULD SEE IT AS     
KIND OF LIKE A SITUATION WHERE  

01:21:56.043 --> 01:21:56.608
LIGHT BUT I COULD SEE IT AS     
KIND OF LIKE A SITUATION WHERE  
WE'RE CREATING DUELING          

01:21:56.610 --> 01:21:59.344
KIND OF LIKE A SITUATION WHERE  
WE'RE CREATING DUELING          
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE REFLECTING    

01:21:59.346 --> 01:22:00.578
WE'RE CREATING DUELING          
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE REFLECTING    
BACK AND FORTH AT EACH OTHER SO 

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:03.415
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE REFLECTING    
BACK AND FORTH AT EACH OTHER SO 
SO WHAT WHAT IS THE SOLUTION    

01:22:03.417 --> 01:22:03.615
BACK AND FORTH AT EACH OTHER SO 
SO WHAT WHAT IS THE SOLUTION    
THERE?                          

01:22:03.617 --> 01:22:06.752
SO WHAT WHAT IS THE SOLUTION    
THERE?                          
IS IT IS IT POTENTIALLY THAT IT 

01:22:06.754 --> 01:22:07.619
THERE?                          
IS IT IS IT POTENTIALLY THAT IT 
JUST WASN'T PROPERLY APPLIED IN 

01:22:07.621 --> 01:22:08.086
IS IT IS IT POTENTIALLY THAT IT 
JUST WASN'T PROPERLY APPLIED IN 
THOSE SITUATIONS?               

01:22:08.088 --> 01:22:13.825
JUST WASN'T PROPERLY APPLIED IN 
THOSE SITUATIONS?               
>> YEAH, I CAN TAKE AN EFFORT   

01:22:13.827 --> 01:22:14.593
THOSE SITUATIONS?               
>> YEAH, I CAN TAKE AN EFFORT   
AT RESPONDING TO THAT MAYBE     

01:22:14.595 --> 01:22:17.362
>> YEAH, I CAN TAKE AN EFFORT   
AT RESPONDING TO THAT MAYBE     
WITHOUT TOO MUCH TECHNICALITY   

01:22:17.364 --> 01:22:18.363
AT RESPONDING TO THAT MAYBE     
WITHOUT TOO MUCH TECHNICALITY   
WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE IN OUR    

01:22:18.365 --> 01:22:20.466
WITHOUT TOO MUCH TECHNICALITY   
WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE IN OUR    
DISCUSSIONS WITH DETI AND       

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:21.366
WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE IN OUR    
DISCUSSIONS WITH DETI AND       
UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT THE    

01:22:21.368 --> 01:22:21.967
DISCUSSIONS WITH DETI AND       
UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT THE    
SPECIFIC MANUFACTURER'S OPTIONS 

01:22:21.969 --> 01:22:25.204
UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT THE    
SPECIFIC MANUFACTURER'S OPTIONS 
FOR SHIELDING FOR THE FIXTURES  

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:25.771
SPECIFIC MANUFACTURER'S OPTIONS 
FOR SHIELDING FOR THE FIXTURES  
THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT.     

01:22:25.773 --> 01:22:28.807
FOR SHIELDING FOR THE FIXTURES  
THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT.     
THEY ARE THESE SNAPPIN SHIELDS  

01:22:28.809 --> 01:22:29.575
THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT.     
THEY ARE THESE SNAPPIN SHIELDS  
WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THAN SORT   

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:30.408
THEY ARE THESE SNAPPIN SHIELDS  
WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THAN SORT   
OF THE OLD STYLE LIKE METAL     

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:33.445
WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THAN SORT   
OF THE OLD STYLE LIKE METAL     
PLATE THAT MIGHT BE WRAPPED     

01:22:33.447 --> 01:22:36.648
OF THE OLD STYLE LIKE METAL     
PLATE THAT MIGHT BE WRAPPED     
AROUND IN LIGHT.                

01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:40.552
PLATE THAT MIGHT BE WRAPPED     
AROUND IN LIGHT.                
SO IT SORT OF REALLY LIKE       

01:22:40.554 --> 01:22:41.453
AROUND IN LIGHT.                
SO IT SORT OF REALLY LIKE       
ALMOST FLUSH WITH THE PICTURE   

01:22:41.455 --> 01:22:44.890
SO IT SORT OF REALLY LIKE       
ALMOST FLUSH WITH THE PICTURE   
ITSELF AND MOST OF THE          

01:22:44.892 --> 01:22:48.159
ALMOST FLUSH WITH THE PICTURE   
ITSELF AND MOST OF THE          
COMPLAINTS THAT THE CITY HAS    

01:22:48.161 --> 01:22:48.794
ITSELF AND MOST OF THE          
COMPLAINTS THAT THE CITY HAS    
RECEIVED AROUND STREETLIGHTS    

01:22:48.796 --> 01:22:52.397
COMPLAINTS THAT THE CITY HAS    
RECEIVED AROUND STREETLIGHTS    
AND BASED ON WHAT WE UNDERSTAND 

01:22:52.399 --> 01:22:53.165

AND BASED ON WHAT WE UNDERSTAND 
FROM DUTY AS WELL, MOST OF THE

COMPLAINTS THAT THEY RECEIVED   

01:22:53.967 --> 01:22:56.067
FROM DUTY AS WELL, MOST OF THE  
COMPLAINTS THAT THEY RECEIVED   
IS ABOUT BACKLIGHTING BEHIND    

01:22:56.069 --> 01:22:57.168
COMPLAINTS THAT THEY RECEIVED   
IS ABOUT BACKLIGHTING BEHIND    
THE HYAM THE LIGHT SORT OF ON   

01:22:57.170 --> 01:23:00.372
IS ABOUT BACKLIGHTING BEHIND    
THE HYAM THE LIGHT SORT OF ON   
THE HOUSE SIDE BECAUSE THAT IS  

01:23:00.374 --> 01:23:03.675
THE HYAM THE LIGHT SORT OF ON   
THE HOUSE SIDE BECAUSE THAT IS  
WHERE THE LIGHT TRESPASS IS     

01:23:03.677 --> 01:23:04.442
THE HOUSE SIDE BECAUSE THAT IS  
WHERE THE LIGHT TRESPASS IS     
MOST LIKELY TO GO.              

01:23:04.444 --> 01:23:05.411
WHERE THE LIGHT TRESPASS IS     
MOST LIKELY TO GO.              
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE THAT'S WHY  

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:07.612
MOST LIKELY TO GO.              
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE THAT'S WHY  
WE CAME TO THE AGREEMENT WITH   

01:23:07.614 --> 01:23:08.447
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE THAT'S WHY  
WE CAME TO THE AGREEMENT WITH   
DUTY TO INSTALL THE HOUSE SIDE

SHIELDS NO MATTER WHAT.         
AS PART OF THIS THERE ARE       
INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE THERE 

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:19.024
AS PART OF THIS THERE ARE       
INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE THERE 
IS SOME LIKE TRESPASS DEPENDING 

01:23:19.026 --> 01:23:19.991
INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE THERE 
IS SOME LIKE TRESPASS DEPENDING 
ON THE WIDTH OF THE ROAD AND    

01:23:19.993 --> 01:23:20.392
IS SOME LIKE TRESPASS DEPENDING 
ON THE WIDTH OF THE ROAD AND    
DIFFERENT SORT                  

01:23:20.394 --> 01:23:22.594
ON THE WIDTH OF THE ROAD AND    
DIFFERENT SORT                  
OF CONFIGURATIONS IN THE FIELD  

01:23:22.596 --> 01:23:23.595

OF CONFIGURATIONS IN THE FIELD  
WHERE THERE MIGHT BE LESS       
TRESPASS FROM THE FRONT AS WELL 

01:23:26.766 --> 01:23:26.965
WHERE THERE MIGHT BE LESS       
TRESPASS FROM THE FRONT AS WELL

01:23:26.967 --> 01:23:27.966
TRESPASS FROM THE FRONT AS WELL 
.                               
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS  

01:23:27.968 --> 01:23:31.503
.                               
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS  
THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHEN   

01:23:31.505 --> 01:23:31.837
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS  
THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHEN   
WE DO THAT.                     

01:23:31.839 --> 01:23:34.839
THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHEN   
WE DO THAT.                     
THEY DO HAVE FRONT SHIELDS AS A 

01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:38.310
WE DO THAT.                     
THEY DO HAVE FRONT SHIELDS AS A 
SEPARATE OPTION BUT THAT DOES   

01:23:38.312 --> 01:23:39.043
THEY DO HAVE FRONT SHIELDS AS A 
SEPARATE OPTION BUT THAT DOES   
SORT OF LIMIT DEPENDING ON THE  

01:23:39.045 --> 01:23:42.280
SEPARATE OPTION BUT THAT DOES   
SORT OF LIMIT DEPENDING ON THE  
SIZE OF THE ROAD, THE ROADWAY   

01:23:42.282 --> 01:23:43.148
SORT OF LIMIT DEPENDING ON THE  
SIZE OF THE ROAD, THE ROADWAY   
OR THE RIGHT OF WAY THERE COULD 

01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:46.318
SIZE OF THE ROAD, THE ROADWAY   
OR THE RIGHT OF WAY THERE COULD 
ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT 

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:46.718
OR THE RIGHT OF WAY THERE COULD 
ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT 
ON THE ROAD.                    

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.054
ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT 
ON THE ROAD.                    
AND SO HE HAS INDICATED THAT IF 

01:23:50.056 --> 01:23:50.989
ON THE ROAD.                    
AND SO HE HAS INDICATED THAT IF 
THAT WAS A REQUEST THAT CAME
