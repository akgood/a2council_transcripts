OF STRUCTURE PREVIOUSLY WE DID  
AFTER SUBSTANTIAL DISCUSSION    
THAT THAT&apos;S WHAT WE CAME TO A   

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:41.395
AFTER SUBSTANTIAL DISCUSSION    
THAT THAT&apos;S WHAT WE CAME TO A   
UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT THIS   

00:08:41.397 --> 00:08:44.931
THAT THAT&apos;S WHAT WE CAME TO A   
UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT THIS   
WAS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO       

00:08:44.933 --> 00:08:45.599
UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT THIS   
WAS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO       
PROCEED WHEN I REMEMBER JUST    

00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:48.936
WAS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO       
PROCEED WHEN I REMEMBER JUST    
BEING TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT I    

00:08:48.938 --> 00:08:49.603
PROCEED WHEN I REMEMBER JUST    
BEING TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT I    
AGREE WITH YOU AS TO THE        

00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:52.906
BEING TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT I    
AGREE WITH YOU AS TO THE        
DETAILS FOR THE REST OF IT AND  

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:53.708
AGREE WITH YOU AS TO THE        
DETAILS FOR THE REST OF IT AND  
WHAT WE FOUND A COUPLE          

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.812
DETAILS FOR THE REST OF IT AND  
WHAT WE FOUND A COUPLE          
OF SECONDS AGO WAS THAT IF WE   

00:08:58.814 --> 00:08:59.580
WHAT WE FOUND A COUPLE          
OF SECONDS AGO WAS THAT IF WE   
WENT WITH JUST A PERCENTAGE     

00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:03.016
OF SECONDS AGO WAS THAT IF WE   
WENT WITH JUST A PERCENTAGE     
BASIS ALONE THAT THAT THE       

00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:06.386
WENT WITH JUST A PERCENTAGE     
BASIS ALONE THAT THAT THE       
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COUNCIL  

00:09:06.388 --> 00:09:07.154
BASIS ALONE THAT THAT THE       
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COUNCIL  
MEMBERS SALARY AND THE MAYOR&apos;S  

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:10.424
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COUNCIL  
MEMBERS SALARY AND THE MAYOR&apos;S  
SALARY JUST BY THE ACCIDENT     

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:11.192
MEMBERS SALARY AND THE MAYOR&apos;S  
SALARY JUST BY THE ACCIDENT     
OF USING PERCENTAGE ACTUALLY    

00:09:11.194 --> 00:09:11.725
SALARY JUST BY THE ACCIDENT     
OF USING PERCENTAGE ACTUALLY    
WIDENED THE DIVIDE.             

00:09:11.727 --> 00:09:15.329
OF USING PERCENTAGE ACTUALLY    
WIDENED THE DIVIDE.             
SO THEN WE TOOK A CLOSER LOOK   

00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:16.229
WIDENED THE DIVIDE.             
SO THEN WE TOOK A CLOSER LOOK   
AT HOW WE FELT THAT THE CITY    

00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:18.465
SO THEN WE TOOK A CLOSER LOOK   
AT HOW WE FELT THAT THE CITY    
COUNCIL MEMBERS DESERVE TO NOT  

00:09:18.467 --> 00:09:22.335
AT HOW WE FELT THAT THE CITY    
COUNCIL MEMBERS DESERVE TO NOT  
NECESSARILY LEAVE AND I DON&apos;T   

00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:23.037
COUNCIL MEMBERS DESERVE TO NOT  
NECESSARILY LEAVE AND I DON&apos;T   
THINK WE WOULD HAVE THE FUNDS   

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:26.039
NECESSARILY LEAVE AND I DON&apos;T   
THINK WE WOULD HAVE THE FUNDS   
TO JUSTIFY THAT THAT THEY       

00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:26.707
THINK WE WOULD HAVE THE FUNDS   
TO JUSTIFY THAT THAT THEY       
NEEDED TO NOT THEY NOT ONLY     

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:29.643
TO JUSTIFY THAT THAT THEY       
NEEDED TO NOT THEY NOT ONLY     
NEEDED TO NOT FALL BEHIND       

00:09:29.645 --> 00:09:30.477
NEEDED TO NOT THEY NOT ONLY     
NEEDED TO NOT FALL BEHIND       
BECAUSE THEY WERE ROUGHLY ABOUT 

00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:31.211
NEEDED TO NOT FALL BEHIND       
BECAUSE THEY WERE ROUGHLY ABOUT 
A THIRD OF WHAT THE MAYOR&apos;S     

00:09:31.213 --> 00:09:34.448
BECAUSE THEY WERE ROUGHLY ABOUT 
A THIRD OF WHAT THE MAYOR&apos;S     
SALARY THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE   

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:34.748
A THIRD OF WHAT THE MAYOR&apos;S     
SALARY THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE   
BROUGHT.                        

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.684
SALARY THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE   
BROUGHT.                        
I THINK OUR RESOLUTION TWO      

00:09:37.686 --> 00:09:38.619
BROUGHT.                        
I THINK OUR RESOLUTION TWO      
TIMES AGO WAS THAT THERE SHOULD 

00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:41.755
I THINK OUR RESOLUTION TWO      
TIMES AGO WAS THAT THERE SHOULD 
BE NO LESS THAN 50 PERCENT      

00:09:41.757 --> 00:09:42.656
TIMES AGO WAS THAT THERE SHOULD 
BE NO LESS THAN 50 PERCENT      
OF THE MAYOR&apos;S SALARY AND THEN

BE NO LESS THAN 50 PERCENT      
OF THE MAYOR&apos;S SALARY AND THEN

CLOSING THAT GAP BECAUSE THESE  
PEOPLE THEY&apos;RE LIKE PART TIME   

00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:57.570
CLOSING THAT GAP BECAUSE THESE  
PEOPLE THEY&apos;RE LIKE PART TIME

AS AN INCENTIVE.                
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT 
THE GROUP HAS DECIDED IN THE    

00:11:10.713 --> 00:11:13.880
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT 
THE GROUP HAS DECIDED IN THE    
PAST AND WHAT&apos;S BEING SUGGESTED 

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:14.748
THE GROUP HAS DECIDED IN THE    
PAST AND WHAT&apos;S BEING SUGGESTED 
HERE AND I LIKE THE FOUR        

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.885
PAST AND WHAT&apos;S BEING SUGGESTED 
HERE AND I LIKE THE FOUR        
METRICS FOR DETERMINING THE THE 

00:11:17.887 --> 00:11:18.685
HERE AND I LIKE THE FOUR        
METRICS FOR DETERMINING THE THE 
ANNUAL INCREASE, YOU KNOW,      

00:11:18.687 --> 00:11:21.788
METRICS FOR DETERMINING THE THE 
ANNUAL INCREASE, YOU KNOW,      
ASSUMING THAT THE STRUCTURE IS  

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.723
ANNUAL INCREASE, YOU KNOW,      
ASSUMING THAT THE STRUCTURE IS  
SOUND THAT THAT ANNUAL INCREASE 

00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:26.392
ASSUMING THAT THE STRUCTURE IS  
SOUND THAT THAT ANNUAL INCREASE 
IS BASED ON FOUR MEASURES       

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:29.229
SOUND THAT THAT ANNUAL INCREASE 
IS BASED ON FOUR MEASURES       
OF COST OF LIVING BASICALLY AND 

00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:29.997
IS BASED ON FOUR MEASURES       
OF COST OF LIVING BASICALLY AND 
THEN KIND OF MELDING THOSE FOUR 

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:32.766
OF COST OF LIVING BASICALLY AND 
THEN KIND OF MELDING THOSE FOUR 
TO COME UP WITH AN AVERAGE      

00:11:32.768 --> 00:11:33.867
THEN KIND OF MELDING THOSE FOUR 
TO COME UP WITH AN AVERAGE      
INCREASE THAT FIRST IS SET FOR  

00:11:33.869 --> 00:11:38.638
TO COME UP WITH AN AVERAGE      
INCREASE THAT FIRST IS SET FOR  
THE MAYOR AND THEN FOR THE FOUR 

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.307
INCREASE THAT FIRST IS SET FOR  
THE MAYOR AND THEN FOR THE FOUR 
COUNCIL BASED ON EITHER FIFTY   

00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:42.242
THE MAYOR AND THEN FOR THE FOUR 
COUNCIL BASED ON EITHER FIFTY   
SEVEN POINT FIVE OR MORE THAN   

00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:45.412
COUNCIL BASED ON EITHER FIFTY   
SEVEN POINT FIVE OR MORE THAN   
60 PERCENT OF OF THE MAYOR&apos;S    

00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:45.812
SEVEN POINT FIVE OR MORE THAN   
60 PERCENT OF OF THE MAYOR&apos;S    
SALARY.                         

00:11:45.814 --> 00:11:46.813
60 PERCENT OF OF THE MAYOR&apos;S    
SALARY.                         
SO I THINK THAT I THINK THE THE 

00:11:46.815 --> 00:11:49.950
SALARY.                         
SO I THINK THAT I THINK THE THE 
MATH WORKS AND I THINK THAT THE 

00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:52.186
SO I THINK THAT I THINK THE THE 
MATH WORKS AND I THINK THAT THE 
STRUCTURE WORKS.                

00:11:52.188 --> 00:11:56.056
MATH WORKS AND I THINK THAT THE 
STRUCTURE WORKS.                
&gt;&gt; SO JUST TO BE CLEAR SO       

00:11:56.058 --> 00:11:56.923
STRUCTURE WORKS.                
&gt;&gt; SO JUST TO BE CLEAR SO       
CURRENTLY I SEE YOU HAVE DOWN

AND THAT GOES BACK TO WHEN YOU  

00:12:00.662 --> 00:12:04.164
HERE IT&apos;S A FIFTY FIVE PERCENT  
AND THAT GOES BACK TO WHEN YOU  
HAD INDICATED, BRIAN, THAT IT   

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.032
AND THAT GOES BACK TO WHEN YOU  
HAD INDICATED, BRIAN, THAT IT   
WAS NO LESS THAN 50 PERCENT.    

00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:05.398
HAD INDICATED, BRIAN, THAT IT   
WAS NO LESS THAN 50 PERCENT.

00:12:13.008 --> 00:12:15.608
I WOULD AGREE AS WELL.          
I MEAN I THINK THE I THINK THE  
METRICS THAT ARE BEING POLLED   

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.411
I MEAN I THINK THE I THINK THE  
METRICS THAT ARE BEING POLLED   
ARE VERY REALISTIC.             

00:12:18.413 --> 00:12:22.049
METRICS THAT ARE BEING POLLED   
ARE VERY REALISTIC.             
IT CERTAINLY GOES SHOWS WITH    

00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:22.983
ARE VERY REALISTIC.             
IT CERTAINLY GOES SHOWS WITH    
THE TIMES THAT WE&apos;RE IN RIGHT   

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:23.717
IT CERTAINLY GOES SHOWS WITH    
THE TIMES THAT WE&apos;RE IN RIGHT   
NOW AND HOW YOU KNOW, INFLATION 

00:12:23.719 --> 00:12:26.987
THE TIMES THAT WE&apos;RE IN RIGHT   
NOW AND HOW YOU KNOW, INFLATION
