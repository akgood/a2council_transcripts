MORE PEOPLE TO LIVE TOGETHER IN 
A BUILDING THAT LOOKS VERY      
SIMILAR TO THESE HUGE BUILDINGS 

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.177
A BUILDING THAT LOOKS VERY      
SIMILAR TO THESE HUGE BUILDINGS 
THAT ARE BEING BUILT AND ON     

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.179
SIMILAR TO THESE HUGE BUILDINGS 
THAT ARE BEING BUILT AND ON     
WALTER HILL KIND OF ALONG THE   

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:11.449
THAT ARE BEING BUILT AND ON     
WALTER HILL KIND OF ALONG THE   
SAME LINES.                     

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:12.651
WALTER HILL KIND OF ALONG THE   
SAME LINES.                     
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LOW    

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:15.520
SAME LINES.                     
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LOW    
RISE DISTRICT.                  

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:16.387
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LOW    
RISE DISTRICT.                  
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME       

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.022
RISE DISTRICT.                  
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME       
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE LOW RISE   

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:20.158
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME       
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE LOW RISE   
DISTRICT AS WRITTEN IN THE PLAN 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.892
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE LOW RISE   
DISTRICT AS WRITTEN IN THE PLAN 
EVENTUALLY BECOMING MULTIPLE    

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:21.560
DISTRICT AS WRITTEN IN THE PLAN 
EVENTUALLY BECOMING MULTIPLE    
DISTRICTS GOING TO GET AROUND   

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:23.594
EVENTUALLY BECOMING MULTIPLE    
DISTRICTS GOING TO GET AROUND   
TO DOING THE ZONING.            

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.763
DISTRICTS GOING TO GET AROUND   
TO DOING THE ZONING.            
AND SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT   

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.866
TO DOING THE ZONING.            
AND SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT   
EQUITY AND ALONG THOSE LINES    

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.869
AND SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT   
EQUITY AND ALONG THOSE LINES    
ZONING HISTORICALLY AROUND THE  

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:31.736
EQUITY AND ALONG THOSE LINES    
ZONING HISTORICALLY AROUND THE  
COUNTRY AND IN ANN ARBOR HAS    

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:32.503
ZONING HISTORICALLY AROUND THE  
COUNTRY AND IN ANN ARBOR HAS    
BEEN USED TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE     

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.173
COUNTRY AND IN ANN ARBOR HAS    
BEEN USED TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE     
CERTAIN PEOPLE, PEOPLE OF COLOR 

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:38.609
BEEN USED TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE     
CERTAIN PEOPLE, PEOPLE OF COLOR 
,LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND TOOLS    

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.378
CERTAIN PEOPLE, PEOPLE OF COLOR 
,LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND TOOLS    
LIKE MINIMUM LOT SIZE           

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.381
,LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND TOOLS    
LIKE MINIMUM LOT SIZE           
EXPLICITLY ARE A TOOL TO DENY   

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.350
LIKE MINIMUM LOT SIZE           
EXPLICITLY ARE A TOOL TO DENY   
PEOPLE ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SO 

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.385
EXPLICITLY ARE A TOOL TO DENY   
PEOPLE ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SO 
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE LOW     

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.152
PEOPLE ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SO 
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE LOW     
RISE DISTRICT, I HOPE THAT WE   

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:50.755
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE LOW     
RISE DISTRICT, I HOPE THAT WE   
CAN ACTUALLY ADD SOME LANGUAGE  

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:51.423
RISE DISTRICT, I HOPE THAT WE   
CAN ACTUALLY ADD SOME LANGUAGE  
TO THE PLAN THAT EXPLICITLY     

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:52.223
CAN ACTUALLY ADD SOME LANGUAGE  
TO THE PLAN THAT EXPLICITLY     
SAYS IF THEY END UP BEING       

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.826
TO THE PLAN THAT EXPLICITLY     
SAYS IF THEY END UP BEING       
MULTIPLE UNIQUE ZONING          

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:55.760
SAYS IF THEY END UP BEING       
MULTIPLE UNIQUE ZONING          
DISTRICTS THAT ARE PART OF THIS 

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.429
MULTIPLE UNIQUE ZONING          
DISTRICTS THAT ARE PART OF THIS 
LOW RISE DISTRICT THAT THEY ALL 

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:02.200
DISTRICTS THAT ARE PART OF THIS 
LOW RISE DISTRICT THAT THEY ALL 
HAVE THE SAME SITE PLAN DESIGNS 

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:02.934
LOW RISE DISTRICT THAT THEY ALL 
HAVE THE SAME SITE PLAN DESIGNS 
MEETING THE SAME MINIMUM LOT    

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:06.070
HAVE THE SAME SITE PLAN DESIGNS 
MEETING THE SAME MINIMUM LOT    
SIZES, SAME SETBACKS AND WE     

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:06.971
MEETING THE SAME MINIMUM LOT    
SIZES, SAME SETBACKS AND WE     
DON'T SAY WELL THIS DOESN'T FIT 

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.874
SIZES, SAME SETBACKS AND WE     
DON'T SAY WELL THIS DOESN'T FIT 
IN THE CHARACTER OF THE         

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:10.741
DON'T SAY WELL THIS DOESN'T FIT 
IN THE CHARACTER OF THE         
NEIGHBORHOOD OR ANY OTHER, YOU  

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:14.111
IN THE CHARACTER OF THE         
NEIGHBORHOOD OR ANY OTHER, YOU  
KNOW, MADE UP TERMS BECAUSE IT  

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:14.846
NEIGHBORHOOD OR ANY OTHER, YOU  
KNOW, MADE UP TERMS BECAUSE IT  
REALLY WOULDN'T BE EQUITABLE.   

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:15.614
KNOW, MADE UP TERMS BECAUSE IT  
REALLY WOULDN'T BE EQUITABLE.   
AND IF WE CARE ABOUT EQUITY AS  

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:18.283
REALLY WOULDN'T BE EQUITABLE.   
AND IF WE CARE ABOUT EQUITY AS  
A CITY, THAT'S SOMETHING WE     

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:21.753
AND IF WE CARE ABOUT EQUITY AS  
A CITY, THAT'S SOMETHING WE     
SHOULD CONSIDER RELATED POINTS  

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:25.690
A CITY, THAT'S SOMETHING WE     
SHOULD CONSIDER RELATED POINTS  
ALONG THOSE IDEAS I REALLY WE   

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:26.625
SHOULD CONSIDER RELATED POINTS  
ALONG THOSE IDEAS I REALLY WE   
SHOULD HAVE ONLY TWO ZONES.     

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:27.525
ALONG THOSE IDEAS I REALLY WE   
SHOULD HAVE ONLY TWO ZONES.     
SO THAT LOW RISE DISTRICT WE'VE 

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.327
SHOULD HAVE ONLY TWO ZONES.     
SO THAT LOW RISE DISTRICT WE'VE 
TALKED ABOUT AND THEN A WHAT    

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.128
SO THAT LOW RISE DISTRICT WE'VE 
TALKED ABOUT AND THEN A WHAT    
I'LL CALL A CITY DISTRICT WE    

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.997
TALKED ABOUT AND THEN A WHAT    
I'LL CALL A CITY DISTRICT WE    
ARE A CITY WE SHOULD DESIGN OUR 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.701
I'LL CALL A CITY DISTRICT WE    
ARE A CITY WE SHOULD DESIGN OUR 
CITY AROUND THE DENSITY THAT IS 

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:37.636
ARE A CITY WE SHOULD DESIGN OUR 
CITY AROUND THE DENSITY THAT IS 
NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE NUMBER    

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:38.503
CITY AROUND THE DENSITY THAT IS 
NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE NUMBER    
OF PEOPLE IN THE GREAT SERVICES 

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.972
NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE NUMBER    
OF PEOPLE IN THE GREAT SERVICES 
THAT WE HAVE HERE.              

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:41.906
OF PEOPLE IN THE GREAT SERVICES 
THAT WE HAVE HERE.              
SO THAT CITY DISTRICT I THINK   

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:45.577
THAT WE HAVE HERE.              
SO THAT CITY DISTRICT I THINK   
COULD HAVE TAPER BUILT IN OR A  

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:46.110
SO THAT CITY DISTRICT I THINK   
COULD HAVE TAPER BUILT IN OR A  
STEP BACK BUILT IN.             

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:48.679
COULD HAVE TAPER BUILT IN OR A  
STEP BACK BUILT IN.             
I THINK ONE ALREADY HAS.        

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.614
STEP BACK BUILT IN.             
I THINK ONE ALREADY HAS.        
SO CITY DISTRICT PARCELS THAT   

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:52.984
I THINK ONE ALREADY HAS.        
SO CITY DISTRICT PARCELS THAT   
ARE NEAR LOW RISE PARCELS WOULD 

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:53.485
SO CITY DISTRICT PARCELS THAT   
ARE NEAR LOW RISE PARCELS WOULD 
BE LIMITED IN HEIGHT.           

00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:54.552
ARE NEAR LOW RISE PARCELS WOULD 
BE LIMITED IN HEIGHT.           
BUT AS YOU GET FURTHER AWAY     

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.655
BE LIMITED IN HEIGHT.           
BUT AS YOU GET FURTHER AWAY     
FROM LOW RISE AREAS YOU DON'T   

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:57.188
BUT AS YOU GET FURTHER AWAY     
FROM LOW RISE AREAS YOU DON'T   
HAVE A NEW ZONE.                

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.791
FROM LOW RISE AREAS YOU DON'T   
HAVE A NEW ZONE.                
YOU JUST HAVE THE ONE ZONE AND  

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:00.725
HAVE A NEW ZONE.                
YOU JUST HAVE THE ONE ZONE AND  
ITS HEIGHT LIMIT IS BASED ON    

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:01.592
YOU JUST HAVE THE ONE ZONE AND  
ITS HEIGHT LIMIT IS BASED ON    
ITS PROXIMITY TO THE LOW RISE   

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:04.396
ITS HEIGHT LIMIT IS BASED ON    
ITS PROXIMITY TO THE LOW RISE   
PARSHALL'S SO SIMILAR I THINK   

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:05.330
ITS PROXIMITY TO THE LOW RISE   
PARSHALL'S SO SIMILAR I THINK   
WE SHOULD JUST GET RID OF THE   

00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:07.966
PARSHALL'S SO SIMILAR I THINK   
WE SHOULD JUST GET RID OF THE   
FLEX DISTRICT.                  

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.234
WE SHOULD JUST GET RID OF THE   
FLEX DISTRICT.                  
IT ADDS A LOT OF WORDS THAT     

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:12.937
FLEX DISTRICT.                  
IT ADDS A LOT OF WORDS THAT     
ALLOWS HOUSING MAYBE D          

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:13.572
IT ADDS A LOT OF WORDS THAT     
ALLOWS HOUSING MAYBE D          
PRIORITIZES HOUSING IN THIS     

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:16.908
ALLOWS HOUSING MAYBE D          
PRIORITIZES HOUSING IN THIS     
VAGUE WAY.                      

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.809
PRIORITIZES HOUSING IN THIS     
VAGUE WAY.                      
I DON'T THINK IT ADDS VALUE.    

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:19.945
VAGUE WAY.                      
I DON'T THINK IT ADDS VALUE.    
WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS SO   

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:20.812
I DON'T THINK IT ADDS VALUE.    
WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS SO   
WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE BUILDING   

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:23.948
WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS SO   
WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE BUILDING   
HOUSING TO SUPPORT MORE PEOPLE  

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.349
WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE BUILDING   
HOUSING TO SUPPORT MORE PEOPLE

YOU GUYS HAVE PUT UP, IT'S NOT  
A LARGE NUMBER AND YOU REALLY   
WONDER HAS IT BEEN RANDOM

WONDER HAS IT BEEN RANDOM

WONDER HAS IT BEEN RANDOM

HOW HAVE YOU COME UP WITH THOSE 
NUMBERS?                        
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THERE   

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:53.811
NUMBERS?                        
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THERE   
IS A SURVEY OF THREE THOUSAND   

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.680
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THERE   
IS A SURVEY OF THREE THOUSAND   
ONE HUNDRED AND YOU THINK WELL  

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:58.750
IS A SURVEY OF THREE THOUSAND   
ONE HUNDRED AND YOU THINK WELL  
AT LEAST IF THAT HAS BEEN AN

AT LEAST IF THAT HAS BEEN AN    
HONEST DISCUSSION OR HONEST

AND BY THAT I MEAN COMMON SENSE 

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.258
DEBATE WE AT LEAST HAVE THAT.   
AND BY THAT I MEAN COMMON SENSE 
WOULD SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.828
AND BY THAT I MEAN COMMON SENSE 
WOULD SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD 
ANYWHERE FROM SEVENTY FIVE      

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.562
WOULD SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD 
ANYWHERE FROM SEVENTY FIVE

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:12.297
ANYWHERE FROM SEVENTY FIVE

TO LOSE A LOT OF BIG OLD TREES.

NOISE, WATER RUNOFF WE'RE GOING 
TO LOSE A LOT OF BIG OLD TREES. 
THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND   

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:22.407
TO LOSE A LOT OF BIG OLD TREES. 
THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND   
ISSUES INVOLVED.                

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.275
THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND   
ISSUES INVOLVED.                
SO YOU WOULD THINK THOSE WOULD  

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:26.510
ISSUES INVOLVED.                
SO YOU WOULD THINK THOSE WOULD  
SOMEHOW BE TOUCHED ON IN THE    

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:26.811
SO YOU WOULD THINK THOSE WOULD  
SOMEHOW BE TOUCHED ON IN THE

SOMEHOW BE TOUCHED ON IN THE

OF THAT IS DISCUSSED AT ALL.    

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.783
BUT I GOT A COPY OF IT AND NONE 
OF THAT IS DISCUSSED AT ALL.    
IN FACT, IT'S MORE OF JUST A    

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.251
OF THAT IS DISCUSSED AT ALL.    
IN FACT, IT'S MORE OF JUST A    
DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE       

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:37.389
IN FACT, IT'S MORE OF JUST A

DECREASE THE RATE OF INCREASE   

00:57:42.993 --> 00:57:46.428
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT POTENTIALLY  
DECREASE THE RATE OF INCREASE   
OF COSTS BUT THAT THE GOAL IS   

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:47.095
DECREASE THE RATE OF INCREASE   
OF COSTS BUT THAT THE GOAL IS   
NOT NECESSARILY AFFORDABLE.     

00:57:47.097 --> 00:57:48.062
OF COSTS BUT THAT THE GOAL IS   
NOT NECESSARILY AFFORDABLE.     
AND I THINK THAT THAT THESE

THEY'RE CERTAINLY MIXED UP TO   
ME AND I'VE READ THAT AT LEAST  
FOUR OR FIVE TIMES SO SO I'M    

00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:58.340
ME AND I'VE READ THAT AT LEAST  
FOUR OR FIVE TIMES SO SO I'M    
I'M STRUGGLING WITH WHAT THAT

TEN YEARS TO GO.                
A COUPLE WHO ARE A BUILDER AND

SO NOW AGGREGATE THAT PROPERTY  
IS WORTH TWO POINT FIVE OR TWO

COMPANIES RATHER THAT HAVE A    
LARGER OWNERSHIP OF THE CITY    

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:29.008
COMPANIES RATHER THAT HAVE A    
LARGER OWNERSHIP OF THE CITY

IT'S BEEN MENTIONED I THINK IN  
A PREVIOUS MEETING THAT THE     

01:42:36.384 --> 01:42:40.185
IT'S BEEN MENTIONED I THINK IN  
A PREVIOUS MEETING THAT THE     
PLANNING COMMISSION HAD HAD     

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:40.919
A PREVIOUS MEETING THAT THE     
PLANNING COMMISSION HAD HAD     
DEALS WHERE DEVELOPERS DID NOT  

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:41.653

DEALS WHERE DEVELOPERS DID NOT  
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ALL         

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:44.523
DEALS WHERE DEVELOPERS DID NOT  
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ALL         
OF THEIR PROMISES NECESSARILY   

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:45.291
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ALL         
OF THEIR PROMISES NECESSARILY   
AND THERE WAS NO SYSTEM         

01:42:45.293 --> 01:42:48.293
OF THEIR PROMISES NECESSARILY   
AND THERE WAS NO SYSTEM         
OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT AND  

01:42:48.295 --> 01:42:49.227
AND THERE WAS NO SYSTEM         
OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT AND  
I DON'T KNOW IF I MISUNDERSTOOD 

01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:52.698
OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT AND  
I DON'T KNOW IF I MISUNDERSTOOD 
THAT BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.366
I DON'T KNOW IF I MISUNDERSTOOD 
THAT BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 
I THINK ALSO NEEDS TO BE        

01:42:53.368 --> 01:42:55.934
THAT BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 
I THINK ALSO NEEDS TO BE        
ADDRESSED AND A LOT OF THESE    

01:42:55.936 --> 01:42:56.602
I THINK ALSO NEEDS TO BE        
ADDRESSED AND A LOT OF THESE    
ESPECIALLY THE PLANNING         

01:42:56.604 --> 01:42:57.403

01:42:57.405 --> 01:43:02.074
ESPECIALLY THE PLANNING         
COMMISSIONS NOT LAW BUT IT'S A

WHAT WE INTEND TO BRING ABOUT   
IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS FOR THE    
CITY AND I THINK A BIG PART     

01:43:06.781 --> 01:43:07.579
IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS FOR THE

OF THAT SHOULD BE EMPOWERING    
THE PEOPLE AND THE PLANNING

SOME KIND OF REHABILITATION     
OF A LOT SO THAT IT'S           

01:43:25.133 --> 01:43:26.132
SOME KIND OF REHABILITATION     
OF A LOT SO THAT IT'S

STRANGE ORDER TO ME I THOUGHT   
THE STREET AND TRANSPARENT I    

02:09:09.742 --> 02:09:10.407
STRANGE ORDER TO ME I THOUGHT   
THE STREET AND TRANSPARENT I    
KNOW WE'RE NOT THESE AREN'T     

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:13.043
THE STREET AND TRANSPARENT I

LIKE PRIORITIES NECESSARILY BUT 

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:13.744
KNOW WE'RE NOT THESE AREN'T     
LIKE PRIORITIES NECESSARILY BUT 
LIKE I THOUGHT THAT THE STREET  

02:09:13.746 --> 02:09:16.914
LIKE PRIORITIES NECESSARILY BUT 
LIKE I THOUGHT THAT THE STREET  
AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM GOAL  

02:09:16.916 --> 02:09:17.781
LIKE I THOUGHT THAT THE STREET  
AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM GOAL  
IS GOAL NINE SHOULD BE THE      

02:09:17.783 --> 02:09:18.448
AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM GOAL  
IS GOAL NINE SHOULD BE THE      
FIRST ONE AND LIKE THE          

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:21.051
IS GOAL NINE SHOULD BE THE      
FIRST ONE AND LIKE THE          
COMMUNITY RESILIENCE MOVE DOWN. 

02:09:21.053 --> 02:09:22.186
FIRST ONE AND LIKE THE          
COMMUNITY RESILIENCE MOVE DOWN. 
I JUST I MEAN I WASN'T SURE IF  

02:09:22.188 --> 02:09:24.488
COMMUNITY RESILIENCE MOVE DOWN. 
I JUST I MEAN I WASN'T SURE IF  
THERE WAS A SPECIFIC REASON     

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:25.389
I JUST I MEAN I WASN'T SURE IF  
THERE WAS A SPECIFIC REASON     
THEY WERE ORDERED THAT WAY OR   

02:09:25.391 --> 02:09:26.157
THERE WAS A SPECIFIC REASON     
THEY WERE ORDERED THAT WAY OR

THEY WERE ORDERED THAT WAY OR   
NOT OR IF WE CAN REORDER THEM   
THEY CAN BE REORDERED.          

02:09:28.561 --> 02:09:29.893
NOT OR IF WE CAN REORDER THEM   
THEY CAN BE REORDERED.          
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR BASIS FOR    

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:31.929
THEY CAN BE REORDERED.          
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR BASIS FOR    
HAVING THAT FIRST?              

02:09:31.931 --> 02:09:32.763
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR BASIS FOR    
HAVING THAT FIRST?              
HAVING TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE   

02:09:32.765 --> 02:09:35.833
HAVING THAT FIRST?              
HAVING TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE   
IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE CHAPTER  

02:09:35.835 --> 02:09:36.667
HAVING TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE   
IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE CHAPTER  
AND I FELT LIKE STREET AND      

02:09:36.669 --> 02:09:39.937
IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE CHAPTER  
AND I FELT LIKE STREET AND      
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE LIKE 

02:09:39.939 --> 02:09:40.604
AND I FELT LIKE STREET AND      
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE LIKE 
REALLY CRITICAL COMPONENTS      

02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:43.640
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE LIKE 
REALLY CRITICAL COMPONENTS      
OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE 

02:09:43.642 --> 02:09:44.408
REALLY CRITICAL COMPONENTS      
OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE 
BEEN DISCUSSING A LOT HERE.     

02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:47.979
OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE 
BEEN DISCUSSING A LOT HERE.     
WHAT WAS MY SECOND I THINK      

02:09:47.981 --> 02:09:48.846
BEEN DISCUSSING A LOT HERE.     
WHAT WAS MY SECOND I THINK      
TWELVE I WOULD MOVE TO BEAGLE   

02:09:48.848 --> 02:09:51.515
WHAT WAS MY SECOND I THINK      
TWELVE I WOULD MOVE TO BEAGLE   
NINE AND THEN I DIDN'T REALLY   

02:09:51.517 --> 02:09:55.953
TWELVE I WOULD MOVE TO BEAGLE   
NINE AND THEN I DIDN'T REALLY   
REORDER THE OTHER THREE I DON'T 

02:09:55.955 --> 02:09:56.954
NINE AND THEN I DIDN'T REALLY   
REORDER THE OTHER THREE I DON'T 
KNOW I GUESS BECAUSE IT WAS AN  

02:09:56.956 --> 02:09:59.022
REORDER THE OTHER THREE I DON'T 
KNOW I GUESS BECAUSE IT WAS AN  
INFRASTRUCTURE CHAPTER.         

02:09:59.024 --> 02:09:59.623
KNOW I GUESS BECAUSE IT WAS AN  
INFRASTRUCTURE CHAPTER.         
>> THAT'S FINE.                 

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:02.559

>> THAT'S FINE.                 
I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THOSE BACK    

02:10:02.561 --> 02:10:03.727

02:10:03.729 --> 02:10:06.897
I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THOSE BACK    
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS 
THERE IN PRIORITY ORDER.

ON HOW THEY'RE DISCUSSED I      
WOULD IMAGINE REORDER GOALS TO  

02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:14.939
ON HOW THEY'RE DISCUSSED I      
WOULD IMAGINE REORDER GOALS TO  
HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST IS    

02:10:14.941 --> 02:10:18.842
WOULD IMAGINE REORDER GOALS TO  
HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST IS    
WHAT I'M HEARING.               

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:22.580
HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST IS    
WHAT I'M HEARING.               
OK, UM THERE ARE OTHER COMMENTS

IT'S BLOCKING IT AND I'M NOT    
UNSYMPATHETIC TO THAT BECAUSE I 
HAVE SOLAR PANELS IN OUR GARAGE 

02:14:18.083 --> 02:14:18.882
UNSYMPATHETIC TO THAT BECAUSE I 
HAVE SOLAR PANELS IN OUR GARAGE 
AND WOULD BUY ORDERS THEN BUY

IN ANCIENT DAYS PEOPLE WORRIED  
ABOUT ACCESS TO LIGHT AND SUN   

02:14:39.838 --> 02:14:40.537

SOLAR I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE     

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:48.245
INVESTING MONEY TO HARVEST      
SOLAR I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE     
SYMPATHETIC TO ACTUALLY WHEN    

02:14:48.247 --> 02:14:51.281
SOLAR I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE     
SYMPATHETIC TO ACTUALLY WHEN    
YOU SPENT TWENTY THOUSAND       

02:14:51.283 --> 02:14:51.982
SYMPATHETIC TO ACTUALLY WHEN    
YOU SPENT TWENTY THOUSAND       
DOLLARS ON A SOLAR ARRAY.       

02:14:51.984 --> 02:14:53.083
YOU SPENT TWENTY THOUSAND       
DOLLARS ON A SOLAR ARRAY.       
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE BIT FLIP TO 

02:14:53.085 --> 02:14:55.218
DOLLARS ON A SOLAR ARRAY.       
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE BIT FLIP TO 
SAY YEAH TOO BAD.               

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:56.220
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE BIT FLIP TO 
SAY YEAH TOO BAD.               
WELL I WONDER IF THERE'S SOME   

02:14:56.222 --> 02:14:59.122
SAY YEAH TOO BAD.               
WELL I WONDER IF THERE'S SOME   
IT'S NOT INCONCEIVABLE TO ME    

02:14:59.124 --> 02:14:59.889
WELL I WONDER IF THERE'S SOME   
IT'S NOT INCONCEIVABLE TO ME    
THAT IF SOMEBODY IS BUILDING A  

02:14:59.891 --> 02:15:03.060
IT'S NOT INCONCEIVABLE TO ME    
THAT IF SOMEBODY IS BUILDING A  
LARGE PROJECT WITH SOME SOLAR   

02:15:03.062 --> 02:15:03.927
THAT IF SOMEBODY IS BUILDING A  
LARGE PROJECT WITH SOME SOLAR   
MAYBE THEY COULD MOVE THE SOLAR 

02:15:03.929 --> 02:15:04.694
LARGE PROJECT WITH SOME SOLAR   
MAYBE THEY COULD MOVE THE SOLAR 
PANELS ONTO THE TOP OF THE      

02:15:04.696 --> 02:15:07.097
MAYBE THEY COULD MOVE THE SOLAR 
PANELS ONTO THE TOP OF THE      
BUILDING OR SOMETHING LIKE      

02:15:07.099 --> 02:15:07.430
PANELS ONTO THE TOP OF THE      
BUILDING OR SOMETHING LIKE      
THAT.                           

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:08.231
BUILDING OR SOMETHING LIKE      
THAT.                           
THERE MIGHT BE CREATIVE WAYS TO 

02:15:08.233 --> 02:15:11.201
THAT.                           
THERE MIGHT BE CREATIVE WAYS TO 
THINK ABOUT GETTING THOSE THOSE 

02:15:11.203 --> 02:15:15.005
THERE MIGHT BE CREATIVE WAYS TO 
THINK ABOUT GETTING THOSE THOSE 
KINDS OF IMPACTS WHAT SO WE CAN 

02:15:15.007 --> 02:15:18.675
THINK ABOUT GETTING THOSE THOSE 
KINDS OF IMPACTS WHAT SO WE CAN 
PUNT ON THIS ONE BUT I CAN THAT 

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:22.479
KINDS OF IMPACTS WHAT SO WE CAN 
PUNT ON THIS ONE BUT I CAN THAT 
WOULD PROBABLY WORK IN AN ICU   

02:15:22.481 --> 02:15:27.117
PUNT ON THIS ONE BUT I CAN THAT 
WOULD PROBABLY WORK IN AN ICU   
THE WAY THAT UTILITY LAWS ARE   

02:15:27.119 --> 02:15:29.920
WOULD PROBABLY WORK IN AN ICU   
THE WAY THAT UTILITY LAWS ARE   
IN THE CURRENT STATE FOR THAT   

02:15:29.922 --> 02:15:31.021
THE WAY THAT UTILITY LAWS ARE   
IN THE CURRENT STATE FOR THAT   
IT HAS TO BE YOU CAN'T MOVE IT  

02:15:31.023 --> 02:15:35.125
IN THE CURRENT STATE FOR THAT   
IT HAS TO BE YOU CAN'T MOVE IT  
ACROSS PROPERTY LINES AND SO    

02:15:35.127 --> 02:15:35.826
IT HAS TO BE YOU CAN'T MOVE IT  
ACROSS PROPERTY LINES AND SO    
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IF    

02:15:35.828 --> 02:15:38.995
ACROSS PROPERTY LINES AND SO    
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IF    
YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE       

02:15:38.997 --> 02:15:39.763
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IF    
YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE       
UTILITY YOU CAN CHANGE THAT     

02:15:39.765 --> 02:15:42.399
YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE       
UTILITY YOU CAN CHANGE THAT     
RULE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE   

02:15:42.401 --> 02:15:43.066
UTILITY YOU CAN CHANGE THAT     
RULE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE   
THAT'S ONE OF THE TRICKS.       

02:15:43.068 --> 02:15:43.934
RULE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE   
THAT'S ONE OF THE TRICKS.       
AND JUST FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH    

02:15:43.936 --> 02:15:46.470
THAT'S ONE OF THE TRICKS.       
AND JUST FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH    
LIKE I I HAVE I'M WORKING WITH  

02:15:46.472 --> 02:15:50.007
AND JUST FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH    
LIKE I I HAVE I'M WORKING WITH  
SOME FACULTY ON CAMPUS TO TO    

02:15:50.009 --> 02:15:50.974
LIKE I I HAVE I'M WORKING WITH  
SOME FACULTY ON CAMPUS TO TO    
TRY TO DO SOME MODELING ABOUT   

02:15:50.976 --> 02:15:54.277
SOME FACULTY ON CAMPUS TO TO    
TRY TO DO SOME MODELING ABOUT   
HOW BIG OF A DEAL THIS IS IN    

02:15:54.279 --> 02:15:54.778
TRY TO DO SOME MODELING ABOUT   
HOW BIG OF A DEAL THIS IS IN    
TERMS OF SHADING.               

02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:55.578
HOW BIG OF A DEAL THIS IS IN    
TERMS OF SHADING.               
SO I'M OK LIKE I'M MEETING WITH 

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.981
TERMS OF SHADING.               
SO I'M OK LIKE I'M MEETING WITH

02:16:00.252 --> 02:16:02.719
MENTIONED TO ME IS I'LL BE      
DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THAT.    
IT'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A LITTLE 

02:16:02.721 --> 02:16:09.126
DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THAT.    
IT'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A LITTLE 
BIT INCONGRUENT TO BE           

02:16:23.474 --> 02:16:25.609
ENCOURAGING EVERYBODY IN THE    
BROTHERHOOD TO BE PUT ON SOLAR  
AND SAYING BUT IF SOMEONE GOES

SO WE SHOULD AT LEAST IN THE    
PLAN BE ACKNOWLEDGING WE NEED   
TO FIND SOME WAY TO ADDRESS     

02:16:28.413 --> 02:16:28.946
PLAN BE ACKNOWLEDGING WE NEED   
TO FIND SOME WAY TO ADDRESS     
THAT CONGRUENCY AND IF          

02:16:28.948 --> 02:16:29.780
TO FIND SOME WAY TO ADDRESS     
THAT CONGRUENCY AND IF          
SOMEONE'S GOING TO SPEND A LOT  

02:16:29.782 --> 02:16:30.513
THAT CONGRUENCY AND IF          
SOMEONE'S GOING TO SPEND A LOT  
OF MONEY INVESTING IN SOLAR, WE 

02:16:30.515 --> 02:16:31.248
SOMEONE'S GOING TO SPEND A LOT  
OF MONEY INVESTING IN SOLAR, WE 
NEED TO HELP FIGURE OUT HOW TO  

02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:32.049
OF MONEY INVESTING IN SOLAR, WE 
NEED TO HELP FIGURE OUT HOW TO  
MAKE IT WORK AND AND NOT JUST   

02:16:32.051 --> 02:16:32.716
NEED TO HELP FIGURE OUT HOW TO  
MAKE IT WORK AND AND NOT JUST   
SAY YOU'RE THE YOU'RE AT THE    

02:16:32.718 --> 02:16:33.317
MAKE IT WORK AND AND NOT JUST

WHO WHO HAS THE RIGHTS AND WHO  
HAS TO BUY THE RIGHT FROM THE   

02:16:34.787 --> 02:16:35.585
WHO WHO HAS THE RIGHTS AND WHO  
HAS TO BUY THE RIGHT FROM THE   
RIGHT LIKE THIS IS EASEMENTS    

02:16:35.587 --> 02:16:36.320
HAS TO BUY THE RIGHT FROM THE   
RIGHT LIKE THIS IS EASEMENTS    
VERSUS KIND OF AN ORDINANCE.    

02:16:36.322 --> 02:16:37.121
RIGHT LIKE THIS IS EASEMENTS    
VERSUS KIND OF AN ORDINANCE.    
I MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 

02:16:37.123 --> 02:16:37.854
VERSUS KIND OF AN ORDINANCE.    
I MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD JUST   

02:16:37.856 --> 02:16:39.723
I MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD JUST   
UNDERSTAND TOO AND ALSO         

02:16:39.725 --> 02:16:40.557
THAT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD JUST   
UNDERSTAND TOO AND ALSO         
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CHANGE IN   

02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:41.358
UNDERSTAND TOO AND ALSO         
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CHANGE IN   
HEIGHT IS RIGHT NOW IF YOUR     

02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:44.428
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CHANGE IN   
HEIGHT IS RIGHT NOW IF YOUR     
NEIGHBOR BUILDS TO THE CURRENT  

02:16:44.430 --> 02:16:44.894
HEIGHT IS RIGHT NOW IF YOUR     
NEIGHBOR BUILDS TO THE CURRENT  
HEIGHT LIMIT.                   

02:16:44.896 --> 02:16:47.164
NEIGHBOR BUILDS TO THE CURRENT  
HEIGHT LIMIT.                   
RIGHT LIKE IT'S I WE SHOULDN'T  

02:16:47.166 --> 02:16:51.001
HEIGHT LIMIT.                   
RIGHT LIKE IT'S I WE SHOULDN'T  
BE CONSIDERING A A BLANK        

02:16:51.003 --> 02:16:51.935
RIGHT LIKE IT'S I WE SHOULDN'T  
BE CONSIDERING A A BLANK        
PROPERTY OR JUST KIND OF WHAT   

02:16:51.937 --> 02:16:52.603
BE CONSIDERING A A BLANK        
PROPERTY OR JUST KIND OF WHAT   
YOUR NEIGHBOR HAPPENS TO HAVE   

02:16:52.605 --> 02:16:54.871
PROPERTY OR JUST KIND OF WHAT   
YOUR NEIGHBOR HAPPENS TO HAVE   
CURRENTLY.                      

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:55.806
YOUR NEIGHBOR HAPPENS TO HAVE   
CURRENTLY.                      
I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD REALLY   

02:16:55.808 --> 02:16:58.074
CURRENTLY.                      
I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD REALLY   
BE CONSIDERING IS LIKE WHAT THE 

02:16:58.076 --> 02:16:58.742
I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD REALLY   
BE CONSIDERING IS LIKE WHAT THE 
MAX HEIGHT NOW THAT YOUR        

02:16:58.744 --> 02:16:59.509
BE CONSIDERING IS LIKE WHAT THE 
MAX HEIGHT NOW THAT YOUR        
NEIGHBOR IS ALLOWED TO BUILD    

02:16:59.511 --> 02:17:02.612
MAX HEIGHT NOW THAT YOUR        
NEIGHBOR IS ALLOWED TO BUILD    
AND ALSO JUST FOR WHAT IT'S     

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:03.313
NEIGHBOR IS ALLOWED TO BUILD    
AND ALSO JUST FOR WHAT IT'S     
WORTH, TREES ARE A BIGGER       

02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:03.980
AND ALSO JUST FOR WHAT IT'S     
WORTH, TREES ARE A BIGGER       
PROBLEM THAN BUILDINGS ARE      

02:17:03.982 --> 02:17:06.216
WORTH, TREES ARE A BIGGER       
PROBLEM THAN BUILDINGS ARE      
GOING TO BE.                    

02:17:06.218 --> 02:17:07.184
PROBLEM THAN BUILDINGS ARE      
GOING TO BE.                    
AND SO ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO  

02:17:07.186 --> 02:17:07.584
GOING TO BE.                    
AND SO ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO  
TALK ABOUT TREE.                

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:09.887
AND SO ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO  
TALK ABOUT TREE.                
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT RECOVER   

02:17:09.889 --> 02:17:10.987
TALK ABOUT TREE.                
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT RECOVER   
BECAUSE THIS IS A TREE TOWN AND 

02:17:10.989 --> 02:17:14.157
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT RECOVER   
BECAUSE THIS IS A TREE TOWN AND 
THAT IS GOING TO BE A IT'S A    

02:17:14.159 --> 02:17:14.891
BECAUSE THIS IS A TREE TOWN AND 
THAT IS GOING TO BE A IT'S A    
BIGGER TRICK FOR SOLAR AND I    

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:17.094
THAT IS GOING TO BE A IT'S A    
BIGGER TRICK FOR SOLAR AND I    
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A        

02:17:17.096 --> 02:17:17.894
BIGGER TRICK FOR SOLAR AND I    
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A        
TRICKIER THING FOR US TO JUST   

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:18.162
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A        
TRICKIER THING FOR US TO JUST   
ADDRESS.                        

02:17:18.164 --> 02:17:20.964
TRICKIER THING FOR US TO JUST   
ADDRESS.                        
SO I'M ACTUALLY NOT SUGGESTING  

02:17:20.966 --> 02:17:21.998
ADDRESS.                        
SO I'M ACTUALLY NOT SUGGESTING  
THAT WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN    

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:22.332
SO I'M ACTUALLY NOT SUGGESTING  
THAT WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN    
THE PLAN.                       

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:23.133
THAT WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN    
THE PLAN.                       
I'M SUGGESTING THAT IN THE PLAN 

02:17:23.135 --> 02:17:25.336
THE PLAN.                       
I'M SUGGESTING THAT IN THE PLAN 
WE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PROBLEMS     

02:17:25.338 --> 02:17:26.269
I'M SUGGESTING THAT IN THE PLAN 
WE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PROBLEMS     
HERE THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT 

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:26.737
WE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PROBLEMS     
HERE THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT 
HOW TO RESOLVE.                 

02:17:26.739 --> 02:17:27.804
HERE THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT 
HOW TO RESOLVE.                 
OK, YEAH, THAT'S A THAT'S A     

02:17:27.806 --> 02:17:29.206
HOW TO RESOLVE.                 
OK, YEAH, THAT'S A THAT'S A     
GOOD OBSERVATION.               

02:17:29.208 --> 02:17:29.606
OK, YEAH, THAT'S A THAT'S A     
GOOD OBSERVATION.               
YES.                            

02:17:29.608 --> 02:17:30.007
GOOD OBSERVATION.               
YES.                            
YES.

YES.                            
GOOD GREAT SPACE FOR THOSE WHO  

02:17:33.079 --> 02:17:33.877
YES.                            
GOOD GREAT SPACE FOR THOSE WHO  
ARE VALUES AND HOW THEY ARE     

02:17:33.879 --> 02:17:37.013
GOOD GREAT SPACE FOR THOSE WHO  
ARE VALUES AND HOW THEY ARE     
GOING TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS  

02:17:37.015 --> 02:17:37.914
ARE VALUES AND HOW THEY ARE     
GOING TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS  
TRADE OFFS AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  

02:17:37.916 --> 02:17:38.248
GOING TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS  
TRADE OFFS AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  
RIGHT.                          

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:41.185
TRADE OFFS AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  
RIGHT.                          
AND SO WE HAVE AFFORDABILITY.   

02:17:41.187 --> 02:17:41.918
RIGHT.                          
AND SO WE HAVE AFFORDABILITY.   
WE HAVE SUSTAINABILITY.         

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:42.653
AND SO WE HAVE AFFORDABILITY.   
WE HAVE SUSTAINABILITY.         
WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE WANT  

02:17:42.655 --> 02:17:44.454
WE HAVE SUSTAINABILITY.         
WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE WANT  
TO BUILD TALLER BUILDINGS TO    

02:17:44.456 --> 02:17:45.255
WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE WANT  
TO BUILD TALLER BUILDINGS TO    
HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT  

02:17:45.257 --> 02:17:47.825
TO BUILD TALLER BUILDINGS TO    
HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT  
THEN IT MIGHT GO AGAINST SOME   

02:17:47.827 --> 02:17:48.492
HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT  
THEN IT MIGHT GO AGAINST SOME   
OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS     

02:17:48.494 --> 02:17:49.159
THEN IT MIGHT GO AGAINST SOME   
OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS     
OF HAVING SOLAR PANEL?          

02:17:49.161 --> 02:17:52.662
OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS     
OF HAVING SOLAR PANEL?          
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A PERFECT 

02:17:52.664 --> 02:17:53.497
OF HAVING SOLAR PANEL?          
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A PERFECT 
EXAMPLE OF HOW WE HAVE TO TALK  

02:17:53.499 --> 02:17:56.032
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A PERFECT 
EXAMPLE OF HOW WE HAVE TO TALK  
ABOUT ALL OF THESE AS TRADEOFFS 

02:17:56.034 --> 02:17:56.233
EXAMPLE OF HOW WE HAVE TO TALK  
ABOUT ALL OF THESE AS TRADEOFFS 
.                               

02:17:56.235 --> 02:17:59.936
ABOUT ALL OF THESE AS TRADEOFFS 
.                               
>> AND SO COULD YOU TAKE A NOTE 

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:01.004
.                               
>> AND SO COULD YOU TAKE A NOTE 
FOR THE I THINK THE POINT THAT  

02:18:01.006 --> 02:18:03.673
>> AND SO COULD YOU TAKE A NOTE 
FOR THE I THINK THE POINT THAT  
I HEARD THAT WAS REALLY GOOD    

02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:07.244
FOR THE I THINK THE POINT THAT  
I HEARD THAT WAS REALLY GOOD    
WAS DTT THE UTILITY PROVIDER    

02:18:07.246 --> 02:18:11.147
I HEARD THAT WAS REALLY GOOD    
WAS DTT THE UTILITY PROVIDER    
HAS LIMITATIONS CURRENTLY THAT  

02:18:11.149 --> 02:18:15.018
WAS DTT THE UTILITY PROVIDER    
HAS LIMITATIONS CURRENTLY THAT  
THE CITIES SEE YOU POTENTIALLY  

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.119
HAS LIMITATIONS CURRENTLY THAT  
THE CITIES SEE YOU POTENTIALLY  
HAVE AND SO THERE WOULD BE WAYS 

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:19.757
THE CITIES SEE YOU POTENTIALLY  
HAVE AND SO THERE WOULD BE WAYS 
FOR US TO BOTH DENSIFY THROUGH  

02:18:19.759 --> 02:18:23.493
HAVE AND SO THERE WOULD BE WAYS 
FOR US TO BOTH DENSIFY THROUGH  
THAT ALSO ACHIEVE THE SAME      

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:26.897
FOR US TO BOTH DENSIFY THROUGH  
THAT ALSO ACHIEVE THE SAME      
SUSTAINABILITY OF THOSE WITH    

02:18:26.899 --> 02:18:27.730
THAT ALSO ACHIEVE THE SAME      
SUSTAINABILITY OF THOSE WITH    
RENEWABLE ENERGY BECAUSE THE    

02:18:27.732 --> 02:18:31.201
SUSTAINABILITY OF THOSE WITH    
RENEWABLE ENERGY BECAUSE THE    
SIU HAS WOULD HAVE NEW EASEMENT 

02:18:31.203 --> 02:18:31.468
RENEWABLE ENERGY BECAUSE THE    
SIU HAS WOULD HAVE NEW EASEMENT 
POWERS.                         

02:18:31.470 --> 02:18:34.337
SIU HAS WOULD HAVE NEW EASEMENT 
POWERS.                         
>> YEAH SO AGAIN I DON'T THINK  

02:18:34.339 --> 02:18:35.539
POWERS.                         
>> YEAH SO AGAIN I DON'T THINK  
WE NEED TO SOLVE IT IN THE PLAN 

02:18:35.541 --> 02:18:36.272
>> YEAH SO AGAIN I DON'T THINK  
WE NEED TO SOLVE IT IN THE PLAN 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE 

02:18:36.274 --> 02:18:38.642
WE NEED TO SOLVE IT IN THE PLAN 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
THERE ARE CHALLENGES HERE AND   

02:18:38.644 --> 02:18:42.446
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
THERE ARE CHALLENGES HERE AND   
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THEM AND   

02:18:42.448 --> 02:18:43.180
THERE ARE CHALLENGES HERE AND   
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THEM AND   
COME UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS TO   

02:18:43.182 --> 02:18:43.980
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THEM AND   
COME UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS TO   
GET TO A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL    

02:18:43.982 --> 02:18:47.083
COME UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS TO   
GET TO A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL    
RESULT AND NOT JUST ANNOUNCE    

02:18:47.085 --> 02:18:47.984
GET TO A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL    
RESULT AND NOT JUST ANNOUNCE    
WELL IF YOU HAD SOLAR AND SO ON 

02:18:47.986 --> 02:18:50.620
RESULT AND NOT JUST ANNOUNCE    
WELL IF YOU HAD SOLAR AND SO ON 
BUT NEXT YOU LOST IT.           

02:18:50.622 --> 02:18:51.688
WELL IF YOU HAD SOLAR AND SO ON 
BUT NEXT YOU LOST IT.           
TOO BAD I THINK THAT'S NOT A    

02:18:51.690 --> 02:18:52.155
BUT NEXT YOU LOST IT.           
TOO BAD I THINK THAT'S NOT A    
GOOD TO APPROACH.               

02:18:52.157 --> 02:18:54.757
TOO BAD I THINK THAT'S NOT A    
GOOD TO APPROACH.               
SURE COMMISSIONER RATHER BE I'D 

02:18:54.759 --> 02:18:55.492
GOOD TO APPROACH.               
SURE COMMISSIONER RATHER BE I'D 
ALSO LIKE IT SORT OF BECAUSE I  

02:18:55.494 --> 02:18:58.595
SURE COMMISSIONER RATHER BE I'D 
ALSO LIKE IT SORT OF BECAUSE I  
AM IN THAT POSITION AH WE LOST  

02:18:58.597 --> 02:18:59.395
ALSO LIKE IT SORT OF BECAUSE I  
AM IN THAT POSITION AH WE LOST  
A TREE AND NOW SUDDENLY HAVE    

02:18:59.397 --> 02:19:00.130
AM IN THAT POSITION AH WE LOST  
A TREE AND NOW SUDDENLY HAVE    
THE ABILITY TO PUT SO WELL      

02:19:00.132 --> 02:19:01.297
A TREE AND NOW SUDDENLY HAVE    
THE ABILITY TO PUT SO WELL      
BECAUSE BEFORE WE DID BECAUSE   

02:19:01.299 --> 02:19:02.199
THE ABILITY TO PUT SO WELL      
BECAUSE BEFORE WE DID BECAUSE   
WE HAD A BIG TREE THERE AND     

02:19:02.201 --> 02:19:03.132
BECAUSE BEFORE WE DID BECAUSE   
WE HAD A BIG TREE THERE AND     
IT'S TAKING THEM A LOT OF TIME  

02:19:03.134 --> 02:19:05.669
WE HAD A BIG TREE THERE AND     
IT'S TAKING THEM A LOT OF TIME  
TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE ALL    

02:19:05.671 --> 02:19:06.336
IT'S TAKING THEM A LOT OF TIME  
TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE ALL    
THE PREVIOUS HUNDRED YEARS      

02:19:06.338 --> 02:19:09.539
TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE ALL    
THE PREVIOUS HUNDRED YEARS      
OF OUR HOUSE HAD SO OR HAD THE  

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:12.976
THE PREVIOUS HUNDRED YEARS      
OF OUR HOUSE HAD SO OR HAD THE  
TREE SO BUT AND I AGREE WITH WE 

02:19:12.978 --> 02:19:16.446
OF OUR HOUSE HAD SO OR HAD THE  
TREE SO BUT AND I AGREE WITH WE 
SHOULDN'T JUST SAY YOU KNOW     

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:20.316
TREE SO BUT AND I AGREE WITH WE 
SHOULDN'T JUST SAY YOU KNOW     
TOUGH BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE  

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:21.418
SHOULDN'T JUST SAY YOU KNOW     
TOUGH BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE  
NEED I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A  

02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:24.488
TOUGH BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE  
NEED I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A  
WAY OF BEING ALSO REALISTIC     

02:19:24.490 --> 02:19:25.222
NEED I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A  
WAY OF BEING ALSO REALISTIC     
THAT PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T NEED 

02:19:25.224 --> 02:19:28.424
WAY OF BEING ALSO REALISTIC     
THAT PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T NEED 
TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR SOLAR IF   

02:19:28.426 --> 02:19:29.125
THAT PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T NEED 
TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR SOLAR IF   
THERE'S A THIRTY FIVE FOOT      

02:19:29.127 --> 02:19:32.795
TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR SOLAR IF   
THERE'S A THIRTY FIVE FOOT      
BUILDING NEXT TO THEM BECAUSE   

02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:33.530
THERE'S A THIRTY FIVE FOOT      
BUILDING NEXT TO THEM BECAUSE   
NOW THAT I USED TO THINK THAT   

02:19:33.532 --> 02:19:36.533
BUILDING NEXT TO THEM BECAUSE   
NOW THAT I USED TO THINK THAT   
BUT NOW THAT I LIVE NEAR 35     

02:19:36.535 --> 02:19:37.234
NOW THAT I USED TO THINK THAT   
BUT NOW THAT I LIVE NEAR 35     
FOOT BUILDINGS OR 40 FOOT       

02:19:37.236 --> 02:19:40.537
BUT NOW THAT I LIVE NEAR 35

ALIGNMENT?                      
WELL, FOR THOSE I GET THE       

02:26:09.794 --> 02:26:12.628
ALIGNMENT?                      
WELL, FOR THOSE I GET THE       
BENEFIT REITERATING WHAT WE     

02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:13.396
WELL, FOR THOSE I GET THE       
BENEFIT REITERATING WHAT WE     
HEARD FROM FOLKS AND WHAT THEIR 

02:26:13.398 --> 02:26:15.965
BENEFIT REITERATING WHAT WE     
HEARD FROM FOLKS AND WHAT THEIR 
CONCERNS ARE AND WE HAVE HEARD  

02:26:15.967 --> 02:26:16.633
HEARD FROM FOLKS AND WHAT THEIR 
CONCERNS ARE AND WE HAVE HEARD  
PEOPLE MAKE COMMENTS THAT       

02:26:16.635 --> 02:26:19.101
CONCERNS ARE AND WE HAVE HEARD  
PEOPLE MAKE COMMENTS THAT       
THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE 

02:26:19.103 --> 02:26:19.902
PEOPLE MAKE COMMENTS THAT       
THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING AND   

02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:20.770
THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING AND   
THAT IF WE HAD MORE DEVELOPMENT 

02:26:20.772 --> 02:26:23.974
INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING AND   
THAT IF WE HAD MORE DEVELOPMENT 
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE THOSE  

02:26:23.976 --> 02:26:30.180
THAT IF WE HAD MORE DEVELOPMENT 
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE THOSE  
FAILURES AND THAT'S             

02:26:44.462 --> 02:26:46.429
                    NOT AN      
UNREASONABLE CONCERN BECAUSE    
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING   

02:26:46.431 --> 02:26:52.669
UNREASONABLE CONCERN BECAUSE    
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING   
THAT A LOT OF IT IS BEYOND      

02:27:04.315 --> 02:27:05.916
                           ITS  
DESIGN LIFETIME.                
WE JUST FINISHED THE CITY JUST  

02:27:05.918 --> 02:27:06.583
DESIGN LIFETIME.                
WE JUST FINISHED THE CITY JUST  
FINISHED A MAJOR PIPE REHAB     

02:27:06.585 --> 02:27:07.450
WE JUST FINISHED THE CITY JUST  
FINISHED A MAJOR PIPE REHAB     
PROJECT AT THE END OF MY STREET 

02:27:07.452 --> 02:27:08.184
FINISHED A MAJOR PIPE REHAB     
PROJECT AT THE END OF MY STREET 
I TOOK A ONE TOOK A WHILE IT    

02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:09.052
PROJECT AT THE END OF MY STREET 
I TOOK A ONE TOOK A WHILE IT    
WAS PRETTY AMAZING TO WATCH BUT 

02:27:09.054 --> 02:27:09.785
I TOOK A ONE TOOK A WHILE IT    
WAS PRETTY AMAZING TO WATCH BUT 
I THINK IT'S A CASE THAT HAPPY  

02:27:09.787 --> 02:27:10.520
WAS PRETTY AMAZING TO WATCH BUT 
I THINK IT'S A CASE THAT HAPPY  
NEW DEVELOPMENT TAKING PLACE    

02:27:10.522 --> 02:27:11.054
I THINK IT'S A CASE THAT HAPPY  
NEW DEVELOPMENT TAKING PLACE    
ACTUALLY CREATES THE            

02:27:11.056 --> 02:27:11.721
NEW DEVELOPMENT TAKING PLACE    
ACTUALLY CREATES THE            
OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN AND FIX    

02:27:11.723 --> 02:27:12.522
ACTUALLY CREATES THE            
OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN AND FIX    
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS   

02:27:12.524 --> 02:27:13.123
OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN AND FIX    
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS   
TO GET FIXED AND HAVING MORE    

02:27:13.125 --> 02:27:13.990
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS   
TO GET FIXED AND HAVING MORE    
PEOPLE IN THE CITY HELPS SPREAD 

02:27:13.992 --> 02:27:14.657
TO GET FIXED AND HAVING MORE    
PEOPLE IN THE CITY HELPS SPREAD 
THE COST THAT OUT INSTEAD       

02:27:14.659 --> 02:27:15.225
PEOPLE IN THE CITY HELPS SPREAD 
THE COST THAT OUT INSTEAD       
OF FOCUSING ON CURRENT THE      

02:27:15.227 --> 02:27:15.959
THE COST THAT OUT INSTEAD       
OF FOCUSING ON CURRENT THE      
CURRENT RESIDENTS AND I'M       

02:27:15.961 --> 02:27:16.692
OF FOCUSING ON CURRENT THE      
CURRENT RESIDENTS AND I'M       
AFRAID THAT KIND OF LOGIC GETS  

02:27:16.694 --> 02:27:17.360
CURRENT RESIDENTS AND I'M       
AFRAID THAT KIND OF LOGIC GETS  
LOST SO AND PEOPLE MIGHT HONE   

02:27:17.362 --> 02:27:18.160
AFRAID THAT KIND OF LOGIC GETS  
LOST SO AND PEOPLE MIGHT HONE   
IN ON SEE THERE'S A CONCERN WE  

02:27:18.162 --> 02:27:18.828
LOST SO AND PEOPLE MIGHT HONE   
IN ON SEE THERE'S A CONCERN WE  
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

IN ON SEE THERE'S A CONCERN WE  
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE   
TO DEAL WITH IT SO I DON'T I    

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:20.497
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE   
TO DEAL WITH IT SO I DON'T I    
DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO HAVE 

02:27:20.499 --> 02:27:20.964
TO DEAL WITH IT SO I DON'T I    
DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO HAVE 
LIKE A POINT BY POINT           

02:27:20.966 --> 02:27:21.764
DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO HAVE 
LIKE A POINT BY POINT           
REFUTATION OF THINGS THAT MAYBE 

02:27:21.766 --> 02:27:22.232
LIKE A POINT BY POINT           
REFUTATION OF THINGS THAT MAYBE 
GOOD CONCERNS.

THAT HAVING NEW DEVELOPMENT     

02:27:25.937 --> 02:27:26.669
ASK THEM TO SPEAK TO THIS IDEA  
THAT HAVING NEW DEVELOPMENT     
MIGHT CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

02:27:26.671 --> 02:27:27.203
THAT HAVING NEW DEVELOPMENT     
MIGHT CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE          

02:27:27.205 --> 02:27:27.670
MIGHT CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE          
UPGRADES?                       

02:27:27.672 --> 02:27:29.272

TRUE ASSERTION TO MAKE AND TO   

02:27:33.111 --> 02:27:33.810
EFFICIENTLY IF THAT'S A REALLY  
TRUE ASSERTION TO MAKE AND TO   
MAKE SURE THAT CONCEPT IS       

02:27:33.812 --> 02:27:36.912
TRUE ASSERTION TO MAKE AND TO   
MAKE SURE THAT CONCEPT IS       
GETTING ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY IN

MAKE SURE THAT CONCEPT IS       
GETTING ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY IN 
THEIR COMMENTS?                 

02:27:37.316 --> 02:27:38.048
GETTING ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY IN 
THEIR COMMENTS?                 
THAT WAS MY REQUEST.

OK, I MIGHT I MIGHT TURN TO     
YOU, BRETT, BECAUSE THERE'S I   
MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS.     

02:27:44.456 --> 02:27:47.557
YOU, BRETT, BECAUSE THERE'S I   
MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS.     
ONE, THEY HAVE STARTED THEIR    

02:27:47.559 --> 02:27:48.558
MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS.     
ONE, THEY HAVE STARTED THEIR    
STUDIES AFTER SO WE ARE STILL   

02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:51.894
ONE, THEY HAVE STARTED THEIR    
STUDIES AFTER SO WE ARE STILL   
WAITING I THINK VERY SOON WE    

02:27:51.896 --> 02:27:52.829
STUDIES AFTER SO WE ARE STILL   
WAITING I THINK VERY SOON WE    
ARE GOING TO KNOW A LOT MORE    

02:27:52.831 --> 02:27:55.598
WAITING I THINK VERY SOON WE    
ARE GOING TO KNOW A LOT MORE    
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT KIND         

02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:56.465
ARE GOING TO KNOW A LOT MORE    
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT KIND         
OF CONSTRAINTS WE DO HAVE.      

02:27:56.467 --> 02:27:59.269
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT KIND         
OF CONSTRAINTS WE DO HAVE.      
I THINK THERE COULD BE MAPS AND 

02:27:59.271 --> 02:27:59.935
OF CONSTRAINTS WE DO HAVE.      
I THINK THERE COULD BE MAPS AND 
PROJECTIONS ABOUT HOW           

02:27:59.937 --> 02:28:02.939
I THINK THERE COULD BE MAPS AND 
PROJECTIONS ABOUT HOW           
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT LIMIT SOME 

02:28:02.941 --> 02:28:03.406
PROJECTIONS ABOUT HOW           
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT LIMIT SOME 
OF OUR VISION.                  

02:28:03.408 --> 02:28:04.474
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT LIMIT SOME 
OF OUR VISION.                  
WE CAN CONTINUE ON WITH OUR     

02:28:04.476 --> 02:28:07.443
OF OUR VISION.                  
WE CAN CONTINUE ON WITH OUR     
VISION BUT THERE ARE GOING TO   

02:28:07.445 --> 02:28:07.977
WE CAN CONTINUE ON WITH OUR     
VISION BUT THERE ARE GOING TO   
BE SOME LIMITS.                 

02:28:07.979 --> 02:28:10.579
VISION BUT THERE ARE GOING TO   
BE SOME LIMITS.                 
ALONG WITH THAT THOUGH, THERE'S 

02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:11.414
BE SOME LIMITS.                 
ALONG WITH THAT THOUGH, THERE'S 
SOME LEGAL GRAY AREAS RIGHT     

02:28:11.416 --> 02:28:14.950
ALONG WITH THAT THOUGH, THERE'S 
SOME LEGAL GRAY AREAS RIGHT     
ABOUT LIKE HOW PEOPLE CAN HOW   

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:15.885
SOME LEGAL GRAY AREAS RIGHT     
ABOUT LIKE HOW PEOPLE CAN HOW   
THE NEW DEVELOPMENT CAN BE      

02:28:15.887 --> 02:28:19.355
ABOUT LIKE HOW PEOPLE CAN HOW   
THE NEW DEVELOPMENT CAN BE      
FUNDED WHICH I'M GOING TO LET   

02:28:19.357 --> 02:28:20.090
THE NEW DEVELOPMENT CAN BE      
FUNDED WHICH I'M GOING TO LET   
YOU TALK TO BECAUSE I THINK     

02:28:20.092 --> 02:28:22.158
FUNDED WHICH I'M GOING TO LET   
YOU TALK TO BECAUSE I THINK     
THIS IS GETTING AT THIS IS      

02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:22.992
YOU TALK TO BECAUSE I THINK     
THIS IS GETTING AT THIS IS      
GETTING AT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE    

02:28:22.994 --> 02:28:23.292
THIS IS GETTING AT THIS IS      
GETTING AT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE    
TALKING.                        

02:28:23.294 --> 02:28:25.928
GETTING AT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE    
TALKING.                        
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ALL THE 

02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:26.863
TALKING.                        
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ALL THE 
NEW YOU KNOW, I'M NOT TALKING   

02:28:26.865 --> 02:28:27.397
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ALL THE 
NEW YOU KNOW, I'M NOT TALKING   
ABOUT IMPACT FEES.              

02:28:27.399 --> 02:28:29.598
NEW YOU KNOW, I'M NOT TALKING   
ABOUT IMPACT FEES.              
I'M TALKING A BIT MORE          

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:29.999
ABOUT IMPACT FEES.              
I'M TALKING A BIT MORE          
GENERICALLY.                    

02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:30.733
I'M TALKING A BIT MORE          
GENERICALLY.                    
HAVING MORE OF A POPULATION     

02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:31.334
GENERICALLY.                    
HAVING MORE OF A POPULATION     
MEANS THERE'S MORE FOLKS TO     

02:28:31.336 --> 02:28:33.369
HAVING MORE OF A POPULATION     
MEANS THERE'S MORE FOLKS TO     
HELP COVER THE COST.            

02:28:33.371 --> 02:28:33.737
MEANS THERE'S MORE FOLKS TO     
HELP COVER THE COST.            
YES.                            

02:28:33.739 --> 02:28:34.270
HELP COVER THE COST.            
YES.                            
INFRASTRUCTURE.                 

02:28:34.272 --> 02:28:34.670
YES.                            
INFRASTRUCTURE.                 
OH YEAH.                        

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:37.107
INFRASTRUCTURE.                 
OH YEAH.                        
SO THIS IS MORE ODDLY JUST MORE 

02:28:37.109 --> 02:28:37.373
OH YEAH.                        
SO THIS IS MORE ODDLY JUST MORE 
BROADLY.                        

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:38.375
SO THIS IS MORE ODDLY JUST MORE 
BROADLY.                        
BUT THE POINT IS THAT THERE'S A 

02:28:38.377 --> 02:28:40.910
BROADLY.                        
BUT THE POINT IS THAT THERE'S A 
LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S    

02:28:40.912 --> 02:28:41.711
BUT THE POINT IS THAT THERE'S A 
LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S    
GOING TO HAVE TO GET REPLACED.  

02:28:41.713 --> 02:28:41.978
LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S    
GOING TO HAVE TO GET REPLACED.  
YES.                            

02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:45.015
GOING TO HAVE TO GET REPLACED.  
YES.                            
NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE IT'S A   

02:28:45.017 --> 02:28:45.815
YES.                            
NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE IT'S A   
LOT OF IT'S BEYOND ITS DESIGN   

02:28:45.817 --> 02:28:46.149
NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE IT'S A   
LOT OF IT'S BEYOND ITS DESIGN   
LIFETIME.                       

02:28:46.151 --> 02:28:47.684
LOT OF IT'S BEYOND ITS DESIGN   
LIFETIME.                       
THE FACT THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT   

02:28:47.686 --> 02:28:48.784
LIFETIME.                       
THE FACT THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT   
IS COMING IN MIGHT AFFECT THE   

02:28:48.786 --> 02:28:51.954
THE FACT THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT   
IS COMING IN MIGHT AFFECT THE   
TIMING OF WHEN THAT HAPPENS.    

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:53.022
IS COMING IN MIGHT AFFECT THE   
TIMING OF WHEN THAT HAPPENS.    
BUT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO    

02:28:53.024 --> 02:28:53.690
TIMING OF WHEN THAT HAPPENS.    
BUT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO    
SAY BECAUSE IT'S OLD AND IT'S   

02:28:53.692 --> 02:28:55.658
BUT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO    
SAY BECAUSE IT'S OLD AND IT'S   
FAILING WE SHOULDN'T KNOW ANY   

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:56.459
SAY BECAUSE IT'S OLD AND IT'S   
FAILING WE SHOULDN'T KNOW ANY   
MORE DEVELOPMENT WILL STOP AND  

02:28:56.461 --> 02:28:57.293
FAILING WE SHOULDN'T KNOW ANY   
MORE DEVELOPMENT WILL STOP AND  
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT POINT  

02:28:57.295 --> 02:29:00.129
MORE DEVELOPMENT WILL STOP AND  
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT POINT  
DOESN'T GET LOST IN THE         

02:29:00.131 --> 02:29:00.864
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT POINT  
DOESN'T GET LOST IN THE         
RATIONALE THAT'S PROVIDED AND I 

02:29:00.866 --> 02:29:03.933
DOESN'T GET LOST IN THE         
RATIONALE THAT'S PROVIDED AND I 
CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE         

02:29:03.935 --> 02:29:04.200
RATIONALE THAT'S PROVIDED AND I 
CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE         
OF THAT.                        

02:29:04.202 --> 02:29:05.168
CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE         
OF THAT.                        
SO THE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GOING 

02:29:05.170 --> 02:29:08.304
OF THAT.                        
SO THE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GOING 
ON ACROSS THE STREET FROM OUR   

02:29:08.306 --> 02:29:10.873
SO THE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GOING 
ON ACROSS THE STREET FROM OUR   
CHURCH HAS RESULTED IN ALL      

02:29:10.875 --> 02:29:11.541
ON ACROSS THE STREET FROM OUR   
CHURCH HAS RESULTED IN ALL      
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEING     

02:29:11.543 --> 02:29:11.875
CHURCH HAS RESULTED IN ALL      
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEING     
UPGRADED.                       

02:29:11.877 --> 02:29:15.077
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEING     
UPGRADED.                       
SO WE WERE EFFECTIVELY AT THE   

02:29:15.079 --> 02:29:16.045
UPGRADED.                       
SO WE WERE EFFECTIVELY AT THE   
END OF A DIRTY LINE IS HOW I    

02:29:16.047 --> 02:29:18.881
SO WE WERE EFFECTIVELY AT THE   
END OF A DIRTY LINE IS HOW I    
WOULD DESCRIBE IT FROM DETI.    

02:29:18.883 --> 02:29:19.882
END OF A DIRTY LINE IS HOW I    
WOULD DESCRIBE IT FROM DETI.    
SO IF THE WIND BLEW WE LOST     

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:23.119
WOULD DESCRIBE IT FROM DETI.    
SO IF THE WIND BLEW WE LOST     
POWER WILL NOW BECAUSE OF THE   

02:29:23.121 --> 02:29:25.922
SO IF THE WIND BLEW WE LOST     
POWER WILL NOW BECAUSE OF THE   
TWO NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE ALL    

02:29:25.924 --> 02:29:26.389
POWER WILL NOW BECAUSE OF THE   
TWO NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE ALL    
OF OUR ELECTRICAL               

02:29:26.391 --> 02:29:29.625
TWO NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE ALL    
OF OUR ELECTRICAL               
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT UPDATED THE 

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:30.393
OF OUR ELECTRICAL               
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT UPDATED THE 
ROAD GOT UPDATED THE WATER      

02:29:30.395 --> 02:29:34.063
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT UPDATED THE 
ROAD GOT UPDATED THE WATER      
MAINS GOT UPDATED AND THAT'S    

02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:34.831
ROAD GOT UPDATED THE WATER      
MAINS GOT UPDATED AND THAT'S    
BECAUSE THERE'S BOTH AFFORDABLE 

02:29:34.833 --> 02:29:37.767
MAINS GOT UPDATED AND THAT'S    
BECAUSE THERE'S BOTH AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING THAT'S COMING IN AND    

02:29:37.769 --> 02:29:38.367
BECAUSE THERE'S BOTH AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING THAT'S COMING IN AND    
MARKET RATE HOUSING.            

02:29:38.369 --> 02:29:39.402
HOUSING THAT'S COMING IN AND    
MARKET RATE HOUSING.            
SO IT'S EXACTLY TO YOUR POINT   

02:29:39.404 --> 02:29:42.271
MARKET RATE HOUSING.            
SO IT'S EXACTLY TO YOUR POINT   
THAT BECAUSE NEW DEVELOPMENT IS 

02:29:42.273 --> 02:29:43.072
SO IT'S EXACTLY TO YOUR POINT   
THAT BECAUSE NEW DEVELOPMENT IS 
COMING IN, THIS INFRASTRUCTURE  

02:29:43.074 --> 02:29:46.209
THAT BECAUSE NEW DEVELOPMENT IS 
COMING IN, THIS INFRASTRUCTURE  
IS IMPROVING AND THE WHOLE      

02:29:46.211 --> 02:29:47.009
COMING IN, THIS INFRASTRUCTURE  
IS IMPROVING AND THE WHOLE      
NEIGHBORHOOD NOT JUST OUR SITE  

02:29:47.011 --> 02:29:50.146
IS IMPROVING AND THE WHOLE      
NEIGHBORHOOD NOT JUST OUR SITE  
BENEFITS FROM IT AND THAT'S     

02:29:50.148 --> 02:29:50.880
NEIGHBORHOOD NOT JUST OUR SITE  
BENEFITS FROM IT AND THAT'S     
THOSE PROFESSOR LEVINE MADE THE 

02:29:50.882 --> 02:29:53.817
BENEFITS FROM IT AND THAT'S     
THOSE PROFESSOR LEVINE MADE THE 
COMMENT THE INFRASTRUCTURE      

02:29:53.819 --> 02:29:54.884
THOSE PROFESSOR LEVINE MADE THE 
COMMENT THE INFRASTRUCTURE      
DRIVE THE PLAN, LET THE PLAN

DRIVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND    
AND THAT WAS MY QUOTE PAGE      

02:29:58.623 --> 02:30:00.923
DRIVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND    
AND THAT WAS MY QUOTE PAGE      
EIGHTY TWO SO WE COULD JUMP     

02:30:00.925 --> 02:30:02.091
AND THAT WAS MY QUOTE PAGE      
EIGHTY TWO SO WE COULD JUMP     
RIGHT BACK TO THAT I THINK FROM 

02:30:02.093 --> 02:30:05.261
EIGHTY TWO SO WE COULD JUMP     
RIGHT BACK TO THAT I THINK FROM 
WHAT COMMISSIONER GORDON JUST

WHAT COMMISSIONER GORDON JUST   
SAID.

FORTUNATE THAT A LOT OF THIS    
INTEREST DEEP DOVE              
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IS    

02:30:38.530 --> 02:30:39.329
INTEREST DEEP DOVE              
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IS

02:30:57.114 --> 02:30:57.947
COMMISSIONER WHICH WAS TALKING  
ABOUT ON A LOCAL SCALE.         
WE HAVE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE     

02:30:57.949 --> 02:31:01.551
ABOUT ON A LOCAL SCALE.         
WE HAVE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE     
LIMITATIONS THAT I THINK WILL   

02:31:01.553 --> 02:31:02.152
WE HAVE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE     
LIMITATIONS THAT I THINK WILL   
BE IDENTIFIED THAT WILL         

02:31:02.154 --> 02:31:05.588
LIMITATIONS THAT I THINK WILL   
BE IDENTIFIED THAT WILL         
POTENTIALLY LIMIT GROWTH IN THE 

02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:09.392
BE IDENTIFIED THAT WILL         
POTENTIALLY LIMIT GROWTH IN THE 
CITY UNLESS WE INVEST AND       

02:31:09.394 --> 02:31:12.395
POTENTIALLY LIMIT GROWTH IN THE

RESOLVE IT OR BY GEOGRAPHY.     

02:31:12.397 --> 02:31:16.299
CITY UNLESS WE INVEST AND       
RESOLVE IT OR BY GEOGRAPHY.     
SO LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO  

02:31:16.301 --> 02:31:16.632
RESOLVE IT OR BY GEOGRAPHY.     
SO LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO  
THAT.                           

02:31:16.634 --> 02:31:17.600
SO LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO  
THAT.                           
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK

THAT.                           
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK  
THAT WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IN 

02:31:18.369 --> 02:31:20.503
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK  
THAT WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IN 
THE PLAN IS JUST MAKING SURE    

02:31:20.505 --> 02:31:21.237
THAT WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IN 
THE PLAN IS JUST MAKING SURE    
THAT WE'RE BEING TRANSPARENT,   

02:31:21.239 --> 02:31:21.904
THE PLAN IS JUST MAKING SURE    
THAT WE'RE BEING TRANSPARENT,   
HONEST ABOUT CALIBRATING OUR

SO THAT WE'RE BEING MINDFUL     

02:31:29.046 --> 02:31:31.280
YOU WILL, OF THAT DEVELOPMENT   
SO THAT WE'RE BEING MINDFUL     
OF THAT RIGHT.                  

02:31:31.282 --> 02:31:32.348
SO THAT WE'RE BEING MINDFUL     
OF THAT RIGHT.                  
WE DON'T OUR GOAL I AGREE OUR

GOAL SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED   
BY INFRASTRUCTURE.              
HOWEVER, OUR GOAL HAS TO BE     

02:31:38.923 --> 02:31:39.788

THOUGH I I THINK THERE NEEDS TO 
BE SOME MORE DISCUSSION IN IN   
THE RATIONALE THAT TALKS ABOUT

BE SOME MORE DISCUSSION IN IN   
THE RATIONALE THAT TALKS ABOUT  
THOSE TRADEOFFS AND RECOGNIZES  

02:59:07.237 --> 02:59:10.437
THE RATIONALE THAT TALKS ABOUT  
THOSE TRADEOFFS AND RECOGNIZES  
THEM AND ACKNOWLEDGES THEM AND  

02:59:10.439 --> 02:59:14.842
THOSE TRADEOFFS AND RECOGNIZES  
THEM AND ACKNOWLEDGES THEM AND  
THEN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

THEM AND ACKNOWLEDGES THEM AND  
THEN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE  
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION IS     

02:59:15.478 --> 02:59:17.946
THEN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE  
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION IS     
DOING BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE   

02:59:17.948 --> 02:59:18.613
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION IS     
DOING BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE   
TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS TRADE OFF  

02:59:18.615 --> 02:59:20.982
DOING BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE   
TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS TRADE OFF  
IN A MEANINGFUL WAY BECAUSE     

02:59:20.984 --> 02:59:21.916
TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS TRADE OFF  
IN A MEANINGFUL WAY BECAUSE     
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE AND I     

02:59:21.918 --> 02:59:22.717
IN A MEANINGFUL WAY BECAUSE     
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE AND I     
WOULD HATE FOR THE WHOLE CITY   

02:59:22.719 --> 02:59:25.085
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE AND I     
WOULD HATE FOR THE WHOLE CITY   
TO BE COMPLETELY PAVED OVER     

02:59:25.087 --> 02:59:25.854
WOULD HATE FOR THE WHOLE CITY   
TO BE COMPLETELY PAVED OVER     
WITH CONCRETE BUT I THINK WE    

02:59:25.856 --> 02:59:29.657
TO BE COMPLETELY PAVED OVER     
WITH CONCRETE BUT I THINK WE    
CAN IDENTIFY AND STILL DO A LOT 

02:59:29.659 --> 02:59:30.391
WITH CONCRETE BUT I THINK WE    
CAN IDENTIFY AND STILL DO A LOT 
OF GREEN THINGS AT THE SAME     

02:59:30.393 --> 02:59:31.158
CAN IDENTIFY AND STILL DO A LOT 
OF GREEN THINGS AT THE SAME     
TIME AND THAT MEANS A LOT       

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:32.560
OF GREEN THINGS AT THE SAME     
TIME AND THAT MEANS A LOT       
OF REALLY GOOD CREATIVE URBAN

HOW MUCH DETAIL DO WE GET IN    
THAT IN A PLAN?                 
I DON'T THINK A LOT BUT WE NEED

THAT IN A PLAN?                 
I DON'T THINK A LOT BUT WE NEED

03:00:49.439 --> 03:00:52.673
THAT HAVE RESTORED THEIR TREE   
COVER AND THE WAY THEY HAVE     
DONE THAT IS BY REMOVING        

03:00:52.675 --> 03:00:56.077
COVER AND THE WAY THEY HAVE     
DONE THAT IS BY REMOVING

03:01:20.136 --> 03:01:23.337
THANK YOU COUNCIL MEMBER DISH   
ON THE LOSS AND GROWTH OF TREE  
COVERAGE IN CITIES AND SO YOU   

03:01:23.339 --> 03:01:24.171
ON THE LOSS AND GROWTH OF TREE  
COVERAGE IN CITIES AND SO YOU   
CAN ACTUALLY GO PUT IN ANN      

03:01:24.173 --> 03:01:27.408
COVERAGE IN CITIES AND SO YOU   
CAN ACTUALLY GO PUT IN ANN      
ARBOR AND OVER FIFTY YEARS YOU  

03:01:27.410 --> 03:01:28.342
CAN ACTUALLY GO PUT IN ANN      
ARBOR AND OVER FIFTY YEARS YOU  
CAN SEE HOW THE THE TREE        

03:01:28.344 --> 03:01:30.978
ARBOR AND OVER FIFTY YEARS YOU  
CAN SEE HOW THE THE TREE        
COVERAGE HAS CHANGED AND THEN   

03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:35.182
CAN SEE HOW THE THE TREE        
COVERAGE HAS CHANGED AND THEN   
TODAY I SAW THAT IN PROBABLY IN 

03:01:35.184 --> 03:01:38.952
COVERAGE HAS CHANGED AND THEN   
TODAY I SAW THAT IN PROBABLY IN 
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST SOME ONE  

03:01:38.954 --> 03:01:39.720
TODAY I SAW THAT IN PROBABLY IN 
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST SOME ONE  
AGAIN THIS WOULD BE A PRECEDENT 

03:01:39.722 --> 03:01:42.756
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST SOME ONE  
AGAIN THIS WOULD BE A PRECEDENT 
THEY SORT SHOWED ALL OF THE     

03:01:42.758 --> 03:01:45.292
AGAIN THIS WOULD BE A PRECEDENT 
THEY SORT SHOWED ALL OF THE     
TREES AND THEN THEY IDENTIFIED  

03:01:45.294 --> 03:01:46.527
THEY SORT SHOWED ALL OF THE     
TREES AND THEN THEY IDENTIFIED  
THE LOSS OF TREES AS A RESULT   

03:01:46.529 --> 03:01:50.364
TREES AND THEN THEY IDENTIFIED  
THE LOSS OF TREES AS A RESULT   
OF DEVELOPMENT.                 

03:01:50.366 --> 03:01:51.466
THE LOSS OF TREES AS A RESULT   
OF DEVELOPMENT.                 
SO IF THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED    

03:01:51.468 --> 03:01:54.468
OF DEVELOPMENT.                 
SO IF THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED    
TREES ON THE INFO GRAPHIC,      

03:01:54.470 --> 03:01:55.136
SO IF THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED    
TREES ON THE INFO GRAPHIC,      
THERE WERE ONLY THREE TREES     

03:01:55.138 --> 03:01:57.538
TREES ON THE INFO GRAPHIC,      
THERE WERE ONLY THREE TREES     
THAT WERE LOST BECAUSE          

03:01:57.540 --> 03:01:57.939
THERE WERE ONLY THREE TREES     
THAT WERE LOST BECAUSE          
OF DEVELOPMENT.                 

03:01:57.941 --> 03:01:58.873
THAT WERE LOST BECAUSE          
OF DEVELOPMENT.                 
AND SO I THINK TO COMMISSIONER  

03:01:58.875 --> 03:02:02.342
OF DEVELOPMENT.                 
AND SO I THINK TO COMMISSIONER  
NORTON'S POINT, A LOT OF PEOPLE 

03:02:02.344 --> 03:02:06.213
AND SO I THINK TO COMMISSIONER  
NORTON'S POINT, A LOT OF PEOPLE 
HAVE A PERCEPTION THAT A LOT    

03:02:06.215 --> 03:02:09.650
NORTON'S POINT, A LOT OF PEOPLE 
HAVE A PERCEPTION THAT A LOT    
OF TREE COVERAGE IS GOING AWAY  

03:02:09.652 --> 03:02:10.351
HAVE A PERCEPTION THAT A LOT    
OF TREE COVERAGE IS GOING AWAY  
BUT IT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE  

03:02:10.353 --> 03:02:11.018
OF TREE COVERAGE IS GOING AWAY  
BUT IT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE  
INVESTMENTS THAT THE CITY       

03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:13.488
BUT IT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE  
INVESTMENTS THAT THE CITY       
ALREADY.                        

03:02:13.490 --> 03:02:14.721
INVESTMENTS THAT THE CITY       
ALREADY.                        
SO WE HAVE A TREE FUND THAT     

03:02:14.723 --> 03:02:17.492
ALREADY.                        
SO WE HAVE A TREE FUND THAT     
PLANTS CITY TREES.              

03:02:17.494 --> 03:02:18.426
SO WE HAVE A TREE FUND THAT     
PLANTS CITY TREES.              
THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY    

03:02:18.428 --> 03:02:22.162
PLANTS CITY TREES.              
THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY    
GIVES AWAY I THINK UP TO 10000  

03:02:22.164 --> 03:02:24.865
THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY    
GIVES AWAY I THINK UP TO 10000  
TREE SAPLINGS A YEAR AND I      

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:25.632
GIVES AWAY I THINK UP TO 10000  
TREE SAPLINGS A YEAR AND I      
THINK YOU COULD JUST REQUEST    

03:02:25.634 --> 03:02:29.270
TREE SAPLINGS A YEAR AND I      
THINK YOU COULD JUST REQUEST    
TREES TOO IF YOU SORT OF WANT.  

03:02:29.272 --> 03:02:32.673
THINK YOU COULD JUST REQUEST    
TREES TOO IF YOU SORT OF WANT.  
SO I THINK ALL OF THAT CAN      

03:02:32.675 --> 03:02:36.510
TREES TOO IF YOU SORT OF WANT.  
SO I THINK ALL OF THAT CAN      
COUNTERACT A NARRATIVE THAT WE  

03:02:36.512 --> 03:02:39.446
SO I THINK ALL OF THAT CAN      
COUNTERACT A NARRATIVE THAT WE  
ARE PAVING OVER OUR CITY THAT   

03:02:39.448 --> 03:02:40.414
COUNTERACT A NARRATIVE THAT WE  
ARE PAVING OVER OUR CITY THAT   
IF WE ARE REALLY CONCERNED      

03:02:40.416 --> 03:02:43.684
ARE PAVING OVER OUR CITY THAT   
IF WE ARE REALLY CONCERNED      
ABOUT THE LOSS OF TREE COVERAGE 

03:02:43.686 --> 03:02:47.721
IF WE ARE REALLY CONCERNED      
ABOUT THE LOSS OF TREE COVERAGE 
IN THE URBAN SPACE THEN I WOULD 

03:02:47.723 --> 03:02:48.422

WE MIGHT WANT TO PUT IN THE

LAWYERS WHICH IS THAT WE PLANT  
TREES FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
SO WE USE OUR STORMWATER        

03:06:04.887 --> 03:06:08.288
TREES FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
SO WE USE OUR STORMWATER

ALL OF THE TIME AT THE TABLE IS 

03:07:22.731 --> 03:07:25.532
TO SAY BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY THIS  
ALL OF THE TIME AT THE TABLE IS 
THERE ARE NO RULES AND          

03:07:25.534 --> 03:07:26.267
ALL OF THE TIME AT THE TABLE IS 
THERE ARE NO RULES AND

03:07:26.269 --> 03:07:29.936
THERE ARE NO RULES AND          
REGULATIONS ABOUT MITIGATION    
AND THE VERY FIRST THING THAT I 

03:07:29.938 --> 03:07:30.604
REGULATIONS ABOUT MITIGATION    
AND THE VERY FIRST THING THAT I 
LEARNED WHAT I SAID AT THIS     

03:07:30.606 --> 03:07:33.640
AND THE VERY FIRST THING THAT I 
LEARNED WHAT I SAID AT THIS     
TABLE IS EVERY SINGLE TREE ON A 

03:07:33.642 --> 03:07:34.375
LEARNED WHAT I SAID AT THIS     
TABLE IS EVERY SINGLE TREE ON A 
DEVELOPMENT SITE IS COUNTED AND 

03:07:34.377 --> 03:07:37.778
TABLE IS EVERY SINGLE TREE ON A 
DEVELOPMENT SITE IS COUNTED AND 
TAGGED AND IF THEY ARE MATURE   

03:07:37.780 --> 03:07:40.848
DEVELOPMENT SITE IS COUNTED AND 
TAGGED AND IF THEY ARE MATURE   
TREES OR LANDMARK TREES THEY    

03:07:40.850 --> 03:07:41.448
TAGGED AND IF THEY ARE MATURE   
TREES OR LANDMARK TREES THEY

TREES OR LANDMARK TREES THEY    
HAVE TO BE REPLACED.

03:07:44.420 --> 03:07:45.218
HAVE TO BE REPLACED.            
AND SO I DON'T THINK A LOT      
OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IN THE      

03:07:45.220 --> 03:07:45.820
AND SO I DON'T THINK A LOT      
OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IN THE      
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.            

03:07:45.822 --> 03:07:48.722
OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IN THE      
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.            
I THINK THEY THINK IT'S A FREE

I THINK THEY THINK IT'S A FREE  
FOR ALL YOU GET A SITE, YOU CAN 

03:07:49.625 --> 03:07:50.558
I THINK THEY THINK IT'S A FREE  
FOR ALL YOU GET A SITE, YOU CAN 
JUST STRIP IT AND THEN DO       

03:07:50.560 --> 03:07:53.127
FOR ALL YOU GET A SITE, YOU CAN 
JUST STRIP IT AND THEN DO       
WHATEVER YOU WANT AND THAT IS

JUST STRIP IT AND THEN DO       
WHATEVER YOU WANT AND THAT IS   
NOT THE CASE UNIVERSALIS.       

03:07:56.265 --> 03:08:00.534
WHATEVER YOU WANT AND THAT IS   
NOT THE CASE UNIVERSALIS.       
SO JUST A LITTLE SO I AGREE     

03:08:00.536 --> 03:08:03.170
NOT THE CASE UNIVERSALIS.       
SO JUST A LITTLE SO I AGREE     
WITH A LOT OF THE STATEMENTS

WERE MADE.                      
SO DURING THE CONVERSATION OVER 
THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF WE     

03:08:10.380 --> 03:08:14.514

KNOW, ALL OF THAT'S TRUE FOR    
LARGER SCALE DEVELOPMENT WE

BETWEEN THE GREENBELT AND THE   

03:19:17.712 --> 03:19:18.511
NATURAL FEATURES HAS A SYNERGY  
BETWEEN THE GREENBELT AND THE   
FACT THAT NOW WE ARE BUILDING   

03:19:18.513 --> 03:19:21.782
BETWEEN THE GREENBELT AND THE   
FACT THAT NOW WE ARE BUILDING   
HEIGHT BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT

DENSIFY BY GOING UP AND WE PUT  
THAT MAP IN THERE AND THEN WE

DENSIFY BY GOING UP AND WE PUT  
THAT MAP IN THERE AND THEN WE   
CAN EVEN KEEP THERE WAS ONE MAP

03:51:02.616 --> 03:51:03.548
THEIR PLAN.                     
>> IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S VERY  
HARD TO DETERMINE WHAT THEY'RE  

03:51:03.550 --> 03:51:06.818
>> IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S VERY  
HARD TO DETERMINE WHAT THEY'RE  
ACTUALLY TRYING TO DEVELOP.     

03:51:06.820 --> 03:51:08.019
HARD TO DETERMINE WHAT THEY'RE  
ACTUALLY TRYING TO DEVELOP.     
IT DOES IT DOES HAVE LOCATIONS  

03:51:08.021 --> 03:51:10.855
ACTUALLY TRYING TO DEVELOP.     
IT DOES IT DOES HAVE LOCATIONS  
OF PROPOSED NEW DEVELOPMENT BUT 

03:51:10.857 --> 03:51:11.856
IT DOES IT DOES HAVE LOCATIONS  
OF PROPOSED NEW DEVELOPMENT BUT 
IT DOES NOT SAY WHAT IF THEY'RE 

03:51:11.858 --> 03:51:12.523
OF PROPOSED NEW DEVELOPMENT BUT 
IT DOES NOT SAY WHAT IF THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE A DORM OR IF        

03:51:12.525 --> 03:51:14.726
IT DOES NOT SAY WHAT IF THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE A DORM OR IF        
THEY'RE GOING TO BE A RESEARCH  

03:51:14.728 --> 03:51:15.593
GOING TO BE A DORM OR IF

SO I THINK THERE'S NOT A TON    
OF REFERENCE TO THE PLAN        

03:51:22.735 --> 03:51:23.701
SO I THINK THERE'S NOT A TON    
OF REFERENCE TO THE PLAN        
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO    

03:51:23.703 --> 03:51:24.602

THAT THEIR PLAN TO SHIFT MORE   
OF THE UNDERGRADUATES TO BEING  

03:51:47.027 --> 03:51:49.093
THAT THEIR PLAN TO SHIFT MORE   
OF THE UNDERGRADUATES TO BEING  
LIVING ON NORTH CAMPUS WAS      

03:51:49.095 --> 03:51:49.727
OF THE UNDERGRADUATES TO BEING  
LIVING ON NORTH CAMPUS WAS      
PRETTY FIRM AND THEY HAD        

03:51:49.729 --> 03:51:53.197
LIVING ON NORTH CAMPUS WAS      
PRETTY FIRM AND THEY HAD        
NUMBERS ABOUT THAT BUILDING BUT 

03:51:53.199 --> 03:51:57.135
PRETTY FIRM AND THEY HAD        
NUMBERS ABOUT THAT BUILDING BUT 
DORM I KNOW BUT IT DOES I MEAN

DORM I KNOW BUT IT DOES I MEAN  
IF THEY REALLY ARE DOING THAT,  

03:51:57.838 --> 03:52:00.838
DORM I KNOW BUT IT DOES I MEAN  
IF THEY REALLY ARE DOING THAT,  
THAT IS A COMPLICATED TRANSIT   

03:52:00.840 --> 03:52:01.773
IF THEY REALLY ARE DOING THAT,  
THAT IS A COMPLICATED TRANSIT   
THING AND THAT WOULD BE         

03:52:01.775 --> 03:52:05.476
THAT IS A COMPLICATED TRANSIT   
THING AND THAT WOULD BE         
SOMETHING THAT SO THAT WOULD BE

BECAUSE WE HAVE PROMOTE         
PERIMETER CAMPUS PARKING WHICH  

03:52:17.190 --> 03:52:20.524
BECAUSE WE HAVE PROMOTE         
PERIMETER CAMPUS PARKING WHICH  
I THINK HAS MORE OF AN EFFECT

PERIMETER CAMPUS PARKING WHICH  
I THINK HAS MORE OF AN EFFECT   
THAN THAT AMOUNT THAN A

POPULATION SHIFT AND THAT       
REALLY THAT COULD AFFECT OUR    

03:52:28.168 --> 03:52:28.500

REALLY THAT COULD AFFECT OUR    
RENTAL MARKET.

WE'VE GOTTEN SOME DEVELOPMENT   
OF SERVICES IN RESTAURANTS      
BECAUSE SO MANY STUDENTS ARE

THE PREVAILING DESIGNATIONS     
AROUND IT.                      

03:58:02.735 --> 03:58:03.601
THE PREVAILING DESIGNATIONS     
AROUND IT.                      
IT WASN'T HOW WE HANDLED IT

IT WASN'T HOW WE HANDLED IT     
WASN'T HOW HE HANDLED THE OTHER 
HISTORIC DISTRICTS WHERE LIKE   

03:58:07.407 --> 03:58:08.139
WASN'T HOW HE HANDLED THE OTHER 
HISTORIC DISTRICTS WHERE LIKE   
THE DOWNTOWN ONES AND THE HILL  

03:58:08.141 --> 03:58:10.774
HISTORIC DISTRICTS WHERE LIKE   
THE DOWNTOWN ONES AND THE HILL

FELT LIKE THEY SHOULD GET

03:58:18.250 --> 03:58:21.418
DESIGNATIONS.                   
SO IT FEELS LIKE THAT NEEDS TO  
BE A TRANSITION FOR THE OLD

SO IT FEELS LIKE THAT NEEDS TO  
BE A TRANSITION FOR THE OLD

03:58:22.021 --> 03:58:22.786
BE A TRANSITION FOR THE OLD     
FOURTH WARD DISTRICT.           
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I   

03:58:22.788 --> 03:58:24.756
FOURTH WARD DISTRICT.           
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I   
HAD WAS THERE WERE LARGE IT     

03:58:24.758 --> 03:58:25.556
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I   
HAD WAS THERE WERE LARGE IT     
SEEMED LIKE ANYTHING THAT WAS   

03:58:25.558 --> 03:58:28.525
HAD WAS THERE WERE LARGE IT     
SEEMED LIKE ANYTHING THAT WAS

EXPLAINS THE LITTLE POCKETS

EXPLAINS THE LITTLE POCKETS

EXPLAINS THE LITTLE POCKETS     
OF YELLOW IN VARIOUS SPOTS AND  
WHERE THEY STOP AND I WAS ABLE  

03:58:37.337 --> 03:58:38.135
OF YELLOW IN VARIOUS SPOTS AND  
WHERE THEY STOP AND I WAS ABLE  
TO TRACK ALL THAT BUT THERE WAS 

03:58:38.137 --> 03:58:40.604
WHERE THEY STOP AND I WAS ABLE  
TO TRACK ALL THAT BUT THERE WAS 
A LOT OF MULTIFAMILY IN NORTH

TO TRACK ALL THAT BUT THERE WAS 
A LOT OF MULTIFAMILY IN NORTH   
CAMPUS PARTICULARLY THAT DIDN'T 

03:58:41.373 --> 03:58:43.373
A LOT OF MULTIFAMILY IN NORTH

GET TRANSITION.                 
SO UNLESS THERE'S A REASON TO   
NOT HAVE IT BE TRANSITION AND

NOT HAVE IT BE TRANSITION AND

>> I CAN TALK TO SOME OF THAT   
RIGHT.                          
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN FOLLOW THE    

03:58:59.325 --> 03:59:03.360
RIGHT.                          
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN FOLLOW THE    
GUIDANCE THAT WE GOT FROM OUR   

03:59:03.362 --> 03:59:04.061
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN FOLLOW THE    
GUIDANCE THAT WE GOT FROM OUR   
HISTORIC PRESERVATIONIST WAS    

03:59:04.063 --> 03:59:07.732
GUIDANCE THAT WE GOT FROM OUR   
HISTORIC PRESERVATIONIST WAS    
THAT THE DC MAKES LIKE APPROVES 

03:59:07.734 --> 03:59:11.368
HISTORIC PRESERVATIONIST WAS    
THAT THE DC MAKES LIKE APPROVES 
DEVELOPMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE  

03:59:11.370 --> 03:59:12.236
THAT THE DC MAKES LIKE APPROVES 
DEVELOPMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE  
SOME CRITERIA THERE THAT REFER  

03:59:12.238 --> 03:59:15.072
DEVELOPMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE  
SOME CRITERIA THERE THAT REFER  
TO GENERAL CHARACTER AND IT WAS 

03:59:15.074 --> 03:59:18.509
SOME CRITERIA THERE THAT REFER  
TO GENERAL CHARACTER AND IT WAS 
EXPLAINED TO US THAT IF         

03:59:18.511 --> 03:59:19.277
TO GENERAL CHARACTER AND IT WAS 
EXPLAINED TO US THAT IF         
SOMETHING IS WILDLY OUT         

03:59:19.279 --> 03:59:22.079
EXPLAINED TO US THAT IF         
SOMETHING IS WILDLY OUT         
OF SCALE OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY   

03:59:22.081 --> 03:59:23.080
SOMETHING IS WILDLY OUT         
OF SCALE OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY   
THERE THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY TO  

03:59:23.082 --> 03:59:23.481
OF SCALE OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY   
THERE THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY TO  
BE APPROVED.                    

03:59:23.483 --> 03:59:26.917
THERE THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY TO  
BE APPROVED.                    
SO THOSE I THINK THERE WERE     

03:59:26.919 --> 03:59:27.684
BE APPROVED.                    
SO THOSE I THINK THERE WERE     
MANY THAT WERE UNDER TRANSITION 

03:59:27.686 --> 03:59:30.788
SO THOSE I THINK THERE WERE     
MANY THAT WERE UNDER TRANSITION 
AND THAT WE HAVE MOVED BACK TO  

03:59:30.790 --> 03:59:31.589
MANY THAT WERE UNDER TRANSITION 
AND THAT WE HAVE MOVED BACK TO  
LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL FOR THAT   

03:59:31.591 --> 03:59:34.725
AND THAT WE HAVE MOVED BACK TO  
LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL FOR THAT   
REASON AND SO THAT WOULD        

03:59:34.727 --> 03:59:35.326
LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL FOR THAT   
REASON AND SO THAT WOULD        
INCLUDE PLYMOUTH.               

03:59:35.328 --> 03:59:36.127
REASON AND SO THAT WOULD        
INCLUDE PLYMOUTH.               
I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THIS TOO 

03:59:36.129 --> 03:59:36.794
INCLUDE PLYMOUTH.               
I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THIS TOO 
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE BROUGHT 

03:59:36.796 --> 03:59:40.998
I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THIS TOO 
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE BROUGHT 
UP PLYMOUTH UM, WHY ISN'T THAT  

03:59:41.000 --> 03:59:41.699
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE BROUGHT 
UP PLYMOUTH UM, WHY ISN'T THAT  
TRANSITION I BELIEVE THERE'S    

03:59:41.701 --> 03:59:42.233
UP PLYMOUTH UM, WHY ISN'T THAT  
TRANSITION I BELIEVE THERE'S    
SOME OVERLAP THERE WITH         

03:59:42.235 --> 03:59:45.002
TRANSITION I BELIEVE THERE'S    
SOME OVERLAP THERE WITH         
HISTORIC DISTRICT AND ALSO THE  

03:59:45.004 --> 03:59:45.936
SOME OVERLAP THERE WITH         
HISTORIC DISTRICT AND ALSO THE  
GRID IS VERY, VERY STEEP AND    

03:59:45.938 --> 03:59:48.873
HISTORIC DISTRICT AND ALSO THE  
GRID IS VERY, VERY STEEP AND    
HARD TO DEVELOP ON.             

03:59:48.875 --> 03:59:52.276
GRID IS VERY, VERY STEEP AND    
HARD TO DEVELOP ON.             
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY WE DID    

03:59:52.278 --> 03:59:52.944
HARD TO DEVELOP ON.             
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY WE DID    
PROMOTE HIGHER DENSITY THERE.   

03:59:52.946 --> 03:59:53.878
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY WE DID    
PROMOTE HIGHER DENSITY THERE.   
>> BUT WOULDN'T THE HISTORIC    

03:59:53.880 --> 03:59:58.582
PROMOTE HIGHER DENSITY THERE.   
>> BUT WOULDN'T THE HISTORIC    
DISTRICT SUPERSEDE THE OTHER    

03:59:58.584 --> 03:59:58.983
>> BUT WOULDN'T THE HISTORIC    
DISTRICT SUPERSEDE THE OTHER    
ZONING?

WEST SIDE BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY 

04:06:36.582 --> 04:06:39.616

THREE AND FOUR AND THAT'S WHY I 
THINK ONE OF THE MAPS THAT

ALONG THE HERE ON RIVER         

04:10:13.966 --> 04:10:14.831
WE TALKED ABOUT THE NORTH HERE  
ALONG THE HERE ON RIVER         
CORRIDOR TO THE NORTH LIKE WHAT 

04:10:14.833 --> 04:10:15.499
ALONG THE HERE ON RIVER         
CORRIDOR TO THE NORTH LIKE WHAT 
THE RIGHT LAND USE PATTERN      

04:10:15.501 --> 04:10:19.002
CORRIDOR TO THE NORTH LIKE WHAT 
THE RIGHT LAND USE PATTERN      
SHIFTING AT MORE I GUESS FULLY  

04:10:19.004 --> 04:10:19.802
THE RIGHT LAND USE PATTERN      
SHIFTING AT MORE I GUESS FULLY  
FROM LIKE A MANUFACTURING INTO  

04:10:19.804 --> 04:10:22.005
SHIFTING AT MORE I GUESS FULLY  
FROM LIKE A MANUFACTURING INTO  
LIKE A MIXED TRANSITIONAL USE.  

04:10:22.007 --> 04:10:29.679
FROM LIKE A MANUFACTURING INTO  
LIKE A MIXED TRANSITIONAL USE.  
SO THOSE ARE HOW WE GOT TO THIS 

04:10:29.681 --> 04:10:29.980
LIKE A MIXED TRANSITIONAL USE.  
SO THOSE ARE HOW WE GOT TO THIS 
MAP.                            

04:10:29.982 --> 04:10:30.914
SO THOSE ARE HOW WE GOT TO THIS 
MAP.                            
IT WAS IT WAS NONE OF THOSE     

04:10:30.916 --> 04:10:37.121
MAP.                            
IT WAS IT WAS NONE OF THOSE     
THINGS BY THEMSELVES            

04:10:50.602 --> 04:10:52.802
                    .           
IT WAS SO I WOULD SUGGEST I     
THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR   

04:10:52.804 --> 04:10:53.469
IT WAS SO I WOULD SUGGEST I     
THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR   
ME I WOULDN'T REPLICATE THE     

04:10:53.471 --> 04:10:54.204
THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR   
ME I WOULDN'T REPLICATE THE     
ENTIRE ZONING MAP IN ALL ITS    

04:10:54.206 --> 04:10:54.871
ME I WOULDN'T REPLICATE THE     
ENTIRE ZONING MAP IN ALL ITS    
QUITE DETAIL BUT GENERATING A   

04:10:54.873 --> 04:10:55.539
ENTIRE ZONING MAP IN ALL ITS    
QUITE DETAIL BUT GENERATING A   
MAP THAT CALLS OUT THE          

04:10:55.541 --> 04:10:56.206
QUITE DETAIL BUT GENERATING A   
MAP THAT CALLS OUT THE          
IMPORTANT FEATURES OF IT, IT    

04:10:56.208 --> 04:10:56.940
MAP THAT CALLS OUT THE          
IMPORTANT FEATURES OF IT, IT    
ACTUALLY BECAME IMPORTANT IN    

04:10:56.942 --> 04:10:57.607
IMPORTANT FEATURES OF IT, IT    
ACTUALLY BECAME IMPORTANT IN    
INFLUENCING THE FUTURE.         

04:10:57.609 --> 04:10:58.241
ACTUALLY BECAME IMPORTANT IN    
INFLUENCING THE FUTURE.         
LEONIE'S MAP LIKE WHERE THEY    

04:10:58.243 --> 04:10:58.976
INFLUENCING THE FUTURE.         
LEONIE'S MAP LIKE WHERE THEY    
ARE ONE OR TWO DISTRICTS AND    

04:10:58.978 --> 04:10:59.643
LEONIE'S MAP LIKE WHERE THEY    
ARE ONE OR TWO DISTRICTS AND    
WHERE THEY ARE THREE OR FOUR    

04:10:59.645 --> 04:11:00.377
ARE ONE OR TWO DISTRICTS AND    
WHERE THEY ARE THREE OR FOUR    
DISTRICTS AND WHATEVER FEATURES 

04:11:00.379 --> 04:11:00.977
WHERE THEY ARE THREE OR FOUR    
DISTRICTS AND WHATEVER FEATURES 
WERE BECAME IMPORTANT           

04:11:00.979 --> 04:11:01.778
DISTRICTS AND WHATEVER FEATURES 
WERE BECAME IMPORTANT           
INDICATORS SHOWING THAT HERE'S  

04:11:01.780 --> 04:11:02.445
WERE BECAME IMPORTANT           
INDICATORS SHOWING THAT HERE'S  
THE KIND OF SELECTED EXISTING   

04:11:02.447 --> 04:11:03.247
INDICATORS SHOWING THAT HERE'S  
THE KIND OF SELECTED EXISTING   
LAND USES THAT INFORMED WHAT    

04:11:03.249 --> 04:11:03.847
THE KIND OF SELECTED EXISTING   
LAND USES THAT INFORMED WHAT    
WE'RE MAPPING AS THE FUTURE     

04:11:03.849 --> 04:11:04.314
LAND USES THAT INFORMED WHAT    
WE'RE MAPPING AS THE FUTURE     
LAND USE MAP.                   

04:11:04.316 --> 04:11:05.182
WE'RE MAPPING AS THE FUTURE     
LAND USE MAP.                   
I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY      

04:11:05.184 --> 04:11:08.352
LAND USE MAP.                   
I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY      
HELPFUL AND THE LOGIC IT MADE   

04:11:08.354 --> 04:11:09.552
I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY      
HELPFUL AND THE LOGIC IT MADE   
SENSE TO ME TO MAKE THE LOW     

04:11:09.554 --> 04:11:12.289
HELPFUL AND THE LOGIC IT MADE   
SENSE TO ME TO MAKE THE LOW     
RISE THE ONE IN TWO DISTRICTS   

04:11:12.291 --> 04:11:13.290
SENSE TO ME TO MAKE THE LOW     
RISE THE ONE IN TWO DISTRICTS   
IN THE TRANSITION THE ARE THREE 

04:11:13.292 --> 04:11:16.760
RISE THE ONE IN TWO DISTRICTS   
IN THE TRANSITION THE ARE THREE 
IN OUR FOUR DISTRICTS UM AND SO 

04:11:16.762 --> 04:11:17.727
IN THE TRANSITION THE ARE THREE 
IN OUR FOUR DISTRICTS UM AND SO 
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT 

04:11:17.729 --> 04:11:18.462
IN OUR FOUR DISTRICTS UM AND SO 
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT 
WITH THE OLD WEST SIDE BECAUSE  

04:11:18.464 --> 04:11:20.998
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT 
WITH THE OLD WEST SIDE BECAUSE  
THEY'RE SMART FORESE IN THERE   

04:11:21.000 --> 04:11:21.331
WITH THE OLD WEST SIDE BECAUSE  
THEY'RE SMART FORESE IN THERE   
RIGHT?                          

04:11:21.333 --> 04:11:21.732
THEY'RE SMART FORESE IN THERE   
RIGHT?                          
>> YEAH.                        

04:11:21.734 --> 04:11:25.568
RIGHT?                          
>> YEAH.                        
SO AND I THINK THEY GOT IT I    

04:11:25.570 --> 04:11:26.336
>> YEAH.                        
SO AND I THINK THEY GOT IT I    
WENT AND LOOKED IN THAT YELLOW  

04:11:26.338 --> 04:11:29.372
SO AND I THINK THEY GOT IT I    
WENT AND LOOKED IN THAT YELLOW  
BUBBLE THAT YOU SEE KIND        

04:11:29.374 --> 04:11:29.973
WENT AND LOOKED IN THAT YELLOW  
BUBBLE THAT YOU SEE KIND        
OF BUBBLING INTO IT.            

04:11:29.975 --> 04:11:30.873
BUBBLE THAT YOU SEE KIND        
OF BUBBLING INTO IT.            
YEAH I THINK THE AIR FORCE HE   

04:11:30.875 --> 04:11:33.009
OF BUBBLING INTO IT.            
YEAH I THINK THE AIR FORCE HE   
GOT CAPTURED SO I WOULD SHOW    

04:11:33.011 --> 04:11:33.710
YEAH I THINK THE AIR FORCE HE   
GOT CAPTURED SO I WOULD SHOW    
THOSE THINGS AND THEN NOT YOU   

04:11:33.712 --> 04:11:36.847
GOT CAPTURED SO I WOULD SHOW    
THOSE THINGS AND THEN NOT YOU   
KNOW, I WOULDN'T DO IT LIKE WE  

04:11:36.849 --> 04:11:37.481
THOSE THINGS AND THEN NOT YOU   
KNOW, I WOULDN'T DO IT LIKE WE  
SHOULD EITHER INCLUDE ALL       

04:11:37.483 --> 04:11:38.215
KNOW, I WOULDN'T DO IT LIKE WE  
SHOULD EITHER INCLUDE ALL       
OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS IN    

04:11:38.217 --> 04:11:40.817
SHOULD EITHER INCLUDE ALL       
OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS IN    
TRANSITION OR NOT.              

04:11:40.819 --> 04:11:41.751
OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS IN    
TRANSITION OR NOT.              
I WOULDN'T THINK OF IT THAT     

04:11:41.753 --> 04:11:42.018
TRANSITION OR NOT.              
I WOULDN'T THINK OF IT THAT     
WAY.                            

04:11:42.020 --> 04:11:42.886
I WOULDN'T THINK OF IT THAT     
WAY.                            
I WOULD THINK IF WE'RE USING    

04:11:42.888 --> 04:11:44.454
WAY.                            
I WOULD THINK IF WE'RE USING    
THE LOGIC OF OUR ONE HOUR TO TO 

04:11:44.456 --> 04:11:45.221
I WOULD THINK IF WE'RE USING    
THE LOGIC OF OUR ONE HOUR TO TO 
LOW RISE IN OUR THREE OR FOUR   

04:11:45.223 --> 04:11:47.924
THE LOGIC OF OUR ONE HOUR TO TO 
LOW RISE IN OUR THREE OR FOUR   
TO TRANSITION DO THAT AND THEN  

04:11:47.926 --> 04:11:48.725
LOW RISE IN OUR THREE OR FOUR   
TO TRANSITION DO THAT AND THEN  
JUST SHOW AN OVERLAY OF WHERE   

04:11:48.727 --> 04:11:49.392
TO TRANSITION DO THAT AND THEN  
JUST SHOW AN OVERLAY OF WHERE   
THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS ARE      

04:11:49.394 --> 04:11:51.494
JUST SHOW AN OVERLAY OF WHERE   
THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS ARE      
RIGHT NOW JUST TO SEE HOW       

04:11:51.496 --> 04:11:52.396
THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS ARE      
RIGHT NOW JUST TO SEE HOW       
THEY'RE LAYING ON TOP OF THOSE  

04:11:52.398 --> 04:11:52.996
RIGHT NOW JUST TO SEE HOW       
THEY'RE LAYING ON TOP OF THOSE  
UNDERLYING THINGS.              

04:11:52.998 --> 04:11:56.133
THEY'RE LAYING ON TOP OF THOSE  
UNDERLYING THINGS.              
SO JUST HAVING ONE OR TWO THEY  

04:11:56.135 --> 04:11:59.869
UNDERLYING THINGS.              
SO JUST HAVING ONE OR TWO THEY  
OPEN THE NOT THE OPEN SPACE MAP 

04:11:59.871 --> 04:12:00.903
SO JUST HAVING ONE OR TWO THEY  
OPEN THE NOT THE OPEN SPACE MAP 
AND THE TRANSIT MAP AND THAT    

04:12:00.905 --> 04:12:04.441
OPEN THE NOT THE OPEN SPACE MAP 
AND THE TRANSIT MAP AND THAT    
KIND OF EXISTING LAND USES THAT 

04:12:04.443 --> 04:12:07.710
AND THE TRANSIT MAP AND THAT    
KIND OF EXISTING LAND USES THAT 
OUR CURRENT LAND USES WHETHER A 

04:12:07.712 --> 04:12:08.412
KIND OF EXISTING LAND USES THAT 
OUR CURRENT LAND USES WHETHER A 
CURRENTLY NEWSPAPER IN THE      

04:12:08.414 --> 04:12:08.879
OUR CURRENT LAND USES WHETHER A 
CURRENTLY NEWSPAPER IN THE      
ZONING MAP THAT KIND            

04:12:08.881 --> 04:12:11.615
CURRENTLY NEWSPAPER IN THE      
ZONING MAP THAT KIND            
OF INFORMED THE LOGIC THAT      

04:12:11.617 --> 04:12:12.415
ZONING MAP THAT KIND            
OF INFORMED THE LOGIC THAT      
WOULD REALLY HELP INFORM HOW    

04:12:12.417 --> 04:12:13.416
OF INFORMED THE LOGIC THAT      
WOULD REALLY HELP INFORM HOW    
DID YOU GET TO THIS FUTURE LAND 

04:12:13.418 --> 04:12:15.051
WOULD REALLY HELP INFORM HOW    
DID YOU GET TO THIS FUTURE LAND 
USE MAP.                        

04:12:15.053 --> 04:12:16.085
DID YOU GET TO THIS FUTURE LAND 
USE MAP.                        
SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS PLANNER  

04:12:16.087 --> 04:12:19.456
USE MAP.                        
SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS PLANNER  
BENNET NOT STRICTLY THE ZONING  

04:12:19.458 --> 04:12:22.592
SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS PLANNER  
BENNET NOT STRICTLY THE ZONING  
MAP BUT SOME SIMPLIFIED         

04:12:22.594 --> 04:12:23.660
BENNET NOT STRICTLY THE ZONING  
MAP BUT SOME SIMPLIFIED         
CREATION OF IT THAT WAS USED TO 

04:12:23.662 --> 04:12:24.193
MAP BUT SOME SIMPLIFIED         
CREATION OF IT THAT WAS USED TO 
INFORM THE MAP.                 

04:12:24.195 --> 04:12:27.030
CREATION OF IT THAT WAS USED TO 
INFORM THE MAP.                 
>> CAN WE GO BACK TO MAYBE      

04:12:27.032 --> 04:12:27.831
INFORM THE MAP.                 
>> CAN WE GO BACK TO MAYBE      
START WITH THE OLD FOURTH WARD  

04:12:27.833 --> 04:12:30.900
>> CAN WE GO BACK TO MAYBE      
START WITH THE OLD FOURTH WARD  
LIKE I JUST THE YEAH.           

04:12:30.902 --> 04:12:31.835
START WITH THE OLD FOURTH WARD  
LIKE I JUST THE YEAH.           
DOES THE COMMISSION ENVISION    

04:12:31.837 --> 04:12:34.704
LIKE I JUST THE YEAH.           
DOES THE COMMISSION ENVISION    
THAT THE LAND USE CHANGE?       

04:12:34.706 --> 04:12:35.906
DOES THE COMMISSION ENVISION    
THAT THE LAND USE CHANGE?       
YEAH, I WAS MAYBE THE MAYBE THE 

04:12:35.908 --> 04:12:38.475
THAT THE LAND USE CHANGE?       
YEAH, I WAS MAYBE THE MAYBE THE 
PROPOSAL I'M MAKING IS THAT THE 

04:12:38.477 --> 04:12:39.342
YEAH, I WAS MAYBE THE MAYBE THE 
PROPOSAL I'M MAKING IS THAT THE 
HISTORIC DISTRICTS GET TREATED  

04:12:39.344 --> 04:12:42.979
PROPOSAL I'M MAKING IS THAT THE 
HISTORIC DISTRICTS GET TREATED  
CONSISTENTLY WITH HOW THE       

04:12:42.981 --> 04:12:43.614
HISTORIC DISTRICTS GET TREATED  
CONSISTENTLY WITH HOW THE       
SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD IS     

04:12:43.616 --> 04:12:46.750
CONSISTENTLY WITH HOW THE       
SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD IS     
BEING TREATED FOR PURPOSES      

04:12:46.752 --> 04:12:47.651
SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD IS     
BEING TREATED FOR PURPOSES      
OF THE PLAN THE LAND USE MAP.   

04:12:47.653 --> 04:12:50.320
BEING TREATED FOR PURPOSES      
OF THE PLAN THE LAND USE MAP.   
>> BUT NASHED OR SOMETHING OR   

04:12:50.322 --> 04:12:51.054
OF THE PLAN THE LAND USE MAP.   
>> BUT NASHED OR SOMETHING OR   
THEY CAN BE CALLED OUT OUR

THEY CAN BE CALLED OUT OUR      
HOUSE IS A HISTORIC DISTRICT    

04:12:51.856 --> 04:12:54.924
THEY CAN BE CALLED OUT OUR      
HOUSE IS A HISTORIC DISTRICT    
BUT THE RECOMMENDATION WE MAKE  

04:12:54.926 --> 04:12:55.758

KNOW AGAIN ONE HOUR ONE AND TWO

HIGHER OR NO BEING TRANSITIONAL 
LIKE I DON'T I DON'T UNLESS     
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WE'RE

LIKE I DON'T I DON'T UNLESS     
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WE'RE    
LIKE THERE'S NO WAY IN THE      

04:16:46.725 --> 04:16:47.456
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WE'RE    
LIKE THERE'S NO WAY IN THE      
WORLD THAT WE THINK THE         

04:16:47.458 --> 04:16:49.793

THERE'S SOME PLACE WHERE WE     
THINK THERE JUST SHOULD NOT BE

THERE'S SOME PLACE WHERE WE     
THINK THERE JUST SHOULD NOT BE  
DEVELOPMENT EVER IN THE FUTURE, 

04:17:00.906 --> 04:17:01.838
THINK THERE JUST SHOULD NOT BE  
DEVELOPMENT EVER IN THE FUTURE, 
I DON'T SEE A REASON TO MOVE    

04:17:01.840 --> 04:17:05.942
DEVELOPMENT EVER IN THE FUTURE, 
I DON'T SEE A REASON TO MOVE    
THEM DOWN ON THE INTENSITY.     

04:17:05.944 --> 04:17:07.143
I DON'T SEE A REASON TO MOVE    
THEM DOWN ON THE INTENSITY.     
AND SO I THINK BUT I WANT TO    

04:17:07.145 --> 04:17:09.278
THEM DOWN ON THE INTENSITY.     
AND SO I THINK BUT I WANT TO    
SAY YES, THERE ARE PLACES THAT

AND SO I THINK BUT I WANT TO    
SAY YES, THERE ARE PLACES THAT  
WE THINK CURRENTLY ARE ONE OR   

04:17:10.114 --> 04:17:13.349
SAY YES, THERE ARE PLACES THAT  
WE THINK CURRENTLY ARE ONE OR   
TWO THAT SHOULD BE MOVED UP IN

WE THINK CURRENTLY ARE ONE OR   
TWO THAT SHOULD BE MOVED UP IN  
TERMS OF INTENSITY FOR DOWNTOWN

>> SO I I DON'T WANT TO BE      
TOTALLY WENT TO WHAT WE HAVE    
NOW BUT THAT'S THE STARTING     

04:17:24.196 --> 04:17:25.228
TOTALLY WENT TO WHAT WE HAVE    
NOW BUT THAT'S THE STARTING     
POINT AND I THINK WE ADD        

04:17:25.230 --> 04:17:28.898
NOW BUT THAT'S THE STARTING     
POINT AND I THINK WE ADD        
ADDITIONAL DENSITY FROM THERE   

04:17:28.900 --> 04:17:29.566
POINT AND I THINK WE ADD        
ADDITIONAL DENSITY FROM THERE   
RATHER THAN TAKE IT AWAY.       

04:17:29.568 --> 04:17:29.899
ADDITIONAL DENSITY FROM THERE   
RATHER THAN TAKE IT AWAY.       
RIGHT.                          

04:17:29.901 --> 04:17:32.568
RATHER THAN TAKE IT AWAY.       
RIGHT.                          
WHICH B AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY  

04:17:32.570 --> 04:17:35.638
RIGHT.                          
WHICH B AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY  
I'M REALLY I THINK HAVING THIS  

04:17:35.640 --> 04:17:36.339
WHICH B AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY  
I'M REALLY I THINK HAVING THIS  
OVERLAY SO THAT WE ARE VERY     

04:17:36.341 --> 04:17:36.940
I'M REALLY I THINK HAVING THIS  
OVERLAY SO THAT WE ARE VERY     
CLEAR WITH PEOPLE AND           

04:17:36.942 --> 04:17:40.042
OVERLAY SO THAT WE ARE VERY     
CLEAR WITH PEOPLE AND           
DEVELOPERS ABOUT WHERE THERE    

04:17:40.044 --> 04:17:40.810
CLEAR WITH PEOPLE AND           
DEVELOPERS ABOUT WHERE THERE    
ARE EXISTING HISTORIC DISTRICTS 

04:17:40.812 --> 04:17:44.481
DEVELOPERS ABOUT WHERE THERE    
ARE EXISTING HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
SO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS  

04:17:44.483 --> 04:17:48.017
ARE EXISTING HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
SO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS  
THING LIKE OH LOOK, I THINK     

04:17:48.019 --> 04:17:48.718
SO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS  
THING LIKE OH LOOK, I THINK     
THAT THAT'S REALLY, REALLY      

04:17:48.720 --> 04:17:49.118
THING LIKE OH LOOK, I THINK     
THAT THAT'S REALLY, REALLY      
IMPORTANT TOO.

THAT THAT'S REALLY, REALLY      
IMPORTANT TOO.                  
SO I WOULD ONLY VOTE FOR        

04:17:51.857 --> 04:17:54.557
IMPORTANT TOO.                  
SO I WOULD ONLY VOTE FOR        
FILLING THAT IN AND YELLOW

FILLING THE OLD FOURTH WARD AND 
YELLOW IF WE ALSO HAVE          
SOMETHING THAT HAS AN OVERLAY   

04:17:59.497 --> 04:18:00.163
YELLOW IF WE ALSO HAVE          
SOMETHING THAT HAS AN OVERLAY   
SHOWING WHERE THE HISTORIC      

04:18:00.165 --> 04:18:03.300
SOMETHING THAT HAS AN OVERLAY   
SHOWING WHERE THE HISTORIC      
DISTRICTS ARE AND NOT JUST THAT 

04:18:03.302 --> 04:18:03.900
SHOWING WHERE THE HISTORIC      
DISTRICTS ARE AND NOT JUST THAT 
ONE ALL OF THEM.

ONE ALL OF THEM.                
>> YEAH.                        
AND I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL FOR  

04:18:05.037 --> 04:18:06.902
>> YEAH.                        
AND I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL FOR  
PEOPLE TO SEE.                  

04:18:06.904 --> 04:18:07.704
AND I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL FOR  
PEOPLE TO SEE.                  
I THERE THERE'S A LITTLE TABLE  

04:18:07.706 --> 04:18:10.640
PEOPLE TO SEE.                  
I THERE THERE'S A LITTLE TABLE  
FOR THAT HISTORIC DISTRICT FROM 

04:18:10.642 --> 04:18:11.174
I THERE THERE'S A LITTLE TABLE  
FOR THAT HISTORIC DISTRICT FROM 
THIS CONSIDERATION.             

04:18:11.176 --> 04:18:11.507
FOR THAT HISTORIC DISTRICT FROM 
THIS CONSIDERATION.             
YEAH.                           

04:18:11.509 --> 04:18:12.642
THIS CONSIDERATION.             
YEAH.                           
I THINK WE CAN DO A HASHING     

04:18:12.644 --> 04:18:15.211
YEAH.                           
I THINK WE CAN DO A HASHING     
OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT BUT I  

04:18:15.213 --> 04:18:15.978
I THINK WE CAN DO A HASHING     
OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT BUT I  
THINK WHERE I WAS MOVING        

04:18:15.980 --> 04:18:19.015
OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT BUT I  
THINK WHERE I WAS MOVING        
TOWARDS COMMISSIONER ADAMS WAS  

04:18:19.017 --> 04:18:22.885
THINK WHERE I WAS MOVING        
TOWARDS COMMISSIONER ADAMS WAS  
TOWARDS THE TRANSITION AND THE  

04:18:22.887 --> 04:18:23.620
TOWARDS COMMISSIONER ADAMS WAS  
TOWARDS THE TRANSITION AND THE  
PLACES WHERE THEY ARE MISSING   

04:18:23.622 --> 04:18:26.589
TOWARDS THE TRANSITION AND THE  
PLACES WHERE THEY ARE MISSING   
NOW OR IN THE APPROPRIATE       

04:18:26.591 --> 04:18:27.257
PLACES WHERE THEY ARE MISSING   
NOW OR IN THE APPROPRIATE       
FUTURE DISTRICTS WHERE THEY ARE 

04:18:27.259 --> 04:18:30.993
NOW OR IN THE APPROPRIATE       
FUTURE DISTRICTS WHERE THEY ARE 
MISSING NOW AND FEEL LIKE       

04:18:30.995 --> 04:18:31.628
FUTURE DISTRICTS WHERE THEY ARE 
MISSING NOW AND FEEL LIKE       
THERE'S SOME SUPPORT AT THE     

04:18:31.630 --> 04:18:31.961
MISSING NOW AND FEEL LIKE       
THERE'S SOME SUPPORT AT THE     
TABLE.                          

04:18:31.963 --> 04:18:34.631
THERE'S SOME SUPPORT AT THE     
TABLE.                          
LET'S HEAR FROM COMMISSIONER    

04:18:34.633 --> 04:18:38.568
TABLE.                          
LET'S HEAR FROM COMMISSIONER    
NORTON AND SO THE LOGIC SO TO   

04:18:38.570 --> 04:18:39.569
LET'S HEAR FROM COMMISSIONER    
NORTON AND SO THE LOGIC SO TO   
GO BACK TO A QUESTION YOU ASKED 

04:18:39.571 --> 04:18:42.672
NORTON AND SO THE LOGIC SO TO   
GO BACK TO A QUESTION YOU ASKED 
A FEW MINUTES AGO, IT MAKES IT  

04:18:42.674 --> 04:18:43.506
GO BACK TO A QUESTION YOU ASKED 
A FEW MINUTES AGO, IT MAKES IT  
CLEARLY THE EXISTING LAND USE   

04:18:43.508 --> 04:18:46.209
A FEW MINUTES AGO, IT MAKES IT  
CLEARLY THE EXISTING LAND USE   
IS INFORMING THE FUTURE LAND    

04:18:46.211 --> 04:18:47.010
CLEARLY THE EXISTING LAND USE   
IS INFORMING THE FUTURE LAND    
USE MAP PROVIDING THE RELEVANT  

04:18:47.012 --> 04:18:51.247
IS INFORMING THE FUTURE LAND    
USE MAP PROVIDING THE RELEVANT  
ELEMENTS OF WHAT THE EXISTING   

04:18:51.249 --> 04:18:51.915
USE MAP PROVIDING THE RELEVANT  
ELEMENTS OF WHAT THE EXISTING   
LAND USE IS BEING USED TO       

04:18:51.917 --> 04:18:53.984
ELEMENTS OF WHAT THE EXISTING   
LAND USE IS BEING USED TO       
INFORM AND MAPPING.             

04:18:53.986 --> 04:18:54.917
LAND USE IS BEING USED TO       
INFORM AND MAPPING.             
THAT WOULD BE A HELPFUL THING   

04:18:54.919 --> 04:18:55.785
INFORM AND MAPPING.             
THAT WOULD BE A HELPFUL THING   
TO PUT ON A MAP JUST SO PEOPLE  

04:18:55.787 --> 04:18:56.119
THAT WOULD BE A HELPFUL THING   
TO PUT ON A MAP JUST SO PEOPLE  
CAN SEE.                        

04:18:56.121 --> 04:18:58.254
TO PUT ON A MAP JUST SO PEOPLE  
CAN SEE.                        
SO THAT WAS SO IT'S THE         

04:18:58.256 --> 04:18:58.788
CAN SEE.                        
SO THAT WAS SO IT'S THE         
EXISTING LAND USE ISN'T         

04:18:58.790 --> 04:19:02.291
SO THAT WAS SO IT'S THE         
EXISTING LAND USE ISN'T         
PREDETERMINING IN A HARD FIXED  

04:19:02.293 --> 04:19:03.093
EXISTING LAND USE ISN'T         
PREDETERMINING IN A HARD FIXED  
WAY WHAT THE FUTURE LAND IS     

04:19:03.095 --> 04:19:03.760
PREDETERMINING IN A HARD FIXED  
WAY WHAT THE FUTURE LAND IS     
BECAUSE THERE ARE PLACES WHERE  

04:19:03.762 --> 04:19:05.829
WAY WHAT THE FUTURE LAND IS     
BECAUSE THERE ARE PLACES WHERE  
WE'RE GOING TO STAY YOU KNOW,   

04:19:05.831 --> 04:19:06.763
BECAUSE THERE ARE PLACES WHERE  
WE'RE GOING TO STAY YOU KNOW,   
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR  

04:19:06.765 --> 04:19:07.697
WE'RE GOING TO STAY YOU KNOW,   
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR  
MORE DENSITY BUT HAVING A MAP   

04:19:07.699 --> 04:19:10.232
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR  
MORE DENSITY BUT HAVING A MAP   
OF WHAT EXISTING IS THAT'S      

04:19:10.234 --> 04:19:10.566
MORE DENSITY BUT HAVING A MAP   
OF WHAT EXISTING IS THAT'S      
IMPORTANT.                      

04:19:10.568 --> 04:19:11.267
OF WHAT EXISTING IS THAT'S      
IMPORTANT.                      
>> IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND      

04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:14.236
IMPORTANT.                      
>> IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND      
YOU'RE SEEING LAND USE BUT YOU  

04:19:14.238 --> 04:19:14.671
>> IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND      
YOU'RE SEEING LAND USE BUT YOU  
MEAN ZONING?                    

04:19:14.673 --> 04:19:15.571
YOU'RE SEEING LAND USE BUT YOU  
MEAN ZONING?                    
>> WELL, THE SIMPLE KIND        

04:19:15.573 --> 04:19:18.341
MEAN ZONING?                    
>> WELL, THE SIMPLE KIND        
OF SIMPLIFIED ZONING MAP THAT'S 

04:19:18.343 --> 04:19:19.008
>> WELL, THE SIMPLE KIND        
OF SIMPLIFIED ZONING MAP THAT'S 
REALLY KIND OF ALLOWING         

04:19:19.010 --> 04:19:19.475
OF SIMPLIFIED ZONING MAP THAT'S 
REALLY KIND OF ALLOWING         
EXISTING LINE OK.               

04:19:19.477 --> 04:19:21.644
REALLY KIND OF ALLOWING         
EXISTING LINE OK.               
YEAH, AND THEN THE SECOND POINT 

04:19:21.646 --> 04:19:22.578
EXISTING LINE OK.               
YEAH, AND THEN THE SECOND POINT 
IS WE OUGHT TO TREAT THIS THE   

04:19:22.580 --> 04:19:25.648
YEAH, AND THEN THE SECOND POINT 
IS WE OUGHT TO TREAT THIS THE   
LOGIC THAT I'M HEARING IS FOR A 

04:19:25.650 --> 04:19:28.617
IS WE OUGHT TO TREAT THIS THE   
LOGIC THAT I'M HEARING IS FOR A 
PARTICULARLY THE LOW RISE       

04:19:28.619 --> 04:19:29.319
LOGIC THAT I'M HEARING IS FOR A 
PARTICULARLY THE LOW RISE       
RESIDENTIAL AND TRANSITION      

04:19:29.321 --> 04:19:29.919
PARTICULARLY THE LOW RISE       
RESIDENTIAL AND TRANSITION      
DISTRICTS IT WAS LARGELY        

04:19:29.921 --> 04:19:33.089
RESIDENTIAL AND TRANSITION      
DISTRICTS IT WAS LARGELY        
PREMISED ON THE AH ON OUR TWO   

04:19:33.091 --> 04:19:33.890
DISTRICTS IT WAS LARGELY        
PREMISED ON THE AH ON OUR TWO   
GOING INTO LOW RISE USE THAT    

04:19:33.892 --> 04:19:37.160
PREMISED ON THE AH ON OUR TWO   
GOING INTO LOW RISE USE THAT    
SAME LOGIC FOR THE HISTORIC     

04:19:37.162 --> 04:19:37.961
GOING INTO LOW RISE USE THAT    
SAME LOGIC FOR THE HISTORIC     
DISTRICTS DON'T TWEAK IT JUST   

04:19:37.963 --> 04:19:38.628
SAME LOGIC FOR THE HISTORIC     
DISTRICTS DON'T TWEAK IT JUST   
BECAUSE IT'S AN HISTORIC        

04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:41.264
DISTRICTS DON'T TWEAK IT JUST   
BECAUSE IT'S AN HISTORIC        
DISTRICT BUT THEN PUT THE       

04:19:41.266 --> 04:19:41.865
BECAUSE IT'S AN HISTORIC        
DISTRICT BUT THEN PUT THE       
OVERLAY OF THE HISTORIC         

04:19:41.867 --> 04:19:44.333
DISTRICT BUT THEN PUT THE       
OVERLAY OF THE HISTORIC

>> I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE    
ALL COMING UP.                  
I THINK SO, YEAH.               

04:19:46.337 --> 04:19:48.738
ALL COMING UP.                  
I THINK SO, YEAH.               
SO WAS THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION 

04:19:48.740 --> 04:19:49.472
I THINK SO, YEAH.               
SO WAS THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION 
ABOUT IT WAS OUR FORESEE IT     

04:19:49.474 --> 04:19:49.806
SO WAS THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION 
ABOUT IT WAS OUR FORESEE IT     
STAYS.                          

04:19:49.808 --> 04:19:51.741
ABOUT IT WAS OUR FORESEE IT     
STAYS.                          
YEAH.                           

04:19:51.743 --> 04:19:52.809
STAYS.                          
YEAH.                           
>> TRANSITION I JUST DON'T SIT  

04:19:52.811 --> 04:19:56.312
YEAH.                           
>> TRANSITION I JUST DON'T SIT  
HERE KNOWLEDGEABLE OF ALL THE   

04:19:56.314 --> 04:19:57.079
>> TRANSITION I JUST DON'T SIT  
HERE KNOWLEDGEABLE OF ALL THE   
OTHER JUDGMENTS THAT WE DEBATED 

04:19:57.081 --> 04:20:00.116
HERE KNOWLEDGEABLE OF ALL THE   
OTHER JUDGMENTS THAT WE DEBATED 
OUTSIDE THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS. 

04:20:00.118 --> 04:20:01.184
OTHER JUDGMENTS THAT WE DEBATED 
OUTSIDE THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS. 
AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE       

04:20:01.186 --> 04:20:01.918
OUTSIDE THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS. 
AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE       
OF THE THINGS I'M STRUGGLING    

04:20:01.920 --> 04:20:03.252
AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE       
OF THE THINGS I'M STRUGGLING    
WITH SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A       

04:20:03.254 --> 04:20:03.987
OF THE THINGS I'M STRUGGLING    
WITH SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A       
SENSITIVITY TO US TREATING THE  

04:20:03.989 --> 04:20:04.721
WITH SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A       
SENSITIVITY TO US TREATING THE  
HISTORIC DISTRICTS WHICH I GET  

04:20:04.723 --> 04:20:07.523
SENSITIVITY TO US TREATING THE  
HISTORIC DISTRICTS WHICH I GET  
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THERE'S       

04:20:07.525 --> 04:20:08.258
HISTORIC DISTRICTS WHICH I GET  
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THERE'S       
DIVERSITY OF OPINION HERE ABOUT 

04:20:08.260 --> 04:20:11.161
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THERE'S       
DIVERSITY OF OPINION HERE ABOUT 
THE LONG TERM BENEFIT, YOU      

04:20:11.163 --> 04:20:11.861
DIVERSITY OF OPINION HERE ABOUT 
THE LONG TERM BENEFIT, YOU      
KNOW, GOAL OF THOSE.            

04:20:11.863 --> 04:20:15.765
THE LONG TERM BENEFIT, YOU      
KNOW, GOAL OF THOSE.            
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE ABSOLUTE 

04:20:15.767 --> 04:20:19.301
KNOW, GOAL OF THOSE.            
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE ABSOLUTE 
AND SAY LIKE EVERY HOUR ONE     

04:20:19.303 --> 04:20:20.070
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE ABSOLUTE 
AND SAY LIKE EVERY HOUR ONE     
HOUR TO EVEN OUTSIDE DISTRICTS  

04:20:20.072 --> 04:20:20.903
AND SAY LIKE EVERY HOUR ONE     
HOUR TO EVEN OUTSIDE DISTRICTS  
IS NOW A LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL   

04:20:20.905 --> 04:20:23.473
HOUR TO EVEN OUTSIDE DISTRICTS  
IS NOW A LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL   
BECAUSE THAT'S GONE THROUGH     

04:20:23.475 --> 04:20:24.074
IS NOW A LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL   
BECAUSE THAT'S GONE THROUGH     
SOME QUALIFICATION THIS MAP.    

04:20:24.076 --> 04:20:27.943
BECAUSE THAT'S GONE THROUGH

TO CONTINUE TO GO SAID GOING TO 
BE OK, FINE.                    
WE'LL RAISE THEM AND DISCUSS

WE'LL RAISE THEM AND DISCUSS    
THEM.                           
I THINK SO GOOD TO BE MY NEXT

I THINK SO GOOD TO BE MY NEXT   
REQUEST.                        
IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL.     

04:20:40.358 --> 04:20:42.358
REQUEST.                        
IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL.     
SO INSTEAD OF KIND              

04:20:42.360 --> 04:20:43.026
IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL.     
SO INSTEAD OF KIND              
OF RECAPITULATING THE STUFF     

04:20:43.028 --> 04:20:46.095
SO INSTEAD OF KIND              
OF RECAPITULATING THE STUFF     
BEFORE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN     

04:20:46.097 --> 04:20:46.963
OF RECAPITULATING THE STUFF     
BEFORE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN     
REALLY HELPFUL WAS WHAT WAS THE 

04:20:46.965 --> 04:20:47.663
BEFORE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN     
REALLY HELPFUL WAS WHAT WAS THE 
PROCESS THAT WAS USED TO        

04:20:47.665 --> 04:20:50.199
REALLY HELPFUL WAS WHAT WAS THE 
PROCESS THAT WAS USED TO        
GENERATE THIS MAP PLUS ONE      

04:20:50.201 --> 04:20:51.033
PROCESS THAT WAS USED TO        
GENERATE THIS MAP PLUS ONE      
HERE'S THE RUBRIC WE USED THE   

04:20:51.035 --> 04:20:57.474
GENERATE THIS MAP PLUS ONE      
HERE'S THE RUBRIC WE USED THE   
LOGIC AND HERE'S WHY            

04:21:11.322 --> 04:21:13.289
                     WE'RE      
MAKING R-1 AN HOUR TO A LOW     
RISE AND HERE'S WHY THIS IS     

04:21:13.291 --> 04:21:14.090
MAKING R-1 AN HOUR TO A LOW     
RISE AND HERE'S WHY THIS IS     
ACTUALLY A PLACE TO ELEVATE IT  

04:21:14.092 --> 04:21:14.757
RISE AND HERE'S WHY THIS IS     
ACTUALLY A PLACE TO ELEVATE IT  
TO A HIGHER DENSITY BETTER      

04:21:14.759 --> 04:21:15.358
ACTUALLY A PLACE TO ELEVATE IT  
TO A HIGHER DENSITY BETTER      
VERSION OF THE THINGS WE'RE     

04:21:15.360 --> 04:21:16.092
TO A HIGHER DENSITY BETTER      
VERSION OF THE THINGS WE'RE     
TRYING TO PROTECT IN THE        

04:21:16.094 --> 04:21:16.492
VERSION OF THE THINGS WE'RE     
TRYING TO PROTECT IN THE        
DRIVERS RIGHT.                  

04:21:16.494 --> 04:21:17.426
TRYING TO PROTECT IN THE        
DRIVERS RIGHT.                  
I MEAN WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION 

04:21:17.428 --> 04:21:17.994
DRIVERS RIGHT.                  
I MEAN WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION 
WITH THE CONSULTANTS WHEN WHEN  

04:21:17.996 --> 04:21:18.661
I MEAN WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION 
WITH THE CONSULTANTS WHEN WHEN  
WE FIRST STARTED ALL OF THIS    

04:21:18.663 --> 04:21:19.461
WITH THE CONSULTANTS WHEN WHEN  
WE FIRST STARTED ALL OF THIS    
AND THEY INTRODUCED THE ZONES   

04:21:19.463 --> 04:21:20.196
WE FIRST STARTED ALL OF THIS    
AND THEY INTRODUCED THE ZONES   
BECAUSE WE BUT THEN THEY ONLY   

04:21:20.198 --> 04:21:20.530
AND THEY INTRODUCED THE ZONES   
BECAUSE WE BUT THEN THEY ONLY   
HAD FOUR.                       

04:21:20.532 --> 04:21:21.330
BECAUSE WE BUT THEN THEY ONLY   
HAD FOUR.                       
SO THAT WAS JUST TOO ABSTRACT   

04:21:21.332 --> 04:21:22.065
HAD FOUR.                       
SO THAT WAS JUST TOO ABSTRACT   
AND IT WAS A RECAPITULATION.    

04:21:22.067 --> 04:21:22.732
SO THAT WAS JUST TOO ABSTRACT   
AND IT WAS A RECAPITULATION.    
I WANT TO SEE THE LOGIC.        

04:21:22.734 --> 04:21:23.465
AND IT WAS A RECAPITULATION.    
I WANT TO SEE THE LOGIC.        
HERE'S THE SEQUENCE WE USED TO  

04:21:23.467 --> 04:21:24.200
I WANT TO SEE THE LOGIC.        
HERE'S THE SEQUENCE WE USED TO  
LAY OUT IN THE IN THE KIND      

04:21:24.202 --> 04:21:24.868
HERE'S THE SEQUENCE WE USED TO  
LAY OUT IN THE IN THE KIND      
OF PROTEAU THE ALGORITHM WE     

04:21:24.870 --> 04:21:25.334
LAY OUT IN THE IN THE KIND      
OF PROTEAU THE ALGORITHM WE     
STEPPED THROUGH.                

04:21:25.336 --> 04:21:26.069
OF PROTEAU THE ALGORITHM WE     
STEPPED THROUGH.                
I'M USING BIG WORDS RIGHT NOW   

04:21:26.071 --> 04:21:27.970
STEPPED THROUGH.                
I'M USING BIG WORDS RIGHT NOW   
BUT HERE'S THE SEQUENCE WE STEP 

04:21:27.972 --> 04:21:28.638
I'M USING BIG WORDS RIGHT NOW   
BUT HERE'S THE SEQUENCE WE STEP 
THROUGH TO FINALLY DECIDE       

04:21:28.640 --> 04:21:31.174
BUT HERE'S THE SEQUENCE WE STEP 
THROUGH TO FINALLY DECIDE       
WHAT'S GOING TO BE LOW RISE.    

04:21:31.176 --> 04:21:32.408
THROUGH TO FINALLY DECIDE       
WHAT'S GOING TO BE LOW RISE.    
IT'S GOING TO BE AND HERE'S WHY 

04:21:32.410 --> 04:21:33.342
WHAT'S GOING TO BE LOW RISE.    
IT'S GOING TO BE AND HERE'S WHY 
THIS MAP FELL OUT THE WAY IT    

04:21:33.344 --> 04:21:35.311
IT'S GOING TO BE AND HERE'S WHY 
THIS MAP FELL OUT THE WAY IT    
DID.                            

04:21:35.313 --> 04:21:36.579
THIS MAP FELL OUT THE WAY IT    
DID.                            
AND THEN THE FINAL POINT I WANT 

04:21:36.581 --> 04:21:37.346
DID.                            
AND THEN THE FINAL POINT I WANT 
TO MAKE IS THE COMMENTERS WE'VE 

04:21:37.348 --> 04:21:39.715
AND THEN THE FINAL POINT I WANT 
TO MAKE IS THE COMMENTERS WE'VE 
HEARD FROM OUR POINTING OUT     

04:21:39.717 --> 04:21:40.416
TO MAKE IS THE COMMENTERS WE'VE 
HEARD FROM OUR POINTING OUT     
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WHAT'S   

04:21:40.418 --> 04:21:43.152
HEARD FROM OUR POINTING OUT     
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WHAT'S   
CURRENTLY THERE IS MORE DENSE   

04:21:43.154 --> 04:21:44.086
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WHAT'S   
CURRENTLY THERE IS MORE DENSE   
AND WHAT WOULD BE SUGGESTED BY  

04:21:44.088 --> 04:21:44.753
CURRENTLY THERE IS MORE DENSE   
AND WHAT WOULD BE SUGGESTED BY  
WHAT'S GETTING SHOWN ON THE     

04:21:44.755 --> 04:21:45.287
AND WHAT WOULD BE SUGGESTED BY  
WHAT'S GETTING SHOWN ON THE     
FUTURE LANDY'S MAP.             

04:21:45.289 --> 04:21:47.924
WHAT'S GETTING SHOWN ON THE     
FUTURE LANDY'S MAP.             
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, DO    

04:21:47.926 --> 04:21:48.191
FUTURE LANDY'S MAP.             
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, DO    
WE?                             

04:21:48.193 --> 04:21:49.291
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, DO    
WE?                             
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK  

04:21:49.293 --> 04:21:50.660
WE?                             
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK  
AND REVISIT SOME OF THE         

04:21:50.662 --> 04:21:51.527
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK  
AND REVISIT SOME OF THE         
DECISIONS TO MAKE SURE TO MAKE  

04:21:51.529 --> 04:21:52.261
AND REVISIT SOME OF THE         
DECISIONS TO MAKE SURE TO MAKE  
SURE THAT IN PARTICULAR DOESN'T 

04:21:52.263 --> 04:21:55.130
DECISIONS TO MAKE SURE TO MAKE  
SURE THAT IN PARTICULAR DOESN'T 
END LIKE SOMETHING WE TURN      

04:21:55.132 --> 04:21:55.932
SURE THAT IN PARTICULAR DOESN'T 
END LIKE SOMETHING WE TURN      
NONCONFORMING ALL OF A SUDDEN   

04:21:55.934 --> 04:21:59.001
END LIKE SOMETHING WE TURN      
NONCONFORMING ALL OF A SUDDEN   
THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY CONCERN 

04:21:59.003 --> 04:22:02.171
NONCONFORMING ALL OF A SUDDEN   
THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY CONCERN 
WITH THIS IS DO WE CREATE NEW   

04:22:02.173 --> 04:22:02.705
THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY CONCERN 
WITH THIS IS DO WE CREATE NEW   
NONCONFORMITY?                  

04:22:02.707 --> 04:22:06.575
WITH THIS IS DO WE CREATE NEW   
NONCONFORMITY?                  
SO WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL AS A   

04:22:06.577 --> 04:22:07.009
NONCONFORMITY?                  
SO WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL AS A   
CREATOR?                        

04:22:07.011 --> 04:22:09.511
SO WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL AS A   
CREATOR?                        
WELL, YES WE YES WE KNOW TO     

04:22:09.513 --> 04:22:10.213
CREATOR?                        
WELL, YES WE YES WE KNOW TO     
JUST CHOOSE A PLACE THAT'S      

04:22:10.215 --> 04:22:10.747
WELL, YES WE YES WE KNOW TO     
JUST CHOOSE A PLACE THAT'S      
PRETTY DENSE.                   

04:22:10.749 --> 04:22:13.616
JUST CHOOSE A PLACE THAT'S      
PRETTY DENSE.                   
BUT THE PLAN AS RIGHT.          

04:22:13.618 --> 04:22:14.049
PRETTY DENSE.                   
BUT THE PLAN AS RIGHT.          
RIGHT.                          

04:22:14.051 --> 04:22:17.854
BUT THE PLAN AS RIGHT.          
RIGHT.                          
BUT MAYBE BUT I DON'T WANT US   

04:22:17.856 --> 04:22:18.520
RIGHT.                          
BUT MAYBE BUT I DON'T WANT US   
TO CONFLATE THIS.               

04:22:18.522 --> 04:22:21.523
BUT MAYBE BUT I DON'T WANT US   
TO CONFLATE THIS.               
COULD WE JUST STAY FOCUSED ON   

04:22:21.525 --> 04:22:22.458
TO CONFLATE THIS.               
COULD WE JUST STAY FOCUSED ON   
SURE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN       

04:22:22.460 --> 04:22:23.159
COULD WE JUST STAY FOCUSED ON   
SURE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN       
FINISH THIS AND THEN GO ON TO   

04:22:23.161 --> 04:22:25.461
SURE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN       
FINISH THIS AND THEN GO ON TO   
THE NEXT THING SO RIGHT.        

04:22:25.463 --> 04:22:26.395
FINISH THIS AND THEN GO ON TO   
THE NEXT THING SO RIGHT.        
AND MAYBE TONIGHT ISN'T THE     

04:22:26.397 --> 04:22:28.331
THE NEXT THING SO RIGHT.        
AND MAYBE TONIGHT ISN'T THE     
NIGHT TO TALK ABOUT BIGMAN BUT  

04:22:28.333 --> 04:22:33.636
AND MAYBE TONIGHT ISN'T THE     
NIGHT TO TALK ABOUT BIGMAN BUT  
SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT WE  

04:22:33.638 --> 04:22:34.437
NIGHT TO TALK ABOUT BIGMAN BUT  
SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT WE  
WANT TO SPELL OUT THE LOGIC.    

04:22:34.439 --> 04:22:34.803
SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT WE  
WANT TO SPELL OUT THE LOGIC.    
YES.                            

04:22:34.805 --> 04:22:37.439
WANT TO SPELL OUT THE LOGIC.    
YES.                            
IT WAS IT WAS ROUGHLY AH WHEN   

04:22:37.441 --> 04:22:40.977
YES.                            
IT WAS IT WAS ROUGHLY AH WHEN   
OUR TWO WENT TO LOW RISE FOR    

04:22:40.979 --> 04:22:41.644
IT WAS IT WAS ROUGHLY AH WHEN   
OUR TWO WENT TO LOW RISE FOR    
OUR FOUR CORRIDORS BECAME       

04:22:41.646 --> 04:22:44.848
OUR TWO WENT TO LOW RISE FOR    
OUR FOUR CORRIDORS BECAME       
TRANSITION BUT THEN YEAH OUR    

04:22:44.850 --> 04:22:48.350
OUR FOUR CORRIDORS BECAME       
TRANSITION BUT THEN YEAH OUR    
FOUR CORRIDORS BECAUSE THAT     

04:22:48.352 --> 04:22:49.085
TRANSITION BUT THEN YEAH OUR    
FOUR CORRIDORS BECAUSE THAT     
PUTS THE EXISTING ZONING        

04:22:49.087 --> 04:22:52.355
FOUR CORRIDORS BECAUSE THAT     
PUTS THE EXISTING ZONING        
TOGETHER WITH THE CONSIDERATION 

04:22:52.357 --> 04:22:53.155
PUTS THE EXISTING ZONING        
TOGETHER WITH THE CONSIDERATION 
OF TRANSIT AND THEN THERE'S A   

04:22:53.157 --> 04:22:53.690
TOGETHER WITH THE CONSIDERATION 
OF TRANSIT AND THEN THERE'S A   
PRINCIPLE THAT'S BEEN           

04:22:53.692 --> 04:22:56.759
OF TRANSIT AND THEN THERE'S A   
PRINCIPLE THAT'S BEEN           
INTRODUCED WHICH IS DENSITY CAN 

04:22:56.761 --> 04:22:59.695
PRINCIPLE THAT'S BEEN           
INTRODUCED WHICH IS DENSITY CAN 
BE ADDED BUT NOT SUBTRACTED.    

04:22:59.697 --> 04:23:00.697
INTRODUCED WHICH IS DENSITY CAN 
BE ADDED BUT NOT SUBTRACTED.    
>> SO I HATE THE WORDS UP       

04:23:00.699 --> 04:23:03.466
BE ADDED BUT NOT SUBTRACTED.    
>> SO I HATE THE WORDS UP       
ZONING AND DOWN ZONING BUT      

04:23:03.468 --> 04:23:04.300
>> SO I HATE THE WORDS UP       
ZONING AND DOWN ZONING BUT      
THERE CAN BE UP ZONING BUT      

04:23:04.302 --> 04:23:07.937
ZONING AND DOWN ZONING BUT      
THERE CAN BE UP ZONING BUT      
THERE WILL NOT DOWN ZONING AND  

04:23:07.939 --> 04:23:08.738
THERE CAN BE UP ZONING BUT      
THERE WILL NOT DOWN ZONING AND  
THAT IS CORRECT BECAUSE THE     

04:23:08.740 --> 04:23:11.374
THERE WILL NOT DOWN ZONING AND  
THAT IS CORRECT BECAUSE THE     
DOWN ZONE IS TO MAKE HOUSING    

04:23:11.376 --> 04:23:11.974
THAT IS CORRECT BECAUSE THE     
DOWN ZONE IS TO MAKE HOUSING    
MORE EXPENSIVE.                 

04:23:11.976 --> 04:23:12.775
DOWN ZONE IS TO MAKE HOUSING    
MORE EXPENSIVE.                 
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S NOTHING 

04:23:12.777 --> 04:23:14.777
MORE EXPENSIVE.                 
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S NOTHING 
WRONG WITH THAT AND THEN        

04:23:14.779 --> 04:23:19.982
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S NOTHING 
WRONG WITH THAT AND THEN        
THERE'S ALL THE HISTORIC WE ARE 

04:23:19.984 --> 04:23:20.649
WRONG WITH THAT AND THEN        
THERE'S ALL THE HISTORIC WE ARE 
PRESERVING THE HISTORIC         

04:23:20.651 --> 04:23:22.718
THERE'S ALL THE HISTORIC WE ARE 
PRESERVING THE HISTORIC         
DISTRICTS.                      

04:23:22.720 --> 04:23:23.753
PRESERVING THE HISTORIC         
DISTRICTS.

IT'S NOT IT'S WAY WAY AT THE    
BEGINNING BARTTER ACKNOWLEDGE   

04:23:45.777 --> 04:23:46.476
IT'S NOT IT'S WAY WAY AT THE    
BEGINNING BARTTER ACKNOWLEDGE   
THAT THEY EXIST OK?             

04:23:46.478 --> 04:23:50.446
BEGINNING BARTTER ACKNOWLEDGE   
THAT THEY EXIST OK?

ARE GOING TO FLUSTER BUT BUT    
THAT THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS     

04:24:01.425 --> 04:24:04.560
ARE GOING TO FLUSTER BUT BUT    
THAT THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS     
SHOULD BE AS A GROUP TREATED

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE.           
THERE IS AN AREA OF THE CITY

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE.           
THERE IS AN AREA OF THE CITY    
THAT IS ZONED OUR FORESE WHAT   

04:24:57.816 --> 04:24:58.748
THERE IS AN AREA OF THE CITY    
THAT IS ZONED OUR FORESE WHAT   
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BY THE  

04:24:58.750 --> 04:24:59.482
THAT IS ZONED OUR FORESE WHAT   
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BY THE  
CONVENTION THAT WE BUILT OUT    

04:24:59.484 --> 04:25:02.217
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BY THE  
CONVENTION THAT WE BUILT OUT    
OF THIS PLAN WITH MY LARGELY GO 

04:25:02.219 --> 04:25:03.052
CONVENTION THAT WE BUILT OUT    
OF THIS PLAN WITH MY LARGELY GO 
TO A MIXED USE TRANSITION TO    

04:25:03.054 --> 04:25:06.455
OF THIS PLAN WITH MY LARGELY GO 
TO A MIXED USE TRANSITION TO    
THAT SAME AREA HAS A BUILDING   

04:25:06.457 --> 04:25:09.691
TO A MIXED USE TRANSITION TO    
THAT SAME AREA HAS A BUILDING   
THAT IS FIFTEEN STORIES HIGH    

04:25:09.693 --> 04:25:10.592
THAT SAME AREA HAS A BUILDING   
THAT IS FIFTEEN STORIES HIGH    
THAT WOULD ONLY BE PERMISSIBLE  

04:25:10.594 --> 04:25:11.126
THAT IS FIFTEEN STORIES HIGH    
THAT WOULD ONLY BE PERMISSIBLE  
IN THE HUB DISTRICT.            

04:25:11.128 --> 04:25:14.530
THAT WOULD ONLY BE PERMISSIBLE  
IN THE HUB DISTRICT.            
SO IS YOUR PREMISE THEN THAT WE 

04:25:14.532 --> 04:25:15.264
IN THE HUB DISTRICT.            
SO IS YOUR PREMISE THEN THAT WE 
WOULD NOT WANT TO DESIGNATE     

04:25:15.266 --> 04:25:17.500
SO IS YOUR PREMISE THEN THAT WE 
WOULD NOT WANT TO DESIGNATE     
THAT PARTICULAR AIR OR C AREA   

04:25:17.502 --> 04:25:18.300
WOULD NOT WANT TO DESIGNATE     
THAT PARTICULAR AIR OR C AREA   
TO TRANSITION BECAUSE WE WOULD  

04:25:18.302 --> 04:25:18.967
THAT PARTICULAR AIR OR C AREA   
TO TRANSITION BECAUSE WE WOULD  
NEVER WANT TO DESIGNATE A       

04:25:18.969 --> 04:25:20.770
TO TRANSITION BECAUSE WE WOULD  
NEVER WANT TO DESIGNATE A       
LANDY'S WHERE THEY MIGHT CREATE 

04:25:20.772 --> 04:25:21.304
NEVER WANT TO DESIGNATE A       
LANDY'S WHERE THEY MIGHT CREATE 
NONCONFORMITY?                  

04:25:21.306 --> 04:25:22.438
LANDY'S WHERE THEY MIGHT CREATE 
NONCONFORMITY?                  
>> I WAS NOT STARTING TO TALK   

04:25:22.440 --> 04:25:25.541
NONCONFORMITY?                  
>> I WAS NOT STARTING TO TALK   
ABOUT NONCONFORMITY AT ALL.     

04:25:25.543 --> 04:25:26.409
>> I WAS NOT STARTING TO TALK   
ABOUT NONCONFORMITY AT ALL.     
>> I ASK NO, NO.                

04:25:26.411 --> 04:25:27.409
ABOUT NONCONFORMITY AT ALL.     
>> I ASK NO, NO.                
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LAND USE  

04:25:27.411 --> 04:25:27.743
>> I ASK NO, NO.                
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LAND USE  
PLAN.                           

04:25:27.745 --> 04:25:29.612
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LAND USE  
PLAN.                           
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  

04:25:29.614 --> 04:25:30.512
PLAN.                           
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  
WAS RAISED IS THAT THIS PLAN IS 

04:25:30.514 --> 04:25:32.882
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  
WAS RAISED IS THAT THIS PLAN IS 
RECOMMENDING LOWER SCALE        

04:25:32.884 --> 04:25:33.749
WAS RAISED IS THAT THIS PLAN IS 
RECOMMENDING LOWER SCALE        
DEVELOPMENT THAN SOME EXISTING. 

04:25:33.751 --> 04:25:34.584
RECOMMENDING LOWER SCALE        
DEVELOPMENT THAN SOME EXISTING. 
AND SO IN THAT SCENARIO THAT I  

04:25:34.586 --> 04:25:37.520
DEVELOPMENT THAN SOME EXISTING. 
AND SO IN THAT SCENARIO THAT I  
JUST GAVE, CAN YOU FROM YOUR    

04:25:37.522 --> 04:25:40.055
AND SO IN THAT SCENARIO THAT I

DECISIONS ON THE MAP THAT'S

YOU DIRECT ME TO MAKE THOSE     
DECISIONS ON THE MAP THAT'S     
PRESENTED TO YOU?               

04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:47.063
DECISIONS ON THE MAP THAT'S     
PRESENTED TO YOU?               
>> SO I WOULD START BECAUSE I   

04:25:47.065 --> 04:25:48.598

SO I'M WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCT 
WE HAVE FIVE ZONING DISTRICTS   

04:25:56.707 --> 04:26:00.309
SO I'M WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCT 
WE HAVE FIVE ZONING DISTRICTS   
AND THEY HAVE BEEN LAID HERE IF

WE HAVE FIVE ZONING DISTRICTS   
AND THEY HAVE BEEN LAID HERE IF 
WE LAND WELL FOR PLUS LET ME

04:28:16.680 --> 04:28:20.015
THIS BUT THIS WILL BE SO TO ME  
IN THAT CASE THEN THEN I WOULD  
JUST GO LOW RISE TO HUB AND     

04:28:20.017 --> 04:28:23.719
IN THAT CASE THEN THEN I WOULD  
JUST GO LOW RISE TO HUB AND     
THEN YOU YOU STEP ACTS TO DEAL  

04:28:23.721 --> 04:28:24.420
JUST GO LOW RISE TO HUB AND     
THEN YOU YOU STEP ACTS TO DEAL  
WITH THE TRANSITION AS OPPOSED  

04:28:24.422 --> 04:28:27.422
THEN YOU YOU STEP ACTS TO DEAL  
WITH THE TRANSITION AS OPPOSED  
TO HAVING A FORCE TRANSITION.   

04:28:27.424 --> 04:28:28.490
WITH THE TRANSITION AS OPPOSED  
TO HAVING A FORCE TRANSITION.   
SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD ANSWER    

04:28:28.492 --> 04:28:29.158
TO HAVING A FORCE TRANSITION.   
SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD ANSWER    
YOUR QUESTION OR I WOULD GIVE   

04:28:29.160 --> 04:28:30.993
SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD ANSWER    
YOUR QUESTION OR I WOULD GIVE   
YOU ADVICE FOR THAT BECAUSE I   

04:28:30.995 --> 04:28:31.927
YOUR QUESTION OR I WOULD GIVE   
YOU ADVICE FOR THAT BECAUSE I   
DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE TO DO A 

04:28:31.929 --> 04:28:32.894
YOU ADVICE FOR THAT BECAUSE I   
DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE TO DO A 
PUDI WHICH IS WHAT THEY HAD TO  

04:28:32.896 --> 04:28:38.233
DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE TO DO A 
PUDI WHICH IS WHAT THEY HAD TO  
DO BUT THAT GOT TO ZONING SORRY 

04:28:38.235 --> 04:28:39.335
PUDI WHICH IS WHAT THEY HAD TO  
DO BUT THAT GOT TO ZONING SORRY 
BUT THAT SAME DECISION MIGHT BE 

04:28:39.337 --> 04:28:42.771
DO BUT THAT GOT TO ZONING SORRY 
BUT THAT SAME DECISION MIGHT BE 
REPLICATED MULTIPLE PLACES AND  

04:28:42.773 --> 04:28:46.308
BUT THAT SAME DECISION MIGHT BE 
REPLICATED MULTIPLE PLACES AND  
SO I THINK THAT WHICH THEN JUST 

04:28:46.310 --> 04:28:47.376
REPLICATED MULTIPLE PLACES AND  
SO I THINK THAT WHICH THEN JUST 
GETS US TO TO TWO DISTRICTS WE  

04:28:47.378 --> 04:28:50.012
SO I THINK THAT WHICH THEN JUST 
GETS US TO TO TWO DISTRICTS WE  
HAVE LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL AND   

04:28:50.014 --> 04:28:50.946
GETS US TO TO TWO DISTRICTS WE  
HAVE LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL AND   
WE JUST HAVE HUPP WHICH IS WHAT

WE JUST HAVE HUPP WHICH IS WHAT 
I ADVOCATED VERY, VERY EARLY

DIFFERENT SENSIBILITIES THAN I  
DO FOR THIS.                    
BUT THE THE IDEA THAT WE NOW    

04:45:36.353 --> 04:45:39.754
DO FOR THIS.                    
BUT THE THE IDEA THAT WE NOW    
HAVE A SEVENTEEN STOREY         

04:45:39.756 --> 04:45:40.554
BUT THE THE IDEA THAT WE NOW    
HAVE A SEVENTEEN STOREY         
BUILDING AND A THIRTEEN STOREY  

04:45:40.556 --> 04:45:41.289
HAVE A SEVENTEEN STOREY

BUILDING AND A DEVELOPER COMES  
AND SAYS I WANT TO BUILD THE    
NEXT ONE AND WE SAY NO YOU CAN  

04:45:44.560 --> 04:45:47.094
AND SAYS I WANT TO BUILD THE    
NEXT ONE AND WE SAY NO YOU CAN  
ONLY GO TO EIGHTY THAT THAT     

04:45:47.096 --> 04:45:47.796
NEXT ONE AND WE SAY NO YOU CAN  
ONLY GO TO EIGHTY THAT THAT     
STILL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.       

04:45:47.798 --> 04:45:51.198
ONLY GO TO EIGHTY THAT THAT     
STILL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.       
SO I THINK IF IF WE ARE TRYING  

04:45:51.200 --> 04:45:51.799
STILL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.       
SO I THINK IF IF WE ARE TRYING  
TO ACHIEVE WHAT YOU JUST        

04:45:51.801 --> 04:45:55.136

04:46:07.484 --> 04:46:08.215
THE FIRST REVISION TO TAKE AN

THAT IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL     
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT ON
