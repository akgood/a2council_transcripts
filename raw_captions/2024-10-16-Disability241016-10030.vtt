AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT AND IF 
I HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF TIME I'D  

00:15:00.975 --> 00:15:02.809

SO THEY EVENTUALLY CUT OUT THE  
ENTIRE BOTTOM.                  

00:15:10.584 --> 00:15:11.617
SO THEY EVENTUALLY CUT OUT THE

THAT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU STILL   

00:18:54.742 --> 00:18:57.276
UTILIZING THE STEERING WHEEL.   
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU STILL   
HAVE THE TRUNK SPACE IN THE

00:18:58.546 --> 00:19:01.280
BACK WHEREAS YOU WOULDN'T       
NATURALLY IN A REAR ENTRY       
WHEREAS REAR ENTRY IT'S MORE    

00:19:01.282 --> 00:19:02.114
NATURALLY IN A REAR ENTRY       
WHEREAS REAR ENTRY IT'S MORE    
ABOUT JUST GETTING THAT PERSON  

00:19:02.116 --> 00:19:02.648

INSIDE THE VEHICLE.             

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.383
ABOUT JUST GETTING THAT PERSON  
INSIDE THE VEHICLE.             
THERE'S ALWAYS FOLD-OUT AND IN  

00:19:04.385 --> 00:19:05.183
INSIDE THE VEHICLE.             
THERE'S ALWAYS FOLD-OUT AND IN  
FLOOR RAMPS FOLD-OUT RAMPS CAN  

00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:08.553
THERE'S ALWAYS FOLD-OUT AND IN  
FLOOR RAMPS FOLD-OUT RAMPS CAN  
DEPLOY ANY CURVE HEIGHT AND IN  

00:19:08.555 --> 00:19:09.222
FLOOR RAMPS FOLD-OUT RAMPS CAN  
DEPLOY ANY CURVE HEIGHT AND IN  
FLOOR RAMPS ARE GREAT BECAUSE A 

00:19:09.224 --> 00:19:11.757
DEPLOY ANY CURVE HEIGHT AND IN  
FLOOR RAMPS ARE GREAT BECAUSE A 
LITTLE BIT SLEEKER DESIGNS YOU  

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:12.825
FLOOR RAMPS ARE GREAT BECAUSE A 
LITTLE BIT SLEEKER DESIGNS YOU  
CAN USE BOTH SIDES OF THE       

00:19:12.827 --> 00:19:13.492
LITTLE BIT SLEEKER DESIGNS YOU  
CAN USE BOTH SIDES OF THE       
VEHICLE WITHOUT HAVING TO       

00:19:13.494 --> 00:19:15.861
CAN USE BOTH SIDES OF THE       
VEHICLE WITHOUT HAVING TO       
DEPLOY THAT RAMP BUT BOTH CAN   

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:16.562
VEHICLE WITHOUT HAVING TO       
DEPLOY THAT RAMP BUT BOTH CAN   
BE UTILIZED EVEN WITHOUT        

00:19:16.564 --> 00:19:16.896
DEPLOY THAT RAMP BUT BOTH CAN   
BE UTILIZED EVEN WITHOUT        
ELECTRIC.                       

00:19:16.898 --> 00:19:17.563
BE UTILIZED EVEN WITHOUT        
ELECTRIC.                       
SO THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL       

00:19:17.565 --> 00:19:20.099
ELECTRIC.                       
SO THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL       
FAILURE INSIDE THE VEHICLE.     

00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:21.233
SO THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL       
FAILURE INSIDE THE VEHICLE.     
BOTH RAMPS CAN DEPLOY AND THEY  

00:19:21.235 --> 00:19:22.033
FAILURE INSIDE THE VEHICLE.     
BOTH RAMPS CAN DEPLOY AND THEY  
HAVE A THOUSAND POUND CAPACITY  

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:24.203
BOTH RAMPS CAN DEPLOY AND THEY  
HAVE A THOUSAND POUND CAPACITY  
NOW BECAUSE MOST POWER          

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:24.937
HAVE A THOUSAND POUND CAPACITY  
NOW BECAUSE MOST POWER          
WHEELCHAIRS ARE FOUR HUNDRED    

00:19:24.939 --> 00:19:27.740
NOW BECAUSE MOST POWER          
WHEELCHAIRS ARE FOUR HUNDRED    
POUNDS HAVING THAT ADDITIONAL   

00:19:27.742 --> 00:19:28.607
WHEELCHAIRS ARE FOUR HUNDRED    
POUNDS HAVING THAT ADDITIONAL   
ALLOWS THE PERSON IN THE        

00:19:28.609 --> 00:19:29.341
POUNDS HAVING THAT ADDITIONAL   
ALLOWS THE PERSON IN THE

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:36.382
ON THE INSIDE NOW THE RUBBER    
FLOORING THEY'RE VERY EASY TO   
CLEAN AND THERE ARE WHEELCHAIR  

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:37.116
FLOORING THEY'RE VERY EASY TO
