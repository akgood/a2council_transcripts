01:04:54.647 --> 01:04:55.379
PERSON IS FROM.                 
AND SO AGAIN, IT WAS LIKE A     
LITTLE UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS IS  

01:04:55.381 --> 01:04:57.849
AND SO AGAIN, IT WAS LIKE A     
LITTLE UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS IS  
THE TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT    

01:04:57.851 --> 01:04:58.649
LITTLE UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS IS  
THE TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT    
COULD PASS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL   

01:04:58.651 --> 01:05:01.718
THE TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT    
COULD PASS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL   
BUT THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER TYPE  

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.123
COULD PASS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL   
BUT THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER TYPE  
OF LEGISLATION TO POTENTIALLY   

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:09.226
BUT THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER TYPE  
OF LEGISLATION TO POTENTIALLY   
LOOK INTO THE OTHER SUGGESTION  

01:05:09.228 --> 01:05:10.661
OF LEGISLATION TO POTENTIALLY   
LOOK INTO THE OTHER SUGGESTION  
WAS, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT  

01:05:10.663 --> 01:05:11.095
LOOK INTO THE OTHER SUGGESTION  
WAS, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT  
OF ISSUES THAT                  

01:05:11.097 --> 01:05:13.430

01:05:17.703 --> 01:05:18.603
LGBTQ COMMUNITY THAT AREN&apos;T     
NECESSARILY LGBTQ SPECIFIC.     
SO WE TALKED ABOUT I THINK

NOT PASS AT THE TIME.           

01:05:26.679 --> 01:05:30.013
ARBOR FOR INSTANCE AND THAT DID 
NOT PASS AT THE TIME.           
BUT YOU KNOW, THAT IS SOMETHING 

01:05:30.015 --> 01:05:30.748
NOT PASS AT THE TIME.           
BUT YOU KNOW, THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS
