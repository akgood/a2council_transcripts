I ACTUALLY SAID THIS IN AN      

00:08:28.598 --> 00:08:29.464
THAT&amp;apos;S WRONG.                   
I ACTUALLY SAID THIS IN AN

00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:31.932
ABOUT OUR DIFFERENT PROJECT THE 
SEVENTH GREENVIEW ONE.          
BUT WHEN YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT STREET      

00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:32.633
SEVENTH GREENVIEW ONE.          
BUT WHEN YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT STREET      
PARKING THE DESIGN HAS TO       

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:35.270
BUT WHEN YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT STREET      
PARKING THE DESIGN HAS TO       
CHANGE WHEN YOU SWITCH FROM     

00:08:35.272 --> 00:08:36.004
PARKING THE DESIGN HAS TO       
CHANGE WHEN YOU SWITCH FROM     
BUFFORD BIKE LANES TO PROTECT   

00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:39.040
CHANGE WHEN YOU SWITCH FROM     
BUFFORD BIKE LANES TO PROTECT   
BIKE LANES AND I&amp;apos;M NOT EVEN     

00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:39.908
BUFFORD BIKE LANES TO PROTECT   
BIKE LANES AND I&amp;apos;M NOT EVEN     
SURE THERE&amp;apos;S ENOUGH FOR THAT ON 

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.844
BIKE LANES AND I&amp;apos;M NOT EVEN     
SURE THERE&amp;apos;S ENOUGH FOR THAT ON 
THIS STRETCH OF ROAD ANYWAY.    

00:08:42.846 --> 00:08:43.778
SURE THERE&amp;apos;S ENOUGH FOR THAT ON 
THIS STRETCH OF ROAD ANYWAY.    
SO OF COURSE YOU COULD COME     

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.446
THIS STRETCH OF ROAD ANYWAY.    
SO OF COURSE YOU COULD COME     
BACK AND RESHAPE EVERYTHING     

00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:47.214
SO OF COURSE YOU COULD COME     
BACK AND RESHAPE EVERYTHING     
LATER BUT THAT&amp;apos;S NOT FREE.      

00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:48.182
BACK AND RESHAPE EVERYTHING     
LATER BUT THAT&amp;apos;S NOT FREE.      
SO IT SEEMS LIKE NOW IT&amp;apos;S       

00:08:48.184 --> 00:08:48.817
LATER BUT THAT&amp;apos;S NOT FREE.      
SO IT SEEMS LIKE NOW IT&amp;apos;S       
REALLY THE BEST TIME TO TO      

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:50.551
SO IT SEEMS LIKE NOW IT&amp;apos;S       
REALLY THE BEST TIME TO TO      
CONSIDER MAKING A CHANGE LIKE   

00:08:50.553 --> 00:08:50.885
REALLY THE BEST TIME TO TO      
CONSIDER MAKING A CHANGE LIKE   
THIS.                           

00:08:50.887 --> 00:08:52.019
CONSIDER MAKING A CHANGE LIKE   
THIS.                           
ALSO I&amp;apos;D SAY I BIKE THE STRETCH 

00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:54.489
THIS.                           
ALSO I&amp;apos;D SAY I BIKE THE STRETCH 
LIKE AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK AND  

00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:55.156
ALSO I&amp;apos;D SAY I BIKE THE STRETCH 
LIKE AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK AND  
THAT PARALLEL PARKING SOUTH     

00:08:55.158 --> 00:08:57.859
LIKE AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK AND  
THAT PARALLEL PARKING SOUTH     
OF HOOVER IT&amp;apos;S USUALLY ALMOST   

00:08:57.861 --> 00:08:58.192
THAT PARALLEL PARKING SOUTH     
OF HOOVER IT&amp;apos;S USUALLY ALMOST   
EMPTY.                          

00:08:58.194 --> 00:08:58.993
OF HOOVER IT&amp;apos;S USUALLY ALMOST   
EMPTY.                          
SO ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHY WHY  

00:08:58.995 --> 00:08:59.794
EMPTY.                          
SO ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHY WHY

00:28:40.009 --> 00:28:40.941
ONES THAT ALREADY HAVE BUFFERS  
WITH VERTICAL DELINEATOR        
BECAUSE WE CAN DO THAT          

00:28:40.943 --> 00:28:41.475
WITH VERTICAL DELINEATOR        
BECAUSE WE CAN DO THAT          
RELATIVELY QUICKLY.

VERTICAL DELINEATOR IN THEN     

00:28:45.847 --> 00:28:46.546
BUT THEN IF WE PUT THOSE        
VERTICAL DELINEATOR IN THEN     
THERE&amp;apos;S THIS ISSUE ABOUT        

00:28:46.548 --> 00:28:48.515
VERTICAL DELINEATOR IN THEN     
THERE&amp;apos;S THIS ISSUE ABOUT        
WHETHER WE CAN SWEEP THEM AND   

00:28:48.517 --> 00:28:49.383
THERE&amp;apos;S THIS ISSUE ABOUT        
WHETHER WE CAN SWEEP THEM AND   
PLOW THEM BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE 

00:28:49.385 --> 00:28:50.016
WHETHER WE CAN SWEEP THEM AND   
PLOW THEM BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE

ELECTRIC ONES ARE GOING TO TAKE 

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.578
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE         
ELECTRIC ONES ARE GOING TO TAKE 
EVEN LONGER TO GET TO TO BRET&amp;apos;S 

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.647
ELECTRIC ONES ARE GOING TO TAKE 
EVEN LONGER TO GET TO TO BRET&amp;apos;S 
POINT, THE CITY NOW HAS A GREEN 

00:31:01.649 --> 00:31:02.481
EVEN LONGER TO GET TO TO BRET&amp;apos;S 
POINT, THE CITY NOW HAS A GREEN 
FLEET POLICY WHERE WE WERE      

00:31:02.483 --> 00:31:03.083
POINT, THE CITY NOW HAS A GREEN 
FLEET POLICY WHERE WE WERE      
TRYING TO TAKE ALL CITY         

00:31:03.085 --> 00:31:06.119
FLEET POLICY WHERE WE WERE      
TRYING TO TAKE ALL CITY         
VEHICLES AND TRANSITION THEM    

00:31:06.121 --> 00:31:06.986
TRYING TO TAKE ALL CITY         
VEHICLES AND TRANSITION THEM    
OVER TO ELECTRIC TO HELP MEET   

00:31:06.988 --> 00:31:10.023
VEHICLES AND TRANSITION THEM    
OVER TO ELECTRIC TO HELP MEET   
OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.    

00:31:10.025 --> 00:31:11.090
OVER TO ELECTRIC TO HELP MEET   
OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.    
SO THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT      

00:31:11.092 --> 00:31:13.693
OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.    
SO THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT      
SINCE IT WOULD BE A NEW PIECE   

00:31:13.695 --> 00:31:14.427
SO THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT      
SINCE IT WOULD BE A NEW PIECE   
OF EQUIPMENT WOULD FALL UNDER   

00:31:14.429 --> 00:31:16.996
SINCE IT WOULD BE A NEW PIECE   
OF EQUIPMENT WOULD FALL UNDER   
THAT GREEN FLEET PROCUREMENT OR 

00:31:16.998 --> 00:31:17.764
OF EQUIPMENT WOULD FALL UNDER   
THAT GREEN FLEET PROCUREMENT OR 
DESIRE TO GET AN ELECTRIC       

00:31:17.766 --> 00:31:20.801
THAT GREEN FLEET PROCUREMENT OR 
DESIRE TO GET AN ELECTRIC       
VEHICLE.                        

00:31:20.803 --> 00:31:21.968
DESIRE TO GET AN ELECTRIC       
VEHICLE.                        
THERE ARE NOT A LOT             

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.535
VEHICLE.                        
THERE ARE NOT A LOT             
OF MANUFACTURERS OF SMALLER     

00:31:22.537 --> 00:31:29.008
THERE ARE NOT A LOT             
OF MANUFACTURERS OF SMALLER     
ELECTRIC PLOWS AND SWEEPERS.    

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.010
OF MANUFACTURERS OF SMALLER     
ELECTRIC PLOWS AND SWEEPERS.    
THERE ARE SOME THE LAST I HEARD 

00:31:30.012 --> 00:31:32.945
ELECTRIC PLOWS AND SWEEPERS.    
THERE ARE SOME THE LAST I HEARD 
AND WE JUST MET ON THIS         

00:31:32.947 --> 00:31:33.713
THERE ARE SOME THE LAST I HEARD 
AND WE JUST MET ON THIS         
YESTERDAY WITH PUBLIC WORKS IS  

00:31:33.715 --> 00:31:36.249
AND WE JUST MET ON THIS         
YESTERDAY WITH PUBLIC WORKS IS  
THE LEAD TIME IS NOT            

00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:36.983
YESTERDAY WITH PUBLIC WORKS IS  
THE LEAD TIME IS NOT            
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAT    

00:31:36.985 --> 00:31:40.053
THE LEAD TIME IS NOT            
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAT    
EVEN THE DIESEL POWERED OR      

00:31:40.055 --> 00:31:40.720
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAT    
EVEN THE DIESEL POWERED OR      
GASOLINE POWERED ONES ARE       

00:31:40.722 --> 00:31:44.090
EVEN THE DIESEL POWERED OR      
GASOLINE POWERED ONES ARE       
ALMOST A YEAR OUT ON SOME       

00:31:44.092 --> 00:31:44.724
GASOLINE POWERED ONES ARE       
ALMOST A YEAR OUT ON SOME       
OF THAT EQUIPMENT BECAUSE       

00:31:44.726 --> 00:31:45.425
ALMOST A YEAR OUT ON SOME       
OF THAT EQUIPMENT BECAUSE       
EVERYTHING IS SUFFERING FROM    

00:31:45.427 --> 00:31:46.159
OF THAT EQUIPMENT BECAUSE       
EVERYTHING IS SUFFERING FROM    
THE SAME SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES.   

00:31:46.161 --> 00:31:48.361
EVERYTHING IS SUFFERING FROM    
THE SAME SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES.   
IT ALMOST IS A MATTER WITH      

00:31:48.363 --> 00:31:48.962
THE SAME SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES.   
IT ALMOST IS A MATTER WITH      
PROPULSION IS SO WHILE THERE    

00:31:48.964 --> 00:31:51.130
IT ALMOST IS A MATTER WITH      
PROPULSION IS SO WHILE THERE    
MAY BE LESS VENDORS THAT        

00:31:51.132 --> 00:31:52.031
PROPULSION IS SO WHILE THERE    
MAY BE LESS VENDORS THAT        
PRODUCE THIS, THEIR LEAD TIME   

00:31:52.033 --> 00:31:55.035
MAY BE LESS VENDORS THAT        
PRODUCE THIS, THEIR LEAD TIME   
IS FAIRLY SIMILAR.              

00:31:55.037 --> 00:31:56.069
PRODUCE THIS, THEIR LEAD TIME   
IS FAIRLY SIMILAR.              
MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF MONTHS     

00:31:56.071 --> 00:31:56.803
IS FAIRLY SIMILAR.              
MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF MONTHS     
DIFFERENT BUT IT&amp;apos;S NOT A YEAR   

00:31:56.805 --> 00:31:59.105
MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF MONTHS     
DIFFERENT BUT IT&amp;apos;S NOT A YEAR   
AND DIFFERENCE.                 

00:31:59.107 --> 00:32:00.273
DIFFERENT BUT IT&amp;apos;S NOT A YEAR   
AND DIFFERENCE.                 
SO I THINK THE LEAD TIME IS     

00:32:00.275 --> 00:32:02.175
AND DIFFERENCE.                 
SO I THINK THE LEAD TIME IS     
KIND OF INCONSEQUENTIAL.        

00:32:02.177 --> 00:32:06.913
SO I THINK THE LEAD TIME IS     
KIND OF INCONSEQUENTIAL.        
THERE IS A COST DIFFERENTIAL.   

00:32:06.915 --> 00:32:07.781
KIND OF INCONSEQUENTIAL.        
THERE IS A COST DIFFERENTIAL.   
I FORGET THE EXACT NUMBERS SO   

00:32:07.783 --> 00:32:10.683
THERE IS A COST DIFFERENTIAL.   
I FORGET THE EXACT NUMBERS SO   
DON&amp;apos;T QUOTE ME ON THIS BUT I    

00:32:10.685 --> 00:32:11.385
I FORGET THE EXACT NUMBERS SO   
DON&amp;apos;T QUOTE ME ON THIS BUT I    
THINK A GASOLINE POWERED        

00:32:11.387 --> 00:32:14.353
DON&amp;apos;T QUOTE ME ON THIS BUT I    
THINK A GASOLINE POWERED        
VEHICLE WOULD HAVE BEEN, YOU    

00:32:14.355 --> 00:32:15.355
THINK A GASOLINE POWERED        
VEHICLE WOULD HAVE BEEN, YOU    
KNOW, LIKE IN THE LOW HUNDREDS  

00:32:15.357 --> 00:32:18.758
VEHICLE WOULD HAVE BEEN, YOU    
KNOW, LIKE IN THE LOW HUNDREDS  
AND THIS WOULD BE MAYBE A       

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.361
KNOW, LIKE IN THE LOW HUNDREDS  
AND THIS WOULD BE MAYBE A       
LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSE TO DOUBLE 

00:32:21.363 --> 00:32:25.398
AND THIS WOULD BE MAYBE A       
LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSE TO DOUBLE 
THAT AND BUT MAYBE THE          

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.132
LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSE TO DOUBLE 
THAT AND BUT MAYBE THE          
PERFORMANCE IS LONGER AND MAYBE 

00:32:26.134 --> 00:32:29.769
THAT AND BUT MAYBE THE          
PERFORMANCE IS LONGER AND MAYBE 
WE SAVE MONEY ON GAS AND OTHER  

00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:30.369
PERFORMANCE IS LONGER AND MAYBE 
WE SAVE MONEY ON GAS AND OTHER  
THINGS SO MAYBE THERE IS A      

00:32:30.371 --> 00:32:32.705
WE SAVE MONEY ON GAS AND OTHER  
THINGS SO MAYBE THERE IS A      
RETURN ON INVESTMENT ON IT BUT  

00:32:32.707 --> 00:32:33.807
THINGS SO MAYBE THERE IS A      
RETURN ON INVESTMENT ON IT BUT  
IT ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE CITY&amp;apos;S  

00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:34.541
RETURN ON INVESTMENT ON IT BUT  
IT ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE CITY&amp;apos;S  
CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.        

00:32:34.543 --> 00:32:37.009
IT ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE CITY&amp;apos;S  
CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.        
SO SO I THINK PART OF IT IS     

00:32:37.011 --> 00:32:37.711
CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.        
SO SO I THINK PART OF IT IS     
ALSO JUST THE BUDGETING PIECE   

00:32:37.713 --> 00:32:40.113
SO SO I THINK PART OF IT IS     
ALSO JUST THE BUDGETING PIECE   
RIGHT?                          

00:32:40.115 --> 00:32:41.047
ALSO JUST THE BUDGETING PIECE   
RIGHT?                          
IT&amp;apos;S BOTH ORDERING IN THE LEAD  

00:32:41.049 --> 00:32:41.715
RIGHT?                          
IT&amp;apos;S BOTH ORDERING IN THE LEAD  
TIME AND THEN ALSO TRYING TO    

00:32:41.717 --> 00:32:44.517
IT&amp;apos;S BOTH ORDERING IN THE LEAD  
TIME AND THEN ALSO TRYING TO    
FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROCURE IT    

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:45.218
TIME AND THEN ALSO TRYING TO    
FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROCURE IT    
WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE   

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.720
FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROCURE IT    
WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE   
AND THEN AS MOLLY KIND

THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ANY TIME 
WE BUY ANYTHING AT THE CITY

THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ANY TIME 
WE BUY ANYTHING AT THE CITY     
IT&amp;apos;S KIND OF AMORTIZED OVER ITS

CLOSE TO THE CURB AND THAT WAS  
ULTIMATELY THE ONE THAT WE      

00:35:13.702 --> 00:35:17.170

PETE, I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF YOU WANT

SAW.                            
PETE, I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF YOU WANT  
TO TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THE    

00:35:25.513 --> 00:35:26.246
PETE, I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF YOU WANT  
TO TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THE    
WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE WHY WE&amp;apos;RE BRINGING   

00:35:26.248 --> 00:35:28.481
TO TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THE    
WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE WHY WE&amp;apos;RE BRINGING   
IT BACK, HOW WE WANT ADDRESS    

00:35:28.483 --> 00:35:28.748
WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE WHY WE&amp;apos;RE BRINGING   
IT BACK, HOW WE WANT ADDRESS    
IT.                             

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:29.315
IT BACK, HOW WE WANT ADDRESS    
IT.                             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.                         

00:35:29.317 --> 00:35:32.685
IT.                             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.                         
SO I HAVE TWO MAIN REASONS WHY  

00:35:32.687 --> 00:35:33.419
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.                         
SO I HAVE TWO MAIN REASONS WHY  
I WANTED TO BRING IT BACK.      

00:35:33.421 --> 00:35:36.022
SO I HAVE TWO MAIN REASONS WHY  
I WANTED TO BRING IT BACK.      
ONE IS THAT SINCE I&amp;apos;VE SPOKEN   

00:35:36.024 --> 00:35:39.959
I WANTED TO BRING IT BACK.      
ONE IS THAT SINCE I&amp;apos;VE SPOKEN   
TO SEVERAL NEIGHBORS WHO LIVE   

00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:44.230
ONE IS THAT SINCE I&amp;apos;VE SPOKEN   
TO SEVERAL NEIGHBORS WHO LIVE   
NEAR THIS AREA, SOME OF THEM    

00:35:44.232 --> 00:35:44.998
TO SEVERAL NEIGHBORS WHO LIVE   
NEAR THIS AREA, SOME OF THEM    
THOUGHT THAT REMOVING PARKING   

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.464
NEAR THIS AREA, SOME OF THEM    
THOUGHT THAT REMOVING PARKING   
WAS A GOOD IDEA.                

00:35:45.466 --> 00:35:48.234
THOUGHT THAT REMOVING PARKING   
WAS A GOOD IDEA.                
SOME THOUGHT WASN&amp;apos;T A GOOD IDEA 

00:35:48.236 --> 00:35:48.935
WAS A GOOD IDEA.                
SOME THOUGHT WASN&amp;apos;T A GOOD IDEA 
BUT EVERYBODY SEEMED TO AGREE   

00:35:48.937 --> 00:35:51.471
SOME THOUGHT WASN&amp;apos;T A GOOD IDEA 
BUT EVERYBODY SEEMED TO AGREE   
THE PROBLEM IS THAT TRAFFIC IS  

00:35:51.473 --> 00:35:54.707
BUT EVERYBODY SEEMED TO AGREE   
THE PROBLEM IS THAT TRAFFIC IS  
TOO FAST ON SEVEN AND IS        

00:35:54.709 --> 00:35:55.108
THE PROBLEM IS THAT TRAFFIC IS  
TOO FAST ON SEVEN AND IS        
DANGEROUS.                      

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.309
TOO FAST ON SEVEN AND IS        
DANGEROUS.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE NEED TO GET IT TO SLOW    

00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:58.811
DANGEROUS.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE NEED TO GET IT TO SLOW    
DOWN.                           

00:35:58.813 --> 00:35:59.979
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE NEED TO GET IT TO SLOW    
DOWN.                           
SO WHAT WE APPROVED IN OUR LAST 

00:35:59.981 --> 00:36:03.383
DOWN.                           
SO WHAT WE APPROVED IN OUR LAST 
MEETING MAY HAVE BEEN THE BEST  

00:36:03.385 --> 00:36:05.885
SO WHAT WE APPROVED IN OUR LAST 
MEETING MAY HAVE BEEN THE BEST  
ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS PRESENTED  

00:36:05.887 --> 00:36:06.219
MEETING MAY HAVE BEEN THE BEST  
ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS PRESENTED  
.                               

00:36:06.221 --> 00:36:10.190
ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS PRESENTED  
.                               
IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE  

00:36:10.192 --> 00:36:11.057
.                               
IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE  
THE BEST POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE,  

00:36:11.059 --> 00:36:13.726
IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE  
THE BEST POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE,  
ESPECIALLY NOT THE BEST THING   

00:36:13.728 --> 00:36:14.560
THE BEST POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE,  
ESPECIALLY NOT THE BEST THING   
FOR SLOWING INCOMING TRAFFIC ON 

00:36:14.562 --> 00:36:20.232
ESPECIALLY NOT THE BEST THING   
FOR SLOWING INCOMING TRAFFIC ON 
THE STRETCH SEVEN.              

00:36:20.234 --> 00:36:26.973
FOR SLOWING INCOMING TRAFFIC ON 
THE STRETCH SEVEN.              
I ALSO GATHER THAT              

00:36:41.222 --> 00:36:43.790
                   THAT TRAFFIC 
CALMING IS NOT THE TYPICAL PART 
OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND I    

00:36:43.792 --> 00:36:44.724
CALMING IS NOT THE TYPICAL PART 
OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND I    
THINK IN THIS CASE IT SHOULD BE 

00:36:44.726 --> 00:36:45.324
OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND I    
THINK IN THIS CASE IT SHOULD BE 
THE OTHER REASON THAT I&amp;apos;M       

00:36:45.326 --> 00:36:46.058
THINK IN THIS CASE IT SHOULD BE 
THE OTHER REASON THAT I&amp;apos;M       
BRINGING IT BACK IS THAT ON     

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:46.726
THE OTHER REASON THAT I&amp;apos;M       
BRINGING IT BACK IS THAT ON     
TONIGHT&amp;apos;S AGENDA OBVIOUSLY WE   

00:36:46.728 --> 00:36:47.526
BRINGING IT BACK IS THAT ON     
TONIGHT&amp;apos;S AGENDA OBVIOUSLY WE   
JUST APPROVED A MOTION ASKING   

00:36:47.528 --> 00:36:48.394
TONIGHT&amp;apos;S AGENDA OBVIOUSLY WE   
JUST APPROVED A MOTION ASKING   
FOR ACTION SMALLER PLOW         

00:36:48.396 --> 00:36:49.295
JUST APPROVED A MOTION ASKING   
FOR ACTION SMALLER PLOW         
EQUIPMENT THAT CAN MANAGE       

00:36:49.297 --> 00:36:49.796
FOR ACTION SMALLER PLOW         
EQUIPMENT THAT CAN MANAGE       
NARROWER BIKE LANES.            

00:36:49.798 --> 00:36:51.263
EQUIPMENT THAT CAN MANAGE       
NARROWER BIKE LANES.            
WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD  

00:36:51.265 --> 00:36:51.998
NARROWER BIKE LANES.            
WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD  
ENABLE DIFFERENT DESIGNS THAN   

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.333
WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD  
ENABLE DIFFERENT DESIGNS THAN   
THE ONES THAT WERE PROPOSED TO  

00:36:54.335 --> 00:36:55.235
ENABLE DIFFERENT DESIGNS THAN   
THE ONES THAT WERE PROPOSED TO  
US IN THE LAST MEETING WOULD    

00:36:55.237 --> 00:36:58.571
THE ONES THAT WERE PROPOSED TO  
US IN THE LAST MEETING WOULD    
ENABLE A PROTECTED BIKE, NOT A  

00:36:58.573 --> 00:37:02.308
US IN THE LAST MEETING WOULD    
ENABLE A PROTECTED BIKE, NOT A  
SINGLE WICK AND THAT INCLUDES   

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.945
ENABLE A PROTECTED BIKE, NOT A  
SINGLE WICK AND THAT INCLUDES   
VERTICAL DELINEATOR FOR         

00:37:05.947 --> 00:37:06.212
SINGLE WICK AND THAT INCLUDES   
VERTICAL DELINEATOR FOR         
EXAMPLE.                        

00:37:06.214 --> 00:37:07.213
VERTICAL DELINEATOR FOR         
EXAMPLE.                        
THAT&amp;apos;S ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT   

00:37:07.215 --> 00:37:07.614
EXAMPLE.                        
THAT&amp;apos;S ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT   
WOULD MEAN.                     

00:37:07.616 --> 00:37:09.882
THAT&amp;apos;S ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT   
WOULD MEAN.                     
SO THAT OPTION IS NOT POSSIBLE  

00:37:09.884 --> 00:37:10.483
WOULD MEAN.                     
SO THAT OPTION IS NOT POSSIBLE  
TODAY UNTIL WE GET THAT         

00:37:10.485 --> 00:37:10.950
SO THAT OPTION IS NOT POSSIBLE  
TODAY UNTIL WE GET THAT         
EQUIPMENT.                      

00:37:10.952 --> 00:37:14.020
TODAY UNTIL WE GET THAT         
EQUIPMENT.                      
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE     

00:37:14.022 --> 00:37:17.156
EQUIPMENT.                      
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE     
SOME PROGRESS ON THAT THEN I    

00:37:17.158 --> 00:37:21.127
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE     
SOME PROGRESS ON THAT THEN I    
THINK WE NEED TO LET STAFF COME 

00:37:21.129 --> 00:37:22.027
SOME PROGRESS ON THAT THEN I    
THINK WE NEED TO LET STAFF COME 
UP WITH IDEAS OR PROPOSALS THAT 

00:37:22.029 --> 00:37:24.164
THINK WE NEED TO LET STAFF COME 
UP WITH IDEAS OR PROPOSALS THAT 
COULD USE IT.                   

00:37:24.166 --> 00:37:25.364
UP WITH IDEAS OR PROPOSALS THAT 
COULD USE IT.                   
LAST THING THAT I WANT TO ADD   

00:37:25.366 --> 00:37:28.401
COULD USE IT.                   
LAST THING THAT I WANT TO ADD   
ABOUT THIS STREET SO TAKE       

00:37:28.403 --> 00:37:32.271
LAST THING THAT I WANT TO ADD   
ABOUT THIS STREET SO TAKE       
ANOTHER LOOK AT IT IS THAT THE  

00:37:32.273 --> 00:37:33.139
ABOUT THIS STREET SO TAKE       
ANOTHER LOOK AT IT IS THAT THE  
THE SPEED ON THIS ROAD IS       

00:37:33.141 --> 00:37:35.942
ANOTHER LOOK AT IT IS THAT THE  
THE SPEED ON THIS ROAD IS       
BROUGHT ON BY AN ENGINEERING    

00:37:35.944 --> 00:37:36.876
THE SPEED ON THIS ROAD IS       
BROUGHT ON BY AN ENGINEERING    
PROBLEM, NAMELY THAT THE STREET 

00:37:36.878 --> 00:37:37.811
BROUGHT ON BY AN ENGINEERING    
PROBLEM, NAMELY THAT THE STREET 
IS TOO WIDE FOR HOW IT&amp;apos;S USED   

00:37:37.813 --> 00:37:40.012
PROBLEM, NAMELY THAT THE STREET 
IS TOO WIDE FOR HOW IT&amp;apos;S USED   
TODAY AND THAT PROBLEM NEEDS TO 

00:37:40.014 --> 00:37:44.117
IS TOO WIDE FOR HOW IT&amp;apos;S USED   
TODAY AND THAT PROBLEM NEEDS TO 
BE FIXED BY ENGINEERING.        

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:45.185
TODAY AND THAT PROBLEM NEEDS TO 
BE FIXED BY ENGINEERING.        
THERE ARE TWO SPEED LIMIT SIGNS 

00:37:45.187 --> 00:37:47.653
BE FIXED BY ENGINEERING.        
THERE ARE TWO SPEED LIMIT SIGNS 
ON SEVEN APPROACHING SIWA       

00:37:47.655 --> 00:37:51.457
THERE ARE TWO SPEED LIMIT SIGNS 
ON SEVEN APPROACHING SIWA       
CHURCH FROM THE NORTH BUT THERE

REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS PORTION 
OF 7TH STREET IS THAT WE DO     

00:40:12.967 --> 00:40:16.301
REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS PORTION 
OF 7TH STREET IS THAT WE DO     
HAVE A MUCH WIDER STREET HERE.  

00:40:16.303 --> 00:40:17.036
OF 7TH STREET IS THAT WE DO     
HAVE A MUCH WIDER STREET HERE.  
IT&amp;apos;S SUPPOSED TO BE WE&amp;apos;RE       

00:40:17.038 --> 00:40:17.903
HAVE A MUCH WIDER STREET HERE.  
IT&amp;apos;S SUPPOSED TO BE WE&amp;apos;RE       
SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERING INTO A  

00:40:17.905 --> 00:40:19.305
IT&amp;apos;S SUPPOSED TO BE WE&amp;apos;RE       
SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERING INTO A  
NEIGHBORHOOD WE SHOULD BE       

00:40:19.307 --> 00:40:19.839
SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERING INTO A  
NEIGHBORHOOD WE SHOULD BE       
THINKING ABOUT.                 

00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:20.706
NEIGHBORHOOD WE SHOULD BE       
THINKING ABOUT.                 
THIS IS KIND OF A SLOWER        

00:40:20.708 --> 00:40:27.179
THINKING ABOUT.                 
THIS IS KIND OF A SLOWER        
STREETS OPPORTUNITY OVER        

00:40:27.181 --> 00:40:27.880
THIS IS KIND OF A SLOWER        
STREETS OPPORTUNITY OVER        
GREENWAY BIKE BOULEVARD SORT    

00:40:27.882 --> 00:40:28.481
STREETS OPPORTUNITY OVER        
GREENWAY BIKE BOULEVARD SORT    
OF OPPORTUNITY BUT BECAUSE      

00:40:28.483 --> 00:40:30.950
GREENWAY BIKE BOULEVARD SORT    
OF OPPORTUNITY BUT BECAUSE      
OF THE WIDTH OF THE STREET, I   

00:40:30.952 --> 00:40:31.818
OF OPPORTUNITY BUT BECAUSE      
OF THE WIDTH OF THE STREET, I   
THINK SOME OF THE WE APPROACHED 

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.387
OF THE WIDTH OF THE STREET, I   
THINK SOME OF THE WE APPROACHED 
HIM A LITTLE MORE LIKE WE HOW   

00:40:34.389 --> 00:40:35.287
THINK SOME OF THE WE APPROACHED 
HIM A LITTLE MORE LIKE WE HOW   
WE MADE OUR ARTERIAL AND I      

00:40:35.289 --> 00:40:38.590
HIM A LITTLE MORE LIKE WE HOW   
WE MADE OUR ARTERIAL AND I      
THINK IT FELT A LITTLE CLUNKY   

00:40:38.592 --> 00:40:39.258
WE MADE OUR ARTERIAL AND I      
THINK IT FELT A LITTLE CLUNKY   
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED BECAUSE  

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.227
THINK IT FELT A LITTLE CLUNKY   
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED BECAUSE  
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT REALLY HOW THIS      

00:40:42.229 --> 00:40:43.029
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED BECAUSE  
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT REALLY HOW THIS      
STREET IS SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION. 

00:40:43.031 --> 00:40:43.762
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT REALLY HOW THIS      
STREET IS SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION. 
AND SO I THINK THE DESIGN       

00:40:43.764 --> 00:40:46.099
STREET IS SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION. 
AND SO I THINK THE DESIGN       
OF THIS IN SOME WAYS IS         

00:40:46.101 --> 00:40:46.832
AND SO I THINK THE DESIGN       
OF THIS IN SOME WAYS IS         
ENCOURAGING BEHAVIOR IN THE     

00:40:46.834 --> 00:40:50.269
OF THIS IN SOME WAYS IS         
ENCOURAGING BEHAVIOR IN THE     
FUTURE ISN&amp;apos;T REALLY CONSISTENT  

00:40:50.271 --> 00:40:53.906
ENCOURAGING BEHAVIOR IN THE     
FUTURE ISN&amp;apos;T REALLY CONSISTENT  
WITH HOW WE WANT TO SEE THE     

00:40:53.908 --> 00:40:54.407
FUTURE ISN&amp;apos;T REALLY CONSISTENT  
WITH HOW WE WANT TO SEE THE     
STREET BEING USED.              

00:40:54.409 --> 00:40:57.009
WITH HOW WE WANT TO SEE THE     
STREET BEING USED.              
SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE&amp;apos;VE 

00:40:57.011 --> 00:40:58.044
STREET BEING USED.              
SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE&amp;apos;VE 
THAT COUNCIL MEMBER AND I HAVE  

00:40:58.046 --> 00:41:01.146
SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE&amp;apos;VE 
THAT COUNCIL MEMBER AND I HAVE  
RECEIVED THROUGH OUR            

00:41:01.148 --> 00:41:04.716
THAT COUNCIL MEMBER AND I HAVE  
RECEIVED THROUGH OUR            
DISCUSSIONS IS THAT THE TRAFFIC 

00:41:04.718 --> 00:41:05.551
RECEIVED THROUGH OUR            
DISCUSSIONS IS THAT THE TRAFFIC 
THAT SPEED MANAGEMENT WASN&amp;apos;T    

00:41:05.553 --> 00:41:09.322
DISCUSSIONS IS THAT THE TRAFFIC 
THAT SPEED MANAGEMENT WASN&amp;apos;T    
REALLY INTEGRATED WITH THE ALL  

00:41:09.324 --> 00:41:12.758
THAT SPEED MANAGEMENT WASN&amp;apos;T    
REALLY INTEGRATED WITH THE ALL  
AGES AND ABILITY BIKE ROUTE     

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.492
REALLY INTEGRATED WITH THE ALL  
AGES AND ABILITY BIKE ROUTE     
DESIGNED BECAUSE TRAFFIC COMING 

00:41:13.494 --> 00:41:16.762
AGES AND ABILITY BIKE ROUTE     
DESIGNED BECAUSE TRAFFIC COMING 
IS VIEWED AS A SEPARATE PROCESS 

00:41:16.764 --> 00:41:20.232
DESIGNED BECAUSE TRAFFIC COMING 
IS VIEWED AS A SEPARATE PROCESS 
FROM SORT OF THE BIKE DESIGN    

00:41:20.234 --> 00:41:20.533
IS VIEWED AS A SEPARATE PROCESS 
FROM SORT OF THE BIKE DESIGN    
ELEMENT.                        

00:41:20.535 --> 00:41:21.401
FROM SORT OF THE BIKE DESIGN    
ELEMENT.                        
AND SO I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE GOT A      

00:41:21.403 --> 00:41:25.104
ELEMENT.                        
AND SO I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE GOT A      
LITTLE BIT OF CHALLENGES HERE   

00:41:25.106 --> 00:41:25.705
AND SO I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE GOT A      
LITTLE BIT OF CHALLENGES HERE   
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY       

00:41:25.707 --> 00:41:26.505
LITTLE BIT OF CHALLENGES HERE   
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY       
AGREES THAT SPEED IS REALLY THE 

00:41:26.507 --> 00:41:29.609
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY       
AGREES THAT SPEED IS REALLY THE 
PRIMARY OR AT LEAST ONE OF THE  

00:41:29.611 --> 00:41:31.877
AGREES THAT SPEED IS REALLY THE 
PRIMARY OR AT LEAST ONE OF THE  
PRIMARY ISSUES IN THIS IN THIS  

00:41:31.879 --> 00:41:32.745
PRIMARY OR AT LEAST ONE OF THE  
PRIMARY ISSUES IN THIS IN THIS  
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT NEEDS TO BE   

00:41:32.747 --> 00:41:33.412
PRIMARY ISSUES IN THIS IN THIS  
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT NEEDS TO BE   
ADDRESSED AND THAT&amp;apos;S NOT        

00:41:33.414 --> 00:41:36.415
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT NEEDS TO BE   
ADDRESSED AND THAT&amp;apos;S NOT        
NECESSARILY THE GUIDING FOCUS   

00:41:36.417 --> 00:41:37.116
ADDRESSED AND THAT&amp;apos;S NOT        
NECESSARILY THE GUIDING FOCUS   
AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS.        

00:41:37.118 --> 00:41:40.753
NECESSARILY THE GUIDING FOCUS   
AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS.        
SO WE HAVE THE SUBCOMMITTEE     

00:41:40.755 --> 00:41:43.889
AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS.        
SO WE HAVE THE SUBCOMMITTEE     
THAT&amp;apos;S GETTING SET UP THAT      

00:41:43.891 --> 00:41:44.790
SO WE HAVE THE SUBCOMMITTEE     
THAT&amp;apos;S GETTING SET UP THAT      
HASN&amp;apos;T STARTED TO MEET YET      

00:41:44.792 --> 00:41:45.357

00:41:48.195 --> 00:41:49.362
AROUND RECONSIDERING OUR        
TRAFFIC COMING PROCESS AND      
THINKING THAT AND SO WE&amp;apos;RE IN A 

00:41:49.364 --> 00:41:52.765
TRAFFIC COMING PROCESS AND      
THINKING THAT AND SO WE&amp;apos;RE IN A 
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFICULT TIME  

00:41:52.767 --> 00:41:53.232
THINKING THAT AND SO WE&amp;apos;RE IN A 
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFICULT TIME  
PERIOD RIGHT NOW.               

00:41:53.234 --> 00:41:55.934
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFICULT TIME

BUT ONCE UPON A TIME IT WAS NOT 
ENVISIONED TO BE SUCH RIGHT.    

00:44:02.564 --> 00:44:03.429
BUT ONCE UPON A TIME IT WAS NOT 
ENVISIONED TO BE SUCH RIGHT.    
IT WAS ACTUALLY ENVISIONED 7TH

SOUTH AND CONNECTING AND        
OBVIOUSLY AS I UNDERSTAND AND   
THAT DIDN&amp;apos;T HAPPEN AND THAT&amp;apos;S

OBVIOUSLY AS I UNDERSTAND AND   
THAT DIDN&amp;apos;T HAPPEN AND THAT&amp;apos;S   
FINE.

THAT DIDN&amp;apos;T HAPPEN AND THAT&amp;apos;S

00:44:13.774 --> 00:44:14.473
FINE.                           
BUT THAT&amp;apos;S WHY THIS SECTION     
OF A NEIGHBORHOOD LOCAL STREET  

00:44:14.475 --> 00:44:15.141
BUT THAT&amp;apos;S WHY THIS SECTION     
OF A NEIGHBORHOOD LOCAL STREET  
IS MUCH WIDER THAN WHAT YOU     

00:44:15.143 --> 00:44:17.910
OF A NEIGHBORHOOD LOCAL STREET  
IS MUCH WIDER THAN WHAT YOU     
WOULD TYPICALLY FIND IN MOST    

00:44:17.912 --> 00:44:18.611
IS MUCH WIDER THAN WHAT YOU     
WOULD TYPICALLY FIND IN MOST    
OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS ARE 

00:44:18.613 --> 00:44:19.145
WOULD TYPICALLY FIND IN MOST

THIRTY FEET ACROSS.             

00:44:19.147 --> 00:44:22.214
OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS ARE 
THIRTY FEET ACROSS.             
I THINK THIS ONE IS CLOSE TO 50 

00:44:22.216 --> 00:44:22.915
THIRTY FEET ACROSS.             
I THINK THIS ONE IS CLOSE TO 50 
OR 60 FEET ACROSS BECAUSE IT    

00:44:22.917 --> 00:44:25.184
I THINK THIS ONE IS CLOSE TO 50 
OR 60 FEET ACROSS BECAUSE IT    
WAS PLANNED TO AN ARTERIAL OR   

00:44:25.186 --> 00:44:25.718

00:45:44.466 --> 00:45:47.499
WHICH I UNDERSTAND WHY IT       
WASN&amp;apos;T SUPPORTED BUT BASED ON   
THE FEEDBACK WE WERE GETTING    

00:45:47.501 --> 00:45:48.133
WASN&amp;apos;T SUPPORTED BUT BASED ON   
THE FEEDBACK WE WERE GETTING    
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE    

00:45:48.135 --> 00:45:48.801
THE FEEDBACK WE WERE GETTING    
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE    
WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT          

00:45:48.803 --> 00:45:51.103
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE    
WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT          
ELIMINATION OF THE PARKING AND  

00:45:51.105 --> 00:45:55.508
WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT          
ELIMINATION OF THE PARKING AND  
SO PARKING DOES HAVE A SORT     

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.175
ELIMINATION OF THE PARKING AND  
SO PARKING DOES HAVE A SORT     
OF TRAFFIC CALMING ELEMENT.     

00:45:56.177 --> 00:45:59.344
SO PARKING DOES HAVE A SORT     
OF TRAFFIC CALMING ELEMENT.     
BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT           

00:45:59.346 --> 00:46:00.045

THAT&amp;apos;S NOT THE WAY TO GO.       
THAT&amp;apos;S FINE.                    

00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:07.880
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT THE WAY TO GO.       
THAT&amp;apos;S FINE.                    
WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER

THAT&amp;apos;S FINE.                    
WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER

00:47:08.483 --> 00:47:09.215
WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER            
ALTERNATIVES AND SO WHEN THE

TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION       
DISCUSSED THIS LAST MONTH,      

00:47:09.817 --> 00:47:10.549
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION       
DISCUSSED THIS LAST MONTH,      
THERE WAS THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT   

00:47:10.551 --> 00:47:11.283
DISCUSSED THIS LAST MONTH,      
THERE WAS THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT   
THAT A HIGHER ORDER BIKE        

00:47:11.285 --> 00:47:11.884
THERE WAS THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT   
THAT A HIGHER ORDER BIKE        
FACILITY WOULD BE PREFERABLE    

00:47:11.886 --> 00:47:12.551
THAT A HIGHER ORDER BIKE        
FACILITY WOULD BE PREFERABLE    
WHICH CAN BE ACCOMMODATED.      

00:47:12.553 --> 00:47:13.185
FACILITY WOULD BE PREFERABLE    
WHICH CAN BE ACCOMMODATED.      
WE CAN PUT IN A PROTECTED       

00:47:13.187 --> 00:47:13.986
WHICH CAN BE ACCOMMODATED.      
WE CAN PUT IN A PROTECTED       
WHETHER IT BE BUFFERED WITH NO  

00:47:13.988 --> 00:47:14.786
WE CAN PUT IN A PROTECTED       
WHETHER IT BE BUFFERED WITH NO  
VERTICAL DONATORS OR PROTECTED  

00:47:14.788 --> 00:47:15.521
WHETHER IT BE BUFFERED WITH NO  
VERTICAL DONATORS OR PROTECTED  
WITH VERTICAL DELINEATOR IN THE 

00:47:15.523 --> 00:47:16.121
VERTICAL DONATORS OR PROTECTED  
WITH VERTICAL DELINEATOR IN THE 
SAME SPACE BUT IN TO            

00:47:16.123 --> 00:47:16.855
WITH VERTICAL DELINEATOR IN THE 
SAME SPACE BUT IN TO            
ACCOMMODATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE  

00:47:16.857 --> 00:47:17.656
SAME SPACE BUT IN TO            
ACCOMMODATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE  
HAD TO REMOVE PARKING ON ONE    

00:47:17.658 --> 00:47:18.390
ACCOMMODATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE  
HAD TO REMOVE PARKING ON ONE    
SIDE OF THE ROOF WHICH AGAIN IT 

00:47:18.392 --> 00:47:19.191
HAD TO REMOVE PARKING ON ONE    
SIDE OF THE ROOF WHICH AGAIN IT 
CAN BE ACCOMMODATED THAT THAT&amp;apos;S 

00:47:19.193 --> 00:47:21.426
SIDE OF THE ROOF WHICH AGAIN IT 
CAN BE ACCOMMODATED THAT THAT&amp;apos;S 
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE APPROACH.  

00:47:21.428 --> 00:47:22.428
CAN BE ACCOMMODATED THAT THAT&amp;apos;S 
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE APPROACH.  
SO YEAH, I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE   

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.630
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE APPROACH.  
SO YEAH, I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE   
WE LANDED WHERE WE LANDED.      

00:47:24.632 --> 00:47:25.864
SO YEAH, I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE   
WE LANDED WHERE WE LANDED.      
I APPRECIATE IF THERE ARE SOME  

00:47:25.866 --> 00:47:30.069
WE LANDED WHERE WE LANDED.      
I APPRECIATE IF THERE ARE SOME  
FOLLEY IN THAT APPROACH AND HOW 

00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:31.137
I APPRECIATE IF THERE ARE SOME  
FOLLEY IN THAT APPROACH AND HOW 
WE GOT TO WHERE WE WERE BUT IT  

00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:32.738
FOLLEY IN THAT APPROACH AND HOW 
WE GOT TO WHERE WE WERE BUT IT  
WASN&amp;apos;T ARBITRARY.               

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.806
WE GOT TO WHERE WE WERE BUT IT  
WASN&amp;apos;T ARBITRARY.               
WE KIND OF TRIED TO FOLLOW THE  

00:47:33.808 --> 00:47:34.673
WASN&amp;apos;T ARBITRARY.               
WE KIND OF TRIED TO FOLLOW THE  
CUES THAT WE WERE GETTING FROM  

00:47:34.675 --> 00:47:37.009
WE KIND OF TRIED TO FOLLOW THE  
CUES THAT WE WERE GETTING FROM  
THE COMMUNITY AND OTHERS AND    

00:47:37.011 --> 00:47:37.809
CUES THAT WE WERE GETTING FROM  
THE COMMUNITY AND OTHERS AND    
SOMETIMES WE TRY TO MAKE        

00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:41.180
THE COMMUNITY AND OTHERS AND    
SOMETIMES WE TRY TO MAKE        
EVERYBODY HAPPY AND MAKE NO ONE 

00:47:41.182 --> 00:47:41.847
SOMETIMES WE TRY TO MAKE        
EVERYBODY HAPPY AND MAKE NO ONE 
HAPPY IN THE PROCESS.           

00:47:41.849 --> 00:47:44.516
EVERYBODY HAPPY AND MAKE NO ONE 
HAPPY IN THE PROCESS.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE WE   

00:47:44.518 --> 00:47:44.917
HAPPY IN THE PROCESS.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE WE   
LANDED.                         

00:47:44.919 --> 00:47:45.918
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE WE   
LANDED.                         
I THINK IN TERMS OF YOUR

I HAVE AN IMMEDIATE THOUGHT     

00:47:54.095 --> 00:47:57.096
VOTE I I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF NICK OR  
I HAVE AN IMMEDIATE THOUGHT     
ABOUT HOW THAT PLAYS OUT        

00:47:57.098 --> 00:47:57.897
I HAVE AN IMMEDIATE THOUGHT     
ABOUT HOW THAT PLAYS OUT        
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY TEED    

00:47:57.899 --> 00:47:59.598
ABOUT HOW THAT PLAYS OUT        
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY TEED    
THIS UP FOR COUNCIL&amp;apos;S           

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.232
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY TEED    
THIS UP FOR COUNCIL&amp;apos;S           
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE REMOVAL   

00:48:00.234 --> 00:48:00.899
THIS UP FOR COUNCIL&amp;apos;S           
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE REMOVAL   
OF PARKING IS A COUNCIL         

00:48:00.901 --> 00:48:03.602
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE REMOVAL   
OF PARKING IS A COUNCIL         
APPROVED ACTION.                

00:48:03.604 --> 00:48:04.670
OF PARKING IS A COUNCIL         
APPROVED ACTION.                
SO I SUSPECT THAT THAT WOULD    

00:48:04.672 --> 00:48:07.740
APPROVED ACTION.                
SO I SUSPECT THAT THAT WOULD    
BECOME NULL AND VOID.           

00:48:07.742 --> 00:48:11.410
SO I SUSPECT THAT THAT WOULD    
BECOME NULL AND VOID.           
BUT THEN WE MIGHT ALSO NEED     

00:48:11.412 --> 00:48:12.078
BECOME NULL AND VOID.           
BUT THEN WE MIGHT ALSO NEED     
SOME FURTHER DIRECTION ABOUT    

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.581
BUT THEN WE MIGHT ALSO NEED     
SOME FURTHER DIRECTION ABOUT    
WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE.        

00:48:15.583 --> 00:48:16.782
SOME FURTHER DIRECTION ABOUT    
WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE.

MONEY IN THE WATER FUND THE     
STORMWATER THE STREET FUND.     

00:56:43.056 --> 00:56:44.289
MONEY IN THE WATER FUND THE     
STORMWATER THE STREET FUND.     
I&amp;apos;VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL  

00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:46.324
STORMWATER THE STREET FUND.     
I&amp;apos;VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL  
OF THAT STOCK THAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO   

00:56:46.326 --> 00:56:46.691
I&amp;apos;VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL  
OF THAT STOCK THAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO   
BE DOABLE.                      

00:56:46.693 --> 00:56:50.028
OF THAT STOCK THAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO   
BE DOABLE.                      
I THINK IT WILL BE.             

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:51.096
BE DOABLE.                      
I THINK IT WILL BE.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S THERE&amp;apos;S A 

00:56:51.098 --> 00:56:53.831
I THINK IT WILL BE.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S THERE&amp;apos;S A 
LOT OF MOVING PARTS THERE.      

00:56:53.833 --> 00:56:54.866
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S THERE&amp;apos;S A 
LOT OF MOVING PARTS THERE.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.  

00:56:54.868 --> 00:56:58.469
LOT OF MOVING PARTS THERE.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.  
DO YOU EVER DO A BIG ROAD       

00:56:58.471 --> 00:56:59.137
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.  
DO YOU EVER DO A BIG ROAD       
RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT A        

00:56:59.139 --> 00:57:01.839
DO YOU EVER DO A BIG ROAD       
RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT A        
UTILITY PROJECT UNDERNEATH?     

00:57:01.841 --> 00:57:04.676
RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT A        
UTILITY PROJECT UNDERNEATH?     
WELL, THIS IS NOT A THIS IS NOT 

00:57:04.678 --> 00:57:05.444
UTILITY PROJECT UNDERNEATH?     
WELL, THIS IS NOT A THIS IS NOT 
A RECONSTRUCTION BUT FIRST      

00:57:05.446 --> 00:57:06.244
WELL, THIS IS NOT A THIS IS NOT 
A RECONSTRUCTION BUT FIRST      
OF ALL IS THE FIRST THING THAT  

00:57:06.246 --> 00:57:12.484
A RECONSTRUCTION BUT FIRST      
OF ALL IS THE FIRST THING THAT  
I WOULD SAY                     

00:57:25.998 --> 00:57:28.300
            IF WE&amp;apos;RE            
RECONSTRUCTING A ROAD THEN WE   
THEN YEAH, WE LINE UP THE       

00:57:28.302 --> 00:57:28.900
RECONSTRUCTING A ROAD THEN WE   
THEN YEAH, WE LINE UP THE       
UTILITIES WITH IT.              

00:57:28.902 --> 00:57:29.701
THEN YEAH, WE LINE UP THE       
UTILITIES WITH IT.              
NOW IF THERE&amp;apos;S NO UTILITY NEEDS 

00:57:29.703 --> 00:57:30.368
UTILITIES WITH IT.              
NOW IF THERE&amp;apos;S NO UTILITY NEEDS 
OUT THERE THEN THAT&amp;apos;S GREAT.    

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.102
NOW IF THERE&amp;apos;S NO UTILITY NEEDS 
OUT THERE THEN THAT&amp;apos;S GREAT.    
BUT USUALLY THERE&amp;apos;S SOMETHING   

00:57:31.104 --> 00:57:31.836
OUT THERE THEN THAT&amp;apos;S GREAT.    
BUT USUALLY THERE&amp;apos;S SOMETHING   
SO IF WE&amp;apos;RE DOING A MAJOR       

00:57:31.838 --> 00:57:32.437
BUT USUALLY THERE&amp;apos;S SOMETHING   
SO IF WE&amp;apos;RE DOING A MAJOR       
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT THEN     

00:57:32.439 --> 00:57:33.038
SO IF WE&amp;apos;RE DOING A MAJOR       
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT THEN     
YEAH, THAT USUALLY INCLUDES     

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:33.838
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT THEN     
YEAH, THAT USUALLY INCLUDES     
SOME UTILITY WORK IF THERE&amp;apos;S A  

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.238
YEAH, THAT USUALLY INCLUDES     
SOME UTILITY WORK IF THERE&amp;apos;S A  
NEED FOR IT.                    

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:34.973
SOME UTILITY WORK IF THERE&amp;apos;S A  
NEED FOR IT.                    
BUT THIS WAS ALWAYS ENVISIONED  

00:57:34.975 --> 00:57:35.774
NEED FOR IT.                    
BUT THIS WAS ALWAYS ENVISIONED  
AS A RESURFACING PROJECT NOT AS 

00:57:35.776 --> 00:57:36.441
BUT THIS WAS ALWAYS ENVISIONED  
AS A RESURFACING PROJECT NOT AS 
A COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION.      

00:57:36.443 --> 00:57:37.175
AS A RESURFACING PROJECT NOT AS 
A COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, SO I SEE BRET AND THEN   

00:57:37.177 --> 00:57:37.909
A COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, SO I SEE BRET AND THEN   
ERICA BUT I MIGHT BE COMING IN  

00:57:37.911 --> 00:57:39.644
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, SO I SEE BRET AND THEN   
ERICA BUT I MIGHT BE COMING IN  
WITH SOMETHING BETWEEN THE TWO  

00:57:39.646 --> 00:57:43.614
ERICA BUT I MIGHT BE COMING IN  
WITH SOMETHING BETWEEN THE TWO  
OF YOU SO GO ARE THERE MY OLDER 

00:57:43.616 --> 00:57:47.485
WITH SOMETHING BETWEEN THE TWO  
OF YOU SO GO ARE THERE MY OLDER 
OPTIONS IN TRAFFIC CALMING TOOL 

00:57:47.487 --> 00:57:48.252
OF YOU SO GO ARE THERE MY OLDER 
OPTIONS IN TRAFFIC CALMING TOOL 
BOX THAT WOULDN&amp;apos;T REQUIRE SUCH  

00:57:48.254 --> 00:57:51.122
OPTIONS IN TRAFFIC CALMING TOOL 
BOX THAT WOULDN&amp;apos;T REQUIRE SUCH  
A DRASTIC REDESIGN AND          

00:57:51.124 --> 00:57:54.826
BOX THAT WOULDN&amp;apos;T REQUIRE SUCH  
A DRASTIC REDESIGN AND          
ENGAGEMENT THINGS JUST LIKE     

00:57:54.828 --> 00:57:55.626
A DRASTIC REDESIGN AND          
ENGAGEMENT THINGS JUST LIKE     
RAISED CROSSWALKS, YOU KNOW,    

00:57:55.628 --> 00:57:58.397
ENGAGEMENT THINGS JUST LIKE     
RAISED CROSSWALKS, YOU KNOW,    
THINGS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN      

00:57:58.399 --> 00:57:59.064
RAISED CROSSWALKS, YOU KNOW,    
THINGS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN      
SCOPE THAT COULD HAVE A         

00:57:59.066 --> 00:58:02.366
THINGS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN      
SCOPE THAT COULD HAVE A         
POSITIVE EFFECT ON SPEEDS BUT   

00:58:02.368 --> 00:58:06.171
SCOPE THAT COULD HAVE A         
POSITIVE EFFECT ON SPEEDS BUT   
MAYBE WOULDN&amp;apos;T TRIGGER A YEAR   

00:58:06.173 --> 00:58:09.841
POSITIVE EFFECT ON SPEEDS BUT   
MAYBE WOULDN&amp;apos;T TRIGGER A YEAR   
DELAY AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER    

00:58:09.843 --> 00:58:11.008
MAYBE WOULDN&amp;apos;T TRIGGER A YEAR   
DELAY AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER    
THINGS THAT COME FROM A FULL    

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:13.244
DELAY AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER    
THINGS THAT COME FROM A FULL    
REDESIGN?                       

00:58:13.246 --> 00:58:17.282
THINGS THAT COME FROM A FULL    
REDESIGN?                       
WELL, I THINK SOME OF THOSE     

00:58:17.284 --> 00:58:21.486
REDESIGN?                       
WELL, I THINK SOME OF THOSE     
ELEMENTS ARE ENVISIONED TO BE   

00:58:21.488 --> 00:58:22.286
WELL, I THINK SOME OF THOSE     
ELEMENTS ARE ENVISIONED TO BE   
INCORPORATED INTO THE PROJECT.  

00:58:22.288 --> 00:58:22.620
ELEMENTS ARE ENVISIONED TO BE   
INCORPORATED INTO THE PROJECT.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       

00:58:22.622 --> 00:58:24.889
INCORPORATED INTO THE PROJECT.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       
SO THERE ARE SOME BUMP OUTS     

00:58:24.891 --> 00:58:25.757
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       
SO THERE ARE SOME BUMP OUTS     
KNOW A BIKE LANE WITH           

00:58:25.759 --> 00:58:26.491
SO THERE ARE SOME BUMP OUTS     
KNOW A BIKE LANE WITH           
DELINEATOR AND THEORY DOES HAVE 

00:58:26.493 --> 00:58:29.694
KNOW A BIKE LANE WITH           
DELINEATOR AND THEORY DOES HAVE 
THAT LANE NARROWING EFFECT AND  

00:58:29.696 --> 00:58:30.394
DELINEATOR AND THEORY DOES HAVE 
THAT LANE NARROWING EFFECT AND  
SHOULD HAVE A POSITIVE          

00:58:30.396 --> 00:58:32.764
THAT LANE NARROWING EFFECT AND  
SHOULD HAVE A POSITIVE          
CONTRIBUTION ON SPEEDS.         

00:58:32.766 --> 00:58:33.865
SHOULD HAVE A POSITIVE          
CONTRIBUTION ON SPEEDS.         
IF WE GO WITH A DIFFERENT       

00:58:33.867 --> 00:58:36.468
CONTRIBUTION ON SPEEDS.         
IF WE GO WITH A DIFFERENT       
OPTION THEN THAT&amp;apos;S FINE.        

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:44.275
IF WE GO WITH A DIFFERENT       
OPTION THEN THAT&amp;apos;S FINE.        
BUT THE ONLY THE HESITATION AND 

00:58:44.277 --> 00:58:44.976
OPTION THEN THAT&amp;apos;S FINE.        
BUT THE ONLY THE HESITATION AND 
RESISTANCE YOU HEAR FROM STAFF  

00:58:44.978 --> 00:58:45.677
BUT THE ONLY THE HESITATION AND 
RESISTANCE YOU HEAR FROM STAFF  
ABOUT TRYING TO INCORPORATE     

00:58:45.679 --> 00:58:48.479
RESISTANCE YOU HEAR FROM STAFF

CERTAIN TRAFFIC CALMING         
ELEMENTS INTO A CAPITAL PROJECT 

00:58:52.086 --> 00:58:53.218
CERTAIN TRAFFIC CALMING         
ELEMENTS INTO A CAPITAL PROJECT 
IS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE AN         

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:53.952

WE&amp;apos;VE DONE A TRAFFIC CALMING    

00:59:04.898 --> 00:59:08.199
WE CAN KEEP UP WITH AT THE TIME 
WE&amp;apos;VE DONE A TRAFFIC CALMING    
PROJECT RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER 

00:59:08.201 --> 00:59:09.367
WE&amp;apos;VE DONE A TRAFFIC CALMING    
PROJECT RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER 
FROM HERE ON THE SITE, A CHURCH

AND THAT WAS PRETTY WELL VETTED 

01:04:17.844 --> 01:04:19.977
BY REDUCING SPEEDS.             
AND THAT WAS PRETTY WELL VETTED 
IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THIS IS

PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THAT         
REMOVING IT FROM ONLY ONE SIDE  
WOULD BE BETTER THAN REMOVING   

01:12:34.374 --> 01:12:35.038
REMOVING IT FROM ONLY ONE SIDE  
WOULD BE BETTER THAN REMOVING   
FROM TWO SIDES.                 

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.273
WOULD BE BETTER THAN REMOVING

INTEGRATION OF SPEED MANAGEMENT 
.                               
I&amp;apos;M JUST GOING TO POINT OUT     

01:17:47.686 --> 01:17:50.787
.                               
I&amp;apos;M JUST GOING TO POINT OUT     
THAT IF I THINK THAT IF WE IF   

01:17:50.789 --> 01:17:57.495
I&amp;apos;M JUST GOING TO POINT OUT     
THAT IF I THINK THAT IF WE IF   
WE&amp;apos;RE A CITY APPROACHING THIS   

01:18:12.177 --> 01:18:14.211
FROM THE STARTING POINT THAT    
WAS KIND OF LEADING THE SPEECH  
SPEED MANAGEMENT ON A           

01:18:14.213 --> 01:18:15.011
WAS KIND OF LEADING THE SPEECH  
SPEED MANAGEMENT ON A           
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET LIKE THIS   

01:18:15.013 --> 01:18:15.746
SPEED MANAGEMENT ON A           
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET LIKE THIS   
WE MIGHT END UP WITH A VERY     

01:18:15.748 --> 01:18:16.480
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET LIKE THIS   
WE MIGHT END UP WITH A VERY     
DIFFERENT DESIGN THAT THAN SOME 

01:18:16.482 --> 01:18:17.081
WE MIGHT END UP WITH A VERY     
DIFFERENT DESIGN THAT THAN SOME 
OF THE DESIGNS THAT WERE        

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:17.681
DIFFERENT DESIGN THAT THAN SOME 
OF THE DESIGNS THAT WERE        
APPROVED LAST MONTH.            

01:18:17.683 --> 01:18:18.415
OF THE DESIGNS THAT WERE        
APPROVED LAST MONTH.            
AND SO I THINK IT WHEN IT       

01:18:18.417 --> 01:18:19.083
APPROVED LAST MONTH.            
AND SO I THINK IT WHEN IT       
BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED   

01:18:19.085 --> 01:18:19.950
AND SO I THINK IT WHEN IT       
BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED   
FOR STAFF TO TRY TO MELT SOME   

01:18:19.952 --> 01:18:20.551
BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED   
FOR STAFF TO TRY TO MELT SOME   
OF THIS TOGETHER AND END UP     

01:18:20.553 --> 01:18:21.418
FOR STAFF TO TRY TO MELT SOME   
OF THIS TOGETHER AND END UP     
WITH A WITH A DESIGN THAT WORKS 

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.020
OF THIS TOGETHER AND END UP     
WITH A WITH A DESIGN THAT WORKS 
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE POINT IS TO HAVE   

01:18:23.022 --> 01:18:23.920
WITH A WITH A DESIGN THAT WORKS 
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE POINT IS TO HAVE   
THIS ACTUALLY FUNCTION LIKE A   

01:18:23.922 --> 01:18:27.458
BUT IT&amp;apos;S THE POINT IS TO HAVE   
THIS ACTUALLY FUNCTION LIKE A   
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET LIKE IN MY  

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:30.728
THIS ACTUALLY FUNCTION LIKE A   
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET LIKE IN MY  
OPINION IT SHOULD IT SHOULD     

01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:31.729
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET LIKE IN MY  
OPINION IT SHOULD IT SHOULD     
FUNCTION AND YOU KNOW, THAT&amp;apos;S   

01:18:31.731 --> 01:18:34.765
OPINION IT SHOULD IT SHOULD     
FUNCTION AND YOU KNOW, THAT&amp;apos;S   
NOT THE SAME DESIGN NECESSARILY 

01:18:34.767 --> 01:18:36.033
FUNCTION AND YOU KNOW, THAT&amp;apos;S   
NOT THE SAME DESIGN NECESSARILY 
THAT WE END UP WITH ON AN       

01:18:36.035 --> 01:18:36.366
NOT THE SAME DESIGN NECESSARILY 
THAT WE END UP WITH ON AN       
ARTERIAL.                       

01:18:36.368 --> 01:18:36.634
THAT WE END UP WITH ON AN       
ARTERIAL.                       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH.

OF THE BIKE LANE AND THE WIDTH  

02:05:52.268 --> 02:05:56.237
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WIDTH  
OF THE BIKE LANE AND THE WIDTH  
THE BUFFER AND I THOUGHT I HAD  

02:05:56.239 --> 02:05:57.005
OF THE BIKE LANE AND THE WIDTH  
THE BUFFER AND I THOUGHT I HAD  
IT AND THEN THERE WAS A BIKE    

02:05:57.007 --> 02:06:00.341
THE BUFFER AND I THOUGHT I HAD  
IT AND THEN THERE WAS A BIKE    
LANE THAT WAS ABOUT SIX FEET    

02:06:00.343 --> 02:06:03.811
IT AND THEN THERE WAS A BIKE    
LANE THAT WAS ABOUT SIX FEET    
WIDE WITH A NARROW BUFFER AND   

02:06:03.813 --> 02:06:04.979
LANE THAT WAS ABOUT SIX FEET    
WIDE WITH A NARROW BUFFER AND   
AND THEN I I LOST I WAS LIKE    

02:06:04.981 --> 02:06:08.049
WIDE WITH A NARROW BUFFER AND   
AND THEN I I LOST I WAS LIKE    
NO, I WAS EXPECTING THE BIKE    

02:06:08.051 --> 02:06:11.685
AND THEN I I LOST I WAS LIKE    
NO, I WAS EXPECTING THE BIKE    
LANE TO BE MORE LIKE FIVE FEET  

02:06:11.687 --> 02:06:12.587
NO, I WAS EXPECTING THE BIKE    
LANE TO BE MORE LIKE FIVE FEET  
WITH A FOOT AND A HALF BUFFER   

02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:14.522
LANE TO BE MORE LIKE FIVE FEET  
WITH A FOOT AND A HALF BUFFER   
AND I JUST WONDERED HOW YOU     

02:06:14.524 --> 02:06:19.026
WITH A FOOT AND A HALF BUFFER   
AND I JUST WONDERED HOW YOU     
MADE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THE    

02:06:19.028 --> 02:06:25.966
AND I JUST WONDERED HOW YOU     
MADE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THE    
MOST PART WE DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT  

02:06:25.968 --> 02:06:26.734
MADE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THE    
MOST PART WE DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT  
OF ROOM LIKE THAT THRESHOLD     

02:06:26.736 --> 02:06:29.970
MOST PART WE DIDN&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT  
OF ROOM LIKE THAT THRESHOLD     
WHERE OH THE BIKE LANE SIX FEET 

02:06:29.972 --> 02:06:30.904
OF ROOM LIKE THAT THRESHOLD     
WHERE OH THE BIKE LANE SIX FEET 
AND SO NOW WE CAN CONSIDER A    

02:06:30.906 --> 02:06:33.107
WHERE OH THE BIKE LANE SIX FEET 
AND SO NOW WE CAN CONSIDER A    
LARGER BUFFER.                  

02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:37.111
AND SO NOW WE CAN CONSIDER A    
LARGER BUFFER.                  
WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T MADE THOSE FINE      

02:06:37.113 --> 02:06:37.712
LARGER BUFFER.                  
WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T MADE THOSE FINE      
TUNED DECISIONS YET.            

02:06:37.714 --> 02:06:41.349
WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T MADE THOSE FINE      
TUNED DECISIONS YET.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER  

02:06:41.351 --> 02:06:45.720
TUNED DECISIONS YET.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER  
ON THE PROJECT HAS HAS BEEN ON  

02:06:45.722 --> 02:06:49.857
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER  
ON THE PROJECT HAS HAS BEEN ON  
LEAVE AND SO NOW THAT SHE&amp;apos;S     

02:06:49.859 --> 02:06:50.591
ON THE PROJECT HAS HAS BEEN ON  
LEAVE AND SO NOW THAT SHE&amp;apos;S     
BACK WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO GET THAT    

02:06:50.593 --> 02:06:53.727
LEAVE AND SO NOW THAT SHE&amp;apos;S     
BACK WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO GET THAT    
FINAL FINAL DETAILS WORKED OUT  

02:06:53.729 --> 02:07:00.534
BACK WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO GET THAT    
FINAL FINAL DETAILS WORKED OUT  
SO THAT THAT IS A GOOD POINT.   

02:07:00.536 --> 02:07:01.568
FINAL FINAL DETAILS WORKED OUT  
SO THAT THAT IS A GOOD POINT.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS A RELATIVELY EASY    

02:07:01.570 --> 02:07:02.303
SO THAT THAT IS A GOOD POINT.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS A RELATIVELY EASY    
THING TO ADDRESS RIGHT THROUGH. 

02:07:02.305 --> 02:07:04.405
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS A RELATIVELY EASY    
THING TO ADDRESS RIGHT THROUGH. 
I MEAN THAT&amp;apos;S THAT SHIFTING     

02:07:04.407 --> 02:07:05.272
THING TO ADDRESS RIGHT THROUGH. 
I MEAN THAT&amp;apos;S THAT SHIFTING     
OF THOSE LONG LINES AS WE CALL  

02:07:05.274 --> 02:07:09.076
I MEAN THAT&amp;apos;S THAT SHIFTING     
OF THOSE LONG LINES AS WE CALL  
THEM, THOSE KIND OF LONGITUDE.  

02:07:09.078 --> 02:07:10.244
OF THOSE LONG LINES AS WE CALL  
THEM, THOSE KIND OF LONGITUDE.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE LINES ARE PRETTY EASY TO 

02:07:10.246 --> 02:07:12.679
THEM, THOSE KIND OF LONGITUDE.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE LINES ARE PRETTY EASY TO 
TO SHIFT AROUND AND THEN SOME   

02:07:12.681 --> 02:07:13.580
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE LINES ARE PRETTY EASY TO 
TO SHIFT AROUND AND THEN SOME   
OF THE BIKE LANES WHEREAS NOW   

02:07:13.582 --> 02:07:16.984
TO SHIFT AROUND AND THEN SOME   
OF THE BIKE LANES WHEREAS NOW   
AS I THINK FOUR FEET WITH THE   

02:07:16.986 --> 02:07:20.421
OF THE BIKE LANES WHEREAS NOW   
AS I THINK FOUR FEET WITH THE   
NARROWEST ONE WITHOUT TOO MUCH  

02:07:20.423 --> 02:07:20.855
AS I THINK FOUR FEET WITH THE   
NARROWEST ONE WITHOUT TOO MUCH  
OF A BUFFER.                    

02:07:20.857 --> 02:07:21.655
NARROWEST ONE WITHOUT TOO MUCH  
OF A BUFFER.                    
I JUST WONDER WHAT THE          

02:07:21.657 --> 02:07:23.724
OF A BUFFER.                    
I JUST WONDER WHAT THE          
GUIDELINES ARE FOR THE WIDTH    

02:07:23.726 --> 02:07:27.128
I JUST WONDER WHAT THE          
GUIDELINES ARE FOR THE WIDTH    
OF BIKE LANES.                  

02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:28.195
GUIDELINES ARE FOR THE WIDTH    
OF BIKE LANES.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I UNDERSTAND THE          

02:07:28.197 --> 02:07:34.268
OF BIKE LANES.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I UNDERSTAND THE          
GUIDELINE WOULD BE THAT FOUR    

02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:41.342
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I UNDERSTAND THE          
GUIDELINE WOULD BE THAT FOUR    
BUT WIDE IS A MINIMAL SO        

02:07:41.344 --> 02:07:45.847
GUIDELINE WOULD BE THAT FOUR    
BUT WIDE IS A MINIMAL SO        
OF COURSE THE MORE THE MERRIER. 

02:07:45.849 --> 02:07:46.047
BUT WIDE IS A MINIMAL SO        
OF COURSE THE MORE THE MERRIER. 
RIGHT.                          

02:07:46.049 --> 02:07:49.083
OF COURSE THE MORE THE MERRIER. 
RIGHT.                          
WE WANT MORE FOR MORE           

02:07:49.085 --> 02:07:52.419
RIGHT.                          
WE WANT MORE FOR MORE           
COMFORT BUT FOREFOOT IS A       

02:07:52.421 --> 02:07:56.290
WE WANT MORE FOR MORE           
COMFORT BUT FOREFOOT IS A       
MINIMUM AND FIVE FOOT IS

AND SO THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT   
THE BIG PICTURE AND THE DEMAND  
ON ON THAT PARKING AS IT        

02:11:07.916 --> 02:11:11.518
THE BIG PICTURE AND THE DEMAND  
ON ON THAT PARKING AS IT        
RELATES TO THE BICYCLE NETWORK. 

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:15.723
ON ON THAT PARKING AS IT        
RELATES TO THE BICYCLE NETWORK. 
SO IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT IF IF 

02:11:15.725 --> 02:11:19.025
RELATES TO THE BICYCLE NETWORK. 
SO IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT IF IF 
WE COULD MOVE MORE TOWARDS AN   

02:11:19.027 --> 02:11:21.796
SO IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT IF IF 
WE COULD MOVE MORE TOWARDS AN   
ALL AGES AND ABILITIES NETWORK  

02:11:21.798 --> 02:11:22.730
WE COULD MOVE MORE TOWARDS AN   
ALL AGES AND ABILITIES NETWORK  
THAT WOULD GIVE THEM MORE       

02:11:22.732 --> 02:11:27.234
ALL AGES AND ABILITIES NETWORK  
THAT WOULD GIVE THEM MORE       
REASON TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE   

02:11:27.236 --> 02:11:27.701
THAT WOULD GIVE THEM MORE       
REASON TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE   
THE PARKING.                    

02:11:27.703 --> 02:11:30.604
REASON TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE   
THE PARKING.                    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WITH THE SCOPE OF THIS   

02:11:30.606 --> 02:11:34.008
THE PARKING.                    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WITH THE SCOPE OF THIS   
PROJECT WE HAD DIFFICULTY       

02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:37.844
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WITH THE SCOPE OF THIS   
PROJECT WE HAD DIFFICULTY       
MAKING THAT HAPPEN AT THIS TIME 

02:11:37.846 --> 02:11:38.112
PROJECT WE HAD DIFFICULTY       
MAKING THAT HAPPEN AT THIS TIME

PARKING THAT ARE PREVENTING     
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO ALL AGES AND     
ABILITIES BECAUSE WELL SO AS

ABILITIES BECAUSE WELL SO AS    
WE&amp;apos;VE AS WE TOUCHED TOUCHED ON  
IN JUNE AND AS IT WAS BROUGHT

WE&amp;apos;VE AS WE TOUCHED TOUCHED ON  
IN JUNE AND AS IT WAS BROUGHT   
UP EARLIER TONIGHT, THE TREE    

02:12:05.274 --> 02:12:08.208
IN JUNE AND AS IT WAS BROUGHT   
UP EARLIER TONIGHT, THE TREE    
LINE TRAIL HAS A PORTION HERE   

02:12:08.210 --> 02:12:09.342
UP EARLIER TONIGHT, THE TREE    
LINE TRAIL HAS A PORTION HERE   
AND WE&amp;apos;VE CITY STAFF LOOKED AT  

02:12:09.344 --> 02:12:13.748
LINE TRAIL HAS A PORTION HERE   
AND WE&amp;apos;VE CITY STAFF LOOKED AT  
THAT INCORPORATING IT INTO THIS 

02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:16.450
AND WE&amp;apos;VE CITY STAFF LOOKED AT  
THAT INCORPORATING IT INTO THIS 
PROJECT.                        

02:12:16.452 --> 02:12:17.551
THAT INCORPORATING IT INTO THIS 
PROJECT.                        
BUT THIS WAS SUCH A SHORT       

02:12:17.553 --> 02:12:21.321
PROJECT.                        
BUT THIS WAS SUCH A SHORT       
SEGMENT SO THEN WE EVEN TRIED   

02:12:21.323 --> 02:12:24.191
BUT THIS WAS SUCH A SHORT       
SEGMENT SO THEN WE EVEN TRIED   
TO EVALUATE EVALUATE WHAT WOULD 

02:12:24.193 --> 02:12:25.325
SEGMENT SO THEN WE EVEN TRIED   
TO EVALUATE EVALUATE WHAT WOULD 
TAKE HOW HOW FAR WOULD WE HAVE  

02:12:25.327 --> 02:12:29.096
TO EVALUATE EVALUATE WHAT WOULD 
TAKE HOW HOW FAR WOULD WE HAVE  
TO CHASE THIS TO A CYCLE TRACK  

02:12:29.098 --> 02:12:31.499
TAKE HOW HOW FAR WOULD WE HAVE  
TO CHASE THIS TO A CYCLE TRACK  
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN?     

02:12:31.501 --> 02:12:32.633
TO CHASE THIS TO A CYCLE TRACK  
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN?     
HOW MUCH HOW MANY FUNDS WOULD   

02:12:32.635 --> 02:12:35.368
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN?     
HOW MUCH HOW MANY FUNDS WOULD   
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH?        

02:12:35.370 --> 02:12:39.439
HOW MUCH HOW MANY FUNDS WOULD   
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH?        
AND IT BECAME CLEAR PRETTY      

02:12:39.441 --> 02:12:43.677
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH?        
AND IT BECAME CLEAR PRETTY      
QUICKLY THAT THIS REALLY NEEDED 

02:12:43.679 --> 02:12:44.211
AND IT BECAME CLEAR PRETTY      
QUICKLY THAT THIS REALLY NEEDED 
TO BE STUDIED.                  

02:12:44.213 --> 02:12:46.480
QUICKLY THAT THIS REALLY NEEDED 
TO BE STUDIED.                  
THIS THIS REALLY NEEDED TO BE   

02:12:46.482 --> 02:12:50.350
TO BE STUDIED.                  
THIS THIS REALLY NEEDED TO BE   
LOOKED AT THE BIG PICTURE       

02:12:50.352 --> 02:12:54.388
THIS THIS REALLY NEEDED TO BE   
LOOKED AT THE BIG PICTURE       
OF THE BICYCLE NETWORK AND      

02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:55.322
LOOKED AT THE BIG PICTURE       
OF THE BICYCLE NETWORK AND      
WHETHER IT&amp;apos;S TWO WAY CYCLE      

02:12:55.324 --> 02:12:58.058
OF THE BICYCLE NETWORK AND      
WHETHER IT&amp;apos;S TWO WAY CYCLE      
TRACKS OR ITS SEPARATED, YOU    

02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:02.129
WHETHER IT&amp;apos;S TWO WAY CYCLE      
TRACKS OR ITS SEPARATED, YOU    
KNOW, IN IT IN DIRECTION BIKE   

02:13:02.131 --> 02:13:06.133
TRACKS OR ITS SEPARATED, YOU    
KNOW, IN IT IN DIRECTION BIKE   
LANE THERE THERE WERE THERE WAS 

02:13:06.135 --> 02:13:09.870
KNOW, IN IT IN DIRECTION BIKE   
LANE THERE THERE WERE THERE WAS 
A LOT GOING ON BEYOND THE SCOPE 

02:13:09.872 --> 02:13:10.604
LANE THERE THERE WERE THERE WAS 
A LOT GOING ON BEYOND THE SCOPE 
OF THIS PROJECT AND THIS        

02:13:10.606 --> 02:13:13.573
A LOT GOING ON BEYOND THE SCOPE 
OF THIS PROJECT AND THIS        
PROJECT HEADED A TIGHT TIMELINE 

02:13:13.575 --> 02:13:13.774
OF THIS PROJECT AND THIS        
PROJECT HEADED A TIGHT TIMELINE 
.                               

02:13:13.776 --> 02:13:14.908
PROJECT HEADED A TIGHT TIMELINE 
.                               
SO IT WAS BASED ON DISCUSSIONS  

02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:18.378
.                               
SO IT WAS BASED ON DISCUSSIONS  
WITH THE D.A. AND HOW THEY      

02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:21.649
SO IT WAS BASED ON DISCUSSIONS  
WITH THE D.A. AND HOW THEY      
WANTED YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED    

02:13:21.651 --> 02:13:22.716
WITH THE D.A. AND HOW THEY      
WANTED YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED    
MORE OF THE ALL AGES AND        

02:13:22.718 --> 02:13:25.953
WANTED YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED    
MORE OF THE ALL AGES AND        
ABILITIES PART OF THE NETWORK   

02:13:25.955 --> 02:13:29.055
MORE OF THE ALL AGES AND        
ABILITIES PART OF THE NETWORK   
THAT WE COULDN&amp;apos;T DELIVER ON     

02:13:29.057 --> 02:13:33.093
ABILITIES PART OF THE NETWORK   
THAT WE COULDN&amp;apos;T DELIVER ON     
THIS TIMELINE.                  

02:13:33.095 --> 02:13:37.397
THAT WE COULDN&amp;apos;T DELIVER ON     
THIS TIMELINE.                  
SO SO BASED ON THE SO THEY      

02:13:37.399 --> 02:13:40.834
THIS TIMELINE.                  
SO SO BASED ON THE SO THEY      
WEREN&amp;apos;T WILLING TO REMOVE THE   

02:13:40.836 --> 02:13:44.704
SO SO BASED ON THE SO THEY      
WEREN&amp;apos;T WILLING TO REMOVE THE   
PARKING WITHOUT A COMMITMENT TO 

02:13:44.706 --> 02:13:45.639
WEREN&amp;apos;T WILLING TO REMOVE THE   
PARKING WITHOUT A COMMITMENT TO 
A LARGER SEGMENT OF ALL AGES    

02:13:45.641 --> 02:13:48.642
PARKING WITHOUT A COMMITMENT TO 
A LARGER SEGMENT OF ALL AGES    
AND ABILITIES NETWORK.          

02:13:48.644 --> 02:13:49.510
A LARGER SEGMENT OF ALL AGES    
AND ABILITIES NETWORK.          
IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT?        

02:13:49.512 --> 02:13:52.179
AND ABILITIES NETWORK.          
IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT?        
WELL, WE COULDN&amp;apos;T WE COULDN&amp;apos;T   

02:13:52.181 --> 02:13:52.847
IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT?        
WELL, WE COULDN&amp;apos;T WE COULDN&amp;apos;T   
GET THE BOLLARDS IN BECAUSE     

02:13:52.849 --> 02:13:55.749
WELL, WE COULDN&amp;apos;T WE COULDN&amp;apos;T   
GET THE BOLLARDS IN BECAUSE     
OF THE MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT    

02:13:55.751 --> 02:13:59.553
GET THE BOLLARDS IN BECAUSE     
OF THE MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT    
AND THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN 

02:13:59.555 --> 02:14:03.857
OF THE MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT    
AND THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION THE   

02:14:03.859 --> 02:14:04.624
AND THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION THE   
NEXT STEP WAS CONSIDERING THE   

02:14:04.626 --> 02:14:07.528
THE THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION THE   
NEXT STEP WAS CONSIDERING THE   
TWO WAY CYCLE TRACK BUT THE TWO 

02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:08.328
NEXT STEP WAS CONSIDERING THE   
TWO WAY CYCLE TRACK BUT THE TWO 
WAY CYCLE TRACK WAS SO          

02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:14.601
TWO WAY CYCLE TRACK BUT THE TWO 
WAY CYCLE TRACK WAS SO          
DISJOINTED AND SO WE JUST KEPT  

02:14:14.603 --> 02:14:15.736
WAY CYCLE TRACK WAS SO          
DISJOINTED AND SO WE JUST KEPT  
RUNNING INTO WELL WE CAN&amp;apos;T DO   

02:14:15.738 --> 02:14:16.237
DISJOINTED AND SO WE JUST KEPT  
RUNNING INTO WELL WE CAN&amp;apos;T DO   
THIS BECAUSE OF THAT.           

02:14:16.239 --> 02:14:18.972
RUNNING INTO WELL WE CAN&amp;apos;T DO   
THIS BECAUSE OF THAT.           
WE CAN&amp;apos;T DO THIS BECAUSE        

02:14:18.974 --> 02:14:23.076
THIS BECAUSE OF THAT.           
WE CAN&amp;apos;T DO THIS BECAUSE        
OF THAT THAT IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S A LARGER 

02:14:23.078 --> 02:14:24.010
WE CAN&amp;apos;T DO THIS BECAUSE        
OF THAT THAT IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S A LARGER 
BIGGER PICTURE TO BE LOOKED AT  

02:14:24.012 --> 02:14:26.880
OF THAT THAT IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S A LARGER 
BIGGER PICTURE TO BE LOOKED AT  
RIGHT.                          

02:14:26.882 --> 02:14:27.748
BIGGER PICTURE TO BE LOOKED AT  
RIGHT.                          
I MEAN TO ME THE PARTLY THE

RIGHT.                          
I MEAN TO ME THE PARTLY THE     
BIGGER PICTURE IS WHAT JONATHAN 

02:14:28.618 --> 02:14:29.650
I MEAN TO ME THE PARTLY THE     
BIGGER PICTURE IS WHAT JONATHAN 
LEVINE MENTIONED IN PUBLIC      

02:14:29.652 --> 02:14:30.617
BIGGER PICTURE IS WHAT JONATHAN 
LEVINE MENTIONED IN PUBLIC      
COMMENT WHICH IS LIKE WE&amp;apos;VE     

02:14:30.619 --> 02:14:34.254

IS THIS PLAN SO IF WHEN WE GET  

02:14:52.641 --> 02:14:53.507
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&amp;apos;M CURIOUS HOW ADJUSTABLE   
IS THIS PLAN SO IF WHEN WE GET  
THE MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT, CAN  

02:14:53.509 --> 02:14:57.377
IS THIS PLAN SO IF WHEN WE GET  
THE MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT, CAN  
WE THEN REMOVE PARKING AND      

02:14:57.379 --> 02:15:01.047
THE MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT, CAN  
WE THEN REMOVE PARKING AND      
RESTRIKE LIKE IS THAT HOW LONG  

02:15:01.049 --> 02:15:01.981
WE THEN REMOVE PARKING AND      
RESTRIKE LIKE IS THAT HOW LONG  
ARE WE STUCK WITH THIS VERSION

IS MY EVEN EVEN THE D.A.        
RECOGNIZED THAT THIS WAS SORT   

02:15:08.323 --> 02:15:13.193
IS MY EVEN EVEN THE D.A.        
RECOGNIZED THAT THIS WAS SORT   
OF A TEMPORARY SOLUTION, THAT

AS FAR AS THE MAINTENANCE       
EQUIPMENT BEING ABLE TO         
MAINTAIN A FOUR FOOT BIKE LANE  

02:18:57.886 --> 02:19:01.955
EQUIPMENT BEING ABLE TO         
MAINTAIN A FOUR FOOT BIKE LANE  
THAT I AM UNSURE OF .           

02:19:01.957 --> 02:19:05.959
MAINTAIN A FOUR FOOT BIKE LANE  
THAT I AM UNSURE OF .           
YEAH I MEAN TO BUILD THAT POINT 

02:19:05.961 --> 02:19:06.893
THAT I AM UNSURE OF .           
YEAH I MEAN TO BUILD THAT POINT 
TO RECITE IT IS SOMETHING WE    

02:19:06.895 --> 02:19:07.594
YEAH I MEAN TO BUILD THAT POINT 
TO RECITE IT IS SOMETHING WE    
ARE LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL       

02:19:07.596 --> 02:19:10.497
TO RECITE IT IS SOMETHING WE    
ARE LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL       
DIMENSIONS, HOW NARROW WE CAN   

02:19:10.499 --> 02:19:10.764
ARE LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL       
DIMENSIONS, HOW NARROW WE CAN   
GO.                             

02:19:10.766 --> 02:19:11.565
DIMENSIONS, HOW NARROW WE CAN   
GO.                             
WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE TRYING TO DO IS      

02:19:11.567 --> 02:19:14.568
GO.                             
WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE TRYING TO DO IS      
TARGET FIVE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE 

02:19:14.570 --> 02:19:15.502
WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE TRYING TO DO IS      
TARGET FIVE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE 
PIECE OF MOST MOST OF THE PIECE 

02:19:15.504 --> 02:19:17.671
TARGET FIVE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE 
PIECE OF MOST MOST OF THE PIECE 
OF EQUIPMENT A FIVE FOOT THERE  

02:19:17.673 --> 02:19:18.405
PIECE OF MOST MOST OF THE PIECE 
OF EQUIPMENT A FIVE FOOT THERE  
ARE SOME PIECES THAT CAN GO     

02:19:18.407 --> 02:19:22.009
OF EQUIPMENT A FIVE FOOT THERE  
ARE SOME PIECES THAT CAN GO     
DOWN TO AS LITTLE AS FOUR FEET. 

02:19:22.011 --> 02:19:22.942
ARE SOME PIECES THAT CAN GO     
DOWN TO AS LITTLE AS FOUR FEET. 
SO I THINK IT JUST DEPENDS ON   

02:19:22.944 --> 02:19:25.011
DOWN TO AS LITTLE AS FOUR FEET. 
SO I THINK IT JUST DEPENDS ON   
WHERE WE LAND AND THEN MAKING   

02:19:25.013 --> 02:19:25.712
SO I THINK IT JUST DEPENDS ON   
WHERE WE LAND AND THEN MAKING   
SURE THAT WE&amp;apos;RE HAVING          

02:19:25.714 --> 02:19:26.380
WHERE WE LAND AND THEN MAKING   
SURE THAT WE&amp;apos;RE HAVING          
FACILITIES THAT ARE COMPATIBLE  

02:19:26.382 --> 02:19:29.449

FACILITIES THAT ARE COMPATIBLE  
WITH THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.   

02:19:29.451 --> 02:19:30.384
FACILITIES THAT ARE COMPATIBLE  
WITH THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.   
SO IT IS DEFINITELY ON OUR      

02:19:30.386 --> 02:19:33.020
WITH THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.   
SO IT IS DEFINITELY ON OUR

02:19:33.022 --> 02:19:33.687
SO IT IS DEFINITELY ON OUR      
RADAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE&amp;apos;RE   
DESIGNING FACILITIES THAT CAN

ALONG THAT CORRIDOR SO I LOOK   

02:21:18.761 --> 02:21:19.759
HAS A LOT MORE BUSSES OPERATE   
ALONG THAT CORRIDOR SO I LOOK   
AT SOME NUMBERS I THINK I       

02:21:19.761 --> 02:21:22.763
ALONG THAT CORRIDOR SO I LOOK   
AT SOME NUMBERS I THINK I       
LEARNED THAT SEGMENT OF STATE   

02:21:22.765 --> 02:21:26.799
AT SOME NUMBERS I THINK I       
LEARNED THAT SEGMENT OF STATE   
STREET WE GOT QUITE A FEW BUS   

02:21:26.801 --> 02:21:27.467
LEARNED THAT SEGMENT OF STATE   
STREET WE GOT QUITE A FEW BUS   
STOPS BEFORE THE BUS STOP.      

02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:30.403
STREET WE GOT QUITE A FEW BUS   
STOPS BEFORE THE BUS STOP.      
I THINK IT WILL MAKE BUS        

02:21:30.405 --> 02:21:31.071
STOPS BEFORE THE BUS STOP.      
I THINK IT WILL MAKE BUS        
OPERATIONS EASIER IF IT&amp;apos;S A     

02:21:31.073 --> 02:21:34.274
I THINK IT WILL MAKE BUS        
OPERATIONS EASIER IF IT&amp;apos;S A     
PROTECTED YOU CAN TELL YOU KNOW 

02:21:34.276 --> 02:21:38.745
OPERATIONS EASIER IF IT&amp;apos;S A     
PROTECTED YOU CAN TELL YOU KNOW 
YOU HAVE TO DESIGN CUT OFF AND  

02:21:38.747 --> 02:21:39.946
PROTECTED YOU CAN TELL YOU KNOW 
YOU HAVE TO DESIGN CUT OFF AND  
MOVE INTO A BIKE LANE WHICH WE  

02:21:39.948 --> 02:21:42.682
YOU HAVE TO DESIGN CUT OFF AND  
MOVE INTO A BIKE LANE WHICH WE  
DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO SEE IF IT&amp;apos;S A     

02:21:42.684 --> 02:21:43.417
MOVE INTO A BIKE LANE WHICH WE  
DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO SEE IF IT&amp;apos;S A     
PROTECTED BIKE LANES SO BUSSES  

02:21:43.419 --> 02:21:46.285
DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO SEE IF IT&amp;apos;S A     
PROTECTED BIKE LANES SO BUSSES  
WILL HAVE TO STOP I MEAN        

02:21:46.287 --> 02:21:49.489
PROTECTED BIKE LANES SO BUSSES  
WILL HAVE TO STOP I MEAN        
LOADING CUSTOMERS ON THE BIKE   

02:21:49.491 --> 02:21:50.456
WILL HAVE TO STOP I MEAN        
LOADING CUSTOMERS ON THE BIKE   
ON THE PROTECTIVE BIKE WHICH    

02:21:50.458 --> 02:21:54.360
LOADING CUSTOMERS ON THE BIKE   
ON THE PROTECTIVE BIKE WHICH    
BASICALLY CREATED SOME          

02:21:54.362 --> 02:21:55.095
ON THE PROTECTIVE BIKE WHICH    
BASICALLY CREATED SOME          
CONFLICTS BETWEEN PEDESTRIAN    

02:21:55.097 --> 02:21:58.131
BASICALLY CREATED SOME          
CONFLICTS BETWEEN PEDESTRIAN    
FOOT TRAFFIC AND THE CYCLIST I  

02:21:58.133 --> 02:22:01.702
CONFLICTS BETWEEN PEDESTRIAN    
FOOT TRAFFIC AND THE CYCLIST I  
WOULD SAY POTENTIALLY INTRODUCE 

02:22:01.704 --> 02:22:02.302
FOOT TRAFFIC AND THE CYCLIST I  
WOULD SAY POTENTIALLY INTRODUCE 
SOME SAFETY CONCERNS.           

02:22:02.304 --> 02:22:04.738
WOULD SAY POTENTIALLY INTRODUCE 
SOME SAFETY CONCERNS.           
OF COURSE THERE IS A WAY TO     

02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:05.671
SOME SAFETY CONCERNS.           
OF COURSE THERE IS A WAY TO     
WORK AROUND IT WITH PROPER      

02:22:05.673 --> 02:22:09.275
OF COURSE THERE IS A WAY TO     
WORK AROUND IT WITH PROPER

02:22:33.369 --> 02:22:36.335
ANYWAYS I JUST WANT TO BRING    
THAT TO EVERYBODY&amp;apos;S ATTENTION   
WHEN WE DESIGNED THOSE LANES WE

THAT TO EVERYBODY&amp;apos;S ATTENTION   
WHEN WE DESIGNED THOSE LANES WE 
NEED TO, YOU KNOW, BE

JUST REAL QUICKLY TO ANSWER     

02:29:41.629 --> 02:29:45.098
TRANSPORTATION GOALS HERE.      
JUST REAL QUICKLY TO ANSWER     
YOUR FIRST QUESTION, IT LOOKS   

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:45.832
JUST REAL QUICKLY TO ANSWER     
YOUR FIRST QUESTION, IT LOOKS   
LIKE BOTH HILL AND STATE ARE    

02:29:45.834 --> 02:29:48.935
YOUR FIRST QUESTION, IT LOOKS   
LIKE BOTH HILL AND STATE ARE    
OVER TEN THOUSAND BASED ON SOME 

02:29:48.937 --> 02:29:50.035
LIKE BOTH HILL AND STATE ARE    
OVER TEN THOUSAND BASED ON SOME 
TRAFFIC COME BUT I JUST QUICKLY 

02:29:50.037 --> 02:29:56.309
OVER TEN THOUSAND BASED ON SOME 
TRAFFIC COME BUT I JUST QUICKLY 
ACCESS OK AS FAR AS THE TWO WAY 

02:29:56.311 --> 02:30:00.947
TRAFFIC COME BUT I JUST QUICKLY 
ACCESS OK AS FAR AS THE TWO WAY 
CYCLE TRACK SO SOME OF SOME     

02:30:00.949 --> 02:30:04.850
ACCESS OK AS FAR AS THE TWO WAY 
CYCLE TRACK SO SOME OF SOME     
OF THE INFORMATION I&amp;apos;VE         

02:30:04.852 --> 02:30:08.488
CYCLE TRACK SO SOME OF SOME     
OF THE INFORMATION I&amp;apos;VE         
GATHERED FROM TRANSPORTATION    

02:30:08.490 --> 02:30:13.159
OF THE INFORMATION I&amp;apos;VE         
GATHERED FROM TRANSPORTATION    
ENGINEERS IS THAT TO CYCLE      

02:30:13.161 --> 02:30:15.795
GATHERED FROM TRANSPORTATION    
ENGINEERS IS THAT TO CYCLE      
TRACKS MAKE A LOT OF SENSE OR   

02:30:15.797 --> 02:30:19.733
ENGINEERS IS THAT TO CYCLE      
TRACKS MAKE A LOT OF SENSE OR   
AT LEAST MAKE MORE SENSE IN THE 

02:30:19.735 --> 02:30:23.636
TRACKS MAKE A LOT OF SENSE OR   
AT LEAST MAKE MORE SENSE IN THE 
DOWNTOWN AREA WHERE THERE IS    

02:30:23.638 --> 02:30:27.506
AT LEAST MAKE MORE SENSE IN THE 
DOWNTOWN AREA WHERE THERE IS    
JUST A I GUESS A DIFFERENT      

02:30:27.508 --> 02:30:34.814
DOWNTOWN AREA WHERE THERE IS    
JUST A I GUESS A DIFFERENT      
USAGE AND A DIFFERENT SPEED IN  

02:30:34.816 --> 02:30:35.381
JUST A I GUESS A DIFFERENT      
USAGE AND A DIFFERENT SPEED IN  
THE DOWNTOWN AREA.              

02:30:35.383 --> 02:30:39.118
USAGE AND A DIFFERENT SPEED IN  
THE DOWNTOWN AREA.              
SO THEN YOU GET TO STATE SOUTH  

02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:45.225
THE DOWNTOWN AREA.              
SO THEN YOU GET TO STATE SOUTH  
OF HOOVER AND                   

02:30:59.907 --> 02:31:02.374
              WE&amp;apos;VE GOT         
DRIVEWAY CONFLICTS AND WE&amp;apos;VE    
GOT JUST A DIFFERENT FEEL.      

02:31:02.376 --> 02:31:03.276
DRIVEWAY CONFLICTS AND WE&amp;apos;VE    
GOT JUST A DIFFERENT FEEL.      
MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE TWO  

02:31:03.278 --> 02:31:03.943
GOT JUST A DIFFERENT FEEL.      
MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE TWO  
WAY CYCLE TRACK THAT IS         

02:31:03.945 --> 02:31:04.744
MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE TWO  
WAY CYCLE TRACK THAT IS         
PROPOSED AS PART OF THE TREE    

02:31:04.746 --> 02:31:05.511
WAY CYCLE TRACK THAT IS         
PROPOSED AS PART OF THE TREE    
LINE TRAIL IS MORE OF A         

02:31:05.513 --> 02:31:06.746
PROPOSED AS PART OF THE TREE    
LINE TRAIL IS MORE OF A         
RECREATION FACILITY AND NOT AS  

02:31:06.748 --> 02:31:07.546
LINE TRAIL IS MORE OF A         
RECREATION FACILITY AND NOT AS  
MUCH OF A COMMUTER FACILITY.    

02:31:07.548 --> 02:31:09.014
RECREATION FACILITY AND NOT AS  
MUCH OF A COMMUTER FACILITY.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW CAN IT DOUBLE I IMAGINE  

02:31:09.016 --> 02:31:10.149
MUCH OF A COMMUTER FACILITY.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW CAN IT DOUBLE I IMAGINE  
IT WOULD IF WE COULD MAKE THAT  

02:31:10.151 --> 02:31:13.619
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW CAN IT DOUBLE I IMAGINE  
IT WOULD IF WE COULD MAKE THAT  
FUNCTIONAL.                     

02:31:13.621 --> 02:31:14.821
IT WOULD IF WE COULD MAKE THAT  
FUNCTIONAL.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO YES, THAT PART OF IT WAS  

02:31:14.823 --> 02:31:17.490
FUNCTIONAL.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO YES, THAT PART OF IT WAS  
THE KOOKINESS I MEAN WE HAD     

02:31:17.492 --> 02:31:21.327
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO YES, THAT PART OF IT WAS  
THE KOOKINESS I MEAN WE HAD     
CONSIDERED TAKING A TWO WAY     

02:31:21.329 --> 02:31:22.294
THE KOOKINESS I MEAN WE HAD     
CONSIDERED TAKING A TWO WAY     
CYCLE TRACK FROM THE SOUTH END  

02:31:22.296 --> 02:31:25.498
CONSIDERED TAKING A TWO WAY     
CYCLE TRACK FROM THE SOUTH END  
OF THIS PROJECT GRANGER OR EVEN 

02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:26.332
CYCLE TRACK FROM THE SOUTH END  
OF THIS PROJECT GRANGER OR EVEN 
PAINT AND POSTED ALL THE WAY    

02:31:26.334 --> 02:31:28.701
OF THIS PROJECT GRANGER OR EVEN 
PAINT AND POSTED ALL THE WAY    
DOWN TO STIMPSON AND THEN TAKE  

02:31:28.703 --> 02:31:32.738
PAINT AND POSTED ALL THE WAY    
DOWN TO STIMPSON AND THEN TAKE  
IT ALL THE WAY TO SAORVIEW AND  

02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:33.405
DOWN TO STIMPSON AND THEN TAKE  
IT ALL THE WAY TO SAORVIEW AND  
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?      

02:31:33.407 --> 02:31:36.809
IT ALL THE WAY TO SAORVIEW AND  
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?      
WELL, SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT 

02:31:36.811 --> 02:31:40.479
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?      
WELL, SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT 
IS THAT SOUTH OF HOOVER IT      

02:31:40.481 --> 02:31:41.280
WELL, SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT 
IS THAT SOUTH OF HOOVER IT      
WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS ON    

02:31:41.282 --> 02:31:44.316
IS THAT SOUTH OF HOOVER IT      
WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS ON    
THE WEST SIDE OF THE STREET AND 

02:31:44.318 --> 02:31:44.750
WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS ON    
THE WEST SIDE OF THE STREET AND 
NORTH OF HILL.                  

02:31:44.752 --> 02:31:45.884
THE WEST SIDE OF THE STREET AND 
NORTH OF HILL.                  
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS ON 

02:31:45.886 --> 02:31:48.220
NORTH OF HILL.                  
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS ON 
THE EAST SIDE OF THE STREET.    

02:31:48.222 --> 02:31:49.054
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS ON 
THE EAST SIDE OF THE STREET.    
SO THERE WERE DEFINITE          

02:31:49.056 --> 02:31:51.858
THE EAST SIDE OF THE STREET.    
SO THERE WERE DEFINITE          
LOGISTICS THAT GOT IN THE WAY   

02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:56.362
SO THERE WERE DEFINITE          
LOGISTICS THAT GOT IN THE WAY   
AND THEN THE THE BUDGET AND THE 

02:31:56.364 --> 02:31:56.962
LOGISTICS THAT GOT IN THE WAY   
AND THEN THE THE BUDGET AND THE 
THE STUDYING AND THE            

02:31:56.964 --> 02:31:57.430
AND THEN THE THE BUDGET AND THE 
THE STUDYING AND THE            
CONNECTIVITY.                   

02:31:57.432 --> 02:32:00.233
THE STUDYING AND THE            
CONNECTIVITY.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO YES, THERE WERE JUST  

02:32:00.235 --> 02:32:02.334
CONNECTIVITY.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO YES, THERE WERE JUST  
A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS TO IT.   

02:32:02.336 --> 02:32:07.106
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO YES, THERE WERE JUST  
A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS TO IT.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW THAT THE THE TENDS TO 

02:32:07.108 --> 02:32:14.146
A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS TO IT.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW THAT THE THE TENDS TO 
LOOK AT THE BECAUSE IT CAN BE A 

02:32:14.148 --> 02:32:18.183
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I KNOW THAT THE THE TENDS TO 
LOOK AT THE BECAUSE IT CAN BE A 
VERY EFFICIENT USE OF SPACE BUT 

02:32:18.185 --> 02:32:22.855
LOOK AT THE BECAUSE IT CAN BE A 
VERY EFFICIENT USE OF SPACE BUT 
WE RAN INTO A LOT OF ISSUES     

02:32:22.857 --> 02:32:23.889
VERY EFFICIENT USE OF SPACE BUT 
WE RAN INTO A LOT OF ISSUES     
WITH IT IN ORDER TO MAKE IT     

02:32:23.891 --> 02:32:27.026
WE RAN INTO A LOT OF ISSUES     
WITH IT IN ORDER TO MAKE IT     
WORK WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS   

02:32:27.028 --> 02:32:27.426
WITH IT IN ORDER TO MAKE IT     
WORK WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS   
PROJECT.

I THINK WHEN WE WERE INITIALLY  
VETTING THE IDEA THAT TO A      
CYCLE TRACK EARLY IN THE        

02:32:35.337 --> 02:32:37.970
VETTING THE IDEA THAT TO A      
CYCLE TRACK EARLY IN THE        
PROCESS WE HAD HEARD SOME       

02:32:37.972 --> 02:32:41.240
CYCLE TRACK EARLY IN THE        
PROCESS WE HAD HEARD SOME       
CONCERN FROM SOME OF THE        

02:32:41.242 --> 02:32:42.307
PROCESS WE HAD HEARD SOME       
CONCERN FROM SOME OF THE

OF STATE THAT WERE CONCERNED    

02:32:45.746 --> 02:32:46.512
NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE EAST SIDE  
OF STATE THAT WERE CONCERNED    
OVER THE CROSSOVERS THAT YOU&amp;apos;D

HAVE TO CROSS OVER STATE TO GET 
TO THE CYCLE TRACK.             

02:32:50.652 --> 02:32:53.952
HAVE TO CROSS OVER STATE TO GET 
TO THE CYCLE TRACK.             
THERE WASN&amp;apos;T A VERY GOOD
