00:08:46.884 --> 00:08:47.750
LOCATION TO THE TEMPORARY       
GENERATOR AND THAT&apos;S THE BASIS  
OF OF THEIR REJECTION OF OUR

I&apos;D LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHY SO WHEN 

00:08:57.795 --> 00:08:58.594
WITH THIS WITH THIS POSITION.   
I&apos;D LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHY SO WHEN 
SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE OF A TEMP 

00:08:58.596 --> 00:09:02.097
I&apos;D LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHY SO WHEN 
SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE OF A TEMP 
OF THE TEMPORARY GENERATOR      

00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:03.099
SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE OF A TEMP 
OF THE TEMPORARY GENERATOR      
WOULD BE REQUIRED AND IN MY     

00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:05.167
OF THE TEMPORARY GENERATOR      
WOULD BE REQUIRED AND IN MY     
VIEW MAINTENANCE ON THE         

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:05.768
WOULD BE REQUIRED AND IN MY     
VIEW MAINTENANCE ON THE         
TEMPORARY GENERATOR ISN&apos;T       

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.438
VIEW MAINTENANCE ON THE

THREE HUNDRED HOURS OF RUNTIME  
TEMPORARY.                      
SO YOU&apos;D BE WRONG IN THIS       

00:09:13.944 --> 00:09:17.346
TEMPORARY.                      
SO YOU&apos;D BE WRONG IN THIS       
BUSINESS WE THAT THAT AMOUNT    

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:18.213
SO YOU&apos;D BE WRONG IN THIS       
BUSINESS WE THAT THAT AMOUNT    
OF TIME IS YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S IT&apos;S

00:09:38.002 --> 00:09:40.702
     THE AMOUNT OF TIME SO SO   
IT&apos;S UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD     
REALLY GET TO MEET THE          

00:09:40.704 --> 00:09:41.037
IT&apos;S UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD     
REALLY GET TO MEET THE          
SITUATION.

REALLY GET TO MEET THE          
SITUATION.                      
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS        

00:09:41.672 --> 00:09:42.405
SITUATION.

BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS        
DISCUSSION, LET&apos;S ASSUME WE DO  
GET TO THAT POINT SOMEHOW AND   

00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:43.940
DISCUSSION, LET&apos;S ASSUME WE DO  
GET TO THAT POINT SOMEHOW AND   
WHEN MAINTENANCE IS REQUIRED    

00:09:43.942 --> 00:09:44.607
GET TO THAT POINT SOMEHOW AND   
WHEN MAINTENANCE IS REQUIRED    
THE WAY IT&apos;S PERFORMED IS YOU   

00:09:44.609 --> 00:09:45.341
WHEN MAINTENANCE IS REQUIRED    
THE WAY IT&apos;S PERFORMED IS YOU   
DON&apos;T DISCONNECT THE GENERATOR. 

00:09:45.343 --> 00:09:46.142
THE WAY IT&apos;S PERFORMED IS YOU   
DON&apos;T DISCONNECT THE GENERATOR. 
THE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO IT AND 

00:09:46.144 --> 00:09:46.809
DON&apos;T DISCONNECT THE GENERATOR. 
THE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO IT AND 
DURING THE MAINTENANCE THEY     

00:09:46.811 --> 00:09:47.610
THE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO IT AND 
DURING THE MAINTENANCE THEY     
THEY THEY MAY HAVE TO TURN THE

DURING THE MAINTENANCE THEY     
THEY THEY MAY HAVE TO TURN THE  
OFF AT TIMES SOME OF SOMETHING

THEY THEY MAY HAVE TO TURN THE  
OFF AT TIMES SOME OF SOMETHING  
LIKE THEY CAN DO IT&apos;S PLUGGED   

00:09:49.414 --> 00:09:50.012
OFF AT TIMES SOME OF SOMETHING  
LIKE THEY CAN DO IT&apos;S PLUGGED   
IN ON OTHER MAINTENANCE.        

00:09:50.014 --> 00:09:51.981
LIKE THEY CAN DO IT&apos;S PLUGGED   
IN ON OTHER MAINTENANCE.        
THEY NEED TO TURN IT.           

00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:53.315
IN ON OTHER MAINTENANCE.        
THEY NEED TO TURN IT.           
BUT IF AND AGAIN THIS IS KIND   

00:09:53.317 --> 00:09:56.151
THEY NEED TO TURN IT.           
BUT IF AND AGAIN THIS IS KIND   
OF WHISKAS LIGHTING SITUATION   

00:09:56.153 --> 00:09:56.919
BUT IF AND AGAIN THIS IS KIND   
OF WHISKAS LIGHTING SITUATION   
BUT IF SOMEBODY WAS OUT FOR     

00:09:56.921 --> 00:09:59.755
OF WHISKAS LIGHTING SITUATION   
BUT IF SOMEBODY WAS OUT FOR     
MAINTENANCE ON THE GENERATOR    

00:09:59.757 --> 00:10:00.856
BUT IF SOMEBODY WAS OUT FOR     
MAINTENANCE ON THE GENERATOR    
AND IT WAS AT A POINT WHERE IT  

00:10:00.858 --> 00:10:04.494
MAINTENANCE ON THE GENERATOR    
AND IT WAS AT A POINT WHERE IT  
WAS TURNED OFF AND AT THAT      

00:10:04.496 --> 00:10:05.294
AND IT WAS AT A POINT WHERE IT  
WAS TURNED OFF AND AT THAT      
EXACT MOMENT WE HAD AN          

00:10:05.296 --> 00:10:08.230
WAS TURNED OFF AND AT THAT      
EXACT MOMENT WE HAD AN          
INTERRUPTION MORE POWER THAN    

00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:11.700
EXACT MOMENT WE HAD AN          
INTERRUPTION MORE POWER THAN    
THE MAINTENANCE TO JUST STOP    

00:10:11.702 --> 00:10:12.401
INTERRUPTION MORE POWER THAN    
THE MAINTENANCE TO JUST STOP    
IT&apos;S TURNED BACK ON.            

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:16.205
THE MAINTENANCE TO JUST STOP    
IT&apos;S TURNED BACK ON.            
SO IT&apos;S IT&apos;S NOT A SITUATION    

00:10:16.207 --> 00:10:19.208
IT&apos;S TURNED BACK ON.            
SO IT&apos;S IT&apos;S NOT A SITUATION    
WITHOUT POWER AND ADDITION, IF  

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.075
SO IT&apos;S IT&apos;S NOT A SITUATION    
WITHOUT POWER AND ADDITION, IF  
THERE WERE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

SITUATION OR LET&apos;S SAY A        

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.047
THERE WERE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
SITUATION OR LET&apos;S SAY A        
TEMPORARY GENERATOR REQUIRES    

00:10:24.049 --> 00:10:27.282
SITUATION OR LET&apos;S SAY A        
TEMPORARY GENERATOR REQUIRES    
SOME KIND OF REPAIR SIMILAR TO

TEMPORARY GENERATOR REQUIRES    
SOME KIND OF REPAIR SIMILAR TO  
THE PERMANENT GENERATOR REQUIRE

SOME KIND OF REPAIR SIMILAR TO  
THE PERMANENT GENERATOR REQUIRE 
REPAIR.                         

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:31.787
THE PERMANENT GENERATOR REQUIRE 
REPAIR.                         
WELL, AND THAT SITUATION        

00:10:31.789 --> 00:10:32.422
REPAIR.                         
WELL, AND THAT SITUATION        
REGARDLESS OF WHICH GENERATOR   

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:35.357
WELL, AND THAT SITUATION        
REGARDLESS OF WHICH GENERATOR   
NEEDED REPAIR, IT&apos;S THE SAME    

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:38.894
REGARDLESS OF WHICH GENERATOR   
NEEDED REPAIR, IT&apos;S THE SAME    
EXACT STEPS A CALL WAS MADE TO  

00:10:38.896 --> 00:10:39.795
NEEDED REPAIR, IT&apos;S THE SAME    
EXACT STEPS A CALL WAS MADE TO  
SOMEONE ELSE AND WE HAVE A      

00:10:39.797 --> 00:10:41.731
EXACT STEPS A CALL WAS MADE TO  
SOMEONE ELSE AND WE HAVE A      
TEMPORARY GENERATOR DELIVERED

SOMEONE ELSE AND WE HAVE A      
TEMPORARY GENERATOR DELIVERED   
TO THE SITE.

TO THE SITE.                    
IF THE PERMANENT WERE IN PLACE  
YOU WOULD JUST BRING WE ALONG   

00:10:46.137 --> 00:10:47.003
IF THE PERMANENT WERE IN PLACE  
YOU WOULD JUST BRING WE ALONG   
WITH A TEMPORARY GENERATOR PLUG 

00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:50.305
YOU WOULD JUST BRING WE ALONG   
WITH A TEMPORARY GENERATOR PLUG

LET&apos;S SAY FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE  
WEREN&apos;T HERE.                   
THE PERMANENT GENERATOR CAME    

00:22:31.075 --> 00:22:33.942
WEREN&apos;T HERE.                   
THE PERMANENT GENERATOR CAME    
WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO AND WAS 

00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:34.810
THE PERMANENT GENERATOR CAME    
WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO AND WAS 
INSTALLED WHEN WE GOT OUR       

00:22:34.812 --> 00:22:38.379
WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO AND WAS 
INSTALLED WHEN WE GOT OUR

DAYS LATER THE THING TURNS OUT  
TO BE A LEMON AND IT DOESN&apos;T    
WORK IN THAT CASE WE WOULD      

00:22:44.454 --> 00:22:45.253
TO BE A LEMON AND IT DOESN&apos;T    
WORK IN THAT CASE WE WOULD      
ORDER A TEMPORARY GENERATOR,    

00:22:45.255 --> 00:22:48.857
WORK IN THAT CASE WE WOULD      
ORDER A TEMPORARY GENERATOR,    
PLUG IT IN AS IS PROVIDED FOR   

00:22:48.859 --> 00:22:49.858
ORDER A TEMPORARY GENERATOR,    
PLUG IT IN AS IS PROVIDED FOR   
AND IT WOULD RUN UNTIL WE HAVE  

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.894
PLUG IT IN AS IS PROVIDED FOR   
AND IT WOULD RUN UNTIL WE HAVE  
A PERMANENT GENERATOR REPAIRED, 

00:22:52.896 --> 00:22:53.695
AND IT WOULD RUN UNTIL WE HAVE  
A PERMANENT GENERATOR REPAIRED, 
REPLACED OR WHATEVER THE CASE

A PERMANENT GENERATOR REPAIRED, 
REPLACED OR WHATEVER THE CASE   
MAY BE.                         

00:22:53.964 --> 00:22:57.432

THE NSA THAT LIMITS THE AMOUNT  
TYING THE TEMPORARY GENERATOR   

00:23:16.453 --> 00:23:17.186
THE NSA THAT LIMITS THE AMOUNT  
TYING THE TEMPORARY GENERATOR   
CAN RUN AND THAT SCENARIO THAT  

00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:19.855
TYING THE TEMPORARY GENERATOR   
CAN RUN AND THAT SCENARIO THAT  
I JUST OUTLINED.

WE CAN&apos;T SATISFY EVERY ONE      
OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS.          
WE&apos;VE BEEN TRYING GOOD FAITH    

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.063
OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS.          
WE&apos;VE BEEN TRYING GOOD FAITH    
AND WE CAN GET IT MOST OF THE   

00:25:08.065 --> 00:25:08.463
WE&apos;VE BEEN TRYING GOOD FAITH    
AND WE CAN GET IT MOST OF THE   
WAY THERE.                      

00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:11.299
AND WE CAN GET IT MOST OF THE   
WAY THERE.                      
BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE    

00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:12.100
WAY THERE.                      
BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE    
JUST CAN&apos;T MAKE HAPPEN BECAUSE  

00:25:12.102 --> 00:25:14.836
BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE    
JUST CAN&apos;T MAKE HAPPEN BECAUSE  
IT IS BY DEFINITION TEMPORARY   

00:25:14.838 --> 00:25:15.103
JUST CAN&apos;T MAKE HAPPEN BECAUSE  
IT IS BY DEFINITION TEMPORARY   
SO.                             

00:25:15.105 --> 00:25:18.106
IT IS BY DEFINITION TEMPORARY   
SO.                             
SO ALL THOSE THINGS ABOUT ALL   

00:25:18.108 --> 00:25:18.973
SO.                             
SO ALL THOSE THINGS ABOUT ALL   
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS GENERATOR 

00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:19.707
SO ALL THOSE THINGS ABOUT ALL   
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS GENERATOR 
ABOUT IS PERMANENT FEATURES.    

00:25:19.709 --> 00:25:22.677
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS GENERATOR 
ABOUT IS PERMANENT FEATURES.    
THEY THEY&apos;RE NOT GERMANE TO     

00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:25.880
ABOUT IS PERMANENT FEATURES.    
THEY THEY&apos;RE NOT GERMANE TO     
THIS NOTION THAT WE USE A       

00:25:25.882 --> 00:25:26.647
THEY THEY&apos;RE NOT GERMANE TO     
THIS NOTION THAT WE USE A       
TEMPORARY GENERATOR ON AN       

00:25:26.649 --> 00:25:29.818
THIS NOTION THAT WE USE A       
TEMPORARY GENERATOR ON AN       
INTERIM BASIS.                  

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.585
TEMPORARY GENERATOR ON AN       
INTERIM BASIS.                  
I UNDERSTAND THAT.              

00:25:30.587 --> 00:25:33.688
INTERIM BASIS.                  
I UNDERSTAND THAT.              
BUT THAT&apos;S NOT I MEAN THE

I UNDERSTAND THAT.              
BUT THAT&apos;S NOT I MEAN THE       
CONVERSATION WASN&apos;T REALLY

GOING THAT WAY.                 

00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:38.193
CONVERSATION WASN&apos;T REALLY      
GOING THAT WAY.                 
IT WAS SUGGESTING THAT THERE

TEMPORARY GENERATOR THE SAME    

00:31:49.399 --> 00:31:50.331
AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO USE THE 
TEMPORARY GENERATOR THE SAME    
WAY WE USED LIKE IN MY          

00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:51.132
TEMPORARY GENERATOR THE SAME    
WAY WE USED LIKE IN MY          
EXPLANATION IS TWO DAYS AFTER   

00:31:51.134 --> 00:31:53.401
WAY WE USED LIKE IN MY          
EXPLANATION IS TWO DAYS AFTER   
WE START THE THING NO LONGER

BIT OF NUANCE.                  
OBVIOUSLY WE BETTER BE A        
PERMANENT GENERATOR INSTALLED   

00:33:32.502 --> 00:33:32.900
OBVIOUSLY WE BETTER BE A        
PERMANENT GENERATOR INSTALLED   
PERIOD.

REASON THAT WE DON&apos;T HAVE IT    
WHICH I EXPECT THE PERMANENT    
GENERATOR TO BE AVAILABLE SO IT 

00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:46.080
WHICH I EXPECT THE PERMANENT    
GENERATOR TO BE AVAILABLE SO IT 
WHAT WE&apos;VE COMMUNICATED TO THE

GENERATOR TO BE AVAILABLE SO IT 
WHAT WE&apos;VE COMMUNICATED TO THE

YOU KNOW, I&apos;M NOT GOING TO      
DETAIL THEM ALL OUT HERE BUT    
WILL IT DO THE SAME EXACT THING 

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.576
DETAIL THEM ALL OUT HERE BUT    
WILL IT DO THE SAME EXACT THING 
UNTIL THE PERMANENT ONE IS IN   

00:40:55.578 --> 00:41:01.048
WILL IT DO THE SAME EXACT THING 
UNTIL THE PERMANENT ONE IS IN   
PLACE IF YOU CAN GET THAT AND   

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:06.754
UNTIL THE PERMANENT ONE IS IN   
PLACE IF YOU CAN GET THAT AND   
OF COURSE WIRE THE GENERATOR    

00:41:06.756 --> 00:41:10.958
PLACE IF YOU CAN GET THAT AND   
OF COURSE WIRE THE GENERATOR    
TYPICALLY BETWEEN YES.          

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:19.100
OF COURSE WIRE THE GENERATOR    
TYPICALLY BETWEEN YES.

THE EXACT SAME WAY AS THE       
PERMANENT.                      
SO EVERYTHING THAT WAS SERVED   

00:41:31.046 --> 00:41:34.248
PERMANENT.                      
SO EVERYTHING THAT WAS SERVED   
BY EMERGENCY SYSTEMS WITH THE   

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.049
SO EVERYTHING THAT WAS SERVED   
BY EMERGENCY SYSTEMS WITH THE   
PERMANENT GENERATOR IS ALSO     

00:41:35.051 --> 00:41:38.319
