00:21:58.477 --> 00:22:01.945
WHERE THIS WALL OF WINDOWS IS   
GOING.                          
IT WOULD BE SO THAT THE TWO     

00:22:01.947 --> 00:22:02.879
GOING.                          
IT WOULD BE SO THAT THE TWO     
STOREY PORTION HERE WOULD BE    

00:22:02.881 --> 00:22:06.450
IT WOULD BE SO THAT THE TWO     
STOREY PORTION HERE WOULD BE    
EXTRUDED OUT AND THEN A THREE   

00:22:06.452 --> 00:22:07.118
STOREY PORTION HERE WOULD BE    
EXTRUDED OUT AND THEN A THREE   
STOREY ADDITION PLACED ON TOP   

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.517
EXTRUDED OUT AND THEN A THREE   
STOREY ADDITION PLACED ON TOP   
OF THAT.                        

00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:10.754
STOREY ADDITION PLACED ON TOP   
OF THAT.                        
SO THIS WALL COMES BACK A       

00:22:10.756 --> 00:22:11.455
OF THAT.                        
SO THIS WALL COMES BACK A       
LITTLE THIS WALL COMES TO THE   

00:22:11.457 --> 00:22:13.657
SO THIS WALL COMES BACK A       
LITTLE THIS WALL COMES TO THE   
NORTH A LITTLE BIT NOW TO SHOW

YOU THAT ON DRAWINGS THERE ARE  
FLOOR PLANS PROVIDED.           

00:22:17.296 --> 00:22:21.098
YOU THAT ON DRAWINGS THERE ARE  
FLOOR PLANS PROVIDED.           
I WILL GO INTO THOSE IF ANYONE  

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.699

I WILL GO INTO THOSE IF ANYONE  
WANTS TO SEE THEM.              

00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:22.699
I WILL GO INTO THOSE IF ANYONE  
WANTS TO SEE THEM.              
BUT YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE     

00:22:22.701 --> 00:22:25.035
WANTS TO SEE THEM.              
BUT YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE     
FIRST FLOOR PLAN THERE ARE TWO  

00:22:25.037 --> 00:22:26.103
BUT YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE     
FIRST FLOOR PLAN THERE ARE TWO  
WINDOWS ARE A WINDOW AND A DOOR 

00:22:26.105 --> 00:22:26.671
FIRST FLOOR PLAN THERE ARE TWO  
WINDOWS ARE A WINDOW AND A DOOR 
HERE INSTEAD OF THE THREE       

00:22:26.673 --> 00:22:27.071
WINDOWS ARE A WINDOW AND A DOOR 
HERE INSTEAD OF THE THREE       
WINDOW BAY.                     

00:22:27.073 --> 00:22:29.506
HERE INSTEAD OF THE THREE       
WINDOW BAY.                     
SO THE THIRD WINDOW HAS NOW     

00:22:29.508 --> 00:22:32.209
WINDOW BAY.                     
SO THE THIRD WINDOW HAS NOW     
BEEN REMOVED AND THIS SHOULD    

00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:33.210
SO THE THIRD WINDOW HAS NOW     
BEEN REMOVED AND THIS SHOULD    
PUT THEM BACK SIMILARLY THIS IS 

00:22:33.212 --> 00:22:36.847
BEEN REMOVED AND THIS SHOULD    
PUT THEM BACK SIMILARLY THIS IS 
THE WHO I BELIEVE THIS IS       

00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:40.250
PUT THEM BACK SIMILARLY THIS IS 
THE WHO I BELIEVE THIS IS       
MARKED AS THE FORMER CORNER     

00:22:40.252 --> 00:22:40.651
THE WHO I BELIEVE THIS IS       
MARKED AS THE FORMER CORNER     
OF THE BUILDING.                

00:22:40.653 --> 00:22:44.421
MARKED AS THE FORMER CORNER     
OF THE BUILDING.                
SO NOW THE REAR CORNER HAS BEEN 

00:22:44.423 --> 00:22:45.322
OF THE BUILDING.                
SO NOW THE REAR CORNER HAS BEEN 
MOVED TO THE EAST TOWARD THE    

00:22:45.324 --> 00:22:47.157
SO NOW THE REAR CORNER HAS BEEN 
MOVED TO THE EAST TOWARD THE    
ALLEY.                          

00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:51.162
MOVED TO THE EAST TOWARD THE    
ALLEY.                          
I INCLUDED THE FOURTH AND THE   

00:22:51.164 --> 00:22:52.029
ALLEY.                          
I INCLUDED THE FOURTH AND THE   
FIFTH FLOOR PLANS HERE BECAUSE  

00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:55.031
I INCLUDED THE FOURTH AND THE   
FIFTH FLOOR PLANS HERE BECAUSE  
NOW YOU REMEMBER THE LAST       

00:22:55.033 --> 00:22:55.700
FIFTH FLOOR PLANS HERE BECAUSE  
NOW YOU REMEMBER THE LAST       
APPLICATION HAD A STEPPED BACK  

00:22:55.702 --> 00:22:59.403
NOW YOU REMEMBER THE LAST       
APPLICATION HAD A STEPPED BACK  
FOURTH FLOOR AND STEP BACK      

00:22:59.405 --> 00:23:00.204
APPLICATION HAD A STEPPED BACK  
FOURTH FLOOR AND STEP BACK      
FIFTH FLOOR OR MAYBE THEY WERE  

00:23:00.206 --> 00:23:00.871
FOURTH FLOOR AND STEP BACK      
FIFTH FLOOR OR MAYBE THEY WERE  
BOTH THE SAME DISTANCE.         

00:23:00.873 --> 00:23:03.540
FIFTH FLOOR OR MAYBE THEY WERE  
BOTH THE SAME DISTANCE.         
I THINK THEY ARE OFFSET NOW.    

00:23:03.542 --> 00:23:07.311
BOTH THE SAME DISTANCE.         
I THINK THEY ARE OFFSET NOW.    
THEY&apos;RE BOTH SET BACK 19 FEET.  

00:23:07.313 --> 00:23:08.445
I THINK THEY ARE OFFSET NOW.    
THEY&apos;RE BOTH SET BACK 19 FEET.  
SO THIS IS THE FOURTH FLOOR.    

00:23:08.447 --> 00:23:10.448
THEY&apos;RE BOTH SET BACK 19 FEET.  
SO THIS IS THE FOURTH FLOOR.    
THIS IS THE FIFTH STACK RIGHT   

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:11.315
SO THIS IS THE FOURTH FLOOR.    
THIS IS THE FIFTH STACK RIGHT

WE HAD A DISCUSSION AT THE      
REVIEW COMMITTEE ABOUT WHEN IT  
WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE          

00:24:47.947 --> 00:24:48.746
REVIEW COMMITTEE ABOUT WHEN IT  
WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE          
RECLAIMED HISTORIC BRICK AND

WHEN IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE  

00:24:49.548 --> 00:24:52.349
RECLAIMED HISTORIC BRICK AND    
WHEN IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE  
NEW BRICK BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE       

00:24:52.351 --> 00:24:53.283
WHEN IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE  
NEW BRICK BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE       
PROPOSING TO USE ON THE LOWER   

00:24:53.285 --> 00:24:56.086
NEW BRICK BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE       
PROPOSING TO USE ON THE LOWER   
LEVELS BRICK AND ON THE UPPER   

00:24:56.088 --> 00:24:59.723
PROPOSING TO USE ON THE LOWER   
LEVELS BRICK AND ON THE UPPER   
NEW LEVELS THE SPLIT FIRST      

00:24:59.725 --> 00:25:00.056
LEVELS BRICK AND ON THE UPPER   
NEW LEVELS THE SPLIT FIRST      
BLOCK.                          

00:25:00.058 --> 00:25:03.593
NEW LEVELS THE SPLIT FIRST      
BLOCK.                          
HOWEVER, SINCE THIS WALL WITH   

00:25:03.595 --> 00:25:04.328
BLOCK.                          
HOWEVER, SINCE THIS WALL WITH   
THE TWO WINDOWS IS BEING PULLED 

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.630
HOWEVER, SINCE THIS WALL WITH   
THE TWO WINDOWS IS BEING PULLED 
FORWARD, IT&apos;S NO LONGER IN THE  

00:25:07.632 --> 00:25:08.298
THE TWO WINDOWS IS BEING PULLED 
FORWARD, IT&apos;S NO LONGER IN THE  
LOCATION OF THE HISTORIC WALL.  

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.769
FORWARD, IT&apos;S NO LONGER IN THE  
LOCATION OF THE HISTORIC WALL.  
SO WE DISCUSSED THAT THIS       

00:25:11.771 --> 00:25:12.502
LOCATION OF THE HISTORIC WALL.  
SO WE DISCUSSED THAT THIS       
SHOULD COULD CERTAINLY I THINK  

00:25:12.504 --> 00:25:15.905
SO WE DISCUSSED THAT THIS       
SHOULD COULD CERTAINLY I THINK  
THE BRICK TO BE COMPATIBLE BUT  

00:25:15.907 --> 00:25:16.607
SHOULD COULD CERTAINLY I THINK  
THE BRICK TO BE COMPATIBLE BUT  
SHOULD NOT BE THE RECLAIMED     

00:25:16.609 --> 00:25:17.207
THE BRICK TO BE COMPATIBLE BUT  
SHOULD NOT BE THE RECLAIMED     
BRICK BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE     

00:25:17.209 --> 00:25:19.143
SHOULD NOT BE THE RECLAIMED     
BRICK BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE     
CONFUSING TO SEE OLD HISTORIC   

00:25:19.145 --> 00:25:19.810
BRICK BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE     
CONFUSING TO SEE OLD HISTORIC   
BRICK IN A PLACE WHERE THERE&apos;S  

00:25:19.812 --> 00:25:23.480
CONFUSING TO SEE OLD HISTORIC   
BRICK IN A PLACE WHERE THERE&apos;S  
NOT CURRENTLY A HISTORIC WALL.  

00:25:23.482 --> 00:25:27.050
BRICK IN A PLACE WHERE THERE&apos;S  
NOT CURRENTLY A HISTORIC WALL.  
SIMILARLY, THIS IS NOT DRAWN    

00:25:27.052 --> 00:25:30.687
NOT CURRENTLY A HISTORIC WALL.  
SIMILARLY, THIS IS NOT DRAWN    
WITH THE WINDOWS WHERE THEY     

00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:31.455
SIMILARLY, THIS IS NOT DRAWN    
WITH THE WINDOWS WHERE THEY     
CURRENTLY ARE OR THE DOOR       

00:25:31.457 --> 00:25:34.858
WITH THE WINDOWS WHERE THEY     
CURRENTLY ARE OR THE DOOR       
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE&apos;S A     

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.792
CURRENTLY ARE OR THE DOOR       
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE&apos;S A     
DOORWAY AND THEY WERE TALKING   

00:25:35.794 --> 00:25:38.895
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE&apos;S A     
DOORWAY AND THEY WERE TALKING   
ABOUT PULLING THIS WALL FARTHER 

00:25:38.897 --> 00:25:41.965
DOORWAY AND THEY WERE TALKING   
ABOUT PULLING THIS WALL FARTHER 
TO THE NORTH RIGHT NOW IT ENDS  

00:25:41.967 --> 00:25:45.602
ABOUT PULLING THIS WALL FARTHER 
TO THE NORTH RIGHT NOW IT ENDS  
ABOUT HERE BECAUSE THAT&apos;S WHERE 

00:25:45.604 --> 00:25:46.336
TO THE NORTH RIGHT NOW IT ENDS  
ABOUT HERE BECAUSE THAT&apos;S WHERE 
THAT THAT THIRD WINDOW IS.      

00:25:46.338 --> 00:25:46.670
ABOUT HERE BECAUSE THAT&apos;S WHERE 
THAT THAT THIRD WINDOW IS.      
YEAH.                           

00:25:46.672 --> 00:25:47.570
THAT THAT THIRD WINDOW IS.      
YEAH.                           
SO THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S A LITTLE     

00:25:47.572 --> 00:25:50.874
YEAH.                           
SO THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S A LITTLE     
PROBLEM STILL HERE WITH THIS    

00:25:50.876 --> 00:25:51.274

CREATING THAT FALSE HISTORY OR  
MISLEADING AND THAT IS          

00:53:57.661 --> 00:54:00.695
CREATING THAT FALSE HISTORY OR  
MISLEADING AND THAT IS          
CERTAINLY GOES AGAINST THE      

00:54:00.697 --> 00:54:01.030
MISLEADING AND THAT IS          
CERTAINLY GOES AGAINST THE      
STANDARDS.                      

00:54:01.032 --> 00:54:08.437
CERTAINLY GOES AGAINST THE      
STANDARDS.                      
I ALSO FEEL THAT THE CITY IS    

00:54:08.439 --> 00:54:12.474
STANDARDS.                      
I ALSO FEEL THAT THE CITY IS    
UNDER THE SECRETARY&apos;S           

00:54:12.476 --> 00:54:16.377
I ALSO FEEL THAT THE CITY IS    
UNDER THE SECRETARY&apos;S           
GUIDELINES MASONRY NOT          

00:54:16.379 --> 00:54:19.614
UNDER THE SECRETARY&apos;S           
GUIDELINES MASONRY NOT          
RECOMMENDED REPLACING OR        

00:54:19.616 --> 00:54:23.284
GUIDELINES MASONRY NOT          
RECOMMENDED REPLACING OR        
REBUILDING A MAJOR PORTION      

00:54:23.286 --> 00:54:24.053
RECOMMENDED REPLACING OR        
REBUILDING A MAJOR PORTION      
OF THE EXTERIOR MASONRY WALLS   

00:54:24.055 --> 00:54:27.122
REBUILDING A MAJOR PORTION      
OF THE EXTERIOR MASONRY WALLS   
THAT CAN BE REPAIRED SO THAT AS 

00:54:27.124 --> 00:54:28.057
OF THE EXTERIOR MASONRY WALLS   
THAT CAN BE REPAIRED SO THAT AS 
A RESULT THE BUILDING IS NO     

00:54:28.059 --> 00:54:28.857
THAT CAN BE REPAIRED SO THAT AS 
A RESULT THE BUILDING IS NO     
LONGER HISTORIC AND ESSENTIALLY 

00:54:28.859 --> 00:54:29.390
A RESULT THE BUILDING IS NO     
LONGER HISTORIC AND ESSENTIALLY 
A NEW CONSTRUCTION.             

00:54:29.392 --> 00:54:31.693
LONGER HISTORIC AND ESSENTIALLY 
A NEW CONSTRUCTION.             
I THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT OF THAT   

00:54:31.695 --> 00:54:34.229
A NEW CONSTRUCTION.             
I THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT OF THAT   
GOING ON STILL ON THE SIDE THE  

00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:38.333
I THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT OF THAT   
GOING ON STILL ON THE SIDE THE  
THE PROPERTY.                   

00:54:38.335 --> 00:54:42.404
GOING ON STILL ON THE SIDE THE  
THE PROPERTY.                   
SO KIND OF THOSE TWO IDEAS.     

00:54:42.406 --> 00:54:43.605
THE PROPERTY.                   
SO KIND OF THOSE TWO IDEAS.     
SO I MEAN THE WAY WE HAVE       

00:54:43.607 --> 00:54:46.141
SO KIND OF THOSE TWO IDEAS.     
SO I MEAN THE WAY WE HAVE       
BUILDING THE BLOCK IS GOING ALL 

00:54:46.143 --> 00:54:49.945
SO I MEAN THE WAY WE HAVE       
BUILDING THE BLOCK IS GOING ALL 
THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND IN   

00:54:49.947 --> 00:54:50.646
BUILDING THE BLOCK IS GOING ALL 
THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND IN   
THE BRICK BECAUSE BEEN YOU&apos;RE   

00:54:50.648 --> 00:54:53.582
THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND IN   
THE BRICK BECAUSE BEEN YOU&apos;RE   
ON THE FRONT OF THAT TO CREATE  

00:54:53.584 --> 00:54:54.516
THE BRICK BECAUSE BEEN YOU&apos;RE   
ON THE FRONT OF THAT TO CREATE  
THE STUFF SO IT COULD BE EASY   

00:54:54.518 --> 00:54:57.252
ON THE FRONT OF THAT TO CREATE  
THE STUFF SO IT COULD BE EASY   
FOR US TO JUST TAKE THE BRICK   

00:54:57.254 --> 00:55:00.422
THE STUFF SO IT COULD BE EASY   
FOR US TO JUST TAKE THE BRICK   
OFF AND PUT THE IN DOING JUST   

00:55:00.424 --> 00:55:01.223
FOR US TO JUST TAKE THE BRICK   
OFF AND PUT THE IN DOING JUST   
CONTINUE BUILDING STRAIGHT DOWN 

00:55:01.225 --> 00:55:04.360
OFF AND PUT THE IN DOING JUST   
CONTINUE BUILDING STRAIGHT DOWN 
AND NOT TRYING TO REPLICATE BUT 

00:55:04.362 --> 00:55:09.031
CONTINUE BUILDING STRAIGHT DOWN 
AND NOT TRYING TO REPLICATE BUT 
I GUESS OK, THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.  

00:55:09.033 --> 00:55:12.134
AND NOT TRYING TO REPLICATE BUT 
I GUESS OK, THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.  
AND THEN THE THE OTHER PART IS  

00:55:12.136 --> 00:55:12.600
I GUESS OK, THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.  
AND THEN THE THE OTHER PART IS  
IS ADDITIONS.                   

00:55:12.602 --> 00:55:15.837
AND THEN THE THE OTHER PART IS  
IS ADDITIONS.                   
WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE&apos;S A     

00:55:15.839 --> 00:55:16.472
IS ADDITIONS.                   
WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE&apos;S A     
QUESTION OF REMOVING HISTORIC   

00:55:16.474 --> 00:55:19.574
WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE&apos;S A     
QUESTION OF REMOVING HISTORIC   
MATERIALS WHICH THAT RARE       

00:55:19.576 --> 00:55:23.645
QUESTION OF REMOVING HISTORIC   
MATERIALS WHICH THAT RARE       
ELEVATION IS HISTORIC AND IT&apos;S  

00:55:23.647 --> 00:55:26.381
MATERIALS WHICH THAT RARE       
ELEVATION IS HISTORIC AND IT&apos;S  
CONTRIBUTING YOU COULD ARGUE IS 

00:55:26.383 --> 00:55:27.315
ELEVATION IS HISTORIC AND IT&apos;S  
CONTRIBUTING YOU COULD ARGUE IS 
THE MOST DEFINING PART OF THE   

00:55:27.317 --> 00:55:27.649
CONTRIBUTING YOU COULD ARGUE IS 
THE MOST DEFINING PART OF THE   
BUILDING.                       

00:55:27.651 --> 00:55:27.916
THE MOST DEFINING PART OF THE   
BUILDING.                       
NO.

NO.                             
SO THAT&apos;S WHY THE STANDARDS SAY 
IF YOU WANT TO BUILD AN         

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:35.357
SO THAT&apos;S WHY THE STANDARDS SAY 
IF YOU WANT TO BUILD AN         
ADDITION YOU SHOULD BUILD ON    

00:55:35.359 --> 00:55:36.158
IF YOU WANT TO BUILD AN

00:55:38.629 --> 00:55:39.694
THE LEASE CHARACTER DEFINING

SO THAT&apos;S THE REAR OF THE       

00:55:39.696 --> 00:55:42.798
PART OF OF THE BUILDING.        
SO THAT&apos;S THE REAR OF THE       
BUILDING IN THIS CASE I&apos;M NOT
