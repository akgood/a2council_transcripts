DURING THESE STORMS             
ENVIRONMENTS THAT I'VE TALKED   
ABOUT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRE  

00:38:42.013 --> 00:38:45.681
ENVIRONMENTS THAT I'VE TALKED   
ABOUT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRE  
STATIONS THAT LOSE POWER FAST   

00:38:45.683 --> 00:38:46.349
ABOUT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRE  
STATIONS THAT LOSE POWER FAST   
STATIONS THAT DO NOT HAVE       

00:38:46.351 --> 00:38:47.016
STATIONS THAT LOSE POWER FAST   
STATIONS THAT DO NOT HAVE       
SUFFICIENT ALTERNATE BACKUP     

00:38:47.018 --> 00:38:50.520
STATIONS THAT DO NOT HAVE       
SUFFICIENT ALTERNATE BACKUP     
POWER MAKING THEM HAVE TO MOVE  

00:38:50.522 --> 00:38:53.790
SUFFICIENT ALTERNATE BACKUP     
POWER MAKING THEM HAVE TO MOVE  
TO ANOTHER FIREHOUSE TO         

00:38:53.792 --> 00:38:54.590
POWER MAKING THEM HAVE TO MOVE  
TO ANOTHER FIREHOUSE TO         
FUNCTION WHICH INCREASES YOUR

00:38:58.229 --> 00:38:58.994
FUNCTION WHICH INCREASES YOUR

SERVICE SECONDS MATTER.         

00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:07.903
RESPONDING FROM WITHIN THE FIRE 
SERVICE SECONDS MATTER.         
THE OTHER THING THAT HAS BEEN   

00:39:07.905 --> 00:39:11.608
SERVICE SECONDS MATTER.         
THE OTHER THING THAT HAS BEEN   
REALLY GRATING FOR ME AND YOU   

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:12.742
THE OTHER THING THAT HAS BEEN   
REALLY GRATING FOR ME AND YOU   
HEARD ME ADDRESS THIS A YEAR    

00:39:12.744 --> 00:39:13.610
REALLY GRATING FOR ME AND YOU   
HEARD ME ADDRESS THIS A YEAR    
AGO I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN    

00:39:13.612 --> 00:39:15.911
HEARD ME ADDRESS THIS A YEAR    
AGO I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN    
TONIGHT.                        

00:39:15.913 --> 00:39:17.080
AGO I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN    
TONIGHT.                        
THE FIRE SERVICE IS ONE OF THE  

00:39:17.082 --> 00:39:20.382
TONIGHT.                        
THE FIRE SERVICE IS ONE OF THE  
PROFESSIONS THAT WAS SLOW TO    

00:39:20.384 --> 00:39:24.320
THE FIRE SERVICE IS ONE OF THE  
PROFESSIONS THAT WAS SLOW TO    
ACCEPT AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT    

00:39:24.322 --> 00:39:27.189
PROFESSIONS THAT WAS SLOW TO    
ACCEPT AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT    
THEY WOULD BE BETTER IF WOMEN   

00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:30.894
ACCEPT AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT    
THEY WOULD BE BETTER IF WOMEN   
WERE ALLOWED TO BE PART OF IT.  

00:39:30.896 --> 00:39:34.630
THEY WOULD BE BETTER IF WOMEN   
WERE ALLOWED TO BE PART OF IT.  
SO THE FIRE STATIONS WERE BUILT 

00:39:34.632 --> 00:39:35.564
WERE ALLOWED TO BE PART OF IT.  
SO THE FIRE STATIONS WERE BUILT 
WITHOUT THE IDEA THAT WOMEN     

00:39:35.566 --> 00:39:38.167
SO THE FIRE STATIONS WERE BUILT 
WITHOUT THE IDEA THAT WOMEN     
WOULD STAY THERE.               

00:39:38.169 --> 00:39:39.035
WITHOUT THE IDEA THAT WOMEN     
WOULD STAY THERE.               
SO WE HAVE POWER STATIONS THAT  

00:39:39.037 --> 00:39:39.736
WOULD STAY THERE.               
SO WE HAVE POWER STATIONS THAT  
DO NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE         

00:39:39.738 --> 00:39:42.338
SO WE HAVE POWER STATIONS THAT  
DO NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE         
QUARTERS FOR FEMALE             

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:42.805
DO NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE         
QUARTERS FOR FEMALE             
FIREFIGHTERS.                   

00:39:42.807 --> 00:39:47.009
QUARTERS FOR FEMALE             
FIREFIGHTERS.                   
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.           

00:39:47.011 --> 00:39:47.943
FIREFIGHTERS.                   
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.           
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO FIX IT     

00:39:47.945 --> 00:39:50.713
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.           
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO FIX IT     
WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW FIREHOUSE  

00:39:50.715 --> 00:39:51.714
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO FIX IT     
WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW FIREHOUSE  
BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN PROGRAM    

00:39:51.716 --> 00:39:55.284
WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW FIREHOUSE  
BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN PROGRAM    
ALL OF THAT IN SO ONE WAY OR    

00:39:55.286 --> 00:39:56.118
BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN PROGRAM    
ALL OF THAT IN SO ONE WAY OR

NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO PROVEN  

00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:38.527
CITY.                           
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO PROVEN  
THAT THAT'S TRUE.               

00:40:38.529 --> 00:40:42.532
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO PROVEN  
THAT THAT'S TRUE.               
WE GET VERY LITTLE INFORMATION  

00:40:42.534 --> 00:40:45.267
THAT THAT'S TRUE.               
WE GET VERY LITTLE INFORMATION  
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT.  

00:40:45.269 --> 00:40:46.201
WE GET VERY LITTLE INFORMATION  
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT.  
WE HAVE EXTENDED THE HOURS SO   

00:40:46.203 --> 00:40:49.372
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT.  
WE HAVE EXTENDED THE HOURS SO   
PEOPLE CAN BUY WHATEVER THEY    

00:40:49.374 --> 00:40:50.472
WE HAVE EXTENDED THE HOURS SO   
PEOPLE CAN BUY WHATEVER THEY    
WANT TO BUY OVER A LONGER       

00:40:50.474 --> 00:40:53.642
PEOPLE CAN BUY WHATEVER THEY    
WANT TO BUY OVER A LONGER       
PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT HAS     

00:40:53.644 --> 00:40:54.476
WANT TO BUY OVER A LONGER       
PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT HAS     
RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF ONE  

00:40:54.478 --> 00:40:57.513
PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT HAS     
RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF ONE  
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND    

00:40:57.515 --> 00:40:57.780
RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF ONE  
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND    
DOLLARS.                        

00:40:57.782 --> 00:41:00.283
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND    
DOLLARS.                        
WE'LL TAKE IT.                  

00:41:00.285 --> 00:41:01.216
DOLLARS.                        
WE'LL TAKE IT.                  
BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE MAJOR       

00:41:01.218 --> 00:41:04.620
WE'LL TAKE IT.                  
BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE MAJOR       
BUDGET DECISIONS ON THAT KIND   

00:41:04.622 --> 00:41:04.954
BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE MAJOR       
BUDGET DECISIONS ON THAT KIND   
OF MONEY.                       

00:41:04.956 --> 00:41:08.190
BUDGET DECISIONS ON THAT KIND   
OF MONEY.                       
SO THAT'S WHY I PUT COINS IN A  

00:41:08.192 --> 00:41:12.294
OF MONEY.                       
SO THAT'S WHY I PUT COINS IN A  
JAR TO ILLUSTRATE THE POINT.    

00:41:12.296 --> 00:41:18.801
SO THAT'S WHY I PUT COINS IN A  
JAR TO ILLUSTRATE THE POINT.    
SO LAST YEAR I WAS REALLY       

00:41:18.803 --> 00:41:22.371

00:42:12.323 --> 00:42:16.526
MEANS A LOT.                    
SO THERE'S MONEY IN THIS BUDGET 
NOT ONE TIME ON GOING TO        

00:42:16.528 --> 00:42:17.393
SO THERE'S MONEY IN THIS BUDGET
