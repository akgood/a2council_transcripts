01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:50.104
THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE  
IS WHAT DO WE DO AT OUR BORDERS

MORE BETWEEN US AND PITTSFIELD  

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:09.590
ALL AGREE TO TO DO A LITTLE BIT 
MORE BETWEEN US AND PITTSFIELD  
IN THE OTHER SURROUNDING        

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:10.057
MORE BETWEEN US AND PITTSFIELD  
IN THE OTHER SURROUNDING        
TOWNSHIPS?                      

01:22:10.059 --> 01:22:13.293
IN THE OTHER SURROUNDING        
TOWNSHIPS?                      
SO AGAIN, I'M LOOKING THE AREA  

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:13.827
TOWNSHIPS?                      
SO AGAIN, I'M LOOKING THE AREA  
NEAR MY HOUSE.                  

01:22:13.829 --> 01:22:14.628
SO AGAIN, I'M LOOKING THE AREA  
NEAR MY HOUSE.                  
I'M THINKING OF THE THE BRIDGE  

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:17.564
NEAR MY HOUSE.                  
I'M THINKING OF THE THE BRIDGE  
THAT GOES OVER NINETY FOUR TO   

01:22:17.566 --> 01:22:18.232
I'M THINKING OF THE THE BRIDGE  
THAT GOES OVER NINETY FOUR TO   
PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP BY THE ICE  

01:22:18.234 --> 01:22:21.768
THAT GOES OVER NINETY FOUR TO   
PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP BY THE ICE  
CUBE AND I GUESS I'D RATHER     

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.438
PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP BY THE ICE  
CUBE AND I GUESS I'D RATHER     
THAT WE HAVE PITTSFIELD AND US  

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.206
CUBE AND I GUESS I'D RATHER     
THAT WE HAVE PITTSFIELD AND US  
PLOWING THAT INSTEAD OF NEITHER 

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:28.942
THAT WE HAVE PITTSFIELD AND US  
PLOWING THAT INSTEAD OF NEITHER 
OF US PLOWING IT.               

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.077
PLOWING THAT INSTEAD OF NEITHER 
OF US PLOWING IT.               
SO IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO  

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:31.878
OF US PLOWING IT.               
SO IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO  
TO LIKE TAKE IT UP A NOTCH AND  

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.013
SO IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO  
TO LIKE TAKE IT UP A NOTCH AND  
GO A LITTLE BIT BEYOND STRICTLY 

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:36.316
TO LIKE TAKE IT UP A NOTCH AND  
GO A LITTLE BIT BEYOND STRICTLY 
WHERE OUR BORDER IS?            

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:37.050
GO A LITTLE BIT BEYOND STRICTLY 
WHERE OUR BORDER IS?            
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING US     

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:40.153
WHERE OUR BORDER IS?            
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING US     
FROM DOING THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE 

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:40.821
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING US     
FROM DOING THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE 
HAVE A DISAGREEMENT OR A        

01:22:40.823 --> 01:22:43.890
FROM DOING THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE 
HAVE A DISAGREEMENT OR A        
MISALIGNMENT IN EXPECTATIONS    

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:44.691
HAVE A DISAGREEMENT OR A        
MISALIGNMENT IN EXPECTATIONS    
AMONG THE MUNICIPALITIES, THEN  

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:47.828
MISALIGNMENT IN EXPECTATIONS    
AMONG THE MUNICIPALITIES, THEN  
OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO    

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:48.429
AMONG THE MUNICIPALITIES, THEN  
OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO    
WALK AND USE THAT               

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:52.299
OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO    
WALK AND USE THAT               
INFRASTRUCTURE SUFFER.          

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:53.266
WALK AND USE THAT

IT'S A RADAR DEVICE THAT        
ACTUALLY PICKS UP AND TRACKS    
THE SPEEDS UP AND THE NUMBER    

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:36.608
ACTUALLY PICKS UP AND TRACKS    
THE SPEEDS UP AND THE NUMBER    
OF VEHICLES.                    

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:39.611
THE SPEEDS UP AND THE NUMBER    
OF VEHICLES.                    
SO ONE YOU CAN TRACK IF THERE'S 

01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:40.412
OF VEHICLES.                    
SO ONE YOU CAN TRACK IF THERE'S 
AN INCREASE IN VEHICLES AS WELL 

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:43.282
SO ONE YOU CAN TRACK IF THERE'S 
AN INCREASE IN VEHICLES AS WELL 
AS THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLES    

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:44.283
AN INCREASE IN VEHICLES AS WELL 
AS THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLES    
AND SO WE CAN KIND OF ONE       

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.585
AS THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLES    
AND SO WE CAN KIND OF ONE       
VALIDATE IF THAT'S ACTUALLY     

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:47.353
AND SO WE CAN KIND OF ONE       
VALIDATE IF THAT'S ACTUALLY     
OCCURRING AND TO SEE IF THERE'S 

01:38:47.355 --> 01:38:50.523
VALIDATE IF THAT'S ACTUALLY     
OCCURRING AND TO SEE IF THERE'S 
INCREASED SPEED AND IF THAT'S   

01:38:50.525 --> 01:38:51.623
OCCURRING AND TO SEE IF THERE'S 
INCREASED SPEED AND IF THAT'S   
THE CASE THEN WE CAN KIND OF DO 

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:58.130
INCREASED SPEED AND IF THAT'S   
THE CASE THEN WE CAN KIND OF DO 
SOME MORE DEPLOYED ENFORCEMENT  

01:38:58.132 --> 01:38:59.164
THE CASE THEN WE CAN KIND OF DO 
SOME MORE DEPLOYED ENFORCEMENT  
AS WELL AS ADD MORE LIKE MAYBE  

01:38:59.166 --> 01:38:59.899
SOME MORE DEPLOYED ENFORCEMENT  
AS WELL AS ADD MORE LIKE MAYBE  
THERE'S ADDITIONAL TRAINING     

01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:02.234
AS WELL AS ADD MORE LIKE MAYBE  
THERE'S ADDITIONAL TRAINING     
LIKE FURNEAUX UP THROUGH        

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:03.068
THERE'S ADDITIONAL TRAINING     
LIKE FURNEAUX UP THROUGH        
TRAFFIC, THAT TYPE OF THING.    

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:06.172
LIKE FURNEAUX UP THROUGH        
TRAFFIC, THAT TYPE OF THING.    
SO THERE'S DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT 

01:39:06.174 --> 01:39:07.272
TRAFFIC, THAT TYPE OF THING.    
SO THERE'S DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT 
WE CAN DEPLOY IF WE'RE SEEING   

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:14.547
SO THERE'S DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT 
WE CAN DEPLOY IF WE'RE SEEING   
TENDENCIES THAT AND THE OTHER   

01:39:14.549 --> 01:39:17.816
WE CAN DEPLOY IF WE'RE SEEING   
TENDENCIES THAT AND THE OTHER

01:43:44.485 --> 01:43:49.522
OF YOUR HEAD, JOHN, WHAT ARE    
DESIGNED TO BE AT THIRTY I I DO 
NOT REMEMBER TWENTY FIVE I      

01:43:49.524 --> 01:43:53.492
DESIGNED TO BE AT THIRTY I I DO 
NOT REMEMBER TWENTY FIVE I      
BELIEVE IT WAS THIRTY BUT I I   

01:43:53.494 --> 01:43:54.159
NOT REMEMBER TWENTY FIVE I      
BELIEVE IT WAS THIRTY BUT I I   
DON'T REMEMBER EITHER.          

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:57.963
BELIEVE IT WAS THIRTY BUT I I   
DON'T REMEMBER EITHER.          
>> WELL WHAT DO I MEAN WHAT IS  

01:43:57.965 --> 01:44:00.499
DON'T REMEMBER EITHER.          
>> WELL WHAT DO I MEAN WHAT IS  
THE SPEED LIMIT NOW IS IT       

01:44:00.501 --> 01:44:01.467
>> WELL WHAT DO I MEAN WHAT IS  
THE SPEED LIMIT NOW IS IT       
THAT'S FUNNY AS JOHN IS LOOKING 

01:44:01.469 --> 01:44:09.274
THE SPEED LIMIT NOW IS IT       
THAT'S FUNNY AS JOHN IS LOOKING 
THAT UP THE THE THE INTENT IS   

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:12.378
THAT'S FUNNY AS JOHN IS LOOKING 
THAT UP THE THE THE INTENT IS   
TO FROM THE DESIGN WAS WAS      

01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:13.145
THAT UP THE THE THE INTENT IS   
TO FROM THE DESIGN WAS WAS      
THROUGH THE USE OF THE          

01:44:13.147 --> 01:44:16.982
TO FROM THE DESIGN WAS WAS      
THROUGH THE USE OF THE          
ROUNDABOUT'S AND THE GEOMETRY   

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:19.951
THROUGH THE USE OF THE          
ROUNDABOUT'S AND THE GEOMETRY   
THAT WE HAVE AND THE WIDTH AND  

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:20.820
ROUNDABOUT'S AND THE GEOMETRY   
THAT WE HAVE AND THE WIDTH AND  
THE USE OF THE PAINT MARKINGS   

01:44:20.822 --> 01:44:24.256
THAT WE HAVE AND THE WIDTH AND  
THE USE OF THE PAINT MARKINGS   
WAS TO HELP SLOW THE VEHICLES   

01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:24.957
THE USE OF THE PAINT MARKINGS   
WAS TO HELP SLOW THE VEHICLES   
ALONG THE CORRIDOR DEFINITELY   

01:44:24.959 --> 01:44:28.527
WAS TO HELP SLOW THE VEHICLES   
ALONG THE CORRIDOR DEFINITELY   
IN COMPARISON TO THE WAY IT     

01:44:28.529 --> 01:44:29.261
ALONG THE CORRIDOR DEFINITELY   
IN COMPARISON TO THE WAY IT     
DOES RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S IT'S A 

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:31.763
IN COMPARISON TO THE WAY IT     
DOES RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S IT'S A 
VERY WIDE OPEN AND STRAIGHT AND 

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:36.001
DOES RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S IT'S A 
VERY WIDE OPEN AND STRAIGHT AND 
AND IN TERMS OF MEASURING THAT  

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:39.772
VERY WIDE OPEN AND STRAIGHT AND 
AND IN TERMS OF MEASURING THAT  
OBVIOUSLY IF WE GET PHONE CALLS 

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:40.639
AND IN TERMS OF MEASURING THAT  
OBVIOUSLY IF WE GET PHONE CALLS 
ABOUT THE SPEED AND THAT'S ONE  

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:42.708
OBVIOUSLY IF WE GET PHONE CALLS 
ABOUT THE SPEED AND THAT'S ONE  
WAY JUST THE REPORTS OF IT.     

01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:44.009
ABOUT THE SPEED AND THAT'S ONE  
WAY JUST THE REPORTS OF IT.     
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS     

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:50.950
WAY JUST THE REPORTS OF IT.     
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS     
SOME SOME FOLLOW UP DISCUSSIONS 

01:44:50.952 --> 01:44:51.750
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS     
SOME SOME FOLLOW UP DISCUSSIONS 
ABOUT MAYBE DOING SOME VOLUMES  

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:55.187
SOME SOME FOLLOW UP DISCUSSIONS 
ABOUT MAYBE DOING SOME VOLUMES  
AND SPEED DATA GATHERING AT     

01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:58.791
ABOUT MAYBE DOING SOME VOLUMES  
AND SPEED DATA GATHERING AT     
DIFFERENT POINTS.               

01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:00.058
AND SPEED DATA GATHERING AT     
DIFFERENT POINTS.               
>> YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO I      

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.860
DIFFERENT POINTS.               
>> YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO I      
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:02.794
>> YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO I      
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON   

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:06.465
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON   
THAT DESIGN SPEED AND WE ARE    

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:07.133
ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON   
THAT DESIGN SPEED AND WE ARE    
ABLE TO REALIZE THE THE         

01:45:07.135 --> 01:45:10.970
THAT DESIGN SPEED AND WE ARE    
ABLE TO REALIZE THE THE         
IMPROVEMENTS AND SPEED.         

01:45:10.972 --> 01:45:12.204
ABLE TO REALIZE THE THE         
IMPROVEMENTS AND SPEED.         
SO IF WE CAN PROGRAM IN AND     

01:45:12.206 --> 01:45:14.506
IMPROVEMENTS AND SPEED.         
SO IF WE CAN PROGRAM IN AND     
PLAN FOR SOME FOLLOW UP         

01:45:14.508 --> 01:45:17.676
SO IF WE CAN PROGRAM IN AND     
PLAN FOR SOME FOLLOW UP         
MEASUREMENTS, I THINK THAT WE   

01:45:17.678 --> 01:45:18.677
PLAN FOR SOME FOLLOW UP         
MEASUREMENTS, I THINK THAT WE   
THAT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO    

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:19.478
MEASUREMENTS, I THINK THAT WE   
THAT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO    
KNOW THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT    

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.547
THAT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO    
KNOW THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT    
TRACK THAT OR THAT WE NEED TO   

01:45:22.549 --> 01:45:22.815
KNOW THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT    
TRACK THAT OR THAT WE NEED TO   
DO MORE.                        

01:45:22.817 --> 01:45:26.084
TRACK THAT OR THAT WE NEED TO   
DO MORE.                        
SO ARE THE OTHER THE DESIGN     

01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:27.085
DO MORE.                        
SO ARE THE OTHER THE DESIGN     
SPEED IS 35 MILES AN HOUR AND   

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:29.588
SO ARE THE OTHER THE DESIGN     
SPEED IS 35 MILES AN HOUR AND   
THEN POST SPEED WILL BE THIRTY  

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:33.191
SPEED IS 35 MILES AN HOUR AND   
THEN POST SPEED WILL BE THIRTY  
MILES AN HOUR AND AND GOING     

01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:36.728
THEN POST SPEED WILL BE THIRTY  
MILES AN HOUR AND AND GOING     
THROUGH THE ROUNDABOUTS PEOPLE  

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:37.429
MILES AN HOUR AND AND GOING     
THROUGH THE ROUNDABOUTS PEOPLE  
TYPICALLY ARE SLOWING DOWN      

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:37.829
THROUGH THE ROUNDABOUTS PEOPLE  
TYPICALLY ARE SLOWING DOWN      
BELOW THAT.                     

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:40.032
TYPICALLY ARE SLOWING DOWN      
BELOW THAT.                     
SO BETWEEN THAT AND THE RAISED  

01:45:40.034 --> 01:45:40.766
BELOW THAT.                     
SO BETWEEN THAT AND THE RAISED  
CROSSWALKS THAT WILL THAT WILL  

01:45:40.768 --> 01:45:44.002
SO BETWEEN THAT AND THE RAISED  
CROSSWALKS THAT WILL THAT WILL  
HELP THAT PROCESS.              

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:45.303
CROSSWALKS THAT WILL THAT WILL  
HELP THAT PROCESS.              
>> LIKE CHRIS SAID, I THINK WE  

01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:48.407
HELP THAT PROCESS.              
>> LIKE CHRIS SAID, I THINK WE  
WOULD AGREE THAT UNTIL THIS IS  

01:45:48.409 --> 01:45:49.341
>> LIKE CHRIS SAID, I THINK WE  
WOULD AGREE THAT UNTIL THIS IS  
IN PLACE, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T   

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:52.811
WOULD AGREE THAT UNTIL THIS IS  
IN PLACE, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T   
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET.  

01:45:52.813 --> 01:45:56.281
IN PLACE, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T   
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET.  
>> OK, SO IS THAT NORMAL FOR    

01:45:56.283 --> 01:45:57.016
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET.  
>> OK, SO IS THAT NORMAL FOR    
THE DESIGN SPEED TO BE HIGHER   

01:45:57.018 --> 01:45:57.716
>> OK, SO IS THAT NORMAL FOR    
THE DESIGN SPEED TO BE HIGHER   
THAN THE POSTED SPEED?          

01:45:57.718 --> 01:46:00.051
THE DESIGN SPEED TO BE HIGHER   
THAN THE POSTED SPEED?          
>> YEAH, YES.                   

01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:00.986
THAN THE POSTED SPEED?          
>> YEAH, YES.                   
THAT'S FOR SAFETY REASONS       

01:46:00.988 --> 01:46:04.756
>> YEAH, YES.                   
THAT'S FOR SAFETY REASONS       
SIMILAR TO WHERE LIKE ON A      

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:05.424
THAT'S FOR SAFETY REASONS       
SIMILAR TO WHERE LIKE ON A      
FREEWAY YOU'LL HAVE A CURVE     

01:46:05.426 --> 01:46:07.760
SIMILAR TO WHERE LIKE ON A      
FREEWAY YOU'LL HAVE A CURVE     
WHERE THE DESIGN SPEED MAYBE 75 

01:46:07.762 --> 01:46:11.330
FREEWAY YOU'LL HAVE A CURVE     
WHERE THE DESIGN SPEED MAYBE 75 
MILES AN HOUR BUT POSTED SPEED  

01:46:11.332 --> 01:46:15.233
WHERE THE DESIGN SPEED MAYBE 75 
MILES AN HOUR BUT POSTED SPEED  
OF 65 OR 60 IT'S JUST SAFETY    

01:46:15.235 --> 01:46:15.534
MILES AN HOUR BUT POSTED SPEED  
OF 65 OR 60 IT'S JUST SAFETY    
FACTOR.                         

01:46:15.536 --> 01:46:18.136
OF 65 OR 60 IT'S JUST SAFETY    
FACTOR.                         
>> WELL I GUESS I'D LIKE TO     

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:21.973
FACTOR.                         
>> WELL I GUESS I'D LIKE TO     
ENCOURAGE DESIGN FEATURES THAT  

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:22.975
>> WELL I GUESS I'D LIKE TO     
ENCOURAGE DESIGN FEATURES THAT  
THAT SLOW TRAFFIC DOWN SLOWER   

01:46:22.977 --> 01:46:26.779
ENCOURAGE DESIGN FEATURES THAT  
THAT SLOW TRAFFIC DOWN SLOWER   
THAN THIRTY FIVE MINUTES WOULD  

01:46:26.781 --> 01:46:29.882
THAT SLOW TRAFFIC DOWN SLOWER   
THAN THIRTY FIVE MINUTES WOULD  
BE MY PREFERENCE LIKE LIKE      

01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:30.683
THAN THIRTY FIVE MINUTES WOULD  
BE MY PREFERENCE LIKE LIKE      
LET'S HAVE NARROW LANES AND     

01:46:30.685 --> 01:46:34.153
BE MY PREFERENCE LIKE LIKE      
LET'S HAVE NARROW LANES AND     
VERTICAL ELEMENTS THAT MAKE     

01:46:34.155 --> 01:46:34.953
LET'S HAVE NARROW LANES AND     
VERTICAL ELEMENTS THAT MAKE     
PEOPLE WANT TO DRIVE SLOWER     

01:46:34.955 --> 01:46:37.589
VERTICAL ELEMENTS THAT MAKE     
PEOPLE WANT TO DRIVE SLOWER     
THAN THE SPEED.                 

01:46:37.591 --> 01:46:38.490
PEOPLE WANT TO DRIVE SLOWER     
THAN THE SPEED.                 
THAT'S THE WAY THAT I THINK.    

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:45.297
THAN THE SPEED.                 
THAT'S THE WAY THAT I THINK.    
WELL GET TO OUR VISION ZERO     

01:46:45.299 --> 01:46:51.436
THAT'S THE WAY THAT I THINK.    
WELL GET TO OUR VISION ZERO     
GOALS SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO    

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:52.404
WELL GET TO OUR VISION ZERO     
GOALS SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO    
CONSIDER THAT AND LIKE I SAID   

01:46:52.406 --> 01:46:55.440
GOALS SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO    
CONSIDER THAT AND LIKE I SAID   
MEASURE IT WHEN WE'RE DONE.

OF START IMPLEMENTING THIS      
NEXEN PROJECT ALL OF A SUDDEN   
THERE ARE THESE OTHER FACTORS,  

01:48:53.994 --> 01:48:54.727
NEXEN PROJECT ALL OF A SUDDEN   
THERE ARE THESE OTHER FACTORS,  
THESE OTHER PROJECTS THAT CAME  

01:48:54.729 --> 01:48:55.594
THERE ARE THESE OTHER FACTORS,  
THESE OTHER PROJECTS THAT CAME  
ONLINE, THE SCHOOLS WERE MOVING 

01:48:55.596 --> 01:48:55.927
THESE OTHER PROJECTS THAT CAME  
ONLINE, THE SCHOOLS WERE MOVING 
RIGHT.                          

01:48:55.929 --> 01:48:56.662
ONLINE, THE SCHOOLS WERE MOVING 
RIGHT.                          
AND SO ALL OF SUDDEN THESE      

01:48:56.664 --> 01:48:57.395
RIGHT.                          
AND SO ALL OF SUDDEN THESE      
THINGS WEREN'T AS BIG OF AN     

01:48:57.397 --> 01:48:58.030
AND SO ALL OF SUDDEN THESE      
THINGS WEREN'T AS BIG OF AN     
ISSUE IN TWENTY NINETEEN.       

01:48:58.032 --> 01:48:58.997
THINGS WEREN'T AS BIG OF AN     
ISSUE IN TWENTY NINETEEN.       
NOW THEY'RE A BIG ISSUE AND SO  

01:48:58.999 --> 01:48:59.632
ISSUE IN TWENTY NINETEEN.       
NOW THEY'RE A BIG ISSUE AND SO  
WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE     

01:48:59.634 --> 01:49:02.200
NOW THEY'RE A BIG ISSUE AND SO  
WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE     
THOSE TWEAKS, THOSE CHANGES NOW 

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:06.171
WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE     
THOSE TWEAKS, THOSE CHANGES NOW 
SO AGREED I THINK IT WAS A      

01:49:06.173 --> 01:49:06.872
THOSE TWEAKS, THOSE CHANGES NOW 
SO AGREED I THINK IT WAS A      
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE     

01:49:06.874 --> 01:49:09.307
SO AGREED I THINK IT WAS A      
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE     
THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND          

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:10.041
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE     
THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND          
COORDINATE THAT WITH THE        

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:13.278
THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND          
COORDINATE THAT WITH THE        
SCHOOLS IMPROVEMENTS IN         

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:17.782
COORDINATE THAT WITH THE        
SCHOOLS IMPROVEMENTS IN         
PARTICULAR I THINK IT WAS PHASE 

01:49:17.784 --> 01:49:18.583
SCHOOLS IMPROVEMENTS IN         
PARTICULAR I THINK IT WAS PHASE 
THREE IT WAS THERE THAT BLOCK   

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:21.052
PARTICULAR I THINK IT WAS PHASE 
THREE IT WAS THERE THAT BLOCK   
CROSSWALK.                      

01:49:21.054 --> 01:49:24.256
THREE IT WAS THERE THAT BLOCK   
CROSSWALK.                      
YES, RIGHT HERE.                

01:49:24.258 --> 01:49:28.494
CROSSWALK.                      
YES, RIGHT HERE.                
SO WOULD THAT HAVE RFP OR SOME  

01:49:28.496 --> 01:49:29.161
YES, RIGHT HERE.                
SO WOULD THAT HAVE RFP OR SOME  
KIND OF FLASHING LIGHTS OR      

01:49:29.163 --> 01:49:32.764
SO WOULD THAT HAVE RFP OR SOME  
KIND OF FLASHING LIGHTS OR      
SOMETHING ON IT ON THIS ONE I   

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:35.968
KIND OF FLASHING LIGHTS OR      
SOMETHING ON IT ON THIS ONE I   
DON'T BELIEVE ROSE TO THAT      

01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:36.301
SOMETHING ON IT ON THIS ONE I   
DON'T BELIEVE ROSE TO THAT      
LEVEL.                          

01:49:36.303 --> 01:49:39.904
DON'T BELIEVE ROSE TO THAT      
LEVEL.                          
SO I THINK IT HAS THE MARKINGS  

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:44.175
LEVEL.                          
SO I THINK IT HAS THE MARKINGS  
AND THE SCIENCE ON THIS ONE.    

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:45.244
SO I THINK IT HAS THE MARKINGS  
AND THE SCIENCE ON THIS ONE.    
>> I JUST I MAYBE ERIC KNOWS    

01:49:45.246 --> 01:49:48.079
AND THE SCIENCE ON THIS ONE.    
>> I JUST I MAYBE ERIC KNOWS    
THE AREA BETTER BUT DO YOU      

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:48.780
>> I JUST I MAYBE ERIC KNOWS    
THE AREA BETTER BUT DO YOU      
ANTICIPATE THAT BEING USED FOR  

01:49:48.782 --> 01:49:51.784
THE AREA BETTER BUT DO YOU      
ANTICIPATE THAT BEING USED FOR  
KIDS WALKING TO THE NEW LOGAN   

01:49:51.786 --> 01:49:55.254
ANTICIPATE THAT BEING USED FOR  
KIDS WALKING TO THE NEW LOGAN   
OR KLEGG?                       

01:49:55.256 --> 01:49:56.054
KIDS WALKING TO THE NEW LOGAN   
OR KLEGG?                       
I DON'T THINK SO.               

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:57.088
OR KLEGG?                       
I DON'T THINK SO.               
I THINK MOST OF THE KIDS ARE    

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:57.823
I DON'T THINK SO.               
I THINK MOST OF THE KIDS ARE    
GOING TO CROSS AT THAT          

01:49:57.825 --> 01:49:59.825
I THINK MOST OF THE KIDS ARE    
GOING TO CROSS AT THAT          
ROUNDABOUT THAT'S TO THE SOUTH  

01:49:59.827 --> 01:50:00.492
GOING TO CROSS AT THAT          
ROUNDABOUT THAT'S TO THE SOUTH  
OF THIS ONE THING THAT          

01:50:00.494 --> 01:50:02.561
ROUNDABOUT THAT'S TO THE SOUTH  
OF THIS ONE THING THAT          
NEIGHBORS HAVE EXPRESSED A      

01:50:02.563 --> 01:50:03.428
OF THIS ONE THING THAT          
NEIGHBORS HAVE EXPRESSED A      
LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN ABOUT AT  

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:06.331
NEIGHBORS HAVE EXPRESSED A      
LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN ABOUT AT  
THIS MID BLOCK CROSSWALK IS     

01:50:06.333 --> 01:50:07.532
LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN ABOUT AT  
THIS MID BLOCK CROSSWALK IS     
THAT IT'S UPHILL TO THE LEFT IS 

01:50:07.534 --> 01:50:11.069
THIS MID BLOCK CROSSWALK IS     
THAT IT'S UPHILL TO THE LEFT IS 
DOWNHILL TO THE RIGHT IS UPHILL 

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:11.804
THAT IT'S UPHILL TO THE LEFT IS 
DOWNHILL TO THE RIGHT IS UPHILL 
AND SO SOME PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE 

01:50:11.806 --> 01:50:14.539
DOWNHILL TO THE RIGHT IS UPHILL 
AND SO SOME PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE 
BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS        

01:50:14.541 --> 01:50:15.274
AND SO SOME PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE 
BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS        
CROSSWALK WITH LIMITED SIGHT    

01:50:15.276 --> 01:50:18.243
BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS        
CROSSWALK WITH LIMITED SIGHT    
LINES BECAUSE THERE'S RATHER    

01:50:18.245 --> 01:50:19.344
CROSSWALK WITH LIMITED SIGHT    
LINES BECAUSE THERE'S RATHER    
LARGE TREES ON THE EAST AND     

01:50:19.346 --> 01:50:22.514
LINES BECAUSE THERE'S RATHER    
LARGE TREES ON THE EAST AND     
WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD.         

01:50:22.516 --> 01:50:23.716
LARGE TREES ON THE EAST AND     
WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD.         
SO IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE  

01:50:23.718 --> 01:50:24.650
WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD.         
SO IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE  
HAVE TO REEVALUATE DOWN THE     

01:50:24.652 --> 01:50:28.487
SO IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE  
HAVE TO REEVALUATE DOWN THE     
ROAD.                           

01:50:28.489 --> 01:50:29.555
HAVE TO REEVALUATE DOWN THE     
ROAD.                           
YEAH, I THINK THIS IF I         

01:50:29.557 --> 01:50:32.657
ROAD.                           
YEAH, I THINK THIS IF I         
REMEMBER ORIGINALLY THIS WAS AN 

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:33.358
YEAH, I THINK THIS IF I         
REMEMBER ORIGINALLY THIS WAS AN 
AREA WHERE THERE WAS GOING TO   

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.494
REMEMBER ORIGINALLY THIS WAS AN 
AREA WHERE THERE WAS GOING TO   
BE ANOTHER ROUND ABOUT WHAT     

01:50:35.496 --> 01:50:36.228
AREA WHERE THERE WAS GOING TO   
BE ANOTHER ROUND ABOUT WHAT     
PUBLIC OPINION WAS PRETTY       

01:50:36.230 --> 01:50:36.729
BE ANOTHER ROUND ABOUT WHAT     
PUBLIC OPINION WAS PRETTY       
NEGATIVE ON THAT.               

01:50:36.731 --> 01:50:39.965
PUBLIC OPINION WAS PRETTY       
NEGATIVE ON THAT.               
SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY TOOK 

01:50:39.967 --> 01:50:40.565
NEGATIVE ON THAT.               
SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY TOOK 
THE FOURTH AND FIFTH            

01:50:40.567 --> 01:50:43.535
SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY TOOK 
THE FOURTH AND FIFTH            
ROUNDABOUTS AWAY.               

01:50:43.537 --> 01:50:44.102
THE FOURTH AND FIFTH            
ROUNDABOUTS AWAY.               
THAT'S CORRECT.                 

01:50:44.104 --> 01:50:51.242
ROUNDABOUTS AWAY.               
THAT'S CORRECT.                 
THERE IS BY HAVING THE BIKE     

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:52.244
THAT'S CORRECT.                 
THERE IS BY HAVING THE BIKE     
LANES AT ARGONNE YOU ARE ABLE   

01:50:52.246 --> 01:50:55.313
THERE IS BY HAVING THE BIKE     
LANES AT ARGONNE YOU ARE ABLE   
TO KIND OF PULL OUT A LITTLE    

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:56.048
LANES AT ARGONNE YOU ARE ABLE   
TO KIND OF PULL OUT A LITTLE    
BIT AND HAVE IMPROVED           

01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:58.316
TO KIND OF PULL OUT A LITTLE    
BIT AND HAVE IMPROVED           
SIGHTLINES AND THEN WITH THE    

01:50:58.318 --> 01:51:05.623
BIT AND HAVE IMPROVED           
SIGHTLINES AND THEN WITH THE    
IMPROVED VERTICAL PROFILE ON    

01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:06.491
SIGHTLINES AND THEN WITH THE    
IMPROVED VERTICAL PROFILE ON    
THAT ROAD AS YOU GO FROM        

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:09.795
IMPROVED VERTICAL PROFILE ON    
THAT ROAD AS YOU GO FROM        
ARGONNE TO THE NORTH WE'RE ABLE 

01:51:09.797 --> 01:51:10.395
THAT ROAD AS YOU GO FROM        
ARGONNE TO THE NORTH WE'RE ABLE 
TO IMPROVE THE SIGHT LINE       

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:13.898
ARGONNE TO THE NORTH WE'RE ABLE 
TO IMPROVE THE SIGHT LINE       
VERTICAL SIGHT LINE ON THAT     

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:14.199
TO IMPROVE THE SIGHT LINE       
VERTICAL SIGHT LINE ON THAT     
TOO.                            

01:51:14.201 --> 01:51:17.302
VERTICAL SIGHT LINE ON THAT     
TOO.                            
>> SO THERE ARE JUST LITTLE     

01:51:17.304 --> 01:51:18.103
TOO.                            
>> SO THERE ARE JUST LITTLE     
TWEAKS HERE AND THERE THAT      

01:51:18.105 --> 01:51:18.837
>> SO THERE ARE JUST LITTLE     
TWEAKS HERE AND THERE THAT      
SHOULD IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND   

01:51:18.839 --> 01:51:22.040
TWEAKS HERE AND THERE THAT      
SHOULD IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND   
THE LINES WITHOUT CUTTING DOWN  

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:22.641
SHOULD IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND   
THE LINES WITHOUT CUTTING DOWN  
THE TREES IN THAT AREA.         

01:51:22.643 --> 01:51:24.843
