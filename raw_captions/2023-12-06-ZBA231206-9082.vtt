INVASIVE TO THE PROPERTY AS IT  
COULD MEAN LIKE WE DIDN&apos;T WANT  

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:27.856
INVASIVE TO THE PROPERTY AS IT  
COULD MEAN LIKE WE DIDN&apos;T WANT  
TO CUT DOWN ALL OF REALLY OLD   

00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:30.625
COULD MEAN LIKE WE DIDN&apos;T WANT  
TO CUT DOWN ALL OF REALLY OLD   
TREES AND IN ADDITION THE THE   

00:09:30.627 --> 00:09:34.328

SO WHEN WHEN WE APPROACHED THIS 
WE LOOKED AT MAKING A GARAGE    

00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:30.752
SO WHEN WHEN WE APPROACHED THIS 
WE LOOKED AT MAKING A GARAGE    
THAT RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY NO CAR

00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:35.923
OTHER THAN KIND OF A SMART CAR  
CAN FIT INTO IT TO SHALLOW      
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT BEFORE    

00:10:35.925 --> 00:10:39.761

BECAUSE AT SOME POINT BEFORE    
THEY BOUGHT A HOUSE PART OF THE

BECAUSE WE PUT THE GARAGE ON    

00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:47.128

BECAUSE WE PUT THE GARAGE ON

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.896
BECAUSE WE PUT THE GARAGE ON    
THE OTHER SIDE THEN WE&apos;RE ALSO  
HAVING TO CHANGE THE PASSAGE    

00:11:47.898 --> 00:11:48.563
THE OTHER SIDE THEN WE&apos;RE ALSO  
HAVING TO CHANGE THE PASSAGE    
FROM THE GARAGE THROUGH AND     

00:11:48.565 --> 00:11:51.332
HAVING TO CHANGE THE PASSAGE

SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE&apos;RE JUST ASKING 

00:11:59.142 --> 00:12:00.174
HOUSE MADE THE MOST SENSE.      
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE&apos;RE JUST ASKING 
THAT THE PROPERTY ALSO KIND     

00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:03.511
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE&apos;RE JUST ASKING 
THAT THE PROPERTY ALSO KIND     
OF ON A PENINSULA WHERE IT&apos;S    

00:12:03.513 --> 00:12:04.178
THAT THE PROPERTY ALSO KIND     
OF ON A PENINSULA WHERE IT&apos;S    
GOT THREE ROADS ESSENTIALLY     

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.947
OF ON A PENINSULA WHERE IT&apos;S    
GOT THREE ROADS ESSENTIALLY     
IT&apos;S LIKE TWO PUBLIC ROADS      

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:07.915
GOT THREE ROADS ESSENTIALLY     
IT&apos;S LIKE TWO PUBLIC ROADS      
PRIVATE BY RIGHT AWAY THAT      

00:12:07.917 --> 00:12:11.619
IT&apos;S LIKE TWO PUBLIC ROADS      
PRIVATE BY RIGHT AWAY THAT      
SURROUNDED AND SO CONTEXTUALLY  

00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:15.189
PRIVATE BY RIGHT AWAY THAT      
SURROUNDED AND SO CONTEXTUALLY  
IT&apos;S IT IS KIND OF ISOLATED AND 

00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:15.824
SURROUNDED AND SO CONTEXTUALLY  
IT&apos;S IT IS KIND OF ISOLATED AND 
SEPARATED FROM THE NEIGHBORS    

00:12:15.826 --> 00:12:19.761
IT&apos;S IT IS KIND OF ISOLATED AND 
SEPARATED FROM THE NEIGHBORS    
THERE WILL STILL BE THIRTY FEET 

00:12:19.763 --> 00:12:20.261
SEPARATED FROM THE NEIGHBORS    
THERE WILL STILL BE THIRTY FEET 
FROM THE ROAD.                  

00:12:20.263 --> 00:12:22.463
THERE WILL STILL BE THIRTY FEET 
FROM THE ROAD.                  
SO THERE&apos;S A KIND OF GENEROUS   

00:12:22.465 --> 00:12:26.333
FROM THE ROAD.                  
SO THERE&apos;S A KIND OF GENEROUS   
SET BACK FROM FROM THE ROAD AND 

00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:26.868
SO THERE&apos;S A KIND OF GENEROUS   
SET BACK FROM FROM THE ROAD AND 
THE PROPERTY LINE.              

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:27.735
SET BACK FROM FROM THE ROAD AND 
THE PROPERTY LINE.              
IT&apos;S ALREADY INSIDE OF THAT.    

00:12:27.737 --> 00:12:30.204
THE PROPERTY LINE.              
IT&apos;S ALREADY INSIDE OF THAT.

IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WOULD STILL 

00:30:43.432 --> 00:30:43.963

IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WOULD STILL 
NEED A VARIANCE.                

00:30:43.965 --> 00:30:47.100
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WOULD STILL 
NEED A VARIANCE.                
IS THAT WHAT I THOUGHT I HEARD

NEED A VARIANCE.                
IS THAT WHAT I THOUGHT I HEARD  
THAT?                           

00:30:47.302 --> 00:30:48.101
IS THAT WHAT I THOUGHT I HEARD  
THAT?

THAT?                           
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO, YEAH.            
BUT IT WOULD BE A SMALLER       

00:30:50.038 --> 00:30:50.970
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO, YEAH.            
BUT IT WOULD BE A SMALLER       
SMALLER BUT JUST WHAT WAS THE   

00:30:50.972 --> 00:30:53.439
BUT IT WOULD BE A SMALLER       
SMALLER BUT JUST WHAT WAS THE   
WAS THAT STUDIED?               

00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:54.207
SMALLER BUT JUST WHAT WAS THE   
WAS THAT STUDIED?               
&gt;&gt; CAN I ASK THEM?              

00:30:54.209 --> 00:30:57.543

OH YEAH.                        
WAS IT STUDIED JUST TO PROVIDE  

00:30:58.613 --> 00:31:01.814
OH YEAH.                        
WAS IT STUDIED JUST TO PROVIDE  
A SINGLE CAR WITH AMPLE ROOM    

00:31:01.816 --> 00:31:05.185
WAS IT STUDIED JUST TO PROVIDE  
A SINGLE CAR WITH AMPLE ROOM    
FOR I MEAN WE LOOK WE LOOKED AT 

00:31:05.187 --> 00:31:06.185
A SINGLE CAR WITH AMPLE ROOM    
FOR I MEAN WE LOOK WE LOOKED AT 
AND YOU KNOW IT&apos;S IT&apos;S MAINLY   

00:31:06.187 --> 00:31:09.622
FOR I MEAN WE LOOK WE LOOKED AT 
AND YOU KNOW IT&apos;S IT&apos;S MAINLY   
THE LENGTH FROM THE BACK OF THE 

00:31:09.624 --> 00:31:10.357
AND YOU KNOW IT&apos;S IT&apos;S MAINLY   
THE LENGTH FROM THE BACK OF THE 
GARAGE THAT&apos;S PROBLEMATIC NOW   

00:31:10.359 --> 00:31:13.160
THE LENGTH FROM THE BACK OF THE 
GARAGE THAT&apos;S PROBLEMATIC NOW   
YOU CAN&apos;T PARK IT IS A LITTLE   

00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:16.963
GARAGE THAT&apos;S PROBLEMATIC NOW   
YOU CAN&apos;T PARK IT IS A LITTLE   
BIT NARROW BUT IT&apos;S MAINLY THE  

00:31:16.965 --> 00:31:20.266
YOU CAN&apos;T PARK IT IS A LITTLE   
BIT NARROW BUT IT&apos;S MAINLY THE  
LIKE FRONT TO BACK SO IT WOULD  

00:31:20.268 --> 00:31:24.303
BIT NARROW BUT IT&apos;S MAINLY THE  
LIKE FRONT TO BACK SO IT WOULD  
BASICALLY BE YOU KNOW KEEPING I 

00:31:24.305 --> 00:31:25.272
LIKE FRONT TO BACK SO IT WOULD  
BASICALLY BE YOU KNOW KEEPING I 
THINK AT THE VERY MINIMUM WE    

00:31:25.274 --> 00:31:26.072
BASICALLY BE YOU KNOW KEEPING I 
THINK AT THE VERY MINIMUM WE    
CAN TRY AND KIND OF PULL THE    

00:31:26.074 --> 00:31:27.907
THINK AT THE VERY MINIMUM WE    
CAN TRY AND KIND OF PULL THE    
GARAGE FORWARD WHICH IS KIND    

00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:31.577
CAN TRY AND KIND OF PULL THE    
GARAGE FORWARD WHICH IS KIND    
OF KEEPS THE LINE BUT           

00:31:31.579 --> 00:31:32.245
GARAGE FORWARD WHICH IS KIND    
OF KEEPS THE LINE BUT           
ESSENTIALLY IS NO FURTHER       

00:31:32.247 --> 00:31:32.712
OF KEEPS THE LINE BUT           
ESSENTIALLY IS NO FURTHER       
ENCROACHMENT.                   

00:31:32.714 --> 00:31:35.982
ESSENTIALLY IS NO FURTHER       
ENCROACHMENT.                   
I MEAN IF WE CAN USE THE THE    

00:31:35.984 --> 00:31:39.286
ENCROACHMENT.                   
I MEAN IF WE CAN USE THE THE    
THE LINE OF THE EXISTING GARAGE 

00:31:39.288 --> 00:31:40.353
I MEAN IF WE CAN USE THE THE    
THE LINE OF THE EXISTING GARAGE 
YOU KNOW, PART OF THE THING     

00:31:40.355 --> 00:31:43.823
THE LINE OF THE EXISTING GARAGE 
YOU KNOW, PART OF THE THING     
THAT WE THAT WE HAD IN THIS AS  

00:31:43.825 --> 00:31:44.557
YOU KNOW, PART OF THE THING     
THAT WE THAT WE HAD IN THIS AS  
WELL IF WE WERE IF WE WERE      

00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:47.560
THAT WE THAT WE HAD IN THIS AS  
WELL IF WE WERE IF WE WERE      
GOING TO HAVE A NEW WALL.       

00:31:47.562 --> 00:31:47.960
WELL IF WE WERE IF WE WERE      
GOING TO HAVE A NEW WALL.       
RIGHT.                          

00:31:47.962 --> 00:31:49.028
GOING TO HAVE A NEW WALL.       
RIGHT.                          
IT&apos;S KIND OF TO EXTEND IT BACK  

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:49.796
RIGHT.                          
IT&apos;S KIND OF TO EXTEND IT BACK  
FURTHER WHERE THAT KIND OF CUT  

00:31:49.798 --> 00:31:52.498
IT&apos;S KIND OF TO EXTEND IT BACK  
FURTHER WHERE THAT KIND OF CUT  
OUT IS IN THE BACK SO THAT THE  

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.634
FURTHER WHERE THAT KIND OF CUT  
OUT IS IN THE BACK SO THAT THE  
KIND OF HOUSE MEETS THAT LINE   

00:31:54.636 --> 00:31:55.701
OUT IS IN THE BACK SO THAT THE  
KIND OF HOUSE MEETS THAT LINE   
THE GARAGE IF WE WERE TO DO     

00:31:55.703 --> 00:31:59.106
KIND OF HOUSE MEETS THAT LINE   
THE GARAGE IF WE WERE TO DO     
THAT SAME THING ON THE ONE CAR  

00:31:59.108 --> 00:32:00.306
THE GARAGE IF WE WERE TO DO     
THAT SAME THING ON THE ONE CAR  
JUST BASED ON THE ANGLE OF THE  

00:32:00.308 --> 00:32:03.843
THAT SAME THING ON THE ONE CAR  
JUST BASED ON THE ANGLE OF THE  
HOUSE AS IT ANGLE TO THE SET    

00:32:03.845 --> 00:32:04.710
JUST BASED ON THE ANGLE OF THE  
HOUSE AS IT ANGLE TO THE SET    
BACK, THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE   

00:32:04.712 --> 00:32:06.913
HOUSE AS IT ANGLE TO THE SET    
BACK, THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE   
BIT FURTHER ENCROACHMENT EVEN   

00:32:06.915 --> 00:32:07.847
BACK, THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE   
BIT FURTHER ENCROACHMENT EVEN   
THOUGH WE KEPT THE SAME LINE    

00:32:07.849 --> 00:32:10.483
BIT FURTHER ENCROACHMENT EVEN   
THOUGH WE KEPT THE SAME LINE    
OF WALL RIGHT.                  

00:32:10.485 --> 00:32:11.551
THOUGH WE KEPT THE SAME LINE    
OF WALL RIGHT.                  
SO WE WE LOOKED AT THOSE        

00:32:11.553 --> 00:32:11.952
OF WALL RIGHT.                  
SO WE WE LOOKED AT THOSE        
OPTIONS.                        

00:32:11.954 --> 00:32:14.454
SO WE WE LOOKED AT THOSE        
OPTIONS.                        
BUT I THINK WHAT ENDED UP       

00:32:14.456 --> 00:32:15.488
OPTIONS.                        
BUT I THINK WHAT ENDED UP       
HAPPENING FOR US TO BE HONEST   

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:19.225
BUT I THINK WHAT ENDED UP       
HAPPENING FOR US TO BE HONEST   
WAS THAT IT&apos;S STILL GOING TO BE 

00:32:19.227 --> 00:32:19.860
HAPPENING FOR US TO BE HONEST   
WAS THAT IT&apos;S STILL GOING TO BE 
THIRTY FEET FROM THIRTY ONE     

00:32:19.862 --> 00:32:20.660
WAS THAT IT&apos;S STILL GOING TO BE 
THIRTY FEET FROM THIRTY ONE     
FEET FROM THE ROAD IS WHAT WE   

00:32:20.662 --> 00:32:22.929
THIRTY FEET FROM THIRTY ONE     
FEET FROM THE ROAD IS WHAT WE   
THOUGHT AND WE THOUGHT THAT     

00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:26.566
FEET FROM THE ROAD IS WHAT WE   
THOUGHT AND WE THOUGHT THAT     
THEN YOU KNOW, IN ORDER TO GET  

00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:27.467

WHAT YOU&apos;RE SAYING THAT MEANS   
IT&apos;S A LUXURY TO HAVE IT.       
&gt;&gt; BUT IT&apos;S ALSO NOT UNCOMMON   

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:31.905
IT&apos;S A LUXURY TO HAVE IT.       
&gt;&gt; BUT IT&apos;S ALSO NOT UNCOMMON   
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TO HAVE    

00:32:31.907 --> 00:32:34.374

THE LOT AT APPROXIMATE ONE      
HUNDRED AND EIGHT FEET AND IF

THE LOT AT APPROXIMATE ONE      
HUNDRED AND EIGHT FEET AND IF   
YOU LOOK AT THE SITE PLAN       

00:33:12.814 --> 00:33:15.282
HUNDRED AND EIGHT FEET AND IF   
YOU LOOK AT THE SITE PLAN       
PROPOSED I THINK IT&apos;S ACTUALLY  

00:33:15.284 --> 00:33:15.882
YOU LOOK AT THE SITE PLAN       
PROPOSED I THINK IT&apos;S ACTUALLY  
DONE WRONG BECAUSE THEY HAVE A  

00:33:15.884 --> 00:33:19.986
PROPOSED I THINK IT&apos;S ACTUALLY  
DONE WRONG BECAUSE THEY HAVE A  
FIVE FOOT SETBACK ON WHAT IS I  

00:33:19.988 --> 00:33:20.653
DONE WRONG BECAUSE THEY HAVE A  
FIVE FOOT SETBACK ON WHAT IS I  
CONSIDER THE REAR PROPERTY      

00:33:20.655 --> 00:33:20.987
FIVE FOOT SETBACK ON WHAT IS I  
CONSIDER THE REAR PROPERTY      
LINE.                           

00:33:20.989 --> 00:33:21.721
CONSIDER THE REAR PROPERTY      
LINE.                           
I THINK WE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE  

00:33:21.723 --> 00:33:23.423
LINE.                           
I THINK WE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE  
TO PAY A 40 FOOT SETBACK        

00:33:23.425 --> 00:33:24.157
I THINK WE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE  
TO PAY A 40 FOOT SETBACK        
BECAUSE THERE&apos;S GOT TO BE A NO  

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:26.959
TO PAY A 40 FOOT SETBACK

I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A COUPLE 
OF THINGS.                      
SO THERE IS A SIDEWALK ALONG    

00:41:55.736 --> 00:41:56.235
OF THINGS.                      
SO THERE IS A SIDEWALK ALONG    
RIGHT UP DOWN HERE.             

00:41:56.237 --> 00:41:56.569
SO THERE IS A SIDEWALK ALONG

ROBIN ROAD.                     
CORRECT.                        
I&apos;M NOT SURE WHAT ENGINEERING   

00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.875
CORRECT.                        
I&apos;M NOT SURE WHAT ENGINEERING

PROGRAM HAS AND THE FUTURE FOR  

00:42:03.677 --> 00:42:06.879
OR THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS     
PROGRAM HAS AND THE FUTURE FOR  
THE SIDEWALKS BUT THEY WOULD BE 

00:42:06.881 --> 00:42:07.647
PROGRAM HAS AND THE FUTURE FOR  
THE SIDEWALKS BUT THEY WOULD BE 
BETWEEN THIS PROPERTY BOUNDARY  

00:42:07.649 --> 00:42:10.916
THE SIDEWALKS BUT THEY WOULD BE 
BETWEEN THIS PROPERTY BOUNDARY  
AND ROBIN SO THEY&apos;D BE IN THIS  

00:42:10.918 --> 00:42:11.384
BETWEEN THIS PROPERTY BOUNDARY  
AND ROBIN SO THEY&apos;D BE IN THIS  
RIGHT AWAY AREA.                

00:42:11.386 --> 00:42:14.620
AND ROBIN SO THEY&apos;D BE IN THIS  
RIGHT AWAY AREA.                
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING THAT I      

00:42:14.622 --> 00:42:15.354
RIGHT AWAY AREA.                
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING THAT I      
THINK THAT&apos;S BEEN MENTIONED AND 

00:42:15.356 --> 00:42:18.023
SO THAT&apos;S ONE THING THAT I      
THINK THAT&apos;S BEEN MENTIONED AND 
CONSIDERED I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW     

00:42:18.025 --> 00:42:19.091
THINK THAT&apos;S BEEN MENTIONED AND 
CONSIDERED I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW     
THAT WOULD PLAY INTO OR IMPACT  

00:42:19.093 --> 00:42:22.327
CONSIDERED I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW     
THAT WOULD PLAY INTO OR IMPACT  
THE GARAGE PROJECT.             

00:42:22.329 --> 00:42:23.562
THAT WOULD PLAY INTO OR IMPACT  
THE GARAGE PROJECT.             
THE OTHER THINGS ARE THERE IS A 

00:42:23.564 --> 00:42:26.265
THE GARAGE PROJECT.             
THE OTHER THINGS ARE THERE IS A 
SIGNIFICANT TOPOGRAPHICAL       

00:42:26.267 --> 00:42:27.032
THE OTHER THINGS ARE THERE IS A 
SIGNIFICANT TOPOGRAPHICAL       
CHANGE AND I WILL SHOW YOU      

00:42:27.034 --> 00:42:29.936
SIGNIFICANT TOPOGRAPHICAL       
CHANGE AND I WILL SHOW YOU      
WHERE MY CAR WAS THE VEHICLE    

00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:30.936
CHANGE AND I WILL SHOW YOU      
WHERE MY CAR WAS THE VEHICLE    
WAS PARKED WHEN I TOOK THESE    

00:42:30.938 --> 00:42:31.303
WHERE MY CAR WAS THE VEHICLE    
WAS PARKED WHEN I TOOK THESE    
PHOTOS.                         

00:42:31.305 --> 00:42:31.971
WAS PARKED WHEN I TOOK THESE    
PHOTOS.                         
THAT&apos;S MY TRUCK DOWN THERE.     

00:42:31.973 --> 00:42:34.607
PHOTOS.                         
THAT&apos;S MY TRUCK DOWN THERE.     
IT&apos;S PROBABLY TWENTY FEET DOWN  

00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:35.341
THAT&apos;S MY TRUCK DOWN THERE.     
IT&apos;S PROBABLY TWENTY FEET DOWN  
FROM WHERE I&apos;M STANDING AND     

00:42:35.343 --> 00:42:37.977
IT&apos;S PROBABLY TWENTY FEET DOWN  
FROM WHERE I&apos;M STANDING AND     
THEN I WILL MENTION THE FACT    

00:42:37.979 --> 00:42:41.547
FROM WHERE I&apos;M STANDING AND     
THEN I WILL MENTION THE FACT    
THAT SO YOU DO HAVE A A LOT     

00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:42.214
THEN I WILL MENTION THE FACT    
THAT SO YOU DO HAVE A A LOT     
THAT HAS THREE FRONTAGES BUT    

00:42:42.216 --> 00:42:45.284
THAT SO YOU DO HAVE A A LOT     
THAT HAS THREE FRONTAGES BUT    
HOCKEY LANE IS A PRIVATE ROAD   

00:42:45.286 --> 00:42:46.219
THAT HAS THREE FRONTAGES BUT    
HOCKEY LANE IS A PRIVATE ROAD   
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHY THERE&apos;S A 40  

00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:49.221
HOCKEY LANE IS A PRIVATE ROAD   
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHY THERE&apos;S A 40  
FOOT REAR SET BACK.             

00:42:49.223 --> 00:42:50.222
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHY THERE&apos;S A 40  
FOOT REAR SET BACK.             
THERE COULD POSSIBLY BE A 30    

00:42:50.224 --> 00:42:53.059
FOOT REAR SET BACK.             
THERE COULD POSSIBLY BE A 30    
FOOT SET BACK ON THAT SIDE BUT  

00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:54.060
THERE COULD POSSIBLY BE A 30    
FOOT SET BACK ON THAT SIDE BUT  
PRIVATE ROAD SO YOU DO HAVE A   

00:42:54.062 --> 00:42:56.662
FOOT SET BACK ON THAT SIDE BUT  
PRIVATE ROAD SO YOU DO HAVE A   
30 FOOT FRONT SET BACK ON A 30  

00:42:56.664 --> 00:42:57.529
PRIVATE ROAD SO YOU DO HAVE A   
30 FOOT FRONT SET BACK ON A 30  
FOOT FRONT STEP BACK AND RUN    

00:42:57.531 --> 00:42:58.363
30 FOOT FRONT SET BACK ON A 30  
FOOT FRONT STEP BACK AND RUN    
RIGHT OUT AND THEN YOU HAVE     

00:42:58.365 --> 00:43:00.967
FOOT FRONT STEP BACK AND RUN    
RIGHT OUT AND THEN YOU HAVE     
THIS 40 FOOT REAR STEP BACK AND 

00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:04.037
RIGHT OUT AND THEN YOU HAVE     
THIS 40 FOOT REAR STEP BACK AND 
THEN YOU GET YOUR SIDE YARD SO  

00:43:04.039 --> 00:43:04.970
THIS 40 FOOT REAR STEP BACK AND 
THEN YOU GET YOUR SIDE YARD SO  
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE     

00:43:04.972 --> 00:43:08.274
THEN YOU GET YOUR SIDE YARD SO  
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE
