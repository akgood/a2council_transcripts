THAT WILL NOT BE ATTENDED TO    
BECAUSE IT REQUIRES SO MUCH     

00:16:44.112 --> 00:16:47.045
THAT WILL NOT BE ATTENDED TO    
BECAUSE IT REQUIRES SO MUCH     
EFFORT AND TIME AND WILLINGNESS 

00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:47.980
BECAUSE IT REQUIRES SO MUCH     
EFFORT AND TIME AND WILLINGNESS 
BY MORE THAN ONE PARTY TO       

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:50.650
EFFORT AND TIME AND WILLINGNESS 
BY MORE THAN ONE PARTY TO       
REALLY LOOK AT THE PLAN AND GO  

00:16:50.652 --> 00:16:54.220
BY MORE THAN ONE PARTY TO       
REALLY LOOK AT THE PLAN AND GO  
ON SITE AND SEE WHAT THE        

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:54.820
REALLY LOOK AT THE PLAN AND GO  
ON SITE AND SEE WHAT THE        
CONCERNS WOULD BE.              

00:16:54.822 --> 00:16:58.491
ON SITE AND SEE WHAT THE        
CONCERNS WOULD BE.              
THERE ALSO INCLUDE IF A SINGLE  

00:16:58.493 --> 00:17:01.927
CONCERNS WOULD BE.              
THERE ALSO INCLUDE IF A SINGLE  
FAMILY, A SINGLE STORY HOUSE    

00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:02.861
THERE ALSO INCLUDE IF A SINGLE  
FAMILY, A SINGLE STORY HOUSE    
HAS SOLAR PANELS AND IF YOU     

00:17:02.863 --> 00:17:05.831
FAMILY, A SINGLE STORY HOUSE    
HAS SOLAR PANELS AND IF YOU     
BUILD EVEN A TWO STORY HOUSE    

00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:09.868
HAS SOLAR PANELS AND IF YOU     
BUILD EVEN A TWO STORY HOUSE    
NEAR IT IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH 

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:10.502
BUILD EVEN A TWO STORY HOUSE    
NEAR IT IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH 
THE SOLAR PANELS.               

00:17:10.504 --> 00:17:11.670
NEAR IT IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH 
THE SOLAR PANELS.               
SO THAT'S A CONCERN I HAVE THE  

00:17:11.672 --> 00:17:14.706
THE SOLAR PANELS.               
SO THAT'S A CONCERN I HAVE THE  
OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THE     

00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:18.977
SO THAT'S A CONCERN I HAVE THE  
OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THE     
TREES AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME   

00:17:18.979 --> 00:17:21.180

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PLANT THE    
NUMBER OF TREES THAT YOU'VE

NUMBER OF TREES THAT YOU'VE     
TAKEN OUT.

WITH HEAVY INDUSTRIAL AND LIGHT

WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO ALLOW     
HEAVY INDUSTRIAL USES           

00:18:39.126 --> 00:18:43.428
WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO ALLOW

THROUGHOUT MOST THE CITY.       

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.496

TO LIGHT INDUSTRIAL I.          
I THINK THAT IF IT SAYS HEAVY   

00:18:48.902 --> 00:18:51.804
TO LIGHT INDUSTRIAL I.          
I THINK THAT IF IT SAYS HEAVY   
INDUSTRIAL THEN CITY COUNCIL    

00:18:51.806 --> 00:18:52.604
I THINK THAT IF IT SAYS HEAVY   
INDUSTRIAL THEN CITY COUNCIL    
MIGHT FEEL SOME PRESSURE TO

INDUSTRIAL THEN CITY COUNCIL    
MIGHT FEEL SOME PRESSURE TO     
CREATE A SEGREGATED SEPARATE

00:18:56.077 --> 00:18:56.942
CREATE A SEGREGATED SEPARATE    
AREA FOR ALL INDUSTRIAL USES    
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE

AREA FOR ALL INDUSTRIAL USES    
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE 
A GOOD IDEA EITHER.

OF SRIRACHA SRIRACHA FACTORY    
THE HOT SAUCE MANUFACTURER AND  
I THINK THAT CASE IS ACTUALLY A 

00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:11.356
THE HOT SAUCE MANUFACTURER AND  
I THINK THAT CASE IS ACTUALLY A 
REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE.            

00:19:11.358 --> 00:19:12.290
I THINK THAT CASE IS ACTUALLY A 
REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE.            
I LOOKED INTO THAT AND IN       

00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:12.958
REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE.            
I LOOKED INTO THAT AND IN       
IRWINDALE, CALIFORNIA, SRIRACHA 

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.894
I LOOKED INTO THAT AND IN       
IRWINDALE, CALIFORNIA, SRIRACHA 
OPENED A FACTORY AND IT'S IN AN 

00:19:15.896 --> 00:19:16.429
IRWINDALE, CALIFORNIA, SRIRACHA 
OPENED A FACTORY AND IT'S IN AN 
EMPTY HEAVY INDUSTRIAL

OPENED A FACTORY AND IT'S IN AN 
EMPTY HEAVY INDUSTRIAL

SO THERE'S NO HOUSING ALLOWED   
IN THAT DISTRICT BUT IT'S NEAR

SO THERE'S NO HOUSING ALLOWED   
IN THAT DISTRICT BUT IT'S NEAR

SO THAT IDEA OF JUST CREATING A 
SEPARATE DISTRICT DIDN'T STOP

SO THAT IDEA OF JUST CREATING A 
SEPARATE DISTRICT DIDN'T STOP   
THE SERIOUS INDUSTRIAL NUISANCE 

00:19:30.611 --> 00:19:33.713
SEPARATE DISTRICT DIDN'T STOP

THERE ARE THERE ONLY BECAUSE    
THEY OWN THEIR OWN BUILDINGS    

00:49:47.259 --> 00:49:48.191
THERE ARE THERE ONLY BECAUSE    
THEY OWN THEIR OWN BUILDINGS

TO BE BUILT IN THEM.            
OUR SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS 
BOTH BY AND LARGE REMAIN FOR    

01:18:10.294 --> 01:18:13.596
OUR SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS

01:18:19.136 --> 01:18:21.570
NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH ARE ZONED   
OUR TWO WAY OR OUR FORESE       
CURRENTLY SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT 

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:22.705
OUR TWO WAY OR OUR FORESE       
CURRENTLY SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT 
THE OLD WEST SIDE, THE AREAS    

01:18:22.707 --> 01:18:24.706
CURRENTLY SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT 
THE OLD WEST SIDE, THE AREAS    
AROUND VIRGINIA PARK AND OTHERS 

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:25.574
THE OLD WEST SIDE, THE AREAS    
AROUND VIRGINIA PARK AND OTHERS 
WE HAVE LOTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS   

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:26.308
AROUND VIRGINIA PARK AND OTHERS 
WE HAVE LOTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS   
IN ANN ARBOR WHERE SINGLE       

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:28.944
WE HAVE LOTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS   
IN ANN ARBOR WHERE SINGLE       
FAMILY HOMES EXIST MIXED IN     

01:18:28.946 --> 01:18:29.544
IN ANN ARBOR WHERE SINGLE       
FAMILY HOMES EXIST MIXED IN     
WITH DUPLEXES AND SMALL         

01:18:29.546 --> 01:18:30.212
FAMILY HOMES EXIST MIXED IN     
WITH DUPLEXES AND SMALL         
APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND I THINK 

01:18:30.214 --> 01:18:33.682
WITH DUPLEXES AND SMALL         
APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND I THINK 
WE I DON'T I DON'T HEAR PEOPLE  

01:18:33.684 --> 01:18:34.350
APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND I THINK 
WE I DON'T I DON'T HEAR PEOPLE  
SAYING THAT THOSE ARE HORRIBLE  

01:18:34.352 --> 01:18:36.886
WE I DON'T I DON'T HEAR PEOPLE  
SAYING THAT THOSE ARE HORRIBLE  
PLACES TO LIVE.                 

01:18:36.888 --> 01:18:38.020
SAYING THAT THOSE ARE HORRIBLE  
PLACES TO LIVE.                 
I THINK ACTUALLY SOME OF THE    

01:18:38.022 --> 01:18:41.122
PLACES TO LIVE.                 
I THINK ACTUALLY SOME OF THE    
MOST DESIRABLE NEIGHBORHOODS IN 

01:18:41.124 --> 01:18:41.590
I THINK ACTUALLY SOME OF THE    
MOST DESIRABLE NEIGHBORHOODS IN 
OUR IN OUR CITY.                

01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:42.724
MOST DESIRABLE NEIGHBORHOODS IN 
OUR IN OUR CITY.                
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD    

01:18:42.726 --> 01:18:45.327
OUR IN OUR CITY.                
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD    
EXPAND THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR     

01:18:45.329 --> 01:18:48.997
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD    
EXPAND THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR     
THAT KIND OF DENSITY TO THE     

01:18:48.999 --> 01:18:49.698
EXPAND THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR     
THAT KIND OF DENSITY TO THE     
REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH  

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.301
THAT KIND OF DENSITY TO THE     
REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH  
IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE TO ME     

01:18:52.303 --> 01:18:53.168
REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH  
IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE TO ME     
BOTH BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW MORE 

01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:55.971
IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE TO ME     
BOTH BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW MORE 
HOME MORE HOUSES TO BE BUILT,   

01:18:55.973 --> 01:18:56.905
BOTH BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW MORE 
HOME MORE HOUSES TO BE BUILT,   
MORE UNITS TO BE BUILT, MORE    

01:18:56.907 --> 01:18:57.640
HOME MORE HOUSES TO BE BUILT,   
MORE UNITS TO BE BUILT, MORE    
PEOPLE TO LIVE HERE BUT ALSO    

01:18:57.642 --> 01:18:59.875
MORE UNITS TO BE BUILT, MORE    
PEOPLE TO LIVE HERE BUT ALSO    
BECAUSE THAT KIND OF DENSITY    

01:18:59.877 --> 01:19:00.809
PEOPLE TO LIVE HERE BUT ALSO    
BECAUSE THAT KIND OF DENSITY    
WILL BE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE   

01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:03.879
BECAUSE THAT KIND OF DENSITY    
WILL BE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE   
CITY AND THEN THERE ARE THREE   

01:19:03.881 --> 01:19:04.813
WILL BE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE   
CITY AND THEN THERE ARE THREE   
SMALL THINGS THAT I JUST SAW IN

IT'S A REPUTABLE NUMBER.        
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT     
WHEN YOU'RE PROJECTING          

01:26:43.206 --> 01:26:44.105
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT     
WHEN YOU'RE PROJECTING

POPULATION IN A MUNICIPALITY    
THAT CONSTRAINS HOUSING SUPPLY  
FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE OR AT

THAT CONSTRAINS HOUSING SUPPLY  
FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE OR AT    
ALL WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY        

01:26:48.311 --> 01:26:52.180
FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE OR AT    
ALL WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY        
LOOKING AT IS ITS POPULATION AS

A FUNCTION OF HOUSING GROWTH.   

01:26:55.618 --> 01:26:56.851
LOOKING AT IS ITS POPULATION AS 
A FUNCTION OF HOUSING GROWTH.   
SO THE MORE YOU ALLOW THE MORE  

01:26:56.853 --> 01:26:58.820
A FUNCTION OF HOUSING GROWTH.   
SO THE MORE YOU ALLOW THE MORE  
POPULATION IS TO GROW.

>> THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN       
LOOKING AT SANDHOGS PROJECTION  

01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:22.377
>> THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN       
LOOKING AT SANDHOGS PROJECTION  
IS THAT IT'S FLAT AND WE KNOW   

01:27:22.379 --> 01:27:25.480
LOOKING AT SANDHOGS PROJECTION  
IS THAT IT'S FLAT AND WE KNOW   
IT'S NOT FLAT BECAUSE EVERY     

01:27:25.482 --> 01:27:26.347

HOUSING SUPPLY WE SEE A GAUGE.  
WE KNOW THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING  
EXCEEDS THAT NUMBER.            

01:27:31.488 --> 01:27:33.821
WE KNOW THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING  
EXCEEDS THAT NUMBER.            
SO WHATEVER LOOKING AT

I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE     
NERVOUS WHEN THEY COME HERE AND

THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE         
FORMULATING SENTENCES AND I     

02:32:48.934 --> 02:32:50.000
THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE         
FORMULATING SENTENCES AND I     
THINK IF YOU ARE USED TO PUBLIC

THINK IF YOU ARE USED TO PUBLIC 
SPEAKING THAT CAN SEEM LIKE A

AND I ESPECIALLY DON'T LIKE THE 
CHANGE DURING A TIME OF WHERE   
WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE  

02:33:01.181 --> 02:33:04.448
CHANGE DURING A TIME OF WHERE   
WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE  
I CAN SEE ACTUALLY MAKING THIS  

02:33:04.450 --> 02:33:07.684
WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE  
I CAN SEE ACTUALLY MAKING THIS  
CHANGE WHEN WE'VE HAD 30 BORING

02:33:11.825 --> 02:33:12.556
MEETINGS IN A ROW AND YOU KNOW  
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO FEEL LIKE 
AN INFRINGEMENT ON PEOPLE'S     

02:33:12.558 --> 02:33:15.159
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO FEEL LIKE 
AN INFRINGEMENT ON PEOPLE'S     
RIGHTS TO SPEAK.                

02:33:15.161 --> 02:33:16.160
AN INFRINGEMENT ON PEOPLE'S     
RIGHTS TO SPEAK.                
I REALIZE PEOPLE CAN WRITE IN   

02:33:16.162 --> 02:33:19.029
RIGHTS TO SPEAK.                
I REALIZE PEOPLE CAN WRITE IN

I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD       
PUBLIC IMPRESSION.              

02:33:26.806 --> 02:33:27.838
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD       
PUBLIC IMPRESSION.              
IT DOES GIVE THE IMPRESSION     

02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:28.439

UM, SO I'M AFFIRMING THAT WE    
HAD A DISCUSSION THAT WE DID    
NOT WANT TO DOWN ZONE ANYTHING  

03:23:14.557 --> 03:23:18.192
HAD A DISCUSSION THAT WE DID    
NOT WANT TO DOWN ZONE ANYTHING  
THAT WAS ALREADY HIGHER DENSITY 

03:23:18.194 --> 03:23:18.526
NOT WANT TO DOWN ZONE ANYTHING  
THAT WAS ALREADY HIGHER DENSITY 
PERMITTED.                      

03:23:18.528 --> 03:23:21.196
THAT WAS ALREADY HIGHER DENSITY 
PERMITTED.                      
SO LIKE IF THE NEW PLAN COMES   

03:23:21.198 --> 03:23:22.063
PERMITTED.                      
SO LIKE IF THE NEW PLAN COMES   
IN IT DOESN'T TAKE SOMETHING    

03:23:22.065 --> 03:23:22.830
SO LIKE IF THE NEW PLAN COMES   
IN IT DOESN'T TAKE SOMETHING    
THAT IS A MULTIFAMILY AND THEN  

03:23:22.832 --> 03:23:25.834
IN IT DOESN'T TAKE SOMETHING    
THAT IS A MULTIFAMILY AND THEN  
RESTRICT WITH THE NEW ZONING    

03:23:25.836 --> 03:23:26.634
THAT IS A MULTIFAMILY AND THEN  
RESTRICT WITH THE NEW ZONING    
THE BURDEN OF PROOF THE RULES   

03:23:26.636 --> 03:23:29.370
RESTRICT WITH THE NEW ZONING    
THE BURDEN OF PROOF THE RULES   
THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT WHEN   

03:23:29.372 --> 03:23:30.304
THE BURDEN OF PROOF THE RULES   
THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT WHEN   
WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE LOGIC 

03:23:30.306 --> 03:23:33.007
THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT WHEN   
WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE LOGIC 
OF THE MAP WERE ROUGHLY STATED  

03:23:33.009 --> 03:23:34.275
WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE LOGIC 
OF THE MAP WERE ROUGHLY STATED  
I THINK BY ME AS WE CAN DOWN    

03:23:34.277 --> 03:23:37.078
OF THE MAP WERE ROUGHLY STATED  
I THINK BY ME AS WE CAN DOWN    
ZONE WITH A GOOD REASON         

03:23:37.080 --> 03:23:37.945
I THINK BY ME AS WE CAN DOWN    
ZONE WITH A GOOD REASON         
OTHERWISE WE OUGHT TO JUST RUN  

03:23:37.947 --> 03:23:38.279
ZONE WITH A GOOD REASON         
OTHERWISE WE OUGHT TO JUST RUN  
THE RUN.                        

03:23:38.281 --> 03:23:39.147
OTHERWISE WE OUGHT TO JUST RUN  
THE RUN.                        
THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR TO      

03:23:39.149 --> 03:23:41.616
THE RUN.                        
THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR TO      
TRANSITION INTO TRANSITION AND  

03:23:41.618 --> 03:23:42.150
THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR TO      
TRANSITION INTO TRANSITION AND  
EVERYTHING ELSE.                

03:23:42.152 --> 03:23:44.618
TRANSITION INTO TRANSITION AND  
EVERYTHING ELSE.                
YEAH RIGHT OK YEAH GO AHEAD.    

03:23:44.620 --> 03:23:45.953
EVERYTHING ELSE.                
YEAH RIGHT OK YEAH GO AHEAD.    
I WOULD JUST OFFER THAT I AFTER 

03:23:45.955 --> 03:23:48.589
YEAH RIGHT OK YEAH GO AHEAD.    
I WOULD JUST OFFER THAT I AFTER 
CAREFULLY LOOKING AT ALL        

03:23:48.591 --> 03:23:52.059
I WOULD JUST OFFER THAT I AFTER 
CAREFULLY LOOKING AT ALL        
SIXTEEN OF THESE AREAS I THINK  

03:23:52.061 --> 03:23:52.993
CAREFULLY LOOKING AT ALL        
SIXTEEN OF THESE AREAS I THINK  
THAT ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME    

03:23:52.995 --> 03:23:56.430
SIXTEEN OF THESE AREAS I THINK  
THAT ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME    
INCONSISTENCIES SO THERE ARE    

03:23:56.432 --> 03:23:57.264
THAT ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME    
INCONSISTENCIES SO THERE ARE    
SOME AREAS WHICH ARE THREE WITH 

03:23:57.266 --> 03:24:00.501
INCONSISTENCIES SO THERE ARE    
SOME AREAS WHICH ARE THREE WITH 
A DENSITY THE CURRENT DENSITY   

03:24:00.503 --> 03:24:01.368
SOME AREAS WHICH ARE THREE WITH 
A DENSITY THE CURRENT DENSITY   
DENSITY WOULD BE ALLOWABLE IN   

03:24:01.370 --> 03:24:04.872
A DENSITY THE CURRENT DENSITY   
DENSITY WOULD BE ALLOWABLE IN   
RESIDENTIAL YOU DON'T NEED TO   

03:24:04.874 --> 03:24:05.673
DENSITY WOULD BE ALLOWABLE IN   
RESIDENTIAL YOU DON'T NEED TO   
GO TO TRANSITION TO DO TOWN     

03:24:05.675 --> 03:24:08.609
RESIDENTIAL YOU DON'T NEED TO   
GO TO TRANSITION TO DO TOWN     
HOMES THAT ARE THREE STORIES    

03:24:08.611 --> 03:24:08.943
GO TO TRANSITION TO DO TOWN     
HOMES THAT ARE THREE STORIES    
HIGH.

HOMES THAT ARE THREE STORIES    
HIGH.                           
SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME AREAS 

03:24:09.946 --> 03:24:12.012
HIGH.                           
SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME AREAS 
THAT ARE CURRENTLY ZONED OUT    

03:24:12.014 --> 03:24:12.780
SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME AREAS 
THAT ARE CURRENTLY ZONED OUT    
THREE THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE 

03:24:12.782 --> 03:24:13.447
THAT ARE CURRENTLY ZONED OUT    
THREE THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE 
TO LEAVE IN RESIDENTIAL AND     

03:24:13.449 --> 03:24:15.749
THREE THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE 
TO LEAVE IN RESIDENTIAL AND     
THERE ARE SOME THAT MIGHT BE    

03:24:15.751 --> 03:24:16.383
TO LEAVE IN RESIDENTIAL AND     
THERE ARE SOME THAT MIGHT BE    
APPROPRIATE TO MOVE TO          

03:24:16.385 --> 03:24:16.784
THERE ARE SOME THAT MIGHT BE    
APPROPRIATE TO MOVE TO

MENTIONED BOIL IT DOWN TO THOSE 
FEW AREAS.

CUT ANYBODY OFF.                
I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT AGAIN  
THAT WE'RE TALKING AS IF THIS   

03:28:25.835 --> 03:28:26.500
I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT AGAIN  
THAT WE'RE TALKING AS IF THIS   
IS A ZONING MAP AND THAT'S      

03:28:26.502 --> 03:28:27.301
THAT WE'RE TALKING AS IF THIS   
IS A ZONING MAP AND THAT'S      
EXACTLY AND WE SHOULD NOT BE    

03:28:27.303 --> 03:28:27.702
IS A ZONING MAP AND THAT'S      
EXACTLY AND WE SHOULD NOT BE    
DOING THAT.                     

03:28:27.704 --> 03:28:28.369
EXACTLY AND WE SHOULD NOT BE    
DOING THAT.                     
ZONING IS JUST ONE OF THE       

03:28:28.371 --> 03:28:29.036
DOING THAT.                     
ZONING IS JUST ONE OF THE       
FACTORS OF A BUNCH OF FACTORS   

03:28:29.038 --> 03:28:29.837
ZONING IS JUST ONE OF THE       
FACTORS OF A BUNCH OF FACTORS   
THAT WENT INTO THESE DIFFERENT  

03:28:29.839 --> 03:28:30.504
FACTORS OF A BUNCH OF FACTORS   
THAT WENT INTO THESE DIFFERENT  
LINE CLASSIFICATIONS AND THAT'S 

03:28:30.506 --> 03:28:31.172
THAT WENT INTO THESE DIFFERENT  
LINE CLASSIFICATIONS AND THAT'S 
PART OF THE REASON I I SEE      

03:28:31.174 --> 03:28:31.706
LINE CLASSIFICATIONS AND THAT'S 
PART OF THE REASON I I SEE      
POSITIVE SIGNS.                 

03:28:31.708 --> 03:28:33.474
PART OF THE REASON I I SEE      
POSITIVE SIGNS.                 
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS BEING

USE MAPS.                       
IT'S NOT A STRICTLY ZONING      
CODE SO WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE   

03:28:38.615 --> 03:28:40.682
IT'S NOT A STRICTLY ZONING      
CODE SO WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE   
BIT MORE PRECISE IN HOW WE'RE   

03:28:40.684 --> 03:28:41.482
CODE SO WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE   
BIT MORE PRECISE IN HOW WE'RE

BIT MORE PRECISE IN HOW WE'RE

TO SAY THIS FUTURE LAND USE MAP 
IS DOWN ZONING THINGS.          

03:28:52.294 --> 03:28:55.163
TO SAY THIS FUTURE LAND USE MAP 
IS DOWN ZONING THINGS.          
IT'S CALLING FOR LESS DENSITY   

03:28:55.165 --> 03:28:56.163
IS DOWN ZONING THINGS.          
IT'S CALLING FOR LESS DENSITY   
MAY BE CALLING FOR A CHANGE IN  

03:28:56.165 --> 03:28:56.764
IT'S CALLING FOR LESS DENSITY   
MAY BE CALLING FOR A CHANGE IN  
ZONING THAT WOULD BE            

03:28:56.766 --> 03:28:57.498
MAY BE CALLING FOR A CHANGE IN  
ZONING THAT WOULD BE            
INCOMPATIBLE WITH WHAT WE'RE

ZONING THAT WOULD BE            
INCOMPATIBLE WITH WHAT WE'RE

INCOMPATIBLE WITH WHAT WE'RE    
TRYING TO DO, WHICH IS THIS IS  
MORE REALISTIC AND CLUNKY.      

03:29:01.570 --> 03:29:03.137
TRYING TO DO, WHICH IS THIS IS  
MORE REALISTIC AND CLUNKY.

03:29:04.073 --> 03:29:07.341
>> BUT I WANT TO BE A BIT MORE  
PRECISE IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.    
HAVING SAID THAT, I UNDERSTOOD  

03:29:07.343 --> 03:29:08.342
PRECISE IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.    
HAVING SAID THAT, I UNDERSTOOD  
THERE WAS A KIND OF A PROTOCOL  

03:29:08.344 --> 03:29:09.010
HAVING SAID THAT, I UNDERSTOOD  
THERE WAS A KIND OF A PROTOCOL  
THE STAFF IN THE PLANNING       

03:29:09.012 --> 03:29:12.913
THERE WAS A KIND OF A PROTOCOL  
THE STAFF IN THE PLANNING       
CONSULTANTS USED TO GET TO THE  

03:29:12.915 --> 03:29:13.648
THE STAFF IN THE PLANNING       
CONSULTANTS USED TO GET TO THE  
FUTURE LAND USE MAP AND ALL     

03:29:13.650 --> 03:29:15.916
CONSULTANTS USED TO GET TO THE  
FUTURE LAND USE MAP AND ALL     
OF THESE FACTORS AND ONE OF ONE 

03:29:15.918 --> 03:29:16.650
FUTURE LAND USE MAP AND ALL     
OF THESE FACTORS AND ONE OF ONE 
OF THE GOOD WAYS TO GET TO      

03:29:16.652 --> 03:29:18.986
OF THESE FACTORS AND ONE OF ONE 
OF THE GOOD WAYS TO GET TO      
FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IS TO APPLY 

03:29:18.988 --> 03:29:19.953
OF THE GOOD WAYS TO GET TO      
FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IS TO APPLY 
A STANDARD SET OF RULES TO      

03:29:19.955 --> 03:29:20.320
FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IS TO APPLY 
A STANDARD SET OF RULES TO      
EVERYBODY.                      

03:29:20.322 --> 03:29:23.691
A STANDARD SET OF RULES TO      
EVERYBODY.                      
BUT THEN YOU CAN GET SITE       

03:29:23.693 --> 03:29:24.492
EVERYBODY.                      
BUT THEN YOU CAN GET SITE       
SPECIFIC CONDITIONS WHERE IT'S  

03:29:24.494 --> 03:29:24.825
BUT THEN YOU CAN GET SITE       
SPECIFIC CONDITIONS WHERE IT'S  
NOT FAIR.

SPECIFIC CONDITIONS WHERE IT'S  
NOT FAIR.                       
SO THEN THE SECOND WAY YOU GET  

03:29:27.430 --> 03:29:28.295
NOT FAIR.                       
SO THEN THE SECOND WAY YOU GET  
TO FAIRNESS IS LOOK AT THE SITE 

03:29:28.297 --> 03:29:28.963
SO THEN THE SECOND WAY YOU GET

EVERY THING OF SAYING WE        
SHOULDN'T DO MORE WAS THE SAME  
THAT PEOPLE SAID THIRTY YEARS   

03:44:19.921 --> 03:44:20.220
SHOULDN'T DO MORE WAS THE SAME  
THAT PEOPLE SAID THIRTY YEARS   
AGO.                            

03:44:20.222 --> 03:44:22.622
THAT PEOPLE SAID THIRTY YEARS   
AGO.

AREA I THINK I MEAN I           
UNDERSTOOD THEM TO BE MORE      

03:57:58.339 --> 03:58:01.773
AREA I THINK I MEAN I           
UNDERSTOOD THEM TO BE MORE      
AROUND HUB'S OR WHERE YOU'RE    

03:58:01.775 --> 03:58:02.341
UNDERSTOOD THEM TO BE MORE      
AROUND HUB'S OR WHERE YOU'RE    
ACTUALLY TRANSITIONING.         

03:58:02.343 --> 03:58:03.075
AROUND HUB'S OR WHERE YOU'RE    
ACTUALLY TRANSITIONING.         
THERE'S NO TRANSITION HERE TO

ACTUALLY TRANSITIONING.         
THERE'S NO TRANSITION HERE TO   
TRANSITION TO.

THERE'S NO TRANSITION HERE TO   
TRANSITION TO.                  
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT    

03:58:06.848 --> 03:58:07.713
TRANSITION TO.                  
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT    
THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR A   

03:58:07.715 --> 03:58:10.249
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT    
THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR A   
TRANSITION BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE 

03:58:10.251 --> 03:58:11.050
THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR A   
TRANSITION BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE 
I WANT TO DO A NEIGHBORHOOD     

03:58:11.052 --> 03:58:14.119

I WANT TO DO A NEIGHBORHOOD     
SCALE ANALYSIS AND SAY ALL      

03:58:14.121 --> 03:58:14.887
I WANT TO DO A NEIGHBORHOOD     
SCALE ANALYSIS AND SAY ALL      
OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S A BAD   

03:58:14.889 --> 03:58:15.621
SCALE ANALYSIS AND SAY ALL      
OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S A BAD   
IDEA BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE      

03:58:15.623 --> 03:58:18.023
OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S A BAD   
IDEA BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE      
HEADING DOWN THE WRONG ROAD IF  

03:58:18.025 --> 03:58:18.924
IDEA BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE      
HEADING DOWN THE WRONG ROAD IF  
WE THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY I'M  

03:58:18.926 --> 03:58:20.659
HEADING DOWN THE WRONG ROAD IF  
WE THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY I'M  
MORE INCLINED TO GO WITH THE

WE THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY I'M  
MORE INCLINED TO GO WITH THE    
ALGORITHM THE SET OF FACTORS    

03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:25.130
MORE INCLINED TO GO WITH THE

THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE  

03:58:25.132 --> 03:58:25.932
ALGORITHM THE SET OF FACTORS    
THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE  
SOME LOGICAL SENSE OUT OF THIS  

03:58:25.934 --> 03:58:28.868
THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE  
SOME LOGICAL SENSE OUT OF THIS  
AND THEN ASK WHY WHY HAVE THE   

03:58:28.870 --> 03:58:29.735
SOME LOGICAL SENSE OUT OF THIS  
AND THEN ASK WHY WHY HAVE THE   
BUBBLE HERE THAT'S NOT REALLY   

03:58:29.737 --> 03:58:32.905
AND THEN ASK WHY WHY HAVE THE   
BUBBLE HERE THAT'S NOT REALLY   
TRANSITIONING TO ANYTHING.      

03:58:32.907 --> 03:58:33.672

MISNOMER, A WAY TO ME THAT IT   
ALWAYS HAS TO BE A TRANSITION   

03:59:23.524 --> 03:59:24.190
MISNOMER, A WAY TO ME THAT IT   
ALWAYS HAS TO BE A TRANSITION   
BETWEEN HUB AND SOMETHING ELSE. 

03:59:24.192 --> 03:59:24.924
ALWAYS HAS TO BE A TRANSITION   
BETWEEN HUB AND SOMETHING ELSE. 
IT'S DESCRIPTION ACTUALLY       

03:59:24.926 --> 03:59:25.591
BETWEEN HUB AND SOMETHING ELSE. 
IT'S DESCRIPTION ACTUALLY       
DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT BEING A   

03:59:25.593 --> 03:59:26.058
IT'S DESCRIPTION ACTUALLY       
DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT BEING A   
TRANSITIONAL ZONE.              

03:59:26.060 --> 03:59:26.858
DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT BEING A   
TRANSITIONAL ZONE.              
IT TALKS ABOUT IT JUST BEING A  

03:59:26.860 --> 03:59:27.593
TRANSITIONAL ZONE.              
IT TALKS ABOUT IT JUST BEING A  
MIXED AREA, A MIXED USE AREA    

03:59:27.595 --> 03:59:28.127
IT TALKS ABOUT IT JUST BEING A  
MIXED AREA, A MIXED USE AREA

WITH FLEXIBLE BLEND             
OF RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL BULBA 
SO I DO FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE  

03:59:29.597 --> 03:59:30.262
OF RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL BULBA 
SO I DO FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE  
OPERATING FROM A KIND

SO I DO FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE  
OPERATING FROM A KIND

>> SO I WONDER IF WE COULD MOVE 

03:59:37.972 --> 03:59:38.737
SPECIFIC DISCUSSION.            
>> SO I WONDER IF WE COULD MOVE 
THROUGH A FEW MORE AND          

03:59:38.739 --> 03:59:39.372
>> SO I WONDER IF WE COULD MOVE 
THROUGH A FEW MORE AND          
ESTABLISH THAT PRINCIPLE AND    

03:59:39.374 --> 03:59:42.641
THROUGH A FEW MORE AND          
ESTABLISH THAT PRINCIPLE AND    
THEN MAYBE RETURN TO THIS AND   

03:59:42.643 --> 03:59:43.575
ESTABLISH THAT PRINCIPLE AND    
THEN MAYBE RETURN TO THIS AND   
SEE IF THAT FEELS YEAH, WE CAN  

03:59:43.577 --> 03:59:46.244
THEN MAYBE RETURN TO THIS AND   
SEE IF THAT FEELS YEAH, WE CAN  
DO THAT MORE LARGE MANAGER I    

03:59:46.246 --> 03:59:48.948
SEE IF THAT FEELS YEAH, WE CAN  
DO THAT MORE LARGE MANAGER I    
JUST WANTED TO TO THE POINT     

03:59:48.950 --> 03:59:49.615
DO THAT MORE LARGE MANAGER I    
JUST WANTED TO TO THE POINT     
OF NONCONFORMING THOSE TYPES    

03:59:49.617 --> 03:59:53.786
JUST WANTED TO TO THE POINT     
OF NONCONFORMING THOSE TYPES    
OF CONCERNS THE THE ACTUAL      

03:59:53.788 --> 03:59:54.653
OF NONCONFORMING THOSE TYPES    
OF CONCERNS THE THE ACTUAL      
REZONING PROCESS SHOULD BE MORE 

03:59:54.655 --> 03:59:55.420
OF CONCERNS THE THE ACTUAL      
REZONING PROCESS SHOULD BE MORE 
SURGICAL AND THERE COULD BE     

03:59:55.422 --> 03:59:57.857
REZONING PROCESS SHOULD BE MORE 
SURGICAL AND THERE COULD BE     
DECISIONS TO SKIP OVER PUTTIES. 

03:59:57.859 --> 03:59:58.757
SURGICAL AND THERE COULD BE     
DECISIONS TO SKIP OVER PUTTIES. 
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO BRING UP   

03:59:58.759 --> 04:00:01.493
DECISIONS TO SKIP OVER PUTTIES. 
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO BRING UP   
THAT WE DID MODIFY THE PUDI     

04:00:01.495 --> 04:00:02.228
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO BRING UP   
THAT WE DID MODIFY THE PUDI     
MODIFICATION PROCESS THAT WAS   

04:00:02.230 --> 04:00:05.764
THAT WE DID MODIFY THE PUDI     
MODIFICATION PROCESS THAT WAS   
APPROVED BY COUNCIL IN JUNE     

04:00:05.766 --> 04:00:06.365
MODIFICATION PROCESS THAT WAS   
APPROVED BY COUNCIL IN JUNE     
THAT WOULD FOR EXAMPLE FOR      

04:00:06.367 --> 04:00:10.168
APPROVED BY COUNCIL IN JUNE     
THAT WOULD FOR EXAMPLE FOR      
MULTI PARCEL PUTTIES ALLOW      

04:00:10.170 --> 04:00:10.970
THAT WOULD FOR EXAMPLE FOR      
MULTI PARCEL PUTTIES ALLOW      
PEOPLE TO SPLIT OFF AND REZONE  

04:00:10.972 --> 04:00:13.539
MULTI PARCEL PUTTIES ALLOW      
PEOPLE TO SPLIT OFF AND REZONE  
AND IN THOSE INSTANCES WE WOULD 

04:00:13.541 --> 04:00:14.473
PEOPLE TO SPLIT OFF AND REZONE  
AND IN THOSE INSTANCES WE WOULD 
WANT TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE LAND 

04:00:14.475 --> 04:00:17.376
AND IN THOSE INSTANCES WE WOULD 
WANT TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE LAND 
USE MAP FOR GUIDANCE TO         

04:00:17.378 --> 04:00:18.443
WANT TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE LAND 
USE MAP FOR GUIDANCE TO         
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS TO DO FOR A

SORT OF ONE OFF REZONING        
OF THAT KIND.                   
SO IT DOES IT COULD ALSO BE     

04:00:22.784 --> 04:00:25.484
OF THAT KIND.                   
SO IT DOES IT COULD ALSO BE

NOT NECESSARILY PRODUCING AN ON 
CONFORMITY.                     
OK, NOW THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT

SEE ONE ALONG THE STADIUM AND   
SO I BELIEVE THE SUGGESTION     
THAT WE HAVE DOWN ZONE IS THAT  

04:57:33.977 --> 04:57:34.977
SO I BELIEVE THE SUGGESTION     
THAT WE HAVE DOWN ZONE IS THAT  
THE HUB SHOULD EXTEND ALL THE   

04:57:34.979 --> 04:57:38.547
THAT WE HAVE DOWN ZONE IS THAT  
THE HUB SHOULD EXTEND ALL THE   
WAY TO MATCH THE ONE IS WHAT

THE HUB SHOULD EXTEND ALL THE   
WAY TO MATCH THE ONE IS WHAT    
I'M INFERRING THE SUGGESTION IS 

04:57:42.352 --> 04:57:46.188
WAY TO MATCH THE ONE IS WHAT    
I'M INFERRING THE SUGGESTION IS 
I WONDERED WHY THIS IS IS THAT  

04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.522

CLEAR?                          
>> YEAH YEAH I DON'T AGREE.     
>> SO WE HAVE A HUB THAT MORE   

04:57:53.264 --> 04:57:54.196
>> YEAH YEAH I DON'T AGREE.     
>> SO WE HAVE A HUB THAT MORE   
OR LESS ALIGNS WITH THIS ONE    

04:57:54.198 --> 04:57:54.897
>> SO WE HAVE A HUB THAT MORE   
OR LESS ALIGNS WITH THIS ONE    
BUT SURROUNDING IT WE HAVE      

04:57:54.899 --> 04:57:57.766
OR LESS ALIGNS WITH THIS ONE    
BUT SURROUNDING IT WE HAVE      
TRANSITION THAT SO WE KIND      

04:57:57.768 --> 04:58:01.303
BUT SURROUNDING IT WE HAVE      
TRANSITION THAT SO WE KIND      
OF BROKE T.C. ONE UP INTO HUB   

04:58:01.305 --> 04:58:02.038
TRANSITION THAT SO WE KIND      
OF BROKE T.C. ONE UP INTO HUB   
AND TRANSITION AND AGAIN THAT'S 

04:58:02.040 --> 04:58:05.007
OF BROKE T.C. ONE UP INTO HUB   
AND TRANSITION AND AGAIN THAT'S 
JUST AS IT GETS CLOSER TO OUR   

04:58:05.009 --> 04:58:06.041
AND TRANSITION AND AGAIN THAT'S 
JUST AS IT GETS CLOSER TO OUR   
DISTRICTS THAT WE COULD TABOR   

04:58:06.043 --> 04:58:08.411
JUST AS IT GETS CLOSER TO OUR   
DISTRICTS THAT WE COULD TABOR   
HEIGHTS INTENSITY.              

04:58:08.413 --> 04:58:12.447
DISTRICTS THAT WE COULD TABOR   
HEIGHTS INTENSITY.              
BUT THIS WAS CALLED OUT DOWN    

04:58:12.449 --> 04:58:12.748

SO WE COULD EXTEND THE HUB ALL  
THE WAY THROUGH THE T ONE IF

IT'S JUST AROUND HOME WITH      
TRANSITION.                     
I MEAN I WOULD THINK SO BUT I   

05:03:22.225 --> 05:03:22.891
TRANSITION.                     
I MEAN I WOULD THINK SO BUT I   
DON'T SEE THAT ON THIS MAP.

I MEAN I WOULD THINK SO BUT I   
DON'T SEE THAT ON THIS MAP.

THEN I CAN SEE YOUR POINT HERE  

05:03:37.574 --> 05:03:40.241
OF DOWNTOWN BASICALLY UM AND    
THEN I CAN SEE YOUR POINT HERE  
LIKE LIKE NEAR SEVEN BETWEEN

THAT'S WHERE THE REALLY MORE    

05:03:52.256 --> 05:03:53.055

THAT'S WHERE THE REALLY MORE    
LIKE NEW DOWNTOWN CONCENTRATED  

05:03:53.057 --> 05:03:56.157
THAT'S WHERE THE REALLY MORE    
LIKE NEW DOWNTOWN CONCENTRATED
