THAT THE LOT IS SO SMALL        
COMPARED TO THE OTHER LOTS IN

THE NEIGHBORHOOD.               
&gt;&gt; WHAT WE ALSO ARE THINKING IS 
THAT BECAUSE THE ZONING CHANGE  

00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:34.403
&gt;&gt; WHAT WE ALSO ARE THINKING IS 
THAT BECAUSE THE ZONING CHANGE  
HERE WAS REALLY TO INCREASE     

00:19:34.405 --> 00:19:37.639
THAT BECAUSE THE ZONING CHANGE  
HERE WAS REALLY TO INCREASE

THIS AREA.

NEEDING TO WALK DOWN SEVERAL    
STEPS TO THE DECK BUT WHEN I    

00:20:37.568 --> 00:20:38.367
NEEDING TO WALK DOWN SEVERAL    
STEPS TO THE DECK BUT WHEN I

00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:45.941
AND DOWN STEPS ALL THE TIME     
ANYWAY.

WELL, IF ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS 
REALLY A PETTY ONE GRADE I      

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.212
WELL, IF ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS 
REALLY A PETTY ONE GRADE I      
DON&apos;T REALLY SEE THE NECESSITY  

00:20:50.214 --> 00:20:50.613
REALLY A PETTY ONE GRADE I      
DON&apos;T REALLY SEE THE NECESSITY  
FOR A NEW DECK.                 

00:20:50.615 --> 00:20:51.480
DON&apos;T REALLY SEE THE NECESSITY  
FOR A NEW DECK.                 
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A GREAT QUESTION      

00:20:51.482 --> 00:20:53.949
FOR A NEW DECK.                 
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A GREAT QUESTION      
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS     

00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:54.716
&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A GREAT QUESTION      
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS     
WE&apos;RE PUTTING THE WEST ADDITION 

00:20:54.718 --> 00:20:57.820
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS     
WE&apos;RE PUTTING THE WEST ADDITION 
ON IS TO CREATE A FIRST FLOOR   

00:20:57.822 --> 00:20:58.587
WE&apos;RE PUTTING THE WEST ADDITION 
ON IS TO CREATE A FIRST FLOOR   
MASTER SUITE IN THE EVENT THAT  

00:20:58.589 --> 00:21:01.790
ON IS TO CREATE A FIRST FLOOR   
MASTER SUITE IN THE EVENT THAT  
THEY CANNOT USE THE STAIRS.     

00:21:01.792 --> 00:21:02.791
MASTER SUITE IN THE EVENT THAT  
THEY CANNOT USE THE STAIRS.     
&gt;&gt; SO THAT PUTS EVERYTHING ON   

00:21:02.793 --> 00:21:05.260
THEY CANNOT USE THE STAIRS.     
&gt;&gt; SO THAT PUTS EVERYTHING ON   
ONE FLOOR ON ONE LEVEL I WANT   

00:21:05.262 --> 00:21:06.028
&gt;&gt; SO THAT PUTS EVERYTHING ON   
ONE FLOOR ON ONE LEVEL I WANT   
TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR  

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:09.165
ONE FLOOR ON ONE LEVEL I WANT   
TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR  
COMMENT SO THE BIT THE MASTER   

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:09.898
TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR  
COMMENT SO THE BIT THE MASTER   
BEDROOM SUITE WOULD OPEN UP     

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.568
COMMENT SO THE BIT THE MASTER   
BEDROOM SUITE WOULD OPEN UP     
ONTO THE DECK IMMEDIATELY AND   

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.469
BEDROOM SUITE WOULD OPEN UP     
ONTO THE DECK IMMEDIATELY AND   
THEY COULD EXIT THE HOUSE       

00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:14.003
ONTO THE DECK IMMEDIATELY AND   
THEY COULD EXIT THE HOUSE       
QUICKLY ADDRESS IT.             

00:21:14.005 --> 00:21:14.670
THEY COULD EXIT THE HOUSE       
QUICKLY ADDRESS IT.             
&gt;&gt; IT WOULDN&apos;T OPEN UP          

00:21:14.672 --> 00:21:16.872
QUICKLY ADDRESS IT.             
&gt;&gt; IT WOULDN&apos;T OPEN UP          
IMMEDIATELY ONTO THE DECK.      

00:21:16.874 --> 00:21:17.806
&gt;&gt; IT WOULDN&apos;T OPEN UP          
IMMEDIATELY ONTO THE DECK.      
BUT THE POINT IS THE THE        

00:21:17.808 --> 00:21:20.409
IMMEDIATELY ONTO THE DECK.      
BUT THE POINT IS THE THE        
ADDITION WE&apos;RE DOING IS         

00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:20.943
BUT THE POINT IS THE THE        
ADDITION WE&apos;RE DOING IS         
PROVIDING A FUTURE.             

00:21:20.945 --> 00:21:23.379
ADDITION WE&apos;RE DOING IS         
PROVIDING A FUTURE.             
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE AN OFFICE FOR  

00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:24.479
PROVIDING A FUTURE.             
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE AN OFFICE FOR  
NOW AND IN A BEDROOM IN THE     

00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:27.583
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE AN OFFICE FOR  
NOW AND IN A BEDROOM IN THE     
FUTURE RIGHT NOW THIS HOUSE     

00:21:27.585 --> 00:21:28.450
NOW AND IN A BEDROOM IN THE     
FUTURE RIGHT NOW THIS HOUSE     
DOESN&apos;T HAVE ANY SHOWER BATH    

00:21:28.452 --> 00:21:31.654
FUTURE RIGHT NOW THIS HOUSE     
DOESN&apos;T HAVE ANY SHOWER BATH    
TUB ON THE FIRST FLOOR.         

00:21:31.656 --> 00:21:32.755
DOESN&apos;T HAVE ANY SHOWER BATH    
TUB ON THE FIRST FLOOR.         
IT&apos;S A PART OF THE WHAT WE&apos;RE   

00:21:32.757 --> 00:21:33.422
TUB ON THE FIRST FLOOR.         
IT&apos;S A PART OF THE WHAT WE&apos;RE   
DOING IS ADDING A SHOWER,       

00:21:33.424 --> 00:21:35.257
IT&apos;S A PART OF THE WHAT WE&apos;RE   
DOING IS ADDING A SHOWER,       
MAKING THE BATHROOM BIGGER SO   

00:21:35.259 --> 00:21:36.358
DOING IS ADDING A SHOWER,       
MAKING THE BATHROOM BIGGER SO   
THE IDEA IS THE HOMEOWNER COULD 

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.560
MAKING THE BATHROOM BIGGER SO   
THE IDEA IS THE HOMEOWNER COULD 
LIVE ON JUST THE FIRST FLOOR IF 

00:21:38.562 --> 00:21:39.362
THE IDEA IS THE HOMEOWNER COULD 
LIVE ON JUST THE FIRST FLOOR IF 
SHE MUST DONE ALTERATIONS TO    

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:42.498
LIVE ON JUST THE FIRST FLOOR IF 
SHE MUST DONE ALTERATIONS TO    
NONCONFORMING USES ARE PRETTY   

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:42.865
SHE MUST DONE ALTERATIONS TO    
NONCONFORMING USES ARE PRETTY   
EASY.                           

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:43.999
NONCONFORMING USES ARE PRETTY   
EASY.                           
NO, I DON&apos;T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 

00:21:44.001 --> 00:21:44.467
EASY.                           
NO, I DON&apos;T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 
THAT AT ALL.                    

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:45.367
NO, I DON&apos;T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 
THAT AT ALL.                    
I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION

REGARDING THE DECK FROM THE     
FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE TO THE 

00:21:48.272 --> 00:21:50.972
REGARDING THE DECK FROM THE     
FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE TO THE 
YARD WITHOUT THE DECK.          

00:21:50.974 --> 00:21:54.643
FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE TO THE 
YARD WITHOUT THE DECK.          
HOW MANY FEET DOWN IS THAT?     

00:21:54.645 --> 00:21:55.377
YARD WITHOUT THE DECK.

HOW MANY FEET DOWN IS THAT?     
&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S ABOUT TWO FEET.         
OK, IF WE PUT THE PATIO AND     

00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:59.315

OK, IF WE PUT THE PATIO AND     
WE&apos;RE PROBABLY GOING TO RAISE   

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:01.850

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROPERTY.  

00:22:18.001 --> 00:22:18.834
PERVIOUS IMPERVIOUS             
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROPERTY.  
WHAT WE DISCOVERED WHEN WE DID  

00:22:18.836 --> 00:22:20.602
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROPERTY.  
WHAT WE DISCOVERED WHEN WE DID  
THE DIGGING WHICH WAS A REAL

THIS CASE GIVEN THE NATURE      
OF THE SOILS AND THE FACT THAT  
STORMWATER RUNOFF WILL BE EASY  

00:27:18.268 --> 00:27:21.136
OF THE SOILS AND THE FACT THAT  
STORMWATER RUNOFF WILL BE EASY

00:27:21.138 --> 00:27:22.036
STORMWATER RUNOFF WILL BE EASY

I BELIEVE THERE IS A PRACTICAL  

00:27:22.038 --> 00:27:24.973

I BELIEVE THERE IS A PRACTICAL  
DIFFICULTY BASED ON THE         

00:27:24.975 --> 00:27:25.641
I BELIEVE THERE IS A PRACTICAL  
DIFFICULTY BASED ON THE         
HISTORIC DIVISIONS OF LIGHT     

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:29.478

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.578
HISTORIC DIVISIONS OF LIGHT     
DIVISIONS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD  
AND THE SIZE OF THE LOT I I SEE 

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.615
DIVISIONS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD  
AND THE SIZE OF THE LOT I I SEE 
THAT THAT IS IN AND OF ITSELF A

AND THE SIZE OF THE LOT I I SEE 
THAT THAT IS IN AND OF ITSELF A 
PECULIAR EXCEPTION.             

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:37.953
THAT THAT IS IN AND OF ITSELF A 
PECULIAR EXCEPTION.             
IT IS NOT COMMON.               

00:27:37.955 --> 00:27:38.620
PECULIAR EXCEPTION.             
IT IS NOT COMMON.               
THERE ARE OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS   

00:27:38.622 --> 00:27:41.189
IT IS NOT COMMON.               
THERE ARE OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS   
THAT HAVE SIMILAR PRACTICAL     

00:27:41.191 --> 00:27:42.057
THERE ARE OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS   
THAT HAVE SIMILAR PRACTICAL     
DIFFICULTIES BUT I SEE THAT     

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:48.130
THAT HAVE SIMILAR PRACTICAL     
DIFFICULTIES BUT I SEE THAT     
THAT JUST HEAR THE NUMBER       

00:27:48.132 --> 00:27:49.030
DIFFICULTIES BUT I SEE THAT     
THAT JUST HEAR THE NUMBER       
OF LETTERS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE  

00:27:49.032 --> 00:27:52.667
THAT JUST HEAR THE NUMBER       
OF LETTERS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE  
SPOKEN AND WRITTEN US IN

MEETING ALSO SPEAKS TO ME TWO   
STANDARD THREE ALLOWING THE

STANDARD THREE ALLOWING THE     
VARIANCE WILL RESULT IN         

00:28:01.011 --> 00:28:01.809
STANDARD THREE ALLOWING THE     
VARIANCE WILL RESULT IN         
SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE BEING DONE  

00:28:01.811 --> 00:28:04.645
VARIANCE WILL RESULT IN         
SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE BEING DONE  
CONSIDERING THE PUBLIC BENEFITS 

00:28:04.647 --> 00:28:05.279
SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE BEING DONE  
CONSIDERING THE PUBLIC BENEFITS 
OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE.        

00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:07.882
CONSIDERING THE PUBLIC BENEFITS 
OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE.        
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT 

00:28:07.884 --> 00:28:08.917
OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE.        
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT 
WILL BE SUFFERED BY FAILURE TO  

00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:09.851
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT 
WILL BE SUFFERED BY FAILURE TO  
GRANT A VARIANCE AND THE RIGHTS 

00:28:09.853 --> 00:28:12.454
WILL BE SUFFERED BY FAILURE TO  
GRANT A VARIANCE AND THE RIGHTS 
OF OTHERS WHOSE PROPERTY WOULD  

00:28:12.456 --> 00:28:13.188
GRANT A VARIANCE AND THE RIGHTS 
OF OTHERS WHOSE PROPERTY WOULD  
BE AFFECTED BY ALLOWING THE     

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.522
OF OTHERS WHOSE PROPERTY WOULD  
BE AFFECTED BY ALLOWING THE     
VARIANCE.                       

00:28:13.524 --> 00:28:16.391
BE AFFECTED BY ALLOWING THE     
VARIANCE.                       
AND I SEE ALL THAT OUTPOURING   

00:28:16.393 --> 00:28:19.160
VARIANCE.                       
AND I SEE ALL THAT OUTPOURING   
OF SUPPORT IS DIRECTLY SPEAKING 

00:28:19.162 --> 00:28:23.231
AND I SEE ALL THAT OUTPOURING   
OF SUPPORT IS DIRECTLY SPEAKING 
TO THAT STANDARD THAT WE WERE   

00:28:23.233 --> 00:28:24.298
OF SUPPORT IS DIRECTLY SPEAKING 
TO THAT STANDARD THAT WE WERE   
ASKED TO MEET SEE MET IN ORDER  

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.302
TO THAT STANDARD THAT WE WERE   
ASKED TO MEET SEE MET IN ORDER  
TO GRANT VARIANCE.              

00:28:27.304 --> 00:28:31.205
ASKED TO MEET SEE MET IN ORDER  
TO GRANT VARIANCE.              
SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS.   

00:28:31.207 --> 00:28:32.440
TO GRANT VARIANCE.              
SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS.   
I THINK IT&apos;S A MINOR CHANGE     

00:28:32.442 --> 00:28:35.811
SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS.   
I THINK IT&apos;S A MINOR CHANGE     
WHICH WON&apos;T HAVE ANY NEGATIVE   

00:28:35.813 --> 00:28:37.412
I THINK IT&apos;S A MINOR CHANGE     
WHICH WON&apos;T HAVE ANY NEGATIVE   
IMPACTS ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

GRACE.

WHAT THEY&apos;VE SAID THAT I FEEL   
THAT THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY   

00:28:46.056 --> 00:28:49.991
WHAT THEY&apos;VE SAID THAT I FEEL   
THAT THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY   
IS DEFINITELY THAT BY THE FACT  

00:28:49.993 --> 00:28:50.658
THAT THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY   
IS DEFINITELY THAT BY THE FACT  
THAT THIS LAW IS SO MUCH        

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.494
IS DEFINITELY THAT BY THE FACT  
THAT THIS LAW IS SO MUCH        
SMALLER THAN OTHER LOTS LOCATED 

00:28:53.496 --> 00:28:54.429
THAT THIS LAW IS SO MUCH        
SMALLER THAN OTHER LOTS LOCATED

THINK THAT IT IT MAKES SENSE TO 
ENCLOSE THAT AS IT IS BASED ON  

00:29:02.105 --> 00:29:05.173
THINK THAT IT IT MAKES SENSE TO 
ENCLOSE THAT AS IT IS BASED ON  
THE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE.

ENCLOSE THAT AS IT IS BASED ON  
THE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE.

YEAH THAT WOULD REQUIRE A       
BUILDING PERMIT BUT IT&apos;S THE    

00:29:30.701 --> 00:29:32.967
YEAH THAT WOULD REQUIRE A       
BUILDING PERMIT BUT IT&apos;S THE    
SAME FOOTPRINT AS THE DUCK IF

&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT COVERS          
EVERYTHING.                     

01:07:17.732 --> 01:07:18.531

EVERYTHING.                     
LIKE I SAID, THE BEDROOM ITSELF 

01:07:18.533 --> 01:07:20.432
EVERYTHING.                     
LIKE I SAID, THE BEDROOM ITSELF 
IS WITHIN THE SET BACK LINE SO  

01:07:20.434 --> 01:07:23.402
LIKE I SAID, THE BEDROOM ITSELF 
IS WITHIN THE SET BACK LINE SO  
IT&apos;S JUST THE GARAGE AND AS     

01:07:23.404 --> 01:07:24.303

IT&apos;S JUST THE GARAGE AND AS     
JOHN POINTED OUT, THE EXISTING  

01:07:24.305 --> 01:07:27.840
IT&apos;S JUST THE GARAGE AND AS     
JOHN POINTED OUT, THE EXISTING  
GARAGE IS YOU&apos;RE JUST A LITTLE  

01:07:27.842 --> 01:07:28.441
JOHN POINTED OUT, THE EXISTING  
GARAGE IS YOU&apos;RE JUST A LITTLE

OVER TWO FEET AWAY FROM         
PROPERTY LINE.

SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE AN

IT SEEMS LIKE THEY&apos;RE DOING NOT 
EVEN LIKE BARELY ANYTHING.      

01:47:45.958 --> 01:47:46.890
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY&apos;RE DOING NOT 
EVEN LIKE BARELY ANYTHING.

01:47:56.068 --> 01:47:59.769
WELL, I&apos;M SORT OF ON THE FENCE  
FOR THIS BUT I WOULD NOT REPEAT 
MY EARLIER COMMENT THAT IT&apos;S    

01:47:59.771 --> 01:48:00.403
FOR THIS BUT I WOULD NOT REPEAT 
MY EARLIER COMMENT THAT IT&apos;S    
ALWAYS THE INSTITUTION&apos;S        

01:48:00.405 --> 01:48:03.974
MY EARLIER COMMENT THAT IT&apos;S    
ALWAYS THE INSTITUTION&apos;S        
INTEREST TO MINIMIZE UTILITY    

01:48:03.976 --> 01:48:07.710
ALWAYS THE INSTITUTION&apos;S        
INTEREST TO MINIMIZE UTILITY    
COST AND I IMAGINE THAT GLACIER 

01:48:07.712 --> 01:48:08.445
INTEREST TO MINIMIZE UTILITY    
COST AND I IMAGINE THAT GLACIER 
HILLS IS ALREADY REPLACED ALL   

01:48:08.447 --> 01:48:09.479
COST AND I IMAGINE THAT GLACIER 
HILLS IS ALREADY REPLACED ALL   
IT&apos;S OLD FOR A LOT OF THE OLD   

01:48:09.481 --> 01:48:12.248
HILLS IS ALREADY REPLACED ALL   
IT&apos;S OLD FOR A LOT OF THE OLD   
INEFFICIENT LIGHTS WITH GOOD    

01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:12.483
IT&apos;S OLD FOR A LOT OF THE OLD   
INEFFICIENT LIGHTS WITH GOOD    
ONES.                           

01:48:12.485 --> 01:48:15.552
INEFFICIENT LIGHTS WITH GOOD    
ONES.                           
THE PROBLEM APPARENTLY THEY     

01:48:15.554 --> 01:48:16.519
ONES.                           
THE PROBLEM APPARENTLY THEY     
HAVE ACCORDING TO MR. BETTS WAS 

01:48:16.521 --> 01:48:17.220
THE PROBLEM APPARENTLY THEY     
HAVE ACCORDING TO MR. BETTS WAS 
THEY CAN&apos;T DOCUMENT THAT THESE  

01:48:17.222 --> 01:48:20.357
HAVE ACCORDING TO MR. BETTS WAS 
THEY CAN&apos;T DOCUMENT THAT THESE  
LIGHTS WOULD BE UP TO THE       

01:48:20.359 --> 01:48:21.024
THEY CAN&apos;T DOCUMENT THAT THESE  
LIGHTS WOULD BE UP TO THE       
CURRENT STANDARDS.              

01:48:21.026 --> 01:48:21.725
LIGHTS WOULD BE UP TO THE       
CURRENT STANDARDS.              
SO THE ASSUMPTION TO BE THEN    

01:48:21.727 --> 01:48:24.060
CURRENT STANDARDS.              
SO THE ASSUMPTION TO BE THEN    
THAT THE CITY WOULD MAKE THEM   

01:48:24.062 --> 01:48:24.728
SO THE ASSUMPTION TO BE THEN    
THAT THE CITY WOULD MAKE THEM   
CHANGE THAT BUT THAT MIGHT OR   

01:48:24.730 --> 01:48:27.030
THAT THE CITY WOULD MAKE THEM   
CHANGE THAT BUT THAT MIGHT OR

AGAINST THE PROPERTY LINE SO    

01:55:59.952 --> 01:56:02.685
PARKING RIGHT NOW GOES RIGHT    
AGAINST THE PROPERTY LINE SO    
THERE IS NO BUFFER PROVIDED IN

THAT&apos;S PROVIDED THROUGH THERE.  
SO OBVIOUSLY BOTH SITES CAN USE 
THAT FOR SOLID WASTE FIRE, JUST

02:13:38.876 --> 02:13:39.808
THERE IS AT NIGHT WITH VEHICLES 
COMING IN COMING OUT.           
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CHICK  

02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:43.211
COMING IN COMING OUT.           
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CHICK  
FIL A OPENS FROM SIX THIRTY IN  

02:13:43.213 --> 02:13:47.282
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CHICK  
FIL A OPENS FROM SIX THIRTY IN  
THE MORNING TO 10:00 P.M. OK,   

02:13:47.284 --> 02:13:48.517
FIL A OPENS FROM SIX THIRTY IN  
THE MORNING TO 10:00 P.M. OK,   
THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT      

02:13:48.519 --> 02:13:51.253
THE MORNING TO 10:00 P.M. OK,   
THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT      
OF NOISE, A LOT OF CARS PARKING 

02:13:51.255 --> 02:13:51.920
THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT      
OF NOISE, A LOT OF CARS PARKING

THE REASON THAT THEY NEED THOSE 

02:13:52.723 --> 02:13:55.957

THE REASON THAT THEY NEED THOSE 
TEN PARKING SLOTS BACK THERE IS 

02:13:55.959 --> 02:13:56.591
THE REASON THAT THEY NEED THOSE 
TEN PARKING SLOTS BACK THERE IS 
BECAUSE THEY REMOVED THE        

02:13:56.593 --> 02:14:00.362
TEN PARKING SLOTS BACK THERE IS 
BECAUSE THEY REMOVED THE        
PARKING THAT ACCESS TO THE EAST 

02:14:00.364 --> 02:14:02.864
BECAUSE THEY REMOVED THE        
PARKING THAT ACCESS TO THE EAST 
SIDE OF THAT LOT IF YOU SEE     

02:14:02.866 --> 02:14:03.632
PARKING THAT ACCESS TO THE EAST 
SIDE OF THAT LOT IF YOU SEE     
THERE ARE LIKE EIGHT PARKING    

02:14:03.634 --> 02:14:07.102
SIDE OF THAT LOT IF YOU SEE     
THERE ARE LIKE EIGHT PARKING    
LOT SPOTS THERE, THEY REMOVE    

02:14:07.104 --> 02:14:10.705
THERE ARE LIKE EIGHT PARKING    
LOT SPOTS THERE, THEY REMOVE    
THOSE TO ALLOW TO WAIT TRAFFIC. 

02:14:10.707 --> 02:14:11.807
LOT SPOTS THERE, THEY REMOVE    
THOSE TO ALLOW TO WAIT TRAFFIC. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR SITE PLAN  

02:14:11.809 --> 02:14:15.243
THOSE TO ALLOW TO WAIT TRAFFIC. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR SITE PLAN  
TO WAY TRAFFIC IN THE ENTIRE A  

02:14:15.245 --> 02:14:15.544
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR SITE PLAN  
TO WAY TRAFFIC IN THE ENTIRE A  
LOT.                            

02:14:15.546 --> 02:14:18.980
TO WAY TRAFFIC IN THE ENTIRE A  
LOT.                            
SO THERE&apos;S TWO WAY FLOW         

02:14:18.982 --> 02:14:22.785
LOT.                            
SO THERE&apos;S TWO WAY FLOW         
OF TRAFFIC AROUND THEIR NEW     

02:14:22.787 --> 02:14:23.652
SO THERE&apos;S TWO WAY FLOW         
OF TRAFFIC AROUND THEIR NEW     
STRUCTURE SO THEY REMOVE THOSE  

02:14:23.654 --> 02:14:27.122
OF TRAFFIC AROUND THEIR NEW     
STRUCTURE SO THEY REMOVE THOSE  
AND THEY&apos;RE ASKING US TO GIVE   

02:14:27.124 --> 02:14:27.822
STRUCTURE SO THEY REMOVE THOSE  
AND THEY&apos;RE ASKING US TO GIVE   
UP FIVE FEET OF PROTECTION      

02:14:27.824 --> 02:14:31.025
AND THEY&apos;RE ASKING US TO GIVE   
UP FIVE FEET OF PROTECTION      
AGAINST NOISE, DIRT, DUST,      

02:14:31.027 --> 02:14:34.630
UP FIVE FEET OF PROTECTION      
AGAINST NOISE, DIRT, DUST,      
CARBON DIOXIDE FROM AMOUNT      

02:14:34.632 --> 02:14:35.430
AGAINST NOISE, DIRT, DUST,      
CARBON DIOXIDE FROM AMOUNT      
OF VEHICLES THAT VISIT A CHICK  

02:14:35.432 --> 02:14:38.066
CARBON DIOXIDE FROM AMOUNT      
OF VEHICLES THAT VISIT A CHICK

REGULATIONS IN PLACE FOR A      

02:27:22.231 --> 02:27:25.599
THINK WE HAVE SOME OF THESE     
REGULATIONS IN PLACE FOR A      
REASON PEOPLE DON&apos;T ALWAYS HAVE 

02:27:25.601 --> 02:27:26.300
REGULATIONS IN PLACE FOR A      
REASON PEOPLE DON&apos;T ALWAYS HAVE
