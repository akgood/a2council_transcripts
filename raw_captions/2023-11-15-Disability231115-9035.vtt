MUCH IN ARBOR&apos;S ONE OF THE BEST 

00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:32.623
ASSESSABLE YOU KNOW, PRETTY     
MUCH IN ARBOR&apos;S ONE OF THE BEST 
PRACTICES THAT WE TALK ABOUT.   

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:34.992
MUCH IN ARBOR&apos;S ONE OF THE BEST 
PRACTICES THAT WE TALK ABOUT.   
SO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT  

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:35.893
PRACTICES THAT WE TALK ABOUT.   
SO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT  
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STUDY

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STUDY   
AND WHY THAT MATTERS IS WE      

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:40.164
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STUDY   
AND WHY THAT MATTERS IS WE      
DON&apos;T LOOK AT THE CURB SPACE AS 

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:43.201
AND WHY THAT MATTERS IS WE      
DON&apos;T LOOK AT THE CURB SPACE AS 
JUST A PIECE OF CONCRETE WHAT   

00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:44.135
DON&apos;T LOOK AT THE CURB SPACE AS 
JUST A PIECE OF CONCRETE WHAT

COLLECTED DATA TO UNDERSTAND    
HOW THE HERBS ARE USED CITY     

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.795
COLLECTED DATA TO UNDERSTAND    
HOW THE HERBS ARE USED CITY     
DOWNTOWN AND WE COLLECTED DATA  

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:14.098
HOW THE HERBS ARE USED CITY     
DOWNTOWN AND WE COLLECTED DATA  
ON LIBERTY STREET AND KOREATOWN 

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:14.966
DOWNTOWN AND WE COLLECTED DATA  
ON LIBERTY STREET AND KOREATOWN 
AND THEN AREAS AROUND SOUTH     

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:18.469
ON LIBERTY STREET AND KOREATOWN 
AND THEN AREAS AROUND SOUTH     
UNIVERSITY AND FOR US NEAR THE  

00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:19.170
AND THEN AREAS AROUND SOUTH     
UNIVERSITY AND FOR US NEAR THE  
UNIVERSITY AND WHAT WE FOUND    

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:22.873
UNIVERSITY AND FOR US NEAR THE  
UNIVERSITY AND WHAT WE FOUND    
OVERALL WAS THAT THE CURB IS    

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:26.277
UNIVERSITY AND WHAT WE FOUND    
OVERALL WAS THAT THE CURB IS    
HIGHLY UTILIZED.                

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:27.211
OVERALL WAS THAT THE CURB IS    
HIGHLY UTILIZED.                
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF ACCESS         

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:30.081
HIGHLY UTILIZED.                
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF ACCESS         
HAPPENING BUT THAT PARKING      

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:30.948
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF ACCESS         
HAPPENING BUT THAT PARKING

METERS THERE&apos;S A PYLES ISSUE    
AND PARKING METERS ARE NOT      
ENFORCED SO THAT&apos;S THROWING     

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.888
AND PARKING METERS ARE NOT      
ENFORCED SO THAT&apos;S THROWING     
SOME PEAK TIMES OFF BALANCE AND 

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.589
ENFORCED SO THAT&apos;S THROWING     
SOME PEAK TIMES OFF BALANCE AND 
YOU&apos;RE UNABLE TO MANAGE SOME    

00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:41.759
SOME PEAK TIMES OFF BALANCE AND 
YOU&apos;RE UNABLE TO MANAGE SOME    
OF THESE PEAK TIMES CURB USE    

00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:45.429
YOU&apos;RE UNABLE TO MANAGE SOME    
OF THESE PEAK TIMES CURB USE    
MOST OF THE CURB SESSIONS AND   

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:46.163
OF THESE PEAK TIMES CURB USE    
MOST OF THE CURB SESSIONS AND

A NEED FOR SHORT TERM SPACES.   
THERE IS A NEED TO MOVE LONGER  
TERM PARKING GARAGES ARE        

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:10.274
THERE IS A NEED TO MOVE LONGER  
TERM PARKING GARAGES ARE        
THINKING ABOUT INCREASING RATES 

00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:11.142
TERM PARKING GARAGES ARE        
THINKING ABOUT INCREASING RATES 
OR EXPANDING METER TIMES.       

00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:12.209
THINKING ABOUT INCREASING RATES 
OR EXPANDING METER TIMES.       
BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN WE TALK      

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.211
OR EXPANDING METER TIMES.       
BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN WE TALK      
ABOUT REMOVING PARKING, WE      

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:14.945
BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN WE TALK      
ABOUT REMOVING PARKING, WE      
REALLY APPRECIATE THE NUANCE    

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:18.215
ABOUT REMOVING PARKING, WE      
REALLY APPRECIATE THE NUANCE    
THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE  

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:21.652
REALLY APPRECIATE THE NUANCE    
THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE  
IN PARK.                        

00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:22.786
THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE  
IN PARK.                        
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SO IT&apos;S NOT EITHER 

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:25.522
IN PARK.                        
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SO IT&apos;S NOT EITHER 
OR IF WE WANT TO BUILD A BIKE   

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:26.457
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SO IT&apos;S NOT EITHER 
OR IF WE WANT TO BUILD A BIKE   
LANE IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A     

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:27.124
OR IF WE WANT TO BUILD A BIKE   
LANE IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A     
TRANSIT LANE WE&apos;RE REALLY       

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:29.326
LANE IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A     
TRANSIT LANE WE&apos;RE REALLY       
THINKING ABOUT WELL WHERE&apos;S THE 

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.127
TRANSIT LANE WE&apos;RE REALLY       
THINKING ABOUT WELL WHERE&apos;S THE 
PARKING SPILLOVER GOING TO GO?  

00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:33.597
THINKING ABOUT WELL WHERE&apos;S THE 
PARKING SPILLOVER GOING TO GO?  
HOW DO WE MAINTAIN ACCESS TO    

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.364
PARKING SPILLOVER GOING TO GO?  
HOW DO WE MAINTAIN ACCESS TO    
BUSINESS AND ACCESS TO EVERYONE 

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:37.234
HOW DO WE MAINTAIN ACCESS TO    
BUSINESS AND ACCESS TO EVERYONE 
THAT NEEDS TO ARRIVE NO MATTER  

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:37.835
BUSINESS AND ACCESS TO EVERYONE 
THAT NEEDS TO ARRIVE NO MATTER  
THEIR TRAVEL MODE.              

00:20:37.837 --> 00:20:41.938
THAT NEEDS TO ARRIVE NO MATTER  
THEIR TRAVEL MODE.              
SO I THINKING THROUGH THAT      

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.409
THEIR TRAVEL MODE.              
SO I THINKING THROUGH THAT      
NUANCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR  

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:46.243
SO I THINKING THROUGH THAT      
NUANCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR  
PROVIDING ACCESS TO ALL         

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.612
NUANCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR  
PROVIDING ACCESS TO ALL         
OF THESE LOCATIONS.             

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:49.747
PROVIDING ACCESS TO ALL         
OF THESE LOCATIONS.             
SO JUST GETTING INTO THE DATA   

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:50.013
OF THESE LOCATIONS.             
SO JUST GETTING INTO THE DATA   
QUICKLY.                        

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:53.117
SO JUST GETTING INTO THE DATA   
QUICKLY.                        
SO HERE YOU CAN SEE IN          

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:53.851
QUICKLY.

PARKING AT THAT TIME AND THEN   
YOU CAN SEE THE WE LOOKED AT    

00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:33.891
PARKING AT THAT TIME AND THEN   
YOU CAN SEE THE WE LOOKED AT    
THE METER TRANSACTION COMPARED  

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:34.625
YOU CAN SEE THE WE LOOKED AT    
THE METER TRANSACTION COMPARED  
TO WHAT OUR CAMERA DATA SHOWED  

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:35.425
THE METER TRANSACTION COMPARED  
TO WHAT OUR CAMERA DATA SHOWED  
AN ACTUAL VIEWS AND YOU CAN SEE 

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:36.160
TO WHAT OUR CAMERA DATA SHOWED  
AN ACTUAL VIEWS AND YOU CAN SEE 
THIS ARROW IS POINTING TO THE

THIS ARROW IS POINTING TO THE   
GAP OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE      

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:37.494
THIS ARROW IS POINTING TO THE   
GAP OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE      
PAYING FOR METERS VERSUS        

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:38.228

PAYING FOR METERS VERSUS        
ACTUALLY USING THE CURB SPACE   

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.696
PAYING FOR METERS VERSUS        
ACTUALLY USING THE CURB SPACE   
FOR PARKING.

ACTUALLY USING THE CURB SPACE   
FOR PARKING.                    
SO THAT&apos;S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE   

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:40.664
FOR PARKING.                    
SO THAT&apos;S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE   
PEOPLE AREN&apos;T ADHERING TO THE

AVOID PAYING THE METER AND      
HOPING THEY GET AWAY WITH IT.   
NOT UNLIKE MANY CITIES IN       

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.146
HOPING THEY GET AWAY WITH IT.   
NOT UNLIKE MANY CITIES IN       
UNIVERSITY STUDY AREA AGAIN     

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:56.880
NOT UNLIKE MANY CITIES IN       
UNIVERSITY STUDY AREA AGAIN     
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF VEHICLES    

00:21:56.882 --> 00:22:00.051
UNIVERSITY STUDY AREA AGAIN     
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF VEHICLES    
WERE PARKING FOR LESS THAN      

00:22:00.053 --> 00:22:00.884
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF VEHICLES    
WERE PARKING FOR LESS THAN      
FIFTEEN MINUTES AND YOU CAN SEE 

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:04.188
WERE PARKING FOR LESS THAN      
FIFTEEN MINUTES AND YOU CAN SEE 
TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL THE CURB

FIFTEEN MINUTES AND YOU CAN SEE 
TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL THE CURB  
SESSIONS WERE UNDER TWO

SO THIS IS VERY SHORT TERM      

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:14.598
MINUTES.                        
SO THIS IS VERY SHORT TERM      
STAYS AGAIN CITY FLOW OF OF

AND AGAIN IN THIS UNIVERSITY    
STUDY AREA YOU CAN SEE THAT     

00:22:19.806 --> 00:22:22.940
AND AGAIN IN THIS UNIVERSITY    
STUDY AREA YOU CAN SEE THAT     
CIRCLE THAT HIGHLIGHTS A PEAK   

00:22:22.942 --> 00:22:23.808
STUDY AREA YOU CAN SEE THAT     
CIRCLE THAT HIGHLIGHTS A PEAK   
TIME OF PARKING WHEN THE METERS 

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.977
CIRCLE THAT HIGHLIGHTS A PEAK   
TIME OF PARKING WHEN THE METERS 
AREN&apos;T ENFORCED AND YOU GET A   

00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:27.678
TIME OF PARKING WHEN THE METERS 
AREN&apos;T ENFORCED AND YOU GET A   
BIG GAP BETWEEN PARKING METER   

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.081
AREN&apos;T ENFORCED AND YOU GET A   
BIG GAP BETWEEN PARKING METER   
PAYMENTS AND CURB USES SO       

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:33.850
BIG GAP BETWEEN PARKING METER   
PAYMENTS AND CURB USES SO       
PEOPLE JUST AREN&apos;T PAYING THAT  

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:34.585
PAYMENTS AND CURB USES SO       
PEOPLE JUST AREN&apos;T PAYING THAT  
METER BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE PARKING   

00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:35.252
PEOPLE JUST AREN&apos;T PAYING THAT  
METER BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE PARKING   
FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES AND      

00:22:35.254 --> 00:22:38.389
METER BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE PARKING   
FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES AND      
TRYING TO GET AWAY, YOU KNOW,   

00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:41.925
FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES AND      
TRYING TO GET AWAY, YOU KNOW,   
NOT HAVE TO PAY THE METER.      

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:43.227
TRYING TO GET AWAY, YOU KNOW,   
NOT HAVE TO PAY THE METER.      
&gt;&gt; AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON A   

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:46.463
NOT HAVE TO PAY THE METER.      
&gt;&gt; AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON A   
MAP WHEN I WE TALKED ABOUT THAT 

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:50.033

AND PEOPLE ARE LARGELY ADHERING 

00:23:44.691 --> 00:23:45.356
IS A FIFTEEN MINUTE CURB HERE   
AND PEOPLE ARE LARGELY ADHERING 
TO THAT REGULATION MOSTLY       

00:23:45.358 --> 00:23:49.059
AND PEOPLE ARE LARGELY ADHERING

HUNDRED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED    
CURB SESSIONS THAT WE VIEWED    
DURING OUR STUDY PERIOD WHICH   

00:24:08.581 --> 00:24:11.648
CURB SESSIONS THAT WE VIEWED    
DURING OUR STUDY PERIOD WHICH   
WAS A WEEK AND THAT JUST SHOWS  

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.650
DURING OUR STUDY PERIOD WHICH   
WAS A WEEK AND THAT JUST SHOWS  
A HIGH AMOUNT OF ACCESS BEING   

00:24:12.652 --> 00:24:16.420
WAS A WEEK AND THAT JUST SHOWS  
A HIGH AMOUNT OF ACCESS BEING   
PROVIDED ON THE STREET TO       

00:24:16.422 --> 00:24:16.820
A HIGH AMOUNT OF ACCESS BEING   
PROVIDED ON THE STREET TO       
BUSINESSES.

OF TURNOVER, A LOT OF PARKING   

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:24.094
BUT AGAIN JUST A LOT            
OF TURNOVER, A LOT OF PARKING   
IN FRONT OF THE DRIVEWAY AT THE 

00:24:24.096 --> 00:24:24.861
OF TURNOVER, A LOT OF PARKING   
IN FRONT OF THE DRIVEWAY AT THE

00:24:35.007 --> 00:24:36.106
SO THAT GETS INTO OUR           
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE STUDY.  
WE DO NEED TO REFORM SOME

SIXTEEN PARKING SPACES BUT      
MAINTAIN PARKING ON ONE SIDE    
OF THE STREET BECAUSE WE KNOW   

00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:01.518
MAINTAIN PARKING ON ONE SIDE    
OF THE STREET BECAUSE WE KNOW   
THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL NEED

THROUGH THE SPILLOVER LIKE      

00:27:17.903 --> 00:27:21.271
YOU KNOW IT&apos;S IT&apos;S THINKING     
THROUGH THE SPILLOVER LIKE      
WHERE CAN WE MAINTAIN A PARKING 

00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:21.672
THROUGH THE SPILLOVER LIKE      
WHERE CAN WE MAINTAIN A PARKING 
NEARBY?                         

00:27:21.674 --> 00:27:24.441
WHERE CAN WE MAINTAIN A PARKING 
NEARBY?                         
WHERE CAN YOU RELOCATE SHORT    

00:27:24.443 --> 00:27:27.778
NEARBY?                         
WHERE CAN YOU RELOCATE SHORT    
TERM PARKING ZONES KEEPING      

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.812
WHERE CAN YOU RELOCATE SHORT    
TERM PARKING ZONES KEEPING      
PARKING ON ONE SIDE OF THE      

00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:31.881
TERM PARKING ZONES KEEPING      
PARKING ON ONE SIDE OF THE      
STREET LIKE I SAID AND AND THEN 

00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:32.516
PARKING ON ONE SIDE OF THE      
STREET LIKE I SAID AND AND THEN 
JUST TAKING THAT ITERATIVE      

00:27:32.518 --> 00:27:33.316
STREET LIKE I SAID AND AND THEN 
JUST TAKING THAT ITERATIVE      
APPROACH FOR MANAGING THE BIKE  

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:33.650
JUST TAKING THAT ITERATIVE      
APPROACH FOR MANAGING THE BIKE  
LANE.                           

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:36.486
APPROACH FOR MANAGING THE BIKE  
LANE.                           
IT STARTED OUT WITH JUST        

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:37.154
LANE.                           
IT STARTED OUT WITH JUST        
DELINEATOR TO DETER ILLEGAL     

00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:39.957
IT STARTED OUT WITH JUST        
DELINEATOR TO DETER ILLEGAL     
PARKING AND THEN YOU OBSERVE    

00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:40.757
DELINEATOR TO DETER ILLEGAL     
PARKING AND THEN YOU OBSERVE    
OBSERVATION SHOW THAT PEOPLE    

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:43.427
PARKING AND THEN YOU OBSERVE    
OBSERVATION SHOW THAT PEOPLE    
WERE STILL PARKING THE BIKE     

00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:43.760
OBSERVATION SHOW THAT PEOPLE    
WERE STILL PARKING THE BIKE     
LANE.                           

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:46.830
WERE STILL PARKING THE BIKE     
LANE.                           
SO THAT&apos;S NOW GOING TO MOVE TO  

00:27:46.832 --> 00:27:47.797

JORDACHE DRIVERS AND YOU KNOW   

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:46.122
WHETHER THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE   
JORDACHE DRIVERS AND YOU KNOW

00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:52.763
BUT I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS     
INTERESTING BUT IT LOOKS LIKE   
WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.        

00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:53.696
INTERESTING BUT IT LOOKS LIKE   
WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.        
SO I&apos;LL START WITH COMMISSIONER 

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:56.099
WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.        
SO I&apos;LL START WITH COMMISSIONER

MORE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS      

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:05.675
PRESENTATION WASN&apos;T A LITTLE    
MORE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS      
OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY     

00:29:05.677 --> 00:29:08.945
MORE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS      
OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY     
BECAUSE WE, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, 

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:11.815
OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY     
BECAUSE WE, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, 
ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT ISSUES 

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:12.449
BECAUSE WE, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, 
ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT ISSUES 
REVENUE SHORTFALL AND           

00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:16.086
ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT ISSUES 
REVENUE SHORTFALL AND           
ENFORCEMENT THAN WE ARE ABOUT   

00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:16.753
REVENUE SHORTFALL AND           
ENFORCEMENT THAN WE ARE ABOUT   
ISSUES OF ACCESSIBILITY.        

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:20.858
ENFORCEMENT THAN WE ARE ABOUT   
ISSUES OF ACCESSIBILITY.        
SO I WAS JUST VERY SURPRISED AT 

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.460
ISSUES OF ACCESSIBILITY.        
SO I WAS JUST VERY SURPRISED AT 
HOW LITTLE DATA YOU WERE        

00:29:23.462 --> 00:29:24.061
SO I WAS JUST VERY SURPRISED AT 
HOW LITTLE DATA YOU WERE

PARKING SPECIFICALLY WHETHER    
THAT ONE OUT OF TWENTY FIVE IS  

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.768
PARKING SPECIFICALLY WHETHER    
THAT ONE OUT OF TWENTY FIVE IS  
SUFFICIENT, HOW MANY OF THE     

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.905
THAT ONE OUT OF TWENTY FIVE IS  
SUFFICIENT, HOW MANY OF THE     
VIOLATIONS ARE UNLAWFUL PARKING 

00:29:34.907 --> 00:29:35.438
SUFFICIENT, HOW MANY OF THE     
VIOLATIONS ARE UNLAWFUL PARKING 
ABILITY SPACES?                 

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.610
VIOLATIONS ARE UNLAWFUL PARKING 
ABILITY SPACES?                 
SO IT JUST FELT LIKE A COMPLETE 

00:29:39.612 --> 00:29:39.943
ABILITY SPACES?                 
SO IT JUST FELT LIKE A COMPLETE 
AFTERTHOUGHT.                   

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:43.513
SO IT JUST FELT LIKE A COMPLETE 
AFTERTHOUGHT.                   
WHAT OUR MAIN CONCERN IS SO I&apos;M

AFTERTHOUGHT.                   
WHAT OUR MAIN CONCERN IS SO I&apos;M 
CURIOUS WAS ANY DATA GATHERED   

00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:47.217
WHAT OUR MAIN CONCERN IS SO I&apos;M 
CURIOUS WAS ANY DATA GATHERED   
AND I HAVE A FOLLOW QUESTION

DISABILITY COMMUNITY WERE A     

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:54.625
PARKING AND THE NEEDS OF THE    
DISABILITY COMMUNITY WERE A     
CONCERN.                        

00:29:54.627 --> 00:29:58.027
DISABILITY COMMUNITY WERE A     
CONCERN.                        
AGAIN, WE&apos;RE NOT INTERESTED IN

ENFORCEMENT AND REVENUE         
COLLECTION ON THIS BODY.        
YEAH, I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT&apos;S A

MAJOR CONCERN AND THINKING      
THROUGH THESE TRADE OFFS        

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:10.874
MAJOR CONCERN AND THINKING      
THROUGH THESE TRADE OFFS        
THERE&apos;S OFTEN A PUSH TO REMOVE  

00:30:10.876 --> 00:30:13.744
THROUGH THESE TRADE OFFS        
THERE&apos;S OFTEN A PUSH TO REMOVE  
PARKING BUT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN 

00:30:13.746 --> 00:30:17.448
THERE&apos;S OFTEN A PUSH TO REMOVE  
PARKING BUT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN 
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ADA        

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.084
PARKING BUT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN 
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ADA        
PARKING AND KEEP THOSE SPACES   

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:21.484
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ADA        
PARKING AND KEEP THOSE SPACES   
IN PLACE.                       

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.453
PARKING AND KEEP THOSE SPACES   
IN PLACE.                       
WE COLLECTED ONE OF THE STUDY   

00:30:22.455 --> 00:30:25.588
IN PLACE.                       
WE COLLECTED ONE OF THE STUDY   
AREAS WE DID COLLECT SOME DATA  

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.359
WE COLLECTED ONE OF THE STUDY   
AREAS WE DID COLLECT SOME DATA  
ON DIFFERENT ADA PARKING        

00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:28.758
AREAS WE DID COLLECT SOME DATA  
ON DIFFERENT ADA PARKING        
SPACES.                         

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.629
ON DIFFERENT ADA PARKING        
SPACES.                         
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE WEREN&apos;T LOOKING 

00:30:32.631 --> 00:30:36.532
SPACES.                         
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE WEREN&apos;T LOOKING 
SPECIFICALLY IF THE THE PARK    

00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:40.503
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE WEREN&apos;T LOOKING 
SPECIFICALLY IF THE THE PARK    
HAD A PLACARD BUT WE DID SOME   

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.204
SPECIFICALLY IF THE THE PARK    
HAD A PLACARD BUT WE DID SOME   
OBSERVATIONS AROUND THAT JUST   

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:44.641
HAD A PLACARD BUT WE DID SOME   
OBSERVATIONS AROUND THAT JUST   
BECAUSE THE CAMERA DATA CAN&apos;T   

00:30:44.643 --> 00:30:48.044
OBSERVATIONS AROUND THAT JUST   
BECAUSE THE CAMERA DATA CAN&apos;T   
AND CAN&apos;T SEE INSIDE THE        

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:48.311
BECAUSE THE CAMERA DATA CAN&apos;T   
AND CAN&apos;T SEE INSIDE THE        
VEHICLE.                        

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:49.512
AND CAN&apos;T SEE INSIDE THE        
VEHICLE.                        
&gt;&gt; SO WE DID SOME OBSERVATIONS  

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:52.849
VEHICLE.                        
&gt;&gt; SO WE DID SOME OBSERVATIONS  
AROUND PLACARDS AND USE BUT I   

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:55.852
&gt;&gt; SO WE DID SOME OBSERVATIONS  
AROUND PLACARDS AND USE BUT I   
THINK THAT&apos;S WHY WE&apos;RE HERE     

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:56.185
AROUND PLACARDS AND USE BUT I   
THINK THAT&apos;S WHY WE&apos;RE HERE     
TODAY.                          

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:59.489

TODAY.                          
THE STUDY IS NOT FINAL SO WE    

00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:00.223

THIS BODY IS ABOUT              
ACCESSIBILITY.                  
SO I THINK IT&apos;S VERY IMPORTANT  

00:31:53.212 --> 00:31:53.877
ACCESSIBILITY.                  
SO I THINK IT&apos;S VERY IMPORTANT  
THAT YOU RECENTER THE STUDY TO  

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:54.610
SO I THINK IT&apos;S VERY IMPORTANT  
THAT YOU RECENTER THE STUDY TO  
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR   

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:55.378
THAT YOU RECENTER THE STUDY TO  
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR   
NOT THAT IS ENOUGH SPACES ARE   

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.013
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR   
NOT THAT IS ENOUGH SPACES ARE   
PEOPLE PARKING UNLAWFULLY AND   

00:31:56.015 --> 00:31:56.679
NOT THAT IS ENOUGH SPACES ARE   
PEOPLE PARKING UNLAWFULLY AND   
BLOCKING DISABLED ACCESS        

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:57.414
PEOPLE PARKING UNLAWFULLY AND

BLOCKING DISABLED ACCESS        
THROUGH UNLAWFUL PARKING.       
HOW IS THAT ENFORCEMENT TAKING  

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.815
THROUGH UNLAWFUL PARKING.       
HOW IS THAT ENFORCEMENT TAKING  
PLACE, PEOPLE WITHOUT PLACARDS  

00:31:58.817 --> 00:31:59.615
HOW IS THAT ENFORCEMENT TAKING  
PLACE, PEOPLE WITHOUT PLACARDS  
AND THEN THE ISSUE OF WHETHER   

00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:00.750
PLACE, PEOPLE WITHOUT PLACARDS  
AND THEN THE ISSUE OF WHETHER   
BIKE LANES ARE NEGATIVELY       

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:01.551
AND THEN THE ISSUE OF WHETHER   
BIKE LANES ARE NEGATIVELY       
IMPACTING ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE 

00:32:01.553 --> 00:32:04.354
BIKE LANES ARE NEGATIVELY       
IMPACTING ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE 
DISABILITY COMMUNITY.           

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:05.221
IMPACTING ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE 
DISABILITY COMMUNITY.           
THOSE SHOULD BE DATA POINTS     

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:05.889
DISABILITY COMMUNITY.           
THOSE SHOULD BE DATA POINTS     
THAT ARE GENERATED BY THIS      

00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:08.325
THOSE SHOULD BE DATA POINTS     
THAT ARE GENERATED BY THIS

00:32:08.327 --> 00:32:08.859
THAT ARE GENERATED BY THIS      
STUDY.                          
THAT&apos;S MY PLEA.                 

00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:12.295
STUDY.                          
THAT&apos;S MY PLEA.                 
THAT&apos;S MY INSISTENCE.           

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:15.631
THAT&apos;S MY PLEA.                 
THAT&apos;S MY INSISTENCE.           
THIS IS JADA SPEAKING.          

00:32:15.633 --> 00:32:16.633
THAT&apos;S MY INSISTENCE.           
THIS IS JADA SPEAKING.          
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IT    

00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:19.435
THIS IS JADA SPEAKING.          
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IT    
CERTAINLY WAS NOT AN            

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:20.036
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IT    
CERTAINLY WAS NOT AN            
AFTERTHOUGHT ON OUR PART.       

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:21.204
CERTAINLY WAS NOT AN            
AFTERTHOUGHT ON OUR PART.       
AND ONE THING THAT WE LEARNED   

00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:24.074
AFTERTHOUGHT ON OUR PART.       
AND ONE THING THAT WE LEARNED   
THROUGH THIS STUDY IS THAT THE  

00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:27.710
AND ONE THING THAT WE LEARNED   
THROUGH THIS STUDY IS THAT THE  
DATA IS AS DIFFICULT TO COLLECT 

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:28.078
THROUGH THIS STUDY IS THAT THE  
DATA IS AS DIFFICULT TO COLLECT 
AND ANALYZE.                    

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.280
DATA IS AS DIFFICULT TO COLLECT 
AND ANALYZE.                    
WE HAD CAMERAS MOUNTED AND THEN 

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:31.981
AND ANALYZE.                    
WE HAD CAMERAS MOUNTED AND THEN 
FIRM TO ANALYZE THAT.           

00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:32.849
WE HAD CAMERAS MOUNTED AND THEN 
FIRM TO ANALYZE THAT.           
SO WE&apos;RE WORKING THROUGH        

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:35.819
FIRM TO ANALYZE THAT.           
SO WE&apos;RE WORKING THROUGH        
INTERNALLY KIND OF WHAT ARE     

00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:39.555
SO WE&apos;RE WORKING THROUGH        
INTERNALLY KIND OF WHAT ARE     
MEASUREMENTS, WHAT ARE DATA

INTERNALLY KIND OF WHAT ARE     
MEASUREMENTS, WHAT ARE DATA     
COLLECTION PROCESSES LOOK LIKE  

00:32:40.225 --> 00:32:42.258
MEASUREMENTS, WHAT ARE DATA     
COLLECTION PROCESSES LOOK LIKE  
SO WE CAN FINE TUNE IT A BIT    

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:42.658
COLLECTION PROCESSES LOOK LIKE  
SO WE CAN FINE TUNE IT A BIT    
MORE.                           

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.693
SO WE CAN FINE TUNE IT A BIT    
MORE.                           
BUT YOU KNOW, AS CHRISTINE      

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:46.696
MORE.                           
BUT YOU KNOW, AS CHRISTINE

IS SPILLING OVER INTO THINGS    

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:54.137
TERM USE OF THE CURVE WE KNOW   
IS SPILLING OVER INTO THINGS    
LIKE CROSSWALKS OR A.D.A SPACES
