AND HOLD FIRM IS THAT MONEY IF  
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT A SYSTEM IN 
THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE COMPLIANT  

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:45.961
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT A SYSTEM IN 
THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE COMPLIANT  
PER CODE AND IF THAT BECOMES A  

00:26:45.963 --> 00:26:46.695
THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE COMPLIANT  
PER CODE AND IF THAT BECOMES A  
HARDSHIP FOR MONEY THEN THEY    

00:26:46.697 --> 00:26:47.495
PER CODE AND IF THAT BECOMES A  
HARDSHIP FOR MONEY THEN THEY    
SHOULD HAVE WENT DOWN THE       

00:26:47.497 --> 00:26:50.165
HARDSHIP FOR MONEY THEN THEY    
SHOULD HAVE WENT DOWN THE       
AVENUE OF TRYING TO PUT THE     

00:26:50.167 --> 00:26:51.033
SHOULD HAVE WENT DOWN THE       
AVENUE OF TRYING TO PUT THE     
SYSTEM IN BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE 

00:26:51.035 --> 00:26:51.867
AVENUE OF TRYING TO PUT THE     
SYSTEM IN BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE 
CASE, ANYONE COULD TRY TO PUT A 

00:26:51.869 --> 00:26:53.602
SYSTEM IN BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE 
CASE, ANYONE COULD TRY TO PUT A 
SYSTEM TO A BUILDING AND SAY I  

00:26:53.604 --> 00:26:54.435
CASE, ANYONE COULD TRY TO PUT A 
SYSTEM TO A BUILDING AND SAY I  
DON'T NEED TO DO IT SO I'M      

00:26:54.437 --> 00:26:54.936
SYSTEM TO A BUILDING AND SAY I  
DON'T NEED TO DO IT SO I'M      
GOING TO DO IT.

DON'T NEED TO DO IT SO I'M      
GOING TO DO IT.                 
I'M GOING TO DO IT MY WAY.      

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.006
GOING TO DO IT.                 
I'M GOING TO DO IT MY WAY.      
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT A     

00:26:58.008 --> 00:26:58.740
I'M GOING TO DO IT MY WAY.      
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT A     
SYSTEM IN IT SHOULD FOLLOW THE  

00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:00.876
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT A     
SYSTEM IN IT SHOULD FOLLOW THE  
CODE PATH TO MAKE SURE THE      

00:27:00.878 --> 00:27:01.910
SYSTEM IN IT SHOULD FOLLOW THE

SYSTEM IS DONE TO THE CURRENT   
CODES.                          
SO DO WE HAVE JURISDICTION OR

DIRECTLY FROM THE BUILDING      

00:48:41.143 --> 00:48:44.811
LOOKING FOR RELIEF FROM         
DIRECTLY FROM THE BUILDING      
CODE OR THE FIRE CODE , I DON'T

DIRECTLY FROM THE BUILDING      
CODE OR THE FIRE CODE , I DON'T 
BELIEVE THIS IS THE GROUP TO TO

CODE OR THE FIRE CODE , I DON'T 
BELIEVE THIS IS THE GROUP TO TO 
PROVIDE THAT FROM WHAT JOHN     

00:48:48.884 --> 00:48:52.185
BELIEVE THIS IS THE GROUP TO TO 
PROVIDE THAT FROM WHAT JOHN     
PROVIDED IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT     

00:48:52.187 --> 00:48:53.087
PROVIDE THAT FROM WHAT JOHN     
PROVIDED IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT     
REQUESTING IS A IS A VARIANCE   

00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:56.390
PROVIDED IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT     
REQUESTING IS A IS A VARIANCE   
FROM A CITY STANDARD AND        

00:48:56.392 --> 00:48:57.190
REQUESTING IS A IS A VARIANCE   
FROM A CITY STANDARD AND        
THERE'S A DIFFERENT AVENUE FOR  

00:48:57.192 --> 00:48:57.525
FROM A CITY STANDARD AND        
THERE'S A DIFFERENT AVENUE FOR  
THAT.                           

00:48:57.527 --> 00:49:00.660
THERE'S A DIFFERENT AVENUE FOR  
THAT.                           
I THINK THAT THIS BOARD WAS     

00:49:00.662 --> 00:49:01.462
THAT.                           
I THINK THAT THIS BOARD WAS     
GOING TO MAKE A DECISION THEY   

00:49:01.464 --> 00:49:04.364
I THINK THAT THIS BOARD WAS     
GOING TO MAKE A DECISION THEY   
WOULD BASE THE SPECIFIC         

00:49:04.366 --> 00:49:05.298
GOING TO MAKE A DECISION THEY   
WOULD BASE THE SPECIFIC         
CODE SECTIONS FROM THE IFC THAT 

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.834
WOULD BASE THE SPECIFIC         
CODE SECTIONS FROM THE IFC THAT 
YOU PROVIDED AND THEN THEY      

00:49:07.836 --> 00:49:08.668
CODE SECTIONS FROM THE IFC THAT 
YOU PROVIDED AND THEN THEY      
COULD, YOU KNOW, WEIGH IN       

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:11.839
YOU PROVIDED AND THEN THEY      
COULD, YOU KNOW, WEIGH IN       
WHETHER THEY APPROVE THOSE OR   

00:49:11.841 --> 00:49:12.106
COULD, YOU KNOW, WEIGH IN       
WHETHER THEY APPROVE THOSE OR   
NOT.                            

00:49:12.108 --> 00:49:15.308
WHETHER THEY APPROVE THOSE OR   
NOT.                            
BUT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE  

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:16.477
NOT.                            
BUT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE  
WHAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO   

00:49:16.479 --> 00:49:20.080
BUT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE  
WHAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO   
WOULD A SIMILAR I GUESS A       

00:49:20.082 --> 00:49:23.317
WHAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO   
WOULD A SIMILAR I GUESS A       
SIMPLER OR AT LEAST MORE TIME   

00:49:23.319 --> 00:49:24.184
WOULD A SIMILAR I GUESS A       
SIMPLER OR AT LEAST MORE TIME   
EFFECTIVE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO  

00:49:24.186 --> 00:49:27.954
SIMPLER OR AT LEAST MORE TIME   
EFFECTIVE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO  
AMEND THE VARIANCE REQUEST TO   

00:49:27.956 --> 00:49:30.724
EFFECTIVE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO  
AMEND THE VARIANCE REQUEST TO   
THE PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM.   

00:49:30.726 --> 00:49:31.958
AMEND THE VARIANCE REQUEST TO   
THE PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM.   
NOW SINCE ALL OF THE ITEMS ARE  

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.995
THE PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM.   
NOW SINCE ALL OF THE ITEMS ARE  
ALREADY IN UNSUPPRESSED, WE     

00:49:34.997 --> 00:49:38.165
NOW SINCE ALL OF THE ITEMS ARE

JUST NEED THE WATER TAP INTO IT 

00:49:38.167 --> 00:49:39.166
ALREADY IN UNSUPPRESSED, WE     
JUST NEED THE WATER TAP INTO IT 
AND THAT COULD BE AND IT WOULD  

00:49:39.168 --> 00:49:42.636
JUST NEED THE WATER TAP INTO IT 
AND THAT COULD BE AND IT WOULD  
BE A BUILDING CODE MOVEMENT AND 

00:49:42.638 --> 00:49:43.470

AND I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT    
FOR SURE AND I GUESS I WOULD    

00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:42.922
AND I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT    
FOR SURE AND I GUESS I WOULD    
TALK WITH HIM AND YOU GUYS TOO. 

00:51:42.924 --> 00:51:43.991
FOR SURE AND I GUESS I WOULD    
TALK WITH HIM AND YOU GUYS TOO. 
AND I DON'T KNOW THE OPTIONS    

00:51:43.993 --> 00:51:45.592
TALK WITH HIM AND YOU GUYS TOO. 
AND I DON'T KNOW THE OPTIONS    
OF THIS BUT I WAS UNDER THE     

00:51:45.594 --> 00:51:46.260
AND I DON'T KNOW THE OPTIONS    
OF THIS BUT I WAS UNDER THE     
IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS A NFPA   

00:51:46.262 --> 00:51:49.129
OF THIS BUT I WAS UNDER THE     
IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS A NFPA   
13 SYSTEM ALSO.                 

00:51:49.131 --> 00:51:50.130
IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS A NFPA   
13 SYSTEM ALSO.                 
THAT'S WHY THE ONE HUNDRED FOOT 

00:51:50.132 --> 00:51:51.064
13 SYSTEM ALSO.                 
THAT'S WHY THE ONE HUNDRED FOOT 
WAS BEING MUCH AND NOT THE ONE  

00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:53.566
THAT'S WHY THE ONE HUNDRED FOOT 
WAS BEING MUCH AND NOT THE ONE  
FIFTY WHILE YOU'RE STILL SHORT. 

00:51:53.568 --> 00:51:56.970
WAS BEING MUCH AND NOT THE ONE  
FIFTY WHILE YOU'RE STILL SHORT. 
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS       

00:51:56.972 --> 00:51:57.705
FIFTY WHILE YOU'RE STILL SHORT. 
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS       
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE YOU'RE      

00:51:57.707 --> 00:51:58.372
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS       
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE YOU'RE      
PUTTING SUPPRESSION IN THE      

00:51:58.374 --> 00:52:00.974
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE YOU'RE      
PUTTING SUPPRESSION IN THE      
LOWER LEVEL THAT'S ACTUALLY     

00:52:00.976 --> 00:52:01.675
PUTTING SUPPRESSION IN THE      
LOWER LEVEL THAT'S ACTUALLY     
RETAIL AND A THIRTEEN R         

00:52:01.677 --> 00:52:03.810
LOWER LEVEL THAT'S ACTUALLY     
RETAIL AND A THIRTEEN R         
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO IN THERE 

00:52:03.812 --> 00:52:04.011
RETAIL AND A THIRTEEN R         
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO IN THERE 
.                               

00:52:04.013 --> 00:52:04.878
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO IN THERE 
.                               
SO THAT'S PROBABLY ANOTHER      

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.683
.                               
SO THAT'S PROBABLY ANOTHER      
REASON YOU'D WANT TO LOOK AT A  

00:52:09.685 --> 00:52:10.417
SO THAT'S PROBABLY ANOTHER      
REASON YOU'D WANT TO LOOK AT A  
PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM.       

00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:12.686
REASON YOU'D WANT TO LOOK AT A  
PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM.       
>> THERE'S REALLY AN EXISTING   

00:52:12.688 --> 00:52:13.287
PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM.       
>> THERE'S REALLY AN EXISTING   
SYSTEM IN THE FIRST FLOOR       

00:52:13.289 --> 00:52:13.954
>> THERE'S REALLY AN EXISTING   
SYSTEM IN THE FIRST FLOOR       
THAT'S THE BIVOUAC CLOTHING.    

00:52:13.956 --> 00:52:16.890
SYSTEM IN THE FIRST FLOOR       
THAT'S THE BIVOUAC CLOTHING.    
>> OH SO YOU HAVE AN EXISTING   

00:52:16.892 --> 00:52:17.558
THAT'S THE BIVOUAC CLOTHING.    
>> OH SO YOU HAVE AN EXISTING   
SYSTEM AND YOU'RE NOT CHANGING  

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.660
>> OH SO YOU HAVE AN EXISTING   
SYSTEM AND YOU'RE NOT CHANGING  
THAT YOU'RE MAYBE TIED INTO IT. 

00:52:20.662 --> 00:52:21.494
SYSTEM AND YOU'RE NOT CHANGING  
THAT YOU'RE MAYBE TIED INTO IT. 
IT WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT OR     

00:52:21.496 --> 00:52:22.129
THAT YOU'RE MAYBE TIED INTO IT. 
IT WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT OR     
THEY SEPARATE SYSTEM BECAUSE    

00:52:22.131 --> 00:52:24.264
IT WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT OR     
THEY SEPARATE SYSTEM BECAUSE    
SEPARATE SYSTEM, SEPARATE       

00:52:24.266 --> 00:52:24.998
THEY SEPARATE SYSTEM BECAUSE    
SEPARATE SYSTEM, SEPARATE       
SYSTEMS AND WE'RE GOING TO THE  

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:25.932
SEPARATE SYSTEM, SEPARATE       
SYSTEMS AND WE'RE GOING TO THE  
THIRD SO SO DO YOU HAVE THAT    

00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:27.735
SYSTEMS AND WE'RE GOING TO THE  
THIRD SO SO DO YOU HAVE THAT    
THEY HAVE THE TYPICAL BASEMENT  

00:52:27.737 --> 00:52:31.638
THIRD SO SO DO YOU HAVE THAT    
THEY HAVE THE TYPICAL BASEMENT  
PARTIAL FLOOR BECAUSE THEY      

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.306
THEY HAVE THE TYPICAL BASEMENT  
PARTIAL FLOOR BECAUSE THEY      
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ALREADY       

00:52:32.308 --> 00:52:32.773
PARTIAL FLOOR BECAUSE THEY      
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ALREADY       
EXISTING FOR THAT.              

00:52:32.775 --> 00:52:35.642
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ALREADY       
EXISTING FOR THAT.              
THAT WAS A LOT A LOT OF THE     

00:52:35.644 --> 00:52:36.176
EXISTING FOR THAT.              
THAT WAS A LOT A LOT OF THE     
DOWNTOWN HAD A LIMITED          

00:52:36.178 --> 00:52:39.245
THAT WAS A LOT A LOT OF THE     
DOWNTOWN HAD A LIMITED          
SPRINKLER HEAD SYSTEM.          

00:52:39.247 --> 00:52:40.313
DOWNTOWN HAD A LIMITED          
SPRINKLER HEAD SYSTEM.          
WHAT IT IS IT'S A LIMITED AREA  

00:52:40.315 --> 00:52:40.581

IT'S ACTUALLY A LIMITED AREA    
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.             
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY JUST         

00:52:44.186 --> 00:52:44.852
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.             
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY JUST         
SPRINKLING THE THIRD FLOOR.     

00:52:44.854 --> 00:52:47.087
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY JUST         
SPRINKLING THE THIRD FLOOR.     
IT'S REALLY WITH THE NEW SYSTEM 

00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.287
SPRINKLING THE THIRD FLOOR.     
IT'S REALLY WITH THE NEW SYSTEM

DECREASED AMOUNT AT THAT POINT. 
SO IT IS KIND OF A A SMALLER    
AMOUNT BUT THE OTHER OPTION     

00:54:51.546 --> 00:54:52.279
SO IT IS KIND OF A A SMALLER    
AMOUNT BUT THE OTHER OPTION     
WOULD BE IF YOU HAD SOMEONE IN  

00:54:52.281 --> 00:54:53.012

WOULD BE IF YOU HAD SOMEONE IN  
MIND THIS IS FAMILIAR WITH      

00:54:53.014 --> 00:54:53.680
WOULD BE IF YOU HAD SOMEONE IN  
MIND THIS IS FAMILIAR WITH      
PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM THAT   

00:54:53.682 --> 00:54:54.214
MIND THIS IS FAMILIAR WITH      
PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM THAT   
THEY COULD UTILIZE A

PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM THAT   
THEY COULD UTILIZE A            
PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM        

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:55.649
THEY COULD UTILIZE A            
PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM        
ENGINEERING IT TO WHAT YOU HAVE 

00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:56.316
PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM        
ENGINEERING IT TO WHAT YOU HAVE 
IN PLACE MAYBE MINUS THE FDC    

00:54:56.318 --> 00:54:57.184

I THINK THAT WOULD FALL BACK IN 
YOUR HANDS.

BUT A PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM  
IS STILL ONCE AGAIN IT'S NOT A

SO IF A PERFORMANCE BASED       
ENGINEER SAYS I'VE DESIGNED     

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.367
SO IF A PERFORMANCE BASED

00:57:10.952 --> 00:57:13.219
FOLLOWED.                       
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S LOOKING AT   
THAT SUNSET WHEN YOU SEE THEM   

00:57:13.221 --> 00:57:13.886
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S LOOKING AT   
THAT SUNSET WHEN YOU SEE THEM   
STANDARDS THEY HAVE BEEN        

00:57:13.888 --> 00:57:17.390
THAT SUNSET WHEN YOU SEE THEM   
STANDARDS THEY HAVE BEEN        
FOLLOWED TO A T RIGHT.          

00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:18.191

JUST TO PUSH IT OUT EVEN THOUGH 
IT MAY NOT BE NEEDED OR BE USED
