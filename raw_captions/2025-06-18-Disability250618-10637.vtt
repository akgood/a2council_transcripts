00:32:30.565 --> 00:32:31.297
AND WHAT WE HAD IN MIND AS WE   
FOCUSED ON THIS PROJECT.        
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A      

00:32:31.299 --> 00:32:31.965
FOCUSED ON THIS PROJECT.        
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A      
REASON FOR THAT EVERYBODY ELSE  

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:33.233
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A      
REASON FOR THAT EVERYBODY ELSE  
SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS    

00:32:33.235 --> 00:32:37.537
REASON FOR THAT EVERYBODY ELSE

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:43.943
THERE'S A INTENSIFIES RISING    
DEMAND FOR SERVICES THE NUMBER  
OF STUDENTS WHO ARE SERVED      

00:32:43.945 --> 00:32:44.777
DEMAND FOR SERVICES THE NUMBER  
OF STUDENTS WHO ARE SERVED

FEW YEARS.                      

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.855
MILLION TO SEVEN MILLION JUST A 
FEW YEARS.                      
WE SEE AN IMPACT STUDENT        

00:32:55.857 --> 00:33:00.360
FEW YEARS.                      
WE SEE AN IMPACT STUDENT        
ACTIVITIES JUST A FEW YEARS AGO 

00:33:00.362 --> 00:33:01.027
WE SEE AN IMPACT STUDENT        
ACTIVITIES JUST A FEW YEARS AGO 
THERE WAS A SIX HUNDRED AND     

00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.694

THERE WAS A SIX HUNDRED AND     
FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR       

00:33:01.696 --> 00:33:04.164
THERE WAS A SIX HUNDRED AND     
FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR       
SHORTFALL WHICH LEFT ONLY       

00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:04.898
FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR       
SHORTFALL WHICH LEFT ONLY       
EIGHTY POINT SEVEN PERCENT      

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.499
SHORTFALL WHICH LEFT ONLY       
EIGHTY POINT SEVEN PERCENT

SO THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT THAT IS 

00:33:08.536 --> 00:33:11.604

SO THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT THAT IS 
STILL JUST UNCOVERED AND A LACK

00:33:35.964 --> 00:33:39.533
RESOURCES WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO  
TRAIN THEM AND THEY ARE LEFT    
UNPREPARED AND THEN ALSO AS     

00:33:39.535 --> 00:33:40.266
TRAIN THEM AND THEY ARE LEFT    
UNPREPARED AND THEN ALSO AS     
WE'VE SAID, THEIR EQUITY FOR    

00:33:40.268 --> 00:33:40.733
UNPREPARED AND THEN ALSO AS     
WE'VE SAID, THEIR EQUITY FOR    
ALL STUDENTS.                   

00:33:40.735 --> 00:33:42.502
WE'VE SAID, THEIR EQUITY FOR    
ALL STUDENTS.                   
I HOPE THAT WE ALL WE ALL       

00:33:42.504 --> 00:33:43.203
ALL STUDENTS.                   
I HOPE THAT WE ALL WE ALL       
BELIEVE IN EQUITY AND THAT'S    

00:33:43.205 --> 00:33:43.936
I HOPE THAT WE ALL WE ALL       
BELIEVE IN EQUITY AND THAT'S    
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO       

00:33:43.938 --> 00:33:46.073
BELIEVE IN EQUITY AND THAT'S    
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO       
STRIVE FOR.                     

00:33:46.075 --> 00:33:47.007
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO       
STRIVE FOR.                     
AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  

00:33:47.009 --> 00:33:47.773
STRIVE FOR.                     
AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  
HAD A DROPOUT RATE OF TWELVE    

00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:50.177
AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  
HAD A DROPOUT RATE OF TWELVE    
POINT ONE PERCENT COMPARED TO   

00:33:50.179 --> 00:33:50.844
HAD A DROPOUT RATE OF TWELVE    
POINT ONE PERCENT COMPARED TO   
FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR PEERS     

00:33:50.846 --> 00:33:51.444
POINT ONE PERCENT COMPARED TO   
FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR PEERS     
WITHOUT DISABILITIES.           

00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:55.948
FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR PEERS     
WITHOUT DISABILITIES.           
SO THAT'S A HUGE EQUITY         

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.383
WITHOUT DISABILITIES.           
SO THAT'S A HUGE EQUITY         
DISCREPANCY.                    

00:33:56.385 --> 00:34:01.088
SO THAT'S A HUGE EQUITY         
DISCREPANCY.                    
SO THIS IS WHY I THINK THAT THE 

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.323
DISCREPANCY.                    
SO THIS IS WHY I THINK THAT THE 
ISSUE IS VERY URGENT AND WHY    

00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:05.024
SO THIS IS WHY I THINK THAT THE 
ISSUE IS VERY URGENT AND WHY    
MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE REALLY    

00:34:05.026 --> 00:34:05.492
ISSUE IS VERY URGENT AND WHY    
MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE REALLY    
FOCUSING ON THIS.               

00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:08.561
MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE REALLY    
FOCUSING ON THIS.               
>> SO WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

FOCUSING ON THIS.               
>> SO WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
WHAT WE WANTED TO DO, I THINK   

00:34:09.331 --> 00:34:10.063

WHAT WE WANTED TO DO, I THINK   
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS YOU    

00:34:10.065 --> 00:34:11.531
WHAT WE WANTED TO DO, I THINK   
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS YOU    
CAN DO ULTIMATELY LIKE JUST     

00:34:11.533 --> 00:34:15.202
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS YOU    
CAN DO ULTIMATELY LIKE JUST     
SAYING WE WANT MORE MONEY IS    

00:34:15.204 --> 00:34:15.869
CAN DO ULTIMATELY LIKE JUST     
SAYING WE WANT MORE MONEY IS    
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.            

00:34:15.871 --> 00:34:16.969
SAYING WE WANT MORE MONEY IS    
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.            
SO WE DECIDED THAT THE MOST     

00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:20.040
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.            
SO WE DECIDED THAT THE MOST     
PRACTICAL IT CAN DO IS JUST     

00:34:20.042 --> 00:34:20.773
SO WE DECIDED THAT THE MOST     
PRACTICAL IT CAN DO IS JUST     
ESTABLISH AN ADVOCACY GROUP TO  

00:34:20.775 --> 00:34:23.443
PRACTICAL IT CAN DO IS JUST     
ESTABLISH AN ADVOCACY GROUP TO  
AMPLIFY VOICES AND DRIVE        

00:34:23.445 --> 00:34:23.843
ESTABLISH AN ADVOCACY GROUP TO

SUPPORTIVE SPACE FOR PARENTS TO 
FEEL HEARD AND CONNECT WITH     

00:34:42.397 --> 00:34:43.130
SUPPORTIVE SPACE FOR PARENTS TO

OF THIS WOULD WOULD BOTH BE     

00:34:50.305 --> 00:34:50.970
SOLUTIONS TO THE STRUCTURE      
OF THIS WOULD WOULD BOTH BE     
MONTHLY IN-PERSON MEETINGS      

00:34:50.972 --> 00:34:54.440
OF THIS WOULD WOULD BOTH BE     
MONTHLY IN-PERSON MEETINGS      
WHERE THEY CAN EACH OTHER       

00:34:54.442 --> 00:34:55.374
MONTHLY IN-PERSON MEETINGS      
WHERE THEY CAN EACH OTHER       
FACE-TO-FACE AND TALK ABOUT IT

IDENTIFY KEY CONTEXT FOR        

00:35:05.486 --> 00:35:05.818

IDENTIFY KEY CONTEXT FOR        
ADVOCACY.                       

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.619
IDENTIFY KEY CONTEXT FOR        
ADVOCACY.                       
I THINK OFTENTIMES PARENTS FEEL 

00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:09.989
ADVOCACY.                       
I THINK OFTENTIMES PARENTS FEEL 
LIKE AN FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE     

00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:12.792
I THINK OFTENTIMES PARENTS FEEL 
LIKE AN FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE     
SOMETHING TO SAY THEY DON'T     

00:35:12.794 --> 00:35:13.659
LIKE AN FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE     
SOMETHING TO SAY THEY DON'T     
KNOW HOW TO DIRECT IT TO.       

00:35:13.661 --> 00:35:14.461
SOMETHING TO SAY THEY DON'T     
KNOW HOW TO DIRECT IT TO.       
THEY FEEL FRUSTRATED BY THE     

00:35:14.463 --> 00:35:17.130
KNOW HOW TO DIRECT IT TO.       
THEY FEEL FRUSTRATED BY THE     
SYSTEM AND WHERE TO GO NEXT.    

00:35:17.132 --> 00:35:18.231
THEY FEEL FRUSTRATED BY THE     
SYSTEM AND WHERE TO GO NEXT.    
SO I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE A 

00:35:18.233 --> 00:35:20.967
SYSTEM AND WHERE TO GO NEXT.    
SO I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE A 
REALLY GOOD PLACE WHERE THEY

SO I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE A 
REALLY GOOD PLACE WHERE THEY    
CAN FIND THAT SUPPORT TO JUST   

00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:22.368
REALLY GOOD PLACE WHERE THEY    
CAN FIND THAT SUPPORT TO JUST   
CONTINUE GOING CONTINUE
