FACT THAT THE RABBI AT THE TIME 
SAID THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN  
OPPOSITIONAL PRESENTATION AT    

00:45:40.014 --> 00:45:42.415
SAID THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN  
OPPOSITIONAL PRESENTATION AT    
THE SAME TIME I THINK IT WOULD  

00:45:42.417 --> 00:45:43.282
OPPOSITIONAL PRESENTATION AT    
THE SAME TIME I THINK IT WOULD  
HAVE BEEN FAIR TO JUST LET HIM

THE SAME TIME I THINK IT WOULD  
HAVE BEEN FAIR TO JUST LET HIM  
GO UP THERE, GIVE HIS POWER     

00:45:46.353 --> 00:45:47.219
HAVE BEEN FAIR TO JUST LET HIM  
GO UP THERE, GIVE HIS POWER     
POINTS IN THE PAST SIX YEARS    

00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:50.055
GO UP THERE, GIVE HIS POWER     
POINTS IN THE PAST SIX YEARS    
OF MISERY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN   

00:45:50.057 --> 00:45:50.456
POINTS IN THE PAST SIX YEARS    
OF MISERY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN   
EXPERIENCED.                    

00:45:50.458 --> 00:45:53.525
OF MISERY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN   
EXPERIENCED.                    
I I RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS REALLY 

00:45:53.527 --> 00:45:54.426
EXPERIENCED.                    
I I RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS REALLY 
HORRIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO WALK     

00:45:54.428 --> 00:45:55.160
I I RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS REALLY 
HORRIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO WALK     
INTO A TEMPLE AND HAVE TO GO    

00:45:55.162 --> 00:45:57.229
HORRIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO WALK     
INTO A TEMPLE AND HAVE TO GO    
THROUGH THOSE PROTESTERS BUT I  

00:45:57.231 --> 00:45:58.030
INTO A TEMPLE AND HAVE TO GO    
THROUGH THOSE PROTESTERS BUT I  
DON&amp;apos;T THINK IT&amp;apos;S AS HORRIBLE AS 

00:45:58.032 --> 00:45:58.664
THROUGH THOSE PROTESTERS BUT I  
DON&amp;apos;T THINK IT&amp;apos;S AS HORRIBLE AS 
WHAT&amp;apos;S HAPPENED IN THE PAST     

00:45:58.666 --> 00:46:01.533
DON&amp;apos;T THINK IT&amp;apos;S AS HORRIBLE AS 
WHAT&amp;apos;S HAPPENED IN THE PAST     
WEEK WHEN PALESTINIANS AT THE   

00:46:01.535 --> 00:46:04.803
WHAT&amp;apos;S HAPPENED IN THE PAST     
WEEK WHEN PALESTINIANS AT THE   
TEMPLE MOUNT WERE KILLED SIX    

00:46:04.805 --> 00:46:05.371
WEEK WHEN PALESTINIANS AT THE   
TEMPLE MOUNT WERE KILLED SIX    
SEVEN WERE KILLED.              

00:46:05.373 --> 00:46:08.907
TEMPLE MOUNT WERE KILLED SIX    
SEVEN WERE KILLED.              
A LITTLE BOY WAS HURT BY        

00:46:08.909 --> 00:46:09.541
SEVEN WERE KILLED.              
A LITTLE BOY WAS HURT BY        
POLICEMEN AND BY JEWISH         

00:46:09.543 --> 00:46:09.875
A LITTLE BOY WAS HURT BY        
POLICEMEN AND BY JEWISH         
SETTLERS.                       

00:46:09.877 --> 00:46:12.745
POLICEMEN AND BY JEWISH         
SETTLERS.

00:46:12.747 --> 00:46:13.479
SETTLERS.                       
SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A      
WORSE EXPERIENCE THAN JUST      

00:46:13.481 --> 00:46:14.379
SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A      
WORSE EXPERIENCE THAN JUST      
HAVING TO WALK BY PEOPLE WITH   

00:46:14.381 --> 00:46:15.981
WORSE EXPERIENCE THAN JUST      
HAVING TO WALK BY PEOPLE WITH   
SIGNS.                          

00:46:15.983 --> 00:46:17.149
