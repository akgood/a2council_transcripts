SO YOU KNOW OVER PROBABLY OVER  
TEN YEARS AGO AT THIS POINT     

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.784
SO YOU KNOW OVER PROBABLY OVER  
TEN YEARS AGO AT THIS POINT     
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF THE   

00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:11.618
TEN YEARS AGO AT THIS POINT     
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF THE   
BODY AT THE TIME TO ESTABLISH   

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.353
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF THE   
BODY AT THE TIME TO ESTABLISH   
SOME SORT OF A FORMULA FOR THIS 

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:14.455
BODY AT THE TIME TO ESTABLISH   
SOME SORT OF A FORMULA FOR THIS 
TO AVOID KIND OF AN AD HOC

SOME SORT OF A FORMULA FOR THIS 
TO AVOID KIND OF AN AD HOC      
DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND     

00:05:17.726 --> 00:05:18.659
TO AVOID KIND OF AN AD HOC      
DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND     
WHAT THEY SETTLED ON WAS A      

00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:22.363
DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND     
WHAT THEY SETTLED ON WAS A      
MIXTURE OF METRICS ON PAGE TWO  

00:05:22.365 --> 00:05:25.599
WHAT THEY SETTLED ON WAS A      
MIXTURE OF METRICS ON PAGE TWO  
OF THE HANDWROTE YOU HAVE TO    

00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:26.633
MIXTURE OF METRICS ON PAGE TWO  
OF THE HANDWROTE YOU HAVE TO    
HAVE THEM LISTED AT THE TOP SO  

00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:29.537
OF THE HANDWROTE YOU HAVE TO    
HAVE THEM LISTED AT THE TOP SO  
IT IS LOOKING BACKWARDS BECAUSE 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:30.404
HAVE THEM LISTED AT THE TOP SO  
IT IS LOOKING BACKWARDS BECAUSE 
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE DATA   

00:05:30.406 --> 00:05:32.607
IT IS LOOKING BACKWARDS BECAUSE 
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE DATA   
FOR THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS THE  

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:33.607
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE DATA   
FOR THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS THE  
TWELVE MONTH CHANGE IN CPI FOR  

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:37.345
FOR THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS THE  
TWELVE MONTH CHANGE IN CPI FOR  
EACH YEAR AND THEN THE PERCENT  

00:05:37.347 --> 00:05:37.945
TWELVE MONTH CHANGE IN CPI FOR  
EACH YEAR AND THEN THE PERCENT  
CHANGE FOR CITY NONUNION        

00:05:37.947 --> 00:05:40.981
EACH YEAR AND THEN THE PERCENT  
CHANGE FOR CITY NONUNION        
EMPLOYEES EACH YEAR.            

00:05:40.983 --> 00:05:42.082
CHANGE FOR CITY NONUNION        
EMPLOYEES EACH YEAR.            
SO TAKING AN AVERAGE OF ALL     

00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:45.152
EMPLOYEES EACH YEAR.            
SO TAKING AN AVERAGE OF ALL     
OF THAT IT'S A ROUGH ESTIMATE   

00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:45.786
SO TAKING AN AVERAGE OF ALL     
OF THAT IT'S A ROUGH ESTIMATE   
OF THE ANNUAL CHANGE IN         

00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:49.390
OF THAT IT'S A ROUGH ESTIMATE   
OF THE ANNUAL CHANGE IN         
SALARIES OVER THE PAST SORRY    

00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:52.426
OF THE ANNUAL CHANGE IN         
SALARIES OVER THE PAST SORRY    
ANNUAL CHANGE IN COST OF LIVING 

00:05:52.428 --> 00:05:53.361
SALARIES OVER THE PAST SORRY    
ANNUAL CHANGE IN COST OF LIVING 
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND     

00:05:53.363 --> 00:05:56.630
ANNUAL CHANGE IN COST OF LIVING 
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND     
THEN TO APPLY THAT              

00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:57.097
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND     
THEN TO APPLY THAT              
PROSPECTIVELY.                  

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.068
THEN TO APPLY THAT              
PROSPECTIVELY.                  
SO LOOK, LOOKING BACK YOU CAN   

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.936
PROSPECTIVELY.                  
SO LOOK, LOOKING BACK YOU CAN   
SEE THAT THE NUMBERS WERE RIGHT 

00:06:01.938 --> 00:06:02.469
SO LOOK, LOOKING BACK YOU CAN   
SEE THAT THE NUMBERS WERE RIGHT 
AROUND THREE PERCENT FOR        

00:06:02.471 --> 00:06:04.405
SEE THAT THE NUMBERS WERE RIGHT 
AROUND THREE PERCENT FOR        
EVERYTHING, TWO POINT NINE FOR  

00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:05.339
AROUND THREE PERCENT FOR        
EVERYTHING, TWO POINT NINE FOR  
THE CPI AND THIS IS MEASURED ON 

00:06:05.341 --> 00:06:08.175
EVERYTHING, TWO POINT NINE FOR  
THE CPI AND THIS IS MEASURED ON 
OUR FISCAL YEARS OF JULY TO     

00:06:08.177 --> 00:06:09.109
THE CPI AND THIS IS MEASURED ON 
OUR FISCAL YEARS OF JULY TO     
JULY TWO POINT NINE TWO POINT   

00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:12.446
OUR FISCAL YEARS OF JULY TO     
JULY TWO POINT NINE TWO POINT   
SEVEN FOR THE CPI CHANGE AND    

00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:16.116
JULY TWO POINT NINE TWO POINT   
SEVEN FOR THE CPI CHANGE AND    
THEN THREE PERCENT EACH YEAR    

00:06:16.118 --> 00:06:19.586
SEVEN FOR THE CPI CHANGE AND    
THEN THREE PERCENT EACH YEAR    
FOR CITY NON UNION WAGE.        

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:24.558
THEN THREE PERCENT EACH YEAR    
FOR CITY NON UNION WAGE.        
SO THE AVERAGE BEING TWO POINT  

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.092
FOR CITY NON UNION WAGE.        
SO THE AVERAGE BEING TWO POINT  
NINE OF THE FOURTH.             

00:06:25.094 --> 00:06:28.095
SO THE AVERAGE BEING TWO POINT  
NINE OF THE FOURTH.             
SO JUST TAKING THAT AVERAGE AND 

00:06:28.097 --> 00:06:28.829
NINE OF THE FOURTH.             
SO JUST TAKING THAT AVERAGE AND 
APPLYING IT GOING FORWARD FOR   

00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:29.530
SO JUST TAKING THAT AVERAGE AND 
APPLYING IT GOING FORWARD FOR   
TWO YEARS IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW,   

00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:32.199
APPLYING IT GOING FORWARD FOR   
TWO YEARS IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW,   
COMPLETELY PRECISE IN ANY WAY   

00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:33.067
TWO YEARS IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW,   
COMPLETELY PRECISE IN ANY WAY   
EXCEPT THAT IT KIND OF REFLECTS

LOOKING LOOKING BACKWARDS AND   
THE OTHER THE OTHER PART        

00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:43.644
LOOKING LOOKING BACKWARDS AND   
THE OTHER THE OTHER PART        
OF THAT WAS THAT WE PERCEIVE    

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:46.713
THE OTHER THE OTHER PART        
OF THAT WAS THAT WE PERCEIVE    
THAT EVEN WITH THE CALCULATIONS 

00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:47.514
OF THAT WAS THAT WE PERCEIVE    
THAT EVEN WITH THE CALCULATIONS 
THAT WE WERE RELATIVELY         

00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:48.215
THAT EVEN WITH THE CALCULATIONS 
THAT WE WERE RELATIVELY

THAT WE WERE RELATIVELY         
SATISFIED WITH THE METRICS WE   
HAD CHOSEN JUST BECAUSE THE WAY 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.952
SATISFIED WITH THE METRICS WE   
HAD CHOSEN JUST BECAUSE THE WAY 
THAT THE MATH WORKS WE WERE     

00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:54.622
HAD CHOSEN JUST BECAUSE THE WAY 
THAT THE MATH WORKS WE WERE     
ACTUALLY CREATING AN INCREASING 

00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:58.859
THAT THE MATH WORKS WE WERE     
ACTUALLY CREATING AN INCREASING 
DIVIDE RATHER THAN A DECREASING 

00:06:58.861 --> 00:06:59.660
ACTUALLY CREATING AN INCREASING

AND THE COUNCIL NO SALARY AND   

00:07:02.398 --> 00:07:06.000
DIVIDE BETWEEN THE MAYOR SALARY

AND THE COUNCIL NO SALARY AND   
WE FELT THAT IS THAT AMOUNT     
OF WORK REFLECTED IN THE POLLS

OBSERVATION ABOUT HOW MUCH      
ENERGY GOES INTO DOING THIS     

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:21.082
OBSERVATION ABOUT HOW MUCH      
ENERGY GOES INTO DOING THIS     
JOB, WE FELT THAT EVEN          

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.964
                       THE

COMING FROM BUT I DO THINK THAT 
THE WORK THAT CITY COUNCIL      

00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:10.984
COMING FROM BUT I DO THINK THAT 
THE WORK THAT CITY COUNCIL      
MEMBERS PUT INTO WHAT THEY DO   

00:20:10.986 --> 00:20:13.587
THE WORK THAT CITY COUNCIL      
MEMBERS PUT INTO WHAT THEY DO

SO WE WERE USING THE SAME       

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.057
WERE KIND OF KEEPING CONSTANT   
SO WE WERE USING THE SAME       
PERCENTAGE BUT THE PERCENTAGE   

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:51.791
SO WE WERE USING THE SAME       
PERCENTAGE BUT THE PERCENTAGE   
WASN'T OF THE MAYOR'S SALARY    

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:54.994
PERCENTAGE BUT THE PERCENTAGE   
WASN'T OF THE MAYOR'S SALARY    
WAS THIS PERCENTAGE WAS         

00:20:54.996 --> 00:20:55.795
WASN'T OF THE MAYOR'S SALARY    
WAS THIS PERCENTAGE WAS         
IDENTICAL FOR THE MAYOR AND FOR 

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:58.698
WAS THIS PERCENTAGE WAS         
IDENTICAL FOR THE MAYOR AND FOR 
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.           

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.766
IDENTICAL FOR THE MAYOR AND FOR 
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.           
SO THERE ARE SET SALARIES AND   

00:20:59.768 --> 00:21:00.567
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.           
SO THERE ARE SET SALARIES AND   
THEN YOU GAVE JUST THAT THREE   

00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:02.768
SO THERE ARE SET SALARIES AND   
THEN YOU GAVE JUST THAT THREE   
PERCENT OR TWO PERCENT FOUR     

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.703
THEN YOU GAVE JUST THAT THREE   
PERCENT OR TWO PERCENT FOUR     
PERCENT ON THAT BECAUSE OF THE  

00:21:03.705 --> 00:21:04.637
PERCENT OR TWO PERCENT FOUR     
PERCENT ON THAT BECAUSE OF THE  
WAY THE MATH WORK WHAT WE FOUND 

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.639
PERCENT ON THAT BECAUSE OF THE  
WAY THE MATH WORK WHAT WE FOUND 
WAS THAT THE GAP WAS ACTUALLY   

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:07.340
WAY THE MATH WORK WHAT WE FOUND 
WAS THAT THE GAP WAS ACTUALLY   
WIDER AND WIDENING BECAUSE YOU  

00:21:07.342 --> 00:21:10.077
WAS THAT THE GAP WAS ACTUALLY   
WIDER AND WIDENING BECAUSE YOU  
KNOW, ANOTHER THREE PERCENT OR  

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:10.877
WIDER AND WIDENING BECAUSE YOU  
KNOW, ANOTHER THREE PERCENT OR  
WHATEVER PERCENT OF THE MAYOR'S 

00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:14.514
KNOW, ANOTHER THREE PERCENT OR  
WHATEVER PERCENT OF THE MAYOR'S 
SALARY ENHANCES HIS SALARY BY A 

00:21:14.516 --> 00:21:15.215
WHATEVER PERCENT OF THE MAYOR'S 
SALARY ENHANCES HIS SALARY BY A 
BIT MORE RIGHT FOR COUNCIL      

00:21:15.217 --> 00:21:15.482
SALARY ENHANCES HIS SALARY BY A 
BIT MORE RIGHT FOR COUNCIL      
MEMBERS.                        

00:21:15.484 --> 00:21:16.683
BIT MORE RIGHT FOR COUNCIL      
MEMBERS.                        
AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY           

00:21:16.685 --> 00:21:17.217
MEMBERS.                        
AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY           
INCREASING THE GAP.             

00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:21.488
AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY           
INCREASING THE GAP.             
>> OK, YEAH, SO THAT'S WHY WE   

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.222
INCREASING THE GAP.             
>> OK, YEAH, SO THAT'S WHY WE   
RESET IT TO PEG TO THE MAYOR'S  

00:21:22.224 --> 00:21:23.824
>> OK, YEAH, SO THAT'S WHY WE   
RESET IT TO PEG TO THE MAYOR'S  
SALARY BECAUSE THAT KIND        

00:21:23.826 --> 00:21:28.761
RESET IT TO PEG TO THE MAYOR'S  
SALARY BECAUSE THAT KIND        
OF CORRECTED THAT DISTORTION.   

00:21:28.763 --> 00:21:29.729
SALARY BECAUSE THAT KIND        
OF CORRECTED THAT DISTORTION.   
>> BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING DOING 

00:21:29.731 --> 00:21:32.999
OF CORRECTED THAT DISTORTION.   
>> BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING DOING 
IT IS YOU'RE NOT SURE THAT IT'S 

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:36.035
>> BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING DOING 
IT IS YOU'RE NOT SURE THAT IT'S 
ENOUGH FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS?     

00:21:36.037 --> 00:21:39.505
IT IS YOU'RE NOT SURE THAT IT'S 
ENOUGH FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS?     
>> I THINK THAT OUR GOAL WAS TO 

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:40.507
ENOUGH FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS?     
>> I THINK THAT OUR GOAL WAS TO 
MAYBE RECAPPING MORE THAN I CAN 

00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:43.809
>> I THINK THAT OUR GOAL WAS TO 
MAYBE RECAPPING MORE THAN I CAN 
HONESTLY SAY I REMEMBER BUT     

00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:44.711
MAYBE RECAPPING MORE THAN I CAN 
HONESTLY SAY I REMEMBER BUT     
GOAL WAS TO REACH 60 PERCENT    

00:21:44.713 --> 00:21:48.414
HONESTLY SAY I REMEMBER BUT     
GOAL WAS TO REACH 60 PERCENT    
AND THEN DECIDE IF WE WANTED TO 

00:21:48.416 --> 00:21:49.015
GOAL WAS TO REACH 60 PERCENT    
AND THEN DECIDE IF WE WANTED TO 
GO HIGHER DOWN THE ROAD.        

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.951
AND THEN DECIDE IF WE WANTED TO 
GO HIGHER DOWN THE ROAD.        
I SEE RIGHT.                    

00:21:50.953 --> 00:21:51.951
GO HIGHER DOWN THE ROAD.        
I SEE RIGHT.                    
AND BECAUSE WE ARE NOW TALKING  

00:21:51.953 --> 00:21:52.686
I SEE RIGHT.                    
AND BECAUSE WE ARE NOW TALKING  
ABOUT SALARIES FOR TWENTY SEVEN 

00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:55.454
AND BECAUSE WE ARE NOW TALKING  
ABOUT SALARIES FOR TWENTY SEVEN 
AND TWENTY EIGHT ESPECIALLY     

00:21:55.456 --> 00:21:56.189
ABOUT SALARIES FOR TWENTY SEVEN 
AND TWENTY EIGHT ESPECIALLY     
BEING REMINDED THAT WE HAVE THE 

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:59.358
AND TWENTY EIGHT ESPECIALLY     
BEING REMINDED THAT WE HAVE THE 
MONEY THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT   

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.059
BEING REMINDED THAT WE HAVE THE 
MONEY THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT   
GOING TO BE A PAINFUL TOOTH     

00:22:00.061 --> 00:22:03.063
MONEY THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT   
GOING TO BE A PAINFUL TOOTH     
EXTRACTION OR ANYTHING LIKE     

00:22:03.065 --> 00:22:03.396
GOING TO BE A PAINFUL TOOTH     
EXTRACTION OR ANYTHING LIKE     
THAT.                           

00:22:03.398 --> 00:22:04.430
EXTRACTION OR ANYTHING LIKE     
THAT.                           
>> I THINK WE CAN AFFORD IT AND 

00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:07.300
THAT.                           
>> I THINK WE CAN AFFORD IT AND 
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T   

00:22:07.302 --> 00:22:08.034
>> I THINK WE CAN AFFORD IT AND 
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T   
KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE TO         

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:11.504
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T   
KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE TO         
ARBITRARILY PICK BUT I THINK    

00:22:11.506 --> 00:22:12.172
KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE TO         
ARBITRARILY PICK BUT I THINK    
THAT GOING ABOVE 60 PERCENT     

00:22:12.174 --> 00:22:14.574
ARBITRARILY PICK BUT I THINK    
THAT GOING ABOVE 60 PERCENT     
MAKES SENSE TO ME BECAUSE IT'S  

00:22:14.576 --> 00:22:20.881
THAT GOING ABOVE 60 PERCENT     
MAKES SENSE TO ME BECAUSE IT'S  
STILL THE GAP                   

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:26.352
              AND I THINK THE   
SIXTY PERCENT FIGURE WAS JUST A 
BIT OF A BACK AND FORTH AND A   

00:22:26.354 --> 00:22:29.956
SIXTY PERCENT FIGURE WAS JUST A 
BIT OF A BACK AND FORTH AND A   
KIND OF A GENERAL SENSE OF THE  

00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:31.057
BIT OF A BACK AND FORTH AND A   
KIND OF A GENERAL SENSE OF THE  
COMMISSION AT THE TIME OF WHAT  

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:33.426
KIND OF A GENERAL SENSE OF THE  
COMMISSION AT THE TIME OF WHAT  
THAT DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD BE.    

00:22:33.428 --> 00:22:34.494
COMMISSION AT THE TIME OF WHAT  
THAT DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD BE.    
I DON'T THINK IT WAS BASED ON   

00:22:34.496 --> 00:22:37.030
THAT DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD BE.    
I DON'T THINK IT WAS BASED ON   
ANY KIND OF LOGICAL MODELING OR 

00:22:37.032 --> 00:22:37.830
I DON'T THINK IT WAS BASED ON   
ANY KIND OF LOGICAL MODELING OR 
ANYTHING TO COME TO THAT        

00:22:37.832 --> 00:22:38.231
ANY KIND OF LOGICAL MODELING OR 
ANYTHING TO COME TO THAT        
CONCLUSION.                     

00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:41.467
ANYTHING TO COME TO THAT        
CONCLUSION.                     
SO IT IS SOMETHING OF A KIND    

00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:42.269
CONCLUSION.                     
SO IT IS SOMETHING OF A KIND    
OF AN ARBITRARY BENCHMARK THAT  

00:22:42.271 --> 00:22:45.939
SO IT IS SOMETHING OF A KIND    
OF AN ARBITRARY BENCHMARK THAT  
WAS SET A FEW YEARS AGO AS THAT 

00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:49.675
OF AN ARBITRARY BENCHMARK THAT  
WAS SET A FEW YEARS AGO AS THAT 
DIFFERENTIAL JUST TO NOTE TEN   

00:22:49.677 --> 00:22:50.509
WAS SET A FEW YEARS AGO AS THAT 
DIFFERENTIAL JUST TO NOTE TEN   
YEARS AGO IN 2015 THE COUNCIL   

00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:53.680
DIFFERENTIAL JUST TO NOTE TEN   
YEARS AGO IN 2015 THE COUNCIL   
SALARIES WERE 37 PERCENT OF THE 

00:22:53.682 --> 00:22:54.013
YEARS AGO IN 2015 THE COUNCIL   
SALARIES WERE 37 PERCENT OF THE 
MAYOR.                          

00:22:54.015 --> 00:22:56.016
SALARIES WERE 37 PERCENT OF THE 
MAYOR.                          
SO WOW.                         

00:22:56.018 --> 00:23:00.820
MAYOR.                          
SO WOW.                         
I MEAN WOULD YOU PROPOSE        

00:23:00.822 --> 00:23:01.688
SO WOW.                         
I MEAN WOULD YOU PROPOSE        
POTENTIALLY INCREASING IT LIKE  

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:02.355
I MEAN WOULD YOU PROPOSE        
POTENTIALLY INCREASING IT LIKE  
IT HAD FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY   

00:23:02.357 --> 00:23:05.759
POTENTIALLY INCREASING IT LIKE  
IT HAD FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY   
THREE SESSION TO NOW SO ANOTHER 

00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:09.262
IT HAD FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY   
THREE SESSION TO NOW SO ANOTHER 
TWO AND A HALF PERCENT I WOULD  

00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:09.929
THREE SESSION TO NOW SO ANOTHER 
TWO AND A HALF PERCENT I WOULD  
FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH      

00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:10.263
TWO AND A HALF PERCENT I WOULD  
FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH      
THAT.                           

00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:10.997
FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH      
THAT.                           
THAT'S AT EVEN AT A MINIMUM     

00:23:10.999 --> 00:23:12.532
THAT.                           
THAT'S AT EVEN AT A MINIMUM     
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS       

00:23:12.534 --> 00:23:13.466
THAT'S AT EVEN AT A MINIMUM     
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS       
ACTUALLY I HAD GOING BACK TO    

00:23:13.468 --> 00:23:16.636
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS       
ACTUALLY I HAD GOING BACK TO    
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER    

00:23:16.638 --> 00:23:17.436
ACTUALLY I HAD GOING BACK TO    
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER    
BRIAN WAS RIGHT WHEN I WAS      

00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:20.707
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER    
BRIAN WAS RIGHT WHEN I WAS      
LOOKING AT THE THE ATTACHMENTS  

00:23:20.709 --> 00:23:24.711
BRIAN WAS RIGHT WHEN I WAS      
LOOKING AT THE THE ATTACHMENTS  
THAT WE SENT AND SOME OF THIS   

00:23:24.713 --> 00:23:25.245
LOOKING AT THE THE ATTACHMENTS  
THAT WE SENT AND SOME OF THIS   
IS OLD INFORMATION.             

00:23:25.247 --> 00:23:27.713
THAT WE SENT AND SOME OF THIS   
IS OLD INFORMATION.             
IT HAS ALWAYS STRUCK ME THAT    

00:23:27.715 --> 00:23:31.284
IS OLD INFORMATION.             
IT HAS ALWAYS STRUCK ME THAT    
IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIGURE WHERE  

00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:32.152
IT HAS ALWAYS STRUCK ME THAT    
IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIGURE WHERE  
WE STAND VIS A VIS OTHER        

00:23:32.154 --> 00:23:32.752
IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIGURE WHERE  
WE STAND VIS A VIS OTHER        
COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY OTHER   

00:23:32.754 --> 00:23:35.688
WE STAND VIS A VIS OTHER        
COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY OTHER   
COMMUNITIES OUT OF STATE.       

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:36.656
COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY OTHER   
COMMUNITIES OUT OF STATE.       
BUT ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT  

00:23:36.658 --> 00:23:40.726
COMMUNITIES OUT OF STATE.       
BUT ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT  
WHEN YOU HAVE A MAYOR WHO IS    

00:23:40.728 --> 00:23:41.461
BUT ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT  
WHEN YOU HAVE A MAYOR WHO IS    
ESSENTIALLY ALSO THE SUPERVISOR 

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:44.797
WHEN YOU HAVE A MAYOR WHO IS    
ESSENTIALLY ALSO THE SUPERVISOR 
RIGHT, THAT'S A BIG DEAL.       

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:47.433
ESSENTIALLY ALSO THE SUPERVISOR 
RIGHT, THAT'S A BIG DEAL.       
THAT'S TWO JOBS AND ONE WE HAVE 

00:23:47.435 --> 00:23:48.101
RIGHT, THAT'S A BIG DEAL.       
THAT'S TWO JOBS AND ONE WE HAVE 
A CITY ADMINISTRATOR.           

00:23:48.103 --> 00:23:48.434
THAT'S TWO JOBS AND ONE WE HAVE 
A CITY ADMINISTRATOR.           
RIGHT.                          

00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:51.237
A CITY ADMINISTRATOR.           
RIGHT.                          
SO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IT    

00:23:51.239 --> 00:23:52.171
RIGHT.                          
SO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IT    
TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THAT  

00:23:52.173 --> 00:23:55.308
SO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IT    
TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THAT  
LOAD OFF THE MAYOR IN ADDITION  

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.009
TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THAT  
LOAD OFF THE MAYOR IN ADDITION  
CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE     

00:23:56.011 --> 00:23:58.411
LOAD OFF THE MAYOR IN ADDITION  
CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE     
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS     

00:23:58.413 --> 00:23:58.945
CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE     
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS     
HAVE REALLY TAKEN               

00:23:58.947 --> 00:23:59.613
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS     
HAVE REALLY TAKEN               
RESPONSIBILITIES OF BOTH THE    

00:23:59.615 --> 00:24:02.749
HAVE REALLY TAKEN               
RESPONSIBILITIES OF BOTH THE    
MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS  

00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:03.349
RESPONSIBILITIES OF BOTH THE    
MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS  
AND REALLOCATED THEM TO         

00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:06.319
MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS  
AND REALLOCATED THEM TO         
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS.     

00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:10.122
AND REALLOCATED THEM TO         
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS.     
NOW THAT BURDEN SHIFTING HAS    

00:24:10.124 --> 00:24:10.956
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS.     
NOW THAT BURDEN SHIFTING HAS    
PROBABLY AFFECTED MEMBERS AS    

00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:14.994
NOW THAT BURDEN SHIFTING HAS    
PROBABLY AFFECTED MEMBERS AS    
EQUALLY AS THE MAYOR, BUT IT'S  

00:24:14.996 --> 00:24:18.431
PROBABLY AFFECTED MEMBERS AS    
EQUALLY AS THE MAYOR, BUT IT'S  
SORT OF TO ME REITERATES HOW

EQUALLY AS THE MAYOR, BUT IT'S  
SORT OF TO ME REITERATES HOW    
SIMILAR THE JOBS ARE RATHER     

00:24:22.704 --> 00:24:23.236
SORT OF TO ME REITERATES HOW    
SIMILAR THE JOBS ARE RATHER     
THAN HOW DIFFERENT.             

00:24:23.238 --> 00:24:25.471
SIMILAR THE JOBS ARE RATHER     
THAN HOW DIFFERENT.             
>> AND SO I DON'T FEEL AS       

00:24:25.473 --> 00:24:30.143
THAN HOW DIFFERENT.             
>> AND SO I DON'T FEEL AS       
PROTECTIVE AS I MIGHT OTHERWISE

>> AND SO I DON'T FEEL AS       
PROTECTIVE AS I MIGHT OTHERWISE 
BE IF THE MAYOR'S JOB REALLY    

00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:33.680
PROTECTIVE AS I MIGHT OTHERWISE 
BE IF THE MAYOR'S JOB REALLY    
WERE A COMBINATION OF MAYOR AND

VISION FOR WHERE WE WANT TO GO. 
AND SO EVEN IF WE WERE TO SET A 

00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:03.329

AND SO EVEN IF WE WERE TO SET A 
GOAL FOR 66 PERCENT THAT'S NOT  

00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.030
AND SO EVEN IF WE WERE TO SET A
