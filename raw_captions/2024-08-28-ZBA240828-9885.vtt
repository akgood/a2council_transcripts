INTO LOT FIVE AND SO THEY ARE   

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:11.064
THAT ARE ON LOT EIGHT OVERLAP   
INTO LOT FIVE AND SO THEY ARE   
NOT REALLY PART OF THE

SO I'M AS INDIVIDUAL LIKE THEY  
ARE AND THAT LITTLE BIT IN THE  
BACK THEN BECOMES A PROBLEM     

00:24:53.722 --> 00:24:56.323
ARE AND THAT LITTLE BIT IN THE  
BACK THEN BECOMES A PROBLEM     
BECAUSE IT BECOMES UNACCESSIBLE 

00:24:56.325 --> 00:24:56.657
BACK THEN BECOMES A PROBLEM     
BECAUSE IT BECOMES UNACCESSIBLE 
.

BECAUSE IT BECOMES UNACCESSIBLE 
.                               
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING   

00:24:57.593 --> 00:25:01.194
.

THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT SANABIS   
SEEMS TO WANT ME TO DO.         

00:25:25.821 --> 00:25:27.454
THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT SANABIS   
SEEMS TO WANT ME TO DO.         
THE NEXT DOOR PROPERTY IS A     

00:25:27.456 --> 00:25:27.955
SEEMS TO WANT ME TO DO.         
THE NEXT DOOR PROPERTY IS A     
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT.           

00:25:27.957 --> 00:25:28.755
THE NEXT DOOR PROPERTY IS A     
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT.           
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR YOUR SIX      

00:25:28.757 --> 00:25:31.024
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT.           
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR YOUR SIX      
THOUSAND YOU BROWN BUILDING IS  

00:25:31.026 --> 00:25:31.624
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR YOUR SIX      
THOUSAND YOU BROWN BUILDING IS  
TWO THOUSAND SQUARE.            

00:25:31.626 --> 00:25:32.325
THOUSAND YOU BROWN BUILDING IS  
TWO THOUSAND SQUARE.            
>> YOU COULD EXPAND YOUR        

00:25:32.327 --> 00:25:35.261
TWO THOUSAND SQUARE.            
>> YOU COULD EXPAND YOUR        
OUTDOOR SEATING AREA WHERE YOU  

00:25:35.263 --> 00:25:38.498
>> YOU COULD EXPAND YOUR        
OUTDOOR SEATING AREA WHERE YOU  
KNOW EVERYONE YOU KNOW WHETHER  

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.600
OUTDOOR SEATING AREA WHERE YOU  
KNOW EVERYONE YOU KNOW WHETHER  
YOU PARK A PARK IN FRONT OF IT  

00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:42.602
KNOW EVERYONE YOU KNOW WHETHER  
YOU PARK A PARK IN FRONT OF IT  
SO THEN YOU LOSE.               

00:25:42.604 --> 00:25:43.804
YOU PARK A PARK IN FRONT OF IT  
SO THEN YOU LOSE.               
SO THEN IF I SOLD THE OTHER     

00:25:43.806 --> 00:25:44.405
SO THEN YOU LOSE.               
SO THEN IF I SOLD THE OTHER     
PIECE OF PROPERTY THEY COULD    

00:25:44.407 --> 00:25:46.573
SO THEN IF I SOLD THE OTHER     
PIECE OF PROPERTY THEY COULD    
PUT PARKING RIGHT IN FRONT      

00:25:46.575 --> 00:25:47.674
PIECE OF PROPERTY THEY COULD    
PUT PARKING RIGHT IN FRONT      
OF IT BLOCKING IT OFF, PUT A    

00:25:47.676 --> 00:25:48.008
PUT PARKING RIGHT IN FRONT      
OF IT BLOCKING IT OFF, PUT A    
FENCE UP.                       

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.310
OF IT BLOCKING IT OFF, PUT A    
FENCE UP.                       
>> YEAH THAT THAT THE DEPTH     

00:25:50.312 --> 00:25:53.713
FENCE UP.                       
>> YEAH THAT THAT THE DEPTH     
OF THAT SPACE IS SHORTER THAN   

00:25:53.715 --> 00:25:54.248
>> YEAH THAT THAT THE DEPTH     
OF THAT SPACE IS SHORTER THAN   
STANDARD PARKING SPACE.         

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:58.384
OF THAT SPACE IS SHORTER THAN   
STANDARD PARKING SPACE.         
SO THERE THERE I THINK THE CITY 

00:25:58.386 --> 00:25:59.019
STANDARD PARKING SPACE.         
SO THERE THERE I THINK THE CITY 
WOULD HAVE TROUBLE APPROVING    

00:25:59.021 --> 00:26:02.489
SO THERE THERE I THINK THE CITY 
WOULD HAVE TROUBLE APPROVING    
PARKING THERE IF THIS WERE IN   

00:26:02.491 --> 00:26:03.423
WOULD HAVE TROUBLE APPROVING    
PARKING THERE IF THIS WERE IN   
FRONT OF THEM FOR FOR A SITE    

00:26:03.425 --> 00:26:06.493
PARKING THERE IF THIS WERE IN   
FRONT OF THEM FOR FOR A SITE    
PLAN AND WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP  

00:26:06.495 --> 00:26:10.063
FRONT OF THEM FOR FOR A SITE    
PLAN AND WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP  
THAT PARKING PARKING IS AT A    

00:26:10.065 --> 00:26:10.864
PLAN AND WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP  
THAT PARKING PARKING IS AT A    
PREMIUM IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AS 

00:26:10.866 --> 00:26:13.133
THAT PARKING PARKING IS AT A    
PREMIUM IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AS 
AS IT IS BECAUSE THE BUSINESSES 

00:26:13.135 --> 00:26:13.867
PREMIUM IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AS 
AS IT IS BECAUSE THE BUSINESSES 
THAT ARE LOCATED ON THE BLOCK   

00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:16.636
AS IT IS BECAUSE THE BUSINESSES 
THAT ARE LOCATED ON THE BLOCK   
THAT ARE ARE ACTUALLY

WELL WE INDICATED IS THAT THE   
PRACTICAL IN THIS CASE IT'S     
PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE  

00:26:39.295 --> 00:26:39.960
PRACTICAL IN THIS CASE IT'S     
PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE  
WE'RE SEEKING A DIMENSIONAL     

00:26:39.962 --> 00:26:42.095
PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE  
WE'RE SEEKING A DIMENSIONAL     
VARIANCE.                       

00:26:42.097 --> 00:26:42.862
WE'RE SEEKING A DIMENSIONAL

VARIANCE AND WE'RE NOT SEEKING  
THAT.                           
BUT IT'S REALLY THE PRACTICAL   

00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:49.303
THAT.                           
BUT IT'S REALLY THE PRACTICAL

THERE'S MONITORING WELLS THAT

00:27:25.207 --> 00:27:29.409
THERE'S MONITORING WELLS THAT

NOT AN AREA THAT WE CAN BEGIN

NOT AN AREA THAT WE CAN BEGIN

NOT AN AREA THAT WE CAN BEGIN

SO THE ONLY PLACE THAT WE CAN   

00:27:33.448 --> 00:27:36.250
TO MOVE TO.                     
SO THE ONLY PLACE THAT WE CAN   
LOOK TO TO TRY TO RATIONALIZE   

00:27:36.252 --> 00:27:37.050
SO THE ONLY PLACE THAT WE CAN

00:27:45.294 --> 00:27:48.661
PARKING LOT LOT AND LOTFY WHICH 
IS THE NORTH SIDE AND WE LOOKED 
AT DID IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU     

00:27:48.663 --> 00:27:52.131
IS THE NORTH SIDE AND WE LOOKED 
AT DID IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU     
KNOW, LOP OFF THOSE SPACES AND  

00:27:52.133 --> 00:27:55.735
AT DID IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU     
KNOW, LOP OFF THOSE SPACES AND  
MAINTAIN THE NORTH SIDE BUT     

00:27:55.737 --> 00:27:56.336
KNOW, LOP OFF THOSE SPACES AND  
MAINTAIN THE NORTH SIDE BUT     
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY          

00:27:56.338 --> 00:27:57.004
MAINTAIN THE NORTH SIDE BUT     
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY          
EVENTUALLY RESULT IN THE LOSS   

00:27:57.006 --> 00:27:59.873
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY          
EVENTUALLY RESULT IN THE LOSS   
OF THOSE PARKING SPACES AND WE

EVENTUALLY RESULT IN THE LOSS   
OF THOSE PARKING SPACES AND WE  
CAN'T CARVE OUT MORE AREA OUT   

00:28:03.278 --> 00:28:04.044
OF THOSE PARKING SPACES AND WE  
CAN'T CARVE OUT MORE AREA OUT   
OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST GOING 

00:28:04.046 --> 00:28:04.911
CAN'T CARVE OUT MORE AREA OUT   
OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST GOING 
TO TAKE THE NORTH SIDE USE      

00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:07.780
OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST GOING

THE A LOT THAT IS BEING SOLD IS 

00:54:21.555 --> 00:54:22.687

EITHER WAY ON THIS BUT FOR ME   
THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THAT LOT 

00:54:24.258 --> 00:54:26.991
EITHER WAY ON THIS BUT FOR ME   
THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THAT LOT 
ISN'T QUITE BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE  

00:54:26.993 --> 00:54:27.726
THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THAT LOT 
ISN'T QUITE BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE  
THE HOUSES SEEM REASONABLE AND  

00:54:27.728 --> 00:54:30.995
ISN'T QUITE BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE  
THE HOUSES SEEM REASONABLE AND  
FIT IN WITH THE EXISTING HOUSES 

00:54:30.997 --> 00:54:34.232
THE HOUSES SEEM REASONABLE AND  
FIT IN WITH THE EXISTING HOUSES 
ON THAT IN THE AREA AND SO      

00:54:34.234 --> 00:54:35.367
FIT IN WITH THE EXISTING HOUSES 
ON THAT IN THE AREA AND SO      
THESE ARE THIS IS A SMALLISH    

00:54:35.369 --> 00:54:38.970
ON THAT IN THE AREA AND SO      
THESE ARE THIS IS A SMALLISH    
CONCESSION TO BUILDING MORE

THEY COULD DO TWO HOUSES.       

00:54:45.746 --> 00:54:46.811
WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND YES,  
THEY COULD DO TWO HOUSES.       
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS  

00:54:46.813 --> 00:54:47.612
THEY COULD DO TWO HOUSES.       
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS  
PEOPLE COME HERE IS IS THEY     

00:54:47.614 --> 00:54:50.348
