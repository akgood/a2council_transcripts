I DO THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

I DO THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN OUR ADVISORY MISSIONS

CONFUSED.                       

00:58:15.626 --> 00:58:18.893
COUNCILOR, THE I'M A LITTLE     
CONFUSED.                       
I WONDER IF THEY NEED BYLAWS    

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:19.560
CONFUSED.                       
I WONDER IF THEY NEED BYLAWS    
BEFORE THEY MEET THE FIRST      

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:19.895
I WONDER IF THEY NEED BYLAWS    
BEFORE THEY MEET THE FIRST      
TIME.                           

00:58:19.897 --> 00:58:23.197
BEFORE THEY MEET THE FIRST      
TIME.                           
BUT I WAS GOING TO NOTE THAT IN 

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:23.932
TIME.                           
BUT I WAS GOING TO NOTE THAT IN 
VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THEY      

00:58:23.934 --> 00:58:27.268
BUT I WAS GOING TO NOTE THAT IN 
VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THEY      
DON'T EXIST YET, YOU KNOW, WE'D 

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.169
VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THEY      
DON'T EXIST YET, YOU KNOW, WE'D 
NEED TO HEAR FROM THEM AND IN   

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:30.572
DON'T EXIST YET, YOU KNOW, WE'D 
NEED TO HEAR FROM THEM AND IN   
VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE TWO   

00:58:30.574 --> 00:58:31.573
NEED TO HEAR FROM THEM AND IN   
VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE TWO   
COMMISSIONS WELL, I KNOW THE    

00:58:31.575 --> 00:58:32.440
VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE TWO   
COMMISSIONS WELL, I KNOW THE    
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION ALWAYS 

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:34.909
COMMISSIONS WELL, I KNOW THE    
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION ALWAYS 
HAD BEFORE AND AFTER AND I      

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:35.577
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION ALWAYS 
HAD BEFORE AND AFTER AND I      
BELIEVE THE ENERGY COMMISSION   

00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:36.244
HAD BEFORE AND AFTER AND I      
BELIEVE THE ENERGY COMMISSION   
HAS BEFORE AND AFTER.           

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:39.181
BELIEVE THE ENERGY COMMISSION   
HAS BEFORE AND AFTER.           
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO CARRY OVER 

00:58:39.183 --> 00:58:40.115
HAS BEFORE AND AFTER.           
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO CARRY OVER 
IF IT'S THE COMMISSION THAT'S   

00:58:40.117 --> 00:58:43.451
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO CARRY OVER 
IF IT'S THE COMMISSION THAT'S   
MERGING THOSE TWO, I THINK IT   

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:44.218
IF IT'S THE COMMISSION THAT'S   
MERGING THOSE TWO, I THINK IT   
MAKES SENSE TO CARRY OVER THAT  

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:47.155
MERGING THOSE TWO, I THINK IT   
MAKES SENSE TO CARRY OVER THAT  
PRACTICE WOULD ALSO MAKE SENSE  

00:58:47.157 --> 00:58:47.889
MAKES SENSE TO CARRY OVER THAT  
PRACTICE WOULD ALSO MAKE SENSE  
TO LET THE COMMISSION AFFIRM    

00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:48.690
PRACTICE WOULD ALSO MAKE SENSE  
TO LET THE COMMISSION AFFIRM    
THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO CARRY THE 

00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:50.925
TO LET THE COMMISSION AFFIRM    
THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO CARRY THE 
NEW COMMISSION.                 

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:51.926
THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO CARRY THE 
NEW COMMISSION.                 
IT DOES YET AFFIRM THAT IT      

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:55.096
NEW COMMISSION.                 
IT DOES YET AFFIRM THAT IT      
WOULD LIKE TO CARRY OVER THE    

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:55.430
IT DOES YET AFFIRM THAT IT      
WOULD LIKE TO CARRY OVER THE    
PRACTICE.                       

00:58:55.432 --> 00:58:56.231
WOULD LIKE TO CARRY OVER THE    
PRACTICE.                       
SO I WOULD WELCOME THEM ASKING  

00:58:56.233 --> 00:58:59.167

MUCH IT WILL RAISE THE COST BUT 

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:36.844
IT IS NOT CLEAR EXACTLY HOW     
MUCH IT WILL RAISE THE COST BUT 
THE ESTIMATE ONE ESTIMATE IS    

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:37.845
MUCH IT WILL RAISE THE COST BUT 
THE ESTIMATE ONE ESTIMATE IS    
THAT IF WE PURCHASED ALL OF IT, 

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:41.415
THE ESTIMATE ONE ESTIMATE IS    
THAT IF WE PURCHASED ALL OF IT, 
IF WE BONDED FOR THE DECKS ALL  

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:44.819
THAT IF WE PURCHASED ALL OF IT, 
IF WE BONDED FOR THE DECKS ALL  
THREE OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE  

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:45.553
IF WE BONDED FOR THE DECKS ALL  
THREE OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE  
CONSTRUCTED THAT WOULD SAVE     

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:46.154
THREE OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE  
CONSTRUCTED THAT WOULD SAVE     
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN       
FINANCING COSTS.

THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN       
FINANCING COSTS.

FINANCING COSTS.                
SO WE ARE LIKELY TO LOSE        
SOMEWHERE AROUND A THIRD TO

SO WE ARE LIKELY TO LOSE

PROBABLY LESS THAN A HALF BUT A

CAN GO INTO BUILDING THE        

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:00.568
OF THAT MONEY AND THAT MONEY    
CAN GO INTO BUILDING THE        
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO

INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO  
SUPPORT THAT PROJECT AND ITS    

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.371
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO  
SUPPORT THAT PROJECT AND ITS    
IMPORTANT MONEY BECAUSE IT'S    

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:07.641
SUPPORT THAT PROJECT AND ITS    
IMPORTANT MONEY BECAUSE IT'S    
MONEY THAT IS NOT TIED TO USERS 

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:07.842
IMPORTANT MONEY BECAUSE IT'S    
MONEY THAT IS NOT TIED TO USERS

MONEY THAT IS NOT TIED TO USERS 
.

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:12.246
.                               
SO IT'S A WAY OF EXTENDING      
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CAN      

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:12.680
SO IT'S A WAY OF EXTENDING      
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CAN      
SIMPLY HAVE.                    

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:13.347
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CAN      
SIMPLY HAVE.                    
WE CAN SIMPLY PUT IT THERE      

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:16.083
SIMPLY HAVE.                    
WE CAN SIMPLY PUT IT THERE      
BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO FIRST  

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:16.951
WE CAN SIMPLY PUT IT THERE      
BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO FIRST  
GET PEOPLE TO HOOK UP AND WE    

01:09:16.953 --> 01:09:18.819
BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO FIRST  
GET PEOPLE TO HOOK UP AND WE    
OBVIOUSLY BY LAW CANNOT PUT     

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:19.786
GET PEOPLE TO HOOK UP AND WE    
OBVIOUSLY BY LAW CANNOT PUT     
THAT COST ON THE BACKS          

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:20.388
OBVIOUSLY BY LAW CANNOT PUT     
THAT COST ON THE BACKS          
OF CURRENT TAXPAYERS.           

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:23.391
THAT COST ON THE BACKS          
OF CURRENT TAXPAYERS.           
SO THIS IS CRUCIAL MONEY BUT    

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:27.194
OF CURRENT TAXPAYERS.           
SO THIS IS CRUCIAL MONEY BUT    
RISK IS ALSO REAL AND I THINK   

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:28.195
SO THIS IS CRUCIAL MONEY BUT    
RISK IS ALSO REAL AND I THINK   
THIS IS A GOOD MIDDLE WAY THAT  

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:31.432
RISK IS ALSO REAL AND I THINK   
THIS IS A GOOD MIDDLE WAY THAT  
I SUPPORT BECAUSE IT WILL COME  

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.166
THIS IS A GOOD MIDDLE WAY THAT  
I SUPPORT BECAUSE IT WILL COME  
AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE MORE

I SUPPORT BECAUSE IT WILL COME  
AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE MORE     
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT

I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THEY  
CHARACTERIZE THE LETTER IT'S    

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:13.159
I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THEY  
CHARACTERIZE THE LETTER IT'S    
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE BUS          

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:15.629

YOU KNOW, IT'S THE BUS          
ADVOCATING FOR YOU MULTI-MODAL  

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:16.263
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE BUS          
ADVOCATING FOR YOU MULTI-MODAL  
TRANSIT THEY SHOULD I THINK     

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:19.299
ADVOCATING FOR YOU MULTI-MODAL  
TRANSIT THEY SHOULD I THINK     
THAT THEY EXPECTED THE          

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:20.000
TRANSIT THEY SHOULD I THINK     
THAT THEY EXPECTED THE          
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT 

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:23.270
THAT THEY EXPECTED THE          
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT 
WOULD BE MORE STUDENT HEAVY     

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:24.271
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT 
WOULD BE MORE STUDENT HEAVY     
THAN I THINK THE DEVELOPMENT    

01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:24.938
WOULD BE MORE STUDENT HEAVY     
THAN I THINK THE DEVELOPMENT    
TEAM IS ANTICIPATING WHICH      

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.307
THAN I THINK THE DEVELOPMENT    
TEAM IS ANTICIPATING WHICH      
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT MODE       

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:27.640
TEAM IS ANTICIPATING WHICH      
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT MODE       
SHARE.                          

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:28.642
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT MODE       
SHARE.                          
I THINK TYPICALLY IN ARBORISTS  

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:31.111
SHARE.                          
I THINK TYPICALLY IN ARBORISTS  
SIX OR SEVEN PERCENT MODE SHARE 

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:31.578
I THINK TYPICALLY IN ARBORISTS  
SIX OR SEVEN PERCENT MODE SHARE 
RIDE THE BUS.                   

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.313
SIX OR SEVEN PERCENT MODE SHARE 
RIDE THE BUS.                   
I THINK THAT THEY WERE          

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:35.648
RIDE THE BUS.                   
I THINK THAT THEY WERE          
PROJECTING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 20 

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:36.350
I THINK THAT THEY WERE          
PROJECTING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 20 
AND 30 PERCENT WOULD RIDE THE   

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:36.616
PROJECTING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 20 
AND 30 PERCENT WOULD RIDE THE   
BUS.                            

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.551
AND 30 PERCENT WOULD RIDE THE   
BUS.                            
THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL PLACE 

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:39.486
BUS.                            
THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL PLACE 
FOR US TO GET AS A COMMUNITY.   

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:40.620
THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL PLACE 
FOR US TO GET AS A COMMUNITY.   
BUT FOR THAT TO BE PART OF THIS 

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:42.890
FOR US TO GET AS A COMMUNITY.   
BUT FOR THAT TO BE PART OF THIS 
DEVELOPMENT I THINK IS PROBABLY 

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:43.490
BUT FOR THAT TO BE PART OF THIS 
DEVELOPMENT I THINK IS PROBABLY 
A WAYS OFF INTO THE FUTURE.     

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:47.261
DEVELOPMENT I THINK IS PROBABLY 
A WAYS OFF INTO THE FUTURE.     
SO SAYING THIS IS GOING TO HAVE 

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:50.998
A WAYS OFF INTO THE FUTURE.     
SO SAYING THIS IS GOING TO HAVE 
THE EFFECT ON ON THE ON THE BUS 

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:51.765
SO SAYING THIS IS GOING TO HAVE 
THE EFFECT ON ON THE ON THE BUS 
SERVICE THAT THEY'RE KIND       

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:54.801
THE EFFECT ON ON THE ON THE BUS 
SERVICE THAT THEY'RE KIND       
OF ANTICIPATING MIGHT BE MORE   

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:58.438
SERVICE THAT THEY'RE KIND       
OF ANTICIPATING MIGHT BE MORE   
THAN ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HANDS    

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:58.705
OF ANTICIPATING MIGHT BE MORE   
THAN ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HANDS    
OUT.                            

01:17:58.707 --> 01:17:59.839
THAN ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HANDS    
OUT.                            
BUT JUST JUST I MEAN JUST YOU   

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:02.843
OUT.                            
BUT JUST JUST I MEAN JUST YOU   
KNOW, THE BIGGER PICTURE THIS   

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:03.577
BUT JUST JUST I MEAN JUST YOU   
KNOW, THE BIGGER PICTURE THIS   
IS A BIG PARKING LOT RIGHT NOW. 

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:06.079
KNOW, THE BIGGER PICTURE THIS   
IS A BIG PARKING LOT RIGHT NOW. 
THERE ARE NO BUS RIDERS HERE.   

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.080
IS A BIG PARKING LOT RIGHT NOW. 
THERE ARE NO BUS RIDERS HERE.   
WE'RE GOING TO ADD A THOUSAND   

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:10.217
THERE ARE NO BUS RIDERS HERE.   
WE'RE GOING TO ADD A THOUSAND   
UNITS, TWO HUNDRED OF WHICH ARE 

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:10.884
WE'RE GOING TO ADD A THOUSAND   
UNITS, TWO HUNDRED OF WHICH ARE 
AFFORDABLE TO THAT POINT.       

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.754
UNITS, TWO HUNDRED OF WHICH ARE 
AFFORDABLE TO THAT POINT.       
SO IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY THAT  

01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:14.555
AFFORDABLE TO THAT POINT.       
SO IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY THAT  
THE BUS OPERATES IN THE CITY.   

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:16.656
SO IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY THAT  
THE BUS OPERATES IN THE CITY.   
HOPEFULLY A LOT MORE RIDERS.    

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.824
THE BUS OPERATES IN THE CITY.   
HOPEFULLY A LOT MORE RIDERS.    
BUT I THINK THAT IS TO YOU
