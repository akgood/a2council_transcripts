00:18:58.567 --> 00:18:59.300
TWO EXISTING WINDOWS I BELIEVE  
THEY'RE IN BATHROOMS WHERE      
YOU'RE CALLING OUT INSULATE AND 

00:18:59.302 --> 00:19:02.703
THEY'RE IN BATHROOMS WHERE      
YOU'RE CALLING OUT INSULATE AND 
DRYWALL THE INTERIOR OF THE

DRYWALL THE INTERIOR OF THE     
WINDOW.                         
SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. 

00:19:03.973 --> 00:19:05.039

SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO 

00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:07.074

00:19:07.076 --> 00:19:07.808
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO 
LOOK LIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE      
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY      

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.711
LOOK LIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE      
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY      
CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT WHAT   

00:19:10.713 --> 00:19:11.679
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY      
CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT WHAT   
IS THE LIKE TELL ME A LITTLE    

00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:13.280
CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT WHAT   
IS THE LIKE TELL ME A LITTLE    
MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT PLAN       

00:19:13.282 --> 00:19:17.984
IS THE LIKE TELL ME A LITTLE    
MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT PLAN       
TRYING TO PUT WILL ESSENTIALLY  

00:19:17.986 --> 00:19:18.585
MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT PLAN       
TRYING TO PUT WILL ESSENTIALLY  
BE THREE BATHROOMS IN THE       

00:19:18.587 --> 00:19:21.888
TRYING TO PUT WILL ESSENTIALLY  
BE THREE BATHROOMS IN THE       
UPSTAIRS WHERE EVEN THOUGH IT'S 

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.593
BE THREE BATHROOMS IN THE       
UPSTAIRS WHERE EVEN THOUGH IT'S 
A PRETTY LARGE UPSTAIRS BECAUSE 

00:19:25.595 --> 00:19:26.293
UPSTAIRS WHERE EVEN THOUGH IT'S 
A PRETTY LARGE UPSTAIRS BECAUSE 
OF WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE        

00:19:26.295 --> 00:19:27.027
A PRETTY LARGE UPSTAIRS BECAUSE 
OF WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE        
LOCATED WOULD HAVE TWO WINDOWS  

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:30.231
OF WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE        
LOCATED WOULD HAVE TWO WINDOWS  
IN EACH BATHROOM AND SO THAT'S  

00:19:30.233 --> 00:19:32.700
LOCATED WOULD HAVE TWO WINDOWS  
IN EACH BATHROOM AND SO THAT'S  
JUST TOO MUCH TO FIT EVERYTHING 

00:19:32.702 --> 00:19:33.100
IN EACH BATHROOM AND SO THAT'S  
JUST TOO MUCH TO FIT EVERYTHING 
ELSE IN.                        

00:19:33.102 --> 00:19:34.034
JUST TOO MUCH TO FIT EVERYTHING 
ELSE IN.                        
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO KEEP   

00:19:34.036 --> 00:19:37.405
ELSE IN.                        
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO KEEP   
THE WINDOWS ON THE OUTSIDE THE  

00:19:37.407 --> 00:19:38.372
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO KEEP   
THE WINDOWS ON THE OUTSIDE THE  
BUILDER WHO'S WORKING ON THIS   

00:19:38.374 --> 00:19:41.441
THE WINDOWS ON THE OUTSIDE THE  
BUILDER WHO'S WORKING ON THIS   
HOUSE IN A FARMHOUSE IN         

00:19:41.443 --> 00:19:42.276

BACK THROUGH DIFFERENT SECTIONS 

00:36:42.297 --> 00:36:43.095

BACK THROUGH DIFFERENT SECTIONS 
OF THE ZONING CODE , I'M MUCH   

00:36:43.097 --> 00:36:45.498
BACK THROUGH DIFFERENT SECTIONS 
OF THE ZONING CODE , I'M MUCH   
MORE LIKELY TO DESIGN SOMETHING 

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.001
OF THE ZONING CODE , I'M MUCH   
MORE LIKELY TO DESIGN SOMETHING 
THAT HAS A CONFLICT IN THERE.   

00:36:49.003 --> 00:36:50.203
MORE LIKELY TO DESIGN SOMETHING 
THAT HAS A CONFLICT IN THERE.   
AND YOU KNOW, THE ANN ARBOR     

00:36:50.205 --> 00:36:52.405
THAT HAS A CONFLICT IN THERE.

LIKE IN A FORM BASE CODE WE CAN 
SAY LIKE YOU ARE YOU YOUR       
BUILDING NEEDS TO HAVE THESE    

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.120
SAY LIKE YOU ARE YOU YOUR       
BUILDING NEEDS TO HAVE THESE

YOU KNOW, BE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE  

00:37:42.156 --> 00:37:45.625
ELEMENTS IN THESE AREAS LIKE    
YOU KNOW, BE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE  
ABOUT IT WHICH I THINK THE MORE 

00:37:45.627 --> 00:37:49.596
YOU KNOW, BE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE  
ABOUT IT WHICH I THINK THE MORE 
WE ARE ABLE TO TALK IN TERMS

ABOUT IT WHICH I THINK THE MORE 
WE ARE ABLE TO TALK IN TERMS    
OF WHAT BUILDINGS LOOK LIKE AND 

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:53.867
WE ARE ABLE TO TALK IN TERMS    
OF WHAT BUILDINGS LOOK LIKE AND 
HOW THEY RELATE TO THE          

00:37:53.869 --> 00:37:54.667
OF WHAT BUILDINGS LOOK LIKE AND 
HOW THEY RELATE TO THE          
BUILDINGS ABOUT IT, THE LESS    

00:37:54.669 --> 00:37:57.270
HOW THEY RELATE TO THE          
BUILDINGS ABOUT IT, THE LESS    
CONTROVERSY THERE IS ABOUT      

00:37:57.272 --> 00:38:03.943

CONTROVERSY THERE IS ABOUT      
BUILDING EVOLUTION AND IN OUR   

00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:11.317
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE       
COMPLICATED BUT IT'S A LITTLE   
BIT EASIER TO DESIGN IT WOULD   

00:38:11.319 --> 00:38:12.418
COMPLICATED BUT IT'S A LITTLE   
BIT EASIER TO DESIGN IT WOULD   
CERTAINLY BE A LOVELY IDEA TO   

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.788
BIT EASIER TO DESIGN IT WOULD   
CERTAINLY BE A LOVELY IDEA TO   
HAVE ZONING BE CONSISTENT WITH  

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.758
CERTAINLY BE A LOVELY IDEA TO   
HAVE ZONING BE CONSISTENT WITH  
WHAT THE DC DOES RIGHT IN ITS   

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.625
HAVE ZONING BE CONSISTENT WITH  
WHAT THE DC DOES RIGHT IN ITS   
FORMED BASE EDNESS I MEAN THERE 

00:38:19.627 --> 00:38:23.028
WHAT THE DC DOES RIGHT IN ITS   
FORMED BASE EDNESS I MEAN THERE 
ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME

FORMED BASE EDNESS I MEAN THERE 
ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME     
CONFLICTS I THINK I'VE NEVER    

00:38:23.765 --> 00:38:26.566
ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME     
CONFLICTS I THINK I'VE NEVER    
SEEN ANY ZONING CODE THAT'S     

00:38:26.568 --> 00:38:30.536

SEEN ANY ZONING CODE THAT'S     
COMPLETELY CAPTURE DC DESIGN    

00:38:30.538 --> 00:38:34.240
SEEN ANY ZONING CODE THAT'S     
COMPLETELY CAPTURE DC DESIGN    
GUIDELINES BUT WE CAN DO BETTER 

00:38:34.242 --> 00:38:34.640
COMPLETELY CAPTURE DC DESIGN    
GUIDELINES BUT WE CAN DO BETTER 
FOR SURE.

I MEAN I THINK THE OTHER THING  
IS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE    

00:38:39.247 --> 00:38:41.848
I MEAN I THINK THE OTHER THING  
IS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE    
EVERYTHING DEFENSIBLE YOU KNOW  

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:42.848
IS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE
