AN APPLICANT HAS TO COME BEFORE 
US, HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING, SLOW 

00:34:13.715 --> 00:34:15.781
AN APPLICANT HAS TO COME BEFORE

US, HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING, SLOW 
EVERYTHING DOWN WHEN YOU KNOW   
IN A RACE AS A COMMUNITY WE&apos;VE  

00:34:16.651 --> 00:34:19.685
EVERYTHING DOWN WHEN YOU KNOW   
IN A RACE AS A COMMUNITY WE&apos;VE

CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THIS IS A 

00:34:20.455 --> 00:34:23.556

CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THIS IS A 
BIG PART OF IT AND EVERY HURDLE 

00:34:23.558 --> 00:34:24.490
CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THIS IS A 
BIG PART OF IT AND EVERY HURDLE 
THAT WE THROW UP AS AS A        

00:34:24.492 --> 00:34:27.560
BIG PART OF IT AND EVERY HURDLE 
THAT WE THROW UP AS AS A        
COMMUNITY MEANS HAPPENS THAT    

00:34:27.562 --> 00:34:27.960

MUCH SLOWER.

MUCH SLOWER.

00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:58.037
OF THEM THE CLOSEST ONE THAT

SO THE EVE WAS FACING THE       

00:47:58.039 --> 00:48:00.906
HOUSE HAD THE THE GABLE.        
SO THE EVE WAS FACING THE       
STREET IN THE HOUSE IN THIS     

00:48:00.908 --> 00:48:01.706
SO THE EVE WAS FACING THE       
STREET IN THE HOUSE IN THIS     
APPLICATION THE GABLES FACING   

00:48:01.708 --> 00:48:02.441
STREET IN THE HOUSE IN THIS     
APPLICATION THE GABLES FACING   
THE STREET THEY LOOK VERY       

00:48:02.443 --> 00:48:04.943
APPLICATION THE GABLES FACING   
THE STREET THEY LOOK VERY       
SIMILAR.                        

00:48:04.945 --> 00:48:06.078
THE STREET THEY LOOK VERY       
SIMILAR.                        
BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW IF THE  

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.013

BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW IF THE  
EVE IS FACING THE STREET IT&apos;S A 

00:48:07.015 --> 00:48:09.748
BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW IF THE  
EVE IS FACING THE STREET IT&apos;S A 
MUCH WIDER HOUSE TO THE STREET. 

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:12.151
EVE IS FACING THE STREET IT&apos;S A 
MUCH WIDER HOUSE TO THE STREET. 
SO THE ADDITION WAS IT LOOKS    

00:48:12.153 --> 00:48:12.952
MUCH WIDER HOUSE TO THE STREET. 
SO THE ADDITION WAS IT LOOKS    
WIDE BECAUSE IT&apos;S WIDE.         

00:48:12.954 --> 00:48:16.088
SO THE ADDITION WAS IT LOOKS    
WIDE BECAUSE IT&apos;S WIDE.         
IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE FACT 

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.022
WIDE BECAUSE IT&apos;S WIDE.         
IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE FACT 
THAT THE THE HOUSE IS ROTATED   

00:48:17.024 --> 00:48:20.593
IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE FACT 
THAT THE THE HOUSE IS ROTATED   
THIS HOUSE WITH THE GABLE       

00:48:20.595 --> 00:48:21.460
THAT THE THE HOUSE IS ROTATED   
THIS HOUSE WITH THE GABLE       
FACING THE STREET IT DOES HAVE  

00:48:21.462 --> 00:48:23.161
THIS HOUSE WITH THE GABLE       
FACING THE STREET IT DOES HAVE  
THE CROSS GABLE BUT THEN        

00:48:23.163 --> 00:48:23.929
FACING THE STREET IT DOES HAVE  
THE CROSS GABLE BUT THEN        
THERE&apos;S THE GABLE RETURNS AND   

00:48:23.931 --> 00:48:27.132
THE CROSS GABLE BUT THEN        
THERE&apos;S THE GABLE RETURNS AND   
SO THAT&apos;S WHY IT&apos;S IT&apos;S         

00:48:27.134 --> 00:48:34.840
THERE&apos;S THE GABLE RETURNS AND   
SO THAT&apos;S WHY IT&apos;S IT&apos;S         
NARROWER THE THE THE LANDED     

00:48:34.842 --> 00:48:35.741

FIGURED THAT WOULD BE COOL      
BECAUSE THE DRAWINGS IN THE     

00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:13.339

BECAUSE THE DRAWINGS IN THE     
RENDERINGS EVERYTHING SHOWING   

00:55:13.341 --> 00:55:14.172
BECAUSE THE DRAWINGS IN THE     
RENDERINGS EVERYTHING SHOWING   
WAS MORE MODERN AND HORIZONTAL  

00:55:14.174 --> 00:55:17.409
RENDERINGS EVERYTHING SHOWING

EITHER ONE WOULD BE FINE SO     
HOMEOWNERS JUST RECENTLY TOLD   
ME OUR MEMBERS TOLD ME THAT     

00:55:44.104 --> 00:55:44.903
HOMEOWNERS JUST RECENTLY TOLD   
ME OUR MEMBERS TOLD ME THAT     
PROBABLY THE MORE HORIZONTAL I  

00:55:44.905 --> 00:55:48.173
ME OUR MEMBERS TOLD ME THAT     
PROBABLY THE MORE HORIZONTAL I  
MEAN THE MORE VERTICAL          

00:55:48.175 --> 00:55:49.240
PROBABLY THE MORE HORIZONTAL I  
MEAN THE MORE VERTICAL          
COMPOSITE REALLY WOULD BE THE   

00:55:49.242 --> 00:55:52.978
MEAN THE MORE VERTICAL          
COMPOSITE REALLY WOULD BE THE   
ROUTE THEY WANT TO GO.          

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.112
COMPOSITE REALLY WOULD BE THE   
ROUTE THEY WANT TO GO.          
SO CONTRARY TO THE RENDERINGS   

00:55:54.114 --> 00:55:56.015

01:06:17.837 --> 01:06:21.872
REALLY CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING   
THIS PROJECT.                   
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, MAYBE    

01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:22.573
THIS PROJECT.                   
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, MAYBE    
THERE ARE EXAMPLES OUT THERE    

01:06:22.575 --> 01:06:25.843
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, MAYBE    
THERE ARE EXAMPLES OUT THERE    
WHERE A CERTAIN DESIGN WOULD    

01:06:25.845 --> 01:06:26.644
THERE ARE EXAMPLES OUT THERE    
WHERE A CERTAIN DESIGN WOULD    
NOT HAVE TO LOWER A ROOF BRIDGE 

01:06:26.646 --> 01:06:29.814
WHERE A CERTAIN DESIGN WOULD    
NOT HAVE TO LOWER A ROOF BRIDGE 
BUT I JUST THINK THAT GIVEN THE 

01:06:29.816 --> 01:06:30.682
NOT HAVE TO LOWER A ROOF BRIDGE 
BUT I JUST THINK THAT GIVEN THE 
DESIGN DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE 

01:06:30.684 --> 01:06:32.883
BUT I JUST THINK THAT GIVEN THE 
DESIGN DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE 
ON THIS PROJECT WHERE REALLY A  

01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:37.722
DESIGN DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE 
ON THIS PROJECT WHERE REALLY A  
LOT OF THE DETAILS OF THE HOUSE 

01:06:37.724 --> 01:06:38.489
ON THIS PROJECT WHERE REALLY A  
LOT OF THE DETAILS OF THE HOUSE 
ARE BEING UTILIZED IN THE       

01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:44.396
LOT OF THE DETAILS OF THE HOUSE 
ARE BEING UTILIZED IN THE       
ADDITION                        

01:06:58.244 --> 01:07:01.146
         AND SO COMPATIBILITY   
IS VERY HIGH SO THAT YOU KNOW,  
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHER       

01:07:01.148 --> 01:07:01.746
IS VERY HIGH SO THAT YOU KNOW,  
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHER       
COMPATIBILITY ADDITIONS.        

01:07:01.748 --> 01:07:02.414
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHER       
COMPATIBILITY ADDITIONS.        
SO THAT MEANS WELL WHERE&apos;S THE  

01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:03.147
COMPATIBILITY ADDITIONS.        
SO THAT MEANS WELL WHERE&apos;S THE  
DIFFERENTIATION COMING FROM?    

01:07:03.149 --> 01:07:03.948
SO THAT MEANS WELL WHERE&apos;S THE  
DIFFERENTIATION COMING FROM?    
AND SO I THINK THAT WAS KIND    

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:04.616
DIFFERENTIATION COMING FROM?    
AND SO I THINK THAT WAS KIND    
OF THE LAST OF THE PUZZLE       

01:07:04.618 --> 01:07:05.283
AND SO I THINK THAT WAS KIND    
OF THE LAST OF THE PUZZLE       
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE DESIGNER  

01:07:05.285 --> 01:07:06.084
OF THE LAST OF THE PUZZLE       
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE DESIGNER  
DID INSIST THAT THE ADDITION    

01:07:06.086 --> 01:07:06.685
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE DESIGNER  
DID INSIST THAT THE ADDITION    
AND THERE WAS A DECISION TO     

01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:07.418
DID INSIST THAT THE ADDITION    
AND THERE WAS A DECISION TO     
CHANGE MATERIALS ON THE FIRST   

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:07.786
AND THERE WAS A DECISION TO     
CHANGE MATERIALS ON THE FIRST   
FLOOR.                          

01:07:07.788 --> 01:07:08.453
CHANGE MATERIALS ON THE FIRST   
FLOOR.                          
BUT I THINK THE WINDOWS ARE     

01:07:08.455 --> 01:07:09.454
FLOOR.                          
BUT I THINK THE WINDOWS ARE     
VERY YOU KNOW, SIMILAR LOOK, I  

01:07:09.456 --> 01:07:11.522
BUT I THINK THE WINDOWS ARE     
VERY YOU KNOW, SIMILAR LOOK, I  
DIDN&apos;T HEAR IT WERE THE WINDOWS 

01:07:11.524 --> 01:07:12.389
VERY YOU KNOW, SIMILAR LOOK, I  
DIDN&apos;T HEAR IT WERE THE WINDOWS 
SIZED TO DIFFERENTIATE AT ALL?  

01:07:12.391 --> 01:07:15.927
DIDN&apos;T HEAR IT WERE THE WINDOWS 
SIZED TO DIFFERENTIATE AT ALL?  
YEAH, OK, SO THEY DECIDED TO    

01:07:15.929 --> 01:07:16.393
SIZED TO DIFFERENTIATE AT ALL?  
YEAH, OK, SO THEY DECIDED TO    
DIFFERENTIATE.                  

01:07:16.395 --> 01:07:17.128
YEAH, OK, SO THEY DECIDED TO    
DIFFERENTIATE.                  
SO ANYWAY, THAT JUST SEEMED     

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:19.964
DIFFERENTIATE.

I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,         
SOMETHING THAT THAT IS IS MAYBE 
A DISCUSSION ITEM IS THIS       

01:32:57.468 --> 01:33:00.936
SOMETHING THAT THAT IS IS MAYBE 
A DISCUSSION ITEM IS THIS       
EXISTING THAT IS REALLY GOING

A DISCUSSION ITEM IS THIS       
EXISTING THAT IS REALLY GOING   
TO GO AWAY.                     

01:33:01.339 --> 01:33:02.138
EXISTING THAT IS REALLY GOING   
TO GO AWAY.                     
SO THERE&apos;S LIKE THE TOP OF THE  

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:04.540
TO GO AWAY.                     
SO THERE&apos;S LIKE THE TOP OF THE  
HILL, THE BACKYARD IS KIND      

01:33:04.542 --> 01:33:05.408
SO THERE&apos;S LIKE THE TOP OF THE  
HILL, THE BACKYARD IS KIND      
OF FLAT AND THEN THERE&apos;S A VERY

BUT YOU KNOW, IF THAT WAS       

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:32.068

RENDERING IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO 
SEE THERE&apos;S PROBABLY ANOTHER    
DRAWING THAT SHOWS IT BUT THE   

01:47:55.966 --> 01:47:56.965
SEE THERE&apos;S PROBABLY ANOTHER    
DRAWING THAT SHOWS IT BUT THE   
OVERHANG OF THE ROOF AT THE     

01:47:56.967 --> 01:48:00.235
DRAWING THAT SHOWS IT BUT THE   
OVERHANG OF THE ROOF AT THE     
REAR OF THAT ADDITION IS IT     

01:48:00.237 --> 01:48:01.103
OVERHANG OF THE ROOF AT THE     
REAR OF THAT ADDITION IS IT     
DESIGNED TO MATCH THE OVERHANG  

01:48:01.105 --> 01:48:04.572
REAR OF THAT ADDITION IS IT     
DESIGNED TO MATCH THE OVERHANG  
ALONG THE SIDE SO THAT IT&apos;S THE 

01:48:04.574 --> 01:48:05.274
DESIGNED TO MATCH THE OVERHANG  
ALONG THE SIDE SO THAT IT&apos;S THE 
SAME DIMENSIONS ALL THE WAY     

01:48:05.276 --> 01:48:05.941
ALONG THE SIDE SO THAT IT&apos;S THE 
SAME DIMENSIONS ALL THE WAY     
AROUND IT WRAPS THAT WAY.       

01:48:05.943 --> 01:48:11.780
SAME DIMENSIONS ALL THE WAY     
AROUND IT WRAPS THAT WAY.       
YEAH                            

01:48:25.028 --> 01:48:27.296
    .                           
SO I AM PROPOSING THAT THE      
FASCIA DOESN&apos;T JOG FIVE INCHES  

01:48:27.298 --> 01:48:28.430
SO I AM PROPOSING THAT THE      
FASCIA DOESN&apos;T JOG FIVE INCHES  
LIKE THE EXTERIOR WALL FIVE     

01:48:28.432 --> 01:48:29.197
FASCIA DOESN&apos;T JOG FIVE INCHES  
LIKE THE EXTERIOR WALL FIVE     
INCHES SO I&apos;M CARRYING THE      

01:48:29.199 --> 01:48:30.098
LIKE THE EXTERIOR WALL FIVE     
INCHES SO I&apos;M CARRYING THE      
FASCIA STRETCH FROM THE FRONT   

01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:30.732
INCHES SO I&apos;M CARRYING THE      
FASCIA STRETCH FROM THE FRONT   
CONTINUOUSLY TO THE BACK.       

01:48:30.734 --> 01:48:31.466
FASCIA STRETCH FROM THE FRONT   
CONTINUOUSLY TO THE BACK.       
SO THEN THE OVERHANG GETS MORE  

01:48:31.468 --> 01:48:32.201
CONTINUOUSLY TO THE BACK.       
SO THEN THE OVERHANG GETS MORE  
YEAH A LITTLE MORE PROFOUND AS  

01:48:32.203 --> 01:48:32.667
SO THEN THE OVERHANG GETS MORE  
YEAH A LITTLE MORE PROFOUND AS  
YOU GO BACK.                    

01:48:32.669 --> 01:48:33.402
YEAH A LITTLE MORE PROFOUND AS  
YOU GO BACK.                    
OK, AND THE MAIN REASON BEHIND  

01:48:33.404 --> 01:48:34.202
YOU GO BACK.                    
OK, AND THE MAIN REASON BEHIND  
THAT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU    

01:48:34.204 --> 01:48:34.937
OK, AND THE MAIN REASON BEHIND  
THAT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU    
CAN&apos;T SEE AT TOP OF THE         

01:48:34.939 --> 01:48:35.871
THAT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU    
CAN&apos;T SEE AT TOP OF THE         
ROOF IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP     

01:48:35.873 --> 01:48:36.538
CAN&apos;T SEE AT TOP OF THE         
ROOF IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP     
OF THE GRAPH FROM SATELLITE     

01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:39.574
ROOF IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP     
OF THE GRAPH FROM SATELLITE     
VIEW YOU&apos;LL SEE AS A HEBRA.     

01:48:39.576 --> 01:48:43.445
OF THE GRAPH FROM SATELLITE     
VIEW YOU&apos;LL SEE AS A HEBRA.     
SO AT THE FRONT IT&apos;S A LOT      

01:48:43.447 --> 01:48:44.313
VIEW YOU&apos;LL SEE AS A HEBRA.     
SO AT THE FRONT IT&apos;S A LOT      
OF LIGHT TO RETURN TO THE FRONT 

01:48:44.315 --> 01:48:46.915
SO AT THE FRONT IT&apos;S A LOT      
OF LIGHT TO RETURN TO THE FRONT 
OF THE HOUSE AND THEN ON THE    

01:48:46.917 --> 01:48:48.083
OF LIGHT TO RETURN TO THE FRONT 
OF THE HOUSE AND THEN ON THE    
SIDE IT COMES DOWN ON THE BACK  

01:48:48.085 --> 01:48:50.318
OF THE HOUSE AND THEN ON THE    
SIDE IT COMES DOWN ON THE BACK  
SAME THING.                     

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:54.156
SIDE IT COMES DOWN ON THE BACK  
SAME THING.                     
SO THE NEW ROOF WILL ALSO BE A  

01:48:54.158 --> 01:48:54.623
SAME THING.                     
SO THE NEW ROOF WILL ALSO BE A  
BROKEN SHAPE.                   

01:48:54.625 --> 01:48:58.093
SO THE NEW ROOF WILL ALSO BE A  
BROKEN SHAPE.                   
SO IF I HAVE A FIVE INCH JOG    

01:48:58.095 --> 01:48:58.827
BROKEN SHAPE.                   
SO IF I HAVE A FIVE INCH JOG    
INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE ROOF  

01:48:58.829 --> 01:49:02.197
SO IF I HAVE A FIVE INCH JOG    
INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE ROOF  
IT WOULD THEN INCORPORATE A NEW 

01:49:02.199 --> 01:49:02.597
INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE ROOF  
IT WOULD THEN INCORPORATE A NEW 
HIP.                            

01:49:02.599 --> 01:49:02.998
IT WOULD THEN INCORPORATE A NEW 
HIP.                            
YEAH.                           

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:03.932
HIP.                            
YEAH.                           
WHICH MIGHT BE KIND OF AWKWARD  

01:49:03.934 --> 01:49:06.534
YEAH.                           
WHICH MIGHT BE KIND OF AWKWARD  
GIVEN THAT THIS IS LIKE         

01:49:06.536 --> 01:49:07.135
WHICH MIGHT BE KIND OF AWKWARD  
GIVEN THAT THIS IS LIKE         
STANDING ON A ROOF.             

01:49:07.137 --> 01:49:07.503
GIVEN THAT THIS IS LIKE         
STANDING ON A ROOF.             
YEAH.                           

01:49:07.505 --> 01:49:09.505
STANDING ON A ROOF.             
YEAH.                           
SO MY THOUGHT IS JUST LEAVE     

01:49:09.507 --> 01:49:10.305
YEAH.                           
SO MY THOUGHT IS JUST LEAVE     
THAT OFF AND CONTINUE THE       

01:49:10.307 --> 01:49:10.972
SO MY THOUGHT IS JUST LEAVE     
THAT OFF AND CONTINUE THE       
FASCIA STRAIGHT ACROSS THAT     

01:49:10.974 --> 01:49:14.042
THAT OFF AND CONTINUE THE       
FASCIA STRAIGHT ACROSS THAT     
SENSIBLE BUT THEN DO YOU MATCH  

01:49:14.044 --> 01:49:17.445
FASCIA STRAIGHT ACROSS THAT     
SENSIBLE BUT THEN DO YOU MATCH  
THE REAR OVERHANG TO THE        

01:49:17.447 --> 01:49:18.147
SENSIBLE BUT THEN DO YOU MATCH  
THE REAR OVERHANG TO THE        
BROADER OVERHANG FROM WHERE     

01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:21.483
THE REAR OVERHANG TO THE        
BROADER OVERHANG FROM WHERE     
THAT WHERE THE ADDITION NOT     

01:49:21.485 --> 01:49:22.618
BROADER OVERHANG FROM WHERE     
THAT WHERE THE ADDITION NOT     
JUST IN OR IS IT TIED TO THE    

01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:25.887
THAT WHERE THE ADDITION NOT     
JUST IN OR IS IT TIED TO THE    
OVERHANG OF THE ROOF AT THE     

01:49:25.889 --> 01:49:26.621
JUST IN OR IS IT TIED TO THE    
OVERHANG OF THE ROOF AT THE     
FRONT OF THE HOUSE I MATCHED    

01:49:26.623 --> 01:49:29.758
OVERHANG OF THE ROOF AT THE     
FRONT OF THE HOUSE I MATCHED    
THE REAR OVERHANG TO THE SIDE   

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:33.862
FRONT OF THE HOUSE I MATCHED

OF THE DEEPER SIDE OVERHANG SO  

01:49:33.864 --> 01:49:34.596

OF THE DEEPER SIDE OVERHANG SO  
THAT WHEN IT TURNS THE CORNER
