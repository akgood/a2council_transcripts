I WILL SAY THE PLAN DOES CALL   

00:21:41.315 --> 00:21:44.249
IS IN THE CARDS.                
I WILL SAY THE PLAN DOES CALL   
FOR A MORE ROBUST ROLLOUT.      

00:21:44.251 --> 00:21:45.217
I WILL SAY THE PLAN DOES CALL   
FOR A MORE ROBUST ROLLOUT.      
I THINK IT CALLS FOR ACTUALLY   

00:21:45.219 --> 00:21:47.820
FOR A MORE ROBUST ROLLOUT.      
I THINK IT CALLS FOR ACTUALLY   
UPWARDS OF FIVE HUNDRED         

00:21:47.822 --> 00:21:48.421
I THINK IT CALLS FOR ACTUALLY   
UPWARDS OF FIVE HUNDRED         
SCOOTERS AND FIVE HUNDRED       

00:21:48.423 --> 00:21:48.754
UPWARDS OF FIVE HUNDRED         
SCOOTERS AND FIVE HUNDRED       
BIKES.                          

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:50.922
SCOOTERS AND FIVE HUNDRED       
BIKES.                          
WE LIKE TO KIND OF GRADUALLY    

00:21:50.924 --> 00:21:51.990
BIKES.                          
WE LIKE TO KIND OF GRADUALLY    
EASE OUR WAY INTO THIS TO TRY   

00:21:51.992 --> 00:21:52.724
WE LIKE TO KIND OF GRADUALLY    
EASE OUR WAY INTO THIS TO TRY   
TO FIND A GOOD BALANCE AND YOU  

00:21:52.726 --> 00:21:55.494
EASE OUR WAY INTO THIS TO TRY   
TO FIND A GOOD BALANCE AND YOU  
KNOW, MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE      

00:21:55.496 --> 00:21:58.930
TO FIND A GOOD BALANCE AND YOU  
KNOW, MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE      
MEETING THE DESIRES OF THE      

00:21:58.932 --> 00:21:59.765
KNOW, MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE      
MEETING THE DESIRES OF THE      
COMMUNITY FOR THESE FORMS       

00:21:59.767 --> 00:22:00.399
MEETING THE DESIRES OF THE      
COMMUNITY FOR THESE FORMS       
OF TRANSPORTATION WITHOUT       

00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:01.133
COMMUNITY FOR THESE FORMS       
OF TRANSPORTATION WITHOUT       
HAVING TOO MANY ON THE STREETS. 

00:22:01.135 --> 00:22:03.535
OF TRANSPORTATION WITHOUT       
HAVING TOO MANY ON THE STREETS. 
SO WHETHER WE&apos;RE GETTING IT     

00:22:03.537 --> 00:22:04.270
HAVING TOO MANY ON THE STREETS. 
SO WHETHER WE&apos;RE GETTING IT     
RIGHT OR NOT IS MAYBE UP FOR    

00:22:04.272 --> 00:22:07.205
SO WHETHER WE&apos;RE GETTING IT     
RIGHT OR NOT IS MAYBE UP FOR    
DEBATE BUT AND ADMITTEDLY,      

00:22:07.207 --> 00:22:08.140
RIGHT OR NOT IS MAYBE UP FOR    
DEBATE BUT AND ADMITTEDLY,      
JULIE, WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO    

00:22:08.142 --> 00:22:08.841
DEBATE BUT AND ADMITTEDLY,      
JULIE, WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO    
SPAIN ABOUT WHAT THE FEE        

00:22:08.843 --> 00:22:11.610
JULIE, WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO    
SPAIN ABOUT WHAT THE FEE        
STRUCTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF    

00:22:11.612 --> 00:22:12.344
SPAIN ABOUT WHAT THE FEE        
STRUCTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF    
THERE WAS AUGMENTATION OF MORE  

00:22:12.346 --> 00:22:12.678
STRUCTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF    
THERE WAS AUGMENTATION OF MORE  
BIKES.                          

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.113
THERE WAS AUGMENTATION OF MORE  
BIKES.                          
&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SURE THAT WOULD BE A     

00:22:15.115 --> 00:22:15.881
BIKES.                          
&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SURE THAT WOULD BE A     
NEGOTIATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE  

00:22:15.883 --> 00:22:22.053
&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SURE THAT WOULD BE A     
NEGOTIATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE  
WHEN THAT TIME COMES IT DERMO.  

00:22:22.055 --> 00:22:25.891
NEGOTIATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE  
WHEN THAT TIME COMES IT DERMO.  
SO I HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE    

00:22:25.893 --> 00:22:26.758
WHEN THAT TIME COMES IT DERMO.  
SO I HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE    
RANGE TOO AND WELL FIRST        

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.294
SO I HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE    
RANGE TOO AND WELL FIRST        
OF ALL, THIS IS EXCITING.       

00:22:29.296 --> 00:22:30.196
RANGE TOO AND WELL FIRST        
OF ALL, THIS IS EXCITING.       
HE SAID THE RANGE IS THE SAME   

00:22:30.198 --> 00:22:31.063
OF ALL, THIS IS EXCITING.       
HE SAID THE RANGE IS THE SAME   
FOR SCOOTERS BUT I&apos;M NOT REALLY 

00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:33.265
HE SAID THE RANGE IS THE SAME   
FOR SCOOTERS BUT I&apos;M NOT REALLY 
AWARE WHAT THE RANGES FOR THE   

00:22:33.267 --> 00:22:33.532
FOR SCOOTERS BUT I&apos;M NOT REALLY 
AWARE WHAT THE RANGES FOR THE   
SCOOTER.                        

00:22:33.534 --> 00:22:34.399
AWARE WHAT THE RANGES FOR THE   
SCOOTER.                        
SO WHAT IS THE KIND             

00:22:34.401 --> 00:22:37.103
SCOOTER.                        
SO WHAT IS THE KIND             
OF GEOGRAPHIC RANGE FOR USE SO  

00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:41.674
SO WHAT IS THE KIND             
OF GEOGRAPHIC RANGE FOR USE SO  
I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT THERE ARE ANY 

00:22:41.676 --> 00:22:42.408
OF GEOGRAPHIC RANGE FOR USE SO  
I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT THERE ARE ANY 
I&apos;D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK.       

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.378
I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT THERE ARE ANY 
I&apos;D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK.       
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE IS A OUTER  

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.514
I&apos;D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK.       
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE IS A OUTER  
LIMIT BY WHICH YOU KNOW, THE    

00:22:49.516 --> 00:22:50.049
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE IS A OUTER  
LIMIT BY WHICH YOU KNOW, THE    
VEHICLES CAN&apos;T BE USED.         

00:22:50.051 --> 00:22:51.050
LIMIT BY WHICH YOU KNOW, THE    
VEHICLES CAN&apos;T BE USED.         
I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES  

00:22:51.052 --> 00:22:53.452
VEHICLES CAN&apos;T BE USED.         
I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES  
FOR EXAMPLE BY THE WASHINGTON   

00:22:53.454 --> 00:22:54.252
I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES  
FOR EXAMPLE BY THE WASHINGTON   
AREA TRANSPORTATION STUDY ABOUT 

00:22:54.254 --> 00:22:56.989
FOR EXAMPLE BY THE WASHINGTON   
AREA TRANSPORTATION STUDY ABOUT 
A SORT OF SEAMLESS SYSTEM       

00:22:56.991 --> 00:22:57.990
AREA TRANSPORTATION STUDY ABOUT 
A SORT OF SEAMLESS SYSTEM       
BETWEEN US AND IPSI OR EASTERN  

00:22:57.992 --> 00:23:00.426
A SORT OF SEAMLESS SYSTEM       
BETWEEN US AND IPSI OR EASTERN  
MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY FOR FOLKS   

00:23:00.428 --> 00:23:01.226
BETWEEN US AND IPSI OR EASTERN  
MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY FOR FOLKS   
THAT WANT TO MAKE THOSE TRIPS.  

00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:04.563
MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY FOR FOLKS   
THAT WANT TO MAKE THOSE TRIPS.  
I THINK THERE&apos;S PROBABLY SOME   

00:23:04.565 --> 00:23:08.266
THAT WANT TO MAKE THOSE TRIPS.  
I THINK THERE&apos;S PROBABLY SOME   
BATTERY RANGE LIMITATIONS SINCE 

00:23:08.268 --> 00:23:08.967
I THINK THERE&apos;S PROBABLY SOME   
BATTERY RANGE LIMITATIONS SINCE 
THESE ARE BATTERY ASSISTS THAT  

00:23:08.969 --> 00:23:12.670
BATTERY RANGE LIMITATIONS SINCE 
THESE ARE BATTERY ASSISTS THAT  
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY THOSE      

00:23:12.672 --> 00:23:13.405
THESE ARE BATTERY ASSISTS THAT  
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY THOSE      
BATTERIES WILL WILL KIND OF RUN 

00:23:13.407 --> 00:23:16.474
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY THOSE      
BATTERIES WILL WILL KIND OF RUN 
OUT OF JUICE AND AND THEREFORE  

00:23:16.476 --> 00:23:17.209
BATTERIES WILL WILL KIND OF RUN 
OUT OF JUICE AND AND THEREFORE  
WITH A BIKE AT LEAST YOU CAN    

00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:17.976
OUT OF JUICE AND AND THEREFORE  
WITH A BIKE AT LEAST YOU CAN    
CONTINUE TO PEDAL WITH THE      

00:23:17.978 --> 00:23:20.112
WITH A BIKE AT LEAST YOU CAN    
CONTINUE TO PEDAL WITH THE      
SCOOTER.                        

00:23:20.114 --> 00:23:21.313
CONTINUE TO PEDAL WITH THE      
SCOOTER.                        
&gt;&gt; WHAT YOU CAN DO IS KICK IT   

00:23:21.315 --> 00:23:21.713
SCOOTER.                        
&gt;&gt; WHAT YOU CAN DO IS KICK IT   
THROUGH.                        

00:23:21.715 --> 00:23:24.649
&gt;&gt; WHAT YOU CAN DO IS KICK IT   
THROUGH.                        
SO I ONLY KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT   

00:23:24.651 --> 00:23:25.451
THROUGH.                        
SO I ONLY KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT   
THERE ARE SOME GEO FENCED AREAS 

00:23:25.453 --> 00:23:27.252
SO I ONLY KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT   
THERE ARE SOME GEO FENCED AREAS 
AROUND THE DIAG OR SCOOTER      

00:23:27.254 --> 00:23:27.586
THERE ARE SOME GEO FENCED AREAS 
AROUND THE DIAG OR SCOOTER      
USAGE.                          

00:23:27.588 --> 00:23:28.586
AROUND THE DIAG OR SCOOTER      
USAGE.                          
BUT BEYOND THAT I DON&apos;T THINK   

00:23:28.588 --> 00:23:31.823
USAGE.                          
BUT BEYOND THAT I DON&apos;T THINK   
THERE&apos;S AN OUTER LIMIT TO HOW   

00:23:31.825 --> 00:23:32.423
BUT BEYOND THAT I DON&apos;T THINK   
THERE&apos;S AN OUTER LIMIT TO HOW   
FAR FOLKS CAN GO.               

00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:33.359
THERE&apos;S AN OUTER LIMIT TO HOW   
FAR FOLKS CAN GO.               
&gt;&gt; I CAN DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT   

00:23:33.361 --> 00:23:35.226
FAR FOLKS CAN GO.               
&gt;&gt; I CAN DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT   
THOUGH.                         

00:23:35.228 --> 00:23:36.594
&gt;&gt; I CAN DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT   
THOUGH.                         
&gt;&gt; OK, I GOT A COUPLE MORE      

00:23:36.596 --> 00:23:38.163
THOUGH.                         
&gt;&gt; OK, I GOT A COUPLE MORE      
QUESTIONS.

REFINE SOME OF OUR NETWORK?     
THEY DO, YEAH.

WHAT WE CAN DO IS TAKE AREAS    
AND SHOW WHERE THE USAGE IS THE 

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.499
WHAT WE CAN DO IS TAKE AREAS    
AND SHOW WHERE THE USAGE IS THE 
STRONGEST, WHERE TRIPS ARE      

00:24:14.501 --> 00:24:15.300
AND SHOW WHERE THE USAGE IS THE 
STRONGEST, WHERE TRIPS ARE      
ORIGINATING FROM, WHERE THEY&apos;RE 

00:24:15.302 --> 00:24:17.802
STRONGEST, WHERE TRIPS ARE

EXACTLY WHAT THAT STANDS FOR.   
I THINK IT&apos;S LIKE THE SHARED BY

THESE SHARED MICRO MOBILITY&apos;S I 

00:24:46.099 --> 00:24:47.999
NATIONAL STANDARD FOR DATA FOR  
THESE SHARED MICRO MOBILITY&apos;S I 
THINK WAS DEVELOPED IN L.A. I   

00:24:48.001 --> 00:24:48.700
THESE SHARED MICRO MOBILITY&apos;S I 
THINK WAS DEVELOPED IN L.A. I   
REMEMBER CORRECTLY WE DON&apos;T     

00:24:48.702 --> 00:24:51.703
THINK WAS DEVELOPED IN L.A. I   
REMEMBER CORRECTLY WE DON&apos;T     
HAVE THE ABILITY TO INGEST THAT 

00:24:51.705 --> 00:24:52.371
REMEMBER CORRECTLY WE DON&apos;T     
HAVE THE ABILITY TO INGEST THAT 
DATA KIND OF THE RAW DATA.      

00:24:52.373 --> 00:24:53.471
HAVE THE ABILITY TO INGEST THAT

GETTING TO THAT POINT AND AT    
THIS POINT I REALLY DO WANT TO  

00:56:34.038 --> 00:56:42.979
GETTING TO THAT POINT AND AT    
THIS POINT I REALLY DO WANT TO  
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAD GREAT,  

00:56:42.981 --> 00:56:47.016
THIS POINT I REALLY DO WANT TO  
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAD GREAT,  
GREAT REPRESENTATION FROM OUR

PROCESS AND THAT WAS LARRY AND  
THAT HE WAS REALLY VALUABLE,    

00:56:52.057 --> 00:56:55.091
PROCESS AND THAT WAS LARRY AND  
THAT HE WAS REALLY VALUABLE,    
INVALUABLE AND SO JUST REALLY   

00:56:55.093 --> 00:56:58.495
THAT HE WAS REALLY VALUABLE,

00:57:26.791 --> 00:57:34.765
              BUT SO MOVING ON  
TO THE NEXT SLIDE, I WANTED TO  
GIVE A

CROSSWALKS AND ONE IS FOR       
UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS AND AS  
WE WERE DEVELOPING THIS PROCESS 

00:58:09.901 --> 00:58:10.900
UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS AND AS  
WE WERE DEVELOPING THIS PROCESS 
WE REALLY WANTED TO BE FORWARD  

00:58:10.902 --> 00:58:14.071
WE WERE DEVELOPING THIS PROCESS 
WE REALLY WANTED TO BE FORWARD  
THINKING AND PROGRESSIVE AND    

00:58:14.073 --> 00:58:15.171
WE REALLY WANTED TO BE FORWARD  
THINKING AND PROGRESSIVE AND    
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE 

00:58:15.173 --> 00:58:16.005
THINKING AND PROGRESSIVE AND    
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE 
DID WAS WE DECIDED THAT WE      

00:58:16.007 --> 00:58:18.742
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE 
DID WAS WE DECIDED THAT WE      
DIDN&apos;T NEED A MINIMUM NUMBER    

00:58:18.744 --> 00:58:22.245
DID WAS WE DECIDED THAT WE      
DIDN&apos;T NEED A MINIMUM NUMBER    
OF PEDESTRIANS TO INSTALL A

CROSSWALK AT THE TIME THERE WAS 

00:58:25.784 --> 00:58:26.582
OF PEDESTRIANS TO INSTALL A     
CROSSWALK AT THE TIME THERE WAS 
AND A BEST PRACTICE

CROSSWALK AT THE TIME THERE WAS 
AND A BEST PRACTICE             
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SORT        

00:58:29.954 --> 00:58:30.721
AND A BEST PRACTICE             
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SORT        
OF POLICY THAT A LOT            

00:58:30.723 --> 00:58:33.623
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SORT        
OF POLICY THAT A LOT            
OF AGENCIES HAD TOWARD HAVING A

OF POLICY THAT A LOT            
OF AGENCIES HAD TOWARD HAVING A 
MINIMUM NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS   

00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:37.728
OF AGENCIES HAD TOWARD HAVING A 
MINIMUM NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS   
TO INSTALL A CROSSWALK.         

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:41.364
MINIMUM NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS   
TO INSTALL A CROSSWALK.         
&gt;&gt; WE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT OFTEN   

00:58:41.366 --> 00:58:45.869
TO INSTALL A CROSSWALK.         
&gt;&gt; WE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT OFTEN   
CORRIDOR CAN BE A BARRIER TO    

00:58:45.871 --> 00:58:49.372
&gt;&gt; WE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT OFTEN   
CORRIDOR CAN BE A BARRIER TO    
NON MOTORIZED ACTIVITY AND WE   

00:58:49.374 --> 00:58:50.073
CORRIDOR CAN BE A BARRIER TO    
NON MOTORIZED ACTIVITY AND WE   
DIDN&apos;T WANT TO PERPETUATE       

00:58:50.075 --> 00:58:53.576
NON MOTORIZED ACTIVITY AND WE   
DIDN&apos;T WANT TO PERPETUATE       
BARRIERS AND WE WANTED TO LOOK  

00:58:53.578 --> 00:58:57.514
DIDN&apos;T WANT TO PERPETUATE       
BARRIERS AND WE WANTED TO LOOK  
AT THE SYSTEM AND SEE IF IN THE 

00:58:57.516 --> 00:58:58.315
BARRIERS AND WE WANTED TO LOOK  
AT THE SYSTEM AND SEE IF IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM DOES A    

00:58:58.317 --> 00:59:01.350
AT THE SYSTEM AND SEE IF IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM DOES A    
CONNECTION POINT MAKE HERE.     

00:59:01.352 --> 00:59:02.385
CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM DOES A    
CONNECTION POINT MAKE HERE.     
SO WE TOOK THAT DECISION OUT    

00:59:02.387 --> 00:59:05.555
CONNECTION POINT MAKE HERE.     
SO WE TOOK THAT DECISION OUT    
THAT OUT OF THE GUIDELINES AND  

00:59:05.557 --> 00:59:06.223
SO WE TOOK THAT DECISION OUT    
THAT OUT OF THE GUIDELINES AND  
THAT IS YOU KNOW, STAFF         

00:59:06.225 --> 00:59:09.559
THAT OUT OF THE GUIDELINES AND  
THAT IS YOU KNOW, STAFF         
EVALUATE EVERY REQUEST THAT WE  

00:59:09.561 --> 00:59:12.962
THAT IS YOU KNOW, STAFF         
EVALUATE EVERY REQUEST THAT WE  
GET FOR A NEW CROSSWALK AND     

00:59:12.964 --> 00:59:13.997
EVALUATE EVERY REQUEST THAT WE  
GET FOR A NEW CROSSWALK AND     
DETERMINE IF IT MAKES SENSE IN  

00:59:13.999 --> 00:59:14.664
GET FOR A NEW CROSSWALK AND     
DETERMINE IF IT MAKES SENSE IN  
THE CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM.      

00:59:14.666 --> 00:59:16.666
DETERMINE IF IT MAKES SENSE IN  
THE CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM.      
&gt;&gt; SO THIS PROCESS REALLY       

00:59:16.668 --> 00:59:20.604
THE CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM.      
&gt;&gt; SO THIS PROCESS REALLY       
STARTS AFTER HAVING MADE THE    

00:59:20.606 --> 00:59:21.338
&gt;&gt; SO THIS PROCESS REALLY       
STARTS AFTER HAVING MADE THE    
DECISION THAT YES, WE&apos;RE        

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:24.073
STARTS AFTER HAVING MADE THE    
DECISION THAT YES, WE&apos;RE        
INSTALLING A CROSSWALK HERE OR  

00:59:24.075 --> 00:59:25.175
DECISION THAT YES, WE&apos;RE        
INSTALLING A CROSSWALK HERE OR  
IT STARTS AT THE POINT WHERE WE 

00:59:25.177 --> 00:59:25.976
INSTALLING A CROSSWALK HERE OR  
IT STARTS AT THE POINT WHERE WE 
HAVE AN EXISTING CROSSWALK AND  

00:59:25.978 --> 00:59:32.348
IT STARTS AT THE POINT WHERE WE 
HAVE AN EXISTING CROSSWALK AND  
WE&apos;RE EVALUATING I WILL ALSO    

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:36.553
HAVE AN EXISTING CROSSWALK AND  
WE&apos;RE EVALUATING I WILL ALSO    
POINT OUT THAT THAT ONE OF THE  

00:59:36.555 --> 00:59:40.690
WE&apos;RE EVALUATING I WILL ALSO    
POINT OUT THAT THAT ONE OF THE  
TOOLS THAT WE USE IS THE NC HRP 

00:59:40.692 --> 00:59:44.795
POINT OUT THAT THAT ONE OF THE  
TOOLS THAT WE USE IS THE NC HRP 
560 TO REPORT NOT IN HRP STANDS 

00:59:44.797 --> 00:59:47.997
TOOLS THAT WE USE IS THE NC HRP

WE USE THAT NUMBER BUT WE       
ALWAYS FEED THAT MINIMUM SO     
THAT WE CAN PROCEED WITH THE    

01:01:03.676 --> 01:01:06.943
ALWAYS FEED THAT MINIMUM SO     
THAT WE CAN PROCEED WITH THE    
ANALYSIS JUST AS A KIND         

01:01:06.945 --> 01:01:10.646
THAT WE CAN PROCEED WITH THE    
ANALYSIS JUST AS A KIND         
OF DISCLAIMER THAT SOME OF OUR  

01:01:10.648 --> 01:01:14.083
ANALYSIS JUST AS A KIND         
OF DISCLAIMER THAT SOME OF OUR  
CONSULTANTS HAVE THAT WE WORK   

01:01:14.085 --> 01:01:15.118
OF DISCLAIMER THAT SOME OF OUR  
CONSULTANTS HAVE THAT WE WORK   
HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFICULTY  

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.354
CONSULTANTS HAVE THAT WE WORK   
HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFICULTY  
WITH THAT BUT THAT&apos;S ALWAYS THE 

01:01:18.356 --> 01:01:18.989
HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFICULTY  
WITH THAT BUT THAT&apos;S ALWAYS THE 
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE GIVE     

01:01:18.991 --> 01:01:19.790
WITH THAT BUT THAT&apos;S ALWAYS THE 
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE GIVE     
THEM BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO BE 

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:24.494
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE GIVE     
THEM BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO BE 
USING THE OUTPUT OF THE TOOL.   

01:01:24.496 --> 01:01:25.495
THEM BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO BE 
USING THE OUTPUT OF THE TOOL.   
&gt;&gt; SO AS I SAID WITH THIS       

01:01:25.497 --> 01:01:28.699
USING THE OUTPUT OF THE TOOL.   
&gt;&gt; SO AS I SAID WITH THIS       
PROCESS IT LOOKS TO A LOT       

01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:29.432
&gt;&gt; SO AS I SAID WITH THIS       
PROCESS IT LOOKS TO A LOT       
OF DIFFERENT FACTORS AND THEN   

01:01:29.434 --> 01:01:32.969
PROCESS IT LOOKS TO A LOT       
OF DIFFERENT FACTORS AND THEN   
YOU LOOKING AT THE VOLUME IN    

01:01:32.971 --> 01:01:35.872
OF DIFFERENT FACTORS AND THEN   
YOU LOOKING AT THE VOLUME IN    
THE CRASH HISTORY AND THE       

01:01:35.874 --> 01:01:36.606
YOU LOOKING AT THE VOLUME IN    
THE CRASH HISTORY AND THE       
CONTEXT THAT WE&apos;RE DESIGNING    

01:01:36.608 --> 01:01:39.609
THE CRASH HISTORY AND THE       
CONTEXT THAT WE&apos;RE DESIGNING    
AND IT FEEDS INTO GIVING US     

01:01:39.611 --> 01:01:40.410
CONTEXT THAT WE&apos;RE DESIGNING    
AND IT FEEDS INTO GIVING US     
THIS OUTPUT OF ONE OF THESE     

01:01:40.412 --> 01:01:43.446
AND IT FEEDS INTO GIVING US     
THIS OUTPUT OF ONE OF THESE     
THREE STANDARD DESIGN OPTIONS   

01:01:43.448 --> 01:01:44.380
THIS OUTPUT OF ONE OF THESE     
THREE STANDARD DESIGN OPTIONS   
STANDARD PLUS DESIGN OPTIONS OR 

01:01:44.382 --> 01:01:47.784
THREE STANDARD DESIGN OPTIONS   
STANDARD PLUS DESIGN OPTIONS OR 
THE HIGH-RISK DESIGN OPTIONS.   

01:01:47.786 --> 01:01:51.187
STANDARD PLUS DESIGN OPTIONS OR 
THE HIGH-RISK DESIGN OPTIONS.   
&gt;&gt; SO THAT STANDARD IS REALLY   

01:01:51.189 --> 01:01:52.188
THE HIGH-RISK DESIGN OPTIONS.   
&gt;&gt; SO THAT STANDARD IS REALLY   
THE BASELINE THAT WE WILL       

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:56.025
&gt;&gt; SO THAT STANDARD IS REALLY   
THE BASELINE THAT WE WILL       
ACCEPT ON ANY TYPE OF ROADWAY   

01:01:56.027 --> 01:01:59.962
THE BASELINE THAT WE WILL       
ACCEPT ON ANY TYPE OF ROADWAY   
AND WE DO THIS BOTH FOR THE     

01:01:59.964 --> 01:02:03.066
ACCEPT ON ANY TYPE OF ROADWAY   
AND WE DO THIS BOTH FOR THE     
UNCONTROL CROSSWALKS AND FOR    

01:02:03.068 --> 01:02:03.733
AND WE DO THIS BOTH FOR THE     
UNCONTROL CROSSWALKS AND FOR    
THE CONTROL CROSSWALKS.         

01:02:03.735 --> 01:02:07.403
UNCONTROL CROSSWALKS AND FOR    
THE CONTROL CROSSWALKS.         
&gt;&gt; SO LET&apos;S GO AHEAD AND MOVE   

01:02:07.405 --> 01:02:08.237
THE CONTROL CROSSWALKS.         
&gt;&gt; SO LET&apos;S GO AHEAD AND MOVE   
FORWARD TO THE NEXT SLIDE WHICH 

01:02:08.239 --> 01:02:11.074
&gt;&gt; SO LET&apos;S GO AHEAD AND MOVE   
FORWARD TO THE NEXT SLIDE WHICH 
REALLY SHOWS US WHAT THOSE      

01:02:11.076 --> 01:02:14.510
FORWARD TO THE NEXT SLIDE WHICH 
REALLY SHOWS US WHAT THOSE      
DESIGN OPTIONS ARE.             

01:02:14.512 --> 01:02:19.249
REALLY SHOWS US WHAT THOSE      
DESIGN OPTIONS ARE.             
AS I SAID, THE SLIDE IT&apos;S IT    

01:02:19.251 --> 01:02:20.116
DESIGN OPTIONS ARE.             
AS I SAID, THE SLIDE IT&apos;S IT    
GOES THROUGH DESIGN OPTIONS AND 

01:02:20.118 --> 01:02:23.519
AS I SAID, THE SLIDE IT&apos;S IT    
GOES THROUGH DESIGN OPTIONS AND 
THIS IS THE DESIGN SELECTION    

01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:24.153
GOES THROUGH DESIGN OPTIONS AND 
THIS IS THE DESIGN SELECTION    
FOR UNCONTROL CROSSWALKS.       

01:02:24.155 --> 01:02:26.856
THIS IS THE DESIGN SELECTION    
FOR UNCONTROL CROSSWALKS.       
THE SLIDE READS THAT WE SELECT  

01:02:26.858 --> 01:02:27.624
FOR UNCONTROL CROSSWALKS.       
THE SLIDE READS THAT WE SELECT  
DEVICES BASED ON STREET TYPE    

01:02:27.626 --> 01:02:30.960
THE SLIDE READS THAT WE SELECT  
DEVICES BASED ON STREET TYPE    
AND DESIGN LEVEL ITEMS          

01:02:30.962 --> 01:02:34.864
DEVICES BASED ON STREET TYPE    
AND DESIGN LEVEL ITEMS          
ACCUMULATE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT   

01:02:34.866 --> 01:02:35.765
AND DESIGN LEVEL ITEMS          
ACCUMULATE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT   
AND NOT ALL DEVICES WILL BE     

01:02:35.767 --> 01:02:38.935

AND NOT ALL DEVICES WILL BE     
USED IN ALL LOCATIONS.          
&gt;&gt; SO YOU IF WE LOOK AT THAT    

01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:49.312

01:05:32.878 --> 01:05:35.945
GUIDELINES.                     
&gt;&gt; NOW KEEP IN MIND WE FINISHED 
THOSE UP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.     

01:05:35.947 --> 01:05:36.979
&gt;&gt; NOW KEEP IN MIND WE FINISHED 
THOSE UP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.     
&gt;&gt; WE STARTED USING THEM        

01:05:36.981 --> 01:05:39.982
THOSE UP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.     
&gt;&gt; WE STARTED USING THEM        
IMMEDIATELY WITHIN OUR OUR OWN  

01:05:39.984 --> 01:05:44.086
&gt;&gt; WE STARTED USING THEM        
IMMEDIATELY WITHIN OUR OUR OWN  
DESIGN WORK AND THEN AS WE      

01:05:44.088 --> 01:05:44.787
IMMEDIATELY WITHIN OUR OUR OWN  
DESIGN WORK AND THEN AS WE      
STARTED USING THEM AND FINDING  

01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:47.557
DESIGN WORK AND THEN AS WE      
STARTED USING THEM AND FINDING  
THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE        

01:05:47.559 --> 01:05:48.291
STARTED USING THEM AND FINDING  
THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE        
STARTED INCORPORATING THEM INTO 

01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:51.761
THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE        
STARTED INCORPORATING THEM INTO 
OTHER WORK AS WELL.             

01:05:51.763 --> 01:05:52.695
STARTED INCORPORATING THEM INTO 
OTHER WORK AS WELL.             
&gt;&gt; SO THIS SLIDE READS          

01:05:52.697 --> 01:05:55.331
OTHER WORK AS WELL.             
&gt;&gt; SO THIS SLIDE READS          
ACCOMPLISHMENTS SYSTEMWIDE      

01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:56.198
&gt;&gt; SO THIS SLIDE READS          
ACCOMPLISHMENTS SYSTEMWIDE      
UPDATES TO MEET OR EXCEED       

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.602

01:06:02.607 --> 01:06:03.539
MAJOR STREETS.                  
&gt;&gt; SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 
BIG PROJECTS THAT WE DID WITH   

01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:04.074
&gt;&gt; SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 
BIG PROJECTS THAT WE DID WITH   
THESE CROSSWALK DESIGN          

01:06:04.076 --> 01:06:07.510

THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND ANALYZE 

01:06:11.516 --> 01:06:12.515
&gt;&gt; WE LOOKED AT CORRIDORS       
THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND ANALYZE 
THEM TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WHAT   

01:06:12.517 --> 01:06:13.316
THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND ANALYZE 
THEM TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WHAT   
THE MINIMUM FOR THAT CORRIDOR   

01:06:13.318 --> 01:06:15.618
THEM TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WHAT   
THE MINIMUM FOR THAT CORRIDOR   
WAS AND MADE SURE HAD           

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.255
THE MINIMUM FOR THAT CORRIDOR   
WAS AND MADE SURE HAD           
WE&apos;RE MEETING AT LEAST THE

STREETS SINCE THEN WE STARTED   

01:06:23.195 --> 01:06:23.927
MINIMUM ON ALL THE MAJOR        
STREETS SINCE THEN WE STARTED   
UPGRADING SOME OF THOSE         

01:06:23.929 --> 01:06:26.796
STREETS SINCE THEN WE STARTED   
UPGRADING SOME OF THOSE         
CROSSWALKS BUT WE DID MEET THAT 

01:06:26.798 --> 01:06:30.466
UPGRADING SOME OF THOSE         
CROSSWALKS BUT WE DID MEET THAT 
BASELINE FIRST ANOTHER

CROSSWALKS BUT WE DID MEET THAT 
BASELINE FIRST ANOTHER          
ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT WE HAVE IS  

01:06:31.403 --> 01:06:32.202
BASELINE FIRST ANOTHER          
ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT WE HAVE IS

PROCESS.                        
SO INTERNALLY TRANSPORTATION    
STAFF ARE ALWAYS USING THESE    

01:06:39.577 --> 01:06:46.482
SO INTERNALLY TRANSPORTATION    
STAFF ARE ALWAYS USING THESE    
AND WHEN OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE 

01:06:46.484 --> 01:06:47.316
STAFF ARE ALWAYS USING THESE    
AND WHEN OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE 
THE CAPITAL PROJECT MANAGERS OR 

01:06:47.318 --> 01:06:49.752
AND WHEN OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE 
THE CAPITAL PROJECT MANAGERS OR 
IN OUR DESIGN TEAM THEY KNOW    

01:06:49.754 --> 01:06:50.754
THE CAPITAL PROJECT MANAGERS OR 
IN OUR DESIGN TEAM THEY KNOW    
THAT THESE EXIST AND IF WE HAVE 

01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:51.521
IN OUR DESIGN TEAM THEY KNOW    
THAT THESE EXIST AND IF WE HAVE 
A CROSSWALK THEY KNOW THAT WE   

01:06:51.523 --> 01:06:54.390
THAT THESE EXIST AND IF WE HAVE 
A CROSSWALK THEY KNOW THAT WE   
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE    

01:06:54.392 --> 01:06:55.124
A CROSSWALK THEY KNOW THAT WE   
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE    
EVALUATING THOSE AS PART        

01:06:55.126 --> 01:06:57.694
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE    
EVALUATING THOSE AS PART        
OF PROJECT.                     

01:06:57.696 --> 01:06:58.694
EVALUATING THOSE AS PART        
OF PROJECT.                     
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THIS     

01:06:58.696 --> 01:07:01.597
OF PROJECT.                     
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THIS     
LAST BULLET POINT WHICH IS      

01:07:01.599 --> 01:07:02.232
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THIS     
LAST BULLET POINT WHICH IS      
INTEGRATION OF TRANSPORTATION   

01:07:02.234 --> 01:07:06.235
LAST BULLET POINT WHICH IS      
INTEGRATION OF TRANSPORTATION   
IMPACT ANALYSIS WELL I GUESS I  

01:07:06.237 --> 01:07:06.903
INTEGRATION OF TRANSPORTATION   
IMPACT ANALYSIS WELL I GUESS I  
SHOULD SAY INTEGRATION WITH     

01:07:06.905 --> 01:07:09.939
IMPACT ANALYSIS WELL I GUESS I  
SHOULD SAY INTEGRATION WITH     
TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS  

01:07:09.941 --> 01:07:10.573
SHOULD SAY INTEGRATION WITH     
TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS  
FOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS     

01:07:10.575 --> 01:07:13.642
TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS  
FOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS     
DURING THE SITE PLAN REVIEW.    

01:07:13.644 --> 01:07:14.677
FOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS     
DURING THE SITE PLAN REVIEW.    
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT   

01:07:14.679 --> 01:07:16.846
DURING THE SITE PLAN REVIEW.    
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT   
STEP BECAUSE AT THE TIME        

01:07:16.848 --> 01:07:24.688
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT   
STEP BECAUSE AT THE TIME        
WASN&apos;T A GOOD WAY TO THERE      

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:27.723
STEP BECAUSE AT THE TIME        
WASN&apos;T A GOOD WAY TO THERE      
WASN&apos;T A GOOD RESOURCE TO POINT 

01:07:27.725 --> 01:07:32.795
WASN&apos;T A GOOD WAY TO THERE      
WASN&apos;T A GOOD RESOURCE TO POINT 
AN APPLICANT&apos;S TEAM TOWARDS FOR 

01:07:32.797 --> 01:07:33.596
WASN&apos;T A GOOD RESOURCE TO POINT 
AN APPLICANT&apos;S TEAM TOWARDS FOR 
DETERMINING WHAT THEIR IMPACTS  

01:07:33.598 --> 01:07:36.399
AN APPLICANT&apos;S TEAM TOWARDS FOR 
DETERMINING WHAT THEIR IMPACTS  
TO AN UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALK    

01:07:36.401 --> 01:07:36.866
DETERMINING WHAT THEIR IMPACTS  
TO AN UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALK    
MIGHT BE.                       

01:07:36.868 --> 01:07:37.567
TO AN UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALK    
MIGHT BE.                       
&gt;&gt; SO IF YOU HAVE UNCONTROLLED  

01:07:37.569 --> 01:07:39.968
MIGHT BE.                       
&gt;&gt; SO IF YOU HAVE UNCONTROLLED  
CROSSWALKS IN THEIR STUDY AREA  

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:43.739
&gt;&gt; SO IF YOU HAVE UNCONTROLLED  
CROSSWALKS IN THEIR STUDY AREA  
THIS IS HOW WE WERE HAVING      

01:07:43.741 --> 01:07:44.240
CROSSWALKS IN THEIR STUDY AREA  
THIS IS HOW WE WERE HAVING      
EVERYONE ANALYZE THOSE          

01:07:44.242 --> 01:07:47.176
THIS IS HOW WE WERE HAVING      
EVERYONE ANALYZE THOSE          
CROSSWALKS AND SEE IF THEY WERE 

01:07:47.178 --> 01:07:48.010
EVERYONE ANALYZE THOSE          
CROSSWALKS AND SEE IF THEY WERE 
HAVING AN IMPACT, IF THEY       

01:07:48.012 --> 01:07:54.550
CROSSWALKS AND SEE IF THEY WERE 
HAVING AN IMPACT, IF THEY       
NEEDED IF THERE NEEDED TO       

01:08:07.598 --> 01:08:10.966
                          ANY   
UPGRADES TO A CROSSWALK PRIOR   
TO HAVING THOSE NEW TRIPS IN AN 

01:08:10.968 --> 01:08:12.769
UPGRADES TO A CROSSWALK PRIOR   
TO HAVING THOSE NEW TRIPS IN AN 
AREA AND MOVING TO MY NEXT      

01:08:12.771 --> 01:08:13.969
TO HAVING THOSE NEW TRIPS IN AN 
AREA AND MOVING TO MY NEXT      
SLIDE I REALLY WANTED TO TOUCH  

01:08:13.971 --> 01:08:14.637
AREA AND MOVING TO MY NEXT      
SLIDE I REALLY WANTED TO TOUCH  
ON THE FACT THAT THESE          

01:08:14.639 --> 01:08:15.371
SLIDE I REALLY WANTED TO TOUCH  
ON THE FACT THAT THESE          
GUIDELINES WERE DEVELOPED IN    

01:08:15.373 --> 01:08:15.838
ON THE FACT THAT THESE          
GUIDELINES WERE DEVELOPED IN    
2015 AND 2016.                  

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.673
GUIDELINES WERE DEVELOPED IN    
2015 AND 2016.                  
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF NEW     

01:08:17.675 --> 01:08:18.274
2015 AND 2016.                  
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF NEW     
RESEARCH THAT HAS COME OUT      

01:08:18.276 --> 01:08:21.544
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF NEW     
RESEARCH THAT HAS COME OUT      
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A LOT       

01:08:21.546 --> 01:08:24.947
RESEARCH THAT HAS COME OUT      
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A LOT       
OF CHANGE TO CITY POLICY.       

01:08:24.949 --> 01:08:26.014
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A LOT       
OF CHANGE TO CITY POLICY.       
&gt;&gt; SO THIS SLIDE TOUCHES ON NEW 

01:08:26.016 --> 01:08:28.785
OF CHANGE TO CITY POLICY.       
&gt;&gt; SO THIS SLIDE TOUCHES ON NEW 
INFORMATION AND INNOVATIONS     

01:08:28.787 --> 01:08:29.985
&gt;&gt; SO THIS SLIDE TOUCHES ON NEW 
INFORMATION AND INNOVATIONS     
THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE SLIDE 

01:08:29.987 --> 01:08:33.222
INFORMATION AND INNOVATIONS     
THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE SLIDE 
READS IMPROVING CROSSWALKS AND  

01:08:33.224 --> 01:08:36.592
THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE SLIDE 
READS IMPROVING CROSSWALKS AND  
FIELD GUIDE AND THAT IS A VERY  

01:08:36.594 --> 01:08:40.362
READS IMPROVING CROSSWALKS AND  
FIELD GUIDE AND THAT IS A VERY  
SHORTHAND WAY TO REFER TO TWO   

01:08:40.364 --> 01:08:41.030
FIELD GUIDE AND THAT IS A VERY  
SHORTHAND WAY TO REFER TO TWO   
REALLY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS THAT 

01:08:41.032 --> 01:08:44.300
SHORTHAND WAY TO REFER TO TWO   
REALLY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS THAT 
HAVE COME OUT OF THE FEDERAL    

01:08:44.302 --> 01:08:47.569
REALLY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS THAT 
HAVE COME OUT OF THE FEDERAL    
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION AND I&apos;LL 

01:08:47.571 --> 01:08:48.571
HAVE COME OUT OF THE FEDERAL    
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION AND I&apos;LL 
BE COVERING THIS A LITTLE BIT   

01:08:48.573 --> 01:08:49.172
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION AND I&apos;LL 
BE COVERING THIS A LITTLE BIT   
MORE IN THE NEXT SLIDE.         

01:08:49.174 --> 01:08:51.206
BE COVERING THIS A LITTLE BIT   
MORE IN THE NEXT SLIDE.         
BOTH OF THESE DOCUMENTS A VERY  

01:08:51.208 --> 01:08:51.974
MORE IN THE NEXT SLIDE.         
BOTH OF THESE DOCUMENTS A VERY  
LONG TITLE SO I DIDN&apos;T WANT TO  

01:08:51.976 --> 01:08:54.977
BOTH OF THESE DOCUMENTS A VERY  
LONG TITLE SO I DIDN&apos;T WANT TO  
PUT THEM ALL THERE.             

01:08:54.979 --> 01:08:56.145
LONG TITLE SO I DIDN&apos;T WANT TO  
PUT THEM ALL THERE.             
&gt;&gt; BUT THESE THESE NEW THIS NEW 

01:08:56.147 --> 01:08:59.449
PUT THEM ALL THERE.             
&gt;&gt; BUT THESE THESE NEW THIS NEW 
GUIDANCE REALLY IS CONSISTENT   

01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:00.048
&gt;&gt; BUT THESE THESE NEW THIS NEW 
GUIDANCE REALLY IS CONSISTENT   
WITH THE CROSSWALK DESIGN       

01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:03.285
GUIDANCE REALLY IS CONSISTENT   
WITH THE CROSSWALK DESIGN       
GUIDELINE THAT WE DEVELOPED     

01:09:03.287 --> 01:09:04.219
WITH THE CROSSWALK DESIGN       
GUIDELINE THAT WE DEVELOPED     
PRETTY MUCH IN PARALLEL TO WHEN 

01:09:04.221 --> 01:09:07.389
GUIDELINE THAT WE DEVELOPED     
PRETTY MUCH IN PARALLEL TO WHEN 
THEY WERE DEVELOPING THIS.      

01:09:07.391 --> 01:09:08.323
PRETTY MUCH IN PARALLEL TO WHEN 
THEY WERE DEVELOPING THIS.      
BUT IT&apos;S THE INFORMATION IS     

01:09:08.325 --> 01:09:11.360
THEY WERE DEVELOPING THIS.      
BUT IT&apos;S THE INFORMATION IS     
PRESENTED A LITTLE BIT          

01:09:11.362 --> 01:09:11.760
BUT IT&apos;S THE INFORMATION IS     
PRESENTED A LITTLE BIT          
DIFFERENTLY.                    

01:09:11.762 --> 01:09:14.663
PRESENTED A LITTLE BIT          
DIFFERENTLY.                    
&gt;&gt; WE ALSO HAVE AN ARBOR MOVING 

01:09:14.665 --> 01:09:18.067
DIFFERENTLY.                    
&gt;&gt; WE ALSO HAVE AN ARBOR MOVING 
BEEN ADOPTED BY THE THAVE       

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:18.801
&gt;&gt; WE ALSO HAVE AN ARBOR MOVING 
BEEN ADOPTED BY THE THAVE       
SYSTEMS NATIONAL STRATEGY HAS   

01:09:18.803 --> 01:09:22.338
BEEN ADOPTED BY THE THAVE       
SYSTEMS NATIONAL STRATEGY HAS   
COME UP WHICH IS REALLY         

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.139
SYSTEMS NATIONAL STRATEGY HAS   
COME UP WHICH IS REALLY         
SUPPORTING THE WORK THAT WE&apos;RE  

01:09:23.141 --> 01:09:25.974
COME UP WHICH IS REALLY         
SUPPORTING THE WORK THAT WE&apos;RE  
DOING WITH THESE CROSSWALKS AND 

01:09:25.976 --> 01:09:30.312
SUPPORTING THE WORK THAT WE&apos;RE  
DOING WITH THESE CROSSWALKS AND 
ALSO ANOTHER NEW THING THAT HAS 

01:09:30.314 --> 01:09:30.913
DOING WITH THESE CROSSWALKS AND 
ALSO ANOTHER NEW THING THAT HAS 
HAPPENED IS THAT THE THE        

01:09:30.915 --> 01:09:34.316
ALSO ANOTHER NEW THING THAT HAS 
HAPPENED IS THAT THE THE        
HIGHWAY CAPACITY MANUAL HAS A   

01:09:34.318 --> 01:09:38.520
HAPPENED IS THAT THE THE        
HIGHWAY CAPACITY MANUAL HAS A   
NEW ADDITION AND I&apos;M SURE A LOT 

01:09:38.522 --> 01:09:39.155
HIGHWAY CAPACITY MANUAL HAS A   
NEW ADDITION AND I&apos;M SURE A LOT 
OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE    

01:09:39.157 --> 01:09:40.956
NEW ADDITION AND I&apos;M SURE A LOT 
OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE    
CONCEPT OF THE HIGHWAY CAPACITY 

01:09:40.958 --> 01:09:41.958
OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE    
CONCEPT OF THE HIGHWAY CAPACITY 
MANUAL AND IT IS THAT SORT      

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.227
CONCEPT OF THE HIGHWAY CAPACITY 
MANUAL AND IT IS THAT SORT      
OF TRADITIONAL WEAR LOOKING AT  

01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:48.898
MANUAL AND IT IS THAT SORT      
OF TRADITIONAL WEAR LOOKING AT  
VEHICULAR TRAFFIC FLOW AND

THAT MEANS IT&apos;S NOT RECOMMENDED 
FOR THAT LOCATION.              
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR   

01:14:11.562 --> 01:14:14.897
FOR THAT LOCATION.              
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR   
OUR CROSSWALK DESIGN GUIDELINES 

01:14:14.899 --> 01:14:19.234
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR   
OUR CROSSWALK DESIGN GUIDELINES 
CURRENTLY THE WAY STAFF IS      

01:14:19.236 --> 01:14:22.071
OUR CROSSWALK DESIGN GUIDELINES 
CURRENTLY THE WAY STAFF IS      
USING THIS TOOL IS THAT WE WHEN 

01:14:22.073 --> 01:14:22.872
CURRENTLY THE WAY STAFF IS      
USING THIS TOOL IS THAT WE WHEN 
EVALUATING LOCATION WE&apos;LL LOOK  

01:14:22.874 --> 01:14:26.174
USING THIS TOOL IS THAT WE WHEN 
EVALUATING LOCATION WE&apos;LL LOOK  
AT IT THROUGH OUR CROSSWALK     

01:14:26.176 --> 01:14:26.908
EVALUATING LOCATION WE&apos;LL LOOK  
AT IT THROUGH OUR CROSSWALK     
DESIGN GUIDELINES BUT THEN      

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:30.445
AT IT THROUGH OUR CROSSWALK     
DESIGN GUIDELINES BUT THEN      
WE&apos;LL ALSO LOOK AT THIS THIS    

01:14:30.447 --> 01:14:34.316
DESIGN GUIDELINES BUT THEN      
WE&apos;LL ALSO LOOK AT THIS THIS    
GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL HIGHWAY   

01:14:34.318 --> 01:14:38.086
WE&apos;LL ALSO LOOK AT THIS THIS    
GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL HIGHWAY   
AND MOST OF THE TIME THEY LINE  

01:14:38.088 --> 01:14:39.188
GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL HIGHWAY   
AND MOST OF THE TIME THEY LINE  
AND THEY COME UP WITH THE SAME  

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:42.891
AND MOST OF THE TIME THEY LINE  
AND THEY COME UP WITH THE SAME  
RESULT ACASE ONLY ONE OR THE    

01:14:42.893 --> 01:14:46.128
AND THEY COME UP WITH THE SAME  
RESULT ACASE ONLY ONE OR THE    
OTHER WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE 

01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:47.162
RESULT ACASE ONLY ONE OR THE    
OTHER WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE 
AND WE ALWAYS TAKE THE MORE     

01:14:47.164 --> 01:14:50.432
OTHER WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE 
AND WE ALWAYS TAKE THE MORE     
CONSERVATIVE DESIGN.            

01:14:50.434 --> 01:14:54.302
AND WE ALWAYS TAKE THE MORE     
CONSERVATIVE DESIGN.            
&gt;&gt; SO I REALIZED THAT ALL       

01:14:54.304 --> 01:14:55.404
CONSERVATIVE DESIGN.            
&gt;&gt; SO I REALIZED THAT ALL       
OF THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT QUICK  

01:14:55.406 --> 01:14:59.074
&gt;&gt; SO I REALIZED THAT ALL       
OF THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT QUICK  
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO  

01:14:59.076 --> 01:15:02.712
OF THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT QUICK  
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO  
HAVE LESS TIME AND I WANTED TO  

01:15:02.714 --> 01:15:03.512
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO  
HAVE LESS TIME AND I WANTED TO  
MAKE SURE WE HAD PLENTY OF TIME 

01:15:03.514 --> 01:15:05.180
HAVE LESS TIME AND I WANTED TO  
MAKE SURE WE HAD PLENTY OF TIME 
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND HAVE    

01:15:05.182 --> 01:15:06.381
MAKE SURE WE HAD PLENTY OF TIME 
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND HAVE    
DISCUSSION AND SO I JUST WANTED 

01:15:06.383 --> 01:15:10.086
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND HAVE    
DISCUSSION AND SO I JUST WANTED

BECAUSE I ALWAYS MAKE MY        
QUESTIONS SLIDE AND THE SLIDE   

01:15:11.489 --> 01:15:17.092
BECAUSE I ALWAYS MAKE MY        
QUESTIONS SLIDE AND THE SLIDE   
IS IS SHOWING AN IMAGE OF THE   

01:15:17.094 --> 01:15:21.530
QUESTIONS SLIDE AND THE SLIDE   
IS IS SHOWING AN IMAGE OF THE   
NEW INTERSECTION OF NORTH U AND 

01:15:21.532 --> 01:15:21.997
IS IS SHOWING AN IMAGE OF THE   
NEW INTERSECTION OF NORTH U AND 
STATE STREET.                   

01:15:21.999 --> 01:15:25.601
NEW INTERSECTION OF NORTH U AND 
STATE STREET.                   
IT LOOKS REALLY COOL SO I WILL  

01:15:25.603 --> 01:15:29.504
STATE STREET.                   
IT LOOKS REALLY COOL SO I WILL  
LEAVE MY SLIDE DECK SHOULD I    

01:15:29.506 --> 01:15:30.439
IT LOOKS REALLY COOL SO I WILL  
LEAVE MY SLIDE DECK SHOULD I    
LEAVE MY SLIDE DECK UP IN CASE  

01:15:30.441 --> 01:15:31.240
LEAVE MY SLIDE DECK SHOULD I    
LEAVE MY SLIDE DECK UP IN CASE  
WE NEED TO REFERENCE SOMETHING  

01:15:31.242 --> 01:15:33.309
LEAVE MY SLIDE DECK UP IN CASE  
WE NEED TO REFERENCE SOMETHING  
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE DOWN  

01:15:33.311 --> 01:15:37.012
WE NEED TO REFERENCE SOMETHING  
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE DOWN  
FOR NOW I CAN FORESEE MAYBE     

01:15:37.014 --> 01:15:37.713
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE DOWN  
FOR NOW I CAN FORESEE MAYBE     
REFERENCING SOME OF THE TABLES  

01:15:37.715 --> 01:15:40.916
FOR NOW I CAN FORESEE MAYBE     
REFERENCING SOME OF THE TABLES  
SO I CAN SEE RAISED HAND SO IF  

01:15:40.918 --> 01:15:41.650
REFERENCING SOME OF THE TABLES  
SO I CAN SEE RAISED HAND SO IF  
YOU COULD USE THE RAISED HAND   

01:15:41.652 --> 01:15:44.854
SO I CAN SEE RAISED HAND SO IF  
YOU COULD USE THE RAISED HAND   
FEATURE OR OR LARRY JUST KNEW   

01:15:44.856 --> 01:15:47.923
YOU COULD USE THE RAISED HAND   
FEATURE OR OR LARRY JUST KNEW   
THAT WORKS TO SO LET&apos;S LET&apos;S DO 

01:15:47.925 --> 01:15:48.257
FEATURE OR OR LARRY JUST KNEW   
THAT WORKS TO SO LET&apos;S LET&apos;S DO 
THAT.                           

01:15:48.259 --> 01:15:52.027
THAT WORKS TO SO LET&apos;S LET&apos;S DO 
THAT.                           
LET&apos;S START WITH PETER SO IF WE 

01:15:52.029 --> 01:15:56.264
THAT.                           
LET&apos;S START WITH PETER SO IF WE 
COULD GO BACK TO THE TABLE THAT 

01:15:56.266 --> 01:15:59.501
LET&apos;S START WITH PETER SO IF WE 
COULD GO BACK TO THE TABLE THAT 
HAS THE GUIDELINES FOR          

01:15:59.503 --> 01:16:03.939
COULD GO BACK TO THE TABLE THAT 
HAS THE GUIDELINES FOR          
UNCONTROL CROSSON THIS TABLE OR 

01:16:03.941 --> 01:16:10.713
HAS THE GUIDELINES FOR          
UNCONTROL CROSSON THIS TABLE OR 
THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY TO CITY TO  

01:16:14.217 --> 01:16:21.924
TOOK SO GENERALLY I DO WISH     
THAT THIS WAS A LITTLE MORE     
PROSCRIPTIVE AND I&apos;VE GOT A     

01:16:21.926 --> 01:16:25.427
THAT THIS WAS A LITTLE MORE     
PROSCRIPTIVE AND I&apos;VE GOT A     
COUPLE OF CRITIQUES.            

01:16:25.429 --> 01:16:29.498
PROSCRIPTIVE AND I&apos;VE GOT A     
COUPLE OF CRITIQUES.            
I GUESS ONE OF THEM IS THAT WE  

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.232
COUPLE OF CRITIQUES.            
I GUESS ONE OF THEM IS THAT WE  
HAVE LESS THAN THREE LANE LESS  

01:16:30.234 --> 01:16:31.166
I GUESS ONE OF THEM IS THAT WE  
HAVE LESS THAN THREE LANE LESS  
THAN OR EQUAL TO THREE LANES IN 

01:16:31.168 --> 01:16:33.302
HAVE LESS THAN THREE LANE LESS  
THAN OR EQUAL TO THREE LANES IN 
ONE ROW AND WE HAVE GREATER     

01:16:33.304 --> 01:16:34.035
THAN OR EQUAL TO THREE LANES IN 
ONE ROW AND WE HAVE GREATER     
THAN OR EQUAL TO THREE LANES IN 

01:16:34.037 --> 01:16:36.405
ONE ROW AND WE HAVE GREATER     
THAN OR EQUAL TO THREE LANES IN 
THE OTHER ROW.                  

01:16:36.407 --> 01:16:37.406
THAN OR EQUAL TO THREE LANES IN 
THE OTHER ROW.                  
SO IT&apos;S TECHNICALLY A THREE     

01:16:37.408 --> 01:16:44.379
THE OTHER ROW.                  
SO IT&apos;S TECHNICALLY A THREE     
LANE MINOR MAJOR ARTERIAL COULD 

01:16:44.381 --> 01:16:45.247
SO IT&apos;S TECHNICALLY A THREE     
LANE MINOR MAJOR ARTERIAL COULD 
USE EITHER OF THOSE TWO ROWS.   

01:16:45.249 --> 01:16:46.448
LANE MINOR MAJOR ARTERIAL COULD 
USE EITHER OF THOSE TWO ROWS.   
SO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO        

01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:49.251
USE EITHER OF THOSE TWO ROWS.   
SO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO        
CLARIFY WHERE A THREE LANE ROAD 

01:16:49.253 --> 01:16:49.652
SO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO        
CLARIFY WHERE A THREE LANE ROAD 
REALLY GOES.                    

01:16:49.654 --> 01:16:53.055
CLARIFY WHERE A THREE LANE ROAD 
REALLY GOES.                    
&gt;&gt; RAMPOLLA AGIS THAT IS A      

01:16:53.057 --> 01:16:56.092
REALLY GOES.                    
&gt;&gt; RAMPOLLA AGIS THAT IS A      
TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR THAT I DID  

01:16:56.094 --> 01:16:57.226
&gt;&gt; RAMPOLLA AGIS THAT IS A      
TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR THAT I DID  
NOT CATCH AS I WAS RECYCLING    

01:16:57.228 --> 01:17:00.262
TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR THAT I DID  
NOT CATCH AS I WAS RECYCLING    
THESE SLIDES FROM THE LAST AND  

01:17:00.264 --> 01:17:01.096
NOT CATCH AS I WAS RECYCLING    
THESE SLIDES FROM THE LAST AND  
THE THREE LANES WOULD GO IN THE 

01:17:01.098 --> 01:17:07.803
THESE SLIDES FROM THE LAST AND  
THE THREE LANES WOULD GO IN THE 
HIGHER BRACKET IN THE TO THE    

01:17:07.805 --> 01:17:11.407
THE THREE LANES WOULD GO IN THE 
HIGHER BRACKET IN THE TO THE    
SECOND FROM THE BOTTOM OK YES.  

01:17:11.409 --> 01:17:12.541
HIGHER BRACKET IN THE TO THE    
SECOND FROM THE BOTTOM OK YES.  
&gt;&gt; SO MINOR AND MAJOR ARTERIALS 

01:17:12.543 --> 01:17:19.314
SECOND FROM THE BOTTOM OK YES.  
&gt;&gt; SO MINOR AND MAJOR ARTERIALS 
THREE LANES ARE MORE THE OTHER  

01:17:19.316 --> 01:17:19.515
&gt;&gt; SO MINOR AND MAJOR ARTERIALS 
THREE LANES ARE MORE THE OTHER  
.                               

01:17:19.517 --> 01:17:20.449
THREE LANES ARE MORE THE OTHER  
.                               
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT 

01:17:20.451 --> 01:17:22.918
.                               
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT 
THIS SLIDE THAT IS WE SAY NOT   

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.919
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT 
THIS SLIDE THAT IS WE SAY NOT   
ALL DEVICES WILL BE USED IN ALL 

01:17:23.921 --> 01:17:26.288
THIS SLIDE THAT IS WE SAY NOT   
ALL DEVICES WILL BE USED IN ALL 
LOCATIONS.                      

01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:27.489
ALL DEVICES WILL BE USED IN ALL 
LOCATIONS.                      
SO WE&apos;VE WE&apos;VE SAID WHAT SHOULD 

01:17:27.491 --> 01:17:30.725
LOCATIONS.                      
SO WE&apos;VE WE&apos;VE SAID WHAT SHOULD 
BE CONSIDERED THEN WE&apos;VE        

01:17:30.727 --> 01:17:31.327
SO WE&apos;VE WE&apos;VE SAID WHAT SHOULD 
BE CONSIDERED THEN WE&apos;VE        
IMMEDIATELY SAID WE&apos;RE NOT      

01:17:31.329 --> 01:17:31.994
BE CONSIDERED THEN WE&apos;VE        
IMMEDIATELY SAID WE&apos;RE NOT      
GOING TO USE ALL OF THEM.       

01:17:31.996 --> 01:17:34.997
IMMEDIATELY SAID WE&apos;RE NOT      
GOING TO USE ALL OF THEM.       
WE HAVEN&apos;T SAID HOW MANY        

01:17:34.999 --> 01:17:35.997
GOING TO USE ALL OF THEM.       
WE HAVEN&apos;T SAID HOW MANY        
OF THEM WE&apos;RE GOING TO USE AND  

01:17:35.999 --> 01:17:38.267
WE HAVEN&apos;T SAID HOW MANY        
OF THEM WE&apos;RE GOING TO USE AND  
SO ACCORDING TO THIS PAGE WE    

01:17:38.269 --> 01:17:41.903
OF THEM WE&apos;RE GOING TO USE AND  
SO ACCORDING TO THIS PAGE WE    
CAN DO ANYTHING AND MEET AND    

01:17:41.905 --> 01:17:45.741
SO ACCORDING TO THIS PAGE WE    
CAN DO ANYTHING AND MEET AND    
STILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE    

01:17:45.743 --> 01:17:46.108

01:17:57.321 --> 01:17:58.353
THAT I WOULD LIKE IT AS I SAID, 
TO BE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE MAYBE   
NOT ALL DEVICES WILL BE USED    

01:17:58.355 --> 01:18:01.390
TO BE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE MAYBE   
NOT ALL DEVICES WILL BE USED    
BUT SOME MINIMUM NUM

HAVE COME ABOUT SINCE WE        

01:18:57.981 --> 01:18:58.714
INFORMATION AND INNOVATIONS     
HAVE COME ABOUT SINCE WE        
CREATED THIS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE 

01:18:58.716 --> 01:19:01.750
HAVE COME ABOUT SINCE WE        
CREATED THIS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE 
STAFF ARE STARTING TO DIG IN.   

01:19:01.752 --> 01:19:02.684
CREATED THIS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE 
STAFF ARE STARTING TO DIG IN.   
DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR THIS     

01:19:02.686 --> 01:19:06.221
STAFF ARE STARTING TO DIG IN.   
DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR THIS     
GROUP TO TAKE AND I&apos;M NOT SURE  

01:19:06.223 --> 01:19:07.021
DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR THIS     
GROUP TO TAKE AND I&apos;M NOT SURE  
WHAT LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT THIS  

01:19:07.023 --> 01:19:08.957
GROUP TO TAKE AND I&apos;M NOT SURE  
WHAT LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT THIS  
GROUP HAD BEFORE AND UPDATING   

01:19:08.959 --> 01:19:09.625
WHAT LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT THIS  
GROUP HAD BEFORE AND UPDATING   
OUR STANDARDS WITH FRESH EYES   

01:19:09.627 --> 01:19:13.328
GROUP HAD BEFORE AND UPDATING   
OUR STANDARDS WITH FRESH EYES   
BASED ON SOME OF THE NEW        

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.563
OUR STANDARDS WITH FRESH EYES   
BASED ON SOME OF THE NEW        
FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND RESEARCH 

01:19:15.565 --> 01:19:20.635
BASED ON SOME OF THE NEW        
FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND RESEARCH 
COMING OUT, I CAN ANSWER THE    

01:19:20.637 --> 01:19:23.905
FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND RESEARCH 
COMING OUT, I CAN ANSWER THE    
QUESTION OF WHAT LEVEL          

01:19:23.907 --> 01:19:24.573
COMING OUT, I CAN ANSWER THE    
QUESTION OF WHAT LEVEL          
OF INVOLVEMENT THIS GROUP HAD   

01:19:24.575 --> 01:19:27.275
QUESTION OF WHAT LEVEL          
OF INVOLVEMENT THIS GROUP HAD   
IN THAT PROCESS NONE BECAUSE IT 

01:19:27.277 --> 01:19:31.946
OF INVOLVEMENT THIS GROUP HAD   
IN THAT PROCESS NONE BECAUSE IT 
DIDN&apos;T EXIST.                   

01:19:31.948 --> 01:19:32.915
IN THAT PROCESS NONE BECAUSE IT 
DIDN&apos;T EXIST.                   
SO THIS IS THE STABILITY OF THE 

01:19:32.917 --> 01:19:33.182
DIDN&apos;T EXIST.                   
SO THIS IS THE STABILITY OF THE 
ONE.                            

01:19:33.184 --> 01:19:35.016

IT HAS BEEN A COMPANION TO THE  
WORK THAT WE&apos;RE DOING AND       

01:19:53.504 --> 01:19:56.004
IT HAS BEEN A COMPANION TO THE

01:27:50.814 --> 01:27:51.546
SO HAVING ALL OF THOSE THINGS   
THERE ON ON STREETS IS IS A     
TYPICAL DESIGN PRACTICE OF THE  

01:27:51.548 --> 01:27:52.080
THERE ON ON STREETS IS IS A     
TYPICAL DESIGN PRACTICE OF THE  
CITIES ALREADY.                 

01:27:52.082 --> 01:27:55.884
TYPICAL DESIGN PRACTICE OF THE  
CITIES ALREADY.                 
&gt;&gt; BUT THEN KNOW OUR OTHER      

01:27:55.886 --> 01:27:58.486
CITIES ALREADY.                 
&gt;&gt; BUT THEN KNOW OUR OTHER      
NUMBERS ARE TWO WHICH IS A      

01:27:58.488 --> 01:27:58.954
&gt;&gt; BUT THEN KNOW OUR OTHER      
NUMBERS ARE TWO WHICH IS A      
RAISED CROSSWALK.               

01:27:58.956 --> 01:28:02.924
NUMBERS ARE TWO WHICH IS A      
RAISED CROSSWALK.               
FOUR IS OCCUR IS THE PEDESTRIAN 

01:28:02.926 --> 01:28:06.995
RAISED CROSSWALK.               
FOUR IS OCCUR IS THE PEDESTRIAN 
CROSSING SIGN FIVE IS A CURB    

01:28:06.997 --> 01:28:11.166
FOUR IS OCCUR IS THE PEDESTRIAN 
CROSSING SIGN FIVE IS A CURB    
EXTENSION, SIX IS A PEDESTRIAN  

01:28:11.168 --> 01:28:14.102
CROSSING SIGN FIVE IS A CURB    
EXTENSION, SIX IS A PEDESTRIAN  
REFUGE AND YOU&apos;RE NOT GOING TO  

01:28:14.104 --> 01:28:14.969
EXTENSION, SIX IS A PEDESTRIAN  
REFUGE AND YOU&apos;RE NOT GOING TO  
BUILD A RAISED CROSSWALK AND A  

01:28:14.971 --> 01:28:17.839
REFUGE AND YOU&apos;RE NOT GOING TO  
BUILD A RAISED CROSSWALK AND A  
PEDESTRIAN REFUGE ISLAND AND    

01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:18.507
BUILD A RAISED CROSSWALK AND A  
PEDESTRIAN REFUGE ISLAND AND    
CURB EXTENSIONS OR BUMP OUTS    

01:28:18.509 --> 01:28:21.442
PEDESTRIAN REFUGE ISLAND AND    
CURB EXTENSIONS OR BUMP OUTS    
ALL IN THE SAME CROSSWALK       

01:28:21.444 --> 01:28:22.210
CURB EXTENSIONS OR BUMP OUTS    
ALL IN THE SAME CROSSWALK       
YOU&apos;RE GOING TO PICK WHICH ONE  

01:28:22.212 --> 01:28:25.947
ALL IN THE SAME CROSSWALK       
YOU&apos;RE GOING TO PICK WHICH ONE  
MAKES THE BEST SENSE FOR THE    

01:28:25.949 --> 01:28:26.681
YOU&apos;RE GOING TO PICK WHICH ONE  
MAKES THE BEST SENSE FOR THE    
LOCATION FOR THE AREA IF YOU    

01:28:26.683 --> 01:28:29.050
MAKES THE BEST SENSE FOR THE    
LOCATION FOR THE AREA IF YOU    
WANTED TO RAISE THAT CROSSWALK  

01:28:29.052 --> 01:28:29.851
LOCATION FOR THE AREA IF YOU    
WANTED TO RAISE THAT CROSSWALK  
AND DO A TRULY SIDEWALK HEIGHT, 

01:28:29.853 --> 01:28:36.324
WANTED TO RAISE THAT CROSSWALK  
AND DO A TRULY SIDEWALK HEIGHT, 
THE SIDEWALK HEIGHT CROSSING    

01:28:50.072 --> 01:28:52.274
YOUR CURRENT DRAINAGE           
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT LINE UP    
PERFECTLY FOR THAT AND THEN     

01:28:52.276 --> 01:28:53.074
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT LINE UP    
PERFECTLY FOR THAT AND THEN     
THAT&apos;S AN OPTION IF IT&apos;S NOT    

01:28:53.076 --> 01:28:53.742
PERFECTLY FOR THAT AND THEN     
THAT&apos;S AN OPTION IF IT&apos;S NOT    
AND REDESIGNATE THE UNDERGROUND 

01:28:53.744 --> 01:28:54.509
THAT&apos;S AN OPTION IF IT&apos;S NOT    
AND REDESIGNATE THE UNDERGROUND 
STORMWATER SYSTEM IS OUTSIDE    

01:28:54.511 --> 01:28:55.309
AND REDESIGNATE THE UNDERGROUND 
STORMWATER SYSTEM IS OUTSIDE    
OF YOUR BUDGET THEN YOU MIGHT   

01:28:55.311 --> 01:28:55.977
STORMWATER SYSTEM IS OUTSIDE    
OF YOUR BUDGET THEN YOU MIGHT   
BE LOOKING AT A PEDESTRIAN      

01:28:55.979 --> 01:28:56.645
OF YOUR BUDGET THEN YOU MIGHT   
BE LOOKING AT A PEDESTRIAN      
REFUGE ISLAND BECAUSE THE CURB  

01:28:56.647 --> 01:28:57.312
BE LOOKING AT A PEDESTRIAN      
REFUGE ISLAND BECAUSE THE CURB  
EXTENSIONS WOULD ALSO BE A      

01:28:57.314 --> 01:28:57.712
REFUGE ISLAND BECAUSE THE CURB  
EXTENSIONS WOULD ALSO BE A      
PROBLEM.                        

01:28:57.714 --> 01:28:58.447
EXTENSIONS WOULD ALSO BE A      
PROBLEM.                        
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE ARE KIND OF LIKE    

01:28:58.449 --> 01:28:59.180
PROBLEM.                        
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE ARE KIND OF LIKE    
THE DESIGN TRADE OFFS THAT OR   

01:28:59.182 --> 01:29:02.016
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE ARE KIND OF LIKE    
THE DESIGN TRADE OFFS THAT OR   
DESIGN DECISIONS I SHOULD SAY   

01:29:02.018 --> 01:29:02.950
THE DESIGN TRADE OFFS THAT OR   
DESIGN DECISIONS I SHOULD SAY   
THATE MADE WITH THOSE           

01:29:02.952 --> 01:29:04.986

AS I CAN TELL, PLACEHOLDER WAS  
PUT IN THE SIPP OR SIDEWALK     
FILLING BACK SOMEWHERE AROUND   

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:41.362
PUT IN THE SIPP OR SIDEWALK     
FILLING BACK SOMEWHERE AROUND   
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SIX SORRY   

01:38:41.364 --> 01:38:42.563
FILLING BACK SOMEWHERE AROUND   
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SIX SORRY

01:38:42.565 --> 01:38:45.833
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SIX SORRY   
BUT IT SAT THERE FOR A WHILE    
BEFORE ANYTHING REALLY GOT      

01:38:45.835 --> 01:38:46.767
BUT IT SAT THERE FOR A WHILE    
BEFORE ANYTHING REALLY GOT      
MOVING ON IT AND THE NEED TO    

01:38:46.769 --> 01:38:49.937
BEFORE ANYTHING REALLY GOT      
MOVING ON IT AND THE NEED TO    
PRIORITIZE WAS SOMETHING THAT   

01:38:49.939 --> 01:38:50.671
MOVING ON IT AND THE NEED TO    
PRIORITIZE WAS SOMETHING THAT   
WAS IDENTIFIED PRETTY SOON      

01:38:50.673 --> 01:38:56.577
PRIORITIZE WAS SOMETHING THAT   
WAS IDENTIFIED PRETTY SOON      
PRETTY EARLY                    

01:39:10.459 --> 01:39:12.460
             ON AND I&apos;LL TALK   
LIKE THAT.                      
I&apos;LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN A

I&apos;LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN A  
MINUTE HERE.                    
BUT WE DID START MOVING AHEAD   

01:39:13.563 --> 01:39:14.328
MINUTE HERE.                    
BUT WE DID START MOVING AHEAD   
WITH MORE SIDEWALK GAP FILLING  

01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:15.129
BUT WE DID START MOVING AHEAD   
WITH MORE SIDEWALK GAP FILLING  
PROJECTS THE EARLY 2010S IT WAS 

01:39:15.131 --> 01:39:15.796
WITH MORE SIDEWALK GAP FILLING  
PROJECTS THE EARLY 2010S IT WAS 
SOMEWHAT SLOW AND PART OF THE   

01:39:15.798 --> 01:39:16.597
PROJECTS THE EARLY 2010S IT WAS 
SOMEWHAT SLOW AND PART OF THE   
ISSUE THERE IS THAT AT THAT     

01:39:16.599 --> 01:39:17.264
SOMEWHAT SLOW AND PART OF THE   
ISSUE THERE IS THAT AT THAT     
TIME CITY CODE STILL REQUIRED   

01:39:17.266 --> 01:39:18.065
ISSUE THERE IS THAT AT THAT     
TIME CITY CODE STILL REQUIRED   
THAT WE SPECIAL ACCESS FOR NEW  

01:39:18.067 --> 01:39:18.733
TIME CITY CODE STILL REQUIRED   
THAT WE SPECIAL ACCESS FOR NEW  
SIDEWALKS MEANING THAT THE      

01:39:18.735 --> 01:39:19.400
THAT WE SPECIAL ACCESS FOR NEW  
SIDEWALKS MEANING THAT THE      
ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER HAD TO  

01:39:19.402 --> 01:39:20.535
SIDEWALKS MEANING THAT THE      
ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER HAD TO  
PAY FOR THAT COST THAT LED INTO 

01:39:20.537 --> 01:39:21.402
ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER HAD TO  
PAY FOR THAT COST THAT LED INTO 
THE WHAT WE CALLED THE NEW      

01:39:21.404 --> 01:39:22.203
PAY FOR THAT COST THAT LED INTO 
THE WHAT WE CALLED THE NEW      
SIDEWALK KNOWLEDGE THE SIDEWALK 

01:39:22.205 --> 01:39:25.339
THE WHAT WE CALLED THE NEW      
SIDEWALK KNOWLEDGE THE SIDEWALK 
GAP VILLAGE IF YOU WANT TO CALL 

01:39:25.341 --> 01:39:26.040
SIDEWALK KNOWLEDGE THE SIDEWALK 
GAP VILLAGE IF YOU WANT TO CALL 
IT THAT THAT WAS APPROVED BY    

01:39:26.042 --> 01:39:28.542
GAP VILLAGE IF YOU WANT TO CALL 
IT THAT THAT WAS APPROVED BY    
VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY.        

01:39:28.544 --> 01:39:29.277
IT THAT THAT WAS APPROVED BY    
VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY.        
THAT MILLAGE PROVIDES           

01:39:29.279 --> 01:39:32.880
VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY.        
THAT MILLAGE PROVIDES           
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR    

01:39:32.882 --> 01:39:33.747
THAT MILLAGE PROVIDES           
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR    
MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND AS 

01:39:33.749 --> 01:39:37.184
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR    
MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND AS 
PART OF THAT ADOPTION BY VOTERS 

01:39:37.186 --> 01:39:40.654
MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND AS 
PART OF THAT ADOPTION BY VOTERS 
CITY CODE WAS CHANGED SO THAT   

01:39:40.656 --> 01:39:41.488
PART OF THAT ADOPTION BY VOTERS 
CITY CODE WAS CHANGED SO THAT   
PARCELS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON   

01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:44.592
CITY CODE WAS CHANGED SO THAT   
PARCELS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON   
THE TAX ROLL DO NOT HAVE TO BE  

01:39:44.594 --> 01:39:45.426
PARCELS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON   
THE TAX ROLL DO NOT HAVE TO BE  
SPECIAL SESTRA THOSE ANYMORE SO 

01:39:45.428 --> 01:39:48.362
THE TAX ROLL DO NOT HAVE TO BE  
SPECIAL SESTRA THOSE ANYMORE SO 
THAT REMOVED A BIG HURDLE IN    

01:39:48.364 --> 01:39:51.499
SPECIAL SESTRA THOSE ANYMORE SO 
THAT REMOVED A BIG HURDLE IN    
SIDEWALK GAP FILLING GAVE A     

01:39:51.501 --> 01:39:52.299
THAT REMOVED A BIG HURDLE IN    
SIDEWALK GAP FILLING GAVE A     
DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE AND WE 

01:39:52.301 --> 01:39:53.101
SIDEWALK GAP FILLING GAVE A     
DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE AND WE 
DIDN&apos;T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE   

01:39:53.103 --> 01:39:55.636
DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE AND WE 
DIDN&apos;T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE   
SPECIAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS.     

01:39:55.638 --> 01:39:56.504
DIDN&apos;T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE   
SPECIAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS.     
SO THE PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM    

01:39:56.506 --> 01:40:00.040
SPECIAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS.     
SO THE PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM    
WHICH WAS THE FIRST VERSION SET 

01:40:00.042 --> 01:40:02.510
SO THE PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM    
WHICH WAS THE FIRST VERSION SET 
UP IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH    

01:40:02.512 --> 01:40:03.511
WHICH WAS THE FIRST VERSION SET 
UP IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH    
WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO BUT HAS   

01:40:03.513 --> 01:40:06.414
UP IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH    
WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO BUT HAS   
GONE THROUGH A COUPLE           

01:40:06.416 --> 01:40:07.214
WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO BUT HAS   
GONE THROUGH A COUPLE           
OF RENOVATIONS SINCE THEN WE&apos;RE 

01:40:07.216 --> 01:40:09.484
GONE THROUGH A COUPLE           
OF RENOVATIONS SINCE THEN WE&apos;RE 
ACTUALLY ON VERSION 3.0 RIGHT   

01:40:09.486 --> 01:40:13.620
OF RENOVATIONS SINCE THEN WE&apos;RE 
ACTUALLY ON VERSION 3.0 RIGHT   
NOW.                            

01:40:13.622 --> 01:40:14.955
ACTUALLY ON VERSION 3.0 RIGHT   
NOW.                            
SO GAP BEFORE I REALLY GET TO   

01:40:14.957 --> 01:40:17.991
NOW.                            
SO GAP BEFORE I REALLY GET TO   
TALKING ABOUT GAP               

01:40:17.993 --> 01:40:18.659
SO GAP BEFORE I REALLY GET TO   
TALKING ABOUT GAP               
PRIORITIZATION OF THE FIRST     

01:40:18.661 --> 01:40:19.327
TALKING ABOUT GAP               
PRIORITIZATION OF THE FIRST     
KIND OF QUESTION THAT COMES UP  

01:40:19.329 --> 01:40:21.729
PRIORITIZATION OF THE FIRST     
KIND OF QUESTION THAT COMES UP  
IS WHAT IS A SIDEWALK GAP       

01:40:21.731 --> 01:40:25.299
KIND OF QUESTION THAT COMES UP  
IS WHAT IS A SIDEWALK GAP       
EXACTLY AND THE WAY WE&apos;VE       

01:40:25.301 --> 01:40:26.234
IS WHAT IS A SIDEWALK GAP       
EXACTLY AND THE WAY WE&apos;VE       
DEFINED A SIDEWALK GAP IS ANY   

01:40:26.236 --> 01:40:28.836
EXACTLY AND THE WAY WE&apos;VE       
DEFINED A SIDEWALK GAP IS ANY   
LOCATION IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT    

01:40:28.838 --> 01:40:29.637
DEFINED A SIDEWALK GAP IS ANY   
LOCATION IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT    
OF WAY ADJACENT TO A STREET     

01:40:29.639 --> 01:40:33.240
LOCATION IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT    
OF WAY ADJACENT TO A STREET     
THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE    

01:40:33.242 --> 01:40:33.874
OF WAY ADJACENT TO A STREET     
THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE    
SIDEWALKS ON IT.                

01:40:33.876 --> 01:40:37.444
THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE    
SIDEWALKS ON IT.                
SO WE DO THINK OF A TRADITIONAL 

01:40:37.446 --> 01:40:38.479
SIDEWALKS ON IT.                
SO WE DO THINK OF A TRADITIONAL 
GAP AS MAYBE LIKE A PARCEL OR   

01:40:38.481 --> 01:40:39.147
SO WE DO THINK OF A TRADITIONAL 
GAP AS MAYBE LIKE A PARCEL OR   
TWO WHERE THERE&apos;S NO SIDEWALK   

01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:40.815
GAP AS MAYBE LIKE A PARCEL OR   
TWO WHERE THERE&apos;S NO SIDEWALK   
BUT THERE SIDEWALK EITHER END.  

01:40:40.817 --> 01:40:41.582
TWO WHERE THERE&apos;S NO SIDEWALK   
BUT THERE SIDEWALK EITHER END.  
THAT&apos;S CERTAINLY A GAP          

01:40:41.584 --> 01:40:44.819
BUT THERE SIDEWALK EITHER END.  
THAT&apos;S CERTAINLY A GAP          
OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO A SIDEWALK   

01:40:44.821 --> 01:40:45.420
THAT&apos;S CERTAINLY A GAP          
OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO A SIDEWALK   
GAP IS ALSO IN THOSE            

01:40:45.422 --> 01:40:48.289
OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO A SIDEWALK   
GAP IS ALSO IN THOSE            
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE       

01:40:48.291 --> 01:40:49.156
GAP IS ALSO IN THOSE            
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE       
OTHERWISE IS NO SIDEWALK WE     

01:40:49.158 --> 01:40:52.693
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE       
OTHERWISE IS NO SIDEWALK WE     
WOULD THAT&apos;S ALSO SCORED ON OUR 

01:40:52.695 --> 01:40:56.597
OTHERWISE IS NO SIDEWALK WE     
WOULD THAT&apos;S ALSO SCORED ON OUR 
PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM AS WELL.  

01:40:56.599 --> 01:40:57.931
WOULD THAT&apos;S ALSO SCORED ON OUR 
PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM AS WELL.  
SO A LITTLE BIT OF DATA HERE ON 

01:40:57.933 --> 01:41:00.567
PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM AS WELL.  
SO A LITTLE BIT OF DATA HERE ON 
OUR SIDEWALKS.                  

01:41:00.569 --> 01:41:01.568
