GO THROUGH ADDITIONAL HURDLES   

00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:55.517
PROJECTS WORK AND THEY HAVE TO  
GO THROUGH ADDITIONAL HURDLES   
TO THE FEASIBILITY.             

00:45:55.519 --> 00:46:02.425
GO THROUGH ADDITIONAL HURDLES   
TO THE FEASIBILITY.             
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE&apos;S    

00:46:16.539 --> 00:46:18.341
ALWAYS DESIRE FOR MORE THIRD    
PLACES.

00:46:18.343 --> 00:46:19.141
PLACES.                         
THAT&apos;S A LOT OF WHAT MAKES OUR  
COMMUNITIES BUT WE HAVE THEM

THERE AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD 
BE GREAT FOR THEM TO HAVE MORE  

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.113
THERE AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD 
BE GREAT FOR THEM TO HAVE MORE  
CUSTOMERS IN A WALKABLE RADIUS  

00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:24.914
BE GREAT FOR THEM TO HAVE MORE  
CUSTOMERS IN A WALKABLE RADIUS  
AND THROUGH THAT MOMENTUM WE    

00:46:24.916 --> 00:46:25.647
CUSTOMERS IN A WALKABLE RADIUS  
AND THROUGH THAT MOMENTUM WE    
CAN SEE MORE DEVELOPMENT RIGHT. 

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:26.248
AND THROUGH THAT MOMENTUM WE    
CAN SEE MORE DEVELOPMENT RIGHT. 
WE&apos;VE GOT THE PARKWAY           

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:26.848
CAN SEE MORE DEVELOPMENT RIGHT. 
WE&apos;VE GOT THE PARKWAY           
DEVELOPMENT RIGHT AT THE        

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:27.583

DEVELOPMENT RIGHT AT THE        
RIVERFRONT THAT WE CAN SEE BOTH 

00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:28.316

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:30.619
RIVERFRONT THAT WE CAN SEE BOTH

00:53:58.869 --> 00:53:59.901
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO CAME   
TO ME.                          
THEY SAID I WE&apos;D REALLY LIKE TO 

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:02.137
TO ME.                          
THEY SAID I WE&apos;D REALLY LIKE TO

00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:03.138
THEY SAID I WE&apos;D REALLY LIKE TO 
SEE SOLAR THE PROJECT.          
WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS,    

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:03.738
SEE SOLAR THE PROJECT.          
WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS,    
HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS.            

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.408
WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS,    
HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS.            
COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE A GOOD    

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:07.276
HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS.            
COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE A GOOD    
EFFORT TO TRY TO ANALYZE IT AND 

00:54:07.278 --> 00:54:09.077
COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE A GOOD    
EFFORT TO TRY TO ANALYZE IT AND 
FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCORPORATE?  

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:09.978
EFFORT TO TRY TO ANALYZE IT AND 
FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCORPORATE?  
SO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WE   

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:10.846
FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCORPORATE?  
SO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WE   
HAVE IS WE JUST DON&apos;T HAVE ANY  

00:54:10.848 --> 00:54:13.715
SO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WE   
HAVE IS WE JUST DON&apos;T HAVE ANY  
LAND FOR SOLAR ANY HAVE THE     

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:14.449
HAVE IS WE JUST DON&apos;T HAVE ANY  
LAND FOR SOLAR ANY HAVE THE     
BUILDINGS, YOU HAVE THE ROADS,  

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:15.384
LAND FOR SOLAR ANY HAVE THE     
BUILDINGS, YOU HAVE THE ROADS,  
YOU HAVE THE TRAILER CREEK SET  

00:54:15.386 --> 00:54:17.653
BUILDINGS, YOU HAVE THE ROADS,  
YOU HAVE THE TRAILER CREEK SET  
BACK THE PUBLIC ACCESS EASEMENT 

00:54:17.655 --> 00:54:18.353
YOU HAVE THE TRAILER CREEK SET  
BACK THE PUBLIC ACCESS EASEMENT 
AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS  

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:21.556
BACK THE PUBLIC ACCESS EASEMENT 
AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS  
AND I WAS THINKING HOW COULD WE 

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:21.956
AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS  
AND I WAS THINKING HOW COULD WE 
CREATE LAND?                    

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:22.824
AND I WAS THINKING HOW COULD WE 
CREATE LAND?                    
AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME WE CAN 

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:25.360
CREATE LAND?                    
AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME WE CAN 
RECLAIM LAND IF WE CAN BUILD A  

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:25.960
AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME WE CAN 
RECLAIM LAND IF WE CAN BUILD A  
ROOF OVER OUR PARKING           

00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:26.294
RECLAIM LAND IF WE CAN BUILD A  
ROOF OVER OUR PARKING

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:29.531
ROOF OVER OUR PARKING           
STRUCTURE.                      
NOW FOR ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE    

00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:30.331
STRUCTURE.                      
NOW FOR ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE    
PARKING STRUCTURE IN THE FIRST  

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.735
NOW FOR ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE    
PARKING STRUCTURE IN THE FIRST  
BUILDING, IT&apos;S HAS A VERY LARGE 

00:54:32.737 --> 00:54:33.135
PARKING STRUCTURE IN THE FIRST  
BUILDING, IT&apos;S HAS A VERY LARGE 
FOOTPRINT.                      

00:54:33.137 --> 00:54:33.936
BUILDING, IT&apos;S HAS A VERY LARGE 
FOOTPRINT.                      
IT&apos;S ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND     

00:54:33.938 --> 00:54:36.104
FOOTPRINT.                      
IT&apos;S ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND     
SQUARE FEET AND IT&apos;S AN OPEN    

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:36.472
IT&apos;S ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND     
SQUARE FEET AND IT&apos;S AN OPEN    
PARKING DECK.                   

00:54:36.474 --> 00:54:37.272
SQUARE FEET AND IT&apos;S AN OPEN    
PARKING DECK.                   
PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO       

00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:38.073
PARKING DECK.                   
PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO       
SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT TO KEEP   

00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:40.308
PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO       
SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT TO KEEP   
THAT PARKING DECK.              

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.309
SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT TO KEEP   
THAT PARKING DECK.              
OBVIOUSLY THE BIG EXPENSIVE GAS 

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:44.246
THAT PARKING DECK.              
OBVIOUSLY THE BIG EXPENSIVE GAS 
AND CARBON ALL THOSE THINGS AND 

00:54:44.248 --> 00:54:45.047
OBVIOUSLY THE BIG EXPENSIVE GAS 
AND CARBON ALL THOSE THINGS AND 
IT&apos;S A CONTINUOUS PARKING RAMP. 

00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:47.983
AND CARBON ALL THOSE THINGS AND 
IT&apos;S A CONTINUOUS PARKING RAMP. 
SO WE CAME UP WITH AN IDEA THAT 

00:54:47.985 --> 00:54:48.950
IT&apos;S A CONTINUOUS PARKING RAMP. 
SO WE CAME UP WITH AN IDEA THAT 
IF WE COULD BUILD A ROOF OVER   

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:52.087
SO WE CAME UP WITH AN IDEA THAT 
IF WE COULD BUILD A ROOF OVER   
THE PARKING STRUCTURE NOW WE    

00:54:52.089 --> 00:54:52.821
IF WE COULD BUILD A ROOF OVER   
THE PARKING STRUCTURE NOW WE    
WOULD HAVE ENOUGH REAL ESTATE   

00:54:52.823 --> 00:54:55.624
THE PARKING STRUCTURE NOW WE    
WOULD HAVE ENOUGH REAL ESTATE   
THAT NOT JUST ADD A FEW SOLAR   

00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:56.425
WOULD HAVE ENOUGH REAL ESTATE   
THAT NOT JUST ADD A FEW SOLAR   
PANELS JUST TO ADD THEM JUST SO 

00:54:56.427 --> 00:54:59.394
THAT NOT JUST ADD A FEW SOLAR   
PANELS JUST TO ADD THEM JUST SO 
WE COULD SAY WE DID IT BUT WE   

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:00.395
PANELS JUST TO ADD THEM JUST SO 
WE COULD SAY WE DID IT BUT WE   
COULD DO IT IN AN EFFICIENT WAY 

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:03.231
WE COULD SAY WE DID IT BUT WE   
COULD DO IT IN AN EFFICIENT WAY 
AND ACTUALLY GENERATE           

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:06.735
COULD DO IT IN AN EFFICIENT WAY 
AND ACTUALLY GENERATE           
MEANINGFUL SOLAR AS A RESULT    

00:55:06.737 --> 00:55:07.869
AND ACTUALLY GENERATE           
MEANINGFUL SOLAR AS A RESULT    
THAT WE WORK WITH A THIRD PARTY 

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:08.703
MEANINGFUL SOLAR AS A RESULT    
THAT WE WORK WITH A THIRD PARTY 
CONSULTANT THAT I PAID FOR AND  

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:11.739
THAT WE WORK WITH A THIRD PARTY 
CONSULTANT THAT I PAID FOR AND  
THE PROPOSITION I MADE WITH THE 

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:12.507

TRACTION I THOUGHT THIS WAS     
GOING TO HAPPEN WAS THAT WE     

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.244
TRACTION I THOUGHT THIS WAS     
GOING TO HAPPEN WAS THAT WE     
WOULD USE THE TESTS TO PAY FOR  

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:19.714
GOING TO HAPPEN WAS THAT WE     
WOULD USE THE TESTS TO PAY FOR  
THE COST OF THE OF THE ROOF     

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:20.482
WOULD USE THE TESTS TO PAY FOR  
THE COST OF THE OF THE ROOF     
OVER THE PARKING DECK IN OTHER

THE COST OF THE OF THE ROOF     
OVER THE PARKING DECK IN OTHER  
WORDS TO CREATE THE REAL ESTATE 

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:24.018
OVER THE PARKING DECK IN OTHER  
WORDS TO CREATE THE REAL ESTATE 
SO THAT WE COULD CREATE THE     

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.722
WORDS TO CREATE THE REAL ESTATE 
SO THAT WE COULD CREATE THE     
SOLAR PV ARRAY AND THE MATH I   

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:28.323
SO THAT WE COULD CREATE THE

THAT AND THEN I WONDERED        
ANOTHER QUESTION HAS COME UP    
WHICH IS HOW MANY OF THE        

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:15.797
ANOTHER QUESTION HAS COME UP    
WHICH IS HOW MANY OF THE        
CURRENT FIFTEEN UNITS FELT THE  

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:16.564
WHICH IS HOW MANY OF THE        
CURRENT FIFTEEN UNITS FELT THE  
CURRENT FIFTEEN SO THEY FILLED  

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:16.964
CURRENT FIFTEEN UNITS FELT THE  
CURRENT FIFTEEN SO THEY FILLED  
UP QUICKLY.                     

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:17.699
CURRENT FIFTEEN SO THEY FILLED  
UP QUICKLY.                     
SO THE FIRST BUILDING THEY&apos;RE

AREN&apos;T REQUIRING                
ELECTRIFICATION OF THIS         

00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:41.189
AREN&apos;T REQUIRING                
ELECTRIFICATION OF THIS         
PROJECT.                        

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:44.926
ELECTRIFICATION OF THIS         
PROJECT.                        
AND AGAIN THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE 

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:45.594
PROJECT.                        
AND AGAIN THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE 
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE   

00:57:45.596 --> 00:57:48.529
AND AGAIN THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE 
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE   
CAN REQUIRE IF STATE BUILDING   

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:49.297
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE   
CAN REQUIRE IF STATE BUILDING   
CODES ALLOWED US TO DO THAT,    

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:52.768
CAN REQUIRE IF STATE BUILDING   
CODES ALLOWED US TO DO THAT,    
EVERY SINGLE PROJECT THAT CAME  

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.568
CODES ALLOWED US TO DO THAT,    
EVERY SINGLE PROJECT THAT CAME  
BEFORE US WOULD BE ELECTRIFIED  

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:56.471
EVERY SINGLE PROJECT THAT CAME  
BEFORE US WOULD BE ELECTRIFIED  
BUT WE CAN&apos;T REQUIRE THAT AND   

00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:57.205
BEFORE US WOULD BE ELECTRIFIED  
BUT WE CAN&apos;T REQUIRE THAT AND   
YOU HAVE YOUR HEATING           

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:57.806
BUT WE CAN&apos;T REQUIRE THAT AND   
YOU HAVE YOUR HEATING           
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE GROUND    

00:57:57.808 --> 00:58:00.876
YOU HAVE YOUR HEATING           
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE GROUND    
AND SO WE WOULD NOT IMPOSE AN   

00:58:00.878 --> 00:58:01.810
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE GROUND    
AND SO WE WOULD NOT IMPOSE AN   
INEFFICIENCY ON YOU AND ASK YOU 

00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:05.046
AND SO WE WOULD NOT IMPOSE AN   
INEFFICIENCY ON YOU AND ASK YOU 
TO MAKE A HYBRID SOMETHING OR   

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:05.280
INEFFICIENCY ON YOU AND ASK YOU 
TO MAKE A HYBRID SOMETHING OR   
OTHER.                          

00:58:05.282 --> 00:58:06.114
TO MAKE A HYBRID SOMETHING OR   
OTHER.                          
I DON&apos;T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT     

00:58:06.116 --> 00:58:08.717
OTHER.                          
I DON&apos;T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT     
WOULD BE WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE  

00:58:08.719 --> 00:58:09.384
I DON&apos;T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT     
WOULD BE WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE  
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE       

00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:09.785
WOULD BE WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE  
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

YOUR WAY AROUND A ROUGH ALSO    
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU INSTALL SOLAR 
PANELS AND SOME KIND OF FRAME   

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.302

YOU HAVE TO PUT THROUGH ROOFS.  
EVERY ONE OF THOSE IS ANOTHER

POTENTIALLY COULD LEAK.         
YOU HAVE STRUCTURAL             
CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE THE THE  

01:00:48.377 --> 01:00:51.812
YOU HAVE STRUCTURAL             
CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE THE THE  
THE PANELS ARE LIKE SALES.      

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:52.714
CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE THE THE  
THE PANELS ARE LIKE SALES.      
THEY PICK UP THE WIND AND YOU   

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:53.581
THE PANELS ARE LIKE SALES.      
THEY PICK UP THE WIND AND YOU   
HAVE TO WORK AGAINST UPLIFT NOT 

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:56.250
THEY PICK UP THE WIND AND YOU   
HAVE TO WORK AGAINST UPLIFT NOT 
TO MENTION MANY TIMES THAT THE

COMPONENTS.                     
I THINK THE INCREASED NUMBER    

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.447
COMPONENTS.                     
I THINK THE INCREASED NUMBER    
OF USES WITHOUT ADDING THE      

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.248
I THINK THE INCREASED NUMBER    
OF USES WITHOUT ADDING THE      
ADDITIONAL PARKING GIVING TIME  

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.984
OF USES WITHOUT ADDING THE      
ADDITIONAL PARKING GIVING TIME  
TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH PARKING

ADDITIONAL PARKING GIVING TIME

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:31.385
BUILDING IS A COMPLETELY FULL   
IT&apos;S ESSENTIALLY FULL.          
IT FLUCTUATES A LITTLE BIT AS   

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:34.688
IT&apos;S ESSENTIALLY FULL.          
IT FLUCTUATES A LITTLE BIT AS   
WE GET INTO THE LEASE AND TURNS 

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:35.323
IT FLUCTUATES A LITTLE BIT AS   
WE GET INTO THE LEASE AND TURNS 
THAT HAPPENED AT THIS TIME      

01:11:35.325 --> 01:11:36.057
WE GET INTO THE LEASE AND TURNS 
THAT HAPPENED AT THIS TIME

AND THEN JUST CURIOUS I         
PROBABLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO     

01:11:38.228 --> 01:11:41.061
AND THEN JUST CURIOUS I

THIS BUT WHAT SPARKED THE       
DESIRE TO WANT TO CHANGE FROM   

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:42.830
THIS BUT WHAT SPARKED THE       
DESIRE TO WANT TO CHANGE FROM   
CONDOS INTO THIS BUILDING ALSO  

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.433
DESIRE TO WANT TO CHANGE FROM   
CONDOS INTO THIS BUILDING ALSO  
BEING RUN THE CONDOS JUST       

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:45.833
CONDOS INTO THIS BUILDING ALSO  
BEING RUN THE CONDOS JUST       
DIDN&apos;T WORK.

WERE GOING TO LEAD OFF WITH THE 
CONDO DEVELOPMENT AND WE DID    
AND YOU KNOW, THE SHORT ANSWER  

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:56.977
CONDO DEVELOPMENT AND WE DID    
AND YOU KNOW, THE SHORT ANSWER  
IS WE JUST WE COULD NOT         

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:57.511
AND YOU KNOW, THE SHORT ANSWER  
IS WE JUST WE COULD NOT         
GENERATE THE SUFFICIENT         

01:11:57.513 --> 01:12:00.480
IS WE JUST WE COULD NOT         
GENERATE THE SUFFICIENT         
PRE-SALES WE NEEDED TO MOVE THE 

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:01.115
GENERATE THE SUFFICIENT         
PRE-SALES WE NEEDED TO MOVE THE 
PROJECT FORWARD COULD HAVE A    

01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:01.648
PRE-SALES WE NEEDED TO MOVE THE 
PROJECT FORWARD COULD HAVE A    
LONG DISCUSSION.                

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.449
PROJECT FORWARD COULD HAVE A    
LONG DISCUSSION.                
I&apos;M HAPPY TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT 

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.217
LONG DISCUSSION.                
I&apos;M HAPPY TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT 
AFTERWARDS.                     

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:05.319
I&apos;M HAPPY TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT 
AFTERWARDS.                     
THE REASONS WHY I WISH I COULD  

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:05.920
AFTERWARDS.                     
THE REASONS WHY I WISH I COULD  
WRITE THE ALGORITHM WE DAVID    

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:06.686
THE REASONS WHY I WISH I COULD  
WRITE THE ALGORITHM WE DAVID    
AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT      

01:12:06.688 --> 01:12:08.822
WRITE THE ALGORITHM WE DAVID    
AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT      
RIGHT TO BEGIN WITH BUT IT      

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:12.426
AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT      
RIGHT TO BEGIN WITH BUT IT      
DIDN&apos;T WORK AND SO THEN WE WERE 

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:13.160
RIGHT TO BEGIN WITH BUT IT      
DIDN&apos;T WORK AND SO THEN WE WERE 
CONSIDERING WHAT THE VARIOUS    

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.829
DIDN&apos;T WORK AND SO THEN WE WERE 
CONSIDERING WHAT THE VARIOUS    
OPTIONS COULD BE TO             

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:16.463
CONSIDERING WHAT THE VARIOUS    
OPTIONS COULD BE TO             
SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP THE        

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:17.230
OPTIONS COULD BE TO             
SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP THE        
PROPERTY AND IT BECAME CLEAR    

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:19.800
SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP THE        
PROPERTY AND IT BECAME CLEAR    
JUST GIVEN THE MARKET DYNAMICS  

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:20.534
PROPERTY AND IT BECAME CLEAR    
JUST GIVEN THE MARKET DYNAMICS  
AND OUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH THE 

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:23.604
JUST GIVEN THE MARKET DYNAMICS  
AND OUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH THE 
FIRST TWO PHASES THE DATE THAT  

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:24.405
AND OUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH THE 
FIRST TWO PHASES THE DATE THAT  
THIS WAS SEEM TO BE THE PRUDENT 

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:27.307
FIRST TWO PHASES THE DATE THAT  
THIS WAS SEEM TO BE THE PRUDENT 
APPROACH AND AND THEN THE TWO   

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:28.042
THIS WAS SEEM TO BE THE PRUDENT 
APPROACH AND AND THEN THE TWO   
PRINCIPAL CHANGES WHICH WE KEEP 

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:28.776
APPROACH AND AND THEN THE TWO   
PRINCIPAL CHANGES WHICH WE KEEP 
COMING BACK TO THE INCREASE IN  

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:29.510
PRINCIPAL CHANGES WHICH WE KEEP 
COMING BACK TO THE INCREASE IN  
DENSITY AND THE REDUCTION IN    

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.578
COMING BACK TO THE INCREASE IN  
DENSITY AND THE REDUCTION IN    
PARKING WORK, THERE&apos;S A         

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.112
DENSITY AND THE REDUCTION IN    
PARKING WORK, THERE&apos;S A         
COMPLETE ALIGNMENT.             

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:34.948
PARKING WORK, THERE&apos;S A         
COMPLETE ALIGNMENT.             
I MEAN THOSE CHANGES ALLOW      

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:35.716
COMPLETE ALIGNMENT.             
I MEAN THOSE CHANGES ALLOW      
PHASE TO BE SUCCESSFULLY        

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:36.350
I MEAN THOSE CHANGES ALLOW      
PHASE TO BE SUCCESSFULLY        
CHANGED TO ANOTHER KIND         

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:39.419
PHASE TO BE SUCCESSFULLY        
CHANGED TO ANOTHER KIND         
OF RESIDENTIAL USE AND THEY     

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:40.087
CHANGED TO ANOTHER KIND         
OF RESIDENTIAL USE AND THEY     
ALSO ALIGN WITH THE CITY&apos;S      

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:40.487
OF RESIDENTIAL USE AND THEY     
ALSO ALIGN WITH THE CITY&apos;S

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:15.669
IT IS TOUGH TO FIND OPERATORS   
THAT CAN OPERATE GOOD HEALTHY   
RATIO.                          

01:21:15.671 --> 01:21:16.603
THAT CAN OPERATE GOOD HEALTHY   
RATIO.

AND SO THAT&apos;S PART OF WHY I&apos;M   
NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS VOCAL  
AS I USUALLY WOULD BE ON THIS   

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:33.246
NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS VOCAL

THIS BECAUSE YOU&apos;RE TALKING     
ABOUT MAYBE HOW TO CHANGE THAT  

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:04.390
THIS BECAUSE YOU&apos;RE TALKING     
ABOUT MAYBE HOW TO CHANGE THAT  
TOOL BUT IT STILL HAS           

01:36:04.392 --> 01:36:07.493
ABOUT MAYBE HOW TO CHANGE THAT  
TOOL BUT IT STILL HAS           
LIMITATIONS IN IT BEING ZONING. 

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:08.961
TOOL BUT IT STILL HAS           
LIMITATIONS IN IT BEING ZONING.

PART OF THAT.                   

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:39.303
AND THAT SOMEHOW THE CITY IS    
PART OF THAT.                   
AND AGAIN, I KNOW THAT THAT&apos;S A 

01:54:39.305 --> 01:54:39.805
PART OF THAT.                   
AND AGAIN, I KNOW THAT THAT&apos;S A 
STRATEGY, NOT A GOAL.           

01:54:39.807 --> 01:54:43.141
AND AGAIN, I KNOW THAT THAT&apos;S A 
STRATEGY, NOT A GOAL.           
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO   

01:54:43.143 --> 01:54:43.875
STRATEGY, NOT A GOAL.           
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO   
KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE    

01:54:43.877 --> 01:54:44.676
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO   
KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE    
NOT JUST THINKING OF OUR LITTLE 

01:54:44.678 --> 01:54:47.111
KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT WE&apos;RE    
NOT JUST THINKING OF OUR LITTLE 
PIECEMEAL THINGS AS WE&apos;RE GOING 

01:54:47.113 --> 01:54:47.779
NOT JUST THINKING OF OUR LITTLE 
PIECEMEAL THINGS AS WE&apos;RE GOING 
ALONG PRIVATE SITE BY PRIVATE   

01:54:47.781 --> 01:54:50.715
PIECEMEAL THINGS AS WE&apos;RE GOING 
ALONG PRIVATE SITE BY PRIVATE   
SITE BUT ALSO NOT IGNORING      

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:54.119
ALONG PRIVATE SITE BY PRIVATE   
SITE BUT ALSO NOT IGNORING      
POTENTIAL WAYS FOR US TO        

01:54:54.121 --> 01:54:57.288
SITE BUT ALSO NOT IGNORING      
POTENTIAL WAYS FOR US TO        
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO  

01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:58.156
POTENTIAL WAYS FOR US TO        
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO  
HAVE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN   

01:54:58.158 --> 01:55:03.762
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO  
HAVE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN   
THEIR BUILDING DESIGNING OH     

01:55:03.764 --> 01:55:07.665
HAVE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN   
THEIR BUILDING DESIGNING OH     
INFORMATIONALLY.                

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:11.136
THEIR BUILDING DESIGNING OH     
INFORMATIONALLY.                
OH YEAH I DID THAT IN THE FIRST 

01:55:11.138 --> 01:55:12.136
INFORMATIONALLY.                
OH YEAH I DID THAT IN THE FIRST 
OK HOW ABOUT AS FAR AS RIBIS    

01:55:12.138 --> 01:55:16.174
OH YEAH I DID THAT IN THE FIRST 
OK HOW ABOUT AS FAR AS RIBIS    
GOES HOW ABOUT JUST INCREASED   

01:55:16.176 --> 01:55:16.574
OK HOW ABOUT AS FAR AS RIBIS    
GOES HOW ABOUT JUST INCREASED   
HOUSING PERIOD.                 

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:19.311
GOES HOW ABOUT JUST INCREASED   
HOUSING PERIOD.                 
I&apos;M JUST WONDERING IF THAT THAT 

01:55:19.313 --> 01:55:19.977
HOUSING PERIOD.                 
I&apos;M JUST WONDERING IF THAT THAT 
FOR DISCUSSION BECAUSE          

01:55:19.979 --> 01:55:22.647
I&apos;M JUST WONDERING IF THAT THAT 
FOR DISCUSSION BECAUSE          
OBVIOUSLY I THINK THERE&apos;S       

01:55:22.649 --> 01:55:23.048
FOR DISCUSSION BECAUSE          
OBVIOUSLY I THINK THERE&apos;S       
OVERLAPS RIGHT.                 

01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:23.881
OBVIOUSLY I THINK THERE&apos;S       
OVERLAPS RIGHT.                 
INCREASING EQUITY ALSO MEANS    

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:26.918
OVERLAPS RIGHT.                 
INCREASING EQUITY ALSO MEANS    
IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY.        

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:27.953
INCREASING EQUITY ALSO MEANS    
IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY.        
IT MEANS SO SO I MEAN THERE&apos;S   

01:55:27.955 --> 01:55:30.922
IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY.        
IT MEANS SO SO I MEAN THERE&apos;S   
THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAP.      

01:55:30.924 --> 01:55:31.690
IT MEANS SO SO I MEAN THERE&apos;S   
THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAP.      
THE QUESTION IS SHOULD ONE      

01:55:31.692 --> 01:55:32.390
THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAP.      
THE QUESTION IS SHOULD ONE      
OF THE GOALS RELATED TO         

01:55:32.392 --> 01:55:35.494
THE QUESTION IS SHOULD ONE      
OF THE GOALS RELATED TO         
PREMIUM&apos;S BE JUST TO ADD MORE   

01:55:35.496 --> 01:55:35.760
OF THE GOALS RELATED TO         
PREMIUM&apos;S BE JUST TO ADD MORE   
HOUSING?                        

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:36.261
PREMIUM&apos;S BE JUST TO ADD MORE   
HOUSING?                        
I DON&apos;T KNOW.                   

01:55:36.263 --> 01:55:39.330
HOUSING?                        
I DON&apos;T KNOW.                   
JUST SIMPLIFY BUT JUST THROW    

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:39.865
I DON&apos;T KNOW.                   
JUST SIMPLIFY BUT JUST THROW    
THAT OUT THERE.                 

01:55:39.867 --> 01:55:42.767
JUST SIMPLIFY BUT JUST THROW    
THAT OUT THERE.                 
CAN I PIGGYBACK ON THAT BECAUSE 

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:46.504
THAT OUT THERE.                 
CAN I PIGGYBACK ON THAT BECAUSE 
AND I I DON&apos;T KNOW IF THIS IS   

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:47.372
CAN I PIGGYBACK ON THAT BECAUSE 
AND I I DON&apos;T KNOW IF THIS IS   
ALREADY IF THIS IS ENCOMPASSED  

01:55:47.374 --> 01:55:50.241
AND I I DON&apos;T KNOW IF THIS IS   
ALREADY IF THIS IS ENCOMPASSED  
IN EQUITY OR AFFORDABILITY OR   

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:51.042
ALREADY IF THIS IS ENCOMPASSED  
IN EQUITY OR AFFORDABILITY OR   
NOT BUT I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT  

01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:53.911
IN EQUITY OR AFFORDABILITY OR   
NOT BUT I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT  
TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY       

01:55:53.913 --> 01:55:54.712
NOT BUT I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT  
TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY       
OF HOUSING LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS 

01:55:54.714 --> 01:55:58.417
TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY       
OF HOUSING LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS 
OF HOUSING SO THAT IT ISN&apos;T ALL 

01:55:58.419 --> 01:56:01.820
OF HOUSING LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS 
OF HOUSING SO THAT IT ISN&apos;T ALL 
IT&apos;S NOT JUST THAT THERE&apos;S      

01:56:01.822 --> 01:56:02.621
OF HOUSING SO THAT IT ISN&apos;T ALL 
IT&apos;S NOT JUST THAT THERE&apos;S      
EITHER EXPENSIVE STUDENT TOWERS 

01:56:02.623 --> 01:56:05.823
IT&apos;S NOT JUST THAT THERE&apos;S      
EITHER EXPENSIVE STUDENT TOWERS 
OR EXPENSIVE LOW RISE CONDOS    

01:56:05.825 --> 01:56:09.260
EITHER EXPENSIVE STUDENT TOWERS 
OR EXPENSIVE LOW RISE CONDOS    
BUT IT&apos;S ALSO THAT THERE JUST   

01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:12.563
OR EXPENSIVE LOW RISE CONDOS    
BUT IT&apos;S ALSO THAT THERE JUST   
ISN&apos;T THERE IS IT MULTIFAMILY   

01:56:12.565 --> 01:56:12.964
BUT IT&apos;S ALSO THAT THERE JUST   
ISN&apos;T THERE IS IT MULTIFAMILY   
HOUSING?                        

01:56:12.966 --> 01:56:13.364
ISN&apos;T THERE IS IT MULTIFAMILY   
HOUSING?                        
YEAH.                           

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:14.132
HOUSING?                        
YEAH.                           
YOU KNOW, ANY SORT              

01:56:14.134 --> 01:56:17.235
YEAH.                           
YOU KNOW, ANY SORT              
OF ACCESSIBLE RIGHT OF IT.      

01:56:17.237 --> 01:56:18.269
YOU KNOW, ANY SORT              
OF ACCESSIBLE RIGHT OF IT.      
I MEAN THE CONDO THAT&apos;S NOT     

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:21.038
OF ACCESSIBLE RIGHT OF IT.      
I MEAN THE CONDO THAT&apos;S NOT     
MULTIFAMILY, IT&apos;S NOT LARGE     

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:21.706
I MEAN THE CONDO THAT&apos;S NOT     
MULTIFAMILY, IT&apos;S NOT LARGE     
SCALE MULTIFAMILY IS WHAT I&apos;M   

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:24.809
MULTIFAMILY, IT&apos;S NOT LARGE     
SCALE MULTIFAMILY IS WHAT I&apos;M   
TRYING TO SAY AND NOT GETTING   

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:25.043
SCALE MULTIFAMILY IS WHAT I&apos;M   
TRYING TO SAY AND NOT GETTING   
OUT.                            

01:56:25.045 --> 01:56:26.110
TRYING TO SAY AND NOT GETTING   
OUT.                            
YEAH I WOULD 100 PERCENT BE     

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:28.646
OUT.                            
YEAH I WOULD 100 PERCENT BE     
FRIENDLY WITH THAT CONCEPT      

01:56:28.648 --> 01:56:29.280
YEAH I WOULD 100 PERCENT BE     
FRIENDLY WITH THAT CONCEPT      
INCREASE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING   

01:56:29.282 --> 01:56:33.317
FRIENDLY WITH THAT CONCEPT      
INCREASE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING   
SO INCREASING HOUSING AND       

01:56:33.319 --> 01:56:36.987
INCREASE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING   
SO INCREASING HOUSING AND       
DIVERSITY.                      

01:56:36.989 --> 01:56:37.789
SO INCREASING HOUSING AND       
DIVERSITY.                      
SO WHAT I&apos;M HEARING ARE THREE   

01:56:37.791 --> 01:56:38.189
DIVERSITY.                      
SO WHAT I&apos;M HEARING ARE THREE   
THINGS.                         

01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:40.591
SO WHAT I&apos;M HEARING ARE THREE   
THINGS.                         
NUMBER ONE IS IT THE VOLUME     

01:56:40.593 --> 01:56:41.425
THINGS.                         
NUMBER ONE IS IT THE VOLUME     
OF HOUSING IS IT IS THE SHEER   

01:56:41.427 --> 01:56:44.495
NUMBER ONE IS IT THE VOLUME     
OF HOUSING IS IT IS THE SHEER   
NUMBER OF UNITS IS IT THE       

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:45.296
OF HOUSING IS IT IS THE SHEER   
NUMBER OF UNITS IS IT THE       
DIVERSITY OF THE TYPES OF UNITS 

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:48.466
NUMBER OF UNITS IS IT THE       
DIVERSITY OF THE TYPES OF UNITS 
ALSO THAT AND IS IT THE         

01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:51.102
DIVERSITY OF THE TYPES OF UNITS 
ALSO THAT AND IS IT THE         
AFFORDABILITY OF THE UNITS THAT 

01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:51.802
ALSO THAT AND IS IT THE         
AFFORDABILITY OF THE UNITS THAT 
TIES IN WITH BOTH?              

01:56:51.804 --> 01:56:55.440
AFFORDABILITY OF THE UNITS THAT 
TIES IN WITH BOTH?              
I THINK LIKE IT COULD AND IT    

01:56:55.442 --> 01:56:55.873
TIES IN WITH BOTH?              
I THINK LIKE IT COULD AND IT    
COULD NOT.                      

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:56.808
I THINK LIKE IT COULD AND IT    
COULD NOT.                      
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT   

01:56:56.810 --> 01:56:59.344
COULD NOT.                      
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT   
IT IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY.   

01:56:59.346 --> 01:57:02.680
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT   
IT IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY.   
I MEAN THAT HAS TO BE           

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:03.681
IT IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY.   
I MEAN THAT HAS TO BE           
SUBSIDIZED OR THAT THEY HAVE TO 

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:05.850
I MEAN THAT HAS TO BE           
SUBSIDIZED OR THAT THEY HAVE TO 
BE AFFORDABLE IN PERPETUITY     

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:06.718
SUBSIDIZED OR THAT THEY HAVE TO 
BE AFFORDABLE IN PERPETUITY     
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE JUST         

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:07.385
BE AFFORDABLE IN PERPETUITY     
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE JUST         
INCREASING THE NUMBER IT COULD  

01:57:07.387 --> 01:57:10.388
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE JUST         
INCREASING THE NUMBER IT COULD  
INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY AT   

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:11.322
INCREASING THE NUMBER IT COULD  
INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY AT   
THAT TIME IN THE MARKET BY      

01:57:11.324 --> 01:57:14.726
INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY AT   
THAT TIME IN THE MARKET BY      
TWENTY YEARS LATER IT MAY NOT   

01:57:14.728 --> 01:57:17.962
THAT TIME IN THE MARKET BY      
TWENTY YEARS LATER IT MAY NOT   
BE GUARANTEED.                  

01:57:17.964 --> 01:57:19.163
TWENTY YEARS LATER IT MAY NOT   
BE GUARANTEED.                  
AND WHEN WE WENT ROUND BEFORE I 

01:57:19.165 --> 01:57:25.469
BE GUARANTEED.                  
AND WHEN WE WENT ROUND BEFORE I 
REMEMBER WHEN STAKEHOLDERS WERE 

01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:26.203
AND WHEN WE WENT ROUND BEFORE I 
REMEMBER WHEN STAKEHOLDERS WERE 
VERY CONCERNED THAT AFFORDABLE  

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:28.673
REMEMBER WHEN STAKEHOLDERS WERE 
VERY CONCERNED THAT AFFORDABLE  
UNITS WERE BUILT NOW WOULDN&apos;T   

01:57:28.675 --> 01:57:31.943
VERY CONCERNED THAT AFFORDABLE  
UNITS WERE BUILT NOW WOULDN&apos;T   
BE SO IN 20 YEARS.              

01:57:31.945 --> 01:57:34.745
UNITS WERE BUILT NOW WOULDN&apos;T   
BE SO IN 20 YEARS.              
SO I THINK IT&apos;S THREE CONCEPTS  

01:57:34.747 --> 01:57:35.146
BE SO IN 20 YEARS.              
SO I THINK IT&apos;S THREE CONCEPTS  
AMONG YOU.                      

01:57:35.148 --> 01:57:36.314
SO I THINK IT&apos;S THREE CONCEPTS  
AMONG YOU.                      
I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT FOR YOU  

01:57:36.316 --> 01:57:42.887
AMONG YOU.                      
I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT FOR YOU  
TO DEFINE WHAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S         

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:43.821
I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT FOR YOU  
TO DEFINE WHAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S         
IMPORTANT OR WHETHER YOU WANT   

01:57:43.823 --> 01:57:44.456
TO DEFINE WHAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S         
IMPORTANT OR WHETHER YOU WANT   
ALL THREE OF THOSE DISCUSSED    

01:57:44.458 --> 01:57:47.091
IMPORTANT OR WHETHER YOU WANT   
ALL THREE OF THOSE DISCUSSED    
WITH STAKEHOLDERS.              

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:48.159
ALL THREE OF THOSE DISCUSSED    
WITH STAKEHOLDERS.              
NOW I DO WANT VOLUME AND        

01:57:48.161 --> 01:57:51.762
WITH STAKEHOLDERS.              
NOW I DO WANT VOLUME AND        
DIVERSITY AND I&apos;M A LITTLE BIT  

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:52.096
NOW I DO WANT VOLUME AND        
DIVERSITY AND I&apos;M A LITTLE BIT  
TORN.                           

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:54.832
DIVERSITY AND I&apos;M A LITTLE BIT  
TORN.                           
I&apos;M VERY TORN ABOUT             

01:57:54.834 --> 01:57:55.499
TORN.                           
I&apos;M VERY TORN ABOUT             
AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE IT&apos;S      

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:58.302
I&apos;M VERY TORN ABOUT             
AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE IT&apos;S      
AFFORDABILITY STRICTLY          

01:57:58.304 --> 01:57:58.669
AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE IT&apos;S      
AFFORDABILITY STRICTLY          
SPEAKING.                       

01:57:58.671 --> 01:57:59.337
AFFORDABILITY STRICTLY          
SPEAKING.                       
I&apos;M NOT SURE THAT WE&apos;RE GOING   

01:57:59.339 --> 01:58:02.540
SPEAKING.                       
I&apos;M NOT SURE THAT WE&apos;RE GOING   
TO GET THAT OUT OF WHAT WE&apos;RE   

01:58:02.542 --> 01:58:03.475
I&apos;M NOT SURE THAT WE&apos;RE GOING   
TO GET THAT OUT OF WHAT WE&apos;RE

THAT IS TO SAY PEOPLE THEY LOST 

02:02:08.854 --> 02:02:09.686
CHANGED.                        
THAT IS TO SAY PEOPLE THEY LOST 
BETWEEN THREE AND SIX THOUSAND  

02:02:09.688 --> 02:02:13.123
THAT IS TO SAY PEOPLE THEY LOST 
BETWEEN THREE AND SIX THOUSAND  
PERSONS IN THE DOWNTOWN THROUGH 

02:02:13.125 --> 02:02:17.394
BETWEEN THREE AND SIX THOUSAND  
PERSONS IN THE DOWNTOWN THROUGH 
OFFICE AND IF WHAT WE ARE       

02:02:17.396 --> 02:02:21.165
PERSONS IN THE DOWNTOWN THROUGH 
OFFICE AND IF WHAT WE ARE       
ULTIMATELY TRYING TO DO IS      

02:02:21.167 --> 02:02:23.801
OFFICE AND IF WHAT WE ARE       
ULTIMATELY TRYING TO DO IS      
REPLACE JUST FOR A PLACEHOLDER  

02:02:23.803 --> 02:02:24.735
ULTIMATELY TRYING TO DO IS      
REPLACE JUST FOR A PLACEHOLDER  
THOSE THREE TO SIX THOUSAND     

02:02:24.737 --> 02:02:28.605
REPLACE JUST FOR A PLACEHOLDER  
THOSE THREE TO SIX THOUSAND     
PEOPLE, THEN I&apos;D LIKE US TO BE  

02:02:28.607 --> 02:02:32.243
THOSE THREE TO SIX THOUSAND     
PEOPLE, THEN I&apos;D LIKE US TO BE  
CLEAR THAT THAT IS OUR GOAL IF  

02:02:32.245 --> 02:02:36.146
PEOPLE, THEN I&apos;D LIKE US TO BE  
CLEAR THAT THAT IS OUR GOAL IF  
OUR GOAL IS MORE THAN THAT THEN 

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:36.980
CLEAR THAT THAT IS OUR GOAL IF  
OUR GOAL IS MORE THAN THAT THEN 
WE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE&apos;RE      

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:38.549
OUR GOAL IS MORE THAN THAT THEN 
WE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE&apos;RE      
DOING.

WE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE&apos;RE      
DOING.                          
BUT IN ORDER FOR THE DOWNTOWN   

02:02:39.685 --> 02:02:42.820
DOING.                          
BUT IN ORDER FOR THE DOWNTOWN   
TO BE VIABLE THEY NEED PEOPLE   

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:46.957
BUT IN ORDER FOR THE DOWNTOWN   
TO BE VIABLE THEY NEED PEOPLE   
AND HOUSING DOESN&apos;T REPLACE THE 

02:02:46.959 --> 02:02:47.725
TO BE VIABLE THEY NEED PEOPLE   
AND HOUSING DOESN&apos;T REPLACE THE 
SHEER DENSITY OF PEOPLE THE WAY 

02:02:47.727 --> 02:02:50.594
AND HOUSING DOESN&apos;T REPLACE THE 
SHEER DENSITY OF PEOPLE THE WAY 
AN OFFICE US.                   

02:02:50.596 --> 02:02:54.265
SHEER DENSITY OF PEOPLE THE WAY 
AN OFFICE US.                   
SO WE&apos;D HAVE TO BUILD A LOT     

02:02:54.267 --> 02:02:55.166
AN OFFICE US.                   
SO WE&apos;D HAVE TO BUILD A LOT     
MORE HOUSING THAN WHAT IS       

02:02:55.168 --> 02:02:58.502
SO WE&apos;D HAVE TO BUILD A LOT     
MORE HOUSING THAN WHAT IS       
CURRENTLY PERMITTED AND WHAT IS 

02:02:58.504 --> 02:02:59.336
MORE HOUSING THAN WHAT IS       
CURRENTLY PERMITTED AND WHAT IS 
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO 

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:01.839
CURRENTLY PERMITTED AND WHAT IS 
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO 
ACHIEVE THE SHEER NUMBER THAT   

02:03:01.841 --> 02:03:02.906
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO 
ACHIEVE THE SHEER NUMBER THAT   
THEY LOST BECAUSE OF COFAN AND  

02:03:02.908 --> 02:03:06.277
ACHIEVE THE SHEER NUMBER THAT   
THEY LOST BECAUSE OF COFAN AND  
SO THAT&apos;S WHAT I WAS ASKING     

02:03:06.279 --> 02:03:09.847
THEY LOST BECAUSE OF COFAN AND  
SO THAT&apos;S WHAT I WAS ASKING

POINT WHERE WE&apos;RE TRYING TO     
PERMIT A THING WE WANT TO DO    
UNLESS I AM I MEAN I COULD BE   

02:04:15.881 --> 02:04:16.814

UNLESS I AM I MEAN I COULD BE   
OVER HERE ON AN ISLAND ALL BY   

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:17.448
UNLESS I AM I MEAN I COULD BE   
OVER HERE ON AN ISLAND ALL BY   
MYSELF BUT THIS IS WHAT I&apos;M     

02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:19.716
OVER HERE ON AN ISLAND ALL BY   
MYSELF BUT THIS IS WHAT I&apos;M     
WHAT I&apos;M SENSING.               

02:04:19.718 --> 02:04:24.622
MYSELF BUT THIS IS WHAT I&apos;M     
WHAT I&apos;M SENSING.               
I THINK IF I MAY, WHICH IS      

02:04:24.624 --> 02:04:27.625
WHAT I&apos;M SENSING.               
I THINK IF I MAY, WHICH IS      
PROBABLY ON THE NEXT SLIDE LIKE 

02:04:27.627 --> 02:04:31.028
I THINK IF I MAY, WHICH IS      
PROBABLY ON THE NEXT SLIDE LIKE 
THE IDEA OF WE&apos;RE IN THE IN THE 

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.796
PROBABLY ON THE NEXT SLIDE LIKE 
THE IDEA OF WE&apos;RE IN THE IN THE 
STAFF REPORT THE REPORT THAT    

02:04:31.798 --> 02:04:34.898
THE IDEA OF WE&apos;RE IN THE IN THE 
STAFF REPORT THE REPORT THAT    
YOU WRITE LIKE THERE WAS VOTING 

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:35.666
STAFF REPORT THE REPORT THAT    
YOU WRITE LIKE THERE WAS VOTING 
RESULTS FROM LAST TIME THE      

02:04:35.668 --> 02:04:36.500
YOU WRITE LIKE THERE WAS VOTING 
RESULTS FROM LAST TIME THE      
SMALL MENU OR NO INCENTIVE IT   

02:04:36.502 --> 02:04:39.737
RESULTS FROM LAST TIME THE      
SMALL MENU OR NO INCENTIVE IT   
JUST CHRIS DANCY I THINK I KNOW 

02:04:39.739 --> 02:04:43.174
SMALL MENU OR NO INCENTIVE IT   
JUST CHRIS DANCY I THINK I KNOW 
WHICH CAMP OF I THINK THAT      

02:04:43.176 --> 02:04:47.044
JUST CHRIS DANCY I THINK I KNOW 
WHICH CAMP OF I THINK THAT      
THERE&apos;S ALSO SOME PEOPLE THAT   

02:04:47.046 --> 02:04:47.712
WHICH CAMP OF I THINK THAT      
THERE&apos;S ALSO SOME PEOPLE THAT   
ARE SAYING SMALL MENU.          

02:04:47.714 --> 02:04:51.148
THERE&apos;S ALSO SOME PEOPLE THAT   
ARE SAYING SMALL MENU.          
SO I THINK RIGHT NOW THIS IS A  

02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:51.883
ARE SAYING SMALL MENU.          
SO I THINK RIGHT NOW THIS IS A  
SMALLER MENU THAN WHAT IT WAS   

02:04:51.885 --> 02:04:53.784
SO I THINK RIGHT NOW THIS IS A  
SMALLER MENU THAN WHAT IT WAS   
BEFORE ONE OF THEM I THINK      

02:04:53.786 --> 02:04:54.618
SMALLER MENU THAN WHAT IT WAS   
BEFORE ONE OF THEM I THINK      
BECAUSE THAT THAT NO INCENTIVE  

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:57.822
BEFORE ONE OF THEM I THINK      
BECAUSE THAT THAT NO INCENTIVE  
INCREASED DENSITY THIS DOESN&apos;T  

02:04:57.824 --> 02:04:58.756
BECAUSE THAT THAT NO INCENTIVE  
INCREASED DENSITY THIS DOESN&apos;T  
GET AT THE JUST MORE HOUSING    

02:04:58.758 --> 02:04:58.956
INCREASED DENSITY THIS DOESN&apos;T  
GET AT THE JUST MORE HOUSING    
UNITS.                          

02:04:58.958 --> 02:05:01.525
GET AT THE JUST MORE HOUSING    
UNITS.                          
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT ALONE  

02:05:01.527 --> 02:05:02.693
UNITS.                          
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT ALONE  
PROBABLY MAKES SENSE AS AS ITS  

02:05:02.695 --> 02:05:06.563
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT ALONE  
PROBABLY MAKES SENSE AS AS ITS  
OWN GOAL BECAUSE I THINK THAT   

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:07.264
PROBABLY MAKES SENSE AS AS ITS  
OWN GOAL BECAUSE I THINK THAT   
THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT   

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:09.333
OWN GOAL BECAUSE I THINK THAT   
THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT   
IS A GOAL.                      

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.201
THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT   
IS A GOAL.                      
AND THEN WHAT I HEARD FROM      

02:05:10.203 --> 02:05:11.034
IS A GOAL.                      
AND THEN WHAT I HEARD FROM      
BEFORE YOU GUYS CAN TELL ME     

02:05:11.036 --> 02:05:13.704
AND THEN WHAT I HEARD FROM      
BEFORE YOU GUYS CAN TELL ME     
FROM MAKING THIS UP IS THAT THE 

02:05:13.706 --> 02:05:17.341
BEFORE YOU GUYS CAN TELL ME     
FROM MAKING THIS UP IS THAT THE 
INCREASE SO THAT MAKE THAT THE  

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:18.042
FROM MAKING THIS UP IS THAT THE 
INCREASE SO THAT MAKE THAT THE  
FIRST ONE MAYBE THIS IS         

02:05:18.044 --> 02:05:21.545
INCREASE SO THAT MAKE THAT THE  
FIRST ONE MAYBE THIS IS         
DAINTILY I THAT&apos;S STILL ON THE  

02:05:21.547 --> 02:05:22.146
FIRST ONE MAYBE THIS IS         
DAINTILY I THAT&apos;S STILL ON THE  
MENU BECAUSE EVEN WITH          

02:05:22.148 --> 02:05:25.149
DAINTILY I THAT&apos;S STILL ON THE  
MENU BECAUSE EVEN WITH          
GEOTHERMAL THERE&apos;S A MORE       

02:05:25.151 --> 02:05:25.949
MENU BECAUSE EVEN WITH          
GEOTHERMAL THERE&apos;S A MORE       
EFFICIENT BUILDINGS WITH LESS   

02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:26.284
GEOTHERMAL THERE&apos;S A MORE       
EFFICIENT BUILDINGS WITH LESS   
OF IT.                          

02:05:26.286 --> 02:05:29.620
EFFICIENT BUILDINGS WITH LESS   
OF IT.                          
OK, SO AND THEN THE THIRD ONE   

02:05:29.622 --> 02:05:33.123
OF IT.                          
OK, SO AND THEN THE THIRD ONE   
THE INCREASED EQUITY IN THE     

02:05:33.125 --> 02:05:33.724
OK, SO AND THEN THE THIRD ONE   
THE INCREASED EQUITY IN THE     
DOWNTOWN WHAT I HEARD WAS       

02:05:33.726 --> 02:05:36.193
THE INCREASED EQUITY IN THE     
DOWNTOWN WHAT I HEARD WAS       
AFFORDABILITY AND MIX OF UNITS  

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:37.128
DOWNTOWN WHAT I HEARD WAS       
AFFORDABILITY AND MIX OF UNITS  
GET TOWARDS THAT THEN THAT CAN  

02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:40.464
AFFORDABILITY AND MIX OF UNITS  
GET TOWARDS THAT THEN THAT CAN  
BE IN THAT&apos;S ACTUALLY ONE       

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:41.165
GET TOWARDS THAT THEN THAT CAN  
BE IN THAT&apos;S ACTUALLY ONE       
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I STARTED 

02:05:41.167 --> 02:05:44.334
BE IN THAT&apos;S ACTUALLY ONE       
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I STARTED 
WITH IS WHAT WE SEE IN          

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:47.638
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I STARTED 
WITH IS WHAT WE SEE IN          
INCREASING EQUITY DOWN LIKE     

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:51.142
WITH IS WHAT WE SEE IN          
INCREASING EQUITY DOWN LIKE     
OVERLAP MAYBE NOT COMPLETELY.   

02:05:51.144 --> 02:05:52.209
INCREASING EQUITY DOWN LIKE     
OVERLAP MAYBE NOT COMPLETELY.   
I SEE SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN THAT 

02:05:52.211 --> 02:05:52.743
OVERLAP MAYBE NOT COMPLETELY.   
I SEE SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN THAT 
AND AFFORDABILITY.              

02:05:52.745 --> 02:05:55.546
I SEE SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN THAT 
AND AFFORDABILITY.              
I&apos;M JUST TRYING TO BE WIDER     

02:05:55.548 --> 02:05:55.880
AND AFFORDABILITY.              
I&apos;M JUST TRYING TO BE WIDER     
DISTINCT.                       

02:05:55.882 --> 02:05:56.847
I&apos;M JUST TRYING TO BE WIDER     
DISTINCT.                       
SO NOW WE GO TOWARDS THAT JUST  

02:05:56.849 --> 02:06:00.084
DISTINCT.                       
SO NOW WE GO TOWARDS THAT JUST  
MORE UNITS SUSTAINABILITY AND   

02:06:00.086 --> 02:06:03.187
SO NOW WE GO TOWARDS THAT JUST  
MORE UNITS SUSTAINABILITY AND   
ACCESSIBILITY, AFFORDABILITY    

02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.855
MORE UNITS SUSTAINABILITY AND   
ACCESSIBILITY, AFFORDABILITY    
AND INABILITY TO ACTUALLY USE   

02:06:03.857 --> 02:06:07.057
ACCESSIBILITY, AFFORDABILITY

PROBABLY LIKE ONE SIXTY ONE     
SEVENTY FOUR AND THEN YOU GET   

02:36:55.472 --> 02:36:57.940
PROBABLY LIKE ONE SIXTY ONE     
SEVENTY FOUR AND THEN YOU GET   
TO LIKE EACH STEAL YOU CAN GET  

02:36:57.942 --> 02:36:58.573
SEVENTY FOUR AND THEN YOU GET
