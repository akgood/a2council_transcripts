00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:55.721
PURVIEW OF OUR GROUP.           
SO I BELIEVE THOSE THINGS       
TOTALLY DROP OUT REGARDING THE  

00:37:55.723 --> 00:37:56.422
SO I BELIEVE THOSE THINGS       
TOTALLY DROP OUT REGARDING THE  
ONE THAT MIGHT PERHAPS BE       

00:37:56.424 --> 00:37:57.189
TOTALLY DROP OUT REGARDING THE  
ONE THAT MIGHT PERHAPS BE       
LARGER IN SOME OF THE REVIEWS   

00:37:57.191 --> 00:37:59.959
ONE THAT MIGHT PERHAPS BE       
LARGER IN SOME OF THE REVIEWS   
REGARDING THE NUMBER OF WINDOWS 

00:37:59.961 --> 00:38:03.695
LARGER IN SOME OF THE REVIEWS   
REGARDING THE NUMBER OF WINDOWS 
WHERE NOW THERE&amp;apos;S A BLANK WALL  

00:38:03.697 --> 00:38:07.132
REGARDING THE NUMBER OF WINDOWS 
WHERE NOW THERE&amp;apos;S A BLANK WALL  
ESSENTIALLY A PRIVACY CONCERN   

00:38:07.134 --> 00:38:07.933
WHERE NOW THERE&amp;apos;S A BLANK WALL  
ESSENTIALLY A PRIVACY CONCERN   
BUT OF COURSE THE BUILDING      

00:38:07.935 --> 00:38:08.600
ESSENTIALLY A PRIVACY CONCERN   
BUT OF COURSE THE BUILDING      
ENVELOPES AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO       

00:38:08.602 --> 00:38:08.868
BUT OF COURSE THE BUILDING      
ENVELOPES AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO       
CHANGE.                         

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.136
ENVELOPES AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO       
CHANGE.                         
THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT GOING TO GET CLOSER 

00:38:11.138 --> 00:38:12.171
CHANGE.                         
THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT GOING TO GET CLOSER 
TO EACH OTHER AND THIS IS       

00:38:12.173 --> 00:38:12.905
THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT GOING TO GET CLOSER 
TO EACH OTHER AND THIS IS       
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED 

00:38:12.907 --> 00:38:15.375
TO EACH OTHER AND THIS IS       
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED 
OBVIOUSLY WITH WINDOW           

00:38:15.377 --> 00:38:15.775
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED 
OBVIOUSLY WITH WINDOW           
TREATMENTS.                     

00:38:15.777 --> 00:38:16.909
OBVIOUSLY WITH WINDOW           
TREATMENTS.                     
SO IN MY VIEW THIS DROPS OUT AS 

00:38:16.911 --> 00:38:19.378
TREATMENTS.

AND JULIE, THIS QUESTION HAS    

00:54:32.386 --> 00:54:33.251
THINKING THIS WOULD BE EASY.    
AND JULIE, THIS QUESTION HAS    
NOW GOT MY BRAIN WORKING        

00:54:33.253 --> 00:54:36.721
AND JULIE, THIS QUESTION HAS    
NOW GOT MY BRAIN WORKING        
OVERTIME SO I UNDERSTAND THIS   

00:54:36.723 --> 00:54:37.655
NOW GOT MY BRAIN WORKING        
OVERTIME SO I UNDERSTAND THIS   
IS BEING LOOKED AT UNDER THE    

00:54:37.657 --> 00:54:40.826
OVERTIME SO I UNDERSTAND THIS   
IS BEING LOOKED AT UNDER THE    
SEEKING OF VARIOUS CRITERIA BUT 

00:54:40.828 --> 00:54:43.528
IS BEING LOOKED AT UNDER THE    
SEEKING OF VARIOUS CRITERIA BUT 
UNDER THE STANDARDS             

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:44.162
SEEKING OF VARIOUS CRITERIA BUT 
UNDER THE STANDARDS             
OF ALTERATION TO A              

00:54:44.164 --> 00:54:47.565
UNDER THE STANDARDS             
OF ALTERATION TO A              
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE THERE&amp;apos;S 

00:54:47.567 --> 00:54:48.433
OF ALTERATION TO A              
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE THERE&amp;apos;S 
WHICH JOHN IS REMINDED ME       

00:54:48.435 --> 00:54:51.536
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE THERE&amp;apos;S 
WHICH JOHN IS REMINDED ME       
OF MORE THAN ONCE THAT IF YOU   

00:54:51.538 --> 00:54:52.437
WHICH JOHN IS REMINDED ME       
OF MORE THAN ONCE THAT IF YOU   
TEAR THE STRUCTURE DOWN AND IF  

00:54:52.439 --> 00:54:55.540
OF MORE THAN ONCE THAT IF YOU   
TEAR THE STRUCTURE DOWN AND IF  
THIS THING IS DEVELOPING AND    

00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:56.475
TEAR THE STRUCTURE DOWN AND IF  
THIS THING IS DEVELOPING AND    
THEY SAY IT IS JUST NOT WORTH   

00:54:56.477 --> 00:55:00.078
THIS THING IS DEVELOPING AND    
THEY SAY IT IS JUST NOT WORTH   
VERY MUCH THEN IT SHOULD NOT BE 

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.445
THEY SAY IT IS JUST NOT WORTH   
VERY MUCH THEN IT SHOULD NOT BE 
REPLACED.                       

00:55:00.447 --> 00:55:04.282
VERY MUCH THEN IT SHOULD NOT BE 
REPLACED.                       
SO I REALIZE THERE ARE TWO      

00:55:04.284 --> 00:55:08.553

THAT IS UNIQUE JUST TO SLOT IF  

00:57:03.469 --> 00:57:07.105
DOES IT SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM    
THAT IS UNIQUE JUST TO SLOT IF  
YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEY THERE IS 

00:57:07.107 --> 00:57:07.839
THAT IS UNIQUE JUST TO SLOT IF  
YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEY THERE IS 
AN EXISTING GARAGE JUST BEHIND  

00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:11.008
YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEY THERE IS 
AN EXISTING GARAGE JUST BEHIND  
THIS PROPERTY THAT PROBABLY     

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:11.675
AN EXISTING GARAGE JUST BEHIND  
THIS PROPERTY THAT PROBABLY     
WOULD RUN INTO THE SAME         

00:57:11.677 --> 00:57:12.344
THIS PROPERTY THAT PROBABLY     
WOULD RUN INTO THE SAME         
PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEEDED TO    

00:57:12.346 --> 00:57:14.979
WOULD RUN INTO THE SAME         
PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEEDED TO    
REPLACE IT.                     

00:57:14.981 --> 00:57:16.180
PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEEDED TO

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE WE GO.                 
YES, I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS  
OF NEIGHBORS THAT IT IS         

01:31:11.449 --> 01:31:13.983
YES, I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS  
OF NEIGHBORS THAT IT IS         
FRIGHTENING WHEN SOMEBODY NEW   

01:31:13.985 --> 01:31:15.184
OF NEIGHBORS THAT IT IS         
FRIGHTENING WHEN SOMEBODY NEW   
COMES IN AND BUYS UP BUILDINGS  

01:31:15.186 --> 01:31:18.821
FRIGHTENING WHEN SOMEBODY NEW   
COMES IN AND BUYS UP BUILDINGS  
AND HAS BASICALLY A GOAL        

01:31:18.823 --> 01:31:22.491
COMES IN AND BUYS UP BUILDINGS  
AND HAS BASICALLY A GOAL        
OF MAKING PROFIT BECAUSE THAT&amp;apos;S 

01:31:22.493 --> 01:31:23.158
AND HAS BASICALLY A GOAL        
OF MAKING PROFIT BECAUSE THAT&amp;apos;S 
WHY YOU BECOME A LANDLORD.      

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.629
OF MAKING PROFIT BECAUSE THAT&amp;apos;S 
WHY YOU BECOME A LANDLORD.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT I THINK LOOKING LONG     

01:31:26.631 --> 01:31:29.264
WHY YOU BECOME A LANDLORD.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT I THINK LOOKING LONG     
TERM IN THE CITY DOES HAVE A    

01:31:29.266 --> 01:31:35.571
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT I THINK LOOKING LONG     
TERM IN THE CITY DOES HAVE A    
GOAL OF REDUCING ITS            

01:31:50.054 --> 01:31:52.488
                     CARBON .   
THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO HAVE   
THE CENTER OF THE CITY BECOME   

01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:53.089
THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO HAVE   
THE CENTER OF THE CITY BECOME   
EVEN DENSER THAN IT IS.         

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:54.022
THE CENTER OF THE CITY BECOME   
EVEN DENSER THAN IT IS.         
AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO    

01:31:54.024 --> 01:31:54.757
EVEN DENSER THAN IT IS.         
AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO    
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PARKING    

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:55.424
AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO    
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PARKING    
AVAILABLE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S NOT      

01:31:55.426 --> 01:31:56.025
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PARKING    
AVAILABLE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S NOT      
AVAILABLE PARKING SPOTS FOR.    

01:31:56.027 --> 01:31:56.825
AVAILABLE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S NOT      
AVAILABLE PARKING SPOTS FOR.    
NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE    

01:31:56.827 --> 01:31:57.560
AVAILABLE PARKING SPOTS FOR.    
NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE    
ABLE TO HAVE A CAR IF WE&amp;apos;RE     

01:31:57.562 --> 01:31:58.293
NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE    
ABLE TO HAVE A CAR IF WE&amp;apos;RE     
GOING TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE. 

01:31:58.295 --> 01:31:58.994
ABLE TO HAVE A CAR IF WE&amp;apos;RE     
GOING TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE. 
SO I THINK LOOKING FORWARD THIS 

01:31:58.996 --> 01:32:01.597
GOING TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE. 
SO I THINK LOOKING FORWARD THIS 
DOES TOTALLY FIT IN AND THE ONE 

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:02.265

CONSIDERATION WHEN WE&amp;apos;RE DOING  
THE ALTERATION TO A
