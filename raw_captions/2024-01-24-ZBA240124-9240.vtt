THAT SIZE IS PRETTY MUCH TO BE  
PUT LIGHTING ELEMENTS IN IT TO  

00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:07.926
THAT SIZE IS PRETTY MUCH TO BE  
PUT LIGHTING ELEMENTS IN IT TO  
KEEP THEM DEMRE IT&apos;S THE DEPTH  

00:50:07.928 --> 00:50:11.396
PUT LIGHTING ELEMENTS IN IT TO

00:50:12.399 --> 00:50:14.533
OF IT&apos;S WHAT REALLY MATTERS SO  
IT&apos;S NOT REALLY THE SIZE OF IT. 
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD YOU START AGAIN     

00:50:14.535 --> 00:50:15.467
IT&apos;S NOT REALLY THE SIZE OF IT. 
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD YOU START AGAIN     
WITH THE LIGHTING IS GOING TO   

00:50:15.469 --> 00:50:18.870
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD YOU START AGAIN     
WITH THE LIGHTING IS GOING TO   
BE ON THESE LEIDY&apos;S BUT IT HAS  

00:50:18.872 --> 00:50:22.574
WITH THE LIGHTING IS GOING TO   
BE ON THESE LEIDY&apos;S BUT IT HAS  
A THE SIGNS LOOK BLACK BECAUSE  

00:50:22.576 --> 00:50:23.509
BE ON THESE LEIDY&apos;S BUT IT HAS  
A THE SIGNS LOOK BLACK BECAUSE  
THERE&apos;S A MESH ON THE FRONT     

00:50:23.511 --> 00:50:24.376
A THE SIGNS LOOK BLACK BECAUSE  
THERE&apos;S A MESH ON THE FRONT     
OF THEM SO AT NIGHT ONLY A      

00:50:24.378 --> 00:50:26.178
THERE&apos;S A MESH ON THE FRONT     
OF THEM SO AT NIGHT ONLY A      
PERCENTAGE OF THE LIGHT IS      

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.615
OF THEM SO AT NIGHT ONLY A      
PERCENTAGE OF THE LIGHT IS      
COMING THROUGH.                 

00:50:29.617 --> 00:50:30.615
PERCENTAGE OF THE LIGHT IS      
COMING THROUGH.                 
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T HAVE ANY MORE        

00:50:30.617 --> 00:50:33.885
COMING THROUGH.                 
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T HAVE ANY MORE        
QUESTIONS DENHA SO THE ACTING   

00:50:33.887 --> 00:50:37.189
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T HAVE ANY MORE        
QUESTIONS DENHA SO THE ACTING   
CHAIR RAISED SOME ISSUES ABOUT  

00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:37.889
QUESTIONS DENHA SO THE ACTING   
CHAIR RAISED SOME ISSUES ABOUT  
THE ADDRESSING AND THE          

00:50:37.891 --> 00:50:41.460
CHAIR RAISED SOME ISSUES ABOUT  
THE ADDRESSING AND THE          
APARTMENT NUMBERS.              

00:50:41.462 --> 00:50:42.660
THE ADDRESSING AND THE          
APARTMENT NUMBERS.              
SO THIS BUILDING HAS TWO        

00:50:42.662 --> 00:50:46.131
APARTMENT NUMBERS.              
SO THIS BUILDING HAS TWO        
ENTRANCES IS THAT TWO DIFFERENT 

00:50:46.133 --> 00:50:48.901
SO THIS BUILDING HAS TWO        
ENTRANCES IS THAT TWO DIFFERENT 
STREET ADDRESSES NOT THE        

00:50:48.903 --> 00:50:49.635
ENTRANCES IS THAT TWO DIFFERENT 
STREET ADDRESSES NOT THE        
APARTMENT NUMBERS BUT THE       

00:50:49.637 --> 00:50:53.105
STREET ADDRESSES NOT THE        
APARTMENT NUMBERS BUT THE       
STREET ADDRESSES ON I BELIEVE   

00:50:53.107 --> 00:50:53.706
APARTMENT NUMBERS BUT THE       
STREET ADDRESSES ON I BELIEVE   
HAVE DONE BY ADDRESS AND        

00:50:53.708 --> 00:50:54.239
STREET ADDRESSES ON I BELIEVE   
HAVE DONE BY ADDRESS AND

&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A SINGLE ADDRESS        
BUILDING AND UNIT NUMBERS       

00:50:57.411 --> 00:50:57.876
&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A SINGLE ADDRESS        
BUILDING AND UNIT NUMBERS       
PROBABLY.

00:51:31.879 --> 00:51:35.213
THANK YOU.                      
&gt;&gt; SO AS I&apos;M LOOKING AT THIS    
I&apos;M THINKING THE STREET ADDRESS 

00:51:35.215 --> 00:51:38.817
&gt;&gt; SO AS I&apos;M LOOKING AT THIS    
I&apos;M THINKING THE STREET ADDRESS 
CAN GO AT THE COMMON ENTRY ON   

00:51:38.819 --> 00:51:42.954
I&apos;M THINKING THE STREET ADDRESS 
CAN GO AT THE COMMON ENTRY ON   
BOTH OF THESE AND THAT WOULD BE 

00:51:42.956 --> 00:51:43.655
CAN GO AT THE COMMON ENTRY ON   
BOTH OF THESE AND THAT WOULD BE 
A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE FROM   

00:51:43.657 --> 00:51:45.723
BOTH OF THESE AND THAT WOULD BE 
A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE FROM   
THOSE OTHER FIRST FLOOR         

00:51:45.725 --> 00:51:46.124
A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE FROM   
THOSE OTHER FIRST FLOOR         
APARTMENTS.                     

00:51:46.126 --> 00:51:46.791
THOSE OTHER FIRST FLOOR         
APARTMENTS.                     
ADDITIONALLY, THOSE AWNINGS     

00:51:46.793 --> 00:51:49.894
APARTMENTS.                     
ADDITIONALLY, THOSE AWNINGS     
WHICH ARE WIDER THEY&apos;RE ALREADY 

00:51:49.896 --> 00:51:53.498
ADDITIONALLY, THOSE AWNINGS     
WHICH ARE WIDER THEY&apos;RE ALREADY 
VISUALLY DIFFERENT COULD BE     

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.365
WHICH ARE WIDER THEY&apos;RE ALREADY 
VISUALLY DIFFERENT COULD BE     
RAISED A LITTLE BIT.            

00:51:54.367 --> 00:51:55.367
VISUALLY DIFFERENT COULD BE     
RAISED A LITTLE BIT.            
I&apos;M NOT AN ARCHITECT BUT THESE  

00:51:55.369 --> 00:51:58.369
RAISED A LITTLE BIT.            
I&apos;M NOT AN ARCHITECT BUT THESE  
ARE SIMPLE THINGS THAT I COULD  

00:51:58.371 --> 00:52:01.139
I&apos;M NOT AN ARCHITECT BUT THESE  
ARE SIMPLE THINGS THAT I COULD  
THAT I CAN SEE THAT CREATE      

00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:04.943
ARE SIMPLE THINGS THAT I COULD  
THAT I CAN SEE THAT CREATE      
DISTINGUISH WHAT THE COMMON     

00:52:04.945 --> 00:52:05.944
THAT I CAN SEE THAT CREATE      
DISTINGUISH WHAT THE COMMON     
ENTRY IS AS DISTINCT FROM THOSE 

00:52:05.946 --> 00:52:10.182
DISTINGUISH WHAT THE COMMON     
ENTRY IS AS DISTINCT FROM THOSE 
FIRST FLOOR SINGLE APARTMENT    

00:52:10.184 --> 00:52:13.185
ENTRY IS AS DISTINCT FROM THOSE 
FIRST FLOOR SINGLE APARTMENT    
ENTRIES AND THEY COULD BE DOWN  

00:52:13.187 --> 00:52:13.919
FIRST FLOOR SINGLE APARTMENT    
ENTRIES AND THEY COULD BE DOWN  
THERE WHERE THAT WIDER AWNING   

00:52:13.921 --> 00:52:17.589
ENTRIES AND THEY COULD BE DOWN  
THERE WHERE THAT WIDER AWNING   
IS AND THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER    

00:52:17.591 --> 00:52:18.323
THERE WHERE THAT WIDER AWNING   
IS AND THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER    
DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THAT  

00:52:18.325 --> 00:52:21.493
IS AND THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER    
DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THAT  
COMMON ENTRY TO THE TO THE      

00:52:21.495 --> 00:52:22.161
DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THAT  
COMMON ENTRY TO THE TO THE      
NUMBER OF THE MULTIPLE UNITS    

00:52:22.163 --> 00:52:24.863
COMMON ENTRY TO THE TO THE      
NUMBER OF THE MULTIPLE UNITS    
UPSTAIRS.                       

00:52:24.865 --> 00:52:25.764
NUMBER OF THE MULTIPLE UNITS    
UPSTAIRS.                       
SO I&apos;M LOOKING AT EASILY THERE  

00:52:25.766 --> 00:52:29.835
UPSTAIRS.                       
SO I&apos;M LOOKING AT EASILY THERE  
ARE ARCHITECTURAL SOLUTIONS TO  

00:52:29.837 --> 00:52:34.139
SO I&apos;M LOOKING AT EASILY THERE  
ARE ARCHITECTURAL SOLUTIONS TO  
MEET THE NEEDS THAT YOU&apos;VE      

00:52:34.141 --> 00:52:34.807
ARE ARCHITECTURAL SOLUTIONS TO  
MEET THE NEEDS THAT YOU&apos;VE      
ADDRESSED FOR IDENTIFYING THOSE 

00:52:34.809 --> 00:52:37.742
MEET THE NEEDS THAT YOU&apos;VE      
ADDRESSED FOR IDENTIFYING THOSE 
AS THE COMMON ENTRIES.          

00:52:37.744 --> 00:52:38.944
ADDRESSED FOR IDENTIFYING THOSE 
AS THE COMMON ENTRIES.          
SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON   

00:52:38.946 --> 00:52:39.744
AS THE COMMON ENTRIES.          
SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON   
THE RECORD THAT I SEE           

00:52:39.746 --> 00:52:45.651
SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON   
THE RECORD THAT I SEE           
ALTERNATIVE                     

00:52:58.898 --> 00:53:02.000
            WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH  
YOUR GOALS FROM OUR INTENT IN

WHERE THAT WOULD SIT.           

00:53:02.536 --> 00:53:03.468
TERMS OF THAT LOGO SIGN AND     
WHERE THAT WOULD SIT.           
I MEAN THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE  

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:04.202
WHERE THAT WOULD SIT.           
I MEAN THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE  
OF THIS PICTURE THAT YOU&apos;RE     

00:53:04.204 --> 00:53:04.870
I MEAN THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE  
OF THIS PICTURE THAT YOU&apos;RE     
SHARING IF I&apos;M A RESIDENT OR

AND I LOOK AT THIS BUILDING I   
HAVE SIX GABLES NOW TO THE      

00:53:07.875 --> 00:53:08.474
AND I LOOK AT THIS BUILDING I   
HAVE SIX GABLES NOW TO THE      
GABLES ARE A LITTLE MORE        

00:53:08.476 --> 00:53:09.274
HAVE SIX GABLES NOW TO THE
