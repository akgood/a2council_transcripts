00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.473
THAT WE&amp;apos;VE REVISED THE UPPER    
FLOOR CLADDING COLOR AND THAT   
IS IT TO BETTER ALIGN THE       

00:12:11.475 --> 00:12:12.241
FLOOR CLADDING COLOR AND THAT   
IS IT TO BETTER ALIGN THE       
VOLUME ON THE UPPER LEVEL WITH  

00:12:12.243 --> 00:12:12.941
IS IT TO BETTER ALIGN THE       
VOLUME ON THE UPPER LEVEL WITH  
THE BRICK TONES OF THE          

00:12:12.943 --> 00:12:15.778
VOLUME ON THE UPPER LEVEL WITH  
THE BRICK TONES OF THE          
SURROUNDING BUILDINGS AND THEN  

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.546
THE BRICK TONES OF THE          
SURROUNDING BUILDINGS AND THEN  
MAYBE JUMP ONE PICTURE AHEAD.   

00:12:16.548 --> 00:12:23.452
SURROUNDING BUILDINGS AND THEN  
MAYBE JUMP ONE PICTURE AHEAD.   
I THINK MAYBE TO WE CAN SEE     

00:12:23.454 --> 00:12:24.086
MAYBE JUMP ONE PICTURE AHEAD.   
I THINK MAYBE TO WE CAN SEE     
THERE&amp;apos;S A THERE&amp;apos;S A BLACK       

00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:26.655
I THINK MAYBE TO WE CAN SEE     
THERE&amp;apos;S A THERE&amp;apos;S A BLACK       
REVEAL AND THIS WAS OUTLINED WE 

00:12:26.657 --> 00:12:27.423
THERE&amp;apos;S A THERE&amp;apos;S A BLACK       
REVEAL AND THIS WAS OUTLINED WE 
HAVE THIS REVEAL LAST TIME BUT  

00:12:27.425 --> 00:12:30.459
REVEAL AND THIS WAS OUTLINED WE 
HAVE THIS REVEAL LAST TIME BUT  
WE DID NOT HIGHLIGHT IT&amp;apos;S A     

00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:30.926
HAVE THIS REVEAL LAST TIME BUT  
WE DID NOT HIGHLIGHT IT&amp;apos;S A     
DIFFERENT COLOR.                

00:12:30.928 --> 00:12:31.927
WE DID NOT HIGHLIGHT IT&amp;apos;S A     
DIFFERENT COLOR.                
IT WAS THE SAME COLOR IS WHAT   

00:12:31.929 --> 00:12:34.263
DIFFERENT COLOR.                
IT WAS THE SAME COLOR IS WHAT   
IS NOW THE COPPER STONE PANELS  

00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:34.663
IT WAS THE SAME COLOR IS WHAT   
IS NOW THE COPPER STONE PANELS  
UP ABOVE.                       

00:12:34.665 --> 00:12:35.598
IS NOW THE COPPER STONE PANELS  
UP ABOVE.                       
SO THERE IS A MORE              

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.500
UP ABOVE.                       
SO THERE IS A MORE              
DISTINGUISHED REVEAL BETWEEN    

00:12:38.502 --> 00:12:39.469
SO THERE IS A MORE              
DISTINGUISHED REVEAL BETWEEN    
WHAT IS THE HISTORIC ONE STOREY 

00:12:39.471 --> 00:12:42.571

BLACK LINE.                     
I&amp;apos;M RENDERINGS.                 
WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT ON A

BUILDING?                       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE GOAL THERE WHAT WE    
THINK WE CAN DO IS HAVE THE     

00:18:15.906 --> 00:18:16.539
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE GOAL THERE WHAT WE    
THINK WE CAN DO IS HAVE THE     
STEEL CHANNEL INSERTED THAT     

00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:19.842
THINK WE CAN DO IS HAVE THE     
STEEL CHANNEL INSERTED THAT     
WILL PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR   

00:18:19.844 --> 00:18:20.442
STEEL CHANNEL INSERTED THAT     
WILL PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR   
THE WALL UP ABOVE.              

00:18:20.444 --> 00:18:23.078
WILL PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR   
THE WALL UP ABOVE.              
SO WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO OVERLAP WHERE 

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.248
THE WALL UP ABOVE.              
SO WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO OVERLAP WHERE 
THE BACKUP STRUCTURE IS AND     

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.116
SO WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO OVERLAP WHERE 
THE BACKUP STRUCTURE IS AND     
WHERE THE OUTSIDE FACE OF THE   

00:18:27.118 --> 00:18:30.285
THE BACKUP STRUCTURE IS AND     
WHERE THE OUTSIDE FACE OF THE   
BUILDING IS SO WE CAN CREATE A  

00:18:30.287 --> 00:18:30.752
WHERE THE OUTSIDE FACE OF THE   
BUILDING IS SO WE CAN CREATE A  
SHADOW REVEAL.                  

00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:33.989
BUILDING IS SO WE CAN CREATE A  
SHADOW REVEAL.                  
PREVIOUSLY WE HAD RELIED ON     

00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:34.623
SHADOW REVEAL.                  
PREVIOUSLY WE HAD RELIED ON     
SHADOW TO DO THAT.              

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:35.557
PREVIOUSLY WE HAD RELIED ON     
SHADOW TO DO THAT.              
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT WAS CONVEYED  

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:39.027
SHADOW TO DO THAT.              
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT WAS CONVEYED  
WELL SO HERE IT LITERALLY IS A  

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:41.830
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT WAS CONVEYED  
WELL SO HERE IT LITERALLY IS A  
BLACK LINE I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S PAGE  

00:18:41.832 --> 00:18:43.131
WELL SO HERE IT LITERALLY IS A  
BLACK LINE I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S PAGE  
TWENTY THREE THAT HAS A BLOW UP 

00:18:43.133 --> 00:18:50.573
BLACK LINE I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S PAGE  
TWENTY THREE THAT HAS A BLOW UP 
DETAIL IF YOU ZOOM WE&amp;apos;RE AT THE 

00:18:50.575 --> 00:18:53.442
TWENTY THREE THAT HAS A BLOW UP

00:19:00.951 --> 00:19:01.950
YES RIGHT THERE WE&amp;apos;RE SAYS FOUR 
AND THREE AND NINE AND A HALF   
OVER TO THE LEFT WHERE THE      

00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:05.120
AND THREE AND NINE AND A HALF

A BLOW UP SECTION UP IN THE     
LOWER LEFT CORNER RIGHT THERE   

00:19:08.725 --> 00:19:09.725
A BLOW UP SECTION UP IN THE     
LOWER LEFT CORNER RIGHT THERE   
OK YEAH SO YOU SEE THE LITTLE   

00:19:09.727 --> 00:19:13.195
LOWER LEFT CORNER RIGHT THERE   
OK YEAH SO YOU SEE THE LITTLE   
PROFILE, YOU SEE THE EXISTING   

00:19:13.197 --> 00:19:13.863
OK YEAH SO YOU SEE THE LITTLE   
PROFILE, YOU SEE THE EXISTING   
TOP PARAPET AND ON THE PROFILE  

00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:16.431
PROFILE, YOU SEE THE EXISTING   
TOP PARAPET AND ON THE PROFILE  
THEY&amp;apos;LL BE A STEEL CHANNEL      

00:19:16.433 --> 00:19:17.199
TOP PARAPET AND ON THE PROFILE  
THEY&amp;apos;LL BE A STEEL CHANNEL      
INSERTED AND WE STILL HAVE TO   

00:19:17.201 --> 00:19:20.369
THEY&amp;apos;LL BE A STEEL CHANNEL      
INSERTED AND WE STILL HAVE TO   
REFINE YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW     

00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:20.836
INSERTED AND WE STILL HAVE TO   
REFINE YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW     
THAT SITS.                      

00:19:20.838 --> 00:19:21.770
REFINE YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW     
THAT SITS.                      
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE IT     

00:19:21.772 --> 00:19:22.237
THAT SITS.                      
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE IT     
BACK FURTHER.                   

00:19:22.239 --> 00:19:24.272
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE IT     
BACK FURTHER.
