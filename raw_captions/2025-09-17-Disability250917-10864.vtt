00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:03.200
HAVE A NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION,  
IT DOES IMPAIR THE WAY THAT     
YOUR BODY IMPACTS OR ACTIVATES  

00:41:03.202 --> 00:41:03.468
IT DOES IMPAIR THE WAY THAT     
YOUR BODY IMPACTS OR ACTIVATES  
MUSCLES.                        

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:07.138
YOUR BODY IMPACTS OR ACTIVATES  
MUSCLES.                        
SO EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE ATHLETES  

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:07.939
MUSCLES.                        
SO EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE ATHLETES  
OR MILITARY IT'S IT'S PRETTY    

00:41:07.941 --> 00:41:10.375
SO EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE ATHLETES  
OR MILITARY IT'S IT'S PRETTY    
WELL KNOWN IN MILITARY THEY     

00:41:10.377 --> 00:41:14.011
OR MILITARY IT'S IT'S PRETTY    
WELL KNOWN IN MILITARY THEY     
WILL SLEEP DEPRIVE OUR OUR      

00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:14.511
WELL KNOWN IN MILITARY THEY     
WILL SLEEP DEPRIVE OUR OUR      
MILITARY MEMBERS.               

00:41:14.513 --> 00:41:15.579
WILL SLEEP DEPRIVE OUR OUR      
MILITARY MEMBERS.               
THEY WILL WAKE THEM UP ALL THE  

00:41:15.581 --> 00:41:17.782
MILITARY MEMBERS.               
THEY WILL WAKE THEM UP ALL THE  
TIME.                           

00:41:17.784 --> 00:41:18.716
THEY WILL WAKE THEM UP ALL THE  
TIME.                           
THEY WILL JUST DISTURB THEIR    

00:41:18.718 --> 00:41:19.417
TIME.                           
THEY WILL JUST DISTURB THEIR    
SLEEP AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER ONE 

00:41:19.419 --> 00:41:22.420
THEY WILL JUST DISTURB THEIR    
SLEEP AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER ONE 
NIGHT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN 

00:41:22.422 --> 00:41:23.154
SLEEP AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER ONE 
NIGHT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN 
AS FAR THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO    

00:41:23.156 --> 00:41:23.621
NIGHT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN 
AS FAR THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO    
RUN AS FAST.                    

00:41:23.623 --> 00:41:24.488
AS FAR THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO    
RUN AS FAST.                    
THEY DON'T GENERATE AS MUCH     

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:26.290
RUN AS FAST.                    
THEY DON'T GENERATE AS MUCH     
STRENGTH AND THESE ARE          

00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:27.025
THEY DON'T GENERATE AS MUCH     
STRENGTH AND THESE ARE          
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN PRETTY  

00:41:27.027 --> 00:41:29.393
STRENGTH AND THESE ARE          
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN PRETTY  
GOOD CONDITION IF YOU HAVE      

00:41:29.395 --> 00:41:29.794
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN PRETTY  
GOOD CONDITION IF YOU HAVE      
IMPAIRED SLEEP.                 

00:41:29.796 --> 00:41:30.595
GOOD CONDITION IF YOU HAVE      
IMPAIRED SLEEP.                 
WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT LEADS TO   

00:41:30.597 --> 00:41:31.262
IMPAIRED SLEEP.                 
WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT LEADS TO   
DIFFERENT CHANGES IN YOUR       

00:41:31.264 --> 00:41:33.264
WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT LEADS TO   
DIFFERENT CHANGES IN YOUR       
AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM,       

00:41:33.266 --> 00:41:33.931
DIFFERENT CHANGES IN YOUR       
AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM,       
SPECIFICALLY HOW YOUR BODY      

00:41:33.933 --> 00:41:37.000
AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM,       
SPECIFICALLY HOW YOUR BODY      
CONTROLS BLOOD PRESSURE.        

00:41:37.002 --> 00:41:38.202
SPECIFICALLY HOW YOUR BODY      
CONTROLS BLOOD PRESSURE.        
SO THIS IS THE BIG THE BIG      

00:41:38.204 --> 00:41:41.105
CONTROLS BLOOD PRESSURE.        
SO THIS IS THE BIG THE BIG      
PICTURE.                        

00:41:41.107 --> 00:41:42.173
SO THIS IS THE BIG THE BIG      
PICTURE.                        
SO THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF US     

00:41:42.175 --> 00:41:43.040
PICTURE.                        
SO THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF US     
RESEARCHERS TRY TO TARGET WITH  

00:41:43.042 --> 00:41:44.708
SO THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF US     
RESEARCHERS TRY TO TARGET WITH  
DIFFERENT TYPES                 

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:45.176
RESEARCHERS TRY TO TARGET WITH  
DIFFERENT TYPES                 
OF INTERVENTIONS.               

00:41:45.178 --> 00:41:46.176
DIFFERENT TYPES                 
OF INTERVENTIONS.               
ONE THAT I SPECIFICALLY USE IS  

00:41:46.178 --> 00:41:48.246
OF INTERVENTIONS.               
ONE THAT I SPECIFICALLY USE IS  
CALLED MILD INTERMITTENT        

00:41:48.248 --> 00:41:48.980
ONE THAT I SPECIFICALLY USE IS  
CALLED MILD INTERMITTENT        
HYPOXIA AND I'LL TALK ABOUT IT  

00:41:48.982 --> 00:41:51.949
CALLED MILD INTERMITTENT        
HYPOXIA AND I'LL TALK ABOUT IT  
ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES.   

00:41:51.951 --> 00:41:52.950
HYPOXIA AND I'LL TALK ABOUT IT  
ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES.   
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS   

00:41:52.952 --> 00:41:55.886
ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES.   
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS   
IS IT CIRCUMVENTS MOTOR         

00:41:55.888 --> 00:41:56.487
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS   
IS IT CIRCUMVENTS MOTOR         
IMPAIRMENTS, RIGHT?             

00:41:56.489 --> 00:41:57.421
IS IT CIRCUMVENTS MOTOR         
IMPAIRMENTS, RIGHT?             
SO IT DOES NOT REQUIRE TO       

00:41:57.423 --> 00:42:00.358
IMPAIRMENTS, RIGHT?             
SO IT DOES NOT REQUIRE TO       
SOMEBODY TO COME IN AND WALK ON 

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.292
SO IT DOES NOT REQUIRE TO       
SOMEBODY TO COME IN AND WALK ON 
A TREADMILL OR LIFT ANY WEIGHTS 

00:42:01.294 --> 00:42:04.695
SOMEBODY TO COME IN AND WALK ON 
A TREADMILL OR LIFT ANY WEIGHTS 
THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW     

00:42:04.697 --> 00:42:05.296
A TREADMILL OR LIFT ANY WEIGHTS 
THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW     
THAT THIS AND IT'S JUST         

00:42:05.298 --> 00:42:07.898
THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW     
THAT THIS AND IT'S JUST         
BREATHING AND THEN I DO ALL THE 

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.766
THAT THIS AND IT'S JUST         
BREATHING AND THEN I DO ALL THE 
SO THE INDIVIDUAL COMES IN,     

00:42:08.768 --> 00:42:09.433
BREATHING AND THEN I DO ALL THE 
SO THE INDIVIDUAL COMES IN,     
THEY JUST BREATHE THROUGH A     

00:42:09.435 --> 00:42:09.767
SO THE INDIVIDUAL COMES IN,     
THEY JUST BREATHE THROUGH A     
MASK.                           

00:42:09.769 --> 00:42:11.302
THEY JUST BREATHE THROUGH A     
MASK.                           
I DO ALL THE REST OF THE WORK.  

00:42:11.304 --> 00:42:12.102
MASK.                           
I DO ALL THE REST OF THE WORK.  
THEY JUST LAY THERE.            

00:42:12.104 --> 00:42:12.970
I DO ALL THE REST OF THE WORK.  
THEY JUST LAY THERE.            
THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN  

00:42:12.972 --> 00:42:15.306
THEY JUST LAY THERE.            
THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN  
MOTOR ACTIVATION JUST FROM      

00:42:15.308 --> 00:42:15.773
THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN  
MOTOR ACTIVATION JUST FROM      
BREATHING.                      

00:42:15.775 --> 00:42:16.440
MOTOR ACTIVATION JUST FROM      
BREATHING.                      
THERE ARE CHANGES IN BLOOD      

00:42:16.442 --> 00:42:19.744
BREATHING.                      
THERE ARE CHANGES IN BLOOD      
PRESSURE, THERE ARE CHANGES IN  

00:42:19.746 --> 00:42:22.813
THERE ARE CHANGES IN BLOOD      
PRESSURE, THERE ARE CHANGES IN  
SLEEP AND THERE ARE CHANGES     

00:42:22.815 --> 00:42:23.614
PRESSURE, THERE ARE CHANGES IN  
SLEEP AND THERE ARE CHANGES     
MECHANISTICALLY FOR THE SCIENCE 

00:42:23.616 --> 00:42:24.282
SLEEP AND THERE ARE CHANGES     
MECHANISTICALLY FOR THE SCIENCE 
SIDE TO THOSE MITOCHONDRIA.     

00:42:24.284 --> 00:42:27.018
MECHANISTICALLY FOR THE SCIENCE 
SIDE TO THOSE MITOCHONDRIA.     
SO THIS IS WHAT I STUDY WHAT I  

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.220
SIDE TO THOSE MITOCHONDRIA.     
SO THIS IS WHAT I STUDY WHAT I  
PREVIOUSLY DID I WAS EVEN       

00:42:30.222 --> 00:42:31.055
SO THIS IS WHAT I STUDY WHAT I  
PREVIOUSLY DID I WAS EVEN       
THOUGH I'M I'M THIRTY SEVEN NOW 

00:42:31.057 --> 00:42:34.758
PREVIOUSLY DID I WAS EVEN       
THOUGH I'M I'M THIRTY SEVEN NOW 
IT FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO I  

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.459
THOUGH I'M I'M THIRTY SEVEN NOW 
IT FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO I  
DID STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING   

00:42:35.461 --> 00:42:36.127
IT FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO I  
DID STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING   
AND I TRAINED ATHLETES.         

00:42:36.129 --> 00:42:37.961
DID STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING   
AND I TRAINED ATHLETES.         
I THEN TOOK THAT INTO THE       

00:42:37.963 --> 00:42:38.662
AND I TRAINED ATHLETES.         
I THEN TOOK THAT INTO THE       
SPINAL CORD INJURY WORLD AND I  

00:42:38.664 --> 00:42:41.099
I THEN TOOK THAT INTO THE       
SPINAL CORD INJURY WORLD AND I  
WORKED ON LOCOMOTOR TRAINING    

00:42:41.101 --> 00:42:41.966
SPINAL CORD INJURY WORLD AND I  
WORKED ON LOCOMOTOR TRAINING    
FOR THOSE WITH SPINAL CORD      

00:42:41.968 --> 00:42:42.700
WORKED ON LOCOMOTOR TRAINING    
FOR THOSE WITH SPINAL CORD      
INJURY AND I DID THAT AS A      

00:42:42.702 --> 00:42:43.167
FOR THOSE WITH SPINAL CORD      
INJURY AND I DID THAT AS A      
DISSERTATION.                   

00:42:43.169 --> 00:42:45.402
INJURY AND I DID THAT AS A      
DISSERTATION.                   
SO THAT'S WHAT I ORIGINALLY DID 

00:42:45.404 --> 00:42:46.470
DISSERTATION.                   
SO THAT'S WHAT I ORIGINALLY DID 
AND I GRADUATED WITH MY PHD IN  

00:42:46.472 --> 00:42:49.673
SO THAT'S WHAT I ORIGINALLY DID 
AND I GRADUATED WITH MY PHD IN  
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO I'VE DONE   

00:42:49.675 --> 00:42:53.377
AND I GRADUATED WITH MY PHD IN  
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO I'VE DONE   
THE THE TARGET MOTOR FUNCTION   

00:42:53.379 --> 00:42:54.144
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO I'VE DONE   
THE THE TARGET MOTOR FUNCTION   
TRY TO GET INDIVIDUALS TO WALK  

00:42:54.146 --> 00:42:57.481
THE THE TARGET MOTOR FUNCTION   
TRY TO GET INDIVIDUALS TO WALK  
BUT THAT'S LIMITED FOR A SPINAL 

00:42:57.483 --> 00:42:58.215
TRY TO GET INDIVIDUALS TO WALK  
BUT THAT'S LIMITED FOR A SPINAL 
CORD INJURY GROUP TO THOSE THAT 

00:42:58.217 --> 00:42:58.549
BUT THAT'S LIMITED FOR A SPINAL 
CORD INJURY GROUP TO THOSE THAT 
CAN WALK.                       

00:42:58.551 --> 00:43:01.786
CORD INJURY GROUP TO THOSE THAT 
CAN WALK.                       
OK SO THE INTERVENTION THE TOP  

00:43:01.788 --> 00:43:04.955
CAN WALK.                       
OK SO THE INTERVENTION THE TOP  
RIGHT SCREEN IS ALL LIKE THE    

00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:05.656
OK SO THE INTERVENTION THE TOP  
RIGHT SCREEN IS ALL LIKE THE    
SCIENTIFIC STUFF THAT WE WOULD  

00:43:05.658 --> 00:43:08.292
RIGHT SCREEN IS ALL LIKE THE    
SCIENTIFIC STUFF THAT WE WOULD  
PUT IN A STUDY YOU SEE THIS     

00:43:08.294 --> 00:43:09.360
SCIENTIFIC STUFF THAT WE WOULD  
PUT IN A STUDY YOU SEE THIS     
THING CALLED B ONE AND B TWO.   

00:43:09.362 --> 00:43:12.230
PUT IN A STUDY YOU SEE THIS     
THING CALLED B ONE AND B TWO.   
SO THEY COME IN WE PUT THIS     

00:43:12.232 --> 00:43:13.297
THING CALLED B ONE AND B TWO.   
SO THEY COME IN WE PUT THIS     
MASK ON AND I HAVE A PICTURE    

00:43:13.299 --> 00:43:14.097
SO THEY COME IN WE PUT THIS     
MASK ON AND I HAVE A PICTURE    
OF THE MASK IN THE NEXT SLIDE   

00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:16.133
MASK ON AND I HAVE A PICTURE    
OF THE MASK IN THE NEXT SLIDE   
AND THEY JUST BREATHE AND       

00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:16.834
OF THE MASK IN THE NEXT SLIDE   
AND THEY JUST BREATHE AND       
THEY'RE CONNECTED TO THIS       

00:43:16.836 --> 00:43:17.368
AND THEY JUST BREATHE AND       
THEY'RE CONNECTED TO THIS       
BREATHING CIRCUIT.              

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:20.137
THEY'RE CONNECTED TO THIS       
BREATHING CIRCUIT.              
AND WHAT I DO IS I FILL A BAG   

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:21.072
BREATHING CIRCUIT.              
AND WHAT I DO IS I FILL A BAG   
AND I FILL THIS BAG WITH EIGHT  

00:43:21.074 --> 00:43:21.539
AND WHAT I DO IS I FILL A BAG   
AND I FILL THIS BAG WITH EIGHT  
PERCENT OXYGEN.                 

00:43:21.541 --> 00:43:24.107
AND I FILL THIS BAG WITH EIGHT  
PERCENT OXYGEN.                 
SO RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY'S        

00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.742
PERCENT OXYGEN.                 
SO RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY'S        
BREATHING ROUGHLY TWENTY ONE    

00:43:24.744 --> 00:43:27.344
SO RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY'S        
BREATHING ROUGHLY TWENTY ONE    
PERCENT OXYGEN EVERY TIME I     

00:43:27.346 --> 00:43:27.878
BREATHING ROUGHLY TWENTY ONE    
PERCENT OXYGEN EVERY TIME I     
LOWER THAT OXYGEN.              

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.982
PERCENT OXYGEN EVERY TIME I     
LOWER THAT OXYGEN.              
>> SO YOU TAKE THE SAME SIZED   

00:43:30.984 --> 00:43:32.116
LOWER THAT OXYGEN.              
>> SO YOU TAKE THE SAME SIZED   
BREATH BUT YOU GET LESS OXYGEN. 

00:43:32.118 --> 00:43:32.316
>> SO YOU TAKE THE SAME SIZED   
BREATH BUT YOU GET LESS OXYGEN. 
RIGHT.                          

00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:33.384
BREATH BUT YOU GET LESS OXYGEN. 
RIGHT.                          
SO IT'S NOT I'M NOT RESTRICTING 

00:43:33.386 --> 00:43:35.853
RIGHT.                          
SO IT'S NOT I'M NOT RESTRICTING 
YOUR ACTUAL BREATHING AND WE DO 

00:43:35.855 --> 00:43:39.256
SO IT'S NOT I'M NOT RESTRICTING 
YOUR ACTUAL BREATHING AND WE DO 
THAT TWO MINUTES AT A TIME AND  

00:43:39.258 --> 00:43:40.224
YOUR ACTUAL BREATHING AND WE DO 
THAT TWO MINUTES AT A TIME AND  
THEN WE TAKE TWO MINUTES OFF    

00:43:40.226 --> 00:43:40.892
THAT TWO MINUTES AT A TIME AND  
THEN WE TAKE TWO MINUTES OFF    
TWO MINUTES AT A TIME TWO       

00:43:40.894 --> 00:43:41.626
THEN WE TAKE TWO MINUTES OFF    
TWO MINUTES AT A TIME TWO       
MINUTES OFF AND WE DO THAT      

00:43:41.628 --> 00:43:42.493
TWO MINUTES AT A TIME TWO       
MINUTES OFF AND WE DO THAT      
TWELVE TIMES.                   

00:43:42.495 --> 00:43:43.828
MINUTES OFF AND WE DO THAT      
TWELVE TIMES.                   
SO I LIKE TO RELATE THIS TO     

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:47.298
TWELVE TIMES.                   
SO I LIKE TO RELATE THIS TO     
EXERCISE.                       

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.299
SO I LIKE TO RELATE THIS TO     
EXERCISE.                       
SO IT'S LIKE TWO ABOUT TWO      

00:43:48.301 --> 00:43:49.166
EXERCISE.                       
SO IT'S LIKE TWO ABOUT TWO      
MINUTES OF EXERCISE AND THEN    

00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:50.668
SO IT'S LIKE TWO ABOUT TWO      
MINUTES OF EXERCISE AND THEN    
YOU TAKE A BREAK THEN TWO       

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:51.402
MINUTES OF EXERCISE AND THEN    
YOU TAKE A BREAK THEN TWO       
MINUTES OF EXERCISE AND YOU     

00:43:51.404 --> 00:43:51.869
YOU TAKE A BREAK THEN TWO       
MINUTES OF EXERCISE AND YOU     
TAKE A BREAK.                   

00:43:51.871 --> 00:43:55.072
MINUTES OF EXERCISE AND YOU     
TAKE A BREAK.                   
OK, SO WHAT THE STUDY IS IT'S   

00:43:55.074 --> 00:43:55.739
TAKE A BREAK.                   
OK, SO WHAT THE STUDY IS IT'S   
CALLED A PARALLEL GROUP         

00:43:55.741 --> 00:43:58.676
OK, SO WHAT THE STUDY IS IT'S   
CALLED A PARALLEL GROUP         
DESIGNED SO WE BRING PEOPLE IN, 

00:43:58.678 --> 00:43:59.376
CALLED A PARALLEL GROUP         
DESIGNED SO WE BRING PEOPLE IN, 
WE DO SOME SCREENING AND        

00:43:59.378 --> 00:44:00.177
DESIGNED SO WE BRING PEOPLE IN, 
WE DO SOME SCREENING AND        
CONSENTING TO MAKE SURE THAT    

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:02.914
WE DO SOME SCREENING AND        
CONSENTING TO MAKE SURE THAT    
THEY QUALIFY FOR THE STUDY AND  

00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:03.914
CONSENTING TO MAKE SURE THAT    
THEY QUALIFY FOR THE STUDY AND  
THEN WE DO A SLEEP TEST SO WE   

00:44:03.916 --> 00:44:06.050
THEY QUALIFY FOR THE STUDY AND  
THEN WE DO A SLEEP TEST SO WE   
FIGURE OUT HOW WELL YOU SLEEP   

00:44:06.052 --> 00:44:07.050
THEN WE DO A SLEEP TEST SO WE   
FIGURE OUT HOW WELL YOU SLEEP   
IF YOU HAVE SLEEP APNEA, IF YOU 

00:44:07.052 --> 00:44:10.087
FIGURE OUT HOW WELL YOU SLEEP   
IF YOU HAVE SLEEP APNEA, IF YOU 
DO HAVE SLEEP APNEA, WE WILL    

00:44:10.089 --> 00:44:11.054
IF YOU HAVE SLEEP APNEA, IF YOU 
DO HAVE SLEEP APNEA, WE WILL    
THEN SWITCH YOU OVER TO A C PAP 

00:44:11.056 --> 00:44:13.957
DO HAVE SLEEP APNEA, WE WILL    
THEN SWITCH YOU OVER TO A C PAP 
MACHINE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT  

00:44:13.959 --> 00:44:14.692
THEN SWITCH YOU OVER TO A C PAP 
MACHINE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT  
TO SEE PAP MACHINE IS THIS IS   

00:44:14.694 --> 00:44:15.359
MACHINE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT  
TO SEE PAP MACHINE IS THIS IS   
CALLED CONTINUOUS POSITIVE      

00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:16.760
TO SEE PAP MACHINE IS THIS IS   
CALLED CONTINUOUS POSITIVE      
AIRWAY PRESSURE.                

00:44:16.762 --> 00:44:17.728
CALLED CONTINUOUS POSITIVE      
AIRWAY PRESSURE.                
IT'S THE THING THAT YOU SEE     

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:18.495
AIRWAY PRESSURE.                
IT'S THE THING THAT YOU SEE     
PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR NOSE AND IT 

00:44:18.497 --> 00:44:21.799
IT'S THE THING THAT YOU SEE     
PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR NOSE AND IT 
PUSHES AIR IN WHILE THEY SLEEP. 

00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:23.067
PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR NOSE AND IT 
PUSHES AIR IN WHILE THEY SLEEP. 
SO WE DO THAT AND WE MAKE SOME  

00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:24.735
PUSHES AIR IN WHILE THEY SLEEP. 
SO WE DO THAT AND WE MAKE SOME  
MEASURES OF HOW YOUR UPPER      

00:44:24.737 --> 00:44:25.403
SO WE DO THAT AND WE MAKE SOME  
MEASURES OF HOW YOUR UPPER      
AIRWAY FUNCTIONS DURING SLEEP.  

00:44:25.405 --> 00:44:28.472
MEASURES OF HOW YOUR UPPER      
AIRWAY FUNCTIONS DURING SLEEP.  
SO WE DO ALL OF THAT AND THEN   

00:44:28.474 --> 00:44:29.306
AIRWAY FUNCTIONS DURING SLEEP.  
SO WE DO ALL OF THAT AND THEN   
YOU ARE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER    

00:44:29.308 --> 00:44:32.577
SO WE DO ALL OF THAT AND THEN   
YOU ARE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER    
THE HYPOXIA GROUP OR WHAT WE    

00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:33.310
YOU ARE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER    
THE HYPOXIA GROUP OR WHAT WE    
CALL SHAM WHICH YOU JUST        

00:44:33.312 --> 00:44:34.211
THE HYPOXIA GROUP OR WHAT WE    
CALL SHAM WHICH YOU JUST        
BREATHE NORMAL AIR BUT YOU ARE  

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:37.114
CALL SHAM WHICH YOU JUST        
BREATHE NORMAL AIR BUT YOU ARE  
GIVEN CPR IF YOU HAVE SLEEP     

00:44:37.116 --> 00:44:40.550
BREATHE NORMAL AIR BUT YOU ARE  
GIVEN CPR IF YOU HAVE SLEEP     
APNEA AND WE DO THIS THIS EVERY 

00:44:40.552 --> 00:44:41.084
GIVEN CPR IF YOU HAVE SLEEP     
APNEA AND WE DO THIS THIS EVERY 
DAY FOR EIGHT DAYS.             

00:44:41.086 --> 00:44:42.219
APNEA AND WE DO THIS THIS EVERY 
DAY FOR EIGHT DAYS.             
SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS LIKE    

00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:44.688
DAY FOR EIGHT DAYS.             
SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS LIKE    
MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY THE FIRST 

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.422

00:44:46.092 --> 00:44:48.226
WEEK AND THEN MONDAY THROUGH    
WEDNESDAY THE SECOND WEEK.      
BUT WE DO MAKE ALTERATIONS      

00:44:48.228 --> 00:44:49.060
WEDNESDAY THE SECOND WEEK.      
BUT WE DO MAKE ALTERATIONS      
BASED ON INDIVIDUALS SCHEDULES  

00:44:49.062 --> 00:44:53.331
BUT WE DO MAKE ALTERATIONS      
BASED ON INDIVIDUALS SCHEDULES  
AND THEN WE DO ALL OF THE SAME  

00:44:53.333 --> 00:44:53.931
BASED ON INDIVIDUALS SCHEDULES  
AND THEN WE DO ALL OF THE SAME  
TESTING AT THE END.             

00:44:53.933 --> 00:44:54.732
AND THEN WE DO ALL OF THE SAME  
TESTING AT THE END.             
>> LIKE MOST INTERVENTION

YOU CAN'T SEE THAT ON THIS      
PARTICULAR SCREEN IF YOU LOOK   
AT HER HAND WHEN SHE'S GIVING   

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.727
PARTICULAR SCREEN IF YOU LOOK   
AT HER HAND WHEN SHE'S GIVING   
THE PEACE SIGN THAT THOSE TWO   

00:47:03.729 --> 00:47:04.395
AT HER HAND WHEN SHE'S GIVING   
THE PEACE SIGN THAT THOSE TWO   
PLASTIC CIRCLES AROUND HER      

00:47:04.397 --> 00:47:07.531
THE PEACE SIGN THAT THOSE TWO   
PLASTIC CIRCLES AROUND HER      
FINGER THOSE ARE ACTUALLY       

00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:08.331
PLASTIC CIRCLES AROUND HER      
FINGER THOSE ARE ACTUALLY       
MEASURING BEAT TO BEAT BLOOD    

00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:08.698
FINGER THOSE ARE ACTUALLY       
MEASURING BEAT TO BEAT BLOOD    
PRESSURE.                       

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.368
MEASURING BEAT TO BEAT BLOOD    
PRESSURE.                       
SO EVERY TIME YOUR HEART BEATS  

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:11.902
PRESSURE.                       
SO EVERY TIME YOUR HEART BEATS  
IT'S MEASURING HOW MUCH         

00:47:11.904 --> 00:47:12.636
SO EVERY TIME YOUR HEART BEATS  
IT'S MEASURING HOW MUCH         
PRESSURE IS GENERATED IN THE

PRESSURE IS GENERATED IN THE    
FINGERS.                        
SO THAT ALLOWS US TO GET BEAT   

00:47:16.241 --> 00:47:16.907
FINGERS.                        
SO THAT ALLOWS US TO GET BEAT   
TO BEAT BLOOD PRESSURE RATHER   

00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:19.609
SO THAT ALLOWS US TO GET BEAT   
TO BEAT BLOOD PRESSURE RATHER   
THAN JUST TAKING ONE ON YOUR    

00:47:19.611 --> 00:47:20.344
TO BEAT BLOOD PRESSURE RATHER   
THAN JUST TAKING ONE ON YOUR    
ARM LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO THE     

00:47:20.346 --> 00:47:23.347

00:49:01.346 --> 00:49:04.014
SPINAL CORD INJURY.             
THE BIG ISSUE WITH SPINAL CORD  
INJURY IS THERE'S NO NO         

00:49:04.016 --> 00:49:04.648
THE BIG ISSUE WITH SPINAL CORD  
INJURY IS THERE'S NO NO         
MEDICATION FOR THESE BLOOD

INJURY IS THERE'S NO NO         
MEDICATION FOR THESE BLOOD      
PRESSURE WAVEFORMS WHEN YOU     

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.352
MEDICATION FOR THESE BLOOD      
PRESSURE WAVEFORMS WHEN YOU     
TREAT THE DROPS AND THE BLOOD   

00:49:08.354 --> 00:49:09.086
PRESSURE WAVEFORMS WHEN YOU     
TREAT THE DROPS AND THE BLOOD   
PRESSURE YOU MAKE THE SPIKES    

00:49:09.088 --> 00:49:11.288
TREAT THE DROPS AND THE BLOOD   
PRESSURE YOU MAKE THE SPIKES    
WORSE WHEN YOU TREAT THE SPIKES 

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.156
PRESSURE YOU MAKE THE SPIKES    
WORSE WHEN YOU TREAT THE SPIKES 
YOU MAKE THE DROPS WORSE.       

00:49:12.158 --> 00:49:18.796
WORSE WHEN YOU TREAT THE SPIKES 
YOU MAKE THE DROPS WORSE.       
SO THERE'S REALLY NOTHING       

00:49:32.777 --> 00:49:34.712
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WELL       
STUDIED.

SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A I CAN     
SKIP THROUGH THE REST JUST TO   
GIVE YOU A PICTURE SO THE GREEN 

00:49:36.215 --> 00:49:37.014
SKIP THROUGH THE REST JUST TO   
GIVE YOU A PICTURE SO THE GREEN 
AND RED ARROWS HERE THAT ARE ON

GIVE YOU A PICTURE SO THE GREEN 
AND RED ARROWS HERE THAT ARE ON 
THE TOP CORNER ARE THE          

00:49:37.683 --> 00:49:38.282
AND RED ARROWS HERE THAT ARE ON 
THE TOP CORNER ARE THE          
DIRECTIONS THAT WE WANT THE     

00:49:38.284 --> 00:49:39.083
THE TOP CORNER ARE THE          
DIRECTIONS THAT WE WANT THE     
RESULTS TO GO ON THE LEFT HAND  

00:49:39.085 --> 00:49:39.883
DIRECTIONS THAT WE WANT THE     
RESULTS TO GO ON THE LEFT HAND  
SIDE YOU CAN SEE IN OUR HYPOXIA 

00:49:39.885 --> 00:49:40.550
RESULTS TO GO ON THE LEFT HAND  
SIDE YOU CAN SEE IN OUR HYPOXIA 
GROUP WE HAVE A FORTY TWO       

00:49:40.552 --> 00:49:41.285
SIDE YOU CAN SEE IN OUR HYPOXIA 
GROUP WE HAVE A FORTY TWO       
PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE SPIKES 

00:49:41.287 --> 00:49:42.018
GROUP WE HAVE A FORTY TWO       
PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE SPIKES 
IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOU CAN   

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:42.686
PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE SPIKES 
IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOU CAN   
SEE THAT IN SYSTOLIC AND        

00:49:42.688 --> 00:49:43.420
IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOU CAN   
SEE THAT IN SYSTOLIC AND        
DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND    

00:49:43.422 --> 00:49:44.087
SEE THAT IN SYSTOLIC AND        
DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND    
THE NEXT ONE SO THESE ARE THE   

00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.688
DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND    
THE NEXT ONE SO THESE ARE THE   
DROPS AND BLOOD PRESSURE.       

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:45.522
THE NEXT ONE SO THESE ARE THE   
DROPS AND BLOOD PRESSURE.       
SO THE MORE NEGATIVE THE WORSE  

00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:45.723
DROPS AND BLOOD PRESSURE.       
SO THE MORE NEGATIVE THE WORSE  
IT IS.                          

00:49:45.725 --> 00:49:46.390
SO THE MORE NEGATIVE THE WORSE  
IT IS.                          
SO YOU CAN SEE OUR GROUP HAD    

00:49:46.392 --> 00:49:47.057
IT IS.                          
SO YOU CAN SEE OUR GROUP HAD    
REALLY LARGE DROPS IN BLOOD     

00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:47.857
SO YOU CAN SEE OUR GROUP HAD    
REALLY LARGE DROPS IN BLOOD     
PRESSURE WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT

REALLY LARGE DROPS IN BLOOD     
PRESSURE WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT  
IMPROVEMENTS IN BLOOD PRESSURE  

00:49:50.929 --> 00:49:51.195
PRESSURE WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT  
IMPROVEMENTS IN BLOOD PRESSURE  
CONTROL.                        

00:49:51.197 --> 00:49:51.929
IMPROVEMENTS IN BLOOD PRESSURE  
CONTROL.                        
SO THESE ARE REALLY, REALLY     

00:49:51.931 --> 00:49:54.532
CONTROL.                        
SO THESE ARE REALLY, REALLY     
GOOD.                           

00:49:54.534 --> 00:49:55.565
SO THESE ARE REALLY, REALLY     
GOOD.                           
THE THE DOCUMENT THAT I HAD     

00:49:55.567 --> 00:49:57.835
GOOD.                           
THE THE DOCUMENT THAT I HAD     
SAID I COULD GIVE SOME SCIENCE  

00:49:57.837 --> 00:49:58.835
THE THE DOCUMENT THAT I HAD     
SAID I COULD GIVE SOME SCIENCE  
TO THIS BUT I DON'T THINK I     

00:49:58.837 --> 00:49:59.503
SAID I COULD GIVE SOME SCIENCE  
TO THIS BUT I DON'T THINK I     
HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THIS.      

00:49:59.505 --> 00:50:02.138
TO THIS BUT I DON'T THINK I     
HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THIS.      
THIS IS OUR BIG COMPLEX WAY FOR 

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.206
HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THIS.      
THIS IS OUR BIG COMPLEX WAY FOR 
ME TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN I MAKE 

00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:06.009
THIS IS OUR BIG COMPLEX WAY FOR 
ME TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN I MAKE 
SOMEBODY SLIGHTLY HYPOXIC EVERY 

00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:10.213
ME TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN I MAKE 
SOMEBODY SLIGHTLY HYPOXIC EVERY 
DAY FOR TWENTY FOUR MINUTES IS  

00:50:10.215 --> 00:50:11.015
SOMEBODY SLIGHTLY HYPOXIC EVERY 
DAY FOR TWENTY FOUR MINUTES IS  
WHAT IT TOTALS OUT TO BE THAT   

00:50:11.017 --> 00:50:14.084
DAY FOR TWENTY FOUR MINUTES IS  
WHAT IT TOTALS OUT TO BE THAT   
THIS CHANGES THE WAY THAT THE   

00:50:14.086 --> 00:50:16.586
WHAT IT TOTALS OUT TO BE THAT   
THIS CHANGES THE WAY THAT THE   
BRAIN ALLOWS THE NEURONS TO     

00:50:16.588 --> 00:50:17.321
THIS CHANGES THE WAY THAT THE   
BRAIN ALLOWS THE NEURONS TO     
COMMUNICATE THAT IMPROVES BLOOD 

00:50:17.323 --> 00:50:20.657
BRAIN ALLOWS THE NEURONS TO     
COMMUNICATE THAT IMPROVES BLOOD 
PRESSURE CONTROL AND MOTOR      

00:50:20.659 --> 00:50:21.391
COMMUNICATE THAT IMPROVES BLOOD 
PRESSURE CONTROL AND MOTOR      
FUNCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH   

00:50:21.393 --> 00:50:22.125
PRESSURE CONTROL AND MOTOR      
FUNCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH   
SPINAL CORD INJURY AND WE THINK 

00:50:22.127 --> 00:50:25.228
FUNCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH   
SPINAL CORD INJURY AND WE THINK 
THIS IS THE SAME FOR THOSE THAT 

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.565
SPINAL CORD INJURY AND WE THINK 
THIS IS THE SAME FOR THOSE THAT 
HAVE PARKINSON'S DISEASE OR     

00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:29.433
THIS IS THE SAME FOR THOSE THAT 
HAVE PARKINSON'S DISEASE OR     
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS OR EVEN JUST 

00:50:29.435 --> 00:50:32.836
HAVE PARKINSON'S DISEASE OR     
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS OR EVEN JUST 
INDIVIDUALS AS THEY THEY AGE.   

00:50:32.838 --> 00:50:34.038
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS OR EVEN JUST 
INDIVIDUALS AS THEY THEY AGE.   
SO RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE   

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.274
INDIVIDUALS AS THEY THEY AGE.   
SO RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE   
HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE  

00:50:37.276 --> 00:50:38.008
SO RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE   
HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE  
THAT IT IMPROVES BLOOD PRESSURE 

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.143
HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE  
THAT IT IMPROVES BLOOD PRESSURE 
CONTROL AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE     

00:50:40.145 --> 00:50:43.947
THAT IT IMPROVES BLOOD PRESSURE 
CONTROL AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE     
LOOKING TO EXPAND OUR NETWORK   

00:50:43.949 --> 00:50:44.748
CONTROL AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE     
LOOKING TO EXPAND OUR NETWORK   
INTO THE DISABILITY NETWORK AND 

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.118
LOOKING TO EXPAND OUR NETWORK   
INTO THE DISABILITY NETWORK AND 
OTHER PATIENT POPULATION SO WE  

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:48.852
INTO THE DISABILITY NETWORK AND 
OTHER PATIENT POPULATION SO WE  
CAN START TO BRING THIS         

00:50:48.854 --> 00:50:51.988
OTHER PATIENT POPULATION SO WE  
CAN START TO BRING THIS         
INTERVENTION TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.789
