00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.832
IT&apos;S GOING TO GO WITH OUR       
DESIGN THAT BACK ENTRY IS       
ALREADY A CONCRETE ENTRY SO     

00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:17.499
DESIGN THAT BACK ENTRY IS       
ALREADY A CONCRETE ENTRY SO     
WE&apos;LL HAVE TO TAKE THAT         

00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:18.200
ALREADY A CONCRETE ENTRY SO     
WE&apos;LL HAVE TO TAKE THAT         
CONCRETE OUT WATERPROOF BECAUSE 

00:16:18.202 --> 00:16:19.001
WE&apos;LL HAVE TO TAKE THAT         
CONCRETE OUT WATERPROOF BECAUSE 
IT DOES SIT ABOVE OUR BASEMENT  

00:16:19.003 --> 00:16:19.601
CONCRETE OUT WATERPROOF BECAUSE 
IT DOES SIT ABOVE OUR BASEMENT  
AND THEN PUT A NEW FRESH        

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:20.336
IT DOES SIT ABOVE OUR BASEMENT  
AND THEN PUT A NEW FRESH

00:16:20.338 --> 00:16:21.003
AND THEN PUT A NEW FRESH        
COAT OF CONCRETE ON THERE.      
THE OTHER THING THE LAST THING  

00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:21.738
COAT OF CONCRETE ON THERE.      
THE OTHER THING THE LAST THING  
I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION 

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.471
THE OTHER THING THE LAST THING  
I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION 
IS THAT WE DID INCLUDE SOME     

00:16:22.473 --> 00:16:23.206
I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION 
IS THAT WE DID INCLUDE SOME     
COLOR SCHEMES JUST TO GIVE YOU  

00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:24.073
IS THAT WE DID INCLUDE SOME     
COLOR SCHEMES JUST TO GIVE YOU  
A BETTER OVER SORT OF OVERALL   

00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:24.273
COLOR SCHEMES JUST TO GIVE YOU  
A BETTER OVER SORT OF OVERALL   
SENSE.                          

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.074
A BETTER OVER SORT OF OVERALL   
SENSE.                          
I REALIZE THAT IT MAY NOT BE    

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:29.178
SENSE.                          
I REALIZE THAT IT MAY NOT BE    
NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR THE 

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.113
I REALIZE THAT IT MAY NOT BE    
NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR THE 
APPROVAL PROCESS BUT I THINK IT 

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:30.779
NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR THE 
APPROVAL PROCESS BUT I THINK IT 
KIND OF TIES EVERYTHING         

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.247
APPROVAL PROCESS BUT I THINK IT 
KIND OF TIES EVERYTHING         
TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT.          

00:16:32.249 --> 00:16:36.251
KIND OF TIES EVERYTHING

00:16:36.253 --> 00:16:37.053
TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT.          
AND THEN THE LAST THING WAS WE  
ARE HOLDING THIS UP SIX INCHES  

00:16:37.055 --> 00:16:40.122
AND THEN THE LAST THING WAS WE  
ARE HOLDING THIS UP SIX INCHES  
DUE TO BASICALLY THE            

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:40.823
ARE HOLDING THIS UP SIX INCHES  
DUE TO BASICALLY THE

00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:41.690
DUE TO BASICALLY THE            
MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDATION.    
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN     

00:16:41.692 --> 00:16:44.359
MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDATION.    
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN     
RAISE IT UP PRESSURE TREATED    

00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:47.063
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN     
RAISE IT UP PRESSURE TREATED    
WOOD PLATFORM AND THEN WHATEVER 

00:16:47.065 --> 00:16:47.930
RAISE IT UP PRESSURE TREATED    
WOOD PLATFORM AND THEN WHATEVER 
THAT TREATMENT THAT IS VISIBLE  

00:16:47.932 --> 00:16:51.134
WOOD PLATFORM AND THEN WHATEVER 
THAT TREATMENT THAT IS VISIBLE  
WE WILL PAINT TO MATCH THE REST 

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:51.734
THAT TREATMENT THAT IS VISIBLE

00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:52.868
WE WILL PAINT TO MATCH THE REST 
OF THE METAL PANELING.          
SO IF IT&apos;S LIKE A CHARCOAL OR   

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.938

YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE&apos;S ONLY   

00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:19.821
OF YARD LEFT HERE.              
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE&apos;S ONLY   
EIGHT FEET IN THE BACK AND      

00:28:19.823 --> 00:28:23.925

EIGHT FEET IN THE BACK AND      
SEVEN FEET IN THE FRONT.        
SO THE PROPOSAL IS TO INFILL    

00:28:27.732 --> 00:28:28.530
SEVEN FEET IN THE FRONT.        
SO THE PROPOSAL IS TO INFILL    
THREE QUARTERS OF THE TWO       

00:28:28.532 --> 00:28:31.232
SO THE PROPOSAL IS TO INFILL    
THREE QUARTERS OF THE TWO       
WINDOWS THAT FACE WEST THAT     

00:28:31.234 --> 00:28:31.933
THREE QUARTERS OF THE TWO       
WINDOWS THAT FACE WEST THAT     
FACE THE NEIGHBOR&apos;S GARAGE AND  

00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:35.636
WINDOWS THAT FACE WEST THAT     
FACE THE NEIGHBOR&apos;S GARAGE AND  
TO REPLACE THE TWO WINDOWS THAT 

00:28:35.638 --> 00:28:38.906
FACE THE NEIGHBOR&apos;S GARAGE AND  
TO REPLACE THE TWO WINDOWS THAT 
THEY S WITH NOT REPLICA WINDOWS 

00:28:38.908 --> 00:28:43.144
TO REPLACE THE TWO WINDOWS THAT 
THEY S WITH NOT REPLICA WINDOWS 
BUT VERY CLOSE COPIES OF THEM.  

00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:43.979
THEY S WITH NOT REPLICA WINDOWS 
BUT VERY CLOSE COPIES OF THEM.  
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO DOUBLE   

00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:47.281
BUT VERY CLOSE COPIES OF THEM.  
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO DOUBLE   
PANE GLASS WHICH IS A BIG       

00:28:47.283 --> 00:28:48.016
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO DOUBLE   
PANE GLASS WHICH IS A BIG       
IMPROVEMENT AND THEY WOULD HAVE 

00:28:48.018 --> 00:28:50.084
PANE GLASS WHICH IS A BIG       
IMPROVEMENT AND THEY WOULD HAVE 
ON WINDOWS IN THE MIDDLE.       

00:28:50.086 --> 00:28:51.086
IMPROVEMENT AND THEY WOULD HAVE 
ON WINDOWS IN THE MIDDLE.       
SO THESE ARE THE TWO THAT FACE  

00:28:51.088 --> 00:28:53.822
ON WINDOWS IN THE MIDDLE.       
SO THESE ARE THE TWO THAT FACE  
THE BACK THAT WOULD BE INFELD   

00:28:53.824 --> 00:28:54.756
SO THESE ARE THE TWO THAT FACE  
THE BACK THAT WOULD BE INFELD   
THE PROPORTIONS OF THE TOP ROW  

00:28:54.758 --> 00:28:58.193
THE BACK THAT WOULD BE INFELD   
THE PROPORTIONS OF THE TOP ROW  
OF WINDOWS WOULD MATCH WHICH IS 

00:28:58.195 --> 00:28:58.960
THE PROPORTIONS OF THE TOP ROW  
OF WINDOWS WOULD MATCH WHICH IS 
APPRECIATED AND THEY JUST BE    

00:28:58.962 --> 00:29:02.163
OF WINDOWS WOULD MATCH WHICH IS 
APPRECIATED AND THEY JUST BE    
FILLED IN BELOW THE PHIL WOULD  

00:29:02.165 --> 00:29:05.767
APPRECIATED AND THEY JUST BE    
FILLED IN BELOW THE PHIL WOULD  
BE SMALL STONES IN WATER THAT   

00:29:05.769 --> 00:29:06.868
FILLED IN BELOW THE PHIL WOULD  
BE SMALL STONES IN WATER THAT   
WOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE    

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.104
BE SMALL STONES IN WATER THAT   
WOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE    
OTHER POST PERIOD               

00:29:10.106 --> 00:29:10.805
WOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE    
OTHER POST PERIOD               
OF SIGNIFICANCE OPENINGS THAT   

00:29:10.807 --> 00:29:13.574
OTHER POST PERIOD               
OF SIGNIFICANCE OPENINGS THAT   
WERE FILLED IN THE STONES THAT  

00:29:13.576 --> 00:29:14.209
OF SIGNIFICANCE OPENINGS THAT   
WERE FILLED IN THE STONES THAT  
THEY WANT TO USE THEY SAID      

00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:15.009
WERE FILLED IN THE STONES THAT  
THEY WANT TO USE THEY SAID      
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER   

00:29:15.011 --> 00:29:17.111
THEY WANT TO USE THEY SAID      
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER   
WHICH IS GOOD.                  

00:29:17.113 --> 00:29:18.079
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER   
WHICH IS GOOD.                  
SO IT&apos;LL BE COMPATIBLE BUT NOT  

00:29:18.081 --> 00:29:21.115
WHICH IS GOOD.                  
SO IT&apos;LL BE COMPATIBLE BUT NOT  
EXACTLY THE SAME.               

00:29:21.117 --> 00:29:21.950
SO IT&apos;LL BE COMPATIBLE BUT NOT

00:29:26.323 --> 00:29:28.656
APPLICANT THAT SHOW HERE&apos;S THE  
YOU CAN SEE HOW CLOSE THIS      
GARAGES IS ONLY SEVEN FEET      

00:29:28.658 --> 00:29:33.061
YOU CAN SEE HOW CLOSE THIS

THIS IS AN EXISTING INFILL      
THESE ARE PICTURE OF THE STONES 

00:29:37.701 --> 00:29:38.400
THIS IS AN EXISTING INFILL      
THESE ARE PICTURE OF THE STONES

THESE ARE PICTURE OF THE STONES 
THAT THEY&apos;D HAVE TO SORT

OF THESE CHIMNEYS THAT WE SEE   

00:56:02.785 --> 00:56:03.483
LITTLE FANCIER THAN THAN MANY   
OF THESE CHIMNEYS THAT WE SEE   
IN WALKING AROUND THE           

00:56:03.485 --> 00:56:05.853
OF THESE CHIMNEYS THAT WE SEE   
IN WALKING AROUND THE
