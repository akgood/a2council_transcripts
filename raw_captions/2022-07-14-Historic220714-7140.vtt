RIGHT YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT THE PINE AND   
THAT ROTTED EXTENSIVELY YOU CAN 
FEEL FLIMSINESS OF THE MATERIAL 

01:12:29.285 --> 01:12:30.351
THAT ROTTED EXTENSIVELY YOU CAN 
FEEL FLIMSINESS OF THE MATERIAL 
WHEN WATER GETS IN THERE IT&amp;apos;S

YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO HAVE HERE IF    
YOU HAVE FOUR PIECES OF PVC     
WRAPPED AROUND IT&amp;apos;S MY          

01:13:24.841 --> 01:13:25.506
YOU HAVE FOUR PIECES OF PVC     
WRAPPED AROUND IT&amp;apos;S MY          
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERMAL      

01:13:25.508 --> 01:13:29.610
WRAPPED AROUND IT&amp;apos;S MY          
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERMAL      
CONTRACTION IN PVC IS QUITE BIG 

01:13:29.612 --> 01:13:33.414
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERMAL      
CONTRACTION IN PVC IS QUITE BIG 
FROM WINTER TO SUMMER.          

01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:36.950
CONTRACTION IN PVC IS QUITE BIG 
FROM WINTER TO SUMMER.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO HOW DO YOU HOW YOU    

01:13:36.952 --> 01:13:37.819
FROM WINTER TO SUMMER.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO HOW DO YOU HOW YOU    
MITIGATE THAT OR ARE WE GOING   

01:13:37.821 --> 01:13:38.719
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO HOW DO YOU HOW YOU    
MITIGATE THAT OR ARE WE GOING   
TO HAVE JUST BIG JOINTS AT THE  

01:13:38.721 --> 01:13:41.823
MITIGATE THAT OR ARE WE GOING   
TO HAVE JUST BIG JOINTS AT THE  
CORNERS OR YOU KNOW, WHAT IS IT 

01:13:41.825 --> 01:13:42.556
TO HAVE JUST BIG JOINTS AT THE  
CORNERS OR YOU KNOW, WHAT IS IT 
GOING TO LOOK LIKE AT THE       

01:13:42.558 --> 01:13:42.957
CORNERS OR YOU KNOW, WHAT IS IT 
GOING TO LOOK LIKE AT THE       
JOINTS?                         

01:13:42.959 --> 01:13:45.560
GOING TO LOOK LIKE AT THE       
JOINTS?                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, SO ACTUALLY THE WOOD THE 

01:13:45.562 --> 01:13:48.963
JOINTS?                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, SO ACTUALLY THE WOOD THE 
PINE WILL HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT 

01:13:48.965 --> 01:13:49.530
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, SO ACTUALLY THE WOOD THE 
PINE WILL HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT 
OF THE EXPANSION AND            

01:13:49.532 --> 01:13:53.167
PINE WILL HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT 
OF THE EXPANSION AND            
CONTRACTION AND WHEN WE CREATE  

01:13:53.169 --> 01:13:53.935
OF THE EXPANSION AND            
CONTRACTION AND WHEN WE CREATE  
WHEN WE CREATE THOSE CORNERS WE 

01:13:53.937 --> 01:13:54.802
CONTRACTION AND WHEN WE CREATE  
WHEN WE CREATE THOSE CORNERS WE 
WILL LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN   

01:13:54.804 --> 01:13:57.404
WHEN WE CREATE THOSE CORNERS WE 
WILL LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN   
EXPANSION GAP WAS SEALED WITH A 

01:13:57.406 --> 01:13:58.072
WILL LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN   
EXPANSION GAP WAS SEALED WITH A 
SPECIAL TALKING AGENT THAT      

01:13:58.074 --> 01:14:00.174
EXPANSION GAP WAS SEALED WITH A 
SPECIAL TALKING AGENT THAT      
EXPANDS CONTRACTS WITH THE      

01:14:00.176 --> 01:14:04.045
SPECIAL TALKING AGENT THAT      
EXPANDS CONTRACTS WITH THE      
DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES.         

01:14:04.047 --> 01:14:05.312
EXPANDS CONTRACTS WITH THE      
DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, SO LIKE THERE WON&amp;apos;T BE   

01:14:05.314 --> 01:14:05.980
DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, SO LIKE THERE WON&amp;apos;T BE   
AN OPEN JOINT, THEY&amp;apos;LL BE       

01:14:05.982 --> 01:14:06.313
