WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 
ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION 

00:28:39.321 --> 00:28:40.253
WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 
ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION 
WHICH WOULD BE THE REWRITE      

00:28:40.255 --> 00:28:43.089

LAST PORTION OF THIS WHICH      

00:28:48.096 --> 00:28:48.629
COULD RUN CONCURRENTLY FOR THE  
LAST PORTION OF THIS WHICH      
WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO           

00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:51.664
LAST PORTION OF THIS WHICH      
WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO

PROCESS IT ALSO POTENTIALLY HAS 
THE ISSUE OF HAVING TWO         

00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:00.073
PROCESS IT ALSO POTENTIALLY HAS 
THE ISSUE OF HAVING TWO         
CONCURRENT PROCESSES GOING AT   

00:29:00.075 --> 00:29:00.673
THE ISSUE OF HAVING TWO         
CONCURRENT PROCESSES GOING AT   
THE SAME TIME THAT ARE          

00:29:00.675 --> 00:29:01.341
CONCURRENT PROCESSES GOING AT

00:29:01.343 --> 00:29:02.875
THE SAME TIME THAT ARE          
DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER.        
SO WE THEN TALKING ABOUT THE    

00:29:02.877 --> 00:29:03.543
DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER.        
SO WE THEN TALKING ABOUT THE    
PROS AND CONS OF THAT THAT      

00:29:03.545 --> 00:29:06.413
SO WE THEN TALKING ABOUT THE

THESE TRUCKS WE CAN ACTUALLY    

01:07:40.994 --> 01:07:43.861
HAS SAID THAT WHEN WE WITH      
THESE TRUCKS WE CAN ACTUALLY    
EXTEND THE LIFE OF A TRUCK      

01:07:43.863 --> 01:07:44.595
THESE TRUCKS WE CAN ACTUALLY    
EXTEND THE LIFE OF A TRUCK      
BECAUSE IT'S NOT EITHER JUST    

01:07:44.597 --> 01:07:47.198
EXTEND THE LIFE OF A TRUCK      
BECAUSE IT'S NOT EITHER JUST    
BEING USED FOR ONE USE AND THEN

01:07:55.775 --> 01:08:00.445
OF WORK ALL THE TIME ALLOWS     
THEM TO EXTEND THE THE LIFE     
OF THE TRUCK THEN FOR HORIZON   

01:08:00.447 --> 01:08:05.416

OF THE TRUCK THEN FOR HORIZON   
SHOES HERE I BELIEVE YOU MAY BE 

01:08:05.418 --> 01:08:08.585
OF THE TRUCK THEN FOR HORIZON   
SHOES HERE I BELIEVE YOU MAY BE 
AWARE OF THIS ONE THE WATER     

01:08:08.587 --> 01:08:12.590
SHOES HERE I BELIEVE YOU MAY BE 
AWARE OF THIS ONE THE WATER     
TREATMENT PLANT ONE IS OF VERY  

01:08:12.592 --> 01:08:12.957
AWARE OF THIS ONE THE WATER     
TREATMENT PLANT ONE IS OF VERY  
OLD.                            

01:08:12.959 --> 01:08:14.191
TREATMENT PLANT ONE IS OF VERY  
OLD.                            
IT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED AND 

01:08:14.193 --> 01:08:15.760
OLD.                            
IT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED AND 
BROUGHT.                        

01:08:15.762 --> 01:08:17.061
IT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED AND 
BROUGHT.                        
WE ARE GETTING WE JUST HAD A    

01:08:17.063 --> 01:08:20.365
BROUGHT.                        
WE ARE GETTING WE JUST HAD A    
NEW CONSULTING WORK WITH THE ON 

01:08:20.367 --> 01:08:21.199
WE ARE GETTING WE JUST HAD A    
NEW CONSULTING WORK WITH THE ON 
THE PILOT PLANT THAT WE HAVE    

01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:24.268
NEW CONSULTING WORK WITH THE ON 
THE PILOT PLANT THAT WE HAVE    
AND IMMEDIATELY WE'RE ALREADY   

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:25.136
THE PILOT PLANT THAT WE HAVE    
AND IMMEDIATELY WE'RE ALREADY   
GETTING GOOD NUMBERS FROM THEM  

01:08:25.138 --> 01:08:29.306
AND IMMEDIATELY WE'RE ALREADY   
GETTING GOOD NUMBERS FROM THEM  
THAT WE WERE NOT GETTING FROM   

01:08:29.308 --> 01:08:29.973
GETTING GOOD NUMBERS FROM THEM  
THAT WE WERE NOT GETTING FROM   
BEFORE SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY      

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.243
THAT WE WERE NOT GETTING FROM   
BEFORE SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY      
ABOUT THAT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S 

01:08:32.245 --> 01:08:33.143
BEFORE SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY      
ABOUT THAT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S 
A GOOD STEP IN THE DIRECTION.   

01:08:33.145 --> 01:08:36.580
ABOUT THAT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S 
A GOOD STEP IN THE DIRECTION.   
HOWEVER, IT'S GOING TO BE A     

01:08:36.582 --> 01:08:39.850
A GOOD STEP IN THE DIRECTION.   
HOWEVER, IT'S GOING TO BE A     
COSTLY REPLACEMENT.             

01:08:39.852 --> 01:08:40.918
HOWEVER, IT'S GOING TO BE A     
COSTLY REPLACEMENT.             
IT IS A WATER TREATMENT PLANT   

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.921
COSTLY REPLACEMENT.             
IT IS A WATER TREATMENT PLANT   
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I    

01:08:43.923 --> 01:08:44.856
IT IS A WATER TREATMENT PLANT   
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I    
KNOW HAS BEEN GOING ON BEFORE I 

01:08:44.858 --> 01:08:48.559
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I    
KNOW HAS BEEN GOING ON BEFORE I 
GOT HERE AND I HOPE TO SEE      

01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:53.063
KNOW HAS BEEN GOING ON BEFORE I 
GOT HERE AND I HOPE TO SEE      
THROUGH TO THE END THE SECOND   

01:08:53.065 --> 01:08:53.964
GOT HERE AND I HOPE TO SEE      
THROUGH TO THE END THE SECOND   
ONE IS GOING TO BE INCREASING   

01:08:53.966 --> 01:08:55.833
THROUGH TO THE END THE SECOND   
ONE IS GOING TO BE INCREASING   
DEMANDS ON INFRASTRUCTURE       

01:08:55.835 --> 01:08:56.267
ONE IS GOING TO BE INCREASING   
DEMANDS ON INFRASTRUCTURE       
SERVICES.                       

01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:57.235
DEMANDS ON INFRASTRUCTURE       
SERVICES.                       
THAT'S KIND OF PART OF THE      

01:08:57.237 --> 01:08:57.935
SERVICES.                       
THAT'S KIND OF PART OF THE      
CIRCLING BACK TO THE PRIORITIES 

01:08:57.937 --> 01:09:00.604
THAT'S KIND OF PART OF THE      
CIRCLING BACK TO THE PRIORITIES 
I BROUGHT WHICH IS AS WE'RE     

01:09:00.606 --> 01:09:01.172
CIRCLING BACK TO THE PRIORITIES 
I BROUGHT WHICH IS AS WE'RE     
DEVELOPING MORE WE'RE HAVING    

01:09:01.174 --> 01:09:04.141
I BROUGHT WHICH IS AS WE'RE     
DEVELOPING MORE WE'RE HAVING    
MORE AND MORE DEMAND ON OUR     

01:09:04.143 --> 01:09:04.575
DEVELOPING MORE WE'RE HAVING    
MORE AND MORE DEMAND ON OUR     
INFRASTRUCTURE.                 

01:09:04.577 --> 01:09:05.343
MORE AND MORE DEMAND ON OUR     
INFRASTRUCTURE.                 
THE PICTURE ON THERE YOU CAN    

01:09:05.345 --> 01:09:11.882
INFRASTRUCTURE.                 
THE PICTURE ON THERE YOU CAN    
SEE IS JUST A SCREENSHOT FROM I 

01:09:11.884 --> 01:09:12.850
THE PICTURE ON THERE YOU CAN    
SEE IS JUST A SCREENSHOT FROM I 
BELIEVE THIS IS A SANITARY AND  

01:09:12.852 --> 01:09:16.387
SEE IS JUST A SCREENSHOT FROM I 
BELIEVE THIS IS A SANITARY AND  
JUST SHOWING THAT IF IF A       

01:09:16.389 --> 01:09:20.057
BELIEVE THIS IS A SANITARY AND  
JUST SHOWING THAT IF IF A       
DEVELOPMENT WERE BUILT ON THIS  

01:09:20.059 --> 01:09:21.025
JUST SHOWING THAT IF IF A       
DEVELOPMENT WERE BUILT ON THIS  
LINE IT WOULD BE AT 90 PERCENT  

01:09:21.027 --> 01:09:23.327
DEVELOPMENT WERE BUILT ON THIS

LINE IT WOULD BE AT 90 PERCENT  
CAPACITY.                       
SO IF WE WERE TO BUILD ANOTHER  

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:28.165
CAPACITY.                       
SO IF WE WERE TO BUILD ANOTHER  
ONE, WHAT HAPPENS?              

01:09:28.167 --> 01:09:30.868
SO IF WE WERE TO BUILD ANOTHER  
ONE, WHAT HAPPENS?              
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE    

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:31.903
ONE, WHAT HAPPENS?              
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE    
NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT      

01:09:31.905 --> 01:09:35.706
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE    
NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT      
WE'RE PLANNING FOR AS WE DO THE 

01:09:35.708 --> 01:09:38.876
NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT      
WE'RE PLANNING FOR AS WE DO THE

THIS IS A ONE A BRIDGE THAT     
SERVES A PURPOSE FOR US TO GET  

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:41.172
THIS IS A ONE A BRIDGE THAT     
SERVES A PURPOSE FOR US TO GET
