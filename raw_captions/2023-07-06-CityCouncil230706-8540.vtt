01:13:25.497 --> 01:13:28.131
NAIVE.                          
YOU KNOW, I&apos;VE LIVED A WHILE AS 
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN AMERICA  

01:13:28.133 --> 01:13:28.866
YOU KNOW, I&apos;VE LIVED A WHILE AS

THE TRAUMA THAT THAT SITS IN TO 
MANY OF US WHEN WE HAVE THE     

01:13:37.176 --> 01:13:38.976
THE TRAUMA THAT THAT SITS IN TO 
MANY OF US WHEN WE HAVE THE

01:13:42.781 --> 01:13:46.650
STOPS.                          
AND I DO THINK THAT THIS THIS   
ORDINANCE WILL GIVE THE SPARK   

01:13:46.652 --> 01:13:47.451
AND I DO THINK THAT THIS THIS   
ORDINANCE WILL GIVE THE SPARK   
HOPEFULLY THAT THE NATION WILL  

01:13:47.453 --> 01:13:50.220
ORDINANCE WILL GIVE THE SPARK

THEY NEED TO THOSE WHO ARE, YOU 

01:13:58.197 --> 01:13:58.995

THEY NEED TO THOSE WHO ARE, YOU 
KNOW, SHOULDN&apos;T BE DOING THE    

01:13:58.997 --> 01:14:02.132
THEY NEED TO THOSE WHO ARE, YOU

JOB, LET THEM GET FIRED, LET    
THEM BE REMOVED.                

01:14:02.602 --> 01:14:03.533
JOB, LET THEM GET FIRED, LET    
THEM BE REMOVED.                
THOSE WHO ARE WISE ENOUGH TO    

01:14:03.535 --> 01:14:06.303
THEM BE REMOVED.                
THOSE WHO ARE WISE ENOUGH TO    
ADAPT ENJOY YOUR JOBS, HAVE     

01:14:06.305 --> 01:14:07.037
THOSE WHO ARE WISE ENOUGH TO    
ADAPT ENJOY YOUR JOBS, HAVE     
LESS STRESS AND TREAT PEOPLE

PREVAILING ENERGY FROM THIS     
SPARK.
