HOMES WITH TRIPLEX IS INQUIRED  
PLEXUS.                         
I STUDIED THIS IN DEPTH WHEN    

00:20:16.283 --> 00:20:17.116
PLEXUS.                         
I STUDIED THIS IN DEPTH WHEN    
THE ORIGINAL EIGHT TO ZERO PLAN 

00:20:17.118 --> 00:20:19.851
I STUDIED THIS IN DEPTH WHEN    
THE ORIGINAL EIGHT TO ZERO PLAN 
IN TWENTY TWENTY INCLUDED       

00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:20.685
THE ORIGINAL EIGHT TO ZERO PLAN 
IN TWENTY TWENTY INCLUDED       
ALLOWING QUAD PLEXUS ON EVERY

MY CONCLUSION THEN WAS THAT THE 

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:28.594
SOME MATH.                      
MY CONCLUSION THEN WAS THAT THE 
UNITS RESULTING FROM THAT       

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:30.562
MY CONCLUSION THEN WAS THAT THE 
UNITS RESULTING FROM THAT       
REPLACEMENT WOULD BE            

00:20:30.564 --> 00:20:31.196
UNITS RESULTING FROM THAT       
REPLACEMENT WOULD BE            
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE    

00:20:31.198 --> 00:20:31.930
REPLACEMENT WOULD BE            
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE    
THAN THE HOUSE THEY REPLACED.   

00:20:31.932 --> 00:20:35.333
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE    
THAN THE HOUSE THEY REPLACED.   
I SENT THOSE CALCULATIONS AND   

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:36.067
THAN THE HOUSE THEY REPLACED.   
I SENT THOSE CALCULATIONS AND   
RESULTS TO MRS. STULTZ AND      

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:39.405
I SENT THOSE CALCULATIONS AND   
RESULTS TO MRS. STULTZ AND      
COUNCIL LATER THAN A TWO ZERO   

00:20:39.407 --> 00:20:40.272

COUNCIL LATER THAN A TWO ZERO   
PLAN WAS REVISED TO TAKE THE    

00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:43.274

THE REFERENCE TO AFFORDABILITY  

00:20:46.046 --> 00:20:47.045
QUAD LAKESIDE OUT ALONG WITH    
THE REFERENCE TO AFFORDABILITY  
,HOUSE PRICES AND CONSTRUCTION  

00:20:47.047 --> 00:20:49.915
THE REFERENCE TO AFFORDABILITY  
,HOUSE PRICES AND CONSTRUCTION  
COSTS ARE SIMILAR INTEREST      

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:50.248
,HOUSE PRICES AND CONSTRUCTION  
COSTS ARE SIMILAR INTEREST      
RATES.                          

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.116
COSTS ARE SIMILAR INTEREST      
RATES.                          
I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE     

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:53.785
RATES.                          
I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE     
THAT THE OVERALL RESULT WILL BE 

00:20:53.787 --> 00:20:54.486
I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE     
THAT THE OVERALL RESULT WILL BE 
DIFFERENT NOW AND TRIPLICATES   

00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:55.287
THAT THE OVERALL RESULT WILL BE 
DIFFERENT NOW AND TRIPLICATES   
UNITS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN   

00:20:55.289 --> 00:20:58.090
DIFFERENT NOW AND TRIPLICATES   
UNITS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN   
QUAD'S BECAUSE THE LINK IS ONLY 

00:20:58.092 --> 00:20:58.557
UNITS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN   
QUAD'S BECAUSE THE LINK IS ONLY 
SPLIT THREE WAYS.               

00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.758
QUAD'S BECAUSE THE LINK IS ONLY 
SPLIT THREE WAYS.               
SO I THINK WE NEED TO FACE THE  

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.227
SPLIT THREE WAYS.               
SO I THINK WE NEED TO FACE THE  
REALITY THAT REPLACING HOUSES   

00:21:02.229 --> 00:21:03.161
SO I THINK WE NEED TO FACE THE  
REALITY THAT REPLACING HOUSES   
WITH TRIPLEX IS IS A TRADE OFF  

00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:06.331
REALITY THAT REPLACING HOUSES   
WITH TRIPLEX IS IS A TRADE OFF  
MORE UNITS BUT HIGHER PRICES IN 

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:07.065
WITH TRIPLEX IS IS A TRADE OFF  
MORE UNITS BUT HIGHER PRICES IN 
THE HOUSE THEY REPLACED SAY     

00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:10.002
MORE UNITS BUT HIGHER PRICES IN 
THE HOUSE THEY REPLACED SAY     
FIVE FIFTY TO SIX HUNDRED AND   

00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:10.869
THE HOUSE THEY REPLACED SAY     
FIVE FIFTY TO SIX HUNDRED AND   
UP VERSUS A FOUR HUNDRED        

00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:13.972
FIVE FIFTY TO SIX HUNDRED AND   
UP VERSUS A FOUR HUNDRED        
THOUSAND HOUSE IN MY RECENT     

00:21:13.974 --> 00:21:14.640
UP VERSUS A FOUR HUNDRED        
THOUSAND HOUSE IN MY RECENT     
DISCUSSION WITH COUNCIL MEMBER. 

00:21:14.642 --> 00:21:15.840
THOUSAND HOUSE IN MY RECENT     
DISCUSSION WITH COUNCIL MEMBER. 
YES, I THINK WE AGREE ON THAT   

00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:17.041
DISCUSSION WITH COUNCIL MEMBER. 
YES, I THINK WE AGREE ON THAT   
POINT.                          

00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:17.910
YES, I THINK WE AGREE ON THAT   
POINT.                          
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK MANY      

00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:18.644
POINT.                          
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK MANY      
FOLKS IN TOWN ARE PROMOTING THE 

00:21:18.646 --> 00:21:21.647
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK MANY      
FOLKS IN TOWN ARE PROMOTING THE 
OPPOSITE VIEW THAT THE TRIPLE   

00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:22.380
FOLKS IN TOWN ARE PROMOTING THE 
OPPOSITE VIEW THAT THE TRIPLE   
EXES WOULD BE THE SAME PRICE OR 

00:21:22.382 --> 00:21:24.950
OPPOSITE VIEW THAT THE TRIPLE   
EXES WOULD BE THE SAME PRICE OR 
LOWER WITHOUT DISCLOSING        

00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:25.751
EXES WOULD BE THE SAME PRICE OR

CLOSING THE BASIS FOR THAT      
BELIEF.                         
WE HAVE PEOPLE SAYING THEY

BELIEF.                         
WE HAVE PEOPLE SAYING THEY      
COULD BE FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN

SOMEHOW INCOMPATIBLE WITH       

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:43.154
ASSUMPTION THAT DENSITY IS      
SOMEHOW INCOMPATIBLE WITH       
FAMILY LIFE, THAT FAMILIES ONLY

FAMILY LIFE, THAT FAMILIES ONLY 
WANT TO LIVE IN LESS DENSE

WANT TO LIVE IN LESS DENSE      
AREAS, THAT YOU CAN'T BE A

WANT TO LIVE IN LESS DENSE      
AREAS, THAT YOU CAN'T BE A      
FAMILY IN A DENSE AREA.         

00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:50.596
AREAS, THAT YOU CAN'T BE A      
FAMILY IN A DENSE AREA.         
BUT IN REALITY SCARCITY IS      

00:23:50.598 --> 00:23:51.396
FAMILY IN A DENSE AREA.         
BUT IN REALITY SCARCITY IS      
INCOMPATIBLE WITH FAMILY LIFE.  

00:23:51.398 --> 00:23:55.033
BUT IN REALITY SCARCITY IS      
INCOMPATIBLE WITH FAMILY LIFE.  
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAMILY    

00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:55.701

DENSITY HOMES MAY BE IF         

00:23:58.471 --> 00:23:59.238
FRIENDLY YOU THINK THAT LOW     
DENSITY HOMES MAY BE IF         
FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD THEM TO

AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT CAN  
SUPPORT.                        
AND SO THAT THAT WAS THE        

01:59:09.944 --> 01:59:11.811
SUPPORT.

THINGS THAT REALLY MAKE NOT     
JUST HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO THE  

01:59:20.322 --> 01:59:21.053
THINGS THAT REALLY MAKE NOT     
JUST HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO THE  
RESIDENTS BUT AFFORDABLE TO     

01:59:21.055 --> 01:59:21.387
JUST HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO THE  
RESIDENTS BUT AFFORDABLE TO     
BUILD.                          

01:59:21.389 --> 01:59:24.089
RESIDENTS BUT AFFORDABLE TO     
BUILD.                          
AND I KNOW THAT IS NOT          

01:59:24.091 --> 01:59:28.094
BUILD.                          
AND I KNOW THAT IS NOT          
NECESSARILY THIS BODY ISSUE BUT 

01:59:28.096 --> 01:59:29.095
AND I KNOW THAT IS NOT          
NECESSARILY THIS BODY ISSUE BUT 
IT IS AN ISSUE AS IT PERTAINS   

01:59:29.097 --> 01:59:29.895
NECESSARILY THIS BODY ISSUE BUT 
IT IS AN ISSUE AS IT PERTAINS   
TO ACTUALLY BUILDING HOUSING.   

01:59:29.897 --> 01:59:32.298
IT IS AN ISSUE AS IT PERTAINS   
TO ACTUALLY BUILDING HOUSING.   
SO WE THINK SO.                 

01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.232
TO ACTUALLY BUILDING HOUSING.   
SO WE THINK SO.                 
SO THAT'S WHERE WE HIT THE      

01:59:33.234 --> 01:59:33.966
SO WE THINK SO.                 
SO THAT'S WHERE WE HIT THE      
BALANCE AND WE JUST THOUGHT     

01:59:33.968 --> 01:59:36.035
SO THAT'S WHERE WE HIT THE      
BALANCE AND WE JUST THOUGHT     
COULD WE HAVE A FEW MORE        

01:59:36.037 --> 01:59:36.535
BALANCE AND WE JUST THOUGHT     
COULD WE HAVE A FEW MORE        
ADDITIONAL UNITS?               

01:59:36.537 --> 01:59:37.003
COULD WE HAVE A FEW MORE        
ADDITIONAL UNITS?               
THAT'S WONDERFUL.               

01:59:37.005 --> 01:59:37.870
ADDITIONAL UNITS?               
THAT'S WONDERFUL.               
I THOUGHT FOR ONCE I WAS GOING  

01:59:37.872 --> 01:59:40.339

ESSENTIALLY HELD WHILE THE

LAND TRUST THAT WOULD BE TAKING

THERE MIGHT BE UNINTENDED       

02:43:56.761 --> 02:43:59.462
ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND WE REALLY 
THERE MIGHT BE UNINTENDED       
CONSEQUENCES WHICH I INFERRED   

02:43:59.464 --> 02:44:00.730
THERE MIGHT BE UNINTENDED       
CONSEQUENCES WHICH I INFERRED   
TO BE A CASE OF SOMEONE WITH A  

02:44:00.732 --> 02:44:03.266
CONSEQUENCES WHICH I INFERRED   
TO BE A CASE OF SOMEONE WITH A  
LONG STANDING SMALL HOME IN ANN 

02:44:03.268 --> 02:44:04.000
TO BE A CASE OF SOMEONE WITH A  
LONG STANDING SMALL HOME IN ANN 
ARBOR DECIDING THAT THEY WOULD  

02:44:04.002 --> 02:44:07.236
LONG STANDING SMALL HOME IN ANN 
ARBOR DECIDING THAT THEY WOULD  
BUILD A SEVENTEEN HUNDRED       

02:44:07.238 --> 02:44:10.774
ARBOR DECIDING THAT THEY WOULD  
BUILD A SEVENTEEN HUNDRED       
SQUARE FOOT UNIT WOULD ON THIS  

02:44:10.776 --> 02:44:11.841
BUILD A SEVENTEEN HUNDRED       
SQUARE FOOT UNIT WOULD ON THIS  
ONE LOT AND THEN THE CITY WOULD 

02:44:11.843 --> 02:44:15.111
SQUARE FOOT UNIT WOULD ON THIS  
ONE LOT AND THEN THE CITY WOULD 
HAVE TROUBLE ENFORCING THE      

02:44:15.113 --> 02:44:17.881
ONE LOT AND THEN THE CITY WOULD 
HAVE TROUBLE ENFORCING THE      
AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS AND     

02:44:17.883 --> 02:44:18.749
HAVE TROUBLE ENFORCING THE      
AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS AND     
EVENTUALLY IT COULD BE SOLD AT  

02:44:18.751 --> 02:44:19.149
AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS AND     
EVENTUALLY IT COULD BE SOLD AT  
MARKET RATE.                    

02:44:19.151 --> 02:44:23.786
EVENTUALLY IT COULD BE SOLD AT  
MARKET RATE.                    
IT WOULD JUST BE A MESS.        

02:44:23.788 --> 02:44:24.888
MARKET RATE.                    
IT WOULD JUST BE A MESS.        
AND SO THAT'S THE MAIN          

02:44:24.890 --> 02:44:29.459
IT WOULD JUST BE A MESS.        
AND SO THAT'S THE MAIN          
OBJECTION I HEARD AT THE NOW WE 

02:44:29.461 --> 02:44:31.995
AND SO THAT'S THE MAIN          
OBJECTION I HEARD AT THE NOW WE 
HEARD IT FROM MR. RENT.         

02:44:31.997 --> 02:44:32.996
OBJECTION I HEARD AT THE NOW WE 
HEARD IT FROM MR. RENT.         
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT   

02:44:32.998 --> 02:44:33.663
HEARD IT FROM MR. RENT.         
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT   
BUT THESE BUILDINGS ARE         

02:44:33.665 --> 02:44:35.732
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT   
BUT THESE BUILDINGS ARE         
DESIGNED TO BE ALL ELECTRIC.    

02:44:35.734 --> 02:44:36.400
BUT THESE BUILDINGS ARE         
DESIGNED TO BE ALL ELECTRIC.    
OBVIOUSLY THAT CAUGHT MY        

02:44:36.402 --> 02:44:36.767
DESIGNED TO BE ALL ELECTRIC.    
OBVIOUSLY THAT CAUGHT MY        
ATTENTION.                      

02:44:36.769 --> 02:44:37.734
OBVIOUSLY THAT CAUGHT MY        
ATTENTION.                      
I HAD KNOWN THIS FOR A WHILE    

02:44:37.736 --> 02:44:40.370
ATTENTION.                      
I HAD KNOWN THIS FOR A WHILE    
THIS ANY DESIGN AND THAT'S TO   

02:44:40.372 --> 02:44:41.038
I HAD KNOWN THIS FOR A WHILE    
THIS ANY DESIGN AND THAT'S TO   
THEIR CREDIT THEY UNDERSTAND    

02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:42.773
THIS ANY DESIGN AND THAT'S TO   
THEIR CREDIT THEY UNDERSTAND    
THE CLIMATE IMPERATIVE.         

02:44:42.775 --> 02:44:46.743
THEIR CREDIT THEY UNDERSTAND    
THE CLIMATE IMPERATIVE.         
WHY NOT ADD A NO GAS            

02:44:46.745 --> 02:44:50.614
THE CLIMATE IMPERATIVE.         
WHY NOT ADD A NO GAS            
REQUIREMENT TO THE AIDOO        

02:44:50.616 --> 02:44:51.081
WHY NOT ADD A NO GAS            
REQUIREMENT TO THE AIDOO        
AMENDMENT?                      

02:44:51.083 --> 02:44:55.218
REQUIREMENT TO THE AIDOO        
AMENDMENT?                      
SO IN THAT CASE VERY FEW        

02:44:55.220 --> 02:44:56.085
AMENDMENT?                      
SO IN THAT CASE VERY FEW        
EXISTING HOMES IN ANN ARBOR DO  

02:44:56.087 --> 02:44:59.322
SO IN THAT CASE VERY FEW        
EXISTING HOMES IN ANN ARBOR DO  
NOT HAVE A GAS CONNECTION       

02:44:59.324 --> 02:44:59.790
EXISTING HOMES IN ANN ARBOR DO  
NOT HAVE A GAS CONNECTION       
VANISHINGLY FEW.                

02:44:59.792 --> 02:45:02.059
NOT HAVE A GAS CONNECTION       
VANISHINGLY FEW.                
SO THIS WOULD SERVE TO          

02:45:02.061 --> 02:45:02.659
VANISHINGLY FEW.                
SO THIS WOULD SERVE TO          
EFFECTIVELY LIMIT THE           

02:45:02.661 --> 02:45:06.262
SO THIS WOULD SERVE TO          
EFFECTIVELY LIMIT THE           
APPLICABILITY OF THIS AMENDMENT 

02:45:06.264 --> 02:45:10.166
EFFECTIVELY LIMIT THE           
APPLICABILITY OF THIS AMENDMENT 
TO THE ACT PROJECT WHICH I      

02:45:10.168 --> 02:45:13.936
APPLICABILITY OF THIS AMENDMENT 
TO THE ACT PROJECT WHICH I      
THINK WAS A MAJOR CONCERN       

02:45:13.938 --> 02:45:17.341
TO THE ACT PROJECT WHICH I      
THINK WAS A MAJOR CONCERN       
OF STAFF AND SO THE YOU KNOW,   

02:45:17.343 --> 02:45:18.208
THINK WAS A MAJOR CONCERN       
OF STAFF AND SO THE YOU KNOW,   
THE WORDING WOULD JUST READ FOR 

02:45:18.210 --> 02:45:20.977
OF STAFF AND SO THE YOU KNOW,   
THE WORDING WOULD JUST READ FOR 
LOTS WERE BOTH THE PRINCIPLE    

02:45:20.979 --> 02:45:21.812
THE WORDING WOULD JUST READ FOR

BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME      
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ANSWER.

CAN YOU HELP ME OR DO YOU KNOW  
WHAT THE AVERAGE OR TYPICAL LOT 
SIZE IS THE LOTS THAT YOU ARE   

03:00:38.296 --> 03:00:41.630

SIZE IS THE LOTS THAT YOU ARE   
BUILDING THESE ON?              

03:00:41.632 --> 03:00:42.631
SIZE IS THE LOTS THAT YOU ARE   
BUILDING THESE ON?              
WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINE PARCELS  

03:00:42.633 --> 03:00:46.035
BUILDING THESE ON?              
WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINE PARCELS  
FOR THESE FIRST TWENTY FOUR     

03:00:46.037 --> 03:00:49.205
WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINE PARCELS  
FOR THESE FIRST TWENTY FOUR     
HOMES TWO OF THE PARCELS WE     

03:00:49.207 --> 03:00:52.675
FOR THESE FIRST TWENTY FOUR     
HOMES TWO OF THE PARCELS WE     
INTEND TO DO LAND DIVISION I    

03:00:52.677 --> 03:00:56.812
HOMES TWO OF THE PARCELS WE     
INTEND TO DO LAND DIVISION I    
THINK SEVEN OF THE PARCELS ARE  

03:00:56.814 --> 03:01:00.916
INTEND TO DO LAND DIVISION I    
THINK SEVEN OF THE PARCELS ARE  
OUR ONE B AND OUR ONE C WE HAVE 

03:01:00.918 --> 03:01:01.784
THINK SEVEN OF THE PARCELS ARE  
OUR ONE B AND OUR ONE C WE HAVE 
TWO PARCELS ON WAGGNER TWO THAT 

03:01:01.786 --> 03:01:04.920
OUR ONE B AND OUR ONE C WE HAVE 
TWO PARCELS ON WAGGNER TWO THAT 
ARE ONE D AND SO THOSE ARE THE  

03:01:04.922 --> 03:01:05.788
TWO PARCELS ON WAGGNER TWO THAT 
ARE ONE D AND SO THOSE ARE THE  
ONES THAT ARE RESTRICTED TO SIX 

03:01:05.790 --> 03:01:08.890
ARE ONE D AND SO THOSE ARE THE  
ONES THAT ARE RESTRICTED TO SIX 
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WHICH IS    

03:01:08.892 --> 03:01:12.761
ONES THAT ARE RESTRICTED TO SIX 
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WHICH IS    
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC.       

03:01:12.763 --> 03:01:13.696
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WHICH IS    
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC.       
THAT'S THE ROOT OF MY QUESTION  

03:01:13.698 --> 03:01:16.031
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC.       
THAT'S THE ROOT OF MY QUESTION  
REALLY IS LIKE WHETHER SO JUST  

03:01:16.033 --> 03:01:16.765
THAT'S THE ROOT OF MY QUESTION  
REALLY IS LIKE WHETHER SO JUST  
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T ALREADY    

03:01:16.767 --> 03:01:17.399
REALLY IS LIKE WHETHER SO JUST  
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T ALREADY    
KNOW WE TALK ABOUT EIGHT        

03:01:17.401 --> 03:01:20.068
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T ALREADY    
KNOW WE TALK ABOUT EIGHT        
HUNDRED SQUARE BECAUSE THAT'S   

03:01:20.070 --> 03:01:21.036
KNOW WE TALK ABOUT EIGHT        
HUNDRED SQUARE BECAUSE THAT'S   
MORE OFTEN THE CASE BUT IT CAN  

03:01:21.038 --> 03:01:23.806
HUNDRED SQUARE BECAUSE THAT'S   
MORE OFTEN THE CASE BUT IT CAN  
BE CURRENTLY RESTRICTED SIX     

03:01:23.808 --> 03:01:24.673
MORE OFTEN THE CASE BUT IT CAN  
BE CURRENTLY RESTRICTED SIX     
HUNDRED FEET SO YOU HAVE TWO    

03:01:24.675 --> 03:01:25.341
BE CURRENTLY RESTRICTED SIX     
HUNDRED FEET SO YOU HAVE TWO    
THAT ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THE    

03:01:25.343 --> 03:01:28.377
HUNDRED FEET SO YOU HAVE TWO    
THAT ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THE    
REST WOULD BE AT THIS EIGHT     

03:01:28.379 --> 03:01:29.178
THAT ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THE    
REST WOULD BE AT THIS EIGHT     
HUNDRED LIMIT YOU THINK ABOUT.  

03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:31.813
REST WOULD BE AT THIS EIGHT     
HUNDRED LIMIT YOU THINK ABOUT.  
YES.                            

03:01:31.815 --> 03:01:36.251
HUNDRED LIMIT YOU THINK ABOUT.  
YES.                            
AND THEN MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK    

03:01:36.253 --> 03:01:36.985
YES.                            
AND THEN MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK    
YOU I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME      

03:01:36.987 --> 03:01:37.753
AND THEN MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK    
YOU I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME      
QUESTIONS OR STUFF BUT I'LL TRY 

03:01:37.755 --> 03:01:38.420

03:01:38.422 --> 03:01:39.688
QUESTIONS OR STUFF BUT I'LL TRY 
TO GET MY QUESTIONS TO YOU      
FIRST SO THEN THERE ARE A WHOLE 

03:01:39.690 --> 03:01:42.891
TO GET MY QUESTIONS TO YOU      
FIRST SO THEN THERE ARE A WHOLE 
LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT        

03:01:42.893 --> 03:01:43.759
FIRST SO THEN THERE ARE A WHOLE 
LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT        
REGULATE THE AREA HIGH AND      

03:01:43.761 --> 03:01:46.695
LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT        
REGULATE THE AREA HIGH AND      
PLACEMENT OF OF EIGHTY YEARS    

03:01:46.697 --> 03:01:47.396
REGULATE THE AREA HIGH AND      
PLACEMENT OF OF EIGHTY YEARS    
BEYOND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE SO    

03:01:47.398 --> 03:01:48.130
PLACEMENT OF OF EIGHTY YEARS    
BEYOND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE SO    
THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT HEIGHT    

03:01:48.132 --> 03:01:48.464
BEYOND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE SO    
THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT HEIGHT    
LIMIT.                          

03:01:48.466 --> 03:01:50.599
THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT HEIGHT    
LIMIT.                          
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT REGULATION  

03:01:50.601 --> 03:01:51.801
LIMIT.                          
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT REGULATION  
ABOUT HOW AND IN WHAT WAY THEY  

03:01:51.803 --> 03:01:54.936
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT REGULATION  
ABOUT HOW AND IN WHAT WAY THEY  
CAN BE AND SETBACKS HOW MUCH    

03:01:54.938 --> 03:01:55.771
ABOUT HOW AND IN WHAT WAY THEY  
CAN BE AND SETBACKS HOW MUCH    
OF THE REAR SETBACK AREA THEY   

03:01:55.773 --> 03:01:59.174
CAN BE AND SETBACKS HOW MUCH    
OF THE REAR SETBACK AREA THEY   
CAN TAKE UP IF THEY'RE DETACHED 

03:01:59.176 --> 03:01:59.975
OF THE REAR SETBACK AREA THEY   
CAN TAKE UP IF THEY'RE DETACHED 
OR ATTACH SOME OF THOSE RULES   

03:01:59.977 --> 03:02:01.877
CAN TAKE UP IF THEY'RE DETACHED 
OR ATTACH SOME OF THOSE RULES   
CHANGE.                         

03:02:01.879 --> 03:02:03.045
OR ATTACH SOME OF THOSE RULES   
CHANGE.                         
SO I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT IN   

03:02:03.047 --> 03:02:06.982
CHANGE.                         
SO I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT IN   
THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL AND I     

03:02:06.984 --> 03:02:07.750
SO I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT IN   
THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL AND I     
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH      

03:02:07.752 --> 03:02:07.950
THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL AND I     
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH      
THAT.                           

03:02:07.952 --> 03:02:08.684
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH      
THAT.                           
AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAVE      

03:02:08.686 --> 03:02:10.118
THAT.                           
AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAVE      
THOUGHT LIKE IT DOESN'T SEEM    

03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:10.886

03:02:14.057 --> 03:02:14.623
LIKE YOU ARE ALSO PLANNING TO   
OR DO THESE MEET THE TWENTY ONE 
FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT OF AN         

03:02:14.625 --> 03:02:15.424
OR DO THESE MEET THE TWENTY ONE 
FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT OF AN         
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE THEY WON'T  

03:02:15.426 --> 03:02:18.460
FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT OF AN         
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE THEY WON'T  
BE AS CUTE AS THE RENDERING     

03:02:18.462 --> 03:02:19.161
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE THEY WON'T  
BE AS CUTE AS THE RENDERING     
BECAUSE I THINK THE RENDERING   

03:02:19.163 --> 03:02:22.398
BE AS CUTE AS THE RENDERING     
BECAUSE I THINK THE RENDERING   
SHOW IS PROBABLY A BIT ABOVE    

03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:25.735
BECAUSE I THINK THE RENDERING   
SHOW IS PROBABLY A BIT ABOVE    
THE TWENTY ONE NORFORK CAN      

03:02:25.737 --> 03:02:26.602
SHOW IS PROBABLY A BIT ABOVE    
THE TWENTY ONE NORFORK CAN      
BUILD IT WITH A LOWER ROOF      

03:02:26.604 --> 03:02:26.935
THE TWENTY ONE NORFORK CAN      
BUILD IT WITH A LOWER ROOF

CLOSER THAN THREE FEET TO THE   
SET TO THE LINE.                
THAT'S OK.                      

03:03:28.332 --> 03:03:29.198
SET TO THE LINE.                
THAT'S OK.                      
AND FOR THE REAR STEP BACK THEY 

03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:29.799
THAT'S OK.                      
AND FOR THE REAR STEP BACK THEY 
ACTUALLY ALSO CAN BE IN THE     

03:03:29.801 --> 03:03:30.666
AND FOR THE REAR STEP BACK THEY 
ACTUALLY ALSO CAN BE IN THE     
REAR STEP BACK NO CLOSER THAN   

03:03:30.668 --> 03:03:31.467
ACTUALLY ALSO CAN BE IN THE

FIVE PERCENT OF THE REAR THAT   
BACK AREA.                      
SO IS THAT A REQUIREMENT THAT   

03:03:34.805 --> 03:03:35.403
BACK AREA.

THERE MAY BE AN OCCASION WHERE  

03:03:41.178 --> 03:03:42.178
BACK IN THE FUTURE.             
THERE MAY BE AN OCCASION WHERE  
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT WE'RE   

03:03:42.180 --> 03:03:45.780
THERE MAY BE AN OCCASION WHERE  
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT WE'RE   
PURPOSELY TRYING TO GO FOR THIS 

03:03:45.782 --> 03:03:46.582
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT WE'RE

ISSUES IS THE IMPERVA           
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.             
SO THIS HAS A SMALLER FOOTPRINT 

03:03:53.624 --> 03:03:57.526
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.             
SO THIS HAS A SMALLER FOOTPRINT 
THAT'S HELPFUL THERE AS WELL.   

03:03:57.528 --> 03:03:58.327
SO THIS HAS A SMALLER FOOTPRINT 
THAT'S HELPFUL THERE AS WELL.   
FOUNDATIONS ARE THE MOST

ALTERNATIVE OPTION IS A LITTLE  

03:11:38.455 --> 03:11:41.289

03:11:42.325 --> 03:11:45.526
BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS

FOR EXAMPLE, YOU COULD JUST SAY

FLEXIBILITY TO BUILD HOUSING    
BUT AT THE END AT THE CORE WE   
ZONED BASED ON LAND USES AND I  

03:12:05.915 --> 03:12:06.648
BUT AT THE END AT THE CORE WE   
ZONED BASED ON LAND USES AND I

ZONED BASED ON LAND USES AND I  
THINK I CAN'T SIT HERE AND      
RECOMMEND THAT WE ENACT SOME    

03:12:08.752 --> 03:12:09.885
THINK I CAN'T SIT HERE AND      
RECOMMEND THAT WE ENACT SOME    
LAND USE THAT WE ARE SAYING IS  

03:12:09.887 --> 03:12:10.585
RECOMMEND THAT WE ENACT SOME    
LAND USE THAT WE ARE SAYING IS  
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT IS OWNED 

03:12:10.587 --> 03:12:13.121
LAND USE THAT WE ARE SAYING IS  
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT IS OWNED 
BY ONE ENTITY AND FOR SOME      

03:12:13.123 --> 03:12:13.922
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT IS OWNED 
BY ONE ENTITY AND FOR SOME      
REASON THAT LAND USE WOULD NOT  

03:12:13.924 --> 03:12:16.591
BY ONE ENTITY AND FOR SOME      
REASON THAT LAND USE WOULD NOT  
BE APPROPRIATE IF IT WAS OWNED  

03:12:16.593 --> 03:12:17.291
REASON THAT LAND USE WOULD NOT  
BE APPROPRIATE IF IT WAS OWNED  
BY ANOTHER ENTITY.              

03:12:17.293 --> 03:12:18.326
BE APPROPRIATE IF IT WAS OWNED  
BY ANOTHER ENTITY.              
>> I SEE THE MARKET ABOUT IT    

03:12:18.328 --> 03:12:19.127
BY ANOTHER ENTITY.              
>> I SEE THE MARKET ABOUT IT    
BUT I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO   

03:12:19.129 --> 03:12:20.795
>> I SEE THE MARKET ABOUT IT    
BUT I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO   
THAT QUICKLY.                   

03:12:20.797 --> 03:12:21.930
BUT I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO   
THAT QUICKLY.                   
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT I'M  

03:12:21.932 --> 03:12:22.798
THAT QUICKLY.                   
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT I'M  
SAYING I THINK OR WHAT IS BEING 

03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:24.833
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT I'M  
SAYING I THINK OR WHAT IS BEING 
PROPOSED IT'S NOT ABOUT THE     

03:12:24.835 --> 03:12:25.567
SAYING I THINK OR WHAT IS BEING 
PROPOSED IT'S NOT ABOUT THE     
ENTITY, IT'S ABOUT THE          

03:12:25.569 --> 03:12:26.034
PROPOSED IT'S NOT ABOUT THE     
ENTITY, IT'S ABOUT THE          
AFFORDABILITY.                  

03:12:26.036 --> 03:12:26.768
ENTITY, IT'S ABOUT THE          
AFFORDABILITY.                  
SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS 

03:12:26.770 --> 03:12:29.137
AFFORDABILITY.                  
SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS 
THAT A PARTICULAR DENSER FORM   

03:12:29.139 --> 03:12:29.971
SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS 
THAT A PARTICULAR DENSER FORM   
OF LAND USE MAY BE APPROPRIATE  

03:12:29.973 --> 03:12:30.505
THAT A PARTICULAR DENSER FORM   
OF LAND USE MAY BE APPROPRIATE  
IF THERE ARE CERTAIN            

03:12:30.507 --> 03:12:32.840
OF LAND USE MAY BE APPROPRIATE  
IF THERE ARE CERTAIN            
AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS OR   

03:12:32.842 --> 03:12:33.308
IF THERE ARE CERTAIN            
AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS OR

AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS OR   
RESTRICTIONS.

IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THESE     
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BUYERS 

03:19:32.962 --> 03:19:34.128
IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THESE

BUT IF WE HAVE TO REZONE THAT   

03:19:45.441 --> 03:19:48.509
THEN BUILD A HOME FOR THEM.     
BUT IF WE HAVE TO REZONE THAT   
FEELS VERY RISKY TO THEM TO PUT 

03:19:48.511 --> 03:19:49.177
BUT IF WE HAVE TO REZONE THAT

IT COULD HAVE THE AFFORDABLE    

03:46:04.619 --> 03:46:05.485
PORTABLE COMPONENT.             
IT COULD HAVE THE AFFORDABLE    
COMPONENT EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T

WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IS THAT    
ACTUALLY THAT SIX HUNDRED AND   

03:46:24.172 --> 03:46:24.838
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IS THAT    
ACTUALLY THAT SIX HUNDRED AND   
EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET ARE   

03:46:24.840 --> 03:46:27.907
ACTUALLY THAT SIX HUNDRED AND   
EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET ARE   
EVEN MORE LIMITED BECAUSE FOR   

03:46:27.909 --> 03:46:31.878
EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET ARE   
EVEN MORE LIMITED BECAUSE FOR   
THE EDU IT'S THAT OR IT CANNOT  

03:46:31.880 --> 03:46:32.678
EVEN MORE LIMITED BECAUSE FOR   
THE EDU IT'S THAT OR IT CANNOT  
EXCEED THE FOOTPRINT, NOT THE   

03:46:32.680 --> 03:46:36.148
THE EDU IT'S THAT OR IT CANNOT  
EXCEED THE FOOTPRINT, NOT THE   
TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT THE    

03:46:36.150 --> 03:46:36.816
EXCEED THE FOOTPRINT, NOT THE   
TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT THE    
FOOTPRINT OF THE PRIMARY UNIT.  

03:46:36.818 --> 03:46:39.085
TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT THE    
FOOTPRINT OF THE PRIMARY UNIT.  
SO IF YOU HAVE IF YOUR CURRENT  

03:46:39.087 --> 03:46:39.919
FOOTPRINT OF THE PRIMARY UNIT.  
SO IF YOU HAVE IF YOUR CURRENT  
UNIT IS SIX HUNDRED LET'S SAY

WE CREATED A DEFINITION FOR     

03:48:36.271 --> 03:48:39.706
APPROACH IS TO JUST JUST LIKE   
WE CREATED A DEFINITION FOR     
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND    

03:48:39.708 --> 03:48:40.606
WE CREATED A DEFINITION FOR     
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND    
SAID HERE'S WHERE ACCESSORY     

03:48:40.608 --> 03:48:41.307
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND    
SAID HERE'S WHERE ACCESSORY     
DWELLING UNITS ARE ALLOWED.     

03:48:41.309 --> 03:48:43.676
SAID HERE'S WHERE ACCESSORY     
DWELLING UNITS ARE ALLOWED.     
WE HAVE A DEFINITION ACTUALLY   

03:48:43.678 --> 03:48:44.443
DWELLING UNITS ARE ALLOWED.     
WE HAVE A DEFINITION ACTUALLY   
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING 

03:48:44.445 --> 03:48:45.311
WE HAVE A DEFINITION ACTUALLY   
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING 
UNITS AND WE COULD JUST SAY FOR 

03:48:45.313 --> 03:48:48.181
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING 
UNITS AND WE COULD JUST SAY FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WE     

03:48:48.183 --> 03:48:48.982
UNITS AND WE COULD JUST SAY FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WE     
CARE ABOUT ONE UP TO SEVENTEEN  

03:48:48.984 --> 03:48:51.684
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WE     
CARE ABOUT ONE UP TO SEVENTEEN  
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET ON ANY LONG 

03:48:51.686 --> 03:48:55.621
CARE ABOUT ONE UP TO SEVENTEEN  
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET ON ANY LONG 
PERIOD LIKE LIKE WHAT ARE THEY  

03:48:55.623 --> 03:48:59.259
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET ON ANY LONG 
PERIOD LIKE LIKE WHAT ARE THEY  
MOTION FOR THAT I WOULD SAY I'M 

03:48:59.261 --> 03:49:00.059
PERIOD LIKE LIKE WHAT ARE THEY  
MOTION FOR THAT I WOULD SAY I'M 
SUGGESTING THAT THAT'S ANOTHER  

03:49:00.061 --> 03:49:03.529
MOTION FOR THAT I WOULD SAY I'M 
SUGGESTING THAT THAT'S ANOTHER  
APPROACH THAT COMES WITH THE    

03:49:03.531 --> 03:49:06.365
SUGGESTING THAT THAT'S ANOTHER  
APPROACH THAT COMES WITH THE    
UNINFORMED I GUESS THIS IS      

03:49:06.367 --> 03:49:06.933
APPROACH THAT COMES WITH THE    
UNINFORMED I GUESS THIS IS      
WHERE IT RELAXES THOSE          

03:49:06.935 --> 03:49:09.935
UNINFORMED I GUESS THIS IS      
WHERE IT RELAXES THOSE          
RESTRICTIONS RIGHT.             

03:49:09.937 --> 03:49:10.837
WHERE IT RELAXES THOSE          
RESTRICTIONS RIGHT.             
BUT IT COMES WITH THE           

03:49:10.839 --> 03:49:11.571
RESTRICTIONS RIGHT.             
BUT IT COMES WITH THE           
ENFORCEABILITY AND SO I DON'T   

03:49:11.573 --> 03:49:14.473
BUT IT COMES WITH THE           
ENFORCEABILITY AND SO I DON'T   
THINK THAT STAFF IS GOING TO BE 

03:49:14.475 --> 03:49:15.108
ENFORCEABILITY AND SO I DON'T   
THINK THAT STAFF IS GOING TO BE 
ANY MORE EXCITED ABOUT THAT     

03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:18.077
THINK THAT STAFF IS GOING TO BE 
ANY MORE EXCITED ABOUT THAT     
BECAUSE IT'S STILL IT'S STILL   

03:49:18.079 --> 03:49:18.778
ANY MORE EXCITED ABOUT THAT     
BECAUSE IT'S STILL IT'S STILL   
LACKS THE ENFORCEABILITY THAT   

03:49:18.780 --> 03:49:21.481
BECAUSE IT'S STILL IT'S STILL   
LACKS THE ENFORCEABILITY THAT   
YOU BROUGHT UP IN THE FIRST     

03:49:21.483 --> 03:49:21.814
LACKS THE ENFORCEABILITY THAT   
YOU BROUGHT UP IN THE FIRST     
PLACE.                          

03:49:21.816 --> 03:49:25.017
YOU BROUGHT UP IN THE FIRST     
PLACE.                          
SO BUT MAYBE I'LL STOP AND SAY  

03:49:25.019 --> 03:49:26.019
PLACE.

PUTTING TOGETHER EMOTION?       
SO WHEN I COME BACK AFTER

ME.                             
YEAH.                           

04:41:56.768 --> 04:42:00.069
ME.                             
YEAH.                           
AND I THINK MAYBE IT WAS JUST   

04:42:00.071 --> 04:42:00.904
YEAH.                           
AND I THINK MAYBE IT WAS JUST   
MAYBE WHAT I WAS SECRETLY       

04:42:00.906 --> 04:42:01.637
AND I THINK MAYBE IT WAS JUST   
MAYBE WHAT I WAS SECRETLY       
HOPING WAS THAT WE COULD JUST   

04:42:01.639 --> 04:42:03.640
MAYBE WHAT I WAS SECRETLY       
HOPING WAS THAT WE COULD JUST   
CALL THESE GOALS OR THAT        

04:42:03.642 --> 04:42:07.310
HOPING WAS THAT WE COULD JUST   
CALL THESE GOALS OR THAT        
THERE'S SOMETHING CONFUSING FOR 

04:42:07.312 --> 04:42:08.111
CALL THESE GOALS OR THAT        
THERE'S SOMETHING CONFUSING FOR 
ME ABOUT HAVING GOALS AND       

04:42:08.113 --> 04:42:08.911
THERE'S SOMETHING CONFUSING FOR 
ME ABOUT HAVING GOALS AND       
OBJECTIVES THAT ARE DIFFERENT.  

04:42:08.913 --> 04:42:11.480
ME ABOUT HAVING GOALS AND       
OBJECTIVES THAT ARE DIFFERENT.  
SO BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE      

04:42:11.482 --> 04:42:12.281
OBJECTIVES THAT ARE DIFFERENT.  
SO BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE      
SUGGESTING IS THAT WE WILL THEN 

04:42:12.283 --> 04:42:15.084
SO BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE      
SUGGESTING IS THAT WE WILL THEN 
LINK THESE TO GOALS.            

04:42:15.086 --> 04:42:16.152
SUGGESTING IS THAT WE WILL THEN 
LINK THESE TO GOALS.            
I THINK THAT WE CAN REMOVE THE  

04:42:16.154 --> 04:42:16.886
LINK THESE TO GOALS.            
I THINK THAT WE CAN REMOVE THE  
WORD OBJECTIVES BECAUSE THESE   

04:42:16.888 --> 04:42:18.988
I THINK THAT WE CAN REMOVE THE  
WORD OBJECTIVES BECAUSE THESE   
ARE AS I CAN SEE THEM THESE ARE 

04:42:18.990 --> 04:42:19.588
WORD OBJECTIVES BECAUSE THESE   
ARE AS I CAN SEE THEM THESE ARE 
THE METRICS, RIGHT?             

04:42:19.590 --> 04:42:20.389
ARE AS I CAN SEE THEM THESE ARE 
THE METRICS, RIGHT?             
THESE ARE THE NUMBER THE        

04:42:20.391 --> 04:42:22.659
THE METRICS, RIGHT?             
THESE ARE THE NUMBER THE        
TANGIBLE THINGS THAT I CAN      

04:42:22.661 --> 04:42:23.526
THESE ARE THE NUMBER THE        
TANGIBLE THINGS THAT I CAN      
COUNT AND MEASURE OVER TIME TO  

04:42:23.528 --> 04:42:27.363
TANGIBLE THINGS THAT I CAN      
COUNT AND MEASURE OVER TIME TO  
SEE OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR    

04:42:27.365 --> 04:42:27.597
COUNT AND MEASURE OVER TIME TO  
SEE OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR    
GOALS.                          

04:42:27.599 --> 04:42:28.531
SEE OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR    
GOALS.                          
SO I THINK THAT WE COULD GO     

04:42:28.533 --> 04:42:30.766
GOALS.                          
SO I THINK THAT WE COULD GO     
THAT WITH THAT RATE AND THEN    

04:42:30.768 --> 04:42:33.970
SO I THINK THAT WE COULD GO     
THAT WITH THAT RATE AND THEN    
THE PAGE TITLE WOULD BE JUST    

04:42:33.972 --> 04:42:34.770
THAT WITH THAT RATE AND THEN

DON'T THINK I THINK WE HAD

SILLY QUESTION BUT DO           
ADJECTIVES COME AFTER THE GOALS 

04:45:13.164 --> 04:45:17.233
SILLY QUESTION BUT DO           
ADJECTIVES COME AFTER THE GOALS 
LIKE HERE IS GOAL AND HERE ARE  

04:45:17.235 --> 04:45:18.101
ADJECTIVES COME AFTER THE GOALS 
LIKE HERE IS GOAL AND HERE ARE  
THE OBJECTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH  

04:45:18.103 --> 04:45:19.668
LIKE HERE IS GOAL AND HERE ARE  
THE OBJECTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH  
IT OR IS THE OBJECTIVE BIGGER   

04:45:19.670 --> 04:45:20.302
THE OBJECTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH  
IT OR IS THE OBJECTIVE BIGGER   
THAN THE GOAL?                  

04:45:20.304 --> 04:45:21.236
IT OR IS THE OBJECTIVE BIGGER   
THAN THE GOAL?                  
DOES THAT MAKE IN ORDER TO DO   

04:45:21.238 --> 04:45:22.038
THAN THE GOAL?                  
DOES THAT MAKE IN ORDER TO DO   
THAT MAPPING LIKE I GUESS I'M   

04:45:22.040 --> 04:45:24.340
DOES THAT MAKE IN ORDER TO DO   
THAT MAPPING LIKE I GUESS I'M   
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHICH IS   

04:45:24.342 --> 04:45:24.974
THAT MAPPING LIKE I GUESS I'M   
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHICH IS   
THE HIGHER LEVEL THING.         

04:45:24.976 --> 04:45:26.108
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHICH IS   
THE HIGHER LEVEL THING.         
SO LET ME LET ME GO BACK TO THE 

04:45:26.110 --> 04:45:28.377
THE HIGHER LEVEL THING.         
SO LET ME LET ME GO BACK TO THE 
PLAN BECAUSE I I KNOW NOT       

04:45:28.379 --> 04:45:32.047
SO LET ME LET ME GO BACK TO THE 
PLAN BECAUSE I I KNOW NOT       
EVERYONE LOVED THIS GRAPHIC BUT 

04:45:32.049 --> 04:45:35.685
PLAN BECAUSE I I KNOW NOT       
EVERYONE LOVED THIS GRAPHIC BUT 
I DO BELIEVE THAT WE TRIED TO   

04:45:35.687 --> 04:45:36.352
EVERYONE LOVED THIS GRAPHIC BUT 
I DO BELIEVE THAT WE TRIED TO   
EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP        

04:45:36.354 --> 04:45:39.622
I DO BELIEVE THAT WE TRIED TO   
EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP        
BETWEEN ALL OF THESE SO I'M     

04:45:39.624 --> 04:45:40.657
EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP        
BETWEEN ALL OF THESE SO I'M     
GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO FIND    

04:45:40.659 --> 04:45:41.323
BETWEEN ALL OF THESE SO I'M     
GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO FIND    
WHAT PAGE THIS IS ON.           

04:45:41.325 --> 04:45:44.126
GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO FIND    
WHAT PAGE THIS IS ON.           
>> BUT GENERALLY IT GOES YOU    

04:45:44.128 --> 04:45:45.060
WHAT PAGE THIS IS ON.           
>> BUT GENERALLY IT GOES YOU    
KNOW, GOALS ARE THE BROADEST    

04:45:45.062 --> 04:45:48.598

KNOW, GOALS ARE THE BROADEST    
AND THEN LIKE A FUNNEL YOU GO   

04:45:48.600 --> 04:45:49.399
KNOW, GOALS ARE THE BROADEST    
AND THEN LIKE A FUNNEL YOU GO   
DOWN TO YOUR ACTION IS YOUR     

04:45:49.401 --> 04:45:51.734
AND THEN LIKE A FUNNEL YOU GO   
DOWN TO YOUR ACTION IS YOUR     
MOST SPECIFIC THING.

IN THE IMPLEMENTATION MATRIX.   
RIGHT.                          
AND SO LET ME TRY TO FIND THIS  

04:45:55.873 --> 04:45:59.108
RIGHT.                          
AND SO LET ME TRY TO FIND THIS  
HERE SO OUR GOALS AND

AND SO LET ME TRY TO FIND THIS  
HERE SO OUR GOALS AND           
OBJECTIVES DIFFERENT OVERALL    

04:46:02.947 --> 04:46:03.613
HERE SO OUR GOALS AND

BETWEEN GOAL AND METRICS IS     
COOL WHAT KIND OF MAPPING THEM  
TO SEE LIKE DO WE HAVE METRICS

04:54:10.234 --> 04:54:13.369
REALLY THE COMMISSION AS I      
RECALL OVER OUR DISCUSSIONS     
WE'VE RECOGNIZED A DIFFERENCE   

04:54:13.371 --> 04:54:17.239
RECALL OVER OUR DISCUSSIONS     
WE'VE RECOGNIZED A DIFFERENCE   
BETWEEN INCOME CONSTRAINED      

04:54:17.241 --> 04:54:18.039
WE'VE RECOGNIZED A DIFFERENCE   
BETWEEN INCOME CONSTRAINED      
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MIDDLE   

04:54:18.041 --> 04:54:21.944
BETWEEN INCOME CONSTRAINED      
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MIDDLE   
OR MISSING AND SO NOW WE HAVE A 

04:54:21.946 --> 04:54:22.611
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MIDDLE   
OR MISSING AND SO NOW WE HAVE A 
POLICY TO INCREASE INCOME

I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT TERM IT   
CAME IN ON.                     
SO I'M WONDERING IF WE SHOULD   

04:54:31.889 --> 04:54:33.189

04:54:37.461 --> 04:54:38.260
OF HOUSING TYPES?               
WELL, SO THERE'S DIVERSITY      
OF TYPES AND THEN THERE'S NO SO 

04:54:38.262 --> 04:54:40.629
WELL, SO THERE'S DIVERSITY      
OF TYPES AND THEN THERE'S NO SO 
WE HAVE DIVERSITY OF TYPES      

04:54:40.631 --> 04:54:41.430
OF TYPES AND THEN THERE'S NO SO 
WE HAVE DIVERSITY OF TYPES      
WHICH KIND OF COVERS EVERYTHING 

04:54:41.432 --> 04:54:44.399
WE HAVE DIVERSITY OF TYPES      
WHICH KIND OF COVERS EVERYTHING 
AND THEN WE HAVE A NUMBER       

04:54:44.401 --> 04:54:45.100
WHICH KIND OF COVERS EVERYTHING 
AND THEN WE HAVE A NUMBER       
OF INCOME ELIGIBLE AFFORDABLE   

04:54:45.102 --> 04:54:45.634

SHOULD WE ALSO INCREASE THE     
NUMBER OF WHAT WAS THE TERM WE  
CAME WITH MISSING MIDDLE

>> IT'S DESIGN IN TERMS TO BE   
MORE ACCESSIBLE.                
IT'S WHY IT FEELS LIKE          

04:59:10.167 --> 04:59:13.601

MAKE A NEW DISTRICT ON THE FLY  

05:11:05.214 --> 05:11:08.116
THINK IT'S A BAD SOLUTION TO    
MAKE A NEW DISTRICT ON THE FLY  
WHEN WE CAN DELEGATE THE TASK   

05:11:08.118 --> 05:11:11.452
MAKE A NEW DISTRICT ON THE FLY  
WHEN WE CAN DELEGATE THE TASK   
PROPERLY FOR THE TOUGH CASES TO 

05:11:11.454 --> 05:11:15.689
WHEN WE CAN DELEGATE THE TASK   
PROPERLY FOR THE TOUGH CASES TO 
ZONING TO TACKLE FOR US WE CAN  

05:11:15.691 --> 05:11:16.757
PROPERLY FOR THE TOUGH CASES TO 
ZONING TO TACKLE FOR US WE CAN  
ALSO TAKE A SWING AT A FEW      

05:11:16.759 --> 05:11:17.091
ZONING TO TACKLE FOR US WE CAN  
ALSO TAKE A SWING AT A FEW      
OF THESE.                       

05:11:17.093 --> 05:11:19.828
ALSO TAKE A SWING AT A FEW      
OF THESE.                       
BUT YOU KNOW, COUNCIL MEMBER,   

05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:20.761
OF THESE.                       
BUT YOU KNOW, COUNCIL MEMBER,   
JUST TO YOUR POINT, YOU'VE BEEN 

05:11:20.763 --> 05:11:22.263
BUT YOU KNOW, COUNCIL MEMBER,   
JUST TO YOUR POINT, YOU'VE BEEN 
STRUGGLING WITH THE PLYMOUTH    

05:11:22.265 --> 05:11:23.364
JUST TO YOUR POINT, YOU'VE BEEN 
STRUGGLING WITH THE PLYMOUTH    
ROAD CORRIDOR AND A WAY OUT     

05:11:23.366 --> 05:11:27.001
STRUGGLING WITH THE PLYMOUTH    
ROAD CORRIDOR AND A WAY OUT     
OF THE BOX IS TO SAY WE WILL    

05:11:27.003 --> 05:11:27.668
ROAD CORRIDOR AND A WAY OUT     
OF THE BOX IS TO SAY WE WILL    
SOLVE THAT IN ZONING.           

05:11:27.670 --> 05:11:28.769
OF THE BOX IS TO SAY WE WILL    
SOLVE THAT IN ZONING.           
WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE A PRECISE 

05:11:28.771 --> 05:11:31.138
SOLVE THAT IN ZONING.           
WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE A PRECISE 
RECOMMENDATION AND OUR PROCESS  

05:11:31.140 --> 05:11:31.873
WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE A PRECISE 
RECOMMENDATION AND OUR PROCESS  
ISN'T SET UP TO MAKE THESE      

05:11:31.875 --> 05:11:32.540
RECOMMENDATION AND OUR PROCESS  
ISN'T SET UP TO MAKE THESE      
DETERMINATIONS AND LOOK AT      

05:11:32.542 --> 05:11:35.109
ISN'T SET UP TO MAKE THESE      
DETERMINATIONS AND LOOK AT      
THINGS LIKE TRAFFIC STUDIES FOR 

05:11:35.111 --> 05:11:39.013
DETERMINATIONS AND LOOK AT      
THINGS LIKE TRAFFIC STUDIES FOR 
ONE PARCEL AND WE CAN JUST SAY  

05:11:39.015 --> 05:11:39.714
THINGS LIKE TRAFFIC STUDIES FOR 
ONE PARCEL AND WE CAN JUST SAY  
ON OUR MAP IT'S AN ORDER AND    

05:11:39.716 --> 05:11:42.449
ONE PARCEL AND WE CAN JUST SAY  
ON OUR MAP IT'S AN ORDER AND    
WE'LL DEAL WITH IT WHEN WE GET  

05:11:42.451 --> 05:11:42.717
ON OUR MAP IT'S AN ORDER AND    
WE'LL DEAL WITH IT WHEN WE GET  
ZONING.                         

05:11:42.719 --> 05:11:43.718
WE'LL DEAL WITH IT WHEN WE GET  
ZONING.                         
WE'VE HANDLED THE REST OF THE   

05:11:43.720 --> 05:11:43.985
ZONING.                         
WE'VE HANDLED THE REST OF THE   
MAP.                            

05:11:43.987 --> 05:11:46.820
WE'VE HANDLED THE REST OF THE   
MAP.                            
WE SHOULDN'T GET STUCK AND      

05:11:46.822 --> 05:11:47.888
MAP.                            
WE SHOULDN'T GET STUCK AND      
DELAY OUR PROCESS BY A MONTH OR 

05:11:47.890 --> 05:11:50.324
WE SHOULDN'T GET STUCK AND      
DELAY OUR PROCESS BY A MONTH OR 
MORE OVER A FEW OF THESE.       

05:11:50.326 --> 05:11:51.358
DELAY OUR PROCESS BY A MONTH OR 
MORE OVER A FEW OF THESE.       
SO THAT WOULD BE MY PROPOSAL    

05:11:51.360 --> 05:11:54.195
MORE OVER A FEW OF THESE.       
SO THAT WOULD BE MY PROPOSAL    
FOR THE REMAINING PARCELS, THE  

05:11:54.197 --> 05:11:54.762
SO THAT WOULD BE MY PROPOSAL    
FOR THE REMAINING PARCELS, THE  
ONES THAT WE'VE ALREADY         

05:11:54.764 --> 05:11:57.765
FOR THE REMAINING PARCELS, THE  
ONES THAT WE'VE ALREADY         
DISPOSITIONED INTO HUB AND      

05:11:57.767 --> 05:11:58.532
ONES THAT WE'VE ALREADY         
DISPOSITIONED INTO HUB AND      
TRANSITION WE WOULD LEAVE ALONE 

05:11:58.534 --> 05:12:01.135
DISPOSITIONED INTO HUB AND      
TRANSITION WE WOULD LEAVE ALONE 
AND THE REMAINING I CAN'T       

05:12:01.137 --> 05:12:01.936
TRANSITION WE WOULD LEAVE ALONE 
AND THE REMAINING I CAN'T       
REMEMBER IF IT'S IT'S LIKE A    

05:12:01.938 --> 05:12:04.572
AND THE REMAINING I CAN'T       
REMEMBER IF IT'S IT'S LIKE A    
SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE KIND OF NO   

05:12:04.574 --> 05:12:05.640
REMEMBER IF IT'S IT'S LIKE A    
SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE KIND OF NO   
THOSE WOULD GO TO AN CATEGORY   

05:12:05.642 --> 05:12:09.343
SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE KIND OF NO   
THOSE WOULD GO TO AN CATEGORY   
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE THE 

05:12:09.345 --> 05:12:09.978
THOSE WOULD GO TO AN CATEGORY   
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE THE 
GOLF COURSE WHAT THE PRIVATE    

05:12:09.980 --> 05:12:12.780
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE THE 
GOLF COURSE WHAT THE PRIVATE    
GOLF COURSES WE MIGHT BE ABLE   

05:12:12.782 --> 05:12:13.448
GOLF COURSE WHAT THE PRIVATE    
GOLF COURSES WE MIGHT BE ABLE   
TO TAKE A POSITION ON.          

05:12:13.450 --> 05:12:14.415
GOLF COURSES WE MIGHT BE ABLE   
TO TAKE A POSITION ON.          
BUT THE RESIDENTIAL ONES I      

05:12:14.417 --> 05:12:16.417
TO TAKE A POSITION ON.          
BUT THE RESIDENTIAL ONES I      
THINK WE CAN SAY THIS IS        

05:12:16.419 --> 05:12:17.218
BUT THE RESIDENTIAL ONES I      
THINK WE CAN SAY THIS IS        
RESIDENTIAL OR TRANSITION ON    

05:12:17.220 --> 05:12:17.885
THINK WE CAN SAY THIS IS        
RESIDENTIAL OR TRANSITION ON    
OUR MAP WITH JUST A DIFFERENT   

05:12:17.887 --> 05:12:20.154
RESIDENTIAL OR TRANSITION ON    
OUR MAP WITH JUST A DIFFERENT   
COLOR OR CROSSHATCHING OR       

05:12:20.156 --> 05:12:20.754
OUR MAP WITH JUST A DIFFERENT   
COLOR OR CROSSHATCHING OR       
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            

05:12:20.756 --> 05:12:21.689
COLOR OR CROSSHATCHING OR       
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            
>> SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD   

05:12:21.691 --> 05:12:23.991
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            
>> SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD   
MAKE GOOD SENSE.                

05:12:23.993 --> 05:12:27.661
>> SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD   
MAKE GOOD SENSE.                
I WOULD WANT TO REQUEST THAT    

05:12:27.663 --> 05:12:32.000
MAKE GOOD SENSE.                
I WOULD WANT TO REQUEST THAT    
THAT THE UNDERSTANDING          

05:12:32.002 --> 05:12:35.803
I WOULD WANT TO REQUEST THAT    
THAT THE UNDERSTANDING          
OF RESIDENTIAL THAT WAS THE     

05:12:35.805 --> 05:12:36.504
THAT THE UNDERSTANDING          
OF RESIDENTIAL THAT WAS THE     
ORIGINAL LANGUAGE FROM COUNCIL  

05:12:36.506 --> 05:12:39.440
OF RESIDENTIAL THAT WAS THE     
ORIGINAL LANGUAGE FROM COUNCIL  
WHICH CONTAINED THE PROVISION   

05:12:39.442 --> 05:12:43.544
ORIGINAL LANGUAGE FROM COUNCIL  
WHICH CONTAINED THE PROVISION   
THAT LARGER BUILDING TYPOLOGIES 

05:12:43.546 --> 05:12:47.749
WHICH CONTAINED THE PROVISION   
THAT LARGER BUILDING TYPOLOGIES 
ARE AUTHORIZED IN THE WHERE     

05:12:47.751 --> 05:12:51.552
THAT LARGER BUILDING TYPOLOGIES 
ARE AUTHORIZED IN THE WHERE     
THEY WOULD FIT INTO EXISTING    

05:12:51.554 --> 05:12:55.623
ARE AUTHORIZED IN THE WHERE     
THEY WOULD FIT INTO EXISTING    
NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXTS WOULD BE  

05:12:55.625 --> 05:12:56.524
THEY WOULD FIT INTO EXISTING    
NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXTS WOULD BE  
BACK BECAUSE I DON'T I REALLY   

05:12:56.526 --> 05:12:59.861
NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXTS WOULD BE  
BACK BECAUSE I DON'T I REALLY   
DON'T THINK THE COUNCIL MEANT   

05:12:59.863 --> 05:13:00.961
BACK BECAUSE I DON'T I REALLY   
DON'T THINK THE COUNCIL MEANT   
TO SAY THAT ONLY THREE STOREY   

05:13:00.963 --> 05:13:04.265
DON'T THINK THE COUNCIL MEANT   
TO SAY THAT ONLY THREE STOREY   
TRIPLEX IS NOTHING BIGGER       

05:13:04.267 --> 05:13:05.199
TO SAY THAT ONLY THREE STOREY   
TRIPLEX IS NOTHING BIGGER       
BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO NOT MAKE 

05:13:05.201 --> 05:13:08.235
TRIPLEX IS NOTHING BIGGER       
BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO NOT MAKE 
THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY BIGGER  

05:13:08.237 --> 05:13:11.071
BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO NOT MAKE 
THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY BIGGER  
UNBUILDABLE AND THEN I THINK    

05:13:11.073 --> 05:13:15.810
THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY BIGGER  
UNBUILDABLE AND THEN I THINK    
THAT IF IF WE COULD PUT IN      

05:13:15.812 --> 05:13:19.080
UNBUILDABLE AND THEN I THINK    
THAT IF IF WE COULD PUT IN      
TRANSITION THE LANGUAGE         

05:13:19.082 --> 05:13:25.987
THAT IF IF WE COULD PUT IN      
TRANSITION THE LANGUAGE         
OF INFILL BECAUSE I MEAN I      

05:13:25.989 --> 05:13:26.988
TRANSITION THE LANGUAGE         
OF INFILL BECAUSE I MEAN I      
THINK THAT I HAD JUST A LOT     

05:13:26.990 --> 05:13:29.657
OF INFILL BECAUSE I MEAN I      
THINK THAT I HAD JUST A LOT     
OF ISSUES WHEN WE WERE PUTTING  

05:13:29.659 --> 05:13:33.560
THINK THAT I HAD JUST A LOT     
OF ISSUES WHEN WE WERE PUTTING  
TRANSITION ON THE PLACES THAT   

05:13:33.562 --> 05:13:38.032
OF ISSUES WHEN WE WERE PUTTING  
TRANSITION ON THE PLACES THAT   
ARE SUBURBAN LIKE ENCLAVES AND  

05:13:38.034 --> 05:13:38.766
TRANSITION ON THE PLACES THAT   
ARE SUBURBAN LIKE ENCLAVES AND  
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE TRANSITION  

05:13:38.768 --> 05:13:41.836
ARE SUBURBAN LIKE ENCLAVES AND  
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE TRANSITION  
TO ME BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ON   

05:13:41.838 --> 05:13:42.170
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE TRANSITION  
TO ME BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ON   
ARTERIALS.                      

05:13:42.172 --> 05:13:43.104
TO ME BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ON   
ARTERIALS.                      
BUT THEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT   

05:13:43.106 --> 05:13:43.771
ARTERIALS.                      
BUT THEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT   
THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE        

05:13:43.773 --> 05:13:46.407
BUT THEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT   
THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE        
APPROVED INFILL HOUSING AND WE  

05:13:46.409 --> 05:13:50.278
THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE        
APPROVED INFILL HOUSING AND WE  
HAVE THEY'VE NEEDED SOMETIMES   

05:13:50.280 --> 05:13:54.415
APPROVED INFILL HOUSING AND WE  
HAVE THEY'VE NEEDED SOMETIMES   
ZONING CATEGORIES LIKE AH FOR A

TRANSITION SO SO IT'S OF ONCE   
IT'S THE ONES THAT WERE NOT     
TREATED BUT THE REASON FOR ME   

05:23:03.031 --> 05:23:03.930
IT'S THE ONES THAT WERE NOT     
TREATED BUT THE REASON FOR ME   
IN DOING THIS IS THAT DECIDING  

05:23:03.932 --> 05:23:06.834
TREATED BUT THE REASON FOR ME   
IN DOING THIS IS THAT DECIDING  
WHETHER THEY'RE TRANSITION OR   

05:23:06.836 --> 05:23:10.704
IN DOING THIS IS THAT DECIDING  
WHETHER THEY'RE TRANSITION OR   
RESIDENTIAL REALLY DEPENDS HOW  

05:23:10.706 --> 05:23:15.376
WHETHER THEY'RE TRANSITION OR   
RESIDENTIAL REALLY DEPENDS HOW  
WE INTEND THE INTENT STATEMENTS

05:26:55.898 --> 05:26:56.696
THE WAY I WOULD PHRASE IT IS    
NOT THAT WE'RE HUNTING BUT

THERE IS A COMMENT HERE THAT    
AREAS THAT HAVE HUB DIRECTLY    

05:38:49.877 --> 05:38:50.410
THERE IS A COMMENT HERE THAT    
AREAS THAT HAVE HUB DIRECTLY    
ADJACENT TO RESIDENTIAL         

05:38:50.412 --> 05:38:51.210
AREAS THAT HAVE HUB DIRECTLY    
ADJACENT TO RESIDENTIAL         
DISTRICT SHOULD HUB HAVE SOME   

05:38:51.212 --> 05:38:52.011
ADJACENT TO RESIDENTIAL         
DISTRICT SHOULD HUB HAVE SOME   
TYPE OF BUFFER FROM RESIDENTIAL 

05:38:52.013 --> 05:38:52.578
DISTRICT SHOULD HUB HAVE SOME

05:38:53.214 --> 05:38:53.913
THROUGH TRANSITION.             
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO   
DISCUSS BUT I DO THINK THE NEXT 

05:38:53.915 --> 05:38:54.713
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO   
DISCUSS BUT I DO THINK THE NEXT 
ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED   

05:38:54.715 --> 05:38:55.415
DISCUSS BUT I DO THINK THE NEXT 
ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED   
WHERE IT SAYS THE CURRENT DROP  

05:38:55.417 --> 05:38:56.149
ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED   
WHERE IT SAYS THE CURRENT DROP  
DOWN ZONES AND IT NAMES A LOT   

05:38:56.151 --> 05:38:56.816
WHERE IT SAYS THE CURRENT DROP  
DOWN ZONES AND IT NAMES A LOT   
OF THESE AREAS WE'VE ALREADY    

05:38:56.818 --> 05:38:59.185
DOWN ZONES AND IT NAMES A LOT   
OF THESE AREAS WE'VE ALREADY    
BEEN DISCUSSING SO I WOULD SAY  

05:38:59.187 --> 05:39:02.021
OF THESE AREAS WE'VE ALREADY    
BEEN DISCUSSING SO I WOULD SAY  
THAT THAT THAT'S BEEN COVERED . 

05:39:02.023 --> 05:39:03.022
BEEN DISCUSSING SO I WOULD SAY  
THAT THAT THAT'S BEEN COVERED .

05:39:06.527 --> 05:39:09.895
THEY REMAIN COVERED SO          
INDUSTRIAL AND PICK ONE AREA OK

THAT BOTH OF THEM MAY TAPER

THAT BOTH OF THEM MAY TAPER

I THINK IN THIS CASE IT WAS     
RESIDENTIAL IS THE LAND USE

CATEGORY AND THEN IF WE HAD TWO 

05:45:24.472 --> 05:45:27.506
RESIDENTIAL IS THE LAND USE     
CATEGORY AND THEN IF WE HAD TWO 
TIERS UNDER IT THOSE WERE

IT MIGHT MAKE IT CLEARER THAT   
OUR RESIDENTIAL CATEGORY DOES

IT MIGHT MAKE IT CLEARER THAT   
OUR RESIDENTIAL CATEGORY DOES   
NOW UNIQUELY INCLUDE

OUR RESIDENTIAL CATEGORY DOES   
NOW UNIQUELY INCLUDE            
OPPORTUNITY FOR NEIGHBORHOOD

NOW UNIQUELY INCLUDE            
OPPORTUNITY FOR NEIGHBORHOOD    
COMMERCIAL WHICH IS NOT RIGHT.  

05:46:48.989 --> 05:46:51.923
OPPORTUNITY FOR NEIGHBORHOOD

AND SO THERE WAS A PUBLIC       

05:46:51.925 --> 05:46:52.625

NOT CALLING THEM RESIDENTIAL.   
I THINK EVEN COMMISSIONER DISH  
ARTICULATED THAT AT EIGHT FIVE  

05:47:07.875 --> 05:47:14.179
I THINK EVEN COMMISSIONER DISH  
ARTICULATED THAT AT EIGHT FIVE  
SO GREAT COMMISSIONER ABRAMS    

05:47:14.181 --> 05:47:15.014
ARTICULATED THAT AT EIGHT FIVE

PROFFER A COMMA IN I WOULD SAY  
THAT I THINK I ASKED THE FIFTH  

06:01:35.942 --> 06:01:39.010
PROFFER A COMMA IN I WOULD SAY  
THAT I THINK I ASKED THE FIFTH  
WHICH WAS I MEAN IS IT COUNCIL  

06:01:39.012 --> 06:01:39.744
THAT I THINK I ASKED THE FIFTH  
WHICH WAS I MEAN IS IT COUNCIL  
IS NOT A PROFESSOR              

06:01:39.746 --> 06:01:40.145
WHICH WAS I MEAN IS IT COUNCIL  
IS NOT A PROFESSOR              
OF ARCHITECTURE.                

06:01:40.147 --> 06:01:43.048
IS NOT A PROFESSOR              
OF ARCHITECTURE.                
IT'S NOT AN ARCHITECT.          

06:01:43.050 --> 06:01:43.414
OF ARCHITECTURE.                
IT'S NOT AN ARCHITECT.          
RIGHT.                          

06:01:43.416 --> 06:01:44.382
IT'S NOT AN ARCHITECT.          
RIGHT.                          
AND NOR SHOULD THEY NECESSARILY 

06:01:44.384 --> 06:01:47.418
RIGHT.                          
AND NOR SHOULD THEY NECESSARILY 
BE I THINK THIS IS COUCHED IN   

06:01:47.420 --> 06:01:47.652
AND NOR SHOULD THEY NECESSARILY 
BE I THINK THIS IS COUCHED IN   
LOGIC.                          

06:01:47.654 --> 06:01:48.653
BE I THINK THIS IS COUCHED IN   
LOGIC.                          
SO I THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT  

06:01:48.655 --> 06:01:50.455
LOGIC.                          
SO I THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT  
OF SHOULD WE ACTUALLY TRY TO    

06:01:50.457 --> 06:01:51.189
SO I THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT  
OF SHOULD WE ACTUALLY TRY TO    
GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THIS       

06:01:51.191 --> 06:01:51.522
OF SHOULD WE ACTUALLY TRY TO    
GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THIS       
AGAIN?                          

06:01:51.524 --> 06:01:52.290
GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THIS       
AGAIN?                          
AND ALSO TO ME ACTUALLY IT'S    

06:01:52.292 --> 06:01:54.693

MORE ABOUT THE BAD CULTURE AS   

06:01:54.695 --> 06:01:55.493
AND ALSO TO ME ACTUALLY IT'S    
MORE ABOUT THE BAD CULTURE AS   
WE TALKED ABOUT THREE UNITS     

06:01:55.495 --> 06:01:57.528
MORE ABOUT THE BAD CULTURE AS   
WE TALKED ABOUT THREE UNITS     
OF TEN BEDS OR YOU KNOW, SIX    

06:01:57.530 --> 06:01:57.896
WE TALKED ABOUT THREE UNITS     
OF TEN BEDS OR YOU KNOW, SIX    
BEDS IS YEAH.                   

06:01:57.898 --> 06:02:00.998
OF TEN BEDS OR YOU KNOW, SIX    
BEDS IS YEAH.                   
YEAH.                           

06:02:01.000 --> 06:02:01.700
BEDS IS YEAH.                   
YEAH.                           
VASTLY DIFFERENT PROPOSITION    

06:02:01.702 --> 06:02:05.337
YEAH.                           
VASTLY DIFFERENT PROPOSITION    
THAN THREE SINGLE YOU KNOW,     

06:02:05.339 --> 06:02:06.138
VASTLY DIFFERENT PROPOSITION    
THAN THREE SINGLE YOU KNOW,     
SINGLES OR EVEN SIX SINGLE      

06:02:06.140 --> 06:02:09.007
THAN THREE SINGLE YOU KNOW,     
SINGLES OR EVEN SIX SINGLE      
APARTMENTS.

SINGLES OR EVEN SIX SINGLE      
APARTMENTS.                     
SO I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT     

06:02:10.144 --> 06:02:14.112

BEING PRESENTED HERE AND SEE IF 
THERE'S LOGIC BEHIND IT ITSELF  
ANYWAYS THAT'S THAT'S MY TWO
