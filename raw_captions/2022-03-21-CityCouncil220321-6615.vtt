I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S SOMETHING WE CAN 

01:31:18.918 --> 01:31:21.319
ANALYSIS.                       
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S SOMETHING WE CAN 
WE CAN CERTAINLY EXPLORE AS     

01:31:21.321 --> 01:31:22.120
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S SOMETHING WE CAN 
WE CAN CERTAINLY EXPLORE AS     
PART OF OUR COLLABORATION MORE  

01:31:22.122 --> 01:31:22.387
WE CAN CERTAINLY EXPLORE AS

01:31:22.389 --> 01:31:25.090
PART OF OUR COLLABORATION MORE  
BROADLY.                        
BUT THIS WAS REALLY ONE HUNDRED 

01:31:25.092 --> 01:31:25.890
BROADLY.                        
BUT THIS WAS REALLY ONE HUNDRED 
PERCENT CITY OWNED CONTROLLED   

01:31:25.892 --> 01:31:29.160
BUT THIS WAS REALLY ONE HUNDRED 
PERCENT CITY OWNED CONTROLLED   
SITES LIKE ACHAKZAI WHERE OUR   

01:31:29.162 --> 01:31:29.961
PERCENT CITY OWNED CONTROLLED   
SITES LIKE ACHAKZAI WHERE OUR   
VENDING MACHINES THAT WE HAVE   

01:31:29.963 --> 01:31:33.365
SITES LIKE ACHAKZAI WHERE OUR   
VENDING MACHINES THAT WE HAVE   
IN CITY HALL WHEN WE HAVE A     

01:31:33.367 --> 01:31:34.232
VENDING MACHINES THAT WE HAVE   
IN CITY HALL WHEN WE HAVE A     
FOOD CONTRACT THAT WAS FORMERLY 

01:31:34.234 --> 01:31:36.601
IN CITY HALL WHEN WE HAVE A     
FOOD CONTRACT THAT WAS FORMERLY 
TASTY GREEN FOR EXAMPLE, MAKING 

01:31:36.603 --> 01:31:37.535
FOOD CONTRACT THAT WAS FORMERLY 
TASTY GREEN FOR EXAMPLE, MAKING 
WHEN THEY COME IN THEY ALSO     

01:31:37.537 --> 01:31:40.672
TASTY GREEN FOR EXAMPLE, MAKING 
WHEN THEY COME IN THEY ALSO     
OFFER SUSTAINABLE FOOD OPTIONS  

01:31:40.674 --> 01:31:41.005
WHEN THEY COME IN THEY ALSO     
OFFER SUSTAINABLE FOOD OPTIONS  
.                               

01:31:41.007 --> 01:31:41.940
OFFER SUSTAINABLE FOOD OPTIONS  
.                               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS WOULD BE FOOD THAT   

01:31:41.942 --> 01:31:42.673
.                               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS WOULD BE FOOD THAT   
WOULD BE CONTRACTED THROUGH THE 

01:31:42.675 --> 01:31:45.609
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS WOULD BE FOOD THAT   
WOULD BE CONTRACTED THROUGH THE 
CITY, NOT OVERSIGHT OVER PUBLIC 

01:31:45.611 --> 01:31:48.279
WOULD BE CONTRACTED THROUGH THE

EVENTS THAT ARE HOSTED ON CITY  

01:31:48.281 --> 01:31:49.013
CITY, NOT OVERSIGHT OVER PUBLIC 
EVENTS THAT ARE HOSTED ON CITY  
SITES JUST TO CLARIFY THAT.     

01:31:49.015 --> 01:31:51.882
EVENTS THAT ARE HOSTED ON CITY  
SITES JUST TO CLARIFY THAT.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF THERE IS A COMMUNITY   

01:31:51.884 --> 01:31:52.817
SITES JUST TO CLARIFY THAT.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF THERE IS A COMMUNITY   
COOKOUT WITH ME, THIS IS        

01:31:52.819 --> 01:31:55.920
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF THERE IS A COMMUNITY   
COOKOUT WITH ME, THIS IS        
SOMETHING I THINK THE COMMUNITY 

01:31:55.922 --> 01:31:57.054
COOKOUT WITH ME, THIS IS        
SOMETHING I THINK THE COMMUNITY 
WOULD WONDER, YOU KNOW, IF IF   

01:31:57.056 --> 01:32:00.124
SOMETHING I THINK THE COMMUNITY 
WOULD WONDER, YOU KNOW, IF IF   
THERE IS UNSUSTAINED FOOD       

01:32:00.126 --> 01:32:00.825
WOULD WONDER, YOU KNOW, IF IF   
THERE IS UNSUSTAINED FOOD       
THAT&amp;apos;S BEING SHARED THAT&amp;apos;S      

01:32:00.827 --> 01:32:04.295
THERE IS UNSUSTAINED FOOD       
THAT&amp;apos;S BEING SHARED THAT&amp;apos;S      
CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE.         

01:32:04.297 --> 01:32:05.296
THAT&amp;apos;S BEING SHARED THAT&amp;apos;S      
CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MEAN WHERE DOES THAT FALL  

01:32:05.298 --> 01:32:08.499
CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MEAN WHERE DOES THAT FALL  
WITHIN WITH THE KNOW A FEW      

01:32:08.501 --> 01:32:09.167
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MEAN WHERE DOES THAT FALL  
WITHIN WITH THE KNOW A FEW      
CLARIFYING THINGS IF THE CITY   

01:32:09.169 --> 01:32:12.537
WITHIN WITH THE KNOW A FEW      
CLARIFYING THINGS IF THE CITY   
ITSELF IS A HOST OF THAT THEN   

01:32:12.539 --> 01:32:13.204
CLARIFYING THINGS IF THE CITY   
ITSELF IS A HOST OF THAT THEN   
WE WOULD BE OFFERING            

01:32:13.206 --> 01:32:15.172
ITSELF IS A HOST OF THAT THEN   
WE WOULD BE OFFERING            
SUSTAINABLE FOOD OPTIONS AND    

01:32:15.174 --> 01:32:15.940
WE WOULD BE OFFERING            
SUSTAINABLE FOOD OPTIONS AND    
THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT&amp;apos;S REALLY IMPORTANT  

01:32:15.942 --> 01:32:16.540
SUSTAINABLE FOOD OPTIONS AND    
THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT&amp;apos;S REALLY IMPORTANT  
IN THE RESOLUTION ITSELF.       

01:32:16.542 --> 01:32:19.176
THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT&amp;apos;S REALLY IMPORTANT  
IN THE RESOLUTION ITSELF.       
IT&amp;apos;S NOT ACTUALLY BANNING MOST  

01:32:19.178 --> 01:32:19.910
IN THE RESOLUTION ITSELF.       
IT&amp;apos;S NOT ACTUALLY BANNING MOST  
THINGS CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE.  

01:32:19.912 --> 01:32:20.378
IT&amp;apos;S NOT ACTUALLY BANNING MOST  
THINGS CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE.  
FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY              

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.914
THINGS CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE.  
FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY              
UNEQUIVOCALLY APPROPRIATE BUT   

01:32:22.916 --> 01:32:23.781
FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY              
UNEQUIVOCALLY APPROPRIATE BUT   
IT&amp;apos;S ALSO PROVIDING OPTIONS AND 

01:32:23.783 --> 01:32:24.482
UNEQUIVOCALLY APPROPRIATE BUT   
IT&amp;apos;S ALSO PROVIDING OPTIONS AND 
MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW   

01:32:24.484 --> 01:32:27.318
IT&amp;apos;S ALSO PROVIDING OPTIONS AND 
MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW   
THERE ISN&amp;apos;T A CHOICE IF YOU&amp;apos;RE  

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.286
MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW   
THERE ISN&amp;apos;T A CHOICE IF YOU&amp;apos;RE  
A VEGAN, IF THERE ISN&amp;apos;T AN      

01:32:28.288 --> 01:32:29.153
THERE ISN&amp;apos;T A CHOICE IF YOU&amp;apos;RE  
A VEGAN, IF THERE ISN&amp;apos;T AN      
OPTION YOU COULD GET A BAG      

01:32:29.155 --> 01:32:31.723
A VEGAN, IF THERE ISN&amp;apos;T AN      
OPTION YOU COULD GET A BAG      
OF CHIPS PERHAPS AND THAT&amp;apos;S NOT

OF CHIPS PERHAPS AND THAT&amp;apos;S NOT 
HEALTHY EITHER.                 
AND SO THE FIRST STEP IS MAKING 

01:32:33.092 --> 01:32:35.694
HEALTHY EITHER.                 
AND SO THE FIRST STEP IS MAKING 
SURE THAT WE CAN FEED PEOPLE    

01:32:35.696 --> 01:32:36.361
AND SO THE FIRST STEP IS MAKING 
SURE THAT WE CAN FEED PEOPLE    
THAT CHOICE FOR SELECTING A     

01:32:36.363 --> 01:32:39.430
SURE THAT WE CAN FEED PEOPLE    
THAT CHOICE FOR SELECTING A     
MORE SUSTAINABLE OPTION THEN    

01:32:39.432 --> 01:32:40.131
THAT CHOICE FOR SELECTING A     
MORE SUSTAINABLE OPTION THEN    
THEY WANT TO HAVE EVENTUALLY

01:32:42.736 --> 01:32:43.801
THEY WANT TO HAVE EVENTUALLY    
WORKING TOWARDS A LABELING      
SYSTEM SO PEOPLE CAN START TO   

01:32:43.803 --> 01:32:44.602
WORKING TOWARDS A LABELING      
SYSTEM SO PEOPLE CAN START TO   
UNDERSTAND BOGOSITY FACILITIES  

01:32:44.604 --> 01:32:46.270
SYSTEM SO PEOPLE CAN START TO   
UNDERSTAND BOGOSITY FACILITIES  
AND WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS 

01:32:46.272 --> 01:32:47.005
