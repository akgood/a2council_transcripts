CROSSWALK SIGNS.                

00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:26.481
THE CITY HAS INSTALLED SCHOOL   
CROSSWALK SIGNS.                
SO REGARDLESS WHAT WE WANT TO   

00:11:26.483 --> 00:11:27.348
CROSSWALK SIGNS.                
SO REGARDLESS WHAT WE WANT TO   
SAY ABOUT THIS UNLESS THE CITY  

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.151
SO REGARDLESS WHAT WE WANT TO   
SAY ABOUT THIS UNLESS THE CITY  
TAKES OUT ALL THESE CROSSWALK   

00:11:30.153 --> 00:11:30.952
SAY ABOUT THIS UNLESS THE CITY  
TAKES OUT ALL THESE CROSSWALK   
SIGNS, THEY DID TAKE TWO        

00:11:30.954 --> 00:11:33.588
TAKES OUT ALL THESE CROSSWALK   
SIGNS, THEY DID TAKE TWO        
OF THEM DOWN.                   

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.755
SIGNS, THEY DID TAKE TWO        
OF THEM DOWN.                   
BUT I THINK THAT IF THEY TOOK   

00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:35.390
OF THEM DOWN.                   
BUT I THINK THAT IF THEY TOOK   
THE REST OF THEM DOWN WHEN      

00:11:35.392 --> 00:11:37.392
BUT I THINK THAT IF THEY TOOK   
THE REST OF THEM DOWN WHEN      
STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY WALKING   

00:11:37.394 --> 00:11:38.459
THE REST OF THEM DOWN WHEN

ON THESE CROSSWALKS, IT WOULD   
BE MEAN SPIRITED.               
SO ANYWAY, REGARDING THE        

00:11:44.567 --> 00:11:45.366
BE MEAN SPIRITED.               
SO ANYWAY, REGARDING THE        
RESOLUTION TO HAVE BUSINESSES   

00:11:45.368 --> 00:11:49.103
SO ANYWAY, REGARDING THE        
RESOLUTION TO HAVE BUSINESSES   
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, I THINK    

00:11:49.105 --> 00:11:49.904
RESOLUTION TO HAVE BUSINESSES   
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, I THINK    
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND I THINK  

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:50.571
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, I THINK    
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND I THINK  
IT REFLECTS WHAT'S ALREADY      

00:11:50.573 --> 00:11:53.040
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND I THINK  
IT REFLECTS WHAT'S ALREADY      
BEING DONE IN SOME CASES.       

00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:54.041
IT REFLECTS WHAT'S ALREADY      
BEING DONE IN SOME CASES.       
HOWEVER, IF WE'RE GOING TO DO   

00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:57.111

HOWEVER, IF WE'RE GOING TO DO   
THAT, WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

00:58:32.072 --> 00:58:35.039
IT'S EASY TO BE WORRIED ABOUT   
NEW HOMES COMING IN AND THAT    
CREATING TRAFFIC A NEW KRISPY   

00:58:35.041 --> 00:58:35.740
NEW HOMES COMING IN AND THAT    
CREATING TRAFFIC A NEW KRISPY   
KREME UNDER THE CURRENT ZONING  

00:58:35.742 --> 00:58:38.510
CREATING TRAFFIC A NEW KRISPY   
KREME UNDER THE CURRENT ZONING  
COULD BE BUILT IN THIS IN THIS

00:58:42.583 --> 00:58:43.248
MANY, MANY CARS AND ALL KINDS   
OF TRAFFIC AND THAT'S           
COMPLETELY ALLOWED THIS ONE

THAT WERE TESTED BY FIELD STAFF 
DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE TWO  

01:11:04.924 --> 01:11:05.656
THAT WERE TESTED BY FIELD STAFF 
DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE TWO  
TO THREE TIMES LESS EFFICIENT   

01:11:05.658 --> 01:11:08.226
DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE TWO  
TO THREE TIMES LESS EFFICIENT   
WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY       

01:11:08.228 --> 01:11:09.026
TO THREE TIMES LESS EFFICIENT   
WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY       
PROLONG THE BURN PREPARATION    

01:11:09.028 --> 01:11:11.696
WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

THE SITE FOR A BURN THAT DAY,   
THUS DECREASING THE TOTAL HOURS 
AVAILABLE IN A DAY TO BURN      

01:11:19.773 --> 01:11:23.407
THUS DECREASING THE TOTAL HOURS 
AVAILABLE IN A DAY TO BURN      
WHICH WOULD THEN NARROW IN THE  

01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:24.175
AVAILABLE IN A DAY TO BURN      
WHICH WOULD THEN NARROW IN THE  
TARGET OF ONE HUNDRED ACRES

FIRE WE ARE GOING OUT TO THE    
CITY'S PARKS EARLY IN THE       

01:12:33.112 --> 01:12:36.314
FIRE WE ARE GOING OUT TO THE    
CITY'S PARKS EARLY IN THE       
MORNING FLAGGING A BURN UNIT.   

01:12:36.316 --> 01:12:39.850
CITY'S PARKS EARLY IN THE       
MORNING FLAGGING A BURN UNIT.   
THOSE UNITS VARY IN SIZE COULD  

01:12:39.852 --> 01:12:40.584
MORNING FLAGGING A BURN UNIT.   
THOSE UNITS VARY IN SIZE COULD  
BE LESS THAN AN ACRE.           

01:12:40.586 --> 01:12:41.752
THOSE UNITS VARY IN SIZE COULD  
BE LESS THAN AN ACRE.           
IT CAN BE AS MUCH AS FIVE OR    

01:12:41.754 --> 01:12:44.187
BE LESS THAN AN ACRE.           
IT CAN BE AS MUCH AS FIVE OR    
MORE ACRES IN SIZE.             

01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:45.022
IT CAN BE AS MUCH AS FIVE OR    
MORE ACRES IN SIZE.             
>> AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE        

01:12:45.024 --> 01:12:47.691
MORE ACRES IN SIZE.             
>> AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE        
FLAGGED THAT UNIT WE USE        

01:12:47.693 --> 01:12:48.725
>> AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE        
FLAGGED THAT UNIT WE USE        
BLOWERS TO BLOW A BURN BREAK    

01:12:48.727 --> 01:12:51.562
FLAGGED THAT UNIT WE USE        
BLOWERS TO BLOW A BURN BREAK    
WHICH IS A BREAK IN THE         

01:12:51.564 --> 01:12:52.263
BLOWERS TO BLOW A BURN BREAK    
WHICH IS A BREAK IN THE         
AVAILABLE FUEL OR THE LEAF      

01:12:52.265 --> 01:12:55.899
WHICH IS A BREAK IN THE         
AVAILABLE FUEL OR THE LEAF      
LITTER ON THE GROUND.           

01:12:55.901 --> 01:12:56.734
AVAILABLE FUEL OR THE LEAF      
LITTER ON THE GROUND.           
THE DEBRIS THAT IS BURNED AND   

01:12:56.736 --> 01:12:57.468
LITTER ON THE GROUND.           
THE DEBRIS THAT IS BURNED AND   
CARRIES THE BURN THROUGHOUT THE 

01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:59.136
THE DEBRIS THAT IS BURNED AND   
CARRIES THE BURN THROUGHOUT THE 
UNIT.                           

01:12:59.138 --> 01:13:00.270
CARRIES THE BURN THROUGHOUT THE 
UNIT.                           
IT IS PARAMOUNT TO HAVE A BREAK 

01:13:00.272 --> 01:13:03.474
UNIT.                           
IT IS PARAMOUNT TO HAVE A BREAK 
AROUND THE BURN UNIT SO THAT    

01:13:03.476 --> 01:13:04.275
IT IS PARAMOUNT TO HAVE A BREAK 
AROUND THE BURN UNIT SO THAT    
THE BURN DOES NOT SPREAD BEYOND 

01:13:04.277 --> 01:13:06.843
AROUND THE BURN UNIT SO THAT    
THE BURN DOES NOT SPREAD BEYOND 
THAT BREAK.                     

01:13:06.845 --> 01:13:10.614
THE BURN DOES NOT SPREAD BEYOND 
THAT BREAK.                     
AND SO WITH THE BLOWERS WE ARE  

01:13:10.616 --> 01:13:11.382
THAT BREAK.                     
AND SO WITH THE BLOWERS WE ARE  
CREATING THAT PERIMETER FOR     

01:13:11.384 --> 01:13:14.384
AND SO WITH THE BLOWERS WE ARE  
CREATING THAT PERIMETER FOR     
SAFETY PURPOSES AROUND THE UNIT 

01:13:14.386 --> 01:13:17.888
CREATING THAT PERIMETER FOR     
SAFETY PURPOSES AROUND THE UNIT 
AND IT TAKES CURRENTLY HOURS    

01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:18.890
SAFETY PURPOSES AROUND THE UNIT 
AND IT TAKES CURRENTLY HOURS    
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE    

01:13:18.892 --> 01:13:22.560
AND IT TAKES CURRENTLY HOURS    
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE    
UNIT BUT WHAT WE WOULD STAND TO 

01:13:22.562 --> 01:13:26.130
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE    
UNIT BUT WHAT WE WOULD STAND TO 
ADD EVEN MORE HOURS DOUBLE OR   

01:13:26.132 --> 01:13:26.930
UNIT BUT WHAT WE WOULD STAND TO

SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS 

01:22:18.196 --> 01:22:19.996

SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS 
THAT INCREASE THE HEIGHT OF A   

01:22:19.998 --> 01:22:20.597
SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS 
THAT INCREASE THE HEIGHT OF A   
BUILDING WITHOUT PROVIDING      

01:22:20.599 --> 01:22:23.299
THAT INCREASE THE HEIGHT OF A   
BUILDING WITHOUT PROVIDING      
ADDITIONAL INHABITABLE SPACE    

01:22:23.301 --> 01:22:24.134
BUILDING WITHOUT PROVIDING      
ADDITIONAL INHABITABLE SPACE

01:22:32.711 --> 01:22:35.612
BUILDING.                       
SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT        
BUILDINGS IN MIXED USE          

01:22:35.614 --> 01:22:36.213
SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT
