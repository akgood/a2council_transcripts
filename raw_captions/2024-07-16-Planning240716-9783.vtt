WE MAY DO A ROOFTOP UNIT FOR    

00:12:50.414 --> 00:12:51.013
ELECTRIC BUILDING.              
WE MAY DO A ROOFTOP UNIT FOR

BECAUSE THE COMMON AREAS        
REQUIRE MUCH MORE FRESH AIR AND 

00:12:54.319 --> 00:12:55.118
BECAUSE THE COMMON AREAS

THERE'D BE TOO MUCH IMPACT TO

00:39:08.024 --> 00:39:10.358
THERE'D BE TOO MUCH IMPACT TO

IT WOULD TRIGGER ANOTHER SITE

IT WOULD TRIGGER ANOTHER SITE   
PLAN AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT 
WE WOULD ALLOW THAT THAT IMPACT

WE WOULD ALLOW THAT THAT IMPACT 
TO THAT WETLAND FOR SOLAR       

00:39:14.998 --> 00:39:15.396
WE WOULD ALLOW THAT THAT IMPACT 
TO THAT WETLAND FOR SOLAR

I WILL BE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW 
THAT WORKS BECAUSE I AM A       
LITTLE NERVOUS OF SAYING YEAH   

01:24:41.355 --> 01:24:43.688
THAT WORKS BECAUSE I AM A       
LITTLE NERVOUS OF SAYING YEAH   
YOU DON'T NEED TO MATCH ANY     

01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:44.022
LITTLE NERVOUS OF SAYING YEAH   
YOU DON'T NEED TO MATCH ANY     
OF IT.                          

01:24:44.024 --> 01:24:47.558
YOU DON'T NEED TO MATCH ANY     
OF IT.                          
IT'S YOU KNOW I I I'M A LITTLE  

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.259
OF IT.                          
IT'S YOU KNOW I I I'M A LITTLE  
NERVOUS ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK  

01:24:48.261 --> 01:24:50.929
IT'S YOU KNOW I I I'M A LITTLE  
NERVOUS ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK  
IT DOES MAKE SENSE.             

01:24:50.931 --> 01:24:51.929
NERVOUS ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK  
IT DOES MAKE SENSE.             
I DON'T KNOW THAT SEVENTY       

01:24:51.931 --> 01:24:52.597
IT DOES MAKE SENSE.             
I DON'T KNOW THAT SEVENTY       
PERCENT IS SOMETHING THAT WE    

01:24:52.599 --> 01:24:55.633
I DON'T KNOW THAT SEVENTY       
PERCENT IS SOMETHING THAT WE    
NEED TO CODIFY BUT THAT IS THAT 

01:24:55.635 --> 01:24:59.037
PERCENT IS SOMETHING THAT WE    
NEED TO CODIFY BUT THAT IS THAT 
IS ONE WHERE I UNDERSTAND WHY   

01:24:59.039 --> 01:25:00.105
NEED TO CODIFY BUT THAT IS THAT 
IS ONE WHERE I UNDERSTAND WHY   
WE PUT IT IN INITIALLY AND I AM 

01:25:00.107 --> 01:25:03.408
IS ONE WHERE I UNDERSTAND WHY   
WE PUT IT IN INITIALLY AND I AM 
A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT REMOVING 

01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:06.812
WE PUT IT IN INITIALLY AND I AM 
A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT REMOVING 
IT ENTIRELY BUT I DON'T I'M NOT 

01:25:06.814 --> 01:25:07.746
A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT REMOVING 
IT ENTIRELY BUT I DON'T I'M NOT 
GOING TO SAY WELL SIXTY SEVEN   

01:25:07.748 --> 01:25:08.280
IT ENTIRELY BUT I DON'T I'M NOT 
GOING TO SAY WELL SIXTY SEVEN   
PERCENT IS BETTER.              

01:25:08.282 --> 01:25:11.683
GOING TO SAY WELL SIXTY SEVEN   
PERCENT IS BETTER.              
SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK WE KNOW 

01:25:11.685 --> 01:25:12.150
PERCENT IS BETTER.              
SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK WE KNOW 
A BETTER NUMBER.                

01:25:12.152 --> 01:25:13.017
SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK WE KNOW 
A BETTER NUMBER.                
SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO    

01:25:13.019 --> 01:25:13.585
A BETTER NUMBER.                
SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO    
REMOVE AT THIS POINT.           

01:25:13.587 --> 01:25:22.994
SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO    
REMOVE AT THIS POINT.           
BUT COMMISSIONER ADAMS          

01:25:37.877 --> 01:25:40.144
                      , AS WE   
WERE GOING THROUGH THE EXAMPLES 
AND I WAS ONE OF THE ONES AT    

01:25:40.146 --> 01:25:40.879
WERE GOING THROUGH THE EXAMPLES 
AND I WAS ONE OF THE ONES AT    
THE EARLIER SESSION THAT WAS    

01:25:40.881 --> 01:25:41.546
AND I WAS ONE OF THE ONES AT    
THE EARLIER SESSION THAT WAS    
PRETTY INSISTENT WE NEEDED TO   

01:25:41.548 --> 01:25:42.214
THE EARLIER SESSION THAT WAS    
PRETTY INSISTENT WE NEEDED TO   
MAINTAIN THE FRONT EDGE.        

01:25:42.216 --> 01:25:42.947
PRETTY INSISTENT WE NEEDED TO   
MAINTAIN THE FRONT EDGE.        
IT STRUCK ME THAT IT MATTERED   

01:25:42.949 --> 01:25:43.548
MAINTAIN THE FRONT EDGE.        
IT STRUCK ME THAT IT MATTERED   
MORE THE TYPE OF FRONTAGE       

01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:44.215
IT STRUCK ME THAT IT MATTERED   
MORE THE TYPE OF FRONTAGE       
RATHER THAN THE PERCENTAGE.     

01:25:44.217 --> 01:25:44.949
MORE THE TYPE OF FRONTAGE       
RATHER THAN THE PERCENTAGE.     
RIGHT THAT AND AS I'M GOING     

01:25:44.951 --> 01:25:45.683
RATHER THAN THE PERCENTAGE.     
RIGHT THAT AND AS I'M GOING     
THROUGH THE TISSUE ONE DISTRICT 

01:25:45.685 --> 01:25:46.485
RIGHT THAT AND AS I'M GOING     
THROUGH THE TISSUE ONE DISTRICT 
REQUIREMENTS, I THINK THE OTHER 

01:25:46.487 --> 01:25:47.085
THROUGH THE TISSUE ONE DISTRICT 
REQUIREMENTS, I THINK THE OTHER 
REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO DO    

01:25:47.087 --> 01:25:47.885
REQUIREMENTS, I THINK THE OTHER 
REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO DO    
MORE THE LIFTING THERE THAN THE 

01:25:47.887 --> 01:25:48.153
REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO DO    
MORE THE LIFTING THERE THAN THE 
PERCENT.                        

01:25:48.155 --> 01:25:48.953
MORE THE LIFTING THERE THAN THE 
PERCENT.                        
SO THAT THAT I THINK YOU MADE   

01:25:48.955 --> 01:25:49.654

THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR    

01:48:52.437 --> 01:48:54.437
IT THIS WAY FOR I GUESS FOR     
THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR    
THE TIME BEING I THINK IT DOES

THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR    
THE TIME BEING I THINK IT DOES  
MAKE SENSE IF YOU'RE WILLING TO

THE TIME BEING I THINK IT DOES  
MAKE SENSE IF YOU'RE WILLING TO

I THINK IN THE PAST WE HAD      

01:48:56.708 --> 01:48:58.275
SERVE IN THAT ROLE.             
I THINK IN THE PAST WE HAD      
DISCUSSED THAT COMMISSIONER     

01:48:58.277 --> 01:48:59.476
I THINK IN THE PAST WE HAD      
DISCUSSED THAT COMMISSIONER     
BRANDELL AT THE TIME ALSO HAD A 

01:48:59.478 --> 01:49:02.612
DISCUSSED THAT COMMISSIONER     
BRANDELL AT THE TIME ALSO HAD A 
PARTICULAR AREA OF EXPERTIZE    

01:49:02.614 --> 01:49:03.013
BRANDELL AT THE TIME ALSO HAD A 
PARTICULAR AREA OF EXPERTIZE    
AROUND THAT.                    

01:49:03.015 --> 01:49:06.016
PARTICULAR AREA OF EXPERTIZE    
AROUND THAT.                    
SO I THINK THAT THERE WAS SOME  

01:49:06.018 --> 01:49:07.284
AROUND THAT.                    
SO I THINK THAT THERE WAS SOME  
THAT WAS A FACTOR AND HAVING A  

01:49:07.286 --> 01:49:08.051
SO I THINK THAT THERE WAS SOME  
THAT WAS A FACTOR AND HAVING A  
COUPLE OF REPRESENTATIVES AT    

01:49:08.053 --> 01:49:08.384
THAT WAS A FACTOR AND HAVING A  
COUPLE OF REPRESENTATIVES AT
