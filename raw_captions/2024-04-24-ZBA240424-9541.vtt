ORDINANCES TO PRETTY MUCH       
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHEN THEY

ORDINANCES TO PRETTY MUCH       
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHEN THEY  
VIEW THESE FRONT YARDS AS

MULTIPLE FRONT YARDS, IT'S TO   
PRESERVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD.      

00:40:53.237 --> 00:40:57.073
MULTIPLE FRONT YARDS, IT'S TO   
PRESERVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD.      
IT'S FOR A LOT OF TIMES RIGHT   

00:40:57.075 --> 00:40:57.940
PRESERVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD.      
IT'S FOR A LOT OF TIMES RIGHT   
AWAY FOR ROADS TO MAKE SURE     

00:40:57.942 --> 00:41:01.343
IT'S FOR A LOT OF TIMES RIGHT   
AWAY FOR ROADS TO MAKE SURE     
THERE'S NO OBSTRUCTIONS.        

00:41:01.345 --> 00:41:02.277
AWAY FOR ROADS TO MAKE SURE     
THERE'S NO OBSTRUCTIONS.        
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE  

00:41:02.279 --> 00:41:03.278
THERE'S NO OBSTRUCTIONS.        
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE  
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE ESTHETIC IS 

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.980
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE  
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE ESTHETIC IS 
MAINTAINED, WHICH IS WHY THEY   

00:41:04.982 --> 00:41:05.647
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE ESTHETIC IS 
MAINTAINED, WHICH IS WHY THEY   
WRITE OUT THAT THERE'S ANYTIME  

00:41:05.649 --> 00:41:08.550
MAINTAINED, WHICH IS WHY THEY   
WRITE OUT THAT THERE'S ANYTIME  
THERE'S A STREET RACING ANY     

00:41:08.552 --> 00:41:12.187
WRITE OUT THAT THERE'S ANYTIME  
THERE'S A STREET RACING ANY     
PART OF THE HOME THAT'S FACING  

00:41:12.189 --> 00:41:16.425
THERE'S A STREET RACING ANY     
PART OF THE HOME THAT'S FACING  
THE FRONT YARD SO I THINK THAT  

00:41:16.427 --> 00:41:17.159
PART OF THE HOME THAT'S FACING  
THE FRONT YARD SO I THINK THAT  
THE BANKS ARE EXTRAORDINARY     

00:41:17.161 --> 00:41:20.662
THE FRONT YARD SO I THINK THAT  
THE BANKS ARE EXTRAORDINARY     
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE OR   

00:41:20.664 --> 00:41:21.363
THE BANKS ARE EXTRAORDINARY     
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE OR   
THAT IT IS HEAVILY WOODED       

00:41:21.365 --> 00:41:21.964
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE OR   
THAT IT IS HEAVILY WOODED       
OBVIOUSLY IN SOME OF THESE      

00:41:21.966 --> 00:41:24.366
THAT IT IS HEAVILY WOODED       
OBVIOUSLY IN SOME OF THESE      
PICTURES HERE.                  

00:41:24.368 --> 00:41:25.334
OBVIOUSLY IN SOME OF THESE      
PICTURES HERE.                  
YOU KNOW, THERE'S FOLIAGE       

00:41:25.336 --> 00:41:26.001
PICTURES HERE.                  
YOU KNOW, THERE'S FOLIAGE       
THAT'S LOST DURING THE WINTER   

00:41:26.003 --> 00:41:28.870
YOU KNOW, THERE'S FOLIAGE       
THAT'S LOST DURING THE WINTER   
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE    

00:41:28.872 --> 00:41:31.706
THAT'S LOST DURING THE WINTER   
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE    
VIEWS OBSTRUCTED AS IT BY       

00:41:31.708 --> 00:41:32.207
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE    
VIEWS OBSTRUCTED AS IT BY       
NATURAL FOLIAGE.                

00:41:32.209 --> 00:41:35.110
VIEWS OBSTRUCTED AS IT BY       
NATURAL FOLIAGE.                
SO I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S   

00:41:35.112 --> 00:41:36.044
NATURAL FOLIAGE.                
SO I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S   
ANY FURTHER HINDRANCE FROM THAT 

00:41:36.046 --> 00:41:36.711
SO I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S   
ANY FURTHER HINDRANCE FROM THAT 
AND I THINK THERE WOULD BE      

00:41:36.713 --> 00:41:39.715
ANY FURTHER HINDRANCE FROM THAT 
AND I THINK THERE WOULD BE      
GRANTED TO APPLICANTS BASICALLY 

00:41:39.717 --> 00:41:40.448
AND I THINK THERE WOULD BE      
GRANTED TO APPLICANTS BASICALLY 
THE SAME SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE    

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.183
GRANTED TO APPLICANTS BASICALLY

THE SAME SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE    
THAT ANY OTHER PROPERTY OWNER   
WOULD HAVE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE

THAT ANY OTHER PROPERTY OWNER   
WOULD HAVE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE  
THREE FRONT YARDS.              

00:41:44.322 --> 00:41:47.490
WOULD HAVE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE  
THREE FRONT YARDS.              
I THINK IT MEETS OUR CRITERIA   

00:41:47.492 --> 00:41:49.958
THREE FRONT YARDS.

THE SIDE?                       
WHAT I SEE A STATEMENT HERE     
REGARDING THE FENCE FACING HILL 

00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:25.260
WHAT I SEE A STATEMENT HERE     
REGARDING THE FENCE FACING HILL 
THAT'S BEYOND BEHIND SOME       

00:42:25.262 --> 00:42:25.660
REGARDING THE FENCE FACING HILL 
THAT'S BEYOND BEHIND SOME       
LANDSCAPE.                      

00:42:25.662 --> 00:42:29.198
THAT'S BEYOND BEHIND SOME       
LANDSCAPE.                      
SO IT'S IT'S STREET SOMEONE     

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.301
LANDSCAPE.                      
SO IT'S IT'S STREET SOMEONE     
LANDSCAPE AND THEN A FENCE.     

00:42:33.303 --> 00:42:34.136
SO IT'S IT'S STREET SOMEONE     
LANDSCAPE AND THEN A FENCE.     
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES      

00:42:34.138 --> 00:42:34.770
LANDSCAPE AND THEN A FENCE.     
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES      
REALLY UNIQUE THE SHAPE OF A    

00:42:34.772 --> 00:42:35.037
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES      
REALLY UNIQUE THE SHAPE OF A    
LOT.                            

00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:37.539
REALLY UNIQUE THE SHAPE OF A    
LOT.                            
SO BECAUSE IT'S ANGLED YOU'RE   

00:42:37.541 --> 00:42:38.573
LOT.                            
SO BECAUSE IT'S ANGLED YOU'RE   
STILL GETTING A LOT AND WE HAD  

00:42:38.575 --> 00:42:39.241
SO BECAUSE IT'S ANGLED YOU'RE   
STILL GETTING A LOT AND WE HAD  
A SOUND ENGINEER COME OUT AND   

00:42:39.243 --> 00:42:41.676
STILL GETTING A LOT AND WE HAD  
A SOUND ENGINEER COME OUT AND   
MEASURE IT TO DO A BUNCH        

00:42:41.678 --> 00:42:42.377
A SOUND ENGINEER COME OUT AND   
MEASURE IT TO DO A BUNCH        
OF TESTS AND EVERYTHING BUT     

00:42:42.379 --> 00:42:43.111
MEASURE IT TO DO A BUNCH        
OF TESTS AND EVERYTHING BUT     
DRILLING THE ANGLE A LOT WELL   

00:42:43.113 --> 00:42:45.814
OF TESTS AND EVERYTHING BUT     
DRILLING THE ANGLE A LOT WELL   
AT THE LAST POSITION ON THAT    

00:42:45.816 --> 00:42:46.548
DRILLING THE ANGLE A LOT WELL   
AT THE LAST POSITION ON THAT    
CORNER BECAUSE IT'S STILL       

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.584
AT THE LAST POSITION ON THAT    
CORNER BECAUSE IT'S STILL       
ABSORBING A TON OF SOUND FROM   

00:42:49.586 --> 00:42:50.486
CORNER BECAUSE IT'S STILL       
ABSORBING A TON OF SOUND FROM   
THE ROAD AND REALLY THE INTENT  

00:42:50.488 --> 00:42:51.353
ABSORBING A TON OF SOUND FROM   
THE ROAD AND REALLY THE INTENT  
OF THIS IS TO TRY TO BLOCK OUT  

00:42:51.355 --> 00:42:51.554
THE ROAD AND REALLY THE INTENT  
OF THIS IS TO TRY TO BLOCK OUT  
SOME.                           

00:42:51.556 --> 00:42:53.088
OF THIS IS TO TRY TO BLOCK OUT  
SOME.                           
BUT IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT VIEW  

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:53.822
SOME.                           
BUT IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT VIEW  
THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN ISSUE IS 

00:42:53.824 --> 00:42:56.992
BUT IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT VIEW  
THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN ISSUE IS 
THE ANGLE ON A LOT OF THE       

00:42:56.994 --> 00:43:00.862
THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN ISSUE IS 
THE ANGLE ON A LOT OF THE       
VARIANCE WOULD EXTEND THE       

00:43:00.864 --> 00:43:01.864
THE ANGLE ON A LOT OF THE       
VARIANCE WOULD EXTEND THE       
ENTIRE LOT WITH FROM HILL TO    

00:43:01.866 --> 00:43:05.166
VARIANCE WOULD EXTEND THE       
ENTIRE LOT WITH FROM HILL TO    
ABRAN THE THE VARIANCE WOULD    

00:43:05.168 --> 00:43:09.337
ENTIRE LOT WITH FROM HILL TO    
ABRAN THE THE VARIANCE WOULD    
ALLOW TO BUILD A FENCE AND WHAT 

00:43:09.339 --> 00:43:12.641
ABRAN THE THE VARIANCE WOULD    
ALLOW TO BUILD A FENCE AND WHAT 
FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES IS A 

00:43:12.643 --> 00:43:13.508
ALLOW TO BUILD A FENCE AND WHAT 
FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES IS A 
BACKYARD AND I UNDERSTAND THE   

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.212
FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES IS A 
BACKYARD AND I UNDERSTAND THE   
ZONING ORDINANCE VIEWS IT       

00:43:16.214 --> 00:43:17.012
BACKYARD AND I UNDERSTAND THE   
ZONING ORDINANCE VIEWS IT       
DIFFERENTLY BUT IT IS A         

00:43:17.014 --> 00:43:20.482
ZONING ORDINANCE VIEWS IT       
DIFFERENTLY BUT IT IS A         
BACKYARD AND WHEN YOU SEE THESE 

00:43:20.484 --> 00:43:23.619
DIFFERENTLY BUT IT IS A         
BACKYARD AND WHEN YOU SEE THESE 
PICTURES THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE.

PRACTICAL MATTERS.              
OH THAT HAS TO DO WITH

THAT THE FOLIAGE IS THERE       
ALREADY IS SCREENING NOT IN THE 

00:43:46.143 --> 00:43:50.546
THAT THE FOLIAGE IS THERE       
ALREADY IS SCREENING NOT IN THE 
WINTER BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED  

00:43:50.548 --> 00:43:51.013
ALREADY IS SCREENING NOT IN THE 
WINTER BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED  
EVERGREEN?

BEING COMPLIANT WITH THE        
INTENDED USE SO SO YOU ARE      
GOING TO DO THE PROVIDING RFID  

00:44:02.593 --> 00:44:04.960
INTENDED USE SO SO YOU ARE      
GOING TO DO THE PROVIDING RFID  
AS WELL.                        

00:44:04.962 --> 00:44:05.960
GOING TO DO THE PROVIDING RFID  
AS WELL.                        
THE PROBLEM IS NOT PROVIDING AS 

00:44:05.962 --> 00:44:06.695
AS WELL.                        
THE PROBLEM IS NOT PROVIDING AS 
PER THE SOUND ENGINEER THAT WE

THE PROBLEM IS NOT PROVIDING AS 
PER THE SOUND ENGINEER THAT WE  
RETAIN IS NOT GOING TO BE LIKE

DIFFICULT TOPOGRAPHY ON THE     
OTHER SIDE.                     

01:16:03.111 --> 01:16:04.010
DIFFICULT TOPOGRAPHY ON THE

THAT WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS    

01:16:04.012 --> 01:16:07.781

01:16:07.783 --> 01:16:09.983
THAT WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS    
THAT I HAD UM THAT IT CAN'T GO  
TO THE OTHER SIDE DRIVEWAY SO   

01:16:09.985 --> 01:16:10.717
THAT I HAD UM THAT IT CAN'T GO  
TO THE OTHER SIDE DRIVEWAY SO   
THERE'S THE TOPOGRAPHY ON THAT  

01:16:10.719 --> 01:16:14.254
TO THE OTHER SIDE DRIVEWAY SO   
THERE'S THE TOPOGRAPHY ON THAT  
SIDE AND THEN THAT ANGLED SHAPE 

01:16:14.256 --> 01:16:15.122
THERE'S THE TOPOGRAPHY ON THAT  
SIDE AND THEN THAT ANGLED SHAPE 
OF THE LOT IN THE BACK.         

01:16:15.124 --> 01:16:18.358
SIDE AND THEN THAT ANGLED SHAPE 
OF THE LOT IN THE BACK.         
I THINK FOR ME THAT IS A        

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.026
OF THE LOT IN THE BACK.         
I THINK FOR ME THAT IS A        
PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY HERE IS    

01:16:19.028 --> 01:16:22.528
I THINK FOR ME THAT IS A        
PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY HERE IS    
THAT SHE BECAUSE IF IT WERE     

01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:23.230
PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY HERE IS    
THAT SHE BECAUSE IF IT WERE     
JUST A RECTANGULAR LOT THEY     

01:16:23.232 --> 01:16:26.099
THAT SHE BECAUSE IF IT WERE     
JUST A RECTANGULAR LOT THEY     
WOULD THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ME  

01:16:26.101 --> 01:16:29.069
JUST A RECTANGULAR LOT THEY     
WOULD THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ME  
AND I'M JUST LOOKING AT AERIAL  

01:16:29.071 --> 01:16:29.869
WOULD THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ME  
AND I'M JUST LOOKING AT AERIAL  
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT LOOKS    

01:16:29.871 --> 01:16:33.806
AND I'M JUST LOOKING AT AERIAL  
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT LOOKS    
LIKE MOST OF THE HOUSES ON THAT 

01:16:33.808 --> 01:16:34.474
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT LOOKS    
LIKE MOST OF THE HOUSES ON THAT 
STREET ARE SET BACK PRETTY      

01:16:34.476 --> 01:16:37.176
LIKE MOST OF THE HOUSES ON THAT 
STREET ARE SET BACK PRETTY      
SIMILARLY TO THIS I REALIZED    

01:16:37.178 --> 01:16:37.944
STREET ARE SET BACK PRETTY      
SIMILARLY TO THIS I REALIZED    
THEY HAD SOME SPACE IN THE      

01:16:37.946 --> 01:16:41.514
SIMILARLY TO THIS I REALIZED    
THEY HAD SOME SPACE IN THE      
FRONT YARD BUT I THINK IT WOULD 

01:16:41.516 --> 01:16:42.448
THEY HAD SOME SPACE IN THE      
FRONT YARD BUT I THINK IT WOULD 
LOOK SILLY TO PUT A SUNROOM OUT 

01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:48.355
FRONT YARD BUT I THINK IT WOULD 
LOOK SILLY TO PUT A SUNROOM OUT 
THERE                           

01:17:02.237 --> 01:17:04.537
      FOR ONE.                  
AND ADDITIONALLY I THINK MOST   
OF THE HOUSES ON STREET LOOK    

01:17:04.539 --> 01:17:05.204
AND ADDITIONALLY I THINK MOST   
OF THE HOUSES ON STREET LOOK    
LIKE THEY'RE SET BACK ABOUT     

01:17:05.206 --> 01:17:05.939
OF THE HOUSES ON STREET LOOK    
LIKE THEY'RE SET BACK ABOUT     
THAT SAME DISTANCE FROM THE     

01:17:05.941 --> 01:17:06.273
LIKE THEY'RE SET BACK ABOUT     
THAT SAME DISTANCE FROM THE     
FROM THE HOME.                  

01:17:06.275 --> 01:17:07.007
THAT SAME DISTANCE FROM THE     
FROM THE HOME.                  
AND SO I THINK THAT ADDING      

01:17:07.009 --> 01:17:07.708
FROM THE HOME.                  
AND SO I THINK THAT ADDING      
SOMETHING DIFFERENT WOULD KIND  

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:08.575
AND SO I THINK THAT ADDING      
SOMETHING DIFFERENT WOULD KIND  
OF BE AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE 

01:17:08.577 --> 01:17:09.175
SOMETHING DIFFERENT WOULD KIND  
OF BE AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHAT THE       

01:17:09.177 --> 01:17:09.842
OF BE AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHAT THE       
NEIGHBORHOOD'S CHARACTER IS

THEY COULD DO SOMETHING WITH

THEY COULD DO SOMETHING WITH    
WRAPPING AROUND OR WITHOUT

THEY COULD DO SOMETHING WITH    
WRAPPING AROUND OR WITHOUT      
REQUIRING A VARIANCE BUT THEY   

01:17:12.915 --> 01:17:13.780
WRAPPING AROUND OR WITHOUT      
REQUIRING A VARIANCE BUT THEY   
CAN ONLY GO NINE FEET BACK FROM 

01:17:13.782 --> 01:17:14.514
REQUIRING A VARIANCE BUT THEY   
CAN ONLY GO NINE FEET BACK FROM 
THE HOUSE AND I DON'T REALLY    

01:17:14.516 --> 01:17:15.248
CAN ONLY GO NINE FEET BACK FROM 
THE HOUSE AND I DON'T REALLY    
FEEL LIKE THAT'S A TON OF SPACE

FEEL LIKE THAT'S A TON OF SPACE

WHICH IS WHAT IS THE PURPOSE    
OF THE GIVEN SET BACK DISTANCE  

01:20:28.577 --> 01:20:29.442
WHICH IS WHAT IS THE PURPOSE    
OF THE GIVEN SET BACK DISTANCE  
SO FORTY FEET VERSUS THIRTY     

01:20:29.444 --> 01:20:30.243

DIFFERENT SET BACK REQUIREMENT  

01:20:36.518 --> 01:20:37.450

02:51:18.621 --> 02:51:19.687
BUILT INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THE

SO IT WAS DESIGNED AROUND THE   

02:51:19.689 --> 02:51:22.856
EXISTING BUILDINGS.             
SO IT WAS DESIGNED AROUND THE   
EXISTING STEEL AND COLUMNS AND  

02:51:22.858 --> 02:51:23.557
SO IT WAS DESIGNED AROUND THE   
EXISTING STEEL AND COLUMNS AND  
SUPPORTS THAT THE BUILDING HAS  

02:51:23.559 --> 02:51:26.126
EXISTING STEEL AND COLUMNS AND  
SUPPORTS THAT THE BUILDING HAS  
IT'S LITERALLY JUST A SPACE

THAT'S PUT ONTO THE STRUCTURE.  
WE ONLY OPENED UP THE BUILDING  
AS MUCH AS WE NEEDED TO FOR
