00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.474
SOME HAVE EVEN DIED.

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:42.979
FINDING PATHWAYS TO BOTH CLEAN  
OUR ELECTRICITY GRID AND        
SUPPORT THE TRANSITION AWAY     

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:46.115
OUR ELECTRICITY GRID AND        
SUPPORT THE TRANSITION AWAY     
FROM THE USE OF FOSSIL GAS      

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.017
SUPPORT THE TRANSITION AWAY     
FROM THE USE OF FOSSIL GAS      
WHICH WE USE AGAIN FOR HEATING  

00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:47.817
FROM THE USE OF FOSSIL GAS      
WHICH WE USE AGAIN FOR HEATING

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:50.687
WHICH WE USE AGAIN FOR HEATING  
AND COOLING AND SWITCHING THAT  
TO ELECTRICITY SO WE KNOW THAT  

00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:53.723
AND COOLING AND SWITCHING THAT  
TO ELECTRICITY SO WE KNOW THAT  
WE NEED TO PROVIDE RENEWABLE    

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:54.391
TO ELECTRICITY SO WE KNOW THAT  
WE NEED TO PROVIDE RENEWABLE    
ENERGY TO ADDRESS THESE         

00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:54.725
WE NEED TO PROVIDE RENEWABLE    
ENERGY TO ADDRESS THESE         
EMISSIONS.                      

00:29:54.727 --> 00:29:57.827
ENERGY TO ADDRESS THESE         
EMISSIONS.                      
I ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU WHERE   

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:58.328
EMISSIONS.                      
I ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU WHERE   
WE&amp;apos;RE STARTING FROM.            

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.331
I ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU WHERE   
WE&amp;apos;RE STARTING FROM.            
SO THIS IS OUR CURRENT FUEL MIX 

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:06.236
WE&amp;apos;RE STARTING FROM.            
SO THIS IS OUR CURRENT FUEL MIX 
LOCALLY FROM FROM DG AND I      

00:30:06.238 --> 00:30:07.170
SO THIS IS OUR CURRENT FUEL MIX 
LOCALLY FROM FROM DG AND I      
COULD INCLUDE IT IN HERE LOCAL  

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:10.073
LOCALLY FROM FROM DG AND I      
COULD INCLUDE IT IN HERE LOCAL  
SOLAR.                          

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:11.107
COULD INCLUDE IT IN HERE LOCAL  
SOLAR.                          
SO RECENTLY WE WERE SEEING A    

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:11.708
SOLAR.                          
SO RECENTLY WE WERE SEEING A    
GROUNDSWELL IN ADOPTION         

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:12.042
SO RECENTLY WE WERE SEEING A    
GROUNDSWELL IN ADOPTION         
OF SOLAR.                       

00:30:12.044 --> 00:30:14.411
GROUNDSWELL IN ADOPTION         
OF SOLAR.                       
OUR GROUP PROGRAM SOLAR ARRAYS. 

00:30:14.413 --> 00:30:16.946
OF SOLAR.                       
OUR GROUP PROGRAM SOLAR ARRAYS. 
AND JUST TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT 

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:18.015
OUR GROUP PROGRAM SOLAR ARRAYS. 
AND JUST TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT 
IN ANN ARBOR THAT&amp;apos;S STILL LESS  

00:30:18.017 --> 00:30:21.017
AND JUST TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT 
IN ANN ARBOR THAT&amp;apos;S STILL LESS  
THAN HALF OF A PERCENT OF TOTAL 

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:21.485
IN ANN ARBOR THAT&amp;apos;S STILL LESS  
THAN HALF OF A PERCENT OF TOTAL 
ELECTRICITY USE.                

00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:22.685
THAN HALF OF A PERCENT OF TOTAL 
ELECTRICITY USE.                
AND SO TODAY I&amp;apos;M GOING TO TALK  

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:25.722
ELECTRICITY USE.                
AND SO TODAY I&amp;apos;M GOING TO TALK  
ABOUT A WAY THAT WE CAN UNLOCK  

00:30:25.724 --> 00:30:29.059
AND SO TODAY I&amp;apos;M GOING TO TALK  
ABOUT A WAY THAT WE CAN UNLOCK  
A MUCH HIGHER ADOPTION OF LOCAL 

00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:29.793
ABOUT A WAY THAT WE CAN UNLOCK  
A MUCH HIGHER ADOPTION OF LOCAL 
CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY.     

00:30:29.795 --> 00:30:33.263
A MUCH HIGHER ADOPTION OF LOCAL 
CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS CHART SHOWS THE LOW  

00:30:33.265 --> 00:30:35.966
CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS CHART SHOWS THE LOW  
AND HIGH ESTIMATED SOLAR IMPACT 

00:30:35.968 --> 00:30:36.833
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS CHART SHOWS THE LOW  
AND HIGH ESTIMATED SOLAR IMPACT 
SOLAR CAPACITY UNLOCKED BY THE  

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:40.136
AND HIGH ESTIMATED SOLAR IMPACT 
SOLAR CAPACITY UNLOCKED BY THE  
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY UTILITY.     

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:44.207
SOLAR CAPACITY UNLOCKED BY THE  
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY UTILITY.     
SO AS WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO       

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:45.141
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY UTILITY.     
SO AS WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO       
IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY AND THE 

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:48.211
SO AS WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO       
IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY AND THE 
FUEL MIX OF OUR ENERGY SUPPLY,  

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.011
IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY AND THE 
FUEL MIX OF OUR ENERGY SUPPLY,  
IT&amp;apos;S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND    

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:49.612
FUEL MIX OF OUR ENERGY SUPPLY,  
IT&amp;apos;S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND    
THE ENERGY LANDSCAPE IN         

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:51.815
IT&amp;apos;S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND    
THE ENERGY LANDSCAPE IN         
MICHIGAN AND IOWA HAS WHAT IS   

00:30:51.817 --> 00:30:52.682
THE ENERGY LANDSCAPE IN         
MICHIGAN AND IOWA HAS WHAT IS   
KNOWN AS A PRE FOOT ACT         

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.785
MICHIGAN AND IOWA HAS WHAT IS   
KNOWN AS A PRE FOOT ACT         
FRANCHISE WHICH MEANS THAT DD   

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:56.519

HOWEVER.                        
BUT FRANCHISES ARE NOT          
EXCLUSIVE AND SO THE MICHIGAN   

00:31:03.929 --> 00:31:04.628
BUT FRANCHISES ARE NOT          
EXCLUSIVE AND SO THE MICHIGAN   
CONSTITUTION PROTECTS THE RIGHT
