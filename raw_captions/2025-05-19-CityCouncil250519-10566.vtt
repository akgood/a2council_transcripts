02:24:50.704 --> 02:24:51.436
TURNED INTO PERMANENT           
INFRASTRUCTURE LATER AND STREET 
I THINK IS ONE LOCAL EXAMPLE    

02:24:51.438 --> 02:24:54.539
INFRASTRUCTURE LATER AND STREET 
I THINK IS ONE LOCAL EXAMPLE    
WHERE SOME QUICK BUILDS BUMP    

02:24:54.541 --> 02:24:55.340
I THINK IS ONE LOCAL EXAMPLE    
WHERE SOME QUICK BUILDS BUMP    
OUTS OUR STAFF IS PLANNING TO   

02:24:55.342 --> 02:24:58.543
WHERE SOME QUICK BUILDS BUMP    
OUTS OUR STAFF IS PLANNING TO   
MAKE THOSE INTO PERMANENT CURBS

OUTS OUR STAFF IS PLANNING TO   
MAKE THOSE INTO PERMANENT CURBS 
AS PART OF THAT ROAD PROJECT.   

02:24:59.345 --> 02:25:00.211
MAKE THOSE INTO PERMANENT CURBS 
AS PART OF THAT ROAD PROJECT.   
BUT AGAIN WE WERE ABLE TO       

02:25:00.213 --> 02:25:02.414
AS PART OF THAT ROAD PROJECT.   
BUT AGAIN WE WERE ABLE TO       
IMPLEMENT BUMP.                 

02:25:02.416 --> 02:25:03.448
BUT AGAIN WE WERE ABLE TO       
IMPLEMENT BUMP.                 
IT'S A LOT FASTER THAN WE COULD 

02:25:03.450 --> 02:25:04.382
IMPLEMENT BUMP.                 
IT'S A LOT FASTER THAN WE COULD 
TO WAIT FOR THIS AND STREET     

02:25:04.384 --> 02:25:06.417
IT'S A LOT FASTER THAN WE COULD

TO WAIT FOR THIS AND STREET     
PROJECT.                        
SO THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE    

02:25:07.254 --> 02:25:10.255
PROJECT.                        
SO THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE    
OUR STREETS ARE NOT JUST SMOOTH 

02:25:10.257 --> 02:25:10.655
SO THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE    
OUR STREETS ARE NOT JUST SMOOTH

SO I THINK SPENDING THE MONEY   

02:25:11.658 --> 02:25:14.258
BUT SAFE.
