SO I WOULD SAY WE'VE GOT A FOUR 
ALARM FIRE AND WE NEED TO LOOK

ALSO LAST WEEK A RESIDENT       

00:36:49.492 --> 00:36:52.894

QUESTIONED THE CLASSIFICATION   
OF MILLER AVENUE.               

00:36:56.799 --> 00:36:57.865
QUESTIONED THE CLASSIFICATION   
OF MILLER AVENUE.               
MAYBE IT WAS DENSER THAN WHAT   

00:36:57.867 --> 00:37:00.100
OF MILLER AVENUE.               
MAYBE IT WAS DENSER THAN WHAT   
HE EXPECTED AND DENSER THAN     

00:37:00.102 --> 00:37:03.872
MAYBE IT WAS DENSER THAN WHAT   
HE EXPECTED AND DENSER THAN     
OTHER SIMILAR STREETS AND THAT  

00:37:03.874 --> 00:37:07.408
HE EXPECTED AND DENSER THAN     
OTHER SIMILAR STREETS AND THAT  
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE I   

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.209
OTHER SIMILAR STREETS AND THAT  
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE I   
HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE    

00:37:08.211 --> 00:37:11.479
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE I   
HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE    
TWO WAY CYCLE TRAFFIC ON MILLER 

00:37:11.481 --> 00:37:12.213
HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE    
TWO WAY CYCLE TRAFFIC ON MILLER 
AND FOR SOME REASON THERE'S     

00:37:12.215 --> 00:37:15.850
TWO WAY CYCLE TRAFFIC ON MILLER 
AND FOR SOME REASON THERE'S     
BEEN REAL RESISTANCE TO SIMPLY  

00:37:15.852 --> 00:37:16.651
AND FOR SOME REASON THERE'S     
BEEN REAL RESISTANCE TO SIMPLY  
HAVING AN ENGINEERING STUDY AND 

00:37:16.653 --> 00:37:19.921

DETERMINING IF SAFE OR NOT.     

00:37:19.923 --> 00:37:20.855
HAVING AN ENGINEERING STUDY AND 
DETERMINING IF SAFE OR NOT.     
SO I HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER   

00:37:20.857 --> 00:37:23.891
DETERMINING IF SAFE OR NOT.     
SO I HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER   
THERE IS ANY CONNECTION IN THE  

00:37:23.893 --> 00:37:26.460
SO I HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER   
THERE IS ANY CONNECTION IN THE  
FACT THAT MILLER AVENUE MAY BE  

00:37:26.462 --> 00:37:31.299
THERE IS ANY CONNECTION IN THE  
FACT THAT MILLER AVENUE MAY BE  
UP ZONED FOR GREATER DENSITY    

00:37:31.301 --> 00:37:32.300

UP ZONED FOR GREATER DENSITY    
AND THIS TWO WAY CYCLE TRACK IS 
CONNECTED IN SOME WAY IN MY

THERE ARE ALSO SMALL AREAS THAT 
WERE RECENTLY ZONED TAKE ONE    

00:43:13.876 --> 00:43:14.608
THERE ARE ALSO SMALL AREAS THAT 
WERE RECENTLY ZONED TAKE ONE    
LIKE TRADER JOE'S AND BASKIN    

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.944
WERE RECENTLY ZONED TAKE ONE    
LIKE TRADER JOE'S AND BASKIN    
ROBBINS THAT ARE FOR SOME       

00:43:16.946 --> 00:43:20.514

THE MAP AND ON THE POINT        
OF TRANSITION AS WELL.          
IN A SIMILAR VEIN I BELIEVE

SELECTING A FEW DOZEN ARE ONE   
OR TWO PARCELS TO BE INCLUDED   

00:43:36.966 --> 00:43:39.600
SELECTING A FEW DOZEN ARE ONE   
OR TWO PARCELS TO BE INCLUDED   
IN TRANSITION.                  

00:43:39.602 --> 00:43:40.467
OR TWO PARCELS TO BE INCLUDED   
IN TRANSITION.                  
PARTS OF MILLER STADIUM IN      

00:43:40.469 --> 00:43:41.235
IN TRANSITION.

CATEGORY THOSE EARNING 150000

WE ADDED 6000 HOUSEHOLDS AT     
THAT RATE OF EARNING WE LOST    

01:13:42.803 --> 01:13:43.602
WE ADDED 6000 HOUSEHOLDS AT     
THAT RATE OF EARNING WE LOST    
ALMOST 4000 HOUSEHOLDS EARNING

INCREASES IN THE MEDIAN INCOME  
HAVE BEEN FAR OUTPACED BY       
INCREASES IN MEDIAN RENT IN ANN 

01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:58.817
HAVE BEEN FAR OUTPACED BY       
INCREASES IN MEDIAN RENT IN ANN 
ARBOR AND THIS BECAME           

01:13:58.819 --> 01:13:59.484
INCREASES IN MEDIAN RENT IN ANN 
ARBOR AND THIS BECAME           
PARTICULARLY TRUE UP UNTIL      

01:13:59.486 --> 01:13:59.819
ARBOR AND THIS BECAME           
PARTICULARLY TRUE UP UNTIL      
2019.                           

01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:03.221
PARTICULARLY TRUE UP UNTIL      
2019.                           
THOSE WERE CLOSELY ALIGNED.     

01:14:03.223 --> 01:14:04.156
2019.                           
THOSE WERE CLOSELY ALIGNED.     
SINCE THEN MEDIAN INCOME HAS    

01:14:04.158 --> 01:14:07.492
THOSE WERE CLOSELY ALIGNED.     
SINCE THEN MEDIAN INCOME HAS    
DECLINED WHILE MEDIAN RENT HAS

SINCE THEN MEDIAN INCOME HAS    
DECLINED WHILE MEDIAN RENT HAS

DECLINED WHILE MEDIAN RENT HAS  
INCREASED.

01:14:11.199 --> 01:14:11.997
INCREASED.                      
SO POINT ONE IS THAT GROWTH IN  
OUR HOUSING SUPPLY CAN AFFECT   

01:14:11.999 --> 01:14:15.201
SO POINT ONE IS THAT GROWTH IN  
OUR HOUSING SUPPLY CAN AFFECT   
WHETHER WE'LL SEE MORE OR LESS  

01:14:15.203 --> 01:14:17.803
OUR HOUSING SUPPLY CAN AFFECT

TO WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

IT'S A MISTAKE TO FOCUS SOLELY  

01:14:31.151 --> 01:14:33.685
HOUSING NEEDS.                  
IT'S A MISTAKE TO FOCUS SOLELY  
ON POPULATION NUMBERS HOUSEHOLD 

01:14:33.687 --> 01:14:34.620
IT'S A MISTAKE TO FOCUS SOLELY

01:54:31.916 --> 01:54:34.350
            CONSTRUCTION SHALL  
HAVE NO GAS CONNECTION AT ALL.  
SO THOSE ARE MY MAIN QUESTIONS  

01:54:34.352 --> 01:54:35.017
HAVE NO GAS CONNECTION AT ALL.  
SO THOSE ARE MY MAIN QUESTIONS  
ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY        

01:54:35.019 --> 01:54:35.351
SO THOSE ARE MY MAIN QUESTIONS  
ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY        
FEATURES.                       

01:54:35.353 --> 01:54:36.619

FEATURES.                       
>> AGAIN TO SUM UP IS IT IS     

01:54:36.621 --> 01:54:37.353
FEATURES.                       
>> AGAIN TO SUM UP IS IT IS     
THIS GOING TO BE ONE HUNDRED    

01:54:37.355 --> 01:54:38.155
>> AGAIN TO SUM UP IS IT IS     
THIS GOING TO BE ONE HUNDRED    
PERCENT ELECTRIC POWER BECAUSE  

01:54:38.157 --> 01:54:38.822
THIS GOING TO BE ONE HUNDRED    
PERCENT ELECTRIC POWER BECAUSE  
IT COULD TECHNICALLY BE IN      

01:54:38.824 --> 01:54:39.489
PERCENT ELECTRIC POWER BECAUSE  
IT COULD TECHNICALLY BE IN      
COMPLIANCE WITH FIVE EIGHTEEN   

01:54:39.491 --> 01:54:40.290
IT COULD TECHNICALLY BE IN      
COMPLIANCE WITH FIVE EIGHTEEN   
POINT FOUR WITH LESS THAN HALF  

01:54:40.292 --> 01:54:40.957
COMPLIANCE WITH FIVE EIGHTEEN   
POINT FOUR WITH LESS THAN HALF  
A PERCENT IF IT PROVIDES        

01:54:40.959 --> 01:54:41.724
POINT FOUR WITH LESS THAN HALF  
A PERCENT IF IT PROVIDES        
CONDUIT AND ELECTRIC PANELS FOR 

01:54:41.726 --> 01:54:42.392
A PERCENT IF IT PROVIDES        
CONDUIT AND ELECTRIC PANELS FOR 
FUTURE ELECTRIFICATION.         

01:54:42.394 --> 01:54:43.159
CONDUIT AND ELECTRIC PANELS FOR 
FUTURE ELECTRIFICATION.         
BUT AS WE KNOW, DTI HAS         

01:54:43.161 --> 01:54:43.726
FUTURE ELECTRIFICATION.         
BUT AS WE KNOW, DTI HAS         
SUFFICIENT CAPACITY FOR         

01:54:43.728 --> 01:54:46.329
BUT AS WE KNOW, DTI HAS         
SUFFICIENT CAPACITY FOR         
ELECTRIFICATION ON DAY ONE.     

01:54:46.331 --> 01:54:47.330
SUFFICIENT CAPACITY FOR         
ELECTRIFICATION ON DAY ONE.

FOR STAFF.                      

03:02:00.294 --> 03:02:03.662
WOULD BE VERY TIME INTENSIVE    
FOR STAFF.

MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US DO     
THAT.                           
SO THAT IS STILL A GOAL OF OURS 

03:02:09.403 --> 03:02:11.236
THAT.

03:02:35.196 --> 03:02:35.995
DURING THE LAST PRESENTATION

TOPIC BUT IT'S HIGHLY GERMANE   
TO THE PROCESS WE'RE GOING

TOPIC BUT IT'S HIGHLY GERMANE   
TO THE PROCESS WE'RE GOING      
THROUGH NOW.                    

03:02:39.534 --> 03:02:42.401
TO THE PROCESS WE'RE GOING      
THROUGH NOW.                    
MY WHOLE POINT ABOUT THE        

03:02:42.403 --> 03:02:43.102
THROUGH NOW.                    
MY WHOLE POINT ABOUT THE        
POSTCARDS AND THE RETURN RATES  

03:02:43.104 --> 03:02:46.172
MY WHOLE POINT ABOUT THE        
POSTCARDS AND THE RETURN RATES  
AND THE PARTICIPATION AND THE   

03:02:46.174 --> 03:02:46.973
POSTCARDS AND THE RETURN RATES  
AND THE PARTICIPATION AND THE   
RULE OF THUMB FOR PLANNERS IS   

03:02:46.975 --> 03:02:49.808
AND THE PARTICIPATION AND THE   
RULE OF THUMB FOR PLANNERS IS   
THAT FOLKS REALLY DON'T PAY     

03:02:49.810 --> 03:02:50.476
RULE OF THUMB FOR PLANNERS IS   
THAT FOLKS REALLY DON'T PAY     
MUCH ATTENTION WHEN YOU'RE      

03:02:50.478 --> 03:02:51.144
THAT FOLKS REALLY DON'T PAY     
MUCH ATTENTION WHEN YOU'RE      
DOING THE PLAN AND ALL THE      

03:02:51.146 --> 03:02:53.812
MUCH ATTENTION WHEN YOU'RE      
DOING THE PLAN AND ALL THE      
UPFRONT IMPORTANT STUFF AND     

03:02:53.814 --> 03:02:54.814
DOING THE PLAN AND ALL THE      
UPFRONT IMPORTANT STUFF AND     
THEN WHEN A REAL PROJECT COMES  

03:02:54.816 --> 03:02:55.581
UPFRONT IMPORTANT STUFF AND     
THEN WHEN A REAL PROJECT COMES  
OUT THEN THEY COME OUT OF THE   

03:02:55.583 --> 03:02:58.017
THEN WHEN A REAL PROJECT COMES  
OUT THEN THEY COME OUT OF THE   
WOODWORK BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY 

03:02:58.019 --> 03:02:58.750
OUT THEN THEY COME OUT OF THE   
WOODWORK BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY 
UNHAPPY BECAUSE NOW THEY CAN    

03:02:58.752 --> 03:02:59.285
WOODWORK BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY 
UNHAPPY BECAUSE NOW THEY CAN    
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.           

03:02:59.287 --> 03:03:02.087
UNHAPPY BECAUSE NOW THEY CAN    
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.           
SO I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FOR A  

03:03:02.089 --> 03:03:02.854
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.           
SO I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FOR A  
PROJECT THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE  

03:03:02.856 --> 03:03:05.858
SO I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FOR A  
PROJECT THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE  
A REAL TANGIBLE IMPACT ON THE   

03:03:05.860 --> 03:03:06.659
PROJECT THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE  
A REAL TANGIBLE IMPACT ON THE   
NEIGHBORHOOD TO HAVE GENERATED

I WAS NOT PLANNING TO GO        
THROUGH SIX SIX HOUR MEETINGS   

03:06:34.836 --> 03:06:35.634
I WAS NOT PLANNING TO GO

AGAIN BECAUSE THAT'S THE        
PURPOSE OF THIS ROUND IS TO GET

ON RIVER AND SO WE WANT TO      
BUILD FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE SURE  

03:26:02.335 --> 03:26:03.067
ON RIVER AND SO WE WANT TO      
BUILD FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE SURE  
THAT IN THE CASE OF HIGHER      

03:26:03.069 --> 03:26:06.170
BUILD FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE SURE

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE      
DANGEROUS RIGHT.                
THE FACT THAT PARTICULARLY ON

DANGEROUS RIGHT.                
THE FACT THAT PARTICULARLY ON   
OUR WASTEWATER SIDE WE'RE SO    

03:29:04.150 --> 03:29:06.817
THE FACT THAT PARTICULARLY ON   
OUR WASTEWATER SIDE WE'RE SO    
WE'RE BELOW CAPACITY THERE'S A  

03:29:06.819 --> 03:29:10.922
OUR WASTEWATER SIDE WE'RE SO    
WE'RE BELOW CAPACITY THERE'S A  
LOT OF CAPACITY THAT SUGGESTS   

03:29:10.924 --> 03:29:12.022
WE'RE BELOW CAPACITY THERE'S A  
LOT OF CAPACITY THAT SUGGESTS   
TO ME THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY 

03:29:12.024 --> 03:29:14.792
LOT OF CAPACITY THAT SUGGESTS   
TO ME THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY 
COST ASSOCIATED, THAT THERE'S   

03:29:14.794 --> 03:29:15.526
TO ME THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY 
COST ASSOCIATED, THAT THERE'S   
SOME INCREMENTAL COST BUT       

03:29:15.528 --> 03:29:16.294
COST ASSOCIATED, THAT THERE'S   
SOME INCREMENTAL COST BUT       
THERE'S A FIXED COST ASSOCIATED 

03:29:16.296 --> 03:29:18.662
SOME INCREMENTAL COST BUT       
THERE'S A FIXED COST ASSOCIATED 
WITH JUST KEEPING THE           

03:29:18.664 --> 03:29:19.296
THERE'S A FIXED COST ASSOCIATED 
WITH JUST KEEPING THE           
WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT      

03:29:19.298 --> 03:29:19.630
WITH JUST KEEPING THE           
WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT      
GOING.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT      
GOING.                          
AND SO AGAIN FOR SOME PERIOD    

03:29:22.768 --> 03:29:23.501
GOING.                          
AND SO AGAIN FOR SOME PERIOD    
OF TIME THINGS GET CHEAPER ON A 

03:29:23.503 --> 03:29:26.870
AND SO AGAIN FOR SOME PERIOD    
OF TIME THINGS GET CHEAPER ON A 
PER UNIT BASIS USING IT TO ITS  

03:29:26.872 --> 03:29:27.204
OF TIME THINGS GET CHEAPER ON A 
PER UNIT BASIS USING IT TO ITS  
CAPACITY.                       

03:29:27.206 --> 03:29:27.538
PER UNIT BASIS USING IT TO ITS

RIGHT.                          

03:29:27.540 --> 03:29:30.475
CAPACITY.                       
RIGHT.                          
IT'S IT'S EFFECTIVELY I DON'T   

03:29:30.477 --> 03:29:31.342
RIGHT.                          
IT'S IT'S EFFECTIVELY I DON'T   
WANT TO SAY OVERBUILT BUT I     

03:29:31.344 --> 03:29:32.009
IT'S IT'S EFFECTIVELY I DON'T   
WANT TO SAY OVERBUILT BUT I     
MEAN IT'S BUILT FOR GROWTH.     

03:29:32.011 --> 03:29:34.378
WANT TO SAY OVERBUILT BUT I     
MEAN IT'S BUILT FOR GROWTH.     
IT'S IT'S ANTICIPATE THAT.      

03:29:34.380 --> 03:29:35.613
MEAN IT'S BUILT FOR GROWTH.     
IT'S IT'S ANTICIPATE THAT.      
SO I THINK THAT THAT IS WHEN I  

03:29:35.615 --> 03:29:38.182
IT'S IT'S ANTICIPATE THAT.      
SO I THINK THAT THAT IS WHEN I  
LOOK AT THE WASTEWATER          

03:29:38.184 --> 03:29:39.050
SO I THINK THAT THAT IS WHEN I  
LOOK AT THE WASTEWATER          
TREATMENT ONE IN PARTICULAR I   

03:29:39.052 --> 03:29:39.784
LOOK AT THE WASTEWATER          
TREATMENT ONE IN PARTICULAR I   
THINK LIKE OH THIS MAKES A      

03:29:39.786 --> 03:29:42.486
TREATMENT ONE IN PARTICULAR I   
THINK LIKE OH THIS MAKES A      
WHOLE LOT OF SENSE.             

03:29:42.488 --> 03:29:43.554
THINK LIKE OH THIS MAKES A      
WHOLE LOT OF SENSE.             
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE ON THE      

03:29:43.556 --> 03:29:44.255
WHOLE LOT OF SENSE.             
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE ON THE      
DRINKING WATER SIDE THE WAY     

03:29:44.257 --> 03:29:46.156
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE ON THE      
DRINKING WATER SIDE THE WAY     
THAT I READ THOSE GRAPHS        

03:29:46.158 --> 03:29:47.091
DRINKING WATER SIDE THE WAY     
THAT I READ THOSE GRAPHS        
ALREADY THINGS WE'RE GOING TO   

03:29:47.093 --> 03:29:50.161
THAT I READ THOSE GRAPHS        
ALREADY THINGS WE'RE GOING TO   
GET CLOSE AND SO WE SHOULD BE   

03:29:50.163 --> 03:29:53.631
ALREADY THINGS WE'RE GOING TO   
GET CLOSE AND SO WE SHOULD BE   
THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS  

03:29:53.633 --> 03:29:54.565
GET CLOSE AND SO WE SHOULD BE   
THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS  
LIKE AND IT ALSO MAKES ME       

03:29:54.567 --> 03:29:57.868
THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS  
LIKE AND IT ALSO MAKES ME       
WONDER WHAT ARE SOME OF THE     

03:29:57.870 --> 03:29:58.536
LIKE AND IT ALSO MAKES ME       
WONDER WHAT ARE SOME OF THE     
BIGGER USERS OF WATER AND I     

03:29:58.538 --> 03:30:01.371
WONDER WHAT ARE SOME OF THE     
BIGGER USERS OF WATER AND I     
KNOW THAT WE'VE RECENTLY.       

03:30:01.373 --> 03:30:02.473
BIGGER USERS OF WATER AND I     
KNOW THAT WE'VE RECENTLY.       
WELL, SINCE I'VE LIVED IN TOWN  

03:30:02.475 --> 03:30:05.142
KNOW THAT WE'VE RECENTLY.       
WELL, SINCE I'VE LIVED IN TOWN  
WE'VE MOVED TO PRICING WATER    

03:30:05.144 --> 03:30:05.876
WELL, SINCE I'VE LIVED IN TOWN  
WE'VE MOVED TO PRICING WATER    
WHERE THE FIRST LIKE BASIC      

03:30:05.878 --> 03:30:09.180
WE'VE MOVED TO PRICING WATER    
WHERE THE FIRST LIKE BASIC      
HUMAN NEEDS ARE CHEAPER AND     

03:30:09.182 --> 03:30:10.047
WHERE THE FIRST LIKE BASIC      
HUMAN NEEDS ARE CHEAPER AND     
THEN WE ESCALATE THE PRICES.    

03:30:10.049 --> 03:30:11.215
HUMAN NEEDS ARE CHEAPER AND     
THEN WE ESCALATE THE PRICES.    
IF YOU ARE A SUPER USER         

03:30:11.217 --> 03:30:13.984
THEN WE ESCALATE THE PRICES.    
IF YOU ARE A SUPER USER         
OF WATER BUT ALSO IT MAKES ME   

03:30:13.986 --> 03:30:17.421
IF YOU ARE A SUPER USER         
OF WATER BUT ALSO IT MAKES ME   
THINK ABOUT LIKE HOW MANY       

03:30:17.423 --> 03:30:18.089
OF WATER BUT ALSO IT MAKES ME   
THINK ABOUT LIKE HOW MANY       
PEOPLE ARE MONITORING THEIR     

03:30:18.091 --> 03:30:21.592
THINK ABOUT LIKE HOW MANY       
PEOPLE ARE MONITORING THEIR     
LAWNS WASHING THEIR CARS AND    

03:30:21.594 --> 03:30:22.360
PEOPLE ARE MONITORING THEIR     
LAWNS WASHING THEIR CARS AND    
LIKE IF THERE'S ACTUALLY WATER  

03:30:22.362 --> 03:30:26.096
LAWNS WASHING THEIR CARS AND    
LIKE IF THERE'S ACTUALLY WATER  
SAVINGS CAN HELP MAKE US NOT    

03:30:26.098 --> 03:30:29.266
LIKE IF THERE'S ACTUALLY WATER  
SAVINGS CAN HELP MAKE US NOT    
NECESSARILY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 

03:30:29.268 --> 03:30:30.100
SAVINGS CAN HELP MAKE US NOT    
NECESSARILY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
NEW WATER TREATMENT PLANT IN 20 

03:30:30.102 --> 03:30:33.270
NECESSARILY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
NEW WATER TREATMENT PLANT IN 20 
30 OR SO AND I JUST DON'T I     

03:30:33.272 --> 03:30:36.306
NEW WATER TREATMENT PLANT IN 20 
30 OR SO AND I JUST DON'T I     
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.    

03:30:36.308 --> 03:30:39.977
30 OR SO AND I JUST DON'T I     
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.    
MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THIS CURB 

03:30:39.979 --> 03:30:40.778
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.    
MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THIS CURB 
PROBABLY ASSUMES THAT THE       

03:30:40.780 --> 03:30:44.582
MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THIS CURB 
PROBABLY ASSUMES THAT THE       
PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE THE FUTURE 

03:30:44.584 --> 03:30:45.515
PROBABLY ASSUMES THAT THE       
PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE THE FUTURE 
IN ARBITRATES WILL BE USING THE 

03:30:45.517 --> 03:30:48.019
PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE THE FUTURE 
IN ARBITRATES WILL BE USING THE 
WATER THE SAME WAY THAT PERSON  

03:30:48.021 --> 03:30:49.119
IN ARBITRATES WILL BE USING THE 
WATER THE SAME WAY THAT PERSON  
IN ARBITRATES ARE AND I HOPE    

03:30:49.121 --> 03:30:49.887
WATER THE SAME WAY THAT PERSON  
IN ARBITRATES ARE AND I HOPE    
THAT WE CAN BE MORE SUSTAINABLE 

03:30:49.889 --> 03:30:51.689
IN ARBITRATES ARE AND I HOPE    
THAT WE CAN BE MORE SUSTAINABLE 
IN OUR WATER USE.               

03:30:51.691 --> 03:30:52.623
THAT WE CAN BE MORE SUSTAINABLE 
IN OUR WATER USE.               
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M READING FROM 

03:30:52.625 --> 03:30:55.559
IN OUR WATER USE.               
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M READING FROM 
THOSE GRAPHS IS THAT FEEL LIKE  

03:30:55.561 --> 03:30:56.260
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M READING FROM 
THOSE GRAPHS IS THAT FEEL LIKE  
CORRECT INTERPRETATIONS AND     

03:30:56.262 --> 03:30:59.797
THOSE GRAPHS IS THAT FEEL LIKE  
CORRECT INTERPRETATIONS AND     
JUST I THINK YOU'RE ALSO        

03:30:59.799 --> 03:31:00.530
CORRECT INTERPRETATIONS AND     
JUST I THINK YOU'RE ALSO        
GETTING AT IT MAYBE YOU'RE      

03:31:00.532 --> 03:31:03.201
JUST I THINK YOU'RE ALSO        
GETTING AT IT MAYBE YOU'RE      
GETTING AT HOW HOW ON SORT OF A 

03:31:03.203 --> 03:31:06.871
GETTING AT IT MAYBE YOU'RE      
GETTING AT HOW HOW ON SORT OF A 
PER CAPITA BASIS OF WATER AND   

03:31:06.873 --> 03:31:07.671
GETTING AT HOW HOW ON SORT OF A 
PER CAPITA BASIS OF WATER AND   
SANITARY ALSO INVOLVES RIGHT.   

03:31:07.673 --> 03:31:10.274
PER CAPITA BASIS OF WATER AND   
SANITARY ALSO INVOLVES RIGHT.   
WITH MORE EFFICIENT FIXTURES    

03:31:10.276 --> 03:31:11.208
SANITARY ALSO INVOLVES RIGHT.   
WITH MORE EFFICIENT FIXTURES    
AND JUST MORE MINDFULNESS ABOUT 

03:31:11.210 --> 03:31:11.808
WITH MORE EFFICIENT FIXTURES    
AND JUST MORE MINDFULNESS ABOUT 
OUR USE OF RESOURCES.           

03:31:11.810 --> 03:31:14.678
AND JUST MORE MINDFULNESS ABOUT 
OUR USE OF RESOURCES.           
SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING      

03:31:14.680 --> 03:31:15.179
OUR USE OF RESOURCES.           
SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING      
PARTS TO IT.                    

03:31:15.181 --> 03:31:16.247
SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING      
PARTS TO IT.                    
SO THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THIS     

03:31:16.249 --> 03:31:18.916
PARTS TO IT.                    
SO THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THIS     
ANALYSIS HAS HAPPENED AND WHY   

03:31:18.918 --> 03:31:22.386
SO THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THIS     
ANALYSIS HAS HAPPENED AND WHY   
IT'S HAPPENING SO THAT WE CAN   

03:31:22.388 --> 03:31:23.420
ANALYSIS HAS HAPPENED AND WHY   
IT'S HAPPENING SO THAT WE CAN   
STAY ON TOP OF ALL OF THOSE     

03:31:23.422 --> 03:31:26.556
IT'S HAPPENING SO THAT WE CAN   
STAY ON TOP OF ALL OF THOSE     
TRENDS AND THE LIKE TO MAKE     

03:31:26.558 --> 03:31:27.291
STAY ON TOP OF ALL OF THOSE     
TRENDS AND THE LIKE TO MAKE     
SURE THAT IN THE CONTEXT        

03:31:27.293 --> 03:31:30.294
TRENDS AND THE LIKE TO MAKE     
SURE THAT IN THE CONTEXT        
OF IT'S MOVING TARGETS.         

03:31:30.296 --> 03:31:31.495
SURE THAT IN THE CONTEXT        
OF IT'S MOVING TARGETS.         
>> BUT THE ONE THING WE WANT TO 

03:31:31.497 --> 03:31:32.230
OF IT'S MOVING TARGETS.         
>> BUT THE ONE THING WE WANT TO 
BE REALLY MINDFUL OF IS TO MAKE 

03:31:32.232 --> 03:31:33.830
>> BUT THE ONE THING WE WANT TO 
BE REALLY MINDFUL OF IS TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE CAN SAY YES WE ARE 

03:31:33.832 --> 03:31:34.432
BE REALLY MINDFUL OF IS TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE CAN SAY YES WE ARE 
SORRY BUT JUMPED IN.            

03:31:34.434 --> 03:31:38.169
SURE THAT WE CAN SAY YES WE ARE 
SORRY BUT JUMPED IN.            
BUT IF WE HAVE IF WE CAN SEND   

03:31:38.171 --> 03:31:38.836
SORRY BUT JUMPED IN.            
BUT IF WE HAVE IF WE CAN SEND   
QUESTIONS BACK TO THE WATER     

03:31:38.838 --> 03:31:42.139
BUT IF WE HAVE IF WE CAN SEND   
QUESTIONS BACK TO THE WATER     
FOLKS, I WOULD ASK SPECIFICALLY 

03:31:42.141 --> 03:31:45.142
QUESTIONS BACK TO THE WATER     
FOLKS, I WOULD ASK SPECIFICALLY 
ABOUT THAT LIKE WATER USE BY    

03:31:45.144 --> 03:31:46.243
FOLKS, I WOULD ASK SPECIFICALLY 
ABOUT THAT LIKE WATER USE BY    
KIND OF HOUSING IF THERE'S ANY  

03:31:46.245 --> 03:31:46.944
ABOUT THAT LIKE WATER USE BY    
KIND OF HOUSING IF THERE'S ANY  
INFORMATION OR IF THAT'S        

03:31:46.946 --> 03:31:49.813
KIND OF HOUSING IF THERE'S ANY  
INFORMATION OR IF THAT'S        
ALREADY COOKED INTO THE SHAPE   

03:31:49.815 --> 03:31:50.514
INFORMATION OR IF THAT'S        
ALREADY COOKED INTO THE SHAPE   
OF THOSE LINES SUGGESTS TO ME   

03:31:50.516 --> 03:31:53.383
ALREADY COOKED INTO THE SHAPE   
OF THOSE LINES SUGGESTS TO ME   
THAT THEY'RE JUST EXPECTED      

03:31:53.385 --> 03:31:54.385
OF THOSE LINES SUGGESTS TO ME   
THAT THEY'RE JUST EXPECTED      
LINEAR RATHER THAN KIND OF PER  

03:31:54.387 --> 03:31:57.588
THAT THEY'RE JUST EXPECTED      
LINEAR RATHER THAN KIND OF PER  
CAPITA USE GOING DOWN.          

03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:58.722
LINEAR RATHER THAN KIND OF PER  
CAPITA USE GOING DOWN.          
BUT I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T I  

03:31:58.724 --> 03:32:01.392
CAPITA USE GOING DOWN.          
BUT I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T I  
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS.     

03:32:01.394 --> 03:32:02.393
BUT I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T I  
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS.     
I DO THINK OVER TIME IF I'M     

03:32:02.395 --> 03:32:04.695
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS.     
I DO THINK OVER TIME IF I'M     
REMEMBERING CORRECTLY THAT IT   

03:32:04.697 --> 03:32:05.529
I DO THINK OVER TIME IF I'M     
REMEMBERING CORRECTLY THAT IT   
HAS GONE DOWN OVER TIME RIGHT.  

03:32:05.531 --> 03:32:08.498
REMEMBERING CORRECTLY THAT IT   
HAS GONE DOWN OVER TIME RIGHT.  
WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND     

03:32:08.500 --> 03:32:09.032
HAS GONE DOWN OVER TIME RIGHT.  
WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND     
AWARENESS OF THIS.

WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND     
AWARENESS OF THIS.

03:32:24.350 --> 03:32:25.015
IT WORD FOR WORD I PRESUME THE  
FLAT LEVELS THEY'RE SHOWING     
THIS WAS A THOUGHT EXERCISE.    

03:32:25.017 --> 03:32:27.684
FLAT LEVELS THEY'RE SHOWING     
THIS WAS A THOUGHT EXERCISE.    
THIS IS WHAT OUR CURRENT        

03:32:27.686 --> 03:32:28.318
THIS WAS A THOUGHT EXERCISE.    
THIS IS WHAT OUR CURRENT        
CAPACITY IS RIGHT NOW.          

03:32:28.320 --> 03:32:31.688
THIS IS WHAT OUR CURRENT        
CAPACITY IS RIGHT NOW.          
IF IT NEVER CHANGED, HERE'S     

03:32:31.690 --> 03:32:32.323
CAPACITY IS RIGHT NOW.          
IF IT NEVER CHANGED, HERE'S     
WHERE WE WOULD HIT IT.          

03:32:32.325 --> 03:32:33.257
IF IT NEVER CHANGED, HERE'S     
WHERE WE WOULD HIT IT.          
BUT I GOT TO BELIEVE THEY'RE    

03:32:33.259 --> 03:32:34.992
WHERE WE WOULD HIT IT.          
BUT I GOT TO BELIEVE THEY'RE    
LOOKING AT LONG TERM PLANNING   

03:32:34.994 --> 03:32:35.660
BUT I GOT TO BELIEVE THEY'RE    
LOOKING AT LONG TERM PLANNING   
CONSTANTLY AND YES, THAT WAS    

03:32:35.662 --> 03:32:39.096
LOOKING AT LONG TERM PLANNING   
CONSTANTLY AND YES, THAT WAS    
GOING TO BE MY COME AT THINGS   

03:32:39.098 --> 03:32:39.629
CONSTANTLY AND YES, THAT WAS    
GOING TO BE MY COME AT THINGS   
AS THEY GO ALONG.               

03:32:39.631 --> 03:32:40.431
GOING TO BE MY COME AT THINGS   
AS THEY GO ALONG.               
AND I KNOW THAT THE JORDAN      

03:32:40.433 --> 03:32:41.098
AS THEY GO ALONG.               
AND I KNOW THAT THE JORDAN      
RIVER WATERSHED COUNCIL HAS     

03:32:41.100 --> 03:32:43.100
AND I KNOW THAT THE JORDAN      
RIVER WATERSHED COUNCIL HAS     
BEEN QUITE INTERESTED IN DEMAND 

03:32:43.102 --> 03:32:43.834
RIVER WATERSHED COUNCIL HAS     
BEEN QUITE INTERESTED IN DEMAND 
MANAGEMENT TRYING TO BETTER     

03:32:43.836 --> 03:32:46.536
BEEN QUITE INTERESTED IN DEMAND 
MANAGEMENT TRYING TO BETTER     
INSTEAD OF MAKING MORE AND MORE 

03:32:46.538 --> 03:32:47.538
MANAGEMENT TRYING TO BETTER     
INSTEAD OF MAKING MORE AND MORE 
WATER, TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO  

03:32:47.540 --> 03:32:50.474
INSTEAD OF MAKING MORE AND MORE 
WATER, TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO  
USE IT MORE CONSCIOUSLY         

03:32:50.476 --> 03:32:50.874
WATER, TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO  
USE IT MORE CONSCIOUSLY         
EFFECTIVELY.                    

03:32:50.876 --> 03:32:51.942
USE IT MORE CONSCIOUSLY         
EFFECTIVELY.                    
AND I THINK THAT'S I IMAGINE A  

03:32:51.944 --> 03:32:54.946
EFFECTIVELY.                    
AND I THINK THAT'S I IMAGINE A  
CITY WATERING SHORT TERM FOLKS  

03:32:54.948 --> 03:32:55.746
AND I THINK THAT'S I IMAGINE A  
CITY WATERING SHORT TERM FOLKS  
ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT    

03:32:55.748 --> 03:32:56.013
CITY WATERING SHORT TERM FOLKS  
ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT    
TOO.                            

03:32:56.015 --> 03:32:56.347

RIGHT.                          
SO THIS IS A THOUGHT EXERCISE   

03:32:58.785 --> 03:33:01.652
RIGHT.                          
SO THIS IS A THOUGHT EXERCISE   
JUST TO SHOW FOLKS WE ARE AWARE 

03:33:01.654 --> 03:33:02.453
SO THIS IS A THOUGHT EXERCISE   
JUST TO SHOW FOLKS WE ARE AWARE 
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE'RE   

03:33:02.455 --> 03:33:03.120

AWARE OF HOW INCREASES IN       
DEVELOPMENT THAT MIGHT BE       
PROMPTED BECAUSE THE MASTER

DEVELOPMENT THAT MIGHT BE       
PROMPTED BECAUSE THE MASTER     
PLAN COULD AFFECT WATER         

03:33:06.625 --> 03:33:10.427
PROMPTED BECAUSE THE MASTER     
PLAN COULD AFFECT WATER         
PLANNING BUT WE'RE ACTIVELY     

03:33:10.429 --> 03:33:11.362
PLAN COULD AFFECT WATER         
PLANNING BUT WE'RE ACTIVELY     
ENGAGING IN WATER PLANNING ALL

REPLACING NINETEEN THIRTY NINE  
IN THE NINETEEN FORTY PLANT     
THEY HAVE THAT IN THEIR HORIZON 

03:34:00.713 --> 03:34:04.514
IN THE NINETEEN FORTY PLANT     
THEY HAVE THAT IN THEIR HORIZON 
AND I IMAGINE THAT WILL         

03:34:04.516 --> 03:34:06.950
THEY HAVE THAT IN THEIR HORIZON 
AND I IMAGINE THAT WILL         
INCREASE CAPACITY AS LONG AS IS 

03:34:06.952 --> 03:34:07.384
AND I IMAGINE THAT WILL         
INCREASE CAPACITY AS LONG AS IS 
ADEQUATE SOURCE.

IN THIS CHART SO SO MY CONCERN  
IS A LOT OF WHAT WE HEAR FROM   
THE COMMENTS IS WE CAN'T BUILD  

03:34:18.897 --> 03:34:19.563
IS A LOT OF WHAT WE HEAR FROM   
THE COMMENTS IS WE CAN'T BUILD  
ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE  

03:34:19.565 --> 03:34:20.331
THE COMMENTS IS WE CAN'T BUILD  
ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE  
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD IT. 

03:34:20.333 --> 03:34:23.567
ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE  
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD IT. 
BUT WHAT I SEE IN THESE         

03:34:23.569 --> 03:34:24.201
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD IT. 
BUT WHAT I SEE IN THESE         
STRATEGIC PLANS BOTH IN THE

03:37:18.176 --> 03:37:21.244
OF LIKE OH OK, OUR WATER IS     
REALLY CLOSE.                   
WE SHOULDN'T BUILD ANY MORE AND

WE SHOULDN'T BUILD ANY MORE AND 
AND I JUST DON'T LIKE IS THAT A 
RATIONAL RESPONSE?              

03:37:24.951 --> 03:37:25.816
AND I JUST DON'T LIKE IS THAT A 
RATIONAL RESPONSE?              
AND THEN THE OTHER THING WHICH  

03:37:25.818 --> 03:37:29.686
RATIONAL RESPONSE?              
AND THEN THE OTHER THING WHICH  
I THINK I REMEMBER FROM MR

AND THEN THE OTHER THING WHICH  
I THINK I REMEMBER FROM MR      
DANCE'S REPORT IS ONE OF THE

I THINK I REMEMBER FROM MR      
DANCE'S REPORT IS ONE OF THE    
PROBLEMS IS PEOPLE ARE          

03:37:34.126 --> 03:37:36.393
DANCE'S REPORT IS ONE OF THE    
PROBLEMS IS PEOPLE ARE          
CONSERVING WATER WHICH MEANS    

03:37:36.395 --> 03:37:37.261
PROBLEMS IS PEOPLE ARE          
CONSERVING WATER WHICH MEANS    
THAT THE CITY IS GETTING LESS   

03:37:37.263 --> 03:37:41.064
CONSERVING WATER WHICH MEANS    
THAT THE CITY IS GETTING LESS   
MONEY FOR WATER AND THAT CAN BE 

03:37:41.066 --> 03:37:44.634
THAT THE CITY IS GETTING LESS   
MONEY FOR WATER AND THAT CAN BE 
A DOWNSTREAM PROBLEM THAT THAT  

03:37:44.636 --> 03:37:48.405
MONEY FOR WATER AND THAT CAN BE 
A DOWNSTREAM PROBLEM THAT THAT  
THERE ARE A LOT OF KIND

A DOWNSTREAM PROBLEM THAT THAT  
THERE ARE A LOT OF KIND

THERE ARE A LOT OF KIND         
OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR   
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING OF LIKE

OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR   
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING OF LIKE  
OH WE'LL USE LESS WATER WILL    

03:37:57.015 --> 03:37:57.547
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING OF LIKE  
OH WE'LL USE LESS WATER WILL    
BUILD A NEW PLANT.              

03:37:57.549 --> 03:38:00.917
OH WE'LL USE LESS WATER WILL    
BUILD A NEW PLANT.              
WE'LL DO THAT LIKE THERE'S A    

03:38:00.919 --> 03:38:04.087
BUILD A NEW PLANT.              
WE'LL DO THAT LIKE THERE'S A    
LOT OF KIND OF THINGS THAT ARE  

03:38:04.089 --> 03:38:05.121
WE'LL DO THAT LIKE THERE'S A    
LOT OF KIND OF THINGS THAT ARE  
BUILT INTO THAT AND I DON'T I   

03:38:05.123 --> 03:38:05.856
LOT OF KIND OF THINGS THAT ARE  
BUILT INTO THAT AND I DON'T I   
DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN EASY

BUILT INTO THAT AND I DON'T I   
DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN EASY   
WAY TO SAY THAT.

DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN EASY   
WAY TO SAY THAT.                
I THINK CELEBI

IT'S HAPPENING SO AGAIN TONIGHT 
YOU HEARD AN EXAMPLE WHERE THEY

IT'S HAPPENING SO AGAIN TONIGHT 
YOU HEARD AN EXAMPLE WHERE THEY 
ARE INVESTING IN PUBLIC

YOU HEARD AN EXAMPLE WHERE THEY 
ARE INVESTING IN PUBLIC         
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE   

03:38:40.258 --> 03:38:46.262
ARE INVESTING IN PUBLIC         
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE   
THEIR THEIR NEEDS FOR THAT SITE 

03:38:46.264 --> 03:38:47.231
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE   
THEIR THEIR NEEDS FOR THAT SITE 
IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR SYSTEM    

03:38:47.233 --> 03:38:50.701
THEIR THEIR NEEDS FOR THAT SITE 
IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR SYSTEM    
THEY ARE ALSO IN ADDITION TO    

03:38:50.703 --> 03:38:51.434
IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR SYSTEM    
THEY ARE ALSO IN ADDITION TO    
THAT THEY ACTUALLY ALSO ARE

THEY ARE ALSO IN ADDITION TO    
THAT THEY ACTUALLY ALSO ARE     
MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE    

03:38:54.807 --> 03:39:02.245
THAT THEY ACTUALLY ALSO ARE     
MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE    
CITY THAT IS SORT OF A LEGACY   

03:39:02.247 --> 03:39:03.480
MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE    
CITY THAT IS SORT OF A LEGACY   
CALCULATION OF IF THEY HAD BEEN 

03:39:03.482 --> 03:39:06.917
CITY THAT IS SORT OF A LEGACY   
CALCULATION OF IF THEY HAD BEEN 
THERE CONTRIBUTION TO THE       

03:39:06.919 --> 03:39:07.718
CALCULATION OF IF THEY HAD BEEN 
THERE CONTRIBUTION TO THE       
LEGACY OF THE SYSTEM OPERATING  

03:39:07.720 --> 03:39:10.787
THERE CONTRIBUTION TO THE       
LEGACY OF THE SYSTEM OPERATING  
AND BEING INVESTED IN AND BEING 

03:39:10.789 --> 03:39:11.588
LEGACY OF THE SYSTEM OPERATING  
AND BEING INVESTED IN AND BEING 
BUILT OVER TIME THAT THEY HAVE  

03:39:11.590 --> 03:39:14.324
AND BEING INVESTED IN AND BEING 
BUILT OVER TIME THAT THEY HAVE  
NOT BEEN A USER PART OF THAT    

03:39:14.326 --> 03:39:15.158
BUILT OVER TIME THAT THEY HAVE  
NOT BEEN A USER PART OF THAT    
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BENEFIT IN 

03:39:15.160 --> 03:39:15.559
NOT BEEN A USER PART OF THAT    
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BENEFIT IN 
THE FUTURE.                     

03:39:15.561 --> 03:39:18.561
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BENEFIT IN 
THE FUTURE.                     
SO THOSE ARE WAYS THAT THEY DO  

03:39:18.563 --> 03:39:18.896
THE FUTURE.                     
SO THOSE ARE WAYS THAT THEY DO  
THAT.                           

03:39:18.898 --> 03:39:20.029
SO THOSE ARE WAYS THAT THEY DO  
THAT.                           
TO BE CLEAR, THERE IS NOT A     

03:39:20.031 --> 03:39:21.765
THAT.                           
TO BE CLEAR, THERE IS NOT A     
THIRD CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY    

03:39:21.767 --> 03:39:22.565
TO BE CLEAR, THERE IS NOT A     
THIRD CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY    
ARE MAKING THAT AUTOMATICALLY   

03:39:22.567 --> 03:39:25.469
THIRD CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY    
ARE MAKING THAT AUTOMATICALLY   
RESULTS IN AN INCREMENTAL       

03:39:25.471 --> 03:39:26.270
ARE MAKING THAT AUTOMATICALLY   
RESULTS IN AN INCREMENTAL       
CAPACITY INCREASE IN EITHER     

03:39:26.272 --> 03:39:29.606
RESULTS IN AN INCREMENTAL       
CAPACITY INCREASE IN EITHER     
OF THE PLANTS.                  

03:39:29.608 --> 03:39:30.540
CAPACITY INCREASE IN EITHER     
OF THE PLANTS.                  
THAT'S PART OF THE FINANCING.   

03:39:30.542 --> 03:39:31.207
OF THE PLANTS.                  
THAT'S PART OF THE FINANCING.   
IT'S REALLY COMPLEX BECAUSE     

03:39:31.209 --> 03:39:33.877
THAT'S PART OF THE FINANCING.   
IT'S REALLY COMPLEX BECAUSE     
THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY DETAILED  

03:39:33.879 --> 03:39:36.813
IT'S REALLY COMPLEX BECAUSE     
THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY DETAILED  
CONSTRAINTS ABOUT WHAT NEW      

03:39:36.815 --> 03:39:37.614
THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY DETAILED  
CONSTRAINTS ABOUT WHAT NEW      
USERS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT    

03:39:37.616 --> 03:39:41.584
CONSTRAINTS ABOUT WHAT NEW      
USERS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT    
AND WHAT EXISTING USERS ARE     

03:39:41.586 --> 03:39:42.385
USERS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT    
AND WHAT EXISTING USERS ARE     
EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE THAT TO  

03:39:42.387 --> 03:39:42.619
AND WHAT EXISTING USERS ARE     
EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE THAT TO  
THAT.                           

03:39:42.621 --> 03:39:45.622
EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE THAT TO  
THAT.                           
SO SO THAT THEY GET THING TO    

03:39:45.624 --> 03:39:46.423
THAT.                           
SO SO THAT THEY GET THING TO    
BRING THEM IN TO FORM MORE      

03:39:46.425 --> 03:39:46.623
SO SO THAT THEY GET THING TO    
BRING THEM IN TO FORM MORE      
BASIS.                          

03:39:46.625 --> 03:39:49.226
BRING THEM IN TO FORM MORE      
BASIS.                          
BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT   

03:39:49.228 --> 03:39:52.429
BASIS.                          
BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT   
HOW DEVELOPMENT IN ADDITION TO  

03:39:52.431 --> 03:39:53.463
BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT   
HOW DEVELOPMENT IN ADDITION TO  
I GUESS THE FEES THAT I'VE      

03:39:53.465 --> 03:39:56.733
HOW DEVELOPMENT IN ADDITION TO  
I GUESS THE FEES THAT I'VE      
MISSED IS THAT PROVIDES USERS.  

03:39:56.735 --> 03:39:57.801
I GUESS THE FEES THAT I'VE      
MISSED IS THAT PROVIDES USERS.  
SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT    

03:39:57.803 --> 03:40:01.137
MISSED IS THAT PROVIDES USERS.  
SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT    
USERS OF WATER AND USERS WHO    

03:40:01.139 --> 03:40:01.872
SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT    
USERS OF WATER AND USERS WHO    
ARE GETTING BILLED FOR SANITARY 

03:40:01.874 --> 03:40:05.242
USERS OF WATER AND USERS WHO    
ARE GETTING BILLED FOR SANITARY 
FLOW THAT IS ANOTHER USER       

03:40:05.244 --> 03:40:09.446
ARE GETTING BILLED FOR SANITARY 
FLOW THAT IS ANOTHER USER       
PAYING FOR THE SYSTEM BUT IT IS 

03:40:09.448 --> 03:40:13.249
FLOW THAT IS ANOTHER USER       
PAYING FOR THE SYSTEM BUT IT IS 
A COMPLEX WEB THAT IS NOT IT    

03:40:13.251 --> 03:40:13.751
PAYING FOR THE SYSTEM BUT IT IS 
A COMPLEX WEB THAT IS NOT IT    
DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY           

03:40:13.753 --> 03:40:18.689
A COMPLEX WEB THAT IS NOT IT    
DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY           
INCREMENTALLY GROW THAT SYSTEM  

03:40:18.691 --> 03:40:19.423
DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY           
INCREMENTALLY GROW THAT SYSTEM  
IN A SIMPLE WAY.                

03:40:19.425 --> 03:40:23.460
INCREMENTALLY GROW THAT SYSTEM  
IN A SIMPLE WAY.                
SO IS IT CORRECT TO SAY WE      

03:40:23.462 --> 03:40:24.060
IN A SIMPLE WAY.                
SO IS IT CORRECT TO SAY WE      
COULDN'T DIVERT THE PARTS       

03:40:24.062 --> 03:40:26.796
SO IS IT CORRECT TO SAY WE      
COULDN'T DIVERT THE PARTS       
CONTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE     

03:40:26.798 --> 03:40:27.464
COULDN'T DIVERT THE PARTS       
CONTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE     
BECAUSE THERE ARE HARD LIMITS   

03:40:27.466 --> 03:40:30.934
CONTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE     
BECAUSE THERE ARE HARD LIMITS   
ON WHAT NEW DEVELOPMENT COULD   

03:40:30.936 --> 03:40:31.468
BECAUSE THERE ARE HARD LIMITS   
ON WHAT NEW DEVELOPMENT COULD   
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT              

03:40:31.470 --> 03:40:34.738
ON WHAT NEW DEVELOPMENT COULD   
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT              
INFRASTRUCTURE CONTRIBUTION     

03:40:34.740 --> 03:40:35.705
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT              
INFRASTRUCTURE CONTRIBUTION     
VOLUNTARY YOU CAN DIVERT THAT   

03:40:35.707 --> 03:40:42.011
INFRASTRUCTURE CONTRIBUTION     
VOLUNTARY YOU CAN DIVERT THAT   
TO WHATEVER THANK YOU.          

03:40:42.013 --> 03:40:42.980
VOLUNTARY YOU CAN DIVERT THAT   
TO WHATEVER THANK YOU.          
>> MICHELLE, DID YOU DO WHAT    

03:40:42.982 --> 03:40:43.380
TO WHATEVER THANK YOU.          
>> MICHELLE, DID YOU DO WHAT    
YOU NEEDED?                     

03:40:43.382 --> 03:40:44.248
>> MICHELLE, DID YOU DO WHAT    
YOU NEEDED?                     
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE ANOTHER   

03:40:44.250 --> 03:40:46.049
YOU NEEDED?                     
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE ANOTHER   
COMMENT AND I ALLUDED TO THIS   

03:40:46.051 --> 03:40:46.650
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE ANOTHER   
COMMENT AND I ALLUDED TO THIS   
THAT THERE ARE SPECIAL          

03:40:46.652 --> 03:40:49.652
COMMENT AND I ALLUDED TO THIS   
THAT THERE ARE SPECIAL          
CONSTRAINTS AS WELL.            

03:40:49.654 --> 03:40:50.454
THAT THERE ARE SPECIAL          
CONSTRAINTS AS WELL.            
SO HERE WE'RE TALKING PURELY    

03:40:50.456 --> 03:40:53.490
CONSTRAINTS AS WELL.            
SO HERE WE'RE TALKING PURELY    
ABOUT NUMBERS AND THEY ARE      

03:40:53.492 --> 03:40:54.157
SO HERE WE'RE TALKING PURELY    
ABOUT NUMBERS AND THEY ARE      
STILL IN THEIR STUDY            

03:40:54.159 --> 03:40:54.891
ABOUT NUMBERS AND THEY ARE      
STILL IN THEIR STUDY            
INVESTIGATING WHAT PARTS OF THE 

03:40:54.893 --> 03:40:57.160
STILL IN THEIR STUDY            
INVESTIGATING WHAT PARTS OF THE 
CITY ARE GOING TO BE MORE       

03:40:57.162 --> 03:40:57.561
INVESTIGATING WHAT PARTS OF THE 
CITY ARE GOING TO BE MORE       
CONSTRAINED.                    

03:40:57.563 --> 03:40:58.228
CITY ARE GOING TO BE MORE       
CONSTRAINED.                    
SO THIS IS IMPORTANT TO START   

03:40:58.230 --> 03:41:00.964
CONSTRAINED.                    
SO THIS IS IMPORTANT TO START   
BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF SHOWING   

03:41:00.966 --> 03:41:04.735
SO THIS IS IMPORTANT TO START   
BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF SHOWING   
US SOME CONSTRAINTS IN OUR      

03:41:04.737 --> 03:41:05.669
BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF SHOWING   
US SOME CONSTRAINTS IN OUR      
VISION THAT WE STILL NEED TO    

03:41:05.671 --> 03:41:09.339
US SOME CONSTRAINTS IN OUR      
VISION THAT WE STILL NEED TO    
KNOW WHERE AS WELL AND WE'RE    

03:41:09.341 --> 03:41:12.442
VISION THAT WE STILL NEED TO    
KNOW WHERE AS WELL AND WE'RE    
WAITING ON THAT AND WOULD LIKE  

03:41:12.444 --> 03:41:13.510
KNOW WHERE AS WELL AND WE'RE    
WAITING ON THAT AND WOULD LIKE  
TO ALSO PUT THAT IN THE PLAN    

03:41:13.512 --> 03:41:14.044
WAITING ON THAT AND WOULD LIKE  
TO ALSO PUT THAT IN THE PLAN    
WHERE WE CAN.                   

03:41:14.046 --> 03:41:16.179

OF AN ISSUE OF PEOPLE NOT

OF AN ISSUE OF PEOPLE NOT       
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE BUILD  

03:41:19.484 --> 03:41:19.916
OF AN ISSUE OF PEOPLE NOT       
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE BUILD  
SCENARIOS ARE.                  

03:41:19.918 --> 03:41:23.487
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE BUILD  
SCENARIOS ARE.                  
I HEAR THEM TALKED ABOUT        

03:41:23.489 --> 03:41:24.354

PROJECTIONS THOSE ARE ALREADY   
DIFFERENT AND I HAVE BEEN       
PERSONALLY THINKING OF THEM AS

DIFFERENT AND I HAVE BEEN       
PERSONALLY THINKING OF THEM AS  
CAPACITY ESTIMATES AND ZONING   

03:41:36.068 --> 03:41:38.768
PERSONALLY THINKING OF THEM AS  
CAPACITY ESTIMATES AND ZONING   
ALONE DOES NOT DETERMINE        

03:41:38.770 --> 03:41:42.573
CAPACITY ESTIMATES AND ZONING   
ALONE DOES NOT DETERMINE        
CAPACITY CAPACITY TURNS ALSO ON 

03:41:42.575 --> 03:41:43.373
ALONE DOES NOT DETERMINE        
CAPACITY CAPACITY TURNS ALSO ON 
THERE ARE LIMITING FACTORS      

03:41:43.375 --> 03:41:44.040
CAPACITY CAPACITY TURNS ALSO ON 
THERE ARE LIMITING FACTORS      
OF CONSTRUCTION COSTS,          

03:41:44.042 --> 03:41:47.911
THERE ARE LIMITING FACTORS      
OF CONSTRUCTION COSTS,          
INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY AND     

03:41:47.913 --> 03:41:48.445

INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY AND     
RESIDENTS TOLERANCE FOR         
DIVERSITY SO I FEEL LIKE WHAT'S 

03:41:51.516 --> 03:41:52.415
RESIDENTS TOLERANCE FOR         
DIVERSITY SO I FEEL LIKE WHAT'S 
WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS SORT OF A 

03:41:52.417 --> 03:41:56.185
DIVERSITY SO I FEEL LIKE WHAT'S 
WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS SORT OF A 
MISUNDERSTANDING THAT WELL YOU  

03:41:56.187 --> 03:41:57.020
WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS SORT OF A 
MISUNDERSTANDING THAT WELL YOU

GUYS ARE AIMING TO DO ALL       
OF THIS AND I DON'T THINK       
THAT'S THE WAY THOSE NUMBERS    

03:42:00.492 --> 03:42:01.291
OF THIS AND I DON'T THINK       
THAT'S THE WAY THOSE NUMBERS    
WERE MEANT ON THE SLIDES WHEN   

03:42:01.293 --> 03:42:03.326
THAT'S THE WAY THOSE NUMBERS    
WERE MEANT ON THE SLIDES WHEN   
THEY WERE SHOWN AND I DIDN'T    

03:42:03.328 --> 03:42:03.660
WERE MEANT ON THE SLIDES WHEN   
THEY WERE SHOWN AND I DIDN'T    
FIND THEM.                      

03:42:03.662 --> 03:42:06.796
THEY WERE SHOWN AND I DIDN'T    
FIND THEM.                      
THERE'S A SECTION WHERE THERE   

03:42:06.798 --> 03:42:07.730
FIND THEM.                      
THERE'S A SECTION WHERE THERE   
ARE SOME NUMBERS BUT IT'S NOT   

03:42:07.732 --> 03:42:08.532
THERE'S A SECTION WHERE THERE   
ARE SOME NUMBERS BUT IT'S NOT   
QUITE AS STARK AS IT WAS ON     

03:42:08.534 --> 03:42:11.001
ARE SOME NUMBERS BUT IT'S NOT   
QUITE AS STARK AS IT WAS ON

QUITE AS STARK AS IT WAS ON     
THOSE SLIDES.                   
SO MAYBE WE COULD JUST BE MORE  

03:42:12.103 --> 03:42:12.436
THOSE SLIDES.                   
SO MAYBE WE COULD JUST BE MORE  
CLEAR.

I HAVE ACTUALLY SAID NO ONE HAS

I HAVE ACTUALLY SAID NO ONE HAS 
TOLD US THE GROWTH IS GOING TO  

03:42:27.553 --> 03:42:29.820
I HAVE ACTUALLY SAID NO ONE HAS 
TOLD US THE GROWTH IS GOING TO  
BE WE ARE CREATING A

TOLD US THE GROWTH IS GOING TO  
BE WE ARE CREATING A            
ENVIRONMENT WHERE GROWTH CAN    

03:42:30.556 --> 03:42:34.057
BE WE ARE CREATING A            
ENVIRONMENT WHERE GROWTH CAN    
OCCUR AND IF IT OCCURRED AT     

03:42:34.059 --> 03:42:34.991
ENVIRONMENT WHERE GROWTH CAN    
OCCUR AND IF IT OCCURRED AT     
IT'S SORT OF LOW IN PROJECTIONS 

03:42:34.993 --> 03:42:37.727
OCCUR AND IF IT OCCURRED AT     
IT'S SORT OF LOW IN PROJECTIONS 
IT WOULD PRODUCE THIS IF IT     

03:42:37.729 --> 03:42:38.595
IT'S SORT OF LOW IN PROJECTIONS 
IT WOULD PRODUCE THIS IF IT

SO WE CAN GO THROUGH THESE      

03:44:18.863 --> 03:44:19.629
WERE NOT AS CONSEQUENTIAL.      
SO WE CAN GO THROUGH THESE

DISTRICT RIGHT WHERE WE HAD     
BEEN PERMITTING THAT AND THEN   
HAVE SINCE DECIDED TO HAVE

DISCUSSION KICK US OFF IF       
THAT'S OK.                      
I THINK ONE OF THE OBSERVATIONS 

03:45:55.294 --> 03:45:59.162
THAT'S OK.                      
I THINK ONE OF THE OBSERVATIONS 
I'VE HAD IS HOUSING THIS        

03:45:59.164 --> 03:46:00.196
I THINK ONE OF THE OBSERVATIONS 
I'VE HAD IS HOUSING THIS        
SUBMITTED AND A LOT MORE ZONES  

03:46:00.198 --> 03:46:02.632
I'VE HAD IS HOUSING THIS        
SUBMITTED AND A LOT MORE ZONES  
THAN THE AVERAGE RESIDENT OR    

03:46:02.634 --> 03:46:06.269
SUBMITTED AND A LOT MORE ZONES  
THAN THE AVERAGE RESIDENT OR    
SORT OF TRAVELER IN THE CITY

SORT OF TRAVELER IN THE CITY    
UNDERSTANDS.                    
SO OFFICE FOR INSTANCE PERMITS  

03:46:07.606 --> 03:46:11.107
UNDERSTANDS.                    
SO OFFICE FOR INSTANCE PERMITS  
HOUSING THE C DISTRICTS PERMIT  

03:46:11.109 --> 03:46:14.911
SO OFFICE FOR INSTANCE PERMITS  
HOUSING THE C DISTRICTS PERMIT  
HOUSING SO THE IDEA THAT EVEN   

03:46:14.913 --> 03:46:18.548
HOUSING THE C DISTRICTS PERMIT  
HOUSING SO THE IDEA THAT EVEN   
IN THOSE ZONES HOUSING WOULD    

03:46:18.550 --> 03:46:19.483
HOUSING SO THE IDEA THAT EVEN   
IN THOSE ZONES HOUSING WOULD    
WHEN WE'RE FINDING THAT NOT TO  

03:46:19.485 --> 03:46:22.886
IN THOSE ZONES HOUSING WOULD    
WHEN WE'RE FINDING THAT NOT TO  
BE TRUE IN THE BUILT            

03:46:22.888 --> 03:46:26.756
WHEN WE'RE FINDING THAT NOT TO

ENVIRONMENT AND SO IT MAY I     

03:46:26.758 --> 03:46:30.593

03:49:15.527 --> 03:49:16.559
THAN IT HAD BEEN SO THAT THAT   
FEELS GOOD.                     
>> I THINK WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO 

03:49:16.561 --> 03:49:18.694
FEELS GOOD.                     
>> I THINK WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO 
ARGUE ABOUT THE THE POINT THAT  

03:49:18.696 --> 03:49:19.429
>> I THINK WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO 
ARGUE ABOUT THE THE POINT THAT  
JUST CAME UP SO WE'LL JUST      

03:49:19.431 --> 03:49:22.365
ARGUE ABOUT THE THE POINT THAT  
JUST CAME UP SO WE'LL JUST      
ARGUE ABOUT UM AND I THINK      

03:49:22.367 --> 03:49:25.902
JUST CAME UP SO WE'LL JUST      
ARGUE ABOUT UM AND I THINK      
WE'VE HEARD FEEDBACK ABOUT THE  

03:49:25.904 --> 03:49:26.536
ARGUE ABOUT UM AND I THINK      
WE'VE HEARD FEEDBACK ABOUT THE  
UNCLARITY OF THE FLECK'S        

03:49:26.538 --> 03:49:30.273
WE'VE HEARD FEEDBACK ABOUT THE  
UNCLARITY OF THE FLECK'S        
DISTRICT BEFORE AND SO I THINK  

03:49:30.275 --> 03:49:31.073
UNCLARITY OF THE FLECK'S        
DISTRICT BEFORE AND SO I THINK  
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE     

03:49:31.075 --> 03:49:34.143
DISTRICT BEFORE AND SO I THINK  
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE     
SOME CLARIFICATION THAT I THINK 

03:49:34.145 --> 03:49:34.877
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE     
SOME CLARIFICATION THAT I THINK 
THERE WILL BE DISAGREEMENT AT   

03:49:34.879 --> 03:49:35.678
SOME CLARIFICATION THAT I THINK 
THERE WILL BE DISAGREEMENT AT   
THIS TABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT  

03:49:35.680 --> 03:49:38.381
THERE WILL BE DISAGREEMENT AT   
THIS TABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT  
SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT INCLUDE    

03:49:38.383 --> 03:49:38.982
THIS TABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT

03:49:38.984 --> 03:49:42.519
SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT INCLUDE

WE'LL JUST ALL SAY WHAT WE WANT

AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S OK.        
WE'LL JUST ALL SAY WHAT WE WANT

THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN TAKE A

>> WELL, FOR NOW WE'RE JUST     
SHARING STUFF THAT WHEN WE GET  
TO THAT PART OF THE PLAN WE CAN

SHARING STUFF THAT WHEN WE GET  
TO THAT PART OF THE PLAN WE CAN 
BRING THESE BACK IN OR DISCUSS  

03:49:59.871 --> 03:50:00.270
TO THAT PART OF THE PLAN WE CAN 
BRING THESE BACK IN OR DISCUSS  
IT THEN.                        

03:50:00.272 --> 03:50:01.504
BRING THESE BACK IN OR DISCUSS  
IT THEN.                        
BUT I DID WANT TO I BELIEVE     

03:50:01.506 --> 03:50:04.673
IT THEN.                        
BUT I DID WANT TO I BELIEVE     
EARLIER THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR 

03:50:04.675 --> 03:50:05.375
BUT I DID WANT TO I BELIEVE     
EARLIER THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR 
WHEN WE DO DIVERGE FROM STUFF   

03:50:05.377 --> 03:50:08.377
EARLIER THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR 
WHEN WE DO DIVERGE FROM STUFF   
OPINION THAT YOU ARE MADE AWARE 

03:50:08.379 --> 03:50:08.645
WHEN WE DO DIVERGE FROM STUFF   
OPINION THAT YOU ARE MADE AWARE 
OF THAT.                        

03:50:08.647 --> 03:50:09.512
OPINION THAT YOU ARE MADE AWARE 
OF THAT.                        
SO I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW     

03:50:09.514 --> 03:50:09.912
OF THAT.                        
SO I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW     
ABOUT THAT.                     

03:50:09.914 --> 03:50:11.848
SO I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW     
ABOUT THAT.                     
UM, IF YOU SCROLL UP TO SYSTEMS 

03:50:11.850 --> 03:50:15.418
ABOUT THAT.                     
UM, IF YOU SCROLL UP TO SYSTEMS 
PLANNING, I GET THIS IS SORT    

03:50:15.420 --> 03:50:16.218
UM, IF YOU SCROLL UP TO SYSTEMS 
PLANNING, I GET THIS IS SORT    
OF A POINT OF DIVERGING BUT I   

03:50:16.220 --> 03:50:19.222
PLANNING, I GET THIS IS SORT    
OF A POINT OF DIVERGING BUT I   
THINK WE HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED 

03:50:19.224 --> 03:50:19.688
OF A POINT OF DIVERGING BUT I   
THINK WE HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED 
SOME OF THIS.                   

03:50:19.690 --> 03:50:23.593
THINK WE HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED 
SOME OF THIS.                   
THERE IS CONCERN THAT WE HAVE   

03:50:23.595 --> 03:50:27.296
SOME OF THIS.                   
THERE IS CONCERN THAT WE HAVE   
NOT STATED CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT  

03:50:27.298 --> 03:50:28.131
THERE IS CONCERN THAT WE HAVE   
NOT STATED CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT  
WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO ROLL BACK 

03:50:28.133 --> 03:50:30.900
NOT STATED CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT  
WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO ROLL BACK 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND   

03:50:30.902 --> 03:50:31.868
WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO ROLL BACK 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND   
SO WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT UM,   

03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:35.171
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND   
SO WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT UM,   
THERE IS A SECTION IN STRATEGY  

03:50:35.173 --> 03:50:35.972
SO WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT UM,   
THERE IS A SECTION IN STRATEGY  
TEN POINT ONE THAT INTRODUCING  

03:50:35.974 --> 03:50:39.042
THERE IS A SECTION IN STRATEGY  
TEN POINT ONE THAT INTRODUCING  
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO SITE REVIEW 

03:50:39.044 --> 03:50:39.709
TEN POINT ONE THAT INTRODUCING  
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO SITE REVIEW 
WILL HELP ENSURE ECOSYSTEM      

03:50:39.711 --> 03:50:43.379
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO SITE REVIEW 
WILL HELP ENSURE ECOSYSTEM      
BENEFITS AND DOESN'T SEEM LIKE  

03:50:43.381 --> 03:50:44.147
WILL HELP ENSURE ECOSYSTEM      
BENEFITS AND DOESN'T SEEM LIKE  
THEY'RE BUYING THAT THEY THINK  

03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:47.349
BENEFITS AND DOESN'T SEEM LIKE  
THEY'RE BUYING THAT THEY THINK  
THAT MORE FLEXIBILITY COULD     

03:50:47.351 --> 03:50:48.084
THEY'RE BUYING THAT THEY THINK  
THAT MORE FLEXIBILITY COULD     
DEGRADE NATURAL FEATURES RATHER 

03:50:48.086 --> 03:50:50.419
THAT MORE FLEXIBILITY COULD     
DEGRADE NATURAL FEATURES RATHER 
THAN PROTECT THEM.              

03:50:50.421 --> 03:50:51.554
DEGRADE NATURAL FEATURES RATHER 
THAN PROTECT THEM.              
SO THEY WANTED TO BRING THAT TO 

03:50:51.556 --> 03:50:53.989
THAN PROTECT THEM.              
SO THEY WANTED TO BRING THAT TO 
OUR ATTENTION.                  

03:50:53.991 --> 03:50:55.157
SO THEY WANTED TO BRING THAT TO 
OUR ATTENTION.                  
WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY AND WHAT   

03:50:55.159 --> 03:50:58.294
OUR ATTENTION.                  
WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY AND WHAT   
DO WE MEAN BY MORE FLEXIBILITY  

03:50:58.296 --> 03:51:01.263
WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY AND WHAT   
DO WE MEAN BY MORE FLEXIBILITY  
TO SITE PLAN REVIEW?            

03:51:01.265 --> 03:51:02.332
DO WE MEAN BY MORE FLEXIBILITY  
TO SITE PLAN REVIEW?            
>> I THINK I REMEMBER PART      

03:51:02.334 --> 03:51:05.001
TO SITE PLAN REVIEW?            
>> I THINK I REMEMBER PART      
OF THAT CONVERSATION BUT I      

03:51:05.003 --> 03:51:06.002
>> I THINK I REMEMBER PART      
OF THAT CONVERSATION BUT I      
THINK IT WAS TRYING TO ACTUALLY 

03:51:06.004 --> 03:51:09.205
OF THAT CONVERSATION BUT I      
THINK IT WAS TRYING TO ACTUALLY 
BRING NATURAL FEATURES TO THE   

03:51:09.207 --> 03:51:09.872
THINK IT WAS TRYING TO ACTUALLY 
BRING NATURAL FEATURES TO THE   
BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS.       

03:51:09.874 --> 03:51:10.206
BRING NATURAL FEATURES TO THE   
BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS.       
RIGHT.                          

03:51:10.208 --> 03:51:13.409
BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS.       
RIGHT.                          
AND HAVING MORE FLEXIBILITY SO  

03:51:13.411 --> 03:51:14.243
RIGHT.                          
AND HAVING MORE FLEXIBILITY SO  
THAT THOSE ARE SEEN AS A        

03:51:14.245 --> 03:51:17.813
AND HAVING MORE FLEXIBILITY SO  
THAT THOSE ARE SEEN AS A        
PRIORITY AND BRINGING IT TO THE 

03:51:17.815 --> 03:51:18.481
THAT THOSE ARE SEEN AS A        
PRIORITY AND BRINGING IT TO THE 
FOREFRONT OF THEIR MIND WHEN    

03:51:18.483 --> 03:51:21.350
PRIORITY AND BRINGING IT TO THE 
FOREFRONT OF THEIR MIND WHEN    
THEY'RE DEVELOPING.             

03:51:21.352 --> 03:51:22.018
FOREFRONT OF THEIR MIND WHEN    
THEY'RE DEVELOPING.             
IS THAT SOUND RIGHT?            

03:51:22.020 --> 03:51:22.351
THEY'RE DEVELOPING.             
IS THAT SOUND RIGHT?            
RIGHT.                          

03:51:22.353 --> 03:51:25.888
IS THAT SOUND RIGHT?            
RIGHT.                          
YEAH, I THINK THERE WAS ALSO A  

03:51:25.890 --> 03:51:29.325
RIGHT.                          
YEAH, I THINK THERE WAS ALSO A  
BIT OF TIME CONVERSATION ABOUT  

03:51:29.327 --> 03:51:29.926
YEAH, I THINK THERE WAS ALSO A  
BIT OF TIME CONVERSATION ABOUT  
WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE          

03:51:29.928 --> 03:51:30.593
BIT OF TIME CONVERSATION ABOUT  
WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE          
PROTECTING THE RIGHT THINGS     

03:51:30.595 --> 03:51:32.995
WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE          
PROTECTING THE RIGHT THINGS     
LIKE YOU MAY RECALL LIKE WITH   

03:51:32.997 --> 03:51:36.399
PROTECTING THE RIGHT THINGS     
LIKE YOU MAY RECALL LIKE WITH   
THE PACKAGE PROPERTY FOR        

03:51:36.401 --> 03:51:37.333
LIKE YOU MAY RECALL LIKE WITH   
THE PACKAGE PROPERTY FOR        
EXAMPLE, WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT  

03:51:37.335 --> 03:51:38.068
THE PACKAGE PROPERTY FOR        
EXAMPLE, WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT  
NOT ONLY THE LANDMARK TREES     

03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:40.870
EXAMPLE, WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT  
NOT ONLY THE LANDMARK TREES     
THERE BUT ALSO LIKE SORT OF A   

03:51:40.872 --> 03:51:41.504
NOT ONLY THE LANDMARK TREES     
THERE BUT ALSO LIKE SORT OF A   
MAINTENANCE PLAN THAT WOULD     

03:51:41.506 --> 03:51:44.440
THERE BUT ALSO LIKE SORT OF A   
MAINTENANCE PLAN THAT WOULD     
REALLY CULTIVATE THE NATURALIZE 

03:51:44.442 --> 03:51:45.107
MAINTENANCE PLAN THAT WOULD     
REALLY CULTIVATE THE NATURALIZE 
AREA AROUND THOSE LANDMARK      

03:51:45.109 --> 03:51:48.044
REALLY CULTIVATE THE NATURALIZE 
AREA AROUND THOSE LANDMARK      
AREAS.                          

03:51:48.046 --> 03:51:49.079
AREA AROUND THOSE LANDMARK      
AREAS.                          
SO I I INTERPRET THE            

03:51:49.081 --> 03:51:51.881
AREAS.                          
SO I I INTERPRET THE            
FLEXIBILITY A LITTLE LESS THAN  

03:51:51.883 --> 03:51:52.549
SO I I INTERPRET THE            
FLEXIBILITY A LITTLE LESS THAN  
THE PROCESS RELATED STUFF BUT   

03:51:52.551 --> 03:51:55.618
FLEXIBILITY A LITTLE LESS THAN  
THE PROCESS RELATED STUFF BUT   
MAYBE NATURAL FEATURES IS       

03:51:55.620 --> 03:51:59.321
THE PROCESS RELATED STUFF BUT   
MAYBE NATURAL FEATURES IS       
REALLY CONSTRAINED ORDINANCES.  

03:51:59.323 --> 03:51:59.722
MAYBE NATURAL FEATURES IS       
REALLY CONSTRAINED ORDINANCES.  
RIGHT?                          

03:51:59.724 --> 03:52:00.789
REALLY CONSTRAINED ORDINANCES.  
RIGHT?                          
WE DEFINE IT AND YOU'VE GOT TO  

03:52:00.791 --> 03:52:01.591
RIGHT?                          
WE DEFINE IT AND YOU'VE GOT TO  
MITIGATE IT IF IT MEETS THESE   

03:52:01.593 --> 03:52:03.593
WE DEFINE IT AND YOU'VE GOT TO  
MITIGATE IT IF IT MEETS THESE   
DEFINITIONS AND WE HEARD        

03:52:03.595 --> 03:52:04.260
MITIGATE IT IF IT MEETS THESE   
DEFINITIONS AND WE HEARD        
PARTICULARLY FROM THE FOCUS     

03:52:04.262 --> 03:52:07.930
DEFINITIONS AND WE HEARD        
PARTICULARLY FROM THE FOCUS     
GROUP THAT NOT ALL TREES ARE    

03:52:07.932 --> 03:52:11.767
PARTICULARLY FROM THE FOCUS     
GROUP THAT NOT ALL TREES ARE    
REALLY HAVE THE SAME ECOLOGICAL 

03:52:11.769 --> 03:52:12.101
GROUP THAT NOT ALL TREES ARE    
REALLY HAVE THE SAME ECOLOGICAL 
VALUE.                          

03:52:12.103 --> 03:52:15.839
REALLY HAVE THE SAME ECOLOGICAL 
VALUE.                          
SO THAT'S HOW I INTERPRET IT.   

03:52:15.841 --> 03:52:16.773
VALUE.                          
SO THAT'S HOW I INTERPRET IT.   
BUT TO BE CLEAR, THE PLAN       

03:52:16.775 --> 03:52:19.308
SO THAT'S HOW I INTERPRET IT.   
BUT TO BE CLEAR, THE PLAN       
DOESN'T GET INTO MUCH MORE      

03:52:19.310 --> 03:52:20.109
BUT TO BE CLEAR, THE PLAN       
DOESN'T GET INTO MUCH MORE      
DEFINITION OR GRANULARITY THAN  

03:52:20.111 --> 03:52:22.344
DOESN'T GET INTO MUCH MORE      
DEFINITION OR GRANULARITY THAN  
THAT.                           

03:52:22.346 --> 03:52:23.012
DEFINITION OR GRANULARITY THAN  
THAT.                           
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE           

03:52:23.014 --> 03:52:23.812
THAT.                           
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE           
FLEXIBILITY IS THE RIGHT WORD   

03:52:23.814 --> 03:52:24.080
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE           
FLEXIBILITY IS THE RIGHT WORD   
EXACTLY.                        

03:52:24.082 --> 03:52:27.683
FLEXIBILITY IS THE RIGHT WORD   
EXACTLY.                        
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING.     

03:52:27.685 --> 03:52:30.619
EXACTLY.                        
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING.     
IF IT'S AN IDEA THAT NATURAL    

03:52:30.621 --> 03:52:34.089
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING.     
IF IT'S AN IDEA THAT NATURAL    
FEATURES SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO   

03:52:34.091 --> 03:52:34.858
IF IT'S AN IDEA THAT NATURAL    
FEATURES SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO   
THE FOREFRONT OF THE DEVELOPERS 

03:52:34.860 --> 03:52:38.294
FEATURES SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO   
THE FOREFRONT OF THE DEVELOPERS 
MIND EARLIER IN THE PROCESS,    

03:52:38.296 --> 03:52:39.128
THE FOREFRONT OF THE DEVELOPERS 
MIND EARLIER IN THE PROCESS,    
THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS          

03:52:39.130 --> 03:52:42.565
MIND EARLIER IN THE PROCESS,    
THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS          
FLEXIBILITY AND MEAN IF THERE   

03:52:42.567 --> 03:52:43.399
THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS          
FLEXIBILITY AND MEAN IF THERE   
ARE THINGS THAT ARE KIND        

03:52:43.401 --> 03:52:46.835
FLEXIBILITY AND MEAN IF THERE   
ARE THINGS THAT ARE KIND        
OF RIGID AND THINGS THAT ARE    

03:52:46.837 --> 03:52:49.672
ARE THINGS THAT ARE KIND        
OF RIGID AND THINGS THAT ARE    
DESIRABLE BUT FALLING OUTSIDE   

03:52:49.674 --> 03:52:53.209
OF RIGID AND THINGS THAT ARE    
DESIRABLE BUT FALLING OUTSIDE   
WHAT'S IN THE NATURAL FEATURES  

03:52:53.211 --> 03:52:54.343
DESIRABLE BUT FALLING OUTSIDE   
WHAT'S IN THE NATURAL FEATURES  
THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY     

03:52:54.345 --> 03:52:54.944
WHAT'S IN THE NATURAL FEATURES  
THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY     
OF EXPRESSING THAT THEN         

03:52:54.946 --> 03:52:58.648
THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY     
OF EXPRESSING THAT THEN         
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR 

03:52:58.650 --> 03:53:01.483
OF EXPRESSING THAT THEN         
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR 
FLEXIBILITY I THINK OH WE HAVE  

03:53:01.485 --> 03:53:02.252
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR 
FLEXIBILITY I THINK OH WE HAVE  
STANDARDS BUT YOU KNOW, WE'LL   

03:53:02.254 --> 03:53:02.785
FLEXIBILITY I THINK OH WE HAVE  
STANDARDS BUT YOU KNOW, WE'LL   
BURN THEM FOR YOU.              

03:53:02.787 --> 03:53:05.321
STANDARDS BUT YOU KNOW, WE'LL   
BURN THEM FOR YOU.              
YOU KNOW?                       

03:53:05.323 --> 03:53:06.322
BURN THEM FOR YOU.              
YOU KNOW?                       
AND SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE    

03:53:06.324 --> 03:53:08.958
YOU KNOW?                       
AND SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE    
WHY THIS IS A SORT OF ANXIOUS   

03:53:08.960 --> 03:53:09.425
AND SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE    
WHY THIS IS A SORT OF ANXIOUS   
SOUNDING RESPONSE.              

03:53:09.427 --> 03:53:10.759
WHY THIS IS A SORT OF ANXIOUS   
SOUNDING RESPONSE.              
AND SO AGAIN, I JUST THINK IT'S 

03:53:10.761 --> 03:53:13.195
SOUNDING RESPONSE.              
AND SO AGAIN, I JUST THINK IT'S 
A PROBLEM OF MISUNDERSTAND WHAT 

03:53:13.197 --> 03:53:17.233
AND SO AGAIN, I JUST THINK IT'S 
A PROBLEM OF MISUNDERSTAND WHAT 
IT FELT LIKE AS I'M READING     

03:53:17.235 --> 03:53:18.334
A PROBLEM OF MISUNDERSTAND WHAT 
IT FELT LIKE AS I'M READING     
THIS IN THE I'M READING DOWN A

IT FELT LIKE AS I'M READING     
THIS IN THE I'M READING DOWN A  
COUPLE LINES TO THE OVER

LIKE IT'S EASY TO DESIGN TO THE

IT'S EASY TO SO THAT'S WHAT

SETBACKS.                       
IT'S EASY TO SO THAT'S WHAT     
THEY FOCUS ON RIGHT.            

03:53:28.513 --> 03:53:29.445
IT'S EASY TO SO THAT'S WHAT     
THEY FOCUS ON RIGHT.            
>> I HAVE TO MEET THOSE         

03:53:29.447 --> 03:53:30.246
THEY FOCUS ON RIGHT.            
>> I HAVE TO MEET THOSE

03:53:32.583 --> 03:53:33.515
SETBACKS WHERE AT LEAST THE WAY 
THAT I TOOK THIS POTENTIALLY    
AND MAYBE I'M JUST THINKING     

03:53:33.517 --> 03:53:36.919
THAT I TOOK THIS POTENTIALLY    
AND MAYBE I'M JUST THINKING     
OF OUR OLD PROJECT PLAN PROJECT 

03:53:36.921 --> 03:53:40.322
AND MAYBE I'M JUST THINKING     
OF OUR OLD PROJECT PLAN PROJECT 
MODIFICATION WHERE YOU ACTUALLY 

03:53:40.324 --> 03:53:41.257
OF OUR OLD PROJECT PLAN PROJECT 
MODIFICATION WHERE YOU ACTUALLY 
THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY AND  

03:53:41.259 --> 03:53:44.627
MODIFICATION WHERE YOU ACTUALLY 
THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY AND  
THOSE INTENTIONAL SET BACK      

03:53:44.629 --> 03:53:45.294
THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY AND  
THOSE INTENTIONAL SET BACK      
STANDARDS IF IT MEANT           

03:53:45.296 --> 03:53:48.798
THOSE INTENTIONAL SET BACK      
STANDARDS IF IT MEANT           
PRIORITIZE HOUSING REALLY GOOD  

03:53:48.800 --> 03:53:49.598
STANDARDS IF IT MEANT           
PRIORITIZE HOUSING REALLY GOOD  
YOU KNOW, REALLY GOOD NATURAL   

03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:52.802
PRIORITIZE HOUSING REALLY GOOD  
YOU KNOW, REALLY GOOD NATURAL   
FEATURES AND SO THAT'S IF THAT  

03:53:52.804 --> 03:53:53.536
YOU KNOW, REALLY GOOD NATURAL   
FEATURES AND SO THAT'S IF THAT  
WAS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE

FEATURES AND SO THAT'S IF THAT  
WAS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE    
WAY THAT WAS WRITTEN.           

03:53:55.740 --> 03:53:58.774
WAS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE    
WAY THAT WAS WRITTEN.           
I THINK THAT'S WHY I THINK      

03:53:58.776 --> 03:54:02.712
WAY THAT WAS WRITTEN.           
I THINK THAT'S WHY I THINK      
THAT'S GOOD ABOUT SO THEN IT    

03:54:02.714 --> 03:54:03.446
I THINK THAT'S WHY I THINK      
THAT'S GOOD ABOUT SO THEN IT    
WOULD BE FLEXIBILITY IN THINGS  

03:54:03.448 --> 03:54:06.548
THAT'S GOOD ABOUT SO THEN IT    
WOULD BE FLEXIBILITY IN THINGS  
LIKE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS      

03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:10.553
WOULD BE FLEXIBILITY IN THINGS  
LIKE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS      
WHERE BENEFICIAL PROTECTION     

03:54:10.555 --> 03:54:14.423
LIKE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS      
WHERE BENEFICIAL PROTECTION     
OF NATURAL FEATURES THAT AGAIN  

03:54:14.425 --> 03:54:15.291
WHERE BENEFICIAL PROTECTION     
OF NATURAL FEATURES THAT AGAIN  
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WE WOULD   

03:54:15.293 --> 03:54:18.595
OF NATURAL FEATURES THAT AGAIN  
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WE WOULD   
NOT WANT TO PUT IN IF YOU KNOW  

03:54:18.597 --> 03:54:19.328
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WE WOULD   
NOT WANT TO PUT IN IF YOU KNOW  
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU'D    

03:54:19.330 --> 03:54:21.597
NOT WANT TO PUT IN IF YOU KNOW  
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU'D    
WRITE THAT DOWN.

THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU'D    
WRITE THAT DOWN.

LIKE MAYBE I MEAN I IMAGINE     
THAT MOST OF THE THINGS THAT WE

LIKE MAYBE I MEAN I IMAGINE     
THAT MOST OF THE THINGS THAT WE 
COME OUT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION  

03:56:31.829 --> 03:56:32.595
THAT MOST OF THE THINGS THAT WE 
COME OUT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION  
MATRIX ARE LIKE THIS IS WHAT    

03:56:32.597 --> 03:56:35.765
COME OUT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION  
MATRIX ARE LIKE THIS IS WHAT    
THE UDC NEEDS TO SAY BUT THERE  

03:56:35.767 --> 03:56:36.632
MATRIX ARE LIKE THIS IS WHAT    
THE UDC NEEDS TO SAY BUT THERE  
ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE'VE      

03:56:36.634 --> 03:56:37.300
THE UDC NEEDS TO SAY BUT THERE  
ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE'VE      
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT,           

03:56:37.302 --> 03:56:37.900
ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE'VE      
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT,           
PARTICULARLY IN ECONOMIC        

03:56:37.902 --> 03:56:40.335
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT,           
PARTICULARLY IN ECONOMIC        
DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE NOT US OR  

03:56:40.337 --> 03:56:40.837
PARTICULARLY IN ECONOMIC        
DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE NOT US OR  
INFRASTRUCTURE STUFF.

INFRASTRUCTURE STUFF.           
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY US.           
AND SO THAT'S ONE WAY THAT YOU  

03:56:45.075 --> 03:56:47.910
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY US.           
AND SO THAT'S ONE WAY THAT YOU  
CAN KIND OF SQUARE THAT.        

03:56:47.912 --> 03:56:50.746
AND SO THAT'S ONE WAY THAT YOU  
CAN KIND OF SQUARE THAT.        
SO WHAT IF FOR NOW WE DISCUSS   

03:56:50.748 --> 03:56:51.680
CAN KIND OF SQUARE THAT.        
SO WHAT IF FOR NOW WE DISCUSS   
AMONG STAFF WHAT WE MEAN BY     

03:56:51.682 --> 03:56:55.117
SO WHAT IF FOR NOW WE DISCUSS   
AMONG STAFF WHAT WE MEAN BY     
FLEXIBILITY SO THAT CAN BE

04:00:51.422 --> 04:00:52.355
AND NON MOTORIZED MOTOR         
FLEXIBILITY AND ADEQUACY.       
SO I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY     

04:00:52.357 --> 04:00:55.824
FLEXIBILITY AND ADEQUACY.       
SO I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY     
GETTING TOWARDS AS A PATTERN    

04:00:55.826 --> 04:00:56.392
SO I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY     
GETTING TOWARDS AS A PATTERN    
OF DEVELOPMENT GOES UP.         

04:00:56.394 --> 04:00:59.929
GETTING TOWARDS AS A PATTERN    
OF DEVELOPMENT GOES UP.         
>> UM, IT'S NOT ALWAYS BUT IT'S 

04:00:59.931 --> 04:01:03.933
OF DEVELOPMENT GOES UP.         
>> UM, IT'S NOT ALWAYS BUT IT'S 
EASIER TO ACCOMMODATE A SOLID   

04:01:03.935 --> 04:01:06.735
>> UM, IT'S NOT ALWAYS BUT IT'S 
EASIER TO ACCOMMODATE A SOLID   
WASTE IN A PARKING LOT AS WE    

04:01:06.737 --> 04:01:07.636
EASIER TO ACCOMMODATE A SOLID   
WASTE IN A PARKING LOT AS WE    
START PLANNING FOR A DIFFERENT  

04:01:07.638 --> 04:01:08.170
WASTE IN A PARKING LOT AS WE    
START PLANNING FOR A DIFFERENT  
TYPOLOGY OF DEVELOPMENT.        

04:01:08.172 --> 04:01:10.573
START PLANNING FOR A DIFFERENT  
TYPOLOGY OF DEVELOPMENT.        
I THINK IT'S JUST RECOGNIZING   

04:01:10.575 --> 04:01:11.440
TYPOLOGY OF DEVELOPMENT.        
I THINK IT'S JUST RECOGNIZING   
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO     

04:01:11.442 --> 04:01:12.241
I THINK IT'S JUST RECOGNIZING   
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO     
FIGURE OUT WHAT TRADE OFFS ARE  

04:01:12.243 --> 04:01:14.710
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO     
FIGURE OUT WHAT TRADE OFFS ARE  
WE COMFORTABLE LIVING WITH.     

04:01:14.712 --> 04:01:15.911
FIGURE OUT WHAT TRADE OFFS ARE  
WE COMFORTABLE LIVING WITH.     
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THIS HAS     

04:01:15.913 --> 04:01:19.081
WE COMFORTABLE LIVING WITH.     
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THIS HAS     
HAPPENED YOU'VE HEARD A LOT     

04:01:19.083 --> 04:01:19.749
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THIS HAS     
HAPPENED YOU'VE HEARD A LOT     
OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TRASH    

04:01:19.751 --> 04:01:22.151
HAPPENED YOU'VE HEARD A LOT     
OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TRASH    
BINS AND BIKE LANES ACROSS THE  

04:01:22.153 --> 04:01:22.618
OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TRASH    
BINS AND BIKE LANES ACROSS THE  
COMMUNITY.                      

04:01:22.620 --> 04:01:23.285
BINS AND BIKE LANES ACROSS THE  
COMMUNITY.                      
THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF TRADE 

04:01:23.287 --> 04:01:23.618
COMMUNITY.                      
THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF TRADE 
OFFS.                           

04:01:23.620 --> 04:01:23.953
THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF TRADE 
OFFS.                           
RIGHT.

OFFS.                           
RIGHT.                          
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT THE     

04:01:25.756 --> 04:01:29.725
RIGHT.                          
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT THE     
WAYS THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS WE    

04:01:29.727 --> 04:01:30.425
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT THE     
WAYS THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS WE    
CAN ALWAYS SOLVE FOR            

04:01:30.427 --> 04:01:30.860
WAYS THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS WE    
CAN ALWAYS SOLVE FOR            
EVERYTHING.                     

04:01:30.862 --> 04:01:31.460
CAN ALWAYS SOLVE FOR            
EVERYTHING.                     
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOMETIMES   

04:01:31.462 --> 04:01:34.029
EVERYTHING.                     
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOMETIMES   
MAKE OUT LITTLE PROGRESS IN ONE 

04:01:34.031 --> 04:01:34.796
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOMETIMES   
MAKE OUT LITTLE PROGRESS IN ONE 
REGARD IT'S GOING TO COMPROMISE 

04:01:34.798 --> 04:01:37.599
MAKE OUT LITTLE PROGRESS IN ONE 
REGARD IT'S GOING TO COMPROMISE 
OUR PROGRESS AND ANOTHER.       

04:01:37.601 --> 04:01:38.634
REGARD IT'S GOING TO COMPROMISE 
OUR PROGRESS AND ANOTHER.       
SO I THINK THIS IS AGAIN I WANT 

04:01:38.636 --> 04:01:41.570
OUR PROGRESS AND ANOTHER.       
SO I THINK THIS IS AGAIN I WANT 
TO SPEAK TO A COMMENTER BUT     

04:01:41.572 --> 04:01:42.238
SO I THINK THIS IS AGAIN I WANT 
TO SPEAK TO A COMMENTER BUT     
IT'S PROBABLY TALKING MORE SO   

04:01:42.240 --> 04:01:43.038
TO SPEAK TO A COMMENTER BUT     
IT'S PROBABLY TALKING MORE SO   
ABOUT WE'RE DEALING WITH MORE   

04:01:43.040 --> 04:01:45.741
IT'S PROBABLY TALKING MORE SO   
ABOUT WE'RE DEALING WITH MORE   
AND MORE PROJECTS THAT DON'T    

04:01:45.743 --> 04:01:46.409
ABOUT WE'RE DEALING WITH MORE   
AND MORE PROJECTS THAT DON'T    
HAVE BIG SURFACE PARKING LOTS   

04:01:46.411 --> 04:01:47.209
AND MORE PROJECTS THAT DON'T    
HAVE BIG SURFACE PARKING LOTS   
THAT CAN CREATE A CHALLENGE FOR 

04:01:47.211 --> 04:01:49.111
HAVE BIG SURFACE PARKING LOTS   
THAT CAN CREATE A CHALLENGE FOR 
US IN THESE TRADE OFFS.         

04:01:49.113 --> 04:01:50.278
THAT CAN CREATE A CHALLENGE FOR 
US IN THESE TRADE OFFS.         
>> WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE  

04:01:50.280 --> 04:01:51.346
US IN THESE TRADE OFFS.         
>> WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE  
WANT TO ACCOUNT FOR IT IN TERMS

RIGHT.                          
DO WE NEED DIFFERENT TYPES

04:01:54.551 --> 04:01:56.652
DO WE NEED DIFFERENT TYPES      
OF VEHICLES?                    
THANK YOU THAT I WAS GOING SEE  

04:01:56.654 --> 04:01:56.986
OF VEHICLES?                    
THANK YOU THAT I WAS GOING SEE  
MY POINT.                       

04:01:56.988 --> 04:01:58.053
THANK YOU THAT I WAS GOING SEE  
MY POINT.                       
I THINK I THINK A LOT OF WHAT   

04:01:58.055 --> 04:02:00.489
MY POINT.                       
I THINK I THINK A LOT OF WHAT   
I'M HEARING IS WE HAVE DECIDED  

04:02:00.491 --> 04:02:04.193
I THINK I THINK A LOT OF WHAT   
I'M HEARING IS WE HAVE DECIDED  
ON A TRYING TO MAKE THIS MORE   

04:02:04.195 --> 04:02:07.629
I'M HEARING IS WE HAVE DECIDED  
ON A TRYING TO MAKE THIS MORE   
ABSTRACT BUT THE SORT OF TYPE   

04:02:07.631 --> 04:02:11.233
ON A TRYING TO MAKE THIS MORE   
ABSTRACT BUT THE SORT OF TYPE   
OF HOW WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM  

04:02:11.235 --> 04:02:11.567
ABSTRACT BUT THE SORT OF TYPE   
OF HOW WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM  
.                               

04:02:11.569 --> 04:02:12.501
OF HOW WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM  
.                               
SO AGAIN GOING ACTUALLY BACK TO 

04:02:12.503 --> 04:02:14.437
.                               
SO AGAIN GOING ACTUALLY BACK TO 
THE ROBINSON BROTHERS, THE FIRE 

04:02:14.439 --> 04:02:15.303
SO AGAIN GOING ACTUALLY BACK TO 
THE ROBINSON BROTHERS, THE FIRE 
DEPARTMENT REQUIRED A SECOND    

04:02:15.305 --> 04:02:18.440
THE ROBINSON BROTHERS, THE FIRE 
DEPARTMENT REQUIRED A SECOND    
ENTRANCE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE    

04:02:18.442 --> 04:02:19.407
DEPARTMENT REQUIRED A SECOND    
ENTRANCE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE    
THE ENGINE AND THEN IT ALSO     

04:02:19.409 --> 04:02:22.644
ENTRANCE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE    
THE ENGINE AND THEN IT ALSO     
REQUIRED THAT THEY PUT IN FIRE  

04:02:22.646 --> 04:02:23.378
THE ENGINE AND THEN IT ALSO     
REQUIRED THAT THEY PUT IN FIRE  
SUPPRESSION AND ALL OF THE      

04:02:23.380 --> 04:02:26.648
REQUIRED THAT THEY PUT IN FIRE  
SUPPRESSION AND ALL OF THE      
UNITS WHICH INCREASE THE COST   

04:02:26.650 --> 04:02:27.316
SUPPRESSION AND ALL OF THE      
UNITS WHICH INCREASE THE COST   
BUT ALTERNATIVES THERE COULD    

04:02:27.318 --> 04:02:30.452
UNITS WHICH INCREASE THE COST   
BUT ALTERNATIVES THERE COULD    
HAVE BEEN TO PUT A SUBSTATION   

04:02:30.454 --> 04:02:31.453
BUT ALTERNATIVES THERE COULD    
HAVE BEEN TO PUT A SUBSTATION   
RIGHT THERE AND IT WOULD HAVE   

04:02:31.455 --> 04:02:32.220
HAVE BEEN TO PUT A SUBSTATION   
RIGHT THERE AND IT WOULD HAVE   
PROBABLY BEEN ABOUT THE SAME    

04:02:32.222 --> 04:02:35.291
RIGHT THERE AND IT WOULD HAVE   
PROBABLY BEEN ABOUT THE SAME    
COST AND THEN BEEN ABLE TO      

04:02:35.293 --> 04:02:38.694
PROBABLY BEEN ABOUT THE SAME    
COST AND THEN BEEN ABLE TO      
REACH MORE PEOPLE INSIDE.       

04:02:38.696 --> 04:02:39.829
COST AND THEN BEEN ABLE TO      
REACH MORE PEOPLE INSIDE.       
BUT AS I WAS DOING THE MATH,    

04:02:39.831 --> 04:02:40.830
REACH MORE PEOPLE INSIDE.       
BUT AS I WAS DOING THE MATH,    
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE ENGINES  

04:02:40.832 --> 04:02:43.298
BUT AS I WAS DOING THE MATH,    
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE ENGINES  
IS LIKE ONE AND A HALF MILLION  

04:02:43.300 --> 04:02:44.099
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE ENGINES  
IS LIKE ONE AND A HALF MILLION  
DOLLARS SO THEY COULD HAVE JUST 

04:02:44.101 --> 04:02:46.602
IS LIKE ONE AND A HALF MILLION  
DOLLARS SO THEY COULD HAVE JUST 
KEPT IT ON THE SITE AND THEY    

04:02:46.604 --> 04:02:47.536
DOLLARS SO THEY COULD HAVE JUST 
KEPT IT ON THE SITE AND THEY    
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH  

04:02:47.538 --> 04:02:47.870
KEPT IT ON THE SITE AND THEY    
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH  
THAT.                           

04:02:47.872 --> 04:02:50.740
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH  
THAT.                           
SO HOW DO WE IN THE             

04:02:50.742 --> 04:02:54.242
THAT.                           
SO HOW DO WE IN THE             
COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE VISION   

04:02:54.244 --> 04:02:57.512
SO HOW DO WE IN THE             
COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE VISION   
SIGNAL THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE  

04:02:57.514 --> 04:02:58.313
COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE VISION   
SIGNAL THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE  
INNOVATIVE AS THE CITY GROWS    

04:02:58.315 --> 04:03:01.783
SIGNAL THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE  
INNOVATIVE AS THE CITY GROWS    
THAT THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES WE 

04:03:01.785 --> 04:03:02.852
INNOVATIVE AS THE CITY GROWS    
THAT THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES WE 
HAVE USED FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS 

04:03:02.854 --> 04:03:06.188
THAT THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES WE 
HAVE USED FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS 
MAY NOT BE THE TOOLS AND        

04:03:06.190 --> 04:03:06.889
HAVE USED FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS 
MAY NOT BE THE TOOLS AND        
RESOURCES THAT WE USE FOR THE   

04:03:06.891 --> 04:03:09.625
MAY NOT BE THE TOOLS AND        
RESOURCES THAT WE USE FOR THE   
NEXT 50 YEARS THAT              

04:03:09.627 --> 04:03:10.292
RESOURCES THAT WE USE FOR THE   
NEXT 50 YEARS THAT              
INFRASTRUCTURE COULD IMAGINE    

04:03:10.294 --> 04:03:14.062
NEXT 50 YEARS THAT              
INFRASTRUCTURE COULD IMAGINE    
EVEN SOMETHING LIKE SOLID WASTE 

04:03:14.064 --> 04:03:17.399
INFRASTRUCTURE COULD IMAGINE    
EVEN SOMETHING LIKE SOLID WASTE 
BEING IN TUBES UNDER            

04:03:17.401 --> 04:03:18.400
EVEN SOMETHING LIKE SOLID WASTE 
BEING IN TUBES UNDER            
DEVELOPMENT THAT THEN GOES TO A 

04:03:18.402 --> 04:03:21.636
BEING IN TUBES UNDER            
DEVELOPMENT THAT THEN GOES TO A 
STATION AND IS PICKED UP THERE  

04:03:21.638 --> 04:03:22.571
DEVELOPMENT THAT THEN GOES TO A 
STATION AND IS PICKED UP THERE  
AS OPPOSED TO IT'S COLLECTED IN 

04:03:22.573 --> 04:03:26.541
STATION AND IS PICKED UP THERE  
AS OPPOSED TO IT'S COLLECTED IN 
A BED AND A TRUCK COMES AND SO  

04:03:26.543 --> 04:03:26.776
AS OPPOSED TO IT'S COLLECTED IN 
A BED AND A TRUCK COMES AND SO  
FORTH.                          

04:03:26.778 --> 04:03:29.378
A BED AND A TRUCK COMES AND SO  
FORTH.                          
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAPTURE  

04:03:29.380 --> 04:03:32.781
FORTH.                          
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAPTURE  
THAT LANGUAGE IN IN THE PLAN    

04:03:32.783 --> 04:03:37.052
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAPTURE  
THAT LANGUAGE IN IN THE PLAN    
BUT THAT'S INFRASTRUCTURE.      

04:03:37.054 --> 04:03:37.953
THAT LANGUAGE IN IN THE PLAN    
BUT THAT'S INFRASTRUCTURE.      
I MEAN IT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU 

04:03:37.955 --> 04:03:40.823
BUT THAT'S INFRASTRUCTURE.      
I MEAN IT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU 
KNOW, IT'S MOVING               

04:03:40.825 --> 04:03:41.624
I MEAN IT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU 
KNOW, IT'S MOVING               
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I THINK IT'S 

04:03:41.626 --> 04:03:42.224
KNOW, IT'S MOVING               
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I THINK IT'S 
THINKING ABOUT HOW OUR          

04:03:42.226 --> 04:03:45.260
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I THINK IT'S 
THINKING ABOUT HOW OUR          
INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS AND SO WE   

04:03:45.262 --> 04:03:48.096
THINKING ABOUT HOW OUR          
INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS AND SO WE   
HAVE AN ADAPTIVE SIGNAL.        

04:03:48.098 --> 04:03:48.464
INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS AND SO WE   
HAVE AN ADAPTIVE SIGNAL.        
THANK YOU.                      

04:03:48.466 --> 04:03:51.934

THANK YOU.                      
YOU ARE TEN FOR TEN TONIGHT.

THANK YOU.                      
YOU ARE TEN FOR TEN TONIGHT.    
CAN WE HAVE AN ADAPTIVE         

04:03:53.036 --> 04:03:56.372
YOU ARE TEN FOR TEN TONIGHT.    
CAN WE HAVE AN ADAPTIVE         
APPROACH TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE  

04:03:56.374 --> 04:03:57.039
CAN WE HAVE AN ADAPTIVE         
APPROACH TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE  
TO MEET THE DENSITY GOALS THAT  

04:03:57.041 --> 04:04:00.442
APPROACH TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE  
TO MEET THE DENSITY GOALS THAT  
WE HAVE AND THAT THAT MEANS WE  

04:04:00.444 --> 04:04:01.377
TO MEET THE DENSITY GOALS THAT  
WE HAVE AND THAT THAT MEANS WE  
HAVE TO BE CREATIVE, WE HAVE TO 

04:04:01.379 --> 04:04:04.446
WE HAVE AND THAT THAT MEANS WE  
HAVE TO BE CREATIVE, WE HAVE TO 
BE INNOVATIVE AND WE HAVE TO BE 

04:04:04.448 --> 04:04:05.247
HAVE TO BE CREATIVE, WE HAVE TO 
BE INNOVATIVE AND WE HAVE TO BE 
WILLING TO LET GO OF THINGS     

04:04:05.249 --> 04:04:08.083
BE INNOVATIVE AND WE HAVE TO BE 
WILLING TO LET GO OF THINGS     
THAT HAVE WORKED HISTORICALLY   

04:04:08.085 --> 04:04:08.950
WILLING TO LET GO OF THINGS     
THAT HAVE WORKED HISTORICALLY   
AND PIONEERED NEW THINGS SO IT  

04:04:08.952 --> 04:04:12.421
THAT HAVE WORKED HISTORICALLY   
AND PIONEERED NEW THINGS SO IT  
FEELS TO ME THAT THAT GOES BACK 

04:04:12.423 --> 04:04:15.924
AND PIONEERED NEW THINGS SO IT  
FEELS TO ME THAT THAT GOES BACK 
UP INTO ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES   

04:04:15.926 --> 04:04:16.859
FEELS TO ME THAT THAT GOES BACK 
UP INTO ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES   
AND THIS IS BACK IN CHAPTER     

04:04:16.861 --> 04:04:17.059
UP INTO ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES

BECAUSE CURRENTLY WITH THE WAY  

04:11:03.633 --> 04:11:07.402
FOR US TO BE MORE PROACTIVE     
BECAUSE CURRENTLY WITH THE WAY  
STORMS ARE HEAVIER AND MORE     

04:11:07.404 --> 04:11:08.136
BECAUSE CURRENTLY WITH THE WAY  
STORMS ARE HEAVIER AND MORE     
FREQUENT THAT OUTSIDE OF FLOOD  

04:11:08.138 --> 04:11:11.206
STORMS ARE HEAVIER AND MORE     
FREQUENT THAT OUTSIDE OF FLOOD  
PLAINS ARE FLOODING NOW AS      

04:11:11.208 --> 04:11:11.539
FREQUENT THAT OUTSIDE OF FLOOD  
PLAINS ARE FLOODING NOW AS      
WELL.                           

04:11:11.541 --> 04:11:14.609
PLAINS ARE FLOODING NOW AS      
WELL.                           
AND SO THERE'S OFTEN A FOCUS ON 

04:11:14.611 --> 04:11:15.610
WELL.                           
AND SO THERE'S OFTEN A FOCUS ON 
AREAS THAT WE KNOW WILL FLOOD.  

04:11:15.612 --> 04:11:18.713
AND SO THERE'S OFTEN A FOCUS ON 
AREAS THAT WE KNOW WILL FLOOD.  
BUT WITH THE PREDICTIONS THAT   

04:11:18.715 --> 04:11:19.781
AREAS THAT WE KNOW WILL FLOOD.  
BUT WITH THE PREDICTIONS THAT   
WE THAT COME OUT OF AGENCIES    

04:11:19.783 --> 04:11:22.984
BUT WITH THE PREDICTIONS THAT   
WE THAT COME OUT OF AGENCIES    
THAT MIGHT NOT EXIST FOR MUCH   

04:11:22.986 --> 04:11:26.788
WE THAT COME OUT OF AGENCIES    
THAT MIGHT NOT EXIST FOR MUCH   
LONGER THAT UH OTHER OTHER      

04:11:26.790 --> 04:11:27.588
THAT MIGHT NOT EXIST FOR MUCH   
LONGER THAT UH OTHER OTHER      
PLACES ARE FLOODING FLOODING AS 

04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:28.356
LONGER THAT UH OTHER OTHER      
PLACES ARE FLOODING FLOODING AS 
WELL AND SO THAT WE MIGHT NEED  

04:11:28.358 --> 04:11:31.059
PLACES ARE FLOODING FLOODING AS 
WELL AND SO THAT WE MIGHT NEED  
TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. 

04:11:31.061 --> 04:11:34.162
WELL AND SO THAT WE MIGHT NEED  
TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. 
IN ADDITION, IT LINKS TO THE    

04:11:34.164 --> 04:11:34.896
TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. 
IN ADDITION, IT LINKS TO THE    
GOAL EIGHT WHICH WE TALK ABOUT  

04:11:34.898 --> 04:11:37.966
IN ADDITION, IT LINKS TO THE    
GOAL EIGHT WHICH WE TALK ABOUT  
I THINK IN CHAPTER FIVE ABOUT   

04:11:37.968 --> 04:11:38.700
GOAL EIGHT WHICH WE TALK ABOUT  
I THINK IN CHAPTER FIVE ABOUT   
THE RESILIENCE WHERE WE HAD     

04:11:38.702 --> 04:11:42.137
I THINK IN CHAPTER FIVE ABOUT   
THE RESILIENCE WHERE WE HAD     
THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER   

04:11:42.139 --> 04:11:42.937
THE RESILIENCE WHERE WE HAD     
THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER   
THAT'S A GOOD WORD OR NOT.      

04:11:42.939 --> 04:11:46.341
THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER   
THAT'S A GOOD WORD OR NOT.      
COMMISSIONER GORDON, I I JUST   

04:11:46.343 --> 04:11:49.377
THAT'S A GOOD WORD OR NOT.      
COMMISSIONER GORDON, I I JUST   
WANT TO MAKE SURE I KNOW THAT   

04:11:49.379 --> 04:11:50.012
COMMISSIONER GORDON, I I JUST   
WANT TO MAKE SURE I KNOW THAT   
THE SUSTAINABILITY STAFF ARE    

04:11:50.014 --> 04:11:53.748
WANT TO MAKE SURE I KNOW THAT   
THE SUSTAINABILITY STAFF ARE    
AWARE OF THIS, BUT I WANT TO    

04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:54.483
THE SUSTAINABILITY STAFF ARE    
AWARE OF THIS, BUT I WANT TO    
MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN IS      

04:11:54.485 --> 04:11:56.984
AWARE OF THIS, BUT I WANT TO    
MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN IS      
REALLY CONSISTENTLY AWARE OR    

04:11:56.986 --> 04:11:57.885
MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN IS      
REALLY CONSISTENTLY AWARE OR    
MAKES CLEAR UM, WE'RE TALKING   

04:11:57.887 --> 04:12:01.523
REALLY CONSISTENTLY AWARE OR    
MAKES CLEAR UM, WE'RE TALKING   
ABOUT DENSIFYING A CITY THAT    

04:12:01.525 --> 04:12:04.692
MAKES CLEAR UM, WE'RE TALKING   
ABOUT DENSIFYING A CITY THAT    
NECESSARILY MEANS ADDING MORE   

04:12:04.694 --> 04:12:05.260
ABOUT DENSIFYING A CITY THAT    
NECESSARILY MEANS ADDING MORE   
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.             

04:12:05.262 --> 04:12:08.563
NECESSARILY MEANS ADDING MORE   
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.             
WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE  

04:12:08.565 --> 04:12:09.097
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.             
WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE  
INCORPORATING GREEN             

04:12:09.099 --> 04:12:12.633
WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE  
INCORPORATING GREEN             
TECHNOLOGIES TO MANAGE THE      

04:12:12.635 --> 04:12:13.468
INCORPORATING GREEN             
TECHNOLOGIES TO MANAGE THE      
STORMWATER THAT'S GENERATED AS  

04:12:13.470 --> 04:12:14.236
TECHNOLOGIES TO MANAGE THE      
STORMWATER THAT'S GENERATED AS  
MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON SITE AND    

04:12:14.238 --> 04:12:16.905
STORMWATER THAT'S GENERATED AS  
MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON SITE AND    
ALL OF THAT.                    

04:12:16.907 --> 04:12:17.939
MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON SITE AND    
ALL OF THAT.                    
SO WE NEED TO KIND OF KEEP      

04:12:17.941 --> 04:12:18.673
ALL OF THAT.                    
SO WE NEED TO KIND OF KEEP      
DRIVING THAT HOME AND THAT      

04:12:18.675 --> 04:12:20.208
SO WE NEED TO KIND OF KEEP      
DRIVING THAT HOME AND THAT      
FEEDS TO THE SECOND POINT.      

04:12:20.210 --> 04:12:21.609
DRIVING THAT HOME AND THAT      
FEEDS TO THE SECOND POINT.      
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THE 

04:12:21.611 --> 04:12:24.479
FEEDS TO THE SECOND POINT.      
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THE 
PLAN KEEPS POINTING OUT IT'S    

04:12:24.481 --> 04:12:27.849
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THE 
PLAN KEEPS POINTING OUT IT'S    
REALLY EASY TO SHOOT AT CITIES  

04:12:27.851 --> 04:12:28.850
PLAN KEEPS POINTING OUT IT'S    
REALLY EASY TO SHOOT AT CITIES  
FOR BEING THESE ENERGY HOGS AND 

04:12:28.852 --> 04:12:33.154
REALLY EASY TO SHOOT AT CITIES  
FOR BEING THESE ENERGY HOGS AND 
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS IF YOU    

04:12:33.156 --> 04:12:33.988
FOR BEING THESE ENERGY HOGS AND 
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS IF YOU    
JUST FOCUS ON THE CITY AND YOU  

04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.756
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS IF YOU    
JUST FOCUS ON THE CITY AND YOU  
DON'T THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE    

04:12:34.758 --> 04:12:36.724
JUST FOCUS ON THE CITY AND YOU  
DON'T THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE    
THAT THE CITY IS SERVING AND    

04:12:36.726 --> 04:12:37.592
DON'T THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE    
THAT THE CITY IS SERVING AND    
IGNORE THE FACT THAT IF THEY'RE 

04:12:37.594 --> 04:12:40.495
THAT THE CITY IS SERVING AND    
IGNORE THE FACT THAT IF THEY'RE 
NOT LIVING HERE AND WE'RE WE'RE 

04:12:40.497 --> 04:12:41.229
IGNORE THE FACT THAT IF THEY'RE 
NOT LIVING HERE AND WE'RE WE'RE 
ACCOMMODATING THEM EFFICIENTLY, 

04:12:41.231 --> 04:12:44.198
NOT LIVING HERE AND WE'RE WE'RE 
ACCOMMODATING THEM EFFICIENTLY, 
EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY,    

04:12:44.200 --> 04:12:44.966
ACCOMMODATING THEM EFFICIENTLY, 
EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY,    
THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIVING      

04:12:44.968 --> 04:12:45.633
EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY,    
THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIVING      
SOMEWHERE ELSE MUCH LESS        

04:12:45.635 --> 04:12:48.002
THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIVING      
SOMEWHERE ELSE MUCH LESS        
EFFICIENTLY AND MUCH MORE       

04:12:48.004 --> 04:12:48.737
SOMEWHERE ELSE MUCH LESS        
EFFICIENTLY AND MUCH MORE       
DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT.    

04:12:48.739 --> 04:12:52.474
EFFICIENTLY AND MUCH MORE       
DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT.    
SO I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED IF  

04:12:52.476 --> 04:12:53.208
DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT.    
SO I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED IF  
I JUST KIND OF PAINT A LITTLE   

04:12:53.210 --> 04:12:56.411
SO I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED IF  
I JUST KIND OF PAINT A LITTLE   
BIT ON WE SHOULD USE OUR        

04:12:56.413 --> 04:12:57.078
I JUST KIND OF PAINT A LITTLE   
BIT ON WE SHOULD USE OUR        
GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY AND    

04:12:57.080 --> 04:12:59.714
BIT ON WE SHOULD USE OUR        
GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY AND    
FOCUS ON THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT  

04:12:59.716 --> 04:13:00.649
GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY AND    
FOCUS ON THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT  
AND POINT OUT HOW BAD THE       

04:13:00.651 --> 04:13:01.182
FOCUS ON THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT  
AND POINT OUT HOW BAD THE       
ENVIRONMENT IS.                 

04:13:01.184 --> 04:13:03.318
AND POINT OUT HOW BAD THE       
ENVIRONMENT IS.                 
BUT IF YOU DO THAT IN ISOLATION 

04:13:03.320 --> 04:13:07.189
ENVIRONMENT IS.                 
BUT IF YOU DO THAT IN ISOLATION 
OF THE PERCOCET PER PER CAPITA  

04:13:07.191 --> 04:13:08.023
BUT IF YOU DO THAT IN ISOLATION 
OF THE PERCOCET PER PER CAPITA  
USE OF ENERGY AND DEVELOPMENT   

04:13:08.025 --> 04:13:11.025
OF THE PERCOCET PER PER CAPITA  
USE OF ENERGY AND DEVELOPMENT   
PATTERNS, YOU GET A DISTORTED   

04:13:11.027 --> 04:13:11.459
USE OF ENERGY AND DEVELOPMENT   
PATTERNS, YOU GET A DISTORTED   
PICTURE.                        

04:13:11.461 --> 04:13:12.293
PATTERNS, YOU GET A DISTORTED   
PICTURE.                        
SO AM I MAKING SENSE?           

04:13:12.295 --> 04:13:15.863
PICTURE.                        
SO AM I MAKING SENSE?           
YEAH, INDIC THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY

SO AM I MAKING SENSE?           
YEAH, INDIC THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY

IT'S MY BEDTIME.

SORRY PROFESSOR RECRIMINATORY   
IT'S MY BEDTIME.                
IT MIGHT BE A REFERENCE BECAUSE 

04:13:23.073 --> 04:13:26.474
IT'S MY BEDTIME.                
IT MIGHT BE A REFERENCE BECAUSE 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAD A  

04:13:26.476 --> 04:13:27.308
IT MIGHT BE A REFERENCE BECAUSE 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAD A  
GRAD STUDENT WORK WITH OWI ON A 

04:13:27.310 --> 04:13:29.977
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAD A  
GRAD STUDENT WORK WITH OWI ON A 
CALCULATOR THAT EFFECTIVELY     

04:13:29.979 --> 04:13:30.912
GRAD STUDENT WORK WITH OWI ON A 
CALCULATOR THAT EFFECTIVELY     
SHOWED JUST THAT UNITS BUILT IN 

04:13:30.914 --> 04:13:31.613
CALCULATOR THAT EFFECTIVELY     
SHOWED JUST THAT UNITS BUILT IN 
THE CITY IT WAS A GREENHOUSE    

04:13:31.615 --> 04:13:34.715
SHOWED JUST THAT UNITS BUILT IN 
THE CITY IT WAS A GREENHOUSE    
GAS CALCULATOR, UNITS BUILT IN  

04:13:34.717 --> 04:13:35.516
THE CITY IT WAS A GREENHOUSE    
GAS CALCULATOR, UNITS BUILT IN  
THE CITY THAN EVER BECAUSE THEY 

04:13:35.518 --> 04:13:36.251
GAS CALCULATOR, UNITS BUILT IN  
THE CITY THAN EVER BECAUSE THEY 
TEND TO BE SMALLER BECAUSE THEY 

04:13:36.253 --> 04:13:38.520
THE CITY THAN EVER BECAUSE THEY 
TEND TO BE SMALLER BECAUSE THEY 
TEND TO BE ATTACHED BECAUSE YOU 

04:13:38.522 --> 04:13:41.255
TEND TO BE SMALLER BECAUSE THEY 
TEND TO BE ATTACHED BECAUSE YOU 
CAN CUT DOWN ON COMMUTING.      

04:13:41.257 --> 04:13:42.324
TEND TO BE ATTACHED BECAUSE YOU 
CAN CUT DOWN ON COMMUTING.      
YOU CAN ALSO CUT DOWN ON, YOU   

04:13:42.326 --> 04:13:46.160
CAN CUT DOWN ON COMMUTING.      
YOU CAN ALSO CUT DOWN ON, YOU   
KNOW, RUNNING ERRANDS, THE      

04:13:46.162 --> 04:13:46.895
YOU CAN ALSO CUT DOWN ON, YOU   
KNOW, RUNNING ERRANDS, THE      
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT  

04:13:46.897 --> 04:13:49.498
KNOW, RUNNING ERRANDS, THE      
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT  
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT ZERO LIKE   

04:13:49.500 --> 04:13:54.135
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT  
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT ZERO LIKE   
THEY ARE, THEY PRODUCE FEWER    

04:13:54.137 --> 04:13:54.802
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT ZERO LIKE   
THEY ARE, THEY PRODUCE FEWER    
GREENHOUSE GASES THAN WHAT      

04:13:54.804 --> 04:13:55.537
THEY ARE, THEY PRODUCE FEWER    
GREENHOUSE GASES THAN WHAT      
WOULD BE THE ALTERNATIVE IF     

04:13:55.539 --> 04:13:58.539
GREENHOUSE GASES THAN WHAT      
WOULD BE THE ALTERNATIVE IF     
PEOPLE WEREN'T LIVING IN THE    

04:13:58.541 --> 04:13:58.874
WOULD BE THE ALTERNATIVE IF     
PEOPLE WEREN'T LIVING IN THE    
CITY.                           

04:13:58.876 --> 04:13:59.140
PEOPLE WEREN'T LIVING IN THE    
CITY.                           
EXACTLY.                        

04:13:59.142 --> 04:13:59.941
CITY.                           
EXACTLY.                        
SO WE'VE BEEN BECAUSE I THINK   

04:13:59.943 --> 04:14:01.476
EXACTLY.                        
SO WE'VE BEEN BECAUSE I THINK   
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING COME UP   

04:14:01.478 --> 04:14:02.410
SO WE'VE BEEN BECAUSE I THINK   
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING COME UP   
HERE AND IT OUGHT TO COME UP    

04:14:02.412 --> 04:14:05.079
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING COME UP   
HERE AND IT OUGHT TO COME UP    
HERE AND WE'RE WE'RE DUSTING    

04:14:05.081 --> 04:14:06.047
HERE AND IT OUGHT TO COME UP    
HERE AND WE'RE WE'RE DUSTING    
THAT OFF AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE 

04:14:06.049 --> 04:14:06.782
HERE AND WE'RE WE'RE DUSTING    
THAT OFF AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE 
ABLE TO PUBLISH THAT IN AS IT   

04:14:06.784 --> 04:14:09.817
THAT OFF AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE 
ABLE TO PUBLISH THAT IN AS IT   
LIKE A FACT SHEET IN THE        

04:14:09.819 --> 04:14:10.518
ABLE TO PUBLISH THAT IN AS IT   
LIKE A FACT SHEET IN THE        
CALCULATOR IN A MONTH OR TWO.   

04:14:10.520 --> 04:14:13.588
LIKE A FACT SHEET IN THE        
CALCULATOR IN A MONTH OR TWO.   
SO SO MY POINT IS PLEASE AS WE  

04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:14.455
CALCULATOR IN A MONTH OR TWO.   
SO SO MY POINT IS PLEASE AS WE  
CRITIQUE THE WAY WE'RE BUILDING 

04:14:14.457 --> 04:14:17.659
SO SO MY POINT IS PLEASE AS WE  
CRITIQUE THE WAY WE'RE BUILDING 
INTERNALLY, MAKING SURE WE'RE   

04:14:17.661 --> 04:14:18.693
CRITIQUE THE WAY WE'RE BUILDING 
INTERNALLY, MAKING SURE WE'RE   
DOING IT AS WELL AS WE CAN, WE  

04:14:18.695 --> 04:14:21.262
INTERNALLY, MAKING SURE WE'RE   
DOING IT AS WELL AS WE CAN, WE  
ALSO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT      

04:14:21.264 --> 04:14:21.963
DOING IT AS WELL AS WE CAN, WE  
ALSO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT      
OF THE LARGER REGIONAL IMPACTS  

04:14:21.965 --> 04:14:22.631
ALSO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT      
OF THE LARGER REGIONAL IMPACTS  
OF DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT        

04:14:22.633 --> 04:14:25.767
OF THE LARGER REGIONAL IMPACTS  
OF DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT        
PATTERNS IF YOU WANT TO BE      

04:14:25.769 --> 04:14:28.136
OF DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT        
PATTERNS IF YOU WANT TO BE      
GREEN IN A LOT OF WAYS LIVE IN  

04:14:28.138 --> 04:14:29.204
PATTERNS IF YOU WANT TO BE      
GREEN IN A LOT OF WAYS LIVE IN  
A CITY IT'S A MUCH MORE ENERGY  

04:14:29.206 --> 04:14:29.938
GREEN IN A LOT OF WAYS LIVE IN  
A CITY IT'S A MUCH MORE ENERGY  
EFFICIENT AND LESS POLLUTING    

04:14:29.940 --> 04:14:32.874
A CITY IT'S A MUCH MORE ENERGY  
EFFICIENT AND LESS POLLUTING

YES.                            
SO NOW THESE ARE THE THESE ARE  
THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMENTS    

04:14:44.488 --> 04:14:45.220
SO NOW THESE ARE THE THESE ARE  
THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMENTS    
THAT WE WILL BE COMPILING WITH  

04:14:45.222 --> 04:14:48.490
THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMENTS    
THAT WE WILL BE COMPILING WITH  
YOURS TO GO THROUGH THE FIRST

OK, CAN I JUST ASK ONE SMALL    

04:14:52.629 --> 04:14:55.997
ROUND OF EDITS.                 
OK, CAN I JUST ASK ONE SMALL    
THING ABOUT THE EIGHTY EIGHT    

04:14:55.999 --> 04:14:57.098
OK, CAN I JUST ASK ONE SMALL    
THING ABOUT THE EIGHTY EIGHT    
PART IT THEY IDENTIFY THE GAP   

04:14:57.100 --> 04:15:00.735
THING ABOUT THE EIGHTY EIGHT

IS IS THAT THE GAP THAT WE WANT 
TO KEEP THERE?                  
IS IT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT     

04:15:11.849 --> 04:15:15.350

SPECIFICALLY AT THE MAP.        
I THINK IN GENERAL MY           
RECOLLECTION OF A WHITE

I THINK IN GENERAL MY           
RECOLLECTION OF A WHITE         
PLYMOUTH IS NOT TRANSITION IS   

04:15:23.460 --> 04:15:24.191

TO DEVELOP.                     

04:15:32.002 --> 04:15:32.800
GRAVE THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT   
TO DEVELOP.                     
SO I THINK WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE 

04:15:32.802 --> 04:15:35.704

TRYING TO HAVE IT BE MORE       
INCLUSIVE IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL   

04:36:09.905 --> 04:36:13.039
TRYING TO HAVE IT BE MORE       
INCLUSIVE IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL   
FOR US TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE     

04:36:13.041 --> 04:36:13.707
INCLUSIVE IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL   
FOR US TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE     
ALSO LOOK AT THAT DESCRIPTION   

04:36:13.709 --> 04:36:16.009
FOR US TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE     
ALSO LOOK AT THAT DESCRIPTION   
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT     

04:36:16.011 --> 04:36:17.010
ALSO LOOK AT THAT DESCRIPTION   
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT     
OVERLY NARROW TO PROVIDE THE

TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT     
OVERLY NARROW TO PROVIDE THE    
FLEXIBILITY FOR WHAT THOSE      

04:36:19.714 --> 04:36:20.414
OVERLY NARROW TO PROVIDE THE    
FLEXIBILITY FOR WHAT THOSE      
MULTIPLE DISTRICTS MIGHT BE     

04:36:20.416 --> 04:36:21.181
FLEXIBILITY FOR WHAT THOSE      
MULTIPLE DISTRICTS MIGHT BE     
BECAUSE I FEAR RIGHT NOW AS THE

TRANSITION DISTRICT IS CRAFTED  

04:36:24.019 --> 04:36:24.884
BECAUSE I FEAR RIGHT NOW AS THE 
TRANSITION DISTRICT IS CRAFTED  
IT MIGHT PROVIDE THAT I DON'T   

04:36:24.886 --> 04:36:27.988

HAVE THE SAME TENSION WITH DC   
ONE.

RIGHT.                          
WE STARTED WHERE WE SAID LIKE   

04:38:33.782 --> 04:38:34.580
RIGHT.                          
WE STARTED WHERE WE SAID LIKE   
CAR DEALERSHIPS BUT THEN WE     

04:38:34.582 --> 04:38:38.284
WE STARTED WHERE WE SAID LIKE   
CAR DEALERSHIPS BUT THEN WE     
SAID, YOU KNOW, A AS LONG AS

04:54:01.876 --> 04:54:04.743
I RECYCLE IT.                   
>> IT'S JUST NOT AN ENGAGING    
PLACE TO WALK BY THAT'S         

04:54:04.745 --> 04:54:09.182
>> IT'S JUST NOT AN ENGAGING    
PLACE TO WALK BY THAT'S         
DIFFERENT THAN I THINK THE WAY  

04:54:09.184 --> 04:54:09.916
PLACE TO WALK BY THAT'S         
DIFFERENT THAN I THINK THE WAY  
THAT THE TRANSITION ZONE        

04:54:09.918 --> 04:54:12.951
DIFFERENT THAN I THINK THE WAY  
THAT THE TRANSITION ZONE        
INTENDED FOR HELP WHATEVER      

04:54:12.953 --> 04:54:13.652
THAT THE TRANSITION ZONE        
INTENDED FOR HELP WHATEVER      
DISTRICT IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW   

04:54:13.654 --> 04:54:16.655
INTENDED FOR HELP WHATEVER      
DISTRICT IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW   
WHICH IS LIKE THIS IS A         

04:54:16.657 --> 04:54:17.456
DISTRICT IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW   
WHICH IS LIKE THIS IS A         
WALKABLE PLACE LIKE THIS IS

04:54:18.125 --> 04:54:21.294
WALKABLE PLACE LIKE THIS IS     
WHAT WE WANT, YOU KNOW.         
SO THAT'S I THINK THE THING IS  

04:54:21.296 --> 04:54:22.094
WHAT WE WANT, YOU KNOW.         
SO THAT'S I THINK THE THING IS  
THAT IF WE MERGE THEM THAT'S    

04:54:22.096 --> 04:54:23.862
SO THAT'S I THINK THE THING IS  
THAT IF WE MERGE THEM THAT'S    
WHERE IT BECOMES TRICKY.        

04:54:23.864 --> 04:54:24.630
THAT IF WE MERGE THEM THAT'S    
WHERE IT BECOMES TRICKY.        
BUT ALL RIGHT.                  

04:54:24.632 --> 04:54:34.040
WHERE IT BECOMES TRICKY.        
BUT ALL RIGHT.                  
BRITISH SO UM                   

04:54:34.474 --> 04:54:43.216
              I WHEN I WHEN I

THERE ARE THESE REALLY BIG      
YARDS OF THINGS AND I JUST FIND

I HEAR FROM OTHER COUNCIL       
MEMBERS WHOSE DISTRICTS ARE

I HEAR FROM OTHER COUNCIL       
MEMBERS WHOSE DISTRICTS ARE     
THERE BECAUSE MINE IS NOT       

04:55:03.504 --> 04:55:05.471
MEMBERS WHOSE DISTRICTS ARE     
THERE BECAUSE MINE IS NOT       
ANYWHERE NEAR THERE BUT THEY    

04:55:05.473 --> 04:55:06.071
THERE BECAUSE MINE IS NOT       
ANYWHERE NEAR THERE BUT THEY    
GET COMPLAINTS, THEY GET        

04:55:06.073 --> 04:55:09.007
ANYWHERE NEAR THERE BUT THEY    
GET COMPLAINTS, THEY GET

THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOL     
PROPERTY THAT'S DOWN THERE.     

04:55:13.013 --> 04:55:14.013
THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOL     
PROPERTY THAT'S DOWN THERE.     
SO I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS THAT 

04:55:14.015 --> 04:55:14.780
PROPERTY THAT'S DOWN THERE.     
SO I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS THAT 
WE WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER VERY  

04:55:14.782 --> 04:55:17.516
SO I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS THAT 
WE WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER VERY  
MESSY THAT PEOPLE ARE DISTURBED 

04:55:17.518 --> 04:55:21.019
WE WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER VERY  
MESSY THAT PEOPLE ARE DISTURBED

04:55:21.021 --> 04:55:24.589
MESSY THAT PEOPLE ARE DISTURBED 
BY AND DON'T LIKE LIVING NEAR.  
SO THAT SAYS TO ME THAT THERE   

04:55:24.591 --> 04:55:25.357
BY AND DON'T LIKE LIVING NEAR.  
SO THAT SAYS TO ME THAT THERE   
IT IS USEFUL TO HAVE A PLACE    

04:55:25.359 --> 04:55:26.091
SO THAT SAYS TO ME THAT THERE   
IT IS USEFUL TO HAVE A PLACE    
WHERE THINGS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT  

04:55:26.093 --> 04:55:28.494
IT IS USEFUL TO HAVE A PLACE    
WHERE THINGS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT  
COMPLAIN ABOUT ARE HAPPENING    

04:55:28.496 --> 04:55:32.765
WHERE THINGS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT  
COMPLAIN ABOUT ARE HAPPENING    
AND SO BUT YOU AND I ALSO HEAR  

04:55:32.767 --> 04:55:36.402
COMPLAIN ABOUT ARE HAPPENING

BECAUSE AGAIN I'M FOLLOWING A   
DIFFERENT POLICY WITH NAMES IS  

04:55:40.275 --> 04:55:44.076
BECAUSE AGAIN I'M FOLLOWING A   
DIFFERENT POLICY WITH NAMES IS  
THAT ANYTHING THAT WE THAT WE   

04:55:44.078 --> 04:55:45.043
DIFFERENT POLICY WITH NAMES IS  
THAT ANYTHING THAT WE THAT WE   
RISK PEOPLE SELLING OUT TO THE

THAT ANYTHING THAT WE THAT WE   
RISK PEOPLE SELLING OUT TO THE  
UNIVERSITY RATHER THAN THE      

04:55:48.415 --> 04:55:49.048
RISK PEOPLE SELLING OUT TO THE  
UNIVERSITY RATHER THAN THE      
HOUSING DEVELOPER WHO'S GOING   

04:55:49.050 --> 04:55:52.284
UNIVERSITY RATHER THAN THE      
HOUSING DEVELOPER WHO'S GOING   
TO COME THERE BECAUSE THE PART  

04:55:52.286 --> 04:55:53.118
HOUSING DEVELOPER WHO'S GOING   
TO COME THERE BECAUSE THE PART  
OF WHAT MAKES THIS PART OF TOWN 

04:55:53.120 --> 04:55:55.821
TO COME THERE BECAUSE THE PART  
OF WHAT MAKES THIS PART OF TOWN 
SENSITIVE IS THAT IT'S          

04:55:55.823 --> 04:55:56.555
OF WHAT MAKES THIS PART OF TOWN 
SENSITIVE IS THAT IT'S          
EXTREMELY CLOSE TO THE          

04:55:56.557 --> 04:55:59.292
SENSITIVE IS THAT IT'S          
EXTREMELY CLOSE TO THE          
UNIVERSITY AND RIPE FOR THINGS  

04:55:59.294 --> 04:56:00.226
EXTREMELY CLOSE TO THE          
UNIVERSITY AND RIPE FOR THINGS  
THAT YOU WANT TO BE YOU KNOW,   

04:56:00.228 --> 04:56:03.696
UNIVERSITY AND RIPE FOR THINGS  
THAT YOU WANT TO BE YOU KNOW,   
WANT TO WALK FROM WALK TO THE   

04:56:03.698 --> 04:56:04.530
THAT YOU WANT TO BE YOU KNOW,   
WANT TO WALK FROM WALK TO THE   
UNIVERSITY LIKE THEY WANT TO    

04:56:04.532 --> 04:56:07.265
WANT TO WALK FROM WALK TO THE   
UNIVERSITY LIKE THEY WANT TO    
LIVE THERE OR WHATEVER.         

04:56:07.267 --> 04:56:08.200
UNIVERSITY LIKE THEY WANT TO    
LIVE THERE OR WHATEVER.         
SO I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE      

04:56:08.202 --> 04:56:11.670
LIVE THERE OR WHATEVER.         
SO I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE      
PRESSURE FOR IF IF RESIDENTIAL  

04:56:11.672 --> 04:56:12.338
SO I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE      
PRESSURE FOR IF IF RESIDENTIAL  
IS ALLOWED THERE, WHICH IT IS   

04:56:12.340 --> 04:56:16.174
PRESSURE FOR IF IF RESIDENTIAL  
IS ALLOWED THERE, WHICH IT IS   
NOW BECAUSE WE SAID WE WOULDN'T 

04:56:16.176 --> 04:56:17.042
IS ALLOWED THERE, WHICH IT IS   
NOW BECAUSE WE SAID WE WOULDN'T 
LET IT GO WITHOUT RESIDENTIAL.  

04:56:17.044 --> 04:56:19.445
NOW BECAUSE WE SAID WE WOULDN'T 
LET IT GO WITHOUT RESIDENTIAL.  
I DO THINK RISKS GETTING BOUGHT 

04:56:19.447 --> 04:56:19.712
LET IT GO WITHOUT RESIDENTIAL.  
I DO THINK RISKS GETTING BOUGHT 
OUT.                            

04:56:19.714 --> 04:56:23.382
I DO THINK RISKS GETTING BOUGHT 
OUT.                            
SO I THINK OF IT AS A PLACE     

04:56:23.384 --> 04:56:24.316
OUT.                            
SO I THINK OF IT AS A PLACE     
THAT IT IS AND I THINK IS THE   

04:56:24.318 --> 04:56:24.884
SO I THINK OF IT AS A PLACE     
THAT IT IS AND I THINK IS THE   
PLACE THAT IT IS.               

04:56:24.886 --> 04:56:25.551
THAT IT IS AND I THINK IS THE   
PLACE THAT IT IS.               
IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY WORKABLE  

04:56:25.553 --> 04:56:27.886
PLACE THAT IT IS.               
IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY WORKABLE  
TO ME BUT I FIND USEFUL THINGS. 

04:56:27.888 --> 04:56:28.687
IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY WORKABLE  
TO ME BUT I FIND USEFUL THINGS. 
THERE ARE THINGS THAT I WOULD   

04:56:28.689 --> 04:56:30.856
TO ME BUT I FIND USEFUL THINGS. 
THERE ARE THINGS THAT I WOULD   
LIKE TO BE IN THE CITY          

04:56:30.858 --> 04:56:31.824
THERE ARE THINGS THAT I WOULD   
LIKE TO BE IN THE CITY          
REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH TAX THEY

REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH TAX THEY

CONVERSATION THAT THERE         
ACTUALLY WASN'T A LOT           

04:56:39.266 --> 04:56:42.567
CONVERSATION THAT THERE         
ACTUALLY WASN'T A LOT           
OF INFRASTRUCTURE THERE BECAUSE 

04:56:42.569 --> 04:56:45.837
ACTUALLY WASN'T A LOT           
OF INFRASTRUCTURE THERE BECAUSE 
IT ISN'T CURRENTLY A HIGH       

04:56:45.839 --> 04:56:46.638
OF INFRASTRUCTURE THERE BECAUSE 
IT ISN'T CURRENTLY A HIGH       
PEOPLE DENSITY NEIGHBORHOOD AND 

04:56:46.640 --> 04:56:50.643
IT ISN'T CURRENTLY A HIGH
