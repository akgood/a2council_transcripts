00:28:06.321 --> 00:28:12.559
ANY ANALYSIS TO SEE IF YOU      
COULD HAVE A DEAD END CORRIDOR  
WITHIN THIS DEVELOPMENT         

00:28:26.441 --> 00:28:28.575
                        AND     
STILL GET THE VEHICULAR         
MOVEMENT NECESSARY WITHOUT THE  

00:28:28.577 --> 00:28:29.609
STILL GET THE VEHICULAR         
MOVEMENT NECESSARY WITHOUT THE  
EXTRA KAPUTT.                   

00:28:29.611 --> 00:28:30.610
MOVEMENT NECESSARY WITHOUT THE  
EXTRA KAPUTT.                   
WOULD YOU BE ARE YOU REFERRING  

00:28:30.612 --> 00:28:31.278
EXTRA KAPUTT.                   
WOULD YOU BE ARE YOU REFERRING  
TO REMOVING A CURB CUT OFF THE  

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.745
WOULD YOU BE ARE YOU REFERRING  
TO REMOVING A CURB CUT OFF THE  
PUBLIC STREET?                  

00:28:31.747 --> 00:28:32.011
TO REMOVING A CURB CUT OFF THE  
PUBLIC STREET?                  
YEP.                            

00:28:32.013 --> 00:28:33.146
PUBLIC STREET?                  
YEP.                            
OK, IT COULD BE POSSIBLE.       

00:28:33.148 --> 00:28:34.247
YEP.                            
OK, IT COULD BE POSSIBLE.       
I KNOW WE WERE LOOKING AT THE   

00:28:34.249 --> 00:28:34.948
OK, IT COULD BE POSSIBLE.       
I KNOW WE WERE LOOKING AT THE   
THE VEHICLE CIRCULATION IT WAS  

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:35.749
I KNOW WE WERE LOOKING AT THE   
THE VEHICLE CIRCULATION IT WAS  
DESIRED TO HAVE THAT ACCESS TO  

00:28:35.751 --> 00:28:36.416
THE VEHICLE CIRCULATION IT WAS  
DESIRED TO HAVE THAT ACCESS TO  
MIDDLE ROAD ESPECIALLY FOR      

00:28:36.418 --> 00:28:37.017
DESIRED TO HAVE THAT ACCESS TO  
MIDDLE ROAD ESPECIALLY FOR      
VEHICLES LEAVING SO THEY        

00:28:37.019 --> 00:28:39.953
MIDDLE ROAD ESPECIALLY FOR      
VEHICLES LEAVING SO THEY        
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GO OUT TO      

00:28:39.955 --> 00:28:43.189
VEHICLES LEAVING SO THEY        
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GO OUT TO      
MAPLE ROAD AND THEN ATTEMPT TO  

00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:44.223
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GO OUT TO      
MAPLE ROAD AND THEN ATTEMPT TO  
GO RIGHT TURN LANE DURING       

00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:45.658
MAPLE ROAD AND THEN ATTEMPT TO  
GO RIGHT TURN LANE DURING       
TRAFFIC TIMES.                  

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:51.297
GO RIGHT TURN LANE DURING       
TRAFFIC TIMES.                  
SO THE DESIRE WAS THERE TO HAVE 

00:28:51.299 --> 00:28:52.065
TRAFFIC TIMES.                  
SO THE DESIRE WAS THERE TO HAVE 
THAT THE CIRCULATION PROBLEM I  

00:28:52.067 --> 00:28:54.434
SO THE DESIRE WAS THERE TO HAVE 
THAT THE CIRCULATION PROBLEM I  
KNOW THAT THAT THE PROCESS THE  

00:28:54.436 --> 00:28:57.670
THAT THE CIRCULATION PROBLEM I  
KNOW THAT THAT THE PROCESS THE  
ONE CAR CUTOFF OF MAPLE ROAD    

00:28:57.672 --> 00:29:01.741
KNOW THAT THAT THE PROCESS THE  
ONE CAR CUTOFF OF MAPLE ROAD    
WAS DESIGNED ONE ACTUALLY FOR   

00:29:01.743 --> 00:29:02.409
ONE CAR CUTOFF OF MAPLE ROAD    
WAS DESIGNED ONE ACTUALLY FOR   
BOTH ROADS BECAUSE OF THE       

00:29:02.411 --> 00:29:03.143
WAS DESIGNED ONE ACTUALLY FOR   
BOTH ROADS BECAUSE OF THE       
HEIGHT OF THE BUILDINGS THOSE   

00:29:03.145 --> 00:29:06.212
BOTH ROADS BECAUSE OF THE       
HEIGHT OF THE BUILDINGS THOSE   
CURB CUTS THE DRIVE ILLES AS    

00:29:06.214 --> 00:29:09.282
HEIGHT OF THE BUILDINGS THOSE   
CURB CUTS THE DRIVE ILLES AS    
YOU COME IN OR TWENTY SIX FEET  

00:29:09.284 --> 00:29:10.316
CURB CUTS THE DRIVE ILLES AS    
YOU COME IN OR TWENTY SIX FEET  
WIDE AND THAT DOES PROVIDE THE  

00:29:10.318 --> 00:29:12.852
YOU COME IN OR TWENTY SIX FEET  
WIDE AND THAT DOES PROVIDE THE  
AERIAL ACCESS REQUIRED FROM THE 

00:29:12.854 --> 00:29:13.386
WIDE AND THAT DOES PROVIDE THE  
AERIAL ACCESS REQUIRED FROM THE 
FIRE DEPARTMENT.                

00:29:13.388 --> 00:29:14.153
AERIAL ACCESS REQUIRED FROM THE 
FIRE DEPARTMENT.                
SO WITH THAT ASPECT YES.        

00:29:14.155 --> 00:29:17.657
FIRE DEPARTMENT.                
SO WITH THAT ASPECT YES.        
THEY WILL BOTH BE REQUIRED TO   

00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:20.694
SO WITH THAT ASPECT YES.        
THEY WILL BOTH BE REQUIRED TO   
BE PRESENT.                     

00:29:20.696 --> 00:29:21.894
THEY WILL BOTH BE REQUIRED TO   
BE PRESENT.                     
OK THAT&amp;apos;S JUST ONE OF THE       

00:29:21.896 --> 00:29:27.501
BE PRESENT.                     
OK THAT&amp;apos;S JUST ONE OF THE       
ENGINEERING FOR THE ARCHITECT.  

00:29:27.503 --> 00:29:32.172
OK THAT&amp;apos;S JUST ONE OF THE       
ENGINEERING FOR THE ARCHITECT.  
IT SAYS ON THE ROOF PLAN        

00:29:32.174 --> 00:29:35.708
ENGINEERING FOR THE ARCHITECT.  
IT SAYS ON THE ROOF PLAN        
OPTIONAL ROOF DECK PATIO.       

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:36.910
IT SAYS ON THE ROOF PLAN        
OPTIONAL ROOF DECK PATIO.       
SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO IF WHAT IS  

00:29:36.912 --> 00:29:39.912
OPTIONAL ROOF DECK PATIO.       
SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO IF WHAT IS  
THE PLAN FOR THAT SINCE THERE   

00:29:39.914 --> 00:29:40.714
SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO IF WHAT IS  
THE PLAN FOR THAT SINCE THERE   
IS LIMITED GREEN SPACE AND IT&amp;apos;S 

00:29:40.716 --> 00:29:44.051
THE PLAN FOR THAT SINCE THERE   
IS LIMITED GREEN SPACE AND IT&amp;apos;S 
LABELED AS OPTIONAL, IS IT      

00:29:44.053 --> 00:29:44.884
IS LIMITED GREEN SPACE AND IT&amp;apos;S 
LABELED AS OPTIONAL, IS IT      
GUARANTEED OR ARE YOU GOING TO  

00:29:44.886 --> 00:29:48.354
LABELED AS OPTIONAL, IS IT      
GUARANTEED OR ARE YOU GOING TO  
SEE THIS OR IF IT&amp;apos;S OPTIONAL IS 

00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:51.624
GUARANTEED OR ARE YOU GOING TO  
SEE THIS OR IF IT&amp;apos;S OPTIONAL IS 
THE OTHER OPTION SOLAR PANELS   

00:29:51.626 --> 00:29:51.892
SEE THIS OR IF IT&amp;apos;S OPTIONAL IS 
THE OTHER OPTION SOLAR PANELS   
INSTEAD?                        

00:29:51.894 --> 00:29:52.959
THE OTHER OPTION SOLAR PANELS   
INSTEAD?                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT HAS BEEN MY DISCUSSION 

00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:56.162
INSTEAD?                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT HAS BEEN MY DISCUSSION 
WITH THE OWNER THAT HE INTENDS  

00:29:56.164 --> 00:29:58.932
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT HAS BEEN MY DISCUSSION 
WITH THE OWNER THAT HE INTENDS  
TO PUT THEM ON THE BUILDINGS.   

00:29:58.934 --> 00:29:59.866
WITH THE OWNER THAT HE INTENDS  
TO PUT THEM ON THE BUILDINGS.   
I HAVE NO BELIEF THAT THEY

TO FIGURE HOW TO HAVE A LITTLE  
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH       
SOMETHING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

JUST A LITTLE BIT               
OF FLEXIBILITY SOMETIMES WOULD  
ALLOW US TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES 

00:44:03.677 --> 00:44:04.443
OF FLEXIBILITY SOMETIMES WOULD  
ALLOW US TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES 
AROUND SOME OF THOSE THINGS.

00:45:09.844 --> 00:45:12.644
MARKET YOU&amp;apos;RE GETTING AT AND    
YOU HAVE PEOPLE TEND TO THINK   
OF ELECTRIC AS BEING OH MAYBE   

00:45:12.646 --> 00:45:13.312
YOU HAVE PEOPLE TEND TO THINK   
OF ELECTRIC AS BEING OH MAYBE   
IT&amp;apos;S NOT NICE ENOUGH FOR THE    

00:45:13.314 --> 00:45:14.113
OF ELECTRIC AS BEING OH MAYBE   
IT&amp;apos;S NOT NICE ENOUGH FOR THE    
RENT I WANT TO CHARGE AND THEN  

00:45:14.115 --> 00:45:16.115
IT&amp;apos;S NOT NICE ENOUGH FOR THE    
RENT I WANT TO CHARGE AND THEN  
THERE&amp;apos;S GAS BUT INDUCTION IS    

00:45:16.117 --> 00:45:16.849
RENT I WANT TO CHARGE AND THEN  
THERE&amp;apos;S GAS BUT INDUCTION IS    
ACTUALLY GETTING TO BE MORE     

00:45:16.851 --> 00:45:19.952
THERE&amp;apos;S GAS BUT INDUCTION IS    
ACTUALLY GETTING TO BE MORE     
TRENDY AND SO THERE ARE WAYS TO 

00:45:19.954 --> 00:45:20.886
ACTUALLY GETTING TO BE MORE     
TRENDY AND SO THERE ARE WAYS TO 
DO ELECTRIC THAT ARE THAT ARE   

00:45:20.888 --> 00:45:23.889
TRENDY AND SO THERE ARE WAYS TO 
DO ELECTRIC THAT ARE THAT ARE   
HIGHER AND TOO IF THAT&amp;apos;S PART   

00:45:23.891 --> 00:45:24.756
DO ELECTRIC THAT ARE THAT ARE   
HIGHER AND TOO IF THAT&amp;apos;S PART   
OF A MARKET THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING

PEOPLE AS THEY&amp;apos;RE PUTTING       

00:45:28.196 --> 00:45:31.196
THINK THAT IS AN OPTION FOR     
PEOPLE AS THEY&amp;apos;RE PUTTING       
DEVELOPMENTS OUT THERE THAT     

00:45:31.198 --> 00:45:31.931
PEOPLE AS THEY&amp;apos;RE PUTTING       
DEVELOPMENTS OUT THERE THAT     
ELECTRIC CAN BE SOMETHING THAT  

00:45:31.933 --> 00:45:35.134
DEVELOPMENTS OUT THERE THAT     
ELECTRIC CAN BE SOMETHING THAT  
IS HIGH PERFORMANCE AS WELL FOR 

00:45:35.136 --> 00:45:36.001
ELECTRIC CAN BE SOMETHING THAT  
IS HIGH PERFORMANCE AS WELL FOR 
FOR SOME OF THE KITCHEN         

00:45:36.003 --> 00:45:39.038
IS HIGH PERFORMANCE AS WELL FOR

FOR SOME OF THE KITCHEN         
APPLIANCES.                     
SO YEAH, I I AM LESS IN FAVOR   

00:45:43.944 --> 00:45:47.379
APPLIANCES.                     
SO YEAH, I I AM LESS IN FAVOR

I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE IN      

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:10.402
SO THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE I AM.           
I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE IN      
TERMS OF THAT MAYBE YOU CAN DO  

00:46:10.404 --> 00:46:11.103
I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE IN      
TERMS OF THAT MAYBE YOU CAN DO  
SOME REALLY COOL THINGS WITH

00:46:20.347 --> 00:46:23.949
BE IN.                          
SO THE OTHER JUST RANDOM THING  
I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE

SO THE OTHER JUST RANDOM THING  
I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE

SOMEONE IS DOING CONDITIONING   

00:46:27.188 --> 00:46:28.120

WAY THE MASONRY WAS HANDLED AND 
SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD 

00:46:32.259 --> 00:46:33.058
WAY THE MASONRY WAS HANDLED AND 
SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD 
GET CORRECTED THE SECOND TIME

SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD 
GET CORRECTED THE SECOND TIME   
AROUND THERE&amp;apos;S KIND OF THAT

FORTY SEVEN TWO BEDROOM UNITS

FORTY SEVEN TWO BEDROOM UNITS   
ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ARE WE GOING TO SEE          
SPILLOVER?                      
SO IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE   

00:48:07.622 --> 00:48:08.487
SPILLOVER?                      
SO IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE   
OWNER THE ANSWER IS SOME OF THE 

00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:11.356
SO IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE   
OWNER THE ANSWER IS SOME OF THE 
TWO UNITS HAVE A SINGLE CAR AND 

00:48:11.358 --> 00:48:13.559
OWNER THE ANSWER IS SOME OF THE 
TWO UNITS HAVE A SINGLE CAR AND 
SOME OF THEM HAVE TWO CARS      

00:48:13.561 --> 00:48:17.429
TWO UNITS HAVE A SINGLE CAR AND 
SOME OF THEM HAVE TWO CARS      
OF THE CURRENT BUT THE EXISTING 

00:48:17.431 --> 00:48:18.363
SOME OF THEM HAVE TWO CARS      
OF THE CURRENT BUT THE EXISTING 
PHASE ONE IF YOU WILL OF ONE    

00:48:18.365 --> 00:48:21.733
OF THE CURRENT BUT THE EXISTING 
PHASE ONE IF YOU WILL OF ONE    
HEAD UP A RATIO OF ABOUT ONE    

00:48:21.735 --> 00:48:22.101
PHASE ONE IF YOU WILL OF ONE    
HEAD UP A RATIO OF ABOUT ONE    
POINT SEVEN.                    

00:48:22.103 --> 00:48:25.504
HEAD UP A RATIO OF ABOUT ONE    
POINT SEVEN.                    
I THINK PARKING SPACES PER      

00:48:25.506 --> 00:48:26.171
POINT SEVEN.                    
I THINK PARKING SPACES PER      
DWELLING IN THIS VERSION.       

00:48:26.173 --> 00:48:28.673
I THINK PARKING SPACES PER      
DWELLING IN THIS VERSION.       
WE&amp;apos;VE SCALED THAT DOWN ABOUT    

00:48:28.675 --> 00:48:29.374
DWELLING IN THIS VERSION.       
WE&amp;apos;VE SCALED THAT DOWN ABOUT    
ONE POINT TO SEVEN.             

00:48:29.376 --> 00:48:32.711
WE&amp;apos;VE SCALED THAT DOWN ABOUT    
ONE POINT TO SEVEN.             
SO IT IS A REDUCTION FROM THE   

00:48:32.713 --> 00:48:33.578
ONE POINT TO SEVEN.             
SO IT IS A REDUCTION FROM THE   
FIRST ONE BUT THEY&amp;apos;RE CONNECTED 

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:34.345
SO IT IS A REDUCTION FROM THE   
FIRST ONE BUT THEY&amp;apos;RE CONNECTED 
AND SO THEY CAN BE SHARED       

00:48:34.347 --> 00:48:36.782
FIRST ONE BUT THEY&amp;apos;RE CONNECTED 
AND SO THEY CAN BE SHARED       
CORRECT.                        

00:48:36.784 --> 00:48:37.716
AND SO THEY CAN BE SHARED       
CORRECT.                        
SO AND THE OTHER CONSIDERATION  

00:48:37.718 --> 00:48:44.623
CORRECT.                        
SO AND THE OTHER CONSIDERATION  
IS THAT THE INSTALLED SPACES

CAN ANSWER THAT AND VERY        
BRIEFLY, THE ONE AREA WHERE     
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT THE UNDERGROUND       

00:59:58.231 --> 00:59:58.897
BRIEFLY, THE ONE AREA WHERE     
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT THE UNDERGROUND       
DETENTION AND OF COURSE THAT&amp;apos;S  

00:59:58.899 --> 01:00:00.397
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT THE UNDERGROUND       
DETENTION AND OF COURSE THAT&amp;apos;S  
GOING TO BE FILLED WITH GRAVEL  

01:00:00.399 --> 01:00:01.165
DETENTION AND OF COURSE THAT&amp;apos;S  
GOING TO BE FILLED WITH GRAVEL  
SO THAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE A VERY    

01:00:01.167 --> 01:00:03.701
GOING TO BE FILLED WITH GRAVEL  
SO THAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE A VERY    
WELL-TRAINED, WELL TRAINED AREA 

01:00:03.703 --> 01:00:03.901
SO THAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE A VERY    
WELL-TRAINED, WELL TRAINED AREA 
.                               

01:00:03.903 --> 01:00:04.836
WELL-TRAINED, WELL TRAINED AREA 
.                               
THE DRIVE ON THE WEST WHICH

THE DRIVE ON THE WEST WHICH     
DOES NOT HAVE THE UNDERGROUND   
DETENTION AND IT HAS            

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:12.276
DOES NOT HAVE THE UNDERGROUND   
DETENTION AND IT HAS            
APPROXIMATELY I THINK IT&amp;apos;S      

01:00:12.278 --> 01:00:16.380
DETENTION AND IT HAS            
APPROXIMATELY I THINK IT&amp;apos;S      
ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT THAT       

01:00:16.382 --> 01:00:16.948
APPROXIMATELY I THINK IT&amp;apos;S      
ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT THAT

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:17.715
ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT THAT       
COMES ACROSS THAT.              
SO WATER IS GOING TO BE         

01:00:17.717 --> 01:00:20.251
COMES ACROSS THAT.              
SO WATER IS GOING TO BE         
DRAINING OFF VERY QUICKLY FROM  

01:00:20.253 --> 01:00:21.018
SO WATER IS GOING TO BE

YEAH, JUST BECAUSE OF THE IF    
IT&amp;apos;S SUPER HEIDRICK AND IT&amp;apos;S    
SEASONALLY HIGH UM WELL THAT    

01:00:28.795 --> 01:00:35.033
IT&amp;apos;S SUPER HEIDRICK AND IT&amp;apos;S

01:00:38.738 --> 01:00:39.938
FROM THE PROPERTY THE WEST TO   
THE WETLANDS THERE IS ABOUT 15

SECTION OF THAT WITH THAT BUT   

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.652
WATER IN THOSE UPPER UPPER      
SECTION OF THAT WITH THAT BUT   
THE PAVEMENT ITSELF HAS GOT A   

01:00:54.654 --> 01:00:55.053
SECTION OF THAT WITH THAT BUT   
THE PAVEMENT ITSELF HAS GOT A   
VERY GOOD.

THE PAVEMENT ITSELF HAS GOT A   
VERY GOOD.

01:00:55.988 --> 01:00:58.222
VERY GOOD.                      
SO THE THE THOUGHT IS GET THAT  
WATER OFF THE PAVEMENT VERY     

01:00:58.224 --> 01:00:58.490
SO THE THE THOUGHT IS GET THAT  
WATER OFF THE PAVEMENT VERY     
QUICKLY.

HAVE ANY ANY STORM SEWER ON     
THAT SIDE.                      
IT&amp;apos;S ALL SURFACE FLOW SO THERE

IT&amp;apos;S ALL SURFACE FLOW SO THERE  
IS NO THERE IS NO STORM         

01:01:12.939 --> 01:01:17.475
IT&amp;apos;S ALL SURFACE FLOW SO THERE  
IS NO THERE IS NO STORM

I THINK IN SOME WAYS IT COULD   
BE SORT OF A SIMILAR ROLE TO    

01:10:51.684 --> 01:10:52.483
I THINK IN SOME WAYS IT COULD   
BE SORT OF A SIMILAR ROLE TO    
THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD WHICH   

01:10:52.485 --> 01:10:55.152
BE SORT OF A SIMILAR ROLE TO    
THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD WHICH   
ALSO DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE ANY KIND      

01:10:55.154 --> 01:10:56.186
THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD WHICH   
ALSO DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE ANY KIND      
OF WE JUST LOOK AT THEIR REPORT 

01:10:56.188 --> 01:10:59.890
ALSO DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE ANY KIND

THEY DON&amp;apos;T THEY DON&amp;apos;T PASS      
ANYTHING.                       

01:11:00.259 --> 01:11:00.991
THEY DON&amp;apos;T THEY DON&amp;apos;T PASS      
ANYTHING.

01:11:00.993 --> 01:11:03.461
ANYTHING.

BUT THEY GIVE US A REALLY GOOD  
IDEA OF HOW THINGS FIT INTO THE

RESTAURANT OR RESIDENTIAL SEEMS 
UNLIKELY LIKE I GUESS I&amp;apos;M       
WONDERING LIKE WOULD IT BE      

01:35:01.733 --> 01:35:02.531
UNLIKELY LIKE I GUESS I&amp;apos;M       
WONDERING LIKE WOULD IT BE      
POSSIBLE TO SO THAT&amp;apos;S ONE       

01:35:02.533 --> 01:35:05.834
WONDERING LIKE WOULD IT BE      
POSSIBLE TO SO THAT&amp;apos;S ONE       
THOUGHT LIKE WOULD IT BE        

01:35:05.836 --> 01:35:06.769
POSSIBLE TO SO THAT&amp;apos;S ONE       
THOUGHT LIKE WOULD IT BE        
POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY PULL OUT A 

01:35:06.771 --> 01:35:07.503
THOUGHT LIKE WOULD IT BE        
POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY PULL OUT A 
COUPLE OF USES WHICH WE         

01:35:07.505 --> 01:35:10.373
POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY PULL OUT A 
COUPLE OF USES WHICH WE         
UNDERSTAND TO BE EXCEPTIONS     

01:35:10.375 --> 01:35:11.173
COUPLE OF USES WHICH WE         
UNDERSTAND TO BE EXCEPTIONS     
WHEN IT COMES BOTH TO REUSE AND 

01:35:11.175 --> 01:35:16.645
UNDERSTAND TO BE EXCEPTIONS     
WHEN IT COMES BOTH TO REUSE AND 
TO PARKING PRESSURES AND SO     

01:35:16.647 --> 01:35:17.613
WHEN IT COMES BOTH TO REUSE AND 
TO PARKING PRESSURES AND SO     
THAT WOULD BE ONE THING TO      

01:35:17.615 --> 01:35:17.947
TO PARKING PRESSURES AND SO     
THAT WOULD BE ONE THING TO      
CONSIDER.                       

01:35:17.949 --> 01:35:18.748
THAT WOULD BE ONE THING TO      
CONSIDER.                       
BUT I GUESS MY OTHER THOUGHT    

01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:21.216
CONSIDER.                       
BUT I GUESS MY OTHER THOUGHT    
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THIS PROPOSED 

01:35:21.218 --> 01:35:22.017
BUT I GUESS MY OTHER THOUGHT    
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THIS PROPOSED 
DEVELOPMENT IS THAT WHAT WE ARE 

01:35:22.019 --> 01:35:22.752
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THIS PROPOSED 
DEVELOPMENT IS THAT WHAT WE ARE 
HOPING FOR IN THESE CORRIDORS   

01:35:22.754 --> 01:35:25.087
DEVELOPMENT IS THAT WHAT WE ARE 
HOPING FOR IN THESE CORRIDORS   
IS DENSER DEVELOPMENT.          

01:35:25.089 --> 01:35:29.258
HOPING FOR IN THESE CORRIDORS   
IS DENSER DEVELOPMENT.          
SO THE THE THREE PER THOUSAND   

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:32.862
IS DENSER DEVELOPMENT.          
SO THE THE THREE PER THOUSAND   
MIGHT BE VERY CONSTRICTING TO A 

01:35:32.864 --> 01:35:33.762
SO THE THE THREE PER THOUSAND   
MIGHT BE VERY CONSTRICTING TO A 
RESTAURANT USE BUT IF THEY HAD  

01:35:33.764 --> 01:35:34.464
MIGHT BE VERY CONSTRICTING TO A 
RESTAURANT USE BUT IF THEY HAD  
RESIDENTIAL UNITS ABOVE THE     

01:35:34.466 --> 01:35:36.732
RESTAURANT USE BUT IF THEY HAD  
RESIDENTIAL UNITS ABOVE THE     
THREE THOUSAND IS VERY GENEROUS 

01:35:36.734 --> 01:35:37.466
RESIDENTIAL UNITS ABOVE THE     
THREE THOUSAND IS VERY GENEROUS 
AND THE POINT IS THAT THE       

01:35:37.468 --> 01:35:40.236
THREE THOUSAND IS VERY GENEROUS 
AND THE POINT IS THAT THE       
AVERAGE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE AND  

01:35:40.238 --> 01:35:43.972
AND THE POINT IS THAT THE       
AVERAGE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE AND  
RESPONSIBLE.                    

01:35:43.974 --> 01:35:45.041
AVERAGE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE AND  
RESPONSIBLE.                    
AND SO I GUESS BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T 

01:35:45.043 --> 01:35:48.377
RESPONSIBLE.                    
AND SO I GUESS BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T 
KNOW WHAT THE RATIOS AND WHAT   

01:35:48.379 --> 01:35:49.078
AND SO I GUESS BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T 
KNOW WHAT THE RATIOS AND WHAT   
THE I GUESS I&amp;apos;M WONDERING MAYBE 

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.747
KNOW WHAT THE RATIOS AND WHAT   
THE I GUESS I&amp;apos;M WONDERING MAYBE 
I COULD DO SOME HELP FROM STAFF 

01:35:51.749 --> 01:35:52.548
THE I GUESS I&amp;apos;M WONDERING MAYBE 
I COULD DO SOME HELP FROM STAFF 
OR EVEN OUR OTHER COMMISSIONERS 

01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:55.984
I COULD DO SOME HELP FROM STAFF 
OR EVEN OUR OTHER COMMISSIONERS 
LIKE WITHOUT ACTUALLY LIKE      

01:35:55.986 --> 01:35:59.822
OR EVEN OUR OTHER COMMISSIONERS 
LIKE WITHOUT ACTUALLY LIKE      
MODELING SCENARIO SCENARIOS HOW 

01:35:59.824 --> 01:36:02.891

HOW DO WE FEEL REASSURED THAT

HOW DO WE FEEL REASSURED THAT   
THAT IT&amp;apos;S THE RIGHT THAT WE&amp;apos;RE  
HITTING THE RIGHT TARGET SO I   

01:36:07.098 --> 01:36:07.764
THAT IT&amp;apos;S THE RIGHT THAT WE&amp;apos;RE  
HITTING THE RIGHT TARGET SO I   
THINK THE COMPARISONS IN THE    

01:36:07.766 --> 01:36:08.564
HITTING THE RIGHT TARGET SO I   
THINK THE COMPARISONS IN THE    
STAFF REPORT WERE VERY HELPFUL  

01:36:08.566 --> 01:36:11.567
THINK THE COMPARISONS IN THE    
STAFF REPORT WERE VERY HELPFUL  
BUT I OBSERVED THE SAME THING

01:36:15.639 --> 01:36:16.239

A RESIDENTIAL THREE PER

01:36:16.241 --> 01:36:18.941
A RESIDENTIAL THREE PER

NOBODY SHOULD BE BUILDING THAT

NOBODY SHOULD BE BUILDING THAT  
MANY.

THAT BUFFER IS IN THERE FOR     
OTHER USES.

ANSWER THAT.                    

01:38:10.488 --> 01:38:11.487
MAYBE WE START I CAN TRY TO     
ANSWER THAT.                    
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME  

01:38:11.489 --> 01:38:14.490
ANSWER THAT.                    
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME  
USES THAT DO GENERATE MORE      

01:38:14.492 --> 01:38:15.324
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME  
USES THAT DO GENERATE MORE      
PARKING THAN ONE WOULD THINK    

01:38:15.326 --> 01:38:15.925
USES THAT DO GENERATE MORE      
PARKING THAN ONE WOULD THINK    
THAT WOULD GENERATE ONE WOULD   

01:38:15.927 --> 01:38:18.661
PARKING THAN ONE WOULD THINK    
THAT WOULD GENERATE ONE WOULD   
BE MEDICAL DENTAL OFFICE WHICH  

01:38:18.663 --> 01:38:22.198
THAT WOULD GENERATE ONE WOULD   
BE MEDICAL DENTAL OFFICE WHICH  
TENDS TO HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH     

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:23.532
BE MEDICAL DENTAL OFFICE WHICH  
TENDS TO HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH     
STAFF RATIO AS WELL AS A HIGH   

01:38:23.534 --> 01:38:26.569
TENDS TO HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH     
STAFF RATIO AS WELL AS A HIGH   
NUMBER OF OF PATIENTS VISITING. 

01:38:26.571 --> 01:38:27.769
STAFF RATIO AS WELL AS A HIGH   
NUMBER OF OF PATIENTS VISITING. 
WE ALSO KNOW THAT GROCERY       

01:38:27.771 --> 01:38:31.239
NUMBER OF OF PATIENTS VISITING. 
WE ALSO KNOW THAT GROCERY       
STORES TEND TO HAVE A LARGE     

01:38:31.241 --> 01:38:35.077
WE ALSO KNOW THAT GROCERY       
STORES TEND TO HAVE A LARGE     
CAPTURE AREA AND PEOPLE TEND TO 

01:38:35.079 --> 01:38:38.280
STORES TEND TO HAVE A LARGE     
CAPTURE AREA AND PEOPLE TEND TO 
SPEND QUITE A LOT OF TIME THERE 

01:38:38.282 --> 01:38:39.381
CAPTURE AREA AND PEOPLE TEND TO 
SPEND QUITE A LOT OF TIME THERE 
INSTEAD OF JUST GOING IN FOR    

01:38:39.383 --> 01:38:40.082
SPEND QUITE A LOT OF TIME THERE 
INSTEAD OF JUST GOING IN FOR    
ONE ITEM PEOPLE MIGHT SPEND A   

01:38:40.084 --> 01:38:42.684
INSTEAD OF JUST GOING IN FOR    
ONE ITEM PEOPLE MIGHT SPEND A   
HALF AN HOUR OR FOUR OR LONGER. 

01:38:42.686 --> 01:38:43.819
ONE ITEM PEOPLE MIGHT SPEND A   
HALF AN HOUR OR FOUR OR LONGER. 
SO WE DO KNOW THERE ARE SOME    

01:38:43.821 --> 01:38:45.721
HALF AN HOUR OR FOUR OR LONGER. 
SO WE DO KNOW THERE ARE SOME    
USERS LIKE THAT THAT THAT WILL  

01:38:45.723 --> 01:38:50.059
SO WE DO KNOW THERE ARE SOME    
USERS LIKE THAT THAT THAT WILL  
GENERATE THAT KIND OF DEMAND.   

01:38:50.061 --> 01:38:53.329
USERS LIKE THAT THAT THAT WILL  
GENERATE THAT KIND OF DEMAND.   
ONE OF THE THINGS I DID         

01:38:53.331 --> 01:38:54.262
GENERATE THAT KIND OF DEMAND.   
ONE OF THE THINGS I DID         
CONSIDER WHEN WHEN YOU BROUGHT  

01:38:54.264 --> 01:38:56.632
ONE OF THE THINGS I DID         
CONSIDER WHEN WHEN YOU BROUGHT  
UP THIS SORT OF DIVERGENCE      

01:38:56.634 --> 01:39:00.535
CONSIDER WHEN WHEN YOU BROUGHT  
UP THIS SORT OF DIVERGENCE      
OF DEMAND BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL   

01:39:00.537 --> 01:39:07.442
UP THIS SORT OF DIVERGENCE      
OF DEMAND BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL   
AND NONRESIDENTIAL IS A CONCEPT 

01:39:07.444 --> 01:39:08.410
OF DEMAND BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL   
AND NONRESIDENTIAL IS A CONCEPT 
OF POSTIN, I&amp;apos;M GOING TO THROW   

01:39:08.412 --> 01:39:09.145
AND NONRESIDENTIAL IS A CONCEPT 
OF POSTIN, I&amp;apos;M GOING TO THROW   
SOMETHING NEW IN THERE BUT IT&amp;apos;S 

01:39:09.147 --> 01:39:11.680
OF POSTIN, I&amp;apos;M GOING TO THROW   
SOMETHING NEW IN THERE BUT IT&amp;apos;S 
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT THE    

01:39:11.682 --> 01:39:14.516
SOMETHING NEW IN THERE BUT IT&amp;apos;S 
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT THE    
POSSIBILITY OF COMING UP WITH A 

01:39:14.518 --> 01:39:15.251
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT THE    
POSSIBILITY OF COMING UP WITH A 
LOWER MAXIMUM FOR RESIDENTIAL   

01:39:15.253 --> 01:39:18.887
POSSIBILITY OF COMING UP WITH A 
LOWER MAXIMUM FOR RESIDENTIAL   
USES AND THEN THREE FOUR        

01:39:18.889 --> 01:39:19.588
LOWER MAXIMUM FOR RESIDENTIAL   
USES AND THEN THREE FOUR        
THOUSAND FOR NONRESIDENTIAL     

01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.789
USES AND THEN THREE FOUR        
THOUSAND FOR NONRESIDENTIAL     
USES.

THOUSAND FOR NONRESIDENTIAL     
USES.                           
SO YOU WE CAN SORT OF CREATE    

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:27.262
USES.                           
SO YOU WE CAN SORT OF CREATE    
WHATEVER IS WE THINK IS IS      

01:39:27.264 --> 01:39:27.963
SO YOU WE CAN SORT OF CREATE    
WHATEVER IS WE THINK IS IS      
REASONABLE AND THAT&amp;apos;S JUST AN

IDEA THAT I AFTER LISTENING TO  
WHAT WHAT YOU HAD SAID ABOUT    
THAT DEVIATION, MR. LEONARD     

01:39:34.338 --> 01:39:36.739
WHAT WHAT YOU HAD SAID ABOUT    
THAT DEVIATION, MR. LEONARD     
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO  

01:39:36.741 --> 01:39:40.842
THAT DEVIATION, MR. LEONARD     
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO  
THAT?                           

01:39:40.844 --> 01:39:41.077
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO  
THAT?                           
YEAH.                           

01:39:41.079 --> 01:39:43.912
THAT?                           
YEAH.                           
I MEAN I THINK THIS IS IT

YEAH.                           
I MEAN I THINK THIS IS IT       
RELATES TO THE QUESTION         

01:39:44.815 --> 01:39:45.381
I MEAN I THINK THIS IS IT       
RELATES TO THE QUESTION         
OF CONVERSION LIKE I DO THINK   

01:39:45.383 --> 01:39:48.116
RELATES TO THE QUESTION         
OF CONVERSION LIKE I DO THINK   
LIKE THAT THAT TYPE             

01:39:48.118 --> 01:39:48.517
OF CONVERSION LIKE I DO THINK   
LIKE THAT THAT TYPE             
OF APPROACH.                    

01:39:48.519 --> 01:39:49.318
LIKE THAT THAT TYPE             
OF APPROACH.                    
IF YOU WERE GOING TO COME UP    

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.620
OF APPROACH.                    
IF YOU WERE GOING TO COME UP    
WITH TWO SCENARIOS FOR EXAMPLE  

01:39:51.622 --> 01:39:52.421
IF YOU WERE GOING TO COME UP    
WITH TWO SCENARIOS FOR EXAMPLE  
WHERE RESIDENTIAL WAS A         

01:39:52.423 --> 01:39:53.122
WITH TWO SCENARIOS FOR EXAMPLE  
WHERE RESIDENTIAL WAS A         
DIFFERENT RATE AND COMMERCIAL   

01:39:53.124 --> 01:39:55.958
WHERE RESIDENTIAL WAS A         
DIFFERENT RATE AND COMMERCIAL   
USES WERE A HIGHER RATE,        

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:56.758
DIFFERENT RATE AND COMMERCIAL   
USES WERE A HIGHER RATE,        
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT I THINK 

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.293
USES WERE A HIGHER RATE,        
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT I THINK 
COULD BE OFFICE USES.           

01:39:57.295 --> 01:40:00.496
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT I THINK 
COULD BE OFFICE USES.           
I THINK FROM A PROBABLY FROM I  

01:40:00.498 --> 01:40:03.832
COULD BE OFFICE USES.           
I THINK FROM A PROBABLY FROM I  
I SUSPECT THAT PARKING          

01:40:03.834 --> 01:40:04.733
I THINK FROM A PROBABLY FROM I  
I SUSPECT THAT PARKING          
PROVISION IS PART OF OFFICE     

01:40:04.735 --> 01:40:08.103
I SUSPECT THAT PARKING          
PROVISION IS PART OF OFFICE     
MARKETABILITY THAT THERE ARE    

01:40:08.105 --> 01:40:12.208
PROVISION IS PART OF OFFICE     
MARKETABILITY THAT THERE ARE    
THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT 

01:40:12.210 --> 01:40:13.008
MARKETABILITY THAT THERE ARE    
THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT 
PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHEN  

01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:13.742
THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT 
PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHEN  
THEY&amp;apos;RE CHOOSING TO LOCATE AN   

01:40:13.744 --> 01:40:15.844
PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHEN  
THEY&amp;apos;RE CHOOSING TO LOCATE AN   
OFFICE.                         

01:40:15.846 --> 01:40:16.779
THEY&amp;apos;RE CHOOSING TO LOCATE AN   
OFFICE.                         
IT IS WHAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE        

01:40:16.781 --> 01:40:18.714
OFFICE.                         
IT IS WHAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE        
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THAT IS   

01:40:18.716 --> 01:40:19.581
IT IS WHAT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE        
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THAT IS   
NOT SOMETHING THAT I PROFESS TO 

01:40:19.583 --> 01:40:20.315
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THAT IS   
NOT SOMETHING THAT I PROFESS TO 
KNOW WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE.    

01:40:20.317 --> 01:40:23.252
NOT SOMETHING THAT I PROFESS TO 
KNOW WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE.    
BUT I WOULD SPECULATE THAT IT&amp;apos;S 

01:40:23.254 --> 01:40:24.086
KNOW WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE.    
BUT I WOULD SPECULATE THAT IT&amp;apos;S 
A PRETTY FLUID THING RIGHT NOW  

01:40:24.088 --> 01:40:27.289
BUT I WOULD SPECULATE THAT IT&amp;apos;S 
A PRETTY FLUID THING RIGHT NOW  
BETWEEN COVID I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S   

01:40:27.291 --> 01:40:28.023
A PRETTY FLUID THING RIGHT NOW  
BETWEEN COVID I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S   
BEEN A TREND WHERE OUR OFFICES  

01:40:28.025 --> 01:40:30.826
BETWEEN COVID I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S   
BEEN A TREND WHERE OUR OFFICES  
HAVE STARTED TO BE UTILIZED IN  

01:40:30.828 --> 01:40:31.627
BEEN A TREND WHERE OUR OFFICES  
HAVE STARTED TO BE UTILIZED IN  
A MUCH MORE DENSE FASHION THAN  

01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:33.929
HAVE STARTED TO BE UTILIZED IN  
A MUCH MORE DENSE FASHION THAN  
THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY.         

01:40:33.931 --> 01:40:35.131
A MUCH MORE DENSE FASHION THAN  
THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY.         
BUT NOW OVER THE LAST COUPLE    

01:40:35.133 --> 01:40:38.300
THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY.         
BUT NOW OVER THE LAST COUPLE    
OF YEARS I WOULDN&amp;apos;T I COULDN&amp;apos;T  

01:40:38.302 --> 01:40:39.067
BUT NOW OVER THE LAST COUPLE    
OF YEARS I WOULDN&amp;apos;T I COULDN&amp;apos;T  
GUESS WHAT THE REALITY IS GOING 

01:40:39.069 --> 01:40:45.274
OF YEARS I WOULDN&amp;apos;T I COULDN&amp;apos;T  
GUESS WHAT THE REALITY IS GOING 
TO BE SO                        

01:40:58.955 --> 01:41:01.290
         BUT GOING SO APART     
FROM THAT OTHER EXAMPLE OF SORT 
OF MAYBE A MORE PARKING         

01:41:01.292 --> 01:41:02.024
FROM THAT OTHER EXAMPLE OF SORT 
OF MAYBE A MORE PARKING         
INTENSIVE USE FROM A MARKET     

01:41:02.026 --> 01:41:02.825
OF MAYBE A MORE PARKING         
INTENSIVE USE FROM A MARKET     
VALUE PERSPECTIVE, I THINK IF   

01:41:02.827 --> 01:41:03.492
INTENSIVE USE FROM A MARKET     
VALUE PERSPECTIVE, I THINK IF   
WE WERE GOING TO ESTABLISH TWO  

01:41:03.494 --> 01:41:04.293
VALUE PERSPECTIVE, I THINK IF   
WE WERE GOING TO ESTABLISH TWO  
DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT WOULD  

01:41:04.295 --> 01:41:04.927
WE WERE GOING TO ESTABLISH TWO  
DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT WOULD  
BE PRETTY EASY TO REALIZE.      

01:41:04.929 --> 01:41:05.661
DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT WOULD  
BE PRETTY EASY TO REALIZE.      
OBVIOUSLY THE ONE WE WOULD JUST 

01:41:05.663 --> 01:41:06.461
BE PRETTY EASY TO REALIZE.      
OBVIOUSLY THE ONE WE WOULD JUST 
ESTABLISH THOSE WOULD COUNT UP  

01:41:06.463 --> 01:41:07.129
OBVIOUSLY THE ONE WE WOULD JUST 
ESTABLISH THOSE WOULD COUNT UP  
YOUR RESIDENTIAL AREA WOULD     

01:41:07.131 --> 01:41:07.797
ESTABLISH THOSE WOULD COUNT UP  
YOUR RESIDENTIAL AREA WOULD     
COUNT UP YOUR NONRESIDENTIAL    

01:41:07.799 --> 01:41:08.597
YOUR RESIDENTIAL AREA WOULD     
COUNT UP YOUR NONRESIDENTIAL    
FOR MAYBE APPLIED TO DIFFERENT  

01:41:08.599 --> 01:41:09.265
COUNT UP YOUR NONRESIDENTIAL    
FOR MAYBE APPLIED TO DIFFERENT  
RATIOS AT THE END OF THE DAY,   

01:41:09.267 --> 01:41:09.999
FOR MAYBE APPLIED TO DIFFERENT  
RATIOS AT THE END OF THE DAY,   
IF WE&amp;apos;RE SETTING THEM AS        

01:41:10.001 --> 01:41:10.666
RATIOS AT THE END OF THE DAY,   
IF WE&amp;apos;RE SETTING THEM AS        
MAXIMUMS, IT&amp;apos;S STILL GOING TO   

01:41:10.668 --> 01:41:11.400
IF WE&amp;apos;RE SETTING THEM AS        
MAXIMUMS, IT&amp;apos;S STILL GOING TO   
HAVE A LIMITING FACTOR ON THAT  

01:41:11.402 --> 01:41:11.801
MAXIMUMS, IT&amp;apos;S STILL GOING TO   
HAVE A LIMITING FACTOR ON THAT  
CONVERSION.                     

01:41:11.803 --> 01:41:12.535
HAVE A LIMITING FACTOR ON THAT  
CONVERSION.                     
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ARE         

01:41:12.537 --> 01:41:13.269
CONVERSION.                     
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ARE         
PROVIDING FORCE FOUR FLOORS     

01:41:13.271 --> 01:41:14.069
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ARE         
PROVIDING FORCE FOUR FLOORS     
OF OFFICE AND FOUR FLOORS       

01:41:14.071 --> 01:41:14.770
PROVIDING FORCE FOUR FLOORS     
OF OFFICE AND FOUR FLOORS       
OF RESIDENTIAL AND YOU COME     

01:41:14.772 --> 01:41:16.972
OF OFFICE AND FOUR FLOORS       
OF RESIDENTIAL AND YOU COME     
BACK AND YOU WANT TO CONVERT    

01:41:16.974 --> 01:41:17.773
OF RESIDENTIAL AND YOU COME     
BACK AND YOU WANT TO CONVERT    
ANOTHER FLOOR OF OFFICE TO      

01:41:17.775 --> 01:41:18.507
BACK AND YOU WANT TO CONVERT    
ANOTHER FLOOR OF OFFICE TO      
RESIDENTIAL IF THEY&amp;apos;RE TRULY    

01:41:18.509 --> 01:41:20.576
ANOTHER FLOOR OF OFFICE TO      
RESIDENTIAL IF THEY&amp;apos;RE TRULY    
MAXIMUMS WE CAN IMPROVE THAT    

01:41:20.578 --> 01:41:21.376
RESIDENTIAL IF THEY&amp;apos;RE TRULY    
MAXIMUMS WE CAN IMPROVE THAT    
CONVERSION UNLESS YOU ELIMINATE 

01:41:21.378 --> 01:41:24.312
MAXIMUMS WE CAN IMPROVE THAT    
CONVERSION UNLESS YOU ELIMINATE 
THAT PARKING SO SO THAT&amp;apos;S       

01:41:24.314 --> 01:41:27.883
CONVERSION UNLESS YOU ELIMINATE 
THAT PARKING SO SO THAT&amp;apos;S       
THAT&amp;apos;S THE ARGUMENT FOR FINDING 

01:41:27.885 --> 01:41:28.551
THAT PARKING SO SO THAT&amp;apos;S       
THAT&amp;apos;S THE ARGUMENT FOR FINDING 
A STANDARD THAT WORKS.          

01:41:28.553 --> 01:41:31.820
THAT&amp;apos;S THE ARGUMENT FOR FINDING 
A STANDARD THAT WORKS.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT AGAIN, I WANT TO BE      

01:41:31.822 --> 01:41:35.857
A STANDARD THAT WORKS.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT AGAIN, I WANT TO BE      
CLEAR I WE THERE&amp;apos;S VERY I DON&amp;apos;T

EVOLUTION OF USES IN THESE

TOTAL AREA SO IT IS IT IS VERY  

02:05:36.166 --> 02:05:39.233
AND LIMITS THE AREA HAVE THE    
TOTAL AREA SO IT IS IT IS VERY  
RESTRICTIVE THE VEHICULAR USE   

02:05:39.235 --> 02:05:42.970
TOTAL AREA SO IT IS IT IS VERY  
RESTRICTIVE THE VEHICULAR USE

WITH EITHER ONE HUNDRED PERCENT 
OR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE  

02:05:59.422 --> 02:06:01.823
WITH EITHER ONE HUNDRED PERCENT 
OR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE  
PERCENT OF THE BUILDING         

02:06:01.825 --> 02:06:02.690
OR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE  
PERCENT OF THE BUILDING         
FOOTPRINT NOT FOOT FLOOR AREA.  

02:06:02.692 --> 02:06:06.593
PERCENT OF THE BUILDING         
FOOTPRINT NOT FOOT FLOOR AREA.  
SO THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT IS    

02:06:06.595 --> 02:06:06.927
FOOTPRINT NOT FOOT FLOOR AREA.  
SO THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT IS    
LIMITING.                       

02:06:06.929 --> 02:06:10.364
SO THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT IS    
LIMITING.                       
YOU CAN&amp;apos;T YOU CAN&amp;apos;T DESIGNATE   

02:06:10.366 --> 02:06:14.501
LIMITING.                       
YOU CAN&amp;apos;T YOU CAN&amp;apos;T DESIGNATE   
MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE TO PARKING  

02:06:14.503 --> 02:06:15.302
YOU CAN&amp;apos;T YOU CAN&amp;apos;T DESIGNATE   
MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE TO PARKING  
THAN YOU ARE THE FOOTPRINT      

02:06:15.304 --> 02:06:18.372
MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE TO PARKING  
THAN YOU ARE THE FOOTPRINT      
OF THE BUILDING AND FURTHER     

02:06:18.374 --> 02:06:19.139
THAN YOU ARE THE FOOTPRINT      
OF THE BUILDING AND FURTHER     
BECAUSE WE REQUIRE A MINIMUM    

02:06:19.141 --> 02:06:22.175
OF THE BUILDING AND FURTHER     
BECAUSE WE REQUIRE A MINIMUM    
OF TWO STOREY BUILDINGS THAT    

02:06:22.177 --> 02:06:25.212
BECAUSE WE REQUIRE A MINIMUM    
OF TWO STOREY BUILDINGS THAT    
MEANS THAT YOUR PARKING AREA IS 

02:06:25.214 --> 02:06:26.146
OF TWO STOREY BUILDINGS THAT    
MEANS THAT YOUR PARKING AREA IS 
ALREADY IS ALREADY GOING TO BE  

02:06:26.148 --> 02:06:29.550
MEANS THAT YOUR PARKING AREA IS 
ALREADY IS ALREADY GOING TO BE  
HALF OF THE FLOOR AT THE MOST   

02:06:29.552 --> 02:06:30.450
ALREADY IS ALREADY GOING TO BE  
HALF OF THE FLOOR AT THE MOST   
IT WILL BE HALF OF THE AREA,    

02:06:30.452 --> 02:06:33.287
HALF OF THE FLOOR AT THE MOST   
IT WILL BE HALF OF THE AREA,    
HALF OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE      

02:06:33.289 --> 02:06:39.427
IT WILL BE HALF OF THE AREA,    
HALF OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE      
OF YOUR BUILDING                

02:06:39.861 --> 02:06:45.132
                 POTENTIALLY.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE FAST MATH IS IF YOU   
DO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SQUARE     

02:06:45.134 --> 02:06:48.668
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE FAST MATH IS IF YOU   
DO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SQUARE     
FEET PER SPOT AND IT&amp;apos;S ONE SPOT 

02:06:48.670 --> 02:06:52.539
DO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SQUARE     
FEET PER SPOT AND IT&amp;apos;S ONE SPOT 
LIKE FOUR PER THOUSAND BUT YOU  

02:06:52.541 --> 02:06:56.109
FEET PER SPOT AND IT&amp;apos;S ONE SPOT 
LIKE FOUR PER THOUSAND BUT YOU  
STACK YOU HAVE TWO STORIES      

02:06:56.111 --> 02:06:56.943
LIKE FOUR PER THOUSAND BUT YOU  
STACK YOU HAVE TWO STORIES      
BUILDING YOU&amp;apos;RE NOW TWO PER     

02:06:56.945 --> 02:06:59.313
STACK YOU HAVE TWO STORIES      
BUILDING YOU&amp;apos;RE NOW TWO PER     
FIVE HUNDRED RIGHT.             

02:06:59.315 --> 02:07:00.581
BUILDING YOU&amp;apos;RE NOW TWO PER     
FIVE HUNDRED RIGHT.             
AND SO LIKE THE FOUR PER        

02:07:00.583 --> 02:07:03.884
FIVE HUNDRED RIGHT.             
AND SO LIKE THE FOUR PER        
THOUSAND IS MORE THAN THE THREE 

02:07:03.886 --> 02:07:04.485
AND SO LIKE THE FOUR PER        
THOUSAND IS MORE THAN THE THREE 
THOUSAND SO IT&amp;apos;S A SEPARATE     

02:07:04.487 --> 02:07:07.554
THOUSAND IS MORE THAN THE THREE 
THOUSAND SO IT&amp;apos;S A SEPARATE     
LIMITER IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 

02:07:07.556 --> 02:07:10.758
THOUSAND SO IT&amp;apos;S A SEPARATE     
LIMITER IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
STACK THERE&amp;apos;S TWO WHEN YOU      

02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:11.625
LIMITER IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
STACK THERE&amp;apos;S TWO WHEN YOU      
STACK THERE&amp;apos;S FOUR WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE  

02:07:11.627 --> 02:07:13.393
STACK THERE&amp;apos;S TWO WHEN YOU      
STACK THERE&amp;apos;S FOUR WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE  
FLAT WE&amp;apos;RE AT THREE RIGHT IN    

02:07:13.395 --> 02:07:17.264
STACK THERE&amp;apos;S FOUR WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE  
FLAT WE&amp;apos;RE AT THREE RIGHT IN    
THE MIDDLE.                     

02:07:17.266 --> 02:07:17.931
FLAT WE&amp;apos;RE AT THREE RIGHT IN    
THE MIDDLE.                     
SO QUICK QUESTION.              

02:07:17.933 --> 02:07:21.835
THE MIDDLE.                     
SO QUICK QUESTION.              
SO IF YOU DO IF YOU STACK YOU   

02:07:21.837 --> 02:07:22.602
SO QUICK QUESTION.              
SO IF YOU DO IF YOU STACK YOU   
HAVE TO COUNT EACH FLOOR        

02:07:22.604 --> 02:07:25.773
SO IF YOU DO IF YOU STACK YOU   
HAVE TO COUNT EACH FLOOR        
SEPARATELY SO YOU CAN&amp;apos;T JUST    

02:07:25.775 --> 02:07:26.706
HAVE TO COUNT EACH FLOOR        
SEPARATELY SO YOU CAN&amp;apos;T JUST    
SAY WELL MY FOOT, MY MY         

02:07:26.708 --> 02:07:29.943
SEPARATELY SO YOU CAN&amp;apos;T JUST    
SAY WELL MY FOOT, MY MY         
WHATEVER HATMAKER BUILDING I&amp;apos;M  

02:07:29.945 --> 02:07:33.513
SAY WELL MY FOOT, MY MY         
WHATEVER HATMAKER BUILDING I&amp;apos;M  
PICKING UP A HAPPY OF SPACE.    

02:07:33.515 --> 02:07:34.681
WHATEVER HATMAKER BUILDING I&amp;apos;M  
PICKING UP A HAPPY OF SPACE.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&amp;apos;M JUST GOING TO GO UP WITH 

02:07:34.683 --> 02:07:35.282
PICKING UP A HAPPY OF SPACE.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&amp;apos;M JUST GOING TO GO UP WITH 
MY PARKING STRUCTURE.           

02:07:35.284 --> 02:07:36.550
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&amp;apos;M JUST GOING TO GO UP WITH 
MY PARKING STRUCTURE.           
YOU CAN&amp;apos;T DO IT THAT WAY.       

02:07:36.552 --> 02:07:37.784
MY PARKING STRUCTURE.           
YOU CAN&amp;apos;T DO IT THAT WAY.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, THE INTENTION WAS MORE   

02:07:37.786 --> 02:07:44.458
YOU CAN&amp;apos;T DO IT THAT WAY.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, THE INTENTION WAS MORE   
PEOPLE AND USE LESS CARS.       

02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:45.459
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, THE INTENTION WAS MORE   
PEOPLE AND USE LESS CARS.       
I MEAN IN SOME WAYS IT&amp;apos;S LIKE   

02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:48.195
PEOPLE AND USE LESS CARS.       
I MEAN IN SOME WAYS IT&amp;apos;S LIKE   
IT&amp;apos;D BE SO EXPENSIVE IT&amp;apos;S KIND  

02:07:48.197 --> 02:07:49.062
I MEAN IN SOME WAYS IT&amp;apos;S LIKE   
IT&amp;apos;D BE SO EXPENSIVE IT&amp;apos;S KIND  
OF WHY EVEN LIMIT IT BECAUSE    

02:07:49.064 --> 02:07:51.465
IT&amp;apos;D BE SO EXPENSIVE IT&amp;apos;S KIND  
OF WHY EVEN LIMIT IT BECAUSE    
YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO AUTOMATICALLY   

02:07:51.467 --> 02:07:55.703
OF WHY EVEN LIMIT IT BECAUSE    
YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO AUTOMATICALLY   
YOU KNOW, SO VEHICULAR USE AREA 

02:07:55.705 --> 02:07:56.570
YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO AUTOMATICALLY   
YOU KNOW, SO VEHICULAR USE AREA 
THOUGH TO THE TRICKY PART ABOUT 

02:07:56.572 --> 02:07:57.371
YOU KNOW, SO VEHICULAR USE AREA 
THOUGH TO THE TRICKY PART ABOUT 
THAT IS THAT THAT INCLUDES YOUR 

02:07:57.373 --> 02:07:59.573
THOUGH TO THE TRICKY PART ABOUT 
THAT IS THAT THAT INCLUDES YOUR 
DRIVE.                          

02:07:59.575 --> 02:08:04.011
THAT IS THAT THAT INCLUDES YOUR 
DRIVE.                          
SO REALLY BY HAVING THE PARKING 

02:08:04.013 --> 02:08:07.281
DRIVE.                          
SO REALLY BY HAVING THE PARKING 
AREA AT THE BACK YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING  

02:08:07.283 --> 02:08:08.248
SO REALLY BY HAVING THE PARKING 
AREA AT THE BACK YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING  
SO THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE REALLY LIMITING  

02:08:08.250 --> 02:08:12.286
AREA AT THE BACK YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING  
SO THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE REALLY LIMITING  
WHAT WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT       

02:08:12.288 --> 02:08:14.755
SO THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE REALLY LIMITING  
WHAT WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT       
OF THAT.                        

02:08:14.757 --> 02:08:15.522
WHAT WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT       
OF THAT.                        
AND THEN THEN THERE&amp;apos;S THE       

02:08:15.524 --> 02:08:18.525
OF THAT.                        
AND THEN THEN THERE&amp;apos;S THE       
THINGS LIKE THE FIRE MARSHAL IS 

02:08:18.527 --> 02:08:19.593
AND THEN THEN THERE&amp;apos;S THE       
THINGS LIKE THE FIRE MARSHAL IS 
MAKING US DO TO CURB CUTS AND   

02:08:19.595 --> 02:08:23.430
THINGS LIKE THE FIRE MARSHAL IS 
MAKING US DO TO CURB CUTS AND   
ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF WHICH 

02:08:23.432 --> 02:08:26.900
MAKING US DO TO CURB CUTS AND   
ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF WHICH 
ARE THE REALITIES OF ARE WE     

02:08:26.902 --> 02:08:31.171
ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF WHICH 
ARE THE REALITIES OF ARE WE     
MAKING IS THAT WHAT DOES THAT   

02:08:31.173 --> 02:08:31.438
ARE THE REALITIES OF ARE WE     
MAKING IS THAT WHAT DOES THAT   
DO?                             

02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:35.008
MAKING IS THAT WHAT DOES THAT   
DO?                             
I GUESS IN THAT SCENARIO WHAT   

02:08:35.010 --> 02:08:38.445
DO?                             
I GUESS IN THAT SCENARIO WHAT   
DOES THAT REALLY LOOK LIKE IN   

02:08:38.447 --> 02:08:39.413
I GUESS IN THAT SCENARIO WHAT   
DOES THAT REALLY LOOK LIKE IN   
TERMS OF HOW THAT PLAYS OUT?    

02:08:39.415 --> 02:08:42.283
DOES THAT REALLY LOOK LIKE IN   
TERMS OF HOW THAT PLAYS OUT?    
BECAUSE LIKE WE&amp;apos;RE SAYING, IT&amp;apos;S 

02:08:42.285 --> 02:08:43.384
TERMS OF HOW THAT PLAYS OUT?    
BECAUSE LIKE WE&amp;apos;RE SAYING, IT&amp;apos;S 
NOT IS NOT PER PARKING SPACE.   

02:08:43.386 --> 02:08:46.953
BECAUSE LIKE WE&amp;apos;RE SAYING, IT&amp;apos;S 
NOT IS NOT PER PARKING SPACE.   
IT&amp;apos;S ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF YOU 

02:08:46.955 --> 02:08:47.721
NOT IS NOT PER PARKING SPACE.   
IT&amp;apos;S ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF YOU 
HAVE TO HAVE IN A PARKING LOT   

02:08:47.723 --> 02:08:50.457
IT&amp;apos;S ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF YOU 
HAVE TO HAVE IN A PARKING LOT   
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A PARKING 

02:08:50.459 --> 02:08:50.724
HAVE TO HAVE IN A PARKING LOT   
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A PARKING 
LOT.                            

02:08:50.726 --> 02:08:51.459
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A PARKING 
LOT.                            
AND HOW ARE YOU COUNTING ALL    

02:08:51.461 --> 02:08:54.761
LOT.                            
AND HOW ARE YOU COUNTING ALL    
THE PARKING ISLANDS?            

02:08:54.763 --> 02:08:55.629
AND HOW ARE YOU COUNTING ALL    
THE PARKING ISLANDS?            
IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY&amp;apos;RE     

02:08:55.631 --> 02:08:57.564
THE PARKING ISLANDS?            
IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY&amp;apos;RE     
INTERNAL ARE THEY PART OF YOUR  

02:08:57.566 --> 02:08:58.232
IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY&amp;apos;RE     
INTERNAL ARE THEY PART OF YOUR  
SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT YOU CAN     

02:08:58.234 --> 02:08:59.166
INTERNAL ARE THEY PART OF YOUR  
SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT YOU CAN     
HAVE OR KNOW HOW DOES THAT WORK 

02:08:59.168 --> 02:09:02.502
SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT YOU CAN     
HAVE OR KNOW HOW DOES THAT WORK 
BECAUSE THE SIZES ARE BASED ON, 

02:09:02.504 --> 02:09:06.140
HAVE OR KNOW HOW DOES THAT WORK 
BECAUSE THE SIZES ARE BASED ON, 
YOU KNOW, MINIMUM SIZES TO BE   

02:09:06.142 --> 02:09:06.874
BECAUSE THE SIZES ARE BASED ON, 
YOU KNOW, MINIMUM SIZES TO BE   
ABLE TO GET TREES IN THERE AND  

02:09:06.876 --> 02:09:07.608
YOU KNOW, MINIMUM SIZES TO BE   
ABLE TO GET TREES IN THERE AND  
ALL THAT KIND OF BUSINESS.      

02:09:07.610 --> 02:09:09.944
ABLE TO GET TREES IN THERE AND  
ALL THAT KIND OF BUSINESS.      
SO IS THAT PART OF YOUR         

02:09:09.946 --> 02:09:10.811
ALL THAT KIND OF BUSINESS.      
SO IS THAT PART OF YOUR         
VEHICULAR USE AREA TOO OR NO,   

02:09:10.813 --> 02:09:14.582
SO IS THAT PART OF YOUR

02:20:13.041 --> 02:20:14.273
WE&amp;apos;RE LIMITING IT RIGHT BY      
HAVING THAT.                    
AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN   

02:20:14.275 --> 02:20:20.814
HAVING THAT.                    
AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN   
TERMS OF WHAT WE MAY GET        

02:20:23.918 --> 02:20:27.954
                        ?       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON&amp;apos;T I DON&amp;apos;T THINK WE DID 
THAT SORT OF SCENARIO PLANNING  

02:20:27.956 --> 02:20:28.955
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON&amp;apos;T I DON&amp;apos;T THINK WE DID 
THAT SORT OF SCENARIO PLANNING  
WITH IT AS YOU&amp;apos;RE ASKING THE    

02:20:28.957 --> 02:20:34.460
THAT SORT OF SCENARIO PLANNING  
WITH IT AS YOU&amp;apos;RE ASKING THE    
QUESTION, I THINK I SUSPECT     

02:20:34.462 --> 02:20:38.865
WITH IT AS YOU&amp;apos;RE ASKING THE    
QUESTION, I THINK I SUSPECT     
THAT IF THERE IS AN UNINTENDED  

02:20:38.867 --> 02:20:42.602
QUESTION, I THINK I SUSPECT     
THAT IF THERE IS AN UNINTENDED  
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS, THERE&amp;apos;S    

02:20:42.604 --> 02:20:43.436
THAT IF THERE IS AN UNINTENDED  
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS, THERE&amp;apos;S    
GOING TO BE ONE OR TWO THINGS   

02:20:43.438 --> 02:20:43.837
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS, THERE&amp;apos;S    
GOING TO BE ONE OR TWO THINGS   
THAT HAPPEN.                    

02:20:43.839 --> 02:20:46.839
GOING TO BE ONE OR TWO THINGS   
THAT HAPPEN.                    
YOU&amp;apos;LL GET TWO STOREY BUILDINGS 

02:20:46.841 --> 02:20:49.976
THAT HAPPEN.                    
YOU&amp;apos;LL GET TWO STOREY BUILDINGS 
IN THE ONE CORRIDOR BECAUSE     

02:20:49.978 --> 02:20:54.280
YOU&amp;apos;LL GET TWO STOREY BUILDINGS 
IN THE ONE CORRIDOR BECAUSE     
THAT LIMITER IS PUTTING A       

02:20:54.282 --> 02:20:55.082
IN THE ONE CORRIDOR BECAUSE     
THAT LIMITER IS PUTTING A       
HARDER CAP ON HOW MUCH PARKING  

02:20:55.084 --> 02:20:58.151
THAT LIMITER IS PUTTING A       
HARDER CAP ON HOW MUCH PARKING  
YOU CAN PROVIDE.                

02:20:58.153 --> 02:20:59.152
HARDER CAP ON HOW MUCH PARKING  
YOU CAN PROVIDE.                
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO JUST JUST THINK ABOUT     

02:20:59.154 --> 02:21:02.389
YOU CAN PROVIDE.                
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO JUST JUST THINK ABOUT     
THAT REGULATION IF AS YOU ADD   

02:21:02.391 --> 02:21:04.991
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO JUST JUST THINK ABOUT     
THAT REGULATION IF AS YOU ADD   
STORIES YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT ADDING       

02:21:04.993 --> 02:21:05.625
THAT REGULATION IF AS YOU ADD   
STORIES YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT ADDING       
VEHICULAR USE AREA.             

02:21:05.627 --> 02:21:09.662
STORIES YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT ADDING       
VEHICULAR USE AREA.             
SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT A   

02:21:09.664 --> 02:21:13.233
VEHICULAR USE AREA.             
SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT A   
10000 SQUARE FOOT FOOTPRINT,    

02:21:13.235 --> 02:21:14.100
SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT A   
10000 SQUARE FOOT FOOTPRINT,    
YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO HAVE EITHER A   

02:21:14.102 --> 02:21:17.304
10000 SQUARE FOOT FOOTPRINT,    
YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO HAVE EITHER A   
10000 SQUARE FOOT PARKING AREA  

02:21:17.306 --> 02:21:21.007
YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO HAVE EITHER A   
10000 SQUARE FOOT PARKING AREA  
OR TWELVE FIFTY DEPENDING ON    

02:21:21.009 --> 02:21:21.474
10000 SQUARE FOOT PARKING AREA  
OR TWELVE FIFTY DEPENDING ON    
YOUR LOT OF SIZE.               

02:21:21.476 --> 02:21:25.078
OR TWELVE FIFTY DEPENDING ON    
YOUR LOT OF SIZE.               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I THINK THE MARKET IS 

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:28.748
YOUR LOT OF SIZE.               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I THINK THE MARKET IS 
GOING YOU&amp;apos;D PROBABLY CHALLENGE  

02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:32.786
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I THINK THE MARKET IS 
GOING YOU&amp;apos;D PROBABLY CHALLENGE  
BUILDING FOR STICK TO LEVELS    

02:21:32.788 --> 02:21:36.489
GOING YOU&amp;apos;D PROBABLY CHALLENGE  
BUILDING FOR STICK TO LEVELS    
OVER A PODIUM BECAUSE OF THIS   

02:21:36.491 --> 02:21:40.927
BUILDING FOR STICK TO LEVELS    
OVER A PODIUM BECAUSE OF THIS   
TENSION AND SO I THINK THAT TO  

02:21:40.929 --> 02:21:44.097
OVER A PODIUM BECAUSE OF THIS   
TENSION AND SO I THINK THAT TO  
KEEP TO KEEP THE MAXIMUM AND    

02:21:44.099 --> 02:21:45.031
TENSION AND SO I THINK THAT TO  
KEEP TO KEEP THE MAXIMUM AND    
THAT FOOTPRINT IS IS VERY MUCH  

02:21:45.033 --> 02:21:48.034
KEEP TO KEEP THE MAXIMUM AND    
THAT FOOTPRINT IS IS VERY MUCH  
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE        

02:21:48.036 --> 02:21:48.969
THAT FOOTPRINT IS IS VERY MUCH  
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE        
INTENTION OF THIS IS CHANGE HOW 

02:21:48.971 --> 02:21:52.705
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE        
INTENTION OF THIS IS CHANGE HOW 
THESE CORRIDORS ARE USED.       

02:21:52.707 --> 02:21:55.876
INTENTION OF THIS IS CHANGE HOW 
THESE CORRIDORS ARE USED.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I I THINK THAT I      

02:21:55.878 --> 02:21:56.609
THESE CORRIDORS ARE USED.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I I THINK THAT I      
THINK THE TENSIONS FOR THESE    

02:21:56.611 --> 02:21:59.813
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I I THINK THAT I      
THINK THE TENSIONS FOR THESE    
REGULATIONS ARE THESE ARE THESE 

02:21:59.815 --> 02:22:03.716
THINK THE TENSIONS FOR THESE    
REGULATIONS ARE THESE ARE THESE 
ARE SAYING WE WANT A VERY HIGH  

02:22:03.718 --> 02:22:04.384
REGULATIONS ARE THESE ARE THESE 
ARE SAYING WE WANT A VERY HIGH  
QUALITY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 

02:22:04.386 --> 02:22:10.357
ARE SAYING WE WANT A VERY HIGH  
QUALITY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
AND WE DON&amp;apos;T                    

02:22:24.238 --> 02:22:26.073
             WANT OTHER TYPES   
OF DEVELOPMENT.                 
AND SO I THINK THAT I THINK     

02:22:26.075 --> 02:22:26.873
OF DEVELOPMENT.                 
AND SO I THINK THAT I THINK     
THAT THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO   

02:22:26.875 --> 02:22:27.607
AND SO I THINK THAT I THINK     
THAT THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO   
IS PROBABLY THERE&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE 

02:22:27.609 --> 02:22:28.275
THAT THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO   
IS PROBABLY THERE&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE 
SOME TIME WHERE WE GET          

02:22:28.277 --> 02:22:28.942
IS PROBABLY THERE&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE 
SOME TIME WHERE WE GET          
POTENTIALLY SLOWER DEVELOPMENT  

02:22:28.944 --> 02:22:29.676
SOME TIME WHERE WE GET          
POTENTIALLY SLOWER DEVELOPMENT  
WHILE THE MARKET IS SORTING OUT 

02:22:29.678 --> 02:22:30.544
POTENTIALLY SLOWER DEVELOPMENT  
WHILE THE MARKET IS SORTING OUT 
THESE PARKING TO SQUARE FOOTAGE 

02:22:30.546 --> 02:22:31.111
WHILE THE MARKET IS SORTING OUT 
THESE PARKING TO SQUARE FOOTAGE 
OR WE&amp;apos;RE PROBABLY GOING TO      

02:22:31.113 --> 02:22:31.978
THESE PARKING TO SQUARE FOOTAGE 
OR WE&amp;apos;RE PROBABLY GOING TO      
START WITH TWO STOREY BUILDINGS 

02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:32.512
OR WE&amp;apos;RE PROBABLY GOING TO      
START WITH TWO STOREY BUILDINGS 
AS MY SPECULATION.              

02:22:32.514 --> 02:22:33.113
START WITH TWO STOREY BUILDINGS 
AS MY SPECULATION.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT AGAIN THAT&amp;apos;S VALUABLE.   

02:22:33.115 --> 02:22:33.780
AS MY SPECULATION.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT AGAIN THAT&amp;apos;S VALUABLE.   
THESE ARE BIG PARKING AREAS     

02:22:33.782 --> 02:22:34.448
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT AGAIN THAT&amp;apos;S VALUABLE.   
THESE ARE BIG PARKING AREAS     
THAT WE CAN PUT TO BETTER       

02:22:34.450 --> 02:22:37.918
THESE ARE BIG PARKING AREAS     
THAT WE CAN PUT TO BETTER       
PRODUCTIVE AND OVER TIME I      

02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:38.585
THAT WE CAN PUT TO BETTER       
PRODUCTIVE AND OVER TIME I      
THINK YOU&amp;apos;RE TALKING ABOUT      

02:22:38.587 --> 02:22:41.821
PRODUCTIVE AND OVER TIME I      
THINK YOU&amp;apos;RE TALKING ABOUT      
INCREMENTAL OVER TIME THOSE     

02:22:41.823 --> 02:22:44.357
THINK YOU&amp;apos;RE TALKING ABOUT      
INCREMENTAL OVER TIME THOSE     
STORIES WILL START BEING MORE   

02:22:44.359 --> 02:22:45.025
INCREMENTAL OVER TIME THOSE     
STORIES WILL START BEING MORE   
THEY&amp;apos;LL PROBABLY START          

02:22:45.027 --> 02:22:48.461
STORIES WILL START BEING MORE   
THEY&amp;apos;LL PROBABLY START          
PENCILING OUT MORE BECAUSE      

02:22:48.463 --> 02:22:49.395
THEY&amp;apos;LL PROBABLY START          
PENCILING OUT MORE BECAUSE      
THEY&amp;apos;RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO   

02:22:49.397 --> 02:22:50.096
PENCILING OUT MORE BECAUSE      
THEY&amp;apos;RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO   
PENCIL OUT FOR THE FIRST ONE    

02:22:50.098 --> 02:22:52.698
THEY&amp;apos;RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO   
PENCIL OUT FOR THE FIRST ONE    
BUT IT MIGHT PENCIL OUT FOR THE 

02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:55.935
PENCIL OUT FOR THE FIRST ONE    
BUT IT MIGHT PENCIL OUT FOR THE 
SIXTH OR EIGHTH FLOOR SO THAT&amp;apos;S 

02:22:55.937 --> 02:22:56.869
BUT IT MIGHT PENCIL OUT FOR THE 
SIXTH OR EIGHTH FLOOR SO THAT&amp;apos;S 
SORT OF MY TAKE AND I&amp;apos;LL LEAVE

PAVEMENT.                       
YOU KNOW IF WE REALLY WANT TO   
GO SUSTAINABLE BUT IF YOU THINK 

02:23:18.392 --> 02:23:19.025
YOU KNOW IF WE REALLY WANT TO   
GO SUSTAINABLE BUT IF YOU THINK 
OF FIFTY FIFTY TRADE IN ZERO    

02:23:19.027 --> 02:23:21.961
GO SUSTAINABLE BUT IF YOU THINK

02:23:26.734 --> 02:23:28.868
SO I AM JUST KIND OF IF WE WANT 
TO START SCENARIO PLANNING      
THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.      

02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:32.705
TO START SCENARIO PLANNING      
THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.      
THE OTHER POTENTIAL INTERIM     

02:23:32.707 --> 02:23:33.373
THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.      
THE OTHER POTENTIAL INTERIM     
OUTCOME THAT I THINK COULD      

02:23:33.375 --> 02:23:37.009
THE OTHER POTENTIAL INTERIM     
OUTCOME THAT I THINK COULD      
HAPPEN NOW IS THAT BY REDUCING  

02:23:37.011 --> 02:23:41.080
OUTCOME THAT I THINK COULD      
HAPPEN NOW IS THAT BY REDUCING  
PARKING MINIMUMS AND AGAIN      

02:23:41.082 --> 02:23:41.748
HAPPEN NOW IS THAT BY REDUCING  
PARKING MINIMUMS AND AGAIN      
STAFF CORRECT ME IF I&amp;apos;M WRONG   

02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:44.617
PARKING MINIMUMS AND AGAIN      
STAFF CORRECT ME IF I&amp;apos;M WRONG   
CITYWIDE REDUCING PARKING       

02:23:44.619 --> 02:23:45.551
STAFF CORRECT ME IF I&amp;apos;M WRONG   
CITYWIDE REDUCING PARKING       
MINIMUMS IT MEANS THAT IF THERE 

02:23:45.553 --> 02:23:48.221
CITYWIDE REDUCING PARKING       
MINIMUMS IT MEANS THAT IF THERE 
IS AN EXISTING PARKING LOT,     

02:23:48.223 --> 02:23:49.088
MINIMUMS IT MEANS THAT IF THERE 
IS AN EXISTING PARKING LOT,     
MAYBE NOT THE ONE THAT&amp;apos;S BEING  

02:23:49.090 --> 02:23:51.757
IS AN EXISTING PARKING LOT,     
MAYBE NOT THE ONE THAT&amp;apos;S BEING  
REDEVELOPED BUT THAT IS UNDER   

02:23:51.759 --> 02:23:52.458
MAYBE NOT THE ONE THAT&amp;apos;S BEING  
REDEVELOPED BUT THAT IS UNDER   
UTILIZED THERE IS NOTHING       

02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:52.992
REDEVELOPED BUT THAT IS UNDER   
UTILIZED THERE IS NOTHING       
STOPPING THERE.                 

02:23:52.994 --> 02:23:56.128
UTILIZED THERE IS NOTHING       
STOPPING THERE.                 
THAT KIND OF PARKING SHARING    

02:23:56.130 --> 02:23:57.096
STOPPING THERE.                 
THAT KIND OF PARKING SHARING    
LIKE WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO SEE THOSE 

02:23:57.098 --> 02:23:59.866
THAT KIND OF PARKING SHARING    
LIKE WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO SEE THOSE 
AGREEMENTS AND THERE&amp;apos;S NO       

02:23:59.868 --> 02:24:00.700
LIKE WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO SEE THOSE 
AGREEMENTS AND THERE&amp;apos;S NO       
THERE&amp;apos;S NO REVIEW OF THAT       

02:24:00.702 --> 02:24:00.967
AGREEMENTS AND THERE&amp;apos;S NO       
THERE&amp;apos;S NO REVIEW OF THAT       
ANYMORE.                        

02:24:00.969 --> 02:24:03.736
THERE&amp;apos;S NO REVIEW OF THAT       
ANYMORE.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO MY HOPE IS THAT THE   

02:24:03.738 --> 02:24:04.503
ANYMORE.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO MY HOPE IS THAT THE   
EXCESSIVE OVERFLOW PARKING THAT 

02:24:04.505 --> 02:24:08.241
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO MY HOPE IS THAT THE   
EXCESSIVE OVERFLOW PARKING THAT 
ALREADY EXISTS IN SOME OF THOSE 

02:24:08.243 --> 02:24:12.212
EXCESSIVE OVERFLOW PARKING THAT 
ALREADY EXISTS IN SOME OF THOSE 
PLACES BY NOW NOT HOLDING THOSE 

02:24:12.214 --> 02:24:12.945
ALREADY EXISTS IN SOME OF THOSE 
PLACES BY NOW NOT HOLDING THOSE 
INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS TO THOSE   

02:24:12.947 --> 02:24:16.348
PLACES BY NOW NOT HOLDING THOSE 
INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS TO THOSE   
MINIMUMS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR   

02:24:16.350 --> 02:24:19.953
INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS TO THOSE   
MINIMUMS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR   
SOME OF THAT TRANSITION UNTIL   

02:24:19.955 --> 02:24:23.790
MINIMUMS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR   
SOME OF THAT TRANSITION UNTIL   
PEOPLE CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE.    

02:24:23.792 --> 02:24:25.124
SOME OF THAT TRANSITION UNTIL   
PEOPLE CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE.

I THINK GENERALLY I WILL SAY    

02:49:40.707 --> 02:49:43.374

I THINK GENERALLY I WILL SAY    
THAT THE MORE STATE LEGISLATIVE

02:49:44.144 --> 02:49:45.010
THAT THE MORE STATE LEGISLATIVE 
TOOLS WE HAVE THE BETTER.       
SO MY INCLINATION WOULD BE TO   

02:49:45.012 --> 02:49:47.346

02:49:50.417 --> 02:49:51.383
IN THE CONTEXT OF LIMITED       
RESOURCES.                      
MAYBE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING     

02:49:51.385 --> 02:49:51.983

03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:14.691
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SECOND MAJOR REASON I    
THINK WE FAILED IS THAT NO ONE  
KNOWS A RELATIVE IMPACT OF THE  

03:07:14.693 --> 03:07:15.760
THINK WE FAILED IS THAT NO ONE  
KNOWS A RELATIVE IMPACT OF THE  
DIFFERENT THINGS WE DO IN TERMS 

03:07:15.762 --> 03:07:19.430
KNOWS A RELATIVE IMPACT OF THE  
DIFFERENT THINGS WE DO IN TERMS 
OF EMISSIONS AND THIS IS WHAT I 

03:07:19.432 --> 03:07:20.164
DIFFERENT THINGS WE DO IN TERMS 
OF EMISSIONS AND THIS IS WHAT I 
TRIED TO DO IN SOME OF MY       

03:07:20.166 --> 03:07:23.066
OF EMISSIONS AND THIS IS WHAT I 
TRIED TO DO IN SOME OF MY       
LETTERS TO YOU AND SOME OF MY   

03:07:23.068 --> 03:07:23.900
TRIED TO DO IN SOME OF MY       
LETTERS TO YOU AND SOME OF MY   
COMMENTS IS TO QUANTIFY A BIT   

03:07:23.902 --> 03:07:26.970
LETTERS TO YOU AND SOME OF MY   
COMMENTS IS TO QUANTIFY A BIT   
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE.      

03:07:26.972 --> 03:07:27.938
COMMENTS IS TO QUANTIFY A BIT   
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE.      
FOR EXAMPLE, CO TWO, THEY&amp;apos;RE    

03:07:27.940 --> 03:07:30.807
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE.      
FOR EXAMPLE, CO TWO, THEY&amp;apos;RE    
GOING WITH GAS.                 

03:07:30.809 --> 03:07:31.775
FOR EXAMPLE, CO TWO, THEY&amp;apos;RE    
GOING WITH GAS.                 
I THINK IT&amp;apos;S VERY FAIR TO       

03:07:31.777 --> 03:07:34.911
GOING WITH GAS.                 
I THINK IT&amp;apos;S VERY FAIR TO       
ASSUME AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW,  

03:07:34.913 --> 03:07:35.845
I THINK IT&amp;apos;S VERY FAIR TO       
ASSUME AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW,  
I CALCULATE NINE HUNDRED AND    

03:07:35.847 --> 03:07:39.049
ASSUME AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW,  
I CALCULATE NINE HUNDRED AND    
TEN METRIC CO2 EQUIVALENT       

03:07:39.051 --> 03:07:39.917
I CALCULATE NINE HUNDRED AND    
TEN METRIC CO2 EQUIVALENT       
EMISSIONS A YEAR IF YOU INCLUDE 

03:07:39.919 --> 03:07:41.719
TEN METRIC CO2 EQUIVALENT       
EMISSIONS A YEAR IF YOU INCLUDE 
UPSTREAM METHANE EMISSIONS FROM 

03:07:41.721 --> 03:07:45.855
EMISSIONS A YEAR IF YOU INCLUDE 
UPSTREAM METHANE EMISSIONS FROM 
THAT.                           

03:07:45.857 --> 03:07:46.957
UPSTREAM METHANE EMISSIONS FROM 
THAT.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I GUESS WHAT I&amp;apos;M GETTING  

03:07:46.959 --> 03:07:49.693
THAT.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I GUESS WHAT I&amp;apos;M GETTING  
TO IS IS COMMISSIONER WYTCHES   

03:07:49.695 --> 03:07:50.560
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I GUESS WHAT I&amp;apos;M GETTING  
TO IS IS COMMISSIONER WYTCHES   
VERY SENSIBLE IDEA PRETTY

SHE PUTS TOGETHER BRILLIANT     
GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES      
ANNUALLY THAT I USE AS A        

03:09:49.081 --> 03:09:52.549
GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES      
ANNUALLY THAT I USE AS A        
RESOURCE MANY OF HER            

03:09:52.551 --> 03:09:53.050
ANNUALLY THAT I USE AS A        
RESOURCE MANY OF HER

RESOURCE MANY OF HER            
CALCULATIONS.                   
SO IF I CAN DO THIS AND THIS IS 

03:09:56.922 --> 03:09:57.721
CALCULATIONS.                   
SO IF I CAN DO THIS AND THIS IS 
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING I NEED TO   

03:09:57.723 --> 03:09:59.389
SO IF I CAN DO THIS AND THIS IS 
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING I NEED TO   
BRING UP WITH THEM WITH YOU AND 

03:09:59.391 --> 03:10:03.226
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING I NEED TO   
BRING UP WITH THEM WITH YOU AND 
I WILL BUT SOME DEVELOPERS ARE  

03:10:03.228 --> 03:10:04.060
BRING UP WITH THEM WITH YOU AND 
I WILL BUT SOME DEVELOPERS ARE  
VERY SOPHISTICATED ISSUES WITH  

03:10:04.062 --> 03:10:07.897
I WILL BUT SOME DEVELOPERS ARE  
VERY SOPHISTICATED ISSUES WITH  
SARTORIUS AS YOU KNOW, BUT THEY 

03:10:07.899 --> 03:10:11.267
VERY SOPHISTICATED ISSUES WITH  
SARTORIUS AS YOU KNOW, BUT THEY 
KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH ENERGY    

03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.968
SARTORIUS AS YOU KNOW, BUT THEY 
KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH ENERGY    
THEY&amp;apos;RE USING AND HOW MUCH      

03:10:11.970 --> 03:10:12.836
KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH ENERGY    
THEY&amp;apos;RE USING AND HOW MUCH      
EMISSIONS THEY&amp;apos;RE PUTTING OUT   

03:10:12.838 --> 03:10:15.339
THEY&amp;apos;RE USING AND HOW MUCH      
EMISSIONS THEY&amp;apos;RE PUTTING OUT   
EVEN THOUGH THEY DON&amp;apos;T THEY     

03:10:15.341 --> 03:10:16.206
EMISSIONS THEY&amp;apos;RE PUTTING OUT   
EVEN THOUGH THEY DON&amp;apos;T THEY     
DON&amp;apos;T DISCLOSE THAT THEY THEY   

03:10:16.208 --> 03:10:16.873
EVEN THOUGH THEY DON&amp;apos;T THEY     
DON&amp;apos;T DISCLOSE THAT THEY THEY   
DID DISCLOSE THEIR ENERGY USE   

03:10:16.875 --> 03:10:18.809
DON&amp;apos;T DISCLOSE THAT THEY THEY   
DID DISCLOSE THEIR ENERGY USE   
INTENSITY OF THEIR BUILDING     

03:10:18.811 --> 03:10:22.713
DID DISCLOSE THEIR ENERGY USE   
INTENSITY OF THEIR BUILDING     
WHICH IS ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER 

03:10:22.715 --> 03:10:23.380
INTENSITY OF THEIR BUILDING     
WHICH IS ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER 
SQUARE FOOT PER YEAR MUCH       

03:10:23.382 --> 03:10:26.450
WHICH IS ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER 
SQUARE FOOT PER YEAR MUCH       
HIGHER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.   

03:10:26.452 --> 03:10:27.250
SQUARE FOOT PER YEAR MUCH       
HIGHER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.   
SO THAT&amp;apos;S ANOTHER FIGURE THAT   

03:10:27.252 --> 03:10:30.854
HIGHER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.   
SO THAT&amp;apos;S ANOTHER FIGURE THAT   
EITHER WE SHOULD THAT WE SHOULD 

03:10:30.856 --> 03:10:31.588
SO THAT&amp;apos;S ANOTHER FIGURE THAT   
EITHER WE SHOULD THAT WE SHOULD 
TRY TO PIN DEVELOPERS DOWN ON.  

03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:33.990
EITHER WE SHOULD THAT WE SHOULD 
TRY TO PIN DEVELOPERS DOWN ON.  
UM, THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT WE CAN DO IN  

03:10:33.992 --> 03:10:34.825
TRY TO PIN DEVELOPERS DOWN ON.  
UM, THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT WE CAN DO IN  
THIS AREA AND THAT WE SHOULD DO 

03:10:34.827 --> 03:10:35.592
UM, THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT WE CAN DO IN  
THIS AREA AND THAT WE SHOULD DO 
WE JUST NEED WE NEED MORE       

03:10:35.594 --> 03:10:37.561
THIS AREA AND THAT WE SHOULD DO 
WE JUST NEED WE NEED MORE       
INFORMATION.                    

03:10:37.563 --> 03:10:38.629
WE JUST NEED WE NEED MORE       
INFORMATION.                    
IT MAY NOT IN THE END MAKE A    

03:10:38.631 --> 03:10:41.765
INFORMATION.                    
IT MAY NOT IN THE END MAKE A    
DIFFERENCE BUT IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S THIS   

03:10:41.767 --> 03:10:42.299
IT MAY NOT IN THE END MAKE A

03:20:15.640 --> 03:20:16.372
JURISDICTION.                   
SO IT&amp;apos;S A KIND OF AWKWARD       
POSITION TO BE IN AND I THINK   

03:20:16.374 --> 03:20:19.675
SO IT&amp;apos;S A KIND OF AWKWARD       
POSITION TO BE IN AND I THINK   
THAT FRUSTRATION IS WHAT MR     

03:20:19.677 --> 03:20:20.243
POSITION TO BE IN AND I THINK   
THAT FRUSTRATION IS WHAT MR     
LENNON IS POINTING TO.          

03:20:20.245 --> 03:20:22.578
THAT FRUSTRATION IS WHAT MR     
LENNON IS POINTING TO.          
SO AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND WE    

03:20:22.580 --> 03:20:23.479
LENNON IS POINTING TO.          
SO AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND WE    
COULD NOT WRITE INTO THE UDC    

03:20:23.481 --> 03:20:24.146
SO AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND WE    
COULD NOT WRITE INTO THE UDC    
THAT BUILDINGS HAVE TO BE       

03:20:24.148 --> 03:20:27.383
COULD NOT WRITE INTO THE UDC    
THAT BUILDINGS HAVE TO BE       
ELECTRIC ELECTRIFIED BECAUSE    

03:20:27.385 --> 03:20:28.018
THAT BUILDINGS HAVE TO BE       
ELECTRIC ELECTRIFIED BECAUSE    
WE&amp;apos;RE PREVENTED BY LAW FROM     

03:20:28.020 --> 03:20:28.485
ELECTRIC ELECTRIFIED BECAUSE    
WE&amp;apos;RE PREVENTED BY LAW FROM     
DOING IT.                       

03:20:28.487 --> 03:20:29.352
WE&amp;apos;RE PREVENTED BY LAW FROM     
DOING IT.                       
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE 

03:20:29.354 --> 03:20:33.323
DOING IT.                       
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE 
THINGS THAT WE CAN.             

03:20:33.325 --> 03:20:34.323
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE 
THINGS THAT WE CAN.             
I&amp;apos;M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN&amp;apos;T     

03:20:34.325 --> 03:20:34.991
THINGS THAT WE CAN.             
I&amp;apos;M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN&amp;apos;T     
MAKE OUR PRINCIPLES KNOWN.      

03:20:34.993 --> 03:20:37.260
I&amp;apos;M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN&amp;apos;T     
MAKE OUR PRINCIPLES KNOWN.      
WE STILL COULD COMMUNICATE AND  

03:20:37.262 --> 03:20:38.027
MAKE OUR PRINCIPLES KNOWN.      
WE STILL COULD COMMUNICATE AND  
VOCALIZE OUR PREFERENCES AND    

03:20:38.029 --> 03:20:38.794
WE STILL COULD COMMUNICATE AND  
VOCALIZE OUR PREFERENCES AND    
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT  

03:20:38.796 --> 03:20:39.062
VOCALIZE OUR PREFERENCES AND    
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT  
WE WANT.                        

03:20:39.064 --> 03:20:41.664
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT  
WE WANT.                        
BUT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER     

03:20:41.666 --> 03:20:42.398
WE WANT.                        
BUT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER     
LEVERS WE SHOULD BE PULLING     

03:20:42.400 --> 03:20:42.932
BUT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER     
LEVERS WE SHOULD BE PULLING     
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE NOT.                 

03:20:42.934 --> 03:20:47.403
LEVERS WE SHOULD BE PULLING     
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE NOT.                 
SO I LIKE THAT IDEA.            

03:20:47.405 --> 03:20:51.240
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE NOT.                 
SO I LIKE THAT IDEA.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COMMISSIONER DISH WE&amp;apos;VE HAD  

03:20:51.242 --> 03:20:52.241

THIS WE&amp;apos;VE GONE WE&amp;apos;VE THIS IS   
ANOTHER ITERATION AND I AM      
ENTIRELY ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA 

03:20:55.580 --> 03:20:58.714
ANOTHER ITERATION AND I AM      
ENTIRELY ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA 
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THE     

03:20:58.716 --> 03:20:59.248
ENTIRELY ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA 
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THE     
THINGS WE CAN DO.               

03:20:59.250 --> 03:21:02.818
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THE     
THINGS WE CAN DO.               
BUT I THINK WHAT CAME UP IN OUR 

03:21:02.820 --> 03:21:03.553
THINGS WE CAN DO.               
BUT I THINK WHAT CAME UP IN OUR 
DISCUSSION TONIGHT WITH THIS    

03:21:03.555 --> 03:21:09.759
BUT I THINK WHAT CAME UP IN OUR 
DISCUSSION TONIGHT WITH THIS

MOST PEOPLE DON&amp;apos;T EVEN THINK    
ABOUT THAT.
