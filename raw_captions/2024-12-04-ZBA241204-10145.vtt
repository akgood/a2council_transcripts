00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:19.737
TOWNHOUSES KIND OF WE LOOKED AT 
ALL THE ALTERNATIVES THAT THE   
MASSING OF THAT THEN WE WENT TO 

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:22.507
ALL THE ALTERNATIVES THAT THE   
MASSING OF THAT THEN WE WENT TO 
WE ORIGINALLY STARTED OUT I     

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:23.374
MASSING OF THAT THEN WE WENT TO 
WE ORIGINALLY STARTED OUT I     
GUESS WITH A FOUR WITH A FOUR

THINKING THIS WOULD BE A HIGHER 

00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:28.078
STORY BUILDING FOR UNITS        
THINKING THIS WOULD BE A HIGHER 
DENSITY HOUSING.                

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.348
THINKING THIS WOULD BE A HIGHER 
DENSITY HOUSING.                
SO THE SITE HERE BUT GOING      

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.384
DENSITY HOUSING.                
SO THE SITE HERE BUT GOING      
THROUGH SOME OF THE             

00:15:33.386 --> 00:15:34.251
SO THE SITE HERE BUT GOING      
THROUGH SOME OF THE             
COMPLICATIONS WITH THE HISTORIC 

00:15:34.253 --> 00:15:34.852
THROUGH SOME OF THE             
COMPLICATIONS WITH THE HISTORIC 
DISTRICT COMMISSION STAFF       

00:15:34.854 --> 00:15:38.455
COMPLICATIONS WITH THE HISTORIC 
DISTRICT COMMISSION STAFF       
MEMBERS, IT APPEARED THAT IT    

00:15:38.457 --> 00:15:39.123
DISTRICT COMMISSION STAFF       
MEMBERS, IT APPEARED THAT IT    
NEEDED TO BE MORE COMPATIBLE    

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:41.793
MEMBERS, IT APPEARED THAT IT    
NEEDED TO BE MORE COMPATIBLE    
WITH THE EXISTING SURROUNDING   

00:15:41.795 --> 00:15:42.259
NEEDED TO BE MORE COMPATIBLE    
WITH THE EXISTING SURROUNDING   
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   

00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:45.763
WITH THE EXISTING SURROUNDING   
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
SO THAT'S HOW WE ARRANGED THE   

00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:46.864
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
SO THAT'S HOW WE ARRANGED THE   
PRESENT SITE AND THAT IS TO TRY 

00:15:46.866 --> 00:15:50.101
SO THAT'S HOW WE ARRANGED THE   
PRESENT SITE AND THAT IS TO TRY 
TO BREAK DOWN THE MASSES.       

00:15:50.103 --> 00:15:51.102
PRESENT SITE AND THAT IS TO TRY 
TO BREAK DOWN THE MASSES.       
AND THE MAIN THING WE WANTED TO 

00:15:51.104 --> 00:15:54.338
TO BREAK DOWN THE MASSES.       
AND THE MAIN THING WE WANTED TO 
DO WAS TO HAVE A SMALLER UNITS  

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.941
AND THE MAIN THING WE WANTED TO 
DO WAS TO HAVE A SMALLER UNITS  
MORE LIKE THE RESIDENTIAL       

00:15:56.943 --> 00:15:57.675
DO WAS TO HAVE A SMALLER UNITS  
MORE LIKE THE RESIDENTIAL       
NEIGHBORHOOD ON EITHER SIDE.    

00:15:57.677 --> 00:16:00.812
MORE LIKE THE RESIDENTIAL       
NEIGHBORHOOD ON EITHER SIDE.    
NOW THE ELEVATIONS ARE KIND     

00:16:00.814 --> 00:16:01.912
NEIGHBORHOOD ON EITHER SIDE.    
NOW THE ELEVATIONS ARE KIND     
OF COMMERCIAL AND THAT'S A KIND 

00:16:01.914 --> 00:16:05.116
NOW THE ELEVATIONS ARE KIND     
OF COMMERCIAL AND THAT'S A KIND 
OF REFLECTION OF WHAT WE FEEL   

00:16:05.118 --> 00:16:06.116
OF COMMERCIAL AND THAT'S A KIND 
OF REFLECTION OF WHAT WE FEEL   
IS THE CORNER SITE HERE IS SORT 

00:16:06.118 --> 00:16:08.719
OF REFLECTION OF WHAT WE FEEL   
IS THE CORNER SITE HERE IS SORT 
OF COMMERCIAL AND WE WANTED TO  

00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:09.721
IS THE CORNER SITE HERE IS SORT 
OF COMMERCIAL AND WE WANTED TO  
REFLECT THAT IN OUR BUILDING    

00:16:09.723 --> 00:16:13.457
OF COMMERCIAL AND WE WANTED TO  
REFLECT THAT IN OUR BUILDING    
DESIGN AND I THINK THAT THERE   

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:17.161
REFLECT THAT IN OUR BUILDING    
DESIGN AND I THINK THAT THERE   
IS THE ONE SLIDE THAT'S PRETTY  

00:16:17.163 --> 00:16:17.961
DESIGN AND I THINK THAT THERE   
IS THE ONE SLIDE THAT'S PRETTY  
PRETTY EVIDENT OF THE MASSING   

00:16:17.963 --> 00:16:18.830
IS THE ONE SLIDE THAT'S PRETTY  
PRETTY EVIDENT OF THE MASSING   
THERE AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE    

00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:21.699
PRETTY EVIDENT OF THE MASSING   
THERE AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE    
CAN GET THAT BACK UP ON THE     

00:16:21.701 --> 00:16:22.100
THERE AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE    
CAN GET THAT BACK UP ON THE     
SCREEN.                         

00:16:22.102 --> 00:16:22.833
CAN GET THAT BACK UP ON THE     
SCREEN.                         
>> I THINK IT'S I CAN'T BECAUSE 

00:16:22.835 --> 00:16:23.634
SCREEN.                         
>> I THINK IT'S I CAN'T BECAUSE 
I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE     

00:16:23.636 --> 00:16:24.769
>> I THINK IT'S I CAN'T BECAUSE 
I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE     
MEETING FOR SOME REASON SO I    

00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:25.570
I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE     
MEETING FOR SOME REASON SO I    
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING WELL.   

00:16:25.572 --> 00:16:28.205
MEETING FOR SOME REASON SO I    
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING WELL.   
>> OK, I THINK THAT ONE SLIDE   

00:16:28.207 --> 00:16:28.939
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING WELL.   
>> OK, I THINK THAT ONE SLIDE   
THAT PRETTY WELL SHOWS THE      

00:16:28.941 --> 00:16:29.474
>> OK, I THINK THAT ONE SLIDE   
THAT PRETTY WELL SHOWS THE      
SMALLER SCALE OF THESE          

00:16:29.476 --> 00:16:32.543
THAT PRETTY WELL SHOWS THE      
SMALLER SCALE OF THESE          
RESIDENTS IS HERE COMPARED TO   

00:16:32.545 --> 00:16:36.213
SMALLER SCALE OF THESE          
RESIDENTS IS HERE COMPARED TO   
THE EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD.      

00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:36.747
RESIDENTS IS HERE COMPARED TO   
THE EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD.      
BUT THAT'S OK.                  

00:16:36.749 --> 00:16:40.718
THE EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD.      
BUT THAT'S OK.                  
I THINK THAT THIS SITE YOU      

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.588
BUT THAT'S OK.                  
I THINK THAT THIS SITE YOU      
KNOW, THIS IS VERY BROAD.       

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:45.590
I THINK THAT THIS SITE YOU      
KNOW, THIS IS VERY BROAD.       
BUT THE INTERESTING POINT THIS  

00:16:45.592 --> 00:16:48.892
KNOW, THIS IS VERY BROAD.       
BUT THE INTERESTING POINT THIS  
SITE IS A REALLY AN ANOMALY.    

00:16:48.894 --> 00:16:51.161
BUT THE INTERESTING POINT THIS  
SITE IS A REALLY AN ANOMALY.    
THIS IS DISTRICT HERE IS REALLY 

00:16:51.163 --> 00:16:52.096
SITE IS A REALLY AN ANOMALY.    
THIS IS DISTRICT HERE IS REALLY 
KIND OF NORMALLY I THINK WHEN I 

00:16:52.098 --> 00:16:52.696
THIS IS DISTRICT HERE IS REALLY 
KIND OF NORMALLY I THINK WHEN I 
WORKED IN THE PLANNING          

00:16:52.698 --> 00:16:59.036
KIND OF NORMALLY I THINK WHEN I 
WORKED IN THE PLANNING          
DEPARTMENT FOR FIVE YEARS BACK  

00:16:59.038 --> 00:16:59.737
WORKED IN THE PLANNING          
DEPARTMENT FOR FIVE YEARS BACK  
IN EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY THREE     

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:03.307
DEPARTMENT FOR FIVE YEARS BACK  
IN EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY THREE     
EIGHTY FOUR TO FIVE AND WE      

00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:04.075
IN EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY THREE     
EIGHTY FOUR TO FIVE AND WE      
LOOKED AT SOME OF THESE ZONING  

00:17:04.077 --> 00:17:07.178
EIGHTY FOUR TO FIVE AND WE      
LOOKED AT SOME OF THESE ZONING  
DISTRICTS AT THAT TIME AND IT   

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.179
LOOKED AT SOME OF THESE ZONING  
DISTRICTS AT THAT TIME AND IT   
WAS AT THAT TIME THERE WAS THIS 

00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:11.915
DISTRICTS AT THAT TIME AND IT   
WAS AT THAT TIME THERE WAS THIS 
IDEA THAT MAYBE IF YOU ZONE IT  

00:17:11.917 --> 00:17:14.985
WAS AT THAT TIME THERE WAS THIS 
IDEA THAT MAYBE IF YOU ZONE IT  
WHAT WILL BE ARMON CLEANERS     

00:17:14.987 --> 00:17:15.919
IDEA THAT MAYBE IF YOU ZONE IT  
WHAT WILL BE ARMON CLEANERS     
WILL TURN INTO A STRING         

00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:16.554
WHAT WILL BE ARMON CLEANERS     
WILL TURN INTO A STRING         
OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS THERE   

00:17:16.556 --> 00:17:18.689
WILL TURN INTO A STRING         
OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS THERE   
AND IT WILL REFLECT THE KIND    

00:17:18.691 --> 00:17:19.523
OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS THERE   
AND IT WILL REFLECT THE KIND    
OF ZONING THAT WAS SET UP AT    

00:17:19.525 --> 00:17:19.890
AND IT WILL REFLECT THE KIND    
OF ZONING THAT WAS SET UP AT    
THAT TIME.                      

00:17:19.892 --> 00:17:22.760
OF ZONING THAT WAS SET UP AT    
THAT TIME.                      
WELL, THAT NEVER DID HAPPEN AND 

00:17:22.762 --> 00:17:23.494
THAT TIME.                      
WELL, THAT NEVER DID HAPPEN AND 
OF COURSE WHEN THE HISTORIC     

00:17:23.496 --> 00:17:26.263
WELL, THAT NEVER DID HAPPEN AND 
OF COURSE WHEN THE HISTORIC     
DISTRICT COMMISSION WAS         

00:17:26.265 --> 00:17:26.997
OF COURSE WHEN THE HISTORIC     
DISTRICT COMMISSION WAS         
ORGANIZED FOR THE OLD WEST SIDE 

00:17:26.999 --> 00:17:30.034
DISTRICT COMMISSION WAS         
ORGANIZED FOR THE OLD WEST SIDE 
THAT ESSENTIALLY FROZE THE      

00:17:30.036 --> 00:17:30.701
ORGANIZED FOR THE OLD WEST SIDE 
THAT ESSENTIALLY FROZE THE      
DEVELOPMENT PATTERN OF THIS     

00:17:30.703 --> 00:17:33.504
THAT ESSENTIALLY FROZE THE      
DEVELOPMENT PATTERN OF THIS     
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD SO WE'RE NOT 

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:34.271
DEVELOPMENT PATTERN OF THIS     
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD SO WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO SEE ANYTHING THAT      

00:17:34.273 --> 00:17:35.005
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD SO WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO SEE ANYTHING THAT      
RESEMBLES C TO BE HAPPENING IN  

00:17:35.007 --> 00:17:37.508
GOING TO SEE ANYTHING THAT      
RESEMBLES C TO BE HAPPENING IN  
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.              

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.542
RESEMBLES C TO BE HAPPENING IN  
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.              
SO THAT'S KIND OF WHY WE        

00:17:38.544 --> 00:17:41.712
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.              
SO THAT'S KIND OF WHY WE        
DECIDED APPROACH THIS WITH A    

00:17:41.714 --> 00:17:45.249
SO THAT'S KIND OF WHY WE        
DECIDED APPROACH THIS WITH A

DON'T BE THE PRACTICAL          
DIFFICULTIES THAT WOULD RESULT  

00:18:24.223 --> 00:18:27.057
DON'T BE THE PRACTICAL          
DIFFICULTIES THAT WOULD RESULT  
FROM FAILURE TO GRANT THE

DIFFICULTIES THAT WOULD RESULT  
FROM FAILURE TO GRANT THE       
VARIOUS HE SPOKE TO A LITTLE    

00:18:31.197 --> 00:18:34.598
FROM FAILURE TO GRANT THE       
VARIOUS HE SPOKE TO A LITTLE    
BIT MORE ABOUT THE MACING.      

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.532
VARIOUS HE SPOKE TO A LITTLE    
BIT MORE ABOUT THE MACING.      
IT WOULD CHANGE THE CHARACTER   

00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:38.669
BIT MORE ABOUT THE MACING.      
IT WOULD CHANGE THE CHARACTER   
OF THE MASSING IF IT'S WITH A   

00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:42.106
IT WOULD CHANGE THE CHARACTER   
OF THE MASSING IF IT'S WITH A   
VARIANCE WASN'T GRANTED SO      

00:18:42.108 --> 00:18:43.174
OF THE MASSING IF IT'S WITH A   
VARIANCE WASN'T GRANTED SO      
THERE COULD STILL BE SOMETHING  

00:18:43.176 --> 00:18:45.576
VARIANCE WASN'T GRANTED SO      
THERE COULD STILL BE SOMETHING  
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE OF A    

00:18:45.578 --> 00:18:45.843
THERE COULD STILL BE SOMETHING  
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE OF A    
LOT.                            

00:18:45.845 --> 00:18:46.977

SOLUTION I PUT WORDS IN YOUR    
MOUTH BUT COULD YOU JUST SPEAK  

00:18:50.817 --> 00:18:56.754
SOLUTION I PUT WORDS IN YOUR    
MOUTH BUT COULD YOU JUST SPEAK  
TO THAT A LITTLE BIT OF OF THE  

00:18:56.756 --> 00:18:57.555
MOUTH BUT COULD YOU JUST SPEAK

REFLECTED IN THE DESIGN IT WAS  

00:19:04.597 --> 00:19:05.663
OK AND WHAT THEN THAT WOULD BE  
REFLECTED IN THE DESIGN IT WAS  
ASKED I THINK WE HAD A COUPLE   

00:19:05.665 --> 00:19:06.396
REFLECTED IN THE DESIGN IT WAS  
ASKED I THINK WE HAD A COUPLE   
OF QUESTIONS AT THE HISTORIC

00:19:08.434 --> 00:19:09.600
OF QUESTIONS AT THE HISTORIC    
DISTRICT COMMISSION.            
I THINK IT'S WHY WE DIDN'T TAKE 

00:19:09.602 --> 00:19:12.904
DISTRICT COMMISSION.            
I THINK IT'S WHY WE DIDN'T TAKE 
THE GARAGE AND PUSH IT BETWEEN  

00:19:12.906 --> 00:19:15.806
I THINK IT'S WHY WE DIDN'T TAKE 
THE GARAGE AND PUSH IT BETWEEN  
THE TWO BUILDINGS AND WHAT THAT 

00:19:15.808 --> 00:19:19.410
THE GARAGE AND PUSH IT BETWEEN  
THE TWO BUILDINGS AND WHAT THAT 
RESULTS IN IS IS FAR MORE WHAT  

00:19:19.412 --> 00:19:20.211
THE TWO BUILDINGS AND WHAT THAT 
RESULTS IN IS IS FAR MORE WHAT  
COVERAGE OF PAVING IN THE       

00:19:20.213 --> 00:19:24.147
RESULTS IN IS IS FAR MORE WHAT  
COVERAGE OF PAVING IN THE       
PROBABLE AREA GOES UP QUITE A   

00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:25.049
COVERAGE OF PAVING IN THE       
PROBABLE AREA GOES UP QUITE A   
BIT WITH THAT AND THAT WOULD BE 

00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:27.918
PROBABLE AREA GOES UP QUITE A   
BIT WITH THAT AND THAT WOULD BE 
SOMETHING OF THE PLANNING       

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.221
BIT WITH THAT AND THAT WOULD BE 
SOMETHING OF THE PLANNING       
COMMISSION WOULD NOT LOOK AT    

00:19:31.223 --> 00:19:31.622
SOMETHING OF THE PLANNING

KINDLY.                         

00:19:31.624 --> 00:19:32.689
COMMISSION WOULD NOT LOOK AT    
KINDLY.

SMALL SITE THAT'S DIFFICULT TO  
DO.                             
THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE PUSH

DO.                             
THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE PUSH 
THESE THINGS TOGETHER THEN WE

HISTORIC DISTRICT IS I'M PRETTY 

00:23:02.968 --> 00:23:03.633
CREATION OF THE OLD WEST SIDE   
HISTORIC DISTRICT IS I'M PRETTY 
SURE THAT THE TOWNHOUSES I

SURE THAT THE TOWNHOUSES I      
LIVED IN WERE PART OF THE       

00:23:06.438 --> 00:23:07.438
SURE THAT THE TOWNHOUSES I

REASON WHY THAT DISTRICT WAS    

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.441
LIVED IN WERE PART OF THE       
REASON WHY THAT DISTRICT WAS    
CREATED TO STOP THOSE FROM

SO THIS IS REALLY A VERY MIXED

00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:46.903
SO THIS IS REALLY A VERY MIXED  
AREA AND I SORT OF LOOK BACK    
AND THINK PROBABLY ANY TYPE     

00:24:46.905 --> 00:24:47.638

AND THINK PROBABLY ANY TYPE     
OF BUILDING WOULD BE FINE HERE  

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.239
AND THINK PROBABLY ANY TYPE     
OF BUILDING WOULD BE FINE HERE  
IF IT WERE A COMMERCIAL         

00:24:48.241 --> 00:24:48.905

00:24:50.309 --> 00:24:51.041
APARTMENT BUILDING OR WHAT IS   
BEING PROPOSED TODAY.           
SO MY MAIN CONCERN WAS THE WHAT 

00:24:51.043 --> 00:24:51.742
BEING PROPOSED TODAY.           
SO MY MAIN CONCERN WAS THE WHAT 
WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT   

00:24:51.744 --> 00:24:52.543
SO MY MAIN CONCERN WAS THE WHAT 
WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT   
WOULD NOW BE A CLOSE REARWARD   

00:24:52.545 --> 00:24:52.743
WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT   
WOULD NOW BE A CLOSE REARWARD   
LINE.                           

00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:53.543
WOULD NOW BE A CLOSE REARWARD   
LINE.                           
BUT IT'S NOT THE BUILDING AND   

00:24:53.545 --> 00:24:54.278
LINE.                           
BUT IT'S NOT THE BUILDING AND   
YOU JOHN SAID THE BUILDING IS   

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:54.945
BUT IT'S NOT THE BUILDING AND   
YOU JOHN SAID THE BUILDING IS   
GOOD 20 FEET OR SO AWAY.        

00:24:54.947 --> 00:24:55.679
YOU JOHN SAID THE BUILDING IS   
GOOD 20 FEET OR SO AWAY.        
SO THAT'S NO IT'S NOT GOING TO  

00:24:55.681 --> 00:24:57.614
GOOD 20 FEET OR SO AWAY.        
SO THAT'S NO IT'S NOT GOING TO  
BE AS IF THEY COULD REACH OUT   

00:24:57.616 --> 00:24:58.381
SO THAT'S NO IT'S NOT GOING TO  
BE AS IF THEY COULD REACH OUT
