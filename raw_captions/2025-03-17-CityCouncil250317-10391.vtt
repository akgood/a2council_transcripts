01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:30.545
        SO I GUESS THIS IS A    
COUPLE OF PIECES.               
ONE THAT THAT PART MAKES THIS   

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:32.747

THIS ELEMENT OF THE CHANGES     

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:21.830
LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT WE STRIKE  
THIS ELEMENT OF THE CHANGES     
RIGHT NOW TO SEPARATE IT SO WE  

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:22.698
THIS ELEMENT OF THE CHANGES     
RIGHT NOW TO SEPARATE IT SO WE  
CAN HAVE THAT AS A SEPARATE

PREFER TO JUST REMOVE IT AND    
HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT'S FINE 

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:21.423
PREFER TO JUST REMOVE IT AND    
HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT'S FINE 
.                               

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:22.423
HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT'S FINE 
.                               
I MEAN THAT WE CAN HAVE IT A    

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.257
.                               
I MEAN THAT WE CAN HAVE IT A    
DIFFERENT WAY RIGHT NOW IF      

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:29.364
I MEAN THAT WE CAN HAVE IT A    
DIFFERENT WAY RIGHT NOW IF      
REMOVING THE                    

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:36.371
             AND I BELIEVE THAT 
SECTION ALSO CONCERNS ALLOWING  
WHAT WHAT IS AN ALLOWED         

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:36.838
SECTION ALSO CONCERNS ALLOWING  
WHAT WHAT IS AN ALLOWED         
MATERIAL.                       

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.039
WHAT WHAT IS AN ALLOWED         
MATERIAL.                       
RIGHT.                          

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:38.840
MATERIAL.                       
RIGHT.                          
SO THERE MIGHT EVEN BE FURTHER  

01:04:38.842 --> 01:04:42.243
RIGHT.                          
SO THERE MIGHT EVEN BE FURTHER  
DENHA THAT THAT'S NOT RIGHT.    

01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:46.514
SO THERE MIGHT EVEN BE FURTHER  
DENHA THAT THAT'S NOT RIGHT.    
SO I MEAN I WOULD AGREE THAT IT 

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:47.082
DENHA THAT THAT'S NOT RIGHT.    
SO I MEAN I WOULD AGREE THAT IT 
SEEMS LIKE A SEPARATE           

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:47.815
SO I MEAN I WOULD AGREE THAT IT 
SEEMS LIKE A SEPARATE
