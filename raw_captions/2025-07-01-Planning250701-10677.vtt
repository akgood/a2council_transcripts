00:28:49.537 --> 00:28:52.438
THE SECOND HALF IS MUCH BETTER

WOULD JUST MAKE A FEW MEDIUM    
SMALL SUGGESTIONS.              

00:28:53.008 --> 00:28:56.809
WOULD JUST MAKE A FEW MEDIUM

PREPARING ACTIVE USES IN HUB IN 
TRANSITION ACTIVE USES MEANING  

00:29:01.516 --> 00:29:04.851
PREPARING ACTIVE USES IN HUB IN 
TRANSITION ACTIVE USES MEANING  
RETAIL MAYBE SOME OTHER BUT     

00:29:04.853 --> 00:29:08.354
TRANSITION ACTIVE USES MEANING

MOSTLY RETAIL USES.             

00:29:08.356 --> 00:29:09.222
RETAIL MAYBE SOME OTHER BUT     
MOSTLY RETAIL USES.             
I THINK THERE'S HUNDREDS        

00:29:09.224 --> 00:29:10.023
MOSTLY RETAIL USES.             
I THINK THERE'S HUNDREDS        
OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE   

00:29:10.025 --> 00:29:11.724
I THINK THERE'S HUNDREDS        
OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE   
TRANSITION DISTRICT CURRENTLY   

00:29:11.726 --> 00:29:12.491
OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE   
TRANSITION DISTRICT CURRENTLY   
ON ARTERIAL STREETS AND I THINK 

00:29:12.493 --> 00:29:15.728
TRANSITION DISTRICT CURRENTLY   
ON ARTERIAL STREETS AND I THINK 
IT'D BE GOOD TO REASSURE PEOPLE 

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.462
ON ARTERIAL STREETS AND I THINK 
IT'D BE GOOD TO REASSURE PEOPLE 
THAT THERE ARE SINGLE FAMILY    

00:29:16.464 --> 00:29:20.133
IT'D BE GOOD TO REASSURE PEOPLE 
THAT THERE ARE SINGLE FAMILY    
HOUSE IS NOT GOING TO BECOME A  

00:29:20.135 --> 00:29:20.867
THAT THERE ARE SINGLE FAMILY    
HOUSE IS NOT GOING TO BECOME A  
NON CONFORMING USE WITH GROUND  

00:29:20.869 --> 00:29:23.603
HOUSE IS NOT GOING TO BECOME A  
NON CONFORMING USE WITH GROUND  
RETAIL REQUIRE.                 

00:29:23.605 --> 00:29:24.537
NON CONFORMING USE WITH GROUND  
RETAIL REQUIRE.                 
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOFY      

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:25.205
RETAIL REQUIRE.                 
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOFY      
IMPOSITION AND I DON'T THINK    

00:29:25.207 --> 00:29:27.907
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOFY      
IMPOSITION AND I DON'T THINK    
ANYONE ACTUALLY INTENDS THAT.   

00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:29.042
IMPOSITION AND I DON'T THINK    
ANYONE ACTUALLY INTENDS THAT.   
SO I THINK IT COULD BE GOOD TO  

00:29:29.044 --> 00:29:31.577
ANYONE ACTUALLY INTENDS THAT.   
SO I THINK IT COULD BE GOOD TO  
JUST CLARIFY THEY'RE ALSO IN    

00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:32.445
SO I THINK IT COULD BE GOOD TO  
JUST CLARIFY THEY'RE ALSO IN    
THAT SAME SECTION IT SAYS LIGHT 

00:29:32.447 --> 00:29:35.614
JUST CLARIFY THEY'RE ALSO IN    
THAT SAME SECTION IT SAYS LIGHT 
INDUSTRIAL USE IS ALLOWED IN    

00:29:35.616 --> 00:29:36.549
THAT SAME SECTION IT SAYS LIGHT 
INDUSTRIAL USE IS ALLOWED IN    
HUB AND THEN INDUSTRIAL USE IS  

00:29:36.551 --> 00:29:37.083
INDUSTRIAL USE IS ALLOWED IN    
HUB AND THEN INDUSTRIAL USE IS  
ALLOWED IN TRANSITION.          

00:29:37.085 --> 00:29:40.219
HUB AND THEN INDUSTRIAL USE IS  
ALLOWED IN TRANSITION.          
I THINK YOU COULD JUST BE       

00:29:40.221 --> 00:29:40.954
ALLOWED IN TRANSITION.          
I THINK YOU COULD JUST BE       
REASSURING AND MORE ACCURATE BY 

00:29:40.956 --> 00:29:44.056
I THINK YOU COULD JUST BE       
REASSURING AND MORE ACCURATE BY 
SAYING INDUSTRIAL USES THAT ARE 

00:29:44.058 --> 00:29:44.824
REASSURING AND MORE ACCURATE BY 
SAYING INDUSTRIAL USES THAT ARE 
SAFE AND COMPLY WITH THE CITY'S 

00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:47.726
SAYING INDUSTRIAL USES THAT ARE 
SAFE AND COMPLY WITH THE CITY'S 
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ARE       

00:29:47.728 --> 00:29:47.994
SAFE AND COMPLY WITH THE CITY'S 
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ARE       
ALLOWED.                        

00:29:47.996 --> 00:29:48.928
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ARE       
ALLOWED.                        
AND I KNOW THAT'S A LITTLE BIT  

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:49.662
ALLOWED.                        
AND I KNOW THAT'S A LITTLE BIT  
WORDY BUT I THINK WORDING IS    

00:29:49.664 --> 00:29:51.897
AND I KNOW THAT'S A LITTLE BIT  
WORDY BUT I THINK WORDING IS    
HERE IS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE YOU   

00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:52.665
WORDY BUT I THINK WORDING IS    
HERE IS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE YOU   
CAN REASSURE PEOPLE AND BE MORE 

00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:55.702
HERE IS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE YOU   
CAN REASSURE PEOPLE AND BE MORE 
CLEAR AT NO COST.               

00:29:55.704 --> 00:29:59.639
CAN REASSURE PEOPLE AND BE MORE 
CLEAR AT NO COST.               
SO THOSE TWO AND THEN I ALSO    

00:29:59.641 --> 00:30:00.573
CLEAR AT NO COST.               
SO THOSE TWO AND THEN I ALSO    
THINK THERE'S JUST ONE SPOT ON  

00:30:00.575 --> 00:30:01.374
SO THOSE TWO AND THEN I ALSO    
THINK THERE'S JUST ONE SPOT ON  
THE MAP THAT IS KIND OF SUBTLE  

00:30:01.376 --> 00:30:02.909
THINK THERE'S JUST ONE SPOT ON  
THE MAP THAT IS KIND OF SUBTLE  
AND I'M JUST AT FIRST BUT I'M   

00:30:02.911 --> 00:30:06.479
THE MAP THAT IS KIND OF SUBTLE  
AND I'M JUST AT FIRST BUT I'M   
IN WASHED-OUT WHERE THE ROCKIES 

00:30:06.481 --> 00:30:07.146
AND I'M JUST AT FIRST BUT I'M   
IN WASHED-OUT WHERE THE ROCKIES 
IS CURRENTLY MARTILLO.          

00:30:07.148 --> 00:30:07.847
IN WASHED-OUT WHERE THE ROCKIES 
IS CURRENTLY MARTILLO.          
IT'S CURRENTLY MARKED           

00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:13.753
IS CURRENTLY MARTILLO.          
IT'S CURRENTLY MARKED           
RESIDENTIAL                     

00:30:27.635 --> 00:30:30.035
            AND I THINK THE     
CONSULTANTS DID THAT BECAUSE    
IT'S HARD TO BE CURRENTLY WHICH 

00:30:30.037 --> 00:30:30.636
CONSULTANTS DID THAT BECAUSE    
IT'S HARD TO BE CURRENTLY WHICH 
IS WHERE FRATERNITIES AND       

00:30:30.638 --> 00:30:31.304
IT'S HARD TO BE CURRENTLY WHICH 
IS WHERE FRATERNITIES AND       
SORORITIES ARE ALLOWED.         

00:30:31.306 --> 00:30:31.971
IS WHERE FRATERNITIES AND       
SORORITIES ARE ALLOWED.         
THAT AREA IS ALL FRATERNITIES   

00:30:31.973 --> 00:30:32.639
SORORITIES ARE ALLOWED.         
THAT AREA IS ALL FRATERNITIES   
AND SORORITIES AND THE          

00:30:32.641 --> 00:30:33.239
THAT AREA IS ALL FRATERNITIES   
AND SORORITIES AND THE          
EXISTENCE OF THAT RESIDENTIAL   

00:30:33.241 --> 00:30:33.907
AND SORORITIES AND THE          
EXISTENCE OF THAT RESIDENTIAL   
DISTRICT IS GOING TO LIMIT      

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:34.707
EXISTENCE OF THAT RESIDENTIAL   
DISTRICT IS GOING TO LIMIT      
HEIGHTS ON SMU AND THE STUDENT  

00:30:34.709 --> 00:30:35.441
DISTRICT IS GOING TO LIMIT      
HEIGHTS ON SMU AND THE STUDENT  
NEIGHBORHOODS TO THE NORTH.     

00:30:35.443 --> 00:30:36.009
HEIGHTS ON SMU AND THE STUDENT  
NEIGHBORHOODS TO THE NORTH.     
SO I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY      

00:30:36.011 --> 00:30:36.809
NEIGHBORHOODS TO THE NORTH.     
SO I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY      
THAT'S ONE CHANGE COULD BE NOT  

00:30:36.811 --> 00:30:37.476
SO I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY      
THAT'S ONE CHANGE COULD BE NOT  
VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND COULD    

00:30:37.478 --> 00:30:38.211
THAT'S ONE CHANGE COULD BE NOT  
VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND COULD    
ALSO ALLOW MUCH MORE HOUSING    

00:30:38.213 --> 00:30:38.812
VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND COULD    
ALSO ALLOW MUCH MORE HOUSING    
WHERE THERE ALREADY ARE TALL    

00:30:38.814 --> 00:30:39.679
ALSO ALLOW MUCH MORE HOUSING    
WHERE THERE ALREADY ARE TALL    
BUILDINGS AND IT'S REALLY BADLY 

00:30:39.681 --> 00:30:39.946
WHERE THERE ALREADY ARE TALL    
BUILDINGS AND IT'S REALLY BADLY 
NEEDED.                         

00:30:39.948 --> 00:30:40.747
BUILDINGS AND IT'S REALLY BADLY 
NEEDED.                         
SO I WOULD JUST LOOK AT THAT    

00:30:40.749 --> 00:30:41.480
NEEDED.                         
SO I WOULD JUST LOOK AT THAT    
LITTLE AREA SPECIAL ATTENTION   

00:30:41.482 --> 00:30:45.251
SO I WOULD JUST LOOK AT THAT    
LITTLE AREA SPECIAL ATTENTION   
FINALLY I THINK THE BAR FOR AN  

00:30:45.253 --> 00:30:49.221
LITTLE AREA SPECIAL ATTENTION   
FINALLY I THINK THE BAR FOR AN  
HOUR ONE ON THAT TOPIC I GUESS  

00:30:49.223 --> 00:30:49.856
FINALLY I THINK THE BAR FOR AN  
HOUR ONE ON THAT TOPIC I GUESS  
OF HOW TO CONVERT THE STATUS    

00:30:49.858 --> 00:30:52.859
HOUR ONE ON THAT TOPIC I GUESS  
OF HOW TO CONVERT THE STATUS    
QUO TO A NEW CLASSIFICATION.    

00:30:52.861 --> 00:30:56.496
OF HOW TO CONVERT THE STATUS    
QUO TO A NEW CLASSIFICATION.    
I THINK THERE ARE ONE DISTRICT  

00:30:56.498 --> 00:30:57.563
QUO TO A NEW CLASSIFICATION.    
I THINK THERE ARE ONE DISTRICT  
UP SEVEN TO TRANSITION ON THESE 

00:30:57.565 --> 00:30:58.230
I THINK THERE ARE ONE DISTRICT  
UP SEVEN TO TRANSITION ON THESE 
ARTERIAL ROADS IS PROBABLY      

00:30:58.232 --> 00:31:00.566
UP SEVEN TO TRANSITION ON THESE 
ARTERIAL ROADS IS PROBABLY      
GOING HAVE VERY LITTLE EFFECT   

00:31:00.568 --> 00:31:01.367
ARTERIAL ROADS IS PROBABLY      
GOING HAVE VERY LITTLE EFFECT   
BECAUSE THERE'S TAPERING RULES  

00:31:01.369 --> 00:31:01.700
GOING HAVE VERY LITTLE EFFECT   
BECAUSE THERE'S TAPERING RULES  
BUILT IN.                       

00:31:01.702 --> 00:31:02.635
BECAUSE THERE'S TAPERING RULES  
BUILT IN.                       
SO I THINK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE 

00:31:02.637 --> 00:31:04.571
BUILT IN.                       
SO I THINK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE 
COMPROMISE WOULD BE REASONABLE  

00:31:04.573 --> 00:31:07.806
SO I THINK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE 
COMPROMISE WOULD BE REASONABLE  
WHEREAS THE AR4 AND EXISTING    

00:31:07.808 --> 00:31:08.341
COMPROMISE WOULD BE REASONABLE  
WHEREAS THE AR4 AND EXISTING    
HIGH DENSITY MULTIFAMILY        

00:31:08.343 --> 00:31:12.011
WHEREAS THE AR4 AND EXISTING    
HIGH DENSITY MULTIFAMILY        
HOUSING IS PROBABLY THAT'S ONE  

00:31:12.013 --> 00:31:12.745
HIGH DENSITY MULTIFAMILY        
HOUSING IS PROBABLY THAT'S ONE  
PLACE WHERE YOU COULD REDEVELOP 

00:31:12.747 --> 00:31:13.479
HOUSING IS PROBABLY THAT'S ONE  
PLACE WHERE YOU COULD REDEVELOP 
WITH MINIMAL CONTROVERSY.       

00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:15.648
PLACE WHERE YOU COULD REDEVELOP 
WITH MINIMAL CONTROVERSY.       
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE          

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.582
WITH MINIMAL CONTROVERSY.       
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE          
REASONABLE TO FOCUS MORE ON     

00:31:16.584 --> 00:31:19.786
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE          
REASONABLE TO FOCUS MORE ON     
ALLOWING THOSE ARE FOR AREAS TO 

00:31:19.788 --> 00:31:20.453
REASONABLE TO FOCUS MORE ON     
ALLOWING THOSE ARE FOR AREAS TO 
BE TRANSITIONED AND TRADING     

00:31:20.455 --> 00:31:20.986
ALLOWING THOSE ARE FOR AREAS TO 
BE TRANSITIONED AND TRADING     
SOME R-1 AREAS.                 

00:31:20.988 --> 00:31:21.854
BE TRANSITIONED AND TRADING     
SOME R-1 AREAS.                 
I THINK YOU MIGHT GET A BETTER  

00:31:21.856 --> 00:31:24.290
SOME R-1 AREAS.                 
I THINK YOU MIGHT GET A BETTER  
PLAN AS A RESULT.               

00:31:24.292 --> 00:31:25.357
I THINK YOU MIGHT GET A BETTER

TRANSITION ZONE.                
>> I WAS RUN AND MY HOUSE IS AT 

01:43:59.109 --> 01:44:00.208
TRANSITION ZONE.                
>> I WAS RUN AND MY HOUSE IS AT 
A PEAK 16 FEET OFF THE GROUND   

01:44:00.210 --> 01:44:03.745
>> I WAS RUN AND MY HOUSE IS AT 
A PEAK 16 FEET OFF THE GROUND   
AND MY PANELS ARE ALL FACING    

01:44:03.747 --> 01:44:04.479
A PEAK 16 FEET OFF THE GROUND   
AND MY PANELS ARE ALL FACING    
WEST BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE   

01:44:04.481 --> 01:44:06.814
AND MY PANELS ARE ALL FACING    
WEST BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE   
TREES IN THE THE SOUTH SIDE.    

01:44:06.816 --> 01:44:10.519
WEST BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE   
TREES IN THE THE SOUTH SIDE.    
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF I'M      

01:44:10.521 --> 01:44:11.386
TREES IN THE THE SOUTH SIDE.    
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF I'M      
PRETTY SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING   

01:44:11.388 --> 01:44:14.923
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF I'M      
PRETTY SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING   
TO ALLOW AN 80 FOOT BUILDING    

01:44:14.925 --> 01:44:18.026
PRETTY SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING   
TO ALLOW AN 80 FOOT BUILDING    
BECAUSE THIS IS TRANSITION      

01:44:18.028 --> 01:44:19.360
TO ALLOW AN 80 FOOT BUILDING    
BECAUSE THIS IS TRANSITION      
RIGHT NEXT TO ME ON THE WEST    

01:44:19.362 --> 01:44:23.165
BECAUSE THIS IS TRANSITION      
RIGHT NEXT TO ME ON THE WEST    
SIDE WHICH IS THE NEXT HOUSE    

01:44:23.167 --> 01:44:26.901
RIGHT NEXT TO ME ON THE WEST    
SIDE WHICH IS THE NEXT HOUSE    
OVER MY SOLAR PANELS WILL BE    

01:44:26.903 --> 01:44:29.938
SIDE WHICH IS THE NEXT HOUSE    
OVER MY SOLAR PANELS WILL BE    
USELESS BECAUSE I NEED SUN FROM 

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:33.808
OVER MY SOLAR PANELS WILL BE    
USELESS BECAUSE I NEED SUN FROM 
NOON THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND  

01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:37.212
USELESS BECAUSE I NEED SUN FROM 
NOON THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND  
THAT'S WEST.                    

01:44:37.214 --> 01:44:38.347
NOON THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND  
THAT'S WEST.                    
SO I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN YOUR 

01:44:38.349 --> 01:44:41.683
THAT'S WEST.                    
SO I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN YOUR 
PLAN AT ALL ABOUT OUT AND THIS  

01:44:41.685 --> 01:44:42.517
SO I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN YOUR 
PLAN AT ALL ABOUT OUT AND THIS  
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CITY THAT'S 

01:44:42.519 --> 01:44:44.586
PLAN AT ALL ABOUT OUT AND THIS  
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CITY THAT'S 
INTERESTED IN ECOLOGY AND IN    

01:44:44.588 --> 01:44:48.457
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CITY THAT'S 
INTERESTED IN ECOLOGY AND IN    
FACT I HAVE GIVEN TALKS BEFORE  

01:44:48.459 --> 01:44:52.360
INTERESTED IN ECOLOGY AND IN    
FACT I HAVE GIVEN TALKS BEFORE

01:44:57.167 --> 01:45:00.568
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GO SOLAR

THAT I DID THAT BECAUSE THERE'S 

01:45:00.570 --> 01:45:01.670
AND I'M A LITTLE BIT CHAGRINED  
THAT I DID THAT BECAUSE THERE'S 
NOTHING TO SAY THAT AN 80 FOOT  

01:45:01.672 --> 01:45:05.207
THAT I DID THAT BECAUSE THERE'S 
NOTHING TO SAY THAT AN 80 FOOT  
BUILDING CAN BE PUT RIGHT NEXT  

01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.740
NOTHING TO SAY THAT AN 80 FOOT  
BUILDING CAN BE PUT RIGHT NEXT  
TO YOUR HOUSE.

COLOR TO A BLACK.               

03:08:14.926 --> 03:08:15.792
FROM THE RUDD RUST TERRACOTTA   
COLOR TO A BLACK.               
WE ACTUALLY WENT A LITTLE STEP  

03:08:15.794 --> 03:08:18.428
COLOR TO A BLACK.               
WE ACTUALLY WENT A LITTLE STEP  
FURTHER AND WE REMOVED

WE ACTUALLY WENT A LITTLE STEP  
FURTHER AND WE REMOVED          
BALCONIES ON THE FRONT OF THE   

03:08:19.298 --> 03:08:20.096
FURTHER AND WE REMOVED

03:08:20.098 --> 03:08:20.764
BALCONIES ON THE FRONT OF THE   
BUILDING AND WE MADE THEM BOX   
BAY WINDOWS TO BE SIMILAR TO

AT THE TIME WE'RE KIND          
OF QUESTION BY DESIGN REVIEW    
BUT WHAT WAS APPROVED AND WE'VE 

03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:34.844
OF QUESTION BY DESIGN REVIEW    
BUT WHAT WAS APPROVED AND WE'VE 
CHANGED THOSE TO METAL PANELS   

03:08:34.846 --> 03:08:35.545
BUT WHAT WAS APPROVED AND WE'VE 
CHANGED THOSE TO METAL PANELS   
SO THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL         

03:08:35.547 --> 03:08:38.748
CHANGED THOSE TO METAL PANELS   
SO THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL         
INCREASE IN COST AND ONE WE'RE  

03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:39.449
SO THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL         
INCREASE IN COST AND ONE WE'RE  
VERY EXCITED THAT WE'RE ABLE TO 

03:08:39.451 --> 03:08:42.619
INCREASE IN COST AND ONE WE'RE  
VERY EXCITED THAT WE'RE ABLE TO 
GET SO THERE IS MORE SNOW IF    

03:08:42.621 --> 03:08:43.252
VERY EXCITED THAT WE'RE ABLE TO 
GET SO THERE IS MORE SNOW IF    
IT'S ON THE BUILDING.           

03:08:43.254 --> 03:08:45.755
GET SO THERE IS MORE SNOW IF    
IT'S ON THE BUILDING.           
THIS IS THE NEW BUILDING.

IT'S ON THE BUILDING.           
THIS IS THE NEW BUILDING.       
SO IF YOU COULD SEE THE TWO     

03:08:46.825 --> 03:08:49.526
THIS IS THE NEW BUILDING.       
SO IF YOU COULD SEE THE TWO     
LOCATIONS IN THE FRONT WHERE

03:08:53.264 --> 03:08:54.297
THOSE THOSE TWO TALL SKINNY     
ELEMENTS THAT WERE BALCONIES    
THOSE ARE NOW JUST THE BOX BAY  

03:08:54.299 --> 03:08:54.998
ELEMENTS THAT WERE BALCONIES    
THOSE ARE NOW JUST THE BOX BAY  
WINDOW GLASS ELEMENTS SIMILAR   

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:58.201
THOSE ARE NOW JUST THE BOX BAY  
WINDOW GLASS ELEMENTS SIMILAR   
TO THE WINDOW WALL THAT WE HAVE

TO THE WINDOW WALL THAT WE HAVE 
ON THE CORNER THERE ARE TWO     
BALCONIES THAT WE'LL SEE AND    

03:09:01.940 --> 03:09:02.672
ON THE CORNER THERE ARE TWO     
BALCONIES THAT WE'LL SEE AND    
SOME OTHER PICTURES AND THOSE   

03:09:02.674 --> 03:09:04.574
BALCONIES THAT WE'LL SEE AND    
SOME OTHER PICTURES AND THOSE   
HAVE GONE TO BE BLACK.          

03:09:04.576 --> 03:09:05.541

THE PART THAT STICKS OUT IS ON  
THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER.    
YOU CAN SEE THAT'S JUTTING OUT  

03:09:09.648 --> 03:09:10.447
THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER.    
YOU CAN SEE THAT'S JUTTING OUT  
ALL THE WAY TO FOREST AND THAT  

03:09:10.449 --> 03:09:13.149
YOU CAN SEE THAT'S JUTTING OUT  
ALL THE WAY TO FOREST AND THAT  
BASICALLY HAS A TWO STOREY

FITNESS ELEMENT FOR THEIR USE   
ON THAT AND NOW IT IS ADJACENT  
TO WHAT WE'RE REALLY REFERRING  

03:09:17.790 --> 03:09:20.924
ON THAT AND NOW IT IS ADJACENT  
TO WHAT WE'RE REALLY REFERRING  
TO IS THE PLAZA PARK WHICH IS   

03:09:20.926 --> 03:09:21.791
TO WHAT WE'RE REALLY REFERRING  
TO IS THE PLAZA PARK WHICH IS   
MORE OR LESS A TRANSFORMER PARK 

03:09:21.793 --> 03:09:24.861
TO IS THE PLAZA PARK WHICH IS   
MORE OR LESS A TRANSFORMER PARK 
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND   

03:09:24.863 --> 03:09:25.595
MORE OR LESS A TRANSFORMER PARK 
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND   
WE ARE WORKING WITH THE D.A.    

03:09:25.597 --> 03:09:28.865
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND   
WE ARE WORKING WITH THE D.A.    
I'LL LET EVERYBODY KNOW IF

I'LL LET EVERYBODY KNOW IF      
YOU'RE NOT AWARE WE'RE WORKING  
WITH THE DENHA AND THE CITY TO  

03:09:32.538 --> 03:09:33.269
YOU'RE NOT AWARE WE'RE WORKING  
WITH THE DENHA AND THE CITY TO  
IMPROVE THAT SUBSTANTIALLY.     

03:09:33.271 --> 03:09:34.003
WITH THE DENHA AND THE CITY TO  
IMPROVE THAT SUBSTANTIALLY.     
WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET TO     

03:09:34.005 --> 03:09:34.804
IMPROVE THAT SUBSTANTIALLY.     
WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET TO     
TELL YOU WHAT THAT'S GOING TO   

03:09:34.806 --> 03:09:36.539
WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET TO

IT IS GOING TO INCLUDE THE      
TRANSFORMERS WE KNOW WE CAN'T   
GET RID OF THE TRANSFORMERS.    

03:09:40.445 --> 03:09:41.611
TRANSFORMERS WE KNOW WE CAN'T   
GET RID OF THE TRANSFORMERS.    
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE A WAY TO 

03:09:41.613 --> 03:09:43.447
GET RID OF THE TRANSFORMERS.    
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE A WAY TO 
TRY TO BRING THEM INTO THE PARK 

03:09:43.449 --> 03:09:43.780
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE A WAY TO 
TRY TO BRING THEM INTO THE PARK 
ITSELF.                         

03:09:43.782 --> 03:09:44.848
TRY TO BRING THEM INTO THE PARK 
ITSELF.                         
YOU WILL SEE LATER WE'VE MOVED  

03:09:44.850 --> 03:09:47.951
ITSELF.                         
YOU WILL SEE LATER WE'VE MOVED  
THE MURAL FROM SKINNIER WALL    

03:09:47.953 --> 03:09:51.487
YOU WILL SEE LATER WE'VE MOVED  
THE MURAL FROM SKINNIER WALL    
WHICH IS NEXT TO THE TRASH AREA 

03:09:51.489 --> 03:09:52.388
THE MURAL FROM SKINNIER WALL    
WHICH IS NEXT TO THE TRASH AREA 
TRANSFORMERS AND AND WE MOVED   

03:09:52.390 --> 03:09:55.626
WHICH IS NEXT TO THE TRASH AREA 
TRANSFORMERS AND AND WE MOVED   
IT TO ONE OF THE LONGWALLS.     

03:09:55.628 --> 03:09:56.759
TRANSFORMERS AND AND WE MOVED   
IT TO ONE OF THE LONGWALLS.     
SO NOW IT LOOKS OVER THE PARK   

03:09:56.761 --> 03:09:57.027
IT TO ONE OF THE LONGWALLS.     
SO NOW IT LOOKS OVER THE PARK   
AREA.                           

03:09:57.029 --> 03:09:57.927
SO NOW IT LOOKS OVER THE PARK   
AREA.                           
YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU GET TO    

03:09:57.929 --> 03:09:59.529
AREA.                           
YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU GET TO    
THE RENDERINGS.                 

03:09:59.531 --> 03:10:00.731
YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU GET TO    
THE RENDERINGS.                 
NOT A LOT OF DIFFERENCE HERE    

03:10:00.733 --> 03:10:01.298
THE RENDERINGS.                 
NOT A LOT OF DIFFERENCE HERE

MEASURE THE HEIGHT BUT I THINK  

03:20:05.102 --> 03:20:07.937
I'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO TO       
MEASURE THE HEIGHT BUT I THINK  
IT'S LIKE FIVE OR SIX FLOORS

THE CONDUIT BECAUSE OF THE WAY  

03:21:31.823 --> 03:21:32.621
FOR THE ACTUAL SOLAR PANELS AND 
THE CONDUIT BECAUSE OF THE WAY  
THE CODE IS WRITTEN THOUGH TO

THE CONDUIT BECAUSE OF THE WAY  
THE CODE IS WRITTEN THOUGH TO   
MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF SOLAR    

03:21:35.226 --> 03:21:35.991
THE CODE IS WRITTEN THOUGH TO   
MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF SOLAR    
PANELS ON THE ROOF WE'RE USING  

03:21:35.993 --> 03:21:36.859
MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF SOLAR    
PANELS ON THE ROOF WE'RE USING  
LIKE AN ELEVATOR NOT LIKE WE'RE 

03:21:36.861 --> 03:21:39.294
PANELS ON THE ROOF WE'RE USING  
LIKE AN ELEVATOR NOT LIKE WE'RE 
USING ELEVATED TIER STRUCTURE   

03:21:39.296 --> 03:21:40.062
LIKE AN ELEVATOR NOT LIKE WE'RE 
USING ELEVATED TIER STRUCTURE   
TO RAISE THE SOLAR PANELS UP SO 

03:21:40.064 --> 03:21:42.932
USING ELEVATED TIER STRUCTURE   
TO RAISE THE SOLAR PANELS UP SO 
THAT WE SAW A MECHANICAL        

03:21:42.934 --> 03:21:43.599
TO RAISE THE SOLAR PANELS UP SO 
THAT WE SAW A MECHANICAL        
UNDERNEATH THEM THAT RAISE      

03:21:43.601 --> 03:21:44.067
THAT WE SAW A MECHANICAL        
UNDERNEATH THEM THAT RAISE      
TARIFFS AND CREATES A           

03:21:44.069 --> 03:21:47.703
UNDERNEATH THEM THAT RAISE      
TARIFFS AND CREATES A           
STRUCTURAL LOAD THAT WE HAVE TO 

03:21:47.705 --> 03:21:48.237
TARIFFS AND CREATES A           
STRUCTURAL LOAD THAT WE HAVE TO 
PHRASE FOR THE ROOF.            

03:21:48.239 --> 03:21:51.307
STRUCTURAL LOAD THAT WE HAVE TO 
PHRASE FOR THE ROOF.            
SO IT DOES ADD ARE YOU TELLING

YOU GUYS AT SOME POINT APPROVED 

03:22:06.458 --> 03:22:07.055
MECHANICAL UNITS UNDERNEATH AND 
YOU GUYS AT SOME POINT APPROVED 
ENOUGH TIME THINK ENOUGH        

03:22:07.057 --> 03:22:07.323
YOU GUYS AT SOME POINT APPROVED 
ENOUGH TIME THINK ENOUGH        
HEIGHT.                         

03:22:07.325 --> 03:22:09.858
ENOUGH TIME THINK ENOUGH

THANK YOU FOR DOING BECAUSE THE 

03:22:09.860 --> 03:22:13.863
HEIGHT.                         
THANK YOU FOR DOING BECAUSE THE 
VFR UNITS NEED TO BLOW AIR UP   

03:22:13.865 --> 03:22:14.797
THANK YOU FOR DOING BECAUSE THE 
VFR UNITS NEED TO BLOW AIR UP   
TO COOL SO THEY'RE BLOWING ON   

03:22:14.799 --> 03:22:16.632
VFR UNITS NEED TO BLOW AIR UP   
TO COOL SO THEY'RE BLOWING ON   
THE BOTTOM OF THE SOLAR PANELS  

03:22:16.634 --> 03:22:16.966
TO COOL SO THEY'RE BLOWING ON   
THE BOTTOM OF THE SOLAR PANELS  
.                               

03:22:16.968 --> 03:22:18.101
THE BOTTOM OF THE SOLAR PANELS  
.                               
SO CAN WE GO BACK TO THE SLIDE  

03:22:18.103 --> 03:22:21.070
.                               
SO CAN WE GO BACK TO THE SLIDE  
THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE BREAKDOWN 

03:22:21.072 --> 03:22:21.837
SO CAN WE GO BACK TO THE SLIDE  
THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE BREAKDOWN 
OF THE ARE AND THE UNITS?       

03:22:21.839 --> 03:22:28.944
THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE BREAKDOWN 
OF THE ARE AND THE UNITS?       
SURE RIGHT THERE.               

03:22:28.946 --> 03:22:31.881
OF THE ARE AND THE UNITS?       
SURE RIGHT THERE.               
OK, SO WE'RE SAYING THAT IT'S   

03:22:31.883 --> 03:22:32.615
SURE RIGHT THERE.               
OK, SO WE'RE SAYING THAT IT'S   
POTENTIAL THAT CHARLIE'S        

03:22:32.617 --> 03:22:33.482
OK, SO WE'RE SAYING THAT IT'S   
POTENTIAL THAT CHARLIE'S        
NUMBERS ARE CORRECT AND SO THEN 

03:22:33.484 --> 03:22:36.718
POTENTIAL THAT CHARLIE'S        
NUMBERS ARE CORRECT AND SO THEN 
THAT GIVES US WHAT TWO HUNDRED  

03:22:36.720 --> 03:22:40.756
NUMBERS ARE CORRECT AND SO THEN 
THAT GIVES US WHAT TWO HUNDRED  
AND SIXTY FIVE ADDITIONAL BEDS  

03:22:40.758 --> 03:22:44.660
THAT GIVES US WHAT TWO HUNDRED  
AND SIXTY FIVE ADDITIONAL BEDS  
THERE ARE ABOUT WILL THE        

03:22:44.662 --> 03:22:45.261
AND SIXTY FIVE ADDITIONAL BEDS  
THERE ARE ABOUT WILL THE        
INCREASE IN THE BED COUNT       

03:22:45.263 --> 03:22:47.463
THERE ARE ABOUT WILL THE        
INCREASE IN THE BED COUNT       
THOUGH IS IS BEING DRIVEN BY    

03:22:47.465 --> 03:22:50.799
INCREASE IN THE BED COUNT       
THOUGH IS IS BEING DRIVEN BY    
THE ADDITIONAL PARCEL WE WERE   

03:22:50.801 --> 03:22:51.534
THOUGH IS IS BEING DRIVEN BY    
THE ADDITIONAL PARCEL WE WERE   
UTILIZING THE SUSTAINABILITY

OUT THAT IS LEED GOLD           
EQUIVALENT.

OUT THAT IS LEED GOLD           
EQUIVALENT.                     
IT'S AN ALL ELECTRIC NO IT'S IN 

03:23:06.250 --> 03:23:07.182
EQUIVALENT.                     
IT'S AN ALL ELECTRIC NO IT'S IN 
THE CODE YOU GET TO USE IT.     

03:23:07.184 --> 03:23:10.019
IT'S AN ALL ELECTRIC NO IT'S IN 
THE CODE YOU GET TO USE IT.     
YEAH I DON'T THINK I'M SITTING  

03:23:10.021 --> 03:23:10.953
THE CODE YOU GET TO USE IT.     
YEAH I DON'T THINK I'M SITTING  
HERE SAYING YOU DON'T GET TO

I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO      

03:23:12.123 --> 03:23:14.323
USE IT.                         
I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO      
UNDERSTAND IS YOU HAVE THE      

03:23:14.325 --> 03:23:15.258
I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO      
UNDERSTAND IS YOU HAVE THE      
EXPERTIZE THAT I DON'T WHICH IS 

03:23:15.260 --> 03:23:18.994
UNDERSTAND IS YOU HAVE THE      
EXPERTIZE THAT I DON'T WHICH IS 
YOU SEE THE BENEFIT OF IT IN A  

03:23:18.996 --> 03:23:21.763
EXPERTIZE THAT I DON'T WHICH IS 
YOU SEE THE BENEFIT OF IT IN A  
DIFFERENT WAY THAN MAYBE IT WAS 

03:23:21.765 --> 03:23:22.632
YOU SEE THE BENEFIT OF IT IN A  
DIFFERENT WAY THAN MAYBE IT WAS 
INTENDED IN THE CODE BECAUSE    

03:23:22.634 --> 03:23:26.034
DIFFERENT WAY THAN MAYBE IT WAS 
INTENDED IN THE CODE BECAUSE    
IT'S ALLOWING YOU TO UTILIZE    

03:23:26.036 --> 03:23:30.072
INTENDED IN THE CODE BECAUSE    
IT'S ALLOWING YOU TO UTILIZE    
THAT HEIGHT DENSITY OR HEIGHT   

03:23:30.074 --> 03:23:31.006
IT'S ALLOWING YOU TO UTILIZE    
THAT HEIGHT DENSITY OR HEIGHT   
INCREASE TO PUT MORE BEDS, MORE 

03:23:31.008 --> 03:23:34.410
THAT HEIGHT DENSITY OR HEIGHT   
INCREASE TO PUT MORE BEDS, MORE 
UNITS WHICH THEN INCREASES THE  

03:23:34.412 --> 03:23:36.946
INCREASE TO PUT MORE BEDS, MORE 
UNITS WHICH THEN INCREASES THE  
VALUE OF THE PROPERTY ACCORDING 

03:23:36.948 --> 03:23:38.080
UNITS WHICH THEN INCREASES THE  
VALUE OF THE PROPERTY ACCORDING 
TO HOW MR. GARBER INTERPRETED   

03:23:38.082 --> 03:23:42.518
VALUE OF THE PROPERTY ACCORDING 
TO HOW MR. GARBER INTERPRETED   
CHARLIE'S COMMENTS FOR THE LAST 

03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:43.186
TO HOW MR. GARBER INTERPRETED   
CHARLIE'S COMMENTS FOR THE LAST 
DEVELOPMENT YOU SAID SOMETHING

03:23:48.159 --> 03:23:50.058
AND SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY   
SO CAN YOU GO TO THE PARK AND   
FLY?                            

03:23:50.060 --> 03:23:51.293
SO CAN YOU GO TO THE PARK AND   
FLY?

03:23:51.295 --> 03:23:53.128
FLY?                            
>> COULD YOU WENT BY IT VERY    
QUICKLY.                        

03:23:53.130 --> 03:23:56.899
>> COULD YOU WENT BY IT VERY    
QUICKLY.                        
YOU SAID THAT THIS INCREASE     

03:23:56.901 --> 03:23:57.967
QUICKLY.                        
YOU SAID THAT THIS INCREASE     
PARKING IS WHAT IS REQUIRED IN  

03:23:57.969 --> 03:24:01.670
YOU SAID THAT THIS INCREASE     
PARKING IS WHAT IS REQUIRED IN  
THE RULES THAT THAT'S NOT AN    

03:24:01.672 --> 03:24:02.237
PARKING IS WHAT IS REQUIRED IN  
THE RULES THAT THAT'S NOT AN    
ACCURATE STATEMENT.             

03:24:02.239 --> 03:24:05.541
THE RULES THAT THAT'S NOT AN    
ACCURATE STATEMENT.             
HEY, I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND     

03:24:05.543 --> 03:24:06.142
ACCURATE STATEMENT.             
HEY, I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND     
WHAT RULES THEY SAW.            

03:24:06.144 --> 03:24:09.845
HEY, I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND     
WHAT RULES THEY SAW.            
I THOUGHT I WAS SAYING THAT FOR 

03:24:09.847 --> 03:24:10.579
WHAT RULES THEY SAW.            
I THOUGHT I WAS SAYING THAT FOR 
THE BIKES SO THE BIKES WERE IN  

03:24:10.581 --> 03:24:12.448
I THOUGHT I WAS SAYING THAT FOR 
THE BIKES SO THE BIKES WERE IN  
YOU SAID IT FOR PARKING BECAUSE 

03:24:12.450 --> 03:24:13.282
THE BIKES SO THE BIKES WERE IN  
YOU SAID IT FOR PARKING BECAUSE 
I WROTE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT     

03:24:13.284 --> 03:24:15.918
YOU SAID IT FOR PARKING BECAUSE 
I WROTE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT     
BECAUSE THE FIRST THING I WAS   

03:24:15.920 --> 03:24:17.019
I WROTE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT     
BECAUSE THE FIRST THING I WAS   
GOING TO ASK BEFORE WE GOT TO   

03:24:17.021 --> 03:24:17.820
BECAUSE THE FIRST THING I WAS   
GOING TO ASK BEFORE WE GOT TO   
THE SOLAR BUT MR. GARBER MADE   

03:24:17.822 --> 03:24:20.490
GOING TO ASK BEFORE WE GOT TO   
THE SOLAR BUT MR. GARBER MADE   
HIS COMMENTS WAS WHY DID YOU    

03:24:20.492 --> 03:24:21.090
THE SOLAR BUT MR. GARBER MADE   
HIS COMMENTS WAS WHY DID YOU    
INCREASE THE PARKING?           

03:24:21.092 --> 03:24:23.893
HIS COMMENTS WAS WHY DID YOU    
INCREASE THE PARKING?           
IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S  

03:24:23.895 --> 03:24:24.894
INCREASE THE PARKING?           
IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S  
WHAT WAS LEFT OVER WITHIN THE   

03:24:24.896 --> 03:24:25.628
IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S  
WHAT WAS LEFT OVER WITHIN THE   
BUILDING WHEN WE ADDED THAT     

03:24:25.630 --> 03:24:27.964
WHAT WAS LEFT OVER WITHIN THE   
BUILDING WHEN WE ADDED THAT     
WING ON.                        

03:24:27.966 --> 03:24:29.398
BUILDING WHEN WE ADDED THAT     
WING ON.                        
SO I'M SURE IT JUST LAID OUT A  

03:24:29.400 --> 03:24:31.833
WING ON.                        
SO I'M SURE IT JUST LAID OUT A  
LITTLE BIT BETTER IF THE        

03:24:31.835 --> 03:24:32.635
SO I'M SURE IT JUST LAID OUT A  
LITTLE BIT BETTER IF THE        
ADDITIONAL PARTS OF THAT WE ADD 

03:24:32.637 --> 03:24:35.104
LITTLE BIT BETTER IF THE        
ADDITIONAL PARTS OF THAT WE ADD 
I MEAN YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE 

03:24:35.106 --> 03:24:39.007
ADDITIONAL PARTS OF THAT WE ADD 
I MEAN YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE 
BOTH LEVELS OF IT FUNCTION FOR  

03:24:39.009 --> 03:24:39.742
I MEAN YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE 
BOTH LEVELS OF IT FUNCTION FOR  
ACTUAL FUNCTIONAL BUILDING      

03:24:39.744 --> 03:24:40.009
BOTH LEVELS OF IT FUNCTION FOR  
ACTUAL FUNCTIONAL BUILDING

ACTUAL FUNCTIONAL BUILDING      
SPACE.                          
SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY ADDING    

03:24:40.745 --> 03:24:43.512
SPACE.                          
SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY ADDING    
ANY PARKING IN THE ADDITIONAL   

03:24:43.514 --> 03:24:43.845
SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY ADDING    
ANY PARKING IN THE ADDITIONAL   
PARCEL.                         

03:24:43.847 --> 03:24:44.714
ANY PARKING IN THE ADDITIONAL   
PARCEL.                         
IT'S JUST THAT THE GARAGE LAID  

03:24:44.716 --> 03:24:47.683
PARCEL.                         
IT'S JUST THAT THE GARAGE LAID  
OUT LATER BECAUSE YOU COULD     

03:24:47.685 --> 03:24:48.484
IT'S JUST THAT THE GARAGE LAID  
OUT LATER BECAUSE YOU COULD     
HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE WITH   

03:24:48.486 --> 03:24:48.684
OUT LATER BECAUSE YOU COULD     
HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE WITH   
THAT.                           

03:24:48.686 --> 03:24:49.552
HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE WITH   
THAT.                           
YOU COULD HAVE MADE THAT BIKE   

03:24:49.554 --> 03:24:51.853
THAT.                           
YOU COULD HAVE MADE THAT BIKE   
PARKING, COULD HAVE MADE IT     

03:24:51.855 --> 03:24:52.187
YOU COULD HAVE MADE THAT BIKE   
PARKING, COULD HAVE MADE IT     
STORAGE.                        

03:24:52.189 --> 03:24:52.955
PARKING, COULD HAVE MADE IT     
STORAGE.                        
YOU DECIDED TO MAKE IT PARKING.

YOU DECIDED TO MAKE IT PARKING. 
CORRECT?                        

03:24:55.259 --> 03:24:55.891
YOU DECIDED TO MAKE IT PARKING. 
CORRECT?                        
THAT'S CORRECT.

RULES ALLOW YOU TO DO IT AS     
LONG AS IT COMPORTS WITH THE    
UDC.

LONG AS IT COMPORTS WITH THE    
UDC.                            
BUT THESE ARE MY QUESTIONS AND

FRAMING.                        

03:54:30.999 --> 03:54:31.832
PERIODICALLY AND IT'S A BAD     
FRAMING.                        
I THINK WHAT IT'S MISSING IS    

03:54:31.834 --> 03:54:34.902
FRAMING.                        
I THINK WHAT IT'S MISSING IS    
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SAY LIKE WE'RE 

03:54:34.904 --> 03:54:35.769
I THINK WHAT IT'S MISSING IS    
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SAY LIKE WE'RE 
LIKE MAJOR NEW LIKE THERE'S     

03:54:35.771 --> 03:54:38.939
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SAY LIKE WE'RE 
LIKE MAJOR NEW LIKE THERE'S     
ONLY ENOUGH LAND.

LIKE MAJOR NEW LIKE THERE'S     
ONLY ENOUGH LAND.               
THERE'S THIRTEEN PERCENT I      

03:54:39.742 --> 03:54:40.407
ONLY ENOUGH LAND.               
THERE'S THIRTEEN PERCENT I      
THINK THEY'RE LIKE LARGER       

03:54:40.409 --> 03:54:43.277
THERE'S THIRTEEN PERCENT I      
THINK THEY'RE LIKE LARGER       
PARCELS FOR A MAJOR NEW         

03:54:43.279 --> 03:54:46.013
THINK THEY'RE LIKE LARGER       
PARCELS FOR A MAJOR NEW         
DEVELOPMENT AND NOT TO TAKE     

03:54:46.015 --> 03:54:47.114
PARCELS FOR A MAJOR NEW         
DEVELOPMENT AND NOT TO TAKE     
AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT LIKE A  

03:54:47.116 --> 03:54:47.815
DEVELOPMENT AND NOT TO TAKE     
AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT LIKE A  
PERSON BY PERSON COULD BE       

03:54:47.817 --> 03:54:50.050
AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT LIKE A  
PERSON BY PERSON COULD BE       
REDEVELOPED.                    

03:54:50.052 --> 03:54:51.118
PERSON BY PERSON COULD BE       
REDEVELOPED.                    
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF WHAT 

03:54:51.120 --> 03:54:51.652
REDEVELOPED.                    
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF WHAT 
WE'RE GOING FOR INFILL.         

03:54:51.654 --> 03:54:55.456
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF WHAT 
WE'RE GOING FOR INFILL.         
WELL YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S  

03:54:55.458 --> 03:54:57.991
WE'RE GOING FOR INFILL.         
WELL YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S  
ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE FACT    

03:54:57.993 --> 03:54:59.093
WELL YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S  
ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE FACT    
THAT OF ALL OF THE LAND THAT WE 

03:54:59.095 --> 03:54:59.826
ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE FACT    
THAT OF ALL OF THE LAND THAT WE 
ARE TRYING TO ENFORCE THE       

03:54:59.828 --> 03:55:02.496
THAT OF ALL OF THE LAND THAT WE 
ARE TRYING TO ENFORCE THE       
REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT'S     

03:55:02.498 --> 03:55:03.330
ARE TRYING TO ENFORCE THE       
REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT'S     
BASICALLY ZONED MOST OF ITS AH  

03:55:03.332 --> 03:55:10.404
REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT'S     
BASICALLY ZONED MOST OF ITS AH  
ONE IN OUR TWO SO IT COULD IT   

03:55:10.406 --> 03:55:11.138
BASICALLY ZONED MOST OF ITS AH  
ONE IN OUR TWO SO IT COULD IT   
COULD BE CAN BE REWRITTEN.      

03:55:11.140 --> 03:55:13.440

COULD BE CAN BE REWRITTEN.      
>> YEAH OK.                     

03:55:13.442 --> 03:55:16.910
COULD BE CAN BE REWRITTEN.      
>> YEAH OK.                     
>> LIKE WHEN YOU TAKE THE CITY  

03:55:16.912 --> 03:55:18.112
>> YEAH OK.                     
>> LIKE WHEN YOU TAKE THE CITY  
SO MUCH AND IT'S EXEMPT AND     

03:55:18.114 --> 03:55:21.448
>> LIKE WHEN YOU TAKE THE CITY  
SO MUCH AND IT'S EXEMPT AND     
OF THAT ONLY A RELATIVELY SMALL 

03:55:21.450 --> 03:55:22.183
SO MUCH AND IT'S EXEMPT AND     
OF THAT ONLY A RELATIVELY SMALL 
PORTION I THINK I THINK THAT I  

03:55:22.185 --> 03:55:24.318
OF THAT ONLY A RELATIVELY SMALL 
PORTION I THINK I THINK THAT I  
DON'T THINK THE TERM SORT       

03:55:24.320 --> 03:55:25.118
PORTION I THINK I THINK THAT I  
DON'T THINK THE TERM SORT       
OF REDEVELOPMENT IS RIGHT TERM  

03:55:25.120 --> 03:55:27.721
DON'T THINK THE TERM SORT       
OF REDEVELOPMENT IS RIGHT TERM  
THAT IS PROBABLY REDEVELOP THE  

03:55:27.723 --> 03:55:31.759
OF REDEVELOPMENT IS RIGHT TERM  
THAT IS PROBABLY REDEVELOP THE  
AD FOR A HIGHER DENSITY OR      

03:55:31.761 --> 03:55:32.559
THAT IS PROBABLY REDEVELOP THE  
AD FOR A HIGHER DENSITY OR      
THERE'S SOME CHARACTERIZATION   

03:55:32.561 --> 03:55:33.226
AD FOR A HIGHER DENSITY OR      
THERE'S SOME CHARACTERIZATION   
OF THAT THAT THERE'S MORE       

03:55:33.228 --> 03:55:36.730
THERE'S SOME CHARACTERIZATION   
OF THAT THAT THERE'S MORE       
POTENTIAL IN THAT AND SO MAYBE  

03:55:36.732 --> 03:55:40.167
OF THAT THAT THERE'S MORE       
POTENTIAL IN THAT AND SO MAYBE  
JUST MORE CLARIFICATION ON      

03:55:40.169 --> 03:55:40.401
POTENTIAL IN THAT AND SO MAYBE  
JUST MORE CLARIFICATION ON      
THAT.                           

03:55:40.403 --> 03:55:41.334
JUST MORE CLARIFICATION ON      
THAT.                           
I GUESS I'M PUSHING BACK A      

03:55:41.336 --> 03:55:44.004
THAT.                           
I GUESS I'M PUSHING BACK A      
LITTLE BIT ON THE IDEA THAT THE 

03:55:44.006 --> 03:55:45.238
I GUESS I'M PUSHING BACK A      
LITTLE BIT ON THE IDEA THAT THE 
CITY IS BUILT OUT OF GREED AND  

03:55:45.240 --> 03:55:48.675
LITTLE BIT ON THE IDEA THAT THE 
CITY IS BUILT OUT OF GREED AND  
IT'S KIND OF PHRASING THAT      

03:55:48.677 --> 03:55:49.443
CITY IS BUILT OUT OF GREED AND  
IT'S KIND OF PHRASING THAT      
SUGGESTS THAT WE'RE WELL WE CAN 

03:55:49.445 --> 03:55:52.913
IT'S KIND OF PHRASING THAT      
SUGGESTS THAT WE'RE WELL WE CAN 
STOP IS NOT GOING TO HELP US    

03:55:52.915 --> 03:55:53.713
SUGGESTS THAT WE'RE WELL WE CAN 
STOP IS NOT GOING TO HELP US    
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS DOING.   

03:55:53.715 --> 03:55:55.182
STOP IS NOT GOING TO HELP US    
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS DOING.   
BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WAS

YEAH.                           
BUT ISN'T THERE SOMETHING THAT  
THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THIS      

03:55:59.789 --> 03:56:00.320
BUT ISN'T THERE SOMETHING THAT  
THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THIS      
RIGHT HORIZONTALLY?             

03:56:00.322 --> 03:56:03.657
THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THIS      
RIGHT HORIZONTALLY?             
>> WE'RE NOT WE'VE EXPANDED AS

RIGHT HORIZONTALLY?             
>> WE'RE NOT WE'VE EXPANDED AS  
FAR AS WE CAN IS IS SO SO WE    

03:56:06.228 --> 03:56:10.231
>> WE'RE NOT WE'VE EXPANDED AS  
FAR AS WE CAN IS IS SO SO WE    
ARE OUR FRONTIERS HAVE REACHED  

03:56:10.233 --> 03:56:11.165
FAR AS WE CAN IS IS SO SO WE    
ARE OUR FRONTIERS HAVE REACHED  
THEIR EXTREMES NOW WE HAVE TO   

03:56:11.167 --> 03:56:11.965
ARE OUR FRONTIERS HAVE REACHED  
THEIR EXTREMES NOW WE HAVE TO   
FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO   

03:56:11.967 --> 03:56:14.601
THEIR EXTREMES NOW WE HAVE TO   
FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO   
USE THOSE THOSE LANDS.          

03:56:14.603 --> 03:56:15.001
FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO   
USE THOSE THOSE LANDS.          
RIGHT.                          

03:56:15.003 --> 03:56:16.136
USE THOSE THOSE LANDS.          
RIGHT.                          
SO I THINK YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT

BELLTOWER IS NOT THE RIGHT TERM 

03:56:18.875 --> 03:56:19.807
SO I THINK YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT    
BELLTOWER IS NOT THE RIGHT TERM 
BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A   

03:56:19.809 --> 03:56:22.276
BELLTOWER IS NOT THE RIGHT TERM 
BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A   
RECOGNITION OF THAT GEOGRAPHY   

03:56:22.278 --> 03:56:22.676
BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A   
RECOGNITION OF THAT GEOGRAPHY   
IS YEAH.                        

03:56:22.678 --> 03:56:23.411
RECOGNITION OF THAT GEOGRAPHY   
IS YEAH.                        
THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S         

03:56:23.413 --> 03:56:24.245
IS YEAH.                        
THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S         
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE HARD.  

03:56:24.247 --> 03:56:24.445
THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S         
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE HARD.  
YEAH.                           

03:56:24.447 --> 03:56:26.113
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE HARD.  
YEAH.                           
BECAUSE IT'S THE SECOND TIME    

03:56:26.115 --> 03:56:26.380

HORIZONTALLY AS WE CAN GO AND   
AND THAT'S A POINT WHERE MAKING 
BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE

>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.            
I THINK A MORE CAREFUL          
RESTATEMENT THIS IS I THINK     

03:56:53.809 --> 03:56:54.274
I THINK A MORE CAREFUL          
RESTATEMENT THIS IS I THINK     
APPROPRIATE HERE.               

03:56:54.276 --> 03:56:57.912
RESTATEMENT THIS IS I THINK     
APPROPRIATE HERE.               
>> OK, I JUST HAVE A FORMATTING 

03:56:57.914 --> 03:57:00.981

THING THAT I DON'T KNOW IF      

03:57:00.983 --> 03:57:01.915
>> OK, I JUST HAVE A FORMATTING 
THING THAT I DON'T KNOW IF      
WE'VE SAID THIS BUT THINGS LIKE 

03:57:01.917 --> 03:57:05.852
THING THAT I DON'T KNOW IF      
WE'VE SAID THIS BUT THINGS LIKE 
BULLETS OR SOMETHING MIGHT BE   

03:57:05.854 --> 03:57:08.255
WE'VE SAID THIS BUT THINGS LIKE 
BULLETS OR SOMETHING MIGHT BE   
HELPFUL IN THIS AND I KNOW      

03:57:08.257 --> 03:57:09.322
BULLETS OR SOMETHING MIGHT BE   
HELPFUL IN THIS AND I KNOW      
WHERE WE'VE REMOVED SOME OF THE 

03:57:09.324 --> 03:57:12.792
HELPFUL IN THIS AND I KNOW      
WHERE WE'VE REMOVED SOME OF THE 
CARTOONS MAYBE THERE'S ROOM BUT 

03:57:12.794 --> 03:57:16.363
WHERE WE'VE REMOVED SOME OF THE 
CARTOONS MAYBE THERE'S ROOM BUT 
SOME OF THIS IT I THINK LIKE IF 

03:57:16.365 --> 03:57:17.163
CARTOONS MAYBE THERE'S ROOM BUT 
SOME OF THIS IT I THINK LIKE IF 
SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE       

03:57:17.165 --> 03:57:17.898
SOME OF THIS IT I THINK LIKE IF 
SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE       
BROKEN OUT AS BULLET POINTS     

03:57:17.900 --> 03:57:20.434
SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE       
BROKEN OUT AS BULLET POINTS     
RATHER THAN JUST PARAGRAPHS, IT 

03:57:20.436 --> 03:57:21.435
BROKEN OUT AS BULLET POINTS     
RATHER THAN JUST PARAGRAPHS, IT 
MIGHT BE A LITTLE EASIER TO SEE 

03:57:21.437 --> 03:57:24.371
RATHER THAN JUST PARAGRAPHS, IT 
MIGHT BE A LITTLE EASIER TO SEE 
OR KIND OF FIND LIKE OVER HALF  

03:57:24.373 --> 03:57:27.875
MIGHT BE A LITTLE EASIER TO SEE 
OR KIND OF FIND LIKE OVER HALF  
OF OUR BUDGET COMES FROM        

03:57:27.877 --> 03:57:28.676
OR KIND OF FIND LIKE OVER HALF  
OF OUR BUDGET COMES FROM        
PROPERTY TAXES THAT COULD BE A  

03:57:28.678 --> 03:57:29.276
OF OUR BUDGET COMES FROM        
PROPERTY TAXES THAT COULD BE A  
LOT SMALLER SCALE RESIDENTIAL   

03:57:29.278 --> 03:57:31.945
PROPERTY TAXES THAT COULD BE A  
LOT SMALLER SCALE RESIDENTIAL   
PROPERTY IS LIKE THE PARAGRAPHS 

03:57:31.947 --> 03:57:35.516
LOT SMALLER SCALE RESIDENTIAL   
PROPERTY IS LIKE THE PARAGRAPHS 
ARE A LITTLE DENSE.             

03:57:35.518 --> 03:57:36.616
PROPERTY IS LIKE THE PARAGRAPHS 
ARE A LITTLE DENSE.             
SO THAT'S JUST IF THERE'S ROOM  

03:57:36.618 --> 03:57:38.819
ARE A LITTLE DENSE.             
SO THAT'S JUST IF THERE'S ROOM  
TO DO THAT.                     

03:57:38.821 --> 03:57:43.023
SO THAT'S JUST IF THERE'S ROOM

ACTUALLY LOWER COMPARED TO      
OTHER MUNICIPALITIES BUT THE

OF LOOKING AT OUR STORMWATER    
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.             

04:06:57.379 --> 04:06:59.913
OF LOOKING AT OUR STORMWATER    
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.             
WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF OUR     

04:06:59.915 --> 04:07:00.647
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.             
WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF OUR     
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS SO THERE   

04:07:00.649 --> 04:07:03.049
WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF OUR     
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS SO THERE   
IS A POSSIBILITY THAT OUT       

04:07:03.051 --> 04:07:03.683
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS SO THERE   
IS A POSSIBILITY THAT OUT       
OF THOSE THINGS OTHER           

04:07:03.685 --> 04:07:04.317
IS A POSSIBILITY THAT OUT       
OF THOSE THINGS OTHER           
RECOMMENDATIONS COULD COULD     

04:07:04.319 --> 04:07:04.717
OF THOSE THINGS OTHER           
RECOMMENDATIONS COULD COULD     
DEVELOP.                        

04:07:04.719 --> 04:07:08.088
RECOMMENDATIONS COULD COULD     
DEVELOP.                        
BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT  

04:07:08.090 --> 04:07:08.888
DEVELOP.                        
BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT  
THIS PLAN IN ATTEMPTING TO FIND 

04:07:08.890 --> 04:07:11.924
BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT  
THIS PLAN IN ATTEMPTING TO FIND 
THIS FOCUS, REALIZING THE FULL  

04:07:11.926 --> 04:07:15.595
THIS PLAN IN ATTEMPTING TO FIND 
THIS FOCUS, REALIZING THE FULL  
DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL OF THE    

04:07:15.597 --> 04:07:16.395
THIS FOCUS, REALIZING THE FULL  
DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL OF THE    
CITY EVEN THOUGH GEOGRAPHICALLY 

04:07:16.397 --> 04:07:19.765
DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL OF THE    
CITY EVEN THOUGH GEOGRAPHICALLY 
WE CAN'T DOING THAT WITH OUR    

04:07:19.767 --> 04:07:20.467
CITY EVEN THOUGH GEOGRAPHICALLY 
WE CAN'T DOING THAT WITH OUR    
CURRENT NATURAL FEATURES I      

04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:23.203
WE CAN'T DOING THAT WITH OUR    
CURRENT NATURAL FEATURES I      
THINK IS A REASONABLE APPROACH. 

04:07:23.205 --> 04:07:24.270
CURRENT NATURAL FEATURES I      
THINK IS A REASONABLE APPROACH. 
BUT I THINK THIS RESOLUTION     

04:07:24.272 --> 04:07:27.073
THINK IS A REASONABLE APPROACH. 
BUT I THINK THIS RESOLUTION     
COMES FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT   

04:07:27.075 --> 04:07:27.908
BUT I THINK THIS RESOLUTION     
COMES FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT   
THERE ARE PERHAPS GOALS THAT    

04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:28.508
COMES FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT   
THERE ARE PERHAPS GOALS THAT    
WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST     

04:07:28.510 --> 04:07:31.477
THERE ARE PERHAPS GOALS THAT    
WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST     
THAT WILL REMAIN UNREALIZED OR  

04:07:31.479 --> 04:07:32.278
WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST     
THAT WILL REMAIN UNREALIZED OR  
THAT WE SHOULD REALLY           

04:07:32.280 --> 04:07:36.015
THAT WILL REMAIN UNREALIZED OR  
THAT WE SHOULD REALLY           
SYSTEMATIC THEY TRY TO MARCH    

04:07:36.017 --> 04:07:36.816
THAT WE SHOULD REALLY           
SYSTEMATIC THEY TRY TO MARCH    
FORWARD ON SOME OF THOSE OR GO  

04:07:36.818 --> 04:07:39.619
SYSTEMATIC THEY TRY TO MARCH    
FORWARD ON SOME OF THOSE OR GO  
FURTHER OR FARTHER ON SOME      

04:07:39.621 --> 04:07:40.019
FORWARD ON SOME OF THOSE OR GO  
FURTHER OR FARTHER ON SOME      
OF THOSE.                       

04:07:40.021 --> 04:07:43.723
FURTHER OR FARTHER ON SOME      
OF THOSE.                       
AND SO I AGAIN DON'T WANT TO    

04:07:43.725 --> 04:07:44.357
OF THOSE.                       
AND SO I AGAIN DON'T WANT TO    
OVERSIMPLIFY THE CONVERSATION   

04:07:44.359 --> 04:07:45.292
AND SO I AGAIN DON'T WANT TO    
OVERSIMPLIFY THE CONVERSATION   
THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSIONER  

04:07:45.294 --> 04:07:46.460

04:07:46.462 --> 04:07:47.560

BUT JUST TO LEVEL SET THAT'S    
KIND OF A BIT OF A FRAMING      

04:07:47.562 --> 04:07:48.328
BUT JUST TO LEVEL SET THAT'S    
KIND OF A BIT OF A FRAMING      
OF WHERE WHERE IT IS AND I      

04:07:48.330 --> 04:07:50.797
KIND OF A BIT OF A FRAMING      
OF WHERE WHERE IT IS AND I      
THINK HOW THAT RESOLUTION IS

04:08:27.635 --> 04:08:29.903
           OF THE THING OF THE  
OF WHAT WE WOULD THINK OF IS    
REALLY TYPICAL ENVIRONMENTAL    

04:08:29.905 --> 04:08:30.636
OF WHAT WE WOULD THINK OF IS    
REALLY TYPICAL ENVIRONMENTAL    
PROTECTIONS LIKE THE STORMWATER 

04:08:30.638 --> 04:08:31.371
REALLY TYPICAL ENVIRONMENTAL    
PROTECTIONS LIKE THE STORMWATER 
OVERLAY LIKE I'M SURE NONE      

04:08:31.373 --> 04:08:31.972
PROTECTIONS LIKE THE STORMWATER 
OVERLAY LIKE I'M SURE NONE      
OF THE ALMAZ I BET LESS THAN    

04:08:31.974 --> 04:08:32.639
OVERLAY LIKE I'M SURE NONE      
OF THE ALMAZ I BET LESS THAN    
ONE PERCENT FEWER THAN ONE      

04:08:32.641 --> 04:08:33.373
OF THE ALMAZ I BET LESS THAN    
ONE PERCENT FEWER THAN ONE      
PERCENT OF OUR RESIDENTS NO

ONE PERCENT FEWER THAN ONE      
PERCENT OF OUR RESIDENTS NO     
THAT WE HAVE THAT IS PRETTY NEW 

04:08:34.176 --> 04:08:34.841
PERCENT OF OUR RESIDENTS NO     
THAT WE HAVE THAT IS PRETTY NEW 
AND THEY MAY NOT KNOW HOW       

04:08:34.843 --> 04:08:35.609
THAT WE HAVE THAT IS PRETTY NEW 
AND THEY MAY NOT KNOW HOW       
AMAZING IT IS AND THEY ARE      

04:08:35.611 --> 04:08:36.342
AND THEY MAY NOT KNOW HOW       
AMAZING IT IS AND THEY ARE      
WORRIED ABOUT FLOODING AND THEY 

04:08:36.344 --> 04:08:37.010
AMAZING IT IS AND THEY ARE      
WORRIED ABOUT FLOODING AND THEY 
SHOULD BE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING  

04:08:37.012 --> 04:08:37.810
WORRIED ABOUT FLOODING AND THEY 
SHOULD BE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING  
TO BE A BIG ASPECT OF CLIMATE   

04:08:37.812 --> 04:08:38.411
SHOULD BE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING  
TO BE A BIG ASPECT OF CLIMATE   
CHANGE IN ANN ARBOR.            

04:08:38.413 --> 04:08:39.145
TO BE A BIG ASPECT OF CLIMATE   
CHANGE IN ANN ARBOR.            
SO I WAS HOPING WE COULD HAVE A 

04:08:39.147 --> 04:08:39.879
CHANGE IN ANN ARBOR.            
SO I WAS HOPING WE COULD HAVE A 
CALLOUT BOX THAT SAYS WE HAVE   

04:08:39.881 --> 04:08:41.547
SO I WAS HOPING WE COULD HAVE A 
CALLOUT BOX THAT SAYS WE HAVE   
THAT AND THEN MAYBE SAY A FEW   

04:08:41.549 --> 04:08:42.282
CALLOUT BOX THAT SAYS WE HAVE

THINGS THAT'S IN OUR CURRENT    

04:08:42.284 --> 04:08:44.684
THAT AND THEN MAYBE SAY A FEW   
THINGS THAT'S IN OUR CURRENT

WORRIED ABOUT CHANGES IN THE    

04:25:55.983 --> 04:26:01.954
LIKE 30 PEOPLE ARE REALLY       
WORRIED ABOUT CHANGES IN THE    
SETBACKS                        

04:26:02.422 --> 04:26:09.594
         HOW DO WE HOW DO WE    
USE THIS AS A YOU KNOW, HOW DO  
WE REFER BACK TO THIS WHEN THAT 

04:26:09.596 --> 04:26:11.029
USE THIS AS A YOU KNOW, HOW DO  
WE REFER BACK TO THIS WHEN THAT 
IT'S IT'S NOT A I MEAN IT COULD 

04:26:11.031 --> 04:26:15.433
WE REFER BACK TO THIS WHEN THAT 
IT'S IT'S NOT A I MEAN IT COULD 
HAPPEN ON A SITE BUT IT COULD   

04:26:15.435 --> 04:26:18.203
IT'S IT'S NOT A I MEAN IT COULD 
HAPPEN ON A SITE BUT IT COULD   
HAPPEN ON SITES NOW AND SO LIKE 

04:26:18.205 --> 04:26:21.607
HAPPEN ON A SITE BUT IT COULD   
HAPPEN ON SITES NOW AND SO LIKE 
IF THAT'S SOMEBODY'S MAIN       

04:26:21.609 --> 04:26:26.211
HAPPEN ON SITES NOW AND SO LIKE 
IF THAT'S SOMEBODY'S MAIN       
CONCERN, HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

CONCERN, HOW DO WE HOW DO WE    
RESPOND TO THAT AND SAY WELL    
THERE'S SUSTAINABILITY IN THE   

04:26:29.984 --> 04:26:34.386
RESPOND TO THAT AND SAY WELL    
THERE'S SUSTAINABILITY IN THE   
PLAN BUT TO REFER THEM TO       

04:26:34.388 --> 04:26:37.890
THERE'S SUSTAINABILITY IN THE   
PLAN BUT TO REFER THEM TO       
THAT'S NOT GOING TO FEEL LIKE   

04:26:37.892 --> 04:26:41.760
PLAN BUT TO REFER THEM TO       
THAT'S NOT GOING TO FEEL LIKE   
ENOUGH?

I DON'T KNOW THAT THE PLANE CAN 
DO THAT RIGHT.                  
I MEAN THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL    

04:26:50.304 --> 04:26:53.505
DO THAT RIGHT.                  
I MEAN THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL    
FACT IF IF WE ARE MORE FLEXIBLE 

04:26:53.507 --> 04:26:57.142
I MEAN THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL    
FACT IF IF WE ARE MORE FLEXIBLE 
WITH SETBACKS YOU HAVE THE      

04:26:57.144 --> 04:26:57.876
FACT IF IF WE ARE MORE FLEXIBLE 
WITH SETBACKS YOU HAVE THE      
POTENTIAL TO LIKELY REALIZE     

04:26:57.878 --> 04:26:58.477
WITH SETBACKS YOU HAVE THE      
POTENTIAL TO LIKELY REALIZE     
MORE UNITS WHICH IS GOING TO    

04:26:58.479 --> 04:27:00.946
POTENTIAL TO LIKELY REALIZE     
MORE UNITS WHICH IS GOING TO    
CREATE MORE SUSTAINABILITY FROM

MORE UNITS WHICH IS GOING TO    
CREATE MORE SUSTAINABILITY FROM 
A TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVE,   

04:27:01.749 --> 04:27:04.916
CREATE MORE SUSTAINABILITY FROM 
A TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVE,   
FROM A PROXIMITY PERSPECTIVE,

PERSPECTIVE THAT IS GOING TO    
RESULT IN LESS SPACES ON A SITE 
FOR NATURAL RESOURCES TO BE     

04:27:13.527 --> 04:27:14.159
RESULT IN LESS SPACES ON A SITE 
FOR NATURAL RESOURCES TO BE     
RETAINED AND POTENTIALLY STILL

PARTICULAR TREE BUT OVERALL     
THAT'S STILL A KEY PART OF OUR  

04:27:47.260 --> 04:27:51.063
PARTICULAR TREE BUT OVERALL     
THAT'S STILL A KEY PART OF OUR  
WE STILL REGULATE LANDMARK      

04:27:51.065 --> 04:27:55.100
THAT'S STILL A KEY PART OF OUR  
WE STILL REGULATE LANDMARK      
TREES AND WOODLANDS AND BUT I   

04:27:55.102 --> 04:27:55.768
WE STILL REGULATE LANDMARK      
TREES AND WOODLANDS AND BUT I   
THINK BUT I THINK YOU'RE        

04:27:55.770 --> 04:27:59.371
TREES AND WOODLANDS AND BUT I   
THINK BUT I THINK YOU'RE        
HITTING ON A REAL AS YOU SAID   

04:27:59.373 --> 04:28:00.105
THINK BUT I THINK YOU'RE        
HITTING ON A REAL AS YOU SAID   
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING  

04:28:00.107 --> 04:28:00.739
HITTING ON A REAL AS YOU SAID   
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING  
A LOT OF THAT'S A LOT           

04:28:00.741 --> 04:28:01.173
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING  
A LOT OF THAT'S A LOT           
OF TENSION.                     

04:28:01.175 --> 04:28:03.275
A LOT OF THAT'S A LOT           
OF TENSION.                     
RIGHT, BECAUSE THERE ARE        

04:28:03.277 --> 04:28:10.415
OF TENSION.                     
RIGHT, BECAUSE THERE ARE        
TRADEOFFS TO AMATEUR MY         

04:28:10.417 --> 04:28:11.249
RIGHT, BECAUSE THERE ARE        
TRADEOFFS TO AMATEUR MY         
PLANNING BOOK IS GOING TO BE    

04:28:11.251 --> 04:28:14.119
TRADEOFFS TO AMATEUR MY         
PLANNING BOOK IS GOING TO BE    
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL.          

04:28:14.121 --> 04:28:14.720
PLANNING BOOK IS GOING TO BE    
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL.          
IT'S REALLY HARD.               

04:28:14.722 --> 04:28:15.721
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL.          
IT'S REALLY HARD.               
IS IT REALLY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH 

04:28:15.723 --> 04:28:18.523
IT'S REALLY HARD.               
IS IT REALLY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH 
EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ON ONE    

04:28:18.525 --> 04:28:18.857
IS IT REALLY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH 
EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ON ONE    
SIDE?                           

04:28:18.859 --> 04:28:22.127
EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ON ONE    
SIDE?                           
AND SO I THINK THAT RESIDENTS   

04:28:22.129 --> 04:28:25.230
SIDE?                           
AND SO I THINK THAT RESIDENTS   
APPRECIATE HONESTY ABOUT THERE  

04:28:25.232 --> 04:28:25.764
AND SO I THINK THAT RESIDENTS   
APPRECIATE HONESTY ABOUT THERE  
ARE TRADEOFFS.                  

04:28:25.766 --> 04:28:26.798
APPRECIATE HONESTY ABOUT THERE  
ARE TRADEOFFS.                  
AND SO ONE OF THE EDITS THAT I  

04:28:26.800 --> 04:28:29.868
ARE TRADEOFFS.                  
AND SO ONE OF THE EDITS THAT I  
GAVE WAS LET'S GIVE THEM A REAL 

04:28:29.870 --> 04:28:33.037
AND SO ONE OF THE EDITS THAT I  
GAVE WAS LET'S GIVE THEM A REAL 
BOX ABOUT YEAH, WE GOT COLORIZE 

04:28:33.039 --> 04:28:33.271
GAVE WAS LET'S GIVE THEM A REAL 
BOX ABOUT YEAH, WE GOT COLORIZE 
.                               

04:28:33.273 --> 04:28:34.105
BOX ABOUT YEAH, WE GOT COLORIZE 
.                               
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME TRADE  

04:28:34.107 --> 04:28:34.806
.                               
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME TRADE  
OFFS BUT THEY AREN'T ALL GOING  

04:28:34.808 --> 04:28:35.274
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME TRADE  
OFFS BUT THEY AREN'T ALL GOING  
TO BE ZERO SUM.                 

04:28:35.276 --> 04:28:37.842
OFFS BUT THEY AREN'T ALL GOING  
TO BE ZERO SUM.                 
I THINK THIS ONE IS A GOOD ONE  

04:28:37.844 --> 04:28:40.946
TO BE ZERO SUM.                 
I THINK THIS ONE IS A GOOD ONE  
THAT THE DENSITY GREATER        

04:28:40.948 --> 04:28:41.880
I THINK THIS ONE IS A GOOD ONE  
THAT THE DENSITY GREATER        
DENSITY VERSUS SOME LOSS IN     

04:28:41.882 --> 04:28:44.883
THAT THE DENSITY GREATER        
DENSITY VERSUS SOME LOSS IN     
SOME PLACES OF NATURAL FEATURES 

04:28:44.885 --> 04:28:46.084
DENSITY VERSUS SOME LOSS IN     
SOME PLACES OF NATURAL FEATURES 
AND YET WE STILL REGULATE THESE 

04:28:46.086 --> 04:28:49.721
SOME PLACES OF NATURAL FEATURES 
AND YET WE STILL REGULATE THESE 
THINGS THAT KIND OF A CALLOUT   

04:28:49.723 --> 04:28:56.495
AND YET WE STILL REGULATE THESE 
THINGS THAT KIND OF A CALLOUT   
BOX COULD BE HELPFUL LIKE WHERE 

04:29:10.376 --> 04:29:11.977
RESIDENT FEEDBACK HAS           
IDENTIFIED ATTENTION THAT IS    
JUST THERE.                     

04:29:11.979 --> 04:29:12.710
IDENTIFIED ATTENTION THAT IS    
JUST THERE.                     
LET'S JUST TELL THEM YEAH, WE

JUST THERE.                     
LET'S JUST TELL THEM YEAH, WE   
GET IT RIGHT.

04:29:17.385 --> 04:29:18.183
WELL THE SUGGESTION IS THAT     
CALL CALLER ABOUT SOMEWHERE     
WHETHER IT'S EIGHTY-SIX WHICH   

04:29:18.185 --> 04:29:18.917
CALL CALLER ABOUT SOMEWHERE     
WHETHER IT'S EIGHTY-SIX WHICH   
BUILDS ON THAT BUT TO FRAME IT  

04:29:18.919 --> 04:29:19.618
WHETHER IT'S EIGHTY-SIX WHICH   
BUILDS ON THAT BUT TO FRAME IT  
AS YOU KNOW GROWTH WILL MEAN    

04:29:19.620 --> 04:29:20.486
BUILDS ON THAT BUT TO FRAME IT  
AS YOU KNOW GROWTH WILL MEAN    
SOME TRADE OFFS WITH RESPECT TO 

04:29:20.488 --> 04:29:23.288
AS YOU KNOW GROWTH WILL MEAN    
SOME TRADE OFFS WITH RESPECT TO 
NATURAL FEATURES BUT            

04:29:23.290 --> 04:29:24.155
SOME TRADE OFFS WITH RESPECT TO 
NATURAL FEATURES BUT            
NONETHELESS THE CITY HAS THE    

04:29:24.157 --> 04:29:27.559
NATURAL FEATURES BUT            
NONETHELESS THE CITY HAS THE    
FOLLOWING PROTECTIONS.          

04:29:27.561 --> 04:29:31.530
NONETHELESS THE CITY HAS THE    
FOLLOWING PROTECTIONS.          
>> I KNOW WELL I MEAN BUT IT'S  

04:29:31.532 --> 04:29:32.131
FOLLOWING PROTECTIONS.          
>> I KNOW WELL I MEAN BUT IT'S  
TRUE THOUGH, RIGHT?             

04:29:32.133 --> 04:29:35.801
>> I KNOW WELL I MEAN BUT IT'S  
TRUE THOUGH, RIGHT?             
AND RATHER THAN LEAVING A       

04:29:35.803 --> 04:29:39.204
TRUE THOUGH, RIGHT?             
AND RATHER THAN LEAVING A       
VACUUM WHERE WE DON'T TALK      

04:29:39.206 --> 04:29:40.138
AND RATHER THAN LEAVING A       
VACUUM WHERE WE DON'T TALK      
ABOUT THE TENSION, THEN WE      

04:29:40.140 --> 04:29:40.839
VACUUM WHERE WE DON'T TALK      
ABOUT THE TENSION, THEN WE      
LEAVE A VACUUM AND WE GET       

04:29:40.841 --> 04:29:43.575
ABOUT THE TENSION, THEN WE      
LEAVE A VACUUM AND WE GET       
REALLY BIG STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW 

04:29:43.577 --> 04:29:44.375
LEAVE A VACUUM AND WE GET       
REALLY BIG STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW 
THERE WON'T BE ANY TREES LEFT   

04:29:44.377 --> 04:29:47.779
REALLY BIG STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW 
THERE WON'T BE ANY TREES LEFT   
AND THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE GIVEN    

04:29:47.781 --> 04:29:48.447
THERE WON'T BE ANY TREES LEFT   
AND THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE GIVEN    
OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.       

04:29:48.449 --> 04:29:51.150
AND THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE GIVEN    
OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.       
YEAH, SO THAT'S KIND OF I WOULD 

04:29:51.152 --> 04:29:54.652
OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.       
YEAH, SO THAT'S KIND OF I WOULD 
LIKE TO RESPECT THE             

04:29:54.654 --> 04:29:55.353
YEAH, SO THAT'S KIND OF I WOULD

GOALS BECAUSE PART OF OUR GOAL  
IS TO PROVIDE A LOT             
OF DIFFERENT HOUSING TYPOLOGY   

04:40:24.784 --> 04:40:25.716
IS TO PROVIDE A LOT             
OF DIFFERENT HOUSING TYPOLOGY   
AND TO MAXIMUM EVEN EVEN IF     

04:40:25.718 --> 04:40:29.120
OF DIFFERENT HOUSING TYPOLOGY   
AND TO MAXIMUM EVEN EVEN IF     
WHAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THAT    

04:40:29.122 --> 04:40:29.587
AND TO MAXIMUM EVEN EVEN IF     
WHAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THAT    
NUMBERS ARE.

04:40:30.590 --> 04:40:33.525
NUMBERS ARE.                    
I THINK PART OF THE PART OF THE 
APPROACH OF THIS PLAN IS WE'VE

THINK A BIG PART OF THIS IS WE  
WANT TO BROADEN THAT PORTFOLIO

WANT TO BROADEN THAT PORTFOLIO

I MEAN WITH GOOD DESIGN AND     
SOME THOUGHTFULNESS WE CAN      
INCREASE THE DIVERSITY          

04:45:21.047 --> 04:45:24.314
SOME THOUGHTFULNESS WE CAN      
INCREASE THE DIVERSITY          
OF HOUSING TYPES IN ALL OF THE  

04:45:24.316 --> 04:45:24.982
INCREASE THE DIVERSITY          
OF HOUSING TYPES IN ALL OF THE  
NEIGHBORHOODS SO THEY'RE MORE   

04:45:24.984 --> 04:45:27.618

NEIGHBORHOODS SO THEY'RE MORE   
INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE.          

04:45:27.620 --> 04:45:28.686
NEIGHBORHOODS SO THEY'RE MORE

THINGS LIKE THAT.               
AND I KNOW WE'RE ANTICIPATING

THE PLAN.                       
TALK ABOUT IT NOW PAST THE PLAN 
AND MY RESPONSE TO THAT I THINK 

04:45:51.477 --> 04:45:52.377
TALK ABOUT IT NOW PAST THE PLAN 
AND MY RESPONSE TO THAT I THINK 
IS YOU KNOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY    

04:45:52.379 --> 04:45:54.311
AND MY RESPONSE TO THAT I THINK 
IS YOU KNOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY    
SOMETHING THAT'S BETTER DONE    

04:45:54.313 --> 04:45:55.345
IS YOU KNOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY    
SOMETHING THAT'S BETTER DONE    
THROUGH THE UDC REVISIONS WHERE 

04:45:55.347 --> 04:45:59.083
SOMETHING THAT'S BETTER DONE    
THROUGH THE UDC REVISIONS WHERE 
THE SPECIFICITY IS IS MORE      

04:45:59.085 --> 04:46:02.786
THROUGH THE UDC REVISIONS WHERE 
THE SPECIFICITY IS IS MORE      
APPROPRIATE TO THINK ABOUT.     

04:46:02.788 --> 04:46:03.554
THE SPECIFICITY IS IS MORE      
APPROPRIATE TO THINK ABOUT.     
BUT THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO   

04:46:03.556 --> 04:46:04.354
APPROPRIATE TO THINK ABOUT.     
BUT THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO   
HAVE TO COMMIT I'M COMMITTING   

04:46:04.356 --> 04:46:07.057
BUT THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO   
HAVE TO COMMIT I'M COMMITTING

REALLY ARE THOUGHTFULLY         
THINKING THROUGH HOW ARE WE     
GOING TO TAKE THIS POLICY GOAL  

04:46:15.902 --> 04:46:18.302
THINKING THROUGH HOW ARE WE     
GOING TO TAKE THIS POLICY GOAL  
ARTICULATED IN THE PLAN AND     

04:46:18.304 --> 04:46:19.036
GOING TO TAKE THIS POLICY GOAL  
ARTICULATED IN THE PLAN AND     
MAKE IT WORKABLE THROUGH THE    

04:46:19.038 --> 04:46:21.906
ARTICULATED IN THE PLAN AND     
MAKE IT WORKABLE THROUGH THE    
ZONING ORDINANCE.               

04:46:21.908 --> 04:46:23.140
MAKE IT WORKABLE THROUGH THE    
ZONING ORDINANCE.               
SO CAN WE LET'S JUST SO WE'RE   

04:46:23.142 --> 04:46:26.477
ZONING ORDINANCE.               
SO CAN WE LET'S JUST SO WE'RE   
WE I THINK WE ARE THERE'S A     

04:46:26.479 --> 04:46:27.278
SO CAN WE LET'S JUST SO WE'RE   
WE I THINK WE ARE THERE'S A     
CONSENSUS EMERGING THAT THIS    

04:46:27.280 --> 04:46:30.014
WE I THINK WE ARE THERE'S A     
CONSENSUS EMERGING THAT THIS    
REQUEST YOUR REQUEST GOES OUT   

04:46:30.016 --> 04:46:30.948
CONSENSUS EMERGING THAT THIS    
REQUEST YOUR REQUEST GOES OUT   
BUT THERE IS A DESIRE FOR A     

04:46:30.950 --> 04:46:33.951
REQUEST YOUR REQUEST GOES OUT   
BUT THERE IS A DESIRE FOR A     
FORCEFUL STATEMENT OF WHY WE'RE 

04:46:33.953 --> 04:46:34.852
BUT THERE IS A DESIRE FOR A     
FORCEFUL STATEMENT OF WHY WE'RE 
DOING A CITYWIDE AND THERE IS A 

04:46:34.854 --> 04:46:37.888
FORCEFUL STATEMENT OF WHY WE'RE 
DOING A CITYWIDE AND THERE IS A 
NICE SUPPORTING GRAPH.          

04:46:37.890 --> 04:46:38.856
DOING A CITYWIDE AND THERE IS A 
NICE SUPPORTING GRAPH.          
I THINK BRIAN CHAMBERS POINTED  

04:46:38.858 --> 04:46:41.392
NICE SUPPORTING GRAPH.          
I THINK BRIAN CHAMBERS POINTED  
THIS OUT TO US IN THE APPENDIX  

04:46:41.394 --> 04:46:42.593
I THINK BRIAN CHAMBERS POINTED  
THIS OUT TO US IN THE APPENDIX  
THAT YOU MADE, WHICH IS THE     

04:46:42.595 --> 04:46:43.260
THIS OUT TO US IN THE APPENDIX  
THAT YOU MADE, WHICH IS THE     
KIND OF THINGS THAT AREN'T      

04:46:43.262 --> 04:46:45.463
THAT YOU MADE, WHICH IS THE     
KIND OF THINGS THAT AREN'T      
GETTING BUILT ANYMORE AND IT'S  

04:46:45.465 --> 04:46:46.363
KIND OF THINGS THAT AREN'T      
GETTING BUILT ANYMORE AND IT'S  
TWO TO FOUR UNIT THINGS AND     

04:46:46.365 --> 04:46:47.030
GETTING BUILT ANYMORE AND IT'S  
TWO TO FOUR UNIT THINGS AND     
THAT'S A GREAT ILLUSTRATION     

04:46:47.032 --> 04:46:49.967
TWO TO FOUR UNIT THINGS AND     
THAT'S A GREAT ILLUSTRATION     
OF A LOSS OF HOUSING DIVERSITY  

04:46:49.969 --> 04:46:53.371
THAT'S A GREAT ILLUSTRATION     
OF A LOSS OF HOUSING DIVERSITY  
AND IT'S A GOOD ILLUSTRATION    

04:46:53.373 --> 04:46:54.038
OF A LOSS OF HOUSING DIVERSITY  
AND IT'S A GOOD ILLUSTRATION    
OF A LOSS OF HOUSING DIVERSITY  

04:46:54.040 --> 04:46:54.771
AND IT'S A GOOD ILLUSTRATION    
OF A LOSS OF HOUSING DIVERSITY  
THAT CREATES AN AFFORDABILITY   

04:46:54.773 --> 04:46:56.773
OF A LOSS OF HOUSING DIVERSITY  
THAT CREATES AN AFFORDABILITY   
ISSUE.                          

04:46:56.775 --> 04:46:57.675
THAT CREATES AN AFFORDABILITY   
ISSUE.                          
SO I THOUGHT THAT COULD BE      

04:46:57.677 --> 04:47:00.477
ISSUE.                          
SO I THOUGHT THAT COULD BE      
PULLED INTO THE TEXT AT SOME    

04:47:00.479 --> 04:47:01.546
SO I THOUGHT THAT COULD BE      
PULLED INTO THE TEXT AT SOME    
POINT THE BODY OF THE PLAN TO   

04:47:01.548 --> 04:47:02.413
PULLED INTO THE TEXT AT SOME    
POINT THE BODY OF THE PLAN TO   
MAKE THIS ARGUMENT THAT WE WANT 

04:47:02.415 --> 04:47:05.315
POINT THE BODY OF THE PLAN TO   
MAKE THIS ARGUMENT THAT WE WANT 
TO MAKE DIRECTLY AND FORCEFULLY 

04:47:05.317 --> 04:47:08.586
MAKE THIS ARGUMENT THAT WE WANT 
TO MAKE DIRECTLY AND FORCEFULLY 
THAT WE WANT DIVERSE HOUSING    

04:47:08.588 --> 04:47:12.523
TO MAKE DIRECTLY AND FORCEFULLY 
THAT WE WANT DIVERSE HOUSING    
AND THAT IS A FACTOR IN         

04:47:12.525 --> 04:47:13.191
THAT WE WANT DIVERSE HOUSING    
AND THAT IS A FACTOR IN         
AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY 

04:47:13.193 --> 04:47:13.924
AND THAT IS A FACTOR IN         
AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE SAME    

04:47:13.926 --> 04:47:14.258

INTERPRETING IT.

IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCREASE

IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCREASE      
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES BROADLY   

04:47:32.745 --> 04:47:35.079
IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCREASE      
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES BROADLY   
ACROSS THE CITY FOR A VARIETY   

04:47:35.081 --> 04:47:35.879
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES BROADLY   
ACROSS THE CITY FOR A VARIETY   
VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES, DESIRES

ACROSS THE CITY FOR A VARIETY   
VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES, DESIRES

AND ULTIMATELY CHOICES BY       
PEOPLE.                         
YEAH, AND I THINK IF FOR ME     

04:47:43.155 --> 04:47:47.024
PEOPLE.                         
YEAH, AND I THINK IF FOR ME     
IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE  

04:47:47.026 --> 04:47:47.825
YEAH, AND I THINK IF FOR ME     
IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE  
DO NOT ACCEPT CERTAIN PREMISES, 

04:47:47.827 --> 04:47:51.395
IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE  
DO NOT ACCEPT CERTAIN PREMISES, 
I THINK WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT   

04:47:51.397 --> 04:47:54.398
DO NOT ACCEPT CERTAIN PREMISES, 
I THINK WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT   
THIS POSITIVELY AND NOT WITH A  

04:47:54.400 --> 04:47:58.569
I THINK WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT   
THIS POSITIVELY AND NOT WITH A  
NEGATIVE FRAME AND ACCEPTING    

04:47:58.571 --> 04:47:59.369
THIS POSITIVELY AND NOT WITH A  
NEGATIVE FRAME AND ACCEPTING    
NEGATIVE FRAME BECAUSE WE       

04:47:59.371 --> 04:48:02.373
NEGATIVE FRAME AND ACCEPTING    
NEGATIVE FRAME BECAUSE WE       
CANNOT PROPERLY DEFEND OUR      

04:48:02.375 --> 04:48:06.444
NEGATIVE FRAME BECAUSE WE       
CANNOT PROPERLY DEFEND OUR      
ACTION AGAINST SOMEONE READING  

04:48:06.446 --> 04:48:07.044
CANNOT PROPERLY DEFEND OUR      
ACTION AGAINST SOMEONE READING  
WHAT WE'RE DOING AS NEGATIVE.   

04:48:07.046 --> 04:48:10.581
ACTION AGAINST SOMEONE READING  
WHAT WE'RE DOING AS NEGATIVE.   
SO WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENT    

04:48:10.583 --> 04:48:11.048
WHAT WE'RE DOING AS NEGATIVE.   
SO WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENT    
DECISION.                       

04:48:11.050 --> 04:48:14.418
SO WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENT    
DECISION.                       
WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO OPEN    

04:48:14.420 --> 04:48:15.019
DECISION.                       
WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO OPEN    
THE NEIGHBORHOODS TO MORE       

04:48:15.021 --> 04:48:17.955
WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO OPEN    
THE NEIGHBORHOODS TO MORE       
PEOPLE.                         

04:48:17.957 --> 04:48:18.956
THE NEIGHBORHOODS TO MORE       
PEOPLE.                         
WE WANT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN     

04:48:18.958 --> 04:48:21.558
PEOPLE.                         
WE WANT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN     
HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED TO HAVE   

04:48:21.560 --> 04:48:24.729
WE WANT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN     
HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED TO HAVE   
AN OPPORTUNITY WE CAN'T CONTROL 

04:48:24.731 --> 04:48:25.662
HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED TO HAVE   
AN OPPORTUNITY WE CAN'T CONTROL 
THAT BECAUSE THE CITY DOESN'T   

04:48:25.664 --> 04:48:29.299
AN OPPORTUNITY WE CAN'T CONTROL 
THAT BECAUSE THE CITY DOESN'T   
BUILD ENOUGH CITY BUILT HOUSING 

04:48:29.301 --> 04:48:29.667
THAT BECAUSE THE CITY DOESN'T   
BUILD ENOUGH CITY BUILT HOUSING 
TO INSURE IT.                   

04:48:29.669 --> 04:48:33.037
BUILD ENOUGH CITY BUILT HOUSING 
TO INSURE IT.                   
BUT WE CAN ENABLE THE           

04:48:33.039 --> 04:48:36.840
TO INSURE IT.                   
BUT WE CAN ENABLE THE           
POSSIBILITY FOR IT TO EXIST AND 

04:48:36.842 --> 04:48:37.842
BUT WE CAN ENABLE THE           
POSSIBILITY FOR IT TO EXIST AND 
WE DO NOT ACCEPT THE PREMISE    

04:48:37.844 --> 04:48:40.578
POSSIBILITY FOR IT TO EXIST AND 
WE DO NOT ACCEPT THE PREMISE    
THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS        

04:48:40.580 --> 04:48:41.244
WE DO NOT ACCEPT THE PREMISE    
THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS        
DESTROYING SOMETHING.           

04:48:41.246 --> 04:48:44.682
THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS        
DESTROYING SOMETHING.           
SO FOR ME I THINK IT'S ABOUT    

04:48:44.684 --> 04:48:45.416
DESTROYING SOMETHING.           
SO FOR ME I THINK IT'S ABOUT    
HOW WE ARTICULATE IT.           

04:48:45.418 --> 04:48:46.284
SO FOR ME I THINK IT'S ABOUT    
HOW WE ARTICULATE IT.           
IT'S ABOUT MORE NEIGHBORS       

04:48:46.286 --> 04:48:49.753
HOW WE ARTICULATE IT.           
IT'S ABOUT MORE NEIGHBORS       
SHARING ACCESS TO WHAT WE ALL   

04:48:49.755 --> 04:48:52.123
IT'S ABOUT MORE NEIGHBORS

BECAUSE IF WE IF WE MAINTAIN    
OUR STANDARDS WE HAVE NOW BUT

INSTEAD OF DOWN ZONING IT INTO  
RESIDENTIAL.                    
NOW THAT RESIDENTIAL HAS A

THERE IS PONTIAC TRAIL IS TOO   
NARROW TO ACTUALLY HAVE DECENT  

05:33:08.645 --> 05:33:12.013
THERE IS PONTIAC TRAIL IS TOO   
NARROW TO ACTUALLY HAVE DECENT  
BIKE LANES ON IT AND SO SOME    

05:33:12.015 --> 05:33:12.847
NARROW TO ACTUALLY HAVE DECENT  
BIKE LANES ON IT AND SO SOME    
OF THE CRITERIA THAT WE'RE      

05:33:12.849 --> 05:33:15.550
BIKE LANES ON IT AND SO SOME    
OF THE CRITERIA THAT WE'RE      
LOOKING AT FOR TRANSITION ZONES 

05:33:15.552 --> 05:33:16.518
OF THE CRITERIA THAT WE'RE      
LOOKING AT FOR TRANSITION ZONES 
IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE WALKABLE 

05:33:16.520 --> 05:33:17.118
LOOKING AT FOR TRANSITION ZONES 
IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE WALKABLE 
AND PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY.        

05:33:17.120 --> 05:33:19.820
IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE WALKABLE 
AND PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY.        
ALL THAT DOES IS THROW MORE     

05:33:19.822 --> 05:33:20.488
AND PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY.        
ALL THAT DOES IS THROW MORE     
RESIDENTS ONTO SOMETHING THAT   

05:33:20.490 --> 05:33:24.459
ALL THAT DOES IS THROW MORE     
RESIDENTS ONTO SOMETHING THAT   
YOU KNOW, I HEAR ABOUT WHERE    

05:33:24.461 --> 05:33:25.126
RESIDENTS ONTO SOMETHING THAT   
YOU KNOW, I HEAR ABOUT WHERE    
SOME KIDS ARE GOING TO GET RUN  

05:33:25.128 --> 05:33:28.029
YOU KNOW, I HEAR ABOUT WHERE    
SOME KIDS ARE GOING TO GET RUN  
OVER BECAUSE THE SIDEWALK IS    

05:33:28.031 --> 05:33:28.730
SOME KIDS ARE GOING TO GET RUN  
OVER BECAUSE THE SIDEWALK IS    
TOO CLOSE TO THE STREET WHERE   

05:33:28.732 --> 05:33:32.067
OVER BECAUSE THE SIDEWALK IS    
TOO CLOSE TO THE STREET WHERE   
PEOPLE DRIVE 55 MILES AN HOUR

JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT      
THOSE AREN'T ALWAYS MEETING THE

I UNDERSTAND AND THAT'S THAT'S  

05:41:41.523 --> 05:41:43.957
WHERE WE NEED TO HEAR FROM      
DEVELOPERS THROUGH YOU TO SAY   
HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW AND WE
