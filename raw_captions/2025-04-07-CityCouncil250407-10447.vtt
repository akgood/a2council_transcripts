NEXT THURSDAY MAY DRIVE YOUR    
DECISION ON OUR BOUNDARY AND    
OUR TIF CAPTURE.                

00:08:58.166 --> 00:08:59.131
DECISION ON OUR BOUNDARY AND    
OUR TIF CAPTURE.                
SO WE'LL START WITH BOUNDRY.    

00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:02.402
OUR TIF CAPTURE.                
SO WE'LL START WITH BOUNDRY.    
I KNOW I'VE SHARED A SLIDE      

00:09:02.404 --> 00:09:03.369
SO WE'LL START WITH BOUNDRY.    
I KNOW I'VE SHARED A SLIDE      
PREVIOUSLY BUT I THOUGHT IT IS  

00:09:03.371 --> 00:09:05.805
I KNOW I'VE SHARED A SLIDE      
PREVIOUSLY BUT I THOUGHT IT IS  
WORTH REPEATING ON THE LEFT     

00:09:05.807 --> 00:09:06.539
PREVIOUSLY BUT I THOUGHT IT IS  
WORTH REPEATING ON THE LEFT     
THAT IS THE DA'S BOUNDARY.      

00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:09.575
WORTH REPEATING ON THE LEFT     
THAT IS THE DA'S BOUNDARY.      
IT IS SIXTY SEVEN BLOCKS OF OUR 

00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:09.975
THAT IS THE DA'S BOUNDARY.      
IT IS SIXTY SEVEN BLOCKS OF OUR 
DOWNTOWN.                       

00:09:09.977 --> 00:09:10.777
IT IS SIXTY SEVEN BLOCKS OF OUR 
DOWNTOWN.                       
IT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER FORTY   

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:13.479
DOWNTOWN.                       
IT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER FORTY   
THREE YEARS AGO.                

00:09:13.481 --> 00:09:14.414
IT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER FORTY   
THREE YEARS AGO.                
IT HAS NEVER CHANGED HERE IN    

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:14.881
THREE YEARS AGO.                
IT HAS NEVER CHANGED HERE IN    
ANN ARBOR.                      

00:09:14.883 --> 00:09:17.183
IT HAS NEVER CHANGED HERE IN    
ANN ARBOR.                      
IT IS JUST NOT COMMON FOR US TO 

00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:18.084
ANN ARBOR.                      
IT IS JUST NOT COMMON FOR US TO 
TALK ABOUT OUR DEVAH EXPANDING  

00:09:18.086 --> 00:09:21.821
IT IS JUST NOT COMMON FOR US TO 
TALK ABOUT OUR DEVAH EXPANDING  
IT IS MORE COMMON IN OTHER      

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:22.522
TALK ABOUT OUR DEVAH EXPANDING  
IT IS MORE COMMON IN OTHER      
COMMUNITIES AND WE CAN LOOK TO  

00:09:22.524 --> 00:09:25.191
IT IS MORE COMMON IN OTHER      
COMMUNITIES AND WE CAN LOOK TO  
GRAND RAPIDS AS A GREAT EXAMPLE 

00:09:25.193 --> 00:09:26.292
COMMUNITIES AND WE CAN LOOK TO  
GRAND RAPIDS AS A GREAT EXAMPLE 
OF A DIVA THAT HAS EXPANDED 16  

00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:29.462
GRAND RAPIDS AS A GREAT EXAMPLE 
OF A DIVA THAT HAS EXPANDED 16  
TIMES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY.    

00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:30.497
OF A DIVA THAT HAS EXPANDED 16  
TIMES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY.    
>> BASICALLY THEY'RE RESPONDING 

00:09:30.499 --> 00:09:33.466
TIMES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY.    
>> BASICALLY THEY'RE RESPONDING 
TO AN EVOLVING DOWNTOWN.        

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:37.237
>> BASICALLY THEY'RE RESPONDING 
TO AN EVOLVING DOWNTOWN.        
SO WHAT WOULD AN OUTCOME BE FOR 

00:09:37.239 --> 00:09:38.204
TO AN EVOLVING DOWNTOWN.        
SO WHAT WOULD AN OUTCOME BE FOR 
THE ANN ARBOR DEDE'S BOUNDARY   

00:09:38.206 --> 00:09:38.605
SO WHAT WOULD AN OUTCOME BE FOR 
THE ANN ARBOR DEDE'S BOUNDARY   
TO EXPAND?                      

00:09:38.607 --> 00:09:40.773
THE ANN ARBOR DEDE'S BOUNDARY   
TO EXPAND?                      
BASICALLY IT SPANS THE AREA     

00:09:40.775 --> 00:09:41.607
TO EXPAND?                      
BASICALLY IT SPANS THE AREA     
WHERE WE CAN WORK AND IT GIVES  

00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:44.644
BASICALLY IT SPANS THE AREA     
WHERE WE CAN WORK AND IT GIVES  
US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND   

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:45.712
WHERE WE CAN WORK AND IT GIVES  
US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND   
TO A DOWNTOWN THAT WE KNOW IS   

00:09:45.714 --> 00:09:48.314
US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND   
TO A DOWNTOWN THAT WE KNOW IS   
EVOLVING.                       

00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:52.585
TO A DOWNTOWN THAT WE KNOW IS   
EVOLVING.                       
>> SO WE BEGAN THE LOOKING AT   

00:09:52.587 --> 00:09:53.620
EVOLVING.                       
>> SO WE BEGAN THE LOOKING AT   
OUR BOUNDARY WITH A BROAD LENS  

00:09:53.622 --> 00:09:56.956
>> SO WE BEGAN THE LOOKING AT   
OUR BOUNDARY WITH A BROAD LENS  
KEEPING IN MIND THAT OUR        

00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.427
OUR BOUNDARY WITH A BROAD LENS  
KEEPING IN MIND THAT OUR        
BOUNDARY HAS TO BE CONTIGUOUS.  

00:10:00.429 --> 00:10:01.494
KEEPING IN MIND THAT OUR        
BOUNDARY HAS TO BE CONTIGUOUS.  
SO WE BEGAN BY LOOKING AT       

00:10:01.496 --> 00:10:03.730
BOUNDARY HAS TO BE CONTIGUOUS.  
SO WE BEGAN BY LOOKING AT       
DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ALREADY     

00:10:03.732 --> 00:10:04.597
SO WE BEGAN BY LOOKING AT       
DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ALREADY     
HAPPENING JUST ADJACENT TO OUR  

00:10:04.599 --> 00:10:07.600
DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ALREADY     
HAPPENING JUST ADJACENT TO OUR  
CURRENT BORDERS AND THAT BRINGS 

00:10:07.602 --> 00:10:08.334
HAPPENING JUST ADJACENT TO OUR  
CURRENT BORDERS AND THAT BRINGS 
ADDITIONAL AMENITY NEEDS.       

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:12.938
CURRENT BORDERS AND THAT BRINGS 
ADDITIONAL AMENITY NEEDS.       
WE LOOKED AT POTENTIAL PROJECTS 

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.639
ADDITIONAL AMENITY NEEDS.       
WE LOOKED AT POTENTIAL PROJECTS 
THAT EXPAND BEYOND OUR CURRENT  

00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:15.641
WE LOOKED AT POTENTIAL PROJECTS 
THAT EXPAND BEYOND OUR CURRENT  
BOUNDARIES.                     

00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:16.509
THAT EXPAND BEYOND OUR CURRENT  
BOUNDARIES.                     
WE LOOKED AT UNDERGROUND        

00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:17.243
BOUNDARIES.                     
WE LOOKED AT UNDERGROUND        
UTILITY NEEDS AND WE LOOKED AT  

00:10:17.245 --> 00:10:19.779
WE LOOKED AT UNDERGROUND        
UTILITY NEEDS AND WE LOOKED AT  
FUTURE LAND USE.                

00:10:19.781 --> 00:10:23.550
UTILITY NEEDS AND WE LOOKED AT  
FUTURE LAND USE.                
SO FROM THERE WE REFINED THAT   

00:10:23.552 --> 00:10:24.750
FUTURE LAND USE.                
SO FROM THERE WE REFINED THAT   
AREA TO WHAT YOU SEE ON THE     

00:10:24.752 --> 00:10:27.553
SO FROM THERE WE REFINED THAT   
AREA TO WHAT YOU SEE ON THE     
SCREEN.                         

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:28.521
AREA TO WHAT YOU SEE ON THE     
SCREEN.                         
WE'VE GOT TWO AREAS TO THE      

00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:31.991
SCREEN.                         
WE'VE GOT TWO AREAS TO THE      
NORTH AND THREE AREAS TO THE    

00:10:31.993 --> 00:10:32.692
WE'VE GOT TWO AREAS TO THE      
NORTH AND THREE AREAS TO THE    
SOUTH AND I APOLOGIZE ONE B     

00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:35.795
NORTH AND THREE AREAS TO THE    
SOUTH AND I APOLOGIZE ONE B     
SHOULD ALSO BE SHADED BLUE BUT  

00:10:35.797 --> 00:10:36.529
SOUTH AND I APOLOGIZE ONE B     
SHOULD ALSO BE SHADED BLUE BUT  
BASICALLY WHAT WE DID WAS WE    

00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:39.999
SHOULD ALSO BE SHADED BLUE BUT  
BASICALLY WHAT WE DID WAS WE    
TOOK THE AREAS THAT HAD THE     

00:10:40.001 --> 00:10:43.469
BASICALLY WHAT WE DID WAS WE    
TOOK THE AREAS THAT HAD THE     
HIGHEST IDENTIFIED NEED AND PUT 

00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:44.403
TOOK THE AREAS THAT HAD THE     
HIGHEST IDENTIFIED NEED AND PUT 
THAT IN OUR RECOMMENDATION SO   

00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:48.040
HIGHEST IDENTIFIED NEED AND PUT 
THAT IN OUR RECOMMENDATION SO   
THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR A      

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:48.808
THAT IN OUR RECOMMENDATION SO   
THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR A      
BOUNDARY EXPANSION COUNCIL GETS 

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.877
THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR A      
BOUNDARY EXPANSION COUNCIL GETS 
TO DECIDE THE BOUNDARY          

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:51.578
BOUNDARY EXPANSION COUNCIL GETS 
TO DECIDE THE BOUNDARY          
DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION THAT 

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.815
TO DECIDE THE BOUNDARY          
DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION THAT 
WE GET FROM COUNCIL WE WILL     

00:10:55.817 --> 00:10:56.583
DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION THAT 
WE GET FROM COUNCIL WE WILL     
INCLUDE IN OUR PLAN THAT        

00:10:56.585 --> 00:10:59.652
WE GET FROM COUNCIL WE WILL     
INCLUDE IN OUR PLAN THAT        
BOUNDARY.                       

00:10:59.654 --> 00:11:00.453
INCLUDE IN OUR PLAN THAT        
BOUNDARY.                       
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT     

00:11:00.455 --> 00:11:03.923
BOUNDARY.                       
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT     
WITH EXPANSION AREAS OUR TAXING 

00:11:03.925 --> 00:11:04.858
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT     
WITH EXPANSION AREAS OUR TAXING 
AUTHORITY PARTNERS DO HAVE THE  

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.860
WITH EXPANSION AREAS OUR TAXING 
AUTHORITY PARTNERS DO HAVE THE  
OPTION OF OPTING OUT.           

00:11:07.862 --> 00:11:08.862
AUTHORITY PARTNERS DO HAVE THE  
OPTION OF OPTING OUT.           
SO THAT DOES MEAN LESS REVENUE  

00:11:08.864 --> 00:11:11.998
OPTION OF OPTING OUT.           
SO THAT DOES MEAN LESS REVENUE  
IF THEY CHOSE TO OPT OUT.       

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.866
SO THAT DOES MEAN LESS REVENUE  
IF THEY CHOSE TO OPT OUT.       
HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T IMPACT      

00:11:12.868 --> 00:11:15.735
IF THEY CHOSE TO OPT OUT.       
HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T IMPACT      
WHERE WE CAN INVEST.            

00:11:15.737 --> 00:11:16.336
HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T IMPACT      
WHERE WE CAN INVEST.            
SHOULD COUNCIL NOT BE           

00:11:16.338 --> 00:11:19.839
WHERE WE CAN INVEST.            
SHOULD COUNCIL NOT BE           
INTERESTED IN THE EXPANDING ITS 

00:11:19.841 --> 00:11:20.240
SHOULD COUNCIL NOT BE           
INTERESTED IN THE EXPANDING ITS 
BOUNDARY?                       

00:11:20.242 --> 00:11:20.773
INTERESTED IN THE EXPANDING ITS 
BOUNDARY?                       
NO CHANGE WILL OCCUR.           

00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:23.109
BOUNDARY?                       
NO CHANGE WILL OCCUR.           
OUR PLAN WILL INCLUDE OUR       

00:11:23.111 --> 00:11:27.179
NO CHANGE WILL OCCUR.           
OUR PLAN WILL INCLUDE OUR       
CURRENT BOUNDARY SO NOW WE'RE   

00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:28.047
OUR PLAN WILL INCLUDE OUR       
CURRENT BOUNDARY SO NOW WE'RE   
GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR TIF     

00:11:28.049 --> 00:11:28.414
CURRENT BOUNDARY SO NOW WE'RE   
GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR TIF     
CAPTURE.                        

00:11:28.416 --> 00:11:31.750
GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR TIF     
CAPTURE.                        
WE WILL GO OVER THIS AND A LOT  

00:11:31.752 --> 00:11:32.485
CAPTURE.                        
WE WILL GO OVER THIS AND A LOT  
MORE DETAIL NEXT THURSDAY.      

00:11:32.487 --> 00:11:35.621
WE WILL GO OVER THIS AND A LOT  
MORE DETAIL NEXT THURSDAY.      
BUT I KIND OF WANTED TO GIVE A  

00:11:35.623 --> 00:11:38.791
MORE DETAIL NEXT THURSDAY.      
BUT I KIND OF WANTED TO GIVE A  
HIGH LEVEL TEASER ON SOME       

00:11:38.793 --> 00:11:39.825
BUT I KIND OF WANTED TO GIVE A  
HIGH LEVEL TEASER ON SOME       
OF THESE SLIDES SO THIS IS A    

00:11:39.827 --> 00:11:42.895
HIGH LEVEL TEASER ON SOME       
OF THESE SLIDES SO THIS IS A    
STANDARD TIF MODEL.             

00:11:42.897 --> 00:11:46.933
OF THESE SLIDES SO THIS IS A    
STANDARD TIF MODEL.             
THIS IS WHAT IS USED IN MOST    

00:11:46.935 --> 00:11:47.666
STANDARD TIF MODEL.             
THIS IS WHAT IS USED IN MOST    
COMMUNITIES ACROSS MICHIGAN.    

00:11:47.668 --> 00:11:50.970
THIS IS WHAT IS USED IN MOST    
COMMUNITIES ACROSS MICHIGAN.    
WE DID FIND TWO COMMUNITIES     

00:11:50.972 --> 00:11:54.707
COMMUNITIES ACROSS MICHIGAN.    
WE DID FIND TWO COMMUNITIES     
THAT USE A DIFFERENT MODEL FOR  

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:55.708
WE DID FIND TWO COMMUNITIES     
THAT USE A DIFFERENT MODEL FOR  
CAPTURE IN ARBER BEING ONE BUT  

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.311
THAT USE A DIFFERENT MODEL FOR  
CAPTURE IN ARBER BEING ONE BUT  
BASICALLY THAT ORANGE RECTANGLE 

00:11:58.313 --> 00:12:02.047
CAPTURE IN ARBER BEING ONE BUT  
BASICALLY THAT ORANGE RECTANGLE 
AT THE BOTTOM THAT IS THE BASE  

00:12:02.049 --> 00:12:02.748
BASICALLY THAT ORANGE RECTANGLE 
AT THE BOTTOM THAT IS THE BASE  
THAT TAXING THE CITY AND THE    

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.051
AT THE BOTTOM THAT IS THE BASE  
THAT TAXING THE CITY AND THE    
OTHER TAXING UNITS RETAIN AND   

00:12:06.053 --> 00:12:09.789
THAT TAXING THE CITY AND THE    
OTHER TAXING UNITS RETAIN AND   
THAT BLUE AREA ABOVE THE BASE   

00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:10.723
OTHER TAXING UNITS RETAIN AND   
THAT BLUE AREA ABOVE THE BASE   
IS THE REVENUE THAT A DIVA      

00:12:10.725 --> 00:12:15.027
THAT BLUE AREA ABOVE THE BASE   
IS THE REVENUE THAT A DIVA      
WOULD CAPTURE TO MAKE           

00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:18.063
IS THE REVENUE THAT A DIVA      
WOULD CAPTURE TO MAKE           
INVESTMENT IN IN DOWNTOWN.      

00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:19.032
WOULD CAPTURE TO MAKE           
INVESTMENT IN IN DOWNTOWN.      
SO THE NRA MODEL IS MUCH        

00:12:19.034 --> 00:12:22.368
INVESTMENT IN IN DOWNTOWN.      
SO THE NRA MODEL IS MUCH        
DIFFERENT AND WE'LL START AT    

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.872
SO THE NRA MODEL IS MUCH        
DIFFERENT AND WE'LL START AT    
THE BOTTOM SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE 

00:12:25.874 --> 00:12:26.705
DIFFERENT AND WE'LL START AT    
THE BOTTOM SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE 
WITH THE ORANGE RECTANGLE IN    

00:12:26.707 --> 00:12:30.242
THE BOTTOM SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE 
WITH THE ORANGE RECTANGLE IN    
ADDITION TO THE BASE IN ANN     

00:12:30.244 --> 00:12:30.944
WITH THE ORANGE RECTANGLE IN    
ADDITION TO THE BASE IN ANN     
ARBOR TAXING UNITS ALSO CAPTURE 

00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:33.746
ADDITION TO THE BASE IN ANN     
ARBOR TAXING UNITS ALSO CAPTURE 
INFLATION DOES NOT CAPTURE      

00:12:33.748 --> 00:12:34.280
ARBOR TAXING UNITS ALSO CAPTURE 
INFLATION DOES NOT CAPTURE      
INFLATION BUT MOST              

00:12:34.282 --> 00:12:35.047
INFLATION DOES NOT CAPTURE      
INFLATION BUT MOST              
SIGNIFICANTLY IN TWENTY         

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:38.451
INFLATION BUT MOST              
SIGNIFICANTLY IN TWENTY         
SEVENTEEN A THREE POINT FIVE    

00:12:38.453 --> 00:12:39.352
SIGNIFICANTLY IN TWENTY         
SEVENTEEN A THREE POINT FIVE    
PERCENT CAP WAS PLACED ON THE   

00:12:39.354 --> 00:12:42.588
SEVENTEEN A THREE POINT FIVE    
PERCENT CAP WAS PLACED ON THE   
DIVA'S GROWTH AND YOU CAN SEE   

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.425
PERCENT CAP WAS PLACED ON THE

02:23:22.956 --> 02:23:23.488
LIKE TO SEE OUT OF IT.          
I SEE THIS AS SIGNIFICANTLY     
DIFFERENT THAN RTC ONE

I SEE THIS AS SIGNIFICANTLY     
DIFFERENT THAN RTC ONE

THAT'S ABOUT 240000 DOLLARS PER 

02:23:38.772 --> 02:23:42.473
SUPPORT THAT'S GOING INTO THIS  
THAT'S ABOUT 240000 DOLLARS PER 
IT OF HOUSING AND YOU KNOW,     

02:23:42.475 --> 02:23:45.076
THAT'S ABOUT 240000 DOLLARS PER 
IT OF HOUSING AND YOU KNOW,     
IT'S BEEN ANTICIPATED I THINK   

02:23:45.078 --> 02:23:45.943
IT OF HOUSING AND YOU KNOW,     
IT'S BEEN ANTICIPATED I THINK   
ONE PERCENT OF THE CITY'S       

02:23:45.945 --> 02:23:46.545
IT'S BEEN ANTICIPATED I THINK   
ONE PERCENT OF THE CITY'S       
POPULATION THAT COULD           

02:23:46.547 --> 02:23:47.212
ONE PERCENT OF THE CITY'S       
POPULATION THAT COULD           
POTENTIALLY LIVE HERE IN THE    

02:23:47.214 --> 02:23:49.413
POPULATION THAT COULD           
POTENTIALLY LIVE HERE IN THE    
FUTURE RIGHT.

POTENTIALLY LIVE HERE IN THE    
FUTURE RIGHT.
