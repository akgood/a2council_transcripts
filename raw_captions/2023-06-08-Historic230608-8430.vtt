AND SO WE DID HAVE LOOKED AT BY 
A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER AND PARTS 
OF THIS TIMBER FRAME YOU KNOW,

SO REMOVING THAT TO C DO        
INSULATION OR SOME SORT         

01:40:34.007 --> 01:40:34.872
SO REMOVING THAT TO C DO        
INSULATION OR SOME SORT         
OF VERSION OF A GREEN SCREEN    

01:40:34.874 --> 01:40:37.808
INSULATION OR SOME SORT         
OF VERSION OF A GREEN SCREEN    
FROM THE INSIDE WOULD           

01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:38.609
OF VERSION OF A GREEN SCREEN    
FROM THE INSIDE WOULD           
POTENTIALLY CREATE SOME VERY    

01:40:38.611 --> 01:40:42.245
FROM THE INSIDE WOULD           
POTENTIALLY CREATE SOME VERY    
MAJOR COMPROMISES TO THE        

01:40:42.247 --> 01:40:42.780
POTENTIALLY CREATE SOME VERY    
MAJOR COMPROMISES TO THE        
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY THE        

01:40:42.782 --> 01:40:43.647
MAJOR COMPROMISES TO THE        
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY THE        
BUILDING WOULD HAVE TO DO IN A  

01:40:43.649 --> 01:40:45.983
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY THE        
BUILDING WOULD HAVE TO DO IN A  
VERY SMALL STAGES BECAUSE       

01:40:45.985 --> 01:40:46.717
BUILDING WOULD HAVE TO DO IN A  
VERY SMALL STAGES BECAUSE       
THERE&apos;S NOTHING REALLY GREEN    

01:40:46.719 --> 01:40:49.753
VERY SMALL STAGES BECAUSE       
THERE&apos;S NOTHING REALLY GREEN    
THAT SHEAR STRENGTH YOU GET     

01:40:49.755 --> 01:40:50.687
THERE&apos;S NOTHING REALLY GREEN    
THAT SHEAR STRENGTH YOU GET     
FROM PLYWOOD OR OTHER OTHER YOU 

01:40:50.689 --> 01:40:53.591
THAT SHEAR STRENGTH YOU GET     
FROM PLYWOOD OR OTHER OTHER YOU 
KNOW, LET ALAEDDIN DIAGONAL     

01:40:53.593 --> 01:40:53.990
FROM PLYWOOD OR OTHER OTHER YOU 
KNOW, LET ALAEDDIN DIAGONAL     
BRACING.                        

01:40:53.992 --> 01:40:57.461
KNOW, LET ALAEDDIN DIAGONAL     
BRACING.                        
SO IF WE WERE TO DO IT FROM     

01:40:57.463 --> 01:40:58.462
BRACING.                        
SO IF WE WERE TO DO IT FROM     
INSIDE AND DID A COUPLE         

01:40:58.464 --> 01:40:59.196
SO IF WE WERE TO DO IT FROM     
INSIDE AND DID A COUPLE         
OF PROBLEMS, ONE IS THAT IT     

01:40:59.198 --> 01:41:00.697
INSIDE AND DID A COUPLE         
OF PROBLEMS, ONE IS THAT IT     
WOULD IT WOULD BE VERY          

01:41:00.699 --> 01:41:01.598
OF PROBLEMS, ONE IS THAT IT     
WOULD IT WOULD BE VERY          
LABORIOUS IN THAT WE WOULD HAVE 

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:02.532
WOULD IT WOULD BE VERY          
LABORIOUS IN THAT WE WOULD HAVE 
TO DO IT SECTION BY SECTION AND 

01:41:02.534 --> 01:41:05.236
LABORIOUS IN THAT WE WOULD HAVE 
TO DO IT SECTION BY SECTION AND 
THEN ORDERING THE PLYWOOD BACK  

01:41:05.238 --> 01:41:05.903
TO DO IT SECTION BY SECTION AND 
THEN ORDERING THE PLYWOOD BACK  
OVER IT TO CREATE THAT SHEAR    

01:41:05.905 --> 01:41:08.805
THEN ORDERING THE PLYWOOD BACK  
OVER IT TO CREATE THAT SHEAR    
STRENGTH FROM THE INSIDE.       

01:41:08.807 --> 01:41:09.974
OVER IT TO CREATE THAT SHEAR    
STRENGTH FROM THE INSIDE.       
IF WE WERE TO TRY TO PRESERVE   

01:41:09.976 --> 01:41:10.607
STRENGTH FROM THE INSIDE.       
IF WE WERE TO TRY TO PRESERVE   
THIS SITE ON THE OUTSIDE AND    

01:41:10.609 --> 01:41:13.577
IF WE WERE TO TRY TO PRESERVE   
THIS SITE ON THE OUTSIDE AND    
PUT SPACE ON THE INSIDE OR PUT  

01:41:13.579 --> 01:41:16.113
THIS SITE ON THE OUTSIDE AND    
PUT SPACE ON THE INSIDE OR PUT  
SOME SORT OF RIGID MATRIX       

01:41:16.115 --> 01:41:17.047
PUT SPACE ON THE INSIDE OR PUT  
SOME SORT OF RIGID MATRIX       
MATERIAL ON THERE, IT&apos;S STILL   

01:41:17.049 --> 01:41:19.983
SOME SORT OF RIGID MATRIX       
MATERIAL ON THERE, IT&apos;S STILL   
NOT PROTECTING THE OUTSIDE BASE 

01:41:19.985 --> 01:41:20.851
MATERIAL ON THERE, IT&apos;S STILL   
NOT PROTECTING THE OUTSIDE BASE 
OF THE TWO BY FOUR FRAMING OR   

01:41:20.853 --> 01:41:24.221
NOT PROTECTING THE OUTSIDE BASE 
OF THE TWO BY FOUR FRAMING OR   
THE THEIR EIGHT CELLS OR MUD.   

01:41:24.223 --> 01:41:24.988
OF THE TWO BY FOUR FRAMING OR   
THE THEIR EIGHT CELLS OR MUD.   
SO THERE&apos;S NOTHING REALLY       

01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:27.925
THE THEIR EIGHT CELLS OR MUD.   
SO THERE&apos;S NOTHING REALLY       
PROTECTING THAT FROM THE WATER  

01:41:27.927 --> 01:41:28.392
SO THERE&apos;S NOTHING REALLY       
PROTECTING THAT FROM THE WATER  
RUNNING DOWN.                   

01:41:28.394 --> 01:41:29.193
PROTECTING THAT FROM THE WATER  
RUNNING DOWN.                   
SO IT REALLY, REALLY DID        

01:41:29.195 --> 01:41:29.960
RUNNING DOWN.                   
SO IT REALLY, REALLY DID        
ACTUALLY ISOLATE AND PROBABLY   

01:41:29.962 --> 01:41:32.195
SO IT REALLY, REALLY DID        
ACTUALLY ISOLATE AND PROBABLY   
EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM AND      

01:41:32.197 --> 01:41:32.897
ACTUALLY ISOLATE AND PROBABLY   
EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM AND      
SPEED UP THE DILAPIDATION       

01:41:32.899 --> 01:41:33.564
EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM AND      
SPEED UP THE DILAPIDATION       
OF DECIDING IN ANY FRAMING      

01:41:33.566 --> 01:41:36.033
SPEED UP THE DILAPIDATION       
OF DECIDING IN ANY FRAMING      
THAT&apos;S GETTING WET FROM THE     

01:41:36.035 --> 01:41:36.634
OF DECIDING IN ANY FRAMING      
THAT&apos;S GETTING WET FROM THE     
WATER COMING IN.                

01:41:36.636 --> 01:41:38.769
THAT&apos;S GETTING WET FROM THE     
WATER COMING IN.                
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE LOOKED THAT    

01:41:38.771 --> 01:41:39.503
WATER COMING IN.                
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE LOOKED THAT    
APPROACH AND THEN WHAT THE      

01:41:39.505 --> 01:41:40.070
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE LOOKED THAT    
APPROACH AND THEN WHAT THE      
ENGINEERS SAYING THAT           

01:41:40.072 --> 01:41:40.805
APPROACH AND THEN WHAT THE      
ENGINEERS SAYING THAT           
STRUCTURALLY SPEAKING IT WASN&apos;T 

01:41:40.807 --> 01:41:43.807
ENGINEERS SAYING THAT           
STRUCTURALLY SPEAKING IT WASN&apos;T 
REALLY IT WASN&apos;T A GOOD IT&apos;S AN 

01:41:43.809 --> 01:41:44.141
STRUCTURALLY SPEAKING IT WASN&apos;T 
REALLY IT WASN&apos;T A GOOD IT&apos;S AN 
APPROACH.                       

01:41:44.143 --> 01:41:44.942
REALLY IT WASN&apos;T A GOOD IT&apos;S AN 
APPROACH.                       
IT HAS TO BE TAKEN VERY         

01:41:44.944 --> 01:41:47.411
APPROACH.                       
IT HAS TO BE TAKEN VERY         
CAUTIOUSLY THAT LED US TO WELL  

01:41:47.413 --> 01:41:48.311
IT HAS TO BE TAKEN VERY         
CAUTIOUSLY THAT LED US TO WELL  
WHAT DO WE DO FROM THE OUTSIDE  

01:41:48.313 --> 01:41:51.181
CAUTIOUSLY THAT LED US TO WELL  
WHAT DO WE DO FROM THE OUTSIDE  
AND WHAT&apos;S THE BEST APPROACH    

01:41:51.183 --> 01:41:51.915
WHAT DO WE DO FROM THE OUTSIDE  
AND WHAT&apos;S THE BEST APPROACH    
THEN AND MOST COMPLETE APPROACH 

01:41:51.917 --> 01:41:54.718
AND WHAT&apos;S THE BEST APPROACH    
THEN AND MOST COMPLETE APPROACH 
REALLY.                         

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.252
THEN AND MOST COMPLETE APPROACH 
REALLY.                         
ALL RIGHT.                      

01:41:55.254 --> 01:41:55.920
REALLY.                         
ALL RIGHT.                      
I&apos;M HEARING YOU.                

01:41:55.922 --> 01:41:58.255
ALL RIGHT.                      
I&apos;M HEARING YOU.                
I&apos;M JUST WONDERING IS WOULD IT  

01:41:58.257 --> 01:41:59.189
I&apos;M HEARING YOU.                
I&apos;M JUST WONDERING IS WOULD IT  
BE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DO   

01:41:59.191 --> 01:42:01.892
I&apos;M JUST WONDERING IS WOULD IT  
BE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DO   
IT FROM THE INSIDE IS WHAT I&apos;M  

01:42:01.894 --> 01:42:02.759
BE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DO   
IT FROM THE INSIDE IS WHAT I&apos;M  
HEARING YOU&apos;RE PREFERRING TO DO 

01:42:02.761 --> 01:42:03.561
IT FROM THE INSIDE IS WHAT I&apos;M  
HEARING YOU&apos;RE PREFERRING TO DO 
IT FROM THE OUTSIDE FOR YOU&apos;VE  

01:42:03.563 --> 01:42:06.763
HEARING YOU&apos;RE PREFERRING TO DO 
IT FROM THE OUTSIDE FOR YOU&apos;VE  
DONE THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS  

01:42:06.765 --> 01:42:07.431
IT FROM THE OUTSIDE FOR YOU&apos;VE  
DONE THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
AND I THINK IT&apos;S BETTER FROM    

01:42:07.433 --> 01:42:10.267
DONE THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
AND I THINK IT&apos;S BETTER FROM    
THE INSIDE BECAUSE GOT I THINK  

01:42:10.269 --> 01:42:11.002
AND I THINK IT&apos;S BETTER FROM    
THE INSIDE BECAUSE GOT I THINK  
THE FRAMING IS THEN EXPOSED AS  

01:42:11.004 --> 01:42:13.871
THE INSIDE BECAUSE GOT I THINK  
THE FRAMING IS THEN EXPOSED AS  
ONE LAYER OF PROTECTION THAT&apos;S  

01:42:13.873 --> 01:42:14.671
THE FRAMING IS THEN EXPOSED AS  
ONE LAYER OF PROTECTION THAT&apos;S  
CURRENTLY FAILING IN AREAS AND  

01:42:14.673 --> 01:42:18.142
ONE LAYER OF PROTECTION THAT&apos;S  
CURRENTLY FAILING IN AREAS AND  
SO IT JUST ACTUALLY ISOLATES    

01:42:18.144 --> 01:42:18.676
CURRENTLY FAILING IN AREAS AND  
SO IT JUST ACTUALLY ISOLATES    
THAT, YOU KNOW.                 

01:42:18.678 --> 01:42:22.345
SO IT JUST ACTUALLY ISOLATES    
THAT, YOU KNOW.                 
SO TO WHAT EXTENT YOU KNOW, WE  

01:42:22.347 --> 01:42:23.113
THAT, YOU KNOW.                 
SO TO WHAT EXTENT YOU KNOW, WE  
DON&apos;T KNOW IF WE DON&apos;T YOU      

01:42:23.115 --> 01:42:24.048
SO TO WHAT EXTENT YOU KNOW, WE  
DON&apos;T KNOW IF WE DON&apos;T YOU      
KNOW, CHECK OUT OF EVERY 10 OR  

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:26.650
DON&apos;T KNOW IF WE DON&apos;T YOU      
KNOW, CHECK OUT OF EVERY 10 OR  
20 YEARS AND THEN WE&apos;RE DOING   

01:42:26.652 --> 01:42:27.318
KNOW, CHECK OUT OF EVERY 10 OR  
20 YEARS AND THEN WE&apos;RE DOING   
MOISTER CHECKS ON IT.           

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.319
20 YEARS AND THEN WE&apos;RE DOING   
MOISTER CHECKS ON IT.           
SO IT&apos;S IT&apos;S GUESSWORK IN THAT. 

01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:30.420
MOISTER CHECKS ON IT.           
SO IT&apos;S IT&apos;S GUESSWORK IN THAT. 
BUT OUR THOUGHT IS WE KNOW WE   

01:42:30.422 --> 01:42:31.222
SO IT&apos;S IT&apos;S GUESSWORK IN THAT. 
BUT OUR THOUGHT IS WE KNOW WE   
CAN DO IT RIGHT FROM THE        

01:42:31.224 --> 01:42:33.690
BUT OUR THOUGHT IS WE KNOW WE   
CAN DO IT RIGHT FROM THE        
OUTSIDE AND THE BUILDING WOULD  

01:42:33.692 --> 01:42:34.158
CAN DO IT RIGHT FROM THE        
OUTSIDE AND THE BUILDING WOULD  
BE BETTER FOR IT.               

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:34.491
OUTSIDE AND THE BUILDING WOULD  
BE BETTER FOR IT.               
YEAH.                           

01:42:34.493 --> 01:42:35.159

BECAUSE THERE&apos;S NO INSULATION   
RIGHT NOW THERE&apos;S A BIGGER      

01:46:31.596 --> 01:46:34.197
BECAUSE THERE&apos;S NO INSULATION   
RIGHT NOW THERE&apos;S A BIGGER      
AIRFLOW IN THE WALLS.           

01:46:34.199 --> 01:46:34.531
RIGHT NOW THERE&apos;S A BIGGER      
AIRFLOW IN THE WALLS.           
RIGHT.                          

01:46:34.533 --> 01:46:37.868
AIRFLOW IN THE WALLS.           
RIGHT.                          
AND SO WE HAVEN&apos;T SEEN ANY WAS  

01:46:37.870 --> 01:46:41.705

OBVIOUSLY GLASS MOLD YOU ANY    
MOLD COME THROUGH BECAUSE       

01:46:42.507 --> 01:46:45.341
OBVIOUSLY GLASS MOLD YOU ANY    
MOLD COME THROUGH BECAUSE       
THERE&apos;S BETTER AIRFLOW BUT      

01:46:45.343 --> 01:46:46.043
MOLD COME THROUGH BECAUSE       
THERE&apos;S BETTER AIRFLOW BUT      
BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY  

01:46:46.045 --> 01:46:49.012
THERE&apos;S BETTER AIRFLOW BUT      
BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY  
MODERN BUILDING REQUIREMENTS WE 

01:46:49.014 --> 01:46:49.813
BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY  
MODERN BUILDING REQUIREMENTS WE 
HAVE TO PUT INSULATION IN THOSE 

01:46:49.815 --> 01:46:53.016
MODERN BUILDING REQUIREMENTS WE 
HAVE TO PUT INSULATION IN THOSE 
WALLS THAT WOULD RESTRICT THE   

01:46:53.018 --> 01:46:53.750
HAVE TO PUT INSULATION IN THOSE 
WALLS THAT WOULD RESTRICT THE   
AIRFLOW WHICH WOULD THEN CREATE 

01:46:53.752 --> 01:46:56.619
WALLS THAT WOULD RESTRICT THE   
AIRFLOW WHICH WOULD THEN CREATE 
A BIGGER PROBLEM.               

01:46:56.621 --> 01:47:03.660
AIRFLOW WHICH WOULD THEN CREATE 
A BIGGER PROBLEM.               
UM AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, YOU      

01:47:17.975 --> 01:47:19.610
MENTIONED THE WHOLESALE LACK    
OF EVIDENCE OF A WHOLESALE      
FAILURE.                        

01:47:19.612 --> 01:47:20.610
OF EVIDENCE OF A WHOLESALE      
FAILURE.

FIXING THE PROBLEM ON THE       
OUTSIDE EVEN IF IT&apos;S NOT A      
WHOLESALE FAIL, IT&apos;S A PARTIAL  

01:47:25.484 --> 01:47:26.150
OUTSIDE EVEN IF IT&apos;S NOT A      
WHOLESALE FAIL, IT&apos;S A PARTIAL  
FAILURE OF 20 PERCENT, 40       

01:47:26.152 --> 01:47:26.950
WHOLESALE FAIL, IT&apos;S A PARTIAL  
FAILURE OF 20 PERCENT, 40       
PERCENT WHATEVER THAT NUMBER    

01:47:26.952 --> 01:47:27.217
FAILURE OF 20 PERCENT, 40       
PERCENT WHATEVER THAT NUMBER    
IS.                             

01:47:27.219 --> 01:47:27.951
PERCENT WHATEVER THAT NUMBER    
IS.                             
WE&apos;RE WE&apos;RE THEN ISOLATING THAT

IS.                             
WE&apos;RE WE&apos;RE THEN ISOLATING THAT 
THAT MOISTURE INTO THE          

01:47:28.621 --> 01:47:29.252
WE&apos;RE WE&apos;RE THEN ISOLATING THAT 
THAT MOISTURE INTO THE          
FRAMEWORK AND WHATEVER GETS     

01:47:29.254 --> 01:47:30.053
THAT MOISTURE INTO THE          
FRAMEWORK AND WHATEVER GETS     
BEHIND THAT SLIDING WE&apos;LL NEVER 

01:47:30.055 --> 01:47:30.721
FRAMEWORK AND WHATEVER GETS     
BEHIND THAT SLIDING WE&apos;LL NEVER 
SEE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE SCIENCE  

01:47:30.723 --> 01:47:31.522
BEHIND THAT SLIDING WE&apos;LL NEVER 
SEE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE SCIENCE  
STARTS FALLING OFF AND THEN YOU 

01:47:31.524 --> 01:47:32.122
SEE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE SCIENCE  
STARTS FALLING OFF AND THEN YOU 
RUIN FRAMING IT PERMANENTLY.    

01:47:32.124 --> 01:47:32.856
STARTS FALLING OFF AND THEN YOU 
RUIN FRAMING IT PERMANENTLY.    
AND SO THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.       

01:47:32.858 --> 01:47:35.859
RUIN FRAMING IT PERMANENTLY.    
AND SO THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.       
IT&apos;S IT&apos;S THAT BALANCE BETWEEN  

01:47:35.861 --> 01:47:37.060
AND SO THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.       
IT&apos;S IT&apos;S THAT BALANCE BETWEEN  
IF WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT NO    

01:47:37.062 --> 01:47:39.329
IT&apos;S IT&apos;S THAT BALANCE BETWEEN  
IF WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT NO    
ONE BUT WE CAN&apos;T REALLY DO IT   

01:47:39.331 --> 01:47:40.096
IF WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT NO    
ONE BUT WE CAN&apos;T REALLY DO IT   
RIGHT FROM THE INSIDE AND IT&apos;S  

01:47:40.098 --> 01:47:40.930
ONE BUT WE CAN&apos;T REALLY DO IT   
RIGHT FROM THE INSIDE AND IT&apos;S  
TAKING IT OFF OUTSIDE THE RIGHT 

01:47:40.932 --> 01:47:43.701
RIGHT FROM THE INSIDE AND IT&apos;S  
TAKING IT OFF OUTSIDE THE RIGHT 
WAY I DON&apos;T KNOW BUT INOW       

01:47:43.703 --> 01:47:44.434
TAKING IT OFF OUTSIDE THE RIGHT 
WAY I DON&apos;T KNOW BUT INOW       
IT&apos;S GOING TO WORK AND IT&apos;S     

01:47:44.436 --> 01:47:47.237
WAY I DON&apos;T KNOW BUT INOW       
IT&apos;S GOING TO WORK AND IT&apos;S     
GOING TO LOOK THE SAME THAT I   

01:47:47.239 --> 01:47:48.104
IT&apos;S GOING TO WORK AND IT&apos;S     
GOING TO LOOK THE SAME THAT I   
DO KNOW AND THAT PRESERVES THE  

01:47:48.106 --> 01:47:50.074
GOING TO LOOK THE SAME THAT I   
DO KNOW AND THAT PRESERVES THE  
STRUCTURE OF THE BUILDING TO    

01:47:50.076 --> 01:47:50.941
DO KNOW AND THAT PRESERVES THE  
STRUCTURE OF THE BUILDING TO    
PRESERVE THE VISUAL INTEGRITY   

01:47:50.943 --> 01:47:51.141
STRUCTURE OF THE BUILDING TO    
PRESERVE THE VISUAL INTEGRITY   
OF IT.                          

01:47:51.143 --> 01:47:54.010
PRESERVE THE VISUAL INTEGRITY   
OF IT.                          
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE WENT THAT      

01:47:54.012 --> 01:47:54.811
OF IT.                          
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE WENT THAT      
APPROACH BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE   

01:47:54.813 --> 01:47:58.114
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE WENT THAT      
APPROACH BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE   
IT WAS THE BEST SOLUTION AND I  

01:47:58.116 --> 01:47:58.915
APPROACH BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE   
IT WAS THE BEST SOLUTION AND I  
APPRECIATE THAT IT&apos;S JUST MORE  

01:47:58.917 --> 01:48:01.919
IT WAS THE BEST SOLUTION AND I  
APPRECIATE THAT IT&apos;S JUST MORE  
OF AND I APPRECIATE             

01:48:01.921 --> 01:48:02.586
APPRECIATE THAT IT&apos;S JUST MORE  
OF AND I APPRECIATE             
COMMISSIONER EVERSON SAYING,    

01:48:02.588 --> 01:48:03.520
OF AND I APPRECIATE             
COMMISSIONER EVERSON SAYING,    
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS    

01:48:03.522 --> 01:48:06.890
COMMISSIONER EVERSON SAYING,    
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS    
ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH A LOT   

01:48:06.892 --> 01:48:07.524
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS    
ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH A LOT   
OF EXPENSE AND TROUBLE FOR      

01:48:07.526 --> 01:48:07.858
ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH A LOT   
OF EXPENSE AND TROUBLE FOR      
THIS.                           

01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:08.058
OF EXPENSE AND TROUBLE FOR      
THIS.                           
RIGHT.                          

01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:10.360
THIS.                           
RIGHT.                          
AND IT WILL LOOK THE SAME BUT   

01:48:10.362 --> 01:48:11.127
RIGHT.                          
AND IT WILL LOOK THE SAME BUT   
IT&apos;S STILL YOU KNOW, WE&apos;RE      

01:48:11.129 --> 01:48:11.762
AND IT WILL LOOK THE SAME BUT   
IT&apos;S STILL YOU KNOW, WE&apos;RE      
STILL KIND OF CHARGED WITH      

01:48:11.764 --> 01:48:13.964
IT&apos;S STILL YOU KNOW, WE&apos;RE      
STILL KIND OF CHARGED WITH      
PROTECTING THAT AREA.           

01:48:13.966 --> 01:48:15.099
STILL KIND OF CHARGED WITH      
PROTECTING THAT AREA.           
BUT IF WE DON&apos;T GO FROM THE     

01:48:15.101 --> 01:48:17.100
PROTECTING THAT AREA.           
BUT IF WE DON&apos;T GO FROM THE     
OUTSIDE, WE KNOW THERE&apos;S        

01:48:17.102 --> 01:48:18.034
BUT IF WE DON&apos;T GO FROM THE     
OUTSIDE, WE KNOW THERE&apos;S        
FAILURES AND IF WE DON&apos;T GET    

01:48:18.036 --> 01:48:21.104
OUTSIDE, WE KNOW THERE&apos;S        
FAILURES AND IF WE DON&apos;T GET    
THEM ALL WE DON&apos;T YOU KNOW, AND 

01:48:21.106 --> 01:48:22.006
FAILURES AND IF WE DON&apos;T GET    
THEM ALL WE DON&apos;T YOU KNOW, AND 
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE AGAIN IN THE   

01:48:22.008 --> 01:48:22.806
THEM ALL WE DON&apos;T YOU KNOW, AND 
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE AGAIN IN THE   
FUTURE AT SOME POINT IF IT&apos;S    

01:48:22.808 --> 01:48:25.142
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE AGAIN IN THE   
FUTURE AT SOME POINT IF IT&apos;S    
NOT IF WE REPLACE YOU KNOW, THE 

01:48:25.144 --> 01:48:26.209
FUTURE AT SOME POINT IF IT&apos;S    
NOT IF WE REPLACE YOU KNOW, THE 
AREAS WE KNOW FOR SURE IF WE    

01:48:26.211 --> 01:48:27.010
NOT IF WE REPLACE YOU KNOW, THE 
AREAS WE KNOW FOR SURE IF WE    
MISSED SOMETHING THAT AREA IS   

01:48:27.012 --> 01:48:29.446
AREAS WE KNOW FOR SURE IF WE    
MISSED SOMETHING THAT AREA IS   
GOING TO GET INFILTRATED BY     

01:48:29.448 --> 01:48:30.246
MISSED SOMETHING THAT AREA IS   
GOING TO GET INFILTRATED BY     
WHAT EVERY EVERY HEADCASE THAT  

01:48:30.248 --> 01:48:30.981
GOING TO GET INFILTRATED BY     
WHAT EVERY EVERY HEADCASE THAT  
THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  

01:48:30.983 --> 01:48:32.983
WHAT EVERY EVERY HEADCASE THAT  
THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  
PREVIOUSLY.                     

01:48:32.985 --> 01:48:33.984
THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  
PREVIOUSLY.                     
WE CAN TELL IT&apos;S NEW MATERIAL.  

01:48:33.986 --> 01:48:34.784
PREVIOUSLY.                     
WE CAN TELL IT&apos;S NEW MATERIAL.  
SO THERE&apos;S BEEN DIFFERENT WATER 

01:48:34.786 --> 01:48:37.087
WE CAN TELL IT&apos;S NEW MATERIAL.  
SO THERE&apos;S BEEN DIFFERENT WATER 
ISSUES IN THE PAST.             

01:48:37.089 --> 01:48:37.921
SO THERE&apos;S BEEN DIFFERENT WATER 
ISSUES IN THE PAST.             
YOU KNOW, WITHOUT STRIPPING     

01:48:37.923 --> 01:48:38.722
ISSUES IN THE PAST.             
YOU KNOW, WITHOUT STRIPPING     
INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE WE DON&apos;T  

01:48:38.724 --> 01:48:40.224
YOU KNOW, WITHOUT STRIPPING     
INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE WE DON&apos;T  
REALLY KNOW THE EXTENT THAT     

01:48:40.226 --> 01:48:41.091
INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE WE DON&apos;T  
REALLY KNOW THE EXTENT THAT     
WE&apos;VE ONLY EXPOSED ONLY A VERY  

01:48:41.093 --> 01:48:41.758
REALLY KNOW THE EXTENT THAT     
WE&apos;VE ONLY EXPOSED ONLY A VERY  
FEW PLACES BECAUSE FROM THE     

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:44.627
WE&apos;VE ONLY EXPOSED ONLY A VERY  
FEW PLACES BECAUSE FROM THE     
INSIDE EVERYTHING IS STRUCTURAL 

01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:45.095
FEW PLACES BECAUSE FROM THE     
INSIDE EVERYTHING IS STRUCTURAL 
THE SHEETING.                   

01:48:45.097 --> 01:48:47.965
INSIDE EVERYTHING IS STRUCTURAL 
THE SHEETING.                   
SO THERE&apos;S JUST NOT THAT MUCH   

01:48:47.967 --> 01:48:48.865
THE SHEETING.                   
SO THERE&apos;S JUST NOT THAT MUCH

01:48:48.867 --> 01:48:49.466
SO THERE&apos;S JUST NOT THAT MUCH   
OF ABILITY TO SEE THERE AND     
IT&apos;S ALL GOT BLOWN IN           

01:48:49.468 --> 01:48:50.067
OF ABILITY TO SEE THERE AND     
IT&apos;S ALL GOT BLOWN IN           
INSULATION AND IT&apos;S JUST SO     

01:48:50.069 --> 01:48:52.536
IT&apos;S ALL GOT BLOWN IN           
INSULATION AND IT&apos;S JUST SO     
THERE&apos;S JUST THERE&apos;S A LOT      

01:48:52.538 --> 01:48:53.337
INSULATION AND IT&apos;S JUST SO     
THERE&apos;S JUST THERE&apos;S A LOT      
OF DIFFERENT PITFALLS IN THIS   

01:48:53.339 --> 01:48:55.873
THERE&apos;S JUST THERE&apos;S A LOT      
OF DIFFERENT PITFALLS IN THIS   
BUT WE&apos;RE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT

DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEMS      

01:49:06.985 --> 01:49:07.751
WELL I THINK YOU KNOW THE       
DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEMS      
OF DOING IT FROM THE INSIDE     

01:49:07.753 --> 01:49:08.651
DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEMS      
OF DOING IT FROM THE INSIDE     
HAVE MADE ME THINK ABOUT THIS   

01:49:08.653 --> 01:49:11.522
OF DOING IT FROM THE INSIDE     
HAVE MADE ME THINK ABOUT THIS   
IN TERMS OF WE&apos;RE SACRIFICING   

01:49:11.524 --> 01:49:15.125
HAVE MADE ME THINK ABOUT THIS   
IN TERMS OF WE&apos;RE SACRIFICING   
SOME HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THIS    

01:49:15.127 --> 01:49:16.159
IN TERMS OF WE&apos;RE SACRIFICING   
SOME HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THIS

BUT PIECEMEAL IS THE WAY THAT   
THE STANDARDS ARE SAYING.       
BUT THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S AN          

01:52:40.599 --> 01:52:41.264
THE STANDARDS ARE SAYING.       
BUT THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S AN          
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.      

01:52:41.266 --> 01:52:41.999
BUT THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S AN          
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.      
I THINK THAT WAS ALTERATION     

01:52:42.001 --> 01:52:44.601
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.      
I THINK THAT WAS ALTERATION     
CORRECT BECAUSE I THINK IT&apos;S    

01:52:44.603 --> 01:52:45.535
I THINK THAT WAS ALTERATION     
CORRECT BECAUSE I THINK IT&apos;S    
ALSO JUST LOOKING AT ONE FOR    

01:52:45.537 --> 01:52:46.003
CORRECT BECAUSE I THINK IT&apos;S    
ALSO JUST LOOKING AT ONE FOR    
SAYING THAT YES.                

01:52:46.005 --> 01:52:48.271
ALSO JUST LOOKING AT ONE FOR    
SAYING THAT YES.                
THAT THAT IS PART OF THE        

01:52:48.273 --> 01:52:48.738
SAYING THAT YES.                
THAT THAT IS PART OF THE        
STANDARD.                       

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:49.505
THAT THAT IS PART OF THE        
STANDARD.                       
BUT IF WE&apos;RE NOT LOOKING AT THE 

01:52:49.507 --> 01:52:52.141
STANDARD.                       
BUT IF WE&apos;RE NOT LOOKING AT THE 
OVERALL LIKE IT&apos;S PART OF THE   

01:52:52.143 --> 01:52:56.012
BUT IF WE&apos;RE NOT LOOKING AT THE 
OVERALL LIKE IT&apos;S PART OF THE   
REASON IT&apos;S FAILING IS BECAUSE  

01:52:56.014 --> 01:52:56.813
OVERALL LIKE IT&apos;S PART OF THE   
REASON IT&apos;S FAILING IS BECAUSE  
THERE IS ALSO A BUILDING SYSTEM 

01:52:56.815 --> 01:52:59.582
REASON IT&apos;S FAILING IS BECAUSE  
THERE IS ALSO A BUILDING SYSTEM 
PROBLEM OF INSULATION INSTALLED 

01:52:59.584 --> 01:53:00.416
THERE IS ALSO A BUILDING SYSTEM 
PROBLEM OF INSULATION INSTALLED 
PREVIOUSLY THAT CAUSED THE      

01:53:00.418 --> 01:53:00.850
PROBLEM OF INSULATION INSTALLED 
PREVIOUSLY THAT CAUSED THE      
SIDING FAILURE.                 

01:53:00.852 --> 01:53:01.651
PREVIOUSLY THAT CAUSED THE      
SIDING FAILURE.                 
SO IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO GO BACK    

01:53:01.653 --> 01:53:04.187
SIDING FAILURE.                 
SO IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO GO BACK    
AND PUT INSULATION AGAIN, IT&apos;S  

01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.988
SO IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO GO BACK    
AND PUT INSULATION AGAIN, IT&apos;S  
STILL GOING TO CAUSE A PROBLEM  

01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:07.657
AND PUT INSULATION AGAIN, IT&apos;S  
STILL GOING TO CAUSE A PROBLEM  
AGAIN, WHICH IS WHY I THINK     

01:53:07.659 --> 01:53:08.425
STILL GOING TO CAUSE A PROBLEM  
AGAIN, WHICH IS WHY I THINK     
THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR         

01:53:08.427 --> 01:53:09.159
AGAIN, WHICH IS WHY I THINK     
THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR         
INSTANCE THE WAY THAT THE HOUSE 

01:53:09.161 --> 01:53:12.495
THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR         
INSTANCE THE WAY THAT THE HOUSE 
WAS WAS BUILT WITH THE SIDING   

01:53:12.497 --> 01:53:14.797
INSTANCE THE WAY THAT THE HOUSE 
WAS WAS BUILT WITH THE SIDING   
DIRECTLY AGAINST THE FRAMING    

01:53:14.799 --> 01:53:15.565
WAS WAS BUILT WITH THE SIDING   
DIRECTLY AGAINST THE FRAMING    
AND THE STRUCTURAL DISCUSSION   

01:53:15.567 --> 01:53:19.670
DIRECTLY AGAINST THE FRAMING    
AND THE STRUCTURAL DISCUSSION   
THE WAY IT IS THE SHEER SUPPORT 

01:53:19.672 --> 01:53:20.403
AND THE STRUCTURAL DISCUSSION   
THE WAY IT IS THE SHEER SUPPORT 
EXISTS IN THE HOUSE DIFFERENT   

01:53:20.405 --> 01:53:23.073
THE WAY IT IS THE SHEER SUPPORT 
EXISTS IN THE HOUSE DIFFERENT   
FROM THE INTERIOR IS EXTREMELY  

01:53:23.075 --> 01:53:23.740
EXISTS IN THE HOUSE DIFFERENT   
FROM THE INTERIOR IS EXTREMELY  
EXTENSIVE AND THAT IS           

01:53:23.742 --> 01:53:24.541
FROM THE INTERIOR IS EXTREMELY  
EXTENSIVE AND THAT IS           
INSULATION IS JUST PUT BACK IN  

01:53:24.543 --> 01:53:27.410
EXTENSIVE AND THAT IS           
INSULATION IS JUST PUT BACK IN  
WITHOUT JUST REPLACING PARTS    

01:53:27.412 --> 01:53:27.778
INSULATION IS JUST PUT BACK IN  
WITHOUT JUST REPLACING PARTS    
OF THE SIDING.                  

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:31.380
WITHOUT JUST REPLACING PARTS    
OF THE SIDING.                  
THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO COME    

01:53:31.382 --> 01:53:32.115
OF THE SIDING.                  
THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO COME    
BACK UP AGAIN AND DETERIORATE   

01:53:32.117 --> 01:53:34.984
THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO COME    
BACK UP AGAIN AND DETERIORATE   
THE SIDING AGAIN.               

01:53:34.986 --> 01:53:35.585
BACK UP AGAIN AND DETERIORATE   
THE SIDING AGAIN.               
I AGREE WITH THAT.              

01:53:35.587 --> 01:53:37.887
THE SIDING AGAIN.               
I AGREE WITH THAT.              
THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE DESIGN 

01:53:37.889 --> 01:53:38.955
I AGREE WITH THAT.              
THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE DESIGN 
THE WAY IT IS AND MAINTAIN ITS  

01:53:38.957 --> 01:53:39.623
THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE DESIGN 
THE WAY IT IS AND MAINTAIN ITS  
INTEGRITY IS TO NOT PUT         

01:53:39.625 --> 01:53:42.625
THE WAY IT IS AND MAINTAIN ITS  
INTEGRITY IS TO NOT PUT         
INSULATION ON THE WALLS CORRECT 

01:53:42.627 --> 01:53:43.426
INTEGRITY IS TO NOT PUT         
INSULATION ON THE WALLS CORRECT 
BECAUSE HEAT HEAT THE SIDING    

01:53:43.428 --> 01:53:46.829
INSULATION ON THE WALLS CORRECT 
BECAUSE HEAT HEAT THE SIDING    
USING YOUR HEATER AND I THINK   

01:53:46.831 --> 01:53:50.133
BECAUSE HEAT HEAT THE SIDING    
USING YOUR HEATER AND I THINK   
IN THIS CASE THAT WAS BECAUSE   

01:53:50.135 --> 01:53:50.600
USING YOUR HEATER AND I THINK   
IN THIS CASE THAT WAS BECAUSE   
OF AN OWNER.                    

01:53:50.602 --> 01:53:50.933
IN THIS CASE THAT WAS BECAUSE   
OF AN OWNER.                    
RIGHT.                          

01:53:50.935 --> 01:53:54.170
OF AN OWNER.                    
RIGHT.                          
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS         

01:53:54.172 --> 01:53:54.938
RIGHT.                          
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS         
SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW, I   

01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:57.740
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS         
SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW, I   
THINK I DON&apos;T THINK WE CAN      

01:53:57.742 --> 01:54:01.178
SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW, I   
THINK I DON&apos;T THINK WE CAN      
IGNORE THE ENERGY CONSERVATION  

01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:05.047
THINK I DON&apos;T THINK WE CAN      
IGNORE THE ENERGY CONSERVATION  
EFFORT OF OF WHERE WE ARE IN    

01:54:05.049 --> 01:54:05.515
IGNORE THE ENERGY CONSERVATION  
EFFORT OF OF WHERE WE ARE IN    
TODAY&apos;S SOCIETY.

EFFORT OF OF WHERE WE ARE IN    
TODAY&apos;S SOCIETY.

01:54:06.385 --> 01:54:09.019
TODAY&apos;S SOCIETY.                
I JUST DON&apos;T THINK WE CAN&apos;T IN  
INSULATION REQUIREMENTS.        

01:54:09.021 --> 01:54:09.986
I JUST DON&apos;T THINK WE CAN&apos;T IN  
INSULATION REQUIREMENTS.

THAT&apos;S BACK HERE THAT&apos;S SORT    

02:07:41.532 --> 02:07:42.131
IT WOULD LEAVE US FENCING       
THAT&apos;S BACK HERE THAT&apos;S SORT    
OF A TRASH ENCLOSURE.           

02:07:42.133 --> 02:07:47.937
THAT&apos;S BACK HERE THAT&apos;S SORT    
OF A TRASH ENCLOSURE.           
WHAT                            

02:08:01.618 --> 02:08:05.253
     ABOUT THE TREE?            
THE TREE GOES AND THEY WOULD    
LIKE TO PUT A STACKED BLOCK LOW 

02:08:05.255 --> 02:08:06.755
THE TREE GOES AND THEY WOULD    
LIKE TO PUT A STACKED BLOCK LOW 
CEILING WALL ALONG THE FRONT    

02:08:06.757 --> 02:08:08.257
LIKE TO PUT A STACKED BLOCK LOW 
CEILING WALL ALONG THE FRONT    
OF THE SPACE HERE AND PUT IN A  

02:08:08.259 --> 02:08:09.424
CEILING WALL ALONG THE FRONT    
OF THE SPACE HERE AND PUT IN A  
BLUE STONE PATIO LIKE THIS ON   

02:08:09.426 --> 02:08:10.459
OF THE SPACE HERE AND PUT IN A  
BLUE STONE PATIO LIKE THIS ON   
THE LEFT AND THEN THE STAIRS    

02:08:10.461 --> 02:08:11.093
BLUE STONE PATIO LIKE THIS ON   
THE LEFT AND THEN THE STAIRS    
WOULD JUST BE THIS              

02:08:11.095 --> 02:08:11.827
THE LEFT AND THEN THE STAIRS    
WOULD JUST BE THIS              
CONFIGURATION THAT ONLY         

02:08:11.829 --> 02:08:15.764
WOULD JUST BE THIS              
CONFIGURATION THAT ONLY         
REQUIRES THESE HANDRAILS TO GET 

02:08:15.766 --> 02:08:16.031
CONFIGURATION THAT ONLY         
REQUIRES THESE HANDRAILS TO GET 
UP.                             

02:08:16.033 --> 02:08:16.899
REQUIRES THESE HANDRAILS TO GET 
UP.                             
I DO IT WITH THREE STEPS        

02:08:16.901 --> 02:08:18.967
UP.                             
I DO IT WITH THREE STEPS        
INSTEAD OF THAT BIG GUARDRAIL.  

02:08:18.969 --> 02:08:19.801
I DO IT WITH THREE STEPS        
INSTEAD OF THAT BIG GUARDRAIL.  
I THINK THAT&apos;S A HUGE           

02:08:19.803 --> 02:08:22.604
INSTEAD OF THAT BIG GUARDRAIL.  
I THINK THAT&apos;S A HUGE           
IMPROVEMENT RIGHT THERE.        

02:08:22.606 --> 02:08:23.939
I THINK THAT&apos;S A HUGE           
IMPROVEMENT RIGHT THERE.        
MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A    

02:08:23.941 --> 02:08:27.209
IMPROVEMENT RIGHT THERE.        
MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A    
LOT OF HARD SPACE AT THE CORNER 

02:08:27.211 --> 02:08:31.047
MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A    
LOT OF HARD SPACE AT THE CORNER 
IN WHAT HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A 

02:08:31.049 --> 02:08:31.714
LOT OF HARD SPACE AT THE CORNER 
IN WHAT HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A 
RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WHICH      

02:08:31.716 --> 02:08:33.248
IN WHAT HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A 
RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WHICH      
CLEARLY IS NOT A RESIDENTIAL    

02:08:33.250 --> 02:08:37.687
RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WHICH      
CLEARLY IS NOT A RESIDENTIAL    
BUILDING ANYMORE.               

02:08:37.689 --> 02:08:38.587
CLEARLY IS NOT A RESIDENTIAL    
BUILDING ANYMORE.               
SO THIS IS MY DILEMMA.          

02:08:38.589 --> 02:08:42.024
BUILDING ANYMORE.               
SO THIS IS MY DILEMMA.          
THEY&apos;RE UNDER THE LANDSCAPING.  

02:08:42.026 --> 02:08:45.727
SO THIS IS MY DILEMMA.          
THEY&apos;RE UNDER THE LANDSCAPING.  
I TALKED TO THE ARCHITECT ABOUT 

02:08:45.729 --> 02:08:46.661
THEY&apos;RE UNDER THE LANDSCAPING.  
I TALKED TO THE ARCHITECT ABOUT 
IT AND THE LANDSCAPING WAS SORT 

02:08:46.663 --> 02:08:47.229
I TALKED TO THE ARCHITECT ABOUT 
IT AND THE LANDSCAPING WAS SORT 
OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT.             

02:08:47.231 --> 02:08:47.430
IT AND THE LANDSCAPING WAS SORT 
OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT.             
YEAH.                           

02:08:47.432 --> 02:08:49.564
OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT.             
YEAH.                           
TO ME WITH MY COMMENTS TO JUST  

02:08:49.566 --> 02:08:53.135
YEAH.                           
TO ME WITH MY COMMENTS TO JUST  
NOT MAKE IT A BIG HARD SPACE SO 

02:08:53.137 --> 02:08:54.136
TO ME WITH MY COMMENTS TO JUST  
NOT MAKE IT A BIG HARD SPACE SO 
THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT WAY  

02:08:54.138 --> 02:08:57.005
NOT MAKE IT A BIG HARD SPACE SO 
THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT WAY  
OF DOING THAT.                  

02:08:57.007 --> 02:08:58.007
THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT WAY  
OF DOING THAT.                  
THEY&apos;RE JUST SHOWING A COUPLE   

02:08:58.009 --> 02:08:58.607
OF DOING THAT.                  
THEY&apos;RE JUST SHOWING A COUPLE   
OF SORT OF PLANTING BEDS BUT    

02:08:58.609 --> 02:09:01.176
THEY&apos;RE JUST SHOWING A COUPLE   
OF SORT OF PLANTING BEDS BUT    
YOU CAN TALK OVER YOU KNOW, IF

02:09:02.780 --> 02:09:05.247
YOU&apos;VE GOT PEOPLE SITTING ON    
THE STAIRS, THE STAIRS ARE A    
LITTLE BIT EXTRA DEEP STILL     

02:09:05.249 --> 02:09:06.081
THE STAIRS, THE STAIRS ARE A    
LITTLE BIT EXTRA DEEP STILL     
MAKE CODE BUT SO YOU CAN SIT ON 

02:09:06.083 --> 02:09:08.850
LITTLE BIT EXTRA DEEP STILL     
MAKE CODE BUT SO YOU CAN SIT ON 
THEM A LITTLE EASIER AND THEY   

02:09:08.852 --> 02:09:09.684
MAKE CODE BUT SO YOU CAN SIT ON 
THEM A LITTLE EASIER AND THEY   
REALLY JUST WANT TO UTILIZE     

02:09:09.686 --> 02:09:12.721
THEM A LITTLE EASIER AND THEY   
REALLY JUST WANT TO UTILIZE     
THIS SPACE.

REALLY JUST WANT TO UTILIZE     
THIS SPACE.                     
THIS WOULD STILL BE LAWN OVER   

02:09:13.857 --> 02:09:19.761
THIS SPACE.                     
THIS WOULD STILL BE LAWN OVER   
HERE IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  

02:09:19.763 --> 02:09:20.830
THIS WOULD STILL BE LAWN OVER   
HERE IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  
SO WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE
