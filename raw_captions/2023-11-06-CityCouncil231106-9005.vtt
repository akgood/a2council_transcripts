IN A VACUUM BUT WE TAKE A       

01:45:03.257 --> 01:45:03.989
JUST CONSIDER MULTI LANE ROADS  
IN A VACUUM BUT WE TAKE A       
HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON

IDEALLY THESE IMPROVEMENTS      

01:45:14.702 --> 01:45:15.567
PROBLEM TO ANOTHER.             
IDEALLY THESE IMPROVEMENTS      
COULD BE MADE TOGETHER OR WE    

01:45:15.569 --> 01:45:16.168
IDEALLY THESE IMPROVEMENTS      
COULD BE MADE TOGETHER OR WE    
NEED TO DEVELOP A TIMELY

IMPORTANT DATA POINT FOR US TO  

01:54:03.397 --> 01:54:04.462
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK IT&apos;S IT&apos;S AN     
IMPORTANT DATA POINT FOR US TO  
CONSIDER AS AS WE LOOK AT THE   

01:54:04.464 --> 01:54:07.732

BUT I DO THINK THAT THE DATA IS 

01:54:17.444 --> 01:54:20.278
RECONFIGURATIONS.               
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE DATA IS 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT A   

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:20.946
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE DATA IS 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT A   
MORE HOLISTIC PICTURE.          

01:54:20.948 --> 01:54:23.748
IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT A

PEOPLE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO LIVE 

01:54:51.011 --> 01:54:53.478
NEIGHBORHOODS FOREVER OR WILL   
PEOPLE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO LIVE 
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO MAYBE    

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:53.945
PEOPLE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO LIVE 
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO MAYBE    
USE TRANSIT?                    

01:54:53.947 --> 01:54:57.515
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO MAYBE    
USE TRANSIT?                    
AND SINCE WE ARE TRAFFIC        

01:54:57.517 --> 01:54:58.383

CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE         
DIFFERENCE WOULD BE AS WE       

01:55:06.593 --> 01:55:09.261
CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE         
DIFFERENCE WOULD BE AS WE       
WELCOME MORE HOUSING SO WE&apos;RE   

01:55:09.263 --> 01:55:12.931
DIFFERENCE WOULD BE AS WE       
WELCOME MORE HOUSING SO WE&apos;RE   
TO MORE HERE.                   

01:55:12.933 --> 01:55:13.998
WELCOME MORE HOUSING SO WE&apos;RE

01:55:18.172 --> 01:55:21.039
MEMBER DENHA AND COUNCIL MEMBER 
SONG AND I ALSO THINK BY HAVING 
THAT VOLUME TRAFFIC VOLUME DATA 

01:55:21.041 --> 01:55:21.840
SONG AND I ALSO THINK BY HAVING 
THAT VOLUME TRAFFIC VOLUME DATA 
FOR FOR ESPECIALLY FOR THROUGH  

01:55:21.842 --> 01:55:24.810
THAT VOLUME TRAFFIC VOLUME DATA 
FOR FOR ESPECIALLY FOR THROUGH  
TRAFFIC AND NEIGHBORHOOD IT CAN 

01:55:24.812 --> 01:55:25.543
FOR FOR ESPECIALLY FOR THROUGH  
TRAFFIC AND NEIGHBORHOOD IT CAN 
HELP TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OTHER    

01:55:25.545 --> 01:55:28.680
TRAFFIC AND NEIGHBORHOOD IT CAN 
HELP TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OTHER    
INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS WE HAVE     

01:55:28.682 --> 01:55:29.614
HELP TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OTHER    
INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS WE HAVE     
LIKE THE FACT THAT THOSE        

01:55:29.616 --> 01:55:33.084
INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS WE HAVE     
LIKE THE FACT THAT THOSE        
NEIGHBORHOODS BOTH ON PACARD    

01:55:33.086 --> 01:55:35.721
LIKE THE FACT THAT THOSE        
NEIGHBORHOODS BOTH ON PACARD    
AND ON THAT MANY OF THEM DON&apos;T  

01:55:35.723 --> 01:55:36.521
NEIGHBORHOODS BOTH ON PACARD    
AND ON THAT MANY OF THEM DON&apos;T  
HAVE SIDEWALKS AND THAT&apos;S       

01:55:36.523 --> 01:55:39.857
AND ON THAT MANY OF THEM DON&apos;T  
HAVE SIDEWALKS AND THAT&apos;S       
SOMETHING THAT THIS CUT THIS    

01:55:39.859 --> 01:55:40.392
HAVE SIDEWALKS AND THAT&apos;S       
SOMETHING THAT THIS CUT THIS    
INCREASE AND CUT THROUGH        

01:55:40.394 --> 01:55:41.192
SOMETHING THAT THIS CUT THIS    
INCREASE AND CUT THROUGH        
TRAFFIC HAS HELPED TO REALLY    

01:55:41.194 --> 01:55:43.729
INCREASE AND CUT THROUGH        
TRAFFIC HAS HELPED TO REALLY    
HIGHLIGHT HOW IT&apos;S AN           

01:55:43.731 --> 01:55:44.496
TRAFFIC HAS HELPED TO REALLY    
HIGHLIGHT HOW IT&apos;S AN           
ACCESSIBILITY AND SAFETY ISSUE. 

01:55:44.498 --> 01:55:46.898
HIGHLIGHT HOW IT&apos;S AN           
ACCESSIBILITY AND SAFETY ISSUE. 
SO I THINK THAT SOME OF THIS    

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:47.766
ACCESSIBILITY AND SAFETY ISSUE. 
SO I THINK THAT SOME OF THIS    
THIS DATA WILL BE HELPFUL       

01:55:47.768 --> 01:55:51.303
SO I THINK THAT SOME OF THIS    
THIS DATA WILL BE HELPFUL       
WHETHER IT&apos;S THIS OR OTHER DATA 

01:55:51.305 --> 01:55:51.702
THIS DATA WILL BE HELPFUL       
WHETHER IT&apos;S THIS OR OTHER DATA

WHETHER IT&apos;S THIS OR OTHER DATA 
POINTS.                         
I THINK HAVING SOME ADDITIONAL  

01:55:54.742 --> 01:55:55.540
POINTS.                         
I THINK HAVING SOME ADDITIONAL

01:55:55.542 --> 01:56:04.882
I THINK HAVING SOME ADDITIONAL
