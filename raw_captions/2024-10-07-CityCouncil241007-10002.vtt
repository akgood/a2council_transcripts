THAT'S A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE  
DC ONE DISTRICT AND THAT DOES   

01:38:54.286 --> 01:38:56.821
THAT'S A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE

REMAIN IT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT

DC ONE DISTRICT AND THAT DOES   
REMAIN IT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT   
THE BUILDING FRONTAGE

REMAIN IT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT   
THE BUILDING FRONTAGE

THE BUILDING FRONTAGE

BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRENTLY SET

BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRENTLY SET  
AT SEVENTY PERCENT THEN YOU CAN 

01:39:04.897 --> 01:39:08.232
BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRENTLY SET  
AT SEVENTY PERCENT THEN YOU CAN 
GET A PARKING LOT NEXT TO A

AT SEVENTY PERCENT THEN YOU CAN 
GET A PARKING LOT NEXT TO A     
BUILDING BUT THE DISTANCE       

01:39:09.001 --> 01:39:11.635
GET A PARKING LOT NEXT TO A

I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION      
ABOUT THE CURB CUTS ISSUE WHICH

I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION      
ABOUT THE CURB CUTS ISSUE WHICH 
IS A POINT WELL TAKEN.          

01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:38.295
ABOUT THE CURB CUTS ISSUE WHICH 
IS A POINT WELL TAKEN.          
WE KNOW THAT CURB CUTS          

01:39:38.297 --> 01:39:38.962
IS A POINT WELL TAKEN.          
WE KNOW THAT CURB CUTS          
INCREASES CONFLICTS BETWEEN

WE KNOW THAT CURB CUTS          
INCREASES CONFLICTS BETWEEN     
PEDESTRIANS, PEOPLE BIKING AND  

01:39:43.269 --> 01:39:46.937
INCREASES CONFLICTS BETWEEN     
PEDESTRIANS, PEOPLE BIKING AND  
TRAFFIC AND MY UNDERSTANDING AS 

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:47.771
PEDESTRIANS, PEOPLE BIKING AND  
TRAFFIC AND MY UNDERSTANDING AS 
I READ THIS IS THAT WE WERE     

01:39:47.773 --> 01:39:50.841
TRAFFIC AND MY UNDERSTANDING AS 
I READ THIS IS THAT WE WERE     
TRYING TO CREATE A SINGLE       

01:39:50.843 --> 01:39:54.445
I READ THIS IS THAT WE WERE     
TRYING TO CREATE A SINGLE       
STANDARD ACROSS RATHER THAN     

01:39:54.447 --> 01:39:55.345
TRYING TO CREATE A SINGLE       
STANDARD ACROSS RATHER THAN     
HAVING A SPECIAL ONE FOR TAXI

STANDARD ACROSS RATHER THAN     
HAVING A SPECIAL ONE FOR TAXI   
ONE.

HAVING A SPECIAL ONE FOR TAXI   
ONE.                            
BUT I GUESS I'M NOT REALLY      

01:39:56.515 --> 01:39:58.916
ONE.                            
BUT I GUESS I'M NOT REALLY      
UNDERSTANDING WHY WE WOULDN'T   

01:39:58.918 --> 01:39:59.650
BUT I GUESS I'M NOT REALLY      
UNDERSTANDING WHY WE WOULDN'T   
BRING THE CURB CUT STANDARDS TO 

01:39:59.652 --> 01:40:02.553
UNDERSTANDING WHY WE WOULDN'T   
BRING THE CURB CUT STANDARDS TO 
BE MORE IN LINE WITH TAXI ONE   

01:40:02.555 --> 01:40:03.320
BRING THE CURB CUT STANDARDS TO 
BE MORE IN LINE WITH TAXI ONE   
AS IT EXISTS NOW RATHER THAN    

01:40:03.322 --> 01:40:06.824
BE MORE IN LINE WITH TAXI ONE   
AS IT EXISTS NOW RATHER THAN    
DEFERRING TO WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN 

01:40:06.826 --> 01:40:07.425
AS IT EXISTS NOW RATHER THAN    
DEFERRING TO WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN 
OUTMODED STANDARD FOR THE

DEFERRING TO WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN 
OUTMODED STANDARD FOR THE       
NUMBER OF CURB CUTS.            

01:40:10.463 --> 01:40:13.931
OUTMODED STANDARD FOR THE       
NUMBER OF CURB CUTS.            
I HEAR YOU ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT 

01:40:13.933 --> 01:40:14.731
NUMBER OF CURB CUTS.            
I HEAR YOU ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT 
SAY THAT OUR CURRENT STANDARDS  

01:40:14.733 --> 01:40:18.836
I HEAR YOU ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT 
SAY THAT OUR CURRENT STANDARDS  
CITYWIDE ARE THE PHILOSOPHY     

01:40:18.838 --> 01:40:21.838
SAY THAT OUR CURRENT STANDARDS  
CITYWIDE ARE THE PHILOSOPHY     
OF THE CONCEPT IS NOW NOT       

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.173
CITYWIDE ARE THE PHILOSOPHY     
OF THE CONCEPT IS NOW NOT       
OUTMODED.                       

01:40:22.175 --> 01:40:23.040
OF THE CONCEPT IS NOW NOT       
OUTMODED.                       
I THINK THE KEY PRINCIPLE HERE  

01:40:23.042 --> 01:40:25.976
OUTMODED.                       
I THINK THE KEY PRINCIPLE HERE  
IS THE T-3 ONE DISTRICT HAS A   

01:40:25.978 --> 01:40:26.444
I THINK THE KEY PRINCIPLE HERE  
IS THE T-3 ONE DISTRICT HAS A   
FIXED NUMBER.                   

01:40:26.446 --> 01:40:30.081
IS THE T-3 ONE DISTRICT HAS A   
FIXED NUMBER.                   
IT SAYS VERY SMALL SITES TWO    

01:40:30.083 --> 01:40:30.881
FIXED NUMBER.                   
IT SAYS VERY SMALL SITES TWO    
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET AND LOT  

01:40:30.883 --> 01:40:33.684
IT SAYS VERY SMALL SITES TWO    
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET AND LOT  
WITH ONE CURB CUTS PERIOD AND   

01:40:33.686 --> 01:40:34.285
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET AND LOT  
WITH ONE CURB CUTS PERIOD AND   
THAT IS FINE.                   

01:40:34.287 --> 01:40:35.319
WITH ONE CURB CUTS PERIOD AND   
THAT IS FINE.                   
THAT IS A LITTLE BIT IN LINE    

01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:37.955
THAT IS FINE.                   
THAT IS A LITTLE BIT IN LINE    
WITH WHAT SITES SMALLER SITES   

01:40:37.957 --> 01:40:41.592
THAT IS A LITTLE BIT IN LINE    
WITH WHAT SITES SMALLER SITES   
GET CURRENTLY BUT IT SAYS SITES 

01:40:41.594 --> 01:40:42.393
WITH WHAT SITES SMALLER SITES   
GET CURRENTLY BUT IT SAYS SITES 
LARGER THAN TWO HUNDRED AND     

01:40:42.395 --> 01:40:44.462
GET CURRENTLY BUT IT SAYS SITES 
LARGER THAN TWO HUNDRED AND     
FIFTY FEET AND LOT WIDTH YOU    

01:40:44.464 --> 01:40:45.796
LARGER THAN TWO HUNDRED AND     
FIFTY FEET AND LOT WIDTH YOU    
GET TO PERIOD THERE IS NO WAIT  

01:40:45.798 --> 01:40:48.699
FIFTY FEET AND LOT WIDTH YOU    
GET TO PERIOD THERE IS NO WAIT  
THERE.                          

01:40:48.701 --> 01:40:49.766
GET TO PERIOD THERE IS NO WAIT  
THERE.                          
I THINK THE KEY PIECE THAT THE  

01:40:49.768 --> 01:40:50.434
THERE.                          
I THINK THE KEY PIECE THAT THE  
DC ONE DISTRICT IS MISSING IS   

01:40:50.436 --> 01:40:53.270
I THINK THE KEY PIECE THAT THE  
DC ONE DISTRICT IS MISSING IS   
THE RATE AND THAT THERE IS NO   

01:40:53.272 --> 01:40:56.440
DC ONE DISTRICT IS MISSING IS   
THE RATE AND THAT THERE IS NO   
RECOGNITION FOR A SIGNIFICANT   

01:40:56.442 --> 01:40:57.040
THE RATE AND THAT THERE IS NO   
RECOGNITION FOR A SIGNIFICANT   
AMOUNT OF FRONTAGE.             

01:40:57.042 --> 01:40:59.743
RECOGNITION FOR A SIGNIFICANT   
AMOUNT OF FRONTAGE.             
WE HAVE SITES THAT MIGHT KNOW   

01:40:59.745 --> 01:41:00.911
AMOUNT OF FRONTAGE.             
WE HAVE SITES THAT MIGHT KNOW   
WHAT THIS MEANS IS IF A SITE IS 

01:41:00.913 --> 01:41:07.150
WE HAVE SITES THAT MIGHT KNOW   
WHAT THIS MEANS IS IF A SITE IS 
A HALF A MILE WIDE IN THE TWIN, 

01:41:07.152 --> 01:41:11.221
WHAT THIS MEANS IS IF A SITE IS 
A HALF A MILE WIDE IN THE TWIN, 
SOME FRONTAGE STILL ONLY GETS   

01:41:11.223 --> 01:41:13.890
A HALF A MILE WIDE IN THE TWIN, 
SOME FRONTAGE STILL ONLY GETS   
TO CURB CUTS THAT YOU CAN'T     

01:41:13.892 --> 01:41:14.725
SOME FRONTAGE STILL ONLY GETS   
TO CURB CUTS THAT YOU CAN'T     
BUILD AS IF YOU WANTED TO.      

01:41:14.727 --> 01:41:15.659
TO CURB CUTS THAT YOU CAN'T     
BUILD AS IF YOU WANTED TO.      
YOU CAN'T BUILD A STREET GRID   

01:41:15.661 --> 01:41:18.396
BUILD AS IF YOU WANTED TO.      
YOU CAN'T BUILD A STREET GRID   
WITH THAT YOU IT JUST GETS TO   

01:41:18.398 --> 01:41:22.199
YOU CAN'T BUILD A STREET GRID   
WITH THAT YOU IT JUST GETS TO   
THERE'S NO RATE AND SO I THINK  

01:41:22.201 --> 01:41:23.066
WITH THAT YOU IT JUST GETS TO   
THERE'S NO RATE AND SO I THINK  
THE KEY PIECE FOR HERE IS WE    

01:41:23.068 --> 01:41:26.036
THERE'S NO RATE AND SO I THINK  
THE KEY PIECE FOR HERE IS WE    
WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE A RATE  

01:41:26.038 --> 01:41:26.937
THE KEY PIECE FOR HERE IS WE    
WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE A RATE  
AND THEN RATHER THAN BUILD UPON 

01:41:26.939 --> 01:41:30.241
WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE A RATE  
AND THEN RATHER THAN BUILD UPON 
AND COMPLICATED WITH DIFFERENT  

01:41:30.243 --> 01:41:31.108
AND THEN RATHER THAN BUILD UPON 
AND COMPLICATED WITH DIFFERENT  
RATES, LET'S JUST USE THE SAME  

01:41:31.110 --> 01:41:32.076
AND COMPLICATED WITH DIFFERENT  
RATES, LET'S JUST USE THE SAME  
RATE AS WE DO THE REST OF THE   

01:41:32.078 --> 01:41:33.844
RATES, LET'S JUST USE THE SAME  
RATE AS WE DO THE REST OF THE   
CITY.                           

01:41:33.846 --> 01:41:34.978
RATE AS WE DO THE REST OF THE   
CITY.                           
WE CAN DISCUSS WHAT THE RATE    

01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:38.148
CITY.                           
WE CAN DISCUSS WHAT THE RATE    
MIGHT BE AND BUILD A SPECIFIC   

01:41:38.150 --> 01:41:38.782
WE CAN DISCUSS WHAT THE RATE    
MIGHT BE AND BUILD A SPECIFIC   
ONE FOR A TAXI ONE.             

01:41:38.784 --> 01:41:42.119
MIGHT BE AND BUILD A SPECIFIC   
ONE FOR A TAXI ONE.             
BUT AS STAFF WE DO RECOGNIZE    

01:41:42.121 --> 01:41:43.053
ONE FOR A TAXI ONE.             
BUT AS STAFF WE DO RECOGNIZE    
IT'S A FAIRLY SORT OF A FAILURE 

01:41:43.055 --> 01:41:45.389
BUT AS STAFF WE DO RECOGNIZE    
IT'S A FAIRLY SORT OF A FAILURE 
OF THE DISTRICT NOT TO HAVE A   

01:41:45.391 --> 01:41:46.190
IT'S A FAIRLY SORT OF A FAILURE 
OF THE DISTRICT NOT TO HAVE A   
SCALE OR FLEXIBILITY AT ALL.    

01:41:46.192 --> 01:41:48.926
OF THE DISTRICT NOT TO HAVE A   
SCALE OR FLEXIBILITY AT ALL.    
A RATE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE     

01:41:48.928 --> 01:41:52.797
SCALE OR FLEXIBILITY AT ALL.    
A RATE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE     
SITE SIZES ARE DIFFERENT.       

01:41:52.799 --> 01:42:03.040
A RATE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE     
SITE SIZES ARE DIFFERENT.       
THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION

                            .   
SO HARD TO THINK AND TAKE NOTES

01:42:21.026 --> 01:42:24.461
REALLY VERY, VERY CLEARLY       
EXPLAINED WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE   
WITHOUT A BUILDING FRONTAGE     

01:42:24.463 --> 01:42:24.795
EXPLAINED WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE   
WITHOUT A BUILDING FRONTAGE     
STANDARD.                       

01:42:24.797 --> 01:42:25.596
WITHOUT A BUILDING FRONTAGE     
STANDARD.

01:42:25.598 --> 01:42:27.665
STANDARD.                       
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION    
THAT IF WE LOOK AT OUR DOWNTOWN 

01:42:27.667 --> 01:42:28.532
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION    
THAT IF WE LOOK AT OUR DOWNTOWN 
THIS WAS WHAT WAS PERSUASIVE AT 

01:42:28.534 --> 01:42:29.200
THAT IF WE LOOK AT OUR DOWNTOWN 
THIS WAS WHAT WAS PERSUASIVE AT 
PLANNING COMMISSION WAS THE     

01:42:29.202 --> 01:42:31.668
THIS WAS WHAT WAS PERSUASIVE AT 
PLANNING COMMISSION WAS THE     
STAFF PRESENTATION WITH SLIDES  

01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:32.370
PLANNING COMMISSION WAS THE     
STAFF PRESENTATION WITH SLIDES

STAFF PRESENTATION WITH SLIDES

01:42:36.509 --> 01:42:39.310
PLACES DOWNTOWN AND WHAT THE    
BUILDING FRONTAGES WERE.        
SO ZINGERMAN'S EVENT SPACE IS   

01:42:39.312 --> 01:42:39.943
BUILDING FRONTAGES WERE.        
SO ZINGERMAN'S EVENT SPACE IS   
100 PERCENT FRONT EDGE.         

01:42:39.945 --> 01:42:40.811
SO ZINGERMAN'S EVENT SPACE IS   
100 PERCENT FRONT EDGE.         
THAT MIGHT NOT BE YOUR FAVORITE 

01:42:40.813 --> 01:42:42.979
100 PERCENT FRONT EDGE.         
THAT MIGHT NOT BE YOUR FAVORITE 
PLACE TO WALK IN THE CITY

THAT MIGHT NOT BE YOUR FAVORITE 
PLACE TO WALK IN THE CITY

HELPFUL?                        
SO WE BOUGHT THE PROPERTY IN    

02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:50.332
