CRASHES AND THEN WE SAW THE     

00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:48.720
THE HIGHEST RATING BEING FATAL  
CRASHES AND THEN WE SAW THE     
CORRIDORS IN THE INTERSECTIONS  

00:12:48.722 --> 00:12:52.022

00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:23.520
AND THOSE FOCUS INTERSECTIONS.  
>> IT MAY SOUND A LITTLE        
STRANGE THAT WE HAVE TO SELECT  

00:13:23.522 --> 00:13:26.524
>> IT MAY SOUND A LITTLE        
STRANGE THAT WE HAVE TO SELECT  
SOME OF THESE CORRIDORS BUT     

00:13:26.526 --> 00:13:27.358
STRANGE THAT WE HAVE TO SELECT  
SOME OF THESE CORRIDORS BUT     
THERE IS A VERIFICATION PROCESS 

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.464
SOME OF THESE CORRIDORS BUT     
THERE IS A VERIFICATION PROCESS 
THAT HAPPENS                    

00:13:33.565 --> 00:13:37.935
             AND TODAY I'M      
GOING TO HAVE YOU CONTINUE ON   
THIS VICTORY.

00:13:38.405 --> 00:13:42.039
THIS VICTORY.                   
>> YES.                         
SO THIS SLIDE AS CYNTHIA IS     

00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:42.740
>> YES.                         
SO THIS SLIDE AS CYNTHIA IS     
TAKING A STEP, THIS REALLY      

00:13:42.742 --> 00:13:45.810
SO THIS SLIDE AS CYNTHIA IS     
TAKING A STEP, THIS REALLY      
TALKS ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY     

00:13:45.812 --> 00:13:46.744
TAKING A STEP, THIS REALLY      
TALKS ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY     
LIKE THE KIND OF NUANCE OF HOW  

00:13:46.746 --> 00:13:49.847
TALKS ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY     
LIKE THE KIND OF NUANCE OF HOW  
WE ARE JOINING ALL OF THOSE     

00:13:49.849 --> 00:13:56.787
LIKE THE KIND OF NUANCE OF HOW  
WE ARE JOINING ALL OF THOSE     
INTERSECTIONS TOGETHER NOW.     

00:13:56.789 --> 00:13:57.956
WE ARE JOINING ALL OF THOSE     
INTERSECTIONS TOGETHER NOW.     
YEAH, SO THERE'S THIS GRAPHIC   

00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.025
INTERSECTIONS TOGETHER NOW.     
YEAH, SO THERE'S THIS GRAPHIC   
SORT OF SHOWS A PROGRESSION     

00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:05.163
YEAH, SO THERE'S THIS GRAPHIC   
SORT OF SHOWS A PROGRESSION     
OF OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AND   

00:14:05.165 --> 00:14:08.733
SORT OF SHOWS A PROGRESSION     
OF OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AND   
WE START WITH CREEDY OR         

00:14:08.735 --> 00:14:09.467
OF OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AND   
WE START WITH CREEDY OR         
CLEANING INTERSECTION NODE'S    

00:14:09.469 --> 00:14:13.538
WE START WITH CREEDY OR         
CLEANING INTERSECTION NODE'S    
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK     

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.640
CLEANING INTERSECTION NODE'S    
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK     
THAT WENT INTO THAT ORIGINAL    

00:14:16.642 --> 00:14:21.111
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK     
THAT WENT INTO THAT ORIGINAL    
MAPPING PROCESS SOME OF THAT    

00:14:21.113 --> 00:14:22.179
THAT WENT INTO THAT ORIGINAL    
MAPPING PROCESS SOME OF THAT    
HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT THE 

00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:24.615
MAPPING PROCESS SOME OF THAT    
HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT THE 
ROAD SEGMENTS ARE BROKEN UP BY  

00:14:24.617 --> 00:14:28.185
HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT THE 
ROAD SEGMENTS ARE BROKEN UP BY  
THE STATE FOR ANALYSIS WHEN WE  

00:14:28.187 --> 00:14:32.022
ROAD SEGMENTS ARE BROKEN UP BY  
THE STATE FOR ANALYSIS WHEN WE  
LOSE SOFTWARE SUCH AS SOFT AND  

00:14:32.024 --> 00:14:32.890
THE STATE FOR ANALYSIS WHEN WE  
LOSE SOFTWARE SUCH AS SOFT AND  
THAT NOT ALL OF THOSE SEGMENTS  

00:14:32.892 --> 00:14:33.557
LOSE SOFTWARE SUCH AS SOFT AND  
THAT NOT ALL OF THOSE SEGMENTS  
AND NOT ALL OF THOSE            

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:36.094
THAT NOT ALL OF THOSE SEGMENTS  
AND NOT ALL OF THOSE            
INTERSECTION INTERSECTIONS      

00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:36.627
AND NOT ALL OF THOSE            
INTERSECTION INTERSECTIONS      
COMPLETELY MAKES SENSE.         

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:40.798
INTERSECTION INTERSECTIONS      
COMPLETELY MAKES SENSE.         
ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE 

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.068
COMPLETELY MAKES SENSE.         
ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE 
A LOT OF WORK TO DO FOR THAT IS 

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:44.869
ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE 
A LOT OF WORK TO DO FOR THAT IS 
ACTUALLY IN ROUNDABOUTS BECAUSE 

00:14:44.871 --> 00:14:47.305
A LOT OF WORK TO DO FOR THAT IS 
ACTUALLY IN ROUNDABOUTS BECAUSE 
THE ROUNDABOUTS TEND TO SHOW UP 

00:14:47.307 --> 00:14:48.239
ACTUALLY IN ROUNDABOUTS BECAUSE 
THE ROUNDABOUTS TEND TO SHOW UP 
IN IN THE THE STATE FRAMEWORK   

00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:51.575
THE ROUNDABOUTS TEND TO SHOW UP 
IN IN THE THE STATE FRAMEWORK   
AS BEING LOTS OF DISCRETE       

00:14:51.577 --> 00:14:52.443
IN IN THE THE STATE FRAMEWORK   
AS BEING LOTS OF DISCRETE       
SEGMENTS WHEN IT'S REALLY THE   

00:14:52.445 --> 00:14:55.446
AS BEING LOTS OF DISCRETE       
SEGMENTS WHEN IT'S REALLY THE   
WHOLE ROUNDABOUT IS OPERATING   

00:14:55.448 --> 00:14:56.180
SEGMENTS WHEN IT'S REALLY THE   
WHOLE ROUNDABOUT IS OPERATING   
AS A SINGLE INTERSECTION.       

00:14:56.182 --> 00:14:59.083
WHOLE ROUNDABOUT IS OPERATING   
AS A SINGLE INTERSECTION.       
SO AFTER THAT CLEAN UP HAPPENED 

00:14:59.085 --> 00:14:59.884
AS A SINGLE INTERSECTION.       
SO AFTER THAT CLEAN UP HAPPENED 
WE ASSIGN CRASHES TO THOSE      

00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:06.157
SO AFTER THAT CLEAN UP HAPPENED 
WE ASSIGN CRASHES TO THOSE      
INTERSECTIONS THEN WE'RE        

00:15:20.305 --> 00:15:22.840
SCORING BASED ON THE CRASHES AS 
WE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY AND

THEN WE GET OUR FINAL RESULT    
FOR OUR INTERSECTIONS.          

00:15:24.844 --> 00:15:25.643
THEN WE GET OUR FINAL RESULT    
FOR OUR INTERSECTIONS.          
MOST OF THE CLEANING UP WORK ON 

00:15:25.645 --> 00:15:26.377
FOR OUR INTERSECTIONS.          
MOST OF THE CLEANING UP WORK ON 
THE INTERSECTIONS REALLY

OF LOOKING AT IT AND MAKING     

00:18:14.047 --> 00:18:16.747
MATHEMATICALLY AND JUST SORT    
OF LOOKING AT IT AND MAKING     
SURE THAT THE CRASH PATTERNS    

00:18:16.749 --> 00:18:19.116
OF LOOKING AT IT AND MAKING     
SURE THAT THE CRASH PATTERNS    
ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHERE WE'RE 

00:18:19.118 --> 00:18:23.087
SURE THAT THE CRASH PATTERNS

ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHERE WE'RE 
SEEING HOTSPOTS.                
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE       

00:18:24.189 --> 00:18:27.357
SEEING HOTSPOTS.                
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE       
REALLY WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE 

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:28.058
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE       
REALLY WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE 
FORMALIZED AND MADE MORE CLEAR  

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.927
REALLY WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE 
FORMALIZED AND MADE MORE CLEAR  
WITH EVERYONE IS THE FREQUENT   

00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:31.996
FORMALIZED AND MADE MORE CLEAR  
WITH EVERYONE IS THE FREQUENT   
THAT WE WILL BE DOING THE       

00:18:31.998 --> 00:18:35.732
WITH EVERYONE IS THE FREQUENT   
THAT WE WILL BE DOING THE       
SAFETY ANALYSIS THAT WILL       

00:18:35.734 --> 00:18:39.303
THAT WE WILL BE DOING THE       
SAFETY ANALYSIS THAT WILL       
COINCIDE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT   

00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:40.037
SAFETY ANALYSIS THAT WILL       
COINCIDE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

DONE EVERY TWO YEARS.           
SO ONCE THIS ANALYSIS IS RUN WE 

00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:50.681
DONE EVERY TWO YEARS.           
SO ONCE THIS ANALYSIS IS RUN WE 
WOULD NOT BE UPDATING THAT

PERFORMS CRASH INVESTIGATIONS   
THAT SEEMED LIKE A VERY         
CONVOLUTED WAY OF SAYING THESE  

00:21:13.692 --> 00:21:17.328
THAT SEEMED LIKE A VERY         
CONVOLUTED WAY OF SAYING THESE  
ARE EXTREMELY SERIOUS INJURY    

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.964
CONVOLUTED WAY OF SAYING THESE  
ARE EXTREMELY SERIOUS INJURY    
CRASHES AND THERE IS A LOT

OF DIFFERENCE THAT CAN BE FOUND 
IN SOME OF THOSE HIGH LEVEL     
INJURIES.

LIEUTENANT SCHERBA HAD PROVIDED 
A PRESENTATION ON THIS A COUPLE 

00:21:33.713 --> 00:21:34.511
LIEUTENANT SCHERBA HAD PROVIDED 
A PRESENTATION ON THIS A COUPLE 
OF MONTHS AGO AND WE SAW WHERE  

00:21:34.513 --> 00:21:36.246
A PRESENTATION ON THIS A COUPLE 
OF MONTHS AGO AND WE SAW WHERE  
THOSE MPHASIS CORRIDORS WERE    

00:21:36.248 --> 00:21:37.014
OF MONTHS AGO AND WE SAW WHERE  
THOSE MPHASIS CORRIDORS WERE    
ALONG KIND OF JACKSON PACARD    

00:21:37.016 --> 00:21:40.284
THOSE MPHASIS CORRIDORS WERE    
ALONG KIND OF JACKSON PACARD

ALONG KIND OF JACKSON PACARD    
AND WASHTENAW AREA.             
SO WE REALLY DID WANT TO TARGET 

00:21:41.421 --> 00:21:42.086
AND WASHTENAW AREA.             
SO WE REALLY DID WANT TO TARGET 
SOME OF THOSE MORE SEVERE       

00:21:42.088 --> 00:21:45.455
SO WE REALLY DID WANT TO TARGET 
SOME OF THOSE MORE SEVERE       
INJURY CRASHES AND WE'RE        

00:21:45.457 --> 00:21:46.323
SOME OF THOSE MORE SEVERE       
INJURY CRASHES AND WE'RE        
PROPOSING THAT AS ONE AREA FOR  

00:21:46.325 --> 00:21:48.392

IS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO      
PEERS.                          
IT'S NOT PERFORMANCE RELATIVE   

00:30:53.205 --> 00:30:56.406
PEERS.                          
IT'S NOT PERFORMANCE RELATIVE   
TO AN ABSOLUTE SO EVEN WHEN WE  

00:30:56.408 --> 00:31:00.443
IT'S NOT PERFORMANCE RELATIVE   
TO AN ABSOLUTE SO EVEN WHEN WE  
ACHIEVE VISION ZERO AND WE      

00:31:00.445 --> 00:31:01.178
TO AN ABSOLUTE SO EVEN WHEN WE  
ACHIEVE VISION ZERO AND WE      
DON'T HAVE ANY MORE FATALITIES, 

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.881
ACHIEVE VISION ZERO AND WE      
DON'T HAVE ANY MORE FATALITIES, 
WE WILL STILL HAVE TIER ONE AND 

00:31:04.883 --> 00:31:05.482
DON'T HAVE ANY MORE FATALITIES, 
WE WILL STILL HAVE TIER ONE AND 
TIER TWO CORRIDORS AND          

00:31:05.484 --> 00:31:08.618
WE WILL STILL HAVE TIER ONE AND 
TIER TWO CORRIDORS AND          
INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE IT WILL   

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.619
TIER TWO CORRIDORS AND          
INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE IT WILL   
BE A LOOK AT HOW THE SYSTEM IS  

00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:12.622
INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE IT WILL   
BE A LOOK AT HOW THE SYSTEM IS  
PERFORMING RELATIVE TO ITS

BE A LOOK AT HOW THE SYSTEM IS  
PERFORMING RELATIVE TO ITS

00:31:28.907 --> 00:31:29.573
BECAUSE THE CRASHES ARE         
CHANGING AND THE CRASH TYPES    
WILL PROBABLY BE CHANGING A

CITY.                           
OUR OUR FIRST PASS WILL BE TO   
LOOK AT THE MEAN AND STANDARD   

00:32:22.928 --> 00:32:23.393
OUR OUR FIRST PASS WILL BE TO   
LOOK AT THE MEAN AND STANDARD   
DEVIATIONS ABOVE.               

00:32:23.395 --> 00:32:26.496
LOOK AT THE MEAN AND STANDARD   
DEVIATIONS ABOVE.               
SO IF IT'S ONE STANDARD         

00:32:26.498 --> 00:32:27.430
DEVIATIONS ABOVE.               
SO IF IT'S ONE STANDARD         
DEVIATION ABOVE THE MEAN THEN   

00:32:27.432 --> 00:32:27.964
SO IF IT'S ONE STANDARD         
DEVIATION ABOVE THE MEAN THEN   
THAT IS TIER ONE.               

00:32:27.966 --> 00:32:30.867
DEVIATION ABOVE THE MEAN THEN   
THAT IS TIER ONE.               
IF IT'S TO STANDARD DEVIATIONS  

00:32:30.869 --> 00:32:34.471
THAT IS TIER ONE.               
IF IT'S TO STANDARD DEVIATIONS  
ABOVE THE MEAN THEN IT WOULD BE 

00:32:34.473 --> 00:32:35.405
IF IT'S TO STANDARD DEVIATIONS  
ABOVE THE MEAN THEN IT WOULD BE 
ONE STANDARD DEVIATION IS TIER  

00:32:35.407 --> 00:32:38.808
ABOVE THE MEAN THEN IT WOULD BE 
ONE STANDARD DEVIATION IS TIER  
TWO TIER STANDARD DEVIATION IF  

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.612
ONE STANDARD DEVIATION IS TIER  
TWO TIER STANDARD DEVIATION IF  
THERE IS A TIER ONE SIDE        

00:32:42.614 --> 00:32:43.613
TWO TIER STANDARD DEVIATION IF  
THERE IS A TIER ONE SIDE        
FURTHER AWAY YOU ARE FROM THE   

00:32:43.615 --> 00:32:44.648
THERE IS A TIER ONE SIDE        
FURTHER AWAY YOU ARE FROM THE   
MEAN THE HIGHER THE FOCUS'S OK  

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:50.821
FURTHER AWAY YOU ARE FROM THE   
MEAN THE HIGHER THE FOCUS'S OK  
THANK YOU

OF TIME REVIEWING OR THE WHAT I 
LIKE TO CALL THE ORIGINAL       
SEGMENT WITHIN WE DO HAVE THE   

00:33:08.807 --> 00:33:12.642
LIKE TO CALL THE ORIGINAL       
SEGMENT WITHIN WE DO HAVE THE   
GRAPHIC FROM THE PLAN THAT

SHOWCASES OUR TIER ONE AND HERE 

00:33:16.181 --> 00:33:17.114
GRAPHIC FROM THE PLAN THAT      
SHOWCASES OUR TIER ONE AND HERE 
TWO SEGMENTS AND TWO OF THE     

00:33:17.116 --> 00:33:20.784
SHOWCASES OUR TIER ONE AND HERE 
TWO SEGMENTS AND TWO OF THE     
SEGMENTS THAT WE WANT TO CALL   

00:33:20.786 --> 00:33:21.517
TWO SEGMENTS AND TWO OF THE     
SEGMENTS THAT WE WANT TO CALL   
OUT THAT WE SAW AS PROBLEMATIC  

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:24.220
SEGMENTS THAT WE WANT TO CALL   
OUT THAT WE SAW AS PROBLEMATIC  
WHEN WE STARTED THIS EVALUATION 

00:33:24.222 --> 00:33:25.021
OUT THAT WE SAW AS PROBLEMATIC  
WHEN WE STARTED THIS EVALUATION 
WORK WAS HERE ON PARKWAY.       

00:33:25.023 --> 00:33:25.488
WHEN WE STARTED THIS EVALUATION 
WORK WAS HERE ON PARKWAY.       
OH RIGHT.                       

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.958
WORK WAS HERE ON PARKWAY.       
OH RIGHT.                       
NOW I'M DRAWING OF AN IMAGINARY 

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.562
OH RIGHT.                       
NOW I'M DRAWING OF AN IMAGINARY 
LINE FROM HERE ON PARKWAY TO    

00:33:32.564 --> 00:33:33.296
NOW I'M DRAWING OF AN IMAGINARY 
LINE FROM HERE ON PARKWAY TO    
SHOW THE ENTIRETY OF THE        

00:33:33.298 --> 00:33:35.665
LINE FROM HERE ON PARKWAY TO    
SHOW THE ENTIRETY OF THE        
SEGMENT BY WHICH IT WAS SCORED. 

00:33:35.667 --> 00:33:39.268
SHOW THE ENTIRETY OF THE        
SEGMENT BY WHICH IT WAS SCORED. 
SO WE HAVE THIS SEGMENT         

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.872
SEGMENT BY WHICH IT WAS SCORED. 
SO WE HAVE THIS SEGMENT         
STARTING OFF VERY FAR NORTH     

00:33:42.874 --> 00:33:43.339
SO WE HAVE THIS SEGMENT         
STARTING OFF VERY FAR NORTH     
PLYMOUTH ROAD.                  

00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:44.140
STARTING OFF VERY FAR NORTH     
PLYMOUTH ROAD.                  
OH NO SORRY.                    

00:33:44.142 --> 00:33:47.310
PLYMOUTH ROAD.                  
OH NO SORRY.                    
AND THEN AGAIN CROSSING         

00:33:47.312 --> 00:33:47.978
OH NO SORRY.                    
AND THEN AGAIN CROSSING         
PLYMOUTH ROAD ALL THROUGH       

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.480
AND THEN AGAIN CROSSING         
PLYMOUTH ROAD ALL THROUGH       
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PROPERTY 

00:33:51.482 --> 00:33:55.285
PLYMOUTH ROAD ALL THROUGH       
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PROPERTY 
COMING DOWN FURTHER SOUTH UNTIL 

00:33:55.287 --> 00:33:58.387
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PROPERTY 
COMING DOWN FURTHER SOUTH UNTIL 
IT ENDS AT WASHINGTON AVENUE.   

00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:59.289
COMING DOWN FURTHER SOUTH UNTIL 
IT ENDS AT WASHINGTON AVENUE.   
AND AS CYNTHIA HAD NOTED BEFORE 

00:33:59.291 --> 00:34:02.559
IT ENDS AT WASHINGTON AVENUE.   
AND AS CYNTHIA HAD NOTED BEFORE 
THAT SEGMENTATION MAY NOT MAKE  

00:34:02.561 --> 00:34:03.426
AND AS CYNTHIA HAD NOTED BEFORE 
THAT SEGMENTATION MAY NOT MAKE  
THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE IT       

00:34:03.428 --> 00:34:06.663
THAT SEGMENTATION MAY NOT MAKE  
THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE IT       
TRANSCENDS A LOT OF DIFFERENT   

00:34:06.665 --> 00:34:07.130
THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE IT       
TRANSCENDS A LOT OF DIFFERENT   
LAND USE CONTEXTS.              

00:34:07.132 --> 00:34:10.700
TRANSCENDS A LOT OF DIFFERENT   
LAND USE CONTEXTS.              
SPEED CHANGES AND SO WE REALLY  

00:34:10.702 --> 00:34:11.500
LAND USE CONTEXTS.              
SPEED CHANGES AND SO WE REALLY  
WANTED TO EVALUATE THAT IN A    

00:34:11.502 --> 00:34:14.570
SPEED CHANGES AND SO WE REALLY  
WANTED TO EVALUATE THAT IN A    
MUCH DIFFERENT WAY.             

00:34:14.572 --> 00:34:15.504
WANTED TO EVALUATE THAT IN A    
MUCH DIFFERENT WAY.             
AND AGAIN, ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT 

00:34:15.506 --> 00:34:18.441
MUCH DIFFERENT WAY.             
AND AGAIN, ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT 
WE LOOKED AT WAS LIBERTY ROW.   

00:34:18.443 --> 00:34:19.509
AND AGAIN, ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT 
WE LOOKED AT WAS LIBERTY ROW.   
SO WE RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT     

00:34:19.511 --> 00:34:21.978
WE LOOKED AT WAS LIBERTY ROW.   
SO WE RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT     
SEGMENT LENGTH IS FROM THE CITY 

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.712
SO WE RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT     
SEGMENT LENGTH IS FROM THE CITY 
LIMITS ALL THE WAY TO DOWNTOWN  

00:34:22.714 --> 00:34:26.015
SEGMENT LENGTH IS FROM THE CITY 
LIMITS ALL THE WAY TO DOWNTOWN  
ANN ARBOR AND I THINK MANY      

00:34:26.017 --> 00:34:26.749
LIMITS ALL THE WAY TO DOWNTOWN  
ANN ARBOR AND I THINK MANY      
OF US KNOW THAT THAT LAND USE   

00:34:26.751 --> 00:34:29.686
ANN ARBOR AND I THINK MANY      
OF US KNOW THAT THAT LAND USE   
CONTEXT DOES CHANGE THE CLOSER  

00:34:29.688 --> 00:34:30.486
OF US KNOW THAT THAT LAND USE   
CONTEXT DOES CHANGE THE CLOSER  
THAT WE GET TO THE DOWNTOWN     

00:34:30.488 --> 00:34:33.757
CONTEXT DOES CHANGE THE CLOSER  
THAT WE GET TO THE DOWNTOWN     
AREA, THE AREA IN BETWEEN THE   

00:34:33.759 --> 00:34:34.657
THAT WE GET TO THE DOWNTOWN     
AREA, THE AREA IN BETWEEN THE   
CITY LIMITS AND KIND OF THAT    

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.794
AREA, THE AREA IN BETWEEN THE   
CITY LIMITS AND KIND OF THAT    
RING ROAD OF I-95 OR SO WITHIN  

00:34:37.796 --> 00:34:38.595
CITY LIMITS AND KIND OF THAT    
RING ROAD OF I-95 OR SO WITHIN  
THIS NEW EVALUATION WE REALLY   

00:34:38.597 --> 00:34:42.132
RING ROAD OF I-95 OR SO WITHIN  
THIS NEW EVALUATION WE REALLY   
WANTED TO TAKE LAND USE CONTEXT 

00:34:42.134 --> 00:34:45.769
THIS NEW EVALUATION WE REALLY   
WANTED TO TAKE LAND USE CONTEXT 
INTO MUCH MORE CONSIDERATION.   

00:34:45.771 --> 00:34:46.636
WANTED TO TAKE LAND USE CONTEXT 
INTO MUCH MORE CONSIDERATION.   
WE WANTED TO LOOK AT THE        

00:34:46.638 --> 00:34:49.505
INTO MUCH MORE CONSIDERATION.   
WE WANTED TO LOOK AT THE        
ROADWAY CHARACTERISTICS AND     

00:34:49.507 --> 00:34:50.373
WE WANTED TO LOOK AT THE        
ROADWAY CHARACTERISTICS AND     
ALSO THINK ABOUT THE REALITY    

00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:53.843
ROADWAY CHARACTERISTICS AND     
ALSO THINK ABOUT THE REALITY    
OF BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP A      

00:34:53.845 --> 00:34:54.544
ALSO THINK ABOUT THE REALITY    
OF BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP A      
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AND 

00:34:54.546 --> 00:34:58.114
OF BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP A      
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AND 
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS  

00:34:58.116 --> 00:35:00.550
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AND 
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS  
MULTIPLE MILES LONG IS NOT      

00:35:00.552 --> 00:35:01.351
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS  
MULTIPLE MILES LONG IS NOT      
USUALLY HOW MANY CAPITAL        

00:35:01.353 --> 00:35:04.988
MULTIPLE MILES LONG IS NOT      
USUALLY HOW MANY CAPITAL        
PROJECTS ARE DONE SO WE REALLY  

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.921
USUALLY HOW MANY CAPITAL        
PROJECTS ARE DONE SO WE REALLY  
DID TAKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME  

00:35:05.923 --> 00:35:06.790
PROJECTS ARE DONE SO WE REALLY  
DID TAKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME  
WITH OUR OWN STAFF AND WITH OUR 

00:35:06.792 --> 00:35:10.026
DID TAKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME  
WITH OUR OWN STAFF AND WITH OUR 
GUYS PROFESSIONALS TO RE        

00:35:10.028 --> 00:35:12.662
WITH OUR OWN STAFF AND WITH OUR 
GUYS PROFESSIONALS TO RE        
SEGMENT THOSE LENGTHS INTO      

00:35:12.664 --> 00:35:13.462
GUYS PROFESSIONALS TO RE        
SEGMENT THOSE LENGTHS INTO      
SOMETHING MORE MEANINGFUL AND   

00:35:13.464 --> 00:35:20.704
SEGMENT THOSE LENGTHS INTO

00:35:44.796 --> 00:35:51.101
WHY THESE PARTICULAR CORRIDORS

NOW OR WILL IT JUST YOU KNOW,   

00:38:04.569 --> 00:38:11.107
DECISION TO REMOVE THAT SEGMENT 
NOW OR WILL IT JUST YOU KNOW,   
JUST THOUGHTS AROUND THAT       

00:38:11.342 --> 00:38:15.878
                          AND   
SEPTEMBER FORGIVE ME IF I JUMP  
IN AND YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK  

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.579
SEPTEMBER FORGIVE ME IF I JUMP  
IN AND YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK  
THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THIS

00:38:19.851 --> 00:38:23.987
INTERSECTION FROM BEING A FOCUS 
INTERSECTION AT ALL BECAUSE     
THAT HISTO BERKELEY HAS BEEN

INTERSECTION AT ALL BECAUSE     
THAT HISTO BERKELEY HAS BEEN    
WHERE CRASHES HAVE BEEN

00:38:39.737 --> 00:38:43.473
THE WE'RE LOOKING AT CRASHES    
OVER THE LENGTH OF A SEGMENT    
AND SO THE SEGMENT IS VERY,     

00:38:43.475 --> 00:38:44.407
OVER THE LENGTH OF A SEGMENT    
AND SO THE SEGMENT IS VERY,     
VERY SHORT AND BOTH OF THESE    

00:38:44.409 --> 00:38:47.410
AND SO THE SEGMENT IS VERY,     
VERY SHORT AND BOTH OF THESE    
INSTANCES BECAUSE THAT BLOCK TO 

00:38:47.412 --> 00:38:48.210
VERY SHORT AND BOTH OF THESE    
INSTANCES BECAUSE THAT BLOCK TO 
THE NEXT INTERSECTION IS NOT    

00:38:48.212 --> 00:38:54.917

VERY LONG STORY AND WHEN YOU    

00:38:54.919 --> 00:38:55.718
THE NEXT INTERSECTION IS NOT    
VERY LONG STORY AND WHEN YOU    
LOOK AT CRASHES THERE ARE CRASH

VERY LONG STORY AND WHEN YOU    
LOOK AT CRASHES THERE ARE CRASH 
TYPES THAT ARE MORE ASSOCIATED

LOOK AT CRASHES THERE ARE CRASH 
TYPES THAT ARE MORE ASSOCIATED  
WITH THE SEGMENT AND THERE ARE  

00:38:59.156 --> 00:39:02.459
TYPES THAT ARE MORE ASSOCIATED  
WITH THE SEGMENT AND THERE ARE  
STATES THAT ARE MORE ASSOCIATED

00:39:02.994 --> 00:39:05.794
STATES THAT ARE MORE ASSOCIATED 
WITH INTERSECTIONS.             
SO THE SEGMENT HAS NOT BETTER   

00:39:05.796 --> 00:39:06.162
WITH INTERSECTIONS.             
SO THE SEGMENT HAS NOT BETTER   
THROWN AWAY.

SO THE SEGMENT HAS NOT BETTER   
THROWN AWAY.                    
IT'S WHAT WE RAN IT IT SHOWED

IT'S WHAT WE RAN IT IT SHOWED   
UP AS BEING A TIER LOCATION AND 
THE TEAM SAID WELL THIS LOOKS A

THAT THEY WERE NOT CRASHES THAT 
WERE HAPPENING AS A RESULT      
OF CORRIDOR DYNAMICS BUT IT WAS
