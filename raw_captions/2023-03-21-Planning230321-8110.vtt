FOR THAT.                       
WE ARE CURRENTLY STUDYING SOLAR 
THE THE WE DON&apos;T WANT TO BUT    

00:45:16.702 --> 00:45:17.502
WE ARE CURRENTLY STUDYING SOLAR 
THE THE WE DON&apos;T WANT TO BUT    
SOLAR ON THE GROUND BECAUSE     

00:45:17.504 --> 00:45:18.102
THE THE WE DON&apos;T WANT TO BUT    
SOLAR ON THE GROUND BECAUSE     
IT&apos;S NOT PRACTICAL WOULD TAKE   

00:45:18.104 --> 00:45:21.505
SOLAR ON THE GROUND BECAUSE     
IT&apos;S NOT PRACTICAL WOULD TAKE   
UP GROUND SPACE VERY SMALL      

00:45:21.507 --> 00:45:22.372
IT&apos;S NOT PRACTICAL WOULD TAKE   
UP GROUND SPACE VERY SMALL      
ROOFLINE AND THERE&apos;S A LOT      

00:45:22.374 --> 00:45:25.043
UP GROUND SPACE VERY SMALL      
ROOFLINE AND THERE&apos;S A LOT      
OF TREES IN THERE SO IT&apos;S NOT A

ROOFLINE AND THERE&apos;S A LOT      
OF TREES IN THERE SO IT&apos;S NOT A 
EXTREMELY POPULAR OR PRACTICAL  

00:45:28.481 --> 00:45:29.013
OF TREES IN THERE SO IT&apos;S NOT A 
EXTREMELY POPULAR OR PRACTICAL  
PLACE FOR SOLAR.                

00:45:29.015 --> 00:45:29.681
EXTREMELY POPULAR OR PRACTICAL  
PLACE FOR SOLAR.                
WE ARE STUDYING IT.             

00:45:29.683 --> 00:45:32.483
PLACE FOR SOLAR.                
WE ARE STUDYING IT.             
WE WOULD POTENTIALLY MAKE       

00:45:32.485 --> 00:45:33.084
WE ARE STUDYING IT.             
WE WOULD POTENTIALLY MAKE       
AVAILABLE FOR THE FUTURE.       

00:45:33.086 --> 00:45:36.653
WE WOULD POTENTIALLY MAKE       
AVAILABLE FOR THE FUTURE.       
WE DID DO A RUDIMENTARY FITA    

00:45:36.655 --> 00:45:40.458
AVAILABLE FOR THE FUTURE.       
WE DID DO A RUDIMENTARY FITA    
FEASIBILITY STUDY ON ELECTRIC.  

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.525
WE DID DO A RUDIMENTARY FITA    
FEASIBILITY STUDY ON ELECTRIC.  
IT WOULD ADD SEVERAL THOUSAND   

00:45:41.527 --> 00:45:44.795
FEASIBILITY STUDY ON ELECTRIC.  
IT WOULD ADD SEVERAL THOUSAND   
DOLLARS TO EACH UNIT TO MAKE    

00:45:44.797 --> 00:45:45.463
IT WOULD ADD SEVERAL THOUSAND   
DOLLARS TO EACH UNIT TO MAKE    
FURNACES ELECTRIC AND WATER     

00:45:45.465 --> 00:45:47.898
DOLLARS TO EACH UNIT TO MAKE    
FURNACES ELECTRIC AND WATER     
HEATERS ELECTRIC.               

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.766
FURNACES ELECTRIC AND WATER     
HEATERS ELECTRIC.               
BUT THAT&apos;S NOT THE CONCERN AS   

00:45:48.768 --> 00:45:51.569
HEATERS ELECTRIC.               
BUT THAT&apos;S NOT THE CONCERN AS   
MUCH THE CONCERN IS PASSING     

00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:52.570
BUT THAT&apos;S NOT THE CONCERN AS   
MUCH THE CONCERN IS PASSING     
THAT COST ON TO THE CONSUMER TO 

00:45:52.572 --> 00:45:56.040
MUCH THE CONCERN IS PASSING     
THAT COST ON TO THE CONSUMER TO 
OPERATE A MUCH MORE INEFFICIENT 

00:45:56.042 --> 00:45:57.008
THAT COST ON TO THE CONSUMER TO 
OPERATE A MUCH MORE INEFFICIENT 
SYSTEM IN TERMS OF COST FROM AN 

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:59.877
OPERATE A MUCH MORE INEFFICIENT

ELECTRIC SYSTEM.                

00:45:59.879 --> 00:46:00.712
SYSTEM IN TERMS OF COST FROM AN 
ELECTRIC SYSTEM.                
SO WHICH SHOULD BE NOTICED HERE 

00:46:00.714 --> 00:46:03.147
ELECTRIC SYSTEM.                
SO WHICH SHOULD BE NOTICED HERE 
IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS        

00:46:03.149 --> 00:46:03.914
SO WHICH SHOULD BE NOTICED HERE 
IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS        
PRODUCT THESE ARE NOT SINGLE    

00:46:03.916 --> 00:46:06.851
IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS        
PRODUCT THESE ARE NOT SINGLE    
FAMILY HOMES SO THEY ARE WELL   

00:46:06.853 --> 00:46:07.718
PRODUCT THESE ARE NOT SINGLE    
FAMILY HOMES SO THEY ARE WELL   
INSULATED THE HOMES BACK ON TO  

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.188
FAMILY HOMES SO THEY ARE WELL   
INSULATED THE HOMES BACK ON TO  
ANOTHER HEATED UNIT THERE THREE 

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.489
INSULATED THE HOMES BACK ON TO  
ANOTHER HEATED UNIT THERE THREE 
STOREY.

ANOTHER HEATED UNIT THERE THREE 
STOREY.                         
SO THERE&apos;S YOU KNOW, THE HEAT   

00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:15.192
STOREY.                         
SO THERE&apos;S YOU KNOW, THE HEAT   
WILL RISE SO THERE WOULD BE     

00:46:15.194 --> 00:46:18.429
SO THERE&apos;S YOU KNOW, THE HEAT   
WILL RISE SO THERE WOULD BE     
LESS HEAT GENERATED FROM THESE  

00:46:18.431 --> 00:46:19.596
WILL RISE SO THERE WOULD BE     
LESS HEAT GENERATED FROM THESE  
UNITS, LESS FURNACE USE THAN A

00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:00.403
THINGS SO IT&apos;S NOT JUST THE     
COMMUTING EMISSIONS BUT IT&apos;S    
ALSO THE WITHIN TOWN KIND       

00:52:00.405 --> 00:52:03.473
COMMUTING EMISSIONS BUT IT&apos;S    
ALSO THE WITHIN TOWN KIND       
OF RUNNING ERRANDS THAT ARE     

00:52:03.475 --> 00:52:03.974
ALSO THE WITHIN TOWN KIND

REALLY CAR DEPENDENT.           

00:52:03.976 --> 00:52:06.777
OF RUNNING ERRANDS THAT ARE     
REALLY CAR DEPENDENT.           
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE&apos;S     

00:52:06.779 --> 00:52:07.711
REALLY CAR DEPENDENT.           
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE&apos;S     
SOMEDAY THIS WILL BE ALL        

00:52:07.713 --> 00:52:08.178
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE&apos;S     
SOMEDAY THIS WILL BE ALL        
ELECTRIC.                       

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.747
SOMEDAY THIS WILL BE ALL        
ELECTRIC.                       
IT WILL NEED TO BE JUST TO MAKE

00:54:48.874 --> 00:54:51.674
IS I WOULD BE I CAN&apos;T SPEAK TO  
THE TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY BUT    
BASED ON A VOLUME OF THE NUMBER

TOWARDS THE BUILDING PERMIT     
PROCESS.                        
I THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT           

01:00:06.858 --> 01:00:09.725
PROCESS.                        
I THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT           
OF INNOVATION IN TAX TAX        

01:00:09.727 --> 01:00:13.996
I THINK THERE&apos;S A LOT           
OF INNOVATION IN TAX TAX        
CAPTURE FOR INCENTIVES AND I    

01:00:13.998 --> 01:00:14.931
OF INNOVATION IN TAX TAX        
CAPTURE FOR INCENTIVES AND I    
WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT THE 

01:00:14.933 --> 01:00:17.200
CAPTURE FOR INCENTIVES AND I    
WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT THE 
HOUSING TYPE YOU HAVE SEEMS     

01:00:17.202 --> 01:00:17.800
WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT THE 
HOUSING TYPE YOU HAVE SEEMS     
PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED        

01:00:17.802 --> 01:00:20.870
HOUSING TYPE YOU HAVE SEEMS     
PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED        
ACTUALLY TO BE ABLE TO BECAUSE  

01:00:20.872 --> 01:00:21.538
PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED        
ACTUALLY TO BE ABLE TO BECAUSE  
ALL THESE UNITS THEN ALL NEXT   

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:25.008
ACTUALLY TO BE ABLE TO BECAUSE  
ALL THESE UNITS THEN ALL NEXT   
TO EACH OTHER ARE ACTUALLY IT&apos;S 

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.542
ALL THESE UNITS THEN ALL NEXT   
TO EACH OTHER ARE ACTUALLY IT&apos;S 
NOT A HIGH RISE.                

01:00:25.544 --> 01:00:26.642
TO EACH OTHER ARE ACTUALLY IT&apos;S 
NOT A HIGH RISE.                
SO IT&apos;S VERY DIFFERENT IN THAT  

01:00:26.644 --> 01:00:27.844
NOT A HIGH RISE.                
SO IT&apos;S VERY DIFFERENT IN THAT  
WAY.                            

01:00:27.846 --> 01:00:29.011
SO IT&apos;S VERY DIFFERENT IN THAT  
WAY.                            
IT&apos;S REALLY SET UP WELL TO BE   

01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:29.713
WAY.                            
IT&apos;S REALLY SET UP WELL TO BE   
ABLE TO HANDLE ELECTRIFICATION  

01:00:29.715 --> 01:00:32.649
IT&apos;S REALLY SET UP WELL TO BE   
ABLE TO HANDLE ELECTRIFICATION  
AND IF YOU CAN DO THE SOLAR     

01:00:32.651 --> 01:00:35.785
ABLE TO HANDLE ELECTRIFICATION  
AND IF YOU CAN DO THE SOLAR     
THEN AND YOU&apos;RE RENTING THAT    

01:00:35.787 --> 01:00:36.453
AND IF YOU CAN DO THE SOLAR     
THEN AND YOU&apos;RE RENTING THAT    
PAYS FOR ITSELF OVER TIME.      

01:00:36.455 --> 01:00:39.655
THEN AND YOU&apos;RE RENTING THAT    
PAYS FOR ITSELF OVER TIME.      
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER PIECE OF THE  

01:00:39.657 --> 01:00:40.557
PAYS FOR ITSELF OVER TIME.      
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER PIECE OF THE  
PUZZLE TO THINK ABOUT AS YOU&apos;RE 

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:41.357
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER PIECE OF THE

01:00:44.496 --> 01:00:47.263
WITH THE 30 PERCENT REBATE THAT

ITERATION THE DENSITY PER SAY   
IS NOT THE ISSUE AT THE SITE.   

01:08:48.145 --> 01:08:49.212
ITERATION THE DENSITY PER SAY   
IS NOT THE ISSUE AT THE SITE.   
I THINK WE ALL AGREE THE SITE   

01:08:49.214 --> 01:08:55.385
IS NOT THE ISSUE AT THE SITE.   
I THINK WE ALL AGREE THE SITE   
COULD USE

01:09:10.168 --> 01:09:10.933
ABOVE AND BEYOND THE MASTER

BUT REALLY THE ISSUE IS THE     

01:09:10.935 --> 01:09:11.534
PLAN OR THE EXISTING ZONING.    
BUT REALLY THE ISSUE IS THE     
SIZE OF THE STRUCTURE, THE      

01:09:11.536 --> 01:09:12.334
BUT REALLY THE ISSUE IS THE     
SIZE OF THE STRUCTURE, THE      
MASSING IN THE HEIGHT OF THE

AS WELL AS SOME GROUP HOUSING.  
IN ADDITION TO THAT, CO-OPS IN  
A COUPLE OF OTHER MULTIFAMILY   

01:09:17.208 --> 01:09:18.007
IN ADDITION TO THAT, CO-OPS IN  
A COUPLE OF OTHER MULTIFAMILY   
STRUCTURES THEY ARE OF VARIOUS  

01:09:18.009 --> 01:09:18.541
A COUPLE OF OTHER MULTIFAMILY

01:09:20.011 --> 01:09:20.676
HOWEVER, NOTHING DOES APPROACH  
THE SCALE OF THIS PROJECT.      
SO AGAIN THE ADDITIONAL DENSITY 

01:09:20.678 --> 01:09:21.544
THE SCALE OF THIS PROJECT.      
SO AGAIN THE ADDITIONAL DENSITY 
DOES APPEAR REASONABLE OVER THE

SO AGAIN THE ADDITIONAL DENSITY 
DOES APPEAR REASONABLE OVER THE 
CURRENT PROJECTIONS WITHIN THE

&gt;&gt; RIGHT.                       
SO THE FIRST THING IS IS THERE  
ANOTHER ZONING DISTRICT THAT    

02:04:59.013 --> 02:04:59.812
SO THE FIRST THING IS IS THERE  
ANOTHER ZONING DISTRICT THAT    
WHERE THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED?   

02:04:59.814 --> 02:05:03.282
ANOTHER ZONING DISTRICT THAT    
WHERE THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED?   
AND I THINK THAT WHAT&apos;S BEEN

WOULDN&apos;T BE VIABLE AND ONE IS   
IT DOES EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT 

02:05:11.659 --> 02:05:12.591
WOULDN&apos;T BE VIABLE AND ONE IS   
IT DOES EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT 
JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THERE WAS

IT DOES EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT 
JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THERE WAS

THINK THE IDEA THAT THIS IS     
EXTENDING THAT AREA TO ME IT&apos;S  
BETTER THAT THERE CONSISTENCY   

02:05:29.678 --> 02:05:30.743

BASE FLOOR AREA RATIO IS FOUR   

02:05:53.234 --> 02:05:54.033
DEVELOPED BECAUSE THE D ONE     
BASE FLOOR AREA RATIO IS FOUR   
HUNDRED PERCENT SO TO GET UP TO

&gt;&gt; WELL THAT&apos;S HOW THE NUMBERS

&gt;&gt; OK SO SO I THINK THAT&apos;S I    
MEAN NOW IT SEE LIKE YOU&apos;RE     

02:07:08.042 --> 02:07:11.310
&gt;&gt; OK SO SO I THINK THAT&apos;S I    
MEAN NOW IT SEE LIKE YOU&apos;RE     
JOKING I THINK THAT&apos;S A         

02:07:11.312 --> 02:07:12.044
MEAN NOW IT SEE LIKE YOU&apos;RE     
JOKING I THINK THAT&apos;S A         
COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO THINGS 

02:07:12.046 --> 02:07:15.080
JOKING I THINK THAT&apos;S A         
COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO THINGS 
BUT I&apos;M STILL WOULD JUST SAY    

02:07:15.082 --> 02:07:18.550
COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO THINGS 
BUT I&apos;M STILL WOULD JUST SAY    
THAT IT&apos;S A DIFFERENT BAR IF    

02:07:18.552 --> 02:07:19.619
BUT I&apos;M STILL WOULD JUST SAY    
THAT IT&apos;S A DIFFERENT BAR IF    
THAT WERE IF IT WERE DONE.      

02:07:19.621 --> 02:07:20.753
THAT IT&apos;S A DIFFERENT BAR IF    
THAT WERE IF IT WERE DONE.      
SO THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK 

02:07:20.755 --> 02:07:22.621
THAT WERE IF IT WERE DONE.      
SO THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK 
ABOUT IN MY MIND THIS IS TRYING 

02:07:22.623 --> 02:07:25.958
SO THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK 
ABOUT IN MY MIND THIS IS TRYING 
TO ACHIEVE D ONE WITHOUT BEING  

02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:29.595
ABOUT IN MY MIND THIS IS TRYING 
TO ACHIEVE D ONE WITHOUT BEING  
IN D ONE WHICH I DON&apos;T TOTALLY  

02:07:29.597 --> 02:07:30.529
TO ACHIEVE D ONE WITHOUT BEING  
IN D ONE WHICH I DON&apos;T TOTALLY  
LOVE BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT    

02:07:30.531 --> 02:07:33.999
IN D ONE WHICH I DON&apos;T TOTALLY  
LOVE BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT    
THAT DISTRICT AND HOW WE&apos;RE     

02:07:34.001 --> 02:07:34.733
LOVE BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT    
THAT DISTRICT AND HOW WE&apos;RE     
THINKING ABOUT EXPANDING THIS   

02:07:34.735 --> 02:07:37.536
THAT DISTRICT AND HOW WE&apos;RE     
THINKING ABOUT EXPANDING THIS   
AS WHAT&apos;S HAPPENING IN THAT IN  

02:07:37.538 --> 02:07:38.737
THINKING ABOUT EXPANDING THIS   
AS WHAT&apos;S HAPPENING IN THAT IN  
THE SOUTH YOU AREA IS OF THAT   

02:07:38.739 --> 02:07:41.741
AS WHAT&apos;S HAPPENING IN THAT IN  
THE SOUTH YOU AREA IS OF THAT   
DISTRICT.                       

02:07:41.743 --> 02:07:42.875
THE SOUTH YOU AREA IS OF THAT   
DISTRICT.                       
SO THEN I THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT 

02:07:42.877 --> 02:07:43.543
DISTRICT.                       
SO THEN I THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT 
ARE THE BENEFITS THAT ARE       

02:07:43.545 --> 02:07:44.677
SO THEN I THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT 
ARE THE BENEFITS THAT ARE       
ACTUALLY PUT ON THE TABLE AND   

02:07:44.679 --> 02:07:45.644
ARE THE BENEFITS THAT ARE       
ACTUALLY PUT ON THE TABLE AND   
ARE THEY COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT 

02:07:45.646 --> 02:07:49.082
ACTUALLY PUT ON THE TABLE AND   
ARE THEY COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT 
IS BEING ASKED OF EXCEEDING     

02:07:49.084 --> 02:07:52.718
ARE THEY COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT 
IS BEING ASKED OF EXCEEDING     
KIND OF OF THIS REZONING?       

02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:53.853
IS BEING ASKED OF EXCEEDING     
KIND OF OF THIS REZONING?       
AND SO AGAIN ON THE AFFORDABLE  

02:07:53.855 --> 02:07:54.653
KIND OF OF THIS REZONING?       
AND SO AGAIN ON THE AFFORDABLE  
HOUSING SIDE YOU CAN COUNT IT   

02:07:54.655 --> 02:07:57.390
AND SO AGAIN ON THE AFFORDABLE  
HOUSING SIDE YOU CAN COUNT IT   
EITHER WAY YOU CAN COUNT AT THE 

02:07:57.392 --> 02:07:58.290
HOUSING SIDE YOU CAN COUNT IT   
EITHER WAY YOU CAN COUNT AT THE 
YOU CAN COUNT AT THE FOUR POINT 

02:07:58.292 --> 02:08:01.326
EITHER WAY YOU CAN COUNT AT THE

THAT THE PVD IS PARTICULARLY    
HELPFUL AND A LOT OF THE        

02:08:43.671 --> 02:08:44.470
THAT THE PVD IS PARTICULARLY    
HELPFUL AND A LOT OF THE        
FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR 

02:08:44.472 --> 02:08:45.271
HELPFUL AND A LOT OF THE        
FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR 
CODE IS WHEN WE HAVE UNIQUE     

02:08:45.273 --> 02:08:47.406
FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR 
CODE IS WHEN WE HAVE UNIQUE     
SITES WHERE THERE&apos;S SOMETHING   

02:08:47.408 --> 02:08:48.074
CODE IS WHEN WE HAVE UNIQUE     
SITES WHERE THERE&apos;S SOMETHING   
THAT&apos;S REALLY IMPORTANT TO      

02:08:48.076 --> 02:08:51.910
SITES WHERE THERE&apos;S SOMETHING   
THAT&apos;S REALLY IMPORTANT TO      
PROTECT AND I AM NOT THE TREE   

02:08:51.912 --> 02:08:54.947
THAT&apos;S REALLY IMPORTANT TO      
PROTECT AND I AM NOT THE TREE   
PERSON IS THERE.                

02:08:54.949 --> 02:08:56.015
PROTECT AND I AM NOT THE TREE   
PERSON IS THERE.                
&gt;&gt; BUT WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS I 

02:08:56.017 --> 02:08:59.618
PERSON IS THERE.                
&gt;&gt; BUT WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS I 
THINK THE THE AND I&apos;LL DEFER TO 

02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:02.955
&gt;&gt; BUT WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS I 
THINK THE THE AND I&apos;LL DEFER TO 
OTHER PEOPLE IT IS THINKING     

02:09:02.957 --> 02:09:03.656
THINK THE THE AND I&apos;LL DEFER TO 
OTHER PEOPLE IT IS THINKING     
ABOUT THE NORTHERN PROPERTY     

02:09:03.658 --> 02:09:07.326
OTHER PEOPLE IT IS THINKING     
ABOUT THE NORTHERN PROPERTY     
BOUNDARY AND THE LOVELY GROVE   

02:09:07.328 --> 02:09:10.963
ABOUT THE NORTHERN PROPERTY     
BOUNDARY AND THE LOVELY GROVE   
OF TREES THAT ARE THERE.        

02:09:10.965 --> 02:09:12.031
BOUNDARY AND THE LOVELY GROVE   
OF TREES THAT ARE THERE.        
&gt;&gt; WHAT STRIKES ME IS THAT THE  

02:09:12.033 --> 02:09:14.634
OF TREES THAT ARE THERE.        
&gt;&gt; WHAT STRIKES ME IS THAT THE  
PROPOSED ZONING ACTUALLY        

02:09:14.636 --> 02:09:15.368
&gt;&gt; WHAT STRIKES ME IS THAT THE  
PROPOSED ZONING ACTUALLY        
ENCROACHES AND ENCROACHES ON    

02:09:15.370 --> 02:09:19.271

02:09:19.941 --> 02:09:23.275

SO THE NORTH PROPERTY THAT BACK 

02:09:23.277 --> 02:09:24.009
IN IN OUR FOURTH DISTRICT.      
SO THE NORTH PROPERTY THAT BACK 
IS TEN FEET WHERE WHAT WOULD BE 

02:09:24.011 --> 02:09:27.013

02:24:09.229 --> 02:24:12.931
THAT&apos;S FINE TEAM MEMBERS TO     
BEGIN TO WHITTLE THROUGH THEM   
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE

BEGIN TO WHITTLE THROUGH THEM   
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE 
COMMISSIONER NILS STATEMENT     

02:24:15.936 --> 02:24:16.734
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE 
COMMISSIONER NILS STATEMENT     
ABOUT THE UNIQUENESS OF THE     

02:24:16.736 --> 02:24:20.238
COMMISSIONER NILS STATEMENT     
ABOUT THE UNIQUENESS OF THE     
SITE IN THIS CLEARLY GOES TO    

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:20.972
ABOUT THE UNIQUENESS OF THE     
SITE IN THIS CLEARLY GOES TO    
THE URBAN FOREST FRAGMENT THAT  

02:24:20.974 --> 02:24:24.242
SITE IN THIS CLEARLY GOES TO    
THE URBAN FOREST FRAGMENT THAT  
IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR AND WE HAVE  

02:24:24.244 --> 02:24:27.545
THE URBAN FOREST FRAGMENT THAT  
IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR AND WE HAVE  
CRAFTED A DESIGN TO HAVE THE    

02:24:27.547 --> 02:24:30.815
IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR AND WE HAVE  
CRAFTED A DESIGN TO HAVE THE    
LEAST POSSIBLE IMPACTS ON THAT  

02:24:30.817 --> 02:24:31.549
CRAFTED A DESIGN TO HAVE THE    
LEAST POSSIBLE IMPACTS ON THAT  
AND THAT VERY VALUABLE          

02:24:31.551 --> 02:24:34.820
LEAST POSSIBLE IMPACTS ON THAT  
AND THAT VERY VALUABLE          
COMMUNITY RESOURCE WE HAVE DONE 

02:24:34.822 --> 02:24:35.787
AND THAT VERY VALUABLE          
COMMUNITY RESOURCE WE HAVE DONE 
STUDIES AND WE&apos;VE HIRED THE     

02:24:35.789 --> 02:24:39.257
COMMUNITY RESOURCE WE HAVE DONE 
STUDIES AND WE&apos;VE HIRED THE     
FORMER CITY FORESTER BILL       

02:24:39.259 --> 02:24:39.891
STUDIES AND WE&apos;VE HIRED THE     
FORMER CITY FORESTER BILL       
LAWRENCE WHO&apos;S DONE AN          

02:24:39.893 --> 02:24:43.395
FORMER CITY FORESTER BILL       
LAWRENCE WHO&apos;S DONE AN          
EXTENSIVE MULTI MONTH STUDY AND 

02:24:43.397 --> 02:24:46.932
LAWRENCE WHO&apos;S DONE AN          
EXTENSIVE MULTI MONTH STUDY AND 
RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS 

02:24:46.934 --> 02:24:47.866
EXTENSIVE MULTI MONTH STUDY AND 
RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS 
OF HOW WE ORGANIZE THE MASS     

02:24:47.868 --> 02:24:48.600
RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS 
OF HOW WE ORGANIZE THE MASS     
OF OUR BUILDING AND THE SITE    

02:24:48.602 --> 02:24:51.169
OF HOW WE ORGANIZE THE MASS     
OF OUR BUILDING AND THE SITE    
WOULD HAVE ON THOSE TREES.      

02:24:51.171 --> 02:24:52.437
OF OUR BUILDING AND THE SITE    
WOULD HAVE ON THOSE TREES.      
SO PART OF WHAT WE DID IS FOR   

02:24:52.439 --> 02:24:55.440
WOULD HAVE ON THOSE TREES.      
SO PART OF WHAT WE DID IS FOR   
THE LAST MAJORITY THE LENGTH    

02:24:55.442 --> 02:24:56.508
SO PART OF WHAT WE DID IS FOR   
THE LAST MAJORITY THE LENGTH    
OF OUR SITE IS WE PUT A 15 FOOT 

02:24:56.510 --> 02:24:59.444
THE LAST MAJORITY THE LENGTH    
OF OUR SITE IS WE PUT A 15 FOOT 
GREEN BUFFER ZONE ALONG OUR     

02:24:59.446 --> 02:25:00.211
OF OUR SITE IS WE PUT A 15 FOOT 
GREEN BUFFER ZONE ALONG OUR     
NORTHERN PROPERTY LINE SO THAT  

02:25:00.213 --> 02:25:03.148
GREEN BUFFER ZONE ALONG OUR     
NORTHERN PROPERTY LINE SO THAT  
WERE NOT IMPACTING ROUTE ZONES  

02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:03.948
NORTHERN PROPERTY LINE SO THAT  
WERE NOT IMPACTING ROUTE ZONES  
SIGNIFICANTLY OF THOSE LARGER   

02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:06.250
WERE NOT IMPACTING ROUTE ZONES  
SIGNIFICANTLY OF THOSE LARGER   
MATURE TREES.                   

02:25:06.252 --> 02:25:07.285
SIGNIFICANTLY OF THOSE LARGER   
MATURE TREES.                   
AND THEN WE ALSO AS YOU RECALL  

02:25:07.287 --> 02:25:10.655
MATURE TREES.                   
AND THEN WE ALSO AS YOU RECALL  
IN OUR WORKING SESSION WE HAD A 

02:25:10.657 --> 02:25:11.256
AND THEN WE ALSO AS YOU RECALL  
IN OUR WORKING SESSION WE HAD A 
UNIFORM HEIGHT BUILDING.        

02:25:11.258 --> 02:25:14.659
IN OUR WORKING SESSION WE HAD A 
UNIFORM HEIGHT BUILDING.        
WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT THOSE SHADE 

02:25:14.661 --> 02:25:15.460
UNIFORM HEIGHT BUILDING.        
WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT THOSE SHADE 
AND SHADOW STUDIES AND IT WAS   

02:25:15.462 --> 02:25:18.263
WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT THOSE SHADE 
AND SHADOW STUDIES AND IT WAS   
CLEAR THAT WE COULD ALLOW A     

02:25:18.265 --> 02:25:19.064
AND SHADOW STUDIES AND IT WAS   
CLEAR THAT WE COULD ALLOW A     
LITTLE MORE AFTERNOON SUN ONTO  

02:25:19.066 --> 02:25:22.200
CLEAR THAT WE COULD ALLOW A     
LITTLE MORE AFTERNOON SUN ONTO  
THOSE TREES BY DROPPING THE     

02:25:22.202 --> 02:25:23.000
LITTLE MORE AFTERNOON SUN ONTO  
THOSE TREES BY DROPPING THE     
NORTH WEST CORNER OF OUR        

02:25:23.002 --> 02:25:25.770
THOSE TREES BY DROPPING THE     
NORTH WEST CORNER OF OUR        
BUILDING SIX STOREYS TO ACCOUNT 

02:25:25.772 --> 02:25:29.341
NORTH WEST CORNER OF OUR        
BUILDING SIX STOREYS TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE LOSS OF THAT DENSITY    

02:25:29.343 --> 02:25:30.008
BUILDING SIX STOREYS TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE LOSS OF THAT DENSITY    
THE THE REST OF THE MASS.       

02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:33.345
FOR THE LOSS OF THAT DENSITY    
THE THE REST OF THE MASS.       
BUT BY DOING THAT WE LOOKED SO  

02:25:33.347 --> 02:25:34.145
THE THE REST OF THE MASS.       
BUT BY DOING THAT WE LOOKED SO  
MUCH MORE SUNLIGHT, ESPECIALLY  

02:25:34.147 --> 02:25:34.880
BUT BY DOING THAT WE LOOKED SO  
MUCH MORE SUNLIGHT, ESPECIALLY  
THE LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT     

02:25:34.882 --> 02:25:36.180
MUCH MORE SUNLIGHT, ESPECIALLY  
THE LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT     
INTO THOSE.                     

02:25:36.182 --> 02:25:37.415
THE LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT     
INTO THOSE.                     
SO THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST   

02:25:37.417 --> 02:25:39.984
INTO THOSE.                     
SO THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST   
UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT THE SITE    

02:25:39.986 --> 02:25:40.918
SO THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST   
UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT THE SITE    
OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTEXT IN THE   

02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:41.586
UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT THE SITE    
OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTEXT IN THE   
AREA WHERE THERE ARE ALREADY    

02:25:41.588 --> 02:25:44.656
OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTEXT IN THE   
AREA WHERE THERE ARE ALREADY    
OTHER TALL BUILDINGS IS THAT WE 

02:25:44.658 --> 02:25:48.159
AREA WHERE THERE ARE ALREADY    
OTHER TALL BUILDINGS IS THAT WE 
HAVE AN URBAN FOREST NEXT YEAR  

02:25:48.161 --> 02:25:49.327
OTHER TALL BUILDINGS IS THAT WE 
HAVE AN URBAN FOREST NEXT YEAR  
OR SO WE DON&apos;T WANT TO PROTECT  

02:25:49.329 --> 02:25:50.028
HAVE AN URBAN FOREST NEXT YEAR  
OR SO WE DON&apos;T WANT TO PROTECT  
IT AND SO WE&apos;VE CRAFTED THE

QUITE COMPLEX NOW WE DID        
ACTUALLY STUDY THE ROOFTOP AREA 
FOR ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY 

02:26:49.456 --> 02:26:53.792
ACTUALLY STUDY THE ROOFTOP AREA 
FOR ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY 
ON SITE THERE HAS TO BE         

02:26:53.794 --> 02:26:54.659
FOR ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY 
ON SITE THERE HAS TO BE         
BALANCED OUT WITH ALSO WHAT WE  

02:26:54.661 --> 02:26:57.295
ON SITE THERE HAS TO BE         
BALANCED OUT WITH ALSO WHAT WE  
ARE DOING WITH WHAT WE&apos;RE

ARE DOING WITH WHAT WE&apos;RE       
SERVING THE BUILDING BECAUSE WE 

02:26:58.165 --> 02:27:00.899
ARE DOING WITH WHAT WE&apos;RE       
SERVING THE BUILDING BECAUSE WE 
ALSO HAVE TO USE THE BUILDING   

02:27:00.901 --> 02:27:01.833
SERVING THE BUILDING BECAUSE WE 
ALSO HAVE TO USE THE BUILDING   
FOR MECHANICAL UNIT AIR INTAKE. 

02:27:01.835 --> 02:27:05.670
ALSO HAVE TO USE THE BUILDING   
FOR MECHANICAL UNIT AIR INTAKE. 
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY AC SYSTEM AS 

02:27:05.672 --> 02:27:06.003
FOR MECHANICAL UNIT AIR INTAKE. 
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY AC SYSTEM AS 
WELL.                           

02:27:06.005 --> 02:27:08.340
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY AC SYSTEM AS 
WELL.                           
SO WE ARE STUDYING THAT THERE   

02:27:08.342 --> 02:27:09.140
WELL.                           
SO WE ARE STUDYING THAT THERE   
CURRENTLY WHAT WE&apos;RE PROPOSING  

02:27:09.142 --> 02:27:09.808
SO WE ARE STUDYING THAT THERE   
CURRENTLY WHAT WE&apos;RE PROPOSING  
AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE ALREADY    

02:27:09.810 --> 02:27:13.043
CURRENTLY WHAT WE&apos;RE PROPOSING  
AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE ALREADY    
EXPANDED A LITTLE BIT MORE TO   

02:27:13.045 --> 02:27:13.878
AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE ALREADY    
EXPANDED A LITTLE BIT MORE TO   
THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR PANELS THAT 

02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:16.614
EXPANDED A LITTLE BIT MORE TO   
THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR PANELS THAT 
WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT TO ACTUALLY 

02:27:16.616 --> 02:27:20.318
THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR PANELS THAT 
WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT TO ACTUALLY 
FIT ON A FOOTPRINT SO THAT THAT 

02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:21.118
WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT TO ACTUALLY 
FIT ON A FOOTPRINT SO THAT THAT 
THAT&apos;S WHERE WE ARE AT.         

02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:23.687
FIT ON A FOOTPRINT SO THAT THAT 
THAT&apos;S WHERE WE ARE AT.         
SCOTT, DO YOU HAVE ANY I WAS

MIDWESTERN CONSULTING.          
GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN.      
I ALSO WANT TO JUST ADD THAT    

02:27:32.165 --> 02:27:35.666
GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN.      
I ALSO WANT TO JUST ADD THAT    
THE EXISTING SITE HAS NO        

02:27:35.668 --> 02:27:36.401
I ALSO WANT TO JUST ADD THAT    
THE EXISTING SITE HAS NO        
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM    

02:27:36.403 --> 02:27:36.868
THE EXISTING SITE HAS NO        
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM    
AND WE&apos;RE PUTTING IN            

02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:39.270
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM    
AND WE&apos;RE PUTTING IN            
UNDERGROUND DETENTION AND       

02:27:39.272 --> 02:27:39.937
AND WE&apos;RE PUTTING IN            
UNDERGROUND DETENTION AND       
GETTING FULL INFILTRATION.      

02:27:39.939 --> 02:27:40.805
UNDERGROUND DETENTION AND       
GETTING FULL INFILTRATION.      
BUT THE RATE OF INFILTRATION    

02:27:40.807 --> 02:27:43.941
GETTING FULL INFILTRATION.      
BUT THE RATE OF INFILTRATION    
WASN&apos;T GREAT AS WE LIKED IT.    

02:27:43.943 --> 02:27:44.709
BUT THE RATE OF INFILTRATION    
WASN&apos;T GREAT AS WE LIKED IT.

03:51:44.245 --> 03:51:44.644
&gt;&gt; THIS IS PART WHERE I NEED TO 
TURN AROUND AND SAY WHY THAT    
MATTERS.                        

03:51:44.646 --> 03:51:45.644
TURN AROUND AND SAY WHY THAT

CEILINGS IN THE HEIGHT OF THE   

03:51:53.387 --> 03:51:56.422
COULD SUPPORT WHICH SHRUNK THE  
CEILINGS IN THE HEIGHT OF THE   
HALLWAYS THAT BECAME            

03:51:56.424 --> 03:51:57.123
CEILINGS IN THE HEIGHT OF THE   
HALLWAYS THAT BECAME            
UNCOMFORTABLE AND I&apos;LL LET YOU  

03:51:57.125 --> 03:51:57.890
HALLWAYS THAT BECAME            
UNCOMFORTABLE AND I&apos;LL LET YOU  
TALK MORE ABOUT THAT PIECE      

03:51:57.892 --> 03:51:59.325
UNCOMFORTABLE AND I&apos;LL LET YOU  
TALK MORE ABOUT THAT PIECE

&gt;&gt; YOU DON&apos;T NEED ME.           
YOU&apos;VE GOT TO.                  
SO WE HAD TO REMOVE SOMETHING   

03:52:04.199 --> 03:52:04.964
YOU&apos;VE GOT TO.                  
SO WE HAD TO REMOVE SOMETHING   
THAT WAS A FEATURE FOR THE      

03:52:04.966 --> 03:52:07.633
SO WE HAD TO REMOVE SOMETHING   
THAT WAS A FEATURE FOR THE      
TENANTS THAT WE REALLY WERE     

03:52:07.635 --> 03:52:08.367
THAT WAS A FEATURE FOR THE      
TENANTS THAT WE REALLY WERE     
EXCITED AND LIKED BECAUSE       

03:52:08.369 --> 03:52:11.171
TENANTS THAT WE REALLY WERE     
EXCITED AND LIKED BECAUSE       
OF THAT.                        

03:52:11.173 --> 03:52:12.371
EXCITED AND LIKED BECAUSE       
OF THAT.                        
SO THERE WERE MANY MORE THINGS  

03:52:12.373 --> 03:52:15.007
OF THAT.                        
SO THERE WERE MANY MORE THINGS  
WE&apos;VE GOT A WHOLE LIST OF THEM. 

03:52:15.009 --> 03:52:16.075
SO THERE WERE MANY MORE THINGS  
WE&apos;VE GOT A WHOLE LIST OF THEM. 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT  

03:52:16.077 --> 03:52:18.911
WE&apos;VE GOT A WHOLE LIST OF THEM. 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT  
THAT DID WAS FORCE US TO CHANGE 

03:52:18.913 --> 03:52:19.546
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT  
THAT DID WAS FORCE US TO CHANGE 
THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING,     

03:52:19.548 --> 03:52:22.548
THAT DID WAS FORCE US TO CHANGE 
THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING,     
REMOVE THE FEATURES THAT WE     

03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:26.452
THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING,     
REMOVE THE FEATURES THAT WE     
ALSO LIKED OF SOME OF THE SO    

03:52:26.454 --> 03:52:27.053
REMOVE THE FEATURES THAT WE     
ALSO LIKED OF SOME OF THE SO    
IT&apos;S NOT SO FLAT.               

03:52:27.055 --> 03:52:30.356
ALSO LIKED OF SOME OF THE SO    
IT&apos;S NOT SO FLAT.               
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE I      

03:52:30.358 --> 03:52:31.124
IT&apos;S NOT SO FLAT.               
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE I      
DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT     

03:52:31.126 --> 03:52:31.791
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE I      
DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT     
WERKSMANS IN ARTICULATION,      

03:52:31.793 --> 03:52:34.460
DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT     
WERKSMANS IN ARTICULATION,      
ARTICULATE PORTIONS OF THE      

03:52:34.462 --> 03:52:35.494
WERKSMANS IN ARTICULATION,      
ARTICULATE PORTIONS OF THE      
BUILDING AND ALSO WE DID HAVE   

03:52:35.496 --> 03:52:38.498
ARTICULATE PORTIONS OF THE      
BUILDING AND ALSO WE DID HAVE   
SOME OUTDOOR PATIO DECKS THAT   

03:52:38.500 --> 03:52:39.432
BUILDING AND ALSO WE DID HAVE   
SOME OUTDOOR PATIO DECKS THAT   
WE WERE WE WEREN&apos;T ALL 100      

03:52:39.434 --> 03:52:42.835
SOME OUTDOOR PATIO DECKS THAT   
WE WERE WE WEREN&apos;T ALL 100      
PERCENT SURE HOW THAT WOULD END 

03:52:42.837 --> 03:52:45.371
WE WERE WE WEREN&apos;T ALL 100      
PERCENT SURE HOW THAT WOULD END 
UP BEING BUILT BECAUSE IT&apos;S     

03:52:45.373 --> 03:52:46.439
PERCENT SURE HOW THAT WOULD END 
UP BEING BUILT BECAUSE IT&apos;S     
HARD WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE IT ON   

03:52:46.441 --> 03:52:47.207
UP BEING BUILT BECAUSE IT&apos;S     
HARD WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE IT ON   
SOME OF YOUR UNITS IN THAT ALL  

03:52:47.209 --> 03:52:49.675
HARD WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE IT ON   
SOME OF YOUR UNITS IN THAT ALL  
OF YOUR UNITS, ESPECIALLY WHEN  

03:52:49.677 --> 03:52:50.477
SOME OF YOUR UNITS IN THAT ALL  
OF YOUR UNITS, ESPECIALLY WHEN  
EVERYBODY&apos;S GETTING SUBSIDIZED  

03:52:50.479 --> 03:52:53.479
OF YOUR UNITS, ESPECIALLY WHEN  
EVERYBODY&apos;S GETTING SUBSIDIZED  
SO EVERYBODY&apos;S PAYING 30        

03:52:53.481 --> 03:52:54.214
EVERYBODY&apos;S GETTING SUBSIDIZED  
SO EVERYBODY&apos;S PAYING 30        
PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON      

03:52:54.216 --> 03:52:54.414
SO EVERYBODY&apos;S PAYING 30        
PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON      
RENT.                           

03:52:54.416 --> 03:52:57.717
PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON      
RENT.                           
SO WE HAD TO MAKE SOME DESIGN   

03:52:57.719 --> 03:52:58.585
RENT.                           
SO WE HAD TO MAKE SOME DESIGN   
CHANGES THAT I FEEL LIKE MADE   

03:52:58.587 --> 03:53:01.387
SO WE HAD TO MAKE SOME DESIGN   
CHANGES THAT I FEEL LIKE MADE   
THE BUILDING LESS ATTRACTIVE    

03:53:01.389 --> 03:53:05.358
CHANGES THAT I FEEL LIKE MADE   
THE BUILDING LESS ATTRACTIVE    
AND FELT MORE LIKE A SUBSIDIZED 

03:53:05.360 --> 03:53:06.025
THE BUILDING LESS ATTRACTIVE    
AND FELT MORE LIKE A SUBSIDIZED 
NOT A MARKET RATE BUILDING      

03:53:06.027 --> 03:53:08.961
AND FELT MORE LIKE A SUBSIDIZED 
NOT A MARKET RATE BUILDING      
BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY EXPENSES 

03:53:08.963 --> 03:53:12.165
NOT A MARKET RATE BUILDING      
BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY EXPENSES 
THAT WE HAD TO REDUCE TO FIT    

03:53:12.167 --> 03:53:12.899
BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY EXPENSES 
THAT WE HAD TO REDUCE TO FIT    
WITHIN OUR FUNDING GUIDELINES.  

03:53:12.901 --> 03:53:16.269
THAT WE HAD TO REDUCE TO FIT    
WITHIN OUR FUNDING GUIDELINES.  
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS   

03:53:16.271 --> 03:53:17.203
WITHIN OUR FUNDING GUIDELINES.  
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS   
TOO BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE   

03:53:17.205 --> 03:53:17.937
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS   
TOO BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE   
BIG ONES AND I KNOW THERE&apos;S

IT IS HARD IT IS HARD ON A      
SMALL FOOTPRINT.                
WHEN WE LOOKED AT CATHERINE WE  

03:54:39.554 --> 03:54:40.286
SMALL FOOTPRINT.                
WHEN WE LOOKED AT CATHERINE WE  
LITERALLY WERE PUTTING IT ON

03:55:04.412 --> 03:55:06.079
                            AND 
THAT WAS IT.                    
&gt;&gt; FOUR HUNDRED FOOT DEPTH SO   

03:55:06.081 --> 03:55:06.946
THAT WAS IT.                    
&gt;&gt; FOUR HUNDRED FOOT DEPTH SO   
YOU COULD DO FEWER WELLS DEEPER 

03:55:06.948 --> 03:55:07.780
&gt;&gt; FOUR HUNDRED FOOT DEPTH SO   
YOU COULD DO FEWER WELLS DEEPER 
MORE EXPENSIVE EVEN WITH THE

YOU COULD DO FEWER WELLS DEEPER 
MORE EXPENSIVE EVEN WITH THE

WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION    
ACT OFFSETTING SOME OF THOSE    

03:55:11.153 --> 03:55:11.884
WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION    
ACT OFFSETTING SOME OF THOSE    
COST, OUR OPERATING COSTS ARE   

03:55:11.886 --> 03:55:12.552
ACT OFFSETTING SOME OF THOSE    
COST, OUR OPERATING COSTS ARE   
GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER.        

03:55:12.554 --> 03:55:13.353
COST, OUR OPERATING COSTS ARE   
GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER.        
WE CAN&apos;T INCREASE OUR RENT TO   

03:55:13.355 --> 03:55:13.986
GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER.        
WE CAN&apos;T INCREASE OUR RENT TO   
COVER THOSE OPERATING COSTS.    

03:55:13.988 --> 03:55:14.754
WE CAN&apos;T INCREASE OUR RENT TO   
COVER THOSE OPERATING COSTS.    
WE CAN&apos;T PASS THAT INCREASED    

03:55:14.756 --> 03:55:15.455
COVER THOSE OPERATING COSTS.    
WE CAN&apos;T PASS THAT INCREASED    
COST OF UTILITIES ONTO OUR      

03:55:15.457 --> 03:55:18.858
WE CAN&apos;T PASS THAT INCREASED    
COST OF UTILITIES ONTO OUR      
TENANTS AND SO WE HAVE TO GET   

03:55:18.860 --> 03:55:19.659
COST OF UTILITIES ONTO OUR      
TENANTS AND SO WE HAVE TO GET   
MORE SUBSIDY UP FRONT AND SO WE 

03:55:19.661 --> 03:55:22.195
TENANTS AND SO WE HAVE TO GET   
MORE SUBSIDY UP FRONT AND SO WE 
ALREADY WERE WAY HIGH COST FOR  

03:55:22.197 --> 03:55:25.698
MORE SUBSIDY UP FRONT AND SO WE 
ALREADY WERE WAY HIGH COST FOR  
OUR TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS     

03:55:25.700 --> 03:55:29.502
ALREADY WERE WAY HIGH COST FOR  
OUR TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS     
RIGHT NOW ARE OUR CURRENT PER   

03:55:29.504 --> 03:55:33.305
OUR TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS     
RIGHT NOW ARE OUR CURRENT PER   
UNIT COST FOR SIX HUNDRED ISH   

03:55:33.307 --> 03:55:34.073
RIGHT NOW ARE OUR CURRENT PER   
UNIT COST FOR SIX HUNDRED ISH   
SQUARE FOOT ONE BEDROOMS IS     

03:55:34.075 --> 03:55:34.740
UNIT COST FOR SIX HUNDRED ISH   
SQUARE FOOT ONE BEDROOMS IS     
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND     

03:55:34.742 --> 03:55:36.942
SQUARE FOOT ONE BEDROOMS IS     
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND     
DOLLARS A UNIT FOUR YEARS AGO   

03:55:36.944 --> 03:55:40.813
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND     
DOLLARS A UNIT FOUR YEARS AGO   
PRE COVID THOSE SAME UNITS      

03:55:40.815 --> 03:55:41.547
DOLLARS A UNIT FOUR YEARS AGO   
PRE COVID THOSE SAME UNITS      
WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSER TO       

03:55:41.549 --> 03:55:44.516
PRE COVID THOSE SAME UNITS      
WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSER TO       
PROBABLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 

03:55:44.518 --> 03:55:44.784
WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSER TO       
PROBABLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
DOLLARS.

PROBABLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
DOLLARS.                        
SO LIKE THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE  

03:55:45.787 --> 03:55:48.587
DOLLARS.                        
SO LIKE THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE  
IN A SHORT TIME FRAME OF WHAT   

03:55:48.589 --> 03:55:49.588
SO LIKE THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE  
IN A SHORT TIME FRAME OF WHAT   
IT IS COSTING AND WHAT&apos;S MAKING 

03:55:49.590 --> 03:55:51.657
IN A SHORT TIME FRAME OF WHAT   
IT IS COSTING AND WHAT&apos;S MAKING 
US LOOK AT OUR DESIGN.          

03:55:51.659 --> 03:55:52.792
IT IS COSTING AND WHAT&apos;S MAKING 
US LOOK AT OUR DESIGN.          
AND ONE THING WE DON&apos;T WANT TO
