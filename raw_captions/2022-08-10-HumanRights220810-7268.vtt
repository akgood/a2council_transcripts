WE DO.                          
THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT COIN IS   
THE WAY THE ORDINANCE IS        

00:11:31.826 --> 00:11:32.225
THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT COIN IS   
THE WAY THE ORDINANCE IS        
WRITTEN.                        

00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:39.198
THE WAY THE ORDINANCE IS

IT&amp;apos;S VERY VAGUE AND MY LAW      
BRAIN SAYS IT&amp;apos;S SO VAGUE THAT   

00:11:43.738 --> 00:11:51.177
IT&amp;apos;S VERY VAGUE AND MY LAW      
BRAIN SAYS IT&amp;apos;S SO VAGUE THAT   
IT DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE ENOUGH          

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:54.447
BRAIN SAYS IT&amp;apos;S SO VAGUE THAT   
IT DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE ENOUGH          
BASICALLY TO ALLOW THE HUMAN    

00:11:54.449 --> 00:11:58.484
IT DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE ENOUGH          
BASICALLY TO ALLOW THE HUMAN    
RIGHTS COMMISSION TO DO         

00:11:58.486 --> 00:12:02.355
BASICALLY TO ALLOW THE HUMAN    
RIGHTS COMMISSION TO DO         
ANYTHING OTHER THAN MEDIATE     

00:12:02.357 --> 00:12:06.492
RIGHTS COMMISSION TO DO         
ANYTHING OTHER THAN MEDIATE     
REALLY BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A  

00:12:06.494 --> 00:12:07.326
ANYTHING OTHER THAN MEDIATE     
REALLY BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A  
WHOLE LOT OF AUTHORITY WHEN IT  

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:10.529
REALLY BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A  
WHOLE LOT OF AUTHORITY WHEN IT  
COMES TO RESOLUTION OF SAD      

00:12:10.531 --> 00:12:14.633
WHOLE LOT OF AUTHORITY WHEN IT  
COMES TO RESOLUTION OF SAD      
COMPLAINTS.                     

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:18.771
COMES TO RESOLUTION OF SAD      
COMPLAINTS.

00:12:18.773 --> 00:12:22.441
COMPLAINTS.                     
AND SO I WONDER IF THERE SHOULD

AND SO I WONDER IF THERE SHOULD 
BE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT

SIMILAR TO A FORM OF RENT

SIMILAR TO A FORM OF RENT       
PAYMENT SO IT WOULD BE TO       
PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION BASED   

00:26:51.212 --> 00:26:52.277
PAYMENT SO IT WOULD BE TO       
PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION BASED   
ON THE SOURCE OF A GOVERNMENT   

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:58.384
PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION BASED   
ON THE SOURCE OF A GOVERNMENT

00:27:00.253 --> 00:27:08.093
         IN THAT WAY I THINK IT 
EXPRESSES MORE GENERALLY THAT   
THE CLASS OF GOVERNMENT ISSUED  

00:27:08.095 --> 00:27:11.897
EXPRESSES MORE GENERALLY THAT   
THE CLASS OF GOVERNMENT ISSUED  
IDS ARE TOGETHER AND THERE&amp;apos;S NO 

00:27:11.899 --> 00:27:15.567
THE CLASS OF GOVERNMENT ISSUED

THERE&amp;apos;S NO REASON UNLESS THERE  

00:27:15.569 --> 00:27:16.335
IDS ARE TOGETHER AND THERE&amp;apos;S NO 
THERE&amp;apos;S NO REASON UNLESS THERE  
IS A STATUTE COMPELLING A       

00:27:16.337 --> 00:27:19.805
THERE&amp;apos;S NO REASON UNLESS THERE  
IS A STATUTE COMPELLING A

00:27:31.251 --> 00:27:32.184
CLASS OF ID CARD.               
BUT IF THERE IS NO COMPELLING   
REASON THEN A GOVERNMENT ISSUED 

00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:38.556
BUT IF THERE IS NO COMPELLING   
REASON THEN A GOVERNMENT ISSUED 
I.D. SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY  

00:27:38.558 --> 00:27:39.224
REASON THEN A GOVERNMENT ISSUED 
I.D. SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY
