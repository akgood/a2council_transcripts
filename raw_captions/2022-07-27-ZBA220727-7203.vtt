THE FOURTH UNIT.                
SO ONCE THEY ADD THIS FOURTH    

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:15.564
THE FOURTH UNIT.                
SO ONCE THEY ADD THIS FOURTH

SO THEY ONLY HAVE FIVE FEET AND 

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:29.511

SO THEY ONLY HAVE FIVE FEET AND 
FIFTEEN.

BECAUSE THE GARAGE AND THIS     

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:40.689

IT WAS DENIED AND THIS IS A     
REAL APPLICATION FOR THAT.      

00:46:06.188 --> 00:46:10.391
IT WAS DENIED AND THIS IS A     
REAL APPLICATION FOR THAT.      
SO IT&amp;apos;S THE ALTERATION ITSELF,  

00:46:10.393 --> 00:46:14.294
REAL APPLICATION FOR THAT.      
SO IT&amp;apos;S THE ALTERATION ITSELF,  
THE NUMBER OF BEDROOMS SEEMS TO 

00:46:14.296 --> 00:46:16.930
SO IT&amp;apos;S THE ALTERATION ITSELF,  
THE NUMBER OF BEDROOMS SEEMS TO 
BE THE SAME OTHER THAN THE      

00:46:16.932 --> 00:46:21.368
THE NUMBER OF BEDROOMS SEEMS TO 
BE THE SAME OTHER THAN THE      
ADDITION OF THE BIKE AND YEAH I 

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:21.902
BE THE SAME OTHER THAN THE      
ADDITION OF THE BIKE AND YEAH I 
WILL SAY RIGHT.                 

00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:24.037
ADDITION OF THE BIKE AND YEAH I 
WILL SAY RIGHT.                 
ONE OF OUR CRITERIA FOR         

00:46:24.039 --> 00:46:24.971
WILL SAY RIGHT.                 
ONE OF OUR CRITERIA FOR         
NONCONFORMING IS THAT IT WILL   

00:46:24.973 --> 00:46:25.773
ONE OF OUR CRITERIA FOR         
NONCONFORMING IS THAT IT WILL   
NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT   

00:46:25.775 --> 00:46:28.041
NONCONFORMING IS THAT IT WILL   
NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT   
ON THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY.    

00:46:28.043 --> 00:46:29.076
NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT   
ON THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY.    
I THINK HAVING MORE BICYCLE     

00:46:29.078 --> 00:46:29.810
ON THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY.    
I THINK HAVING MORE BICYCLE     
PARKING COULD BE ARGUED TO HAVE 

00:46:29.812 --> 00:46:32.679
I THINK HAVING MORE BICYCLE     
PARKING COULD BE ARGUED TO HAVE 
LESS OF A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT.   

00:46:32.681 --> 00:46:35.982
PARKING COULD BE ARGUED TO HAVE 
LESS OF A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT.   
SO TO ME THIS IS A DIFFERENT A  

00:46:35.984 --> 00:46:36.550
LESS OF A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT.   
SO TO ME THIS IS A DIFFERENT A  
DIFFERENT APPLICATION.

NOW OBVIOUSLY THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT ALL   
GOING TO BE IN THE YOUNGEST     

01:32:41.414 --> 01:32:42.079
NOW OBVIOUSLY THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT ALL   
GOING TO BE IN THE YOUNGEST     
CATEGORY AND SO THE TOTAL       

01:32:42.081 --> 01:32:44.682

AND OF COURSE CHILDREN HAVE     

01:32:53.893 --> 01:32:56.227
TIME.                           
AND OF COURSE CHILDREN HAVE     
THIS HABIT OF GROWING UP AND SO 

01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:57.027
AND OF COURSE CHILDREN HAVE     
THIS HABIT OF GROWING UP AND SO 
THEY THEY GET OLDER AND THE     

01:32:57.029 --> 01:32:59.897
THIS HABIT OF GROWING UP AND SO 
THEY THEY GET OLDER AND THE     
NUMBER OF CAREGIVERS, THE RATIO 

01:32:59.899 --> 01:33:03.333
THEY THEY GET OLDER AND THE     
NUMBER OF CAREGIVERS, THE RATIO 
OF CAREGIVERS CHANGES OVER TIME 

01:33:03.335 --> 01:33:03.567
