OF WHEN WE INTEND TO DELIVER WE 
CAN GET AWAY WITH VALUE         

01:44:21.436 --> 01:44:22.068
OF WHEN WE INTEND TO DELIVER WE 
CAN GET AWAY WITH VALUE         
ENGINEERING THAT OUT OF OUR     

01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:24.970
CAN GET AWAY WITH VALUE         
ENGINEERING THAT OUT OF OUR     
PRICE WE WILL.                  

01:44:24.972 --> 01:44:25.738
ENGINEERING THAT OUT OF OUR     
PRICE WE WILL.                  
BUT BEFORE WE SAY WE&apos;RE GOING   

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:27.940
PRICE WE WILL.                  
BUT BEFORE WE SAY WE&apos;RE GOING   
TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO MAKE     

01:44:27.942 --> 01:44:28.874
BUT BEFORE WE SAY WE&apos;RE GOING   
TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO MAKE     
SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE POWER  

01:44:28.876 --> 01:44:29.675
TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO MAKE     
SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE POWER  
TO ACTUALLY SERVE THE BUILDING  

01:44:29.677 --> 01:44:32.278
SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE POWER  
TO ACTUALLY SERVE THE BUILDING  
AS ALL ELECTRIC AND REDUCE THE  

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:32.878
TO ACTUALLY SERVE THE BUILDING  
AS ALL ELECTRIC AND REDUCE THE  
NEED FOR THAT BOILER.           

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.715
AS ALL ELECTRIC AND REDUCE THE  
NEED FOR THAT BOILER.           
OK, SO ARE YOU PROVIDING WATER  

01:44:36.717 --> 01:44:37.049
NEED FOR THAT BOILER.           
OK, SO ARE YOU PROVIDING WATER  
HEAT?                           

01:44:37.051 --> 01:44:37.549
OK, SO ARE YOU PROVIDING WATER  
HEAT?                           
THAT&apos;S CORRECT.                 

01:44:37.551 --> 01:44:40.787
HEAT?                           
THAT&apos;S CORRECT.                 
SO WE WOULD HAVE A GAS BOILER   

01:44:40.789 --> 01:44:43.856
THAT&apos;S CORRECT.                 
SO WE WOULD HAVE A GAS BOILER   
FOR WATER HEAT NOT ONLY FOR THE 

01:44:43.858 --> 01:44:44.457
SO WE WOULD HAVE A GAS BOILER   
FOR WATER HEAT NOT ONLY FOR THE 
RETAIL PORTION BUT FOR THE      

01:44:44.459 --> 01:44:45.191
FOR WATER HEAT NOT ONLY FOR THE 
RETAIL PORTION BUT FOR THE      
RESIDENTIAL PORTION AS WELL.    

01:44:45.193 --> 01:44:48.026
RETAIL PORTION BUT FOR THE      
RESIDENTIAL PORTION AS WELL.    
THAT&apos;S THE ELEMENT THAT TAKES   

01:44:48.028 --> 01:44:48.695
RESIDENTIAL PORTION AS WELL.    
THAT&apos;S THE ELEMENT THAT TAKES   
THE MOST ELECTRICITY AND IT&apos;S   

01:44:48.697 --> 01:44:49.628
THAT&apos;S THE ELEMENT THAT TAKES   
THE MOST ELECTRICITY AND IT&apos;S   
HARD TO DO THAT WHEN THE GRID   

01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:52.064
THE MOST ELECTRICITY AND IT&apos;S   
HARD TO DO THAT WHEN THE GRID   
IS OVERLOADED PARTICULARLY IN   

01:44:52.066 --> 01:44:52.498
HARD TO DO THAT WHEN THE GRID   
IS OVERLOADED PARTICULARLY IN   
THE WINTER.                     

01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:53.399
IS OVERLOADED PARTICULARLY IN   
THE WINTER.                     
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHEN THAT WOULD   

01:44:53.401 --> 01:44:56.435
THE WINTER.                     
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHEN THAT WOULD   
PRIMARY THE BOILER IF WE WERE   

01:44:56.437 --> 01:44:57.202
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHEN THAT WOULD   
PRIMARY THE BOILER IF WE WERE   
TO BUILD THAT BUILDING WITH THE 

01:44:57.204 --> 01:45:00.172
PRIMARY THE BOILER IF WE WERE   
TO BUILD THAT BUILDING WITH THE 
AUXILIARY BOILER THAT&apos;S WHEN    

01:45:00.174 --> 01:45:01.007
TO BUILD THAT BUILDING WITH THE 
AUXILIARY BOILER THAT&apos;S WHEN    
THE BOILER WOULD BE MOST ACTIVE 

01:45:01.009 --> 01:45:01.607
AUXILIARY BOILER THAT&apos;S WHEN    
THE BOILER WOULD BE MOST ACTIVE 
WOULD BE DURING THE WINTER      

01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:03.743
THE BOILER WOULD BE MOST ACTIVE 
WOULD BE DURING THE WINTER      
MONTHS IF WE CAN GET THE POWER  

01:45:03.745 --> 01:45:04.410
WOULD BE DURING THE WINTER      
MONTHS IF WE CAN GET THE POWER  
TO NOT HAVE THE BOILER WE       

01:45:04.412 --> 01:45:06.912
MONTHS IF WE CAN GET THE POWER  
TO NOT HAVE THE BOILER WE       
CERTAINLY DON&apos;T WANT TO PAY FOR 

01:45:06.914 --> 01:45:07.846
TO NOT HAVE THE BOILER WE       
CERTAINLY DON&apos;T WANT TO PAY FOR 
IT SO WE WOULD RATHER NOT BUILD 

01:45:07.848 --> 01:45:10.816
CERTAINLY DON&apos;T WANT TO PAY FOR 
IT SO WE WOULD RATHER NOT BUILD 
IT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE ALREADY   

01:45:10.818 --> 01:45:14.654
IT SO WE WOULD RATHER NOT BUILD 
IT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE ALREADY   
HAD TO EXTEND POWER TO OUR SITE 

01:45:14.656 --> 01:45:14.987
IT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE ALREADY   
HAD TO EXTEND POWER TO OUR SITE 
.                               

01:45:14.989 --> 01:45:15.988
HAD TO EXTEND POWER TO OUR SITE 
.                               
SO THE PLAN WOULD BE TO HAVE    

01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:18.691
.                               
SO THE PLAN WOULD BE TO HAVE    
THE ABILITY TO DO THE BOILER IF 

01:45:18.693 --> 01:45:19.425
SO THE PLAN WOULD BE TO HAVE    
THE ABILITY TO DO THE BOILER IF 
WE NEED IT WITHOUT COMING BACK  

01:45:19.427 --> 01:45:21.827
THE ABILITY TO DO THE BOILER IF 
WE NEED IT WITHOUT COMING BACK  
TO CITY COUNCIL OR PLANNING     

01:45:21.829 --> 01:45:22.895
WE NEED IT WITHOUT COMING BACK  
TO CITY COUNCIL OR PLANNING     
COMMISSION AND THEN TRY NOT TO  

01:45:22.897 --> 01:45:26.732
TO CITY COUNCIL OR PLANNING     
COMMISSION AND THEN TRY NOT TO  
AND THEN YOU CAN HEAT YOU CAN   

01:45:26.734 --> 01:45:29.936
COMMISSION AND THEN TRY NOT TO  
AND THEN YOU CAN HEAT YOU CAN   
HEAT A BUILDING USING           

01:45:29.938 --> 01:45:30.603
AND THEN YOU CAN HEAT YOU CAN   
HEAT A BUILDING USING           
ESSENTIALLY RADIATORS WITH      

01:45:30.605 --> 01:45:31.004
HEAT A BUILDING USING           
ESSENTIALLY RADIATORS WITH      
ELECTRICITY.                    

01:45:31.006 --> 01:45:33.172
ESSENTIALLY RADIATORS WITH      
ELECTRICITY.                    
YOU CAN HIT THE WATER WITH      

01:45:33.174 --> 01:45:33.539
ELECTRICITY.                    
YOU CAN HIT THE WATER WITH      
ELECTRICITY.                    

01:45:33.541 --> 01:45:33.873
YOU CAN HIT THE WATER WITH      
ELECTRICITY.                    
RIGHT.

01:58:50.003 --> 01:58:50.868
SITE MANAGEMENT DURING DELIVERY 
HOURS THAT WOULD HANDLE THAT.   
WE HAVE A SYSTEM CALLED         

01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:53.705
HOURS THAT WOULD HANDLE THAT.   
WE HAVE A SYSTEM CALLED         
BUTTERFLY IMEX WHICH WE COULD   

01:58:53.707 --> 01:58:54.472
WE HAVE A SYSTEM CALLED         
BUTTERFLY IMEX WHICH WE COULD   
ARRANGE FOR ENTRY INTO THE      

01:58:54.474 --> 01:58:57.642
BUTTERFLY IMEX WHICH WE COULD   
ARRANGE FOR ENTRY INTO THE      
BUILDING THROUGH THAT SYSTEM.   

01:58:57.644 --> 01:58:58.510
ARRANGE FOR ENTRY INTO THE      
BUILDING THROUGH THAT SYSTEM.   
OK BECAUSE THAT&apos;S JUST BOTH

01:59:05.986 --> 01:59:06.784
SHOWN THERE YOU SEE THAT ACTUAL 
CURB CUT AS ABOUT TWENTY FEET   
AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE.  

01:59:06.786 --> 01:59:08.586
CURB CUT AS ABOUT TWENTY FEET

OK, PERFECT.                    

01:59:08.588 --> 01:59:09.621

THIS SPOT WHICH IS              

01:59:13.227 --> 01:59:19.498
OF BUILDINGS IN TOWN AND IN     
THIS SPOT WHICH IS              
EXTRAORDINARILY HEAVY TRAFFIC   

01:59:20.399 --> 01:59:24.202
IT COULD REALLY BE A BIG        
PROBLEM.                        
SO I&apos;M GLAD THAT THAT HAS BEEN  

01:59:24.204 --> 01:59:27.305
PROBLEM.                        
SO I&apos;M GLAD THAT THAT HAS BEEN  
DISCUSSED AND THOUGHT ABOUT     

01:59:27.307 --> 01:59:34.179
SO I&apos;M GLAD THAT THAT HAS BEEN  
DISCUSSED AND THOUGHT ABOUT     
LET&apos;S SEE JUST ANOTHER I LIKE   

01:59:34.181 --> 01:59:35.046
DISCUSSED AND THOUGHT ABOUT     
LET&apos;S SEE JUST ANOTHER I LIKE   
THE MIXTURE OF THE APARTMENT    

01:59:35.048 --> 01:59:35.379
LET&apos;S SEE JUST ANOTHER I LIKE   
THE MIXTURE OF THE APARTMENT    
SIZES.                          

01:59:35.381 --> 01:59:36.314
THE MIXTURE OF THE APARTMENT    
SIZES.                          
I THINK THAT&apos;S A REALLY GOOD    

01:59:36.316 --> 01:59:39.083
SIZES.                          
I THINK THAT&apos;S A REALLY GOOD    
GOOD THING FOR THIS ONE.        

01:59:39.085 --> 01:59:42.320
I THINK THAT&apos;S A REALLY GOOD    
GOOD THING FOR THIS ONE.        
WE DON&apos;T ALWAYS SEE THAT BIRD   

01:59:42.322 --> 01:59:42.720
GOOD THING FOR THIS ONE.        
WE DON&apos;T ALWAYS SEE THAT BIRD   
GLASS.                          

01:59:42.722 --> 01:59:43.622
WE DON&apos;T ALWAYS SEE THAT BIRD   
GLASS.                          
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SILLY THING    

01:59:43.624 --> 01:59:44.422
GLASS.                          
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SILLY THING    
BUT IT&apos;S ACTUALLY A BIG DEAL.   

01:59:44.424 --> 01:59:46.991
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SILLY THING    
BUT IT&apos;S ACTUALLY A BIG DEAL.   
SO ANOTHER ANOTHER POINT FOR    

01:59:46.993 --> 01:59:50.027
BUT IT&apos;S ACTUALLY A BIG DEAL.   
SO ANOTHER ANOTHER POINT FOR    
THE BIRDS GLASS AND THEN THE    

01:59:50.029 --> 01:59:50.862
SO ANOTHER ANOTHER POINT FOR    
THE BIRDS GLASS AND THEN THE    
OTHER QUESTION SO I KNOW YOU&apos;RE 

01:59:50.864 --> 01:59:51.462
THE BIRDS GLASS AND THEN THE    
OTHER QUESTION SO I KNOW YOU&apos;RE 
GOING TO WORK ON THAT.          

01:59:51.464 --> 01:59:54.399
OTHER QUESTION SO I KNOW YOU&apos;RE 
GOING TO WORK ON THAT.          
ARE YOU ADDING A CROSSWALK AT   

01:59:54.401 --> 01:59:58.036
GOING TO WORK ON THAT.          
ARE YOU ADDING A CROSSWALK AT   
HOOVER OR MOVING THE CROSSWALK  

01:59:58.038 --> 02:00:01.773
ARE YOU ADDING A CROSSWALK AT   
HOOVER OR MOVING THE CROSSWALK  
FROM THE SOUTH SIDE TO THE      

02:00:01.775 --> 02:00:02.774
HOOVER OR MOVING THE CROSSWALK  
FROM THE SOUTH SIDE TO THE      
NORTH SIDE OF HOOVER AND ST.    

02:00:02.776 --> 02:00:05.643
FROM THE SOUTH SIDE TO THE      
NORTH SIDE OF HOOVER AND ST.    
ORIENTATION?                    

02:00:05.645 --> 02:00:06.578
NORTH SIDE OF HOOVER AND ST.    
ORIENTATION?                    
THE LOCATION OF THE CROSSWALK   

02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:07.245
ORIENTATION?                    
THE LOCATION OF THE CROSSWALK   
IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.        

02:00:07.247 --> 02:00:09.347
THE LOCATION OF THE CROSSWALK   
IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.        
WE&apos;RE MOVING SOME RAMPS AROUND  

02:00:09.349 --> 02:00:10.281
IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.        
WE&apos;RE MOVING SOME RAMPS AROUND  
A LITTLE BIT TO ACCOMMODATE     

02:00:10.283 --> 02:00:16.955
WE&apos;RE MOVING SOME RAMPS AROUND  
A LITTLE BIT TO ACCOMMODATE     
SOME POLES BUT WE&apos;RE PUTTING A  

02:00:30.837 --> 02:00:32.970
WE&apos;RE UPGRADING THE SIGNAL      
THERE BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE EXIT 
FROM THE COURTYARD WILL BE A    

02:00:32.972 --> 02:00:33.372
THERE BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE EXIT 
FROM THE COURTYARD WILL BE A    
SIGNALIZED EXIT.                

02:00:33.374 --> 02:00:34.239
FROM THE COURTYARD WILL BE A    
SIGNALIZED EXIT.                
IT&apos;LL BE IT&apos;S ACTUALLY A FOUR   

02:00:34.241 --> 02:00:34.972
SIGNALIZED EXIT.                
IT&apos;LL BE IT&apos;S ACTUALLY A FOUR   
WAY STOP STOP LIGHT AS OPPOSED  

02:00:34.974 --> 02:00:35.573
IT&apos;LL BE IT&apos;S ACTUALLY A FOUR   
WAY STOP STOP LIGHT AS OPPOSED  
TO A THREE WAY RIGHT NOW.       

02:00:35.575 --> 02:00:36.241
WAY STOP STOP LIGHT AS OPPOSED  
TO A THREE WAY RIGHT NOW.       
SO THERE&apos;S JUST GENERALIZED     

02:00:36.243 --> 02:00:36.908
TO A THREE WAY RIGHT NOW.       
SO THERE&apos;S JUST GENERALIZED     
IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THERE&apos;S    

02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:37.676
SO THERE&apos;S JUST GENERALIZED     
IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THERE&apos;S    
NOT A CROSSWALK ON THE NORTH    

02:00:37.678 --> 02:00:38.276
IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THERE&apos;S    
NOT A CROSSWALK ON THE NORTH    
SIDE OF THAT INTERSECTION.      

02:00:38.278 --> 02:00:39.010
NOT A CROSSWALK ON THE NORTH    
SIDE OF THAT INTERSECTION.      
THERE&apos;S ONLY A CROSSWALK ON THE 

02:00:39.012 --> 02:00:39.745
SIDE OF THAT INTERSECTION.      
THERE&apos;S ONLY A CROSSWALK ON THE 
SOUTH SIDE OF THAT INTERSECTION 

02:00:39.747 --> 02:00:40.545
THERE&apos;S ONLY A CROSSWALK ON THE 
SOUTH SIDE OF THAT INTERSECTION 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE   

02:00:40.547 --> 02:00:41.279
SOUTH SIDE OF THAT INTERSECTION 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE   
OPPOSITE BUT IT USES ONE I USED 

02:00:41.281 --> 02:00:41.880
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE   
OPPOSITE BUT IT USES ONE I USED 
TO BE IT WAS NOW IT WAS         

02:00:41.882 --> 02:00:42.347
OPPOSITE BUT IT USES ONE I USED 
TO BE IT WAS NOW IT WAS         
SWITCHED.                       

02:00:42.349 --> 02:00:43.014
TO BE IT WAS NOW IT WAS         
SWITCHED.                       
OK, BECAUSE THE NORTH SIDE      

02:00:43.016 --> 02:00:43.415
SWITCHED.                       
OK, BECAUSE THE NORTH SIDE      
DIDN&apos;T WORK.                    

02:00:43.417 --> 02:00:45.283
OK, BECAUSE THE NORTH SIDE      
DIDN&apos;T WORK.                    
THE SOUTH SIDE HAD AND THERE&apos;S  

02:00:45.285 --> 02:00:46.218
DIDN&apos;T WORK.                    
THE SOUTH SIDE HAD AND THERE&apos;S  
THERE&apos;S ONE THAT I WON&apos;T DEBATE 

02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:48.920
THE SOUTH SIDE HAD AND THERE&apos;S  
THERE&apos;S ONE THAT I WON&apos;T DEBATE 
WHICH SIDE SIDE.                

02:00:48.922 --> 02:00:49.487
THERE&apos;S ONE THAT I WON&apos;T DEBATE 
WHICH SIDE SIDE.                
YEAH, OK.                       

02:00:49.489 --> 02:00:53.357
WHICH SIDE SIDE.                
YEAH, OK.                       
AND THEN A POINT FOR THE CITY   

02:00:53.359 --> 02:00:56.928
YEAH, OK.                       
AND THEN A POINT FOR THE CITY   
MAYBE THAT IS PROBABLY NOT YOUR 

02:00:56.930 --> 02:00:57.728
AND THEN A POINT FOR THE CITY   
MAYBE THAT IS PROBABLY NOT YOUR 
RESPONSIBILITY BUT THE THAT     

02:00:57.730 --> 02:01:05.036
MAYBE THAT IS PROBABLY NOT YOUR 
RESPONSIBILITY BUT THE THAT     
WHOLE INTERSECTION NOT THE THE  

02:01:05.038 --> 02:01:08.340
RESPONSIBILITY BUT THE THAT     
WHOLE INTERSECTION NOT THE THE  
STATE PACARD AABA INTERSECTION  

02:01:08.342 --> 02:01:09.141
WHOLE INTERSECTION NOT THE THE  
STATE PACARD AABA INTERSECTION  
IS A REALLY INTENSE             

02:01:09.143 --> 02:01:13.277
STATE PACARD AABA INTERSECTION  
IS A REALLY INTENSE             
INTERSECTION AND WHEN WE&apos;RE     

02:01:13.279 --> 02:01:14.112
IS A REALLY INTENSE             
INTERSECTION AND WHEN WE&apos;RE     
ADDING A LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT ON 

02:01:14.114 --> 02:01:17.516
INTERSECTION AND WHEN WE&apos;RE

THAT CORNER AND THERE&apos;S A LOT   

02:01:17.518 --> 02:01:21.252
ADDING A LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT ON 
THAT CORNER AND THERE&apos;S A LOT   
OF BIKES AND THERE&apos;S A LOT      

02:01:21.254 --> 02:01:22.253
THAT CORNER AND THERE&apos;S A LOT   
OF BIKES AND THERE&apos;S A LOT      
OF IT&apos;S IT&apos;S A HARD ONE TO KIND 

02:01:22.255 --> 02:01:24.056

OF GET ACROSS.                  
IT&apos;S KIND OF A SCRAMBLE.        
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW IF WE CAN DO    

02:01:28.728 --> 02:01:29.761
IT&apos;S KIND OF A SCRAMBLE.        
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW IF WE CAN DO    
SOMETHING TO MAKE THAT MAYBE IT 

02:01:29.763 --> 02:01:32.363
SO I DON&apos;T KNOW IF WE CAN DO    
SOMETHING TO MAKE THAT MAYBE IT 
JUST APPEARS UNSAFE AS A        

02:01:32.365 --> 02:01:35.834
SOMETHING TO MAKE THAT MAYBE IT 
JUST APPEARS UNSAFE AS A

BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I&apos;D  
LIKE IF YOU KNOW THE CHANCE     

02:01:39.906 --> 02:01:40.672
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I&apos;D  
LIKE IF YOU KNOW THE CHANCE     
SOMEBODY COULD TAKE A LOOK AND  

02:01:40.674 --> 02:01:43.708
LIKE IF YOU KNOW THE CHANCE     
SOMEBODY COULD TAKE A LOOK AND

DTG THAT WILL BE OUT OF THEIR

BE DEMOLISHED AND THEN THE      

02:12:55.848 --> 02:12:59.016
TWO TREES LEFT AND RIGHT WILL   
BE DEMOLISHED AND THEN THE      
BASEMENT&apos;S PULLED AWAY FROM THE 

02:12:59.018 --> 02:12:59.817
BE DEMOLISHED AND THEN THE      
BASEMENT&apos;S PULLED AWAY FROM THE 
TREES AND HE&apos;S DESIGNING A      

02:12:59.819 --> 02:13:03.054
BASEMENT&apos;S PULLED AWAY FROM THE 
TREES AND HE&apos;S DESIGNING A      
BACKFILL MIX BECAUSE OF THE     

02:13:03.056 --> 02:13:04.055
TREES AND HE&apos;S DESIGNING A      
BACKFILL MIX BECAUSE OF THE     
SPECIES THEY ARE IT HAS TO BE   

02:13:04.057 --> 02:13:04.522
BACKFILL MIX BECAUSE OF THE     
SPECIES THEY ARE IT HAS TO BE   
WELL TRAINED.                   

02:13:04.524 --> 02:13:06.590
SPECIES THEY ARE IT HAS TO BE   
WELL TRAINED.                   
YOU DON&apos;T WANT A LOT OF WATER   

02:13:06.592 --> 02:13:07.391
WELL TRAINED.                   
YOU DON&apos;T WANT A LOT OF WATER   
SITTING UP AGAINST THOSE ROOFS  

02:13:07.393 --> 02:13:10.260
YOU DON&apos;T WANT A LOT OF WATER   
SITTING UP AGAINST THOSE ROOFS  
BECAUSE OF THE TREE.            

02:13:10.262 --> 02:13:11.295
SITTING UP AGAINST THOSE ROOFS  
BECAUSE OF THE TREE.            
SO IT&apos;S GOING TO BE A MIXTURE   

02:13:11.297 --> 02:13:12.096
BECAUSE OF THE TREE.            
SO IT&apos;S GOING TO BE A MIXTURE   
OF SAND AND LOAM AND LIFTS TO   

02:13:12.098 --> 02:13:14.565
SO IT&apos;S GOING TO BE A MIXTURE   
OF SAND AND LOAM AND LIFTS TO   
GET PUT BACK INTO THE VOIDS     

02:13:14.567 --> 02:13:15.365
OF SAND AND LOAM AND LIFTS TO   
GET PUT BACK INTO THE VOIDS     
THAT ARE CREATED BY THE REMOVAL 

02:13:15.367 --> 02:13:18.202
GET PUT BACK INTO THE VOIDS     
THAT ARE CREATED BY THE REMOVAL 
OF THE FOUNDATION SYSTEM.       

02:13:18.204 --> 02:13:19.303
THAT ARE CREATED BY THE REMOVAL 
OF THE FOUNDATION SYSTEM.       
AND THEN YOU&apos;LL NOTICE WE HAVE

02:13:23.209 --> 02:13:24.341
PROTECTIONS ON TOP LAND AROUND  
EACH OF THOSE TREES.            
SO ONCE THAT NEW SOIL IS PUT IN 

02:13:24.343 --> 02:13:26.610
EACH OF THOSE TREES.            
SO ONCE THAT NEW SOIL IS PUT IN 
THERE, PROTECTION METHODS WE&apos;RE 

02:13:26.612 --> 02:13:30.314
SO ONCE THAT NEW SOIL IS PUT IN 
THERE, PROTECTION METHODS WE&apos;RE 
PUTTING EVEN OUTSIDE IT&apos;S       

02:13:30.316 --> 02:13:31.182

OF A STICKLER SORRY.            
IT&apos;S A VERY DETAILED NIT PICKY  
QUESTION.                       

02:26:02.267 --> 02:26:03.400
IT&apos;S A VERY DETAILED NIT PICKY  
QUESTION.                       
IT WAS MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION  

02:26:03.402 --> 02:26:04.001
QUESTION.                       
IT WAS MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION  
THAT HAVING A MINIMUM NUMBER    

02:26:04.003 --> 02:26:07.103
IT WAS MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION  
THAT HAVING A MINIMUM NUMBER    
OF STORIES WILL GET AT WHAT WE  

02:26:07.105 --> 02:26:10.941
THAT HAVING A MINIMUM NUMBER    
OF STORIES WILL GET AT WHAT WE  
WANT BETTER THAN PUTTING IN A   

02:26:10.943 --> 02:26:11.441
OF STORIES WILL GET AT WHAT WE  
WANT BETTER THAN PUTTING IN A   
NUMBER OF FEET.                 

02:26:11.443 --> 02:26:14.244
WANT BETTER THAN PUTTING IN A   
NUMBER OF FEET.                 
I THINK IT&apos;S VERY CLEAR HERE    

02:26:14.246 --> 02:26:15.011
NUMBER OF FEET.                 
I THINK IT&apos;S VERY CLEAR HERE    
AND WE ONLY INCLUDE THIS        

02:26:15.013 --> 02:26:15.879
I THINK IT&apos;S VERY CLEAR HERE

BECAUSE THEY ARE SAYING THAT A  
BENEFIT IS INCREASED DENSITY.   
SO YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE

DWELLING UNIT THAT DEFINITION   
GOES TO DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY  
THAT ALTERNATE.                 

02:59:20.463 --> 02:59:23.598
GOES TO DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY  
THAT ALTERNATE.                 
IF WE DIDN&apos;T HAVE THAT, I THINK 

02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:24.332
THAT ALTERNATE.                 
IF WE DIDN&apos;T HAVE THAT, I THINK 
ONE SCENARIO WOULD BE IS THAT   

02:59:24.334 --> 02:59:26.467
IF WE DIDN&apos;T HAVE THAT, I THINK 
ONE SCENARIO WOULD BE IS THAT   
WE DON&apos;T WE DON&apos;T CARE IF YOU   

02:59:26.469 --> 02:59:30.071
ONE SCENARIO WOULD BE IS THAT   
WE DON&apos;T WE DON&apos;T CARE IF YOU   
HAVE IF YOU ARE IN AN HOUR ONE

CURRENT WITHOUT THAT DEFINITION 

02:59:31.575 --> 02:59:34.876
ZONE CURRENTLY UNDER OUR        
CURRENT WITHOUT THAT DEFINITION 
IT MEANS MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A 

02:59:34.878 --> 02:59:38.613
CURRENT WITHOUT THAT DEFINITION 
IT MEANS MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A 
60 60 BEDROOM HOME AS OPPOSED   

02:59:38.615 --> 02:59:42.950
IT MEANS MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A 
60 60 BEDROOM HOME AS OPPOSED   
TO A FOUR OR FIVE BEDROOM HOME  

02:59:42.952 --> 02:59:43.685
60 60 BEDROOM HOME AS OPPOSED   
TO A FOUR OR FIVE BEDROOM HOME  
WITHIN THAT OR SIX BEDROOM HOME 

02:59:43.687 --> 02:59:44.352
TO A FOUR OR FIVE BEDROOM HOME  
WITHIN THAT OR SIX BEDROOM HOME 
DEPENDING ON WHAT ZONING        

02:59:44.354 --> 02:59:46.421
WITHIN THAT OR SIX BEDROOM HOME 
DEPENDING ON WHAT ZONING        
DISTRICT AROUND.                

02:59:46.423 --> 02:59:47.422
DEPENDING ON WHAT ZONING        
DISTRICT AROUND.                
AND SO THAT IS THAT WAS THAT    

02:59:47.424 --> 02:59:50.792
DISTRICT AROUND.                
AND SO THAT IS THAT WAS THAT    
WAS A FRAMEWORK THAT WHEN OUR   

02:59:50.794 --> 02:59:51.592
AND SO THAT IS THAT WAS THAT    
WAS A FRAMEWORK THAT WHEN OUR   
ORDINANCE WAS CRAFTED THOSE TWO 

02:59:51.594 --> 02:59:54.396
WAS A FRAMEWORK THAT WHEN OUR   
ORDINANCE WAS CRAFTED THOSE TWO 
THINGS WERE USED COMBINED AS    

02:59:54.398 --> 02:59:57.832
ORDINANCE WAS CRAFTED THOSE TWO 
THINGS WERE USED COMBINED AS    
THEY&apos;VE HAD AN IMPACT ON        

02:59:57.834 --> 02:59:58.700
THINGS WERE USED COMBINED AS    
THEY&apos;VE HAD AN IMPACT ON        
MACING, THEY&apos;VE HAD AN IMPACT   

02:59:58.702 --> 03:00:02.237
THEY&apos;VE HAD AN IMPACT ON        
MACING, THEY&apos;VE HAD AN IMPACT   
ON DENSITY DENSITY              

03:00:02.239 --> 03:00:02.704
MACING, THEY&apos;VE HAD AN IMPACT   
ON DENSITY DENSITY              
OF POPULATION.                  

03:00:02.706 --> 03:00:05.573
ON DENSITY DENSITY              
OF POPULATION.                  
AND SO I DON&apos;T MEAN TO SAY THAT 

03:00:05.575 --> 03:00:06.174
OF POPULATION.                  
AND SO I DON&apos;T MEAN TO SAY THAT 
IT&apos;S NOT INTENTIONAL.

IT&apos;S VERY INTENTIONAL.

IN FACT THAT DEFINITION HAS HAD

03:00:13.950 --> 03:00:17.351
IN FACT THAT DEFINITION HAS HAD 
REPERCUSSIONS FOR BETTER OR

03:00:17.353 --> 03:00:18.619
REPERCUSSIONS FOR BETTER OR

IT IS KIND OF HOW YOU DEFINE A

IT IS KIND OF HOW YOU DEFINE A  
FAMILY CAN BE REALLY            

03:00:21.925 --> 03:00:22.657
IT IS KIND OF HOW YOU DEFINE A  
FAMILY CAN BE REALLY            
CHALLENGING FROM A LEGAL        

03:00:22.659 --> 03:00:23.057

CHALLENGING FROM A LEGAL        
PERSPECTIVE.
