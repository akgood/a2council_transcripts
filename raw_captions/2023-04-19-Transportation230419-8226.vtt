00:16:35.469 --> 00:16:35.735
THE BUDGET IN IN JANUARY WHEN   
WE FIRST START FORMULATING

00:16:39.607 --> 00:16:40.539
SO IF WE WOULD HAVE MISSED THAT 
WINDOW IT LIKELY WOULD HAVE     
BEEN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TOO   

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:43.242
WINDOW IT LIKELY WOULD HAVE     
BEEN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TOO   
FAR IN THE PROCESS TO BACKTRACK

HAVE BEEN DONE BUT I DON&apos;T      

00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:07.266
THINK IT WAS REALLY I KNOW THAT 
RAYMOND MENTIONED IT BUT I      
DON&apos;T BELIEVE THAT IT GOT THE

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.068
APPROPRIATE ATTENTION THAT IT   
SHOULD HAVE.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:09.735
SHOULD HAVE.                    
SO I THINK THAT IS AN AREA      
WHERE WE COULD PERHAPS          

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:10.402
SO I THINK THAT IS AN AREA

STRENGTHEN THE COMMUNICATION    

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:11.137

WITH EARLIER ITERATIONS         
OF MICRO MOBILITY.              

00:42:14.807 --> 00:42:15.807
WITH EARLIER ITERATIONS         
OF MICRO MOBILITY.              
WE HAD SCOOTERS BACK AT OUR     

00:42:15.809 --> 00:42:18.108
OF MICRO MOBILITY.              
WE HAD SCOOTERS BACK AT OUR     
IMPETUS AS A COMPANY THAT THEIR 

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:18.809
WE HAD SCOOTERS BACK AT OUR     
IMPETUS AS A COMPANY THAT THEIR 
MILEAGE, THEIR MILEAGE RANGE    

00:42:18.811 --> 00:42:19.676
IMPETUS AS A COMPANY THAT THEIR 
MILEAGE, THEIR MILEAGE RANGE    
WOULD BE ABOUT THREE TO FIVE    

00:42:19.678 --> 00:42:22.146
MILEAGE, THEIR MILEAGE RANGE    
WOULD BE ABOUT THREE TO FIVE    
MILES.                          

00:42:22.148 --> 00:42:22.914
WOULD BE ABOUT THREE TO FIVE    
MILES.                          
SO REALLY GETTING UP TO THAT    

00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:23.781
MILES.                          
SO REALLY GETTING UP TO THAT    
ONE HUNDRED NUMBER IS A HUGE    

00:42:23.783 --> 00:42:26.650
SO REALLY GETTING UP TO THAT    
ONE HUNDRED NUMBER IS A HUGE    
WIN ALLOWS MULTIPLE TRIPS TO BE 

00:42:26.652 --> 00:42:27.384
ONE HUNDRED NUMBER IS A HUGE    
WIN ALLOWS MULTIPLE TRIPS TO BE 
TAKEN ON THESE VEHICLES AND     

00:42:27.386 --> 00:42:30.187
WIN ALLOWS MULTIPLE TRIPS TO BE 
TAKEN ON THESE VEHICLES AND     
LONGER TRIPS FOR LONGER

THAT NUMBER AND ACTUALLY HERE   
IN ANN ARBOR I THINK OUR        
AVERAGE ON THE YEAR IS CLOSER   

01:04:19.797 --> 01:04:23.433
IN ANN ARBOR I THINK OUR        
AVERAGE ON THE YEAR IS CLOSER   
TO ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN TO TWO 

01:04:23.435 --> 01:04:24.200
AVERAGE ON THE YEAR IS CLOSER

MOMENT.                         
WE STARTED COLLECTING           

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:41.577
MOMENT.

KINGSLY.                        
SO THOSE ARE TWO SERIOUS        
CRASHES THAT ARE IN JANUARIES
