IT'S A LOT BIGGER NOW THAN IT   
WAS HISTORICALLY AND NOW WE'RE  
PUTTING ANOTHER BIG STRUCTURE   

00:27:48.807 --> 00:27:52.009
WAS HISTORICALLY AND NOW WE'RE  
PUTTING ANOTHER BIG STRUCTURE   
RIGHT ALONGSIDE OF IT.          

00:27:52.011 --> 00:27:52.943
PUTTING ANOTHER BIG STRUCTURE   
RIGHT ALONGSIDE OF IT.

BECAUSE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE  
HAS BEEN ADDED ON TO SO MANY
