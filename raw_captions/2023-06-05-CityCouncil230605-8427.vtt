02:59:50.133 --> 02:59:50.898
SO IN SOME SENSES ARE WE&apos;RE AN  
ATTRACTIVE COMMUNITY TO BUILD   
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF THAT&apos;S    

02:59:50.900 --> 02:59:54.134
ATTRACTIVE COMMUNITY TO BUILD   
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF THAT&apos;S    
THE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT YOU DO 

02:59:54.136 --> 02:59:54.802
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF THAT&apos;S    
THE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT YOU DO 
BECAUSE YOU CAN CHARGE MORE

WE COULD CHARGE SIX HUNDRED     
DOLLARS A MONTH IN RENT TO      

03:00:58.935 --> 03:00:59.934
WE COULD CHARGE SIX HUNDRED     
DOLLARS A MONTH IN RENT TO      
REACH THAT 60 PERCENT AIMI OR   

03:00:59.936 --> 03:01:03.237

03:01:04.307 --> 03:01:07.908
50 PERCENT IN MY HOUSEHOLD THAT 
IS NOT THE RENT THAT WE DESIRE  
TO CHARGE WHEN UNLESS WE HAVE A 

03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:11.278
IS NOT THE RENT THAT WE DESIRE  
TO CHARGE WHEN UNLESS WE HAVE A 
RENT SUBSIDY AND SO THE TYPE    

03:01:11.280 --> 03:01:11.879
TO CHARGE WHEN UNLESS WE HAVE A 
RENT SUBSIDY AND SO THE TYPE    
OF FINANCING THAT WE PUT        

03:01:11.881 --> 03:01:12.613
RENT SUBSIDY AND SO THE TYPE    
OF FINANCING THAT WE PUT        
TOGETHER DOESN&apos;T PROVIDE A RENT 

03:01:12.615 --> 03:01:15.048
OF FINANCING THAT WE PUT        
TOGETHER DOESN&apos;T PROVIDE A RENT 
SUBSIDY.                        

03:01:15.050 --> 03:01:16.250
TOGETHER DOESN&apos;T PROVIDE A RENT 
SUBSIDY.                        
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THAT IS 

03:01:16.252 --> 03:01:17.050
SUBSIDY.                        
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THAT IS 
WITH SOME KIND OF AN ACTUAL     

03:01:17.052 --> 03:01:19.020
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THAT IS 
WITH SOME KIND OF AN ACTUAL     
VOUCHER TYPE PROGRAM.           

03:01:19.022 --> 03:01:22.556
WITH SOME KIND OF AN ACTUAL     
VOUCHER TYPE PROGRAM.           
SO WE WILL HAVE UNITS THAT WE   

03:01:22.558 --> 03:01:23.324
VOUCHER TYPE PROGRAM.           
SO WE WILL HAVE UNITS THAT WE   
BRING ON LINE THAT WILL BE      

03:01:23.326 --> 03:01:26.494
SO WE WILL HAVE UNITS THAT WE   
BRING ON LINE THAT WILL BE      
AFFORDABLE BUT WE ARE NOT       

03:01:26.496 --> 03:01:27.161
BRING ON LINE THAT WILL BE      
AFFORDABLE BUT WE ARE NOT       
FACING THEM AT THE MAXIMUM      

03:01:27.163 --> 03:01:30.264
AFFORDABLE BUT WE ARE NOT       
FACING THEM AT THE MAXIMUM      
AMOUNT THAT CAN BE GENERATED    

03:01:30.266 --> 03:01:31.165
FACING THEM AT THE MAXIMUM      
AMOUNT THAT CAN BE GENERATED    
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR        

03:01:31.167 --> 03:01:34.602
AMOUNT THAT CAN BE GENERATED    
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR        
HOUSEHOLDS WE&apos;RE TARGETING IN   

03:01:34.604 --> 03:01:37.938
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR        
HOUSEHOLDS WE&apos;RE TARGETING IN   
THE COMMUNITY EVEN AT 60        

03:01:37.940 --> 03:01:38.973

THE COMMUNITY EVEN AT 60        
PERCENT AIMI ONE HUNDRED SIXTY  

03:01:38.975 --> 03:01:42.910
THE COMMUNITY EVEN AT 60        
PERCENT AIMI ONE HUNDRED SIXTY  
HUNDRED A MONTH IS A LOT.       

03:01:42.912 --> 03:01:43.744
PERCENT AIMI ONE HUNDRED SIXTY  
HUNDRED A MONTH IS A LOT.       
SO WE&apos;RE TRYING TO GET UNITS    

03:01:43.746 --> 03:01:45.279
HUNDRED A MONTH IS A LOT.       
SO WE&apos;RE TRYING TO GET UNITS    
PRICED AT MORE THAN THE EIGHT   

03:01:45.281 --> 03:01:46.047
SO WE&apos;RE TRYING TO GET UNITS    
PRICED AT MORE THAN THE EIGHT   
TO A THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE      

03:01:46.049 --> 03:01:46.714
PRICED AT MORE THAN THE EIGHT   
TO A THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE      
WHICH STILL FEELS VERY HIGH.    

03:01:46.716 --> 03:01:52.887
TO A THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE      
WHICH STILL FEELS VERY HIGH.    
&gt;&gt; SO                           

03:02:06.335 --> 03:02:08.302
      THERE&apos;S A LOT
