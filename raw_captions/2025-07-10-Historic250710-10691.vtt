ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE  
FOR A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE AND

00:55:21.603 --> 00:55:22.202
FOR A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE AND

THE ORIGINAL HOUSE, THE         

00:55:22.204 --> 00:55:25.004
COMPATIBILITY IF YOU NOTICED    
THE ORIGINAL HOUSE, THE         
FENESTRATION PATTERN WHERE THE  

00:55:25.006 --> 00:55:25.672
THE ORIGINAL HOUSE, THE         
FENESTRATION PATTERN WHERE THE  
FIRST FLOOR WINDOWS LINE UP

WITH THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS   

00:55:26.408 --> 00:55:29.442
FIRST FLOOR WINDOWS LINE UP     
WITH THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS   
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE 

00:55:29.444 --> 00:55:30.243
WITH THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS   
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE 
WORKED TO TRY AND BRING BACK AT

THE FULL SIDE COMES DOWN AND IT 

00:55:36.318 --> 00:55:40.287

THE FULL SIDE COMES DOWN AND IT 
REALLY I MEAN THIS THIS WAS     

00:55:40.289 --> 00:55:41.154

REALLY I MEAN THIS THIS WAS     
ABOUT MAKING THE SPACE MORE     

00:55:41.156 --> 00:55:44.958
REALLY I MEAN THIS THIS WAS     
ABOUT MAKING THE SPACE MORE     
USABLE AND PART OF IT IS ALSO   

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.428
ABOUT MAKING THE SPACE MORE     
USABLE AND PART OF IT IS ALSO   
THE ORIGINAL SECOND FLOOR       

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:51.999
USABLE AND PART OF IT IS ALSO   
THE ORIGINAL SECOND FLOOR       
ADDITION THAT WAS PUT ON DID    

00:55:52.001 --> 00:55:52.932
THE ORIGINAL SECOND FLOOR       
ADDITION THAT WAS PUT ON DID    
NOT MATCH THE FLOOR HEIGHT      

00:55:52.934 --> 00:55:56.169
ADDITION THAT WAS PUT ON DID    
NOT MATCH THE FLOOR HEIGHT      
UPSTAIRS SO THAT THERE'S NO     

00:55:56.171 --> 00:55:57.004
NOT MATCH THE FLOOR HEIGHT      
UPSTAIRS SO THAT THERE'S NO     
BEDROOM OR CHILD SIZE BEDROOM.  

00:55:57.006 --> 00:56:00.673
UPSTAIRS SO THAT THERE'S NO     
BEDROOM OR CHILD SIZE BEDROOM.  
THERE'S A TWO STAIR DROP IN THE 

00:56:00.675 --> 00:56:04.378
BEDROOM OR CHILD SIZE BEDROOM.  
THERE'S A TWO STAIR DROP IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE BEDROOM AND SO BY 

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.312
THERE'S A TWO STAIR DROP IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE BEDROOM AND SO BY 
BY DOING ANY KIND OF ADDITION   

00:56:05.314 --> 00:56:06.112
MIDDLE OF THE BEDROOM AND SO BY 
BY DOING ANY KIND OF ADDITION   
AND IF YOU NOTICE THE SECOND    

00:56:06.114 --> 00:56:08.648
BY DOING ANY KIND OF ADDITION   
AND IF YOU NOTICE THE SECOND    
THE SECOND FLOOR IS ALMOST      

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:09.382
AND IF YOU NOTICE THE SECOND    
THE SECOND FLOOR IS ALMOST      
WHERE THE PREVIOUS EDITION WAS  

00:56:09.384 --> 00:56:12.252
THE SECOND FLOOR IS ALMOST      
WHERE THE PREVIOUS EDITION WAS  
DONE.                           

00:56:12.254 --> 00:56:13.220
WHERE THE PREVIOUS EDITION WAS  
DONE.                           
SO WE'RE NOT REALLY ADDING TOO  

00:56:13.222 --> 00:56:15.955
DONE.

SO WE'RE NOT REALLY ADDING TOO  
MUCH TO TO THE MACING UPSTAIRS  
BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE'RE  

00:56:17.026 --> 00:56:17.957

BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE'RE  
MAKING IT ONE FLOOR LEVEL WHICH 

00:56:17.959 --> 00:56:20.894
BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE'RE  
MAKING IT ONE FLOOR LEVEL WHICH 
WHETHER IT'S AGING IN PLACE OR  

00:56:20.896 --> 00:56:21.595
MAKING IT ONE FLOOR LEVEL WHICH 
WHETHER IT'S AGING IN PLACE OR  
IT'S JUST SAFETY ISSUES WHERE   

00:56:21.597 --> 00:56:23.931
WHETHER IT'S AGING IN PLACE OR  
IT'S JUST SAFETY ISSUES WHERE   
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAIRS IN A   

00:56:23.933 --> 00:56:24.664
IT'S JUST SAFETY ISSUES WHERE   
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAIRS IN A   
BEDROOM WHERE KIDS CAN KIND

RENDERINGS YOU'RE NOT GETTING   
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CEDAR   
AND HARDY.                      

01:01:35.544 --> 01:01:35.942
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CEDAR

SO BUT IT REALLY IS COMPATABLE  
.                               
SO THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE THE     

01:01:40.415 --> 01:01:44.250
.                               
SO THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE THE     
STANDARDS SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE 

01:01:44.252 --> 01:01:44.851
SO THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE THE     
STANDARDS SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE 
COMPATIBLE AND THEN ALSO        

01:01:44.853 --> 01:01:47.753
STANDARDS SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE 
COMPATIBLE AND THEN ALSO        
OBVIOUSLY THE STANDARDS IS IT   

01:01:47.755 --> 01:01:48.521
COMPATIBLE AND THEN ALSO        
OBVIOUSLY THE STANDARDS IS IT   
IT NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENTIATED.  

01:01:48.523 --> 01:01:51.824
OBVIOUSLY THE STANDARDS IS IT   
IT NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENTIATED.  
SO THAT WAS JUST THE QUESTION   

01:01:51.826 --> 01:01:52.292
IT NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENTIATED.  
SO THAT WAS JUST THE QUESTION   
THAT CAME TO MIND.              

01:01:52.294 --> 01:01:55.094
SO THAT WAS JUST THE QUESTION   
THAT CAME TO MIND.              
IS IT DIFFERENTIATED ENOUGH TO  

01:01:55.096 --> 01:01:59.365
THAT CAME TO MIND.              
IS IT DIFFERENTIATED ENOUGH TO  
TO FOLLOW THE STANDARDS?        

01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:00.700
IS IT DIFFERENTIATED ENOUGH TO  
TO FOLLOW THE STANDARDS?        
AND WHAT I SEE IS THAT THE THE  

01:02:00.702 --> 01:02:02.736
TO FOLLOW THE STANDARDS?        
AND WHAT I SEE IS THAT THE THE  
WINDOWS ARE LIKE PARTICULARLY   

01:02:02.738 --> 01:02:03.336
AND WHAT I SEE IS THAT THE THE  
WINDOWS ARE LIKE PARTICULARLY   
THE SIDE ELEVATION.             

01:02:03.338 --> 01:02:04.204
WINDOWS ARE LIKE PARTICULARLY   
THE SIDE ELEVATION.             
I THINK THAT IS THE MOST        

01:02:04.206 --> 01:02:07.140
THE SIDE ELEVATION.             
I THINK THAT IS THE MOST        
IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT LIKE 

01:02:07.142 --> 01:02:10.743
I THINK THAT IS THE MOST        
IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT LIKE 
THE THE WINDOW SIZES AND AT     

01:02:10.745 --> 01:02:14.080
IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT LIKE 
THE THE WINDOW SIZES AND AT     
LEAST THE FIRST TWO ARE OK SO   

01:02:14.082 --> 01:02:18.518
THE THE WINDOW SIZES AND AT     
LEAST THE FIRST TWO ARE OK SO   
THE SIZES ARE DIFFERENT SIMILAR 

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.119
LEAST THE FIRST TWO ARE OK SO   
THE SIZES ARE DIFFERENT SIMILAR 
BUT DIFFERENT AND THEY'RE       

01:02:19.121 --> 01:02:21.420
THE SIZES ARE DIFFERENT SIMILAR 
BUT DIFFERENT AND THEY'RE       
CASEMENT'S INSTEAD OF DOUBLE    

01:02:21.422 --> 01:02:22.222
BUT DIFFERENT AND THEY'RE       
CASEMENT'S INSTEAD OF DOUBLE    
THERE'S ALSO DOUBLE HUNG BUT    

01:02:22.224 --> 01:02:26.026
CASEMENT'S INSTEAD OF DOUBLE    
THERE'S ALSO DOUBLE HUNG BUT    
IT'S A MIX I GUESS THE YEAH     

01:02:26.028 --> 01:02:30.230
THERE'S ALSO DOUBLE HUNG BUT    
IT'S A MIX I GUESS THE YEAH     
LIKE SO YOU KNOW AND SO IS      

01:02:30.232 --> 01:02:33.867
IT'S A MIX I GUESS THE YEAH     
LIKE SO YOU KNOW AND SO IS      
MATCHING THE SOME OF THE I      

01:02:33.869 --> 01:02:34.667
LIKE SO YOU KNOW AND SO IS      
MATCHING THE SOME OF THE I      
GUESS THERE'S FOUR OVER FOURS   

01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:37.804
MATCHING THE SOME OF THE I      
GUESS THERE'S FOUR OVER FOURS   
AND THEN THERE ARE SOME FORWARD 

01:02:37.806 --> 01:02:38.671
GUESS THERE'S FOUR OVER FOURS   
AND THEN THERE ARE SOME FORWARD 
FOURS BUT IT'S GOING TO BE      

01:02:38.673 --> 01:02:41.707
AND THEN THERE ARE SOME FORWARD 
FOURS BUT IT'S GOING TO BE      
SIMULATED DIVIDED.              

01:02:41.709 --> 01:02:42.775
FOURS BUT IT'S GOING TO BE      
SIMULATED DIVIDED.              
>> RIGHT SO I SUPPOSE IF YOU IF 

01:02:42.777 --> 01:02:45.845
SIMULATED DIVIDED.              
>> RIGHT SO I SUPPOSE IF YOU IF 
YOU GO TAKE A LOOK IT'S JUST    

01:02:45.847 --> 01:02:46.579
>> RIGHT SO I SUPPOSE IF YOU IF 
YOU GO TAKE A LOOK IT'S JUST    
RIGHT ON THE EDGE AND THEN      

01:02:46.581 --> 01:02:49.182
YOU GO TAKE A LOOK IT'S JUST    
RIGHT ON THE EDGE AND THEN      
OBVIOUSLY THE GENTLE DETAIL IS  

01:02:49.184 --> 01:02:52.919
RIGHT ON THE EDGE AND THEN      
OBVIOUSLY THE GENTLE DETAIL IS  
IS LIKE DECIDING IT'S MATCHING  

01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:56.422
OBVIOUSLY THE GENTLE DETAIL IS  
IS LIKE DECIDING IT'S MATCHING  
BUT WITH A DIFFERENT MATERIAL   

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:57.590
IS LIKE DECIDING IT'S MATCHING  
BUT WITH A DIFFERENT MATERIAL   
WHICH I FEEL AND THE TRIM IS    

01:02:57.592 --> 01:02:58.024
BUT WITH A DIFFERENT MATERIAL   
WHICH I FEEL AND THE TRIM IS    
THE SAME WAY.                   

01:02:58.026 --> 01:03:01.294
WHICH I FEEL AND THE TRIM IS    
THE SAME WAY.                   
SO I THINK IT'S TEETERING RIGHT 

01:03:01.296 --> 01:03:04.363
THE SAME WAY.                   
SO I THINK IT'S TEETERING RIGHT 
ON THE EDGE OF DIFFERENTIATION  

01:03:04.365 --> 01:03:07.800
SO I THINK IT'S TEETERING RIGHT 
ON THE EDGE OF DIFFERENTIATION  
BUT WE HAVE ALLOWED THE         

01:03:07.802 --> 01:03:08.401
ON THE EDGE OF DIFFERENTIATION  
BUT WE HAVE ALLOWED THE         
MATERIAL TO BE THE              

01:03:08.403 --> 01:03:08.935
BUT WE HAVE ALLOWED THE         
MATERIAL TO BE THE              
DIFFERENTIATOR.                 

01:03:08.937 --> 01:03:12.038
MATERIAL TO BE THE              
DIFFERENTIATOR.                 
SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S IT'S        

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:12.838
DIFFERENTIATOR.                 
SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S IT'S        
TEETERING ON THE EDGE THERE.    

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:19.712
SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S IT'S        
TEETERING ON THE EDGE THERE.    
BUT IT IS IT IS KIND OF MAKING  

01:03:19.714 --> 01:03:22.949
TEETERING ON THE EDGE THERE.    
BUT IT IS IT IS KIND OF MAKING  
IT BECAUSE IT'S USING DIFFERENT 

01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:23.884
BUT IT IS IT IS KIND OF MAKING  
IT BECAUSE IT'S USING DIFFERENT 
MATERIALS BUT YOU KNOW, IT IS   

01:03:23.886 --> 01:03:27.219
IT BECAUSE IT'S USING DIFFERENT 
MATERIALS BUT YOU KNOW, IT IS   
ON THE EDGE SO WHAT DO YOU      

01:03:27.221 --> 01:03:28.021
MATERIALS BUT YOU KNOW, IT IS   
ON THE EDGE SO WHAT DO YOU      
THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW, AS   

01:03:28.023 --> 01:03:31.724
ON THE EDGE SO WHAT DO YOU      
THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW, AS   
PROPOSED IS WITH MATCHING TRIM  

01:03:31.726 --> 01:03:34.928
THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW, AS   
PROPOSED IS WITH MATCHING TRIM  
THE TWIN TRIM.

PROPOSED IS WITH MATCHING TRIM  
THE TWIN TRIM.                  
SO I THINK WE NEED TO TO AMEND  

01:03:36.431 --> 01:03:39.465
THE TWIN TRIM.                  
SO I THINK WE NEED TO TO AMEND  
THE MOTION SO THAT INDICATES    

01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:43.035
SO I THINK WE NEED TO TO AMEND  
THE MOTION SO THAT INDICATES

THE MOTION SO THAT INDICATES    
THAT MATCHING TWIN TRIM WOULD   
NOT BE BUT IS IN A MATCHING

01:04:27.983 --> 01:04:28.981
NEED TO ALSO DIFFERENTIATE WITH

WELL IT'S ONE WHOLE PACKAGE     

01:04:28.983 --> 01:04:29.782
THE SIZE OF THE OF THE TRIM.    
WELL IT'S ONE WHOLE PACKAGE     
BASICALLY BUT THERE'S A LOT
