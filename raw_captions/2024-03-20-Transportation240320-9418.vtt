IT WHEN WE GOT THE PETITION     
THEY DIDN&apos;T SPECIFY WHICH SIDE

IT WHEN WE GOT THE PETITION     
THEY DIDN&apos;T SPECIFY WHICH SIDE  
OF THE ROAD THEY WANTED IT ON   

00:12:00.925 --> 00:12:03.993
THEY DIDN&apos;T SPECIFY WHICH SIDE  
OF THE ROAD THEY WANTED IT ON

COVER ONE SIDE.                 

00:12:07.765 --> 00:12:08.865
THE SIPI FOR IT WOULD ONLY      
COVER ONE SIDE.                 
SO IN THE FUTURE THE PRIORITY   

00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:11.100

SO IN THE FUTURE THE PRIORITY   
LEVEL OF THE WEST SIDE OF THE

SO IN THE FUTURE THE PRIORITY   
LEVEL OF THE WEST SIDE OF THE

WONDERING ABOUT THE DECISION TO 
ONLY DO THE SIDEWALK ON ONE     

00:13:36.387 --> 00:13:37.119
WONDERING ABOUT THE DECISION TO 
ONLY DO THE SIDEWALK ON ONE     
SIDE LIKE REALISTICALLY WHEN WE 

00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:41.890
ONLY DO THE SIDEWALK ON ONE     
SIDE LIKE REALISTICALLY WHEN WE 
COME BACK FROM AND PUT THAT IN  

00:13:41.892 --> 00:13:43.025
SIDE LIKE REALISTICALLY WHEN WE 
COME BACK FROM AND PUT THAT IN  
,IT WILL LIKELY BE A LONG TIME  

00:13:43.027 --> 00:13:46.162
COME BACK FROM AND PUT THAT IN  
,IT WILL LIKELY BE A LONG TIME  
BEFORE WE COME BACK.            

00:13:46.164 --> 00:13:47.162
,IT WILL LIKELY BE A LONG TIME  
BEFORE WE COME BACK.            
BUT THE SIDEWALK ON THE OTHER   

00:13:47.164 --> 00:13:47.897
BEFORE WE COME BACK.            
BUT THE SIDEWALK ON THE OTHER   
SIDE BECAUSE I MEAN WE HAVE     

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:48.498
BUT THE SIDEWALK ON THE OTHER   
SIDE BECAUSE I MEAN WE HAVE     
MANY, MANY, MANY MILES

SIDE BECAUSE I MEAN WE HAVE     
MANY, MANY, MANY MILES          
OF SIDEWALK THROUGHOUT THE CITY 

00:13:50.568 --> 00:13:54.737
MANY, MANY, MANY MILES          
OF SIDEWALK THROUGHOUT THE CITY 
TO DO AND YOU KNOW, I COULDN&apos;T  

00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:55.538
OF SIDEWALK THROUGHOUT THE CITY 
TO DO AND YOU KNOW, I COULDN&apos;T  
PREDICT WHEN WE WOULD BE BACK

UM, I GUESS MY MY SENSE ON THIS 

00:14:02.113 --> 00:14:05.714
HERE.                           
UM, I GUESS MY MY SENSE ON THIS 
IS THAT WE HAVE A STANDARD      

00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:06.449
UM, I GUESS MY MY SENSE ON THIS 
IS THAT WE HAVE A STANDARD      
WHICH IS COMPLETE COMPLETE      

00:14:06.451 --> 00:14:09.985
IS THAT WE HAVE A STANDARD      
WHICH IS COMPLETE COMPLETE      
STREETS THAT THAT HAS SIDEWALK  

00:14:09.987 --> 00:14:13.422
WHICH IS COMPLETE COMPLETE      
STREETS THAT THAT HAS SIDEWALK  
ON BOTH SIDES AND WHEN WE       

00:14:13.424 --> 00:14:14.256
STREETS THAT THAT HAS SIDEWALK  
ON BOTH SIDES AND WHEN WE       
DEVIATE FROM THAT STANDARD IT   

00:14:14.258 --> 00:14:17.693
ON BOTH SIDES AND WHEN WE       
DEVIATE FROM THAT STANDARD IT   
IT BECOMES THAT MUCH MORE       

00:14:17.695 --> 00:14:21.397
DEVIATE FROM THAT STANDARD IT   
IT BECOMES THAT MUCH MORE       
DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE AND FOUND  

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:25.668
IT BECOMES THAT MUCH MORE       
DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE AND FOUND  
IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DON&apos;T    

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.201
DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE AND FOUND  
IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DON&apos;T    
WANT SIDEWALKS.                 

00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:29.805
IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DON&apos;T    
WANT SIDEWALKS.                 
I IMAGINE THAT THIS WILL BE     

00:14:29.807 --> 00:14:30.572
WANT SIDEWALKS.                 
I IMAGINE THAT THIS WILL BE     
OFFERED UP AS AN EXAMPLE BUT A  

00:14:30.574 --> 00:14:33.242
I IMAGINE THAT THIS WILL BE     
OFFERED UP AS AN EXAMPLE BUT A  
WAY TO DO A COMPROMISE EVEN     

00:14:33.244 --> 00:14:34.310
OFFERED UP AS AN EXAMPLE BUT A  
WAY TO DO A COMPROMISE EVEN

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.954
AWAY HERE THE VERY DARK LINE    
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE SOME  
OF THEIR LANDSCAPING BECAUSE    

00:16:58.956 --> 00:16:59.655
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE SOME  
OF THEIR LANDSCAPING BECAUSE    
ORIGINALLY WE WERE GOING TO PUT 

00:16:59.657 --> 00:17:01.857
OF THEIR LANDSCAPING BECAUSE    
ORIGINALLY WE WERE GOING TO PUT 
THE SIDEWALK RIGHT WHERE THAT   

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:03.026
ORIGINALLY WE WERE GOING TO PUT 
THE SIDEWALK RIGHT WHERE THAT   
LINE IS IN FACT TO TAKE OUT A   

00:17:03.028 --> 00:17:09.232
THE SIDEWALK RIGHT WHERE THAT   
LINE IS IN FACT TO TAKE OUT A   
LOT MORE                        

00:17:09.667 --> 00:17:15.137
        .                       
&gt;&gt; BUT PART OF THE PART OF THIS 
COMES DOWN TO WE HAVE VERY      

00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:17.372
&gt;&gt; BUT PART OF THE PART OF THIS 
COMES DOWN TO WE HAVE VERY      
LIMITED FUNDS TO THE SIDEWALK   

00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:18.141
COMES DOWN TO WE HAVE VERY      
LIMITED FUNDS TO THE SIDEWALK   
MILLAGE AND WE CAN YOU KNOW, WE 

00:17:18.143 --> 00:17:21.276
LIMITED FUNDS TO THE SIDEWALK   
MILLAGE AND WE CAN YOU KNOW, WE 
CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH EACH YEAR   

00:17:21.278 --> 00:17:22.044
MILLAGE AND WE CAN YOU KNOW, WE 
CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH EACH YEAR   
WITH THE WITH THE MONEY THAT WE 

00:17:22.046 --> 00:17:22.445
CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH EACH YEAR   
WITH THE WITH THE MONEY THAT WE 
HAVE AVAILABLE.                 

00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:26.115
WITH THE WITH THE MONEY THAT WE 
HAVE AVAILABLE.                 
SO I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IS IT IS   

00:17:26.117 --> 00:17:29.151
HAVE AVAILABLE.                 
SO I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IS IT IS   
IT BETTER TO BUILD A SIDEWALK   

00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:29.952
SO I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IS IT IS   
IT BETTER TO BUILD A SIDEWALK   
ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS VERY      

00:17:29.954 --> 00:17:33.355
IT BETTER TO BUILD A SIDEWALK   
ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS VERY      
SMALL RESIDENTIAL STREET OR IS  

00:17:33.357 --> 00:17:34.022
ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS VERY      
SMALL RESIDENTIAL STREET OR IS  
IT BETTER TO BUILD MORE         

00:17:34.024 --> 00:17:36.893
SMALL RESIDENTIAL STREET OR IS  
IT BETTER TO BUILD MORE         
SIDEWALKS AND MORE PLACES BUT   

00:17:36.895 --> 00:17:37.493
IT BETTER TO BUILD MORE         
SIDEWALKS AND MORE PLACES BUT   
FUNDING IS LIMITED?             

00:17:37.495 --> 00:17:41.197
SIDEWALKS AND MORE PLACES BUT   
FUNDING IS LIMITED?             
SO I MEAN THAT THAT&apos;S PART      

00:17:41.199 --> 00:17:41.864
FUNDING IS LIMITED?             
SO I MEAN THAT THAT&apos;S PART      
OF THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.           

00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:45.333
SO I MEAN THAT THAT&apos;S PART      
OF THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.           
THE IMPACTS OF BUILDING THE     

00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:46.002
OF THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.           
THE IMPACTS OF BUILDING THE     
SIDEWALK ARE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL. 

00:17:46.004 --> 00:17:46.735
THE IMPACTS OF BUILDING THE     
SIDEWALK ARE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL. 
THAT&apos;S WHY WE&apos;RE MOVING THE     

00:17:46.737 --> 00:17:49.505
SIDEWALK ARE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL. 
THAT&apos;S WHY WE&apos;RE MOVING THE     
SIDEWALK ON THE EAST SIDE TO    

00:17:49.507 --> 00:17:52.007
THAT&apos;S WHY WE&apos;RE MOVING THE     
SIDEWALK ON THE EAST SIDE TO    
TRY TO CREATE MORE SPACE TO     

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:53.042
SIDEWALK ON THE EAST SIDE TO    
TRY TO CREATE MORE SPACE TO     
BUILD THE SIDEWALK ON THE EAST  

00:17:53.044 --> 00:17:56.778
TRY TO CREATE MORE SPACE TO     
BUILD THE SIDEWALK ON THE EAST  
SIDE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE  

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.082
BUILD THE SIDEWALK ON THE EAST  
SIDE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE  
YOU KNOW, PROBABLY SOMETHING    

00:18:00.084 --> 00:18:00.916
SIDE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE  
YOU KNOW, PROBABLY SOMETHING    
SIMILAR DONE ON THE WEST SIDE

YOU KNOW, PROBABLY SOMETHING    
SIMILAR DONE ON THE WEST SIDE   
IN ORDER TO BUILD THE SIDEWALK  

00:18:01.852 --> 00:18:04.786
SIMILAR DONE ON THE WEST SIDE   
IN ORDER TO BUILD THE SIDEWALK  
WHICH DOESN&apos;T LEAVE A WHOLE LOT 

00:18:04.788 --> 00:18:05.387
IN ORDER TO BUILD THE SIDEWALK  
WHICH DOESN&apos;T LEAVE A WHOLE LOT 
OF ROAD LEFT EITHER.            

00:18:05.389 --> 00:18:08.690
WHICH DOESN&apos;T LEAVE A WHOLE LOT 
OF ROAD LEFT EITHER.            
BUT THERE&apos;S GOING TO BE CASES   

00:18:08.692 --> 00:18:09.324
OF ROAD LEFT EITHER.            
BUT THERE&apos;S GOING TO BE CASES   
WHERE WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE         

00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:12.127
BUT THERE&apos;S GOING TO BE CASES   
WHERE WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE         
BRINGING SIDEWALK GAP FILLING   

00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:12.894
WHERE WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE         
BRINGING SIDEWALK GAP FILLING   
PROJECTS FORWARD WHERE FOR THE

SIDEWALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE     

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.699
TIME BEING WE&apos;RE ONLY BUILDING  
SIDEWALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE     
STREET BECAUSE THE COST         

00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:20.569
SIDEWALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE     
STREET BECAUSE THE COST         
OF BUILDING TWO SIDES IS SO     

00:18:20.571 --> 00:18:23.305
STREET BECAUSE THE COST         
OF BUILDING TWO SIDES IS SO     
GREAT THAT YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO 

00:18:23.307 --> 00:18:24.172
OF BUILDING TWO SIDES IS SO     
GREAT THAT YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO 
KIND OF PICK AND CHOOSE SOME    

00:18:24.174 --> 00:18:24.840
GREAT THAT YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO 
KIND OF PICK AND CHOOSE SOME    
DEGREE IF WE HAD UNLIMITED      

00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:28.043
KIND OF PICK AND CHOOSE SOME    
DEGREE IF WE HAD UNLIMITED      
FUNDING WE&apos;D BE BUILDING IT ON  

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:28.444
DEGREE IF WE HAD UNLIMITED      
FUNDING WE&apos;D BE BUILDING IT ON  
BOTH SIDES HERE.                

00:18:28.446 --> 00:18:31.347
FUNDING WE&apos;D BE BUILDING IT ON  
BOTH SIDES HERE.                
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.                  

00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:32.481

I JUST WANT TO INTERJECT I DID  
WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THIS RIGHT 
AWAY IS NARROW IN MOST IT&apos;S     

00:18:39.523 --> 00:18:40.255
WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THIS RIGHT

FORTY FEET VERSUS MARYLAND      
SIXTY SIX FEET.                 
WE DID GET A LIKE A VARIANCE TO

SIXTY SIX FEET.                 
WE DID GET A LIKE A VARIANCE TO 
PUT THE SIDEWALK HERE RIGHT     

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.129
WE DID GET A LIKE A VARIANCE TO 
PUT THE SIDEWALK HERE RIGHT     
AGAINST THE BACK OF CURB        

00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:50.599
PUT THE SIDEWALK HERE RIGHT     
AGAINST THE BACK OF CURB        
BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION TEAM 

00:18:50.601 --> 00:18:51.266
AGAINST THE BACK OF CURB        
BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION TEAM 
DIDN&apos;T BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS   

00:18:51.268 --> 00:18:54.470
BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION TEAM 
DIDN&apos;T BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS   
GOING TO BE A NEED FOR ANY

DIDN&apos;T BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS   
GOING TO BE A NEED FOR ANY      
SIGNS IN THAT LOCATION IF WE    

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:56.038
GOING TO BE A NEED FOR ANY      
SIGNS IN THAT LOCATION IF WE    
WERE TO DO IT ON THE WEST SIDE  

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.674
SIGNS IN THAT LOCATION IF WE    
WERE TO DO IT ON THE WEST SIDE  
IN THE FUTURE WE EITHER HAVE TO

WERE TO DO IT ON THE WEST SIDE  
IN THE FUTURE WE EITHER HAVE TO 
DO IN THE SAME WAY WHICH I

OVERVIEW OF OUR CONSTRUCTION    
PROJECTS FOR THIS YEAR.         
WE WILL GET INTO SOME OF THE    

00:25:35.206 --> 00:25:36.004
PROJECTS FOR THIS YEAR.         
WE WILL GET INTO SOME OF THE    
SPECIFICS BUT I WANT TO START   

00:25:36.006 --> 00:25:36.605
WE WILL GET INTO SOME OF THE    
SPECIFICS BUT I WANT TO START   
BY COVERING SOME OF THE         

00:25:36.607 --> 00:25:37.338
SPECIFICS BUT I WANT TO START   
BY COVERING SOME OF THE         
BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW ABOUT   

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.140
BY COVERING SOME OF THE         
BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW ABOUT   
ABOUT PAVEMENT IMPROVEMENT

BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW ABOUT   
ABOUT PAVEMENT IMPROVEMENT      
PROJECTS IN GENERAL STARTING    

00:25:39.209 --> 00:25:39.975
ABOUT PAVEMENT IMPROVEMENT      
PROJECTS IN GENERAL STARTING    
WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES        

00:25:39.977 --> 00:25:43.245
PROJECTS IN GENERAL STARTING    
WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES        
OF RESURFACING TYPE TREATMENTS  

00:25:43.247 --> 00:25:47.148
WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES        
OF RESURFACING TYPE TREATMENTS  
THAT WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT THE    

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:47.916
OF RESURFACING TYPE TREATMENTS  
THAT WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT THE    
AND THEY FALL INTO THREE        

00:25:47.918 --> 00:25:48.450
THAT WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT THE    
AND THEY FALL INTO THREE        
GENERAL CATEGORIES.             

00:25:48.452 --> 00:25:50.852
AND THEY FALL INTO THREE        
GENERAL CATEGORIES.             
THE FIRST ONE IS PRESERVATION   

00:25:50.854 --> 00:25:55.024
GENERAL CATEGORIES.             
THE FIRST ONE IS PRESERVATION   
AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE CAPITAL 

00:25:55.026 --> 00:25:58.494
THE FIRST ONE IS PRESERVATION   
AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE CAPITAL 
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE TYPE   

00:25:58.496 --> 00:25:58.961
AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE CAPITAL 
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE TYPE   
PROJECTS.                       

00:25:58.963 --> 00:25:59.561
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE TYPE   
PROJECTS.                       
THOSE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE     

00:25:59.563 --> 00:26:02.263
PROJECTS.                       
THOSE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE     
LIKE CAPE SEALE&apos;S SURFACE       

00:26:02.265 --> 00:26:02.698
THOSE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE     
LIKE CAPE SEALE&apos;S SURFACE       
TREATMENTS.                     

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.398
LIKE CAPE SEALE&apos;S SURFACE       
TREATMENTS.                     
THEY&apos;RE BASICALLY IMPROVEMENTS  

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.602
TREATMENTS.                     
THEY&apos;RE BASICALLY IMPROVEMENTS  
THAT ARE DONE ON ROADS THAT ARE 

00:26:06.604 --> 00:26:07.336
THEY&apos;RE BASICALLY IMPROVEMENTS  
THAT ARE DONE ON ROADS THAT ARE 
INTO BETTER CONDITION TO        

00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:08.069
THAT ARE DONE ON ROADS THAT ARE 
INTO BETTER CONDITION TO        
MAINTAIN THEM IN THOSE IN THAT  

00:26:08.071 --> 00:26:10.873
INTO BETTER CONDITION TO        
MAINTAIN THEM IN THOSE IN THAT  
GOOD CONDITION AND IT GENERALLY 

00:26:10.875 --> 00:26:11.673
MAINTAIN THEM IN THOSE IN THAT  
GOOD CONDITION AND IT GENERALLY 
IS SOMETHING THAT&apos;S ADDED ONTO  

00:26:11.675 --> 00:26:14.576
GOOD CONDITION AND IT GENERALLY 
IS SOMETHING THAT&apos;S ADDED ONTO  
THE EXISTING SURFACE WITHOUT    

00:26:14.578 --> 00:26:15.510
IS SOMETHING THAT&apos;S ADDED ONTO  
THE EXISTING SURFACE WITHOUT    
REALLY TEARING UP THE EXISTING  

00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:18.313
THE EXISTING SURFACE WITHOUT    
REALLY TEARING UP THE EXISTING  
SURFACE.                        

00:26:18.315 --> 00:26:19.247
REALLY TEARING UP THE EXISTING  
SURFACE.                        
WE&apos;RE GOING TO FOCUS TONIGHT A  

00:26:19.249 --> 00:26:20.148
SURFACE.                        
WE&apos;RE GOING TO FOCUS TONIGHT A  
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SECOND   

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.151
WE&apos;RE GOING TO FOCUS TONIGHT A  
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SECOND   
TO THE NEXT LEVEL UP FROM THAT  

00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:25.487
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SECOND   
TO THE NEXT LEVEL UP FROM THAT  
IS WHAT WE CALL A RESTORATION.  

00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:29.224
TO THE NEXT LEVEL UP FROM THAT  
IS WHAT WE CALL A RESTORATION.  
THAT&apos;S WHERE WE REMOVE PART     

00:26:29.226 --> 00:26:30.058
IS WHAT WE CALL A RESTORATION.  
THAT&apos;S WHERE WE REMOVE PART     
OF THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT MAYBE   

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.194
THAT&apos;S WHERE WE REMOVE PART     
OF THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT MAYBE   
ONLY MILL DOWN PORTION OF IT    

00:26:33.196 --> 00:26:34.263
OF THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT MAYBE   
ONLY MILL DOWN PORTION OF IT    
AND THEN REPAVE A NEW SURFACE   

00:26:34.265 --> 00:26:34.796
ONLY MILL DOWN PORTION OF IT    
AND THEN REPAVE A NEW SURFACE   
ON TOP OF THAT.                 

00:26:34.798 --> 00:26:36.865
AND THEN REPAVE A NEW SURFACE   
ON TOP OF THAT.                 
SO THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S USUALLY JUST   

00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:40.668
ON TOP OF THAT.                 
SO THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S USUALLY JUST   
DEALING WITH THE PAVEMENT.      

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:41.603
SO THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S USUALLY JUST   
DEALING WITH THE PAVEMENT.      
NOT A LOT OF THE OTHER          

00:26:41.605 --> 00:26:42.404
DEALING WITH THE PAVEMENT.      
NOT A LOT OF THE OTHER          
ANCILLARY THINGS ALTHOUGH WE    

00:26:42.406 --> 00:26:44.506
NOT A LOT OF THE OTHER          
ANCILLARY THINGS ALTHOUGH WE    
WILL DO THINGS LIKE DRAINS AND  

00:26:44.508 --> 00:26:45.107
ANCILLARY THINGS ALTHOUGH WE    
WILL DO THINGS LIKE DRAINS AND  
STUFF LIKE THAT.                

00:26:45.109 --> 00:26:48.110
WILL DO THINGS LIKE DRAINS AND  
STUFF LIKE THAT.                
THE THIRD ONE UP IS WHAT WE     

00:26:48.112 --> 00:26:49.044
STUFF LIKE THAT.                
THE THIRD ONE UP IS WHAT WE     
WOULD CALL A REHABILITATION AND 

00:26:49.046 --> 00:26:49.844
THE THIRD ONE UP IS WHAT WE     
WOULD CALL A REHABILITATION AND 
THAT&apos;S WHERE THE PAVEMENT HAS   

00:26:49.846 --> 00:26:53.015
WOULD CALL A REHABILITATION AND 
THAT&apos;S WHERE THE PAVEMENT HAS   
DEGRADED SUCH A POINT WHERE YOU 

00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:53.815
THAT&apos;S WHERE THE PAVEMENT HAS   
DEGRADED SUCH A POINT WHERE YOU 
REALLY CAN&apos;T DO ANYTHING ELSE   

00:26:53.817 --> 00:26:56.484
DEGRADED SUCH A POINT WHERE YOU 
REALLY CAN&apos;T DO ANYTHING ELSE   
WITH THAT OTHER THAN COMPLETELY 

00:26:56.486 --> 00:26:57.152
REALLY CAN&apos;T DO ANYTHING ELSE   
WITH THAT OTHER THAN COMPLETELY 
REMOVING THAT ASPHALT AND       

00:26:57.154 --> 00:26:57.820
WITH THAT OTHER THAN COMPLETELY 
REMOVING THAT ASPHALT AND       
REPAVING THE WHOLE YOU KNOW,    

00:26:57.822 --> 00:27:00.889
REMOVING THAT ASPHALT AND       
REPAVING THE WHOLE YOU KNOW,    
THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT.           

00:27:00.891 --> 00:27:01.956
REPAVING THE WHOLE YOU KNOW,    
THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT.           
THERE IS A FOURTH YEAR WHICH    

00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:05.126
THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT.           
THERE IS A FOURTH YEAR WHICH    
WOULD WHAT WE WOULD CALL A      

00:27:05.128 --> 00:27:05.527
THERE IS A FOURTH YEAR WHICH    
WOULD WHAT WE WOULD CALL A      
RECONSTRUCTION.                 

00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:06.328
WOULD WHAT WE WOULD CALL A      
RECONSTRUCTION.                 
WE DON&apos;T USE THOSE VERY MUCH    

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.263
RECONSTRUCTION.                 
WE DON&apos;T USE THOSE VERY MUCH    
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY COSTLY    

00:27:08.265 --> 00:27:11.733
WE DON&apos;T USE THOSE VERY MUCH    
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY COSTLY    
AND IN A RECONSTRUCTION ARE     

00:27:11.735 --> 00:27:12.534
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY COSTLY    
AND IN A RECONSTRUCTION ARE     
REALLY TEARING UP EVERYTHING    

00:27:12.536 --> 00:27:13.301
AND IN A RECONSTRUCTION ARE     
REALLY TEARING UP EVERYTHING    
YOU&apos;RE GOING DOWN INTO THE BASE 

00:27:13.303 --> 00:27:15.637
REALLY TEARING UP EVERYTHING    
YOU&apos;RE GOING DOWN INTO THE BASE 
YOU&apos;RE TEARING OUT USUALLY CURB 

00:27:15.639 --> 00:27:16.505
YOU&apos;RE GOING DOWN INTO THE BASE 
YOU&apos;RE TEARING OUT USUALLY CURB 
AND GUTTER AND THOSE ARE MUCH   

00:27:16.507 --> 00:27:20.008
YOU&apos;RE TEARING OUT USUALLY CURB 
AND GUTTER AND THOSE ARE MUCH   
MORE MAJOR PROJECTS AND ALSO    

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:20.442
AND GUTTER AND THOSE ARE MUCH   
MORE MAJOR PROJECTS AND ALSO    
QUITE COSTLY.                   

00:27:20.444 --> 00:27:21.443
MORE MAJOR PROJECTS AND ALSO    
QUITE COSTLY.                   
SO WHY DO WE USE ALL THESE      

00:27:21.445 --> 00:27:23.678
QUITE COSTLY.                   
SO WHY DO WE USE ALL THESE      
DIFFERENT TREATMENTS?           

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.613
SO WHY DO WE USE ALL THESE      
DIFFERENT TREATMENTS?           
IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO         

00:27:24.615 --> 00:27:27.382
DIFFERENT TREATMENTS?           
IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO         
PAVEMENT ASSET MANAGEMENT AND   

00:27:27.384 --> 00:27:28.316
IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO         
PAVEMENT ASSET MANAGEMENT AND   
THERE&apos;S A LINK HERE IN THE      

00:27:28.318 --> 00:27:29.084
PAVEMENT ASSET MANAGEMENT AND   
THERE&apos;S A LINK HERE IN THE      
PRESENTATION THAT WILL BRING IN 

00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:32.354
THERE&apos;S A LINK HERE IN THE      
PRESENTATION THAT WILL BRING IN 
ONE OF OUR WEB PAGES THAT TALKS 

00:27:32.356 --> 00:27:33.121
PRESENTATION THAT WILL BRING IN 
ONE OF OUR WEB PAGES THAT TALKS 
ABOUT THAT AND A LOT MORE       

00:27:33.123 --> 00:27:35.457
ONE OF OUR WEB PAGES THAT TALKS 
ABOUT THAT AND A LOT MORE       
DETAIL WHICH I&apos;M NOT GOING TO   

00:27:35.459 --> 00:27:36.325
ABOUT THAT AND A LOT MORE       
DETAIL WHICH I&apos;M NOT GOING TO   
GO INTO THAT MUCH DETAIL HERE   

00:27:36.327 --> 00:27:39.194
DETAIL WHICH I&apos;M NOT GOING TO   
GO INTO THAT MUCH DETAIL HERE   
TONIGHT BUT WHAT IT REALLY      

00:27:39.196 --> 00:27:39.994
GO INTO THAT MUCH DETAIL HERE   
TONIGHT BUT WHAT IT REALLY      
COMES DOWN TO IS USING THE      

00:27:39.996 --> 00:27:40.662
TONIGHT BUT WHAT IT REALLY      
COMES DOWN TO IS USING THE      
RIGHT FIX FOR THE RIGHT STREET  

00:27:40.664 --> 00:27:43.232
COMES DOWN TO IS USING THE      
RIGHT FIX FOR THE RIGHT STREET  
AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THAT&apos;S    

00:27:43.234 --> 00:27:46.434
RIGHT FIX FOR THE RIGHT STREET  
AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THAT&apos;S    
HOW WE REALLY THAT PHILOSOPHY   

00:27:46.436 --> 00:27:47.769
AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THAT&apos;S    
HOW WE REALLY THAT PHILOSOPHY   
IS REALLY HOW WE MOVE THAT THE  

00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:51.039
HOW WE REALLY THAT PHILOSOPHY   
IS REALLY HOW WE MOVE THAT THE  
OVERALL CONDITION OF OUR SYSTEM 

00:27:51.041 --> 00:27:54.610
IS REALLY HOW WE MOVE THAT THE  
OVERALL CONDITION OF OUR SYSTEM 
FORWARD.                        

00:27:54.612 --> 00:27:59.481
OVERALL CONDITION OF OUR SYSTEM 
FORWARD.                        
OK, NEXT WANTED TO LOOK AT SOME 

00:27:59.483 --> 00:28:00.148
FORWARD.                        
OK, NEXT WANTED TO LOOK AT SOME 
OF WHAT THE CORE ELEMENTS       

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.217
OK, NEXT WANTED TO LOOK AT SOME 
OF WHAT THE CORE ELEMENTS       
OF THESE TYPE OF TREATMENTS ARE 

00:28:02.219 --> 00:28:06.555
OF WHAT THE CORE ELEMENTS       
OF THESE TYPE OF TREATMENTS ARE 
SO THE KEY THING OBVIOUSLY IS   

00:28:06.557 --> 00:28:07.155
OF THESE TYPE OF TREATMENTS ARE 
SO THE KEY THING OBVIOUSLY IS   
TO REPAIR THAT EXISTING         

00:28:07.157 --> 00:28:10.025
SO THE KEY THING OBVIOUSLY IS   
TO REPAIR THAT EXISTING         
PAVEMENT SURFACE EITHER REPAIR  

00:28:10.027 --> 00:28:10.859
TO REPAIR THAT EXISTING         
PAVEMENT SURFACE EITHER REPAIR  
OR REPLACE THAT SURFACE SO THAT 

00:28:10.861 --> 00:28:14.095
PAVEMENT SURFACE EITHER REPAIR  
OR REPLACE THAT SURFACE SO THAT 
WE GET A NICE FLAT SMOOTH NEW   

00:28:14.097 --> 00:28:14.329
OR REPLACE THAT SURFACE SO THAT 
WE GET A NICE FLAT SMOOTH NEW   
ROAD.                           

00:28:14.331 --> 00:28:17.266
WE GET A NICE FLAT SMOOTH NEW   
ROAD.                           
WE DO INCLUDE SOME CURB         

00:28:17.268 --> 00:28:18.066
ROAD.                           
WE DO INCLUDE SOME CURB         
REPLACEMENT AS NEEDED THAT&apos;S    

00:28:18.068 --> 00:28:21.036
WE DO INCLUDE SOME CURB         
REPLACEMENT AS NEEDED THAT&apos;S    
MOSTLY IN THOSE REHABILITATIONS 

00:28:21.038 --> 00:28:22.036
REPLACEMENT AS NEEDED THAT&apos;S    
MOSTLY IN THOSE REHABILITATIONS 
WHERE WE&apos;RE TAKING OFF ALL THE  

00:28:22.038 --> 00:28:25.507
MOSTLY IN THOSE REHABILITATIONS 
WHERE WE&apos;RE TAKING OFF ALL THE  
ASPHALT EITHER TO REPAIR SOME   

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:26.241
WHERE WE&apos;RE TAKING OFF ALL THE  
ASPHALT EITHER TO REPAIR SOME   
CURB THAT&apos;S IN REALLY POOR      

00:28:26.243 --> 00:28:27.709
ASPHALT EITHER TO REPAIR SOME   
CURB THAT&apos;S IN REALLY POOR      
CONDITION OR HAS BEEN SHIFTED   

00:28:27.711 --> 00:28:28.644
CURB THAT&apos;S IN REALLY POOR      
CONDITION OR HAS BEEN SHIFTED   
TO PLACE TO MAINTAIN PROPER     

00:28:28.646 --> 00:28:31.880
CONDITION OR HAS BEEN SHIFTED   
TO PLACE TO MAINTAIN PROPER     
DRAINAGE.                       

00:28:31.882 --> 00:28:32.981
TO PLACE TO MAINTAIN PROPER

TREATMENTS IN THAT AREA AS      
WELL.                           
WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME  

00:39:46.456 --> 00:39:48.323
WELL.                           
WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME  
BUMP OUTS IN THOSE AREAS ON     

00:39:48.325 --> 00:39:49.290
WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME  
BUMP OUTS IN THOSE AREAS ON     
THOSE TWO STREETS PULLING A     

00:39:49.292 --> 00:39:52.460
BUMP OUTS IN THOSE AREAS ON     
THOSE TWO STREETS PULLING A     
LITTLE BIT OF SIDEWALK GAP      

00:39:52.462 --> 00:39:53.260
THOSE TWO STREETS PULLING A     
LITTLE BIT OF SIDEWALK GAP      
RIGHT ON ONE OF THOSE           

00:39:53.262 --> 00:39:56.097
LITTLE BIT OF SIDEWALK GAP      
RIGHT ON ONE OF THOSE           
INTERSECTIONS AS WELL.          

00:39:56.099 --> 00:39:57.365
RIGHT ON ONE OF THOSE           
INTERSECTIONS AS WELL.          
BUT THERE WERE ALSO AND OUT     

00:39:57.367 --> 00:40:00.768
INTERSECTIONS AS WELL.          
BUT THERE WERE ALSO AND OUT     
OF USING A CURSE OR NOT BUT IN  

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:01.569
BUT THERE WERE ALSO AND OUT     
OF USING A CURSE OR NOT BUT IN  
THIS AREA UP WHERE THE SIGNAL   

00:40:01.571 --> 00:40:04.304

THIS AREA UP WHERE THE SIGNAL   
INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS OFF   

00:40:04.306 --> 00:40:05.239
THIS AREA UP WHERE THE SIGNAL   
INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS OFF   
OF JACKSON THERE&apos;S LIKE A Y     

00:40:05.241 --> 00:40:08.275
INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS OFF   
OF JACKSON THERE&apos;S LIKE A Y     
INTERSECTION.                   

00:40:08.277 --> 00:40:09.143
OF JACKSON THERE&apos;S LIKE A Y     
INTERSECTION.                   
THERE WERE LAKEVIEW DRIVE       

00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:12.246
INTERSECTION.                   
THERE WERE LAKEVIEW DRIVE       
SPLITS OFF OF LAKE AND WE&apos;RE    

00:40:12.248 --> 00:40:13.013
THERE WERE LAKEVIEW DRIVE       
SPLITS OFF OF LAKE AND WE&apos;RE    
GOING TO BE RECONFIGURING THAT  

00:40:13.015 --> 00:40:15.483
SPLITS OFF OF LAKE AND WE&apos;RE    
GOING TO BE RECONFIGURING THAT  
INTERSECTION SO THAT TI&apos;S UP.   

00:40:15.485 --> 00:40:19.387
GOING TO BE RECONFIGURING THAT  
INTERSECTION SO THAT TI&apos;S UP.   
SO THE LAKE LAKEVIEW WILL BE UP 

00:40:19.389 --> 00:40:20.254
INTERSECTION SO THAT TI&apos;S UP.   
SO THE LAKE LAKEVIEW WILL BE UP 
IN THE HIGH LAKE AND MAKE       

00:40:20.256 --> 00:40:23.791
SO THE LAKE LAKEVIEW WILL BE UP 
IN THE HIGH LAKE AND MAKE       
PEOPLE SLOW DOWN TO MAKE A 90   

00:40:23.793 --> 00:40:24.058
IN THE HIGH LAKE AND MAKE       
PEOPLE SLOW DOWN TO MAKE A 90   
RETURNS.                        

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:24.858
PEOPLE SLOW DOWN TO MAKE A 90   
RETURNS.                        
THEY&apos;RE BEING ABLE TO FIRE      

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.694

RIGHT OFF, YOU KNOW, WITHOUT    
HAVING TO SLOW DOWN.            
SO WE ALSO LOOKED AT BURWOOD    

00:40:31.768 --> 00:40:34.635
HAVING TO SLOW DOWN.            
SO WE ALSO LOOKED AT BURWOOD    
NOW BEING THE BURWOOD IS A      

00:40:34.637 --> 00:40:35.302
SO WE ALSO LOOKED AT BURWOOD    
NOW BEING THE BURWOOD IS A      
FAIRLY STRAIGHT CUT THROUGH     

00:40:35.304 --> 00:40:38.406
NOW BEING THE BURWOOD IS A      
FAIRLY STRAIGHT CUT THROUGH

FAIRLY STRAIGHT CUT THROUGH     
BETWEEN JACKSON AND LIBERTY.    
WE ANTICIPATED THERE COULD BE   

00:40:39.342 --> 00:40:42.509
BETWEEN JACKSON AND LIBERTY.    
WE ANTICIPATED THERE COULD BE   
SOME IS SPEEDING SHOES THERE

WE ANTICIPATED THERE COULD BE   
SOME IS SPEEDING SHOES THERE    
GOOD SPEED STUDY THERE AND      

00:40:43.145 --> 00:40:45.947
SOME IS SPEEDING SHOES THERE    
GOOD SPEED STUDY THERE AND      
INDEED THERE WERE SOME          

00:40:45.949 --> 00:40:46.714
GOOD SPEED STUDY THERE AND      
INDEED THERE WERE SOME          
DEFINITELY SOME SPEEDING ISSUES 

00:40:46.716 --> 00:40:49.550
INDEED THERE WERE SOME          
DEFINITELY SOME SPEEDING ISSUES 
IN THAT AREA SO THAT AREA IS    

00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:50.485
DEFINITELY SOME SPEEDING ISSUES 
IN THAT AREA SO THAT AREA IS    
GOING TO GET SOME SOME SPEED    

00:40:50.487 --> 00:40:54.021
IN THAT AREA SO THAT AREA IS    
GOING TO GET SOME SOME SPEED    
HUMPS, SOME BUMP OUT AND CURVED

YEAH, THE THE GOOD THING ABOUT  
THAT IS THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD,   
PUT THE WATER MAIN AND PUT ALL  

00:42:19.608 --> 00:42:20.341
THAT IS THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD,   
PUT THE WATER MAIN AND PUT ALL  
THE STORMS SEWER WORK IN THAT   

00:42:20.343 --> 00:42:22.810
PUT THE WATER MAIN AND PUT ALL  
THE STORMS SEWER WORK IN THAT   
WE&apos;RE DOING PAVE THE ROAD THE   

00:42:22.812 --> 00:42:26.580
THE STORMS SEWER WORK IN THAT   
WE&apos;RE DOING PAVE THE ROAD THE   
THE CYCLE TRACK TREATMENT IS    

00:42:26.582 --> 00:42:27.314
WE&apos;RE DOING PAVE THE ROAD THE   
THE CYCLE TRACK TREATMENT IS    
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY GOING  

00:42:27.316 --> 00:42:30.884
THE CYCLE TRACK TREATMENT IS    
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY GOING  
TO GO ON THE SURFACE SO WE CAN  

00:42:30.886 --> 00:42:31.452
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY GOING  
TO GO ON THE SURFACE SO WE CAN  
GET ALL THAT WORK DONE.         

00:42:31.454 --> 00:42:32.453
TO GO ON THE SURFACE SO WE CAN  
GET ALL THAT WORK DONE.         
THAT&apos;S THE WAY WE WOULD HAVE    

00:42:32.455 --> 00:42:33.921
GET ALL THAT WORK DONE.         
THAT&apos;S THE WAY WE WOULD HAVE    
BEEN DOING REGARDLESS.          

00:42:33.923 --> 00:42:37.925
THAT&apos;S THE WAY WE WOULD HAVE    
BEEN DOING REGARDLESS.          
SO GETTING THE RESURFACING DONE 

00:42:37.927 --> 00:42:38.792
BEEN DOING REGARDLESS.          
SO GETTING THE RESURFACING DONE 
IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO          

00:42:38.794 --> 00:42:42.863
SO GETTING THE RESURFACING DONE 
IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO          
REGARDLESS INDEPENDENT OF THE   

00:42:42.865 --> 00:42:43.664
IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO          
REGARDLESS INDEPENDENT OF THE   
OF GETTING THE CYCLE TRACK PUT  

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:45.899
REGARDLESS INDEPENDENT OF THE   
OF GETTING THE CYCLE TRACK PUT  
IT OK GREAT.                    

00:42:45.901 --> 00:42:46.734
OF GETTING THE CYCLE TRACK PUT  
IT OK GREAT.                    
AND MY SECOND QUESTION RELATES  

00:42:46.736 --> 00:42:47.468
IT OK GREAT.

THE ROAD AND IF IT&apos;S            
FUNCTIONING FOR THAT PURPOSE    
THEN WE WILL OFTEN LEAVE IT     

00:48:47.797 --> 00:48:49.696
FUNCTIONING FOR THAT PURPOSE    
THEN WE WILL OFTEN LEAVE IT     
ALONE.                          

00:48:49.698 --> 00:48:50.530
THEN WE WILL OFTEN LEAVE IT     
ALONE.                          
SOMETIMES THEY&apos;RE DISINTEGRATED 

00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:51.198

JUST TO THE POINT WHERE THE

THE CONDITION OF THE CONCRETE

OK, WELL I GUESS I WOULD I&apos;D

LIKE TO HEAR A STANDARD THAT&apos;S  

00:49:10.453 --> 00:49:13.320
OK, WELL I GUESS I WOULD I&apos;D    
LIKE TO HEAR A STANDARD THAT&apos;S  
SOMETHING A CRACK THAT&apos;S LONGER 

00:49:13.322 --> 00:49:17.524
LIKE TO HEAR A STANDARD THAT&apos;S  
SOMETHING A CRACK THAT&apos;S LONGER 
THAN X OR WIDER AND Y OR A      

00:49:17.526 --> 00:49:21.095
SOMETHING A CRACK THAT&apos;S LONGER 
THAN X OR WIDER AND Y OR A      
PERCENTAGE OF THE CURVE THAT IS 

00:49:21.097 --> 00:49:24.998

LIKE THESE ARE THE KINDS        

00:49:29.738 --> 00:49:32.940
HAS SUNK MORE THAN X INCHES     
LIKE THESE ARE THE KINDS        
OF STANDARDS THAT I WOULD LIKE  

00:49:32.942 --> 00:49:34.141
LIKE THESE ARE THE KINDS        
OF STANDARDS THAT I WOULD LIKE  
TO SEE APPLIED TO A CURB AND I  

00:49:34.143 --> 00:49:36.610
OF STANDARDS THAT I WOULD LIKE  
TO SEE APPLIED TO A CURB AND I  
GUESS I&apos;D ALSO LIKE TO OFFER UP 

00:49:36.612 --> 00:49:37.444
TO SEE APPLIED TO A CURB AND I  
GUESS I&apos;D ALSO LIKE TO OFFER UP 
MY EXPERIENCE AS A ROAD USER    

00:49:37.446 --> 00:49:41.314
GUESS I&apos;D ALSO LIKE TO OFFER UP 
MY EXPERIENCE AS A ROAD USER    
THAT THERE&apos;S TWO OTHER THINGS   

00:49:41.316 --> 00:49:44.618
MY EXPERIENCE AS A ROAD USER    
THAT THERE&apos;S TWO OTHER THINGS   
THAT I COUNT ON CURBS TO DO AND 

00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.954
THAT THERE&apos;S TWO OTHER THINGS   
THAT I COUNT ON CURBS TO DO AND 
ONE OF THEM IS THEY&apos;RE THE      

00:49:47.956 --> 00:49:48.622
THAT I COUNT ON CURBS TO DO AND 
ONE OF THEM IS THEY&apos;RE THE      
SURFACE THAT&apos;S IMMEDIATELY      

00:49:48.624 --> 00:49:52.593
ONE OF THEM IS THEY&apos;RE THE      
SURFACE THAT&apos;S IMMEDIATELY      
ADJACENT TO WHERE I&apos;M RIDING MY 

00:49:52.595 --> 00:49:53.527
SURFACE THAT&apos;S IMMEDIATELY      
ADJACENT TO WHERE I&apos;M RIDING MY 
BIKE IN THE BIKE LANE SO I WANT 

00:49:53.529 --> 00:49:56.062
ADJACENT TO WHERE I&apos;M RIDING MY 
BIKE IN THE BIKE LANE SO I WANT 
THEM TO BE SMOOTH ENOUGH SO     

00:49:56.064 --> 00:49:57.130
BIKE IN THE BIKE LANE SO I WANT 
THEM TO BE SMOOTH ENOUGH SO     
THAT IF MY BIKE ENDS UP IN THEM 

00:49:57.132 --> 00:50:00.267
THEM TO BE SMOOTH ENOUGH SO     
THAT IF MY BIKE ENDS UP IN THEM 
THAT I DON&apos;T HAVE A WRECK.      

00:50:00.269 --> 00:50:04.037
THAT IF MY BIKE ENDS UP IN THEM 
THAT I DON&apos;T HAVE A WRECK.      
AND THEN I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT 

00:50:04.039 --> 00:50:08.375
THAT I DON&apos;T HAVE A WRECK.      
AND THEN I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT 
CURBS ACTS TO KEEP CARS WHERE   

00:50:08.377 --> 00:50:10.977
AND THEN I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT 
CURBS ACTS TO KEEP CARS WHERE   
THEY BELONG IN THE STREET AND   

00:50:10.979 --> 00:50:11.845
CURBS ACTS TO KEEP CARS WHERE   
THEY BELONG IN THE STREET AND   
OFF OF THE PLACES WHERE THEY    

00:50:11.847 --> 00:50:12.646
THEY BELONG IN THE STREET AND   
OFF OF THE PLACES WHERE THEY    
DON&apos;T BELONG WHEN THINGS GO     

00:50:12.648 --> 00:50:12.847
OFF OF THE PLACES WHERE THEY    
DON&apos;T BELONG WHEN THINGS GO     
WRONG.                          

00:50:12.849 --> 00:50:15.115
DON&apos;T BELONG WHEN THINGS GO     
WRONG.                          
SO THOSE ARE TWO OTHER          

00:50:15.117 --> 00:50:15.750
WRONG.                          
SO THOSE ARE TWO OTHER          
FUNCTIONS OF CURVES THAT I      

00:50:15.752 --> 00:50:18.685
SO THOSE ARE TWO OTHER          
FUNCTIONS OF CURVES THAT I      
THINK WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING  

00:50:18.687 --> 00:50:22.956
FUNCTIONS OF CURVES THAT I      
THINK WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING  
BEYOND THE WATER DRAINAGE.      

00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:23.924
THINK WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING  
BEYOND THE WATER DRAINAGE.      
SO REASONS WHY I WOULD LIKE     

00:50:23.926 --> 00:50:25.725
BEYOND THE WATER DRAINAGE.      
SO REASONS WHY I WOULD LIKE     
CURVES THAT ARE IN GOOD         

00:50:25.727 --> 00:50:37.304
SO REASONS WHY I WOULD LIKE     
CURVES THAT ARE IN GOOD         
CONDITION SO ARE SO I WILL NOTE 

00:50:37.306 --> 00:50:38.171
CURVES THAT ARE IN GOOD         
CONDITION SO ARE SO I WILL NOTE 
I&apos;M I&apos;M QUITE PLEASED TO HEAR   

00:50:38.173 --> 00:50:38.839
CONDITION SO ARE SO I WILL NOTE 
I&apos;M I&apos;M QUITE PLEASED TO HEAR   
ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE   

00:50:38.841 --> 00:50:41.508
I&apos;M I&apos;M QUITE PLEASED TO HEAR   
ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE   
INTERSECTION OF LAKE AND LAKE   

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.842
ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE   
INTERSECTION OF LAKE AND LAKE   
VIEW.                           

00:50:41.844 --> 00:50:44.911
INTERSECTION OF LAKE AND LAKE   
VIEW.                           
THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS

VIEW.                           
THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS  
NEAR MY HOME AND THAT I TRAVEL  

00:50:45.915 --> 00:50:47.914
THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS  
NEAR MY HOME AND THAT I TRAVEL  
FREQUENTLY TAKING MY CHILD TO   

00:50:47.916 --> 00:50:48.849
NEAR MY HOME AND THAT I TRAVEL  
FREQUENTLY TAKING MY CHILD TO   
SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW, I&apos;VE       

00:50:48.851 --> 00:50:49.717
FREQUENTLY TAKING MY CHILD TO

PERSONALLY OBSERVED QUITE A BIT

PERSONALLY OBSERVED QUITE A BIT 
OF SOMETIMES CONFUSION WHEN YOU

01:24:30.503 --> 01:24:34.972
INTERSECTIONS.                  
SO THE WAY THE BICYCLE SIGNAL   
WORKS IS THAT THE THE BICYCLE   

01:24:34.974 --> 01:24:38.843
SO THE WAY THE BICYCLE SIGNAL   
WORKS IS THAT THE THE BICYCLE   
SIGNAL INDICATION AND THE       

01:24:38.845 --> 01:24:39.544
WORKS IS THAT THE THE BICYCLE   
SIGNAL INDICATION AND THE       
PEDESTRIAN SIGNAL THEY ARE      

01:24:39.546 --> 01:24:42.413

01:24:54.127 --> 01:24:58.796
WITH A MOTOR VEHICLE INDICATION 
STAYS STAYS RED.                
THEN AFTER THIS PHASE THE       

01:24:58.798 --> 01:24:59.697
STAYS STAYS RED.                
THEN AFTER THIS PHASE THE       
BICYCLE SIGNAL WOULD TURN TO    

01:24:59.699 --> 01:25:02.366
THEN AFTER THIS PHASE THE       
BICYCLE SIGNAL WOULD TURN TO    
RED AND PEDESTRIAN USERS        

01:25:02.368 --> 01:25:06.204
BICYCLE SIGNAL WOULD TURN TO    
RED AND PEDESTRIAN USERS        
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A WALK AND  

01:25:06.206 --> 01:25:07.605
RED AND PEDESTRIAN USERS        
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A WALK AND  
MOTOR VEHICLE INDICATION WILL   

01:25:07.607 --> 01:25:12.710
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A WALK AND

01:32:11.664 --> 01:32:11.930
YOU HAD UP AT THE VERY          
BEGINNING OF THE FOR THE        
FLICKER.                        

01:32:11.932 --> 01:32:12.464
BEGINNING OF THE FOR THE        
FLICKER.                        
OH NO THAT&apos;S FINE.              

01:32:12.466 --> 01:32:15.766
FLICKER.                        
OH NO THAT&apos;S FINE.              
YEAH, AND SO IF I&apos;M             

01:32:15.768 --> 01:32:16.501
OH NO THAT&apos;S FINE.              
YEAH, AND SO IF I&apos;M             
UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTLY IF 

01:32:16.503 --> 01:32:18.970
YEAH, AND SO IF I&apos;M             
UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTLY IF 
I&apos;M INFERRING THINGS, IT&apos;S WHEN 

01:32:18.972 --> 01:32:22.040
UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTLY IF 
I&apos;M INFERRING THINGS, IT&apos;S WHEN 
YOU HAVE THAT PROTECTED SIGNAL  

01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:22.974
I&apos;M INFERRING THINGS, IT&apos;S WHEN 
YOU HAVE THAT PROTECTED SIGNAL  
IT APPEARS THAT WE&apos;RE HAVING    

01:32:22.976 --> 01:32:26.411
YOU HAVE THAT PROTECTED SIGNAL  
IT APPEARS THAT WE&apos;RE HAVING    
MUCH FEWER PEDESTRIAN CRASHES   

01:32:26.413 --> 01:32:27.278
IT APPEARS THAT WE&apos;RE HAVING    
MUCH FEWER PEDESTRIAN CRASHES   
AT THE TAIPEI LEVEL AND THAT    

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:30.281
MUCH FEWER PEDESTRIAN CRASHES   
AT THE TAIPEI LEVEL AND THAT    
THAT IS PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT 

01:32:30.283 --> 01:32:33.617
AT THE TAIPEI LEVEL AND THAT    
THAT IS PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT 
BENEFIT FOR PEDESTRIANS IS THAT 

01:32:33.619 --> 01:32:38.123
THAT IS PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT 
BENEFIT FOR PEDESTRIANS IS THAT 
IS THE FUTURE WORK AROUND       

01:32:38.125 --> 01:32:41.192
BENEFIT FOR PEDESTRIANS IS THAT 
IS THE FUTURE WORK AROUND       
TRANSITIONING MORE TO THAT      

01:32:41.194 --> 01:32:41.793
IS THE FUTURE WORK AROUND       
TRANSITIONING MORE TO THAT      
PROTECTED SIGNAL.               

01:32:41.795 --> 01:32:42.793
TRANSITIONING MORE TO THAT      
PROTECTED SIGNAL.               
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND   

01:32:42.795 --> 01:32:45.429
PROTECTED SIGNAL.               
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND   
THAT BETTER?                    

01:32:45.431 --> 01:32:46.498
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND   
THAT BETTER?                    
THIS IS A I GUESS FROM THE      

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:49.433
THAT BETTER?                    
THIS IS A I GUESS FROM THE      
CRASH PERSPECTIVE.              

01:32:49.435 --> 01:32:50.568
THIS IS A I GUESS FROM THE      
CRASH PERSPECTIVE.              
WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW   

01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:53.805
CRASH PERSPECTIVE.              
WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW   
THE QUARRY CRASH IS IS SHOWING  

01:32:53.807 --> 01:32:54.072
WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW   
THE QUARRY CRASH IS IS SHOWING  
UP.                             

01:32:54.074 --> 01:32:56.741
THE QUARRY CRASH IS IS SHOWING  
UP.                             
SO THIS IS PRIMARILY SHOWING    

01:32:56.743 --> 01:33:00.545
UP.                             
SO THIS IS PRIMARILY SHOWING    
FOR PERMISSIVE ONLY TREATMENT.  

01:33:00.547 --> 01:33:01.546
SO THIS IS PRIMARILY SHOWING    
FOR PERMISSIVE ONLY TREATMENT.  
SO WAS THE THE HISTORY CRASH    

01:33:01.548 --> 01:33:05.683
FOR PERMISSIVE ONLY TREATMENT.  
SO WAS THE THE HISTORY CRASH    
THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAPPEN     

01:33:05.685 --> 01:33:09.254
SO WAS THE THE HISTORY CRASH    
THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAPPEN     
WHEN IT&apos;S A PERMISSIVE MOVEMENT 

01:33:09.256 --> 01:33:09.988
THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAPPEN     
WHEN IT&apos;S A PERMISSIVE MOVEMENT 
WHETHER THAT PERMISSIVE         

01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:13.057
WHEN IT&apos;S A PERMISSIVE MOVEMENT 
WHETHER THAT PERMISSIVE         
MOVEMENT IS WITHOUT A LEFT TURN 

01:33:13.059 --> 01:33:17.095
WHETHER THAT PERMISSIVE         
MOVEMENT IS WITHOUT A LEFT TURN 
SIGNAL OR IT&apos;S WORTH SO IN THIS 

01:33:17.097 --> 01:33:20.965
MOVEMENT IS WITHOUT A LEFT TURN 
SIGNAL OR IT&apos;S WORTH SO IN THIS 
CASE IS SHOWING THAT FOR THE    

01:33:20.967 --> 01:33:21.766
SIGNAL OR IT&apos;S WORTH SO IN THIS 
CASE IS SHOWING THAT FOR THE    
MAJORITY OF THESE THEY ARE AND  

01:33:21.768 --> 01:33:24.702
CASE IS SHOWING THAT FOR THE    
MAJORITY OF THESE THEY ARE AND  
THEIR PERMISSIVE ONLY MEANING   

01:33:24.704 --> 01:33:25.469
MAJORITY OF THESE THEY ARE AND  
THEIR PERMISSIVE ONLY MEANING   
THERE ARE SIMPLY NOT A LEFT     

01:33:25.471 --> 01:33:28.473
THEIR PERMISSIVE ONLY MEANING   
THERE ARE SIMPLY NOT A LEFT     
TURN SIGNAL TREATMENT.          

01:33:28.475 --> 01:33:32.410
THERE ARE SIMPLY NOT A LEFT     
TURN SIGNAL TREATMENT.          
SO WE DO HAVE DESIRE AND        

01:33:32.412 --> 01:33:33.345
TURN SIGNAL TREATMENT.          
SO WE DO HAVE DESIRE AND        
OF COURSE WE&apos;LL HAVE TO LOOK AT 

01:33:33.347 --> 01:33:35.980
SO WE DO HAVE DESIRE AND        
OF COURSE WE&apos;LL HAVE TO LOOK AT 
INTERSECTIONS AS AS AS THEY FIT 

01:33:35.982 --> 01:33:39.851
OF COURSE WE&apos;LL HAVE TO LOOK AT 
INTERSECTIONS AS AS AS THEY FIT 
TO TO EXPLORE WAYS TO INSTALL   

01:33:39.853 --> 01:33:43.354
INTERSECTIONS AS AS AS THEY FIT 
TO TO EXPLORE WAYS TO INSTALL   
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW MEANING   

01:33:43.356 --> 01:33:44.255
TO TO EXPLORE WAYS TO INSTALL   
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW MEANING   
THAT THAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT     

01:33:44.257 --> 01:33:47.559
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW MEANING   
THAT THAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT     
WILL PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO  

01:33:47.561 --> 01:33:51.495
THAT THAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT     
WILL PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO  
TO PROVIDE EITHER PERMISSIVE    

01:33:51.497 --> 01:33:55.800
WILL PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO  
TO PROVIDE EITHER PERMISSIVE    
AND THE PROTECTED OR IT&apos;S THE   

01:33:55.802 --> 01:33:56.434
TO PROVIDE EITHER PERMISSIVE    
AND THE PROTECTED OR IT&apos;S THE   
SAME TYPE OF OPERATIONS.        

01:33:56.436 --> 01:33:59.804
AND THE PROTECTED OR IT&apos;S THE   
SAME TYPE OF OPERATIONS.        
BUT WAS THE CAPABILITY TO OMIT  

01:33:59.806 --> 01:34:00.605
SAME TYPE OF OPERATIONS.        
BUT WAS THE CAPABILITY TO OMIT  
THE PERMISSIVE PORTION WHEN     

01:34:00.607 --> 01:34:05.910
BUT WAS THE CAPABILITY TO OMIT  
THE PERMISSIVE PORTION WHEN     
PEDESTRIAN USERS ARE PRESENT IS 

01:34:05.912 --> 01:34:06.644
THE PERMISSIVE PORTION WHEN     
PEDESTRIAN USERS ARE PRESENT IS 
ARE THESE CRASHES FURTHER       

01:34:06.646 --> 01:34:06.977
PEDESTRIAN USERS ARE PRESENT IS 
ARE THESE CRASHES FURTHER       
ANALYZED?                       

01:34:06.979 --> 01:34:10.181
ARE THESE CRASHES FURTHER       
ANALYZED?                       
SO WE KNOW WHETHER THEIR LEFT   

01:34:10.183 --> 01:34:11.049
ANALYZED?                       
SO WE KNOW WHETHER THEIR LEFT   
HAND TURN CRASHES OR RIGHT HAND 

01:34:11.051 --> 01:34:18.422
SO WE KNOW WHETHER THEIR LEFT   
HAND TURN CRASHES OR RIGHT HAND 
TURN ON THE THE FATAL ONE IS A  

01:34:18.424 --> 01:34:19.356
HAND TURN CRASHES OR RIGHT HAND 
TURN ON THE THE FATAL ONE IS A  
LEFT HAND TURN I THINK OF THE   

01:34:19.358 --> 01:34:22.326
TURN ON THE THE FATAL ONE IS A  
LEFT HAND TURN I THINK OF THE   
MAJORITY OF THESE ARE LEFT HAND 

01:34:22.328 --> 01:34:22.694
LEFT HAND TURN I THINK OF THE   
MAJORITY OF THESE ARE LEFT HAND 
TURN CRASHES.                   

01:34:22.696 --> 01:34:25.330
MAJORITY OF THESE ARE LEFT HAND 
TURN CRASHES.                   
&gt;&gt; I ASSUME BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE A   

01:34:25.332 --> 01:34:32.703
TURN CRASHES.                   
&gt;&gt; I ASSUME BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE A   
BUT I JUST WANTED TO RIGHT AND  

01:34:32.705 --> 01:34:33.671
&gt;&gt; I ASSUME BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE A   
BUT I JUST WANTED TO RIGHT AND  
I THINK THAT THE QUESTION I     

01:34:33.673 --> 01:34:36.907
BUT I JUST WANTED TO RIGHT AND  
I THINK THAT THE QUESTION I     
WOULD HAVE AS WE TRANSITION AND 

01:34:36.909 --> 01:34:41.245
I THINK THAT THE QUESTION I     
WOULD HAVE AS WE TRANSITION AND 
IS IS THAT ARE ARE WE GETTING A 

01:34:41.247 --> 01:34:42.046
WOULD HAVE AS WE TRANSITION AND 
IS IS THAT ARE ARE WE GETTING A 
LOT MORE BENEFIT FROM THE THE   

01:34:42.048 --> 01:34:44.782
IS IS THAT ARE ARE WE GETTING A 
LOT MORE BENEFIT FROM THE THE   
FULLY PROTECTED VERSUS SORT     

01:34:44.784 --> 01:34:49.053
LOT MORE BENEFIT FROM THE THE   
FULLY PROTECTED VERSUS SORT     
OF THE FLASHING YELLOW AND HOW  

01:34:49.055 --> 01:34:49.888
FULLY PROTECTED VERSUS SORT     
OF THE FLASHING YELLOW AND HOW  
WE GATHER MORE DATA AROUND THAT 

01:34:49.890 --> 01:34:52.891
OF THE FLASHING YELLOW AND HOW  
WE GATHER MORE DATA AROUND THAT 
AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I  

01:34:52.893 --> 01:34:53.758
WE GATHER MORE DATA AROUND THAT 
AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I  
HAVE IS JUST REGARDING THE      

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.027
AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I  
HAVE IS JUST REGARDING THE      
LEADING PEDESTRIAN INTERVAL YOU 

01:34:57.029 --> 01:35:00.498
HAVE IS JUST REGARDING THE      
LEADING PEDESTRIAN INTERVAL YOU 
MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE      

01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:01.298
LEADING PEDESTRIAN INTERVAL YOU 
MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE      
INTERSECTIONS HAVE THAT AND     

01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:04.969
MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE      
INTERSECTIONS HAVE THAT AND     
WE&apos;VE APPLIED TO AND GOTTEN

INTERSECTIONS HAVE THAT AND     
WE&apos;VE APPLIED TO AND GOTTEN     
AUTHORIZATION HAVE HAS NOT

TURNED DOWN ANY REQUESTS THAT   
WE&apos;VE PUT IN AROUND LEADING     
PEDESTRIAN INTERVALS OR HOW DO  

01:35:12.145 --> 01:35:15.613
WE&apos;VE PUT IN AROUND LEADING     
PEDESTRIAN INTERVALS OR HOW DO  
WE DETERMINE WHEN TO MAKE THAT  

01:35:15.615 --> 01:35:16.548
PEDESTRIAN INTERVALS OR HOW DO  
WE DETERMINE WHEN TO MAKE THAT  
REQUEST FROM THE END UP         

01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:19.884
WE DETERMINE WHEN TO MAKE THAT  
REQUEST FROM THE END UP

THE MOST OF THAT THAT WE HAVE   

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.255
FEEDBACK?                       
THE MOST OF THAT THAT WE HAVE   
HEARD IS THAT FOR LOCATION THIS 

01:35:24.257 --> 01:35:28.259
THE MOST OF THAT THAT WE HAVE   
HEARD IS THAT FOR LOCATION THIS 
IS WHERE LPI AND APPS COME      

01:35:28.261 --> 01:35:35.166
HEARD IS THAT FOR LOCATION THIS 
IS WHERE LPI AND APPS COME      
TOGETHER MEANING THAT IN THE IN 

01:35:35.168 --> 01:35:38.903
IS WHERE LPI AND APPS COME      
TOGETHER MEANING THAT IN THE IN

PUSHBUTTONS OR BETTER APPS THEN 

01:35:43.175 --> 01:35:46.477
AN INTERSECTION IS EQUIPPED WAS 
PUSHBUTTONS OR BETTER APPS THEN 
THEN THERE ARE MORE LIKELY TO

THAT IS AWARE THAT WE HAVE      
BLANKET DESIRE TO STYOPA AT ALL 
THE INTERSECTIONS YOU PETER HI  

01:37:05.291 --> 01:37:05.490
BLANKET DESIRE TO STYOPA AT ALL 
THE INTERSECTIONS YOU PETER HI  
.                               

01:37:05.492 --> 01:37:09.593

THANKS FOR THIS PRESENTATIONS.  
A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION AND   
SO LOOKING AT THIS SLIDE WE SEE 

01:37:20.039 --> 01:37:20.672
A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION AND   
SO LOOKING AT THIS SLIDE WE SEE 
PERMISSIVE ONLY INTERSECTIONS   

01:37:20.674 --> 01:37:24.375
SO LOOKING AT THIS SLIDE WE SEE 
PERMISSIVE ONLY INTERSECTIONS   
HAVE 14 80 LEVEL CRASHES AND    

01:37:24.377 --> 01:37:25.176
PERMISSIVE ONLY INTERSECTIONS   
HAVE 14 80 LEVEL CRASHES AND    
PERMISSIVE PLUS FLASHING YELLOW 

01:37:25.178 --> 01:37:31.515
HAVE 14 80 LEVEL CRASHES AND    
PERMISSIVE PLUS FLASHING YELLOW 
ARROW HAVE TO BUT WITHOUT       

01:37:31.517 --> 01:37:32.549
PERMISSIVE PLUS FLASHING YELLOW 
ARROW HAVE TO BUT WITHOUT       
KNOWING HOW MANY OF EACH KIND   

01:37:32.551 --> 01:37:35.753
ARROW HAVE TO BUT WITHOUT       
KNOWING HOW MANY OF EACH KIND   
OF INTERSECTION THERE IS AND    

01:37:35.755 --> 01:37:36.487
KNOWING HOW MANY OF EACH KIND   
OF INTERSECTION THERE IS AND    
THE TRAFFIC VOLUME IN THEM,     

01:37:36.489 --> 01:37:38.623
OF INTERSECTION THERE IS AND    
THE TRAFFIC VOLUME IN THEM,     
IT&apos;S WE CAN&apos;T NORMALIZE.        

01:37:38.625 --> 01:37:39.490
THE TRAFFIC VOLUME IN THEM,     
IT&apos;S WE CAN&apos;T NORMALIZE.        
THAT COULD MEAN THAT WE DON&apos;T   

01:37:39.492 --> 01:37:40.224
IT&apos;S WE CAN&apos;T NORMALIZE.        
THAT COULD MEAN THAT WE DON&apos;T   
HAVE MANY FLASHING YELLOW ARROW 

01:37:40.226 --> 01:37:43.927
THAT COULD MEAN THAT WE DON&apos;T   
HAVE MANY FLASHING YELLOW ARROW 
INTERSECTIONS OR IT COULD MEAN  

01:37:43.929 --> 01:37:48.198
HAVE MANY FLASHING YELLOW ARROW 
INTERSECTIONS OR IT COULD MEAN  
THAT WE THAT WE DON&apos;T HAVE A    

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:48.799
INTERSECTIONS OR IT COULD MEAN  
THAT WE THAT WE DON&apos;T HAVE A    
LOT OF CRASHES IN THEM.         

01:37:48.801 --> 01:37:50.868
THAT WE THAT WE DON&apos;T HAVE A    
LOT OF CRASHES IN THEM.         
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME THERE?     

01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:52.002
LOT OF CRASHES IN THEM.         
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME THERE?     
SO I DON&apos;T I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW     

01:37:52.004 --> 01:37:55.039
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME THERE?     
SO I DON&apos;T I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW     
MUCH WE CAN DRAW FROM THE FACT  

01:37:55.041 --> 01:37:58.109
SO I DON&apos;T I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW     
MUCH WE CAN DRAW FROM THE FACT  
THAT THERE&apos;S ONLY TWO CRASHES   

01:37:58.111 --> 01:37:59.143
MUCH WE CAN DRAW FROM THE FACT  
THAT THERE&apos;S ONLY TWO CRASHES   
IN THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW    

01:37:59.145 --> 01:38:02.580
THAT THERE&apos;S ONLY TWO CRASHES   
IN THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW    
INTERSECTIONS ELABORATE A       

01:38:02.582 --> 01:38:09.354
IN THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW    
INTERSECTIONS ELABORATE A       
LITTLE BIT MORE AS TO THE POINT 

01:38:23.701 --> 01:38:24.969
.                               
SURE.                           
IF THERE WAS ONLY ONE FLASHING  

01:38:24.971 --> 01:38:25.702
SURE.                           
IF THERE WAS ONLY ONE FLASHING  
YELLOW INTERSECTION FLASHING    

01:38:25.704 --> 01:38:26.371
IF THERE WAS ONLY ONE FLASHING  
YELLOW INTERSECTION FLASHING    
LIGHTS OR INTERSECTION IN THE   

01:38:26.373 --> 01:38:27.105
YELLOW INTERSECTION FLASHING    
LIGHTS OR INTERSECTION IN THE   
WHOLE CITY, WE PROBABLY         

01:38:27.107 --> 01:38:27.772
LIGHTS OR INTERSECTION IN THE   
WHOLE CITY, WE PROBABLY         
WOULDN&apos;T HAVE MANY CRASHES      

01:38:27.774 --> 01:38:28.039
WHOLE CITY, WE PROBABLY         
WOULDN&apos;T HAVE MANY CRASHES      
THERE.                          

01:38:28.041 --> 01:38:28.639
WOULDN&apos;T HAVE MANY CRASHES      
THERE.                          
SO WITHOUT KNOWING THE          

01:38:28.641 --> 01:38:29.240
THERE.                          
SO WITHOUT KNOWING THE          
COMPARISON OF THE TRAFFIC       

01:38:29.242 --> 01:38:29.841
SO WITHOUT KNOWING THE          
COMPARISON OF THE TRAFFIC       
VOLUME THAT GOES THROUGH        

01:38:29.843 --> 01:38:30.441
COMPARISON OF THE TRAFFIC       
VOLUME THAT GOES THROUGH        
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW           

01:38:30.443 --> 01:38:31.175
VOLUME THAT GOES THROUGH        
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW           
INTERSECTIONS AND PERMISSIVE    

01:38:31.177 --> 01:38:31.843
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW           
INTERSECTIONS AND PERMISSIVE    
ONLY INTERSECTIONS, IT&apos;S IT&apos;S   

01:38:31.845 --> 01:38:32.643
INTERSECTIONS AND PERMISSIVE    
ONLY INTERSECTIONS, IT&apos;S IT&apos;S   
TOUGH TO SAY THAT TWO IS BETTER 

01:38:32.645 --> 01:38:33.444
ONLY INTERSECTIONS, IT&apos;S IT&apos;S   
TOUGH TO SAY THAT TWO IS BETTER 
THAN FOURTEEN IF THERE&apos;S ONLY   

01:38:33.446 --> 01:38:34.078
TOUGH TO SAY THAT TWO IS BETTER 
THAN FOURTEEN IF THERE&apos;S ONLY   
ONE INTERSECTION THAT HAS A     

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:34.812
THAN FOURTEEN IF THERE&apos;S ONLY   
ONE INTERSECTION THAT HAS A     
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW AND IT    

01:38:34.814 --> 01:38:35.680
ONE INTERSECTION THAT HAS A     
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW AND IT    
HAS TO AND IT HAD TO CRASHES    

01:38:35.682 --> 01:38:36.347
FLASHING YELLOW ARROW AND IT    
HAS TO AND IT HAD TO CRASHES    
BUT THERE&apos;S ONE HUNDRED         

01:38:36.349 --> 01:38:37.081
HAS TO AND IT HAD TO CRASHES    
BUT THERE&apos;S ONE HUNDRED         
PERMISSIVE ONLY INTERSECTIONS   

01:38:37.083 --> 01:38:40.384
BUT THERE&apos;S ONE HUNDRED         
PERMISSIVE ONLY INTERSECTIONS   
AND IT COULD BE THE TWO IS      

01:38:40.386 --> 01:38:43.821
PERMISSIVE ONLY INTERSECTIONS   
AND IT COULD BE THE TWO IS      
WORSE THAN FOURTEEN BECAUSE WE  

01:38:43.823 --> 01:38:44.655
AND IT COULD BE THE TWO IS      
WORSE THAN FOURTEEN BECAUSE WE  
HAD TWO AT ONE INTERSECTION     

01:38:44.657 --> 01:38:47.391
WORSE THAN FOURTEEN BECAUSE WE  
HAD TWO AT ONE INTERSECTION     
INSTEAD OF FOURTEEN CRASHES     

01:38:47.393 --> 01:38:48.259
HAD TWO AT ONE INTERSECTION     
INSTEAD OF FOURTEEN CRASHES     
OVER ONE HUNDRED INTERSECTIONS. 

01:38:48.261 --> 01:38:49.060
INSTEAD OF FOURTEEN CRASHES     
OVER ONE HUNDRED INTERSECTIONS. 
&gt;&gt; SO I SEE THE POINT NOW.      

01:38:49.062 --> 01:38:50.862
OVER ONE HUNDRED INTERSECTIONS. 
&gt;&gt; SO I SEE THE POINT NOW.      
YES CONTINUE PLEASE.            

01:38:50.864 --> 01:38:55.099
&gt;&gt; SO I SEE THE POINT NOW.      
YES CONTINUE PLEASE.

CONCERNS ME.                    
I MEAN WHEN WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT    
THIS DATA THE OTHER THING IS    

01:38:58.838 --> 01:38:59.504
I MEAN WHEN WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT    
THIS DATA THE OTHER THING IS    
THAT THESE FLASHING YELLOW      

01:38:59.506 --> 01:39:02.840
THIS DATA THE OTHER THING IS    
THAT THESE FLASHING YELLOW      
ARROWS APPEAR TO BE TO ME BY MY 

01:39:02.842 --> 01:39:06.677

ARROWS APPEAR TO BE TO ME BY MY 
EXPERIENCE RELATIVELY NEW LIKE  

01:39:06.679 --> 01:39:07.611
ARROWS APPEAR TO BE TO ME BY MY 
EXPERIENCE RELATIVELY NEW LIKE  
I THINK THAT THE ONE I&apos;M MOST

FAMILIAR WITH ON SIWA CHURCH    
ONLY GOT INSTALLED IN LIKE      

01:39:10.015 --> 01:39:10.681
FAMILIAR WITH ON SIWA CHURCH    
ONLY GOT INSTALLED IN LIKE      
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY       

01:39:10.683 --> 01:39:14.284
ONLY GOT INSTALLED IN LIKE      
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY       
NINETEEN AND SO WE&apos;RE BEGINNING 

01:39:14.286 --> 01:39:17.588
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY       
NINETEEN AND SO WE&apos;RE BEGINNING 
TO SEE CRASHES AND GET REPORTS  

01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:18.689
NINETEEN AND SO WE&apos;RE BEGINNING 
TO SEE CRASHES AND GET REPORTS  
FROM OF NEAR MISSES FROM PEOPLE 

01:39:18.691 --> 01:39:21.625
TO SEE CRASHES AND GET REPORTS  
FROM OF NEAR MISSES FROM PEOPLE 
FROM THESE FLASHING YELLOW      

01:39:21.627 --> 01:39:22.392
FROM OF NEAR MISSES FROM PEOPLE 
FROM THESE FLASHING YELLOW      
ARROW INTERSECTIONS AS THEY GET 

01:39:22.394 --> 01:39:25.829
FROM THESE FLASHING YELLOW      
ARROW INTERSECTIONS AS THEY GET 
ROLLED OUT ONE THAT COMES TO    

01:39:25.831 --> 01:39:26.631
ARROW INTERSECTIONS AS THEY GET 
ROLLED OUT ONE THAT COMES TO    
MIND IS THE INTERSECTION        

01:39:26.633 --> 01:39:29.700
ROLLED OUT ONE THAT COMES TO    
MIND IS THE INTERSECTION        
OF DEPOT AND NORTH MAIN.        

01:39:29.702 --> 01:39:30.701
MIND IS THE INTERSECTION        
OF DEPOT AND NORTH MAIN.        
THERE WAS A NEAR MISS THERE     

01:39:30.703 --> 01:39:33.938
OF DEPOT AND NORTH MAIN.        
THERE WAS A NEAR MISS THERE     
THAT WAS REPORTED BY JONATHAN   

01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:40.678
THERE WAS A NEAR MISS THERE     
THAT WAS REPORTED BY JONATHAN   
LEVINE IN A QUICK FIX AND THE   

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:45.382
THAT WAS REPORTED BY JONATHAN   
LEVINE IN A QUICK FIX AND THE   
THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW NOW   

01:39:45.384 --> 01:39:48.719
LEVINE IN A QUICK FIX AND THE   
THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW NOW   
GETS CANCELED WHEN THERE&apos;S      

01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:49.253
THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW NOW   
GETS CANCELED WHEN THERE&apos;S      
PEDESTRIAN INTERACTION,         

01:39:49.255 --> 01:39:53.323
GETS CANCELED WHEN THERE&apos;S      
PEDESTRIAN INTERACTION,         
PEDESTRIAN PUSHES A BUTTON AT   

01:39:53.325 --> 01:39:54.025
PEDESTRIAN INTERACTION,         
PEDESTRIAN PUSHES A BUTTON AT   
THAT INTERSECTION AND SO THAT&apos;S 

01:39:54.027 --> 01:39:56.027
PEDESTRIAN PUSHES A BUTTON AT   
THAT INTERSECTION AND SO THAT&apos;S 
GOOD.                           

01:39:56.029 --> 01:39:56.894
THAT INTERSECTION AND SO THAT&apos;S 
GOOD.                           
THE PROBLEM IS THAT AT THAT     

01:39:56.896 --> 01:40:00.697
GOOD.                           
THE PROBLEM IS THAT AT THAT     
SAME INTERSECTION A CYCLIST WAS 

01:40:00.699 --> 01:40:05.136
THE PROBLEM IS THAT AT THAT     
SAME INTERSECTION A CYCLIST WAS 
HIT BY A CAR MAKING A LEFT TURN 

01:40:05.138 --> 01:40:07.805
SAME INTERSECTION A CYCLIST WAS 
HIT BY A CAR MAKING A LEFT TURN 
AND A FLASHING YELLOW ARROW.    

01:40:07.807 --> 01:40:09.006
HIT BY A CAR MAKING A LEFT TURN 
AND A FLASHING YELLOW ARROW.    
THERE&apos;S NO WAY FOR A CYCLIST IN 

01:40:09.008 --> 01:40:12.142
AND A FLASHING YELLOW ARROW.    
THERE&apos;S NO WAY FOR A CYCLIST IN 
THE BIKE LANE TO CANCEL THAT    

01:40:12.144 --> 01:40:15.780
THERE&apos;S NO WAY FOR A CYCLIST IN 
THE BIKE LANE TO CANCEL THAT    
THAT FLASHING YELLOW AREA.      

01:40:15.782 --> 01:40:22.686
THE BIKE LANE TO CANCEL THAT    
THAT FLASHING YELLOW AREA.      
&gt;&gt; SO I I WANT VERY MUCH        

01:40:22.688 --> 01:40:23.487
THAT FLASHING YELLOW AREA.      
&gt;&gt; SO I I WANT VERY MUCH        
WHEREVER POSSIBLE LIKE CYO      

01:40:23.489 --> 01:40:26.957
&gt;&gt; SO I I WANT VERY MUCH        
WHEREVER POSSIBLE LIKE CYO      
CHURCH AND 7TH FOR EXAMPLE.     

01:40:26.959 --> 01:40:27.958
WHEREVER POSSIBLE LIKE CYO      
CHURCH AND 7TH FOR EXAMPLE.     
WE HAVE THE BUTTONS THERE.      

01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:28.826
CHURCH AND 7TH FOR EXAMPLE.     
WE HAVE THE BUTTONS THERE.      
I WANT THE FLASHING YELLOW      

01:40:28.828 --> 01:40:31.429
WE HAVE THE BUTTONS THERE.      
I WANT THE FLASHING YELLOW      
ARROW CANCELED WHEN PEOPLE PUSH 

01:40:31.431 --> 01:40:34.999
I WANT THE FLASHING YELLOW      
ARROW CANCELED WHEN PEOPLE PUSH 
THE BUTTONS LIKE AS SOON AS     

01:40:35.001 --> 01:40:35.466
ARROW CANCELED WHEN PEOPLE PUSH 
THE BUTTONS LIKE AS SOON AS     
POSSIBLE.                       

01:40:35.468 --> 01:40:36.333
THE BUTTONS LIKE AS SOON AS     
POSSIBLE.                       
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE OUR    

01:40:36.335 --> 01:40:37.068
POSSIBLE.                       
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE OUR    
DEFAULT EVERYWHERE WHERE WE     

01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:38.736
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE OUR    
DEFAULT EVERYWHERE WHERE WE     
WHERE WE DON&apos;T HAVE IT WE NEED  

01:40:38.738 --> 01:40:41.972
DEFAULT EVERYWHERE WHERE WE     
WHERE WE DON&apos;T HAVE IT WE NEED  
TO GET IT ASAP.                 

01:40:41.974 --> 01:40:43.140
WHERE WE DON&apos;T HAVE IT WE NEED  
TO GET IT ASAP.                 
I THINK WE NEED TO THINK WE     

01:40:43.142 --> 01:40:45.776
TO GET IT ASAP.                 
I THINK WE NEED TO THINK WE     
NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY    

01:40:45.778 --> 01:40:46.444
I THINK WE NEED TO THINK WE     
NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY    
ABOUT INSTALLING ANY MORE       

01:40:46.446 --> 01:40:50.181
NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY    
ABOUT INSTALLING ANY MORE       
FLASHING YELLOW ARROWS IF WE DO 

01:40:50.183 --> 01:40:51.048
ABOUT INSTALLING ANY MORE       
FLASHING YELLOW ARROWS IF WE DO 
INSTALL A FLASHING YELLOW ARROW 

01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:53.417
FLASHING YELLOW ARROWS IF WE DO 
INSTALL A FLASHING YELLOW ARROW 
IT HAS TO CANCEL IT HAS TO      

01:40:53.419 --> 01:40:54.152
INSTALL A FLASHING YELLOW ARROW 
IT HAS TO CANCEL IT HAS TO      
CANCEL WHEN WE PUSH THE BUTTON  

01:40:54.154 --> 01:40:57.088
IT HAS TO CANCEL IT HAS TO      
CANCEL WHEN WE PUSH THE BUTTON  
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.          

01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:58.322
CANCEL WHEN WE PUSH THE BUTTON  
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.          
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO  

01:40:58.324 --> 01:41:00.825
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.          
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO  
BE HAVING A MORE OF A           

01:41:00.827 --> 01:41:01.559
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO  
BE HAVING A MORE OF A           
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WE   

01:41:01.561 --> 01:41:04.796
BE HAVING A MORE OF A           
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WE   
WANT TO USE THESE AT ALL AND    

01:41:04.798 --> 01:41:05.996
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WE   
WANT TO USE THESE AT ALL AND    
THAT GOING BACK TO THE EXAMPLE

IT FOR THE PEDESTRIAN CONDITION 
BUT WE DIDN&apos;T FIX IT FOR THE    

01:41:10.969 --> 01:41:13.637
IT FOR THE PEDESTRIAN CONDITION 
BUT WE DIDN&apos;T FIX IT FOR THE    
CYCLIST THAT WE REALLY LET DOWN 

01:41:13.639 --> 01:41:14.371
BUT WE DIDN&apos;T FIX IT FOR THE

01:42:53.672 --> 01:42:54.472
&gt;&gt; SO WE DO HAVE A FEW NUMBER   
OF INTERSECTIONS THAT THAT HAS  
THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW BUT   

01:42:54.474 --> 01:42:57.608
OF INTERSECTIONS THAT THAT HAS  
THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW BUT   
IT&apos;S WORTH NOTING ANOTHER POINT 

01:42:57.610 --> 01:43:01.244
THE FLASHING YELLOW ARROW BUT   
IT&apos;S WORTH NOTING ANOTHER POINT 
IS THAT THE SIGNAL EQUIPMENT    

01:43:01.246 --> 01:43:01.879
IT&apos;S WORTH NOTING ANOTHER POINT 
IS THAT THE SIGNAL EQUIPMENT    
THAT&apos;S FLASHING YELLOW ARROW    

01:43:01.881 --> 01:43:05.382
IS THAT THE SIGNAL EQUIPMENT    
THAT&apos;S FLASHING YELLOW ARROW    
ESBATI IS RELATIVELY NEW BUT    

01:43:05.384 --> 01:43:06.183
THAT&apos;S FLASHING YELLOW ARROW    
ESBATI IS RELATIVELY NEW BUT    
THE TYPE OF OPERATIONS USING    

01:43:06.185 --> 01:43:09.886
ESBATI IS RELATIVELY NEW BUT    
THE TYPE OF OPERATIONS USING    
PERMIT&apos;S AND PROTECTING THAT&apos;S  

01:43:09.888 --> 01:43:10.253
THE TYPE OF OPERATIONS USING

PERMIT&apos;S AND PROTECTING THAT&apos;S  
NOT NEW.                        
SO THE THE TYPE OF SIGNAL       

01:43:13.959 --> 01:43:17.194
NOT NEW.                        
SO THE THE TYPE OF SIGNAL       
EQUIPMENT PREDATES THE FLASHING 

01:43:17.196 --> 01:43:18.228
SO THE THE TYPE OF SIGNAL       
EQUIPMENT PREDATES THE FLASHING 
ARROW ARROW IS THE FLASHING RED 

01:43:18.230 --> 01:43:18.562
EQUIPMENT PREDATES THE FLASHING 
ARROW ARROW IS THE FLASHING RED 
BALL.                           

01:43:18.564 --> 01:43:22.099
ARROW ARROW IS THE FLASHING RED 
BALL.                           
SO IN THAT ONE WAS INSTALLED IS 

01:43:22.101 --> 01:43:22.867
BALL.                           
SO IN THAT ONE WAS INSTALLED IS 
KIND OF UNIQUE IN THE STATE     

01:43:22.869 --> 01:43:26.203
SO IN THAT ONE WAS INSTALLED IS 
KIND OF UNIQUE IN THE STATE     
OF MICHIGAN AND WE DID HAVE     

01:43:26.205 --> 01:43:29.773
KIND OF UNIQUE IN THE STATE     
OF MICHIGAN AND WE DID HAVE     
THAT FOR FOR WELL FOR A LONG    

01:43:29.775 --> 01:43:30.474
OF MICHIGAN AND WE DID HAVE     
THAT FOR FOR WELL FOR A LONG    
TIME I CANNOT REALLY NAME OR    

01:43:30.476 --> 01:43:32.977
THAT FOR FOR WELL FOR A LONG    
TIME I CANNOT REALLY NAME OR    
NUMBER HOW MANY BUT BEFORE THAT 

01:43:32.979 --> 01:43:36.613
TIME I CANNOT REALLY NAME OR    
NUMBER HOW MANY BUT BEFORE THAT 
YES WE WE DID HAVE THE ANOTHER  

01:43:36.615 --> 01:43:37.381
NUMBER HOW MANY BUT BEFORE THAT 
YES WE WE DID HAVE THE ANOTHER  
TYPE OF SIGNAL PROVIDING THE    

01:43:37.383 --> 01:43:40.651
YES WE WE DID HAVE THE ANOTHER  
TYPE OF SIGNAL PROVIDING THE    
SAME TYPE OF OPERATIONS.        

01:43:40.653 --> 01:43:44.955
TYPE OF SIGNAL PROVIDING THE    
SAME TYPE OF OPERATIONS.        
SO AN AND MOST OF THOSE         

01:43:44.957 --> 01:43:48.592
SAME TYPE OF OPERATIONS.        
SO AN AND MOST OF THOSE         
FLASHING RED HAVE BEEN REPLACED 

01:43:48.594 --> 01:43:52.462
SO AN AND MOST OF THOSE         
FLASHING RED HAVE BEEN REPLACED 
WITH FLASHING YELLOW AND THERE  

01:43:52.464 --> 01:43:53.397
FLASHING RED HAVE BEEN REPLACED 
WITH FLASHING YELLOW AND THERE  
ARE STILL ONE LAST LOCATION     

01:43:53.399 --> 01:43:56.533
WITH FLASHING YELLOW AND THERE  
ARE STILL ONE LAST LOCATION     
THAT&apos;S NEAR WASHTENAW AND       

01:43:56.535 --> 01:43:57.467

THAT&apos;S NEAR WASHTENAW AND       
POLLNER THAT&apos;S STILL THERE AND  
SO THAT&apos;S ON OUR LIST.          

01:44:00.939 --> 01:44:04.141
POLLNER THAT&apos;S STILL THERE AND  
SO THAT&apos;S ON OUR LIST.          
WE WE REQUESTED THAT TO KEEP

PROJECT AREA SIZE WOULD MAKE    
SENSE.                          

01:50:08.107 --> 01:50:10.974
PROJECT AREA SIZE WOULD MAKE

THAT SEEMS TO BE A WAY THAT     

01:50:10.976 --> 01:50:11.708

THAT SEEMS TO BE A WAY THAT     
ALLOWS US AFFORDS US THE        

01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:14.711
THAT SEEMS TO BE A WAY THAT     
ALLOWS US AFFORDS US THE

ALLOWS US AFFORDS US THE        
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT MULTIPLE     
DEVICES.                        

01:50:15.114 --> 01:50:15.979
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT MULTIPLE     
DEVICES.                        
WE TEND TO SPACE ESPECIALLY     

01:50:15.981 --> 01:50:19.215

HUNDRED FEET APART AT A         
MINIMUM.                        
SO IF WE ESTABLISH A MINIMUM    

01:50:26.024 --> 01:50:26.823
MINIMUM.

THE SUBCOMMITTEE DID RAISE A    
QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW,        
SOMETIMES THE PAVEMENT          

01:59:11.616 --> 01:59:12.281
QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW,        
SOMETIMES THE PAVEMENT

THIS SOUNDS MORE ACADEMIC THAN  
I THINK WE CAN AFFORD BUT SOME  

01:59:25.663 --> 01:59:26.362
THIS SOUNDS MORE ACADEMIC THAN  
I THINK WE CAN AFFORD BUT SOME  
SORT OF LIKE LONGITUDINAL       

01:59:26.364 --> 01:59:26.963
I THINK WE CAN AFFORD BUT SOME  
SORT OF LIKE LONGITUDINAL       
EXERCISE THAT IF WE COLLECT     

01:59:26.965 --> 01:59:29.865
SORT OF LIKE LONGITUDINAL       
EXERCISE THAT IF WE COLLECT     
DATA BEFORE COLLECT DATA AFTER  

01:59:29.867 --> 01:59:30.600
EXERCISE THAT IF WE COLLECT     
DATA BEFORE COLLECT DATA AFTER  
MAYBE WE CAN SEE WHAT THAT      

01:59:30.602 --> 01:59:33.536
DATA BEFORE COLLECT DATA AFTER  
MAYBE WE CAN SEE WHAT THAT      
IMPACT IS OVER TIME.

&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK WHERE WE&apos;RE AT   
RIGHT NOW ON THE STAGE IT&apos;S     
HARD FOR US TO PREDICT THAT AND 

01:59:36.641 --> 01:59:41.310
RIGHT NOW ON THE STAGE IT&apos;S     
HARD FOR US TO PREDICT THAT AND 
I WILL NOTE AND EVEN WE HAD A   

01:59:41.312 --> 01:59:41.978
HARD FOR US TO PREDICT THAT AND 
I WILL NOTE AND EVEN WE HAD A   
LOT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSION IN

I WILL NOTE AND EVEN WE HAD A   
LOT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSION IN   
THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS RAISED     

01:59:44.516 --> 01:59:45.314
LOT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSION IN

WHETHER TWENTY EIGHT MILES PER  
HOUR IS THE APPROPRIATE KIND    
OF THRESHOLD TO CONSIDER        

01:59:48.987 --> 01:59:52.589
HOUR IS THE APPROPRIATE KIND    
OF THRESHOLD TO CONSIDER        
VERTICAL DEVICES OR NOT.        

01:59:52.591 --> 01:59:53.590
OF THRESHOLD TO CONSIDER

VERTICAL DEVICES OR NOT.        
SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE&apos;RE   
STILL TRYING TO THINK THROUGH A

SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE&apos;RE   
STILL TRYING TO THINK THROUGH A 
LITTLE BIT.                     

01:59:57.261 --> 01:59:58.194
STILL TRYING TO THINK THROUGH A 
LITTLE BIT.                     
YOU KNOW, ADMITTEDLY 20 MILES   

01:59:58.196 --> 02:00:00.430
LITTLE BIT.

POSTED SPEED LIMIT OF TWENTY    
FIVE MILES PER HOUR.            
BY DEFINITION THERE ISN&apos;T A     

02:00:08.539 --> 02:00:11.807
FIVE MILES PER HOUR.            
BY DEFINITION THERE ISN&apos;T A     
SPEEDING PROBLEM SO IT DIDN&apos;T   

02:00:11.809 --> 02:00:12.475
BY DEFINITION THERE ISN&apos;T A     
SPEEDING PROBLEM SO IT DIDN&apos;T   
SEEM APPROPRIATE TO INCORPORATE 

02:00:12.477 --> 02:00:15.077
SPEEDING PROBLEM SO IT DIDN&apos;T   
SEEM APPROPRIATE TO INCORPORATE 
VERTICAL ELEMENTS AGAIN THINGS

SO WE KIND OF LOOKED AT SOME    
MIDPOINT AND THAT&apos;S HOW WE RANK 
AT TWENTY EIGHT I WILL ADMIT    

02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:27.590
MIDPOINT AND THAT&apos;S HOW WE RANK 
AT TWENTY EIGHT I WILL ADMIT    
THAT THERE&apos;S A LOT OF METHOD TO 

02:00:27.592 --> 02:00:28.257
AT TWENTY EIGHT I WILL ADMIT    
THAT THERE&apos;S A LOT OF METHOD TO 
THAT MADNESS ASIDE FROM WHAT I  

02:00:28.259 --> 02:00:30.026
THAT THERE&apos;S A LOT OF METHOD TO 
THAT MADNESS ASIDE FROM WHAT I  
JUST EXPLAINED SOME OTHER       

02:00:30.028 --> 02:00:33.496
THAT MADNESS ASIDE FROM WHAT I  
JUST EXPLAINED SOME OTHER       
THINGS THAT WE MENTIONED ABOUT  

02:00:33.498 --> 02:00:37.767
JUST EXPLAINED SOME OTHER       
THINGS THAT WE MENTIONED ABOUT  
HOW WE MIGHT ALSO LOOK TO FOCUS 

02:00:37.769 --> 02:00:38.668
THINGS THAT WE MENTIONED ABOUT  
HOW WE MIGHT ALSO LOOK TO FOCUS 
IN ON AREAS FOR POSSIBLE        

02:00:38.670 --> 02:00:42.405
HOW WE MIGHT ALSO LOOK TO FOCUS 
IN ON AREAS FOR POSSIBLE        
TRAFFIC CALMING IS YES WE CAN   

02:00:42.407 --> 02:00:43.139
IN ON AREAS FOR POSSIBLE        
TRAFFIC CALMING IS YES WE CAN   
GO OUT AND COLLECT SPEED DATA   

02:00:43.141 --> 02:00:46.209
TRAFFIC CALMING IS YES WE CAN   
GO OUT AND COLLECT SPEED DATA   
BUT THEN DO WE ALSO HAVE A      

02:00:46.211 --> 02:00:47.077
GO OUT AND COLLECT SPEED DATA   
BUT THEN DO WE ALSO HAVE A      
HISTORY OF WHERE THERE ARE PAST 

02:00:47.079 --> 02:00:50.380
BUT THEN DO WE ALSO HAVE A      
HISTORY OF WHERE THERE ARE PAST

NEIGHBORHOOD RESURFACING THAT   
WE CAN CONSIDER SOME ADDITIONAL 
TRAFFIC?                        

02:01:04.896 --> 02:01:05.829
WE CAN CONSIDER SOME ADDITIONAL 
TRAFFIC?

IN OTHER INSTANCES IT MAY BE    
BEYOND THAT DEFINED AREA IF     
THEY HAVE A DESIGNATED WALKING

BEYOND THAT DEFINED AREA IF     
THEY HAVE A DESIGNATED WALKING  
AROUND FOR EXAMPLE, WE&apos;RE ALSO

MIDDLE SCHOOL MIGHT BE          
DIFFERENT AROUND THE NEEDS FROM 
HIGH SCHOOL AND WHAT DOES THAT  

02:02:38.689 --> 02:02:39.054
DIFFERENT AROUND THE NEEDS FROM 
HIGH SCHOOL AND WHAT DOES THAT  
LOOK LIKE?                      

02:02:39.056 --> 02:02:42.558
HIGH SCHOOL AND WHAT DOES THAT  
LOOK LIKE?                      
YOU KNOW AND JUST TRYING TO

YOU KNOW AND JUST TRYING TO     
THINK THROUGH WHAT THAT IS.     
SO THERE&apos;S STILL A LOT          

02:02:45.997 --> 02:02:46.863
THINK THROUGH WHAT THAT IS.     
SO THERE&apos;S STILL A LOT          
OF QUESTIONS I THINK THAT WE    

02:02:46.865 --> 02:02:47.530
SO THERE&apos;S STILL A LOT          
OF QUESTIONS I THINK THAT WE    
NEED TO WORK THROUGH,           

02:02:47.532 --> 02:02:48.198
OF QUESTIONS I THINK THAT WE    
NEED TO WORK THROUGH,           
ESPECIALLY WORKING WITH THE     

02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.232

ESPECIALLY WORKING WITH THE     
SCHOOLS.                        
WE HAVE SOME TIME OBVIOUSLY TO

SCHOOLS.                        
WE HAVE SOME TIME OBVIOUSLY TO  
CONTINUE TO TALK THROUGH THIS   

02:02:53.171 --> 02:02:54.003
WE HAVE SOME TIME OBVIOUSLY TO  
CONTINUE TO TALK THROUGH THIS   
BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE      

02:02:54.005 --> 02:02:57.173

BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE      
TRYING TO START FORMULATING     

02:02:57.175 --> 02:02:57.841
BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE      
TRYING TO START FORMULATING     
IDEAS AROUND THE SUBCOMMITTEE   

02:02:57.843 --> 02:02:58.742
TRYING TO START FORMULATING     
IDEAS AROUND THE SUBCOMMITTEE   
GAVE US A LOT OF REALLY GOOD    

02:02:58.744 --> 02:03:01.811
IDEAS AROUND THE SUBCOMMITTEE   
GAVE US A LOT OF REALLY GOOD    
THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT REALLY 

02:03:01.813 --> 02:03:02.545
GAVE US A LOT OF REALLY GOOD    
THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT REALLY 
HOW ARE WE DEFINING THOSE RULES 

02:03:02.547 --> 02:03:05.181
THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT REALLY 
HOW ARE WE DEFINING THOSE RULES 
TO SCHOOLS?                     

02:03:05.183 --> 02:03:09.185
HOW ARE WE DEFINING THOSE RULES 
TO SCHOOLS?                     
SHOULD WE ALSO CONSIDER PRIVATE 

02:03:09.187 --> 02:03:13.289
TO SCHOOLS?                     
SHOULD WE ALSO CONSIDER PRIVATE 
SCHOOLS?                        

02:03:13.291 --> 02:03:14.157
SHOULD WE ALSO CONSIDER PRIVATE 
SCHOOLS?                        
WHAT ABOUT DAYCARES AND         

02:03:14.159 --> 02:03:20.030
SCHOOLS?                        
WHAT ABOUT DAYCARES AND         
PRESCHOOLS PICK UP AND DROP     

02:03:20.032 --> 02:03:24.133
WHAT ABOUT DAYCARES AND         
PRESCHOOLS PICK UP AND DROP     
AREAS MAYBE BEYOND THE ACTUAL   

02:03:24.135 --> 02:03:24.801
PRESCHOOLS PICK UP AND DROP     
AREAS MAYBE BEYOND THE ACTUAL   
ROADWAY OR DRIVEWAYS INTO       

02:03:24.803 --> 02:03:27.536
AREAS MAYBE BEYOND THE ACTUAL   
ROADWAY OR DRIVEWAYS INTO       
SCHOOL NEAR REMOTE DROP OFFS?   

02:03:27.538 --> 02:03:28.404
ROADWAY OR DRIVEWAYS INTO       
SCHOOL NEAR REMOTE DROP OFFS?   
WELL, THAT&apos;S TECHNICALLY NOT    

02:03:28.406 --> 02:03:29.071
SCHOOL NEAR REMOTE DROP OFFS?   
WELL, THAT&apos;S TECHNICALLY NOT    
CONSIDERED A TRAFFIC HOMING     

02:03:29.073 --> 02:03:29.339
WELL, THAT&apos;S TECHNICALLY NOT    
CONSIDERED A TRAFFIC HOMING     
DEVICE.                         

02:03:29.341 --> 02:03:32.174
CONSIDERED A TRAFFIC HOMING     
DEVICE.                         
IT REALLY CAN HAVE A TRAFFIC    

02:03:32.176 --> 02:03:32.875
DEVICE.                         
IT REALLY CAN HAVE A TRAFFIC    
CALMING SORT OF EFFECT BECAUSE  

02:03:32.877 --> 02:03:35.678
IT REALLY CAN HAVE A TRAFFIC    
CALMING SORT OF EFFECT BECAUSE  
YOU&apos;RE DISPLACING SOME OF THE   

02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:36.546
CALMING SORT OF EFFECT BECAUSE  
YOU&apos;RE DISPLACING SOME OF THE   
TRAFFIC THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE 

02:03:36.548 --> 02:03:37.179
YOU&apos;RE DISPLACING SOME OF THE   
TRAFFIC THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE 
IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY       

02:03:37.181 --> 02:03:39.915
TRAFFIC THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE 
IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY       
OF WHERE KIDS ARE WALKING AND   

02:03:39.917 --> 02:03:40.316
IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY       
OF WHERE KIDS ARE WALKING AND   
BIKING.                         

02:03:40.318 --> 02:03:40.983
OF WHERE KIDS ARE WALKING AND   
BIKING.                         
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING      

02:03:40.985 --> 02:03:42.718
BIKING.                         
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING      
AGAIN WE CAN KIND FACTOR INTO   

02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:43.386
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING      
AGAIN WE CAN KIND FACTOR INTO   
THE SCHOOL TRAFFIC COMING       

02:03:43.388 --> 02:03:43.986
AGAIN WE CAN KIND FACTOR INTO   
THE SCHOOL TRAFFIC COMING       
TOOLKIT THAT&apos;S A LITTLE         

02:03:43.988 --> 02:03:46.722
THE SCHOOL TRAFFIC COMING       
TOOLKIT THAT&apos;S A LITTLE         
DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER        

02:03:46.724 --> 02:03:47.456
TOOLKIT THAT&apos;S A LITTLE         
DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER        
TRAFFIC CALMING TOOLKIT.        

02:03:47.458 --> 02:03:48.157
DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER        
TRAFFIC CALMING TOOLKIT.        
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY     

02:03:48.159 --> 02:03:48.825
TRAFFIC CALMING TOOLKIT.        
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY     
GOOD RECOMMENDATION FROM THE    

02:03:48.827 --> 02:03:54.296
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY     
GOOD RECOMMENDATION FROM THE    
SUBCOMMITTEE AND THEN THE       

02:03:54.298 --> 02:03:55.031
GOOD RECOMMENDATION FROM THE    
SUBCOMMITTEE AND THEN THE       
SUBCOMMITTEE ALSO WAS CORRECT   

02:03:55.033 --> 02:03:55.765
SUBCOMMITTEE AND THEN THE       
SUBCOMMITTEE ALSO WAS CORRECT   
TO POINT OUT THAT IT&apos;S NOT      

02:03:55.767 --> 02:03:58.801
SUBCOMMITTEE ALSO WAS CORRECT   
TO POINT OUT THAT IT&apos;S NOT      
ALWAYS JUST SPEED ABOUT AROUND  

02:03:58.803 --> 02:03:59.068
TO POINT OUT THAT IT&apos;S NOT      
ALWAYS JUST SPEED ABOUT AROUND  
SCHOOLS.                        

02:03:59.070 --> 02:04:02.405
ALWAYS JUST SPEED ABOUT AROUND  
SCHOOLS.                        
SOMETIMES IT&apos;S BAD BEHAVIOR FOR 

02:04:02.407 --> 02:04:03.406
SCHOOLS.                        
SOMETIMES IT&apos;S BAD BEHAVIOR FOR 
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE EVER SEEN 

02:04:03.408 --> 02:04:05.541
SOMETIMES IT&apos;S BAD BEHAVIOR FOR 
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE EVER SEEN 
MORNING DROP OFF OR AFTERNOON   

02:04:05.543 --> 02:04:06.476
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE EVER SEEN 
MORNING DROP OFF OR AFTERNOON   
PICK UP ON MILLER, YOU KNOW     

02:04:06.478 --> 02:04:09.778
MORNING DROP OFF OR AFTERNOON   
PICK UP ON MILLER, YOU KNOW     
PEOPLE ARE PARKING THE BIKE     

02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:10.113
PICK UP ON MILLER, YOU KNOW     
PEOPLE ARE PARKING THE BIKE     
LANE.                           

02:04:10.115 --> 02:04:10.780
PEOPLE ARE PARKING THE BIKE     
LANE.                           
THEY&apos;RE PARKING ACROSS THE      

02:04:10.782 --> 02:04:11.113
LANE.                           
THEY&apos;RE PARKING ACROSS THE      
CROSSWALK.                      

02:04:11.115 --> 02:04:14.316
THEY&apos;RE PARKING ACROSS THE      
CROSSWALK.                      
WE GET A LOT OF AREAS WHERE     

02:04:14.318 --> 02:04:17.686
CROSSWALK.                      
WE GET A LOT OF AREAS WHERE     
PARENTS ARE NOT BEHAVING LIKE   

02:04:17.688 --> 02:04:21.290
WE GET A LOT OF AREAS WHERE     
PARENTS ARE NOT BEHAVING LIKE   
ADULTS UNFORTUNATELY AND NOT    

02:04:21.292 --> 02:04:21.958
PARENTS ARE NOT BEHAVING LIKE   
ADULTS UNFORTUNATELY AND NOT    
BEHAVING APPROPRIATELY.         

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:22.691
ADULTS UNFORTUNATELY AND NOT    
BEHAVING APPROPRIATELY.         
AND SO IT&apos;S NOT JUST ABOUT      

02:04:22.693 --> 02:04:23.025
BEHAVING APPROPRIATELY.         
AND SO IT&apos;S NOT JUST ABOUT      
SPEED.                          

02:04:23.027 --> 02:04:24.827
AND SO IT&apos;S NOT JUST ABOUT      
SPEED.                          
IT&apos;S ALSO ABOUT SOME BAD        

02:04:24.829 --> 02:04:28.697
SPEED.                          
IT&apos;S ALSO ABOUT SOME BAD        
BEHAVIORS OF MOTORISTS AND THEN 

02:04:28.699 --> 02:04:29.498
IT&apos;S ALSO ABOUT SOME BAD        
BEHAVIORS OF MOTORISTS AND THEN 
JUST FLAGGING SOME OTHER        

02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:33.068
BEHAVIORS OF MOTORISTS AND THEN 
JUST FLAGGING SOME OTHER        
OPPORTUNITIES ABOUT WHO WE CAN  

02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:33.402
JUST FLAGGING SOME OTHER        
OPPORTUNITIES ABOUT WHO WE CAN  
WORK WITH.                      

02:04:33.404 --> 02:04:34.002
OPPORTUNITIES ABOUT WHO WE CAN  
WORK WITH.                      
AGAIN, THESE ARE                

02:04:34.004 --> 02:04:34.603
WORK WITH.                      
AGAIN, THESE ARE                
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE        

02:04:34.605 --> 02:04:38.040
AGAIN, THESE ARE                
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE        
SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT YOU KNOW, IS 

02:04:38.042 --> 02:04:38.574
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE        
SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT YOU KNOW, IS 
THE SCHOOL PROPER?              

02:04:38.576 --> 02:04:41.510
SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT YOU KNOW, IS 
THE SCHOOL PROPER?              
IS IT ADMINISTRATOR?            

02:04:41.512 --> 02:04:42.445
THE SCHOOL PROPER?              
IS IT ADMINISTRATOR?            
IS IT THE PARENT TEACHER        

02:04:42.447 --> 02:04:45.147
IS IT ADMINISTRATOR?            
IS IT THE PARENT TEACHER        
ORGANIZATIONS OR IS IT THE      

02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.848
IS IT THE PARENT TEACHER        
ORGANIZATIONS OR IS IT THE      
PRINCIPALS AND THINGS LIKE      

02:04:45.850 --> 02:04:46.049
ORGANIZATIONS OR IS IT THE      
PRINCIPALS AND THINGS LIKE      
THAT?                           

02:04:46.051 --> 02:04:48.417
PRINCIPALS AND THINGS LIKE      
THAT?                           
SO I THINK AGAIN THESE ARE      

02:04:48.419 --> 02:04:49.485
THAT?                           
SO I THINK AGAIN THESE ARE      
GREAT IDEAS FOR US TO CONTINUE  

02:04:49.487 --> 02:04:52.321
SO I THINK AGAIN THESE ARE      
GREAT IDEAS FOR US TO CONTINUE  
TO TEASE OUT WHAT THE SCHOOLS   

02:04:52.323 --> 02:04:53.322
GREAT IDEAS FOR US TO CONTINUE  
TO TEASE OUT WHAT THE SCHOOLS   
THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION  

02:04:53.324 --> 02:04:56.992
TO TEASE OUT WHAT THE SCHOOLS   
THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION  
ABOUT TRAFFIC CALMING PETITIONS 

02:04:56.994 --> 02:04:57.726
THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION  
ABOUT TRAFFIC CALMING PETITIONS 
THAT ARE AROUND NEIGHBORHOOD    

02:04:57.728 --> 02:05:00.896
ABOUT TRAFFIC CALMING PETITIONS 
THAT ARE AROUND NEIGHBORHOOD    
INITIATED TRAFFIC CALMING       

02:05:00.898 --> 02:05:01.531
THAT ARE AROUND NEIGHBORHOOD    
INITIATED TRAFFIC CALMING       
PETITIONS AROUND SCHOOLS AND    

02:05:01.533 --> 02:05:04.767
INITIATED TRAFFIC CALMING       
PETITIONS AROUND SCHOOLS AND    
WHAT ROLE THE SCHOOL CAN PLAY   

02:05:04.769 --> 02:05:05.168
PETITIONS AROUND SCHOOLS AND    
WHAT ROLE THE SCHOOL CAN PLAY   
IN THAT.                        

02:05:05.170 --> 02:05:06.235
WHAT ROLE THE SCHOOL CAN PLAY   
IN THAT.                        
AND WE KIND OF CLARIFIED SOME   

02:05:06.237 --> 02:05:08.871
IN THAT.                        
AND WE KIND OF CLARIFIED SOME   
OF THE ENGAGEMENT WE CURRENTLY  

02:05:08.873 --> 02:05:09.639
AND WE KIND OF CLARIFIED SOME   
OF THE ENGAGEMENT WE CURRENTLY  
DO BUT MAYBE WE CAN REEVALUATE  

02:05:09.641 --> 02:05:10.639
OF THE ENGAGEMENT WE CURRENTLY  
DO BUT MAYBE WE CAN REEVALUATE  
IF THAT CAN BE DONE A LITTLE    

02:05:10.641 --> 02:05:19.114
DO BUT MAYBE WE CAN REEVALUATE  
IF THAT CAN BE DONE A LITTLE    
DIFFERENTLY AND I&apos;LL END ON THE 

02:05:19.116 --> 02:05:19.882
IF THAT CAN BE DONE A LITTLE    
DIFFERENTLY AND I&apos;LL END ON THE 
SCHOOL NOTE THAT YOU KNOW, IN   

02:05:19.884 --> 02:05:21.617
DIFFERENTLY AND I&apos;LL END ON THE
