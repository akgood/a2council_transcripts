IT'S JUST A MATTER OF OF MANY   
OF THE COMPLAINTS OFFICERS      

00:29:18.483 --> 00:29:19.348
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF OF MANY

OF THEIR TRAINING AND I DON'T   
THINK WE NEED TO LIKE RAISE THE 

00:29:36.968 --> 00:29:40.569
OF THEIR TRAINING AND I DON'T   
THINK WE NEED TO LIKE RAISE THE 
FLAG RED FLAGS ABOUT SOME       

00:29:40.571 --> 00:29:41.437
THINK WE NEED TO LIKE RAISE THE 
FLAG RED FLAGS ABOUT SOME       
OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE WE CAN  

00:29:41.439 --> 00:29:44.773
FLAG RED FLAGS ABOUT SOME       
OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE WE CAN  
RECOMMEND INCREASING THE        

00:29:44.775 --> 00:29:48.277
OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE WE CAN  
RECOMMEND INCREASING THE        
TRAINING THAT ALL THE OFFICERS  

00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:49.078
RECOMMEND INCREASING THE        
TRAINING THAT ALL THE OFFICERS  
BECOME AWARE OF OF THOSE        

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:55.752
TRAINING THAT ALL THE OFFICERS  
BECOME AWARE OF OF THOSE        
POLICIES AND WHEN THEY ARE      

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:11.968

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.868
OR ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS THEY  
HAVE THAT IN MIND.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:13.569
HAVE THAT IN MIND.              
SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY REDUCE   
THE KIND OF HARD FEELINGS       

00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:14.270
SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY REDUCE   
THE KIND OF HARD FEELINGS
