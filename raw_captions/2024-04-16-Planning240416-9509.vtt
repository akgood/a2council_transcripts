CHANCE THAT THE CITY MIGHT BE   
ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE SOMETHING   
WITH A WAIVER FOR A WHILE       

00:40:45.198 --> 00:40:46.063

ABOUT STORM SEWER LIKE THE      
DENSER IT IS AND MORE           
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE PROBABLY THE 

00:40:50.737 --> 00:40:51.468

IMPERVIOUS SURFACE PROBABLY THE 
MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO ADDRESS 
STORMWATER WITHOUT CONNECTION   

00:40:53.506 --> 00:40:54.372
MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO ADDRESS 
STORMWATER WITHOUT CONNECTION

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:57.741
TO THE CITY'S SYSTEM, THE LESS  
DENSE IT IS, THE MORE LIKELY IT 
IS THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO    

00:40:57.743 --> 00:41:00.578
DENSE IT IS, THE MORE LIKELY IT 
IS THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO    
ACCOMMODATE STORMWATER RUNOFF   

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.379
IS THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO

SO SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO PUT 

00:41:05.485 --> 00:41:06.083
SYSTEM.                         
SO SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO PUT 
THAT IN THE CONTEXT.            

00:41:06.085 --> 00:41:06.817
SO SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO PUT 
THAT IN THE CONTEXT.            
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD  

00:41:06.819 --> 00:41:08.786
THAT IN THE CONTEXT.            
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD  
I DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY        

00:41:08.788 --> 00:41:09.554
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD  
I DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY        
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ONE D 

00:41:09.556 --> 00:41:11.855
I DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY        
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ONE D 
ACTUALLY IT IMPROVES PROBABLY   

00:41:11.857 --> 00:41:12.523
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ONE D 
ACTUALLY IT IMPROVES PROBABLY   
THE POTENTIAL LONG TERM TO      

00:41:12.525 --> 00:41:13.257
ACTUALLY IT IMPROVES PROBABLY   
THE POTENTIAL LONG TERM TO      
FINANCE SOMETHING SHOULD        

00:41:13.259 --> 00:41:16.394
THE POTENTIAL LONG TERM TO      
FINANCE SOMETHING SHOULD        
SOMEBODY CHOOSE TO DO THAT IN

FINANCE SOMETHING SHOULD        
SOMEBODY CHOOSE TO DO THAT IN   
ADVANCE OF SOME YET TO BE

YES.                            
COMMISSIONER MILLS, BASED ON    
WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING       

00:41:24.804 --> 00:41:28.105
COMMISSIONER MILLS, BASED ON    
WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING       
THOUGH ABOUT THE WELL IS IT     

00:41:28.107 --> 00:41:31.575
WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING       
THOUGH ABOUT THE WELL IS IT     
BEING ONE D JEOPARDIZE THE WELL 

00:41:31.577 --> 00:41:32.810
THOUGH ABOUT THE WELL IS IT     
BEING ONE D JEOPARDIZE THE WELL 
,FIRST OF ALL, DO WE KNOW IF    

00:41:32.812 --> 00:41:33.577
BEING ONE D JEOPARDIZE THE WELL 
,FIRST OF ALL, DO WE KNOW IF    
THERE'S A WELL ON THE SITE      

00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:35.379
,FIRST OF ALL, DO WE KNOW IF    
THERE'S A WELL ON THE SITE      
CURRENTLY THERE'S NOT A WELL ON 

00:41:35.381 --> 00:41:36.180
THERE'S A WELL ON THE SITE      
CURRENTLY THERE'S NOT A WELL ON 
THE SITE CURRENTLY AND YOU IF   

00:41:36.182 --> 00:41:37.014
CURRENTLY THERE'S NOT A WELL ON 
THE SITE CURRENTLY AND YOU IF   
YOU WANT TO BUILD A HOUSE NEED  

00:41:37.016 --> 00:41:38.649
THE SITE CURRENTLY AND YOU IF   
YOU WANT TO BUILD A HOUSE NEED  
WATER.                          

00:41:38.651 --> 00:41:39.750
YOU WANT TO BUILD A HOUSE NEED  
WATER.                          
>> SO THE QUESTION IS IF IT'S   

00:41:39.752 --> 00:41:42.553
WATER.                          
>> SO THE QUESTION IS IF IT'S   
OUR ONE D DOES THAT JEOPARDIZE  

00:41:42.555 --> 00:41:43.487
>> SO THE QUESTION IS IF IT'S   
OUR ONE D DOES THAT JEOPARDIZE  
THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GET I   

00:41:43.489 --> 00:41:44.221
OUR ONE D DOES THAT JEOPARDIZE  
THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GET I   
DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULD THE      

00:41:44.223 --> 00:41:47.091
THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GET I   
DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULD THE      
PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT THAT     

00:41:47.093 --> 00:41:47.492
DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULD THE      
PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT THAT     
HAPPENS THERE.                  

00:41:47.494 --> 00:41:48.425
PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT THAT     
HAPPENS THERE.                  
SO AGAIN I THINK AS THE         

00:41:48.427 --> 00:41:51.095
HAPPENS THERE.                  
SO AGAIN I THINK AS THE         
PETITIONER INDICATED AS LONG AS 

00:41:51.097 --> 00:41:51.763
SO AGAIN I THINK AS THE         
PETITIONER INDICATED AS LONG AS 
IT DOESN'T THEY PROBABLY HAVE   

00:41:51.765 --> 00:41:52.229
PETITIONER INDICATED AS LONG AS 
IT DOESN'T THEY PROBABLY HAVE   
PLANS FOR IT.                   

00:41:52.231 --> 00:41:54.532
IT DOESN'T THEY PROBABLY HAVE   
PLANS FOR IT.                   
I DON'T I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH   

00:41:54.534 --> 00:41:55.466
PLANS FOR IT.                   
I DON'T I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH   
THOSE BUT IF THOSE PLANS ARE    

00:41:55.468 --> 00:41:56.333
I DON'T I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH   
THOSE BUT IF THOSE PLANS ARE    
FOR A RELATIVELY MODEST SCALE   

00:41:56.335 --> 00:41:59.203
THOSE BUT IF THOSE PLANS ARE    
FOR A RELATIVELY MODEST SCALE   
OF DEVELOPMENT, A HOME THAT'S   

00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:00.003
FOR A RELATIVELY MODEST SCALE   
OF DEVELOPMENT, A HOME THAT'S   
PROBABLY GOING TO INCREASE THE  

00:42:00.005 --> 00:42:02.306
OF DEVELOPMENT, A HOME THAT'S   
PROBABLY GOING TO INCREASE THE  
CHANCES I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE   

00:42:02.308 --> 00:42:02.973
PROBABLY GOING TO INCREASE THE  
CHANCES I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE   
PUBLIC SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR   

00:42:02.975 --> 00:42:03.574
CHANCES I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE   
PUBLIC SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR   
BY ANY STRETCH BUT MY           

00:42:03.576 --> 00:42:06.377
PUBLIC SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR   
BY ANY STRETCH BUT MY           
PERCEPTION IS IF THAT WERE      

00:42:06.379 --> 00:42:07.177
BY ANY STRETCH BUT MY           
PERCEPTION IS IF THAT WERE      
DEVELOPED INTO TEN HOMES UNDER  

00:42:07.179 --> 00:42:10.247
PERCEPTION IS IF THAT WERE      
DEVELOPED INTO TEN HOMES UNDER  
THE SMALLER LOT FOR R&D THAT    

00:42:10.249 --> 00:42:10.982
DEVELOPED INTO TEN HOMES UNDER  
THE SMALLER LOT FOR R&D THAT    
MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT TO      

00:42:10.984 --> 00:42:13.817
THE SMALLER LOT FOR R&D THAT

OF PROCESSING TIME FROM MY      
PERSPECTIVE AS TO HOW THAT HOW  

01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:08.210
OF PROCESSING TIME FROM MY      
PERSPECTIVE AS TO HOW THAT HOW  
THAT IMPACTS THE STAFF WORK     

01:22:08.212 --> 01:22:11.479
PERSPECTIVE AS TO HOW THAT HOW  
THAT IMPACTS THE STAFF WORK     
THAT WE DO IN THE CONTEXT OF ,  

01:22:11.481 --> 01:22:14.983
THAT IMPACTS THE STAFF WORK     
THAT WE DO IN THE CONTEXT OF ,  
YOU KNOW, FIVE PD STANDARDS.    

01:22:14.985 --> 01:22:18.953
THAT WE DO IN THE CONTEXT OF ,  
YOU KNOW, FIVE PD STANDARDS.    
HOW DOES THAT DIRECTIVE IMPACT  

01:22:18.955 --> 01:22:22.524
YOU KNOW, FIVE PD STANDARDS.    
HOW DOES THAT DIRECTIVE IMPACT  
ONE OR ALL OF THOSE FIVE PD     

01:22:22.526 --> 01:22:22.925
HOW DOES THAT DIRECTIVE IMPACT  
ONE OR ALL OF THOSE FIVE PD     
STANDARDS?                      

01:22:22.927 --> 01:22:26.661
ONE OR ALL OF THOSE FIVE PD     
STANDARDS?                      
IT DOESN'T SUPERSEDE THOSE BUT  

01:22:26.663 --> 01:22:27.595
STANDARDS?                      
IT DOESN'T SUPERSEDE THOSE BUT  
IT MIGHT INFLUENCE HOW WE HOW   

01:22:27.597 --> 01:22:29.330
IT DOESN'T SUPERSEDE THOSE BUT  
IT MIGHT INFLUENCE HOW WE HOW   
WE ADDRESS THOSE AND SO I THINK 

01:22:29.332 --> 01:22:33.835
IT MIGHT INFLUENCE HOW WE HOW   
WE ADDRESS THOSE AND SO I THINK 
IT IS I THINK IT'LL BE I THINK  

01:22:33.837 --> 01:22:37.005
WE ADDRESS THOSE AND SO I THINK 
IT IS I THINK IT'LL BE I THINK  
IT'S A WORTHWHILE DISCUSSION.   

01:22:37.007 --> 01:22:37.873
IT IS I THINK IT'LL BE I THINK  
IT'S A WORTHWHILE DISCUSSION.   
I THINK BRINGING THE PLANNING   

01:22:37.875 --> 01:22:38.674
IT'S A WORTHWHILE DISCUSSION.   
I THINK BRINGING THE PLANNING   
COMMISSION IN THAT DISCUSSION   

01:22:38.676 --> 01:22:40.809
I THINK BRINGING THE PLANNING   
COMMISSION IN THAT DISCUSSION   
TOO AS WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE    

01:22:40.811 --> 01:22:41.743
COMMISSION IN THAT DISCUSSION   
TOO AS WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE    
SOME AGENCY AND HOW YOU REVIEW  

01:22:41.745 --> 01:22:42.277
TOO AS WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE    
SOME AGENCY AND HOW YOU REVIEW

01:22:42.279 --> 01:22:43.278
SOME AGENCY AND HOW YOU REVIEW  
THESE AS WELL.                  
SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE   

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.647

I THINK HOW HOW WE WANT TO      

01:22:52.088 --> 01:22:52.854
THE TABLE.                      
I THINK HOW HOW WE WANT TO      
INCORPORATE IT INTO OUR PROCESS 

01:22:52.856 --> 01:22:53.455
I THINK HOW HOW WE WANT TO

RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE REASONS     
BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE A     
BALANCE.                        

01:23:01.498 --> 01:23:03.932

BALANCE.                        
HOW I THINK I THINK SOME MIGHT  

01:23:03.934 --> 01:23:07.269
