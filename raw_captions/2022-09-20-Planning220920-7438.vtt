GENERATING COMMUNITY GENERATING 
MORE THAN A THOUSAND JOBS A     
YEAR.                           

01:02:59.228 --> 01:03:02.296
MORE THAN A THOUSAND JOBS A     
YEAR.                           
MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:22.684
DEVELOPMENT IS MITIGATING SOME  
OF THAT COMMUTER TRAFFIC        
BECAUSE WE&amp;apos;RE CREATING PLACES   

01:03:22.686 --> 01:03:23.351
OF THAT COMMUTER TRAFFIC        
BECAUSE WE&amp;apos;RE CREATING PLACES

LOOKED AT THIS JUST KIND        
OF DESIGN REVIEW THERE WAS A    

01:26:48.423 --> 01:26:51.257
LOOKED AT THIS JUST KIND        
OF DESIGN REVIEW THERE WAS A    
GREEN ROOF AND YOU HAVE A LOT   

01:26:51.259 --> 01:26:51.691

01:26:59.267 --> 01:27:03.003
TO ADD THE TWO COMMENTS.        
ONE, BIKES ARE HEAVY SO DOING   
WARM OUT MEANS THAT A BIKE ROOM 

01:27:03.005 --> 01:27:05.405
ONE, BIKES ARE HEAVY SO DOING   
WARM OUT MEANS THAT A BIKE ROOM 
MIGHT NOT BE VERY USABLE IF     

01:27:05.407 --> 01:27:06.139
WARM OUT MEANS THAT A BIKE ROOM 
MIGHT NOT BE VERY USABLE IF

IS THERE INNOVATION IN LAND USE 
AND ARE WE FURTHERING THE       
STATED GOALS AND PHYSICAL       

01:31:59.867 --> 01:32:02.568

CHARACTER OF THE ADOPTED LAND   
USE?                            
SO I DURING THIS PERIOD I DID   

01:32:03.872 --> 01:32:05.771
USE?                            
SO I DURING THIS PERIOD I DID   
REVIEW THE 2009 LAND

I TRY TO REWRITE WITH TWENTY    
EIGHT HUNDRED AND THEN REALLY   

01:32:55.624 --> 01:32:56.556
I TRY TO REWRITE WITH TWENTY    
EIGHT HUNDRED AND THEN REALLY   
ON THE ROUNDABOUT THERE&amp;apos;S ABOUT 

01:32:56.558 --> 01:32:59.192
EIGHT HUNDRED AND THEN REALLY   
ON THE ROUNDABOUT THERE&amp;apos;S ABOUT 
EIGHT THOUSAND CARS REVERSING   

01:32:59.194 --> 01:32:59.859
ON THE ROUNDABOUT THERE&amp;apos;S ABOUT 
EIGHT THOUSAND CARS REVERSING   
THERE ON AN AVERAGE DAILY       

01:32:59.861 --> 01:33:00.259
EIGHT THOUSAND CARS REVERSING   
THERE ON AN AVERAGE DAILY       
TRAFFIC.                        

01:33:00.261 --> 01:33:03.195
THERE ON AN AVERAGE DAILY       
TRAFFIC.                        
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE TO       

01:33:03.197 --> 01:33:03.896
TRAFFIC.                        
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE TO       
INDICATE THE RELATIVE SCALE     

01:33:03.898 --> 01:33:04.597
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE TO       
INDICATE THE RELATIVE SCALE     
OF ADDING EIGHTY UNITS BECAUSE  

01:33:04.599 --> 01:33:07.700
INDICATE THE RELATIVE SCALE     
OF ADDING EIGHTY UNITS BECAUSE  
I SEVENTY NINE I JUST WANT TO   

01:33:07.702 --> 01:33:08.435
OF ADDING EIGHTY UNITS BECAUSE  
I SEVENTY NINE I JUST WANT TO   
BE AGAIN VERY MINDFUL BECAUSE   

01:33:08.437 --> 01:33:11.571
I SEVENTY NINE I JUST WANT TO   
BE AGAIN VERY MINDFUL BECAUSE   
IT IS IT&amp;apos;S A LOT TO COME HERE   

01:33:11.573 --> 01:33:12.438
BE AGAIN VERY MINDFUL BECAUSE   
IT IS IT&amp;apos;S A LOT TO COME HERE   
AND SPEAK AND YOU KNOW TO BE    

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.106
IT IS IT&amp;apos;S A LOT TO COME HERE   
AND SPEAK AND YOU KNOW TO BE    
CIVICALLY ENGAGED.              

01:33:14.108 --> 01:33:15.174
AND SPEAK AND YOU KNOW TO BE    
CIVICALLY ENGAGED.              
SO AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE    

01:33:15.176 --> 01:33:18.110
CIVICALLY ENGAGED.              
SO AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE    
THAT THE WAY WE CAN IMPROVE     

01:33:18.112 --> 01:33:18.811
SO AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE    
THAT THE WAY WE CAN IMPROVE     
THIS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE JOBS  

01:33:18.813 --> 01:33:19.578
THAT THE WAY WE CAN IMPROVE     
THIS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE JOBS  
AND HOUSING AND BALANCE IS      

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:22.214
THIS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE JOBS  
AND HOUSING AND BALANCE IS      
STRENGTHENING ON MOTORIZED      

01:33:22.216 --> 01:33:22.482
AND HOUSING AND BALANCE IS      
STRENGTHENING ON MOTORIZED      
TRANSIT.                        

01:33:22.484 --> 01:33:23.416
STRENGTHENING ON MOTORIZED      
TRANSIT.                        
SO I THINK THE CONTRIBUTION TO  

01:33:23.418 --> 01:33:26.352
TRANSIT.                        
SO I THINK THE CONTRIBUTION TO  
THE OUR CROSSWALKS THAT&amp;apos;S       

01:33:26.354 --> 01:33:26.919
SO I THINK THE CONTRIBUTION TO  
THE OUR CROSSWALKS THAT&amp;apos;S       
RAPIDLY FLASHING BEACON         

01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:30.089
THE OUR CROSSWALKS THAT&amp;apos;S       
RAPIDLY FLASHING BEACON         
BASICALLY CROSSWALKS IS         

01:33:30.091 --> 01:33:30.456
RAPIDLY FLASHING BEACON         
BASICALLY CROSSWALKS IS         
IMPORTANT.                      

01:33:30.458 --> 01:33:31.191
BASICALLY CROSSWALKS IS         
IMPORTANT.                      
CONNECTIVITY AND POROSITY TO    

01:33:31.193 --> 01:33:34.194
IMPORTANT.                      
CONNECTIVITY AND POROSITY TO    
BIKE LANES IS ALSO CRITICAL.    

01:33:34.196 --> 01:33:35.328
CONNECTIVITY AND POROSITY TO    
BIKE LANES IS ALSO CRITICAL.    
I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER       

01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:35.995
BIKE LANES IS ALSO CRITICAL.    
I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER       
COMMISSIONERS SPOKE ABOUT THAT. 

01:33:35.997 --> 01:33:36.662
I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER       
COMMISSIONERS SPOKE ABOUT THAT. 
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S        

01:33:36.664 --> 01:33:38.631
COMMISSIONERS SPOKE ABOUT THAT. 
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S        
ACTUALLY A REALLY USEFUL THING  

01:33:38.633 --> 01:33:39.165
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S        
ACTUALLY A REALLY USEFUL THING  
TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE.           

01:33:39.167 --> 01:33:42.402
ACTUALLY A REALLY USEFUL THING  
TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE.           
FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLKS THAT IF  

01:33:42.404 --> 01:33:43.136
TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE.           
FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLKS THAT IF  
THIS PASSES AND THIS GOES TO    

01:33:43.138 --> 01:33:43.903

THIS PASSES AND THIS GOES TO    
CITY COUNCIL, THIS ISN&amp;apos;T THE    

01:33:43.905 --> 01:33:46.839
THIS PASSES AND THIS GOES TO
