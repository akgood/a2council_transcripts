ARE INCIDENTS WHERE YOU HAVE A  
BIG GATHERING AND LOTS OF OUR

BIG GATHERING AND LOTS OF OUR

00:19:30.177 --> 00:19:32.778
OFFICERS ARE OUT AND WE FEEL    
LIKE AND FOOTBALL GAMES OR SOME 
OTHER EVENTS AND I KNOW THERE   

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.315
LIKE AND FOOTBALL GAMES OR SOME 
OTHER EVENTS AND I KNOW THERE   
WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE THERE WAS 

00:19:36.317 --> 00:19:37.182
OTHER EVENTS AND I KNOW THERE   
WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE THERE WAS 
AN ENCOUNTER BUT THERE WAS NO   

00:19:37.184 --> 00:19:41.453
WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE THERE WAS 
AN ENCOUNTER BUT THERE WAS NO   
BODY WORN CAMERA TO EVALUATE    

00:19:41.455 --> 00:19:44.489
AN ENCOUNTER BUT THERE WAS NO   
BODY WORN CAMERA TO EVALUATE    
BECAUSE THE OFFICER DID NOT     

00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:45.491
BODY WORN CAMERA TO EVALUATE    
BECAUSE THE OFFICER DID NOT     
HAVE THAT THEY ARE COMING OUT   

00:19:45.493 --> 00:19:48.794
BECAUSE THE OFFICER DID NOT     
HAVE THAT THEY ARE COMING OUT   
OF THE STADIUM AND THEY DID NOT 

00:19:48.796 --> 00:19:52.064
HAVE THAT THEY ARE COMING OUT   
OF THE STADIUM AND THEY DID NOT 
HAVE THAT ON YET.               

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:55.934
OF THE STADIUM AND THEY DID NOT 
HAVE THAT ON YET.               
THEY WERE ENGAGED IN INCIDENT   

00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:57.002
HAVE THAT ON YET.               
THEY WERE ENGAGED IN INCIDENT   
AND I THINK HAVING A BODY WORN  

00:19:57.004 --> 00:20:02.974
THEY WERE ENGAGED IN INCIDENT   
AND I THINK HAVING A BODY WORN  
CAMERA WOULD BE A A BETTER WAY  

00:20:02.976 --> 00:20:03.809
AND I THINK HAVING A BODY WORN  
CAMERA WOULD BE A A BETTER WAY  
OF LOOKING AT THE INCIDENT IN   

00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:07.112
CAMERA WOULD BE A A BETTER WAY  
OF LOOKING AT THE INCIDENT IN   
CASE THERE IS A COMPLAINT ABOUT 

00:20:07.114 --> 00:20:07.446
OF LOOKING AT THE INCIDENT IN   
CASE THERE IS A COMPLAINT ABOUT 
THAT.                           

00:20:07.448 --> 00:20:10.282
CASE THERE IS A COMPLAINT ABOUT 
THAT.                           
AND FOR US IT WOULD BE MORE     

00:20:10.284 --> 00:20:14.419
THAT.                           
AND FOR US IT WOULD BE MORE     
OF UNBIASED WHEN WE REVIEW      

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:18.423
AND FOR US IT WOULD BE MORE     
OF UNBIASED WHEN WE REVIEW      
THOSE INCIDENTS AND HAVING A    

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:19.357
OF UNBIASED WHEN WE REVIEW      
THOSE INCIDENTS AND HAVING A    
BODY WORN CAMERA WOULD BE       

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:22.928
THOSE INCIDENTS AND HAVING A    
BODY WORN CAMERA WOULD BE       
REALLY SOMETHING A SOURCE TO    

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.398
BODY WORN CAMERA WOULD BE       
REALLY SOMETHING A SOURCE TO    
MAKE SURE THAT EITHER           

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.132
REALLY SOMETHING A SOURCE TO

ALLEGATIONS ARE SUSTAINED OR    
NOT.                            
BUT I THINK IF WE DON'T HAVE    

00:20:31.372 --> 00:20:34.372
NOT.                            
BUT I THINK IF WE DON'T HAVE    
ENOUGH WE SHOULD HAVE AND

01:05:12.383 --> 01:05:13.183
THE TRAINING WE COULD WE CAN    
ACTUALLY GO OVER THE TRAINING   
BUT I THINK I THINK WE SHOULD   

01:05:13.185 --> 01:05:14.984
ACTUALLY GO OVER THE TRAINING   
BUT I THINK I THINK WE SHOULD   
DO MORE THAN THAT.              

01:05:14.986 --> 01:05:16.185
BUT I THINK I THINK WE SHOULD   
DO MORE THAN THAT.              
I THINK THAT THAT TEAM OF YOU   

01:05:16.187 --> 01:05:19.422
DO MORE THAN THAT.              
I THINK THAT THAT TEAM OF YOU

I THINK THAT THAT TEAM OF YOU   
SHOULD COME IN AND TALK TO OUR  
POLICE OFFICERS AND JUST ENGAGE 

01:05:20.158 --> 01:05:22.625
SHOULD COME IN AND TALK TO OUR  
POLICE OFFICERS AND JUST ENGAGE 
IN JUST A REGULAR CONVERSATION  

01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:23.626
POLICE OFFICERS AND JUST ENGAGE

ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE   
COMMUNITY.                      

01:05:24.095 --> 01:05:26.629
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE   
COMMUNITY.                      
I THINK THAT THE POLICE         

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:27.497
COMMUNITY.                      
I THINK THAT THE POLICE         
OFFICERS SHOULD HEAR FROM YOU.  

01:05:27.499 --> 01:05:28.565
I THINK THAT THE POLICE         
OFFICERS SHOULD HEAR FROM YOU.  
I THINK BY SITTING DOWN AND     

01:05:28.567 --> 01:05:31.467
OFFICERS SHOULD HEAR FROM YOU.  
I THINK BY SITTING DOWN AND     
HAVING A ROUNDTABLE AND I DON'T

BECAUSE THE POLICE OFFICERS     

01:05:38.276 --> 01:05:39.375
I CALL IT JUST BEING REAL       
BECAUSE THE POLICE OFFICERS     
NEED TO JUST BE ABLE TO HAVE A  

01:05:39.377 --> 01:05:42.445
BECAUSE THE POLICE OFFICERS     
NEED TO JUST BE ABLE TO HAVE A

TEMPERAMENT EVEN THOUGH IT      
BOTHERS YOU, YOU WERE LIKELY TO

TEMPERAMENT EVEN THOUGH IT      
BOTHERS YOU, YOU WERE LIKELY TO 
DO A COUPLE OF THINGS.          

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.459
BOTHERS YOU, YOU WERE LIKELY TO 
DO A COUPLE OF THINGS.          
ONE THING IS TO HAVE THE

THE OTHER THING IS TO BE ABLE

THE ISSUES WE HAVE ARE          
IMPORTANT.                      
SO HERE'S MY CHALLENGE BECAUSE  

01:11:20.685 --> 01:11:25.154
IMPORTANT.                      
SO HERE'S MY CHALLENGE BECAUSE

YOU HAVE TRAINING, YOU HAVE     
TRAINING.                       
MY CHALLENGES IS THAT YOU       

01:11:29.293 --> 01:11:30.058
TRAINING.                       
MY CHALLENGES IS THAT YOU       
IDENTIFY SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE 

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.461
MY CHALLENGES IS THAT YOU       
IDENTIFY SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE 
ON YOUR TEAM AND YOU DECIDE     

01:11:32.463 --> 01:11:36.566
IDENTIFY SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE 
ON YOUR TEAM AND YOU DECIDE     
WHEN YOU WANT TO COME AND SIT   

01:11:36.568 --> 01:11:40.836
ON YOUR TEAM AND YOU DECIDE     
WHEN YOU WANT TO COME AND SIT   
DOWN AND WE HAVE A ROUNDTABLE   

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:41.471
WHEN YOU WANT TO COME AND SIT   
DOWN AND WE HAVE A ROUNDTABLE   
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE THINGS   

01:11:41.473 --> 01:11:44.940
DOWN AND WE HAVE A ROUNDTABLE   
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE THINGS   
THAT YOU FEEL ARE IMPACTING OUR 

01:11:44.942 --> 01:11:45.875
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE THINGS   
THAT YOU FEEL ARE IMPACTING OUR

COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE A         
CONVERSATION.                   
BUT AS PART OF THAT             

01:11:48.947 --> 01:11:51.880
CONVERSATION.                   
BUT AS PART OF THAT             
CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO ALLOW   

01:11:51.882 --> 01:11:52.915
BUT AS PART OF THAT             
CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO ALLOW   
FOR PEOPLE TO BE OPEN BECAUSE   

01:11:52.917 --> 01:11:56.318
CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO ALLOW   
FOR PEOPLE TO BE OPEN BECAUSE   
SOMETIMES POLICE OFFICERS MAY   

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.856
FOR PEOPLE TO BE OPEN BECAUSE   
SOMETIMES POLICE OFFICERS MAY   
SAY THINGS THAT COULD OFFEND    

01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:03.158
SOMETIMES POLICE OFFICERS MAY   
SAY THINGS THAT COULD OFFEND    
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND 

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.159
SAY THINGS THAT COULD OFFEND    
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND 
OR THEY MAY HAVE THE UPBRINGING 

01:12:04.161 --> 01:12:07.697
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND 
OR THEY MAY HAVE THE UPBRINGING 
WE HAVE AND IT'S SOMETIMES      

01:12:07.699 --> 01:12:08.897
OR THEY MAY HAVE THE UPBRINGING 
WE HAVE AND IT'S SOMETIMES      
THERE IN A BAR OR SITUATION.    

01:12:08.899 --> 01:12:12.367
WE HAVE AND IT'S SOMETIMES      
THERE IN A BAR OR SITUATION.    
BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES US 

01:12:12.369 --> 01:12:13.002
THERE IN A BAR OR SITUATION.    
BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES US 
THE HANDLES AND OPPORTUNITIES   

01:12:13.004 --> 01:12:15.337
BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES US 
THE HANDLES AND OPPORTUNITIES   
TO IDENTIFY POLICE OFFICERS.    

01:12:15.339 --> 01:12:16.539
THE HANDLES AND OPPORTUNITIES   
TO IDENTIFY POLICE OFFICERS.    
THEY HAVE CONCERNS AND THEN WE  

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.675
TO IDENTIFY POLICE OFFICERS.    
THEY HAVE CONCERNS AND THEN WE  
CAN WORK ON THEIR CONCERNS IN   

01:12:19.677 --> 01:12:20.342
THEY HAVE CONCERNS AND THEN WE  
CAN WORK ON THEIR CONCERNS IN   
ORDER TO ADDRESS THEM.          

01:12:20.344 --> 01:12:23.645
CAN WORK ON THEIR CONCERNS IN   
ORDER TO ADDRESS THEM.          
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE OPEN.  

01:12:23.647 --> 01:12:27.650
ORDER TO ADDRESS THEM.          
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE OPEN.  
SO THAT IS PART OF THE REASON   

01:12:27.652 --> 01:12:28.450
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE OPEN.  
SO THAT IS PART OF THE REASON   
WHY WE TALKED ABOUT BRINGING    

01:12:28.452 --> 01:12:30.185
SO THAT IS PART OF THE REASON   
WHY WE TALKED ABOUT BRINGING    
POLICE OFFICERS INTO SOME       

01:12:30.187 --> 01:12:30.586
WHY WE TALKED ABOUT BRINGING    
POLICE OFFICERS INTO SOME       
OF OUR TRAINING.                

01:12:30.588 --> 01:12:31.653
POLICE OFFICERS INTO SOME       
OF OUR TRAINING.                
I TALKED TO THE POLICE OFFICERS 

01:12:31.655 --> 01:12:35.757
OF OUR TRAINING.                
I TALKED TO THE POLICE OFFICERS 
ABOUT RACE A LOT AND IT REALLY  

01:12:35.759 --> 01:12:39.094
I TALKED TO THE POLICE OFFICERS 
ABOUT RACE A LOT AND IT REALLY  
TAKES TIME TO GET THEM          

01:12:39.096 --> 01:12:39.928
ABOUT RACE A LOT AND IT REALLY  
TAKES TIME TO GET THEM          
COMFORTABLE TO TALK ABOUT RACE. 

01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:42.664
TAKES TIME TO GET THEM          
COMFORTABLE TO TALK ABOUT RACE. 
BUT IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING 

01:12:42.666 --> 01:12:43.466
COMFORTABLE TO TALK ABOUT RACE. 
BUT IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING 
TO TALK ABOUT IT AND IN THE     

01:12:43.468 --> 01:12:44.200
BUT IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING 
TO TALK ABOUT IT AND IN THE     
COMMUNITY AND MAINLY THE        

01:12:44.202 --> 01:12:47.737
TO TALK ABOUT IT AND IN THE     
COMMUNITY AND MAINLY THE        
COMMISSION IS GOING TO GO OUT   

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:48.604
COMMUNITY AND MAINLY THE        
COMMISSION IS GOING TO GO OUT   
AND COMMUNICATE WHAT THEY SAID  

01:12:48.606 --> 01:12:50.706

AND COMMUNICATE WHAT THEY SAID  
TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THEY      

01:12:50.708 --> 01:12:54.377

TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THEY      
WON'T DO IT BECAUSE IT'LL HAVE  

01:12:54.379 --> 01:12:55.244
TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THEY      
WON'T DO IT BECAUSE IT'LL HAVE  
AN IMPACT ON THEIR CAREER,      

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:58.647
WON'T DO IT BECAUSE IT'LL HAVE  
AN IMPACT ON THEIR CAREER,      
THEIR LIVELIHOOD IN CARVE OUT A 

01:12:58.649 --> 01:12:59.314
AN IMPACT ON THEIR CAREER,      
THEIR LIVELIHOOD IN CARVE OUT A 
RESPONSE THAT IS EXTREMELY      

01:12:59.316 --> 01:13:02.284
THEIR LIVELIHOOD IN CARVE OUT A 
RESPONSE THAT IS EXTREMELY      
NEGATIVE TO THEM.               

01:13:02.286 --> 01:13:03.418
RESPONSE THAT IS EXTREMELY      
NEGATIVE TO THEM.               
SO WE HAVE TO REALLY DO THINGS  

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.555
NEGATIVE TO THEM.               
SO WE HAVE TO REALLY DO THINGS
