BUT BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T ISN'T

ORIGINAL DESIGN WAS MEANT FOR   
IT TO BE, WE WOULD HAVE WE      
WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED DOING THAT 

00:24:44.802 --> 00:24:52.276
AND THAT'S BASICALLY IT JUST    
WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE  
THINK THAT WE DON'T THINK THIS

WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE  
THINK THAT WE DON'T THINK THIS  
IS GOING TO CHANGE THE          

00:24:52.944 --> 00:24:53.677
THINK THAT WE DON'T THINK THIS  
IS GOING TO CHANGE THE          
APPEARANCE FROM THE STREET MUCH 

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:56.313
IS GOING TO CHANGE THE          
APPEARANCE FROM THE STREET MUCH 
AT ALL BECAUSE IT'S PARTIALLY   

00:24:56.315 --> 00:25:00.049
APPEARANCE FROM THE STREET MUCH 
AT ALL BECAUSE IT'S PARTIALLY   
SHIELDED BY LANDSCAPING AND     

00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:03.854
AT ALL BECAUSE IT'S PARTIALLY   
SHIELDED BY LANDSCAPING AND     
RETAINING WALLS THAT THE GARAGE 

00:25:03.856 --> 00:25:04.788
SHIELDED BY LANDSCAPING AND     
RETAINING WALLS THAT THE GARAGE 
IS KIND OF A RETAINING WALL FOR 

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:05.255
RETAINING WALLS THAT THE GARAGE 
IS KIND OF A RETAINING WALL FOR 
THE LANDSCAPING.                

00:25:05.257 --> 00:25:09.693
IS KIND OF A RETAINING WALL FOR 
THE LANDSCAPING.                
SO WE THINK IT WILL APPEAR TO   

00:25:09.695 --> 00:25:13.964
THE LANDSCAPING.                
SO WE THINK IT WILL APPEAR TO
