THE PARKING IS WE CAN PUSH THE  
PARKING BELOW GRADE BECAUSE WE  

00:19:09.026 --> 00:19:09.758
THE PARKING IS WE CAN PUSH THE  
PARKING BELOW GRADE BECAUSE WE  
HAD THE STORMWATER DETENTION    

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.427
PARKING BELOW GRADE BECAUSE WE  
HAD THE STORMWATER DETENTION    
BELOW THE PARKING AND IF WE     

00:19:12.429 --> 00:19:13.228
HAD THE STORMWATER DETENTION    
BELOW THE PARKING AND IF WE     
PUSH THAT DOWN INTO THE WATER   

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.364
BELOW THE PARKING AND IF WE     
PUSH THAT DOWN INTO THE WATER   
TABLE IT WOULD BE BRINGING      

00:19:16.366 --> 00:19:17.332

TABLE IT WOULD BE BRINGING      
WATER UP OUT OF THE WATER TABLE 
AND PUTTING INTO THE CITY&apos;S     

00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:20.602
WATER UP OUT OF THE WATER TABLE 
AND PUTTING INTO THE CITY&apos;S     
STORMWATER SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT  

00:19:20.604 --> 00:19:21.203
AND PUTTING INTO THE CITY&apos;S

A BEST PRACTICE.                

00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:24.472
STORMWATER SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT

SO THIS IS THE SPACE WHERE IT   

00:19:24.474 --> 00:19:25.073
A BEST PRACTICE.                
SO THIS IS THE SPACE WHERE IT   
COULD BE IS UNDERNEATH

DON&apos;T NEED THAT 19 FEET MAYBE   
MAYBE WHATEVER SPACE IS THERE   

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.012
DON&apos;T NEED THAT 19 FEET MAYBE   
MAYBE WHATEVER SPACE IS THERE

SO PORTIONS OF IT ARE CONCRETE  
TILES AND PORTIONS OF OUR WOOD  

00:48:46.834 --> 00:48:47.567
SO PORTIONS OF IT ARE CONCRETE  
TILES AND PORTIONS OF OUR WOOD  
AND THEN PORTIONS ARE ACTUALLY  

00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:49.502
TILES AND PORTIONS OF OUR WOOD  
AND THEN PORTIONS ARE ACTUALLY  
ARTIFICIAL TURF WHERE YOU CAN   

00:48:49.504 --> 00:48:50.436
AND THEN PORTIONS ARE ACTUALLY  
ARTIFICIAL TURF WHERE YOU CAN   
PUT SOME FLEXIBLE FURNITURE OUT 

00:48:50.438 --> 00:48:51.203
ARTIFICIAL TURF WHERE YOU CAN   
PUT SOME FLEXIBLE FURNITURE OUT 
SO IT DOESN&apos;T NEED ANY          

00:48:51.205 --> 00:48:54.840
PUT SOME FLEXIBLE FURNITURE OUT 
SO IT DOESN&apos;T NEED ANY          
ADDITIONAL IRRIGATION WHICH     

00:48:54.842 --> 00:48:57.844
SO IT DOESN&apos;T NEED ANY

WOULDN&apos;T BE APPROPRIATE.        

00:48:57.846 --> 00:48:58.744
ADDITIONAL IRRIGATION WHICH     
WOULDN&apos;T BE APPROPRIATE.        
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THESE     

00:48:58.746 --> 00:48:59.412
WOULDN&apos;T BE APPROPRIATE.        
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THESE     
THESE LARGE AREAS THAT ARE      

00:48:59.414 --> 00:49:01.847
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THESE     
THESE LARGE AREAS THAT ARE      
ALONG THE SIDE THAT ARE PLANTED 

00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:02.748
THESE LARGE AREAS THAT ARE      
ALONG THE SIDE THAT ARE PLANTED 
HERE TO BUFFER BOTH THE         

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.152
ALONG THE SIDE THAT ARE PLANTED 
HERE TO BUFFER BOTH THE         
SIDENTIAL SPACES AND EACH       

00:49:06.154 --> 00:49:06.952
HERE TO BUFFER BOTH THE         
SIDENTIAL SPACES AND EACH       
RESIDENTIAL SPACE ON THE SECOND 

00:49:06.954 --> 00:49:10.222
SIDENTIAL SPACES AND EACH       
RESIDENTIAL SPACE ON THE SECOND 
FLOOR HAS A LITTLE OUTDOOR

FLOOR HAS A LITTLE OUTDOOR      
TERRACE.                        
SO THAT BUFFER IS THAT SPACE.   

00:49:12.827 --> 00:49:13.826
TERRACE.                        
SO THAT BUFFER IS THAT SPACE.   
SO WHEN YOU&apos;RE IN THE MIDDLE    

00:49:13.828 --> 00:49:14.527
SO THAT BUFFER IS THAT SPACE.   
SO WHEN YOU&apos;RE IN THE MIDDLE    
HERE YOU&apos;RE SEPARATED FROM      

00:49:14.529 --> 00:49:17.130
SO WHEN YOU&apos;RE IN THE MIDDLE    
HERE YOU&apos;RE SEPARATED FROM      
PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING THERE.   

00:49:17.132 --> 00:49:18.064
HERE YOU&apos;RE SEPARATED FROM      
PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING THERE.   
SO THERE&apos;S A LITTLE BIT         

00:49:18.066 --> 00:49:18.565
PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING THERE.   
SO THERE&apos;S A LITTLE BIT         
OF PRIVACY THERE.               

00:49:18.567 --> 00:49:21.067
SO THERE&apos;S A LITTLE BIT         
OF PRIVACY THERE.               
SAME THING ALONG THE NORTH SIDE 

00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.734
OF PRIVACY THERE.               
SAME THING ALONG THE NORTH SIDE 
HERE AS WELL THAT&apos;S ALSO        

00:49:21.736 --> 00:49:24.170
SAME THING ALONG THE NORTH SIDE 
HERE AS WELL THAT&apos;S ALSO        
PLANTED THE SAME WAY IT&apos;S       

00:49:24.172 --> 00:49:24.871
HERE AS WELL THAT&apos;S ALSO        
PLANTED THE SAME WAY IT&apos;S       
SCREENING SOME MECHANICAL

SCREENING SOME MECHANICAL       
EQUIPMENT.                      
SO IT&apos;S A LARGER PLANTED AREA   

00:49:28.276 --> 00:49:31.744
EQUIPMENT.                      
SO IT&apos;S A LARGER PLANTED AREA   
AND THEN THIS IS A WOOD DECK    

00:49:31.746 --> 00:49:32.178
SO IT&apos;S A LARGER PLANTED AREA   
AND THEN THIS IS A WOOD DECK    
ALONG HERE.                     

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.512
AND THEN THIS IS A WOOD DECK    
ALONG HERE.                     
SO A LOT OF OPEN SPACE TO HAVE

THE REZONING IS PROBABLY THE    

00:49:56.237 --> 00:49:59.039
&gt;&gt; UM, JUST TO RECAP, I THINK   
THE REZONING IS PROBABLY THE    
ELEMENT THAT WE ARE KIND        

00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:02.641
THE REZONING IS PROBABLY THE    
ELEMENT THAT WE ARE KIND        
OF HONING IN ON AND THE JUST    

00:50:02.643 --> 00:50:03.410
ELEMENT THAT WE ARE KIND        
OF HONING IN ON AND THE JUST    
ALWAYS RECAPPING KIND OF WHAT   

00:50:03.412 --> 00:50:06.645
OF HONING IN ON AND THE JUST    
ALWAYS RECAPPING KIND OF WHAT   
THE CRITERIA BY WHICH WE RESIDE 

00:50:06.647 --> 00:50:07.747
ALWAYS RECAPPING KIND OF WHAT   
THE CRITERIA BY WHICH WE RESIDE 
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE TO ESTABLISH   

00:50:07.749 --> 00:50:08.214
THE CRITERIA BY WHICH WE RESIDE 
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE TO ESTABLISH   
MAINTAIN SOUND STABLE,          

00:50:08.216 --> 00:50:11.150
IT&apos;S GOING TO BE TO ESTABLISH   
MAINTAIN SOUND STABLE,          
DESIRABLE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN    

00:50:11.152 --> 00:50:11.951
MAINTAIN SOUND STABLE,          
DESIRABLE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN    
THE TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF THE   

00:50:11.953 --> 00:50:15.521
DESIRABLE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN    
THE TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF THE   
CITY AND IT WON&apos;T BE CHANGED    

00:50:15.523 --> 00:50:16.255
THE TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF THE   
CITY AND IT WON&apos;T BE CHANGED    
UNLESS IT&apos;S AN AREA CHANGES THE 

00:50:16.257 --> 00:50:19.125
CITY AND IT WON&apos;T BE CHANGED    
UNLESS IT&apos;S AN AREA CHANGES THE 
MUNICIPAL POLICY OR CHANGING    

00:50:19.127 --> 00:50:19.859
UNLESS IT&apos;S AN AREA CHANGES THE 
MUNICIPAL POLICY OR CHANGING    
CONDITIONS IN THE PARTICULAR    

00:50:19.861 --> 00:50:20.460
MUNICIPAL POLICY OR CHANGING    
CONDITIONS IN THE PARTICULAR    
AREA OR IN THE MUNICIPALITY     

00:50:20.462 --> 00:50:22.928
CONDITIONS IN THE PARTICULAR    
AREA OR IN THE MUNICIPALITY     
GENERALLY.                      

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:23.963
AREA OR IN THE MUNICIPALITY     
GENERALLY.                      
&gt;&gt; SO TO ME I THINK THIS HITS   

00:50:23.965 --> 00:50:25.931
GENERALLY.                      
&gt;&gt; SO TO ME I THINK THIS HITS   
ALL THREE SO SOUND STABLE       

00:50:25.933 --> 00:50:26.499
&gt;&gt; SO TO ME I THINK THIS HITS   
ALL THREE SO SOUND STABLE       
DESIRABLE DEVELOPMENT.          

00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:27.233
ALL THREE SO SOUND STABLE       
DESIRABLE DEVELOPMENT.          
&gt;&gt; I DO BELIEVE THAT IT         

00:50:27.235 --> 00:50:30.103
DESIRABLE DEVELOPMENT.          
&gt;&gt; I DO BELIEVE THAT IT         
SATISFIES THOSE THREE AS WELL   

00:50:30.105 --> 00:50:30.904
&gt;&gt; I DO BELIEVE THAT IT         
SATISFIES THOSE THREE AS WELL   
AS THE CHANGING CONDITIONS IN   

00:50:30.906 --> 00:50:31.370
SATISFIES THOSE THREE AS WELL   
AS THE CHANGING CONDITIONS IN   
THE MUNICIPALITY.               

00:50:31.372 --> 00:50:33.873
AS THE CHANGING CONDITIONS IN   
THE MUNICIPALITY.               
SO I THINK THERE&apos;S HEIGHTENED   

00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:34.573
THE MUNICIPALITY.               
SO I THINK THERE&apos;S HEIGHTENED   
NEED FOR HOUSING.               

00:50:34.575 --> 00:50:35.508
SO I THINK THERE&apos;S HEIGHTENED   
NEED FOR HOUSING.               
&gt;&gt; I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT     

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.278
NEED FOR HOUSING.               
&gt;&gt; I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT     
THEY ADDRESSED THE THIRTY       

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:38.945
&gt;&gt; I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT     
THEY ADDRESSED THE THIRTY       
PERCENT SHORT TERM RENTALS      

00:50:38.947 --> 00:50:42.047
THEY ADDRESSED THE THIRTY       
PERCENT SHORT TERM RENTALS      
RUNNING QUICK MAP STILL ONE     

00:50:42.049 --> 00:50:42.916
PERCENT SHORT TERM RENTALS      
RUNNING QUICK MAP STILL ONE     
HUNDRED FIFTY ONE UNITS IS      

00:50:42.918 --> 00:50:46.252
RUNNING QUICK MAP STILL ONE     
HUNDRED FIFTY ONE UNITS IS      
PRETTY MUCH IF YOU MAX RCR THAT 

00:50:46.254 --> 00:50:46.986
HUNDRED FIFTY ONE UNITS IS

&gt;&gt; AND SO I UNDERSTAND THAT     
STAFF WOULD ALSO REALIZE THIS
