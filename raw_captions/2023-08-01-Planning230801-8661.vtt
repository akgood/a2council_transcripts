REQUIREMENT OF THE ISSUANCE     

00:21:38.735 --> 00:21:39.468
AND SO THAT IS THAT&apos;S A

00:21:47.845 --> 00:21:50.211
85 AND THEY WANTED TO EXCEED    
THAT IN THE FUTURE, THEN YES,   
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO AMEND

CONSIDER REVISING THAT LANGUAGE 

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.594
CERTAINLY THE CITY COULD        
CONSIDER REVISING THAT LANGUAGE 
SO IT&apos;S NOT REQUIRED THAT WOULD 

00:22:05.596 --> 00:22:06.328

NOT AUTOMATICALLY LIKELY
