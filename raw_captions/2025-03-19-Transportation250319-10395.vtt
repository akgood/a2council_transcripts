VEGETATION IN OUR PUBLIC        
WALKWAYS AS ALWAYS CORNERS TO   
PROVIDE SAFE DISTANCE HAS BEEN  

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:30.632
WALKWAYS AS ALWAYS CORNERS TO   
PROVIDE SAFE DISTANCE HAS BEEN  
IGNORED BY THE CITY FOR A FEW   

00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:33.334
PROVIDE SAFE DISTANCE HAS BEEN  
IGNORED BY THE CITY FOR A FEW   
YEARS AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT   

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:34.069
IGNORED BY THE CITY FOR A FEW   
YEARS AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT   
IT WAS GOING TO BE ROLLED INTO  

00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:37.506
YEARS AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT   
IT WAS GOING TO BE ROLLED INTO  
THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.         

00:07:37.508 --> 00:07:38.440
IT WAS GOING TO BE ROLLED INTO  
THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.         
HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE WORKING ON

SO I THINK THE TRANSPORTATION   

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:43.311
KNOWLEDGE OF THAT.              
SO I THINK THE TRANSPORTATION   
COMMISSION MAY BE THE           

00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:46.213

APPROPRIATE PLACE TO LOOK AT    
THAT.

WAS DESIRED BECAUSE THIS IS     
KIND OF LIKE SOMEWHAT OF AN     
ABSTRACT STUDY SOMEWHAT TO THE  

00:33:58.286 --> 00:33:59.118
KIND OF LIKE SOMEWHAT OF AN     
ABSTRACT STUDY SOMEWHAT TO THE  
HEART OF OUR GOALS AND VALUES   

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:05.024
ABSTRACT STUDY SOMEWHAT TO THE  
HEART OF OUR GOALS AND VALUES   
HERE BUT STILL A BIT OF A IT    

00:34:05.026 --> 00:34:05.692
HEART OF OUR GOALS AND VALUES   
HERE BUT STILL A BIT OF A IT    
ISN'T QUITE THE WORD BUT THIS   

00:34:05.694 --> 00:34:09.863
HERE BUT STILL A BIT OF A IT    
ISN'T QUITE THE WORD BUT THIS   
ISN'T A TYPICAL STUDY OF THESE  

00:34:09.865 --> 00:34:10.463
ISN'T QUITE THE WORD BUT THIS   
ISN'T A TYPICAL STUDY OF THESE  
TYPES OF THINGS.                

00:34:10.465 --> 00:34:11.664
ISN'T A TYPICAL STUDY OF THESE  
TYPES OF THINGS.                
AND SO I WANT TO I WANTED TO

COMMISSION HAS THEM ASHARA      
QUESTIONS FROM ANYONE COMMENTS  

00:34:46.867 --> 00:34:51.104
I'LL KICK IT OFF.               
I ASSUME THAT OF THE THE TEN    
CORRIDORS THAT ARE GOING TO BE  

00:34:51.106 --> 00:34:56.776
I ASSUME THAT OF THE THE TEN    
CORRIDORS THAT ARE GOING TO BE  
INCLUDED IN THE IN THE STUDY    

00:34:56.778 --> 00:34:57.877
CORRIDORS THAT ARE GOING TO BE  
INCLUDED IN THE IN THE STUDY    
ARE THEY LOOKING AT SEGMENTS    

00:34:57.879 --> 00:35:01.281
INCLUDED IN THE IN THE STUDY    
ARE THEY LOOKING AT SEGMENTS    
OF EACH CORRIDOR OR ARE THEY    

00:35:01.283 --> 00:35:02.148
ARE THEY LOOKING AT SEGMENTS    
OF EACH CORRIDOR OR ARE THEY    
TREATING EACH CORRIDOR IN ITS   

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.552
OF EACH CORRIDOR OR ARE THEY    
TREATING EACH CORRIDOR IN ITS   
ENTIRETY AS A CANDIDATE         

00:35:05.554 --> 00:35:06.219
TREATING EACH CORRIDOR IN ITS   
ENTIRETY AS A CANDIDATE         
CANDIDATE FOR EXAMPLE?          

00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:09.488
ENTIRETY AS A CANDIDATE         
CANDIDATE FOR EXAMPLE?          
ARE THEY JUST WILL THEY HAVE    

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:12.959
CANDIDATE FOR EXAMPLE?          
ARE THEY JUST WILL THEY HAVE    
THE CAPACITY TO SAY MAYBE THE   

00:35:12.961 --> 00:35:13.793
ARE THEY JUST WILL THEY HAVE    
THE CAPACITY TO SAY MAYBE THE   
ENTIRE CORRIDOR WILL BE ABLE TO 

00:35:13.795 --> 00:35:17.130
THE CAPACITY TO SAY MAYBE THE   
ENTIRE CORRIDOR WILL BE ABLE TO 
HANDLE IT BUT THIS SEGMENT      

00:35:17.132 --> 00:35:21.033
ENTIRE CORRIDOR WILL BE ABLE TO 
HANDLE IT BUT THIS SEGMENT      
OF IT COULD?                    

00:35:21.035 --> 00:35:24.270
HANDLE IT BUT THIS SEGMENT      
OF IT COULD?                    
I GUESS MY RESPONSE IS THIS IS  

00:35:24.272 --> 00:35:24.838
OF IT COULD?                    
I GUESS MY RESPONSE IS THIS IS  
A BROAD YES.                    

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.838
I GUESS MY RESPONSE IS THIS IS  
A BROAD YES.                    
WE'VE BROKEN THEM OUT INTO TEN  

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.474
A BROAD YES.                    
WE'VE BROKEN THEM OUT INTO TEN  
CORRIDORS BECAUSE THAT'S EASY   

00:35:28.476 --> 00:35:29.142
WE'VE BROKEN THEM OUT INTO TEN  
CORRIDORS BECAUSE THAT'S EASY   
GEOGRAPHICALLY AND TO END WHAT  

00:35:29.144 --> 00:35:32.479
CORRIDORS BECAUSE THAT'S EASY   
GEOGRAPHICALLY AND TO END WHAT  
TO DO ALONG THESE CORRIDORS     

00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.213
GEOGRAPHICALLY AND TO END WHAT  
TO DO ALONG THESE CORRIDORS     
THERE IS SOME DIVERSITY         

00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:35.948
TO DO ALONG THESE CORRIDORS     
THERE IS SOME DIVERSITY         
OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND SO THERE    

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:36.750
THERE IS SOME DIVERSITY         
OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND SO THERE    
COULD BE AREAS IN WHICH THERE   

00:35:36.752 --> 00:35:39.652
OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND SO THERE    
COULD BE AREAS IN WHICH THERE   
ARE SOME EASY THINGS TO DO AND  

00:35:39.654 --> 00:35:40.320
COULD BE AREAS IN WHICH THERE   
ARE SOME EASY THINGS TO DO AND  
SOME AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SOME 

00:35:40.322 --> 00:35:40.920
ARE SOME EASY THINGS TO DO AND  
SOME AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SOME 
OTHER THINGS TO DO.             

00:35:40.922 --> 00:35:43.389
SOME AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SOME 
OTHER THINGS TO DO.             
I SUSPECT THAT THAT THE         

00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:47.193
OTHER THINGS TO DO.             
I SUSPECT THAT THAT THE         
CONCEPTS WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO  

00:35:47.195 --> 00:35:48.160
I SUSPECT THAT THAT THE         
CONCEPTS WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO  
THAT AND BECAUSE REALLY WE'RE   

00:35:48.162 --> 00:35:51.397
CONCEPTS WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO  
THAT AND BECAUSE REALLY WE'RE   
TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO       

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:52.164
THAT AND BECAUSE REALLY WE'RE   
TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO       
IDENTIFY THE HARD AREAS TO BE   

00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:54.901
TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO       
IDENTIFY THE HARD AREAS TO BE   
ABLE TO PUT MORE ATTENTION TO   

00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:55.902
IDENTIFY THE HARD AREAS TO BE   
ABLE TO PUT MORE ATTENTION TO   
AND LEAVE THE EASY AREAS OUT.   

00:35:55.904 --> 00:35:57.170
ABLE TO PUT MORE ATTENTION TO   
AND LEAVE THE EASY AREAS OUT.   
SO IF THERE IS A SECTION OF A   

00:35:57.172 --> 00:35:59.872
AND LEAVE THE EASY AREAS OUT.   
SO IF THERE IS A SECTION OF A   
LONGER CORRIDOR IN THERE THAT   

00:35:59.874 --> 00:36:03.743
SO IF THERE IS A SECTION OF A   
LONGER CORRIDOR IN THERE THAT   
IS IS ESPECIALLY EASY IN WHAT   

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:04.744
LONGER CORRIDOR IN THERE THAT   
IS IS ESPECIALLY EASY IN WHAT   
IS ESPECIALLY HARD, I CAN I CAN 

00:36:04.746 --> 00:36:06.546
IS IS ESPECIALLY EASY IN WHAT   
IS ESPECIALLY HARD, I CAN I CAN 
SEE US MAKING THAT DECISION.    

00:36:06.548 --> 00:36:10.783
IS ESPECIALLY HARD, I CAN I CAN 
SEE US MAKING THAT DECISION.    
BUT IN GENERAL IT IS TRYING TO  

00:36:10.785 --> 00:36:15.454
SEE US MAKING THAT DECISION.    
BUT IN GENERAL IT IS TRYING TO  
GET US TO THE POINT WHERE WE    

00:36:15.456 --> 00:36:16.289
BUT IN GENERAL IT IS TRYING TO  
GET US TO THE POINT WHERE WE    
HAVE A GOOD SOLID IDEA ABOUT    

00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:16.990
GET US TO THE POINT WHERE WE    
HAVE A GOOD SOLID IDEA ABOUT    
WHAT MOST OF THE CORRIDOR       

00:36:16.992 --> 00:36:19.693
HAVE A GOOD SOLID IDEA ABOUT    
WHAT MOST OF THE CORRIDOR       
LAYOUT COULD BE AND IF THERE    

00:36:19.695 --> 00:36:20.493
WHAT MOST OF THE CORRIDOR       
LAYOUT COULD BE AND IF THERE    
ARE CHALLENGING POINTS TO DIG   

00:36:20.495 --> 00:36:22.762
LAYOUT COULD BE AND IF THERE    
ARE CHALLENGING POINTS TO DIG   
IN AND TRY TO RESOLVE SOME      

00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:23.562
ARE CHALLENGING POINTS TO DIG   
IN AND TRY TO RESOLVE SOME      
OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE      

00:36:23.564 --> 00:36:26.699
IN AND TRY TO RESOLVE SOME      
OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE      
ISSUES AND THE MORE COMPLICATED 

00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:30.503
OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE      
ISSUES AND THE MORE COMPLICATED 
POINTS AND PUT THE BULK OF OUR  

00:36:30.505 --> 00:36:31.304
ISSUES AND THE MORE COMPLICATED 
POINTS AND PUT THE BULK OF OUR  
ENERGY AND ATTENTION INTO AND   

00:36:31.306 --> 00:36:33.172
POINTS AND PUT THE BULK OF OUR  
ENERGY AND ATTENTION INTO AND   
TO TRYING TO THINK THROUGH SOME 

00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:35.141
ENERGY AND ATTENTION INTO AND   
TO TRYING TO THINK THROUGH SOME 
OF THE HARD PROBLEMS THERE.

TOWARDS THE EDGE OF LIMITS AND  

01:03:00.594 --> 01:03:01.593
CYCLE TRACK FROM DOWNTOWN       
TOWARDS THE EDGE OF LIMITS AND  
ON A PROJECT LIKE MILLER WHERE

TOWARDS THE EDGE OF LIMITS AND  
ON A PROJECT LIKE MILLER WHERE  
YOU HAVE A REALLY CONSTRAINED

YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF WIDTH   
IN THE RIGHT OF WAY.            
YOU HAVE EVEN LESS IN THE

IN THE RIGHT OF WAY.            
YOU HAVE EVEN LESS IN THE       
PHYSICAL STREET WHEN YOU'RE NOT 

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:17.475
YOU HAVE EVEN LESS IN THE       
PHYSICAL STREET WHEN YOU'RE NOT 
DOING WORKING ON A COMPLETE     

01:03:17.477 --> 01:03:20.678
PHYSICAL STREET WHEN YOU'RE NOT 
DOING WORKING ON A COMPLETE     
RECONSTRUCTION THEN YOU HAVE    

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.346
DOING WORKING ON A COMPLETE     
RECONSTRUCTION THEN YOU HAVE    
THAT'S PART OF THE CONSTRAINTS  

01:03:21.348 --> 01:03:22.146
RECONSTRUCTION THEN YOU HAVE    
THAT'S PART OF THE CONSTRAINTS  
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUT      

01:03:22.148 --> 01:03:24.582
THAT'S PART OF THE CONSTRAINTS  
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUT      
THAT'S WHY MILLER HAS A TWO WAY 

01:03:24.584 --> 01:03:27.852
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUT      
THAT'S WHY MILLER HAS A TWO WAY 
CYCLE TRACK DESIGN BECAUSE IT   

01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:31.456
THAT'S WHY MILLER HAS A TWO WAY 
CYCLE TRACK DESIGN BECAUSE IT   
IS IT IS A CORRIDOR THAT WE     

01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:32.657
CYCLE TRACK DESIGN BECAUSE IT   
IS IT IS A CORRIDOR THAT WE     
WANT TO HAVE THAT HIGHER LEVEL  

01:03:32.659 --> 01:03:34.892
IS IT IS A CORRIDOR THAT WE     
WANT TO HAVE THAT HIGHER LEVEL  
DESIGN.                         

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:35.760
WANT TO HAVE THAT HIGHER LEVEL  
DESIGN.                         
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:03:39.799 --> 01:03:40.631
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE     
THOUGHT THAT YOU GUYS PUT INTO  
THAT BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS THAT  

01:03:40.633 --> 01:03:43.001
THOUGHT THAT YOU GUYS PUT INTO  
THAT BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS THAT  
A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS WERE 

01:03:43.003 --> 01:03:43.868
THAT BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS THAT  
A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS WERE 
CONSIDERED AND THAT FROM AN

A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS WERE 
CONSIDERED AND THAT FROM AN     
ENGINEERING STANDPOINT I FEEL   

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:47.872

ENGINEERING STANDPOINT I FEEL   
LIKE WHAT THE PLAN ENDED UP     

01:03:47.874 --> 01:03:51.042
ENGINEERING STANDPOINT I FEEL   
LIKE WHAT THE PLAN ENDED UP     
BEING OVER THE COURSE OF MANY,  

01:03:51.044 --> 01:03:52.076
LIKE WHAT THE PLAN ENDED UP     
BEING OVER THE COURSE OF MANY,  
MANY MONTHS OF INPUT IS REALLY  

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:55.380
BEING OVER THE COURSE OF MANY,  
MANY MONTHS OF INPUT IS REALLY  
GOOD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.  

01:03:55.382 --> 01:03:58.482
MANY MONTHS OF INPUT IS REALLY  
GOOD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.  
ONE OF MY BIG COMPLAINTS FOR    

01:03:58.484 --> 01:03:59.417
GOOD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.  
ONE OF MY BIG COMPLAINTS FOR    
THE PROTECTED NETWORK THAT WE   

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:00.351
ONE OF MY BIG COMPLAINTS FOR    
THE PROTECTED NETWORK THAT WE   
HAVE SO FAR IS JUST THAT IT'S   

01:04:00.353 --> 01:04:03.355
THE PROTECTED NETWORK THAT WE   
HAVE SO FAR IS JUST THAT IT'S   
NOT IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND IT      

01:04:03.357 --> 01:04:06.424
HAVE SO FAR IS JUST THAT IT'S   
NOT IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND IT      
DOESN'T MUCH ON OUR MAJOR       

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:07.525
NOT IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND IT      
DOESN'T MUCH ON OUR MAJOR       
STREETS BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF ,  

01:04:07.527 --> 01:04:08.459
DOESN'T MUCH ON OUR MAJOR       
STREETS BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF ,  
YOU KNOW, BOUNDED BY THE DENHA  

01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:10.061
STREETS BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF ,  
YOU KNOW, BOUNDED BY THE DENHA  
AREA.                           

01:04:10.063 --> 01:04:11.228
YOU KNOW, BOUNDED BY THE DENHA  
AREA.                           
SO TO HAVE THIS START TO BECOME 

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:15.266
AREA.                           
SO TO HAVE THIS START TO BECOME 
A REALITY HOPEFULLY WITH THIS   

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.133
SO TO HAVE THIS START TO BECOME 
A REALITY HOPEFULLY WITH THIS   
AND THE PROJECT WE JUST HEARD   

01:04:16.135 --> 01:04:19.204
A REALITY HOPEFULLY WITH THIS   
AND THE PROJECT WE JUST HEARD   
ABOUT GATHERING DATA ON THE     

01:04:19.206 --> 01:04:20.004
AND THE PROJECT WE JUST HEARD   
ABOUT GATHERING DATA ON THE     
OTHER MAJOR CORRIDORS HOPEFULLY 

01:04:20.006 --> 01:04:22.407
ABOUT GATHERING DATA ON THE     
OTHER MAJOR CORRIDORS HOPEFULLY 
WE CAN SEE MORE OF A COMPLETE   

01:04:22.409 --> 01:04:23.341
OTHER MAJOR CORRIDORS HOPEFULLY 
WE CAN SEE MORE OF A COMPLETE   
NETWORK STARTING TO DEVELOP.    

01:04:23.343 --> 01:04:24.776
WE CAN SEE MORE OF A COMPLETE   
NETWORK STARTING TO DEVELOP.    
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR     

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:32.149
NETWORK STARTING TO DEVELOP.    
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR     
WORK ON IT, KATE I CYNTHIA,     

01:04:32.151 --> 01:04:33.284
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR     
WORK ON IT, KATE I CYNTHIA,     
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE       

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:36.654
WORK ON IT, KATE I CYNTHIA,     
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE       
PRESENTATION AND YOU KNOW ALL   

01:04:36.656 --> 01:04:37.421
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE       
PRESENTATION AND YOU KNOW ALL   
THE WORK AND THOUGHT THAT GOES  

01:04:37.423 --> 01:04:40.492
PRESENTATION AND YOU KNOW ALL   
THE WORK AND THOUGHT THAT GOES  
INTO THIS I AND THIS WILL       

01:04:40.494 --> 01:04:41.225
THE WORK AND THOUGHT THAT GOES  
INTO THIS I AND THIS WILL       
PROBABLY BE SOMETHING THAT I    

01:04:41.227 --> 01:04:44.362
INTO THIS I AND THIS WILL       
PROBABLY BE SOMETHING THAT I    
TALK ABOUT OFTEN IN THESE       

01:04:44.364 --> 01:04:45.063
PROBABLY BE SOMETHING THAT I    
TALK ABOUT OFTEN IN THESE       
MEETINGS BUT I DO STRUGGLE A    

01:04:45.065 --> 01:04:48.366
TALK ABOUT OFTEN IN THESE       
MEETINGS BUT I DO STRUGGLE A    
LOT WITH THE TREATMENTS WITH    

01:04:48.368 --> 01:04:52.203
MEETINGS BUT I DO STRUGGLE A    
LOT WITH THE TREATMENTS WITH    
REGARD TO TO MINOR STREETS IF   

01:04:52.205 --> 01:04:52.937
LOT WITH THE TREATMENTS WITH    
REGARD TO TO MINOR STREETS IF   
I'M REMEMBERING THE VERBIAGE    

01:04:52.939 --> 01:04:55.640
REGARD TO TO MINOR STREETS IF   
I'M REMEMBERING THE VERBIAGE    
CORRECTLY AND I RECOGNIZE WE    

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:56.441
I'M REMEMBERING THE VERBIAGE    
CORRECTLY AND I RECOGNIZE WE    
CAN'T HAVE AN ENTIRELY          

01:04:56.443 --> 01:04:59.110
CORRECTLY AND I RECOGNIZE WE    
CAN'T HAVE AN ENTIRELY          
SEPARATED BIKE NETWORK BUT AS   

01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:02.780
CAN'T HAVE AN ENTIRELY          
SEPARATED BIKE NETWORK BUT AS   
SOMEONE WHO SPENT 13 YEARS      

01:05:02.782 --> 01:05:03.815
SEPARATED BIKE NETWORK BUT AS   
SOMEONE WHO SPENT 13 YEARS      
BIKING WITH CHILDREN, YOU KNOW  

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:04.482
SOMEONE WHO SPENT 13 YEARS      
BIKING WITH CHILDREN, YOU KNOW  
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING   

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:07.485
BIKING WITH CHILDREN, YOU KNOW  
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING   
LIKE THE CONCEPT OF A SHIRO'S   

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:08.252
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING   
LIKE THE CONCEPT OF A SHIRO'S   
LIKE THAT REQUIRES A FRONTAL    

01:05:08.254 --> 01:05:11.722
LIKE THE CONCEPT OF A SHIRO'S   
LIKE THAT REQUIRES A FRONTAL    
LOBE CAPACITY THAT MY CHILDREN  

01:05:11.724 --> 01:05:15.327
LIKE THAT REQUIRES A FRONTAL    
LOBE CAPACITY THAT MY CHILDREN  
AT 13 AND 11 ARE YEARS AWAY     

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:15.660
LOBE CAPACITY THAT MY CHILDREN  
AT 13 AND 11 ARE YEARS AWAY     
FROM.                           

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:18.229
AT 13 AND 11 ARE YEARS AWAY     
FROM.                           
SO I THINK I PUSH BACK AGAINST  

01:05:18.231 --> 01:05:19.030
FROM.                           
SO I THINK I PUSH BACK AGAINST  
THE IDEA THAT THOSE FACILITIES  

01:05:19.032 --> 01:05:23.101
SO I THINK I PUSH BACK AGAINST  
THE IDEA THAT THOSE FACILITIES  
ARE MEANINGFUL IN TERMS         

01:05:23.103 --> 01:05:26.104
THE IDEA THAT THOSE FACILITIES  
ARE MEANINGFUL IN TERMS         
OF ALLOWING FOR CHILDREN AND    

01:05:26.106 --> 01:05:26.971
ARE MEANINGFUL IN TERMS         
OF ALLOWING FOR CHILDREN AND    
AND AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT YOU   

01:05:26.973 --> 01:05:29.974
OF ALLOWING FOR CHILDREN AND    
AND AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT YOU   
KNOW, MAY HAVE CERTAIN          

01:05:29.976 --> 01:05:30.842
AND AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT YOU   
KNOW, MAY HAVE CERTAIN          
DISABILITIES OR OTHER ISSUES TO 

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:34.012
KNOW, MAY HAVE CERTAIN          
DISABILITIES OR OTHER ISSUES TO 
REALLY UTILIZE THOSE FACILITIES 

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:34.212
DISABILITIES OR OTHER ISSUES TO 
REALLY UTILIZE THOSE FACILITIES 
.                               

01:05:34.214 --> 01:05:35.312
REALLY UTILIZE THOSE FACILITIES 
.                               
I KNOW THAT THERE IS AND I      

01:05:35.314 --> 01:05:38.482
.                               
I KNOW THAT THERE IS AND I      
THINK EVEN THIS CONCEPT OF A    

01:05:38.484 --> 01:05:39.150
I KNOW THAT THERE IS AND I      
THINK EVEN THIS CONCEPT OF A    
TWENTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR       

01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:42.420
THINK EVEN THIS CONCEPT OF A    
TWENTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR       
STREET WITH PAINT BEING SOMEHOW 

01:05:42.422 --> 01:05:45.923
TWENTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR       
STREET WITH PAINT BEING SOMEHOW 
PROTECTIVE BECAUSE IF YOU'VE    

01:05:45.925 --> 01:05:46.924
STREET WITH PAINT BEING SOMEHOW 
PROTECTIVE BECAUSE IF YOU'VE    
EVER BIKED WITH A CHILD THEY    

01:05:46.926 --> 01:05:50.061
PROTECTIVE BECAUSE IF YOU'VE    
EVER BIKED WITH A CHILD THEY    
CAN'T GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND 

01:05:50.063 --> 01:05:50.861
EVER BIKED WITH A CHILD THEY    
CAN'T GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND 
THE PAINT AGAIN MEANS NOTHING   

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:53.765
CAN'T GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND 
THE PAINT AGAIN MEANS NOTHING   
TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE 

01:05:53.767 --> 01:05:54.899
THE PAINT AGAIN MEANS NOTHING   
TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE 
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL 

01:05:54.901 --> 01:05:57.102
TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE 
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL 
OF CRITICAL THINKING TO TO      

01:05:57.104 --> 01:05:57.969
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL 
OF CRITICAL THINKING TO TO      
NAVIGATE THESE THINGS SAFELY.   

01:05:57.971 --> 01:06:01.572
OF CRITICAL THINKING TO TO      
NAVIGATE THESE THINGS SAFELY.   
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I ALWAYS FALL  

01:06:01.574 --> 01:06:02.240
NAVIGATE THESE THINGS SAFELY.   
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I ALWAYS FALL  
BACK ON IS UTILIZING SIDEWALKS  

01:06:02.242 --> 01:06:05.476
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I ALWAYS FALL  
BACK ON IS UTILIZING SIDEWALKS  
AND THAT WORKS PRETTY WELL IN   

01:06:05.478 --> 01:06:06.143
BACK ON IS UTILIZING SIDEWALKS  
AND THAT WORKS PRETTY WELL IN   
NEIGHBORHOODS I HAVE BEEN       

01:06:06.145 --> 01:06:06.878
AND THAT WORKS PRETTY WELL IN   
NEIGHBORHOODS I HAVE BEEN       
SCREAMED AT ON MAIN STREET FOR  

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.280
NEIGHBORHOODS I HAVE BEEN       
SCREAMED AT ON MAIN STREET FOR  
THAT.                           

01:06:09.282 --> 01:06:10.348
SCREAMED AT ON MAIN STREET FOR  
THAT.                           
SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO       

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:13.051
THAT.                           
SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO       
RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THESE      

01:06:13.053 --> 01:06:13.785
SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO       
RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THESE      
CONCEPTS LIKE MAKE SENSE ON     

01:06:13.787 --> 01:06:17.188
RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THESE      
CONCEPTS LIKE MAKE SENSE ON     
SOME LEVEL IN PRACTICE IT       

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.122
CONCEPTS LIKE MAKE SENSE ON     
SOME LEVEL IN PRACTICE IT       
DOESN'T MEAN FOR IN MY MIND     

01:06:18.124 --> 01:06:21.092
SOME LEVEL IN PRACTICE IT       
DOESN'T MEAN FOR IN MY MIND     
REALLY CREATE THAT KIND         

01:06:21.094 --> 01:06:21.392
DOESN'T MEAN FOR IN MY MIND     
REALLY CREATE THAT KIND         
NETWORK.                        

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.326
REALLY CREATE THAT KIND         
NETWORK.                        
I THINK SAME THING FOR LIKE I   

01:06:22.328 --> 01:06:22.960
NETWORK.                        
I THINK SAME THING FOR LIKE I   
THINK ABOUT SOMEONE IN A        

01:06:22.962 --> 01:06:24.763
I THINK SAME THING FOR LIKE I   
THINK ABOUT SOMEONE IN A        
WHEELCHAIR TRYING TO USE A      

01:06:24.765 --> 01:06:25.430
THINK ABOUT SOMEONE IN A        
WHEELCHAIR TRYING TO USE A      
PACKARD YOU KNOW, SEPARATED     

01:06:25.432 --> 01:06:29.033
WHEELCHAIR TRYING TO USE A      
PACKARD YOU KNOW, SEPARATED     
LANE WITH PAINT LIKE THAT WOULD 

01:06:29.035 --> 01:06:29.801
PACKARD YOU KNOW, SEPARATED     
LANE WITH PAINT LIKE THAT WOULD 
BE THE THE LEAST SAFE THING I   

01:06:29.803 --> 01:06:32.536
LANE WITH PAINT LIKE THAT WOULD 
BE THE THE LEAST SAFE THING I   
COULD IMAGINE.                  

01:06:32.538 --> 01:06:33.337
BE THE THE LEAST SAFE THING I   
COULD IMAGINE.                  
SO JUST WANTED WANTED TO BRING  

01:06:33.339 --> 01:06:36.740
COULD IMAGINE.                  
SO JUST WANTED WANTED TO BRING  
THAT UP AND YOU KNOW NOT TO BE  

01:06:36.742 --> 01:06:37.375
SO JUST WANTED WANTED TO BRING  
THAT UP AND YOU KNOW NOT TO BE  
CRITICAL BUT JUST TO BE         

01:06:37.377 --> 01:06:38.176
THAT UP AND YOU KNOW NOT TO BE  
CRITICAL BUT JUST TO BE         
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT  

01:06:38.178 --> 01:06:40.778
CRITICAL BUT JUST TO BE         
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT  
WHAT APPLICATIONS ARE ACTUALLY  

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.446
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT  
WHAT APPLICATIONS ARE ACTUALLY  
GOING TO MAKE US ACHIEVE OUR    

01:06:41.448 --> 01:06:44.248
WHAT APPLICATIONS ARE ACTUALLY  
GOING TO MAKE US ACHIEVE OUR    
GOAL OF HAVING A TRULY          

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.049
GOING TO MAKE US ACHIEVE OUR    
GOAL OF HAVING A TRULY          
CONNECTED NETWORK THAT IS FOR   

01:06:45.051 --> 01:06:48.352
GOAL OF HAVING A TRULY          
CONNECTED NETWORK THAT IS FOR   
ALL AGES AND ABILITIES AND      

01:06:48.354 --> 01:06:49.386
CONNECTED NETWORK THAT IS FOR   
ALL AGES AND ABILITIES AND      
THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND I 

01:06:49.388 --> 01:06:52.056
ALL AGES AND ABILITIES AND      
THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND I 
THINK PART OF IT IS REALLY      

01:06:52.058 --> 01:06:55.460
THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND I 
THINK PART OF IT IS REALLY      
UNDERSTANDING THE WHERE THE     

01:06:55.462 --> 01:06:56.194
THINK PART OF IT IS REALLY      
UNDERSTANDING THE WHERE THE     
WHERE SOME OF THESE FACILITIES  

01:06:56.196 --> 01:06:59.798
UNDERSTANDING THE WHERE THE     
WHERE SOME OF THESE FACILITIES  
COULD POSSIBLY BE AND WHEN      

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:06.570
WHERE SOME OF THESE FACILITIES  
COULD POSSIBLY BE AND WHEN      
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT WHEN    

01:07:06.572 --> 01:07:11.809
COULD POSSIBLY BE AND WHEN      
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT WHEN    
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NETWORK    

01:07:11.811 --> 01:07:14.712
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT WHEN    
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NETWORK    
AND SOME OF IT IS A LOT         

01:07:14.714 --> 01:07:15.346
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NETWORK    
AND SOME OF IT IS A LOT         
OF THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES,   

01:07:15.348 --> 01:07:18.683
AND SOME OF IT IS A LOT         
OF THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES,   
SOME MORE OF THOSE ARE REALLY   

01:07:18.685 --> 01:07:22.587
OF THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES,   
SOME MORE OF THOSE ARE REALLY   
LOWER VOLUME STREETS OR CITY    

01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:23.387
SOME MORE OF THOSE ARE REALLY   
LOWER VOLUME STREETS OR CITY    
STREETS THAN WE WOULD EXPECT TO 

01:07:23.389 --> 01:07:25.790
LOWER VOLUME STREETS OR CITY    
STREETS THAN WE WOULD EXPECT TO 
SEE MORE IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS  

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:29.360
STREETS THAN WE WOULD EXPECT TO 
SEE MORE IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS  
IN SOME PLACES BECAUSE BECAUSE  

01:07:29.362 --> 01:07:34.131
SEE MORE IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS  
IN SOME PLACES BECAUSE BECAUSE  
THEY ARE THOSE LOWER SPEEDS IN  

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:37.401
IN SOME PLACES BECAUSE BECAUSE  
THEY ARE THOSE LOWER SPEEDS IN  
THOSE LOWER VOLUME AND WHEN I   

01:07:37.403 --> 01:07:40.705
THEY ARE THOSE LOWER SPEEDS IN  
THOSE LOWER VOLUME AND WHEN I   
MEAN I I DO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL 

01:07:40.707 --> 01:07:45.610
THOSE LOWER VOLUME AND WHEN I   
MEAN I I DO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL 
AGES AND ABILITIES IS AS A      

01:07:45.612 --> 01:07:49.147
MEAN I I DO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL 
AGES AND ABILITIES IS AS A      
CONCEPT IS TO GET AS MANY AS    

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:49.947
AGES AND ABILITIES IS AS A      
CONCEPT IS TO GET AS MANY AS    
MANY PEOPLE INCORPORATED INTO   

01:07:49.949 --> 01:07:52.650
CONCEPT IS TO GET AS MANY AS    
MANY PEOPLE INCORPORATED INTO   
THE DESIGN AS POSSIBLE.         

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:53.384
MANY PEOPLE INCORPORATED INTO   
THE DESIGN AS POSSIBLE.         
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME          

01:07:53.386 --> 01:07:56.587
THE DESIGN AS POSSIBLE.         
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME          
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL STILL NEED 

01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:57.421
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME          
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL STILL NEED 
TO USE SOMETHING LIKE           

01:07:57.423 --> 01:08:00.858
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL STILL NEED 
TO USE SOMETHING LIKE           
ESCITALOPRAM ESPECIALLY AS      

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:04.728
TO USE SOMETHING LIKE           
ESCITALOPRAM ESPECIALLY AS      
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT COGNITIVE  

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:08.799
ESCITALOPRAM ESPECIALLY AS      
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT COGNITIVE  
ABILITIES WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE 

01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:09.767
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT COGNITIVE  
ABILITIES WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE 
NOT YET ABLE TO PROCESS LIKE    

01:08:09.769 --> 01:08:12.937
ABILITIES WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE 
NOT YET ABLE TO PROCESS LIKE    
VEHICLES OF THINGS.             

01:08:12.939 --> 01:08:19.844
NOT YET ABLE TO PROCESS LIKE

PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEM.  
IT'S NOT AN ACRONYM YOU         

01:15:16.295 --> 01:15:19.029
PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEM.  
IT'S NOT AN ACRONYM YOU         
NECESSARILY NEED TO REMEMBER    

01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:19.963
IT'S NOT AN ACRONYM YOU         
NECESSARILY NEED TO REMEMBER    
BUT IT'S A PLACE THAT WE        

01:15:19.965 --> 01:15:22.333
NECESSARILY NEED TO REMEMBER    
BUT IT'S A PLACE THAT WE        
REGULARLY TAKE OUT DATA AT OUR  

01:15:22.335 --> 01:15:23.134
BUT IT'S A PLACE THAT WE        
REGULARLY TAKE OUT DATA AT OUR  
AVERAGE SPEED IN THAT LOCATION  

01:15:23.136 --> 01:15:26.337
REGULARLY TAKE OUT DATA AT OUR  
AVERAGE SPEED IN THAT LOCATION  
IS TWENTY THREE MILES PER HOUR. 

01:15:26.339 --> 01:15:27.270
AVERAGE SPEED IN THAT LOCATION  
IS TWENTY THREE MILES PER HOUR. 
EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE SPEED.  

01:15:27.272 --> 01:15:30.607
IS TWENTY THREE MILES PER HOUR. 
EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE SPEED.  
SO IF YOU THINK OF IT AS A      

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:31.308
EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE SPEED.  
SO IF YOU THINK OF IT AS A      
NORMAL CURVE DISTRIBUTION THAT  

01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:34.244
SO IF YOU THINK OF IT AS A      
NORMAL CURVE DISTRIBUTION THAT  
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENTILE IS IS    

01:15:34.246 --> 01:15:35.112
NORMAL CURVE DISTRIBUTION THAT  
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENTILE IS IS    
WHERE WE LOOK TO SEE OUR PEOPLE 

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:37.781
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENTILE IS IS    
WHERE WE LOOK TO SEE OUR PEOPLE 
BEHAVING IN A MANNER THAT WE    

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:38.482
WHERE WE LOOK TO SEE OUR PEOPLE 
BEHAVING IN A MANNER THAT WE    
WANT THEM TO BEHAVE OR NOT.     

01:15:38.484 --> 01:15:41.118
BEHAVING IN A MANNER THAT WE    
WANT THEM TO BEHAVE OR NOT.     
SO THE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT      

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.019
WANT THEM TO BEHAVE OR NOT.     
SO THE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT      
SPEED IS TWENTY EIGHT MILES PER 

01:15:42.021 --> 01:15:42.820
SO THE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT      
SPEED IS TWENTY EIGHT MILES PER 
HOUR WHICH IS ABOVE WHERE WE    

01:15:42.822 --> 01:15:45.922
SPEED IS TWENTY EIGHT MILES PER 
HOUR WHICH IS ABOVE WHERE WE    
WANT THE 85 PERCENTILE SPEED    

01:15:45.924 --> 01:15:48.291
HOUR WHICH IS ABOVE WHERE WE    
WANT THE 85 PERCENTILE SPEED    
BECAUSE WE REALLY DO WANT THAT  

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:52.396
WANT THE 85 PERCENTILE SPEED    
BECAUSE WE REALLY DO WANT THAT  
TO BEGIN A LITTLE BIT LOWER AND 

01:15:52.398 --> 01:15:53.263
BECAUSE WE REALLY DO WANT THAT  
TO BEGIN A LITTLE BIT LOWER AND 
OUR AVERAGE DAILY TRAFFIC OUT   

01:15:53.265 --> 01:15:56.933
TO BEGIN A LITTLE BIT LOWER AND 
OUR AVERAGE DAILY TRAFFIC OUT   
HERE IS THREE THOUSAND FOUR     

01:15:56.935 --> 01:15:57.535
OUR AVERAGE DAILY TRAFFIC OUT   
HERE IS THREE THOUSAND FOUR     
HUNDRED NINETY ONE.             

01:15:57.537 --> 01:16:01.305
HERE IS THREE THOUSAND FOUR     
HUNDRED NINETY ONE.             
SO THAT LEFT US WITH A DESIGN   

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:04.575
HUNDRED NINETY ONE.             
SO THAT LEFT US WITH A DESIGN   
LEVEL OF MINOR STREET.          

01:16:04.577 --> 01:16:05.509
SO THAT LEFT US WITH A DESIGN   
LEVEL OF MINOR STREET.          
NOW AS WE WERE LOOKING AT       

01:16:05.511 --> 01:16:08.746
LEVEL OF MINOR STREET.          
NOW AS WE WERE LOOKING AT       
IMPLEMENTING THIS ON TO THE     

01:16:08.748 --> 01:16:09.546
NOW AS WE WERE LOOKING AT       
IMPLEMENTING THIS ON TO THE     
NEXT SLIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE    

01:16:09.548 --> 01:16:10.213
IMPLEMENTING THIS ON TO THE     
NEXT SLIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE    
ABOUT OUR ORIGINAL PROJECT      

01:16:10.215 --> 01:16:16.621
NEXT SLIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE    
ABOUT OUR ORIGINAL PROJECT      
DESIGN WE WERE WE WANTED TO     

01:16:16.623 --> 01:16:20.724
ABOUT OUR ORIGINAL PROJECT      
DESIGN WE WERE WE WANTED TO     
TIGHTEN UP THIS CROSS SECTION   

01:16:20.726 --> 01:16:24.328
DESIGN WE WERE WE WANTED TO     
TIGHTEN UP THIS CROSS SECTION   
FOR VEHICLES AS MUCH AS WE      

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:27.631
TIGHTEN UP THIS CROSS SECTION   
FOR VEHICLES AS MUCH AS WE      
COULD REALLY SORT OF NARROW     

01:16:27.633 --> 01:16:27.898
FOR VEHICLES AS MUCH AS WE      
COULD REALLY SORT OF NARROW     
THINGS.                         

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:31.235
COULD REALLY SORT OF NARROW     
THINGS.                         
>> SO WE SELECTED A TEN FOOT    

01:16:31.237 --> 01:16:35.772
THINGS.                         
>> SO WE SELECTED A TEN FOOT    
VEHICULAR LANE AND THEN LOOKING 

01:16:35.774 --> 01:16:42.679
>> SO WE SELECTED A TEN FOOT    
VEHICULAR LANE AND THEN LOOKING 
AT GETTING SIX FEET BIKE LANES  

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:46.450
VEHICULAR LANE AND THEN LOOKING 
AT GETTING SIX FEET BIKE LANES  
IN HERE AND NARROW BUFFER FOR   

01:16:46.452 --> 01:16:47.384
AT GETTING SIX FEET BIKE LANES  
IN HERE AND NARROW BUFFER FOR   
BOTH THE SOUTHBOUND AND THE

01:16:47.986 --> 01:16:49.186
BOTH THE SOUTHBOUND AND THE     
NORTHBOUND BIKE LANES.          
SO THEY BOTH HAVE ABOUT A TWO   

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:53.190
NORTHBOUND BIKE LANES.          
SO THEY BOTH HAVE ABOUT A TWO   
FOOT AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS    

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:56.660
SO THEY BOTH HAVE ABOUT A TWO   
FOOT AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS    
DESIGN PROCESS.                 

01:16:56.662 --> 01:17:00.765
FOOT AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS    
DESIGN PROCESS.                 
WE HEARD MORE ABOUT SPEEDS AND  

01:17:00.767 --> 01:17:04.568
DESIGN PROCESS.                 
WE HEARD MORE ABOUT SPEEDS AND

THOSE LAST TWO BULLET POINTS    
FURTHER UP.

MAYBE IT'S IT COULD AN AGENDA
