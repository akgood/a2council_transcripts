00:18:56.864 --> 00:18:57.796
SIX YEARS, HE'S ELIGIBLE TO BE

AND THE TERM WOULD BE THREE     
YEARS.                          
SO GOING FORWARD THEN WILL ALL  

00:19:03.637 --> 00:19:04.436

WE'RE ALREADY STACKED OK?       
WE'RE ALREADY STAGGERED.        
SO I THINK THE ISSUE IS WHETHER 

00:19:16.684 --> 00:19:20.152
WE'RE ALREADY STAGGERED.        
SO I THINK THE ISSUE IS WHETHER 
THIS IS SUBSECTION FIVE OF THE

DO WE DO WE WANT TO WE WANT TO  
CHALLENGE DO WE WANT TO SAY YOU 
KNOW, WE HAVE COMMISSIONERS WHO

WANT TO STAY AND WHO HAVE       
VALUABLE EXPERIENCE.

00:19:45.746 --> 00:19:46.145
VALUABLE EXPERIENCE.            
>> SO I THINK THERE'S TWO       
ISSUES.                         

00:19:46.147 --> 00:19:47.079
>> SO I THINK THERE'S TWO       
ISSUES.                         
THE FIRST ISSUE IS DID THE      

00:19:47.081 --> 00:19:50.348
ISSUES.                         
THE FIRST ISSUE IS DID THE      
STAGGERING COUNT RIGHT?         

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.450
THE FIRST ISSUE IS DID THE      
STAGGERING COUNT RIGHT?         
BECAUSE I WAS A PART OF THAT    

00:19:51.452 --> 00:19:54.119
STAGGERING COUNT RIGHT?         
BECAUSE I WAS A PART OF THAT    
FIRST GROUP AND I THINK I WAS   

00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:54.787
BECAUSE I WAS A PART OF THAT    
FIRST GROUP AND I THINK I WAS   
APPOINTED FOR THREE YEARS.      

00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:55.120
FIRST GROUP AND I THINK I WAS   
APPOINTED FOR THREE YEARS.      
RIGHT.                          

00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:57.155
APPOINTED FOR THREE YEARS.      
RIGHT.                          
SO DID THE STAGGERING COUNT AT  

00:19:57.157 --> 00:19:57.590
RIGHT.                          
SO DID THE STAGGERING COUNT AT  
THAT POINT.                     

00:19:57.592 --> 00:19:58.490
SO DID THE STAGGERING COUNT AT  
THAT POINT.                     
AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS THE 

00:19:58.492 --> 00:20:00.859
THAT POINT.                     
AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS THE 
OTHER ISSUE WOULD BE SHOULD     

00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:01.626
AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS THE 
OTHER ISSUE WOULD BE SHOULD     
THERE BE TERM LIMITS?           

00:20:01.628 --> 00:20:04.963
OTHER ISSUE WOULD BE SHOULD     
THERE BE TERM LIMITS?           
>> SO TWO SEPARATE ISSUES.      

00:20:04.965 --> 00:20:05.363
THERE BE TERM LIMITS?           
>> SO TWO SEPARATE ISSUES.      
RIGHT.

>> SO TWO SEPARATE ISSUES.      
RIGHT.                          
AND IF OTHER COMMISSIONS DON'T  

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.334
RIGHT.                          
AND IF OTHER COMMISSIONS DON'T  
HAVE TERM LIMITS THEN FIGURING  

00:20:09.336 --> 00:20:10.302
AND IF OTHER COMMISSIONS DON'T  
HAVE TERM LIMITS THEN FIGURING  
OUT WHY WE DO HAVE TERM LIMITS  

00:20:10.304 --> 00:20:12.938
HAVE TERM LIMITS THEN FIGURING  
OUT WHY WE DO HAVE TERM LIMITS  
RIGHT.                          

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.708
OUT WHY WE DO HAVE TERM LIMITS  
RIGHT.                          
UM, I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS      

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:17.543
RIGHT.                          
UM, I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS      
THERE COULD BE A GOOD REASON    

00:20:17.545 --> 00:20:18.143
UM, I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS      
THERE COULD BE A GOOD REASON    
FOR TERM LIMITS.                

00:20:18.145 --> 00:20:18.376
THERE COULD BE A GOOD REASON    
FOR TERM LIMITS.

BECAUSE BRINGING FRESH IDEAS

BECAUSE BRINGING FRESH IDEAS    
FRESH PEOPLE ON IS ALSO GOOD    

00:20:21.182 --> 00:20:24.916

FOR BUT I THINK THAT THOSE ARE  
THE TWO ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO

THE TWO ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO  
GET CLEAR FROM THE CLERK'S

NOT SO OK.                      
BUT MY ONLY ISSUE IS IS THAT AS 
WAS STATED IS THE EXPERIENCE    

00:25:06.366 --> 00:25:07.166
BUT MY ONLY ISSUE IS IS THAT AS 
WAS STATED IS THE EXPERIENCE    
THAT WE ACCUMULATE BECAUSE WE   

00:25:07.168 --> 00:25:10.436
WAS STATED IS THE EXPERIENCE    
THAT WE ACCUMULATE BECAUSE WE   
HAD TO DO THE GROUNDWORK FOR IT 

00:25:10.438 --> 00:25:13.472
THAT WE ACCUMULATE BECAUSE WE   
HAD TO DO THE GROUNDWORK FOR IT 
AND THE THE OTHER ISSUE IS IF   

00:25:13.474 --> 00:25:16.942
HAD TO DO THE GROUNDWORK FOR IT 
AND THE THE OTHER ISSUE IS IF   
WE LOOK AT THE COMMISSIONERS ON

REMEMBER A TIME WHEN WE HAD     

00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:26.117
STILL IN EXISTENCE AND I        
REMEMBER A TIME WHEN WE HAD     
ONLY SIX COMMISSIONERS AND IF   

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:28.987
REMEMBER A TIME WHEN WE HAD     
ONLY SIX COMMISSIONERS AND IF   
ONE HAD NOT SHOWED UP WE THINK  

00:25:28.989 --> 00:25:31.823
ONLY SIX COMMISSIONERS AND IF   
ONE HAD NOT SHOWED UP WE THINK  
THAT WE DID NOT HAVE A QUORUM.

00:25:56.383 --> 00:25:58.717
FLEXIBLE I DON'T THINK THERE    
WOULD BE ANY ISSUE IN TERMS     
OF PEOPLE JUST COMING OVER      

00:25:58.719 --> 00:25:59.818
WOULD BE ANY ISSUE IN TERMS     
OF PEOPLE JUST COMING OVER      
SITTING AND THEY WILL BE THERE  

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.088
OF PEOPLE JUST COMING OVER      
SITTING AND THEY WILL BE THERE  
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE      

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:03.955
SITTING AND THEY WILL BE THERE  
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE      
POLICE FORCE IS GOING TO        

00:26:03.957 --> 00:26:04.356
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE      
POLICE FORCE IS GOING TO        
CHANGE.                         

00:26:04.358 --> 00:26:06.825
POLICE FORCE IS GOING TO        
CHANGE.                         
THEY'RE THE NEW NEW RECRUITS,   

00:26:06.827 --> 00:26:10.829
CHANGE.                         
THEY'RE THE NEW NEW RECRUITS,   
YOUNGER ONES AND ALSO WE KNOW   

00:26:10.831 --> 00:26:14.133
THEY'RE THE NEW NEW RECRUITS,   
YOUNGER ONES AND ALSO WE KNOW   
THAT THE PROBABLY THE AVERAGE   

00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:14.933
YOUNGER ONES AND ALSO WE KNOW   
THAT THE PROBABLY THE AVERAGE   
AGE OF THE RESIDENTS OF THIS    

00:26:14.935 --> 00:26:19.070
THAT THE PROBABLY THE AVERAGE   
AGE OF THE RESIDENTS OF THIS    
TOWN IS UNDER THE AGE OF MAYBE  

00:26:19.072 --> 00:26:22.140

THIRTY THIRTY FIVE.             

00:26:22.142 --> 00:26:25.844
TOWN IS UNDER THE AGE OF MAYBE  
THIRTY THIRTY FIVE.             
SO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ISSUES   

00:26:25.846 --> 00:26:26.979
THIRTY THIRTY FIVE.             
SO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ISSUES   
THAT THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. 

00:26:26.981 --> 00:26:30.014
SO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ISSUES   
THAT THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. 
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 

00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:33.985
THAT THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. 
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 
WE PASS THE TORCH TO NEW BLOOD  

00:26:33.987 --> 00:26:34.553
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 
WE PASS THE TORCH TO NEW BLOOD  
NEW IDEAS TOO.                  

00:26:34.555 --> 00:26:37.556
WE PASS THE TORCH TO NEW BLOOD  
NEW IDEAS TOO.                  
BUT AT LEAST FOR THE STABILITY  

00:26:37.558 --> 00:26:38.389
NEW IDEAS TOO.                  
BUT AT LEAST FOR THE STABILITY  
AND FOR THE EXPERIENCE IF WE    

00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:41.993
BUT AT LEAST FOR THE STABILITY  
AND FOR THE EXPERIENCE IF WE
