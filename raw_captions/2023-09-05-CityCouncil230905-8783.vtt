OUR TRANSITION TO FEWER AND     

01:55:36.493 --> 01:55:39.927
FOR THEIR AUTOMOBILES DURING    
OUR TRANSITION TO FEWER AND     
FEWER AUTOMOBILES I I WOULD     

01:55:39.929 --> 01:55:40.729
OUR TRANSITION TO FEWER AND     
FEWER AUTOMOBILES I I WOULD     
MENTION THAT THE CIRCULAR       

01:55:40.731 --> 01:55:42.997
FEWER AUTOMOBILES I I WOULD     
MENTION THAT THE CIRCULAR       
ECONOMY IS PRO REPAIR AND THAT  

01:55:42.999 --> 01:55:43.698
MENTION THAT THE CIRCULAR       
ECONOMY IS PRO REPAIR AND THAT  
DOES REALLY NEED TO INCLUDE     

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:46.768
ECONOMY IS PRO REPAIR AND THAT  
DOES REALLY NEED TO INCLUDE     
AUTOMOBILE REPAIR.              

01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:47.836
DOES REALLY NEED TO INCLUDE     
AUTOMOBILE REPAIR.              
SO IT&apos;S THIS IS PARTLY I THINK  

01:55:47.838 --> 01:55:48.437
AUTOMOBILE REPAIR.              
SO IT&apos;S THIS IS PARTLY I THINK  
WHAT WE&apos;RE HAVING IS A          

01:55:48.439 --> 01:55:50.105
SO IT&apos;S THIS IS PARTLY I THINK  
WHAT WE&apos;RE HAVING IS A          
PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION AND I  

01:55:50.107 --> 01:55:54.175
WHAT WE&apos;RE HAVING IS A          
PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION AND I  
THINK FOR SOME OF US WE WOULD   

01:55:54.177 --> 01:55:57.879
PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION AND I  
THINK FOR SOME OF US WE WOULD   
LIKE TO SEE ONE TO BE A TO BE   

01:55:57.881 --> 01:55:58.714
THINK FOR SOME OF US WE WOULD   
LIKE TO SEE ONE TO BE A TO BE   
TO BE LEADING THE WAY WITHOUT   

01:55:58.716 --> 01:56:02.150
LIKE TO SEE ONE TO BE A TO BE   
TO BE LEADING THE WAY WITHOUT   
CARS AND WITH PEDESTRIANS AND   

01:56:02.152 --> 01:56:02.584
TO BE LEADING THE WAY WITHOUT   
CARS AND WITH PEDESTRIANS AND   
WITH BICYCLES.                  

01:56:02.586 --> 01:56:05.052
CARS AND WITH PEDESTRIANS AND   
WITH BICYCLES.                  
AND I LOVE THAT VISION BUT I    

01:56:05.054 --> 01:56:05.887
WITH BICYCLES.                  
AND I LOVE THAT VISION BUT I    
THINK THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY IN A 

01:56:05.889 --> 01:56:06.588
AND I LOVE THAT VISION BUT I    
THINK THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY IN A 
TRANSITION AND SO I THINK THAT  

01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:09.190
THINK THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY IN A 
TRANSITION AND SO I THINK THAT  
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT       

01:56:09.192 --> 01:56:13.294
TRANSITION AND SO I THINK THAT  
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT       
PEOPLE WILL BE HOPEFULLY HAVING 

01:56:13.296 --> 01:56:14.029
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT       
PEOPLE WILL BE HOPEFULLY HAVING 
ONE CAR PER HOUSEHOLD, MAYBE    

01:56:14.031 --> 01:56:17.598
PEOPLE WILL BE HOPEFULLY HAVING 
ONE CAR PER HOUSEHOLD, MAYBE    
GIVING CARS AND HAVING CAR      

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:17.899
ONE CAR PER HOUSEHOLD, MAYBE    
GIVING CARS AND HAVING CAR      
SHARES.                         

01:56:17.901 --> 01:56:18.766
GIVING CARS AND HAVING CAR      
SHARES.                         
BUT I DON&apos;T THINK THAT WE CAN   

01:56:18.768 --> 01:56:21.202
SHARES.                         
BUT I DON&apos;T THINK THAT WE CAN   
LEGISLATE CARS OUT OF EXISTENCE 

01:56:21.204 --> 01:56:24.072
BUT I DON&apos;T THINK THAT WE CAN   
LEGISLATE CARS OUT OF EXISTENCE 
NEXT YEAR AND SO I AM OK WITH   

01:56:24.074 --> 01:56:24.740
LEGISLATE CARS OUT OF EXISTENCE 
NEXT YEAR AND SO I AM OK WITH   
THE THINGS THAT ARE HERE.       

01:56:24.742 --> 01:56:25.540
NEXT YEAR AND SO I AM OK WITH   
THE THINGS THAT ARE HERE.       
I ALSO THINK THAT IT&apos;S          

01:56:25.542 --> 01:56:26.208
THE THINGS THAT ARE HERE.       
I ALSO THINK THAT IT&apos;S          
IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THE       

01:56:26.210 --> 01:56:28.509
I ALSO THINK THAT IT&apos;S          
IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THE       
EXISTING FORM BASED STANDARDS   

01:56:28.511 --> 01:56:33.014
IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THE       
EXISTING FORM BASED STANDARDS   
AND TAKE ONE MAKE IT I BELIEVE  

01:56:33.016 --> 01:56:33.715
EXISTING FORM BASED STANDARDS   
AND TAKE ONE MAKE IT I BELIEVE  
SAFE TO PERMIT LIMITED          

01:56:33.717 --> 01:56:36.184
AND TAKE ONE MAKE IT I BELIEVE  
SAFE TO PERMIT LIMITED          
AUTOMOBILE RELATED USES THERE.  

01:56:36.186 --> 01:56:36.985
SAFE TO PERMIT LIMITED          
AUTOMOBILE RELATED USES THERE.  
SO WE HAVE SETBACKS.            

01:56:36.987 --> 01:56:37.853
AUTOMOBILE RELATED USES THERE.  
SO WE HAVE SETBACKS.            
WE HAVE OTHER PEDESTRIAN        

01:56:37.855 --> 01:56:40.054
SO WE HAVE SETBACKS.            
WE HAVE OTHER PEDESTRIAN        
FRIENDLY FEATURES.              

01:56:40.056 --> 01:56:41.089
WE HAVE OTHER PEDESTRIAN        
FRIENDLY FEATURES.              
WE HAVE LIMITATIONS ON SURFACE  

01:56:41.091 --> 01:56:41.756
FRIENDLY FEATURES.              
WE HAVE LIMITATIONS ON SURFACE  
PARKING AND SURFACE PARKING     

01:56:41.758 --> 01:56:44.426
WE HAVE LIMITATIONS ON SURFACE  
PARKING AND SURFACE PARKING     
CAN&apos;T BE BETWEEN THE ROAD AND   

01:56:44.428 --> 01:56:44.959
PARKING AND SURFACE PARKING     
CAN&apos;T BE BETWEEN THE ROAD AND   
THE STOREFRONT.                 

01:56:44.961 --> 01:56:45.693
CAN&apos;T BE BETWEEN THE ROAD AND   
THE STOREFRONT.                 
I THINK THOSE THINGS MEAN THAT  

01:56:45.695 --> 01:56:48.430
THE STOREFRONT.                 
I THINK THOSE THINGS MEAN THAT  
WE MAY GET CAR RELATED USES     

01:56:48.432 --> 01:56:49.164
I THINK THOSE THINGS MEAN THAT  
WE MAY GET CAR RELATED USES     
THAT ARE MORE PALATABLE.        

01:56:49.166 --> 01:56:52.067
WE MAY GET CAR RELATED USES     
THAT ARE MORE PALATABLE.        
AND FINALLY I WANT TO SAY THAT  

01:56:52.069 --> 01:56:52.800
THAT ARE MORE PALATABLE.        
AND FINALLY I WANT TO SAY THAT  
WITHOUT MAKING THIS CHANGE      

01:56:52.802 --> 01:56:55.903
AND FINALLY I WANT TO SAY THAT  
WITHOUT MAKING THIS CHANGE      
THERE ARE EXISTING AUTO RELATED 

01:56:55.905 --> 01:56:56.672
WITHOUT MAKING THIS CHANGE      
THERE ARE EXISTING AUTO RELATED 
USES ON THESE TAXI ONE          

01:56:56.674 --> 01:56:57.139
THERE ARE EXISTING AUTO RELATED 
USES ON THESE TAXI ONE          
CORRIDORS.                      

01:56:57.141 --> 01:56:57.806
USES ON THESE TAXI ONE          
CORRIDORS.                      
OF COURSE THERE ARE BECAUSE     

01:56:57.808 --> 01:57:00.075
CORRIDORS.                      
OF COURSE THERE ARE BECAUSE     
THEY&apos;RE AT THE PERIPHERY SO     

01:57:00.077 --> 01:57:00.776
OF COURSE THERE ARE BECAUSE     
THEY&apos;RE AT THE PERIPHERY SO     
THAT&apos;S WHERE AUTO RELATED USES  

01:57:00.778 --> 01:57:01.243
THEY&apos;RE AT THE PERIPHERY SO     
THAT&apos;S WHERE AUTO RELATED USES  
HAVE BEEN.                      

01:57:01.245 --> 01:57:03.912
THAT&apos;S WHERE AUTO RELATED USES  
HAVE BEEN.                      
IF WE WE DO NOT MAKE THESE      

01:57:03.914 --> 01:57:04.579
HAVE BEEN.                      
IF WE WE DO NOT MAKE THESE      
AMENDMENTS TO TAKE ONE THE      

01:57:04.581 --> 01:57:07.382
IF WE WE DO NOT MAKE THESE      
AMENDMENTS TO TAKE ONE THE      
EXISTING AUTO RELATED HAS       

01:57:07.384 --> 01:57:07.983
AMENDMENTS TO TAKE ONE THE      
EXISTING AUTO RELATED HAS       
BECOME NONCONFORMING WHICH      

01:57:07.985 --> 01:57:11.686
EXISTING AUTO RELATED HAS       
BECOME NONCONFORMING WHICH      
MEANS THAT THEY ARE FROZEN THE  

01:57:11.688 --> 01:57:12.420
BECOME NONCONFORMING WHICH      
MEANS THAT THEY ARE FROZEN THE  
WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY WILL  

01:57:12.422 --> 01:57:15.157
MEANS THAT THEY ARE FROZEN THE  
WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY WILL  
NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY UPDATED    

01:57:15.159 --> 01:57:16.158
WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY WILL  
NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY UPDATED    
UNTIL THEY PASS OUT OF SERVICE. 

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:19.828
NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY UPDATED    
UNTIL THEY PASS OUT OF SERVICE. 
SO WE WOULD RATHER IT IS        

01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:20.462
UNTIL THEY PASS OUT OF SERVICE. 
SO WE WOULD RATHER IT IS        
POSSIBLE I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW       

01:57:20.464 --> 01:57:23.397
SO WE WOULD RATHER IT IS        
POSSIBLE I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW       
LIKELY BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT  

01:57:23.399 --> 01:57:26.867
POSSIBLE I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW       
LIKELY BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT  
THESE PLACES COULD BE RENOVATED 

01:57:26.869 --> 01:57:27.869
LIKELY BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT  
THESE PLACES COULD BE RENOVATED 
BEFORE THEY PASS OUT OF SERVICE 

01:57:27.871 --> 01:57:31.106
THESE PLACES COULD BE RENOVATED 
BEFORE THEY PASS OUT OF SERVICE 
TO BE MORE ALIGNED WITH ONE     

01:57:31.108 --> 01:57:31.439
BEFORE THEY PASS OUT OF SERVICE 
TO BE MORE ALIGNED WITH ONE     
GOALS.                          

01:57:31.441 --> 01:57:32.606
TO BE MORE ALIGNED WITH ONE     
GOALS.                          
WE RULE THAT OUT IF WE RENDER   

01:57:32.608 --> 01:57:37.278
GOALS.                          
WE RULE THAT OUT IF WE RENDER   
THEM ON CONFORMING.             

01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:37.645
WE RULE THAT OUT IF WE RENDER   
THEM ON CONFORMING.

MY HEART TO READ CAR SALES AS   
PART OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK    
OUR MINDS IMMEDIATELY GO TO

EXACTLY WHAT WE DON&apos;T WANT TO   
SEE IN THIS CORRIDOR.           

01:57:57.134 --> 01:57:58.133
EXACTLY WHAT WE DON&apos;T WANT TO   
SEE IN THIS CORRIDOR.           
BUT I SEE THIS IS VERY MUCH     

01:57:58.135 --> 01:58:00.368

BUT I SEE THIS IS VERY MUCH     
REFLECTIVE OF GROWING PAINS.    

01:58:00.370 --> 01:58:01.369
BUT I SEE THIS IS VERY MUCH     
REFLECTIVE OF GROWING PAINS.    
THIS IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO

INFRASTRUCTURE.                 
I THINK THE SECOND PART OF IT   

01:58:54.124 --> 01:58:55.089
INFRASTRUCTURE.                 
I THINK THE SECOND PART OF IT   
AROUND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS  

01:58:55.091 --> 01:58:55.856
I THINK THE SECOND PART OF IT   
AROUND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS  
THAT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO REPAIR  

01:58:55.858 --> 01:58:58.259
AROUND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS  
THAT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO REPAIR  
THEIR CARS AND NOT HAVE TO HOP  

01:58:58.261 --> 01:58:58.993
THAT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO REPAIR  
THEIR CARS AND NOT HAVE TO HOP  
INTO A CAR OR TAKE THREE        

01:58:58.995 --> 01:59:01.429
THEIR CARS AND NOT HAVE TO HOP  
INTO A CAR OR TAKE THREE        
DIFFERENT CARS OR GET MULTIPLE  

01:59:01.431 --> 01:59:02.430
INTO A CAR OR TAKE THREE        
DIFFERENT CARS OR GET MULTIPLE  
CARS TO GO AND DROP OFF THEIR   

01:59:02.432 --> 01:59:02.697
DIFFERENT CARS OR GET MULTIPLE  
CARS TO GO AND DROP OFF THEIR   
CAR.                            

01:59:02.699 --> 01:59:05.567
CARS TO GO AND DROP OFF THEIR   
CAR.                            
THAT JUST SEEMS SILLY TO ME AS  

01:59:05.569 --> 01:59:05.900

WELL.                           
AND SO THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE   

01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:09.504
WELL.                           
AND SO THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE   
TO MAINTAIN THEIR VEHICLES FOR  

01:59:09.506 --> 01:59:10.604
AND SO THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE   
TO MAINTAIN THEIR VEHICLES FOR

01:59:10.606 --> 01:59:11.272
TO MAINTAIN THEIR VEHICLES FOR

SURROUNDED BY TRANSIENT         

02:23:37.005 --> 02:23:37.671
PEOPLE DON&apos;T WANT TO BE         
SURROUNDED BY TRANSIENT         
RESIDENTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD   

02:23:37.673 --> 02:23:40.140
SURROUNDED BY TRANSIENT         
RESIDENTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD   
THAT THEY&apos;VE PUT ROOTS DOWN IN. 

02:23:40.142 --> 02:23:41.207

02:23:55.356 --> 02:23:59.325
I&apos;M LOOKING FORWARD TO          
SUPPORTING THIS DISCUSSION      
THAT&apos;S SO SO I BEGAN THIS       

02:23:59.327 --> 02:24:02.795
SUPPORTING THIS DISCUSSION      
THAT&apos;S SO SO I BEGAN THIS       
MORNING REFLECTING REFUGEE      

02:24:02.797 --> 02:24:03.563
THAT&apos;S SO SO I BEGAN THIS       
MORNING REFLECTING REFUGEE      
FAMILIES COMING TO ARE VERY     

02:24:03.565 --> 02:24:04.363
MORNING REFLECTING REFUGEE      
FAMILIES COMING TO ARE VERY     
MUCH LIKE HOW MY OWN PARENTS    

02:24:04.365 --> 02:24:07.234
FAMILIES COMING TO ARE VERY     
MUCH LIKE HOW MY OWN PARENTS    
WERE WELCOMED IN THE SEVENTIES. 

02:24:07.236 --> 02:24:07.901
MUCH LIKE HOW MY OWN PARENTS    
WERE WELCOMED IN THE SEVENTIES. 
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT MANY     

02:24:07.903 --> 02:24:10.470
WERE WELCOMED IN THE SEVENTIES. 
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT MANY     
WILL BE HOUSED IN HOTELS AND IF 

02:24:10.472 --> 02:24:11.404
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT MANY     
WILL BE HOUSED IN HOTELS AND IF 
RENTALS THAT CAN BE FOUND FOR   

02:24:11.406 --> 02:24:11.738
WILL BE HOUSED IN HOTELS AND IF 
RENTALS THAT CAN BE FOUND FOR   
FAMILIES.                       

02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:12.472
RENTALS THAT CAN BE FOUND FOR   
FAMILIES.                       
ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS THAT      

02:24:12.474 --> 02:24:14.874
FAMILIES.                       
ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS THAT      
AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE NOT       

02:24:14.876 --> 02:24:15.542
ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS THAT      
AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE NOT       
WELCOMING THEM INTO THEIR OWN   

02:24:15.544 --> 02:24:18.011
AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE NOT       
WELCOMING THEM INTO THEIR OWN   
HOMES DURING A PANDEMIC.        

02:24:18.013 --> 02:24:18.845
WELCOMING THEM INTO THEIR OWN   
HOMES DURING A PANDEMIC.        
SO WE KNOW SOUTHTOWN MIGHT NOT  

02:24:18.847 --> 02:24:21.681
HOMES DURING A PANDEMIC.        
SO WE KNOW SOUTHTOWN MIGHT NOT  
MEET REFUGEES IMMEDIATE NEEDS   

02:24:21.683 --> 02:24:22.448
SO WE KNOW SOUTHTOWN MIGHT NOT  
MEET REFUGEES IMMEDIATE NEEDS   
UNLESS THEY EMPLOY REFUGEES AND 

02:24:22.450 --> 02:24:25.719
MEET REFUGEES IMMEDIATE NEEDS   
UNLESS THEY EMPLOY REFUGEES AND 
OTHER LOW INCOME RESIDENTS.     

02:24:25.721 --> 02:24:26.653
UNLESS THEY EMPLOY REFUGEES AND 
OTHER LOW INCOME RESIDENTS.     
SO WHAT&apos;S THE CONNECTION?       

02:24:26.655 --> 02:24:27.386
OTHER LOW INCOME RESIDENTS.     
SO WHAT&apos;S THE CONNECTION?       
THE CONNECTION IS THAT WE       

02:24:27.388 --> 02:24:29.956
SO WHAT&apos;S THE CONNECTION?       
THE CONNECTION IS THAT WE       
CANNOT TRULY BE A WELCOMING     

02:24:29.958 --> 02:24:30.690
THE CONNECTION IS THAT WE       
CANNOT TRULY BE A WELCOMING     
COMMUNITY WITHOUT ADDRESSING

02:50:33.921 --> 02:50:34.453
ABOUT.                          
AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE DEMAND  
FOR THIS IS HIGH.               

02:50:34.455 --> 02:50:35.187
AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE DEMAND

ALSO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT       
AROUND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT      

02:50:35.789 --> 02:50:36.388
ALSO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT       
AROUND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT      
PROJECTS INDICATES A HIGH       

02:50:36.390 --> 02:50:36.988
AROUND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT      
PROJECTS INDICATES A HIGH       
DEMAND FOR SLOWING VEHICLE      

02:50:36.990 --> 02:50:38.857
PROJECTS INDICATES A HIGH       
DEMAND FOR SLOWING VEHICLE      
SPEEDS AND IMPROVING COMFORT ON 

02:50:38.859 --> 02:50:39.391
DEMAND FOR SLOWING VEHICLE      
SPEEDS AND IMPROVING COMFORT ON

02:50:39.393 --> 02:50:40.325
SPEEDS AND IMPROVING COMFORT ON 
OUR LOCAL STREETS.              
BUT WHERE THE PROBLEM EXISTS IS 

02:50:40.327 --> 02:50:43.428
OUR LOCAL STREETS.              
BUT WHERE THE PROBLEM EXISTS IS 
THAT THE PROCESS AS IT EXISTS   

02:50:43.430 --> 02:50:46.998
BUT WHERE THE PROBLEM EXISTS IS 
THAT THE PROCESS AS IT EXISTS   
NOW IS PRETTY ONEROUS AND IT    

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:47.565
THAT THE PROCESS AS IT EXISTS   
NOW IS PRETTY ONEROUS AND IT    
DOESN&apos;T ALLOW STAFF TO          

02:50:47.567 --> 02:50:50.568
NOW IS PRETTY ONEROUS AND IT    
DOESN&apos;T ALLOW STAFF TO          
INCORPORATE WELL-ESTABLISHED    

02:50:50.570 --> 02:50:51.436
DOESN&apos;T ALLOW STAFF TO          
INCORPORATE WELL-ESTABLISHED    
TOOLS FOR TRAFFIC COMING IN.    

02:50:51.438 --> 02:50:52.170
INCORPORATE WELL-ESTABLISHED    
TOOLS FOR TRAFFIC COMING IN.    
ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WERE 

02:50:52.172 --> 02:50:54.873
TOOLS FOR TRAFFIC COMING IN.    
ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WERE 
COMING AS NEEDED UNLESS AND     

02:50:54.875 --> 02:50:55.640
ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WERE 
COMING AS NEEDED UNLESS AND     
UNTIL RESIDENTS ENGAGE IN A     

02:50:55.642 --> 02:50:58.810
COMING AS NEEDED UNLESS AND     
UNTIL RESIDENTS ENGAGE IN A     
SEPARATE PETITION LED PROCESS.  

02:50:58.812 --> 02:51:00.145
UNTIL RESIDENTS ENGAGE IN A     
SEPARATE PETITION LED PROCESS.  
SO ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE   

02:51:00.147 --> 02:51:02.847
SEPARATE PETITION LED PROCESS.  
SO ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE   
GREENVIEW PROJECT.              

02:51:02.849 --> 02:51:03.714
SO ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE   
GREENVIEW PROJECT.              
GREENVIEW IS VERY CLOSE TO MY   

02:51:03.716 --> 02:51:04.049

GREENVIEW IS VERY CLOSE TO MY   
HOUSE.                          

02:51:04.051 --> 02:51:05.917
GREENVIEW IS VERY CLOSE TO MY   
HOUSE.                          
IT&apos;S A STREET THAT RUNS BETWEEN 

02:51:05.919 --> 02:51:06.818
HOUSE.                          
IT&apos;S A STREET THAT RUNS BETWEEN 
CYO CHURCH AND STADIUM SO IT&apos;S  

02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:09.921
IT&apos;S A STREET THAT RUNS BETWEEN 
CYO CHURCH AND STADIUM SO IT&apos;S  
USED AS A CUT THROUGH.          

02:51:09.923 --> 02:51:10.655
CYO CHURCH AND STADIUM SO IT&apos;S  
USED AS A CUT THROUGH.          
IT&apos;S ALSO EXTREMELY WIDE.       

02:51:10.657 --> 02:51:13.858
USED AS A CUT THROUGH.          
IT&apos;S ALSO EXTREMELY WIDE.       
IT RUNS STRAIGHT.               

02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:14.892
IT&apos;S ALSO EXTREMELY WIDE.       
IT RUNS STRAIGHT.               
IT HAS NO STOPS BETWEEN ONE     

02:51:14.894 --> 02:51:17.629
IT RUNS STRAIGHT.               
IT HAS NO STOPS BETWEEN ONE     
SIDE AND THE OTHER AND SO       

02:51:17.631 --> 02:51:18.496
IT HAS NO STOPS BETWEEN ONE     
SIDE AND THE OTHER AND SO       
SPEEDING HAS LONG BEEN A        

02:51:18.498 --> 02:51:19.031
SIDE AND THE OTHER AND SO       
SPEEDING HAS LONG BEEN A        
PROBLEM ON THAT ROAD.           

02:51:19.033 --> 02:51:21.766
SPEEDING HAS LONG BEEN A        
PROBLEM ON THAT ROAD.           
SO WHEN THEY WERE ENGAGING A    

02:51:21.768 --> 02:51:22.300
PROBLEM ON THAT ROAD.           
SO WHEN THEY WERE ENGAGING A    
NEIGHBORHOOD PROCESS            

02:51:22.302 --> 02:51:25.737
SO WHEN THEY WERE ENGAGING A    
NEIGHBORHOOD PROCESS            
OF ENGAGEMENT THEY CAME TO THE  

02:51:25.739 --> 02:51:26.604
NEIGHBORHOOD PROCESS            
OF ENGAGEMENT THEY CAME TO THE  
RESIDENTS AND SAID WE KNOW THAT 

02:51:26.606 --> 02:51:27.339
OF ENGAGEMENT THEY CAME TO THE  
RESIDENTS AND SAID WE KNOW THAT 
THERE&apos;S SPEEDING PROBLEM ON     

02:51:27.341 --> 02:51:27.539
RESIDENTS AND SAID WE KNOW THAT 
THERE&apos;S SPEEDING PROBLEM ON     
HERE.                           

02:51:27.541 --> 02:51:30.208
THERE&apos;S SPEEDING PROBLEM ON     
HERE.                           
WE HAVE THESE GOALS IN OUR      

02:51:30.210 --> 02:51:30.942
HERE.                           
WE HAVE THESE GOALS IN OUR      
TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO MAKE THE 

02:51:30.944 --> 02:51:33.578
WE HAVE THESE GOALS IN OUR      
TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO MAKE THE 
ROADS SAFE SO WE NEED TO SLOW   

02:51:33.580 --> 02:51:34.045
TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO MAKE THE 
ROADS SAFE SO WE NEED TO SLOW   
THE TRAFFIC.                    

02:51:34.047 --> 02:51:38.316
ROADS SAFE SO WE NEED TO SLOW   
THE TRAFFIC.                    
HOWEVER, THERE&apos;S THIS WHOLE SET 

02:51:38.318 --> 02:51:39.117
THE TRAFFIC.                    
HOWEVER, THERE&apos;S THIS WHOLE SET 
OF TOOLS THAT WE CANNOT USE     

02:51:39.119 --> 02:51:41.152
HOWEVER, THERE&apos;S THIS WHOLE SET 
OF TOOLS THAT WE CANNOT USE     
INCLUDING SPEED HUMPS.          

02:51:41.154 --> 02:51:42.053
OF TOOLS THAT WE CANNOT USE     
INCLUDING SPEED HUMPS.          
ANY VERTICAL ELEMENTS BASICALLY 

02:51:42.055 --> 02:51:46.224
INCLUDING SPEED HUMPS.          
ANY VERTICAL ELEMENTS BASICALLY 
RAISED CROSSWALKS, SPEED TABLES 

02:51:46.226 --> 02:51:46.958
ANY VERTICAL ELEMENTS BASICALLY 
RAISED CROSSWALKS, SPEED TABLES 
BECAUSE THAT IS EXCLUSIVELY THE 

02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:49.360
RAISED CROSSWALKS, SPEED TABLES 
BECAUSE THAT IS EXCLUSIVELY THE 
DOMAIN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD      

02:51:49.362 --> 02:51:50.027
BECAUSE THAT IS EXCLUSIVELY THE 
DOMAIN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD      
TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM AND     

02:51:50.029 --> 02:51:53.865
DOMAIN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD      
TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM AND     
THAT IS A SEPARATE PROCESS BY   

02:51:53.867 --> 02:51:54.199
TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM AND     
THAT IS A SEPARATE PROCESS BY   
PARTITION.                      

02:51:54.201 --> 02:51:55.199
THAT IS A SEPARATE PROCESS BY   
PARTITION.                      
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE, YOU KNOW,  

02:51:55.201 --> 02:51:56.134
PARTITION.                      
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE, YOU KNOW,  
THAT DOESN&apos;T MAKE A LOT         

02:51:56.136 --> 02:51:57.069
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE, YOU KNOW,  
THAT DOESN&apos;T MAKE A LOT         
OF SENSE TO RESIDENTS THAT      

02:51:57.071 --> 02:51:58.069
THAT DOESN&apos;T MAKE A LOT         
OF SENSE TO RESIDENTS THAT      
THERE&apos;S A WHOLE SET OF TOOLS    

02:51:58.071 --> 02:52:00.672
OF SENSE TO RESIDENTS THAT      
THERE&apos;S A WHOLE SET OF TOOLS    
THAT ARE BASICALLY EFFECTIVELY  

02:52:00.674 --> 02:52:01.873
THERE&apos;S A WHOLE SET OF TOOLS    
THAT ARE BASICALLY EFFECTIVELY  
PUT OFF TO THE SIDE AND NOT     

02:52:01.875 --> 02:52:02.540
THAT ARE BASICALLY EFFECTIVELY  
PUT OFF TO THE SIDE AND NOT     
AVAILABLE EXCEPT THROUGH A      

02:52:02.542 --> 02:52:05.042
PUT OFF TO THE SIDE AND NOT     
AVAILABLE EXCEPT THROUGH A      
SEPARATE PROCESS.               

02:52:05.044 --> 02:52:05.977
AVAILABLE EXCEPT THROUGH A      
SEPARATE PROCESS.               
SO THE WHOLE GOAL WITH THIS     

02:52:05.979 --> 02:52:06.645
SEPARATE PROCESS.               
SO THE WHOLE GOAL WITH THIS     
RESOLUTION IS TO SIMPLIFY THE   

02:52:06.647 --> 02:52:09.314
SO THE WHOLE GOAL WITH THIS     
RESOLUTION IS TO SIMPLIFY THE   
APPROVAL OF PROJECTS THAT ARE   

02:52:09.316 --> 02:52:10.114
RESOLUTION IS TO SIMPLIFY THE   
APPROVAL OF PROJECTS THAT ARE   
PART OF THE PETITION PROCESS.   

02:52:10.116 --> 02:52:10.715
APPROVAL OF PROJECTS THAT ARE   
PART OF THE PETITION PROCESS.   
SO WE&apos;RE MAINTAINING THAT
