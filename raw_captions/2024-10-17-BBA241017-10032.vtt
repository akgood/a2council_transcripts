YOU'RE TALKING MAYBE HALF A     
DOZEN BATHROOMS, DOZEN          
BATHROOMS AT THAT LEVEL.        

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.852
DOZEN BATHROOMS, DOZEN          
BATHROOMS AT THAT LEVEL.        
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.            

00:11:04.854 --> 00:11:08.322
BATHROOMS AT THAT LEVEL.        
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.            
I THINK IT'S IN TOTAL THERE'S   

00:11:08.324 --> 00:11:09.123
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.            
I THINK IT'S IN TOTAL THERE'S   
ABOUT SEVENTY THREE FIXTURES IN

I THINK IT'S IN TOTAL THERE'S   
ABOUT SEVENTY THREE FIXTURES IN 
TOTAL AND THAT SECOND WATER     

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:14.962
ABOUT SEVENTY THREE FIXTURES IN 
TOTAL AND THAT SECOND WATER     
LEVEL ONLY APPLIES TO THE       

00:11:14.964 --> 00:11:17.265
TOTAL AND THAT SECOND WATER     
LEVEL ONLY APPLIES TO THE       
SHOWER IN THE BATH IT WOULD     

00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:17.932
LEVEL ONLY APPLIES TO THE       
SHOWER IN THE BATH IT WOULD     
SHOWER IN BATHTUB.              

00:11:17.934 --> 00:11:18.766
SHOWER IN THE BATH IT WOULD     
SHOWER IN BATHTUB.              
THERE ARE A FEW LOCATIONS THAT  

00:11:18.768 --> 00:11:21.735
SHOWER IN BATHTUB.              
THERE ARE A FEW LOCATIONS THAT  
THERE ARE SOME BATHTUBS AS WELL 

00:11:21.737 --> 00:11:25.039
THERE ARE A FEW LOCATIONS THAT  
THERE ARE SOME BATHTUBS AS WELL 
AND IS THE DEEP SEA OF TRAPPED  

00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:25.440
THERE ARE SOME BATHTUBS AS WELL 
AND IS THE DEEP SEA OF TRAPPED  
FOR YOU.                        

00:11:25.442 --> 00:11:26.774
AND IS THE DEEP SEA OF TRAPPED  
FOR YOU.                        
>> SO WHAT THAT DOES IS IT      

00:11:26.776 --> 00:11:29.710
FOR YOU.                        
>> SO WHAT THAT DOES IS IT      
INCREASES THE DEPTH OF THAT     

00:11:29.712 --> 00:11:33.981
>> SO WHAT THAT DOES IS IT      
INCREASES THE DEPTH OF THAT     
TRAP SO THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND  

00:11:33.983 --> 00:11:37.418
INCREASES THE DEPTH OF THAT     
TRAP SO THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND  
HELP PREVENT ANY VACUUM         

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.085
TRAP SO THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND  
HELP PREVENT ANY VACUUM         
PRESSURE THAT'S POTENTIALLY     

00:11:38.087 --> 00:11:41.455
HELP PREVENT ANY VACUUM         
PRESSURE THAT'S POTENTIALLY     
CREATED FROM ACTUALLY THAT      

00:11:41.457 --> 00:11:42.323
PRESSURE THAT'S POTENTIALLY     
CREATED FROM ACTUALLY THAT      
WATER OUT OF THE TRAP ITSELF    

00:11:42.325 --> 00:11:45.259
CREATED FROM ACTUALLY THAT      
WATER OUT OF THE TRAP ITSELF    
AND PULLING IT WITH.            

00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:46.327
WATER OUT OF THE TRAP ITSELF    
AND PULLING IT WITH.            
SO BY DEEPENING THAT TRAP       

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:49.030
AND PULLING IT WITH.            
SO BY DEEPENING THAT TRAP       
YOU'RE ACTUALLY ARE ENSURING    

00:11:49.032 --> 00:11:49.763
SO BY DEEPENING THAT TRAP       
YOU'RE ACTUALLY ARE ENSURING    
THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGHER 

00:11:49.765 --> 00:11:50.431
YOU'RE ACTUALLY ARE ENSURING    
THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGHER 
PRESSURE THAT IT TAKES TO       

00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:53.134
THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGHER 
PRESSURE THAT IT TAKES TO       
OVERCOME IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD   

00:11:53.136 --> 00:11:53.801
PRESSURE THAT IT TAKES TO       
OVERCOME IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD   
AND ACTUALLY SIPHON THE TRAP    

00:11:53.803 --> 00:11:56.404
OVERCOME IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD   
AND ACTUALLY SIPHON THE TRAP    
ITSELF.                         

00:11:56.406 --> 00:12:00.675
AND ACTUALLY SIPHON THE TRAP    
ITSELF.                         
YOUR CONCERN IS A HIGH RISE     

00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:01.142
ITSELF.                         
YOUR CONCERN IS A HIGH RISE     
TALL BUILDING.                  

00:12:01.144 --> 00:12:02.076
YOUR CONCERN IS A HIGH RISE     
TALL BUILDING.                  
THERE'S A LOT OF WATER GOING    

00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:03.778
TALL BUILDING.                  
THERE'S A LOT OF WATER GOING    
DOWN THE STACK THAT CREATES     

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.248
THERE'S A LOT OF WATER GOING    
DOWN THE STACK THAT CREATES     
THAT PRESSURE NOT IN THIS CASE  

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.182
DOWN THE STACK THAT CREATES     
THAT PRESSURE NOT IN THIS CASE  
MAINLY BECAUSE THIS IS LEVEL    

00:12:08.184 --> 00:12:08.449
THAT PRESSURE NOT IN THIS CASE  
MAINLY BECAUSE THIS IS LEVEL    
TWO.                            

00:12:08.451 --> 00:12:09.350
MAINLY BECAUSE THIS IS LEVEL    
TWO.                            
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE BOTTOM  

00:12:09.352 --> 00:12:12.820
TWO.                            
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE BOTTOM  
OF ALL THOSE AND BECAUSE WE'RE  

00:12:12.822 --> 00:12:13.621
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE BOTTOM  
OF ALL THOSE AND BECAUSE WE'RE  
IN A HIGH RISE CONDITION WITH   

00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:16.223
OF ALL THOSE AND BECAUSE WE'RE  
IN A HIGH RISE CONDITION WITH   
THE VENTING WE HAVE THE BOTTOM  

00:12:16.225 --> 00:12:16.891
IN A HIGH RISE CONDITION WITH   
THE VENTING WE HAVE THE BOTTOM  
TWO STORIES CAN'T TIE INTO THE  

00:12:16.893 --> 00:12:19.994
THE VENTING WE HAVE THE BOTTOM  
TWO STORIES CAN'T TIE INTO THE  
REST OF THE STACKS SO THOSE ARE 

00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:20.561
TWO STORIES CAN'T TIE INTO THE  
REST OF THE STACKS SO THOSE ARE 
ALREADY SEPARATED OUT.          

00:12:20.563 --> 00:12:23.531
REST OF THE STACKS SO THOSE ARE 
ALREADY SEPARATED OUT.          
WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THAT   

00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:24.465
ALREADY SEPARATED OUT.          
WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THAT   
LOWER FLOOR HERE SO YOU HAVE    

00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:25.199
WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THAT   
LOWER FLOOR HERE SO YOU HAVE    
LESS VERTICAL STACK PRESSURES   

00:12:25.201 --> 00:12:27.835
LOWER FLOOR HERE SO YOU HAVE    
LESS VERTICAL STACK PRESSURES   
THERE AND THEN CORRECT THERE    

00:12:27.837 --> 00:12:28.603
LESS VERTICAL STACK PRESSURES   
THERE AND THEN CORRECT THERE    
WOULD BE LESS OF AN ISSUE WITH  

00:12:28.605 --> 00:12:31.705
THERE AND THEN CORRECT THERE    
WOULD BE LESS OF AN ISSUE WITH  
STACK EFFECT IN THIS CASE.      

00:12:31.707 --> 00:12:34.575
WOULD BE LESS OF AN ISSUE WITH  
STACK EFFECT IN THIS CASE.      
AND I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS 

00:12:34.577 --> 00:12:35.509
STACK EFFECT IN THIS CASE.      
AND I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS 
THE SPEAKER HAD IS THAT THERE   

00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:38.579
AND I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS 
THE SPEAKER HAD IS THAT THERE   
HASN'T BEEN AN UNTESTED SYSTEM  

00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:39.513
THE SPEAKER HAD IS THAT THERE   
HASN'T BEEN AN UNTESTED SYSTEM  
SO IT WASN'T REALLY COMMISSION  

00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:40.247
HASN'T BEEN AN UNTESTED SYSTEM  
SO IT WASN'T REALLY COMMISSION  
IS TO CONFIRM THE DEEP FRAPPIER 

00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:43.684
SO IT WASN'T REALLY COMMISSION  
IS TO CONFIRM THE DEEP FRAPPIER 
WORK AS FAR AS OK, WE'RE GOING  

00:12:43.686 --> 00:12:44.419
IS TO CONFIRM THE DEEP FRAPPIER 
WORK AS FAR AS OK, WE'RE GOING  
TO SEE IF THE VACUUMING SYSTEM  

00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:47.355
WORK AS FAR AS OK, WE'RE GOING  
TO SEE IF THE VACUUMING SYSTEM  
WORKS AND IT'LL BE, YOU KNOW,   

00:12:47.357 --> 00:12:48.155
TO SEE IF THE VACUUMING SYSTEM  
WORKS AND IT'LL BE, YOU KNOW,   
ALLEVIATE THE CONCERN AND WE    

00:12:48.157 --> 00:12:48.622
WORKS AND IT'LL BE, YOU KNOW,   
ALLEVIATE THE CONCERN AND WE    
HAVE A DEEP TRAP.               

00:12:48.624 --> 00:12:51.258
ALLEVIATE THE CONCERN AND WE    
HAVE A DEEP TRAP.               
LET'S GO AHEAD AND TEST IT OUT  

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:51.893
HAVE A DEEP TRAP.               
LET'S GO AHEAD AND TEST IT OUT  
AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY DO      

00:12:51.895 --> 00:12:52.493
LET'S GO AHEAD AND TEST IT OUT  
AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY DO      
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            

00:12:52.495 --> 00:12:54.661
AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY DO      
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            
YEAH, I DON'T BELIEVE ANY       

00:12:54.663 --> 00:12:55.596
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            
YEAH, I DON'T BELIEVE ANY       
OF THE DRAIN PANS HAVE BEEN     

00:12:55.598 --> 00:12:56.264
YEAH, I DON'T BELIEVE ANY       
OF THE DRAIN PANS HAVE BEEN     
INSTALLED YET BUT WE COULD      

00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:59.500
OF THE DRAIN PANS HAVE BEEN     
INSTALLED YET BUT WE COULD      
CERTAINLY SET UP A TEST AND IF  

00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:00.134
INSTALLED YET BUT WE COULD      
CERTAINLY SET UP A TEST AND IF  
THE INSPECTOR WOULD LIKE TO     

00:13:00.136 --> 00:13:01.902
CERTAINLY SET UP A TEST AND IF  
THE INSPECTOR WOULD LIKE TO     
COME OUT AND WITNESS THAT TEST  

00:13:01.904 --> 00:13:02.937
THE INSPECTOR WOULD LIKE TO     
COME OUT AND WITNESS THAT TEST  
,I THINK THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD   

00:13:02.939 --> 00:13:05.540
COME OUT AND WITNESS THAT TEST  
,I THINK THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD   
AND GET THAT ACCOMPLISHED ON    

00:13:05.542 --> 00:13:09.811
,I THINK THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD   
AND GET THAT ACCOMPLISHED ON    
AND I JUST RECOMMEND THAT MAYBE 

00:13:09.813 --> 00:13:10.678
AND GET THAT ACCOMPLISHED ON    
AND I JUST RECOMMEND THAT MAYBE 
WE HAVE WE'LL GO AHEAD AND      

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.412
AND I JUST RECOMMEND THAT MAYBE 
WE HAVE WE'LL GO AHEAD AND      
INSTALL THE PIPING SO THE TRAP  

00:13:11.414 --> 00:13:14.214
WE HAVE WE'LL GO AHEAD AND      
INSTALL THE PIPING SO THE TRAP  
HAS A CLEAN AT THE BOTTOM       

00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:14.449
