IN AND ACTUALLY GOING TO ALTER  
PART OF THE REASON OF MOVING    
THE GARAGE AND ADDING BACK IS   

00:17:39.605 --> 00:17:40.738
PART OF THE REASON OF MOVING    
THE GARAGE AND ADDING BACK IS   
TO GIVE US MORE ROOM TO TO      

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.507
THE GARAGE AND ADDING BACK IS   
TO GIVE US MORE ROOM TO TO      
CHANGE THE DRIVEWAY SO THEY CAN 

00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:44.341
TO GIVE US MORE ROOM TO TO      
CHANGE THE DRIVEWAY SO THEY CAN 
AVOID THAT TREE AS MUCH AS

00:17:48.013 --> 00:17:50.581
POSSIBLE.                       
THE FEELING OF THE OBVERSE WAS  
THAT TREE IS ACTUALLY IN QUITE  

00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:50.915
THE FEELING OF THE OBVERSE WAS  
THAT TREE IS ACTUALLY IN QUITE  
GOOD SHAPE.                     

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:51.883
THAT TREE IS ACTUALLY IN QUITE  
GOOD SHAPE.                     
THEY THINK IT'S ABOUT HUNDRED   

00:17:51.885 --> 00:17:55.085
GOOD SHAPE.                     
THEY THINK IT'S ABOUT HUNDRED   
AND FIFTY YEARS OLD ABOUT THE   

00:17:55.087 --> 00:17:55.919
THEY THINK IT'S ABOUT HUNDRED

YOU WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT    
THE THE DRIVEWAY.               
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT BECAUSE 

00:18:31.724 --> 00:18:32.523
THE THE DRIVEWAY.               
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT BECAUSE 
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE TREES   

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:33.390
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT BECAUSE 
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE TREES   
BUT MY QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE   

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:35.058
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE TREES   
BUT MY QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE   
DRIVEWAY.                       

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:35.926
BUT MY QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE   
DRIVEWAY.                       
BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT RELEVANT     

00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:39.096

ANYMORE IF YOU'RE GOING TO      
CHANGE THE DRIVEWAY.            
BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A SITE    

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:46.637
CHANGE THE DRIVEWAY.            
BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A SITE    
PLAN AND ON THE SITE PLAN

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.541
PLAN AND ON THE SITE PLAN       
YOU'VE GOT THE CONCRETE DRIVE   
THERE BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT   

00:18:50.543 --> 00:18:54.078
YOU'VE GOT THE CONCRETE DRIVE   
THERE BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT   
WHAT IS EXISTING CONCRETE AND

ACTUALLY IS A LITTLE SMALLER    
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO IMPACT

ACTUALLY IS A LITTLE SMALLER    
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO IMPACT   
THE HISTORIC HOME AT ALL.

00:20:12.157 --> 00:20:13.090
THE HISTORIC HOME AT ALL.       
TYPICALLY A PERSPECTIVE DRAWING 
IS EVEN BETTER IF YOU HAVE IT   

00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:15.426
TYPICALLY A PERSPECTIVE DRAWING 
IS EVEN BETTER IF YOU HAVE IT   
IN 3D BECAUSE THAT THE          

00:20:15.428 --> 00:20:16.093
IS EVEN BETTER IF YOU HAVE IT   
IN 3D BECAUSE THAT THE          
ELEVATION EVERYTHING LOOKS      

00:20:16.095 --> 00:20:19.329
IN 3D BECAUSE THAT THE          
ELEVATION EVERYTHING LOOKS      
REALLY TALL IN IT ELEVATION BUT 

00:20:19.331 --> 00:20:20.197
ELEVATION EVERYTHING LOOKS      
REALLY TALL IN IT ELEVATION BUT 
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM

REALLY TALL IN IT ELEVATION BUT 
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM  
THE SIDEWALK IT'S GOING TO LOOK 

00:20:22.935 --> 00:20:24.135
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM  
THE SIDEWALK IT'S GOING TO LOOK 
YOU KNOW, IN MY MIND I'M TRYING 

00:20:24.137 --> 00:20:27.104
THE SIDEWALK IT'S GOING TO LOOK 
YOU KNOW, IN MY MIND I'M TRYING 
TO IMAGINE IT AND IT'S HARD     

00:20:27.106 --> 00:20:28.038
YOU KNOW, IN MY MIND I'M TRYING 
TO IMAGINE IT AND IT'S HARD     
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A DRAWING  

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.706
TO IMAGINE IT AND IT'S HARD     
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A DRAWING  
BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S TALL BUT     

00:20:28.708 --> 00:20:31.708
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A DRAWING  
BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S TALL BUT     
IT'S ALSO FAR AWAY SO YOU KNOW  

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:32.309
BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S TALL BUT     
IT'S ALSO FAR AWAY SO YOU KNOW  
WHICH WHICH WINDS THERE?        

00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:35.612
IT'S ALSO FAR AWAY SO YOU KNOW  
WHICH WHICH WINDS THERE?        
IS IT THE FAR AWAY THAT'S       

00:20:35.614 --> 00:20:36.380
WHICH WHICH WINDS THERE?        
IS IT THE FAR AWAY THAT'S       
WINNING MORE OR IS THAT THE     

00:20:36.382 --> 00:20:38.282
IS IT THE FAR AWAY THAT'S       
WINNING MORE OR IS THAT THE     
TALLER THAT'S WINNING MORE AND  

00:20:38.284 --> 00:20:39.216
WINNING MORE OR IS THAT THE     
TALLER THAT'S WINNING MORE AND  
SO WE'RE JUST KIND OF GUESSING  

00:20:39.218 --> 00:20:39.817
TALLER THAT'S WINNING MORE AND  
SO WE'RE JUST KIND OF GUESSING  
RIGHT NOW WITHOUT EITHER        

00:20:39.819 --> 00:20:42.353
SO WE'RE JUST KIND OF GUESSING  
RIGHT NOW WITHOUT EITHER        
OF THOSE TWO DRAWINGS AND       

00:20:42.355 --> 00:20:43.320
RIGHT NOW WITHOUT EITHER        
OF THOSE TWO DRAWINGS AND       
UNFORTUNATELY WE YOU KNOW, WE   

00:20:43.322 --> 00:20:46.990
OF THOSE TWO DRAWINGS AND       
UNFORTUNATELY WE YOU KNOW, WE   
HAVE TO WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE

THE HISTORIC PROPERTY SO IF     
WE'RE GUESSING THAT'S PROBABLY  

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:51.862
THE HISTORIC PROPERTY SO IF     
WE'RE GUESSING THAT'S PROBABLY  
NOT NOT GOOD FOR US BECAUSE     

00:20:51.864 --> 00:20:54.898
WE'RE GUESSING THAT'S PROBABLY  
NOT NOT GOOD FOR US BECAUSE     
WHERE WE WANT TO BE MORE        

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.703
NOT NOT GOOD FOR US BECAUSE     
WHERE WE WANT TO BE MORE        
CONSERVATIVE SO I JUST THAT WAS 

00:20:58.705 --> 00:20:59.570
WHERE WE WANT TO BE MORE        
CONSERVATIVE SO I JUST THAT WAS 
THAT WAS TWO COMMENTS I GUESS   

00:20:59.572 --> 00:21:02.973
CONSERVATIVE SO I JUST THAT WAS 
THAT WAS TWO COMMENTS I GUESS   
THOSE ARE TWO QUESTIONS AT ALL  

00:21:02.975 --> 00:21:03.641
THAT WAS TWO COMMENTS I GUESS   
THOSE ARE TWO QUESTIONS AT ALL  
BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO COMMENT   

00:21:03.643 --> 00:21:06.310
THOSE ARE TWO QUESTIONS AT ALL  
BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO COMMENT

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:13.150
>> YEAH, SO THE EVERYTHING      
THAT'S THERE IS EXISTING        
BECAUSE YOU SORT OF INCREMENTAL 

00:21:13.152 --> 00:21:14.018
THAT'S THERE IS EXISTING        
BECAUSE YOU SORT OF INCREMENTAL 
AS FAR AS THE DRIVEWAY.         

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.685
BECAUSE YOU SORT OF INCREMENTAL 
AS FAR AS THE DRIVEWAY.         
SO THAT'S ALL CONCRETE NOW.     

00:21:14.687 --> 00:21:17.954
AS FAR AS THE DRIVEWAY.         
SO THAT'S ALL CONCRETE NOW.     
BUT IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE   

00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:18.622
SO THAT'S ALL CONCRETE NOW.     
BUT IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE   
INTERESTED OBVIOUSLY WE CAN     

00:21:18.624 --> 00:21:21.292
BUT IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE   
INTERESTED OBVIOUSLY WE CAN     
WORK WITH THE ARCHITECT ON THAT 

00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:25.929
INTERESTED OBVIOUSLY WE CAN     
WORK WITH THE ARCHITECT ON THAT 
REPRESENTATION TO SHOW WHERE WE 

00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:26.596
WORK WITH THE ARCHITECT ON THAT 
REPRESENTATION TO SHOW WHERE WE 
WOULD EXPECT THE PERMEABLE      

00:21:26.598 --> 00:21:28.632
REPRESENTATION TO SHOW WHERE WE 
WOULD EXPECT THE PERMEABLE      
DRIVEWAY TO REPLACE.            

00:21:28.634 --> 00:21:29.733
WOULD EXPECT THE PERMEABLE      
DRIVEWAY TO REPLACE.            
BUT OUR PLAN IS TO GET RID      

00:21:29.735 --> 00:21:32.502
DRIVEWAY TO REPLACE.            
BUT OUR PLAN IS TO GET RID      
OF ALL THE CONCRETE FOR FOR     

00:21:32.504 --> 00:21:33.371
BUT OUR PLAN IS TO GET RID      
OF ALL THE CONCRETE FOR FOR
