HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.            
FIRST BUILD A TWENTY TWENTY ONE 

00:33:48.551 --> 00:33:49.216
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.            
FIRST BUILD A TWENTY TWENTY ONE 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS     

00:33:49.218 --> 00:33:52.720
FIRST BUILD A TWENTY TWENTY ONE 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS     
THEN CALCULATE THE RENEWABLE    

00:33:52.722 --> 00:33:53.421
ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS     
THEN CALCULATE THE RENEWABLE    
ENERGY NEEDS FROM ENERGY        

00:33:53.423 --> 00:33:55.756
THEN CALCULATE THE RENEWABLE    
ENERGY NEEDS FROM ENERGY        
SIMULATION OR STANDARD TABLE    

00:33:55.758 --> 00:33:56.724

OFFSIDE RENEWABLE ENERGY.       

00:33:59.929 --> 00:34:00.862
AND ACHIEVE THAT WITH ONSIDE OR 
OFFSIDE RENEWABLE ENERGY.       
>> AND OBVIOUSLY THIS           

00:34:00.864 --> 00:34:04.265
OFFSIDE RENEWABLE ENERGY.       
>> AND OBVIOUSLY THIS           
INCENTIVIZES BUILDINGS THAT ARE 

00:34:04.267 --> 00:34:07.769
>> AND OBVIOUSLY THIS           
INCENTIVIZES BUILDINGS THAT ARE 
MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT THAN      

00:34:07.771 --> 00:34:08.102
INCENTIVIZES BUILDINGS THAT ARE 
MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT THAN      
CODE .                          

00:34:08.104 --> 00:34:09.036
MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT THAN

00:34:09.038 --> 00:34:11.472
CODE .                          
SO THE PLAN DOESN'T AND DOES    
MENTION ENERGY EFFICIENCY BUT   

00:34:11.474 --> 00:34:11.972
SO THE PLAN DOESN'T AND DOES    
MENTION ENERGY EFFICIENCY BUT   
ONLY IN PASSING.                

00:34:11.974 --> 00:34:13.040
MENTION ENERGY EFFICIENCY BUT   
ONLY IN PASSING.                
I THINK WE SHOULD BRING IN THE

I THINK WE SHOULD BRING IN THE  
SPECIFICS.                      
THE PLAN ALSO FALLS SHORT IN

I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE         

03:22:21.721 --> 03:22:24.021
AGREE WITH HIM.                 
I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE         
STATEMENT THAT SEGREGATION WAS  

03:22:24.023 --> 03:22:24.722
I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE         
STATEMENT THAT SEGREGATION WAS  
NOT BASED ON CITY LAW.          

03:22:24.724 --> 03:22:27.792
STATEMENT THAT SEGREGATION WAS  
NOT BASED ON CITY LAW.          
>> I THINK MINIMUM LARGE        

03:22:27.794 --> 03:22:28.660
NOT BASED ON CITY LAW.          
>> I THINK MINIMUM LARGE        
MINIMUM LOT SIZES WAS QUITE     

03:22:28.662 --> 03:22:32.563
>> I THINK MINIMUM LARGE        
MINIMUM LOT SIZES WAS QUITE     
CLEARLY SOMETHING IN CITY LAW   

03:22:32.565 --> 03:22:33.097
MINIMUM LOT SIZES WAS QUITE     
CLEARLY SOMETHING IN CITY LAW   
THAT CREATED RACIAL             

03:22:33.099 --> 03:22:33.498
CLEARLY SOMETHING IN CITY LAW   
THAT CREATED RACIAL             
SEGREGATION.                    

03:22:33.500 --> 03:22:36.501
THAT CREATED RACIAL             
SEGREGATION.                    
SO I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW   

03:22:36.503 --> 03:22:37.434
SEGREGATION.                    
SO I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW   
AND I'M SURE THAT IF HE AND I   

03:22:37.436 --> 03:22:40.070
SO I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW   
AND I'M SURE THAT IF HE AND I   
HAD A CONVERSATION WE MIGHT     

03:22:40.072 --> 03:22:40.871
AND I'M SURE THAT IF HE AND I   
HAD A CONVERSATION WE MIGHT     
COME TO SEE THAT SIMILARLY.     

03:22:40.873 --> 03:22:44.209
HAD A CONVERSATION WE MIGHT     
COME TO SEE THAT SIMILARLY.     
BUT HE DID MENTION THAT WE DO   

03:22:44.211 --> 03:22:44.942
COME TO SEE THAT SIMILARLY.     
BUT HE DID MENTION THAT WE DO   
NOT MENTION ANN ARBOR PASSING   

03:22:44.944 --> 03:22:48.346
BUT HE DID MENTION THAT WE DO   
NOT MENTION ANN ARBOR PASSING   
THE FIRST OPEN HOUSING LAW IN   

03:22:48.348 --> 03:22:49.446
NOT MENTION ANN ARBOR PASSING   
THE FIRST OPEN HOUSING LAW IN   
THE NATION IN THE TIME LINE AND 

03:22:49.448 --> 03:22:52.783
THE FIRST OPEN HOUSING LAW IN   
THE NATION IN THE TIME LINE AND 
WE MIGHT WANT TO PUT THAT IN    

03:22:52.785 --> 03:22:55.119
THE NATION IN THE TIME LINE AND 
WE MIGHT WANT TO PUT THAT IN    
BECAUSE THAT DID HAPPEN.        

03:22:55.121 --> 03:22:59.824
WE MIGHT WANT TO PUT THAT IN    
BECAUSE THAT DID HAPPEN.        
IT IT WAS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN   

03:22:59.826 --> 03:23:03.093
BECAUSE THAT DID HAPPEN.        
IT IT WAS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN   
THE TIME OF ADOPTING THOSE      

03:23:03.095 --> 03:23:03.427
IT IT WAS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN   
THE TIME OF ADOPTING THOSE      
MINIMUMS.                       

03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:06.964
THE TIME OF ADOPTING THOSE      
MINIMUMS.                       
SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED      

03:23:06.966 --> 03:23:07.232
MINIMUMS.                       
SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED      
HISTORY.                        

03:23:07.234 --> 03:23:08.165
SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED      
HISTORY.                        
BUT I THINK HIS COMMENTS BOIL   

03:23:08.167 --> 03:23:11.603

AND I'M BEING A LITTLE BIT      
CRUDE BUT IF I'M BOILING IT     

03:23:16.876 --> 03:23:19.743

CODE ENFORCEMENT AND THAT WAS A 
A TOOL THAT THEY USED TO        

03:24:32.351 --> 03:24:36.220
CODE ENFORCEMENT AND THAT WAS A 
A TOOL THAT THEY USED TO        
DISPLACE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

A TOOL THAT THEY USED TO

INSURANCE MAP WAS A TOOL THAT   
WAS USED TO DENY MORTGAGES TO   

03:24:52.838 --> 03:24:53.504
INSURANCE MAP WAS A TOOL THAT   
WAS USED TO DENY MORTGAGES TO   
AFRICAN-AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY

03:29:13.399 --> 03:29:17.001
,DR. MCGRAY HAD FINISHED A      
STUDY THAT SHE'S ARCHITECTS     
THAT INCLUDED SOME FIGURES      

03:29:17.003 --> 03:29:17.801
STUDY THAT SHE'S ARCHITECTS     
THAT INCLUDED SOME FIGURES      
SHOWING THROUGHOUT IT'S IT'S    

03:29:17.803 --> 03:29:21.471
THAT INCLUDED SOME FIGURES      
SHOWING THROUGHOUT IT'S IT'S    
NOT SO MUCH THEY DON'T          

03:29:21.473 --> 03:29:22.239
SHOWING THROUGHOUT IT'S IT'S    
NOT SO MUCH THEY DON'T          
NECESSARILY SHOW THROUGHOUT THE 

03:29:22.241 --> 03:29:25.175
NOT SO MUCH THEY DON'T          
NECESSARILY SHOW THROUGHOUT THE 
COURSE OF A DAY BUT AT THE      

03:29:25.177 --> 03:29:25.976
NECESSARILY SHOW THROUGHOUT THE 
COURSE OF A DAY BUT AT THE      
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE    

03:29:25.978 --> 03:29:26.944
COURSE OF A DAY BUT AT THE      
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE    
YEAR LIKE WHEN THERE WOULD BE   

03:29:26.946 --> 03:29:29.814
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE    
YEAR LIKE WHEN THERE WOULD BE   
SHADING AND WHEN THERE WOULD    

03:29:29.816 --> 03:29:33.450
YEAR LIKE WHEN THERE WOULD BE   
SHADING AND WHEN THERE WOULD    
NOT BE SHADING AND SO I WILL    

03:29:33.452 --> 03:29:34.285
SHADING AND WHEN THERE WOULD    
NOT BE SHADING AND SO I WILL    
FIGURE OUT I THINK I DON'T KNOW 

03:29:34.287 --> 03:29:37.688
NOT BE SHADING AND SO I WILL    
FIGURE OUT I THINK I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE THAT IS PUBLIC BUT I I    

03:29:37.690 --> 03:29:38.222
FIGURE OUT I THINK I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE THAT IS PUBLIC BUT I I    
SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS          

03:29:38.224 --> 03:29:41.792
WHERE THAT IS PUBLIC BUT I I    
SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS          
FINALIZED SO I'LL PUT THAT ON   

03:29:41.794 --> 03:29:42.192
SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS          
FINALIZED SO I'LL PUT THAT ON   
MY BACK.                        

03:29:42.194 --> 03:29:42.860
FINALIZED SO I'LL PUT THAT ON   
MY BACK.                        
>> I'LL DIG IT OUT.             

03:29:42.862 --> 03:29:43.261
MY BACK.                        
>> I'LL DIG IT OUT.             
YEAH.                           

03:29:43.263 --> 03:29:45.329
>> I'LL DIG IT OUT.             
YEAH.                           
IT WAS LOOKING AT LIKE WINTER   

03:29:45.331 --> 03:29:45.930
YEAH.                           
IT WAS LOOKING AT LIKE WINTER   
SOLSTICE SUMMER SOLSTICE AND    

03:29:45.932 --> 03:29:48.999
IT WAS LOOKING AT LIKE WINTER   
SOLSTICE SUMMER SOLSTICE AND    
THEN I THINK IT WAS LIKE NINE   

03:29:49.001 --> 03:29:49.700
SOLSTICE SUMMER SOLSTICE AND    
THEN I THINK IT WAS LIKE NINE   
A.M. NOON THREE P.M. SIX P.M.   

03:29:49.702 --> 03:29:52.837
THEN I THINK IT WAS LIKE NINE   
A.M. NOON THREE P.M. SIX P.M.   
AND IT WAS THREE STORIES I      

03:29:52.839 --> 03:29:56.873
A.M. NOON THREE P.M. SIX P.M.   
AND IT WAS THREE STORIES I      
THINK IT DIDN'T GO HIGHER THAN  

03:29:56.875 --> 03:30:00.278
AND IT WAS THREE STORIES I      
THINK IT DIDN'T GO HIGHER THAN  
THAN FOUR OR FIVE STORIES RIGHT 

03:30:00.280 --> 03:30:01.211
THINK IT DIDN'T GO HIGHER THAN  
THAN FOUR OR FIVE STORIES RIGHT 
NEXT TO A SINGLE FAMILY.        

03:30:01.213 --> 03:30:03.347
THAN FOUR OR FIVE STORIES RIGHT 
NEXT TO A SINGLE FAMILY.        
SO THERE WERE A FEW DIFFERENT   

03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:04.282
NEXT TO A SINGLE FAMILY.        
SO THERE WERE A FEW DIFFERENT   
SCENARIOS SO WE CAN DIG THAT    

03:30:04.284 --> 03:30:07.918
SO THERE WERE A FEW DIFFERENT   
SCENARIOS SO WE CAN DIG THAT    
OUT AND SEE WHERE WE CAN REFER  

03:30:07.920 --> 03:30:08.652
SCENARIOS SO WE CAN DIG THAT    
OUT AND SEE WHERE WE CAN REFER  
TO THAT IN THE PLAN AND THAT    

03:30:08.654 --> 03:30:11.822
OUT AND SEE WHERE WE CAN REFER  
TO THAT IN THE PLAN AND THAT    
MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO THAT   

03:30:11.824 --> 03:30:12.589
TO THAT IN THE PLAN AND THAT    
MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO THAT   
TAUBMAN MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN  

03:30:12.591 --> 03:30:15.926
MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO THAT   
TAUBMAN MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN  
PUTTING ONLINE THAT THEN YOU    

03:30:15.928 --> 03:30:16.327
TAUBMAN MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN  
PUTTING ONLINE THAT THEN YOU    
COULD REFER TO.                 

03:30:16.329 --> 03:30:17.294
PUTTING ONLINE THAT THEN YOU    
COULD REFER TO.                 
SO THAT'S WHAT I WILL ACTUALLY  

03:30:17.296 --> 03:30:20.063
COULD REFER TO.                 
SO THAT'S WHAT I WILL ACTUALLY  
FOLLOW UP BECAUSE THEN YOU      

03:30:20.065 --> 03:30:20.631
SO THAT'S WHAT I WILL ACTUALLY  
FOLLOW UP BECAUSE THEN YOU      
COULD REFERENCE IT.             

03:30:20.633 --> 03:30:21.298
FOLLOW UP BECAUSE THEN YOU      
COULD REFERENCE IT.             
IT WOULD BE FAIRLY ACCESSIBLE   

03:30:21.300 --> 03:30:23.300
COULD REFERENCE IT.             
IT WOULD BE FAIRLY ACCESSIBLE   
ACTUALLY JUST FOR WHAT IT'S     

03:30:23.302 --> 03:30:23.501
IT WOULD BE FAIRLY ACCESSIBLE   
ACTUALLY JUST FOR WHAT IT'S     
WORTH.

03:30:27.673 --> 03:30:31.641
I THINK IT'S A REALLY COOL      
ANALYSIS OTHER COMMUNITIES      
MIGHT HAVE INTEREST IN AND ONE  

03:30:31.643 --> 03:30:32.409
ANALYSIS OTHER COMMUNITIES      
MIGHT HAVE INTEREST IN AND ONE  
OF THE THINGS THAT MY CENTER    

03:30:32.411 --> 03:30:33.277
MIGHT HAVE INTEREST IN AND ONE  
OF THE THINGS THAT MY CENTER    
DOES IS TO TRY TO SHARE THESE   

03:30:33.279 --> 03:30:34.812
OF THE THINGS THAT MY CENTER    
DOES IS TO TRY TO SHARE THESE   
KIND OF THINGS AND THE FEEDBACK 

03:30:34.814 --> 03:30:35.746
DOES IS TO TRY TO SHARE THESE   
KIND OF THINGS AND THE FEEDBACK 
WAS IT IS VERY SPECIFICALLY     

03:30:35.748 --> 03:30:39.082
KIND OF THINGS AND THE FEEDBACK 
WAS IT IS VERY SPECIFICALLY     
TAILORED TO OUR LATITUDE AND SO 

03:30:39.084 --> 03:30:42.819
WAS IT IS VERY SPECIFICALLY     
TAILORED TO OUR LATITUDE AND SO 
WE SHOULD NOT LIKE THERE THERE  

03:30:42.821 --> 03:30:43.387
TAILORED TO OUR LATITUDE AND SO 
WE SHOULD NOT LIKE THERE THERE  
ARE LIMITATIONS TO              

03:30:43.389 --> 03:30:46.590
WE SHOULD NOT LIKE THERE THERE  
ARE LIMITATIONS TO              
GENERALIZABILITY AND SO THIS IS 

03:30:46.592 --> 03:30:47.391
ARE LIMITATIONS TO              
GENERALIZABILITY AND SO THIS IS 
VERY MUCH FOR ANN ARBOR.        

03:30:47.393 --> 03:30:50.227
GENERALIZABILITY AND SO THIS IS 
VERY MUCH FOR ANN ARBOR.        
IT WAS BASED ON A FIVE FOOT     

03:30:50.229 --> 03:30:51.228
VERY MUCH FOR ANN ARBOR.        
IT WAS BASED ON A FIVE FOOT     
BACK DISTANCE WHICH IS WHAT WE  

03:30:51.230 --> 03:30:55.099
IT WAS BASED ON A FIVE FOOT     
BACK DISTANCE WHICH IS WHAT WE  
HAVE IN OUR ONE B I DON'T KNOW  

03:30:55.101 --> 03:30:57.567
BACK DISTANCE WHICH IS WHAT WE  
HAVE IN OUR ONE B I DON'T KNOW  
WHICH ONE AND ONE OF THE ONE    

03:30:57.569 --> 03:30:58.135
HAVE IN OUR ONE B I DON'T KNOW  
WHICH ONE AND ONE OF THE ONE    
OF OUR SPECIFIC ZONING          

03:30:58.137 --> 03:30:58.469
WHICH ONE AND ONE OF THE ONE    
OF OUR SPECIFIC ZONING          
DISTRICTS.                      

03:30:58.471 --> 03:30:59.203
OF OUR SPECIFIC ZONING          
DISTRICTS.                      
AND SO THERE WERE SOME          

03:30:59.205 --> 03:31:01.806
DISTRICTS.                      
AND SO THERE WERE SOME          
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT      

03:31:01.808 --> 03:31:02.473
AND SO THERE WERE SOME          
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT      
WOULD BE SUPER USEFUL TO        

03:31:02.475 --> 03:31:02.940
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT      
WOULD BE SUPER USEFUL TO        
GENERALIZE IT.                  

03:31:02.942 --> 03:31:06.209
WOULD BE SUPER USEFUL TO        
GENERALIZE IT.                  
SO I DIDN'T PUT IT OUT THROUGH  

03:31:06.211 --> 03:31:06.877
GENERALIZE IT.                  
SO I DIDN'T PUT IT OUT THROUGH  
THE CENTER FOR EMPOWERING       

03:31:06.879 --> 03:31:09.847
SO I DIDN'T PUT IT OUT THROUGH  
THE CENTER FOR EMPOWERING       
COMMUNITIES BUT I I WILL FOLLOW 

03:31:09.849 --> 03:31:10.781
THE CENTER FOR EMPOWERING       
COMMUNITIES BUT I I WILL FOLLOW 
UP WITH JEN AND SEE IF SHE'S    

03:31:10.783 --> 03:31:12.717
COMMUNITIES BUT I I WILL FOLLOW 
UP WITH JEN AND SEE IF SHE'S    
INTERESTED IN BEING ABLE TO PUT 

03:31:12.719 --> 03:31:13.717
UP WITH JEN AND SEE IF SHE'S    
INTERESTED IN BEING ABLE TO PUT 
THEM ON TOP AND TO REFERENCE    

03:31:13.719 --> 03:31:14.385
INTERESTED IN BEING ABLE TO PUT 
THEM ON TOP AND TO REFERENCE    
THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC AND     

03:31:14.387 --> 03:31:17.120
THEM ON TOP AND TO REFERENCE    
THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC AND     
THEN IT'S EASY TO JUST HAVE A   

03:31:17.122 --> 03:31:17.754
THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC AND     
THEN IT'S EASY TO JUST HAVE A

WITH THE OLD WEST SIDE AND I    
THINK THERE IS SOME FEAR AROUND 

03:32:37.970 --> 03:32:38.702
WITH THE OLD WEST SIDE AND I    
THINK THERE IS SOME FEAR AROUND 
ANY MISMATCH BETWEEN UNDERLYING 

03:32:38.704 --> 03:32:41.638
THINK THERE IS SOME FEAR AROUND 
ANY MISMATCH BETWEEN UNDERLYING 
ZONING AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING 

03:32:41.640 --> 03:32:42.573
ANY MISMATCH BETWEEN UNDERLYING 
ZONING AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING 
AND THERE IS SOME OVERLAP IN    

03:32:42.575 --> 03:32:43.507
ZONING AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING 
AND THERE IS SOME OVERLAP IN    
THE OLD WEST SIDE WHERE WE ARE  

03:32:43.509 --> 03:32:46.409
AND THERE IS SOME OVERLAP IN    
THE OLD WEST SIDE WHERE WE ARE  
SAYING THAT IT CAN BE           

03:32:46.411 --> 03:32:46.844
THE OLD WEST SIDE WHERE WE ARE  
SAYING THAT IT CAN BE           
TRANSITION.                     

03:32:46.846 --> 03:32:48.946
SAYING THAT IT CAN BE           
TRANSITION.                     
AND SO I THINK THERE'S SOME     

03:32:48.948 --> 03:32:49.747
TRANSITION.                     
AND SO I THINK THERE'S SOME     
QUESTION ABOUT LIKE WHAT'S THE  

03:32:49.749 --> 03:32:53.049
AND SO I THINK THERE'S SOME     
QUESTION ABOUT LIKE WHAT'S THE  
PRECEDENT BEHIND THAT IF YOU    

03:32:53.051 --> 03:32:53.884
QUESTION ABOUT LIKE WHAT'S THE  
PRECEDENT BEHIND THAT IF YOU    
DON'T IF THE UNDERLYING ZONING  

03:32:53.886 --> 03:32:57.287
PRECEDENT BEHIND THAT IF YOU    
DON'T IF THE UNDERLYING ZONING  
NOW SAYS THAT IT CAN BE A       

03:32:57.289 --> 03:33:01.024
DON'T IF THE UNDERLYING ZONING  
NOW SAYS THAT IT CAN BE A       
CERTAIN HEIGHT, WHAT POSITION   

03:33:01.026 --> 03:33:02.126
NOW SAYS THAT IT CAN BE A       
CERTAIN HEIGHT, WHAT POSITION   
DOES THAT PUT LIKE THE DC IN    

03:33:02.128 --> 03:33:05.562
CERTAIN HEIGHT, WHAT POSITION   
DOES THAT PUT LIKE THE DC IN    
WHEN THEY HAVE FINAL SAY BUT    

03:33:05.564 --> 03:33:06.263
DOES THAT PUT LIKE THE DC IN    
WHEN THEY HAVE FINAL SAY BUT    
THEY ALSO HAVE YOU KNOW, THE    

03:33:06.265 --> 03:33:09.366
WHEN THEY HAVE FINAL SAY BUT    
THEY ALSO HAVE YOU KNOW, THE    
UNDERLYING ZONING AND THEIR OWN 

03:33:09.368 --> 03:33:10.033
THEY ALSO HAVE YOU KNOW, THE    
UNDERLYING ZONING AND THEIR OWN 
GUIDELINES LIKE THERE JUST      

03:33:10.035 --> 03:33:13.136
UNDERLYING ZONING AND THEIR OWN 
GUIDELINES LIKE THERE JUST      
ISN'T A TON OF PRECEDENT I      

03:33:13.138 --> 03:33:13.938
GUIDELINES LIKE THERE JUST      
ISN'T A TON OF PRECEDENT I      
THINK FOR THAT AND THAT WORRIES 

03:33:13.940 --> 03:33:16.206
ISN'T A TON OF PRECEDENT I      
THINK FOR THAT AND THAT WORRIES 
SOME PEOPLE IN THAT AREA THAT   

03:33:16.208 --> 03:33:20.710
THINK FOR THAT AND THAT WORRIES 
SOME PEOPLE IN THAT AREA THAT   
IN THAT AREA I I DON'T KNOW IF  

03:33:20.712 --> 03:33:21.478
SOME PEOPLE IN THAT AREA THAT   
IN THAT AREA I I DON'T KNOW IF  
I CALL PRECEDENT BUT AN EXAMPLE 

03:33:21.480 --> 03:33:24.414
IN THAT AREA I I DON'T KNOW IF  
I CALL PRECEDENT BUT AN EXAMPLE 
IS RECENTLY THERE WAS A LARGE   

03:33:24.416 --> 03:33:25.215
I CALL PRECEDENT BUT AN EXAMPLE 
IS RECENTLY THERE WAS A LARGE   
SCALE DEVELOPMENT JUST NORTH    

03:33:25.217 --> 03:33:28.452
IS RECENTLY THERE WAS A LARGE   
SCALE DEVELOPMENT JUST NORTH    
OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER THE     

03:33:28.454 --> 03:33:32.256
SCALE DEVELOPMENT JUST NORTH    
OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER THE     
LITERALLY THE HISTORIC DISTRICT

OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER THE     
LITERALLY THE HISTORIC DISTRICT 
BOUNDARY IS BASICALLY ALONG THE 

03:33:33.125 --> 03:33:36.626
LITERALLY THE HISTORIC DISTRICT 
BOUNDARY IS BASICALLY ALONG THE

BOUNDARY IS BASICALLY ALONG THE 
BACK OF THE BUILDINGS THAT      
FRONT LIBERTY.                  

03:33:37.029 --> 03:33:37.628
BACK OF THE BUILDINGS THAT

FRONT LIBERTY.                  
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE          
PROPERTIES ALONG WASHINGTON.    

03:33:40.166 --> 03:33:41.231
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE          
PROPERTIES ALONG WASHINGTON.    
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY IN IN THAT  

03:33:41.233 --> 03:33:41.965
PROPERTIES ALONG WASHINGTON.    
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY IN IN THAT  
DEVELOPMENT THERE'S ACTUALLY    

03:33:41.967 --> 03:33:44.468
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY IN IN THAT  
DEVELOPMENT THERE'S ACTUALLY    
TWO BUILDINGS AS PART OF THAT   

03:33:44.470 --> 03:33:44.869
DEVELOPMENT THERE'S ACTUALLY    
TWO BUILDINGS AS PART OF THAT   
DEVELOPMENT.                    

03:33:44.871 --> 03:33:45.736
TWO BUILDINGS AS PART OF THAT   
DEVELOPMENT.                    
THERE'S A SMALLER BUILDING THAT 

03:33:45.738 --> 03:33:48.338
DEVELOPMENT.                    
THERE'S A SMALLER BUILDING THAT 
IS ACCESSED BASICALLY ONLY OFF  

03:33:48.340 --> 03:33:49.206
THERE'S A SMALLER BUILDING THAT 
IS ACCESSED BASICALLY ONLY OFF  
OF THE ALLEY AND THEN THERE'S   

03:33:49.208 --> 03:33:51.942
IS ACCESSED BASICALLY ONLY OFF  
OF THE ALLEY AND THEN THERE'S   
THE LARGER BUILDING.            

03:33:51.944 --> 03:33:53.176
OF THE ALLEY AND THEN THERE'S   
THE LARGER BUILDING.            
I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS AN     

03:33:53.178 --> 03:33:53.978
THE LARGER BUILDING.            
I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS AN     
EXAMPLE WHERE THAT BUILDING IN  

03:33:53.980 --> 03:33:56.346
I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS AN     
EXAMPLE WHERE THAT BUILDING IN  
THE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESPITE   

03:33:56.348 --> 03:33:59.983
EXAMPLE WHERE THAT BUILDING IN  
THE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESPITE   
SIMILAR ZONING FOR BOTH OF THEM 

03:33:59.985 --> 03:34:00.918
THE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESPITE   
SIMILAR ZONING FOR BOTH OF THEM 
HAPPENED AT A DIFFERENT OUTCOME 

03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:03.153
SIMILAR ZONING FOR BOTH OF THEM 
HAPPENED AT A DIFFERENT OUTCOME 
BECAUSE OF THE CONVERGENCE      

03:34:03.155 --> 03:34:03.954
HAPPENED AT A DIFFERENT OUTCOME 
BECAUSE OF THE CONVERGENCE      
OF BOTH ZONING AND HISTORIC     

03:34:03.956 --> 03:34:07.624
BECAUSE OF THE CONVERGENCE      
OF BOTH ZONING AND HISTORIC     
DISTRICT REGULATIONS, WHICH IS  

03:34:07.626 --> 03:34:08.558
OF BOTH ZONING AND HISTORIC     
DISTRICT REGULATIONS, WHICH IS  
ALWAYS THE CASE UNLESS THE THE

03:34:15.668 --> 03:34:19.736
HISTORIC DISTRICT ZONING IS OR  
DESIGNATION IS REMOVED.         
AND SO THE THE LAND USE         

03:34:19.738 --> 03:34:20.404
DESIGNATION IS REMOVED.         
AND SO THE THE LAND USE         
IMAGINES WHAT THAT LAND WOULD   

03:34:20.406 --> 03:34:23.974
AND SO THE THE LAND USE         
IMAGINES WHAT THAT LAND WOULD   
BE IF THERE WASN'T A HISTORIC   

03:34:23.976 --> 03:34:27.845
IMAGINES WHAT THAT LAND WOULD   
BE IF THERE WASN'T A HISTORIC   
DISTRICT THERE AND THAT WAS HOW 

03:34:27.847 --> 03:34:32.082
BE IF THERE WASN'T A HISTORIC   
DISTRICT THERE AND THAT WAS HOW 
WE DREW ON THE MAP AND IT IS    

03:34:32.084 --> 03:34:35.686
DISTRICT THERE AND THAT WAS HOW 
WE DREW ON THE MAP AND IT IS    
NOW RESTRICTED BY THE HISTORIC

DISTRICT DESIGNATION WHICH      
WOULD REQUIRE A VOTE OF COUNCIL 
AND THEN A VOTE OF THE

THE USE OF THE TERM RESILIENCE

I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT MR.   
GERBER'S CONCERNED ABOUT AND    

03:58:57.014 --> 03:58:59.781
I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT MR.   
GERBER'S CONCERNED ABOUT AND    
I'M THINKING LIKE AN ACADEMIC   

03:58:59.783 --> 03:59:00.549
GERBER'S CONCERNED ABOUT AND    
I'M THINKING LIKE AN ACADEMIC   
ACADEMICS DEBATE ALL THE TIME   

03:59:00.551 --> 03:59:01.417
I'M THINKING LIKE AN ACADEMIC   
ACADEMICS DEBATE ALL THE TIME   
OVER THE USE OF TERMS AND THEY  

03:59:01.419 --> 03:59:03.753
ACADEMICS DEBATE ALL THE TIME   
OVER THE USE OF TERMS AND THEY  
CAN ALWAYS FIND OUT REASONS FOR 

03:59:03.755 --> 03:59:04.986
OVER THE USE OF TERMS AND THEY  
CAN ALWAYS FIND OUT REASONS FOR 
WHY THIS IS A BAD TERM AND IT   

03:59:04.988 --> 03:59:05.721
CAN ALWAYS FIND OUT REASONS FOR 
WHY THIS IS A BAD TERM AND IT   
DOESN'T DO THAT AND YOU CAN     

03:59:05.723 --> 03:59:07.889
WHY THIS IS A BAD TERM AND IT   
DOESN'T DO THAT AND YOU CAN     
KIND OF GO IN CIRCLES.          

03:59:07.891 --> 03:59:08.857
DOESN'T DO THAT AND YOU CAN     
KIND OF GO IN CIRCLES.          
SO I'M A LITTLE LESS TROUBLED   

03:59:08.859 --> 03:59:09.525
KIND OF GO IN CIRCLES.          
SO I'M A LITTLE LESS TROUBLED   
THAT WE'RE USING THAT TERM      

03:59:09.527 --> 03:59:12.061
SO I'M A LITTLE LESS TROUBLED   
THAT WE'RE USING THAT TERM      
RESILIENCE MAYBE TOO MUCH.      

03:59:12.063 --> 03:59:13.129
THAT WE'RE USING THAT TERM      
RESILIENCE MAYBE TOO MUCH.      
THE THING THAT I STRUGGLE WITH  

03:59:13.131 --> 03:59:16.298
RESILIENCE MAYBE TOO MUCH.      
THE THING THAT I STRUGGLE WITH  
IS IS I UNDERSTAND AS WE'VE HAD 

03:59:16.300 --> 03:59:17.033
THE THING THAT I STRUGGLE WITH  
IS IS I UNDERSTAND AS WE'VE HAD 
CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST SOME  

03:59:17.035 --> 03:59:19.368
IS IS I UNDERSTAND AS WE'VE HAD 
CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST SOME  
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE BEING  

03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:20.102
CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST SOME  
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE BEING  
ASKED TO REQUIRE THROUGH THE    

03:59:20.104 --> 03:59:20.770
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE BEING  
ASKED TO REQUIRE THROUGH THE    
PLAN WE CAN'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE  

03:59:20.772 --> 03:59:23.105
ASKED TO REQUIRE THROUGH THE    
PLAN WE CAN'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE  
BECAUSE OF STATE LAW.           

03:59:23.107 --> 03:59:23.505
PLAN WE CAN'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE  
BECAUSE OF STATE LAW.           
CORRECT.                        

03:59:23.507 --> 03:59:24.440
BECAUSE OF STATE LAW.           
CORRECT.                        
AND SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO       

03:59:24.442 --> 03:59:27.042
CORRECT.

OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS          
SPECIFICALLY JUST WHAT HAPPENS  
AT THAT POINT WHETHER IT'S

AT THAT POINT WHETHER IT'S      
SUBSTATION ELECTRIC CAPACITY OR 
AND IT'S THAT ONE LIKE IT'S AT

SUBSTATION ELECTRIC CAPACITY OR 
AND IT'S THAT ONE LIKE IT'S AT  
CAPACITY AND THAT NEXT          

04:15:42.185 --> 04:15:42.851
AND IT'S THAT ONE LIKE IT'S AT  
CAPACITY AND THAT NEXT          
DEVELOPER COMES AND SAYS HEY,   

04:15:42.853 --> 04:15:45.252
CAPACITY AND THAT NEXT          
DEVELOPER COMES AND SAYS HEY,   
I'D LIKE TO DO THIS AND YOU'RE  

04:15:45.254 --> 04:15:45.887

I'D LIKE TO DO THIS AND YOU'RE  
LIKE ACTUALLY WE DON'T HAVE     
THAT.

LIKE ACTUALLY WE DON'T HAVE     
THAT.                           
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT    

04:15:49.192 --> 04:15:53.061
THAT.                           
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT    
INCREMENTAL MOMENT SO THAT'S A  

04:15:53.063 --> 04:15:54.161
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT    
INCREMENTAL MOMENT SO THAT'S A  
BIG QUESTION AND A LOT OF A LOT 

04:15:54.163 --> 04:15:56.998
INCREMENTAL MOMENT SO THAT'S A  
BIG QUESTION AND A LOT OF A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 

04:15:57.000 --> 04:15:58.265
BIG QUESTION AND A LOT OF A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 
>> BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE  

04:15:58.267 --> 04:16:01.169
OF DIFFERENT THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 
>> BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE  
MAP THIS OUT IS WE MAPPED OUT   

04:16:01.171 --> 04:16:01.836
>> BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE  
MAP THIS OUT IS WE MAPPED OUT   
WHERE WE THOUGHT THERE WAS      

04:16:01.838 --> 04:16:02.303
MAP THIS OUT IS WE MAPPED OUT   
WHERE WE THOUGHT THERE WAS      
POTENTIAL.                      

04:16:02.305 --> 04:16:05.439
WHERE WE THOUGHT THERE WAS      
POTENTIAL.                      
SO FOR EXAMPLE AND A LOT        

04:16:05.441 --> 04:16:06.107
POTENTIAL.                      
SO FOR EXAMPLE AND A LOT        
OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS WENT IN    

04:16:06.109 --> 04:16:08.576
SO FOR EXAMPLE AND A LOT        
OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS WENT IN    
TALKING TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE   

04:16:08.578 --> 04:16:11.846
OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS WENT IN    
TALKING TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE   
SPECIALIST SPECIALIST           

04:16:11.848 --> 04:16:12.413
TALKING TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE   
SPECIALIST SPECIALIST           
CONVERTING A SIGNIFICANT

INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS   

04:16:17.287 --> 04:16:20.388
FAMILY TO TRY THE               
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS   
IS REALLY IT'S APPROPRIATE TO   

04:16:20.390 --> 04:16:20.788
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS   
IS REALLY IT'S APPROPRIATE TO   
HANDLE THAT.                    

04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:23.458
IS REALLY IT'S APPROPRIATE TO   
HANDLE THAT.                    
AND SO WHEN WE MAKE THE         

04:16:23.460 --> 04:16:24.191
HANDLE THAT.                    
AND SO WHEN WE MAKE THE         
REGULATORY CHANGES THAT START   

04:16:24.193 --> 04:16:27.294
AND SO WHEN WE MAKE THE         
REGULATORY CHANGES THAT START   
DOING THAT, WE WILL LOOK AT     

04:16:27.296 --> 04:16:27.996
REGULATORY CHANGES THAT START   
DOING THAT, WE WILL LOOK AT     
THAT AS PART OF THAT.           

04:16:27.998 --> 04:16:31.165
DOING THAT, WE WILL LOOK AT     
THAT AS PART OF THAT.           
ON THE FLIP SIDE, IF WE HAVE    

04:16:31.167 --> 04:16:32.032
THAT AS PART OF THAT.           
ON THE FLIP SIDE, IF WE HAVE    
IDENTIFIED MAYBE SOME AREA AS A

HUB AND BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT 
THAT'S HAPPENING OUT OF AN      
INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE, WE  

04:16:39.375 --> 04:16:40.141
THAT'S HAPPENING OUT OF AN      
INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE, WE  
FIND OUT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE   

04:16:40.143 --> 04:16:42.977
INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE, WE  
FIND OUT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE   
SOME INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT  

04:16:42.979 --> 04:16:43.878
FIND OUT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE   
SOME INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT  
PRIOR TO BEING ABLE TO REALIZE  

04:16:43.880 --> 04:16:44.679
SOME INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT

SO COULD I TAKE A LOOK AT A TAX 
INCREMENT FINANCING TO HELP ME  
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE         

04:20:51.061 --> 04:20:51.392
INCREMENT FINANCING TO HELP ME  
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE         
UPGRADES?                       

04:20:51.394 --> 04:20:52.126
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE         
UPGRADES?                       
THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT WAYS TO  

04:20:52.128 --> 04:20:53.594

THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT WAYS TO  
TACKLE IT BUT I DON'T THINK     
THERE'S A POINT IN WHICH THE    

04:20:56.733 --> 04:20:57.631
TACKLE IT BUT I DON'T THINK     
THERE'S A POINT IN WHICH THE    
CHANGING OF ZONING RESULTS IN   

04:20:57.633 --> 04:21:01.268
THERE'S A POINT IN WHICH THE    
CHANGING OF ZONING RESULTS IN   
THIS TOTAL KIND OF LIKE         

04:21:01.270 --> 04:21:01.836
CHANGING OF ZONING RESULTS IN   
THIS TOTAL KIND OF LIKE         
CATASTROPHIC LOADING

CATASTROPHIC LOADING            
OF INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE IT'S  
DONE AT A PROJECT BY PROJECT.   

04:21:05.842 --> 04:21:06.441
OF INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE IT'S  
DONE AT A PROJECT BY PROJECT.   
EACH DEVELOPER HAS TO GO

04:21:10.079 --> 04:21:13.147
THROUGH THAT PROCESS.           
SO I JUST WANTED TO TALK ABOUT  
THAT INCREMENTAL PROCESS LIKE   

04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.881
SO I JUST WANTED TO TALK ABOUT  
THAT INCREMENTAL PROCESS LIKE   
WHEN SOMEBODY SUBMITS CITY      

04:21:13.883 --> 04:21:17.851
THAT INCREMENTAL PROCESS LIKE   
WHEN SOMEBODY SUBMITS CITY      
STAFF REVIEWS IT AND SO LIKE IN 

04:21:17.853 --> 04:21:21.856
WHEN SOMEBODY SUBMITS CITY      
STAFF REVIEWS IT AND SO LIKE IN

04:21:21.858 --> 04:21:22.790
STAFF REVIEWS IT AND SO LIKE IN 
THE ACTUAL CHANGES ARE          
PROFFERED HERE IS ABOUT ADDING  

04:21:22.792 --> 04:21:25.259
THE ACTUAL CHANGES ARE          
PROFFERED HERE IS ABOUT ADDING  
TO PAGE ONE THIRTY.             

04:21:25.261 --> 04:21:26.260
PROFFERED HERE IS ABOUT ADDING  
TO PAGE ONE THIRTY.

04:21:28.898 --> 04:21:29.564
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE VISION   
FOR A PARTICULAR AREA           
NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT MAY    

04:21:29.566 --> 04:21:30.297
FOR A PARTICULAR AREA           
NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT MAY    
NEED TO BE DELAYED UNTIL THE    

04:21:30.299 --> 04:21:32.967
NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT MAY    
NEED TO BE DELAYED UNTIL THE    
LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE'S UPGRADED 

04:21:32.969 --> 04:21:33.167
NEED TO BE DELAYED UNTIL THE    
LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE'S UPGRADED 
.                               

04:21:33.169 --> 04:21:34.301
LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE'S UPGRADED 
.                               
THAT'S AN ENTIRELY FAIR I THINK 

04:21:34.303 --> 04:21:37.404
.                               
THAT'S AN ENTIRELY FAIR I THINK 
ASSESSMENT THE QUESTION IS      

04:21:37.406 --> 04:21:40.808
THAT'S AN ENTIRELY FAIR I THINK 
ASSESSMENT THE QUESTION IS      
WHETHER THAT ACKNOWLEDGMENT IS  

04:21:40.810 --> 04:21:45.479
ASSESSMENT THE QUESTION IS      
WHETHER THAT ACKNOWLEDGMENT IS

04:21:48.117 --> 04:21:48.916
I SUPPOSE LIKE DOES TO ADD A    
LEVEL OF COMFORT RELATIVE TO    
WHAT'S ITS ACTUAL UTILITY       

04:21:48.918 --> 04:21:53.120
LEVEL OF COMFORT RELATIVE TO    
WHAT'S ITS ACTUAL UTILITY       
BECAUSE TO ME I'M LIKE YEAH, IT 

04:21:53.122 --> 04:21:53.654
WHAT'S ITS ACTUAL UTILITY       
BECAUSE TO ME I'M LIKE YEAH, IT 
IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE.         

04:21:53.656 --> 04:21:56.457
BECAUSE TO ME I'M LIKE YEAH, IT 
IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE.         
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY  

04:21:56.459 --> 04:22:00.160
IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE.         
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY  
FAIR STATEMENT.                 

04:22:00.162 --> 04:22:01.295
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY

THINGS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY   
CARRY MEANINGS OR CARRY         
SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT.             

04:22:09.005 --> 04:22:12.573
CARRY MEANINGS OR CARRY         
SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT.             
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT I     

04:22:12.575 --> 04:22:13.007
SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT.

THINK A LOT OF FOLKS THAT HAD   
CONCERNS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE,  

04:22:20.282 --> 04:22:20.981
THINK A LOT OF FOLKS THAT HAD   
CONCERNS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE,  
A PROJECT BY PROJECT LEVEL      

04:22:20.983 --> 04:22:21.582
CONCERNS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE,  
A PROJECT BY PROJECT LEVEL      
THERE'S A VERY THOROUGH

A PROJECT BY PROJECT LEVEL      
THERE'S A VERY THOROUGH         
ANALYSIS THAT OCCURS AND        

04:22:24.286 --> 04:22:25.219

PAY TO UPGRADE IT ESSENTIALLY   

04:22:31.994 --> 04:22:32.626
KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO    
PAY TO UPGRADE IT ESSENTIALLY   
IS AND THEN WE HAVE A           

04:22:32.628 --> 04:22:35.462
PAY TO UPGRADE IT ESSENTIALLY   
IS AND THEN WE HAVE A           
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT DOES THIS 

04:22:35.464 --> 04:22:36.297
IS AND THEN WE HAVE A

PAUSES BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S THAT  

04:22:59.956 --> 04:23:03.357
ALIGNMENT CAUSING POTENTIAL     
PAUSES BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S THAT  
THAT'S JUST KIND OF A FACT

THIS WAS A PUBLIC COMMENT.      
WE GOT FLAGGED THAT THERE ARE   
FIVE OR SIX WHAT I'M GOING TO

04:23:51.774 --> 04:23:54.375
FIVE OR SIX WHAT I'M GOING TO   
CALL RESIDENTIAL SLIVERS.       
THEY LOOK ALMOST AS WIDE AS A   

04:23:54.377 --> 04:23:58.178
CALL RESIDENTIAL SLIVERS.       
THEY LOOK ALMOST AS WIDE AS A   
ROAD THAT STARTS FROM WHERE A   

04:23:58.180 --> 04:23:58.879
THEY LOOK ALMOST AS WIDE AS A   
ROAD THAT STARTS FROM WHERE A   
PACKARD INTERFACES WITH WHAT    

04:23:58.881 --> 04:24:01.482
ROAD THAT STARTS FROM WHERE A   
PACKARD INTERFACES WITH WHAT    
APPEARS TO BE STADIUM.          

04:24:01.484 --> 04:24:02.416
PACKARD INTERFACES WITH WHAT    
APPEARS TO BE STADIUM.          
THERE'S A LITTLE STRIP THERE    

04:24:02.418 --> 04:24:03.150
APPEARS TO BE STADIUM.          
THERE'S A LITTLE STRIP THERE    
AND THEN THERE'S A FEW MORE     

04:24:03.152 --> 04:24:05.753
THERE'S A LITTLE STRIP THERE    
AND THEN THERE'S A FEW MORE     
STRIPS THAT YOU'LL SEE AS YOU   

04:24:05.755 --> 04:24:06.420
AND THEN THERE'S A FEW MORE     
STRIPS THAT YOU'LL SEE AS YOU   
VISUALLY TRACK DOWN PACARD      

04:24:06.422 --> 04:24:06.954
STRIPS THAT YOU'LL SEE AS YOU   
VISUALLY TRACK DOWN PACARD

VISUALLY TRACK DOWN PACARD      
STREET.                         
THEY'RE LITERALLY LIKE IN SOME

THEY'RE LITERALLY LIKE IN SOME  
CASES SIDE OF THE ROAD.         
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT     

04:24:10.994 --> 04:24:13.394
CASES SIDE OF THE ROAD.         
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT     
IT'S GOING TO TRIGGER TAPERING  

04:24:13.396 --> 04:24:14.262
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT     
IT'S GOING TO TRIGGER TAPERING  
FOR ALL OF THE TRANSITION IF    

04:24:14.264 --> 04:24:17.431
IT'S GOING TO TRIGGER TAPERING  
FOR ALL OF THE TRANSITION IF    
YOU'VE GOT LIKE A LITTLE TINY   

04:24:17.433 --> 04:24:18.099
FOR ALL OF THE TRANSITION IF    
YOU'VE GOT LIKE A LITTLE TINY   
STRIP OF RESIDENTIAL THERE      

04:24:18.101 --> 04:24:18.899
YOU'VE GOT LIKE A LITTLE TINY   
STRIP OF RESIDENTIAL THERE      
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE MAYBE IT   

04:24:18.901 --> 04:24:21.435
STRIP OF RESIDENTIAL THERE      
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE MAYBE IT   
BUTTS UP AGAINST OTHER          

04:24:21.437 --> 04:24:22.303
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE MAYBE IT   
BUTTS UP AGAINST OTHER          
TRANSITION OR SOMETHING ELSE ON 

04:24:22.305 --> 04:24:24.505
BUTTS UP AGAINST OTHER          
TRANSITION OR SOMETHING ELSE ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF THERE'S 

04:24:24.507 --> 04:24:25.372
TRANSITION OR SOMETHING ELSE ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF THERE'S 
STRIP OF RESIDENTIAL AND WE     

04:24:25.374 --> 04:24:25.973
THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF THERE'S 
STRIP OF RESIDENTIAL AND WE     
TAPER OFF A RESIDENTIAL         

04:24:25.975 --> 04:24:29.476
STRIP OF RESIDENTIAL AND WE     
TAPER OFF A RESIDENTIAL         
PROXIMITY, THEN IT'S GOING TO   

04:24:29.478 --> 04:24:30.210
TAPER OFF A RESIDENTIAL         
PROXIMITY, THEN IT'S GOING TO   
AUTOMATICALLY WHACK ALL THAT    

04:24:30.212 --> 04:24:30.945
PROXIMITY, THEN IT'S GOING TO   
AUTOMATICALLY WHACK ALL THAT    
STUFF DOWN TO THREE STORIES     

04:24:30.947 --> 04:24:32.913
AUTOMATICALLY WHACK ALL THAT    
STUFF DOWN TO THREE STORIES     
WHEN IT PROBABLY DOESN'T NEED   

04:24:32.915 --> 04:24:33.881
STUFF DOWN TO THREE STORIES     
WHEN IT PROBABLY DOESN'T NEED   
TO BE AND I CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL 

04:24:33.883 --> 04:24:34.415
WHEN IT PROBABLY DOESN'T NEED   
TO BE AND I CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL 
IF THOSE SLIVERS WERE           

04:24:34.417 --> 04:24:40.388
TO BE AND I CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL 
IF THOSE SLIVERS WERE           
INTENTIONAL                     

04:24:41.657 --> 04:24:43.724
            MIGHT ACTUALLY BE   
GOOD REASONS FOR THOSE SLIVERS  
TO BE THERE AND THAT'S WHAT I   

04:24:43.726 --> 04:24:44.925
GOOD REASONS FOR THOSE SLIVERS  
TO BE THERE AND THAT'S WHAT I   
CAN'T SCRUTINIZE.               

04:24:44.927 --> 04:24:45.859
TO BE THERE AND THAT'S WHAT I   
CAN'T SCRUTINIZE.               
SO IF THEY'RE SCRIVNER ERRORS   

04:24:45.861 --> 04:24:46.627
CAN'T SCRUTINIZE.               
SO IF THEY'RE SCRIVNER ERRORS   
LIKE MEANING IT'S A PRODUCT     

04:24:46.629 --> 04:24:49.263
SO IF THEY'RE SCRIVNER ERRORS   
LIKE MEANING IT'S A PRODUCT     
OF THE STAFF GETTING MORE FINE  

04:24:49.265 --> 04:24:50.097
LIKE MEANING IT'S A PRODUCT     
OF THE STAFF GETTING MORE FINE  
OR THE MAP GETTING MORE FINE    

04:24:50.099 --> 04:24:53.267
OF THE STAFF GETTING MORE FINE  
OR THE MAP GETTING MORE FINE    
GRAINED THAN FINE LEAVING THEM  

04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.968
OR THE MAP GETTING MORE FINE    
GRAINED THAN FINE LEAVING THEM  
IN IF THEY'RE INTENTIONAL.      

04:24:53.970 --> 04:24:56.570
GRAINED THAN FINE LEAVING THEM  
IN IF THEY'RE INTENTIONAL.      
BUT IF THEY'RE ERRORS I JUST    

04:24:56.572 --> 04:24:57.504
IN IF THEY'RE INTENTIONAL.      
BUT IF THEY'RE ERRORS I JUST

IT'S HARD FOR US TO UNDERSTAND  
WHY THE TRANSITION ZONING MUST  

04:29:05.455 --> 04:29:09.256
IT'S HARD FOR US TO UNDERSTAND  
WHY THE TRANSITION ZONING MUST  
REMAIN THERE WHEN IT CAN'T BE   

04:29:09.258 --> 04:29:10.057
WHY THE TRANSITION ZONING MUST  
REMAIN THERE WHEN IT CAN'T BE   
ENACTED GIVEN THE HISTORIC      

04:29:10.059 --> 04:29:13.460
REMAIN THERE WHEN IT CAN'T BE   
ENACTED GIVEN THE HISTORIC      
DISTRICT GUIDELINES AND WHY WE  

04:29:13.462 --> 04:29:17.330
ENACTED GIVEN THE HISTORIC      
DISTRICT GUIDELINES AND WHY WE  
CAN'T MAKE THE ACTUAL LAND USE  

04:29:17.332 --> 04:29:20.767
DISTRICT GUIDELINES AND WHY WE  
CAN'T MAKE THE ACTUAL LAND USE  
BE REFLECTED IN THE UNDERLYING

STRUGGLING WITH.                
IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY     
WE'RE REMAINING COMMITTED TO A  

04:29:29.211 --> 04:29:32.612
IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY     
WE'RE REMAINING COMMITTED TO A

04:29:32.614 --> 04:29:36.583
WE'RE REMAINING COMMITTED TO A
