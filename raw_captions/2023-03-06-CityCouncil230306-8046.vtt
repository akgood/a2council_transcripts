TWENTY NINETEEN I BELIEVE IT IS 

00:28:05.046 --> 00:28:06.012
REGARDING THIS PROJECT FROM     
TWENTY NINETEEN I BELIEVE IT IS 
AT WHICH POINT THE SIDEWALK WAS

TWENTY NINETEEN I BELIEVE IT IS 
AT WHICH POINT THE SIDEWALK WAS 
NOT EVEN A FACTOR AND YOU SAY

AT WHICH POINT THE SIDEWALK WAS 
NOT EVEN A FACTOR AND YOU SAY

NOT EVEN A FACTOR AND YOU SAY

00:28:20.695 --> 00:28:23.930
SO THAT&apos;S A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT

THERE&apos;S PLENTY OF AREA IN THE   

00:28:23.932 --> 00:28:28.634
ON THE BEHALF OF THE CITY.      
THERE&apos;S PLENTY OF AREA IN THE   
THE EXISTING ROADWAY TO PUT IN  

00:28:28.636 --> 00:28:29.369
THERE&apos;S PLENTY OF AREA IN THE   
THE EXISTING ROADWAY TO PUT IN  
TWO LANES OF ROAD TO BIKE LANES 

00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:32.038
THE EXISTING ROADWAY TO PUT IN  
TWO LANES OF ROAD TO BIKE LANES

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.308
TWO LANES OF ROAD TO BIKE LANES 
AND IF YOU MUST HAVE A SIDEWALK 
PUT IT IN THE EXISTING AREA.

THE WAY THAT OUR GOVERNOR SAYS  
THINGS MOVE THE DAM CURB IF YOU 
MUST HAVE A SIDEWALK DON&apos;T      

00:28:44.385 --> 00:28:48.054
THINGS MOVE THE DAM CURB IF YOU 
MUST HAVE A SIDEWALK DON&apos;T      
IMPOSE ON THE RESIDENTS OF OUR
