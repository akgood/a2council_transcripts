SOLUTION, A BINDING SOLUTION TO 
TRY TO MOVE SOME OF THAT WORK   
FORWARD.                        

00:45:40.924 --> 00:45:43.859
TRY TO MOVE SOME OF THAT WORK   
FORWARD.                        
SO THIS ACTUALLY IS ONE HUNDRED 

00:45:43.861 --> 00:45:47.696
FORWARD.                        
SO THIS ACTUALLY IS ONE HUNDRED 
AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT 

00:45:47.698 --> 00:45:48.364
SO THIS ACTUALLY IS ONE HUNDRED 
AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT 
WE COULD BE SPENDING            

00:45:48.366 --> 00:45:52.034
AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT 
WE COULD BE SPENDING            
UNILLUMINATING CROSSWALKS, AN   

00:45:52.036 --> 00:45:52.701
WE COULD BE SPENDING            
UNILLUMINATING CROSSWALKS, AN   
ALREADY APPROVED PROJECT.       

00:45:52.703 --> 00:45:53.502
UNILLUMINATING CROSSWALKS, AN   
ALREADY APPROVED PROJECT.       
BUT INSTEAD WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO      

00:45:53.504 --> 00:45:56.371
ALREADY APPROVED PROJECT.       
BUT INSTEAD WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO      
STUDY WHETHER WE SHOULD TAKE    

00:45:56.373 --> 00:46:03.012
BUT INSTEAD WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO      
STUDY WHETHER WE SHOULD TAKE    
OVER THE STATE TRUNK LINE AND   

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.794
                              I 
THINK IF YOU ASK ANYONE CAN WE  
AFFORD TO TAKE OVER THE STATE   

00:46:18.796 --> 00:46:19.595
THINK IF YOU ASK ANYONE CAN WE  
AFFORD TO TAKE OVER THE STATE   
TRUNK LINES GIVEN THE CONDITION 

00:46:19.597 --> 00:46:20.095
AFFORD TO TAKE OVER THE STATE   
TRUNK LINES GIVEN THE CONDITION 
OF OUR ROADS THEY WOULD         

00:46:20.097 --> 00:46:20.629
TRUNK LINES GIVEN THE CONDITION 
OF OUR ROADS THEY WOULD         
PROBABLY SAY NO.                

00:46:20.631 --> 00:46:21.430
OF OUR ROADS THEY WOULD         
PROBABLY SAY NO.                
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I KNOW THAT WE&amp;apos;RE MOVING  

00:46:21.432 --> 00:46:22.064
PROBABLY SAY NO.                
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I KNOW THAT WE&amp;apos;RE MOVING  
FORWARD WITH THIS BUT THIS      

00:46:22.066 --> 00:46:22.765
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I KNOW THAT WE&amp;apos;RE MOVING  
FORWARD WITH THIS BUT THIS      
BRINGS ME BACK TO THE OTHER     

00:46:22.767 --> 00:46:23.098

IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S NOT THAT THAT WE      

01:13:16.112 --> 01:13:17.110

IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S NOT THAT THAT WE      
SUDDENLY RAN OUT OF MONEY TO DO 
THE PROJECT.                    

01:13:19.948 --> 01:13:20.981
SUDDENLY RAN OUT OF MONEY TO DO

NINETY THREE PERCENT OVER THE   
CITY&amp;apos;S ESTIMATE.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.095
CITY&amp;apos;S ESTIMATE.                
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT

DOWNTOWN AREAS.                 
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE DID A STUDY   
TO WRITE AND WE WE HAVE REALLY  

01:36:14.389 --> 01:36:18.891

TO WRITE AND WE WE HAVE REALLY  
MILLIONS OF UNDEVELOPED SQUARE  

01:36:18.893 --> 01:36:19.725
TO WRITE AND WE WE HAVE REALLY  
MILLIONS OF UNDEVELOPED SQUARE  
FEET IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA THAT  

01:36:19.727 --> 01:36:22.060
MILLIONS OF UNDEVELOPED SQUARE

JUST WAITING WITH POTENTIAL AND 

01:36:22.062 --> 01:36:23.128
FEET IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA THAT  
JUST WAITING WITH POTENTIAL AND 
REALLY I WOULD LOVE IT IF WE

OF COURSE IT MAKES A LITTLE     
MORE MONEY FOR THE DEVELOPERS

OF COURSE IT MAKES A LITTLE     
MORE MONEY FOR THE DEVELOPERS

02:36:26.397 --> 02:36:30.232
THOSE RATES OF TRANSMISSION ARE 
.                               
SO WE&amp;apos;VE MADE IT A LITTLE BIT   

02:36:30.234 --> 02:36:30.566
.                               
SO WE&amp;apos;VE MADE IT A LITTLE BIT   
STRICTER.                       

02:36:30.568 --> 02:36:31.300
SO WE&amp;apos;VE MADE IT A LITTLE BIT   
STRICTER.                       
I THINK THERE WAS ALSO A        

02:36:31.302 --> 02:36:33.769
STRICTER.                       
I THINK THERE WAS ALSO A        
REACTION WHICH DOESN&amp;apos;T ANSWER   

02:36:33.771 --> 02:36:34.703
I THINK THERE WAS ALSO A        
REACTION WHICH DOESN&amp;apos;T ANSWER   
YOUR QUESTION BUT BUT GOES A    

02:36:34.705 --> 02:36:35.371
REACTION WHICH DOESN&amp;apos;T ANSWER   
YOUR QUESTION BUT BUT GOES A    
STEP FURTHER THAT THERE ARE     

02:36:35.373 --> 02:36:38.273
YOUR QUESTION BUT BUT GOES A    
STEP FURTHER THAT THERE ARE     
SOME ASPECTS OF DISTANCING THAT 

02:36:38.275 --> 02:36:40.809
STEP FURTHER THAT THERE ARE     
SOME ASPECTS OF DISTANCING THAT 
ARE NO LONGER UNDER CDC         

02:36:40.811 --> 02:36:41.243
SOME ASPECTS OF DISTANCING THAT

SO THE WAY WE HAVE THESE        
BARRIERS AND COUNCIL JAIL AND   

02:36:45.516 --> 02:36:49.651

IT A LITTLE LESS CONFUSING FOR  
THE PUBLIC TO BE MORE IN LINE   
WITH FEDERAL GUIDELINES.        

02:37:28.893 --> 02:37:31.560
THE PUBLIC TO BE MORE IN LINE   
WITH FEDERAL GUIDELINES.        
AND I THINK IT&amp;apos;S ALSO IMPORTANT 

02:37:31.562 --> 02:37:32.361
WITH FEDERAL GUIDELINES.        
AND I THINK IT&amp;apos;S ALSO IMPORTANT 
TO REMEMBER THAT THE CDC HAS    

02:37:32.363 --> 02:37:35.831
AND I THINK IT&amp;apos;S ALSO IMPORTANT 
TO REMEMBER THAT THE CDC HAS    
BEEN ALL OVER THE MAP AND IT    

02:37:35.833 --> 02:37:36.698
TO REMEMBER THAT THE CDC HAS    
BEEN ALL OVER THE MAP AND IT    
WAS CALLED A NOVEL VIRUS FOR A  

02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:40.168
BEEN ALL OVER THE MAP AND IT    
WAS CALLED A NOVEL VIRUS FOR A  
REASON THAT YOU KNOW, WE DIDN&amp;apos;T 

02:37:40.170 --> 02:37:40.936
WAS CALLED A NOVEL VIRUS FOR A  
REASON THAT YOU KNOW, WE DIDN&amp;apos;T 
KNOW WHEN THINGS FIRST CAME OUT 

02:37:40.938 --> 02:37:43.138
REASON THAT YOU KNOW, WE DIDN&amp;apos;T 
KNOW WHEN THINGS FIRST CAME OUT 
AND THAT WERE CONSTANT LEARNING 

02:37:43.140 --> 02:37:43.905
KNOW WHEN THINGS FIRST CAME OUT 
AND THAT WERE CONSTANT LEARNING 
AND EVOLVING AND SOMETIMES I    

02:37:43.907 --> 02:37:47.309
AND THAT WERE CONSTANT LEARNING 
AND EVOLVING AND SOMETIMES I    
THINK WE GET IT RIGHT OR THEN   

02:37:47.311 --> 02:37:47.910
AND EVOLVING AND SOMETIMES I    
THINK WE GET IT RIGHT OR THEN   
WE GET IT WRONG.                

02:37:47.912 --> 02:37:49.044
THINK WE GET IT RIGHT OR THEN   
WE GET IT WRONG.                
BUT BUT THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF WHAT THE 

02:37:49.046 --> 02:37:50.846
WE GET IT WRONG.                
BUT BUT THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF WHAT THE 
SCIENTIFIC PROCESS IS, RIGHT?   

02:37:50.848 --> 02:37:54.549
BUT BUT THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF WHAT THE 
SCIENTIFIC PROCESS IS, RIGHT?   
YOU YOU LEARN AND YOU ADJUST    

02:37:54.551 --> 02:37:55.584
SCIENTIFIC PROCESS IS, RIGHT?   
YOU YOU LEARN AND YOU ADJUST    
AND IF YOU GET IT WRONG, WHICH  

02:37:55.586 --> 02:37:58.353
YOU YOU LEARN AND YOU ADJUST    
AND IF YOU GET IT WRONG, WHICH  
SOMETIMES YOU DO, THEN YOU TRY  

02:37:58.355 --> 02:37:58.954
AND IF YOU GET IT WRONG, WHICH  
SOMETIMES YOU DO, THEN YOU TRY  
TO MAKE IT BETTER.              

02:37:58.956 --> 02:37:59.689
SOMETIMES YOU DO, THEN YOU TRY  
TO MAKE IT BETTER.              
SO ENTICING THESE TO THE CDC    

02:37:59.691 --> 02:38:01.990
TO MAKE IT BETTER.              
SO ENTICING THESE TO THE CDC    
GUIDELINES IT ALLOWS FOR THAT   

02:38:01.992 --> 02:38:02.758
SO ENTICING THESE TO THE CDC    
GUIDELINES IT ALLOWS FOR THAT   
FLEXIBILITY INSTEAD SORT OF THE 

02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:03.558
GUIDELINES IT ALLOWS FOR THAT   
FLEXIBILITY INSTEAD SORT OF THE 
RIGIDITY THAT WE HAVE IN THE

YOU KNOW IT IS A NOVEL VIRUS    
BECAUSE ME I&amp;apos;M NOT A SCIENTIST  

02:38:18.176 --> 02:38:21.910
YOU KNOW IT IS A NOVEL VIRUS    
BECAUSE ME I&amp;apos;M NOT A SCIENTIST  
BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT WAS  

02:38:21.912 --> 02:38:25.380
BECAUSE ME I&amp;apos;M NOT A SCIENTIST  
BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT WAS  
A NEW ONE IT HASN&amp;apos;T BEEN        

02:38:25.382 --> 02:38:25.914
BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT WAS  
A NEW ONE IT HASN&amp;apos;T BEEN        
EXPOSED TO HUMANS.              

02:38:25.916 --> 02:38:26.748
A NEW ONE IT HASN&amp;apos;T BEEN

WE HAVE GONE THROUGH PANDEMICS  
BEFORE.                         
I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE IT 

02:38:33.424 --> 02:38:36.591
BEFORE.                         
I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE IT 
WITH THIS GOING INTO EFFECT IF  

02:38:36.593 --> 02:38:40.562
I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE IT 
WITH THIS GOING INTO EFFECT IF  
THIS WAS THE RESOLUTION, UH,    

02:38:40.564 --> 02:38:41.330
WITH THIS GOING INTO EFFECT IF  
THIS WAS THE RESOLUTION, UH,    
HOW WOULD TONIGHT&amp;apos;S MEETING BE  

02:38:41.332 --> 02:38:44.400
THIS WAS THE RESOLUTION, UH,    
HOW WOULD TONIGHT&amp;apos;S MEETING BE  
DIFFERENT?                      

02:38:44.402 --> 02:38:50.506
HOW WOULD TONIGHT&amp;apos;S MEETING BE  
DIFFERENT?                      
IT WOULDN&amp;apos;T OH CANCER OR        

02:38:50.508 --> 02:38:51.373
DIFFERENT?                      
IT WOULDN&amp;apos;T OH CANCER OR        
PERHAPS SURE WE WOULD ALL STILL 

02:38:51.375 --> 02:38:54.443
IT WOULDN&amp;apos;T OH CANCER OR        
PERHAPS SURE WE WOULD ALL STILL 
BE WEARING MASKS.               

02:38:54.445 --> 02:38:55.510
PERHAPS SURE WE WOULD ALL STILL 
BE WEARING MASKS.               
THE PUBLIC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO 

02:38:55.512 --> 02:38:59.281
BE WEARING MASKS.               
THE PUBLIC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO 
WEAR MASKS BUT WE WOULD NOT     

02:38:59.283 --> 02:38:59.949
THE PUBLIC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO 
WEAR MASKS BUT WE WOULD NOT     
HAVE THE SOCIAL DISTANCING      

02:38:59.951 --> 02:39:01.817
WEAR MASKS BUT WE WOULD NOT     
HAVE THE SOCIAL DISTANCING      
BECAUSE THE CDC HAS HAS         

02:39:01.819 --> 02:39:02.485
HAVE THE SOCIAL DISTANCING      
BECAUSE THE CDC HAS HAS         
DETERMINED THAT THE SOCIAL      

02:39:02.487 --> 02:39:03.285
BECAUSE THE CDC HAS HAS         
DETERMINED THAT THE SOCIAL      
DISTANCING IN THESE PLEXIGLASS  

02:39:03.287 --> 02:39:05.754
DETERMINED THAT THE SOCIAL      
DISTANCING IN THESE PLEXIGLASS  
IT&amp;apos;S PERFORMATIVE.              

02:39:05.756 --> 02:39:06.688
DISTANCING IN THESE PLEXIGLASS  
IT&amp;apos;S PERFORMATIVE.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DOESN&amp;apos;T ACTUALLY DO       

02:39:06.690 --> 02:39:10.792
IT&amp;apos;S PERFORMATIVE.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DOESN&amp;apos;T ACTUALLY DO       
ANYTHING SO THAT THAT PART      

02:39:10.794 --> 02:39:11.226
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DOESN&amp;apos;T ACTUALLY DO       
ANYTHING SO THAT THAT PART      
WOULD GO AWAY.                  

02:39:11.228 --> 02:39:11.894
ANYTHING SO THAT THAT PART      
WOULD GO AWAY.                  
BUT BECAUSE COMMUNITY           

02:39:11.896 --> 02:39:14.963
WOULD GO AWAY.                  
BUT BECAUSE COMMUNITY           
TRANSMISSION IS HIGH RIGHT NOW, 

02:39:14.965 --> 02:39:17.733
BUT BECAUSE COMMUNITY           
TRANSMISSION IS HIGH RIGHT NOW, 
MASKS WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED.  

02:39:17.735 --> 02:39:18.734
TRANSMISSION IS HIGH RIGHT NOW, 
MASKS WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED.  
SO OUR CITY ATTORNEY AND OUR    

02:39:18.736 --> 02:39:21.837
MASKS WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED.  
SO OUR CITY ATTORNEY AND OUR    
CITY ADMINISTRATOR WOULD BE AT

SO OUR CITY ATTORNEY AND OUR    
CITY ADMINISTRATOR WOULD BE AT

02:39:26.076 --> 02:39:27.242
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE COUNCIL MEMBERS   
IN THE BACK ROW ANYMORE.        
SO IF THIS WERE TO PASS TONIGHT 

02:39:27.244 --> 02:39:33.648
IN THE BACK ROW ANYMORE.        
SO IF THIS WERE TO PASS TONIGHT 
NEXT AND WE BE AT ONE TABLE BUT 

02:39:33.650 --> 02:39:34.817
SO IF THIS WERE TO PASS TONIGHT 
NEXT AND WE BE AT ONE TABLE BUT 
SO THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT  

02:39:34.819 --> 02:39:36.885
NEXT AND WE BE AT ONE TABLE BUT 
SO THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT  
OF DIFFERENCE.
