SO THE FIRST TOPIC YOU CAN GO   
TO THE NEXT SLIDE IS THE FIRE   

00:05:43.037 --> 00:05:45.205
SO THE FIRST TOPIC YOU CAN GO   
TO THE NEXT SLIDE IS THE FIRE   
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.             

00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:46.272
TO THE NEXT SLIDE IS THE FIRE   
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.             
WE TALKED LAST TIME ABOUT HOW   

00:05:46.274 --> 00:05:49.075
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.             
WE TALKED LAST TIME ABOUT HOW   
THE FIRE SUPPRESSION MAY NOT BE 

00:05:49.077 --> 00:05:53.112
WE TALKED LAST TIME ABOUT HOW   
THE FIRE SUPPRESSION MAY NOT BE 
OPERABLE OR OPERATIONAL DURING  

00:05:53.114 --> 00:05:53.580
THE FIRE SUPPRESSION MAY NOT BE 
OPERABLE OR OPERATIONAL DURING  
THE CONSTRUCTION.               

00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:54.513
OPERABLE OR OPERATIONAL DURING  
THE CONSTRUCTION.               
WE HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO      

00:05:54.515 --> 00:05:57.583
THE CONSTRUCTION.               
WE HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO      
CONNECT IT TO THE SIX THIRTY    

00:05:57.585 --> 00:05:58.318
WE HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO      
CONNECT IT TO THE SIX THIRTY    
BUILDING DURING CONSTRUCTION.   

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.521
CONNECT IT TO THE SIX THIRTY    
BUILDING DURING CONSTRUCTION.   
SO SIX THIRTY WILL BE HAVE A    

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:05.624
BUILDING DURING CONSTRUCTION.   
SO SIX THIRTY WILL BE HAVE A    
TCO WHEN THIS GOES INTO EFFECT, 

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:06.459
SO SIX THIRTY WILL BE HAVE A    
TCO WHEN THIS GOES INTO EFFECT, 
WHEN THIS PROCESS GOES INTO

SO THEN THERE WOULD BE TO       

00:08:06.814 --> 00:08:09.482

SO THEN THERE WOULD BE TO       
EGRESS POINTS ONE THROUGH THE

00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:17.556
BOTH WOULD BE OPERATIONAL AT    
THAT TIME.                      
THEY WOULD NOT BE UNDER         

00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:20.793
THAT TIME.                      
THEY WOULD NOT BE UNDER         
CONSTRUCTION AND THEN THIS IS   

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:24.597
THEY WOULD NOT BE UNDER         
CONSTRUCTION AND THEN THIS IS   
THE SLIDE SHOWING THE EXISTING

CONSTRUCTION AND THEN THIS IS   
THE SLIDE SHOWING THE EXISTING

00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:28.401
SCREENING ROOM ONCE             
CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE.       
SO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT      

00:08:28.403 --> 00:08:29.001
CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE.       
SO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT      
PROPERTY LINE DID NOT JOG       

00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:32.171
SO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

AROUND THE EXISTING SCREENING   

00:08:32.173 --> 00:08:33.005
PROPERTY LINE DID NOT JOG       
AROUND THE EXISTING SCREENING   
ROOM IS BECAUSE TODAY THERE IS  

00:08:33.007 --> 00:08:36.576
AROUND THE EXISTING SCREENING   
ROOM IS BECAUSE TODAY THERE IS  
A PROPERTY LINE BETWEEN THE

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.                         
AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT I     
HIGHLIGHTED THIS YELLOW BAR WAS

AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT I     
HIGHLIGHTED THIS YELLOW BAR WAS 
THIS IS THE FINAL EXIT PATH.    

00:17:42.423 --> 00:17:43.422
HIGHLIGHTED THIS YELLOW BAR WAS 
THIS IS THE FINAL EXIT PATH.    
I WOULDN&amp;apos;T SAY THIS IS THE ONLY 

00:17:43.424 --> 00:17:46.558
THIS IS THE FINAL EXIT PATH.    
I WOULDN&amp;apos;T SAY THIS IS THE ONLY

I WOULDN&amp;apos;T SAY THIS IS THE ONLY

00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:47.626
EXIT PATH THAT THEY WOULD HAVE  
.                               
I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S A CHANCE THAT   

00:17:47.628 --> 00:17:48.227
.                               
I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S A CHANCE THAT   
THIS YELLOW BAR COULD GO        

00:17:48.229 --> 00:17:49.828
I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S A CHANCE THAT   
THIS YELLOW BAR COULD GO        
STRAIGHT TO WASHINGTON FOR A    

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.532
THIS YELLOW BAR COULD GO        
STRAIGHT TO WASHINGTON FOR A    
YEAR AND THEN THEY ALL OF A     

00:17:53.534 --> 00:17:54.400
STRAIGHT TO WASHINGTON FOR A    
YEAR AND THEN THEY ALL OF A     
SUDDEN NEED TO FINISH THE LOBBY 

00:17:54.402 --> 00:17:57.803
YEAR AND THEN THEY ALL OF A     
SUDDEN NEED TO FINISH THE LOBBY 
AND THEN IT GOES TO TOWARDS THE 

00:17:57.805 --> 00:18:01.373
SUDDEN NEED TO FINISH THE LOBBY 
AND THEN IT GOES TO TOWARDS THE 
PARKING RAMP WITH A PROTECTION  

00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:01.573
AND THEN IT GOES TO TOWARDS THE 
PARKING RAMP WITH A PROTECTION  
.                               

00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:02.441
PARKING RAMP WITH A PROTECTION  
.                               
I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S VARIOUS ROUTES  

00:18:02.443 --> 00:18:05.444
.                               
I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S VARIOUS ROUTES  
FROM THAT OF THE SCREENING ROOM 

00:18:05.446 --> 00:18:07.512
I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S VARIOUS ROUTES  
FROM THAT OF THE SCREENING ROOM 
TO SIX TO WASHINGTON STREET     

00:18:07.514 --> 00:18:11.950
FROM THAT OF THE SCREENING ROOM

THAT WILL BE PROVIDED WENT AS   

00:18:11.952 --> 00:18:15.755
TO SIX TO WASHINGTON STREET     
THAT WILL BE PROVIDED WENT AS   
CONSTRUCTION ALLOWS BECAUSE THE 

00:18:15.757 --> 00:18:16.688
THAT WILL BE PROVIDED WENT AS   
CONSTRUCTION ALLOWS BECAUSE THE 
THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING TO NEED TO FINISH 

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.691
CONSTRUCTION ALLOWS BECAUSE THE 
THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING TO NEED TO FINISH 
THIS LEVEL ONE AT SOME POINT.   

00:18:19.693 --> 00:18:20.692
THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING TO NEED TO FINISH 
THIS LEVEL ONE AT SOME POINT.   
SO EXTERIOR WALLS ARE GOING TO  

00:18:20.694 --> 00:18:21.193
THIS LEVEL ONE AT SOME POINT.   
SO EXTERIOR WALLS ARE GOING TO  
START SHOWING UP.               

00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:24.063
SO EXTERIOR WALLS ARE GOING TO

START SHOWING UP.               
CMU IS GOING TO BE INSTALLED ON 
ONE SIDE AND I THINK I KNOW     

00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:27.600
CMU IS GOING TO BE INSTALLED ON 
ONE SIDE AND I THINK I KNOW     
CONSTRUCTION IS GOING TO HAVE   

00:18:27.602 --> 00:18:30.703
ONE SIDE AND I THINK I KNOW     
CONSTRUCTION IS GOING TO HAVE   
TO HAVE VARIOUS EGRESS OUTS     

00:18:30.705 --> 00:18:31.637
CONSTRUCTION IS GOING TO HAVE   
TO HAVE VARIOUS EGRESS OUTS     
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR    

00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:32.037
TO HAVE VARIOUS EGRESS OUTS     
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR    
AND A HALF.                     

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:33.105
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR    
AND A HALF.                     
SO THIS YELLOW BAR IS NOT TO    

00:18:33.107 --> 00:18:35.707
AND A HALF.                     
SO THIS YELLOW BAR IS NOT TO    
REPRESENT THE ONLY PATH, IT&amp;apos;S   

00:18:35.709 --> 00:18:39.845
SO THIS YELLOW BAR IS NOT TO    
REPRESENT THE ONLY PATH, IT&amp;apos;S   
JUST AN OPTIONAL PATH AND THE   

00:18:39.847 --> 00:18:40.679
REPRESENT THE ONLY PATH, IT&amp;apos;S   
JUST AN OPTIONAL PATH AND THE   
FINAL PATH WHICH MAKES IT KIND  

00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:43.548
JUST AN OPTIONAL PATH AND THE   
FINAL PATH WHICH MAKES IT KIND  
OF THE EASIEST ROUTE TO SHOW    

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.382
FINAL PATH WHICH MAKES IT KIND  
OF THE EASIEST ROUTE TO SHOW    
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;LL PROBABLY END UP   

00:18:44.384 --> 00:18:46.752
OF THE EASIEST ROUTE TO SHOW    
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;LL PROBABLY END UP   
BEING THE LONGEST STANDING      

00:18:46.754 --> 00:18:47.953
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;LL PROBABLY END UP   
BEING THE LONGEST STANDING      
ROUTE, THE ROUTE THAT THEY USE  

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:54.060
BEING THE LONGEST STANDING      
ROUTE, THE ROUTE THAT THEY USE  
THE MOST                        

00:18:57.564 --> 00:19:06.204

PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THEY GO     
THROUGH THERE IS THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING  
TO BE A SHELF SPACE AND THE     

00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:13.645
THROUGH THERE IS THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING  
TO BE A SHELF SPACE AND THE     
FIXTURES WILL BE PUT IN AFTER

00:49:35.534 --> 00:49:39.336
RAILING AROUND THAT LANDING ON  
THE RAMP AT THAT EXIT ARROW IS  
CROSSING SO THERE WOULD NOT BE  

00:49:39.338 --> 00:49:40.270
THE RAMP AT THAT EXIT ARROW IS  
CROSSING SO THERE WOULD NOT BE  
WE COULD WE COULD ALSO PUT A    

00:49:40.272 --> 00:49:43.407
CROSSING SO THERE WOULD NOT BE  
WE COULD WE COULD ALSO PUT A    
STAIRCASE UP TO THAT AS WELL

JUST TRYING TO STOP WHAT IS IT  

00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:46.309
STAIRCASE UP TO THAT AS WELL    
JUST TRYING TO STOP WHAT IS IT  
HOW IS THE TWO STEPS?           

00:49:46.311 --> 00:49:49.646
JUST TRYING TO STOP WHAT IS IT  
HOW IS THE TWO STEPS?           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S APPROXIMATELY A THREE   

00:49:49.648 --> 00:49:50.180
HOW IS THE TWO STEPS?           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S APPROXIMATELY A THREE   
FOOT GREAT CHANGE.              

00:49:50.182 --> 00:49:54.284
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S APPROXIMATELY A THREE   
FOOT GREAT CHANGE.              
OK, UM THERE&amp;apos;S THREE RIDES      

00:49:54.286 --> 00:49:54.651

OK, UM THERE&amp;apos;S THREE RIDES      
BEFORE RIGHT.                   

00:49:54.653 --> 00:49:55.051

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH.                        
AND SO THE REASON I DIDN&amp;apos;T DRAW 
THERE IS BECAUSE IT WOULD       

00:49:58.690 --> 00:49:59.490
AND SO THE REASON I DIDN&amp;apos;T DRAW 
THERE IS BECAUSE IT WOULD       
PROBABLY WANT TO GO NORTH AND   

00:49:59.492 --> 00:50:01.991
THERE IS BECAUSE IT WOULD       
PROBABLY WANT TO GO NORTH AND   
THAT WOULD IMPEDE THE VIEW      

00:50:01.993 --> 00:50:02.625
PROBABLY WANT TO GO NORTH AND   
THAT WOULD IMPEDE THE VIEW      
OF THE OF THE SCREENING.        

00:50:02.627 --> 00:50:05.629
THAT WOULD IMPEDE THE VIEW

BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IS DO A    

00:50:05.631 --> 00:50:09.032
OF THE OF THE SCREENING.        
BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IS DO A    
STAIR UM THAT MAKES THAT        

00:50:09.034 --> 00:50:09.800
BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IS DO A    
STAIR UM THAT MAKES THAT        
LANDING A LITTLE WIDER AND THEN 

00:50:09.802 --> 00:50:10.667
STAIR UM THAT MAKES THAT        
LANDING A LITTLE WIDER AND THEN 
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHAIRS AT  

00:50:10.669 --> 00:50:13.737
LANDING A LITTLE WIDER AND THEN 
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHAIRS AT  
THE ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO KEEP   

00:50:13.739 --> 00:50:17.274
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHAIRS AT  
THE ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO KEEP   
KIND OF A ANOTHER PATH WE COULD 

00:50:17.276 --> 00:50:18.308

NOT REFERENCING ANY EXIT

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:17.147
MICHIGAN THEATER OWNS BOTH      
BUILDINGS AND YOU HAVE TWO      
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET TO EXIT  

00:54:17.149 --> 00:54:18.081
BUILDINGS AND YOU HAVE TWO      
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET TO EXIT  
THE BUILDING AND IT&amp;apos;S ONLY FIVE

00:54:30.995 --> 00:54:39.202
TO THE STAGE FOUR DOESN&amp;apos;T HAVE  
AN EXIT PASSAGEWAY BUT THAT&amp;apos;S A 
REAL ENCLOSURE THERE CORRECT?   

00:54:39.204 --> 00:54:40.236
AN EXIT PASSAGEWAY BUT THAT&amp;apos;S A 
REAL ENCLOSURE THERE CORRECT?   
WE ARE NOT CALLING IT AN EXIT   

00:54:40.238 --> 00:54:42.806
REAL ENCLOSURE THERE CORRECT?   
WE ARE NOT CALLING IT AN EXIT   
PASSAGEWAY IN THAT SCENARIO     

00:54:42.808 --> 00:54:43.706
WE ARE NOT CALLING IT AN EXIT   
PASSAGEWAY IN THAT SCENARIO     
BECAUSE AN EXIT PASSAGEWAY IS   

00:54:43.708 --> 00:54:44.441
PASSAGEWAY IN THAT SCENARIO     
BECAUSE AN EXIT PASSAGEWAY IS   
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD USE IN 

00:54:44.443 --> 00:54:47.310
BECAUSE AN EXIT PASSAGEWAY IS   
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD USE IN 
MY OPINION TO LIMIT YOUR COMMON

EITHER OF THOSE IS AN ISSUE IN  
STAGE FOUR.                     

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.218
EITHER OF THOSE IS AN ISSUE IN  
STAGE FOUR.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I WOULD NOT COUNT THAT

STAGE FOUR.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I WOULD NOT COUNT THAT    
CORRIDOR AS AN EXIT PASSAGEWAY  

00:54:58.323 --> 00:54:58.522
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I WOULD NOT COUNT THAT
