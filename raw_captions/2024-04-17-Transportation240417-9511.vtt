00:43:11.212 --> 00:43:12.144
PEOPLE TOOK AND JUST PARKING    
AND GAS.                        
A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS ONE  

00:43:12.146 --> 00:43:15.848
AND GAS.                        
A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS ONE  
POINT ALMOST FIVE MILLION IN    

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:16.548
A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS ONE  
POINT ALMOST FIVE MILLION IN    
ANNUAL SAVINGS FOR THOSE        

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.318
POINT ALMOST FIVE MILLION IN    
ANNUAL SAVINGS FOR THOSE        
DOWNTOWN EMPLOYEES WHO          

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.052

00:43:20.054 --> 00:43:22.888
DOWNTOWN EMPLOYEES WHO          
PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM.    
I THINK THE NUMBER USED FOR FOR 

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:23.756
PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM.    
I THINK THE NUMBER USED FOR FOR 
GAS WAS LIKE THREE DOLLARS      

00:43:23.758 --> 00:43:26.092
I THINK THE NUMBER USED FOR FOR 
GAS WAS LIKE THREE DOLLARS      
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS IN   

00:43:26.094 --> 00:43:27.192
GAS WAS LIKE THREE DOLLARS      
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS IN   
DECEMBER AT THE TIME WE DID THE 

00:43:27.194 --> 00:43:27.893
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS IN   
DECEMBER AT THE TIME WE DID THE 
CALCULATION WHICH IS CERTAINLY  

00:43:27.895 --> 00:43:28.294
DECEMBER AT THE TIME WE DID THE 
CALCULATION WHICH IS CERTAINLY  
REALLY LOW.                     

00:43:28.296 --> 00:43:31.264
CALCULATION WHICH IS CERTAINLY  
REALLY LOW.                     
SO THIS NUMBER IS PROBABLY A    

00:43:31.266 --> 00:43:34.466
REALLY LOW.                     
SO THIS NUMBER IS PROBABLY A    
LOT HIGHER AND THEN OF COURSE   

00:43:34.468 --> 00:43:35.400
SO THIS NUMBER IS PROBABLY A    
LOT HIGHER AND THEN OF COURSE   
THERE'S IMPACTS ON FUEL SAVED   

00:43:35.402 --> 00:43:38.604
LOT HIGHER AND THEN OF COURSE   
THERE'S IMPACTS ON FUEL SAVED   
AND GREENHOUSE GASES SWITCHING  

00:43:38.606 --> 00:43:41.940
THERE'S IMPACTS ON FUEL SAVED   
AND GREENHOUSE GASES SWITCHING  
THOSE TRIPS TO A SHARED FORM    

00:43:41.942 --> 00:43:42.708
AND GREENHOUSE GASES SWITCHING  
THOSE TRIPS TO A SHARED FORM    
OF TRANSPORTATION THAT'S ENERGY

TAKE A LOOK AT THE AREA AT THE  
INTERSECTION.                   
THEY'LL LOOK THINGS LIKE STREET 

00:56:08.289 --> 00:56:11.923
INTERSECTION.                   
THEY'LL LOOK THINGS LIKE STREET 
LIGHTS AND TRAFFIC LIGHTS,      

00:56:11.925 --> 00:56:12.857
THEY'LL LOOK THINGS LIKE STREET

THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT FROM AN 
ENGINEERING STANDPOINT THAT     
MAYBE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO 

00:56:20.701 --> 00:56:23.034
ENGINEERING STANDPOINT THAT     
MAYBE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO 
THIS TO THE SITUATION?          

00:56:23.036 --> 00:56:24.202
MAYBE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO 
THIS TO THE SITUATION?          
>> SO IF I IF WE WANT TO ADD    

00:56:24.204 --> 00:56:27.139
THIS TO THE SITUATION?          
>> SO IF I IF WE WANT TO ADD    
ANYTHING TO THAT RAYMOND.

>> YEAH, THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT. 
YOU'RE RIGHT.                   
I THINK YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL 

00:56:29.577 --> 00:56:31.042
YOU'RE RIGHT.                   
I THINK YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL 
ON THE HEAD.                    

00:56:31.044 --> 00:56:32.144
I THINK YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL 
ON THE HEAD.                    
THE FIRST THING THAT WE TRY TO  

00:56:32.146 --> 00:56:32.911
ON THE HEAD.                    
THE FIRST THING THAT WE TRY TO  
DO IS REALLY SCAN THE EXISTING  

00:56:32.913 --> 00:56:34.847
THE FIRST THING THAT WE TRY TO  
DO IS REALLY SCAN THE EXISTING  
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SEE IF ANY    

00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:35.447
DO IS REALLY SCAN THE EXISTING  
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SEE IF ANY    
OF IT IS FAILING.               

00:56:35.449 --> 00:56:36.448
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SEE IF ANY    
OF IT IS FAILING.               
SO IF THERE IS A FLASHING       

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:39.317
OF IT IS FAILING.               
SO IF THERE IS A FLASHING       
YELLOW PEDESTRIAN SIGN LIKE A   

00:56:39.319 --> 00:56:40.018
SO IF THERE IS A FLASHING       
YELLOW PEDESTRIAN SIGN LIKE A   
RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING      

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:40.686
YELLOW PEDESTRIAN SIGN LIKE A   
RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING      
BEACON, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE    

00:56:40.688 --> 00:56:43.321
RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING      
BEACON, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE    
THAT IT'S WORKING WHEN ACTUATED 

00:56:43.323 --> 00:56:44.122
BEACON, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE    
THAT IT'S WORKING WHEN ACTUATED 
ON BOTH SIDES, MAKING SURE THAT 

00:56:44.124 --> 00:56:47.225
THAT IT'S WORKING WHEN ACTUATED 
ON BOTH SIDES, MAKING SURE THAT 
THE LIGHTS ARE SIGNALING WHAT   

00:56:47.227 --> 00:56:47.592
ON BOTH SIDES, MAKING SURE THAT 
THE LIGHTS ARE SIGNALING WHAT   
HAVE YOU.                       

00:56:47.594 --> 00:56:48.594
THE LIGHTS ARE SIGNALING WHAT   
HAVE YOU.                       
WE ALSO IF THE CRASH OCCURRED   

00:56:48.596 --> 00:56:51.663
HAVE YOU.                       
WE ALSO IF THE CRASH OCCURRED   
AT NIGHT WE WANT TO GO AND MAKE 

00:56:51.665 --> 00:56:52.397
WE ALSO IF THE CRASH OCCURRED   
AT NIGHT WE WANT TO GO AND MAKE 
SURE THAT THE STREETLIGHTS ARE  

00:56:52.399 --> 00:56:54.867
AT NIGHT WE WANT TO GO AND MAKE 
SURE THAT THE STREETLIGHTS ARE  
OPERATING PROPERLY.             

00:56:54.869 --> 00:56:55.934
SURE THAT THE STREETLIGHTS ARE  
OPERATING PROPERLY.             
WE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT LIKE     

00:56:55.936 --> 00:56:56.734
OPERATING PROPERLY.             
WE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT LIKE     
PAVEMENT MARKINGS, THINGS LIKE  

00:56:56.736 --> 00:56:59.270
WE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT LIKE     
PAVEMENT MARKINGS, THINGS LIKE  
THAT TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THAT   

00:56:59.272 --> 00:56:59.904
PAVEMENT MARKINGS, THINGS LIKE  
THAT TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THAT   
IS IN GOOD CONDITION.           

00:56:59.906 --> 00:57:02.307
THAT TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THAT   
IS IN GOOD CONDITION.           
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF OUR       

00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:03.174
IS IN GOOD CONDITION.           
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF OUR       
INITIAL SCAN AND THEN WE WILL   

00:57:03.176 --> 00:57:09.314
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF OUR       
INITIAL SCAN AND THEN WE WILL   
OFTEN KIND                      

00:57:23.196 --> 00:57:25.263
           OF THINK THROUGH IT  
IF WE KIND OF GET ENOUGH        
DETAILS ON THE CONTRIBUTING     

00:57:25.265 --> 00:57:26.064
IF WE KIND OF GET ENOUGH        
DETAILS ON THE CONTRIBUTING     
FACTORS TO THE CRASH, WE MAY    

00:57:26.066 --> 00:57:26.732
DETAILS ON THE CONTRIBUTING     
FACTORS TO THE CRASH, WE MAY    
ALSO START TO THINK THROUGH     

00:57:26.734 --> 00:57:27.399
FACTORS TO THE CRASH, WE MAY    
ALSO START TO THINK THROUGH     
OTHER MORE HOLISTIC CHANGES.    

00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:28.100
ALSO START TO THINK THROUGH     
OTHER MORE HOLISTIC CHANGES.    
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE       

00:57:28.102 --> 00:57:28.900
OTHER MORE HOLISTIC CHANGES.    
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE       
TENDED TO ROCKHAMPTON OR MIGHT  

00:57:28.902 --> 00:57:29.835
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE       
TENDED TO ROCKHAMPTON OR MIGHT  
BE ABLE TO TO BACK ME UP ON IS  

00:57:29.837 --> 00:57:30.602
TENDED TO ROCKHAMPTON OR MIGHT  
BE ABLE TO TO BACK ME UP ON IS  
A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S A SORT   

00:57:30.604 --> 00:57:31.403
BE ABLE TO TO BACK ME UP ON IS  
A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S A SORT   
OF BEHAVIORAL COMPONENT AND WE  

00:57:31.405 --> 00:57:32.070
A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S A SORT   
OF BEHAVIORAL COMPONENT AND WE  
TRY TO THINK THROUGH HOW MUCH   

00:57:32.072 --> 00:57:32.871
OF BEHAVIORAL COMPONENT AND WE  
TRY TO THINK THROUGH HOW MUCH   
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE MAY HAVE  

00:57:32.873 --> 00:57:33.605
TRY TO THINK THROUGH HOW MUCH   
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE MAY HAVE  
CONTRIBUTED TO THAT BEHAVIORAL  

00:57:33.607 --> 00:57:34.272
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE MAY HAVE  
CONTRIBUTED TO THAT BEHAVIORAL  
MISJUDGMENT FOR LACK OF A       

00:57:34.274 --> 00:57:34.940
CONTRIBUTED TO THAT BEHAVIORAL  
MISJUDGMENT FOR LACK OF A       
BETTER TERM VERSUS JUST BEING   

00:57:34.942 --> 00:57:37.543
MISJUDGMENT FOR LACK OF A       
BETTER TERM VERSUS JUST BEING   
AN INATTENTIVE DRIVER OR        

00:57:37.545 --> 00:57:38.276
BETTER TERM VERSUS JUST BEING   
AN INATTENTIVE DRIVER OR        
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE.       

00:57:38.278 --> 00:57:41.680
AN INATTENTIVE DRIVER OR        
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE.       
AND SO WE TRY TO TAKE ALL THAT  

00:57:41.682 --> 00:57:42.480
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE.       
AND SO WE TRY TO TAKE ALL THAT  
INTO CONSIDERATION, ESPECIALLY  

00:57:42.482 --> 00:57:43.181
AND SO WE TRY TO TAKE ALL THAT  
INTO CONSIDERATION, ESPECIALLY  
WITH THE FATALITIES AND THE     

00:57:43.183 --> 00:57:45.784
INTO CONSIDERATION, ESPECIALLY  
WITH THE FATALITIES AND THE     
SERIOUS CRASHES AND THEN IF     

00:57:45.786 --> 00:57:48.253
WITH THE FATALITIES AND THE     
SERIOUS CRASHES AND THEN IF     
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS    

00:57:48.255 --> 00:57:49.054
SERIOUS CRASHES AND THEN IF     
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS    
REPAIR, WE PROGRAM THAT         

00:57:49.056 --> 00:57:49.787
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS    
REPAIR, WE PROGRAM THAT         
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY   

00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:52.390
REPAIR, WE PROGRAM THAT         
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY   
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING.  

00:57:52.392 --> 00:57:53.525
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY   
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING.  
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE 

00:57:53.527 --> 00:57:57.095
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING.  
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE 
DO THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND 

00:57:57.097 --> 00:57:57.962
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE 
DO THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND 
THEN IF THERE'S A BIGGER        

00:57:57.964 --> 00:58:00.598
DO THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND 
THEN IF THERE'S A BIGGER        
CAPITAL PROJECTS OR A LONGER    

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:01.299
THEN IF THERE'S A BIGGER        
CAPITAL PROJECTS OR A LONGER    
TERM INVESTMENT OR SOME SORT    

00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:02.066
CAPITAL PROJECTS OR A LONGER    
TERM INVESTMENT OR SOME SORT    
OF CHANGE THAT WE MIGHT         

00:58:02.068 --> 00:58:04.902
TERM INVESTMENT OR SOME SORT    
OF CHANGE THAT WE MIGHT         
CONSIDER, WE START THINKING     

00:58:04.904 --> 00:58:05.604
OF CHANGE THAT WE MIGHT         
CONSIDER, WE START THINKING     
THROUGH SOME OF THE PROCESSES   

00:58:05.606 --> 00:58:07.940
CONSIDER, WE START THINKING     
THROUGH SOME OF THE PROCESSES   
AND PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN        

00:58:07.942 --> 00:58:08.874
THROUGH SOME OF THE PROCESSES   
AND PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN        
LEVERAGE TO TO ACTUATE THOSE    

00:58:08.876 --> 00:58:09.273
AND PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN        
LEVERAGE TO TO ACTUATE THOSE    
CHANGES.                        

00:58:09.275 --> 00:58:12.077
LEVERAGE TO TO ACTUATE THOSE    
CHANGES.                        
SOME ARE EASIER SAID THAN DONE. 

00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:15.580
CHANGES.                        
SOME ARE EASIER SAID THAN DONE. 
OBVIOUSLY SOME FIXES CAN BE     

00:58:15.582 --> 00:58:16.214
SOME ARE EASIER SAID THAN DONE. 
OBVIOUSLY SOME FIXES CAN BE     
DONE WITHIN EXISTING BUDGETS    

00:58:16.216 --> 00:58:19.585
OBVIOUSLY SOME FIXES CAN BE     
DONE WITHIN EXISTING BUDGETS    
BUT SOME FIXES MIGHT BE BIG AND 

00:58:19.587 --> 00:58:20.585
DONE WITHIN EXISTING BUDGETS    
BUT SOME FIXES MIGHT BE BIG AND 
NEED TO BE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE 

00:58:20.587 --> 00:58:23.354
BUT SOME FIXES MIGHT BE BIG AND 
NEED TO BE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND 

00:58:23.356 --> 00:58:24.255
NEED TO BE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND 
OR THROUGH THE CITY'S BUDGETING 

00:58:24.257 --> 00:58:24.523
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND 
OR THROUGH THE CITY'S BUDGETING 
PROCESS.

OR THROUGH THE CITY'S BUDGETING 
PROCESS.                        
SO IT'S REALLY JUST A FUNCTION  

00:58:27.627 --> 00:58:28.260
PROCESS.                        
SO IT'S REALLY JUST A FUNCTION  
OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING KIND    

00:58:28.262 --> 00:58:31.696
SO IT'S REALLY JUST A FUNCTION  
OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING KIND    
OF WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO IT AND   

00:58:31.698 --> 00:58:32.563
OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING KIND

OF WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO IT AND   
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE 
COUNTERMEASURES YOU'VE HEARD US

COUNTERMEASURES YOU'VE HEARD US 
TALK BEFORE THIS IS ONE OF THE  
REASONS WHY WE PRODUCED THE     

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.073
TALK BEFORE THIS IS ONE OF THE  
REASONS WHY WE PRODUCED THE     
CRASH REPORT BECAUSE WE REALLY  

00:58:41.075 --> 00:58:41.940
REASONS WHY WE PRODUCED THE     
CRASH REPORT BECAUSE WE REALLY  
WANT SORT OF THE TRENDS TO BE   

00:58:41.942 --> 00:58:44.442
CRASH REPORT BECAUSE WE REALLY  
WANT SORT OF THE TRENDS TO BE   
UNDERSTOOD.                     

00:58:44.444 --> 00:58:48.179
WANT SORT OF THE TRENDS TO BE   
UNDERSTOOD.                     
MY OBSERVATION IS A LOT OF OUR  

00:58:48.181 --> 00:58:48.913
UNDERSTOOD.                     
MY OBSERVATION IS A LOT OF OUR

01:02:43.249 --> 01:02:45.717
VEHICLE TRANSPORT WHICH IS ANY  
CAR THAT'S ON THE ROADWAY.      
SO IMPACT MOTOR VEHICLE         

01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:46.451
CAR THAT'S ON THE ROADWAY.      
SO IMPACT MOTOR VEHICLE         
TRANSPORT THEN RAN OFF ROADWAY  

01:02:46.453 --> 01:02:49.253
SO IMPACT MOTOR VEHICLE         
TRANSPORT THEN RAN OFF ROADWAY  
THEN HIT A POLE THAT COULD A    

01:02:49.255 --> 01:02:50.021
TRANSPORT THEN RAN OFF ROADWAY  
THEN HIT A POLE THAT COULD A    
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AS THEY CALL 

01:02:50.023 --> 01:02:50.288
THEN HIT A POLE THAT COULD A    
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AS THEY CALL 
IT.                             

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:53.457
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AS THEY CALL 
IT.                             
THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF THINGS    

01:02:53.459 --> 01:02:54.392
IT.                             
THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF THINGS    
THAT KIND OF DOCUMENT A PLAY BY 

01:02:54.394 --> 01:02:56.261
THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF THINGS    
THAT KIND OF DOCUMENT A PLAY BY 
PLAY OF WHAT HAPPENED AND THEN  

01:02:56.263 --> 01:03:00.131
THAT KIND OF DOCUMENT A PLAY BY 
PLAY OF WHAT HAPPENED AND THEN  
ANY CRASH IT HAS A AN INJURY    

01:03:00.133 --> 01:03:01.066
PLAY OF WHAT HAPPENED AND THEN  
ANY CRASH IT HAS A AN INJURY    
WILL REQUIRE A DIAGRAM SO THE   

01:03:01.068 --> 01:03:04.536
ANY CRASH IT HAS A AN INJURY    
WILL REQUIRE A DIAGRAM SO THE   
OFFICER WILL ACTUALLY DRAW THE  

01:03:04.538 --> 01:03:05.336
WILL REQUIRE A DIAGRAM SO THE   
OFFICER WILL ACTUALLY DRAW THE  
INTERSECTION OUT AND WE'LL DRAW 

01:03:05.338 --> 01:03:08.806
OFFICER WILL ACTUALLY DRAW THE  
INTERSECTION OUT AND WE'LL DRAW 
THE CARS AND A LITTLE SKETCH    

01:03:08.808 --> 01:03:09.440
INTERSECTION OUT AND WE'LL DRAW 
THE CARS AND A LITTLE SKETCH    
OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.       

01:03:09.442 --> 01:03:12.711
THE CARS AND A LITTLE SKETCH    
OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.       
NOW THE BEST INVESTIGATORS DO A 

01:03:12.713 --> 01:03:16.547
OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.       
NOW THE BEST INVESTIGATORS DO A 
LOT MORE DETAILED INVESTIGATION 

01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:17.282
NOW THE BEST INVESTIGATORS DO A 
LOT MORE DETAILED INVESTIGATION 
MEASUREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE    

01:03:17.284 --> 01:03:18.016
LOT MORE DETAILED INVESTIGATION 
MEASUREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE    
THAT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER.  

01:03:18.018 --> 01:03:20.318
MEASUREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE    
THAT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER.  
SO THERE'S THEIR DIAGRAMS AND   

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.252
THAT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER.  
SO THERE'S THEIR DIAGRAMS AND   
DOCUMENTATION IS MUCH MORE IN   

01:03:21.254 --> 01:03:28.727
SO THERE'S THEIR DIAGRAMS AND   
DOCUMENTATION IS MUCH MORE IN   
DEPTH BUT ALL OF THEM ALL THE   

01:03:28.729 --> 01:03:29.527
DOCUMENTATION IS MUCH MORE IN   
DEPTH BUT ALL OF THEM ALL THE   
ALL THE DATA GETS CAPTURED      

01:03:29.529 --> 01:03:31.963
DEPTH BUT ALL OF THEM ALL THE   
ALL THE DATA GETS CAPTURED      
EITHER BASICALLY ON THE BASIC   

01:03:31.965 --> 01:03:32.764
ALL THE DATA GETS CAPTURED      
EITHER BASICALLY ON THE BASIC   
FORM AND THE MOST SIMPLE CRASH  

01:03:32.766 --> 01:03:36.100
EITHER BASICALLY ON THE BASIC   
FORM AND THE MOST SIMPLE CRASH  
MORE SERIOUS WILL GET A DIAGRAM 

01:03:36.102 --> 01:03:36.768
FORM AND THE MOST SIMPLE CRASH  
MORE SERIOUS WILL GET A DIAGRAM 
AS WELL AND THEN YOU COULD GET  

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:37.568
MORE SERIOUS WILL GET A DIAGRAM 
AS WELL AND THEN YOU COULD GET  
AN ADVANCE THE DESICCATION ON   

01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:39.570
AS WELL AND THEN YOU COULD GET  
AN ADVANCE THE DESICCATION ON   
TOP OF THAT.                    

01:03:39.572 --> 01:03:40.504
AN ADVANCE THE DESICCATION ON   
TOP OF THAT.                    
AND I'LL JUST KIND OF RECAP     

01:03:40.506 --> 01:03:43.708
TOP OF THAT.                    
AND I'LL JUST KIND OF RECAP     
WHAT I MENTIONED A MONTH OR SO  

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:44.642
AND I'LL JUST KIND OF RECAP     
WHAT I MENTIONED A MONTH OR SO  
AGO ON SOME OF THE CAPTURE      

01:03:44.644 --> 01:03:46.677
WHAT I MENTIONED A MONTH OR SO  
AGO ON SOME OF THE CAPTURE      
REGARDING VEHICLES.             

01:03:46.679 --> 01:03:47.712
AGO ON SOME OF THE CAPTURE      
REGARDING VEHICLES.             
IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING AND 

01:03:47.714 --> 01:03:50.481
REGARDING VEHICLES.             
IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING AND 
WE TRIED OUR BEST TO GET OUR    

01:03:50.483 --> 01:03:54.786
IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING AND 
WE TRIED OUR BEST TO GET OUR    
OFFICERS ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.  

01:03:54.788 --> 01:03:55.886
WE TRIED OUR BEST TO GET OUR    
OFFICERS ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.  
BUT FOR EXAMPLE, IF MOTOR       

01:03:55.888 --> 01:03:58.790
OFFICERS ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.  
BUT FOR EXAMPLE, IF MOTOR       
VEHICLES INVOLVED THAN OTHERS,  

01:03:58.792 --> 01:03:59.591
BUT FOR EXAMPLE, IF MOTOR       
VEHICLES INVOLVED THAN OTHERS,  
THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.    

01:03:59.593 --> 01:04:01.826
VEHICLES INVOLVED THAN OTHERS,  
THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.    
SO YOU CHECK THE MOTOR VEHICLE  

01:04:01.828 --> 01:04:05.896
THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.    
SO YOU CHECK THE MOTOR VEHICLE  
BUT IF A BICYCLE IS INVOLVED    

01:04:05.898 --> 01:04:06.631
SO YOU CHECK THE MOTOR VEHICLE  
BUT IF A BICYCLE IS INVOLVED    
THAT'S COULD BE A BICYCLE WITH  

01:04:06.633 --> 01:04:09.867
BUT IF A BICYCLE IS INVOLVED    
THAT'S COULD BE A BICYCLE WITH  
TWO WHEELS, THREE WHEELS, A     

01:04:09.869 --> 01:04:13.405
THAT'S COULD BE A BICYCLE WITH  
TWO WHEELS, THREE WHEELS, A     
TRICYCLE COULD BE A RAZOR       

01:04:13.407 --> 01:04:13.804
TWO WHEELS, THREE WHEELS, A     
TRICYCLE COULD BE A RAZOR       
SCOOTER.                        

01:04:13.806 --> 01:04:17.842
TRICYCLE COULD BE A RAZOR       
SCOOTER.                        
SO A TWO WEEK OLD WITH YOU      

01:04:17.844 --> 01:04:18.510
SCOOTER.                        
SO A TWO WEEK OLD WITH YOU      
STAND ON IT BUT THERE'S NO      

01:04:18.512 --> 01:04:20.411
SO A TWO WEEK OLD WITH YOU      
STAND ON IT BUT THERE'S NO      
MOTOR NOW IF YOU THROW A MOTOR  

01:04:20.413 --> 01:04:21.346
STAND ON IT BUT THERE'S NO      
MOTOR NOW IF YOU THROW A MOTOR  
ON THAT THEN BECOMES THE MOTOR  

01:04:21.348 --> 01:04:21.746
MOTOR NOW IF YOU THROW A MOTOR  
ON THAT THEN BECOMES THE MOTOR  
VEHICLE.                        

01:04:21.748 --> 01:04:28.386
ON THAT THEN BECOMES THE MOTOR  
VEHICLE.                        
SAME THING WITH A ELECTRIC BIKE 

01:04:28.388 --> 01:04:29.320
VEHICLE.                        
SAME THING WITH A ELECTRIC BIKE 
,WITH THE BIKE WITH A MOTOR     

01:04:29.322 --> 01:04:29.987
SAME THING WITH A ELECTRIC BIKE 
,WITH THE BIKE WITH A MOTOR     
BECOMES A MOTOR VEHICLE.        

01:04:29.989 --> 01:04:32.791
,WITH THE BIKE WITH A MOTOR     
BECOMES A MOTOR VEHICLE.        
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A  

01:04:32.793 --> 01:04:33.391
BECOMES A MOTOR VEHICLE.        
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A  
LITTLE BIT CONFUSING.           

01:04:33.393 --> 01:04:34.259
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A  
LITTLE BIT CONFUSING.           
SO AGAIN, WE'RE TRYING TO GET   

01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:36.160
LITTLE BIT CONFUSING.           
SO AGAIN, WE'RE TRYING TO GET   
OUR OFFICERS GET ON THE SAME    

01:04:36.162 --> 01:04:36.394
SO AGAIN, WE'RE TRYING TO GET   
OUR OFFICERS GET ON THE SAME    
PAGE.                           

01:04:36.396 --> 01:04:36.961
OUR OFFICERS GET ON THE SAME    
PAGE.                           
WE DO GET ACCURATE              

01:04:36.963 --> 01:04:39.430
PAGE.                           
WE DO GET ACCURATE              
DOCUMENTATION AS TO EXACTLY     

01:04:39.432 --> 01:04:43.701
WE DO GET ACCURATE              
DOCUMENTATION AS TO EXACTLY     
WHAT WHAT TRANSPIRED AND GET    

01:04:43.703 --> 01:04:44.235
DOCUMENTATION AS TO EXACTLY     
WHAT WHAT TRANSPIRED AND GET    
THAT DATA ACCURATE.             

01:04:44.237 --> 01:04:45.202
WHAT WHAT TRANSPIRED AND GET    
THAT DATA ACCURATE.             
SO WHEN IT GETS TO REAGAN AND   

01:04:45.204 --> 01:04:47.872
THAT DATA ACCURATE.             
SO WHEN IT GETS TO REAGAN AND   
HIS TEAM THEY CAN LOOK AT IT    

01:04:47.874 --> 01:04:48.806
SO WHEN IT GETS TO REAGAN AND   
HIS TEAM THEY CAN LOOK AT IT    
AND SAY OK, THIS WE'VE GOT A    

01:04:48.808 --> 01:04:51.242
HIS TEAM THEY CAN LOOK AT IT    
AND SAY OK, THIS WE'VE GOT A    
ONE VEHICLE HERE, TWO VEHICLES  

01:04:51.244 --> 01:04:51.943
AND SAY OK, THIS WE'VE GOT A    
ONE VEHICLE HERE, TWO VEHICLES  
OR A SINGLE MOTOR VEHICLE WITH

SO IF THEY MUDDY THE WATER BUT  

01:04:59.085 --> 01:04:59.851
LIKE THAT.                      
SO IF THEY MUDDY THE WATER BUT  
JUST TRY TO CLARIFY A LITTLE    

01:04:59.853 --> 01:05:02.987
SO IF THEY MUDDY THE WATER BUT  
JUST TRY TO CLARIFY A LITTLE    
BIT THAT THERE'S LITTLE NUANCES 

01:05:02.989 --> 01:05:03.788
JUST TRY TO CLARIFY A LITTLE    
BIT THAT THERE'S LITTLE NUANCES 
IN THERE THAT CAN BE A LITTLE   

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:05.723
BIT THAT THERE'S LITTLE NUANCES 
IN THERE THAT CAN BE A LITTLE   
CONFUSING AND CAN KIND OF MAKE  

01:05:05.725 --> 01:05:06.724
IN THERE THAT CAN BE A LITTLE   
CONFUSING AND CAN KIND OF MAKE  
THE DATA A LITTLE BIT TOUGHER   

01:05:06.726 --> 01:05:09.960
CONFUSING AND CAN KIND OF MAKE  
THE DATA A LITTLE BIT TOUGHER   
TO CAPTURE.                     

01:05:09.962 --> 01:05:10.695

THEY ARE THE FIRST RESPONDERS.  
THEY HAVE THE SIRENS.           
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SECURE

IT'S GOING OUT THERE AND        
ASSESSING THE SITUATION, SEEING

IT'S GOING OUT THERE AND        
ASSESSING THE SITUATION, SEEING 
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO AND       

01:11:46.192 --> 01:11:47.091
ASSESSING THE SITUATION, SEEING 
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO AND       
AGAIN, IT REALLY DEPENDS ON

THERE WAS A FATALITY OF A       
CYCLIST ON STADIUM AT WYNWOOD.

THERE WAS A FATALITY OF A       
CYCLIST ON STADIUM AT WYNWOOD.  
I BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED EARLY

RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING      
BEACONS.

RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING      
BEACONS.                        
NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE   

01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.969
BEACONS.                        
NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE   
RP'S ARE NOT AT THE

INTERSECTION.                   

01:12:32.438 --> 01:12:34.705
RP'S ARE NOT AT THE             
INTERSECTION.                   
THEY'RE OFFSET THE INTERSECTION 

01:12:34.707 --> 01:12:35.573
INTERSECTION.                   
THEY'RE OFFSET THE INTERSECTION 
PROBABLY A COUPLE DOZEN FEET OR 

01:12:35.575 --> 01:12:38.442
THEY'RE OFFSET THE INTERSECTION 
PROBABLY A COUPLE DOZEN FEET OR 
ONE HUNDRED FEET TO THE SOUTH.  

01:12:38.444 --> 01:12:39.377
PROBABLY A COUPLE DOZEN FEET OR 
ONE HUNDRED FEET TO THE SOUTH.  
THE ROCKIES WERE WORKING.       

01:12:39.379 --> 01:12:40.044
ONE HUNDRED FEET TO THE SOUTH.  
THE ROCKIES WERE WORKING.       
WE LOOKED AT THE STREET         

01:12:40.046 --> 01:12:40.378
THE ROCKIES WERE WORKING.       
WE LOOKED AT THE STREET         
LIGHTING.                       

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.580
WE LOOKED AT THE STREET         
LIGHTING.                       
EVERYTHING WAS WORKING PROPERLY 

01:12:42.582 --> 01:12:46.817
LIGHTING.                       
EVERYTHING WAS WORKING PROPERLY 
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS KIND    

01:12:46.819 --> 01:12:47.584
EVERYTHING WAS WORKING PROPERLY 
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS KIND    
OF THE DETAILS AROUND THAT      

01:12:47.586 --> 01:12:50.555
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS KIND    
OF THE DETAILS AROUND THAT      
CRASH THERE.                    

01:12:50.557 --> 01:12:51.689
OF THE DETAILS AROUND THAT      
CRASH THERE.                    
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF TRAFFIC   

01:12:51.691 --> 01:12:52.289
CRASH THERE.                    
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF TRAFFIC   
SOMETIMES AND WE HAVE A         

01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:54.692
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF TRAFFIC   
SOMETIMES AND WE HAVE A         
MULTIPLE LANE ROAD.             

01:12:54.694 --> 01:12:55.559
SOMETIMES AND WE HAVE A         
MULTIPLE LANE ROAD.             
WE'RE OFTEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

01:12:55.561 --> 01:12:56.227
MULTIPLE LANE ROAD.             
WE'RE OFTEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
MULTIPOINT CRASH OR THE DUAL    

01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:58.262
WE'RE OFTEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
MULTIPOINT CRASH OR THE DUAL    
THREAT CRASH ON A LITTLE ROAD.  

01:12:58.264 --> 01:12:59.230
MULTIPOINT CRASH OR THE DUAL    
THREAT CRASH ON A LITTLE ROAD.  
SO THE IDEA THERE IS THAT ONE   

01:12:59.232 --> 01:13:01.665
THREAT CRASH ON A LITTLE ROAD.  
SO THE IDEA THERE IS THAT ONE   
CAR STOPS AND YIELDS WHICH      

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:02.432
SO THE IDEA THERE IS THAT ONE   
CAR STOPS AND YIELDS WHICH      
SOMETIMES BLOCKS THE VIEW       

01:13:02.434 --> 01:13:05.470
CAR STOPS AND YIELDS WHICH      
SOMETIMES BLOCKS THE VIEW       
OF THE OTHER APPROACHING LANE   

01:13:05.472 --> 01:13:06.470
SOMETIMES BLOCKS THE VIEW       
OF THE OTHER APPROACHING LANE   
OF TRAVEL AND THAT OTHER LANE   

01:13:06.472 --> 01:13:09.573
OF THE OTHER APPROACHING LANE   
OF TRAVEL AND THAT OTHER LANE   
OF TRAVEL DOES NOT STOP TO      

01:13:09.575 --> 01:13:10.374
OF TRAVEL AND THAT OTHER LANE   
OF TRAVEL DOES NOT STOP TO      
PEDESTRIANS OR CYCLISTS THAT    

01:13:10.376 --> 01:13:10.708
OF TRAVEL DOES NOT STOP TO      
PEDESTRIANS OR CYCLISTS THAT    
ARE CROSSING.                   

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:14.045
PEDESTRIANS OR CYCLISTS THAT    
ARE CROSSING.                   
HOWEVER, THIS CRASH HAPPENED AT 

01:13:14.047 --> 01:13:16.680
ARE CROSSING.                   
HOWEVER, THIS CRASH HAPPENED AT 
WYNWOOD AND NOT AT THE RV AND   

01:13:16.682 --> 01:13:17.615
HOWEVER, THIS CRASH HAPPENED AT 
WYNWOOD AND NOT AT THE RV AND   
SO AND THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC    

01:13:17.617 --> 01:13:21.519
WYNWOOD AND NOT AT THE RV AND   
SO AND THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC    
OUT THERE WE SUSPECTED SO EARLY 

01:13:21.521 --> 01:13:22.319
SO AND THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC    
OUT THERE WE SUSPECTED SO EARLY 
IN THE MORNING THAT THERE       

01:13:22.321 --> 01:13:22.987
OUT THERE WE SUSPECTED SO EARLY 
IN THE MORNING THAT THERE       
PROBABLY WEREN'T MULTIPLE LANES 

01:13:22.989 --> 01:13:24.788
IN THE MORNING THAT THERE       
PROBABLY WEREN'T MULTIPLE LANES 
OF TRAFFIC GOING SIMULTANEOUSLY 

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:25.589
PROBABLY WEREN'T MULTIPLE LANES 
OF TRAFFIC GOING SIMULTANEOUSLY 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO    

01:13:25.591 --> 01:13:28.659
OF TRAFFIC GOING SIMULTANEOUSLY 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO    
VALIDATE THAT CERTAIN BECAUSE   

01:13:28.661 --> 01:13:29.527
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO    
VALIDATE THAT CERTAIN BECAUSE   
WE DON'T HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE OR  

01:13:29.529 --> 01:13:32.763
VALIDATE THAT CERTAIN BECAUSE   
WE DON'T HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE OR  
WE CAN'T CREATE AN EXACT        

01:13:32.765 --> 01:13:36.567
WE DON'T HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE OR  
WE CAN'T CREATE AN EXACT        
CONDITION OF WHAT HAPPENED.     

01:13:36.569 --> 01:13:37.568
WE CAN'T CREATE AN EXACT        
CONDITION OF WHAT HAPPENED.     
SO WE OBVIOUSLY LOOKED AT IT    

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:40.037
CONDITION OF WHAT HAPPENED.     
SO WE OBVIOUSLY LOOKED AT IT    
FOR SOME OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE  

01:13:40.039 --> 01:13:43.508
SO WE OBVIOUSLY LOOKED AT IT    
FOR SOME OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE  
PIECES AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IN   

01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:44.308
FOR SOME OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE  
PIECES AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IN   
TERMS OF LONGER TERM PROGRAMING 

01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:48.245
PIECES AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IN   
TERMS OF LONGER TERM PROGRAMING 
IMPROVEMENTS, YOU KNOW, WE      

01:13:48.247 --> 01:13:48.746
TERMS OF LONGER TERM PROGRAMING 
IMPROVEMENTS, YOU KNOW, WE      
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING            

01:13:48.748 --> 01:13:51.415
IMPROVEMENTS, YOU KNOW, WE      
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING            
IMMEDIATELY PROGRAMED FOR THAT  

01:13:51.417 --> 01:13:55.085
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING            
IMMEDIATELY PROGRAMED FOR THAT  
LOCATION BASED ON WHAT WE WERE  

01:13:55.087 --> 01:13:55.619
IMMEDIATELY PROGRAMED FOR THAT  
LOCATION BASED ON WHAT WE WERE  
ABLE TO DETERMINE.              

01:13:55.621 --> 01:13:59.756
LOCATION BASED ON WHAT WE WERE  
ABLE TO DETERMINE.              
BUT WE KNOW KNOWING WHAT WE     

01:13:59.758 --> 01:14:00.491
ABLE TO DETERMINE.              
BUT WE KNOW KNOWING WHAT WE     
KNOW NOW AND WE'RE COUNCIL'S    

01:14:00.493 --> 01:14:01.092
BUT WE KNOW KNOWING WHAT WE     
KNOW NOW AND WE'RE COUNCIL'S    
PRIORITIES ARE WE LOOK AT       

01:14:01.094 --> 01:14:06.430
KNOW NOW AND WE'RE COUNCIL'S    
PRIORITIES ARE WE LOOK AT       
THINGS LIKE THE THE THE ROAD    

01:14:06.432 --> 01:14:07.364
PRIORITIES ARE WE LOOK AT       
THINGS LIKE THE THE THE ROAD    
RESOLUTION FROM COUNCIL TO LOOK 

01:14:07.366 --> 01:14:08.032
THINGS LIKE THE THE THE ROAD    
RESOLUTION FROM COUNCIL TO LOOK 
AT ALL MULTI-LINE ROADS AND SEE 

01:14:08.034 --> 01:14:10.834
RESOLUTION FROM COUNCIL TO LOOK 
AT ALL MULTI-LINE ROADS AND SEE 
IF THEY'RE APPROPRIATE FOR ROAD 

01:14:10.836 --> 01:14:11.168
AT ALL MULTI-LINE ROADS AND SEE 
IF THEY'RE APPROPRIATE FOR ROAD 
DIETS.                          

01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.169
IF THEY'RE APPROPRIATE FOR ROAD 
DIETS.                          
AND SO, YOU KNOW, A LOT         

01:14:12.171 --> 01:14:12.836
DIETS.                          
AND SO, YOU KNOW, A LOT         
OF THESE CRASHES THAT MIGHT     

01:14:12.838 --> 01:14:15.172
AND SO, YOU KNOW, A LOT         
OF THESE CRASHES THAT MIGHT     
HAPPEN ON THE ROADS WILL BE     

01:14:15.174 --> 01:14:19.042
OF THESE CRASHES THAT MIGHT     
HAPPEN ON THE ROADS WILL BE     
ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE ROAD DIET 

01:14:19.044 --> 01:14:21.878
HAPPEN ON THE ROADS WILL BE     
ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE ROAD DIET 
AND THEN THAT COULD BE A        

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.713
ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE ROAD DIET 
AND THEN THAT COULD BE A        
SOLUTION SET IN IN THOSE        

01:14:22.715 --> 01:14:26.116
AND THEN THAT COULD BE A        
SOLUTION SET IN IN THOSE        
CIRCUMSTANCES.                  

01:14:26.118 --> 01:14:27.051
SOLUTION SET IN IN THOSE        
CIRCUMSTANCES.                  
SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT 

01:14:27.053 --> 01:14:29.886
CIRCUMSTANCES.                  
SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT 
POPS IN MY MIND IN TERMS OF THE

SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT 
POPS IN MY MIND IN TERMS OF THE

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.747
WHAT ARE WHAT ARE ON OUR TIER   
ONE AND TIER TWO CORRIDORS WHEN 
I SAY THAT THOSE ARE CORRIDORS  

01:14:56.749 --> 01:14:57.581
ONE AND TIER TWO CORRIDORS WHEN 
I SAY THAT THOSE ARE CORRIDORS  
IN OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT 

01:14:57.583 --> 01:14:59.850
I SAY THAT THOSE ARE CORRIDORS  
IN OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT 
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AREAS   

01:14:59.852 --> 01:15:00.651
IN OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT 
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AREAS   
OF FOCUS FOR SAFETY, THOSE      

01:15:00.653 --> 01:15:04.255
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AREAS   
OF FOCUS FOR SAFETY, THOSE      
AREAS OF FOCUS ARE AREAS THAT   

01:15:04.257 --> 01:15:05.055
OF FOCUS FOR SAFETY, THOSE      
AREAS OF FOCUS ARE AREAS THAT   
WE REALLY WANT TO CONCENTRATE   

01:15:05.057 --> 01:15:07.691
AREAS OF FOCUS ARE AREAS THAT   
WE REALLY WANT TO CONCENTRATE   
OUR SPEED MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ON 

01:15:07.693 --> 01:15:08.359
WE REALLY WANT TO CONCENTRATE   
OUR SPEED MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ON 
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY       

01:15:08.361 --> 01:15:08.692
OUR SPEED MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ON 
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY       
RIGHT.                          

01:15:08.694 --> 01:15:09.493
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY       
RIGHT.                          
I MEAN SPEED IS THE LEADING     

01:15:09.495 --> 01:15:12.329
RIGHT.                          
I MEAN SPEED IS THE LEADING     
INDICATION ABOUT SEVERITY       

01:15:12.331 --> 01:15:12.729
I MEAN SPEED IS THE LEADING     
INDICATION ABOUT SEVERITY       
OF CRASHES.                     

01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:13.563
INDICATION ABOUT SEVERITY       
OF CRASHES.                     
I THINK BOTH LIEUTENANT SHIRRA  

01:15:13.565 --> 01:15:16.667
OF CRASHES.                     
I THINK BOTH LIEUTENANT SHIRRA  
AND HEAD ON A GOOD POINT WHICH  

01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:17.401
I THINK BOTH LIEUTENANT SHIRRA  
AND HEAD ON A GOOD POINT WHICH  
IS VISION ZERO JUST TO          

01:15:17.403 --> 01:15:20.004
AND HEAD ON A GOOD POINT WHICH  
IS VISION ZERO JUST TO          
REEMPHASIZE THE POINT YOU'VE    

01:15:20.006 --> 01:15:20.871
IS VISION ZERO JUST TO          
REEMPHASIZE THE POINT YOU'VE    
MADE BEFORE DOES NOT SUGGEST    

01:15:20.873 --> 01:15:23.073
REEMPHASIZE THE POINT YOU'VE    
MADE BEFORE DOES NOT SUGGEST    
THERE WILL BE NO CRASHES.       

01:15:23.075 --> 01:15:24.141
MADE BEFORE DOES NOT SUGGEST    
THERE WILL BE NO CRASHES.       
AS A MATTER OF FACT, INHERENT   

01:15:24.143 --> 01:15:24.875
THERE WILL BE NO CRASHES.       
AS A MATTER OF FACT, INHERENT   
IN VISION ZERO IS AN            

01:15:24.877 --> 01:15:27.445
AS A MATTER OF FACT, INHERENT   
IN VISION ZERO IS AN            
IMPLICATION THAT CRASHES WILL   

01:15:27.447 --> 01:15:27.979
IN VISION ZERO IS AN            
IMPLICATION THAT CRASHES WILL   
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.             

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:31.482
IMPLICATION THAT CRASHES WILL   
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.             
BUT THE THE REAL ACTION THERE   

01:15:31.484 --> 01:15:32.483
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.             
BUT THE THE REAL ACTION THERE   
IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO REDUCE THE 

01:15:32.485 --> 01:15:34.985
BUT THE THE REAL ACTION THERE   
IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO REDUCE THE 
SEVERITY OF THOSE CRASHES?      

01:15:34.987 --> 01:15:36.220
IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO REDUCE THE 
SEVERITY OF THOSE CRASHES?      
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE     

01:15:36.222 --> 01:15:36.787
SEVERITY OF THOSE CRASHES?      
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE     
THAT THEY ARE THEY DO NOT       

01:15:36.789 --> 01:15:37.621
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE     
THAT THEY ARE THEY DO NOT       
RESULT IN FATALITIES AND DO NOT 

01:15:37.623 --> 01:15:39.256
THAT THEY ARE THEY DO NOT       
RESULT IN FATALITIES AND DO NOT 
RESULT IN SERIOUS               

01:15:39.258 --> 01:15:39.957
RESULT IN FATALITIES AND DO NOT 
RESULT IN SERIOUS               
INCAPACITATING INJURIES AND     

01:15:39.959 --> 01:15:43.594
RESULT IN SERIOUS               
INCAPACITATING INJURIES AND     
REALLY SPEED IS AT THE CRUX     

01:15:43.596 --> 01:15:44.361
INCAPACITATING INJURIES AND     
REALLY SPEED IS AT THE CRUX     
OF THAT DISCUSSION AND SO       

01:15:44.363 --> 01:15:47.731
REALLY SPEED IS AT THE CRUX     
OF THAT DISCUSSION AND SO       
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING  

01:15:47.733 --> 01:15:48.465
OF THAT DISCUSSION AND SO       
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING  
TO TRY TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME    

01:15:48.467 --> 01:15:48.732
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING  
TO TRY TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME    
ON.                             

01:15:48.734 --> 01:15:51.102
TO TRY TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME    
ON.                             
THAT'S WHY WE ARE INCORPORATING 

01:15:51.104 --> 01:15:51.802
ON.                             
THAT'S WHY WE ARE INCORPORATING 
THINGS LIKE SPEED MANAGEMENT    

01:15:51.804 --> 01:15:55.138
THAT'S WHY WE ARE INCORPORATING 
THINGS LIKE SPEED MANAGEMENT    
INTO THE MILLER AFROJACK THAT   

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:56.240
THINGS LIKE SPEED MANAGEMENT    
INTO THE MILLER AFROJACK THAT   
IS AN ARTERIAL THIS WILL BE ONE 

01:15:56.242 --> 01:15:56.907
INTO THE MILLER AFROJACK THAT   
IS AN ARTERIAL THIS WILL BE ONE 
OF THE FIRST QUARTERS WE'VE     

01:15:56.909 --> 01:15:59.577
IS AN ARTERIAL THIS WILL BE ONE 
OF THE FIRST QUARTERS WE'VE     
EVER PUT SORT OF TRAFFIC        

01:15:59.579 --> 01:16:00.310
OF THE FIRST QUARTERS WE'VE     
EVER PUT SORT OF TRAFFIC        
CALMING OR SPEED MANAGEMENT     

01:16:00.312 --> 01:16:03.113
EVER PUT SORT OF TRAFFIC        
CALMING OR SPEED MANAGEMENT     
ELEMENTS INTO AN ARTERIAL.      

01:16:03.115 --> 01:16:05.982
CALMING OR SPEED MANAGEMENT     
ELEMENTS INTO AN ARTERIAL.      
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE AND    

01:16:05.984 --> 01:16:06.951
ELEMENTS INTO AN ARTERIAL.      
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE AND    
AGAIN MILLER IS A QUARTER THAT  

01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:07.685
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE AND    
AGAIN MILLER IS A QUARTER THAT  
DID EXPERIENCE A PEDESTRIAN     

01:16:07.687 --> 01:16:10.687
AGAIN MILLER IS A QUARTER THAT  
DID EXPERIENCE A PEDESTRIAN     
FATALITY SEVERAL YEARS AGO,     

01:16:10.689 --> 01:16:11.655
DID EXPERIENCE A PEDESTRIAN     
FATALITY SEVERAL YEARS AGO,     
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 

01:16:11.657 --> 01:16:12.322
FATALITY SEVERAL YEARS AGO,     
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT     

01:16:12.324 --> 01:16:15.425
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT     
THAT CAPITAL PROJECT INCLUDED   

01:16:15.427 --> 01:16:16.193
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT     
THAT CAPITAL PROJECT INCLUDED   
THOSE SORT OF TRAFFIC CALMING   

01:16:16.195 --> 01:16:19.196
THAT CAPITAL PROJECT INCLUDED   
THOSE SORT OF TRAFFIC CALMING   
AND SPEED MANAGEMENT MEASURES.  

01:16:19.198 --> 01:16:20.264
THOSE SORT OF TRAFFIC CALMING   
AND SPEED MANAGEMENT MEASURES.  
SO THAT'S A LONG WINDED WAY     

01:16:20.266 --> 01:16:22.365
AND SPEED MANAGEMENT MEASURES.  
SO THAT'S A LONG WINDED WAY     
OF SAYING THAT SOME OF THOSE    

01:16:22.367 --> 01:16:23.134
SO THAT'S A LONG WINDED WAY     
OF SAYING THAT SOME OF THOSE    
CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR    

01:16:23.136 --> 01:16:26.670
OF SAYING THAT SOME OF THOSE    
CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR    
IMMEDIATE BUT SOME OF OUR YOU   

01:16:26.672 --> 01:16:27.370
CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR    
IMMEDIATE BUT SOME OF OUR YOU   
KNOW, TAKE SOME PROGRAMING,     

01:16:27.372 --> 01:16:28.138

TAKE FUNDING, TAKE WHATEVER THE 
CASE MAY BE AND THEY DO FACTOR  

01:16:31.043 --> 01:16:34.144
TAKE FUNDING, TAKE WHATEVER THE 
CASE MAY BE AND THEY DO FACTOR  
INTO A LOT OF OUR PROJECT       

01:16:34.146 --> 01:16:34.578
CASE MAY BE AND THEY DO FACTOR  
INTO A LOT OF OUR PROJECT
