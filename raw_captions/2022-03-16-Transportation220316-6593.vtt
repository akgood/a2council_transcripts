00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.177
ONE IDEA IS MOVING AT           
CROSSWALKS FURTHER FROM THE     
INTERSECTIONS SO THE ISLANDS    

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:28.045
CROSSWALKS FURTHER FROM THE     
INTERSECTIONS SO THE ISLANDS    
CAN BE ADDED WITHOUT INHIBITING 

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:28.446
INTERSECTIONS SO THE ISLANDS    
CAN BE ADDED WITHOUT INHIBITING 
LEFT TURNS.                     

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:32.149
CAN BE ADDED WITHOUT INHIBITING 
LEFT TURNS.

LEFT TURNS.                     
ANOTHER PROPOSAL IS COMBINING   
THE BIKE LANES INTO A SINGLE    

00:07:33.018 --> 00:07:33.851
ANOTHER PROPOSAL IS COMBINING   
THE BIKE LANES INTO A SINGLE    
BIDIRECTIONAL TRACK WHICH WOULD 

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:36.019
THE BIKE LANES INTO A SINGLE    
BIDIRECTIONAL TRACK WHICH WOULD 
TAKE LESS ROOM THEREBY LEAVING  

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:36.853
BIDIRECTIONAL TRACK WHICH WOULD 
TAKE LESS ROOM THEREBY LEAVING  
WIDTH THAT CAN BE USED FOR      

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.456
TAKE LESS ROOM THEREBY LEAVING  
WIDTH THAT CAN BE USED FOR      
REFUGE ISLAND.                  

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:40.324

THEY WOULDN&amp;apos;T BE REFUGE ISLANDS 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.196
AWAY FROM THE INTERSECTIONS.    
THEY WOULDN&amp;apos;T BE REFUGE ISLANDS 
BUT THEY WOULD MAKE PASSING IN  

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.731
THEY WOULDN&amp;apos;T BE REFUGE ISLANDS 
BUT THEY WOULD MAKE PASSING IN  
THE CENTER LANE MUCH LESS       

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:50.301
BUT THEY WOULD MAKE PASSING IN  
THE CENTER LANE MUCH LESS       
ATTRACTIVE TO IMPATIENT DRIVERS

THERE&amp;apos;S DIFFERENT MODULES       
WITHIN KLEMENS THAT DO          

00:26:54.178 --> 00:26:54.644
THERE&amp;apos;S DIFFERENT MODULES

WITHIN KLEMENS THAT DO          
DIFFERENT THINGS.               
THE ONE WE USE IS CALLED LAW    

00:26:57.749 --> 00:26:58.548
DIFFERENT THINGS.               
THE ONE WE USE IS CALLED LAW    
THAT CAPTURES THAT DATA TO      

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.117
THE ONE WE USE IS CALLED LAW    
THAT CAPTURES THAT DATA TO      
CREATE OUR OWN DATA THAT WOULD  

00:27:02.119 --> 00:27:06.188
THAT CAPTURES THAT DATA TO      
CREATE OUR OWN DATA THAT WOULD  
BE NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTIZE AND 

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.625
CREATE OUR OWN DATA THAT WOULD  
BE NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTIZE AND 
WHAT THAT WOULD REALLY ENTAIL.  

00:27:09.627 --> 00:27:12.828
BE NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTIZE AND 
WHAT THAT WOULD REALLY ENTAIL.  
BUT ARE WE GOING TO ASK WHAT IT 

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.498
WHAT THAT WOULD REALLY ENTAIL.  
BUT ARE WE GOING TO ASK WHAT IT 
WAS LIKE LIKE THE OLD COMPUTER  

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.567
BUT ARE WE GOING TO ASK WHAT IT 
WAS LIKE LIKE THE OLD COMPUTER  
SAYS LIKE WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT  

00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:18.434
WAS LIKE LIKE THE OLD COMPUTER  
SAYS LIKE WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT  
YOU GET WHEN IT TURNED OUT TO   

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:21.136
SAYS LIKE WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT  
YOU GET WHEN IT TURNED OUT TO   
BE REALLY WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT  

00:27:21.138 --> 00:27:21.470
YOU GET WHEN IT TURNED OUT TO   
BE REALLY WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT  
YOU GET.                        

00:27:21.472 --> 00:27:22.405
BE REALLY WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT  
YOU GET.                        
IT MIGHT BE THAT WHAT WE GET IS 

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:24.073
YOU GET.                        
IT MIGHT BE THAT WHAT WE GET IS 
WHAT WE GET WHEN IT&amp;apos;S SAID AND  

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:24.407
IT MIGHT BE THAT WHAT WE GET IS 
WHAT WE GET WHEN IT&amp;apos;S SAID AND  
DONE.                           

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:25.341
WHAT WE GET WHEN IT&amp;apos;S SAID AND  
DONE.                           
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET ANY   

00:27:25.343 --> 00:27:26.208
DONE.                           
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET ANY   
MORE OUT OF THIS THAN WHAT WE   

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:31.680
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET ANY   
MORE OUT OF THIS THAN WHAT WE   
CURRENTLY HAVE.                 

00:27:31.682 --> 00:27:32.582
MORE OUT OF THIS THAN WHAT WE   
CURRENTLY HAVE.                 
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT MIGHT    

00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:33.382
CURRENTLY HAVE.                 
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT MIGHT    
END UP BEING A LARGER           

00:27:33.384 --> 00:27:36.252
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT MIGHT

SO TYPICALLY WHENEVER A         

01:01:15.604 --> 01:01:18.372
PROJECT.                        
SO TYPICALLY WHENEVER A         
VERTICAL ELEMENT IS INCLUDED    

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.306
SO TYPICALLY WHENEVER A         
VERTICAL ELEMENT IS INCLUDED    
YOU NEED TO HAVE A SHY          

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:19.806
VERTICAL ELEMENT IS INCLUDED    
YOU NEED TO HAVE A SHY          
DISTANCE, RIGHT.                

01:01:19.808 --> 01:01:20.541
YOU NEED TO HAVE A SHY          
DISTANCE, RIGHT.                
SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE BIKING  

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:22.743
DISTANCE, RIGHT.                
SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE BIKING  
THEY DON&amp;apos;T FEEL THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING   

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:23.610
SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE BIKING  
THEY DON&amp;apos;T FEEL THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING   
TO HIT THEIR HANDLEBARS ON IT.  

01:01:23.612 --> 01:01:26.713
THEY DON&amp;apos;T FEEL THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING   
TO HIT THEIR HANDLEBARS ON IT.  
SO YOU KNOW, BASED ON THE       

01:01:26.715 --> 01:01:27.281
TO HIT THEIR HANDLEBARS ON IT.  
SO YOU KNOW, BASED ON THE       
DESCRIPTION I THINK THERE       

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:30.718
SO YOU KNOW, BASED ON THE       
DESCRIPTION I THINK THERE       
PROBABLY ISN&amp;apos;T ENOUGH WIDTH TO  

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.052
DESCRIPTION I THINK THERE       
PROBABLY ISN&amp;apos;T ENOUGH WIDTH TO  
PUT IN.                         

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.219
PROBABLY ISN&amp;apos;T ENOUGH WIDTH TO  
PUT IN.                         
YOU WOULD NEED THE BUFFER AS    

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:35.389
PUT IN.                         
YOU WOULD NEED THE BUFFER AS    
WELL AS THE VERTICAL ELEMENTS   

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:36.123
YOU WOULD NEED THE BUFFER AS    
WELL AS THE VERTICAL ELEMENTS   
IN THE BUFFER TO STILL MAINTAIN 

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.425
WELL AS THE VERTICAL ELEMENTS   
IN THE BUFFER TO STILL MAINTAIN 
THAT DISTANCE FROM THE VERTICAL 

01:01:38.427 --> 01:01:38.825
IN THE BUFFER TO STILL MAINTAIN 
THAT DISTANCE FROM THE VERTICAL 
ELEMENT.                        

01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:39.926
THAT DISTANCE FROM THE VERTICAL 
ELEMENT.                        
SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S JUST A FUNCTION 

01:01:39.928 --> 01:01:42.729
ELEMENT.                        
SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S JUST A FUNCTION 
OF THAT CENTER TURN.            

01:01:42.731 --> 01:01:43.697
SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S JUST A FUNCTION 
OF THAT CENTER TURN.            
DAVE, I&amp;apos;M GOING TO SPECULATE    

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:46.367
OF THAT CENTER TURN.            
DAVE, I&amp;apos;M GOING TO SPECULATE    
HERE WAS PROBABLY 10 FEET WIDE  

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.568
DAVE, I&amp;apos;M GOING TO SPECULATE    
HERE WAS PROBABLY 10 FEET WIDE  
AND SO WE JUST KIND OF SPLIT    

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:50.737
HERE WAS PROBABLY 10 FEET WIDE  
AND SO WE JUST KIND OF SPLIT    
THE BABY INTO WE CUT IT HALF    

01:01:50.739 --> 01:01:51.405
AND SO WE JUST KIND OF SPLIT    
THE BABY INTO WE CUT IT HALF    
PUT THOSE FIVE FEET ON EACH     

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:54.441
THE BABY INTO WE CUT IT HALF    
PUT THOSE FIVE FEET ON EACH     
SIDE AGAINST THE CURB AND THOSE 

01:01:54.443 --> 01:01:55.343
PUT THOSE FIVE FEET ON EACH     
SIDE AGAINST THE CURB AND THOSE 
ARE THE BIKE LANES BUT THERE IS 

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:56.143
SIDE AGAINST THE CURB AND THOSE 
ARE THE BIKE LANES BUT THERE IS 
NOT MUCH MORE ROOM TO SPARE     

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:59.012
ARE THE BIKE LANES BUT THERE IS 
NOT MUCH MORE ROOM TO SPARE     
BEYOND THAT IS A FAIR GUESS,    

01:01:59.014 --> 01:01:59.346
NOT MUCH MORE ROOM TO SPARE
