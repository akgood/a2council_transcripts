01:20:42.014 --> 01:20:44.714
WHETHER YOU&amp;apos;RE ALSO ASKING FOR  
A SWAP ANALYSIS SO WE CAN       
UNDERSTAND AND UNDERSTAND THE   

01:20:44.716 --> 01:20:45.415
A SWAP ANALYSIS SO WE CAN       
UNDERSTAND AND UNDERSTAND THE   
STRENGTHS OF THIS APPROACH, THE

WEAKNESSES, THE OPPORTUNITIES   
AND THE POTENTIAL THREATS THAT  
WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF SHOULD   

01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:52.789
AND THE POTENTIAL THREATS THAT  
WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF SHOULD   
BE PUT ON US AT THE SEIU WE ARE 

01:20:52.791 --> 01:20:53.524
WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF SHOULD   
BE PUT ON US AT THE SEIU WE ARE 
GETTING VERY SIMILAR THINGS SO  

01:20:53.526 --> 01:20:56.460
BE PUT ON US AT THE SEIU WE ARE 
GETTING VERY SIMILAR THINGS SO  
WE&amp;apos;RE GETTING OPERATIONAL AND   

01:20:56.462 --> 01:20:57.060
GETTING VERY SIMILAR THINGS SO  
WE&amp;apos;RE GETTING OPERATIONAL AND   
GOVERNANCE MODEL.

GOVERNANCE MODEL.               
WE&amp;apos;RE GETTING THE REVENUE       
REQUIREMENTS, THE FINANCIAL     

01:20:59.365 --> 01:21:00.097
WE&amp;apos;RE GETTING THE REVENUE

01:21:03.402 --> 01:21:04.334
ASSESSMENT AND THE COST         
OF SERVICE RATE DECLINE.        
SO THESE THINGS ARE ALL REALLY  

01:21:04.336 --> 01:21:07.270
OF SERVICE RATE DECLINE.        
SO THESE THINGS ARE ALL REALLY  
COMPARABLE AND WHAT I HOPE IS A 

01:21:07.272 --> 01:21:08.338
SO THESE THINGS ARE ALL REALLY  
COMPARABLE AND WHAT I HOPE IS A 
MEAN TAKE AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS 

01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.342
COMPARABLE AND WHAT I HOPE IS A 
MEAN TAKE AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS 
IS THAT THE PRIMARY PRODUCT I   

01:21:11.344 --> 01:21:12.209
MEAN TAKE AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS 
IS THAT THE PRIMARY PRODUCT I   
AM MOST EXCITED ABOUT IS HAVING 

01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:15.145
IS THAT THE PRIMARY PRODUCT I   
AM MOST EXCITED ABOUT IS HAVING 
A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE   

01:21:15.147 --> 01:21:15.946
AM MOST EXCITED ABOUT IS HAVING 
A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE   
DIFFERENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO  

01:21:15.948 --> 01:21:16.847
A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE   
DIFFERENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO  
US TO ACHIEVE OUR TWO ZERO GOAL

DIFFERENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO  
US TO ACHIEVE OUR TWO ZERO GOAL 
WHICH POWERING OUR COMMUNITY    

01:21:18.784 --> 01:21:19.449
US TO ACHIEVE OUR TWO ZERO GOAL 
WHICH POWERING OUR COMMUNITY    
WITH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT

WITH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT        
RENEWABLE ENERGY.               
AND THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US   

01:21:22.521 --> 01:21:23.520
RENEWABLE ENERGY.               
AND THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US   
TO HAVE AN APPLES TO APPLES     

01:21:23.522 --> 01:21:24.121
AND THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US   
TO HAVE AN APPLES TO APPLES     
COMPARISON OF THOSE DIFFERENT   

01:21:24.123 --> 01:21:24.588
TO HAVE AN APPLES TO APPLES

WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE A PROCESS  

01:24:59.071 --> 01:24:59.803
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.           
WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE A PROCESS

WE WOULD OWN AN ENERGY UTILITY  

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.647
OUR AGE TO ZERO.                
WE WOULD OWN AN ENERGY UTILITY  
BUT WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T FUNDAMENTALLY    

01:25:10.649 --> 01:25:11.447
WE WOULD OWN AN ENERGY UTILITY  
BUT WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T FUNDAMENTALLY    
SHIFTED THE ELECTRONS AND MADE  

01:25:11.449 --> 01:25:11.848
BUT WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T FUNDAMENTALLY

SHIFTED THE ELECTRONS AND MADE  
THEM GREEN YET.                 
SO THAT HAS TO BE FACTORED INTO

THEM GREEN YET.                 
SO THAT HAS TO BE FACTORED INTO 
THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS WHAT WE   

01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:17.854
SO THAT HAS TO BE FACTORED INTO

THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS WHAT WE

WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO DO THE SAME FOR  

01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:19.756
ARE ASKING FOR ON THIS SIDE.    
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO DO THE SAME FOR  
THE EU IN A MINUTE AND I DON&amp;apos;T

THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF THE

OVERWHELMING.                   
THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF THE       
PROCESS SO BEAR WITH ME HERE.   

01:25:26.031 --> 01:25:27.430
THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF THE       
PROCESS SO BEAR WITH ME HERE.   
THIS IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT I DID 

01:25:27.432 --> 01:25:29.800
PROCESS SO BEAR WITH ME HERE.   
THIS IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT I DID 
POLAKOFF VOTING AND TIMELINE    

01:25:29.802 --> 01:25:33.203
THIS IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT I DID 
POLAKOFF VOTING AND TIMELINE    
ESTIMATES AND BUDGET ESTIMATES  

01:25:33.205 --> 01:25:34.103
POLAKOFF VOTING AND TIMELINE    
ESTIMATES AND BUDGET ESTIMATES  
AND THEY ARE THAT SIMPLE        

01:25:34.105 --> 01:25:37.674
ESTIMATES AND BUDGET ESTIMATES  
AND THEY ARE THAT SIMPLE        
ESTIMATES MANY OF THE THINGS ON 

01:25:37.676 --> 01:25:38.342
AND THEY ARE THAT SIMPLE        
ESTIMATES MANY OF THE THINGS ON 
THE SLIDE COULD BE FASTER.      

01:25:38.344 --> 01:25:39.409
ESTIMATES MANY OF THE THINGS ON 
THE SLIDE COULD BE FASTER.      
MANY OF THEM MAY TAKE MUCH      

01:25:39.411 --> 01:25:41.411
THE SLIDE COULD BE FASTER.      
MANY OF THEM MAY TAKE MUCH      
LONGER.                         

01:25:41.413 --> 01:25:42.212
MANY OF THEM MAY TAKE MUCH      
LONGER.                         
MANY THINGS MAY BE CHEAPER,     

01:25:42.214 --> 01:25:42.979
LONGER.                         
MANY THINGS MAY BE CHEAPER,     
SOME THINGS CAN BE SEQUENCED    

01:25:42.981 --> 01:25:44.414
MANY THINGS MAY BE CHEAPER,     
SOME THINGS CAN BE SEQUENCED    
TOGETHER.                       

01:25:44.416 --> 01:25:45.549
SOME THINGS CAN BE SEQUENCED    
TOGETHER.                       
SOME THINGS MAY BE FAR MORE     

01:25:45.551 --> 01:25:46.183
TOGETHER.                       
SOME THINGS MAY BE FAR MORE     
EXPENSIVE THAN ESTIMATED.       

01:25:46.185 --> 01:25:49.118
SOME THINGS MAY BE FAR MORE     
EXPENSIVE THAN ESTIMATED.       
BUT THIS IS BASED ON A LOOK AT  

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:49.819
EXPENSIVE THAN ESTIMATED.       
BUT THIS IS BASED ON A LOOK AT  
WHAT OUR PEER COMMUNITIES HAVE  

01:25:49.821 --> 01:25:52.321
BUT THIS IS BASED ON A LOOK AT  
WHAT OUR PEER COMMUNITIES HAVE  
DONE AND INVESTED IN MUNICIPALS 

01:25:52.323 --> 01:25:53.022
WHAT OUR PEER COMMUNITIES HAVE  
DONE AND INVESTED IN MUNICIPALS 
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE LAST     

01:25:53.024 --> 01:25:56.426
DONE AND INVESTED IN MUNICIPALS 
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE LAST     
MUNICIPAL UTILITY FORMED IN     

01:25:56.428 --> 01:25:57.160
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE LAST     
MUNICIPAL UTILITY FORMED IN     
MICHIGAN WAS IN 1992.           

01:25:57.162 --> 01:26:00.463
MUNICIPAL UTILITY FORMED IN     
MICHIGAN WAS IN 1992.           
SO WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL 

01:26:00.465 --> 01:26:01.197
MICHIGAN WAS IN 1992.           
SO WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL 
PRECEDENT TO GO AFTER.          

01:26:01.199 --> 01:26:01.999
SO WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL 
PRECEDENT TO GO AFTER.          
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TO LOOK IN OTHER      

01:26:02.001 --> 01:26:04.700
PRECEDENT TO GO AFTER.          
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TO LOOK IN OTHER      
PLACES AND OTHER PLACES HAVE    

01:26:04.702 --> 01:26:05.202
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TO LOOK IN OTHER      
PLACES AND OTHER PLACES HAVE    
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.           

01:26:05.204 --> 01:26:06.069
PLACES AND OTHER PLACES HAVE    
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.           
THEY HAVE A FRANCHISE THAT THEY 

01:26:06.071 --> 01:26:08.705
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.           
THEY HAVE A FRANCHISE THAT THEY 
CAN NEGOTIATE AROUND.           

01:26:08.707 --> 01:26:09.239
THEY HAVE A FRANCHISE THAT THEY 
CAN NEGOTIATE AROUND.           
WE DO NOT.                      

01:26:09.241 --> 01:26:10.173
CAN NEGOTIATE AROUND.           
WE DO NOT.                      
SO THESE AGAIN ARE BUDGET       

01:26:10.175 --> 01:26:13.110
WE DO NOT.                      
SO THESE AGAIN ARE BUDGET       
ESTIMATES JUST TO HELP INFORM   

01:26:13.112 --> 01:26:13.843
SO THESE AGAIN ARE BUDGET

NINE MONTHS.                    
WE&amp;apos;LL HAVE THE RESULTS OF THAT

01:26:56.754 --> 01:26:58.855
                             .  
THIS IS A MUCH MORE DETAILED    
ANALYSIS WHERE WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING AT 

01:26:58.857 --> 01:26:59.523
THIS IS A MUCH MORE DETAILED    
ANALYSIS WHERE WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING AT 
ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO       

01:26:59.525 --> 01:27:00.190
ANALYSIS WHERE WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING AT 
ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO       
UNDERSTAND ITS QUALITY WHERE WE 

01:27:00.192 --> 01:27:00.991
ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO       
UNDERSTAND ITS QUALITY WHERE WE 
NEED TO MAKE UPGRADES AND SO    

01:27:00.993 --> 01:27:01.591
UNDERSTAND ITS QUALITY WHERE WE 
NEED TO MAKE UPGRADES AND SO    
WE&amp;apos;RE BASICALLY TAKING THAT     

01:27:01.593 --> 01:27:02.391
NEED TO MAKE UPGRADES AND SO    
WE&amp;apos;RE BASICALLY TAKING THAT     
BIGGER AREA AND WE&amp;apos;RE SHRINKING 

01:27:02.393 --> 01:27:02.658
WE&amp;apos;RE BASICALLY TAKING THAT     
BIGGER AREA AND WE&amp;apos;RE SHRINKING 
IT.                             

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:03.393
BIGGER AREA AND WE&amp;apos;RE SHRINKING 
IT.                             
SO WE&amp;apos;RE GETTING KIND OF A MUCH 

01:27:03.395 --> 01:27:04.127
IT.                             
SO WE&amp;apos;RE GETTING KIND OF A MUCH 
TIGHTER SENSE OF HOW GOOD THAT  

01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.995
SO WE&amp;apos;RE GETTING KIND OF A MUCH 
TIGHTER SENSE OF HOW GOOD THAT  
INFRASTRUCTURE IS OR IS NOT AND 

01:27:04.997 --> 01:27:05.762
TIGHTER SENSE OF HOW GOOD THAT  
INFRASTRUCTURE IS OR IS NOT AND 
WHAT THE POSSIBLE COST FOR THAT 

01:27:05.764 --> 01:27:06.363
INFRASTRUCTURE IS OR IS NOT AND 
WHAT THE POSSIBLE COST FOR THAT 
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUY OUT IS    

01:27:06.365 --> 01:27:06.830
WHAT THE POSSIBLE COST FOR THAT 
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUY OUT IS    
FOR SURE.                       

01:27:06.832 --> 01:27:07.497
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUY OUT IS    
FOR SURE.                       
IF THAT GOES WELL AND WE        

01:27:07.499 --> 01:27:08.231
FOR SURE.                       
IF THAT GOES WELL AND WE        
PROCEED ON WE GO TO A PUBLIC    

01:27:08.233 --> 01:27:08.965
IF THAT GOES WELL AND WE        
PROCEED ON WE GO TO A PUBLIC    
VOTE AND HERE THE PUBLIC IS     

01:27:08.967 --> 01:27:09.433
PROCEED ON WE GO TO A PUBLIC    
VOTE AND HERE THE PUBLIC IS     
AGREEING TO BUY THAT            

01:27:09.435 --> 01:27:10.233
VOTE AND HERE THE PUBLIC IS     
AGREEING TO BUY THAT            
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TAKE ON THE  

01:27:10.235 --> 01:27:10.834
AGREEING TO BUY THAT            
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TAKE ON THE  
DEBT TO PURCHASE IT.            

01:27:10.836 --> 01:27:11.435
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TAKE ON THE  
DEBT TO PURCHASE IT.            
WE THEN START NEGOTIATING AND   

01:27:11.437 --> 01:27:12.168
DEBT TO PURCHASE IT.            
WE THEN START NEGOTIATING AND   
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE WE     

01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:12.969
WE THEN START NEGOTIATING AND   
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE WE     
COULD START EARLIER IN THAT     

01:27:12.971 --> 01:27:15.671
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE WE     
COULD START EARLIER IN THAT     
PROCESS WE NEGOTIATE WITH THE   

01:27:15.673 --> 01:27:16.440
COULD START EARLIER IN THAT     
PROCESS WE NEGOTIATE WITH THE   
UTILITY ON THE TRUE COST        

01:27:16.442 --> 01:27:18.307
PROCESS WE NEGOTIATE WITH THE   
UTILITY ON THE TRUE COST        
OF THAT IN THE ABSENCE          

01:27:18.309 --> 01:27:18.942
UTILITY ON THE TRUE COST        
OF THAT IN THE ABSENCE          
OF REACHING AGREEMENT.          

01:27:18.944 --> 01:27:21.645
OF THAT IN THE ABSENCE          
OF REACHING AGREEMENT.          
THIS IS WHERE LITIGATION STARTS 

01:27:21.647 --> 01:27:21.978
OF REACHING AGREEMENT.          
THIS IS WHERE LITIGATION STARTS 
.                               

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:22.945
THIS IS WHERE LITIGATION STARTS 
.                               
WE GO TO THE COURTS TO          

01:27:22.947 --> 01:27:23.413
.                               
WE GO TO THE COURTS TO          
DETERMINE THE COST.             

01:27:23.415 --> 01:27:25.749
WE GO TO THE COURTS TO          
DETERMINE THE COST.             
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO FINANCE    

01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:26.616
DETERMINE THE COST.             
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO FINANCE    
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ONCE WE     

01:27:26.618 --> 01:27:27.417
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO FINANCE    
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ONCE WE     
AGREE ON IT, WE&amp;apos;VE GOT TO GO    

01:27:27.419 --> 01:27:29.819
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ONCE WE     
AGREE ON IT, WE&amp;apos;VE GOT TO GO    
GET THE MONEY TO BE ABLE        

01:27:29.821 --> 01:27:30.553
AGREE ON IT, WE&amp;apos;VE GOT TO GO    
GET THE MONEY TO BE ABLE        
WHETHER THAT&amp;apos;S MOST LIKELY

THEN THIS IS AN ONGOING BOX.    

01:27:41.933 --> 01:27:45.268
START PROVIDING SERVICE AND     
THEN THIS IS AN ONGOING BOX.    
WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE  

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.602
THEN THIS IS AN ONGOING BOX.    
WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE  
RIGHT.                          

01:27:45.604 --> 01:27:46.335
WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE  
RIGHT.                          
ONCE WE CREATE THE UTILITY      

01:27:46.337 --> 01:27:48.805
RIGHT.                          
ONCE WE CREATE THE UTILITY      
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT TO KEEP DOING THAT.   

01:27:48.807 --> 01:27:49.906
ONCE WE CREATE THE UTILITY      
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT TO KEEP DOING THAT.   
WE STILL HAVE TO OBTAIN A       

01:27:49.908 --> 01:27:50.540
WE&amp;apos;VE GOT TO KEEP DOING THAT.   
WE STILL HAVE TO OBTAIN A       
HUNDRED PERCENT RENEWABLE       

01:27:50.542 --> 01:27:51.141
WE STILL HAVE TO OBTAIN A       
HUNDRED PERCENT RENEWABLE       
ENERGY WHICH COULD BE           

01:27:51.143 --> 01:27:53.509
HUNDRED PERCENT RENEWABLE       
ENERGY WHICH COULD BE           
NEGOTIATED IN THE PROCESS BUT   

01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:54.210
ENERGY WHICH COULD BE           
NEGOTIATED IN THE PROCESS BUT   
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AND THEN      

01:27:54.212 --> 01:27:56.679
NEGOTIATED IN THE PROCESS BUT   
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AND THEN      
ONGOING WE JUST HAVE TO BUILD   

01:27:56.681 --> 01:27:57.347
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AND THEN      
ONGOING WE JUST HAVE TO BUILD   
THE INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT.       

01:27:57.349 --> 01:27:58.248
ONGOING WE JUST HAVE TO BUILD   
THE INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT.       
AS THINGS GO DOWN, AS STORMS    

01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.049
THE INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT.       
AS THINGS GO DOWN, AS STORMS    
ROLL THROUGH, WE HAVE TO        

01:27:59.051 --> 01:28:00.984
AS THINGS GO DOWN, AS STORMS    
ROLL THROUGH, WE HAVE TO        
UPGRADE JUST WHAT I ACKNOWLEDGE 

01:28:00.986 --> 01:28:01.651
ROLL THROUGH, WE HAVE TO        
UPGRADE JUST WHAT I ACKNOWLEDGE 
NOW THAT&amp;apos;S OUR INFRASTRUCTURE   

01:28:01.653 --> 01:28:04.153
UPGRADE JUST WHAT I ACKNOWLEDGE 
NOW THAT&amp;apos;S OUR INFRASTRUCTURE   
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME       

01:28:04.155 --> 01:28:04.854
NOW THAT&amp;apos;S OUR INFRASTRUCTURE   
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME       
OF THESE LATERAL COSTS LIKE     

01:28:04.856 --> 01:28:05.588
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME       
OF THESE LATERAL COSTS LIKE     
PROVIDING THE SERVICE AND THE   

01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:08.058
OF THESE LATERAL COSTS LIKE     
PROVIDING THE SERVICE AND THE   
BUILDING OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE  

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:08.825
PROVIDING THE SERVICE AND THE   
BUILDING OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE  
CAN BE RECOVERED DURING THE     

01:28:08.827 --> 01:28:12.628
BUILDING OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE  
CAN BE RECOVERED DURING THE     
RATES THAT WE SET IN THE        

01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:14.898
CAN BE RECOVERED DURING THE     
RATES THAT WE SET IN THE        
UTILITY OTHER COSTS HADNOT AND  

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:15.832
RATES THAT WE SET IN THE        
UTILITY OTHER COSTS HADNOT AND  
SO THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED   

01:28:15.834 --> 01:28:16.500
UTILITY OTHER COSTS HADNOT AND  
SO THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED   
WITH MOVING THIS FORWARD.       

01:28:16.502 --> 01:28:19.836
SO THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED   
WITH MOVING THIS FORWARD.       
BUT I WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT    

01:28:19.838 --> 01:28:20.704
WITH MOVING THIS FORWARD.       
BUT I WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT    
ARE NOT RECOVERABLE COSTS AND   

01:28:20.706 --> 01:28:23.873
BUT I WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT    
ARE NOT RECOVERABLE COSTS AND   
SOME THAT ARE THIS IS TRUE AS   

01:28:23.875 --> 01:28:27.076
ARE NOT RECOVERABLE COSTS AND   
SOME THAT ARE THIS IS TRUE AS   
WELL I THINK AS YOU SO LET ME   

01:28:27.078 --> 01:28:28.011
SOME THAT ARE THIS IS TRUE AS   
WELL I THINK AS YOU SO LET ME   
HAVE IT IS A CLOSED DOOR        

01:28:28.013 --> 01:28:28.779
WELL I THINK AS YOU SO LET ME   
HAVE IT IS A CLOSED DOOR        
REFRESHER ON THE SUSTAINABLE    

01:28:28.781 --> 01:28:31.114
HAVE IT IS A CLOSED DOOR        
REFRESHER ON THE SUSTAINABLE    
ENERGY UTILITY SO WHAT&amp;apos;S        

01:28:31.116 --> 01:28:32.048
REFRESHER ON THE SUSTAINABLE    
ENERGY UTILITY SO WHAT&amp;apos;S        
DIFFERENT HERE IS THIS IS A     

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:32.715
ENERGY UTILITY SO WHAT&amp;apos;S        
DIFFERENT HERE IS THIS IS A     
SUPPLEMENTAL UTILITY TO OUR     

01:28:32.717 --> 01:28:35.285
DIFFERENT HERE IS THIS IS A     
SUPPLEMENTAL UTILITY TO OUR     
EXISTING INVESTOR OWNED         

01:28:35.287 --> 01:28:35.685
SUPPLEMENTAL UTILITY TO OUR     
EXISTING INVESTOR OWNED         
UTILITY.                        

01:28:35.687 --> 01:28:38.855
EXISTING INVESTOR OWNED         
UTILITY.                        
IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSES   

01:28:38.857 --> 01:28:39.222
UTILITY.                        
IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSES   
ON GENERATION.                  

01:28:39.224 --> 01:28:40.423
IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSES   
ON GENERATION.                  
SO I TALKED A LOT ABOUT         

01:28:40.425 --> 01:28:43.459
ON GENERATION.                  
SO I TALKED A LOT ABOUT         
DISTRIBUTION BEFORE THE POLES,  

01:28:43.461 --> 01:28:44.194
SO I TALKED A LOT ABOUT         
DISTRIBUTION BEFORE THE POLES,  
THE WIRES, THE INFRASTRUCTURE   

01:28:44.196 --> 01:28:44.994
DISTRIBUTION BEFORE THE POLES,  
THE WIRES, THE INFRASTRUCTURE   
BECAUSE THIS IS FOCUSING ON THE 

01:28:44.996 --> 01:28:47.597
THE WIRES, THE INFRASTRUCTURE   
BECAUSE THIS IS FOCUSING ON THE 
GENERATION SOLAR OR GEOTHERMAL  

01:28:47.599 --> 01:28:48.264
BECAUSE THIS IS FOCUSING ON THE 
GENERATION SOLAR OR GEOTHERMAL  
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS.         

01:28:48.266 --> 01:28:51.601
GENERATION SOLAR OR GEOTHERMAL  
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS.         
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO OWN THE        

01:28:51.603 --> 01:28:52.202
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS.         
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO OWN THE        
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.           

01:28:52.204 --> 01:28:55.471
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO OWN THE        
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.           
WE CAN SET UP THE SYSTEM TO BE  

01:28:55.473 --> 01:28:56.139
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.           
WE CAN SET UP THE SYSTEM TO BE  
ABLE TO DO BEHIND THE METER     

01:28:56.141 --> 01:28:56.939
WE CAN SET UP THE SYSTEM TO BE  
ABLE TO DO BEHIND THE METER     
THINGS SO WE&amp;apos;RE NOT REALLY      

01:28:56.941 --> 01:28:59.309
ABLE TO DO BEHIND THE METER     
THINGS SO WE&amp;apos;RE NOT REALLY      
USING DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.     

01:28:59.311 --> 01:29:03.113
THINGS SO WE&amp;apos;RE NOT REALLY      
USING DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.     
IT IS STILL COMMUNITY OWNED AND 

01:29:03.115 --> 01:29:04.047
USING DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.     
IT IS STILL COMMUNITY OWNED AND 
IS A MUNICIPAL UTILITY BUT IT   

01:29:04.049 --> 01:29:07.350
IT IS STILL COMMUNITY OWNED AND 
IS A MUNICIPAL UTILITY BUT IT   
IS SUPPLEMENTAL AND THAT MEANS  

01:29:07.352 --> 01:29:08.151
IS A MUNICIPAL UTILITY BUT IT   
IS SUPPLEMENTAL AND THAT MEANS  
THAT IT IS NOT THE SOLE         

01:29:08.153 --> 01:29:08.485
IS SUPPLEMENTAL AND THAT MEANS  
THAT IT IS NOT THE SOLE         
PROVIDER.                       

01:29:08.487 --> 01:29:11.621
THAT IT IS NOT THE SOLE         
PROVIDER.                       
THAT MEANS PEOPLE WILL STILL    

01:29:11.623 --> 01:29:12.422
PROVIDER.                       
THAT MEANS PEOPLE WILL STILL    
DRAW ENERGY FROM THE INVESTOR   

01:29:12.424 --> 01:29:15.458
THAT MEANS PEOPLE WILL STILL    
DRAW ENERGY FROM THE INVESTOR   
OWNED UTILITY.                  

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:19.195
DRAW ENERGY FROM THE INVESTOR   
OWNED UTILITY.                  
IT ALSO MEANS WE HAVE TO GROW   

01:29:19.197 --> 01:29:20.330
OWNED UTILITY.                  
IT ALSO MEANS WE HAVE TO GROW   
OVER TIME SO IT IS NOT LIKE A   

01:29:20.332 --> 01:29:23.032
IT ALSO MEANS WE HAVE TO GROW   
OVER TIME SO IT IS NOT LIKE A   
BAND-AID BEING RIPPED OFF WHERE 

01:29:23.034 --> 01:29:23.800
OVER TIME SO IT IS NOT LIKE A   
BAND-AID BEING RIPPED OFF WHERE 
THE SIU PROVIDES POWER          

01:29:23.802 --> 01:29:24.534
BAND-AID BEING RIPPED OFF WHERE 
THE SIU PROVIDES POWER          
INSTANTLY TO COMMUNITIES WE     

01:29:24.536 --> 01:29:26.870
THE SIU PROVIDES POWER          
INSTANTLY TO COMMUNITIES WE     
HAVE TO SCALE UP THE GENERATION 

01:29:26.872 --> 01:29:27.804
INSTANTLY TO COMMUNITIES WE     
HAVE TO SCALE UP THE GENERATION 
THAT WE HAVE AND THE PROVISION  

01:29:27.806 --> 01:29:30.440
HAVE TO SCALE UP THE GENERATION 
THAT WE HAVE AND THE PROVISION  
OF POWER.                       

01:29:30.442 --> 01:29:31.441
THAT WE HAVE AND THE PROVISION  
OF POWER.                       
THE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THAT   

01:29:31.443 --> 01:29:32.341
OF POWER.                       
THE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THAT   
IS IT MEANS WE CAN GROW INTO    

01:29:32.343 --> 01:29:34.777
THE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THAT   
IS IT MEANS WE CAN GROW INTO    
NEW SERVICES OVER TIME.         

01:29:34.779 --> 01:29:35.645
IS IT MEANS WE CAN GROW INTO    
NEW SERVICES OVER TIME.         
SO WE TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL  

01:29:35.647 --> 01:29:38.348
NEW SERVICES OVER TIME.         
SO WE TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL  
FOR MICRO GREENING AS ONE       

01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:39.515
SO WE TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL  
FOR MICRO GREENING AS ONE       
OF THE THINGS WHEN WE GET A     

01:29:39.517 --> 01:29:40.216
FOR MICRO GREENING AS ONE       
OF THE THINGS WHEN WE GET A     
DENSITY OF NEIGHBORS THAT ARE   

01:29:40.218 --> 01:29:41.618
OF THE THINGS WHEN WE GET A     
DENSITY OF NEIGHBORS THAT ARE   
USING SOLAR WE CAN ACTUALLY     

01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:42.352
DENSITY OF NEIGHBORS THAT ARE   
USING SOLAR WE CAN ACTUALLY     
START SETTING UP MINIMAL        

01:29:42.354 --> 01:29:42.953
USING SOLAR WE CAN ACTUALLY     
START SETTING UP MINIMAL        
DISTRIBUTION LINES CONNECTING   

01:29:42.955 --> 01:29:46.689
START SETTING UP MINIMAL        
DISTRIBUTION LINES CONNECTING   
THOSE DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS THAT 

01:29:46.691 --> 01:29:47.357
DISTRIBUTION LINES CONNECTING   
THOSE DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS THAT 
WE WOULD THAT OWN THAT BECAUSE  

01:29:47.359 --> 01:29:48.125
THOSE DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS THAT 
WE WOULD THAT OWN THAT BECAUSE  
WE WOULD BE SETTING UP THOSE    

01:29:48.127 --> 01:29:49.625
WE WOULD THAT OWN THAT BECAUSE  
WE WOULD BE SETTING UP THOSE    
LINES.                          

01:29:49.627 --> 01:29:50.727
WE WOULD BE SETTING UP THOSE    
LINES.                          
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO BUY THEM OUT   

01:29:50.729 --> 01:29:51.528
LINES.                          
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO BUY THEM OUT   
FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY 

01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:54.964
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO BUY THEM OUT   
FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY 
SO WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GET INTO    

01:29:54.966 --> 01:29:55.832
FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY 
SO WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GET INTO    
THE SAME KIND OF PROCESS        

01:29:55.834 --> 01:29:57.300
SO WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GET INTO    
THE SAME KIND OF PROCESS        
OF UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE      

01:29:57.302 --> 01:29:58.034
THE SAME KIND OF PROCESS        
OF UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE      
OF OUR ASSETS BECAUSE WE&amp;apos;RE     

01:29:58.036 --> 01:29:58.701
OF UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE      
OF OUR ASSETS BECAUSE WE&amp;apos;RE     
NEVER BUYING THEIR ASSETS.      

01:29:58.703 --> 01:30:02.205
OF OUR ASSETS BECAUSE WE&amp;apos;RE     
NEVER BUYING THEIR ASSETS.      
SO IT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT PROCESS NOW 

01:30:02.207 --> 01:30:05.408
NEVER BUYING THEIR ASSETS.      
SO IT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT PROCESS NOW 
IT&amp;apos;S ALSO A MULTI-STEP PROCESS  

01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:05.641
SO IT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT PROCESS NOW 
IT&amp;apos;S ALSO A MULTI-STEP PROCESS  
.                               

01:30:05.643 --> 01:30:06.509
IT&amp;apos;S ALSO A MULTI-STEP PROCESS  
.                               
SO WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO GET BACK 

01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:07.309
.                               
SO WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO GET BACK 
SHOULD THE COUNCIL MOVE FORWARD 

01:30:07.311 --> 01:30:09.746
SO WHAT WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO GET BACK

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT&amp;apos;S THE RECOMMENDATION.   
SO THAT WOULD BE A STRANDED     
COST FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WENT AND 

01:37:49.207 --> 01:37:52.241
SO THAT WOULD BE A STRANDED     
COST FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WENT AND 
DID PHASE ONE AND TWO AT THE

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, BECAUSE THEN YOU PHASE 
ONE IS BEHIND THE METER SOLAR   
STORAGE PHASE TWO FOR THE AC IS 

01:38:18.769 --> 01:38:22.771
ONE IS BEHIND THE METER SOLAR   
STORAGE PHASE TWO FOR THE AC IS 
THE MICROGRID SO OK.            

01:38:22.773 --> 01:38:27.109
STORAGE PHASE TWO FOR THE AC IS

LESS FREQUENTLY IF WE CAN DO    
THAT HERE.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF A FEASIBILITY STUDY IS 

01:59:40.383 --> 01:59:41.282
THAT HERE.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF A FEASIBILITY STUDY IS 
THE FIRST STEP TO FIND OUT A    

01:59:41.284 --> 01:59:43.418
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF A FEASIBILITY STUDY IS 
THE FIRST STEP TO FIND OUT A    
WAY SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT      

01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:47.254
THE FIRST STEP TO FIND OUT A    
WAY SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT      
FOLKS WHO NEED RELIABLE ENERGY  

01:59:47.256 --> 01:59:48.323
WAY SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT      
FOLKS WHO NEED RELIABLE ENERGY  
AND IF WE THINK ABOUT ALL THE   

01:59:48.325 --> 01:59:52.359
FOLKS WHO NEED RELIABLE ENERGY  
AND IF WE THINK ABOUT ALL THE   
OTHER THINGS THAT WE INVEST IN

AND IF WE THINK ABOUT ALL THE   
OTHER THINGS THAT WE INVEST IN  
IN THE CITY AND ROADS AND THAT  

01:59:53.329 --> 01:59:55.763
OTHER THINGS THAT WE INVEST IN  
IN THE CITY AND ROADS AND THAT  
KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE, I THINK 

01:59:55.765 --> 01:59:56.464
IN THE CITY AND ROADS AND THAT  
KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE, I THINK 
IT&amp;apos;S PRETTY FAIR TO HAVE        

01:59:56.466 --> 02:00:00.968
KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE, I THINK 
IT&amp;apos;S PRETTY FAIR TO HAVE        
ELECTRICITY ANOTHER ANOTHER     

02:00:00.970 --> 02:00:01.903
IT&amp;apos;S PRETTY FAIR TO HAVE

ELECTRICITY ANOTHER ANOTHER     
ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE SURE FOLKS  
ARE OK AVAILABLE TO US.         

02:00:02.639 --> 02:00:05.072
ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE SURE FOLKS  
ARE OK AVAILABLE TO US.

SO THIS IS ESSENTIAL            
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE&amp;apos;VE SHOWN

UTILITY.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT IT&amp;apos;S ESSENTIAL  
THAT WE DO SOMETHING AND THAT I 

02:04:03.045 --> 02:04:03.978
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT IT&amp;apos;S ESSENTIAL  
THAT WE DO SOMETHING AND THAT I 
WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY DR.

02:04:08.184 --> 02:04:10.785
STOLTZFUS EVALUATION OF THIS    
FEASIBILITY STUDY AND I THINK   
THAT&amp;apos;S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO  

02:04:10.787 --> 02:04:11.585
FEASIBILITY STUDY AND I THINK   
THAT&amp;apos;S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO  
DO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT RIGHT   

02:04:11.587 --> 02:04:14.088
THAT&amp;apos;S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO  
DO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT RIGHT   
NOW DETROIT EDISONS RELIABILITY 

02:04:14.090 --> 02:04:14.755
DO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT RIGHT   
NOW DETROIT EDISONS RELIABILITY 
IS VERY LOW.                    

02:04:14.757 --> 02:04:18.125
NOW DETROIT EDISONS RELIABILITY 
IS VERY LOW.                    
WE KNOW THAT THE RATE PAYERS    

02:04:18.127 --> 02:04:19.226
IS VERY LOW.                    
WE KNOW THAT THE RATE PAYERS    
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GETTING    

02:04:19.228 --> 02:04:22.496
WE KNOW THAT THE RATE PAYERS    
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GETTING    
THE BENEFIT OF WHATEVER THE     

02:04:22.498 --> 02:04:23.197
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GETTING    
THE BENEFIT OF WHATEVER THE     
EXCESS RATES ARE AND THAT&amp;apos;S     

02:04:23.199 --> 02:04:27.268
THE BENEFIT OF WHATEVER THE     
EXCESS RATES ARE AND THAT&amp;apos;S     
SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN FOR    

02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:28.002
EXCESS RATES ARE AND THAT&amp;apos;S     
SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN FOR    
THE OTHER CITIES WHICH HAVE     

02:04:28.004 --> 02:04:30.338
SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN FOR    
THE OTHER CITIES WHICH HAVE     
MUNICIPAL POWER UTILITIES THAT  

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:31.272
THE OTHER CITIES WHICH HAVE     
MUNICIPAL POWER UTILITIES THAT  
EXCESS MONEY GOES BACK INTO THE 

02:04:31.274 --> 02:04:34.775
MUNICIPAL POWER UTILITIES THAT  
EXCESS MONEY GOES BACK INTO THE 
SYSTEM AND NOT TO RATEPAYERS.   

02:04:34.777 --> 02:04:35.843
EXCESS MONEY GOES BACK INTO THE 
SYSTEM AND NOT TO RATEPAYERS.   
SO IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO   

02:04:35.845 --> 02:04:36.244
SYSTEM AND NOT TO RATEPAYERS.   
SO IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO   
DO THAT.                        

02:04:36.246 --> 02:04:38.980
SO IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO   
DO THAT.                        
OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE TO STUDY   

02:04:38.982 --> 02:04:39.847
DO THAT.                        
OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE TO STUDY   
THIS IN MORE DETAIL AND I       

02:04:39.849 --> 02:04:42.950
OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE TO STUDY   
THIS IN MORE DETAIL AND I       
APPLAUD YOU FOR DOING THAT.     

02:04:42.952 --> 02:04:44.017
THIS IN MORE DETAIL AND I       
APPLAUD YOU FOR DOING THAT.     
BUT I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT ONE 

02:04:44.019 --> 02:04:46.220
APPLAUD YOU FOR DOING THAT.     
BUT I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT ONE 
OTHER THING ABOUT DTD CURRENT   

02:04:46.222 --> 02:04:46.954
BUT I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT ONE 
OTHER THING ABOUT DTD CURRENT   
POLICY REGARDING NET METERING   

02:04:46.956 --> 02:04:47.688
OTHER THING ABOUT DTD CURRENT   
POLICY REGARDING NET METERING   
FOR SOLAR INSTALLATIONS RIGHT   

02:04:47.690 --> 02:04:51.091
POLICY REGARDING NET METERING   
FOR SOLAR INSTALLATIONS RIGHT   
NOW AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY  

02:04:51.093 --> 02:04:53.461
FOR SOLAR INSTALLATIONS RIGHT   
NOW AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY  
MR TSG AND OTHER PEOPLE,        

02:04:53.463 --> 02:04:58.132
NOW AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY  
MR TSG AND OTHER PEOPLE,        
DETROIT EDISON WILL PAY YOU     

02:04:58.134 --> 02:04:58.866
MR TSG AND OTHER PEOPLE,        
DETROIT EDISON WILL PAY YOU     
WHOLESALE FOR YOUR ELECTRIC     

02:04:58.868 --> 02:05:01.602
DETROIT EDISON WILL PAY YOU     
WHOLESALE FOR YOUR ELECTRIC     
THAT YOU GENERATE WHILE THEY    

02:05:01.604 --> 02:05:05.339
WHOLESALE FOR YOUR ELECTRIC     
THAT YOU GENERATE WHILE THEY    
CHARGE YOU RETAIL.              

02:05:05.341 --> 02:05:06.373
THAT YOU GENERATE WHILE THEY    
CHARGE YOU RETAIL.              
AND WHY THIS DOESN&amp;apos;T MAKE ANY   

02:05:06.375 --> 02:05:09.577
CHARGE YOU RETAIL.              
AND WHY THIS DOESN&amp;apos;T MAKE ANY   
SENSE IS BECAUSE WHEN THE       

02:05:09.579 --> 02:05:10.377
AND WHY THIS DOESN&amp;apos;T MAKE ANY   
SENSE IS BECAUSE WHEN THE       
UTILITY NEEDS THAT ELECTRICITY  

02:05:10.379 --> 02:05:13.881
SENSE IS BECAUSE WHEN THE       
UTILITY NEEDS THAT ELECTRICITY  
THE MOST AND THEY WOULD BE      

02:05:13.883 --> 02:05:14.682
UTILITY NEEDS THAT ELECTRICITY  
THE MOST AND THEY WOULD BE      
PAYING THE MOST FOR THOSE PEAK  

02:05:14.684 --> 02:05:16.751
THE MOST AND THEY WOULD BE      
PAYING THE MOST FOR THOSE PEAK  
KILOWATTS IN WHICH THEY WOULD   

02:05:16.753 --> 02:05:17.618
PAYING THE MOST FOR THOSE PEAK  
KILOWATTS IN WHICH THEY WOULD   
GENERALLY BE FIRING UP GAS      

02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:20.888
KILOWATTS IN WHICH THEY WOULD   
GENERALLY BE FIRING UP GAS      
POWERED GENERATORS AS AUXILIARY 

02:05:20.890 --> 02:05:24.992
GENERALLY BE FIRING UP GAS      
POWERED GENERATORS AS AUXILIARY 
GENERATORS THAT&amp;apos;S THE TIME WHEN 

02:05:24.994 --> 02:05:25.726
POWERED GENERATORS AS AUXILIARY 
GENERATORS THAT&amp;apos;S THE TIME WHEN 
SOLAR INSTALLATIONS ARE ALSO    

02:05:25.728 --> 02:05:28.862
GENERATORS THAT&amp;apos;S THE TIME WHEN 
SOLAR INSTALLATIONS ARE ALSO    
GENERATING THE MOST POWER       

02:05:28.864 --> 02:05:32.400
SOLAR INSTALLATIONS ARE ALSO    
GENERATING THE MOST POWER       
DURING THOSE HOT SUNNY DAYS.    

02:05:32.402 --> 02:05:36.470
GENERATING THE MOST POWER       
DURING THOSE HOT SUNNY DAYS.    
SO THE LOGIC OF ALLOWING YOUR   

02:05:36.472 --> 02:05:37.271
DURING THOSE HOT SUNNY DAYS.    
SO THE LOGIC OF ALLOWING YOUR   
SOLAR INSTALLATIONS TO GET      

02:05:37.273 --> 02:05:40.908
SO THE LOGIC OF ALLOWING YOUR   
SOLAR INSTALLATIONS TO GET      
RETAIL BACK FROM THE UTILITY    

02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:44.411
SOLAR INSTALLATIONS TO GET      
RETAIL BACK FROM THE UTILITY    
INSTEAD OF WHOLESALE MAKES SO   

02:05:44.413 --> 02:05:45.212
RETAIL BACK FROM THE UTILITY    
INSTEAD OF WHOLESALE MAKES SO   
MUCH SENSE FOR ENCOURAGING      

02:05:45.214 --> 02:05:49.083
INSTEAD OF WHOLESALE MAKES SO   
MUCH SENSE FOR ENCOURAGING      
PEOPLE TO GET SOLAR AND HAVE IT 

02:05:49.085 --> 02:05:51.752
MUCH SENSE FOR ENCOURAGING      
PEOPLE TO GET SOLAR AND HAVE IT 
PAY OFF AND NOT BE A WASTED     

02:05:51.754 --> 02:05:55.389
PEOPLE TO GET SOLAR AND HAVE IT 
PAY OFF AND NOT BE A WASTED     
INVESTMENT FOR THE HOMEOWNER    

02:05:55.391 --> 02:05:59.860
PAY OFF AND NOT BE A WASTED     
INVESTMENT FOR THE HOMEOWNER    
AND AND D.T. SADLY HAS          

02:05:59.862 --> 02:06:03.730
INVESTMENT FOR THE HOMEOWNER    
AND AND D.T. SADLY HAS          
REPEATEDLY AND CONSISTENTLY FOR

02:06:08.772 --> 02:06:09.870
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS       
FOUGHT TRUE NET METERING.       
SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE IF     

02:06:09.872 --> 02:06:12.106
FOUGHT TRUE NET METERING.       
SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE IF     
WE&amp;apos;RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT ZERO  

02:06:12.108 --> 02:06:16.143
SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE IF     
WE&amp;apos;RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT ZERO  
GETTING TO ZERO CARBON , THAT   

02:06:16.145 --> 02:06:17.044
WE&amp;apos;RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT ZERO  
GETTING TO ZERO CARBON , THAT   
IS ONE REASON TO GO WITH AN MP.
