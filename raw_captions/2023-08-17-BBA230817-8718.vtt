TO HAVE FOUR WASHERS AND        

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:29.035
WOULD HAVE IN THAT OUR PROPOSAL 
TO HAVE FOUR WASHERS AND        
DRYERS.                         

00:11:29.037 --> 00:11:30.135
TO HAVE FOUR WASHERS AND        
DRYERS.                         
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S A ONE TO SIX  

00:11:30.137 --> 00:11:32.505
DRYERS.

RATIO WITH UNITS THAT DON&apos;T     

00:11:32.507 --> 00:11:35.541
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S A ONE TO SIX  
RATIO WITH UNITS THAT DON&apos;T     
HAVE ANYTHING IN THEM, YOU      

00:11:35.543 --> 00:11:36.275
RATIO WITH UNITS THAT DON&apos;T     
HAVE ANYTHING IN THEM, YOU      
KNOW, PROVIDES MORE RESOURCES

SO JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR  
CONSIDERATION OF THE VARIOUS    

00:11:51.393 --> 00:11:55.494
SO JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR  
CONSIDERATION OF THE VARIOUS    
OF THE THREE FOUR BEDROOMS      

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:56.095
CONSIDERATION OF THE VARIOUS    
OF THE THREE FOUR BEDROOMS      
TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN         

00:11:56.097 --> 00:11:58.297
OF THE THREE FOUR BEDROOMS      
TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN         
REQUIRED BY MR WHO WAS OUR      

00:11:58.299 --> 00:11:59.098

PRIMARY FUNDING AGENCIES TO     

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.768
REQUIRED BY MR WHO WAS OUR      
PRIMARY FUNDING AGENCIES TO     
HAVE LAUNDRY FACILITIES IN THEM 

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.536
PRIMARY FUNDING AGENCIES TO     
HAVE LAUNDRY FACILITIES IN THEM 
INCLUDING NOT JUST CONNECTIONS  

00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:04.070
HAVE LAUNDRY FACILITIES IN THEM 
INCLUDING NOT JUST CONNECTIONS  
BUT THE ACTUAL LAUNDRY          

00:12:04.072 --> 00:12:06.272
INCLUDING NOT JUST CONNECTIONS

BUT THE ACTUAL LAUNDRY          
FACILITIES.                     
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE STARTED THAT   

00:12:07.508 --> 00:12:08.141
FACILITIES.                     
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE STARTED THAT   
THE APPLICABILITY OF THE MR     

00:12:08.143 --> 00:12:10.976
SO THAT&apos;S WHY WE STARTED THAT   
THE APPLICABILITY OF THE MR     
RULES HAS CHANGED OVER TIME.    

00:12:10.978 --> 00:12:12.044
THE APPLICABILITY OF THE MR     
RULES HAS CHANGED OVER TIME.    
WE&apos;RE NOT USING THAT SORT SO WE 

00:12:12.046 --> 00:12:14.279
RULES HAS CHANGED OVER TIME.    
WE&apos;RE NOT USING THAT SORT SO WE 
HAVE TO DO THAT SPECIFICALLY SO 

00:12:14.281 --> 00:12:15.048
WE&apos;RE NOT USING THAT SORT SO WE 
HAVE TO DO THAT SPECIFICALLY SO 
BUT WE DON&apos;T NECESSARILY KNOW   

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.249
HAVE TO DO THAT SPECIFICALLY SO 
BUT WE DON&apos;T NECESSARILY KNOW   
THAT EARLY ON SO WE HAVE NOT    

00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:18.184
BUT WE DON&apos;T NECESSARILY KNOW   
THAT EARLY ON SO WE HAVE NOT    
VARIED FROM FROM STARTING WITH  

00:12:18.186 --> 00:12:21.887
THAT EARLY ON SO WE HAVE NOT    
VARIED FROM FROM STARTING WITH  
THAT ASSUMPTION THEY WOULD HAVE 

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:22.188
VARIED FROM FROM STARTING WITH

LAUNDRY.

THAT ASSUMPTION THEY WOULD HAVE 
LAUNDRY.                        
SO IT&apos;S NOT REALLY ARBITRARY IN 

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:25.591
LAUNDRY.                        
SO IT&apos;S NOT REALLY ARBITRARY IN 
ALL THE LOCATIONS ARBITRARY     

00:12:25.593 --> 00:12:26.292
SO IT&apos;S NOT REALLY ARBITRARY IN 
ALL THE LOCATIONS ARBITRARY     
BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE FAMILY    

00:12:26.294 --> 00:12:29.862

HAVE THEM AND CERTAIN UNITS IN  

00:20:01.649 --> 00:20:05.383
IT&apos;S FOR EACH BUILDING YOU MAY  
HAVE THEM AND CERTAIN UNITS IN  
THE BUILDING BUT IF THERE ARE   

00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:06.118
HAVE THEM AND CERTAIN UNITS IN  
THE BUILDING BUT IF THERE ARE   
UNITS THAT ARE MISSING THEM     

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:12.257
THE BUILDING BUT IF THERE ARE   
UNITS THAT ARE MISSING THEM     
THEN I BELIEVE                  

00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:27.706
               THAT THE         
CODE THE THE INTERPRETATION     
WOULD BE THERE SHOULD BE        

00:20:27.708 --> 00:20:28.506
CODE THE THE INTERPRETATION     
WOULD BE THERE SHOULD BE        
SOMETHING FOR THOSE OTHER UNITS 

00:20:28.508 --> 00:20:29.108
WOULD BE THERE SHOULD BE        
SOMETHING FOR THOSE OTHER UNITS 
TO IMPLY AT LEAST ONE           

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.908
SOMETHING FOR THOSE OTHER UNITS 
TO IMPLY AT LEAST ONE           
CONNECTION IN THE BUILDING, ONE 

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:30.509
TO IMPLY AT LEAST ONE           
CONNECTION IN THE BUILDING, ONE 
IN THE BUILDING AND             

00:20:30.511 --> 00:20:31.210
CONNECTION IN THE BUILDING, ONE 
IN THE BUILDING AND             
UNFORTUNATELY WHERE THE         

00:20:31.212 --> 00:20:31.877
IN THE BUILDING AND             
UNFORTUNATELY WHERE THE         
COMMUNITY CENTER IF YOU WANT    

00:20:31.879 --> 00:20:32.477
UNFORTUNATELY WHERE THE         
COMMUNITY CENTER IF YOU WANT    
THEM TO DO ANYWAYS.             

00:20:32.479 --> 00:20:32.811
COMMUNITY CENTER IF YOU WANT    
THEM TO DO ANYWAYS.             
WELL YEAH.                      

00:20:32.813 --> 00:20:33.612

WELL YEAH.                      
I MEAN THE OPTIONS WERE GIVEN

WELL YEAH.                      
I MEAN THE OPTIONS WERE GIVEN   
BY THE CITY WHICH ARE PERFECTLY

MOVE MONEY AROUND, YOU KNOW     
WHAT I MEAN TO DO THESE.        
BUT IF LOOKING KIND OF WHAT&apos;S

WHAT I MEAN TO DO THESE.        
BUT IF LOOKING KIND OF WHAT&apos;S

THE CODE THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED  

00:20:54.735 --> 00:20:55.768
EQUAL OR BETTER BECAUSE UNDER   
THE CODE THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED  
I WOULD SAY IT SORT OF FEELS    

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:56.501
THE CODE THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED  
I WOULD SAY IT SORT OF FEELS    
BETTER TO HAVE ACTUAL UNITS     

00:20:56.503 --> 00:20:59.270
I WOULD SAY IT SORT OF FEELS    
BETTER TO HAVE ACTUAL UNITS     
HIGH QUALITY MAINTAINED OR AT   

00:20:59.272 --> 00:20:59.905
BETTER TO HAVE ACTUAL UNITS

YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE BETTER  

00:21:02.976 --> 00:21:03.675
LEAST A CONSIDERATION WHETHER   
YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE BETTER  
VERSUS JUST HAVING AND HAVING   

00:21:03.677 --> 00:21:06.712
YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE BETTER  
VERSUS JUST HAVING AND HAVING   
WASHERS AND DRYERS VERSUS JUST  

00:21:06.714 --> 00:21:07.679
VERSUS JUST HAVING AND HAVING   
WASHERS AND DRYERS VERSUS JUST  
HAVING A LAUNDRY HOOKUP WITH NO

WASHERS AND DRYERS VERSUS JUST  
HAVING A LAUNDRY HOOKUP WITH NO 
EQUIPMENT IN PEOPLE&apos;S UNIT JUST 

00:21:10.851 --> 00:21:11.716
HAVING A LAUNDRY HOOKUP WITH NO 
EQUIPMENT IN PEOPLE&apos;S UNIT JUST 
AS YOU&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT IT.    

00:21:11.718 --> 00:21:12.518
EQUIPMENT IN PEOPLE&apos;S UNIT JUST 
AS YOU&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT IT.    
I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE GOING TO    

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.986
AS YOU&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT IT.    
I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE GOING TO    
THEN TAKE IT AWAY BECAUSE WE&apos;D  

00:21:14.988 --> 00:21:15.854
I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE GOING TO    
THEN TAKE IT AWAY BECAUSE WE&apos;D  
HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND  

00:21:15.856 --> 00:21:16.522
THEN TAKE IT AWAY BECAUSE WE&apos;D  
HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND  
I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT WE WOULD.     

00:21:16.524 --> 00:21:23.262
HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND  
I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT WE WOULD.     
BUT JUST COMPARING THE TWO      

00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:37.175
BECAUSE THIS IS THE PLUMBING    
CODE OR THE FRENCH WITH THE     
MECHANICAL PART OF THE DRYERS,  

00:21:37.177 --> 00:21:38.009
CODE OR THE FRENCH WITH THE     
MECHANICAL PART OF THE DRYERS,  
I WONDER HOW MUCH GREATER       

00:21:38.011 --> 00:21:40.412
MECHANICAL PART OF THE DRYERS,  
I WONDER HOW MUCH GREATER       
KNOWING THE CODE REQUIRES IF    

00:21:40.414 --> 00:21:41.146
I WONDER HOW MUCH GREATER       
KNOWING THE CODE REQUIRES IF    
YOU HAVE A WASHING MACHINE      

00:21:41.148 --> 00:21:43.948
KNOWING THE CODE REQUIRES IF    
YOU HAVE A WASHING MACHINE      
PLUMBING CODE , WHAT THEY&apos;RE    

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:44.883
YOU HAVE A WASHING MACHINE      
PLUMBING CODE , WHAT THEY&apos;RE    
FEELING IS THE PLUMBING CODE .  

00:21:44.885 --> 00:21:45.217
PLUMBING CODE , WHAT THEY&apos;RE    
FEELING IS THE PLUMBING CODE .  
YEAH.                           

00:21:45.219 --> 00:21:48.687
FEELING IS THE PLUMBING CODE .  
YEAH.                           
AND THAT THE CODE IS ISN&apos;T      

00:21:48.689 --> 00:21:52.090
YEAH.                           
AND THAT THE CODE IS ISN&apos;T      
CANNOT REQUIRE THEM TO PUT IN   

00:21:52.092 --> 00:21:52.524
AND THAT THE CODE IS ISN&apos;T      
CANNOT REQUIRE THEM TO PUT IN   
THE CONNECTION.                 

00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:53.125
CANNOT REQUIRE THEM TO PUT IN   
THE CONNECTION.                 
I THINK THAT&apos;S WHAT YOU         

00:21:53.127 --> 00:21:56.628
THE CONNECTION.                 
I THINK THAT&apos;S WHAT YOU         
ORIGINALLY APPLIED NOT FOUND    

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.329
I THINK THAT&apos;S WHAT YOU         
ORIGINALLY APPLIED NOT FOUND    
ANYTHING IN THE MECHANICAL      

00:21:57.331 --> 00:21:57.930
ORIGINALLY APPLIED NOT FOUND    
ANYTHING IN THE MECHANICAL      
CODE SAYING THAT WE NEED A      

00:21:57.932 --> 00:22:00.766
ANYTHING IN THE MECHANICAL      
CODE SAYING THAT WE NEED A      
DRYER IN THE PLUMBING.          

00:22:00.768 --> 00:22:01.666
CODE SAYING THAT WE NEED A      
DRYER IN THE PLUMBING.          
IT CERTAINLY DOESN&apos;T SAY THAT   

00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:02.300
DRYER IN THE PLUMBING.          
IT CERTAINLY DOESN&apos;T SAY THAT   
CODE DOESN&apos;T SAY WE NEED        

00:22:02.302 --> 00:22:03.902
IT CERTAINLY DOESN&apos;T SAY THAT   
CODE DOESN&apos;T SAY WE NEED        
ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS IN THE   

00:22:03.904 --> 00:22:04.369
CODE DOESN&apos;T SAY WE NEED        
ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS IN THE   
WASHER EITHER.                  

00:22:04.371 --> 00:22:07.672
ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS IN THE   
WASHER EITHER.                  
I HAVE THE KNOW JUST SAYS       

00:22:07.674 --> 00:22:08.173
WASHER EITHER.                  
I HAVE THE KNOW JUST SAYS       
WASHER CONNECTION.              

00:22:08.175 --> 00:22:08.907
I HAVE THE KNOW JUST SAYS       
WASHER CONNECTION.              
SO THAT SEEMED LIKE A LOGICAL   

00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:11.576
WASHER CONNECTION.              
SO THAT SEEMED LIKE A LOGICAL   
INFERENCE LONG AGO.             

00:22:11.578 --> 00:22:12.644
SO THAT SEEMED LIKE A LOGICAL   
INFERENCE LONG AGO.             
YEAH, I THINK THAT&apos;S THE        

00:22:12.646 --> 00:22:15.714
INFERENCE LONG AGO.             
YEAH, I THINK THAT&apos;S THE        
INTENTION WAS TO HAVE A         

00:22:15.716 --> 00:22:19.017
YEAH, I THINK THAT&apos;S THE        
INTENTION WAS TO HAVE A         
CONNECTION FOR THE DEVICE THAT  

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:20.018
INTENTION WAS TO HAVE A         
CONNECTION FOR THE DEVICE THAT  
THERE IS THE ABILITY TO UNCOVER 

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.755
CONNECTION FOR THE DEVICE THAT  
THERE IS THE ABILITY TO UNCOVER 
A DEVICE IN THE INDIVIDUAL      

00:22:23.757 --> 00:22:26.658
THERE IS THE ABILITY TO UNCOVER 
A DEVICE IN THE INDIVIDUAL      
BUILDING AND THAT HAS ALL       

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.492
A DEVICE IN THE INDIVIDUAL      
BUILDING AND THAT HAS ALL       
OCCUPANTS ABLE TO USE IF THEY   

00:22:27.494 --> 00:22:30.762
BUILDING AND THAT HAS ALL       
OCCUPANTS ABLE TO USE IF THEY   
HAVE THEIR OWN CONNECTIONS AND  

00:22:30.764 --> 00:22:31.463
OCCUPANTS ABLE TO USE IF THEY   
HAVE THEIR OWN CONNECTIONS AND  
OF COURSE THEY DON&apos;T HAVE TO    

00:22:31.465 --> 00:22:34.866
HAVE THEIR OWN CONNECTIONS AND  
OF COURSE THEY DON&apos;T HAVE TO    
USE IT BUT THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT   

00:22:34.868 --> 00:22:35.567
OF COURSE THEY DON&apos;T HAVE TO    
USE IT BUT THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT   
STAFF HAS FOUND AN              

00:22:35.569 --> 00:22:38.337
USE IT BUT THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT   
STAFF HAS FOUND AN              
INTERPRETATION.                 

00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:39.304
STAFF HAS FOUND AN              
INTERPRETATION.                 
CERTAINLY IF WE ARE AWARE       

00:22:39.306 --> 00:22:40.038
INTERPRETATION.                 
CERTAINLY IF WE ARE AWARE       
OF THIS FROM THE START WE COULD 

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.773
CERTAINLY IF WE ARE AWARE       
OF THIS FROM THE START WE COULD 
HAVE SITE PLANNED AND COMMON    

00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:42.841
OF THIS FROM THE START WE COULD 
HAVE SITE PLANNED AND COMMON    
AREAS FOR LAUNDRY IN EACH       

00:22:42.843 --> 00:22:43.509
HAVE SITE PLANNED AND COMMON    
AREAS FOR LAUNDRY IN EACH       
BUILDING BUT WE HAVEN&apos;T IT      

00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:46.845
AREAS FOR LAUNDRY IN EACH       
BUILDING BUT WE HAVEN&apos;T IT      
WOULD BE A SIX DELAY ON THE     

00:22:46.847 --> 00:22:47.746
BUILDING BUT WE HAVEN&apos;T IT      
WOULD BE A SIX DELAY ON THE     
PROJECT TO GO BACK AND DO THAT. 

00:22:47.748 --> 00:22:53.886
WOULD BE A SIX DELAY ON THE     
PROJECT TO GO BACK AND DO THAT. 
HOW                             

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.493
    WHAT ARE THE TRAVEL DESIGNS 
FROM ALL UNITS OF THE COMMON    
BUILDING LESS THAN 250 FEET     

00:23:01.495 --> 00:23:07.433
FROM ALL UNITS OF THE COMMON    
BUILDING LESS THAN 250 FEET     
LONG                            

00:23:15.608 --> 00:23:20.946
     FROM THE FURTHEST ONE IS   
THE FURTHEST ONE AND ONLY IT&apos;S  
PROBABLY CLOSE TO 250 FEET.     

00:23:20.948 --> 00:23:27.186
THE FURTHEST ONE AND ONLY IT&apos;S  
PROBABLY CLOSE TO 250 FEET.     
&gt;&gt; YES,                         

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:36.228
        DO YOU FIND IT MUCH     
OF A WALK IN THE OTHER          
FACILITIES?                     

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.895
OF A WALK IN THE OTHER          
FACILITIES?                     
YOU&apos;LL WALK IN THE VALLEY,      

00:23:36.897 --> 00:23:37.562
FACILITIES?                     
YOU&apos;LL WALK IN THE VALLEY,      
DRIVE THE CAR OVER THERE WHERE  

00:23:37.564 --> 00:23:39.664
YOU&apos;LL WALK IN THE VALLEY,      
DRIVE THE CAR OVER THERE WHERE  
YOU ARE YOU GO FROM ONE TO THE  

00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:40.598
DRIVE THE CAR OVER THERE WHERE  
YOU ARE YOU GO FROM ONE TO THE  
OTHER, YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU     

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.567
YOU ARE YOU GO FROM ONE TO THE  
OTHER, YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU     
DON&apos;T HAVE CARS I GUESS I

OTHER, YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU     
DON&apos;T HAVE CARS I GUESS I       
USUALLY MOVE ON ARE ONE AND TWO 

00:23:43.503 --> 00:23:44.236
DON&apos;T HAVE CARS I GUESS I       
USUALLY MOVE ON ARE ONE AND TWO 
BEDROOM HOUSES ARE LESS LIKELY  

00:23:44.238 --> 00:23:47.105
USUALLY MOVE ON ARE ONE AND TWO 
BEDROOM HOUSES ARE LESS LIKELY  
TO HAVE CARS THREE AND FOUR     

00:23:47.107 --> 00:23:47.806
BEDROOM HOUSES ARE LESS LIKELY  
TO HAVE CARS THREE AND FOUR     
BEDROOM FOR WHAT IT&apos;S WORTH.    

00:23:47.808 --> 00:23:48.706
TO HAVE CARS THREE AND FOUR     
BEDROOM FOR WHAT IT&apos;S WORTH.    
SO I PRESUME THE ONE PERSON     

00:23:48.708 --> 00:23:50.342
BEDROOM FOR WHAT IT&apos;S WORTH.    
SO I PRESUME THE ONE PERSON     
HOUSE THEY TEND TO BE WALKING   

00:23:50.344 --> 00:23:54.146
SO I PRESUME THE ONE PERSON     
HOUSE THEY TEND TO BE WALKING   
OVER THE AREA IF YOU DON&apos;T      

00:23:54.148 --> 00:23:54.813

OVER THE AREA IF YOU DON&apos;T      
INCLUDE THE CONNECTION DURING

OVER THE AREA IF YOU DON&apos;T      
INCLUDE THE CONNECTION DURING   
THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION AND
