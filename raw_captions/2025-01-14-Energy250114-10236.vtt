ALSO HELPFUL.

AND THAT DATA AUTOMATION WAS    
ALSO HELPFUL.                   
THE LESS THE PROPERTIES NEED TO 

00:26:39.513 --> 00:26:40.312
ALSO HELPFUL.                   
THE LESS THE PROPERTIES NEED TO

NO USAGE IS COMING THROUGH IS A 

00:34:03.023 --> 00:34:04.055
MIGHT NOT BE A GAP THAT MAY BE  
NO USAGE IS COMING THROUGH IS A 
GAP BUT IF IT'S THREE MONTHS IN

NO USAGE IS COMING THROUGH IS A 
GAP BUT IF IT'S THREE MONTHS IN 
THE WINTER THAT'S UNLIKELY TO

THE WINTER THAT'S UNLIKELY TO   
BE THAT.                        
SO HOW HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND    

00:34:08.428 --> 00:34:09.094
BE THAT.                        
SO HOW HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND    
THAT BETTER WHEN THIS HAPPENS   

00:34:09.096 --> 00:34:11.596
SO HOW HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND    
THAT BETTER WHEN THIS HAPPENS   
SO WORKING WITH DUTY TO BETTER

THAT BETTER WHEN THIS HAPPENS   
SO WORKING WITH DUTY TO BETTER  
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN IT COMES

SO WORKING WITH DUTY TO BETTER  
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN IT COMES   
THROUGH?                        

00:34:15.001 --> 00:34:16.267
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN IT COMES   
THROUGH?                        
THAT SAID, IT IS RARE AND IN    

00:34:16.269 --> 00:34:16.968

WITH EXTENDED GAP OF TWO YEARS  

00:34:18.472 --> 00:34:19.604
THE CASE OF THAT THAT PROPERTY  
WITH EXTENDED GAP OF TWO YEARS  
IT TOOK A FEW MONTHS TO FIX BUT 

00:34:19.606 --> 00:34:22.874
WITH EXTENDED GAP OF TWO YEARS  
IT TOOK A FEW MONTHS TO FIX BUT 
THEY KEPT ON IT WITH US FOR     

00:34:22.876 --> 00:34:23.574
IT TOOK A FEW MONTHS TO FIX BUT 
THEY KEPT ON IT WITH US FOR     
FOUR MONTHS AND IT IS NOW       

00:34:23.576 --> 00:34:25.677
THEY KEPT ON IT WITH US FOR     
FOUR MONTHS AND IT IS NOW       
ALMOST COMPLETELY FIXED ALMOST  

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.911
FOUR MONTHS AND IT IS NOW       
ALMOST COMPLETELY FIXED ALMOST  
ALL THE DATA HAS BEEN HAS BEEN  

00:34:26.913 --> 00:34:27.679
ALMOST COMPLETELY FIXED ALMOST  
ALL THE DATA HAS BEEN HAS BEEN  
CORRECTED SO I CAN'T TAKE TIME  

00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:30.782
ALL THE DATA HAS BEEN HAS BEEN  
CORRECTED SO I CAN'T TAKE TIME  
BUT IT DOES WORK WITH US TO     

00:34:30.784 --> 00:34:31.182
CORRECTED SO I CAN'T TAKE TIME  
BUT IT DOES WORK WITH US TO     
RESOLVE THAT.                   

00:34:31.184 --> 00:34:33.951
BUT IT DOES WORK WITH US TO     
RESOLVE THAT.                   
I'LL NOTE THAT THE DATA HUB HAS 

00:34:33.953 --> 00:34:34.786
RESOLVE THAT.                   
I'LL NOTE THAT THE DATA HUB HAS 
TWO DEDICATED STAFF WHO RUN IT  

00:34:34.788 --> 00:34:35.753
I'LL NOTE THAT THE DATA HUB HAS 
TWO DEDICATED STAFF WHO RUN IT  
SO IT'S IT IS HELPFUL TO HAVE   

00:34:35.755 --> 00:34:37.722
TWO DEDICATED STAFF WHO RUN IT  
SO IT'S IT IS HELPFUL TO HAVE   
TWO SPECIFIC PEOPLE WE WORK     

00:34:37.724 --> 00:34:40.925
SO IT'S IT IS HELPFUL TO HAVE   
TWO SPECIFIC PEOPLE WE WORK     
WITH ON THIS FOR CONSOLATION    

00:34:40.927 --> 00:34:41.392
TWO SPECIFIC PEOPLE WE WORK     
WITH ON THIS FOR CONSOLATION    
ENERGY.                         

00:34:41.394 --> 00:34:42.327
WITH ON THIS FOR CONSOLATION    
ENERGY.                         
WE FIND THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY 

00:34:42.329 --> 00:34:42.727
ENERGY.                         
WE FIND THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY 
VERY ACCURATE.                  

00:34:42.729 --> 00:34:43.461
WE FIND THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY 
VERY ACCURATE.                  
IT'S PRETTY RARE TO HAVE ANY    

00:34:43.463 --> 00:34:46.097
VERY ACCURATE.                  
IT'S PRETTY RARE TO HAVE ANY    
GAPS AT ALL AND IF THERE IS ANY 

00:34:46.099 --> 00:34:49.066
IT'S PRETTY RARE TO HAVE ANY    
GAPS AT ALL AND IF THERE IS ANY 
IT'S USUALLY ONE OR TWO VERY    

00:34:49.068 --> 00:34:49.934
GAPS AT ALL AND IF THERE IS ANY 
IT'S USUALLY ONE OR TWO VERY    
SHORT JUST SOME METER ISSUE AND 

00:34:49.936 --> 00:34:53.338
IT'S USUALLY ONE OR TWO VERY    
SHORT JUST SOME METER ISSUE AND 
IT SKIPS IT READ THE WORST      

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.305
SHORT JUST SOME METER ISSUE AND 
IT SKIPS IT READ THE WORST      
EXAMPLE WE FOUND WAS A PROPERTY 

00:34:54.307 --> 00:34:56.173
IT SKIPS IT READ THE WORST      
EXAMPLE WE FOUND WAS A PROPERTY 
THAT HAD NO GAS USAGE FOR       

00:34:56.175 --> 00:34:57.042
EXAMPLE WE FOUND WAS A PROPERTY 
THAT HAD NO GAS USAGE FOR       
SEVERAL YEARS AND IT WAS JUST A 

00:34:57.044 --> 00:35:00.378
THAT HAD NO GAS USAGE FOR       
SEVERAL YEARS AND IT WAS JUST A 
PHYSICAL METER ISSUE WITH HOW   

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.011
SEVERAL YEARS AND IT WAS JUST A 
PHYSICAL METER ISSUE WITH HOW   
CONSTELLATION USES THEIR        

00:35:01.013 --> 00:35:01.345
PHYSICAL METER ISSUE WITH HOW   
CONSTELLATION USES THEIR        
ENERGY.

CONSTELLATION USES THEIR        
ENERGY.                         
IT ACTUALLY WAS A METER SO WE   

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.849
ENERGY.                         
IT ACTUALLY WAS A METER SO WE   
WORKED WITH CONSTELLATION ADT   

00:35:04.851 --> 00:35:05.616
IT ACTUALLY WAS A METER SO WE   
WORKED WITH CONSTELLATION ADT   
TO FIX THAT METER AND NOW IT'S  

00:35:05.618 --> 00:35:08.252
WORKED WITH CONSTELLATION ADT   
TO FIX THAT METER AND NOW IT'S  
GETTING READINGS.               

00:35:08.254 --> 00:35:09.054
TO FIX THAT METER AND NOW IT'S  
GETTING READINGS.               
SO ONE BENEFIT PRACTICALLY A    

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:11.756
GETTING READINGS.               
SO ONE BENEFIT PRACTICALLY A    
BENCHMARKING THEIR ONE THING WE 

00:35:11.758 --> 00:35:12.490
SO ONE BENEFIT PRACTICALLY A    
BENCHMARKING THEIR ONE THING WE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW IMPACTFUL IT   

00:35:12.492 --> 00:35:15.860
BENCHMARKING THEIR ONE THING WE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW IMPACTFUL IT   
IS BUT CERTAINLY PLAYS A FACTOR 

00:35:15.862 --> 00:35:16.661
I DON'T KNOW HOW IMPACTFUL IT   
IS BUT CERTAINLY PLAYS A FACTOR 
IS THAT PROPERTIES HAVE MUCH    

00:35:16.663 --> 00:35:18.963
IS BUT CERTAINLY PLAYS A FACTOR 
IS THAT PROPERTIES HAVE MUCH    
FEWER CONSTELLATION METERS SO   

00:35:18.965 --> 00:35:19.931
IS THAT PROPERTIES HAVE MUCH    
FEWER CONSTELLATION METERS SO   
THAT PROPERTY THAT HAD HUNDREDS 

00:35:19.933 --> 00:35:20.799
FEWER CONSTELLATION METERS SO   
THAT PROPERTY THAT HAD HUNDREDS 
OF GAPS IN THE METERS OVER TWO

THAT IS GENERALLY VERY ACCURATE 

00:35:35.047 --> 00:35:35.780
WATER DATA TOUCHED ON A BIT     
THAT IS GENERALLY VERY ACCURATE 
AND CAN BE VERY GRANULAR        

00:35:35.782 --> 00:35:38.183
THAT IS GENERALLY VERY ACCURATE 
AND CAN BE VERY GRANULAR        
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE USING YOUR 

00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:38.516
AND CAN BE VERY GRANULAR        
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE USING YOUR 
PORTAL.                         

00:35:38.518 --> 00:35:42.253
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE USING YOUR 
PORTAL.                         
WE FIND THAT ALMOST EVERY GAP   

00:35:42.255 --> 00:35:43.488
PORTAL.                         
WE FIND THAT ALMOST EVERY GAP   
IN THAT DATA IS DUE TO A METER  

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.190
WE FIND THAT ALMOST EVERY GAP   
IN THAT DATA IS DUE TO A METER  
OR METER TRANSMISSION UNIT      

00:35:46.192 --> 00:35:46.790
IN THAT DATA IS DUE TO A METER  
OR METER TRANSMISSION UNIT      
BEING REPLACED.                 

00:35:46.792 --> 00:35:47.691
OR METER TRANSMISSION UNIT      
BEING REPLACED.                 
SO IF A METER BREAKS AND IT     

00:35:47.693 --> 00:35:50.628
BEING REPLACED.                 
SO IF A METER BREAKS AND IT     
NEEDS TO BE REPLACED THAT WILL  

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.462
SO IF A METER BREAKS AND IT     
NEEDS TO BE REPLACED THAT WILL  
RESULT IN THE GAP IN DATA.      

00:35:51.464 --> 00:35:52.296
NEEDS TO BE REPLACED THAT WILL  
RESULT IN THE GAP IN DATA.      
>> IT'S USUALLY PRETTY SHORT.   

00:35:52.298 --> 00:35:54.833
RESULT IN THE GAP IN DATA.      
>> IT'S USUALLY PRETTY SHORT.   
IT CAN BE LONGER IF THERE'S     

00:35:54.835 --> 00:35:55.733
>> IT'S USUALLY PRETTY SHORT.   
IT CAN BE LONGER IF THERE'S     
SOMETHING LIKE A CABLE NEEDS TO 

00:35:55.735 --> 00:35:57.668
IT CAN BE LONGER IF THERE'S     
SOMETHING LIKE A CABLE NEEDS TO 
BE PROCURED THAT IS BACKWARD OR 

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.336
SOMETHING LIKE A CABLE NEEDS TO 
BE PROCURED THAT IS BACKWARD OR 
SOMEWHERE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

SOMEWHERE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 
GAPS THAT WE SEE WITH WATER     

00:36:01.975 --> 00:36:02.840
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 
GAPS THAT WE SEE WITH WATER

GAPS THAT WE SEE WITH WATER     
DATA VERSUS DATA WE SEE ON THE  
ENERGY SIDE SOMETIMES IS THAT   

00:36:05.511 --> 00:36:06.277
DATA VERSUS DATA WE SEE ON THE  
ENERGY SIDE SOMETIMES IS THAT   
WE CAN ALMOST ALWAYS EXPLAIN    

00:36:06.279 --> 00:36:06.945
ENERGY SIDE SOMETIMES IS THAT   
WE CAN ALMOST ALWAYS EXPLAIN    
WHAT THE GAP IS ONE BECAUSE     

00:36:06.947 --> 00:36:09.947
WE CAN ALMOST ALWAYS EXPLAIN    
WHAT THE GAP IS ONE BECAUSE     
IT'S PRETTY RELIABLY SOME KIND  

00:36:09.949 --> 00:36:10.615
WHAT THE GAP IS ONE BECAUSE     
IT'S PRETTY RELIABLY SOME KIND  
OF EQUIPMENT RELATED ISSUE AND  

00:36:10.617 --> 00:36:14.085
IT'S PRETTY RELIABLY SOME KIND  
OF EQUIPMENT RELATED ISSUE AND  
BECAUSE WE ARE THE CITY AND IT

BECAUSE WE ARE THE CITY AND IT  
IS ANOTHER AREA OF OUR

WATER USE ESPECIALLY IT WOULD   
BE INTERESTING TO SEE LIKE      

00:40:31.711 --> 00:40:32.443
WATER USE ESPECIALLY IT WOULD   
BE INTERESTING TO SEE LIKE      
WATER USE IN THE SUMMER VERSUS  

00:40:32.445 --> 00:40:35.980
BE INTERESTING TO SEE LIKE      
WATER USE IN THE SUMMER VERSUS  
WINTER AND HOW MUCH WATER LIKE

WATER USE IN THE SUMMER VERSUS  
WINTER AND HOW MUCH WATER LIKE  
HOW WAS IT LIKE A DROUGHT YEAR  

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:38.749
WINTER AND HOW MUCH WATER LIKE  
HOW WAS IT LIKE A DROUGHT YEAR  
SO WE USED MORE WATER.          

00:40:38.751 --> 00:40:39.583
HOW WAS IT LIKE A DROUGHT YEAR  
SO WE USED MORE WATER.

SO WE USED MORE WATER.          
JUST HOW THAT AFFECTS THE       
OVERALL TRENDS YEAR HERE.       

00:40:42.621 --> 00:40:43.621
JUST HOW THAT AFFECTS THE       
OVERALL TRENDS YEAR HERE.       
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION FOR   

00:40:43.623 --> 00:40:44.021
OVERALL TRENDS YEAR HERE.       
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION FOR   
ENERGY FOR SURE.                

00:40:44.023 --> 00:40:47.258
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION FOR   
ENERGY FOR SURE.                
WHAT THE UI THAT WE ARE USING   

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.761
ENERGY FOR SURE.                
WHAT THE UI THAT WE ARE USING   
IS ENERGY STAR USES REGIONAL    

00:40:50.763 --> 00:40:51.595
WHAT THE UI THAT WE ARE USING   
IS ENERGY STAR USES REGIONAL    
WEATHER DATA TO DO A WEATHER    

00:40:51.597 --> 00:40:54.999
IS ENERGY STAR USES REGIONAL    
WEATHER DATA TO DO A WEATHER    
NORMALIZED UI SO IT TAKES THOSE 

00:40:55.001 --> 00:40:55.799
WEATHER DATA TO DO A WEATHER    
NORMALIZED UI SO IT TAKES THOSE 
THAT WEATHER INTO ACCOUNT YEAR  

00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:56.067
NORMALIZED UI SO IT TAKES THOSE 
THAT WEATHER INTO ACCOUNT YEAR  
TO YEAR.

THAT WEATHER INTO ACCOUNT YEAR  
TO YEAR.                        
SO IT'S MORE APPLES TO APPLES   

00:40:58.972 --> 00:40:59.570
TO YEAR.                        
SO IT'S MORE APPLES TO APPLES   
ACROSS YEAR TO YEAR.            

00:40:59.572 --> 00:41:00.304
SO IT'S MORE APPLES TO APPLES

I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S       
ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR WATER    

00:41:02.042 --> 00:41:05.910
I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S       
ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR WATER

BENEFIT COMMERCIAL AND          
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES THAT ARE 

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.612
BENEFIT COMMERCIAL AND          
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES THAT ARE 
LOOKING TO DECARBONIZE WHAT     

00:53:55.614 --> 00:53:58.649
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES THAT ARE 
LOOKING TO DECARBONIZE WHAT     
WHAT USES SHOULD WE TARGET WHEN 

00:53:58.651 --> 00:53:59.382
LOOKING TO DECARBONIZE WHAT     
WHAT USES SHOULD WE TARGET WHEN 
WE'RE COMPARING THEM ACROSS     

00:53:59.384 --> 00:53:59.849
WHAT USES SHOULD WE TARGET WHEN 
WE'RE COMPARING THEM ACROSS     
PROPERTY USES?                  

00:53:59.851 --> 00:54:01.718
WE'RE COMPARING THEM ACROSS     
PROPERTY USES?                  
WHAT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS?       

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.519
PROPERTY USES?                  
WHAT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS?       
WHAT ARE WE MOST IMPACTFUL      

00:54:02.521 --> 00:54:02.919
WHAT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS?       
WHAT ARE WE MOST IMPACTFUL      
OVERALL?                        

00:54:02.921 --> 00:54:03.653
WHAT ARE WE MOST IMPACTFUL      
OVERALL?                        
WHAT WILL BE MOST IMPACTFUL FOR 

00:54:03.655 --> 00:54:05.789
OVERALL?                        
WHAT WILL BE MOST IMPACTFUL FOR 
A SPECIFIC USE?                 

00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:06.590
WHAT WILL BE MOST IMPACTFUL FOR 
A SPECIFIC USE?                 
SO THAT'S WHERE COMPARING       

00:54:06.592 --> 00:54:09.493
A SPECIFIC USE?                 
SO THAT'S WHERE COMPARING       
ACROSS PROPERTY TYPES COMES IN  

00:54:09.495 --> 00:54:09.693
SO THAT'S WHERE COMPARING       
ACROSS PROPERTY TYPES COMES IN  
.                               

00:54:09.695 --> 00:54:10.761
ACROSS PROPERTY TYPES COMES IN  
.                               
THAT SAID, WHAT OUR PORTFOLIO   

00:54:10.763 --> 00:54:11.561
.                               
THAT SAID, WHAT OUR PORTFOLIO   
MANAGER DOES IS IT COMPARES     

00:54:11.563 --> 00:54:14.431
THAT SAID, WHAT OUR PORTFOLIO   
MANAGER DOES IS IT COMPARES     
APPLES, APPLES, THE ENERGY STAR 

00:54:14.433 --> 00:54:17.034
MANAGER DOES IS IT COMPARES     
APPLES, APPLES, THE ENERGY STAR 
SCORE THAT A FITNESS CENTER     

00:54:17.036 --> 00:54:17.500
APPLES, APPLES, THE ENERGY STAR 
SCORE THAT A FITNESS CENTER     
GETS.                           

00:54:17.502 --> 00:54:17.668
SCORE THAT A FITNESS CENTER     
GETS.                           
>> YES.                         

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.870
GETS.                           
>> YES.                         
SO LIKE THIS ONE FOR EXAMPLE    

00:54:20.872 --> 00:54:21.538
>> YES.                         
SO LIKE THIS ONE FOR EXAMPLE    
MULTIFAMILY I BELIEVE THIS      

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.174
SO LIKE THIS ONE FOR EXAMPLE    
MULTIFAMILY I BELIEVE THIS      
WOULD BE THAT THAT SEVENTY ONE  

00:54:25.176 --> 00:54:25.876
MULTIFAMILY I BELIEVE THIS      
WOULD BE THAT THAT SEVENTY ONE  
PERCENT IS A BELL CURVE.        

00:54:25.878 --> 00:54:29.112
WOULD BE THAT THAT SEVENTY ONE  
PERCENT IS A BELL CURVE.        
SO THAT IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN  

00:54:29.114 --> 00:54:29.646
PERCENT IS A BELL CURVE.        
SO THAT IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN  
SEVENTY ONE PERCENT             

00:54:29.648 --> 00:54:30.514
SO THAT IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN  
SEVENTY ONE PERCENT             
OF COMPARABLE PROPERTIES AND IT 

00:54:30.516 --> 00:54:33.283
SEVENTY ONE PERCENT             
OF COMPARABLE PROPERTIES AND IT 
COMPARES NOT ONLY BY THE        

00:54:33.285 --> 00:54:33.984
OF COMPARABLE PROPERTIES AND IT 
COMPARES NOT ONLY BY THE        
PROPERTY TYPE BUT THE IT THERE  

00:54:33.986 --> 00:54:36.586
COMPARES NOT ONLY BY THE        
PROPERTY TYPE BUT THE IT THERE  
ARE A BUNCH OF CALCULATIONS     

00:54:36.588 --> 00:54:37.687
PROPERTY TYPE BUT THE IT THERE  
ARE A BUNCH OF CALCULATIONS     
THAT DOES ON THE BACK END FOR

THAT DOES ON THE BACK END FOR   
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE PARKING IS   

00:54:40.959 --> 00:54:41.625
THAT DOES ON THE BACK END FOR   
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE PARKING IS   
INCLUDED GETS REALLY SPECIFIC   

00:54:41.627 --> 00:54:44.327

DOWNTOWN THEY HAVE A SMALL      
RESTAURANT UNDERNEATH THAT IS   
ALSO INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL    

00:54:53.339 --> 00:54:56.607
RESTAURANT UNDERNEATH THAT IS   
ALSO INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL    
PROPERTY UI AND IT COMPARES     

00:54:56.609 --> 00:55:00.143
ALSO INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL    
PROPERTY UI AND IT COMPARES     
WHEN YOU LOOK YOUR WEATHER      

00:55:00.145 --> 00:55:00.777
PROPERTY UI AND IT COMPARES     
WHEN YOU LOOK YOUR WEATHER      
NORMALIZED CYBERSOURCE UI AND   

00:55:00.779 --> 00:55:04.247
WHEN YOU LOOK YOUR WEATHER      
NORMALIZED CYBERSOURCE UI AND   
UNDER STAR IT IS GOING TO ALSO  

00:55:04.249 --> 00:55:04.848
NORMALIZED CYBERSOURCE UI AND   
UNDER STAR IT IS GOING TO ALSO  
SHOW YOU THE THE RELATIVE

PROPERTIES OF YOUR SIZE USE AND 
SO ON.                          
SO WHAT WE DID FOCUS ON BROADLY 

00:55:12.024 --> 00:55:14.891
SO ON.                          
SO WHAT WE DID FOCUS ON BROADLY 
THE PORTFOLIO OVERALL ENERGY

00:55:15.694 --> 00:55:18.729
THE PORTFOLIO OVERALL ENERGY    
STAR WHAT IT DOES IS COMPARE    
YOU TO OTHER PROPERTIES SO WHEN 

00:55:18.731 --> 00:55:19.696
STAR WHAT IT DOES IS COMPARE    
YOU TO OTHER PROPERTIES SO WHEN 
WE LOOK INTO DOING THE          

00:55:19.698 --> 00:55:23.200
YOU TO OTHER PROPERTIES SO WHEN 
WE LOOK INTO DOING THE          
SCORECARDS FOR MORE PROPERTIES  

00:55:23.202 --> 00:55:23.867
WE LOOK INTO DOING THE          
SCORECARDS FOR MORE PROPERTIES  
THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S GOING TO   

00:55:23.869 --> 00:55:25.802
SCORECARDS FOR MORE PROPERTIES  
THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S GOING TO   
SHOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IT'S HARD 

00:55:25.804 --> 00:55:26.937
THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S GOING TO   
SHOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IT'S HARD 
TO MAKE OUT HERE I APOLOGIZE    

00:55:26.939 --> 00:55:27.637
SHOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IT'S HARD 
TO MAKE OUT HERE I APOLOGIZE    
BUT IN THAT TOP TRIANGLE        

00:55:27.639 --> 00:55:31.507
TO MAKE OUT HERE I APOLOGIZE    
BUT IN THAT TOP TRIANGLE        
GRAPHIC YOU CAN SEE KIND        

00:55:31.509 --> 00:55:32.242
BUT IN THAT TOP TRIANGLE        
GRAPHIC YOU CAN SEE KIND        
OF WHERE IT'S SITTING RIGHT.    

00:55:32.244 --> 00:55:35.045
GRAPHIC YOU CAN SEE KIND        
OF WHERE IT'S SITTING RIGHT.    
>> SO THERE'S THAT TINY LITTLE  

00:55:35.047 --> 00:55:35.245
OF WHERE IT'S SITTING RIGHT.    
>> SO THERE'S THAT TINY LITTLE  
YEAH.                           

00:55:35.247 --> 00:55:36.446
>> SO THERE'S THAT TINY LITTLE  
YEAH.                           
>> IF I CAN IF I CAN TRUST SOME 

00:55:36.448 --> 00:55:38.549
YEAH.                           
>> IF I CAN IF I CAN TRUST SOME 
ASSURANCES THAT IS WHAT ENERGY  

00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:39.016

ASSURANCES THAT IS WHAT ENERGY  
STAR DOES.                      
SO I DIDN'T FOCUS ON IT AS MUCH 

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:42.886
STAR DOES.                      
SO I DIDN'T FOCUS ON IT AS MUCH 
HERE BUT CERTAINLY AS WE WERE   

00:55:42.888 --> 00:55:43.754
SO I DIDN'T FOCUS ON IT AS MUCH 
HERE BUT CERTAINLY AS WE WERE   
LOOKING AT WHAT TO DO WITH THIS

01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:39.128
PLANTS BUT IT'S WEIRD THEY HAVE 
FLOW METERS FOR ALL THE METERS  
THROUGH THERE AND WE FOUND THAT

HAPPENING AND IF THERE'S GIVEN  
IF THAT WERE TRUE, ONE MIGHT    
IMAGINE THAT SOME SOME          

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:23.972
IF THAT WERE TRUE, ONE MIGHT    
IMAGINE THAT SOME SOME          
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AROUND       

01:24:23.974 --> 01:24:24.439
IMAGINE THAT SOME SOME          
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AROUND       
BENCHMARKING MIGHT BE           

01:24:24.441 --> 01:24:28.009
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AROUND       
BENCHMARKING MIGHT BE           
BENEFICIAL AND FOR THOSE OTHER  

01:24:28.011 --> 01:24:28.676
BENCHMARKING MIGHT BE           
BENEFICIAL AND FOR THOSE OTHER  
BUILDINGS THAT MIGHT BE HAVING  

01:24:28.678 --> 01:24:31.779
BENEFICIAL AND FOR THOSE OTHER  
BUILDINGS THAT MIGHT BE HAVING  
TROUBLE NAVIGATING THAT WHICH I 

01:24:31.781 --> 01:24:32.480
BUILDINGS THAT MIGHT BE HAVING  
TROUBLE NAVIGATING THAT WHICH I 
THINK IS ALREADY THERE OR       

01:24:32.482 --> 01:24:34.949
TROUBLE NAVIGATING THAT WHICH I 
THINK IS ALREADY THERE OR       
HAPPENING BUT CAN I CLARIFY     

01:24:34.951 --> 01:24:35.550
THINK IS ALREADY THERE OR       
HAPPENING BUT CAN I CLARIFY     
IT'S NOT THIS SLIDE.            

01:24:35.552 --> 01:24:38.787
HAPPENING BUT CAN I CLARIFY     
IT'S NOT THIS SLIDE.            
>> IT'S THE COMPLIANCE FOR THE  

01:24:38.789 --> 01:24:39.654
IT'S NOT THIS SLIDE.            
>> IT'S THE COMPLIANCE FOR THE  
CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE 

01:24:39.656 --> 01:24:42.691
>> IT'S THE COMPLIANCE FOR THE  
CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE 
OR FOR THIS AS WELL.            

01:24:42.693 --> 01:24:43.792
CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE 
OR FOR THIS AS WELL.            
>> I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON BOTH.   

01:24:43.794 --> 01:24:44.926
OR FOR THIS AS WELL.            
>> I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON BOTH.   
YEAH I BELIEVE I THINK IT WAS   

01:24:44.928 --> 01:24:47.262
>> I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON BOTH.   
YEAH I BELIEVE I THINK IT WAS   
THE I THINK IT WAS THIS ONE     

01:24:47.264 --> 01:24:47.495
YEAH I BELIEVE I THINK IT WAS   
THE I THINK IT WAS THIS ONE     
YES.                            

01:24:47.497 --> 01:24:50.265
THE I THINK IT WAS THIS ONE     
YES.                            
>> SO THIS IS WHEN WE LOOKED AT 

01:24:50.267 --> 01:24:51.132
YES.                            
>> SO THIS IS WHEN WE LOOKED AT 
THE METRICS FOR WHO IS          

01:24:51.134 --> 01:24:51.866
>> SO THIS IS WHEN WE LOOKED AT 
THE METRICS FOR WHO IS          
BENCHMARKING ACTUALLY I THINK   

01:24:51.868 --> 01:24:54.336
THE METRICS FOR WHO IS          
BENCHMARKING ACTUALLY I THINK   
THIS IN THE START OF THE REPORT 

01:24:54.338 --> 01:24:55.103
BENCHMARKING ACTUALLY I THINK   
THIS IN THE START OF THE REPORT 
BUT IN THE METRICS IN THE       

01:24:55.105 --> 01:24:58.072
THIS IN THE START OF THE REPORT 
BUT IN THE METRICS IN THE       
REPORT FOR WHO'S BENCHMARKING   

01:24:58.074 --> 01:24:58.773
BUT IN THE METRICS IN THE       
REPORT FOR WHO'S BENCHMARKING   
WE LOOKED AT EVERYBODY WHO HAS  

01:24:58.775 --> 01:25:01.943
REPORT FOR WHO'S BENCHMARKING   
WE LOOKED AT EVERYBODY WHO HAS  
STARTED BECAUSE WE KNOW WHO     

01:25:01.945 --> 01:25:02.844
WE LOOKED AT EVERYBODY WHO HAS  
STARTED BECAUSE WE KNOW WHO     
THEY ARE, WHAT THEY ARE, HOW    

01:25:02.846 --> 01:25:05.413
STARTED BECAUSE WE KNOW WHO     
THEY ARE, WHAT THEY ARE, HOW    
BIG THEY ARE FOR COMPLIANCE AND 

01:25:05.415 --> 01:25:06.281
THEY ARE, WHAT THEY ARE, HOW    
BIG THEY ARE FOR COMPLIANCE AND 
THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE METRICS. 

01:25:06.283 --> 01:25:06.814
BIG THEY ARE FOR COMPLIANCE AND 
THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE METRICS. 
WE LOOKED AT COMPLIANT          

01:25:06.816 --> 01:25:08.716
THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE METRICS. 
WE LOOKED AT COMPLIANT          
PROPERTIES BECAUSE THOSE        

01:25:08.718 --> 01:25:09.317
WE LOOKED AT COMPLIANT          
PROPERTIES BECAUSE THOSE        
OF THOSE ARE COMPLIANT.         

01:25:09.319 --> 01:25:12.387
PROPERTIES BECAUSE THOSE        
OF THOSE ARE COMPLIANT.         
THEY'RE GENERALLY ACCURATE DATA 

01:25:12.389 --> 01:25:13.088
OF THOSE ARE COMPLIANT.         
THEY'RE GENERALLY ACCURATE DATA 
PARTICIPATING PROPERTIES COULD  

01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:13.889
THEY'RE GENERALLY ACCURATE DATA 
PARTICIPATING PROPERTIES COULD  
BE SOMEONE WHO HAS SET UP THEIR 

01:25:13.891 --> 01:25:16.524
PARTICIPATING PROPERTIES COULD  
BE SOMEONE WHO HAS SET UP THEIR 
ACCOUNT AND HAS GAS DATA BUT NO 

01:25:16.526 --> 01:25:17.425
BE SOMEONE WHO HAS SET UP THEIR 
ACCOUNT AND HAS GAS DATA BUT NO 
ELECTRIC DATA, NO WATER DATA.   

01:25:17.427 --> 01:25:20.828
ACCOUNT AND HAS GAS DATA BUT NO 
ELECTRIC DATA, NO WATER DATA.   
SO HERE FOR PARTICIPATION THIS  

01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:21.630
ELECTRIC DATA, NO WATER DATA.   
SO HERE FOR PARTICIPATION THIS  
IS JUST FOLKS WHO HAVE STARTED  

01:25:21.632 --> 01:25:22.030
SO HERE FOR PARTICIPATION THIS  
IS JUST FOLKS WHO HAVE STARTED  
AND WON.                        

01:25:22.032 --> 01:25:24.699
IS JUST FOLKS WHO HAVE STARTED  
AND WON.                        
SO GETTING TO BE KIND OF A LONG 

01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:25.333
AND WON.                        
SO GETTING TO BE KIND OF A LONG 
AND MAYBE SPECIFIC ANSWER ON    

01:25:25.335 --> 01:25:26.034
SO GETTING TO BE KIND OF A LONG 
AND MAYBE SPECIFIC ANSWER ON    
PROPERTY USE ISN'T THAT         

01:25:26.036 --> 01:25:29.104
AND MAYBE SPECIFIC ANSWER ON    
PROPERTY USE ISN'T THAT         
INTRICACIES WE WHEN WE WERE     

01:25:29.106 --> 01:25:29.904
PROPERTY USE ISN'T THAT         
INTRICACIES WE WHEN WE WERE     
FOCUSING ON COMPLIANCE BECAUSE  

01:25:29.906 --> 01:25:32.140
INTRICACIES WE WHEN WE WERE     
FOCUSING ON COMPLIANCE BECAUSE  
OF HOW THE COMPLIANCE AND       

01:25:32.142 --> 01:25:32.841
FOCUSING ON COMPLIANCE BECAUSE  
OF HOW THE COMPLIANCE AND       
ENFORCEMENT IS PHASED IN, WE    

01:25:32.843 --> 01:25:35.810
OF HOW THE COMPLIANCE AND       
ENFORCEMENT IS PHASED IN, WE    
FIRST LOOKED AT TWENTY TWENTY   

01:25:35.812 --> 01:25:36.544
ENFORCEMENT IS PHASED IN, WE    
FIRST LOOKED AT TWENTY TWENTY   
ONE CALENDAR YEAR LARGER        

01:25:36.546 --> 01:25:37.178
FIRST LOOKED AT TWENTY TWENTY   
ONE CALENDAR YEAR LARGER        
PROPERTIES TENDED TO BE THOSE   

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.048
ONE CALENDAR YEAR LARGER        
PROPERTIES TENDED TO BE THOSE   
MULTIFAMILY OFFICE PROPERTIES.  

01:25:40.050 --> 01:25:41.149
PROPERTIES TENDED TO BE THOSE   
MULTIFAMILY OFFICE PROPERTIES.  
SO BY NATURE OF THE JUST THE    

01:25:41.151 --> 01:25:43.518
MULTIFAMILY OFFICE PROPERTIES.  
SO BY NATURE OF THE JUST THE    
CHRONOLOGICAL PRIORITIZATION    

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.719
SO BY NATURE OF THE JUST THE    
CHRONOLOGICAL PRIORITIZATION    
THEY WERE THE MORE OFFICE AND   

01:25:44.721 --> 01:25:48.189
CHRONOLOGICAL PRIORITIZATION    
THEY WERE THE MORE OFFICE AND   
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES HAVE     

01:25:48.191 --> 01:25:48.557
THEY WERE THE MORE OFFICE AND   
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES HAVE     
STARTED.                        

01:25:48.559 --> 01:25:51.693
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES HAVE     
STARTED.                        
I'M ACTUALLY NOT I COULD I      

01:25:51.695 --> 01:25:52.527
STARTED.                        
I'M ACTUALLY NOT I COULD I      
COULD LOOK INTO THIS MORE       

01:25:52.529 --> 01:25:53.195
I'M ACTUALLY NOT I COULD I      
COULD LOOK INTO THIS MORE       
SPECIFICALLY BUT IT MAY NOT     

01:25:53.197 --> 01:25:53.895
COULD LOOK INTO THIS MORE       
SPECIFICALLY BUT IT MAY NOT     
EVEN BE THE CASE THAT           

01:25:53.897 --> 01:25:56.297
SPECIFICALLY BUT IT MAY NOT     
EVEN BE THE CASE THAT           
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES ARE MORE 

01:25:56.299 --> 01:25:57.064
EVEN BE THE CASE THAT           
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES ARE MORE 
COMPLIANT THAN OTHER PROPERTIES 

01:25:57.066 --> 01:25:57.699
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES ARE MORE 
COMPLIANT THAN OTHER PROPERTIES 
WHEN YOU GET TO THE NUMBER      

01:25:57.701 --> 01:26:00.134
COMPLIANT THAN OTHER PROPERTIES 
WHEN YOU GET TO THE NUMBER      
OF PROPERTIES IN TERMS          

01:26:00.136 --> 01:26:03.771
WHEN YOU GET TO THE NUMBER      
OF PROPERTIES IN TERMS          
OF PARTICIPATION THAT IS AT     

01:26:03.773 --> 01:26:04.605
OF PROPERTIES IN TERMS          
OF PARTICIPATION THAT IS AT     
LEAST PART OF WHY MULTIFAMILY   

01:26:04.607 --> 01:26:08.110
OF PARTICIPATION THAT IS AT     
LEAST PART OF WHY MULTIFAMILY   
PROPERTIES ARE A HIGH PERCENT   

01:26:08.112 --> 01:26:09.010
LEAST PART OF WHY MULTIFAMILY   
PROPERTIES ARE A HIGH PERCENT   
ONE THEY ARE A LOT OF SQUARE    

01:26:09.012 --> 01:26:09.911
PROPERTIES ARE A HIGH PERCENT   
ONE THEY ARE A LOT OF SQUARE    
FOOTAGE AND THEY ARE A LOT      

01:26:09.913 --> 01:26:12.380
ONE THEY ARE A LOT OF SQUARE    
FOOTAGE AND THEY ARE A LOT      
OF PROPERTIES BUT WE FOCUS ON   

01:26:12.382 --> 01:26:13.081
FOOTAGE AND THEY ARE A LOT      
OF PROPERTIES BUT WE FOCUS ON   
THOSE LARGER PROPERTIES THAT    

01:26:13.083 --> 01:26:15.917
OF PROPERTIES BUT WE FOCUS ON   
THOSE LARGER PROPERTIES THAT    
TEND TO BE THOSE IN TERMS       

01:26:15.919 --> 01:26:16.884
THOSE LARGER PROPERTIES THAT    
TEND TO BE THOSE IN TERMS       
OF WHAT IS WHAT IS EASIEST AND  

01:26:16.886 --> 01:26:19.087
TEND TO BE THOSE IN TERMS       
OF WHAT IS WHAT IS EASIEST AND  
THE BARRIERS.                   

01:26:19.089 --> 01:26:19.855
OF WHAT IS WHAT IS EASIEST AND  
THE BARRIERS.                   
I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE    

01:26:19.857 --> 01:26:22.858
THE BARRIERS.                   
I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE    
HOW THAT SHAKES.                

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:27.195
I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE    
HOW THAT SHAKES.                
AS WE ALLUDED TO EARLIER, LARGE 

01:26:27.197 --> 01:26:27.963
HOW THAT SHAKES.                
AS WE ALLUDED TO EARLIER, LARGE 
PROPERTIES CAN HAVE A LOT THAT  

01:26:27.965 --> 01:26:28.796
AS WE ALLUDED TO EARLIER, LARGE 
PROPERTIES CAN HAVE A LOT THAT  
THEY HAVE TO WORK OUT IF YOU    

01:26:28.798 --> 01:26:31.432
PROPERTIES CAN HAVE A LOT THAT  
THEY HAVE TO WORK OUT IF YOU    
HAVE HUNDREDS OF METERS, HOW    

01:26:31.434 --> 01:26:32.300
THEY HAVE TO WORK OUT IF YOU    
HAVE HUNDREDS OF METERS, HOW    
MANY ARE THERE WHAT ARE THE     

01:26:32.302 --> 01:26:34.135
HAVE HUNDREDS OF METERS, HOW    
MANY ARE THERE WHAT ARE THE     
SERVICE ADDRESSES?              

01:26:34.137 --> 01:26:34.770
MANY ARE THERE WHAT ARE THE     
SERVICE ADDRESSES?              
DO YOU HAVE IRRIGATION?         

01:26:34.772 --> 01:26:35.403
SERVICE ADDRESSES?              
DO YOU HAVE IRRIGATION?         
DO YOU HAVE THIS?               

01:26:35.405 --> 01:26:37.773
DO YOU HAVE IRRIGATION?         
DO YOU HAVE THIS?               
DO YOU HAVE THAT THE PROPERTIES 

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:38.607
DO YOU HAVE THIS?               
DO YOU HAVE THAT THE PROPERTIES 
THEMSELVES GET MORE COMPLICATED 

01:26:38.609 --> 01:26:42.109
DO YOU HAVE THAT THE PROPERTIES 
THEMSELVES GET MORE COMPLICATED 
AND BENCHMARKING SUPPORT OR     

01:26:42.111 --> 01:26:42.877
THEMSELVES GET MORE COMPLICATED 
AND BENCHMARKING SUPPORT OR     
UTILITY BUILDING COMPANIES,     

01:26:42.879 --> 01:26:43.111
AND BENCHMARKING SUPPORT OR     
UTILITY BUILDING COMPANIES,     
DON'T IT?                       

01:26:43.113 --> 01:26:46.514
UTILITY BUILDING COMPANIES,     
DON'T IT?                       
IT HELPS BUT THEY ARE OFTEN NOT 

01:26:46.516 --> 01:26:46.782
DON'T IT?                       
IT HELPS BUT THEY ARE OFTEN NOT 
ON SITE.                        

01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:47.815
IT HELPS BUT THEY ARE OFTEN NOT 
ON SITE.                        
SO IT IS KIND OF A CONVERSATION 

01:26:47.817 --> 01:26:49.884
ON SITE.                        
SO IT IS KIND OF A CONVERSATION 
AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE.          

01:26:49.886 --> 01:26:51.285
SO IT IS KIND OF A CONVERSATION 
AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE.          
WE HAD A I HAD A CALL WITH THE  

01:26:51.287 --> 01:26:51.953
AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE.          
WE HAD A I HAD A CALL WITH THE  
TWENTY THIRTY DISTRICT AND      

01:26:51.955 --> 01:26:53.187
WE HAD A I HAD A CALL WITH THE  
TWENTY THIRTY DISTRICT AND      
EIGHT MEMBERS FROM PROPERTY     

01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.888
TWENTY THIRTY DISTRICT AND      
EIGHT MEMBERS FROM PROPERTY     
SUPPORT GROUP BECAUSE THEY HAD  

01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:54.623
EIGHT MEMBERS FROM PROPERTY     
SUPPORT GROUP BECAUSE THEY HAD  
TWO PROPERTIES IN THE CITY AND  

01:26:54.625 --> 01:26:56.924
SUPPORT GROUP BECAUSE THEY HAD  
TWO PROPERTIES IN THE CITY AND  
DIFFERENT PEOPLE WORKING        

01:26:56.926 --> 01:26:57.559
TWO PROPERTIES IN THE CITY AND  
DIFFERENT PEOPLE WORKING        
DIFFERENT PROPERTIES.           

01:26:57.561 --> 01:26:58.193
DIFFERENT PEOPLE WORKING        
DIFFERENT PROPERTIES.           
SO GETTING EVERYONE TOGETHER TO 

01:26:58.195 --> 01:27:00.862
DIFFERENT PROPERTIES.           
SO GETTING EVERYONE TOGETHER TO 
TRY TO WORK THROUGH THAT WHEN   

01:27:00.864 --> 01:27:01.863
SO GETTING EVERYONE TOGETHER TO 
TRY TO WORK THROUGH THAT WHEN   
YOU HAVE A SMALLER PROPERTY YOU 

01:27:01.865 --> 01:27:02.597
TRY TO WORK THROUGH THAT WHEN   
YOU HAVE A SMALLER PROPERTY YOU 
MAY HAVE LESS PEOPLE TO WORK    

01:27:02.599 --> 01:27:05.400
YOU HAVE A SMALLER PROPERTY YOU 
MAY HAVE LESS PEOPLE TO WORK    
THROUGH BUT THEY HAVE LESS      

01:27:05.402 --> 01:27:06.067
MAY HAVE LESS PEOPLE TO WORK    
THROUGH BUT THEY HAVE LESS      
RESOURCES TO DEDICATE TO        

01:27:06.069 --> 01:27:06.734
THROUGH BUT THEY HAVE LESS      
RESOURCES TO DEDICATE TO        
HELPING YOU WITH THAT.          

01:27:06.736 --> 01:27:08.469
RESOURCES TO DEDICATE TO        
HELPING YOU WITH THAT.          
SO I IMAGINE THERE'S GOING TO   

01:27:08.471 --> 01:27:09.037
HELPING YOU WITH THAT.          
SO I IMAGINE THERE'S GOING TO   
BE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES.        

01:27:09.039 --> 01:27:09.971
SO I IMAGINE THERE'S GOING TO   
BE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES.        
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IS GOING 

01:27:09.973 --> 01:27:12.607
BE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES.        
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IS GOING 
TO BE HARDER OR IF ONE WILL BE  

01:27:12.609 --> 01:27:16.043
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IS GOING 
TO BE HARDER OR IF ONE WILL BE  
HARDER IN TERMS OF SPECIFICALLY 

01:27:16.045 --> 01:27:16.578
TO BE HARDER OR IF ONE WILL BE  
HARDER IN TERMS OF SPECIFICALLY 
A SMALLER PROPERTY.             

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.312
HARDER IN TERMS OF SPECIFICALLY 
A SMALLER PROPERTY.             
THERE'S JUST PROBABLY FEWER
