LEARNED SO MUCH IT WAS          
WONDERFUL AND ONE OF THE THINGS 

00:35:24.106 --> 00:35:26.972
LEARNED SO MUCH IT WAS          
WONDERFUL AND ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT CAME OUT OF IT IS THAT     

00:35:26.974 --> 00:35:27.607
WONDERFUL AND ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT CAME OUT OF IT IS THAT     
CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR MIDDLE   

00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:30.176
THAT CAME OUT OF IT IS THAT     
CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR MIDDLE   
INCOME FAMILIES EXCEEDS THE     

00:35:30.178 --> 00:35:34.647
CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR MIDDLE   
INCOME FAMILIES EXCEEDS THE     
MARKET RATE OF THAT PROPERTY IN 

00:35:34.649 --> 00:35:35.582
INCOME FAMILIES EXCEEDS THE     
MARKET RATE OF THAT PROPERTY IN 
AN HOUR AND THAT MEANS THAT     

00:35:35.584 --> 00:35:39.052
MARKET RATE OF THAT PROPERTY IN 
AN HOUR AND THAT MEANS THAT     
PRIVATE DEVELOP WILL NOT BE     

00:35:39.054 --> 00:35:42.922
AN HOUR AND THAT MEANS THAT     
PRIVATE DEVELOP WILL NOT BE     
BUILDING MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING  

00:35:42.924 --> 00:35:43.389
PRIVATE DEVELOP WILL NOT BE     
BUILDING MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING  
IN ANN ARBOR.                   

00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:46.659
BUILDING MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING  
IN ANN ARBOR.                   
IT&apos;S NOT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE   

00:35:46.661 --> 00:35:47.693
IN ANN ARBOR.                   
IT&apos;S NOT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE   
BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO BUILD     

00:35:47.695 --> 00:35:51.497
IT&apos;S NOT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE   
BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO BUILD     
THOUSANDS OF UNITS AND THAT IS  

00:35:51.499 --> 00:35:54.133
BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO BUILD     
THOUSANDS OF UNITS AND THAT IS  
WITH COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS      

00:35:54.135 --> 00:35:57.603
THOUSANDS OF UNITS AND THAT IS  
WITH COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS      
WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY     

00:35:57.605 --> 00:35:58.471
WITH COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS      
WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY     
OF MICHIGAN, THE COUNTY RIGHT   

00:35:58.473 --> 00:35:59.405
WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY     
OF MICHIGAN, THE COUNTY RIGHT   
NOW IS LOOKING AT A HOUSING     

00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:03.042
OF MICHIGAN, THE COUNTY RIGHT   
NOW IS LOOKING AT A HOUSING     
COMMISSION THAT WOULD SUPPORT   

00:36:03.044 --> 00:36:03.876
NOW IS LOOKING AT A HOUSING     
COMMISSION THAT WOULD SUPPORT   
NOT ONLY LOW INCOME HOUSING BUT 

00:36:03.878 --> 00:36:06.913
COMMISSION THAT WOULD SUPPORT   
NOT ONLY LOW INCOME HOUSING BUT 
ALSO MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING.     

00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:08.048
NOT ONLY LOW INCOME HOUSING BUT 
ALSO MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING.     
SO I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING  

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.317
ALSO MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING.     
SO I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING  
TO HAVE SOME PLANS THAT THEY&apos;RE 

00:36:11.319 --> 00:36:12.051
SO I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING  
TO HAVE SOME PLANS THAT THEY&apos;RE 
VERY COMPLICATED BUT ARE GOING  

00:36:12.053 --> 00:36:15.354
TO HAVE SOME PLANS THAT THEY&apos;RE 
VERY COMPLICATED BUT ARE GOING  
TO BE MADE PUBLIC IN THE NEXT   

00:36:15.356 --> 00:36:15.755
VERY COMPLICATED BUT ARE GOING  
TO BE MADE PUBLIC IN THE NEXT   
FEW WEEKS.                      

00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:18.491
TO BE MADE PUBLIC IN THE NEXT   
FEW WEEKS.                      
AND SO AGAIN, I DON&apos;T THINK     

00:36:18.493 --> 00:36:19.292
FEW WEEKS.                      
AND SO AGAIN, I DON&apos;T THINK     
IT&apos;S THE CITY&apos;S RESPONSIBILITY
