WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING IS TO   

01:21:19.397 --> 01:21:22.730
THEY&amp;apos;RE VERY SIMILAR.           
WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING IS TO   
REMIND YOU WOULD BE 30 EVC      

01:21:22.732 --> 01:21:26.367
WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING IS TO   
REMIND YOU WOULD BE 30 EVC      
SPACES AND SEVEN EVA INSTALL    

01:21:26.369 --> 01:21:27.236
REMIND YOU WOULD BE 30 EVC      
SPACES AND SEVEN EVA INSTALL    
WHAT THE NEW CODE WOULD REQUIRE 

01:21:27.238 --> 01:21:34.376
SPACES AND SEVEN EVA INSTALL    
WHAT THE NEW CODE WOULD REQUIRE 
WOULD 33 SPACES AND SIX EVA     

01:21:34.378 --> 01:21:34.710
WHAT THE NEW CODE WOULD REQUIRE 
WOULD 33 SPACES AND SIX EVA     
INSTALLED.                      

01:21:34.712 --> 01:21:38.346
WOULD 33 SPACES AND SIX EVA     
INSTALLED.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THEY&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY THEY&amp;apos;RE  

01:21:38.348 --> 01:21:39.014
INSTALLED.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THEY&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY THEY&amp;apos;RE  
PROVIDING ONE MORE INSTALL      

01:21:39.016 --> 01:21:41.016
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THEY&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY THEY&amp;apos;RE  
PROVIDING ONE MORE INSTALL      
SPACES THAN WOULD BE REQUIRED   

01:21:41.018 --> 01:21:42.183
PROVIDING ONE MORE INSTALL      
SPACES THAN WOULD BE REQUIRED   
AND THEN THERE&amp;apos;D BE TWO SPACES  

01:21:42.185 --> 01:21:45.754
SPACES THAN WOULD BE REQUIRED   
AND THEN THERE&amp;apos;D BE TWO SPACES  
THAT WOULD FOR THE EVA CAPABLE. 

01:21:45.756 --> 01:21:46.688
AND THEN THERE&amp;apos;D BE TWO SPACES  
THAT WOULD FOR THE EVA CAPABLE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOWEVER I THINK THAT AND     

01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:49.524
THAT WOULD FOR THE EVA CAPABLE. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOWEVER I THINK THAT AND     
AGAIN IT&amp;apos;S KIND OF SIMILAR I    

01:21:49.526 --> 01:21:50.391
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOWEVER I THINK THAT AND     
AGAIN IT&amp;apos;S KIND OF SIMILAR I    
WASN&amp;apos;T SURE IF THEY&amp;apos;RE IN THE   

01:21:50.393 --> 01:21:51.059
AGAIN IT&amp;apos;S KIND OF SIMILAR I    
WASN&amp;apos;T SURE IF THEY&amp;apos;RE IN THE   
BACKGROUND OF OUR DECISION      

01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:53.595
WASN&amp;apos;T SURE IF THEY&amp;apos;RE IN THE   
BACKGROUND OF OUR DECISION      
MAKING PROCESS OR THESE NUMBERS 

01:21:53.597 --> 01:21:54.463
BACKGROUND OF OUR DECISION      
MAKING PROCESS OR THESE NUMBERS 
SEEM TO MIRROR WHAT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY  

01:21:54.465 --> 01:21:54.863
MAKING PROCESS OR THESE NUMBERS 
SEEM TO MIRROR WHAT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY  
BEING PROPOSED.                 

01:21:54.865 --> 01:21:56.798
SEEM TO MIRROR WHAT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY  
BEING PROPOSED.                 
I THINK GIVEN THAT THERE&amp;apos;S THAT 

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.632
BEING PROPOSED.                 
I THINK GIVEN THAT THERE&amp;apos;S THAT 
ERROR THE CAPITAL COUPLE SPACE  

01:21:57.634 --> 01:22:00.435
I THINK GIVEN THAT THERE&amp;apos;S THAT 
ERROR THE CAPITAL COUPLE SPACE  
IS WHAT THAT IS BECAUSE I&amp;apos;M     

01:22:00.437 --> 01:22:01.236
ERROR THE CAPITAL COUPLE SPACE  
IS WHAT THAT IS BECAUSE I&amp;apos;M     
SURE IT&amp;apos;S DUE TO A ROUNDING     

01:22:01.238 --> 01:22:01.569
IS WHAT THAT IS BECAUSE I&amp;apos;M     
SURE IT&amp;apos;S DUE TO A ROUNDING     
ERROR.                          

01:22:01.571 --> 01:22:04.506
SURE IT&amp;apos;S DUE TO A ROUNDING     
ERROR.                          
BOTH OF THESE LIKE FOR INSTANCE 

01:22:04.508 --> 01:22:05.339
ERROR.                          
BOTH OF THESE LIKE FOR INSTANCE 
THE CAPABLE SPACE HAS COME UP.  

01:22:05.341 --> 01:22:08.143
BOTH OF THESE LIKE FOR INSTANCE 
THE CAPABLE SPACE HAS COME UP.  
IT&amp;apos;S THIRTY TWO POINT ONE       

01:22:08.145 --> 01:22:09.010
THE CAPABLE SPACE HAS COME UP.  
IT&amp;apos;S THIRTY TWO POINT ONE       
OBVIOUSLY IN MOST CASES AS      

01:22:09.012 --> 01:22:09.744
IT&amp;apos;S THIRTY TWO POINT ONE       
OBVIOUSLY IN MOST CASES AS      
WE&amp;apos;VE LEARNED YOU ROUND DOWN    

01:22:09.746 --> 01:22:12.613
OBVIOUSLY IN MOST CASES AS      
WE&amp;apos;VE LEARNED YOU ROUND DOWN    
THE THIRTY TWO BUT WE DO NOT DO 

01:22:12.615 --> 01:22:13.281
WE&amp;apos;VE LEARNED YOU ROUND DOWN    
THE THIRTY TWO BUT WE DO NOT DO 
THAT FOR PARKING SPACES WE      

01:22:13.283 --> 01:22:13.615
THE THIRTY TWO BUT WE DO NOT DO 
THAT FOR PARKING SPACES WE      
ROUND UP.                       

01:22:13.617 --> 01:22:16.418
THAT FOR PARKING SPACES WE      
ROUND UP.                       
SO THAT&amp;apos;S KIND OF REALLY THAT   

01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.251
ROUND UP.                       
SO THAT&amp;apos;S KIND OF REALLY THAT   
WHERE THIS DIFFERENCE IS COMING 

01:22:17.253 --> 01:22:17.919
SO THAT&amp;apos;S KIND OF REALLY THAT   
WHERE THIS DIFFERENCE IS COMING 
UP WHERE I SAY THERE ARE THIRTY 

01:22:17.921 --> 01:22:19.954
WHERE THIS DIFFERENCE IS COMING 
UP WHERE I SAY THERE ARE THIRTY 
THREE REQUIRED IS THE THIRTY    

01:22:19.956 --> 01:22:20.589
UP WHERE I SAY THERE ARE THIRTY 
THREE REQUIRED IS THE THIRTY    
TWO POINT ONE TO ROUNDED UP     

01:22:20.591 --> 01:22:23.458
THREE REQUIRED IS THE THIRTY    
TWO POINT ONE TO ROUNDED UP     
EVEN IF IT&amp;apos;S A TENTH OF A       

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.325
TWO POINT ONE TO ROUNDED UP     
EVEN IF IT&amp;apos;S A TENTH OF A       
PERCENT SO THEY ARE VERY CLOSE  

01:22:24.327 --> 01:22:24.993
EVEN IF IT&amp;apos;S A TENTH OF A       
PERCENT SO THEY ARE VERY CLOSE  
TO PROVIDING ONE MORE INSTALLED 

01:22:24.995 --> 01:22:27.629
PERCENT SO THEY ARE VERY CLOSE  
TO PROVIDING ONE MORE INSTALLED 
SPACE THREE LESS THREE LESS     

01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:31.766
TO PROVIDING ONE MORE INSTALLED 
SPACE THREE LESS THREE LESS     
CAPABLE SPACES BUT AGAIN REALLY 

01:22:31.768 --> 01:22:32.467
SPACE THREE LESS THREE LESS     
CAPABLE SPACES BUT AGAIN REALLY 
ONLY TWO LESS THAN WHAT WOULD   

01:22:32.469 --> 01:22:34.969
CAPABLE SPACES BUT AGAIN REALLY 
ONLY TWO LESS THAN WHAT WOULD   
BE REQUIRED IF WE WOULD BASED   

01:22:34.971 --> 01:22:35.637
ONLY TWO LESS THAN WHAT WOULD   
BE REQUIRED IF WE WOULD BASED   
ON NEW STANDARDS SORRY IF THE   

01:22:35.639 --> 01:22:38.339
BE REQUIRED IF WE WOULD BASED   
ON NEW STANDARDS SORRY IF THE   
NEW STANDARDS ARE APPROVED ON   

01:22:38.341 --> 01:22:38.740

THIS PART.

NEW STANDARDS ARE APPROVED ON   
THIS PART.                      
SO THERE&amp;apos;S TWO CAPABLE SPACES   

01:22:42.545 --> 01:22:43.478
THIS PART.                      
SO THERE&amp;apos;S TWO CAPABLE SPACES   
THAT THEY ARE PROPOSING ON THE  

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:43.878
SO THERE&amp;apos;S TWO CAPABLE SPACES   
THAT THEY ARE PROPOSING ON THE  
OTHER SIDE.                     

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.481
THAT THEY ARE PROPOSING ON THE  
OTHER SIDE.                     
WHAT I WILL KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY 

01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:47.249
OTHER SIDE.                     
WHAT I WILL KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY 
THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS AS WE  

01:22:47.251 --> 01:22:50.017
WHAT I WILL KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY 
THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS AS WE  
SAY THEY&amp;apos;RE GOING FORWARD THE

01:23:05.635 --> 01:23:06.501
GENERAL PLANNING COMMISSION.    
THIS DOES HAVE THE

SCHEDULED WITHIN A COUPLE       
OF MONTHS.                      
SO PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD    

01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:13.875

I DON&amp;apos;T MIND ANSWERING IT       

01:25:47.898 --> 01:25:48.497
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FAIR QUESTION.               
I DON&amp;apos;T MIND ANSWERING IT       
ACTUALLY THAT THAT IS A         

01:25:48.499 --> 01:25:49.164

OUTSIDE MY CONTROL BUT IT WAS   
AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION AND  

01:25:52.368 --> 01:25:55.436
OUTSIDE MY CONTROL BUT IT WAS   
AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION AND  
REALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT   

01:25:55.438 --> 01:25:56.370
AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION AND  
REALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT   
IS STILL TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT 

01:25:56.372 --> 01:25:59.407
REALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT   
IS STILL TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT 
OF PEOPLE IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE  

01:25:59.409 --> 01:25:59.807
IS STILL TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT 
OF PEOPLE IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE  
AT ONE TIME.                    

01:25:59.809 --> 01:26:02.210

MUCH MORE THAN THAN THAT.       

01:26:03.012 --> 01:26:04.012
SO I CAN&amp;apos;T REALLY ANSWER IT     
MUCH MORE THAN THAN THAT.       
BUT AGAIN, THAT&amp;apos;S KIND OF A     

01:26:04.014 --> 01:26:07.582
MUCH MORE THAN THAN THAT.       
BUT AGAIN, THAT&amp;apos;S KIND OF A     
DECISION IF YOU DO HAVE AN      

01:26:07.584 --> 01:26:08.116
BUT AGAIN, THAT&amp;apos;S KIND OF A     
DECISION IF YOU DO HAVE AN      
ISSUE WITH IT.                  

01:26:08.118 --> 01:26:10.184

ISSUE WITH IT.

01:26:14.124 --> 01:26:14.589
PLEASE SPEAK TO THE HIGHER UPS. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WHO&amp;apos;S WHO MADE THAT       
DECISION?                       

01:26:14.591 --> 01:26:15.457
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WHO&amp;apos;S WHO MADE THAT       
DECISION?                       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK IT WAS A WHOLE       

01:26:15.459 --> 01:26:18.159
DECISION?                       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK IT WAS A WHOLE       
ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION.        

01:26:18.161 --> 01:26:18.960
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK IT WAS A WHOLE       
ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION.        
THIS IS LIKE THIS FOR MANY      

01:26:18.962 --> 01:26:22.296
ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION.        
THIS IS LIKE THIS FOR MANY      
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS EVEN AS  

01:26:22.298 --> 01:26:22.964
THIS IS LIKE THIS FOR MANY      
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS EVEN AS  
WELL AS FOR CITY COUNCIL        

01:26:22.966 --> 01:26:23.431
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS EVEN AS

WELL AS FOR CITY COUNCIL        
MEETINGS AS WELL.               
SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SAY TO SPECIFIC WHO  

01:26:26.035 --> 01:26:26.968
MEETINGS AS WELL.               
SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SAY TO SPECIFIC WHO  
WOULD MAKE THE DECISION BUT I   

01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:27.669
SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SAY TO SPECIFIC WHO  
WOULD MAKE THE DECISION BUT I   
KNOW THAT THIS IS FOR ALL       

01:26:27.671 --> 01:26:30.205
WOULD MAKE THE DECISION BUT I   
KNOW THAT THIS IS FOR ALL       
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, NOT     

01:26:30.207 --> 01:26:31.072
KNOW THAT THIS IS FOR ALL       
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, NOT     
JUST FOR ZONING BOARD           

01:26:31.074 --> 01:26:33.908
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, NOT     
JUST FOR ZONING BOARD           
OF APPEALS.                     

01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:37.112
JUST FOR ZONING BOARD
