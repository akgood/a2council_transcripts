00:27:04.631 --> 00:27:07.799
THINKING ABOUT THE SCENARIOS    
FIRST FOR THE ORIGINAL DISTRICT 
WE'RE ASSUMING THAT A HISTORIC  

00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:08.500
FIRST FOR THE ORIGINAL DISTRICT 
WE'RE ASSUMING THAT A HISTORIC  
GROWTH RATE OF ABOUT NINE       

00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:09.234
WE'RE ASSUMING THAT A HISTORIC  
GROWTH RATE OF ABOUT NINE       
PERCENT WILL CONTINUE OVER THE  

00:27:09.236 --> 00:27:12.403
GROWTH RATE OF ABOUT NINE       
PERCENT WILL CONTINUE OVER THE  
NEXT TEN YEAR PERIOD OF TIME    

00:27:12.405 --> 00:27:13.371
PERCENT WILL CONTINUE OVER THE  
NEXT TEN YEAR PERIOD OF TIME    
FOR THE EXPANDED AREAS WE USE   

00:27:13.373 --> 00:27:16.341
NEXT TEN YEAR PERIOD OF TIME    
FOR THE EXPANDED AREAS WE USE   
TWO DIFFERENT RATES DEPENDING   

00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:19.644
FOR THE EXPANDED AREAS WE USE   
TWO DIFFERENT RATES DEPENDING   
ON THE AREAS SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN  

00:27:19.646 --> 00:27:20.779
TWO DIFFERENT RATES DEPENDING   
ON THE AREAS SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN  
OR WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE      

00:27:20.781 --> 00:27:21.379
ON THE AREAS SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN

A GROWTH RATE OF NINE PERCENT   

00:27:24.918 --> 00:27:28.153
HAPPENING.                      
A GROWTH RATE OF NINE PERCENT   
WAS USED FOR THAT AREA AND THEN 

00:27:28.155 --> 00:27:28.921
A GROWTH RATE OF NINE PERCENT   
WAS USED FOR THAT AREA AND THEN 
NORTH OF DOWNTOWN A MORE MODEST 

00:27:28.923 --> 00:27:32.223
WAS USED FOR THAT AREA AND THEN 
NORTH OF DOWNTOWN A MORE MODEST 
GROWTH RATE OF ABOUT THREE AND  

00:27:32.225 --> 00:27:32.891
NORTH OF DOWNTOWN A MORE MODEST 
GROWTH RATE OF ABOUT THREE AND  
A HALF PERCENT WAS USED WHICH   

00:27:32.893 --> 00:27:35.026
GROWTH RATE OF ABOUT THREE AND  
A HALF PERCENT WAS USED WHICH   
IS MORE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE   

00:27:35.028 --> 00:27:35.894
A HALF PERCENT WAS USED WHICH   
IS MORE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE   
HISTORIC PACE OF CHANGE IN THAT 

00:27:35.896 --> 00:27:38.731
IS MORE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE   
HISTORIC PACE OF CHANGE IN THAT

ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE GAIN      

00:30:42.916 --> 00:30:44.483
BUT THEN LOOKS AT WHAT CAN BE   
ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE GAIN      
SHARE MODEL IN PLACE.           

00:30:44.485 --> 00:30:45.517
ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE GAIN      
SHARE MODEL IN PLACE.           
SO THIS APPROACH PROVIDES MORE  

00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:46.184
SHARE MODEL IN PLACE.           
SO THIS APPROACH PROVIDES MORE  
FUNDING ABOUT NINE MILLION      

00:30:46.186 --> 00:30:49.988
SO THIS APPROACH PROVIDES MORE  
FUNDING ABOUT NINE MILLION      
ANNUALLY RELATIVE TO THAT TEN   

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.722
FUNDING ABOUT NINE MILLION      
ANNUALLY RELATIVE TO THAT TEN   
MILLION AND NEED IN OTHER WORDS 

00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.991
ANNUALLY RELATIVE TO THAT TEN   
MILLION AND NEED IN OTHER WORDS 
THE DDA CAN ACCOMPLISH MORE     

00:30:52.993 --> 00:30:53.725
MILLION AND NEED IN OTHER WORDS 
THE DDA CAN ACCOMPLISH MORE     
OF THESE MORE OF THESE PROJECTS 

00:30:53.727 --> 00:30:56.427
THE DDA CAN ACCOMPLISH MORE     
OF THESE MORE OF THESE PROJECTS 
OR CONTRIBUTE A GREATER AMOUNT  

00:30:56.429 --> 00:30:56.795
OF THESE MORE OF THESE PROJECTS 
OR CONTRIBUTE A GREATER AMOUNT  
TOWARDS THAT.                   

00:30:56.797 --> 00:30:57.829
OR CONTRIBUTE A GREATER AMOUNT  
TOWARDS THAT.                   
NINETY EIGHT MILLION IN TOTAL   

00:30:57.831 --> 00:31:00.999
TOWARDS THAT.                   
NINETY EIGHT MILLION IN TOTAL   
NEED AND WITH THIS SHIFT IT     

00:31:01.001 --> 00:31:04.436
NINETY EIGHT MILLION IN TOTAL   
NEED AND WITH THIS SHIFT IT     
WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A     

00:31:04.438 --> 00:31:05.169
NEED AND WITH THIS SHIFT IT     
WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A     
DOWNTOWN SERVICE TEAM TO BE     

00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:05.837
WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A     
DOWNTOWN SERVICE TEAM TO BE     
IMPLEMENTED AND THE AMOUNT      

00:31:05.839 --> 00:31:08.873
DOWNTOWN SERVICE TEAM TO BE     
IMPLEMENTED AND THE AMOUNT      
OF FUNDING GOING TO THE         

00:31:08.875 --> 00:31:09.608
IMPLEMENTED AND THE AMOUNT      
OF FUNDING GOING TO THE         
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND WOULD   

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.443
OF FUNDING GOING TO THE         
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND WOULD   
BE INCREASED.                   

00:31:12.445 --> 00:31:13.545
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND WOULD   
BE INCREASED.                   
SO NOW FOR SCENARIO C AND D     

00:31:13.547 --> 00:31:16.114
BE INCREASED.                   
SO NOW FOR SCENARIO C AND D     
SIMILAR APPROACH BUT THIS IS    

00:31:16.116 --> 00:31:16.748
SO NOW FOR SCENARIO C AND D     
SIMILAR APPROACH BUT THIS IS    
NOW LOOKING AT THE AREAS WHERE  

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.818
SIMILAR APPROACH BUT THIS IS    
NOW LOOKING AT THE AREAS WHERE  
THE BOUNDARY IS EXPANDED AND    

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.619
NOW LOOKING AT THE AREAS WHERE  
THE BOUNDARY IS EXPANDED AND    
THAT MIX IS INCLUDED AND THEN   

00:31:20.621 --> 00:31:23.755
THE BOUNDARY IS EXPANDED AND    
THAT MIX IS INCLUDED AND THEN   
LOOKING AT WHETHER AGAIN GAIN   

00:31:23.757 --> 00:31:24.423
THAT MIX IS INCLUDED AND THEN   
LOOKING AT WHETHER AGAIN GAIN   
SHARE MODELS ARE INCLUDED IN    

00:31:24.425 --> 00:31:27.425
LOOKING AT WHETHER AGAIN GAIN   
SHARE MODELS ARE INCLUDED IN    
THAT OR NOT.                    

00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:28.393
SHARE MODELS ARE INCLUDED IN    
THAT OR NOT.                    
SO WITH AN EXPANDED BOUNDARY    

00:31:28.395 --> 00:31:31.329
THAT OR NOT.                    
SO WITH AN EXPANDED BOUNDARY    
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE PROJECTS 

00:31:31.331 --> 00:31:32.197
SO WITH AN EXPANDED BOUNDARY    
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE PROJECTS 
IN THAT POTENTIAL 10 YEAR       

00:31:32.199 --> 00:31:32.831
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE PROJECTS 
IN THAT POTENTIAL 10 YEAR

THAT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND    
FIFTY MILLION AND IDENTIFIED

IT KEEPS THE CAP IN PLACE.      

00:31:46.647 --> 00:31:47.545
SWITCH TO THE GAIN SHARE MODEL. 
IT KEEPS THE CAP IN PLACE.      
THIS IS NOW ABOUT FIFTEEN

SOME REALLY KIND OF CRITICAL    

00:41:06.406 --> 00:41:09.373
THAT'S LOOKING AT WHERE THERE'S 
SOME REALLY KIND OF CRITICAL    
CORRIDORS TO ADDRESS FROM A

UNDERSTAND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES   
THERE ARE AND IF IT STAYS WITH

OF THAT CORRIDOR THAT MAY       
CHANGE THE OPPORTUNITY BUT      

00:50:18.691 --> 00:50:20.624
OF THAT CORRIDOR THAT MAY       
CHANGE THE OPPORTUNITY BUT      
COULD STILL BE IMPROVEMENTS     

00:50:20.626 --> 00:50:21.558
CHANGE THE OPPORTUNITY BUT      
COULD STILL BE IMPROVEMENTS     
WOULD STILL BE ADVANCED ALONG   

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:21.892
COULD STILL BE IMPROVEMENTS

01:06:48.045 --> 01:06:51.781
WE WOULD VERIFY THAT IT WAS     
CONSTRUCTED PER THE PLANS.      
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT SO EASY TO   

01:06:51.783 --> 01:06:52.715
CONSTRUCTED PER THE PLANS.      
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT SO EASY TO   
GO TO THE GARAGE AND SAY HEY,   

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:53.450
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT SO EASY TO   
GO TO THE GARAGE AND SAY HEY,   
THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE
