I KNOW OTHER CITIES WITH MUCH   
MORE SEVERE BUDGET PRESSURES    
SOMETIMES HAVE TO GO SO FAR AS

WE DON&apos;T GO THAT FAR.           
I THINK WE WILL TAKE A DOCTOR&apos;S

00:25:30.238 --> 00:25:30.904
I THINK WE WILL TAKE A DOCTOR&apos;S

SAID YOU MADE A DISTINCTION     

00:25:30.906 --> 00:25:33.907

SAID YOU MADE A DISTINCTION     
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE 

00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:34.908
SAID YOU MADE A DISTINCTION     
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE 
TO RIDE THE CITY BUS FOR FREE   

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:35.576
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE 
TO RIDE THE CITY BUS FOR FREE   
AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD HAVE  

00:25:35.578 --> 00:25:38.645
TO RIDE THE CITY BUS FOR FREE   
AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD HAVE  
TO I ASSUME PAY FOR A RIDE.     

00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:41.515
AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD HAVE  
TO I ASSUME PAY FOR A RIDE.     
WHAT IS THAT CHARGE?            

00:25:41.517 --> 00:25:41.982
TO I ASSUME PAY FOR A RIDE.     
WHAT IS THAT CHARGE?            
&gt;&gt; SURE.                        

00:25:41.984 --> 00:25:45.718
WHAT IS THAT CHARGE?            
&gt;&gt; SURE.                        
SO AND AGAIN THE RIDE           

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.556
&gt;&gt; SURE.                        
SO AND AGAIN THE RIDE           
PARATRANSIT SYSTEMS UNDER THE   

00:25:49.558 --> 00:25:50.457
SO AND AGAIN THE RIDE           
PARATRANSIT SYSTEMS UNDER THE   
ADA WERE SET UP TO KIND         

00:25:50.459 --> 00:25:53.727
PARATRANSIT SYSTEMS UNDER THE   
ADA WERE SET UP TO KIND         
OF MIRROR A FIXED ROUTE SYSTEM. 

00:25:53.729 --> 00:25:57.397
ADA WERE SET UP TO KIND         
OF MIRROR A FIXED ROUTE SYSTEM. 
SO ADA SAYS THAT TRANSIT        

00:25:57.399 --> 00:26:00.166
OF MIRROR A FIXED ROUTE SYSTEM. 
SO ADA SAYS THAT TRANSIT        
AGENCIES I THINK CAN CHARGE UP  

00:26:00.168 --> 00:26:01.301
SO ADA SAYS THAT TRANSIT        
AGENCIES I THINK CAN CHARGE UP  
TO DOUBLE THE FIXED ROUTE FARE  

00:26:01.303 --> 00:26:04.805
AGENCIES I THINK CAN CHARGE UP  
TO DOUBLE THE FIXED ROUTE FARE  
TO USE PARATRANSIT AND HERE&apos;S   

00:26:04.807 --> 00:26:08.075
TO DOUBLE THE FIXED ROUTE FARE  
TO USE PARATRANSIT AND HERE&apos;S   
WHY CONGRESS ALLOWED THAT THE   

00:26:08.077 --> 00:26:09.175
TO USE PARATRANSIT AND HERE&apos;S   
WHY CONGRESS ALLOWED THAT THE   
COST TO CARRY SOMEONE ON THE    

00:26:09.177 --> 00:26:16.016
WHY CONGRESS ALLOWED THAT THE   
COST TO CARRY SOMEONE ON THE    
BIG BUS IS ABOUT FIVE BUCKS.    

00:26:16.018 --> 00:26:17.016
COST TO CARRY SOMEONE ON THE    
BIG BUS IS ABOUT FIVE BUCKS.    
THE COST TO CARRY SOMEONE ON    

00:26:17.018 --> 00:26:20.120
BIG BUS IS ABOUT FIVE BUCKS.    
THE COST TO CARRY SOMEONE ON    
THE PARATRANSIT VEHICLE LAST I  

00:26:20.122 --> 00:26:20.888
THE COST TO CARRY SOMEONE ON    
THE PARATRANSIT VEHICLE LAST I  
SAW WAS AROUND FORTY DOLLARS    

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.356
THE PARATRANSIT VEHICLE LAST I  
SAW WAS AROUND FORTY DOLLARS    
PER TRIP IN EACH CASE AND       

00:26:23.358 --> 00:26:24.124
SAW WAS AROUND FORTY DOLLARS    
PER TRIP IN EACH CASE AND       
THAT&apos;S JUST THE DIFFERENCE      

00:26:24.126 --> 00:26:24.724
PER TRIP IN EACH CASE AND       
THAT&apos;S JUST THE DIFFERENCE      
OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE.          

00:26:24.726 --> 00:26:28.328
THAT&apos;S JUST THE DIFFERENCE      
OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE.          
THE PARATRANSIT SYSTEM IS       

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.162
OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE.          
THE PARATRANSIT SYSTEM IS       
SIMPLY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE PER  

00:26:29.164 --> 00:26:32.566
THE PARATRANSIT SYSTEM IS       
SIMPLY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE PER  
TRIP SO CONGRESS ALLOWED THAT   

00:26:32.568 --> 00:26:33.466
SIMPLY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE PER  
TRIP SO CONGRESS ALLOWED THAT   
DIFFERENCE IN THE FARES TO HELP 

00:26:33.468 --> 00:26:36.570
TRIP SO CONGRESS ALLOWED THAT   
DIFFERENCE IN THE FARES TO HELP 
COMPENSATE FOR THAT HERE.       

00:26:36.572 --> 00:26:39.373
DIFFERENCE IN THE FARES TO HELP 
COMPENSATE FOR THAT HERE.       
I THINK WE FOLLOW THAT LAW WITH 

00:26:39.375 --> 00:26:40.174
COMPENSATE FOR THAT HERE.       
I THINK WE FOLLOW THAT LAW WITH 
OUR OUR FARES FOR A-ROD.        

00:26:40.176 --> 00:26:43.343
I THINK WE FOLLOW THAT LAW WITH 
OUR OUR FARES FOR A-ROD.        
WHAT&apos;S DIFFERENT IN ANN ARBOR?  

00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:44.278
OUR OUR FARES FOR A-ROD.        
WHAT&apos;S DIFFERENT IN ANN ARBOR?  
THIS GETS TO YOUR QUESTION WE

DISABILITY IS THERE IS AN       
INCOME RESTRICTION BASED ON IF  

01:54:39.850 --> 01:54:46.621
DISABILITY IS THERE IS AN       
INCOME RESTRICTION BASED ON IF  
THEY HAVE SSI AND OR SS AND HOW 

01:54:46.623 --> 01:54:47.622

SSD.                            
RIGHT.                          
SO THAT&apos;S ALSO A RESTRICTION.   

01:54:50.827 --> 01:54:51.760
RIGHT.                          
SO THAT&apos;S ALSO A RESTRICTION.   
HOWEVER, JUST IN GENERAL PEOPLE

01:55:18.654 --> 01:55:20.889
       I DO THINK THAT MAKING   
SURE THAT THERE IS A FAIR WAGE  
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE             

01:55:20.891 --> 01:55:21.689

IT MAY NOT BE THAT IF THEY&apos;RE   
GOING FROM A SUB MINIMUM WAGE   

01:55:23.093 --> 01:55:23.792
IT MAY NOT BE THAT IF THEY&apos;RE   
GOING FROM A SUB MINIMUM WAGE   
TO A TRUE MINIMUM AGE THAT      

01:55:23.794 --> 01:55:24.459
GOING FROM A SUB MINIMUM WAGE   
TO A TRUE MINIMUM AGE THAT      
THEY&apos;RE NOT GOING TO WORK AS    

01:55:24.461 --> 01:55:25.226

MAKING MORE MONEY OR MAKING UP  

01:55:25.963 --> 01:55:26.428
MANY HOURS BUT THEY ALSO MAY BE 
MAKING MORE MONEY OR MAKING UP  
FOR THAT.                       

01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.961
MAKING MORE MONEY OR MAKING UP  
FOR THAT.                       
AND SO I DON&apos;T I DON&apos;T          

01:55:26.963 --> 01:55:27.629

SUB MINIMUM WAGE, IT&apos;S A IT&apos;S A 
IT&apos;S A VERY SMALL PIECE OF THE  
ENTIRE PICTURE AS AS IT GOES

WITH EMPLOYMENT FOR FOLKS WITH  
DISABILITIES.                   
THIS IS THAT THESE ARE          

01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:11.166
DISABILITIES.                   
THIS IS THAT THESE ARE          
EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN   

01:57:11.168 --> 01:57:16.038
THIS IS THAT THESE ARE          
EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN   
SPECIFIC PERMISSION THROUGH A   

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:16.838
EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN

DISABILITIES AT SOME MINIMUM    
WAGE.                           
SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT&apos;S 

01:57:21.778 --> 01:57:24.846
WAGE.                           
SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT&apos;S 
DONE ACROSS THE BOARD BY WELL   

01:57:24.848 --> 01:57:25.813
SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT&apos;S 
DONE ACROSS THE BOARD BY WELL   
IT COULD BE DONE I GUESS IN     

01:57:25.815 --> 01:57:28.616
DONE ACROSS THE BOARD BY WELL   
IT COULD BE DONE I GUESS IN     
THEORY ACROSS THE BOARD AND     

01:57:28.618 --> 01:57:29.417
IT COULD BE DONE I GUESS IN     
THEORY ACROSS THE BOARD AND     
THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL AS WELL.  

01:57:29.419 --> 01:57:32.087
THEORY ACROSS THE BOARD AND     
THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL AS WELL.  
BUT IT&apos;S TO END THIS LEGALIZED  

01:57:32.089 --> 01:57:32.754
THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL AS WELL.  
BUT IT&apos;S TO END THIS LEGALIZED  
PRACTICE OF ENDING SUB MINIMUM  

01:57:32.756 --> 01:57:35.623
BUT IT&apos;S TO END THIS LEGALIZED  
PRACTICE OF ENDING SUB MINIMUM  
WAGE FOR EMPLOYERS AND PUSHING  

01:57:35.625 --> 01:57:36.390
PRACTICE OF ENDING SUB MINIMUM  
WAGE FOR EMPLOYERS AND PUSHING  
EMPLOYERS ALL EMPLOYERS TO MAKE 

01:57:36.392 --> 01:57:39.494
WAGE FOR EMPLOYERS AND PUSHING

OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.    

01:57:47.237 --> 01:57:48.302
EQUITABLE SPACES FOR EMPLOYMENT 
OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.    
AND SO REALLY THIS IS I THINK I 

01:57:48.304 --> 01:57:49.037
OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.    
AND SO REALLY THIS IS I THINK I 
THINK THIS WOULD BE A GREAT     

01:57:49.039 --> 01:57:50.439
