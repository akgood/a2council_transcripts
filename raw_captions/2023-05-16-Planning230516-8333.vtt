THE FAILURE OF WHAT EIGHTY FIVE 
FEET WOULD DO ON THIS SITE AND  
A LOT OF THE THE GOALS OF THE   

01:06:53.439 --> 01:06:54.172
FEET WOULD DO ON THIS SITE AND  
A LOT OF THE THE GOALS OF THE   
PROJECT WE FELT IT WAS THE      

01:06:54.174 --> 01:06:56.173
A LOT OF THE THE GOALS OF THE   
PROJECT WE FELT IT WAS THE      
RIGHT SCALE FOR THE FOR THE     

01:06:56.175 --> 01:06:59.510
PROJECT WE FELT IT WAS THE      
RIGHT SCALE FOR THE FOR THE     
NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE ALSO USE    

01:06:59.512 --> 01:07:00.344
RIGHT SCALE FOR THE FOR THE     
NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE ALSO USE    
THE SETBACKS THAT WERE ON THE   

01:07:00.346 --> 01:07:04.081
NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE ALSO USE    
THE SETBACKS THAT WERE ON THE   
CHART AND WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH 

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:08.018
THE SETBACKS THAT WERE ON THE   
CHART AND WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH 
THAT MAKES IT I A PROPER USE    

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:08.819
CHART AND WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH 
THAT MAKES IT I A PROPER USE    
AND EVERYTHING WE WANTED TO DO  

01:07:08.821 --> 01:07:11.856
THAT MAKES IT I A PROPER USE    
AND EVERYTHING WE WANTED TO DO  
WOULD FIT IT CAME TO THE        

01:07:11.858 --> 01:07:12.590
AND EVERYTHING WE WANTED TO DO  
WOULD FIT IT CAME TO THE        
VARIANCE OF OF THE PARKING      

01:07:12.592 --> 01:07:14.859
WOULD FIT IT CAME TO THE        
VARIANCE OF OF THE PARKING      
WHICH WE CAN TALK LATER BUT     

01:07:14.861 --> 01:07:15.660
VARIANCE OF OF THE PARKING      
WHICH WE CAN TALK LATER BUT     
THAT&apos;S OUR ONLY ONLY VARIANCE   

01:07:15.662 --> 01:07:18.562
WHICH WE CAN TALK LATER BUT     
THAT&apos;S OUR ONLY ONLY VARIANCE   
ON TOP OF THAT.                 

01:07:18.564 --> 01:07:22.367
THAT&apos;S OUR ONLY ONLY VARIANCE   
ON TOP OF THAT.                 
OK, SO THEN WITH THE PARKING    

01:07:22.369 --> 01:07:23.301
ON TOP OF THAT.                 
OK, SO THEN WITH THE PARKING    
CAN YOU BRING BACK UP YOUR      

01:07:23.303 --> 01:07:26.371
OK, SO THEN WITH THE PARKING    
CAN YOU BRING BACK UP YOUR      
SLIDES WHERE YOU SHOWED THE     

01:07:26.373 --> 01:07:27.305
CAN YOU BRING BACK UP YOUR      
SLIDES WHERE YOU SHOWED THE     
OPTIONS FOR THE VARIANCE TO US  

01:07:27.307 --> 01:07:27.839
SLIDES WHERE YOU SHOWED THE     
OPTIONS FOR THE VARIANCE TO US  
HAVE CONTROL.                   

01:07:27.841 --> 01:07:34.711
OPTIONS FOR THE VARIANCE TO US  
HAVE CONTROL.                   
YEAH IT&apos;S A FEW SLIDES BACK     

01:07:34.713 --> 01:07:41.552
HAVE CONTROL.                   
YEAH IT&apos;S A FEW SLIDES BACK     
RIGHT OK SO THEN IF THE         

01:07:41.554 --> 01:07:45.289
YEAH IT&apos;S A FEW SLIDES BACK     
RIGHT OK SO THEN IF THE         
VARIANCES AT THE ZIBA IS DENIED 

01:07:45.291 --> 01:07:46.356
RIGHT OK SO THEN IF THE         
VARIANCES AT THE ZIBA IS DENIED 
WHICH HOW HOW ARE YOU PLANNING  

01:07:46.358 --> 01:07:49.326
VARIANCES AT THE ZIBA IS DENIED 
WHICH HOW HOW ARE YOU PLANNING  
TO ADDRESS THAT OR IS THIS IF   

01:07:49.328 --> 01:07:50.128
WHICH HOW HOW ARE YOU PLANNING  
TO ADDRESS THAT OR IS THIS IF   
IT&apos;S DENIED OR HOW WE ADDRESS   

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:52.930
TO ADDRESS THAT OR IS THIS IF   
IT&apos;S DENIED OR HOW WE ADDRESS   
THE VARIANCE YOU CAN DO BOTH.   

01:07:52.932 --> 01:07:54.065
IT&apos;S DENIED OR HOW WE ADDRESS   
THE VARIANCE YOU CAN DO BOTH.   
&gt;&gt; I MEAN AS YOU SEE HERE WE    

01:07:54.067 --> 01:07:57.068
THE VARIANCE YOU CAN DO BOTH.   
&gt;&gt; I MEAN AS YOU SEE HERE WE    
LAID OUT OUR FIVE WHAT WE WE    

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:57.835
&gt;&gt; I MEAN AS YOU SEE HERE WE    
LAID OUT OUR FIVE WHAT WE WE    
LOOKED AT AS OPTIONS WHAT WOULD 

01:07:57.837 --> 01:08:01.239
LAID OUT OUR FIVE WHAT WE WE    
LOOKED AT AS OPTIONS WHAT WOULD 
BE BUY RIGHT AND THE FOUR DOWN  

01:08:01.241 --> 01:08:04.575
LOOKED AT AS OPTIONS WHAT WOULD 
BE BUY RIGHT AND THE FOUR DOWN  
BELOW WE ALWAYS MISS SOMETHING  

01:08:04.577 --> 01:08:08.279
BE BUY RIGHT AND THE FOUR DOWN  
BELOW WE ALWAYS MISS SOMETHING  
IN THE PROJECT IF IT&apos;S DENIED   

01:08:08.281 --> 01:08:09.413
BELOW WE ALWAYS MISS SOMETHING  
IN THE PROJECT IF IT&apos;S DENIED   
IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S A FAILURE.    

01:08:09.415 --> 01:08:13.017
IN THE PROJECT IF IT&apos;S DENIED   
IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S A FAILURE.    
WE WOULDN&apos;T HAVE THE ABILITY TO 

01:08:13.019 --> 01:08:14.184
IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S A FAILURE.    
WE WOULDN&apos;T HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
HAVE AS MUCH OF A PARK ON TOP   

01:08:14.186 --> 01:08:17.188
WE WOULDN&apos;T HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
HAVE AS MUCH OF A PARK ON TOP   
OF THAT AREA AS WHAT WOULD BE   

01:08:17.190 --> 01:08:20.057
HAVE AS MUCH OF A PARK ON TOP   
OF THAT AREA AS WHAT WOULD BE   
MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE PROJECT. 

01:08:20.059 --> 01:08:21.059
OF THAT AREA AS WHAT WOULD BE   
MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE PROJECT. 
SO I THINK WITH THE TECHNICAL   

01:08:21.061 --> 01:08:24.161
MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE PROJECT. 
SO I THINK WITH THE TECHNICAL   
FEASIBILITY OF BUILDING A WATER 

01:08:24.163 --> 01:08:24.862
SO I THINK WITH THE TECHNICAL   
FEASIBILITY OF BUILDING A WATER 
DETENTION INTO THE WATER TABLE  

01:08:24.864 --> 01:08:25.596
FEASIBILITY OF BUILDING A WATER 
DETENTION INTO THE WATER TABLE  
WE HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH WATER     

01:08:25.598 --> 01:08:28.433
DETENTION INTO THE WATER TABLE  
WE HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH WATER     
TABLE IN THIS THIS AREA THAT    

01:08:28.435 --> 01:08:31.702
WE HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH WATER     
TABLE IN THIS THIS AREA THAT    
EVEN GETTING THE PARKING        

01:08:31.704 --> 01:08:32.570
TABLE IN THIS THIS AREA THAT    
EVEN GETTING THE PARKING        
HALFWAY DOWN GAVE THE VOLUME    

01:08:32.572 --> 01:08:33.003
EVEN GETTING THE PARKING        
HALFWAY DOWN GAVE THE VOLUME    
HALFWAY DOWN.                   

01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:35.840
HALFWAY DOWN GAVE THE VOLUME    
HALFWAY DOWN.                   
WE LOOKED AT THAT AS WELL.      

01:08:35.842 --> 01:08:36.841
HALFWAY DOWN.                   
WE LOOKED AT THAT AS WELL.      
WE&apos;D STILL BE PUSHING DOWN INTO 

01:08:36.843 --> 01:08:37.608
WE LOOKED AT THAT AS WELL.      
WE&apos;D STILL BE PUSHING DOWN INTO 
THE WATER TABLE AND THEN OUR    

01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:39.677
WE&apos;D STILL BE PUSHING DOWN INTO 
THE WATER TABLE AND THEN OUR    
WATER OUR STORMWATER RETENTION  

01:08:39.679 --> 01:08:40.544
THE WATER TABLE AND THEN OUR    
WATER OUR STORMWATER RETENTION  
WHICH IS FAIRLY LARGE WOULD     

01:08:40.546 --> 01:08:43.681
WATER OUR STORMWATER RETENTION  
WHICH IS FAIRLY LARGE WOULD     
ALSO BE IN THERE.               

01:08:43.683 --> 01:08:44.949
WHICH IS FAIRLY LARGE WOULD     
ALSO BE IN THERE.               
SO IF THOSE FOUR ALWAYS MISSED  

01:08:44.951 --> 01:08:47.585
ALSO BE IN THERE.               
SO IF THOSE FOUR ALWAYS MISSED  
SOMETHING AND THE VARIANCE GETS 

01:08:47.587 --> 01:08:50.854
SO IF THOSE FOUR ALWAYS MISSED  
SOMETHING AND THE VARIANCE GETS 
EVERYTHING FOR EVERY PART       

01:08:50.856 --> 01:08:51.455
SOMETHING AND THE VARIANCE GETS 
EVERYTHING FOR EVERY PART       
OF THE PROJECT STORMWATER       

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:54.859
EVERYTHING FOR EVERY PART       
OF THE PROJECT STORMWATER       
PARKING THAT THAT&apos;S NEEDED      

01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:55.959
OF THE PROJECT STORMWATER       
PARKING THAT THAT&apos;S NEEDED      
THERE AND THEN PARK ON TOP FOR  

01:08:55.961 --> 01:08:58.829
PARKING THAT THAT&apos;S NEEDED      
THERE AND THEN PARK ON TOP FOR  
FOR EVERYONE.                   

01:08:58.831 --> 01:08:59.964
THERE AND THEN PARK ON TOP FOR  
FOR EVERYONE.                   
SO THEN WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT AND I  

01:08:59.966 --> 01:09:00.697
FOR EVERYONE.                   
SO THEN WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT AND I  
DID SEND SOME QUESTIONS TO      

01:09:00.699 --> 01:09:03.501
SO THEN WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT AND I  
DID SEND SOME QUESTIONS TO      
STAFF WHEN WHEN THIS GOT ON OUR 

01:09:03.503 --> 01:09:03.901
DID SEND SOME QUESTIONS TO      
STAFF WHEN WHEN THIS GOT ON OUR 
AGENDA.                         

01:09:03.903 --> 01:09:07.405
STAFF WHEN WHEN THIS GOT ON OUR 
AGENDA.                         
SO WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT 300 WHAT IS 

01:09:07.407 --> 01:09:11.341
AGENDA.                         
SO WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT 300 WHAT IS 
IT THREE EIGHT UM THREE HUNDRED 

01:09:11.343 --> 01:09:15.146
SO WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT 300 WHAT IS 
IT THREE EIGHT UM THREE HUNDRED 
AND EIGHT PERCENT SO FAR WITH   

01:09:15.148 --> 01:09:22.286
IT THREE EIGHT UM THREE HUNDRED 
AND EIGHT PERCENT SO FAR WITH   
THIS VARIANCE AND THEN MR. LEO, 

01:09:22.288 --> 01:09:23.054
AND EIGHT PERCENT SO FAR WITH   
THIS VARIANCE AND THEN MR. LEO, 
YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT   

01:09:23.056 --> 01:09:26.057
THIS VARIANCE AND THEN MR. LEO, 
YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT   
THAT THEY WOULDN&apos;T QUALIFY FOR  

01:09:26.059 --> 01:09:26.924
YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT   
THAT THEY WOULDN&apos;T QUALIFY FOR  
THE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE  

01:09:26.926 --> 01:09:30.495
THAT THEY WOULDN&apos;T QUALIFY FOR  
THE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE  
FOOT PEDESTRIAN AMENITY OR DO   

01:09:30.497 --> 01:09:34.765
THE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE  
FOOT PEDESTRIAN AMENITY OR DO   
THEY THEY DO OK SO THAT BRINGS  

01:09:34.767 --> 01:09:37.669
FOOT PEDESTRIAN AMENITY OR DO   
THEY THEY DO OK SO THAT BRINGS  
IT DOWN FROM THREE ELEVEN TO    

01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:38.869
THEY THEY DO OK SO THAT BRINGS  
IT DOWN FROM THREE ELEVEN TO    
THREE EIGHT OR IS IT FROM THREE 

01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:42.506
IT DOWN FROM THREE ELEVEN TO    
THREE EIGHT OR IS IT FROM THREE 
FORTY FIVE TO THREE ELEVEN TO   

01:09:42.508 --> 01:09:46.376
THREE EIGHT OR IS IT FROM THREE 
FORTY FIVE TO THREE ELEVEN TO   
THREE EIGHT THE THREE TWENTY    

01:09:46.378 --> 01:09:50.848
FORTY FIVE TO THREE ELEVEN TO   
THREE EIGHT THE THREE TWENTY    
FIVE IT WOULD BE THE VARIANCE   

01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:54.017
THREE EIGHT THE THREE TWENTY    
FIVE IT WOULD BE THE VARIANCE   
OF TAKING THE PARKING OUT WHICH 

01:09:54.019 --> 01:09:56.888
FIVE IT WOULD BE THE VARIANCE   
OF TAKING THE PARKING OUT WHICH 
WOULD THEN STILL PUT THEM ABOVE 

01:09:56.890 --> 01:10:01.693
OF TAKING THE PARKING OUT WHICH 
WOULD THEN STILL PUT THEM ABOVE 
THE THE THE C WHEN THEY OUR     

01:10:01.695 --> 01:10:02.426
WOULD THEN STILL PUT THEM ABOVE 
THE THE THE C WHEN THEY OUR     
DISTRICT ALLOWS THREE HUNDRED   

01:10:02.428 --> 01:10:05.596
THE THE THE C WHEN THEY OUR     
DISTRICT ALLOWS THREE HUNDRED   
PERCENT FOR THEY WHICH IS THE   

01:10:05.598 --> 01:10:09.299
DISTRICT ALLOWS THREE HUNDRED   
PERCENT FOR THEY WHICH IS THE   
RATIO PERCENTAGE OF THE LOT     

01:10:09.301 --> 01:10:10.001
PERCENT FOR THEY WHICH IS THE   
RATIO PERCENTAGE OF THE LOT     
IT&apos;S THREE HUNDRED PERCENT      

01:10:10.003 --> 01:10:12.203
RATIO PERCENTAGE OF THE LOT     
IT&apos;S THREE HUNDRED PERCENT      
OF THE LOT AREA THAT&apos;S YOUR     

01:10:12.205 --> 01:10:13.137
IT&apos;S THREE HUNDRED PERCENT      
OF THE LOT AREA THAT&apos;S YOUR     
BUILDING SIZE AND THEN THERE IS 

01:10:13.139 --> 01:10:16.440
OF THE LOT AREA THAT&apos;S YOUR     
BUILDING SIZE AND THEN THERE IS 
AND SO THAT&apos;S JUST THREE        

01:10:16.442 --> 01:10:17.274
BUILDING SIZE AND THEN THERE IS 
AND SO THAT&apos;S JUST THREE        
HUNDRED PERCENT AND THAT FLOOR  

01:10:17.276 --> 01:10:20.744
AND SO THAT&apos;S JUST THREE        
HUNDRED PERCENT AND THAT FLOOR  
AREA IS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN 

01:10:20.746 --> 01:10:23.714
HUNDRED PERCENT AND THAT FLOOR  
AREA IS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN 
THOUSAND FOUR AND FORTY FOUR    

01:10:23.716 --> 01:10:27.251
AREA IS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN 
THOUSAND FOUR AND FORTY FOUR    
SQUARE FEET RIGHT THEN YOU CAN  

01:10:27.253 --> 01:10:28.019
THOUSAND FOUR AND FORTY FOUR    
SQUARE FEET RIGHT THEN YOU CAN  
GO EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET   

01:10:28.021 --> 01:10:31.655
SQUARE FEET RIGHT THEN YOU CAN  
GO EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET   
ABOVE THAT SO TWO HUNDRED AND   

01:10:31.657 --> 01:10:32.356
GO EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET   
ABOVE THAT SO TWO HUNDRED AND   
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SO WITH    

01:10:32.358 --> 01:10:35.626
ABOVE THAT SO TWO HUNDRED AND   
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SO WITH    
THE PEDESTRIAN ANY PREMIUM THE  

01:10:35.628 --> 01:10:38.996
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SO WITH    
THE PEDESTRIAN ANY PREMIUM THE  
WAY IT&apos;S WORDED IT SAYS THAT    

01:10:38.998 --> 01:10:39.930
THE PEDESTRIAN ANY PREMIUM THE  
WAY IT&apos;S WORDED IT SAYS THAT    
YOU TAKE YOUR THE THREE HUNDRED 

01:10:39.932 --> 01:10:40.665
WAY IT&apos;S WORDED IT SAYS THAT    
YOU TAKE YOUR THE THREE HUNDRED 
PERCENT BUT THAT NUMBER IS AND  

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:42.533
YOU TAKE YOUR THE THREE HUNDRED 
PERCENT BUT THAT NUMBER IS AND  
THEN YOU CAN ADD EIGHT THOUSAND 

01:10:42.535 --> 01:10:43.401
PERCENT BUT THAT NUMBER IS AND  
THEN YOU CAN ADD EIGHT THOUSAND 
SQUARE FEET SO THERE&apos;S NO SORT  

01:10:43.403 --> 01:10:46.504
THEN YOU CAN ADD EIGHT THOUSAND 
SQUARE FEET SO THERE&apos;S NO SORT  
OF MAX CAP BUT IF YOU DO BUT IF 

01:10:46.506 --> 01:10:47.704
SQUARE FEET SO THERE&apos;S NO SORT  
OF MAX CAP BUT IF YOU DO BUT IF 
YOU DO THEY STILL STAY BE MAXED 

01:10:47.706 --> 01:10:51.175
OF MAX CAP BUT IF YOU DO BUT IF 
YOU DO THEY STILL STAY BE MAXED 
OUT BUT YEAH YEAH BUT IF YOU GO 

01:10:51.177 --> 01:10:54.479
YOU DO THEY STILL STAY BE MAXED 
OUT BUT YEAH YEAH BUT IF YOU GO 
FOR THE THE EXTRA SQUARE        

01:10:54.481 --> 01:10:55.413
OUT BUT YEAH YEAH BUT IF YOU GO 
FOR THE THE EXTRA SQUARE        
FOOTAGE THAT WE ARE IN DEBATE   

01:10:55.415 --> 01:10:57.281
FOR THE THE EXTRA SQUARE        
FOOTAGE THAT WE ARE IN DEBATE   
ABOUT.                          

01:10:57.283 --> 01:10:58.649
FOOTAGE THAT WE ARE IN DEBATE   
ABOUT.                          
&gt;&gt; YEAH AND IF YOU DO THE MATH

ABOUT.                          
&gt;&gt; YEAH AND IF YOU DO THE MATH  
THE THREE HUNDRED PERCENT ARE   

01:11:01.687 --> 01:11:05.155
&gt;&gt; YEAH AND IF YOU DO THE MATH  
THE THREE HUNDRED PERCENT ARE   
PLUS EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET 

01:11:05.157 --> 01:11:05.923
THE THREE HUNDRED PERCENT ARE   
PLUS EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET 
THAT&apos;S THREE HUNDRED AND        

01:11:05.925 --> 01:11:06.323
PLUS EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET 
THAT&apos;S THREE HUNDRED AND        
ELEVEN.                         

01:11:06.325 --> 01:11:09.660

01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:06.177
RESIDENTIAL IN EIGHTY FIVE FEET 
FROM THE GROUND PLANE.          
SO THAT&apos;S THAT EIGHTY FIVE IS A 

01:13:06.179 --> 01:13:06.977
FROM THE GROUND PLANE.          
SO THAT&apos;S THAT EIGHTY FIVE IS A 
CAP FROM THE GROUND AND NOT     

01:13:06.979 --> 01:13:10.781
SO THAT&apos;S THAT EIGHTY FIVE IS A 
CAP FROM THE GROUND AND NOT     
FROM THE CONCRETE PODIUM LEVEL. 

01:13:10.783 --> 01:13:11.849
CAP FROM THE GROUND AND NOT     
FROM THE CONCRETE PODIUM LEVEL. 
WE CAN&apos;T GET ANY MORE HEIGHT    

01:13:11.851 --> 01:13:14.151
FROM THE CONCRETE PODIUM LEVEL. 
WE CAN&apos;T GET ANY MORE HEIGHT    
OUT OF THAT BY STRICTLY STAYING 

01:13:14.153 --> 01:13:15.085
WE CAN&apos;T GET ANY MORE HEIGHT    
OUT OF THAT BY STRICTLY STAYING 
TO THAT BUILDING TYPE AND NOT   

01:13:15.087 --> 01:13:18.121

OF THAT THIS IS A BUILDING      

01:13:21.493 --> 01:13:22.459
ADDING INVARIANTS ON TOP        
OF THAT THIS IS A BUILDING      
MATERIAL THAT THE WALL GULAM    

01:13:22.461 --> 01:13:26.263
OF THAT THIS IS A BUILDING      
MATERIAL THAT THE WALL GULAM    
BEAMS COLUMNS HAVE BEEN USED    

01:13:26.265 --> 01:13:26.930
MATERIAL THAT THE WALL GULAM    
BEAMS COLUMNS HAVE BEEN USED    
FOR FOR A WHILE ENGINEERED      

01:13:26.932 --> 01:13:29.533
BEAMS COLUMNS HAVE BEEN USED    
FOR FOR A WHILE ENGINEERED      
LUMBER LIKE THAT ACROSS         

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:30.334
FOR FOR A WHILE ENGINEERED      
LUMBER LIKE THAT ACROSS         
LAMINATED TIMBER IS USED FOR    

01:13:30.336 --> 01:13:31.068
LUMBER LIKE THAT ACROSS         
LAMINATED TIMBER IS USED FOR    
THE FLOOR DECKING WHICH IS A    

01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:34.004
LAMINATED TIMBER IS USED FOR    
THE FLOOR DECKING WHICH IS A    
FAIRLY NEW INVENTION FROM THE   

01:13:34.006 --> 01:13:34.772
THE FLOOR DECKING WHICH IS A    
FAIRLY NEW INVENTION FROM THE   
FROM THE NINETIES THAT IS USED  

01:13:34.774 --> 01:13:38.175
FAIRLY NEW INVENTION FROM THE   
FROM THE NINETIES THAT IS USED  
FOR ENTIRE FLOOR DECKING WITH A 

01:13:38.177 --> 01:13:38.909
FROM THE NINETIES THAT IS USED  
FOR ENTIRE FLOOR DECKING WITH A 
CONCRETE TOPPER ON TOP OF THAT. 

01:13:38.911 --> 01:13:41.478
FOR ENTIRE FLOOR DECKING WITH A 
CONCRETE TOPPER ON TOP OF THAT. 
SO THERE&apos;S A LOT OF MASS IN     

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.312
CONCRETE TOPPER ON TOP OF THAT. 
SO THERE&apos;S A LOT OF MASS IN     
THAT FLOOR DECKING AND IT ALSO  

01:13:42.314 --> 01:13:45.082
SO THERE&apos;S A LOT OF MASS IN     
THAT FLOOR DECKING AND IT ALSO  
OFFERS FIRE RESISTANCE RATING   

01:13:45.084 --> 01:13:45.616
THAT FLOOR DECKING AND IT ALSO  
OFFERS FIRE RESISTANCE RATING   
FOR THE FLOOR.                  

01:13:45.618 --> 01:13:48.819
OFFERS FIRE RESISTANCE RATING   
FOR THE FLOOR.                  
THAT&apos;S ANOTHER BIG CHANGE       

01:13:48.821 --> 01:13:49.820
FOR THE FLOOR.                  
THAT&apos;S ANOTHER BIG CHANGE       
OF HOW WE CAN BUILD TALL WITH   

01:13:49.822 --> 01:13:53.056
THAT&apos;S ANOTHER BIG CHANGE       
OF HOW WE CAN BUILD TALL WITH   
WITH MASS TIMBER IS THAT IT     

01:13:53.058 --> 01:13:53.724
OF HOW WE CAN BUILD TALL WITH   
WITH MASS TIMBER IS THAT IT     
OFFERS REALLY GOOD FIRE         

01:13:53.726 --> 01:13:56.460
WITH MASS TIMBER IS THAT IT     
OFFERS REALLY GOOD FIRE         
RESISTANCE.                     

01:13:56.462 --> 01:13:57.395
OFFERS REALLY GOOD FIRE         
RESISTANCE.                     
THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S REQUIRED FOR      

01:13:57.397 --> 01:13:59.663
RESISTANCE.                     
THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S REQUIRED FOR      
RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS.          

01:13:59.665 --> 01:14:01.031
THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S REQUIRED FOR      
RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS.          
SO FROM THAT WE HAVE FOR FOR    

01:14:01.033 --> 01:14:03.834
RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS.          
SO FROM THAT WE HAVE FOR FOR    
ITS CARBON .                    

01:14:03.836 --> 01:14:04.902
SO FROM THAT WE HAVE FOR FOR    
ITS CARBON .                    
SO A TREE GROWING IS GOING TO   

01:14:04.904 --> 01:14:07.505
ITS CARBON .                    
SO A TREE GROWING IS GOING TO   
CAPTURE A LOT OF CARBON OVER    

01:14:07.507 --> 01:14:08.439
SO A TREE GROWING IS GOING TO   
CAPTURE A LOT OF CARBON OVER    
ITS LIFESPAN AND THIS IS GOING  

01:14:08.441 --> 01:14:11.675
CAPTURE A LOT OF CARBON OVER    
ITS LIFESPAN AND THIS IS GOING  
TO USE A LOT OF LUMBER.         

01:14:11.677 --> 01:14:12.709
ITS LIFESPAN AND THIS IS GOING  
TO USE A LOT OF LUMBER.         
&gt;&gt; THE LUMBER BEING FORESTED IN 

01:14:12.711 --> 01:14:15.378
TO USE A LOT OF LUMBER.         
&gt;&gt; THE LUMBER BEING FORESTED IN 
FORESTS IS AS WE&apos;VE LEARNED FOR 

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.080
&gt;&gt; THE LUMBER BEING FORESTED IN 
FORESTS IS AS WE&apos;VE LEARNED FOR 
THE PAST WE&apos;VE BEEN GOING TO    

01:14:16.082 --> 01:14:18.849
FORESTS IS AS WE&apos;VE LEARNED FOR 
THE PAST WE&apos;VE BEEN GOING TO    
THE MASTER PRECONFERENCE FROM   

01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:19.216
THE PAST WE&apos;VE BEEN GOING TO

01:14:23.489 --> 01:14:24.054
CONFERENCE IN PORTLAND THIS     
YEAR ABOUT THIS PROJECT.        
WE&apos;VE LEARNED THAT              

01:14:24.056 --> 01:14:27.457
YEAR ABOUT THIS PROJECT.        
WE&apos;VE LEARNED THAT              
DEFORESTATION IS NOT REALLY IS  

01:14:27.459 --> 01:14:30.927
WE&apos;VE LEARNED THAT              
DEFORESTATION IS NOT REALLY IS  
NOT A IS NOT PRODUCING LUMBER   

01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:31.662
DEFORESTATION IS NOT REALLY IS  
NOT A IS NOT PRODUCING LUMBER   
IN IN THE UNITED STATES.        

01:14:31.664 --> 01:14:32.463
NOT A IS NOT PRODUCING LUMBER   
IN IN THE UNITED STATES.        
IT&apos;S NOT A FOREST STEWARDSHIP   

01:14:32.465 --> 01:14:36.100
IN IN THE UNITED STATES.        
IT&apos;S NOT A FOREST STEWARDSHIP   
MANAGE WAY OF PRODUCING LUMBER  

01:14:36.102 --> 01:14:38.969
IT&apos;S NOT A FOREST STEWARDSHIP   
MANAGE WAY OF PRODUCING LUMBER  
THAT FORESTS NEED GOOD LAND     

01:14:38.971 --> 01:14:39.836
MANAGE WAY OF PRODUCING LUMBER  
THAT FORESTS NEED GOOD LAND     
MANAGEMENT TO KEEP BIOMASS FROM 

01:14:39.838 --> 01:14:44.275
THAT FORESTS NEED GOOD LAND     
MANAGEMENT TO KEEP BIOMASS FROM 
FALLING DOWN AND THEN DRYING    

01:14:44.277 --> 01:14:44.875
MANAGEMENT TO KEEP BIOMASS FROM 
FALLING DOWN AND THEN DRYING    
OUT AND THEN BURNING CAUSING    

01:14:44.877 --> 01:14:47.878
FALLING DOWN AND THEN DRYING    
OUT AND THEN BURNING CAUSING    
THESE MASSIVE WILDFIRES FIRES   

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:48.745
OUT AND THEN BURNING CAUSING    
THESE MASSIVE WILDFIRES FIRES   
OUT IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.   

01:14:48.747 --> 01:14:51.415
THESE MASSIVE WILDFIRES FIRES   
OUT IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.   
SO WHEN A TREE FALLS AND BURNS  

01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:52.215
OUT IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.   
SO WHEN A TREE FALLS AND BURNS  
IT RELEASES ALL THAT CARBON .   

01:14:52.217 --> 01:14:54.651
SO WHEN A TREE FALLS AND BURNS  
IT RELEASES ALL THAT CARBON .   
SO WE&apos;RE TAKING IT CUTTING      

01:14:54.653 --> 01:14:55.652
IT RELEASES ALL THAT CARBON .   
SO WE&apos;RE TAKING IT CUTTING      
TREES DOWN IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY 

01:14:55.654 --> 01:14:56.453
SO WE&apos;RE TAKING IT CUTTING      
TREES DOWN IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY 
THAT IS THEN GOING TO BE        

01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:59.189
TREES DOWN IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY 
THAT IS THEN GOING TO BE        
REPLANTED PUTTING INTO A        

01:14:59.191 --> 01:15:02.993
THAT IS THEN GOING TO BE        
REPLANTED PUTTING INTO A        
BUILDING THAT IS SEQUESTERING A 

01:15:02.995 --> 01:15:03.693
REPLANTED PUTTING INTO A

LOT OF THAT CARBON IN THE       
BUILDING.                       
SO THIS DIAGRAM AND CHART YOU   

01:15:06.765 --> 01:15:10.634
BUILDING.                       
SO THIS DIAGRAM AND CHART YOU   
SEE HERE, THIS IS HOW MUCH      

01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:11.368
SO THIS DIAGRAM AND CHART YOU   
SEE HERE, THIS IS HOW MUCH      
CARBON IT WOULD TAKE TO TO      

01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:14.104
SEE HERE, THIS IS HOW MUCH      
CARBON IT WOULD TAKE TO TO      
PRODUCE THIS BUILDING VERSUS A  

01:15:14.106 --> 01:15:14.671

01:15:21.914 --> 01:15:23.013
CONSTRUCTION AND VERSUS TYPICAL 
STEEL STEEL CONSTRUCTION.       
SO ALREADY WE&apos;RE ABOUT HALF     

01:15:23.015 --> 01:15:26.316
STEEL STEEL CONSTRUCTION.       
SO ALREADY WE&apos;RE ABOUT HALF     
OF THE CARBON THAT IT TAKES TO  

01:15:26.318 --> 01:15:26.784
SO ALREADY WE&apos;RE ABOUT HALF     
OF THE CARBON THAT IT TAKES TO  
BUILD A BUILDING.               

01:15:26.786 --> 01:15:27.784
OF THE CARBON THAT IT TAKES TO  
BUILD A BUILDING.               
THIS IS I MEAN THESE ARE THE    

01:15:27.786 --> 01:15:29.586
BUILD A BUILDING.               
THIS IS I MEAN THESE ARE THE    
REAL NUMBERS WHAT IT TAKES TO   

01:15:29.588 --> 01:15:30.321
THIS IS I MEAN THESE ARE THE    
REAL NUMBERS WHAT IT TAKES TO   
BUILD A BUILDING THAT TAKES A   

01:15:30.323 --> 01:15:30.854
REAL NUMBERS WHAT IT TAKES TO   
BUILD A BUILDING THAT TAKES A   
LOT OF ENERGY.                  

01:15:30.856 --> 01:15:33.424
BUILD A BUILDING THAT TAKES A   
LOT OF ENERGY.                  
IT&apos;S ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE   

01:15:33.426 --> 01:15:34.225

IT&apos;S ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE   
THOUSAND MATURE TREES OF CARBON 

01:15:34.227 --> 01:15:37.261
IT&apos;S ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE   
THOUSAND MATURE TREES OF CARBON 
AND ONE YEAR AND FOUR THOUSAND

BUT WHAT USING WOOD IT&apos;S        

01:15:41.734 --> 01:15:44.802
OR FOUR THOUSAND FLIGHTS.       
BUT WHAT USING WOOD IT&apos;S        
SEQUESTERING ABOUT 80 PERCENT   

01:15:44.804 --> 01:15:45.536
BUT WHAT USING WOOD IT&apos;S        
SEQUESTERING ABOUT 80 PERCENT   
OF THAT CARBON THAT OTHERWISE   

01:15:45.538 --> 01:15:49.073
SEQUESTERING ABOUT 80 PERCENT   
OF THAT CARBON THAT OTHERWISE   
IS BEING PRODUCED INTO THE      

01:15:49.075 --> 01:15:49.807
OF THAT CARBON THAT OTHERWISE   
IS BEING PRODUCED INTO THE      
ATMOSPHERE AND KEEPING IT       

01:15:49.809 --> 01:15:50.474
IS BEING PRODUCED INTO THE      
ATMOSPHERE AND KEEPING IT       
INSIDE THE BUILDING AND THE NEW 

01:15:50.476 --> 01:15:52.677
ATMOSPHERE AND KEEPING IT       
INSIDE THE BUILDING AND THE NEW 
TREES PLANTED AND SEQUESTER     

01:15:52.679 --> 01:15:55.713
INSIDE THE BUILDING AND THE NEW 
TREES PLANTED AND SEQUESTER     
MORE CARBON AND THE CYCLE       

01:15:55.715 --> 01:15:56.113
TREES PLANTED AND SEQUESTER     
MORE CARBON AND THE CYCLE       
CONTINUES.

MORE CARBON AND THE CYCLE       
CONTINUES.                      
SO THAT&apos;S THE THAT&apos;S THE REALLY 

01:15:57.183 --> 01:16:03.354
CONTINUES.                      
SO THAT&apos;S THE THAT&apos;S THE REALLY 
GREAT SUSTAINABLE               

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:19.336
                  PRODUCT       
OF MASS TIMBER AND THEN IT HAS  
TO BE ON A CONCRETE PODIUM      

01:16:19.338 --> 01:16:20.137
OF MASS TIMBER AND THEN IT HAS  
TO BE ON A CONCRETE PODIUM      
BECAUSE OF THE USE UNDERNEATH   

01:16:20.139 --> 01:16:20.538
TO BE ON A CONCRETE PODIUM      
BECAUSE OF THE USE UNDERNEATH   
TO SEPARATE.                    

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.205
BECAUSE OF THE USE UNDERNEATH   
TO SEPARATE.                    
YEAH, WE HAVE WE HAVE CARS      

01:16:21.207 --> 01:16:21.939
TO SEPARATE.                    
YEAH, WE HAVE WE HAVE CARS      
PARKING UNDERNEATH AND WE HAVE  

01:16:21.941 --> 01:16:22.606
YEAH, WE HAVE WE HAVE CARS      
PARKING UNDERNEATH AND WE HAVE  
OTHER COMMERCIAL USES.          

01:16:22.608 --> 01:16:23.307
PARKING UNDERNEATH AND WE HAVE  
OTHER COMMERCIAL USES.          
WE HAVE ELECTRICAL ROOMS.       

01:16:23.309 --> 01:16:24.040
OTHER COMMERCIAL USES.          
WE HAVE ELECTRICAL ROOMS.       
WE HAVE GENERATOR ROOMS THAT WE 

01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:24.708
WE HAVE ELECTRICAL ROOMS.       
WE HAVE GENERATOR ROOMS THAT WE 
NEED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FIRE    

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:25.375
WE HAVE GENERATOR ROOMS THAT WE 
NEED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FIRE    
RESISTANCE BETWEEN THAT AND     

01:16:25.377 --> 01:16:26.110
NEED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FIRE    
RESISTANCE BETWEEN THAT AND     
OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.    

01:16:26.112 --> 01:16:26.711
RESISTANCE BETWEEN THAT AND     
OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.    
SO THAT&apos;S WHY THE PODIUM IS     

01:16:26.713 --> 01:16:27.578
OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.    
SO THAT&apos;S WHY THE PODIUM IS     
REQUIRED BY BUILDING CODE TO BE 

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:27.911
SO THAT&apos;S WHY THE PODIUM IS     
REQUIRED BY BUILDING CODE TO BE 
CONCRETE.                       

01:16:27.913 --> 01:16:28.579
REQUIRED BY BUILDING CODE TO BE 
CONCRETE.                       
&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE DOING AS MUCH AS WE

ANSWER.                         
&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS QUESTION NOW IS 
FOR STAFF LEO, IF YOU COULD     

01:16:38.491 --> 01:16:44.795
&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS QUESTION NOW IS 
FOR STAFF LEO, IF YOU COULD     
JUST WALK ME THROUGH AGAIN THE  

01:16:44.797 --> 01:16:45.929
FOR STAFF LEO, IF YOU COULD     
JUST WALK ME THROUGH AGAIN THE  
THE SETBACKS THE TEN FOOT AND   

01:16:45.931 --> 01:16:49.399
JUST WALK ME THROUGH AGAIN THE  
THE SETBACKS THE TEN FOOT AND   
NINETEEN AND THE FIVE.          

01:16:49.401 --> 01:16:50.567
THE SETBACKS THE TEN FOOT AND   
NINETEEN AND THE FIVE.          
SO I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS  

01:16:50.569 --> 01:16:53.570
NINETEEN AND THE FIVE.          
SO I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS  
BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCEEDING THE  

01:16:53.572 --> 01:16:54.438
SO I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS  
BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCEEDING THE  
SETBACKS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE  

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.640
BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCEEDING THE  
SETBACKS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE  
DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE DEVELOPING 

01:16:56.642 --> 01:17:00.711
SETBACKS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE  
DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE DEVELOPING 
TO THE 50 PERCENT MINIMUM       

01:17:00.713 --> 01:17:04.614
DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE DEVELOPING 
TO THE 50 PERCENT MINIMUM       
OF THAT ZONING AREA WHICH WOULD 

01:17:04.616 --> 01:17:05.416
TO THE 50 PERCENT MINIMUM       
OF THAT ZONING AREA WHICH WOULD 
BE TEN SO FIFTY PERCENT OF IT   

01:17:05.418 --> 01:17:05.949
OF THAT ZONING AREA WHICH WOULD 
BE TEN SO FIFTY PERCENT OF IT   
WOULD BE FIVE.                  

01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:08.752
BE TEN SO FIFTY PERCENT OF IT   
WOULD BE FIVE.                  
SO THEY WOULD FIT THAT BUT WE   

01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:12.556
WOULD BE FIVE.                  
SO THEY WOULD FIT THAT BUT WE   
ARE REJECTING WHAT IS IN THE    

01:17:12.558 --> 01:17:13.256
SO THEY WOULD FIT THAT BUT WE   
ARE REJECTING WHAT IS IN THE    
ZONING ORDINANCE AND REQUEST    

01:17:13.258 --> 01:17:19.028
ARE REJECTING WHAT IS IN THE    
ZONING ORDINANCE AND REQUEST

BECOME SHORT TERM RENTAL LAND   

01:35:32.523 --> 01:35:35.391

BECAUSE THAT IS COMPLETELY      

01:35:35.393 --> 01:35:39.395

BECAUSE THAT IS COMPLETELY      
ANTITHETICAL TO OUR HOUSING

CAN COUNT ON THESE THE HOUSING  

01:36:21.572 --> 01:36:22.271
THAT BECOMES INSTEAD OF LIKE WE 
CAN COUNT ON THESE THE HOUSING  
THAT&apos;S THERE THAT IT THEN       

01:36:22.273 --> 01:36:25.341
CAN COUNT ON THESE THE HOUSING  
THAT&apos;S THERE THAT IT THEN       
BECOMES OPEN TO THE WORLD.      

01:36:25.343 --> 01:36:26.575
THAT&apos;S THERE THAT IT THEN

ABOUT THE 85 FOOT LIMITATION    
WITHIN THE BUILDING CODE AND SO 

01:51:55.372 --> 01:51:56.404
ABOUT THE 85 FOOT LIMITATION    
WITHIN THE BUILDING CODE AND SO 
MY QUESTION IS WHY A CONDITION  

01:51:56.406 --> 01:51:59.874
WITHIN THE BUILDING CODE AND SO 
MY QUESTION IS WHY A CONDITION  
OF 100 HUNDRED FEET THAT WAS    

01:51:59.876 --> 01:52:00.308
MY QUESTION IS WHY A CONDITION  
OF 100 HUNDRED FEET THAT WAS    
OFFERED UP?                     

01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:04.012

OFFERED UP?                     
&gt;&gt; YEAH, SO THAT CONDITION IS   
MOSTLY FOR PARAPETS ELEVATOR    

01:52:07.417 --> 01:52:08.216
&gt;&gt; YEAH, SO THAT CONDITION IS   
MOSTLY FOR PARAPETS ELEVATOR    
ROOMS ABOVE ARE STAIRWELLS THAT 

01:52:08.218 --> 01:52:11.953
MOSTLY FOR PARAPETS ELEVATOR    
ROOMS ABOVE ARE STAIRWELLS THAT 
NEED TO ACCESS THE ROOF AREA    

01:52:11.955 --> 01:52:12.788
ROOMS ABOVE ARE STAIRWELLS THAT 
NEED TO ACCESS THE ROOF AREA    
FOR THE FIRE CODE AND GETTING   

01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:16.190
NEED TO ACCESS THE ROOF AREA    
FOR THE FIRE CODE AND GETTING   
TO THE SOLAR PANELS AND THINGS  

01:52:16.192 --> 01:52:16.524
FOR THE FIRE CODE AND GETTING   
TO THE SOLAR PANELS AND THINGS  
LIKE THAT.                      

01:52:16.526 --> 01:52:17.325
TO THE SOLAR PANELS AND THINGS  
LIKE THAT.                      
THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT IT&apos;S FOR.

LIKE THAT.                      
THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT IT&apos;S FOR.    
IT&apos;S GIVING US A LITTLE LEEWAY  

01:52:18.729 --> 01:52:22.597
THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S WHAT IT&apos;S FOR.    
IT&apos;S GIVING US A LITTLE LEEWAY  
ROOM FOR FOR THAT OK AND AGAIN  

01:52:22.599 --> 01:52:26.368
IT&apos;S GIVING US A LITTLE LEEWAY  
ROOM FOR FOR THAT OK AND AGAIN  
SO I IMAGINE WHAT SOME PEOPLE&apos;S 

01:52:26.370 --> 01:52:27.035
ROOM FOR FOR THAT OK AND AGAIN  
SO I IMAGINE WHAT SOME PEOPLE&apos;S 
WORST SCENARIO IS RIGHT.        

01:52:27.037 --> 01:52:28.236
SO I IMAGINE WHAT SOME PEOPLE&apos;S 
WORST SCENARIO IS RIGHT.        
&gt;&gt; LIKE MIGHT BE AND HOW WHAT   

01:52:28.238 --> 01:52:31.172
WORST SCENARIO IS RIGHT.        
&gt;&gt; LIKE MIGHT BE AND HOW WHAT   
WE&apos;RE SEEING ON A FLIGHT PLAN   

01:52:31.174 --> 01:52:33.375
&gt;&gt; LIKE MIGHT BE AND HOW WHAT   
WE&apos;RE SEEING ON A FLIGHT PLAN   
DEVIATES FROM WHAT COULD WHAT   

01:52:33.377 --> 01:52:34.509
WE&apos;RE SEEING ON A FLIGHT PLAN   
DEVIATES FROM WHAT COULD WHAT   
WOULD RUN WITH ONLY IN FOREVER  

01:52:34.511 --> 01:52:39.247
DEVIATES FROM WHAT COULD WHAT   
WOULD RUN WITH ONLY IN FOREVER  
SO THE 15 FEET IS NOT HUGE.     

01:52:39.249 --> 01:52:42.217
WOULD RUN WITH ONLY IN FOREVER  
SO THE 15 FEET IS NOT HUGE.     
&gt;&gt; THE IMPACTFUL BUT I WOULD    

01:52:42.219 --> 01:52:42.818
SO THE 15 FEET IS NOT HUGE.     
&gt;&gt; THE IMPACTFUL BUT I WOULD    
JUST SUGGEST THAT YOUR SHADE    

01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:45.954
&gt;&gt; THE IMPACTFUL BUT I WOULD    
JUST SUGGEST THAT YOUR SHADE    
STUDIES ARE NOT ARE GOING NOT   

01:52:45.956 --> 01:52:46.721
JUST SUGGEST THAT YOUR SHADE    
STUDIES ARE NOT ARE GOING NOT   
FOR ONE HUNDRED FOOT TALL       

01:52:46.723 --> 01:52:50.291
STUDIES ARE NOT ARE GOING NOT   
FOR ONE HUNDRED FOOT TALL       
STRUCTURE, AN EIGHTY FIVE FOOT  

01:52:50.293 --> 01:52:50.692
FOR ONE HUNDRED FOOT TALL       
STRUCTURE, AN EIGHTY FIVE FOOT  
TALL STRUCTURE.                 

01:52:50.694 --> 01:52:51.626
STRUCTURE, AN EIGHTY FIVE FOOT  
TALL STRUCTURE.                 
SO THAT&apos;S SOMETHING THAT&apos;S IN   

01:52:51.628 --> 01:52:54.129
TALL STRUCTURE.                 
SO THAT&apos;S SOMETHING THAT&apos;S IN   
MY MIND THAT I WANT TO MAKE     

01:52:54.131 --> 01:52:57.765
SO THAT&apos;S SOMETHING THAT&apos;S IN   
MY MIND THAT I WANT TO MAKE

SPACE THAT&apos;S OFFERED AS A       
CONDITION WHAT IS SHOWN ON THE  
SITE PLAN THAT WE&apos;RE SEEING IS  

01:53:02.105 --> 01:53:05.173
CONDITION WHAT IS SHOWN ON THE  
SITE PLAN THAT WE&apos;RE SEEING IS  
ABOUT TWICE WHAT IS IN THE      

01:53:05.175 --> 01:53:05.907
SITE PLAN THAT WE&apos;RE SEEING IS  
ABOUT TWICE WHAT IS IN THE      
CONDITION WE&apos;RE SEEING ABOUT    

01:53:05.909 --> 01:53:08.643
ABOUT TWICE WHAT IS IN THE      
CONDITION WE&apos;RE SEEING ABOUT    
EIGHT NINE SQUARE FEET NINETY   

01:53:08.645 --> 01:53:09.577
CONDITION WE&apos;RE SEEING ABOUT    
EIGHT NINE SQUARE FEET NINETY   
ONE I THINK SQUARE FEET PER     

01:53:09.579 --> 01:53:10.245
EIGHT NINE SQUARE FEET NINETY   
ONE I THINK SQUARE FEET PER     
UNIT AND WHAT&apos;S IN THE          

01:53:10.247 --> 01:53:12.747
ONE I THINK SQUARE FEET PER     
UNIT AND WHAT&apos;S IN THE          
CONDITION 50.

IS ALSO KIND OF WHAT THE        
RATIONALE IS THERE.             
I THINK IT&apos;S A MATTER OF THE    

01:53:21.024 --> 01:53:21.422
RATIONALE IS THERE.             
I THINK IT&apos;S A MATTER OF THE    
DESIGN.                         

01:53:21.424 --> 01:53:23.792
I THINK IT&apos;S A MATTER OF THE    
DESIGN.                         
WE KEPT ADDING MORE OUTDOOR     

01:53:23.794 --> 01:53:24.526
DESIGN.                         
WE KEPT ADDING MORE OUTDOOR     
SPACE SO INSTEAD OF BOTTOM      

01:53:24.528 --> 01:53:27.428
WE KEPT ADDING MORE OUTDOOR     
SPACE SO INSTEAD OF BOTTOM      
LIMIT THAT WE DIDN&apos;T WANT TO GO 

01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:28.396
SPACE SO INSTEAD OF BOTTOM      
LIMIT THAT WE DIDN&apos;T WANT TO GO 
BELOW BUT WE&apos;RE ALWAYS JUST     

01:53:28.398 --> 01:53:31.767
LIMIT THAT WE DIDN&apos;T WANT TO GO 
BELOW BUT WE&apos;RE ALWAYS JUST     
TRYING TO GO BEYOND THAT.       

01:53:31.769 --> 01:53:32.901
BELOW BUT WE&apos;RE ALWAYS JUST     
TRYING TO GO BEYOND THAT.       
WE ALMOST GOT TO DOUBLE UP      

01:53:32.903 --> 01:53:36.171
TRYING TO GO BEYOND THAT.       
WE ALMOST GOT TO DOUBLE UP      
WHICH IS GREAT WHICH IS ALSO IN 

01:53:36.173 --> 01:53:36.971
WE ALMOST GOT TO DOUBLE UP      
WHICH IS GREAT WHICH IS ALSO IN 
THE FLIGHT PLAN DOESN&apos;T WORK    

01:53:36.973 --> 01:53:38.773
WHICH IS GREAT WHICH IS ALSO IN 
THE FLIGHT PLAN DOESN&apos;T WORK    
RIGHT.                          

01:53:38.775 --> 01:53:39.708
THE FLIGHT PLAN DOESN&apos;T WORK    
RIGHT.                          
&gt;&gt; WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON FOR  

01:53:39.710 --> 01:53:40.608
RIGHT.                          
&gt;&gt; WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON FOR  
ME THAT IT&apos;S DIFFICULT FOR ME   

01:53:40.610 --> 01:53:44.145
&gt;&gt; WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON FOR  
ME THAT IT&apos;S DIFFICULT FOR ME   
TO APPROVE THE FLIGHT PLAN      

01:53:44.147 --> 01:53:44.813
ME THAT IT&apos;S DIFFICULT FOR ME   
TO APPROVE THE FLIGHT PLAN      
KNOWING THAT IT&apos;S HINGING ON    

01:53:44.815 --> 01:53:46.982
TO APPROVE THE FLIGHT PLAN      
KNOWING THAT IT&apos;S HINGING ON    
SOME OTHER BODY BEYOND US.      

01:53:46.984 --> 01:53:48.182
KNOWING THAT IT&apos;S HINGING ON    
SOME OTHER BODY BEYOND US.      
&gt;&gt; JUST TO BE REAL CLEAR        

01:53:48.184 --> 01:53:51.386
SOME OTHER BODY BEYOND US.      
&gt;&gt; JUST TO BE REAL CLEAR        
BECAUSE IF IF THAT FLIGHT PLAN  

01:53:51.388 --> 01:53:55.223
&gt;&gt; JUST TO BE REAL CLEAR        
BECAUSE IF IF THAT FLIGHT PLAN  
DOESN&apos;T WORK THEN AND WE DO THE 

01:53:55.225 --> 01:53:55.957
BECAUSE IF IF THAT FLIGHT PLAN  
DOESN&apos;T WORK THEN AND WE DO THE 
REASONING AT THE SAME TIME      

01:53:55.959 --> 01:53:56.758
DOESN&apos;T WORK THEN AND WE DO THE 
REASONING AT THE SAME TIME      
AGAIN THAT&apos;S LOCKED IN FOREVER. 

01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:59.494
REASONING AT THE SAME TIME      
AGAIN THAT&apos;S LOCKED IN FOREVER. 
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE   

01:53:59.496 --> 01:54:00.228
AGAIN THAT&apos;S LOCKED IN FOREVER. 
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE   
OF THINGS THAT WE&apos;RE IN IT.     

01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:03.365
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE   
OF THINGS THAT WE&apos;RE IN IT.     
I I DIDN&apos;T GO THROUGH THE

OF THINGS THAT WE&apos;RE IN IT.     
I I DIDN&apos;T GO THROUGH THE       
PARKING CALCULATION BECAUSE     

01:54:04.034 --> 01:54:07.035
I I DIDN&apos;T GO THROUGH THE       
PARKING CALCULATION BECAUSE     
EFFECTIVELY WE DON&apos;T REQUIRE    

01:54:07.037 --> 01:54:09.904
PARKING CALCULATION BECAUSE     
EFFECTIVELY WE DON&apos;T REQUIRE    
ANY PARKING PARKING MAXIMUMS.   

01:54:09.906 --> 01:54:10.371
EFFECTIVELY WE DON&apos;T REQUIRE    
ANY PARKING PARKING MAXIMUMS.   
AWESOME.                        

01:54:10.373 --> 01:54:13.675
ANY PARKING PARKING MAXIMUMS.   
AWESOME.                        
BUT I DON&apos;T SO I DIDN&apos;T SEE HOW 

01:54:13.677 --> 01:54:14.676

02:32:01.242 --> 02:32:04.176
PROGRAM THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN  
IS ASKING FOR INCREASED         
RESIDENTIAL AND IT&apos;S A MIXED    

02:32:04.178 --> 02:32:04.777
IS ASKING FOR INCREASED         
RESIDENTIAL AND IT&apos;S A MIXED    
USE SITE KIND OF WHAT

SO WE DIDN&apos;T DO ONE FOR SEVERAL 
REASONS THE THE BUILDING        

02:32:12.087 --> 02:32:12.952
SO WE DIDN&apos;T DO ONE FOR SEVERAL 
REASONS THE THE BUILDING        
MARSING WOULD HAVE BEEN TALLER. 

02:32:12.954 --> 02:32:16.288
REASONS THE THE BUILDING        
MARSING WOULD HAVE BEEN TALLER. 
IT WOULD HAVE CASTS A LARGER    

02:32:16.290 --> 02:32:16.989
MARSING WOULD HAVE BEEN TALLER. 
IT WOULD HAVE CASTS A LARGER    
SHADOW ON OUR NEIGHBORS AND WE  

02:32:16.991 --> 02:32:19.425
IT WOULD HAVE CASTS A LARGER

THOUGHT IT WASN&apos;T RIGHT FOR     
THIS AREA AND WE ALSO DIDN&apos;T    

02:32:20.528 --> 02:32:21.393
THOUGHT IT WASN&apos;T RIGHT FOR     
THIS AREA AND WE ALSO DIDN&apos;T

THAT WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT        
HOUSING AS WE&apos;RE GOING ON HERE  
AND THAT BY DOING THIS WE ARE   

02:33:13.381 --> 02:33:16.081
HOUSING AS WE&apos;RE GOING ON HERE  
AND THAT BY DOING THIS WE ARE   
ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT POSSIBLE  

02:33:16.083 --> 02:33:16.916
AND THAT BY DOING THIS WE ARE   
ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT POSSIBLE  
FOR THEM TO HAVE NO LONG TERM   

02:33:16.918 --> 02:33:18.984
ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT POSSIBLE

PROCESS.                        
&gt;&gt; I THINK CHOOSING ELEVEN      

03:26:58.669 --> 03:27:01.838
PROCESS.                        
&gt;&gt; I THINK CHOOSING ELEVEN      
PARCELS ALONG THE NEW ROAD      

03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:05.308
&gt;&gt; I THINK CHOOSING ELEVEN      
PARCELS ALONG THE NEW ROAD      
CORRIDOR WHICH HAS LONG HAD A   

03:27:05.310 --> 03:27:06.175
PARCELS ALONG THE NEW ROAD      
CORRIDOR WHICH HAS LONG HAD A   
HISTORY OF ERWINAZE ZONING AND  

03:27:06.177 --> 03:27:09.845
CORRIDOR WHICH HAS LONG HAD A   
HISTORY OF ERWINAZE ZONING AND  
REZONING THEM TO MULTIFAMILY    

03:27:09.847 --> 03:27:14.016
HISTORY OF ERWINAZE ZONING AND  
REZONING THEM TO MULTIFAMILY    
WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE  

03:27:14.018 --> 03:27:17.353
REZONING THEM TO MULTIFAMILY    
WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE  
CURRENT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND  

03:27:17.355 --> 03:27:21.323
WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE  
CURRENT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND  
SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS      

03:27:21.325 --> 03:27:22.258
CURRENT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND  
SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS      
LIKELY GOING TO BE DISCUSSIONS  

03:27:22.260 --> 03:27:24.861
SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS      
LIKELY GOING TO BE DISCUSSIONS  
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE    

03:27:24.863 --> 03:27:25.528
LIKELY GOING TO BE DISCUSSIONS  
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE    
UPCOMING COMPREHENSIVE PLAN     

03:27:25.530 --> 03:27:30.099
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE    
UPCOMING COMPREHENSIVE PLAN     
REVIEW THAT WILL INCLUDE WHAT   

03:27:30.101 --> 03:27:33.368
UPCOMING COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

IF I WOULD FIND A SECOND AND    
THEN A DISCUSSION ABOUT A       

03:28:02.834 --> 03:28:03.232
IF I WOULD FIND A SECOND AND    
THEN A DISCUSSION ABOUT A       
BETTER.

QUESTION IF IF YOU COULD MAKE   
ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION, WHAT    

03:28:10.541 --> 03:28:14.076
QUESTION IF IF YOU COULD MAKE   
ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION, WHAT    
RECOMMENDATION WOULD YOU MAKE   

03:28:14.078 --> 03:28:14.743
ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION, WHAT

ELEMENTS OF SINGLE FAMILY       
ZONING DISTRICTS AND THAT THAT  

03:28:28.793 --> 03:28:29.559
ELEMENTS OF SINGLE FAMILY       
ZONING DISTRICTS AND THAT THAT  
WOULD RESULT IN A MORE          

03:28:29.561 --> 03:28:33.029
ZONING DISTRICTS AND THAT THAT  
WOULD RESULT IN A MORE          
CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF OF

03:28:37.968 --> 03:28:40.436
OF THOSE CHANGES.               
&gt;&gt; I THINK CHOOSING ELEVEN      
PARCELS WOULDN&apos;T BE CONSISTENT  

03:28:40.438 --> 03:28:41.170

DON&apos;T GET A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY  

03:28:48.579 --> 03:28:52.014
I APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT BUT WE 
DON&apos;T GET A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY  
FOR INBOUND ZONING CHANGES LIKE

THINK JUST CEMENTS WHAT IS IN   
PLACE AND WE&apos;RE ALREADY         
FOURTEEN YEARS OVERDUE WITH HOW

FOURTEEN YEARS OVERDUE WITH HOW 
WE WANT TO USE THE LAND AND NOW

FEET SO I MEAN MAYBE IF SOMEONE 
MAKES A MOTION I WILL SECOND IT 

03:29:16.707 --> 03:29:17.507
FEET SO I MEAN MAYBE IF SOMEONE 
MAKES A MOTION I WILL SECOND IT 
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A          

03:29:17.509 --> 03:29:20.443
MAKES A MOTION I WILL SECOND IT 
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A          
DISCUSSION THAT WE LIKE IN      

03:29:20.445 --> 03:29:21.243
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A          
DISCUSSION THAT WE LIKE IN      
PLAYING SPACE YOU FIND OUT WHO  

03:29:21.245 --> 03:29:24.012
DISCUSSION THAT WE LIKE IN      
PLAYING SPACE YOU FIND OUT WHO  
YOUR PARTNER IS.                

03:29:24.014 --> 03:29:24.980
PLAYING SPACE YOU FIND OUT WHO  
YOUR PARTNER IS.                
&gt;&gt; YEAH SURE WHICH I WOULD ADD  

03:29:24.982 --> 03:29:27.283
YOUR PARTNER IS.                
&gt;&gt; YEAH SURE WHICH I WOULD ADD  
ONE THING IS THAT SOME YOU WERE 

03:29:27.285 --> 03:29:27.950
&gt;&gt; YEAH SURE WHICH I WOULD ADD  
ONE THING IS THAT SOME YOU WERE 
INTERESTED IN EXPLORING         

03:29:27.952 --> 03:29:28.550
ONE THING IS THAT SOME YOU WERE 
INTERESTED IN EXPLORING         
PARTICULARLY GOING TO OUR       

03:29:28.552 --> 03:29:31.354
INTERESTED IN EXPLORING         
PARTICULARLY GOING TO OUR       
FORESEE THAT WOULD REQUIRE      

03:29:31.356 --> 03:29:31.854
PARTICULARLY GOING TO OUR       
FORESEE THAT WOULD REQUIRE      
DIFFERENT UTILITY               

03:29:31.856 --> 03:29:32.588
FORESEE THAT WOULD REQUIRE      
DIFFERENT UTILITY               
RECOMMENDATIONS UNDER THE       

03:29:32.590 --> 03:29:35.190
DIFFERENT UTILITY               
RECOMMENDATIONS UNDER THE       
CITY&apos;S SPECIFICATION.           

03:29:35.192 --> 03:29:39.595
RECOMMENDATIONS UNDER THE       
CITY&apos;S SPECIFICATION.           
&gt;&gt; SO I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH    

03:29:39.597 --> 03:29:43.099
CITY&apos;S SPECIFICATION.           
&gt;&gt; SO I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH    
WITH GEOFF&apos;S ARTICULATION.      

03:29:43.101 --> 03:29:44.100
&gt;&gt; SO I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH    
WITH GEOFF&apos;S ARTICULATION.      
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE COMPREHENSIVE    

03:29:44.102 --> 03:29:44.967
WITH GEOFF&apos;S ARTICULATION.      
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE COMPREHENSIVE    
PLAN IS THE PLACE TO HAVE THAT. 

03:29:44.969 --> 03:29:49.204
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE COMPREHENSIVE    
PLAN IS THE PLACE TO HAVE THAT. 
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE I JUST 

03:29:49.206 --> 03:29:50.139
PLAN IS THE PLACE TO HAVE THAT. 
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE I JUST 
THINK IT WOULD BE SORT          

03:29:50.141 --> 03:29:53.342
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE I JUST 
THINK IT WOULD BE SORT          
OF ARBITRARY TO THESE PARCELS   

03:29:53.344 --> 03:29:54.210
THINK IT WOULD BE SORT          
OF ARBITRARY TO THESE PARCELS   
IN THE CONTEXT OF A LARGER LAND 

03:29:54.212 --> 03:29:54.677
OF ARBITRARY TO THESE PARCELS   
IN THE CONTEXT OF A LARGER LAND 
USE PATTERN.                    

03:29:54.679 --> 03:29:57.079
IN THE CONTEXT OF A LARGER LAND 
USE PATTERN.                    
I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE        

03:29:57.081 --> 03:29:57.680
USE PATTERN.                    
I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE        
FRUITFUL TO HAVE THAT           

03:29:57.682 --> 03:29:58.348
I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE        
FRUITFUL TO HAVE THAT           
CONVERSATION OVER A BROADER     

03:29:58.350 --> 03:30:01.183
FRUITFUL TO HAVE THAT           
CONVERSATION OVER A BROADER     
LANDESBANK.                     

03:30:01.185 --> 03:30:02.351
CONVERSATION OVER A BROADER     
LANDESBANK.                     
BUT IF I WERE SO INTERESTED WE  

03:30:02.353 --> 03:30:05.120
LANDESBANK.                     
BUT IF I WERE SO INTERESTED WE  
OF COURSE WE ARE HAPPY JUST     

03:30:05.122 --> 03:30:05.988
BUT IF I WERE SO INTERESTED WE  
OF COURSE WE ARE HAPPY JUST     
LIKE THE LAST POSITION AND      

03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.655
OF COURSE WE ARE HAPPY JUST     
LIKE THE LAST POSITION AND      
WE&apos;RE HAPPY TO DO THE WORK      

03:30:06.657 --> 03:30:07.457
LIKE THE LAST POSITION AND      
WE&apos;RE HAPPY TO DO THE WORK      
OF THE COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY  

03:30:07.459 --> 03:30:08.924
WE&apos;RE HAPPY TO DO THE WORK      
OF THE COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY  
WITH OUR FORESEE THAT WOULD BE  

03:30:08.926 --> 03:30:09.658
OF THE COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY  
WITH OUR FORESEE THAT WOULD BE  
ONE THING THAT I&apos;D WANT TO      

03:30:09.660 --> 03:30:09.926
WITH OUR FORESEE THAT WOULD BE  
ONE THING THAT I&apos;D WANT TO      
EXPLORE.                        

03:30:09.928 --> 03:30:10.793
ONE THING THAT I&apos;D WANT TO      
EXPLORE.                        
THIS WAS REVIEWED BY STAFF FROM 

03:30:10.795 --> 03:30:12.694
EXPLORE.                        
THIS WAS REVIEWED BY STAFF FROM 
AN HOUR ONE PERSPECTIVE I       

03:30:12.696 --> 03:30:13.429
THIS WAS REVIEWED BY STAFF FROM 
AN HOUR ONE PERSPECTIVE I       
PRESUME THAT THAT WOULD BE      

03:30:13.431 --> 03:30:16.365
AN HOUR ONE PERSPECTIVE I       
PRESUME THAT THAT WOULD BE      
SIMILAR FINDINGS FOR R1 EIGHT   

03:30:16.367 --> 03:30:17.232
PRESUME THAT THAT WOULD BE      
SIMILAR FINDINGS FOR R1 EIGHT   
THROUGH MOST OF OUR DISTRICTS.  

03:30:17.234 --> 03:30:20.202
SIMILAR FINDINGS FOR R1 EIGHT   
THROUGH MOST OF OUR DISTRICTS.  
BUT ONCE YOU GO OUR FORESE WE   

03:30:20.204 --> 03:30:20.970
THROUGH MOST OF OUR DISTRICTS.  
BUT ONCE YOU GO OUR FORESE WE   
DO REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE LARGER   

03:30:20.972 --> 03:30:24.006
BUT ONCE YOU GO OUR FORESE WE   
DO REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE LARGER   
LEVELS OF WATER SERVICE.        

03:30:24.008 --> 03:30:24.806
DO REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE LARGER   
LEVELS OF WATER SERVICE.        
IT MIGHT BRING IN FIRE          

03:30:24.808 --> 03:30:25.474
LEVELS OF WATER SERVICE.        
IT MIGHT BRING IN FIRE          
SUPPRESSION DIFFERENT IT MIGHT  

03:30:25.476 --> 03:30:25.941
IT MIGHT BRING IN FIRE          
SUPPRESSION DIFFERENT IT MIGHT  
BE DIFFERENT.                   

03:30:25.943 --> 03:30:28.310
SUPPRESSION DIFFERENT IT MIGHT  
BE DIFFERENT.                   
A FIRE HYDRANT REQUIREMENTS SO  

03:30:28.312 --> 03:30:29.344
BE DIFFERENT.                   
A FIRE HYDRANT REQUIREMENTS SO  
THAT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT SORT  

03:30:29.346 --> 03:30:31.980
A FIRE HYDRANT REQUIREMENTS SO  
THAT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT SORT  
OF LAYER OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE  

03:30:31.982 --> 03:30:32.715
THAT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT SORT  
OF LAYER OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE  
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND        

03:30:32.717 --> 03:30:33.315
OF LAYER OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE  
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND        
WHETHER OR NOT IT COULD         

03:30:33.317 --> 03:30:35.851
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND        
WHETHER OR NOT IT COULD         
ACCOMMODATE THAT ZONING WITHOUT 

03:30:35.853 --> 03:30:36.652
WHETHER OR NOT IT COULD         
ACCOMMODATE THAT ZONING WITHOUT 
SOME OTHER MORE SIGNIFICANT     

03:30:36.654 --> 03:30:37.252
ACCOMMODATE THAT ZONING WITHOUT 
SOME OTHER MORE SIGNIFICANT     
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.            

03:30:37.254 --> 03:30:40.489
SOME OTHER MORE SIGNIFICANT     
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.            
BUT I&apos;M SPECULATING AT THAT.    

03:30:40.491 --> 03:30:41.356
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.

HORSESHOE THAT FRONT PAULENE    
WHICH ARE ALL ZONED ARE TO SO   

03:31:40.318 --> 03:31:41.116
HORSESHOE THAT FRONT PAULENE    
WHICH ARE ALL ZONED ARE TO SO   
ANYTHING THAT FRONTS A MAJOR    

03:31:41.118 --> 03:31:43.318

ARE ZONED R1 SO SIMILARLY WE    

03:31:47.825 --> 03:31:51.493
INTERIOR RESIDENTIAL PARCELS    
ARE ZONED R1 SO SIMILARLY WE    
HAVE SEVERAL PARCELS HERE ALONG 

03:31:51.495 --> 03:31:52.427
ARE ZONED R1 SO SIMILARLY WE    
HAVE SEVERAL PARCELS HERE ALONG 
BYRD AND NEWPORT THAT WOULD     

03:31:52.429 --> 03:31:55.731
HAVE SEVERAL PARCELS HERE ALONG 
BYRD AND NEWPORT THAT WOULD     
MESH A VERY SIMILAR PATTERN     

03:31:55.733 --> 03:31:56.598
BYRD AND NEWPORT THAT WOULD     
MESH A VERY SIMILAR PATTERN     
NEXT TO MY SEE THOSE ACTUALLY   

03:31:56.600 --> 03:31:59.668
MESH A VERY SIMILAR PATTERN     
NEXT TO MY SEE THOSE ACTUALLY   
ARE TWO THAT ALLOWS DUPLEXES    

03:31:59.670 --> 03:32:02.204
NEXT TO MY SEE THOSE ACTUALLY   
ARE TWO THAT ALLOWS DUPLEXES    
RATHER THAN LIKE AN EIGHTY      

03:32:02.206 --> 03:32:03.072
ARE TWO THAT ALLOWS DUPLEXES    
RATHER THAN LIKE AN EIGHTY      
RELATIVE TO THE SCALE AND       

03:32:03.074 --> 03:32:06.408
RATHER THAN LIKE AN EIGHTY      
RELATIVE TO THE SCALE AND       
SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCES LAP      

03:32:06.410 --> 03:32:06.642
RELATIVE TO THE SCALE AND       
SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCES LAP      
SIZE.                           

03:32:06.644 --> 03:32:07.710
SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCES LAP      
SIZE.                           
&gt;&gt; SO THERE IS A PATTERN WITHIN 

03:32:07.712 --> 03:32:11.113
SIZE.                           
&gt;&gt; SO THERE IS A PATTERN WITHIN 
THE CITY FOR OUR TWO ADJACENT   

03:32:11.115 --> 03:32:11.880
&gt;&gt; SO THERE IS A PATTERN WITHIN 
THE CITY FOR OUR TWO ADJACENT   
TO OUR ONE RELATIVE TO THE      

03:32:11.882 --> 03:32:14.983
THE CITY FOR OUR TWO ADJACENT   
TO OUR ONE RELATIVE TO THE      
SCALE OF THE CORRIDOR AND THAT  

03:32:14.985 --> 03:32:15.617
TO OUR ONE RELATIVE TO THE      
SCALE OF THE CORRIDOR AND THAT  
SEEMS APPROPRIATE AT THE        

03:32:15.619 --> 03:32:18.287
SCALE OF THE CORRIDOR AND THAT  
SEEMS APPROPRIATE AT THE

SO I DO KIND OF LIVE THAT MAYBE

I I WOULD PRESUME THAT OUR TWO  
IS MORE SIMILAR TO OUR ONE BUT  
I AGAIN I DON&apos;T WANT TO SPEAK   

03:33:13.410 --> 03:33:14.276
IS MORE SIMILAR TO OUR ONE BUT  
I AGAIN I DON&apos;T WANT TO SPEAK   
FOR A LOT OF TECHNICAL          

03:33:14.278 --> 03:33:14.844
I AGAIN I DON&apos;T WANT TO SPEAK   
FOR A LOT OF TECHNICAL          
EXPERTIZE ACROSS THE

EXPERTIZE ACROSS THE            
ORGANIZATION THAT HAS VETTED US 
FROM AN R ONE PERSPECTIVE.      

03:33:18.649 --> 03:33:22.384
ORGANIZATION THAT HAS VETTED US 
FROM AN R ONE PERSPECTIVE.      
&gt;&gt; YES, I THINK MY CONCERN IS   

03:33:22.386 --> 03:33:23.118
FROM AN R ONE PERSPECTIVE.      
&gt;&gt; YES, I THINK MY CONCERN IS   
THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT.      

03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:25.955
&gt;&gt; YES, I THINK MY CONCERN IS   
THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT.      
I MEAN KICKING THINGS TO THE    

03:33:25.957 --> 03:33:26.822
THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT.      
I MEAN KICKING THINGS TO THE    
PLAN WE&apos;RE NOT WE HAVEN&apos;T EVEN  

03:33:26.824 --> 03:33:29.691
I MEAN KICKING THINGS TO THE    
PLAN WE&apos;RE NOT WE HAVEN&apos;T EVEN  
STARTED THAT.                   

03:33:29.693 --> 03:33:30.426
PLAN WE&apos;RE NOT WE HAVEN&apos;T EVEN  
STARTED THAT.                   
THAT DOESN&apos;T START UNTIL JUNE   

03:33:30.428 --> 03:33:31.293
STARTED THAT.                   
THAT DOESN&apos;T START UNTIL JUNE   
AND THEN IT&apos;S GOING TO RUN FOR  

03:33:31.295 --> 03:33:33.696
THAT DOESN&apos;T START UNTIL JUNE   
AND THEN IT&apos;S GOING TO RUN FOR  
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THEN        

03:33:33.698 --> 03:33:34.663
AND THEN IT&apos;S GOING TO RUN FOR  
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THEN        
THERE&apos;S GOING TO BE A SET       

03:33:34.665 --> 03:33:35.330
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THEN        
THERE&apos;S GOING TO BE A SET       
OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE     

03:33:35.332 --> 03:33:36.932
THERE&apos;S GOING TO BE A SET       
OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE     
GOING TO GO ON FOR X MANY YEARS 

03:33:36.934 --> 03:33:37.933
OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE     
GOING TO GO ON FOR X MANY YEARS 
AND WHO KNOWS IF WE&apos;LL GET BACK 

03:33:37.935 --> 03:33:40.769
GOING TO GO ON FOR X MANY YEARS 
AND WHO KNOWS IF WE&apos;LL GET BACK 
TO THIS.                        

03:33:40.771 --> 03:33:44.506
AND WHO KNOWS IF WE&apos;LL GET BACK 
TO THIS.                        
AND SO I JUST THINK THAT THIS   

03:33:44.508 --> 03:33:45.508
TO THIS.                        
AND SO I JUST THINK THAT THIS   
MAKES SENSE TO ZONE IT FOR      

03:33:45.510 --> 03:33:48.978
AND SO I JUST THINK THAT THIS   
MAKES SENSE TO ZONE IT FOR      
SOMETHING DENSER THAN A TWENTY  

03:33:48.980 --> 03:33:52.581
MAKES SENSE TO ZONE IT FOR      
SOMETHING DENSER THAN A TWENTY  
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT.       

03:33:52.583 --> 03:33:56.218
SOMETHING DENSER THAN A TWENTY  
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT.       
&gt;&gt; SO IF I WOULD TRY TO MAKE AN 

03:33:56.220 --> 03:34:00.122
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT.       
&gt;&gt; SO IF I WOULD TRY TO MAKE AN 
AMENDMENT TO THIS, WHAT WOULD

IT&apos;S SAFE TO SAY THAT STAFF     
LOOKS FORWARD TO A COMMUNITY    

03:41:32.743 --> 03:41:33.475
IT&apos;S SAFE TO SAY THAT STAFF     
LOOKS FORWARD TO A COMMUNITY    
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT TO DO     

03:41:33.477 --> 03:41:34.276
LOOKS FORWARD TO A COMMUNITY

03:44:46.169 --> 03:44:46.567
JUST ALL OF US UP HERE          
UNDERSTAND INTIMATELY HOW LONG  
IT TAKES.                       

03:44:46.569 --> 03:44:50.037
UNDERSTAND INTIMATELY HOW LONG  
IT TAKES.                       
AND SO WE WERE I WOULD SAY THAT 

03:44:50.039 --> 03:44:51.239
IT TAKES.                       
AND SO WE WERE I WOULD SAY THAT 
IF THE CITY IS POISED TO TAKE   

03:44:51.241 --> 03:44:54.041
AND SO WE WERE I WOULD SAY THAT 
IF THE CITY IS POISED TO TAKE   
ON A TRANSFORMATION AROUND OUR  

03:44:54.043 --> 03:44:57.746
IF THE CITY IS POISED TO TAKE   
ON A TRANSFORMATION AROUND OUR  
ONE ZONING THE DAY WHEN THAT&apos;S  

03:44:57.748 --> 03:44:58.546
ON A TRANSFORMATION AROUND OUR  
ONE ZONING THE DAY WHEN THAT&apos;S  
ACTUALLY GOING TO GET PAST THE  

03:44:58.548 --> 03:45:01.750
ONE ZONING THE DAY WHEN THAT&apos;S  
ACTUALLY GOING TO GET PAST THE  
CITY COUNCIL IS THREE TO SIX    

03:45:01.752 --> 03:45:02.184
ACTUALLY GOING TO GET PAST THE  
CITY COUNCIL IS THREE TO SIX    
YEARS AWAY.                     

03:45:02.186 --> 03:45:06.254
CITY COUNCIL IS THREE TO SIX    
YEARS AWAY.                     
&gt;&gt; SO AND I THINK IN THAT TIME  

03:45:06.256 --> 03:45:08.689
YEARS AWAY.                     
&gt;&gt; SO AND I THINK IN THAT TIME  
IT&apos;S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE THAT    

03:45:08.691 --> 03:45:12.894
&gt;&gt; SO AND I THINK IN THAT TIME  
IT&apos;S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE THAT    
SOMEBODY COULD DIVIDE AND AND   

03:45:12.896 --> 03:45:13.694
IT&apos;S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE THAT    
SOMEBODY COULD DIVIDE AND AND   
BUILD TWICE AS MANY OR THREE    

03:45:13.696 --> 03:45:14.529
SOMEBODY COULD DIVIDE AND AND   
BUILD TWICE AS MANY OR THREE    
TIMES AS MANY HOMES ON SOME     

03:45:14.531 --> 03:45:16.498
BUILD TWICE AS MANY OR THREE    
TIMES AS MANY HOMES ON SOME     
OF THESE LOTS.                  

03:45:16.500 --> 03:45:20.102
TIMES AS MANY HOMES ON SOME     
OF THESE LOTS.

IT WOULD BE THAT IT&apos;S TOO       
PERFECT.

PERFECT.                        
IT MIGHT GIVE US THE IDEA THAT

FEATURES COULD SUCCEED          
EVERYWHERE IN ANN ARBOR AND WE  

03:52:39.542 --> 03:52:40.274
FEATURES COULD SUCCEED          
EVERYWHERE IN ANN ARBOR AND WE  
SHOULD DEMAND THEM ANYWHERE AND 

03:52:40.276 --> 03:52:41.075
EVERYWHERE IN ANN ARBOR AND WE  
SHOULD DEMAND THEM ANYWHERE AND 
EVERYWHERE AND DENY EVERYTHING  

03:52:41.077 --> 03:52:42.810
SHOULD DEMAND THEM ANYWHERE AND 
EVERYWHERE AND DENY EVERYTHING  
THAT FALLS SHORT.               

03:52:42.812 --> 03:52:43.744
EVERYWHERE AND DENY EVERYTHING  
THAT FALLS SHORT.

I DON&apos;T I DON&apos;T THINK THAT
