MOST OF THAT KIND OF CAME OUT   
OF THE PROCESS OF HAVING THREE  
NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS WHERE WE  

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.808
OF THE PROCESS OF HAVING THREE  
NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS WHERE WE  
HAD A LOT OF INPUT ESPECIALLY   

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.675
NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS WHERE WE  
HAD A LOT OF INPUT ESPECIALLY   
AT THE FIRST TWO MEETINGS AND   

00:10:34.677 --> 00:10:35.409
HAD A LOT OF INPUT ESPECIALLY   
AT THE FIRST TWO MEETINGS AND   
THEN THE ACTUAL LEGAL MEETING

AT THE FIRST TWO MEETINGS AND   
THEN THE ACTUAL LEGAL MEETING   
AT THE END.

AT THE END.                     
I THINK PEOPLE THERE WAS A

AT THE END.                     
I THINK PEOPLE THERE WAS A      
GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT WE WERE  

00:10:39.549 --> 00:10:41.382
I THINK PEOPLE THERE WAS A      
GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT WE WERE  
HEADING IN A VERY STRONG        

00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:42.383
GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT WE WERE  
HEADING IN A VERY STRONG        
DIRECTION AND I BELIEVE WE HAD  

00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:43.250
HEADING IN A VERY STRONG        
DIRECTION AND I BELIEVE WE HAD  
FOUR IF NOT FIVE MEETINGS WITH

DIRECTION AND I BELIEVE WE HAD  
FOUR IF NOT FIVE MEETINGS WITH  
STAFF AND THE FIRE MARSHAL.     

00:10:46.322 --> 00:10:47.187
FOUR IF NOT FIVE MEETINGS WITH  
STAFF AND THE FIRE MARSHAL.     
THIS BUILDING WAS REALLY VERY   

00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:49.323
STAFF AND THE FIRE MARSHAL.     
THIS BUILDING WAS REALLY VERY   
MUCH DRIVEN BY FIRE TRUCKS      

00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:50.057
THIS BUILDING WAS REALLY VERY   
MUCH DRIVEN BY FIRE TRUCKS      
BEING ABLE TO DRIVE AROUND IT

NEEDED TO DO THE FIRST FLOOR    

00:11:00.603 --> 00:11:01.536
ARCHITECTURE TO DO WHAT WE      
NEEDED TO DO THE FIRST FLOOR

NEEDED TO DO THE FIRST FLOOR    
BASICALLY HAS THE KEY ENTRY

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.809
THERE&amp;apos;S A SECONDARY ENTRANCE    
WHICH PROBABLY WILL BECOME      
SOMEWHAT MORE OF A DOMINANT     

00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:09.676
WHICH PROBABLY WILL BECOME      
SOMEWHAT MORE OF A DOMINANT     
ENTRANCE BECAUSE OF THE FACT    

00:11:09.678 --> 00:11:10.444
SOMEWHAT MORE OF A DOMINANT

YOU CAN GET OUT ONTO MANCHESTER

00:19:26.742 --> 00:19:30.477
MIDFORD APARTMENT SIX I LIVE    
BEHIND THIS WHAT THEY&amp;apos;RE        
PROPOSING THEY SAY THAT THE     

00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:32.946
BEHIND THIS WHAT THEY&amp;apos;RE        
PROPOSING THEY SAY THAT THE     
UNIVERSITY IN IS A TWO STOREY   

00:19:32.948 --> 00:19:34.015
PROPOSING THEY SAY THAT THE     
UNIVERSITY IN IS A TWO STOREY   
BUILDING BUT IF YOU GO TO THE   

00:19:34.017 --> 00:19:37.017
UNIVERSITY IN IS A TWO STOREY   
BUILDING BUT IF YOU GO TO THE   
BACK OF THE PARKING LOT AND     

00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:41.388
BUILDING BUT IF YOU GO TO THE   
BACK OF THE PARKING LOT AND     
LAMPPOST PLAZA THE BASEMENT IS  

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.855
BACK OF THE PARKING LOT AND     
LAMPPOST PLAZA THE BASEMENT IS  
ABOVE GROUND.

LAMPPOST PLAZA THE BASEMENT IS  
ABOVE GROUND.                   
SO IT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY A THREE STOREY 

00:19:45.194 --> 00:19:45.526
ABOVE GROUND.                   
SO IT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY A THREE STOREY 
BUILDING.                       

00:19:45.528 --> 00:19:48.396
SO IT&amp;apos;S ACTUALLY A THREE STOREY 
BUILDING.                       
SO IF YOU PUT A BUILDING IN     

00:19:48.398 --> 00:19:49.196
BUILDING.                       
SO IF YOU PUT A BUILDING IN     
THAT&amp;apos;S FOUR STORIES AT STADIUM  

00:19:49.198 --> 00:19:52.566
SO IF YOU PUT A BUILDING IN     
THAT&amp;apos;S FOUR STORIES AT STADIUM  
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE FIVE STORIES   

00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:52.966

IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE FIVE STORIES   
IN THE BACK.                    

00:19:52.968 --> 00:19:56.771
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE FIVE STORIES   
IN THE BACK.                    
AND JUST BEYOND THAT LITTLE     

00:19:56.773 --> 00:20:00.307
IN THE BACK.                    
AND JUST BEYOND THAT LITTLE     
PARKING STRIP THAT&amp;apos;S PART       

00:20:00.309 --> 00:20:01.075
AND JUST BEYOND THAT LITTLE     
PARKING STRIP THAT&amp;apos;S PART       
OF THE LAMPPOST PLAZA, THERE&amp;apos;S  

00:20:01.077 --> 00:20:04.377

00:20:05.081 --> 00:20:08.616
ANOTHER EIGHT FOOT DROP DOWN TO 
THE EVERYONE&amp;apos;S APARTMENTS.      
SO FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT IT   

00:20:08.618 --> 00:20:09.483
THE EVERYONE&amp;apos;S APARTMENTS.      
SO FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT IT

BUILDING BETWEEN THE PARKING    
LOT?                            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I BELIEVE THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT HE WAS 

00:25:25.033 --> 00:25:28.102
FIVE SEVENTY SIX OK THE THE THE 
WHOLE TREE THING WAS SOMETHING  
THAT WE WENT THROUGH WITH EACH  

00:25:28.104 --> 00:25:28.769
WHOLE TREE THING WAS SOMETHING  
THAT WE WENT THROUGH WITH EACH  
INDIVIDUAL TREE AND WE WORKED   

00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:29.502
THAT WE WENT THROUGH WITH EACH  
INDIVIDUAL TREE AND WE WORKED   
WITH CITY STAFF TO DETERMINE    

00:25:29.504 --> 00:25:30.237
INDIVIDUAL TREE AND WE WORKED   
WITH CITY STAFF TO DETERMINE    
WHICH THOSE TREES WERE, WHAT    

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:30.904
WITH CITY STAFF TO DETERMINE    
WHICH THOSE TREES WERE, WHAT    
DIAMETER THEY ARE AND WHICH     

00:25:30.906 --> 00:25:31.505
WHICH THOSE TREES WERE, WHAT    
DIAMETER THEY ARE AND WHICH     
LANDMARK TREES WOULD NEED TO    

00:25:31.507 --> 00:25:31.972
DIAMETER THEY ARE AND WHICH     
LANDMARK TREES WOULD NEED TO    
COME DOWN.                      

00:25:31.974 --> 00:25:32.606
LANDMARK TREES WOULD NEED TO    
COME DOWN.                      
SO THE SPECIFICS OF EACH TREE   

00:25:32.608 --> 00:25:33.140
COME DOWN.                      
SO THE SPECIFICS OF EACH TREE   
HAVE BEEN REVIEWED.             

00:25:33.142 --> 00:25:33.874
SO THE SPECIFICS OF EACH TREE   
HAVE BEEN REVIEWED.             
I&amp;apos;M NOT SURE IF IF THE SPEAKER  

00:25:33.876 --> 00:25:34.541
HAVE BEEN REVIEWED.             
I&amp;apos;M NOT SURE IF IF THE SPEAKER  
REALIZES HE MIGHT BUT BUT I     

00:25:34.543 --> 00:25:35.409
I&amp;apos;M NOT SURE IF IF THE SPEAKER  
REALIZES HE MIGHT BUT BUT I     
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUR 

00:25:35.411 --> 00:25:36.010
REALIZES HE MIGHT BUT BUT I     
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUR 
BUILDING IS SET TWENTY FEET     

00:25:36.012 --> 00:25:37.477
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUR 
BUILDING IS SET TWENTY FEET     
BACK FROM OUR PROPERTY LINE AND 

00:25:37.479 --> 00:25:38.478
BUILDING IS SET TWENTY FEET     
BACK FROM OUR PROPERTY LINE AND 
THAT PRETTY MUCH PUTS IT CLOSE  

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.648
BACK FROM OUR PROPERTY LINE AND 
THAT PRETTY MUCH PUTS IT CLOSE  
TO WHERE THE EXISTING           

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:42.116
THAT PRETTY MUCH PUTS IT CLOSE  
TO WHERE THE EXISTING           
UNIVERSITY IN IS.               

00:25:42.118 --> 00:25:45.752
TO WHERE THE EXISTING           
UNIVERSITY IN IS.               
BUT THEN IN FRONT OF THAT WHICH 

00:25:45.754 --> 00:25:46.519
UNIVERSITY IN IS.               
BUT THEN IN FRONT OF THAT WHICH 
ISN&amp;apos;T OUR PROPERTY IT VARIES    

00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:49.456
BUT THEN IN FRONT OF THAT WHICH 
ISN&amp;apos;T OUR PROPERTY IT VARIES    
FROM TWENTY TO ALMOST ABOUT     

00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:50.391
ISN&amp;apos;T OUR PROPERTY IT VARIES    
FROM TWENTY TO ALMOST ABOUT     
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE 

00:25:50.393 --> 00:25:53.427
FROM TWENTY TO ALMOST ABOUT     
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE 
FEET OF ANOTHER STRIP OF LAND   

00:25:53.429 --> 00:25:54.361
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE 
FEET OF ANOTHER STRIP OF LAND   
AND I&amp;apos;M SURE THE SPEAKER HAS    

00:25:54.363 --> 00:25:55.295
FEET OF ANOTHER STRIP OF LAND   
AND I&amp;apos;M SURE THE SPEAKER HAS    
HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT ALL     

00:25:55.297 --> 00:25:56.930
AND I&amp;apos;M SURE THE SPEAKER HAS    
HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT ALL     
OF THOSE BUT MANY OF THOSE      

00:25:56.932 --> 00:25:57.831
HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT ALL     
OF THOSE BUT MANY OF THOSE      
TREES ARE NOT ON OUR PROPERTY   

00:25:57.833 --> 00:25:58.632
OF THOSE BUT MANY OF THOSE      
TREES ARE NOT ON OUR PROPERTY   
AND THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT GOING TO BE     

00:25:58.634 --> 00:26:00.701
TREES ARE NOT ON OUR PROPERTY   
AND THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT GOING TO BE     
TOUCHED.                        

00:26:00.703 --> 00:26:01.769
AND THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT GOING TO BE     
TOUCHED.                        
SO THE MITIGATION THAT WE&amp;apos;VE    

00:26:01.771 --> 00:26:04.805
TOUCHED.                        
SO THE MITIGATION THAT WE&amp;apos;VE    
PROPOSED IS TO REPLACE THE      

00:26:04.807 --> 00:26:05.739
SO THE MITIGATION THAT WE&amp;apos;VE    
PROPOSED IS TO REPLACE THE      
TREES THAT WE NEEDED TO REMOVE  

00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:08.876
PROPOSED IS TO REPLACE THE      
TREES THAT WE NEEDED TO REMOVE  
TO MAKE THE DEVELOPMENT WORK.   

00:26:08.878 --> 00:26:09.810
TREES THAT WE NEEDED TO REMOVE  
TO MAKE THE DEVELOPMENT WORK.   
SOME OF THAT ACCESS ON THAT     

00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:10.610
TO MAKE THE DEVELOPMENT WORK.   
SOME OF THAT ACCESS ON THAT     
SIDE UNFORTUNATELY IS FOR THE   

00:26:10.612 --> 00:26:13.379
SOME OF THAT ACCESS ON THAT     
SIDE UNFORTUNATELY IS FOR THE   
FIRE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE ACCESS  

00:26:13.381 --> 00:26:14.114
SIDE UNFORTUNATELY IS FOR THE   
FIRE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE ACCESS  
AND TO GIVE THEM ENOUGH OF A    

00:26:14.116 --> 00:26:14.915
FIRE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE ACCESS  
AND TO GIVE THEM ENOUGH OF A    
SIDEWALK TO BE ABLE TO RUN      

00:26:14.917 --> 00:26:17.417
AND TO GIVE THEM ENOUGH OF A    
SIDEWALK TO BE ABLE TO RUN      
AROUND AND WALK AROUND THE      

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:17.784
SIDEWALK TO BE ABLE TO RUN      
AROUND AND WALK AROUND THE      
BUILDING.                       

00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:18.519
AROUND AND WALK AROUND THE      
BUILDING.                       
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE     

00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:20.587
BUILDING.                       
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE     
LOOKED AT TO TRY TO MITIGATE    

00:26:20.589 --> 00:26:21.387
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE     
LOOKED AT TO TRY TO MITIGATE    
THAT INVOLVED ACTUALLY HAVING   

00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:24.591
LOOKED AT TO TRY TO MITIGATE    
THAT INVOLVED ACTUALLY HAVING   
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAVE A ROAD 

00:26:24.593 --> 00:26:25.559
THAT INVOLVED ACTUALLY HAVING   
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAVE A ROAD 
AROUND THE BUILDING WHICH THEN  

00:26:25.561 --> 00:26:26.293
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAVE A ROAD 
AROUND THE BUILDING WHICH THEN  
CAUSED EVEN MORE DAMAGE TO THE  

00:26:26.295 --> 00:26:28.728
AROUND THE BUILDING WHICH THEN  
CAUSED EVEN MORE DAMAGE TO THE  
TREES THAT WE WERE GOING TO     

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.029
CAUSED EVEN MORE DAMAGE TO THE  
TREES THAT WE WERE GOING TO     
PROPOSE.                        

00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:29.830
TREES THAT WE WERE GOING TO     
PROPOSE.                        
SO I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT    

00:26:29.832 --> 00:26:32.031
PROPOSE.                        
SO I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT    
OUT AND I WOULD REALLY QUICKLY  

00:26:32.033 --> 00:26:32.799
SO I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT    
OUT AND I WOULD REALLY QUICKLY  
WANT TO JUST ADDRESS THE OTHER  

00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:35.735
OUT AND I WOULD REALLY QUICKLY  
WANT TO JUST ADDRESS THE OTHER  
SPEAKERS QUESTIONS WE WOULD     

00:26:35.737 --> 00:26:36.669
WANT TO JUST ADDRESS THE OTHER  
SPEAKERS QUESTIONS WE WOULD     
ABSOLUTELY BE WORKING WITH THE  

00:26:36.671 --> 00:26:37.470
SPEAKERS QUESTIONS WE WOULD     
ABSOLUTELY BE WORKING WITH THE  
CHURCH TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER WE 

00:26:37.472 --> 00:26:40.407
ABSOLUTELY BE WORKING WITH THE  
CHURCH TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER WE 
DO AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THEIR   

00:26:40.409 --> 00:26:42.942
CHURCH TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER WE 
DO AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THEIR   
PARKING WHETHER THAT WAS DURING 

00:26:42.944 --> 00:26:43.777
DO AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THEIR   
PARKING WHETHER THAT WAS DURING 
THE WEEKDAYS OR ESPECIALLY      

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:44.445
PARKING WHETHER THAT WAS DURING 
THE WEEKDAYS OR ESPECIALLY      
OBVIOUSLY ON THE WEEKENDS.      

00:26:44.447 --> 00:26:47.747
THE WEEKDAYS OR ESPECIALLY      
OBVIOUSLY ON THE WEEKENDS.      
SO THAT WOULD JUST BE A         

00:26:47.749 --> 00:26:48.381
OBVIOUSLY ON THE WEEKENDS.      
SO THAT WOULD JUST BE A         
STANDARD PART OF DOING A        

00:26:48.383 --> 00:26:48.916
SO THAT WOULD JUST BE A         
STANDARD PART OF DOING A        
PROJECT IN ANN ARBOR.           

00:26:48.918 --> 00:26:51.184
STANDARD PART OF DOING A        
PROJECT IN ANN ARBOR.           
SO I CAN ASSURE HER THAT THAT   

00:26:51.186 --> 00:26:51.819
PROJECT IN ANN ARBOR.           
SO I CAN ASSURE HER THAT THAT   
WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL     

00:26:51.821 --> 00:26:52.619
SO I CAN ASSURE HER THAT THAT   
WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL

JUST FOR EVERYBODY&amp;apos;S BENEFIT WE 
COULD ARTICULATE WHERE THE

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK AND THEN WHAT IS          

00:40:06.147 --> 00:40:09.148
BENCHMARK WHERE ZERO IS.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK AND THEN WHAT IS          
ADDITIONAL ON THE SOUTH SIDE    

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.016
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK AND THEN WHAT IS          
ADDITIONAL ON THE SOUTH SIDE    
OF THE BUILDING WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A 

00:40:10.018 --> 00:40:13.218

ENGINEER BUT I THINK IT HAS     
MORE TO DO WITH THE IF THE      

00:45:32.406 --> 00:45:35.807
ENGINEER BUT I THINK IT HAS     
MORE TO DO WITH THE IF THE      
TRAFFIC VOLUMES ARE INCREASE    

00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:36.508
MORE TO DO WITH THE IF THE      
TRAFFIC VOLUMES ARE INCREASE    
AND THEIR CIRCULATION ISSUES    

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.176
TRAFFIC VOLUMES ARE INCREASE    
AND THEIR CIRCULATION ISSUES    
THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE       

00:45:37.178 --> 00:45:39.779
AND THEIR CIRCULATION ISSUES    
THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE       
FUTURE IF IT IS CAUSING         

00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:40.446
THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE       
FUTURE IF IT IS CAUSING         
CONGESTION AT THE ENTRANCE      

00:45:40.448 --> 00:45:44.015
FUTURE IF IT IS CAUSING         
CONGESTION AT THE ENTRANCE      
THERE AT WASHTENAW STADIUM THAT 

00:45:44.017 --> 00:45:44.750
CONGESTION AT THE ENTRANCE      
THERE AT WASHTENAW STADIUM THAT 
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD THAT OPTION SINCE     

00:45:44.752 --> 00:45:45.551
THERE AT WASHTENAW STADIUM THAT 
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD THAT OPTION SINCE     
IT&amp;apos;S ON THE SITE THEN THAT YES, 

00:45:45.553 --> 00:45:48.020
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD THAT OPTION SINCE     
IT&amp;apos;S ON THE SITE THEN THAT YES, 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A RIGHT    

00:45:48.022 --> 00:45:48.554
IT&amp;apos;S ON THE SITE THEN THAT YES, 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A RIGHT    
TURN ONLY RIGHT IN.             

00:45:48.556 --> 00:45:49.155
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A RIGHT    
TURN ONLY RIGHT IN.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT OUT.

TURN ONLY RIGHT IN.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT OUT.                   
SO WHAT IF                      

00:46:08.909 --> 00:46:16.315
           I CAN ASK A FOLLOW

THIS PROJECT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; UM, I BELIEVE THAT THE       
CONCERN WAS WITH THE WESTBOUND  

00:46:40.508 --> 00:46:41.239
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; UM, I BELIEVE THAT THE       
CONCERN WAS WITH THE WESTBOUND  
ELECTRON MOVEMENT INTO THE SITE 

00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:42.174
CONCERN WAS WITH THE WESTBOUND  
ELECTRON MOVEMENT INTO THE SITE 
JUST CONCERNED THAT THAT        

00:46:42.176 --> 00:46:43.408
ELECTRON MOVEMENT INTO THE SITE 
JUST CONCERNED THAT THAT        
MOVEMENT MAY BE BACKING UP      

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:43.876
JUST CONCERNED THAT THAT        
MOVEMENT MAY BE BACKING UP      
TRAFFIC THROUGH THE             

00:46:43.878 --> 00:46:44.543
MOVEMENT MAY BE BACKING UP      
TRAFFIC THROUGH THE             
INTERSECTION.                   

00:46:44.545 --> 00:46:45.544
TRAFFIC THROUGH THE             
INTERSECTION.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOWEVER, OUR TRAFFIC MODELS  

00:46:45.546 --> 00:46:46.211
INTERSECTION.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOWEVER, OUR TRAFFIC MODELS  
AND OUR TRIP ESTIMATES DID NOT  

00:46:46.213 --> 00:46:47.413
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOWEVER, OUR TRAFFIC MODELS  
AND OUR TRIP ESTIMATES DID NOT  
SEE A MUCH BIGGER INCREASE THAN 

00:46:47.415 --> 00:46:48.080
AND OUR TRIP ESTIMATES DID NOT  
SEE A MUCH BIGGER INCREASE THAN 
WHAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY THERE.         

00:46:48.082 --> 00:46:48.947
SEE A MUCH BIGGER INCREASE THAN 
WHAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY THERE.         
NOW AS FAR AS THOSE LONG TERM   

00:46:48.949 --> 00:46:51.150
WHAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY THERE.         
NOW AS FAR AS THOSE LONG TERM   
MOVEMENTS AND THE Q WE DO A     

00:46:51.152 --> 00:46:51.951
NOW AS FAR AS THOSE LONG TERM   
MOVEMENTS AND THE Q WE DO A     
RING ANALYSIS AND THEN ONLY     

00:46:51.953 --> 00:46:55.654
MOVEMENTS AND THE Q WE DO A     
RING ANALYSIS AND THEN ONLY     
SHOW AT THE MOST WE&amp;apos;LL BE ABLE  

00:46:55.656 --> 00:46:59.991
RING ANALYSIS AND THEN ONLY     
SHOW AT THE MOST WE&amp;apos;LL BE ABLE  
TO TURN IN THERE AND SO IT WAS  

00:46:59.993 --> 00:47:02.661
SHOW AT THE MOST WE&amp;apos;LL BE ABLE  
TO TURN IN THERE AND SO IT WAS  
APPROVED BUT JUST THEY WANT TO  

00:47:02.663 --> 00:47:03.495
TO TURN IN THERE AND SO IT WAS  
APPROVED BUT JUST THEY WANT TO  
MONITOR THAT IF THERE IS A      

00:47:03.497 --> 00:47:07.032
APPROVED BUT JUST THEY WANT TO

IT&amp;apos;S YOUR PREDECESSOR DURING    
THOSE COMMUNITY MEETINGS EVEN   

02:25:00.735 --> 02:25:01.468
IT&amp;apos;S YOUR PREDECESSOR DURING    
THOSE COMMUNITY MEETINGS EVEN   
IF IT WASN&amp;apos;T CODIFIED IN A      

02:25:01.470 --> 02:25:04.170
THOSE COMMUNITY MEETINGS EVEN   
IF IT WASN&amp;apos;T CODIFIED IN A      
DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.          

02:25:04.172 --> 02:25:05.138
IF IT WASN&amp;apos;T CODIFIED IN A      
DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.          
MY GUESS IS THAT THERE WERE     

02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:05.739
DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.          
MY GUESS IS THAT THERE WERE     
DISCUSSIONS, REAL SUBSTANTIVE   

02:25:05.741 --> 02:25:08.808
MY GUESS IS THAT THERE WERE     
DISCUSSIONS, REAL SUBSTANTIVE   
DISCUSSION THAT LED PEOPLE TO   

02:25:08.810 --> 02:25:09.576
DISCUSSIONS, REAL SUBSTANTIVE   
DISCUSSION THAT LED PEOPLE TO   
BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO 

02:25:09.578 --> 02:25:12.378
DISCUSSION THAT LED PEOPLE TO   
BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO 
BE RETAIL HERE.                 

02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:13.312
BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO 
BE RETAIL HERE.                 
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY      

02:25:13.314 --> 02:25:13.980
BE RETAIL HERE.                 
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY      
WHERE THE GENESIS OF A LOT      

02:25:13.982 --> 02:25:16.682
SO I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY      
WHERE THE GENESIS OF A LOT      
OF THIS KIND OF DISCORD AND     

02:25:16.684 --> 02:25:17.383
WHERE THE GENESIS OF A LOT      
OF THIS KIND OF DISCORD AND     
DISGRUNTLEMENT WITH THE GENERAL 

02:25:17.385 --> 02:25:20.386
OF THIS KIND OF DISCORD AND     
DISGRUNTLEMENT WITH THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC IS ON THIS APPROACH.     

02:25:20.388 --> 02:25:21.320
DISGRUNTLEMENT WITH THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC IS ON THIS APPROACH.     
MY CONCERN ABOUT JUST LIMITING  

02:25:21.555 --> 02:25:27.326
END CAPS IS THAT WE DON&amp;apos;T       
NECESSARILY HAVE ANY KIND       
OF MEANINGFUL CLUSTERING OR     

02:25:27.328 --> 02:25:28.260
NECESSARILY HAVE ANY KIND       
OF MEANINGFUL CLUSTERING OR     
CONCENTRATION AND SO IT WOULD   

02:25:28.262 --> 02:25:31.998
OF MEANINGFUL CLUSTERING OR     
CONCENTRATION AND SO IT WOULD   
BE SERVICE ONLY AND I THINK     

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:32.765
CONCENTRATION AND SO IT WOULD   
BE SERVICE ONLY AND I THINK     
THAT&amp;apos;S YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S BETTER    

02:25:32.767 --> 02:25:36.069
BE SERVICE ONLY AND I THINK

02:25:36.404 --> 02:25:38.605
THAN NOTHING, I&amp;apos;LL TELL YOU     
THAT.                           
SO YOU KNOW OF THE MINDSET THAT 

02:25:38.607 --> 02:25:39.505
THAT.                           
SO YOU KNOW OF THE MINDSET THAT 
YOU KNOW, A CONDITION AND

TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCE.   
SO WHAT THE TENANT NEEDS TO PUT 

02:35:03.637 --> 02:35:06.238
TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCE.   
SO WHAT THE TENANT NEEDS TO PUT 
INTO THE SPACE WHAT THE         

02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:07.038
SO WHAT THE TENANT NEEDS TO PUT 
INTO THE SPACE WHAT THE         
LANDLORD CAN AFFORD TO PUT IN   

02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:10.409

LONG IT TAKES TO SUCCEED AND    
HAVE A PROFIT MARGIN ON THAT.   

02:35:13.814 --> 02:35:14.747
LONG IT TAKES TO SUCCEED AND    
HAVE A PROFIT MARGIN ON THAT.   
THOSE ARE JUST VERY BIG HURDLES 

02:35:14.749 --> 02:35:17.315
HAVE A PROFIT MARGIN ON THAT.   
THOSE ARE JUST VERY BIG HURDLES 
IN THIS SPACE AND A SILO AND    

02:35:17.317 --> 02:35:20.886
THOSE ARE JUST VERY BIG HURDLES 
IN THIS SPACE AND A SILO AND    
DOING TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET  

02:35:20.888 --> 02:35:21.720
IN THIS SPACE AND A SILO AND    
DOING TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET  
OF MAKES IT HARDER IN THE       

02:35:21.722 --> 02:35:22.621
DOING TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET  
OF MAKES IT HARDER IN THE       
CLUSTER PART IT&amp;apos;S GOT TO BE A

DIDN&amp;apos;T THINK THEY WOULD AND WE  
HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY WON&amp;apos;T      
BECAUSE WE DELIBERATED THE      

02:38:24.171 --> 02:38:27.806
HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY WON&amp;apos;T      
BECAUSE WE DELIBERATED THE      
ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED.        

02:38:27.808 --> 02:38:28.840
BECAUSE WE DELIBERATED THE      
ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED.        
AND SO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW   

02:38:28.842 --> 02:38:32.044
ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED.        
AND SO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW

02:38:39.454 --> 02:38:40.252
MOTION WHICH SOME OF US FEEL    
MIGHT BE A GOOD THING AND       
OTHERS OF US HAVE SUGGESTED     

02:38:40.254 --> 02:38:43.556
MIGHT BE A GOOD THING AND       
OTHERS OF US HAVE SUGGESTED     
MIGHT JUST BE A SYMBOLIC THING  

02:38:43.558 --> 02:38:47.692
OTHERS OF US HAVE SUGGESTED     
MIGHT JUST BE A SYMBOLIC THING  
THAT DOESN&amp;apos;T DOESN&amp;apos;T DOESN&amp;apos;T    

02:38:47.694 --> 02:38:48.627
MIGHT JUST BE A SYMBOLIC THING  
THAT DOESN&amp;apos;T DOESN&amp;apos;T DOESN&amp;apos;T    
GET WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT IN

AND SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD   
PROPOSE THE MOTION THE

THE NUMBER FORTY IS AN ESTIMATE 

02:57:28.214 --> 02:57:31.315
STATE GIVES US A LICENSE.       
THE NUMBER FORTY IS AN ESTIMATE 
BASED ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT 

02:57:31.317 --> 02:57:32.382
THE NUMBER FORTY IS AN ESTIMATE 
BASED ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT 
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT THE NUMBER OF THE

WE EXPECT THAT THAT IT WILL     
PROBABLY BE LOWER THAN THAT.    
AND WE ALSO WANT TO MENTION

THAT THE RATIO FOR OLDER        
CHILDREN THAT THE FOUR TO ONE

02:58:03.049 --> 02:58:06.350
HAVE ALL PRESCHOOLERS.          
SO THE ACTUAL NUMBER            
OF CAREGIVERS IS GOING TO BE    

02:58:06.352 --> 02:58:09.954
SO THE ACTUAL NUMBER

POINT IN THE DAY.               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANOTHER POINT THAT I WANTED

OF CARS SO WE HAVE EXPERIENCED  
IN OUR CURRENT LOCATION THAT    

02:59:33.940 --> 02:59:34.739
OF CARS SO WE HAVE EXPERIENCED  
IN OUR CURRENT LOCATION THAT    
THE NUMBER OF CARS THAT         

02:59:34.741 --> 02:59:37.275
IN OUR CURRENT LOCATION THAT    
THE NUMBER OF CARS THAT

02:59:37.277 --> 02:59:38.041
THE NUMBER OF CARS THAT         
BUSINESS PLACES IS SMALLER THAN 
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND      

02:59:38.043 --> 02:59:40.945
BUSINESS PLACES IS SMALLER THAN 
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND      
THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS  

02:59:40.947 --> 02:59:41.279
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND      
THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS  
.                               

02:59:41.281 --> 02:59:42.480
THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS  
.                               
THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE AND   

02:59:42.482 --> 02:59:45.783
.                               
THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE AND   
WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE    

02:59:45.785 --> 02:59:46.517
THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE AND   
WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE    
SIBLING GROUPS AT OUR NEW       

02:59:46.519 --> 02:59:46.918
WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE    
SIBLING GROUPS AT OUR NEW       
LOCATION AS WELL.               

02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:49.520
SIBLING GROUPS AT OUR NEW       
LOCATION AS WELL.               
AND SO OBVIOUSLY A SIBLING      

02:59:49.522 --> 02:59:50.521
LOCATION AS WELL.               
AND SO OBVIOUSLY A SIBLING      
GROUP ALL COMES IN THE SAME CAR 

02:59:50.523 --> 02:59:53.891
AND SO OBVIOUSLY A SIBLING      
GROUP ALL COMES IN THE SAME CAR 
AND SO THAT REDUCES THE NUMBER  

02:59:53.893 --> 02:59:54.425
GROUP ALL COMES IN THE SAME CAR 
AND SO THAT REDUCES THE NUMBER  
OF CARS.                        

02:59:54.427 --> 02:59:57.127
AND SO THAT REDUCES THE NUMBER  
OF CARS.                        
THE OTHER THING IS THAT ONE     

02:59:57.129 --> 02:59:57.961
OF CARS.                        
THE OTHER THING IS THAT ONE     
OF THE REALLY GREAT THINGS      

02:59:57.963 --> 03:00:01.232
THE OTHER THING IS THAT ONE     
OF THE REALLY GREAT THINGS      
ABOUT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND     

03:00:01.234 --> 03:00:02.032

ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY           
OF PARKING LOT WE DON&amp;apos;T LIKE    
THAT IDEA FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  

03:00:50.450 --> 03:00:53.818
OF PARKING LOT WE DON&amp;apos;T LIKE    
THAT IDEA FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  
FIRSTLY BECAUSE IT WOULD        

03:00:53.820 --> 03:00:54.485
THAT IDEA FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  
FIRSTLY BECAUSE IT WOULD        
REQUIRE THE REMOVAL OF MORE     

03:00:54.487 --> 03:00:57.755
FIRSTLY BECAUSE IT WOULD        
REQUIRE THE REMOVAL OF MORE     
MATURE TREES AND WE OBVIOUSLY   

03:00:57.757 --> 03:00:58.222
REQUIRE THE REMOVAL OF MORE     
MATURE TREES AND WE OBVIOUSLY   
DON&amp;apos;T LIKE THAT.                

03:00:58.224 --> 03:01:00.591
MATURE TREES AND WE OBVIOUSLY   
DON&amp;apos;T LIKE THAT.                
SECONDLY, IT WOULD CREATE A     

03:01:00.593 --> 03:01:01.259
DON&amp;apos;T LIKE THAT.                
SECONDLY, IT WOULD CREATE A     
LARGE AREA OF IMPERMEABLE       

03:01:01.261 --> 03:01:04.962
SECONDLY, IT WOULD CREATE A     
LARGE AREA OF IMPERMEABLE       
SURFACE AND WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO DO 

03:01:04.964 --> 03:01:08.666
LARGE AREA OF IMPERMEABLE       
SURFACE AND WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO DO 
THAT AND THEN IT WOULD IT WOULD 

03:01:08.668 --> 03:01:09.334
SURFACE AND WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO DO 
THAT AND THEN IT WOULD IT WOULD 
ALSO TAKE AWAY FROM THE         

03:01:09.336 --> 03:01:12.003
THAT AND THEN IT WOULD IT WOULD 
ALSO TAKE AWAY FROM THE         
PLAYGROUND SPACE THAT WE HAVE   

03:01:12.005 --> 03:01:13.003
ALSO TAKE AWAY FROM THE         
PLAYGROUND SPACE THAT WE HAVE   
THERE AND IT IS REQUIRED BY     

03:01:13.005 --> 03:01:16.273
PLAYGROUND SPACE THAT WE HAVE   
THERE AND IT IS REQUIRED BY     
LICENSING AND THEN IT WOULD     

03:01:16.275 --> 03:01:22.580
THERE AND IT IS REQUIRED BY     
LICENSING AND THEN IT WOULD     
JUST NOT FIT                    

03:01:36.862 --> 03:01:39.063
             VERY WELL IN THE   
NEIGHBORHOOD TO HAVE A PARKING  
LOT ON THAT PARTICULAR          

03:01:39.065 --> 03:01:39.530
NEIGHBORHOOD TO HAVE A PARKING  
LOT ON THAT PARTICULAR          
LOCATION.                       

03:01:39.532 --> 03:01:40.531
LOT ON THAT PARTICULAR          
LOCATION.                       
SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS.       

03:01:40.533 --> 03:01:40.865
LOCATION.                       
SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS.       
YEAH.                           

03:01:40.867 --> 03:01:42.066
SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS.       
YEAH.                           
AND GETTING GETTING A LOT       

03:01:42.068 --> 03:01:43.000
YEAH.                           
AND GETTING GETTING A LOT       
OF CARS IN THERE WOULD WOULD BE 

03:01:43.002 --> 03:01:43.301
AND GETTING GETTING A LOT       
OF CARS IN THERE WOULD WOULD BE 
A REAL ISSUE.                   

03:01:43.303 --> 03:01:44.035
OF CARS IN THERE WOULD WOULD BE 
A REAL ISSUE.                   
SO THAT&amp;apos;S THE REASON WHY WE&amp;apos;RE  

03:01:44.037 --> 03:01:44.769
A REAL ISSUE.                   
SO THAT&amp;apos;S THE REASON WHY WE&amp;apos;RE  
WE&amp;apos;RE NOT PROPOSING TO BUILD A  

03:01:44.771 --> 03:01:45.936
SO THAT&amp;apos;S THE REASON WHY WE&amp;apos;RE  
WE&amp;apos;RE NOT PROPOSING TO BUILD A  
PARKING LOT BUT TALKING ABOUT   

03:01:45.938 --> 03:01:47.371

PARKING LOT BUT TALKING ABOUT   
PLAYGROUND SPACE, THERE WAS     

03:01:47.373 --> 03:01:48.072
PARKING LOT BUT TALKING ABOUT

03:01:49.909 --> 03:01:50.574
ALSO COMMENTS ABOUT THE         
POSSIBILITY OF LOOKING AT       
COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND WE    

03:01:50.576 --> 03:01:53.477
POSSIBILITY OF LOOKING AT       
COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND WE    
DID IN FACT LOOK AT COMMERCIAL  

03:01:53.479 --> 03:01:54.579
COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND WE    
DID IN FACT LOOK AT COMMERCIAL  
WHEN WE LOOKED AT QUITE A FEW   

03:01:54.581 --> 03:01:55.379
DID IN FACT LOOK AT COMMERCIAL  
WHEN WE LOOKED AT QUITE A FEW   
OF THEM AND UNIFORMLY WHAT WE   

03:01:55.381 --> 03:01:58.315
WHEN WE LOOKED AT QUITE A FEW   
OF THEM AND UNIFORMLY WHAT WE   
FOUND IS THAT WHILE THERE WAS   

03:01:58.317 --> 03:01:58.883
OF THEM AND UNIFORMLY WHAT WE   
FOUND IS THAT WHILE THERE WAS   
PLENTY OF SPACE AVAILABLE       

03:01:58.885 --> 03:02:01.852
FOUND IS THAT WHILE THERE WAS   
PLENTY OF SPACE AVAILABLE       
INDOORS, THEY ALMOST NEVER HAD  

03:02:01.854 --> 03:02:02.486
PLENTY OF SPACE AVAILABLE       
INDOORS, THEY ALMOST NEVER HAD  
OUTDOOR SPACE AND OUTDOOR SPACE

REDUCE THAT FIFTY COUNT AND IT  
ALSO DETERMINES THAT WHAT WALK

A SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS WITHIN A 
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
ONE OF THE THINGS THINKING      

03:44:55.125 --> 03:44:57.325
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
ONE OF THE THINGS THINKING      
ABOUT THE TRAFFIC LIMITS AND    

03:44:57.327 --> 03:44:58.059
ONE OF THE THINGS THINKING      
ABOUT THE TRAFFIC LIMITS AND    
THINGS OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE    

03:44:58.061 --> 03:45:01.062
ABOUT THE TRAFFIC LIMITS AND    
THINGS OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE    
ESPECIALLY WITH COVID YOU KNOW  

03:45:01.064 --> 03:45:02.063
THINGS OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE    
ESPECIALLY WITH COVID YOU KNOW  
,WE REALLY LOOKED AT HOME       

03:45:02.065 --> 03:45:05.300
ESPECIALLY WITH COVID YOU KNOW  
,WE REALLY LOOKED AT HOME       
OCCUPATION AND THE AMOUNT       

03:45:05.302 --> 03:45:06.100
,WE REALLY LOOKED AT HOME       
OCCUPATION AND THE AMOUNT       
OF TRAFFIC AND TRIPS ANY SINGLE 

03:45:06.102 --> 03:45:09.504
OCCUPATION AND THE AMOUNT       
OF TRAFFIC AND TRIPS ANY SINGLE 
HOME FOR PEOPLE WORKING THERE   

03:45:09.506 --> 03:45:10.238
OF TRAFFIC AND TRIPS ANY SINGLE 
HOME FOR PEOPLE WORKING THERE   
COULD HAVE BEEN ANY SINGLE      

03:45:10.240 --> 03:45:11.038
HOME FOR PEOPLE WORKING THERE   
COULD HAVE BEEN ANY SINGLE      
FAMILY HOME COULD HAVE UP TO    

03:45:11.040 --> 03:45:12.908
COULD HAVE BEEN ANY SINGLE      
FAMILY HOME COULD HAVE UP TO    
TWENTY FOUR VISITS PER DAY.

FAMILY HOME COULD HAVE UP TO    
TWENTY FOUR VISITS PER DAY.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF WE LOOK AT THIS        

03:45:14.177 --> 03:45:17.813
TWENTY FOUR VISITS PER DAY.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF WE LOOK AT THIS        
NEIGHBORHOOD, EVERY SINGLE ONE  

03:45:17.815 --> 03:45:18.547
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF WE LOOK AT THIS        
NEIGHBORHOOD, EVERY SINGLE ONE  
OF THESE HOMES COULD HAVE       

03:45:18.549 --> 03:45:21.149
NEIGHBORHOOD, EVERY SINGLE ONE  
OF THESE HOMES COULD HAVE       
TWENTY FOUR VISITS JUST BY

OF THESE HOMES COULD HAVE       
TWENTY FOUR VISITS JUST BY      
BEING AT HOME THERAPIST OR      

03:45:22.019 --> 03:45:24.719
TWENTY FOUR VISITS JUST BY      
BEING AT HOME THERAPIST OR      
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO WHEN 

03:45:24.721 --> 03:45:25.453
BEING AT HOME THERAPIST OR      
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO WHEN 
WE THINK ABOUT KIND OF THAT     

03:45:25.455 --> 03:45:26.254
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO WHEN 
WE THINK ABOUT KIND OF THAT     
RATIO THAT WE&amp;apos;RE UP TO FIFTY    

03:45:26.256 --> 03:45:29.858
WE THINK ABOUT KIND OF THAT     
RATIO THAT WE&amp;apos;RE UP TO FIFTY    
VISITS IF EVERYBODY IS DRIVING  

03:45:29.860 --> 03:45:32.226
RATIO THAT WE&amp;apos;RE UP TO FIFTY    
VISITS IF EVERYBODY IS DRIVING  
AND THINGS YES IT&amp;apos;S A SPECIAL   

03:45:32.228 --> 03:45:33.027
VISITS IF EVERYBODY IS DRIVING

ABOUT THESE THINGS PAIRED IN A  
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH SCHOOLS AND I 

03:45:44.974 --> 03:45:48.009
ABOUT THESE THINGS PAIRED IN A  
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH SCHOOLS AND I 
I SEE AND I WAS GUILTY          

03:45:48.011 --> 03:45:48.743
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH SCHOOLS AND I

OVER TO WHITE AT TIMES WHEN IT  

03:45:52.149 --> 03:45:53.014
SOMETIMES OF DRIVING MY KID     
OVER TO WHITE AT TIMES WHEN IT  
WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE      

03:45:53.016 --> 03:45:55.483
OVER TO WHITE AT TIMES WHEN IT  
WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE      
CONVENIENT.                     

03:45:55.485 --> 03:45:56.551

CONFIGURATION OF THE ROOM AND   
THEN IT CHANGES THE LICENSING   
REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT ROOM AND
