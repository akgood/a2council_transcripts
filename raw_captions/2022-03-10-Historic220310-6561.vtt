THE GARAGE IS UNIQUE AND IT&amp;apos;S   
IT&amp;apos;S A I THINK A GREAT SOLUTION 
TO A PROBLEM OF TRYING TO PUT A 

00:30:49.546 --> 00:30:52.280
IT&amp;apos;S A I THINK A GREAT SOLUTION 
TO A PROBLEM OF TRYING TO PUT A 
NEW BUILDING UP IN A FLOODWAY.  

00:30:52.282 --> 00:30:53.481
TO A PROBLEM OF TRYING TO PUT A 
NEW BUILDING UP IN A FLOODWAY.  
SO IN THE PAST WE&amp;apos;VE HAD A FEW  

00:30:53.483 --> 00:30:56.084
NEW BUILDING UP IN A FLOODWAY.  
SO IN THE PAST WE&amp;apos;VE HAD A FEW  
GARAGES COME THROUGH WHERE THEY 

00:30:56.086 --> 00:30:56.751
SO IN THE PAST WE&amp;apos;VE HAD A FEW  
GARAGES COME THROUGH WHERE THEY 
HAVE TO HAVE FLOOD GATES.       

00:30:56.753 --> 00:30:59.554
GARAGES COME THROUGH WHERE THEY 
HAVE TO HAVE FLOOD GATES.       
THEY USUALLY TAKE UP THE BOTTOM 

00:30:59.556 --> 00:31:00.721
HAVE TO HAVE FLOOD GATES.       
THEY USUALLY TAKE UP THE BOTTOM 
LIKE TWO FEET HERE AND AND THEY 

00:31:00.723 --> 00:31:06.628
THEY USUALLY TAKE UP THE BOTTOM 
LIKE TWO FEET HERE AND AND THEY 
OPEN                            

00:31:20.476 --> 00:31:22.744
     WHEN WATER PASSES THROUGH  
AND LET THE THE WATER FLOW      
THROUGH THE FLOW FREELY THROUGH 

00:31:22.746 --> 00:31:23.745
AND LET THE THE WATER FLOW      
THROUGH THE FLOW FREELY THROUGH 
THE BUILDING AND IN THIS CASE   

00:31:23.747 --> 00:31:24.813
THROUGH THE FLOW FREELY THROUGH 
THE BUILDING AND IN THIS CASE   
THEY PROPOSED TO USE ONE BY     

00:31:24.815 --> 00:31:25.614
THE BUILDING AND IN THIS CASE   
THEY PROPOSED TO USE ONE BY     
EIGHT VERTICAL BOARDS WITH WITH 

00:31:25.616 --> 00:31:26.414
THEY PROPOSED TO USE ONE BY     
EIGHT VERTICAL BOARDS WITH WITH

SO IT&amp;apos;S ESSENTIALLY MORE LIKE   
OPEN LIKE A FENCE WOULD BE      

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:29.250
SO IT&amp;apos;S ESSENTIALLY MORE LIKE

WHERE THAT EXACT UM DISTINCTION 
WAS BETWEEN EXISTING AND NEW ON 
THE DRIVEWAY SIDE WHERE THEY&amp;apos;RE

OF VISIBILITY BECAUSE THE HOUSE

BUT THE MAGAZINE&amp;apos;S GOT SIZE AND 
SCALE THAT THE ROOF HEIGHT IS   

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.822

OVERPOWERING LOOMING IN THE     
BACK AS WE MOVE TO THE BACK

START TO TO GET HIGHER AND I    
THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S THE           

01:00:37.699 --> 01:00:40.467
START TO TO GET HIGHER AND I    
THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S THE           
QUESTIONABLE PIECE FOR ME AND   

01:00:40.469 --> 01:00:41.134
THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S THE           
QUESTIONABLE PIECE FOR ME AND   
THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE THE ADDITIONAL     

01:00:41.136 --> 01:00:43.936
QUESTIONABLE PIECE FOR ME AND   
THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE THE ADDITIONAL     
FLOOR ALSO BECOMES QUESTIONABLE 

01:00:43.938 --> 01:00:44.905
THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE THE ADDITIONAL     
FLOOR ALSO BECOMES QUESTIONABLE 
FOR ME BECAUSE IF WE DIDN&amp;apos;T     

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:45.572
FLOOR ALSO BECOMES QUESTIONABLE 
FOR ME BECAUSE IF WE DIDN&amp;apos;T     
HAVE THE ADDITIONAL FLOOR AREA  

01:00:45.574 --> 01:00:48.474
FOR ME BECAUSE IF WE DIDN&amp;apos;T     
HAVE THE ADDITIONAL FLOOR AREA  
UP THERE, WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE 

01:00:48.476 --> 01:00:49.175
HAVE THE ADDITIONAL FLOOR AREA  
UP THERE, WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE 
HEIGHT ISSUE THAT WOULD BE      

01:00:49.177 --> 01:00:51.644
UP THERE, WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE 
HEIGHT ISSUE THAT WOULD BE      
BRINGING THIS AS AN ADDITIONAL  

01:00:51.646 --> 01:00:51.978
HEIGHT ISSUE THAT WOULD BE      
BRINGING THIS AS AN ADDITIONAL  
ISSUE.                          

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.749
BRINGING THIS AS AN ADDITIONAL  
ISSUE.                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S THE   

01:00:55.751 --> 01:00:58.284
ISSUE.                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S THE   
ONE PIECE THAT IS IS MY         

01:00:58.286 --> 01:01:02.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S THE   
ONE PIECE THAT IS IS MY         
STRUGGLE FROM IS JUST GOING TO  

01:01:02.857 --> 01:01:06.259
ONE PIECE THAT IS IS MY         
STRUGGLE FROM IS JUST GOING TO  
LOOK TO SEE IT NUMBER 10 SINCE  

01:01:06.261 --> 01:01:10.396
STRUGGLE FROM IS JUST GOING TO  
LOOK TO SEE IT NUMBER 10 SINCE  
I&amp;apos;M GOING THROUGH TO BE         

01:01:10.398 --> 01:01:11.131

I&amp;apos;M GOING THROUGH TO BE         
UNDERTAKEN IN SUCH A MANNER     

01:01:11.133 --> 01:01:13.834
I&amp;apos;M GOING THROUGH TO BE         
UNDERTAKEN IN SUCH A MANNER     
THAT IF REMOVED IN THE FUTURE   

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:14.768
UNDERTAKEN IN SUCH A MANNER     
THAT IF REMOVED IN THE FUTURE   
THE ESSENTIAL FOR THE INTEGRITY 

01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:15.568
THAT IF REMOVED IN THE FUTURE   
THE ESSENTIAL FOR THE INTEGRITY 
OF THE PROPERTY WOULD REMAIN I

01:01:17.639 --> 01:01:18.505
OF THE PROPERTY WOULD REMAIN I  
BELIEVE WE NEED THAT ONE.       
SO FOR THE MOST PART I THINK    

01:01:18.507 --> 01:01:19.172
BELIEVE WE NEED THAT ONE.       
SO FOR THE MOST PART I THINK

01:02:03.452 --> 01:02:09.623
SO THAT&amp;apos;S A QUESTION TO ASK

NOT?                            
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS IN THE  
NEIGHBORHOOD THEY MENTIONED     

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:29.009
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS IN THE  
NEIGHBORHOOD THEY MENTIONED     
THAT THEY HAD OTHER BUILDINGS   

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:29.809
NEIGHBORHOOD THEY MENTIONED     
THAT THEY HAD OTHER BUILDINGS   
AROUND THEM THAT WERE ALREADY   

01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:31.077
THAT THEY HAD OTHER BUILDINGS   
AROUND THEM THAT WERE ALREADY   
TALLER IN THAT BUILDING AND SO  

01:02:31.079 --> 01:02:31.677
AROUND THEM THAT WERE ALREADY   
TALLER IN THAT BUILDING AND SO  
CONSIDERED THE LOWEST.          

01:02:31.679 --> 01:02:32.546
TALLER IN THAT BUILDING AND SO  
CONSIDERED THE LOWEST.          
IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING TO BE TALLER     

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:33.246
CONSIDERED THE LOWEST.          
IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING TO BE TALLER     
THAN THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY  

01:02:33.248 --> 01:02:34.114
IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING TO BE TALLER     
THAN THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY  
EXISTING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.   

01:02:34.116 --> 01:02:35.114
THAN THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY  
EXISTING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.   
IT&amp;apos;S GOT YOU STILL GOING TO BE  

01:02:35.116 --> 01:02:37.250
EXISTING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.   
IT&amp;apos;S GOT YOU STILL GOING TO BE  
LOOKING DOWN AT THAT FROM IF I  

01:02:37.252 --> 01:02:39.853
IT&amp;apos;S GOT YOU STILL GOING TO BE  
LOOKING DOWN AT THAT FROM IF I  
MEAN ONE IN THAT HOUSE LOOKING  

01:02:39.855 --> 01:02:43.356
LOOKING DOWN AT THAT FROM IF I  
MEAN ONE IN THAT HOUSE LOOKING  
AT THEIR HOUSE.                 

01:02:43.358 --> 01:02:43.823
MEAN ONE IN THAT HOUSE LOOKING  
AT THEIR HOUSE.                 
I AGREE.                        

01:02:43.825 --> 01:02:46.092
AT THEIR HOUSE.                 
I AGREE.                        
I THINK THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD   

01:02:46.094 --> 01:02:50.997
I AGREE.                        
I THINK THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD   
CONTEXT WILL NOT BE A           

01:02:50.999 --> 01:02:51.898
I THINK THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD   
CONTEXT WILL NOT BE A           
DIMINISHED OR CHANGED IN ANY    

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.000
CONTEXT WILL NOT BE A           
DIMINISHED OR CHANGED IN ANY    
WAY BY THE ADDITION AND I&amp;apos;M     

01:02:54.002 --> 01:02:54.801
DIMINISHED OR CHANGED IN ANY    
WAY BY THE ADDITION AND I&amp;apos;M     
THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORIC     

01:02:54.803 --> 01:02:58.037
WAY BY THE ADDITION AND I&amp;apos;M     
THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORIC     
STRUCTURE ON THE PROPERTY       

01:02:58.039 --> 01:03:00.006
THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORIC     
STRUCTURE ON THE PROPERTY       
ITSELF KNOW WILL THAT BE        

01:03:00.008 --> 01:03:05.111
STRUCTURE ON THE PROPERTY       
ITSELF KNOW WILL THAT BE        
DIMINISHED?                     

01:03:05.113 --> 01:03:06.412
ITSELF KNOW WILL THAT BE        
DIMINISHED?                     
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S TO ME THE  

01:03:06.414 --> 01:03:09.048
DIMINISHED?                     
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S TO ME THE  
QUESTION THAT THAT&amp;apos;S A TOUGH    

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:12.785
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S TO ME THE  
QUESTION THAT THAT&amp;apos;S A TOUGH    
ONE ALMOST LEANING TOWARD IT.   

01:03:12.787 --> 01:03:16.823
QUESTION THAT THAT&amp;apos;S A TOUGH    
ONE ALMOST LEANING TOWARD IT.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WON&amp;apos;T BE BECAUSE OF HOW   

01:03:16.825 --> 01:03:20.293
ONE ALMOST LEANING TOWARD IT.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WON&amp;apos;T BE BECAUSE OF HOW   
MUCH OF THE HISTORIC BUILDING   

01:03:20.295 --> 01:03:21.161
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WON&amp;apos;T BE BECAUSE OF HOW   
MUCH OF THE HISTORIC BUILDING   
IS IS STILL PREVALENT AND       

01:03:21.163 --> 01:03:24.731
MUCH OF THE HISTORIC BUILDING   
IS IS STILL PREVALENT AND       
UNTOUCHED AND IT&amp;apos;S PRETTY FAR   

01:03:24.733 --> 01:03:25.064
IS IS STILL PREVALENT AND       
UNTOUCHED AND IT&amp;apos;S PRETTY FAR   
BACK.                           

01:03:25.066 --> 01:03:28.601
UNTOUCHED AND IT&amp;apos;S PRETTY FAR   
BACK.                           
IT WAS 40 FEET FROM THE PORCH   

01:03:28.603 --> 01:03:29.469
BACK.                           
IT WAS 40 FEET FROM THE PORCH   
AND THAT&amp;apos;S ANOTHER YOU KNOW, 10 

01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:30.403
IT WAS 40 FEET FROM THE PORCH   
AND THAT&amp;apos;S ANOTHER YOU KNOW, 10 
FEET OR SO FROM THE FRONT WALK. 

01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:35.041
AND THAT&amp;apos;S ANOTHER YOU KNOW, 10 
FEET OR SO FROM THE FRONT WALK. 
UM, IT&amp;apos;S HARD IT&amp;apos;S HARD TO      

01:03:35.043 --> 01:03:35.375
FEET OR SO FROM THE FRONT WALK. 
UM, IT&amp;apos;S HARD IT&amp;apos;S HARD TO      
VISUALIZE.                      

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:35.975
UM, IT&amp;apos;S HARD IT&amp;apos;S HARD TO      
VISUALIZE.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?               

01:03:35.977 --> 01:03:36.710
VISUALIZE.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?               
IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.    

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:43.283
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?               
IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.    
IT&amp;apos;S IN PLACE BUT               

01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:49.055
                  AND I DO      
THINK THE DESIGN IS PRETTY WELL 
CONSIDERED AS FAR AS HOW THAT   

01:03:49.057 --> 01:03:52.358
THINK THE DESIGN IS PRETTY WELL 
CONSIDERED AS FAR AS HOW THAT   
NEW ROOF WOULD INTERACT WITH    

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.225
CONSIDERED AS FAR AS HOW THAT   
NEW ROOF WOULD INTERACT WITH    
THE EXISTING ROOF IT CREATES    

01:03:53.227 --> 01:03:53.893
NEW ROOF WOULD INTERACT WITH    
THE EXISTING ROOF IT CREATES    
EVEN THOUGH WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE THE   

01:03:53.895 --> 01:03:56.429
THE EXISTING ROOF IT CREATES    
EVEN THOUGH WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE THE   
STUFF BACK LIKE WE WOULD        

01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:57.163
EVEN THOUGH WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE THE   
STUFF BACK LIKE WE WOULD        
NORMALLY LIKE TO SEE ON.        

01:03:57.165 --> 01:03:58.164
STUFF BACK LIKE WE WOULD        
NORMALLY LIKE TO SEE ON.        
IN ADDITION, IT GIVES A         

01:03:58.166 --> 01:03:59.899
NORMALLY LIKE TO SEE ON.        
IN ADDITION, IT GIVES A         
DISTINCT CHANGE AND PLAIN FROM  

01:03:59.901 --> 01:04:03.769
IN ADDITION, IT GIVES A         
DISTINCT CHANGE AND PLAIN FROM  
THE ORIGINAL ROOF AND I THINK   

01:04:03.771 --> 01:04:05.504
DISTINCT CHANGE AND PLAIN FROM  
THE ORIGINAL ROOF AND I THINK   
THE FOUNDATION IS DIFFERENT IN  

01:04:05.506 --> 01:04:11.611
THE ORIGINAL ROOF AND I THINK   
THE FOUNDATION IS DIFFERENT IN  
THAT PORTION                    

01:04:17.151 --> 01:04:25.491

IS IS THE ADDITION OF GARAGE    
AND THE ADDITIONAL HEIGHT GOING 
TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE IN      

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.373
AND THE ADDITIONAL HEIGHT GOING 
TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE IN

01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:17.177
TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE IN      
COMPARISON WITH THE THE HOUSE   
ITSELF THERE CAN BE AN ADDED    

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:20.246
COMPARISON WITH THE THE HOUSE   
ITSELF THERE CAN BE AN ADDED    
COMPONENT.                      

01:05:20.248 --> 01:05:23.849
ITSELF THERE CAN BE AN ADDED

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S I GOT TO SAY THIS IS AN 
APPLICATION THAT REALLY WOULD   

01:05:24.552 --> 01:05:27.687
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S I GOT TO SAY THIS IS AN 
APPLICATION THAT REALLY WOULD   
HAVE BENEFITED I THINK FROM A   

01:05:27.689 --> 01:05:28.487
APPLICATION THAT REALLY WOULD   
HAVE BENEFITED I THINK FROM A   
PERSPECTIVE DRAWING BECAUSE THE 

01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:32.125
HAVE BENEFITED I THINK FROM A   
PERSPECTIVE DRAWING BECAUSE THE 
ELEVATION DON&amp;apos;T PUT THAT UP     

01:05:32.127 --> 01:05:32.992
PERSPECTIVE DRAWING BECAUSE THE 
ELEVATION DON&amp;apos;T PUT THAT UP     
UNLESS YOU DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO DO THE 

01:05:32.994 --> 01:05:35.961
ELEVATION DON&amp;apos;T PUT THAT UP     
UNLESS YOU DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO DO THE 
PROJECT ANY FAVORS BECAUSE IT   

01:05:35.963 --> 01:05:36.396

IT&amp;apos;S NOT GOING TO LOOK TALL.    
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO     
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO DISAPPEAR HALF    

01:05:46.641 --> 01:05:47.574
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO     
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO DISAPPEAR HALF    
OF IT BEHIND THE HOUSE AND THEN 

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:51.344
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO DISAPPEAR HALF    
OF IT BEHIND THE HOUSE AND THEN 
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE LOWER THEN     

01:05:51.346 --> 01:05:55.881
OF IT BEHIND THE HOUSE AND THEN 
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE LOWER THEN     
THEN THE NEW ROOF AND IT SOUNDS 

01:05:55.883 --> 01:05:56.549
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE LOWER THEN     
THEN THE NEW ROOF AND IT SOUNDS 
LIKE IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE LOWER     

01:05:56.551 --> 01:05:58.618
THEN THE NEW ROOF AND IT SOUNDS 
LIKE IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE LOWER     
THAN THAN NEIGHBORING HOUSES.   

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:02.655
LIKE IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE LOWER

SO IT&amp;apos;S A TOUGH ONE TO TO       

01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:06.526
THAN THAN NEIGHBORING HOUSES.   
SO IT&amp;apos;S A TOUGH ONE TO TO       
VISUALIZE WITHOUT A DRY THANK

01:28:45.585 --> 01:28:47.752
RETAINING WALL.                 
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S PROPOSED.        
IT LOOKS LIKE IT&amp;apos;S AT A DECENT  

01:28:47.754 --> 01:28:48.153
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S PROPOSED.        
IT LOOKS LIKE IT&amp;apos;S AT A DECENT  
HEIGHT.                         

01:28:48.155 --> 01:28:48.886
IT LOOKS LIKE IT&amp;apos;S AT A DECENT  
HEIGHT.                         
THERE WERE OTHER HOUSES AROUND  

01:28:48.888 --> 01:28:52.024
HEIGHT.                         
THERE WERE OTHER HOUSES AROUND  
IN THE SAME AREA THAT ALSO HAVE 

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:52.624
THERE WERE OTHER HOUSES AROUND  
IN THE SAME AREA THAT ALSO HAVE 
RETAINING WALLS.                

01:28:52.626 --> 01:28:55.960
IN THE SAME AREA THAT ALSO HAVE 
RETAINING WALLS.                
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE&amp;apos;VE SEEN THESE ON A FEW    

01:28:55.962 --> 01:28:56.694
RETAINING WALLS.                
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE&amp;apos;VE SEEN THESE ON A FEW    
PROPERTIES JUST IN THE FRONT    

01:28:56.696 --> 01:28:57.028
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE&amp;apos;VE SEEN THESE ON A FEW    
PROPERTIES JUST IN THE FRONT    
YARD.                           

01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:59.797
PROPERTIES JUST IN THE FRONT    
YARD.                           
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS GOING TO 

01:28:59.799 --> 01:29:00.732
YARD.                           
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS GOING TO 
BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BUFFER IN  

01:29:00.734 --> 01:29:03.301
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS GOING TO 
BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BUFFER IN  
BETWEEN THE RETAINING WALL AND  

01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:03.669
BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BUFFER IN  
BETWEEN THE RETAINING WALL AND  
THE SIDEWALK.                   

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:06.771
BETWEEN THE RETAINING WALL AND  
THE SIDEWALK.                   
SO A PLANTING BUFFER UM I THINK 

01:29:06.773 --> 01:29:10.441
THE SIDEWALK.                   
SO A PLANTING BUFFER UM I THINK 
WAS THE ONLY KIND OF QUESTIONS  

01:29:10.443 --> 01:29:11.176
SO A PLANTING BUFFER UM I THINK 
WAS THE ONLY KIND OF QUESTIONS  
OR COMMENTS WE DISCUSSED WAS    

01:29:11.178 --> 01:29:14.379
WAS THE ONLY KIND OF QUESTIONS  
OR COMMENTS WE DISCUSSED WAS

PATIO BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM TO   

01:29:15.382 --> 01:29:18.016
WHAT IS THE SURFACE OF THAT     
PATIO BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM TO   
TAKE UP QUITE A BIT OF THE      

01:29:18.018 --> 01:29:18.850
PATIO BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM TO   
TAKE UP QUITE A BIT OF THE      
FRONT YARD SPACE AND THAT WAS   

01:29:18.852 --> 01:29:21.886
TAKE UP QUITE A BIT OF THE      
FRONT YARD SPACE AND THAT WAS

01:31:10.997 --> 01:31:13.931
AND GO OVER THERE WE CAN OK     
WELL OBVIOUSLY I BELIEVE JOEL   
SHOWED THIS THIS AREA WHICH YOU 

01:31:13.933 --> 01:31:14.733
WELL OBVIOUSLY I BELIEVE JOEL   
SHOWED THIS THIS AREA WHICH YOU 
KNOW HAD PASSED AND WHAT IT IS  

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:18.002
SHOWED THIS THIS AREA WHICH YOU 
KNOW HAD PASSED AND WHAT IT IS  
NOW VERSUS WHAT NEST IN MARCH   

01:31:18.004 --> 01:31:22.306
KNOW HAD PASSED AND WHAT IT IS  
NOW VERSUS WHAT NEST IN MARCH   
OF TWENTY TWENTY GET THAT WE WE 

01:31:22.308 --> 01:31:25.910
NOW VERSUS WHAT NEST IN MARCH   
OF TWENTY TWENTY GET THAT WE WE 
REALLY DID WHEN THE SUGGESTION  

01:31:25.912 --> 01:31:28.379
OF TWENTY TWENTY GET THAT WE WE 
REALLY DID WHEN THE SUGGESTION  
WAS MADE TO GET RID OF THE      

01:31:28.381 --> 01:31:28.780
REALLY DID WHEN THE SUGGESTION  
WAS MADE TO GET RID OF THE      
GARBAGE.                        

01:31:28.782 --> 01:31:29.780
WAS MADE TO GET RID OF THE      
GARBAGE.                        
WELL THE ONLY REASON I WAS      

01:31:29.782 --> 01:31:32.617
GARBAGE.                        
WELL THE ONLY REASON I WAS      
THERE IS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE  

01:31:32.619 --> 01:31:33.551
WELL THE ONLY REASON I WAS      
THERE IS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE  
HAD TO ENTER FROM THE FRONT     

01:31:33.553 --> 01:31:36.888
THERE IS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE  
HAD TO ENTER FROM THE FRONT     
OF THE DRIVEWAY WHICH THE GOES  

01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:39.990
HAD TO ENTER FROM THE FRONT     
OF THE DRIVEWAY WHICH THE GOES  
UP KIND OF THE THE FOLLOWING IN 

01:31:39.992 --> 01:31:40.592
OF THE DRIVEWAY WHICH THE GOES  
UP KIND OF THE THE FOLLOWING IN 
TWO DIRECTIONS HERE.            

01:31:40.594 --> 01:31:41.526
UP KIND OF THE THE FOLLOWING IN 
TWO DIRECTIONS HERE.            
SO IT&amp;apos;S FALLING DOWN AS YOU GO  

01:31:41.528 --> 01:31:44.195
TWO DIRECTIONS HERE.            
SO IT&amp;apos;S FALLING DOWN AS YOU GO  
DOWN THE SIDEWALK AND IT&amp;apos;S      

01:31:44.197 --> 01:31:45.062
SO IT&amp;apos;S FALLING DOWN AS YOU GO  
DOWN THE SIDEWALK AND IT&amp;apos;S      
FALLING AS YOU COME DOWN THE    

01:31:45.064 --> 01:31:47.665
DOWN THE SIDEWALK AND IT&amp;apos;S      
FALLING AS YOU COME DOWN THE    
DRIVEWAY.                       

01:31:47.667 --> 01:31:48.800
FALLING AS YOU COME DOWN THE    
DRIVEWAY.                       
SO I THINK IN SOME WAYS THIS    

01:31:48.802 --> 01:31:52.303
DRIVEWAY.                       
SO I THINK IN SOME WAYS THIS    
DRIVEWAY ON THE RIGHT MIGHT BE  

01:31:52.305 --> 01:31:53.038
SO I THINK IN SOME WAYS THIS    
DRIVEWAY ON THE RIGHT MIGHT BE  
A LITTLE DECEIVING AS THAT IT   

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.040
DRIVEWAY ON THE RIGHT MIGHT BE  
A LITTLE DECEIVING AS THAT IT   
LOOKS DEEPER THAN IT PROBABLY   

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:55.507
A LITTLE DECEIVING AS THAT IT   
LOOKS DEEPER THAN IT PROBABLY   
WOULD BE.                       

01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:56.273
LOOKS DEEPER THAN IT PROBABLY   
WOULD BE.                       
BUT THAT&amp;apos;S MOSTLY BECAUSE WE    

01:31:56.275 --> 01:31:59.044
WOULD BE.                       
BUT THAT&amp;apos;S MOSTLY BECAUSE WE    
WERE COMING FROM THE DRIVEWAY   

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:03.415
BUT THAT&amp;apos;S MOSTLY BECAUSE WE    
WERE COMING FROM THE DRIVEWAY   
SIDE AND AND WE JUST WE HAD TO  

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:04.081
WERE COMING FROM THE DRIVEWAY   
SIDE AND AND WE JUST WE HAD TO  
ABIDE WITH THE                  

01:32:04.083 --> 01:32:06.684
SIDE AND AND WE JUST WE HAD TO  
ABIDE WITH THE                  
CODE REQUIREMENTS.              

01:32:06.686 --> 01:32:07.686
ABIDE WITH THE                  
CODE REQUIREMENTS.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE HAD A GUARDRAIL OVER   

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:10.521
CODE REQUIREMENTS.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE HAD A GUARDRAIL OVER   
30 OVER 30 INCHES TALL.         

01:32:10.523 --> 01:32:11.789
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE HAD A GUARDRAIL OVER   
30 OVER 30 INCHES TALL.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT NONETHELESS WHEN WE CAME 

01:32:11.791 --> 01:32:15.293
30 OVER 30 INCHES TALL.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT NONETHELESS WHEN WE CAME 
BACK SHANNON RANDALL SAID I     

01:32:15.295 --> 01:32:17.695
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT NONETHELESS WHEN WE CAME 
BACK SHANNON RANDALL SAID I     
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MYSELF GOT     

01:32:17.697 --> 01:32:18.563
BACK SHANNON RANDALL SAID I     
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MYSELF GOT     
TOGETHER AND SAID, YOU KNOW,    

01:32:18.565 --> 01:32:19.163
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MYSELF GOT     
TOGETHER AND SAID, YOU KNOW,    
WHAT CAN WE DO?                 

01:32:19.165 --> 01:32:22.299
TOGETHER AND SAID, YOU KNOW,    
WHAT CAN WE DO?                 
AND IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO HOW  

01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:23.234
WHAT CAN WE DO?                 
AND IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO HOW  
DO WE GET TO THE POINT OF BEING 

01:32:23.236 --> 01:32:25.970
AND IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO HOW  
DO WE GET TO THE POINT OF BEING 
ABLE TO TRAVERSE AROUND DOWN TO 

01:32:25.972 --> 01:32:29.607
DO WE GET TO THE POINT OF BEING 
ABLE TO TRAVERSE AROUND DOWN TO 
THE TO THE TO THE UNDERGROUND   

01:32:29.609 --> 01:32:30.007
ABLE TO TRAVERSE AROUND DOWN TO 
THE TO THE TO THE UNDERGROUND   
PART.                           

01:32:30.009 --> 01:32:33.478
THE TO THE TO THE UNDERGROUND   
PART.                           
THE THE COMMISSIONERS HAD ASKED 

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.546
PART.                           
THE THE COMMISSIONERS HAD ASKED 
US TO REMOVE THE STAIR OR MOVE  

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:37.615
THE THE COMMISSIONERS HAD ASKED 
US TO REMOVE THE STAIR OR MOVE  
THE STAIRS TO NO FURTHER THAN   

01:32:37.617 --> 01:32:38.416
US TO REMOVE THE STAIR OR MOVE  
THE STAIRS TO NO FURTHER THAN   
THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING      

01:32:38.418 --> 01:32:41.919
THE STAIRS TO NO FURTHER THAN   
THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING      
WHICH IS SORT WHERE YOU SEE     

01:32:41.921 --> 01:32:42.686
THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING      
WHICH IS SORT WHERE YOU SEE     
THAT HANDRAIL RETURN ON THE     

01:32:42.688 --> 01:32:46.524
WHICH IS SORT WHERE YOU SEE     
THAT HANDRAIL RETURN ON THE     
LEFT AND THEN ALSO TO GET RID   

01:32:46.526 --> 01:32:48.726
THAT HANDRAIL RETURN ON THE     
LEFT AND THEN ALSO TO GET RID   
OF THE HANDRAIL.                

01:32:48.728 --> 01:32:49.761
LEFT AND THEN ALSO TO GET RID   
OF THE HANDRAIL.                
SO WE WERE KIND OF EXCITED      

01:32:49.763 --> 01:32:50.562
OF THE HANDRAIL.                
SO WE WERE KIND OF EXCITED      
ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE NOT ONLY    

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:52.897
SO WE WERE KIND OF EXCITED      
ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE NOT ONLY    
MOVED THE STAIRS ALL THE WAY,   

01:32:52.899 --> 01:32:53.765
ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE NOT ONLY    
MOVED THE STAIRS ALL THE WAY,   
WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO MOVE   

01:32:53.767 --> 01:32:57.301
MOVED THE STAIRS ALL THE WAY,   
WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO MOVE   
THEM ALL THE WAY TO THE TO THE  

01:32:57.303 --> 01:32:59.737
WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO MOVE   
THEM ALL THE WAY TO THE TO THE  
PORCH AND SO THEY&amp;apos;RE COMPLETELY 

01:32:59.739 --> 01:33:00.805
THEM ALL THE WAY TO THE TO THE  
PORCH AND SO THEY&amp;apos;RE COMPLETELY 
HIDDEN AND THERE IS NO HANDRAIL 

01:33:00.807 --> 01:33:04.008
PORCH AND SO THEY&amp;apos;RE COMPLETELY 
HIDDEN AND THERE IS NO HANDRAIL 
NOW ON IT ALSO SOME OTHER       

01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:04.743
HIDDEN AND THERE IS NO HANDRAIL 
NOW ON IT ALSO SOME OTHER

BIT OF OUTDOOR SPACE THAT HELPS 
WITH THE LIVING BUILDING

NATURAL AREAS AROUND WHERE ALL  
THE THINGS THAT HAD DONE IN HER 
PART OF THE DESIGN IS TO        

01:33:39.846 --> 01:33:40.544
THE THINGS THAT HAD DONE IN HER 
PART OF THE DESIGN IS TO        
INCORPORATE QUITE A BIT         

01:33:40.546 --> 01:33:41.245
PART OF THE DESIGN IS TO        
INCORPORATE QUITE A BIT         
OF LANDSCAPING AROUND WHICH ALL 

01:33:41.247 --> 01:33:42.046
INCORPORATE QUITE A BIT         
OF LANDSCAPING AROUND WHICH ALL 
OF WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE     

01:33:42.048 --> 01:33:42.780
OF LANDSCAPING AROUND WHICH ALL 
OF WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE     
PROGRAM DETAILS BUT KIND        

01:33:42.782 --> 01:33:43.448
OF WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE     
PROGRAM DETAILS BUT KIND        
OF BEING SENSITIVE TO THE FACT  

01:33:43.450 --> 01:33:45.983
PROGRAM DETAILS BUT KIND        
OF BEING SENSITIVE TO THE FACT  
THAT WE NEEDED TO KIND          

01:33:45.985 --> 01:33:46.917
OF BEING SENSITIVE TO THE FACT  
THAT WE NEEDED TO KIND          
OF SHIELD THAT AREA AND MAKE IT 

01:33:46.919 --> 01:33:49.954
THAT WE NEEDED TO KIND          
OF SHIELD THAT AREA AND MAKE IT 
MAKE IT WORK.                   

01:33:49.956 --> 01:33:50.888
OF SHIELD THAT AREA AND MAKE IT 
MAKE IT WORK.                   
THE NORTHERN PART, YOU KNOW,    

01:33:50.890 --> 01:33:54.092
MAKE IT WORK.                   
THE NORTHERN PART, YOU KNOW,    
GOING NORTH FROM THE PORCH IS   

01:33:54.094 --> 01:33:54.759
THE NORTHERN PART, YOU KNOW,    
GOING NORTH FROM THE PORCH IS   
IS ARE EXTENSIVELY LANDSCAPE    

01:33:54.761 --> 01:33:57.428
GOING NORTH FROM THE PORCH IS   
IS ARE EXTENSIVELY LANDSCAPE    
ACTUALLY THIS PART THERE IS TO  

01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:58.096
IS ARE EXTENSIVELY LANDSCAPE    
ACTUALLY THIS PART THERE IS TO  
IT IT&amp;apos;S GOT TO BUFFER PRETTY    

01:33:58.098 --> 01:34:00.932
ACTUALLY THIS PART THERE IS TO  
IT IT&amp;apos;S GOT TO BUFFER PRETTY    
MUCH ALL THE WAY AROUND EXCEPT  

01:34:00.934 --> 01:34:01.699
IT IT&amp;apos;S GOT TO BUFFER PRETTY    
MUCH ALL THE WAY AROUND EXCEPT  
FOR THE ACTUAL WALKWAY.         

01:34:01.701 --> 01:34:05.436
MUCH ALL THE WAY AROUND EXCEPT  
FOR THE ACTUAL WALKWAY.         
I ALSO WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A 

01:34:05.438 --> 01:34:06.137
FOR THE ACTUAL WALKWAY.         
I ALSO WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A 
TOTAL OF NINE FEET FROM THE     

01:34:06.139 --> 01:34:08.806
I ALSO WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A 
TOTAL OF NINE FEET FROM THE     
FRONT OF THE PORCH TO THE START 

01:34:08.808 --> 01:34:09.373
TOTAL OF NINE FEET FROM THE     
FRONT OF THE PORCH TO THE START 
OF THE LANDSCAPING.             

01:34:09.375 --> 01:34:13.177
FRONT OF THE PORCH TO THE START 
OF THE LANDSCAPING.             
SO IT&amp;apos;S A PRETTY SMALL AREA TO  

01:34:13.179 --> 01:34:13.578
OF THE LANDSCAPING.             
SO IT&amp;apos;S A PRETTY SMALL AREA TO  
BEGIN WITH.                     

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:17.448
SO IT&amp;apos;S A PRETTY SMALL AREA TO  
BEGIN WITH.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE SORT IDEALS AND THAT WAS 

01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:18.183
BEGIN WITH.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE SORT IDEALS AND THAT WAS 
TO BORROW FROM THE CHURCH UP    

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:20.819
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE SORT IDEALS AND THAT WAS 
TO BORROW FROM THE CHURCH UP    
THE STREET.                     

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:21.753
TO BORROW FROM THE CHURCH UP    
THE STREET.                     
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO HAVE SOME CUTS   

01:34:21.755 --> 01:34:25.055
THE STREET.                     
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO HAVE SOME CUTS   
DOWN FROM THE ACTUAL PROJECT.   

01:34:25.057 --> 01:34:26.024
WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO HAVE SOME CUTS   
DOWN FROM THE ACTUAL PROJECT.   
THE FOUNDATION IS 100 PERCENT   

01:34:26.026 --> 01:34:29.560
DOWN FROM THE ACTUAL PROJECT.   
THE FOUNDATION IS 100 PERCENT   
SUNK INTO THE GROUND RIGHT NOW  

01:34:29.562 --> 01:34:30.294
THE FOUNDATION IS 100 PERCENT   
SUNK INTO THE GROUND RIGHT NOW  
BUT THERE IS AN AREA IN THE     

01:34:30.296 --> 01:34:32.096
SUNK INTO THE GROUND RIGHT NOW  
BUT THERE IS AN AREA IN THE     
REAR THAT HAS SOME CUT STONES.  

01:34:32.098 --> 01:34:33.063
BUT THERE IS AN AREA IN THE     
REAR THAT HAS SOME CUT STONES.  
WE SHOULD BE VERY NICE TO REUSE 

01:34:33.065 --> 01:34:36.300
REAR THAT HAS SOME CUT STONES.  
WE SHOULD BE VERY NICE TO REUSE 
THAT ON THE SITE AND THEN AND   

01:34:36.302 --> 01:34:37.268
WE SHOULD BE VERY NICE TO REUSE 
THAT ON THE SITE AND THEN AND   
DO A NICE MASONRY WALL LIKE YOU 

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:40.505
THAT ON THE SITE AND THEN AND   
DO A NICE MASONRY WALL LIKE YOU 
SEE IT AT ST ANDREW&amp;apos;S CHURCH    

01:34:40.507 --> 01:34:43.741
DO A NICE MASONRY WALL LIKE YOU 
SEE IT AT ST ANDREW&amp;apos;S CHURCH    
AND THE OTHER THING WAS JUST    

01:34:43.743 --> 01:34:44.942
SEE IT AT ST ANDREW&amp;apos;S CHURCH    
AND THE OTHER THING WAS JUST    
THESE LITTLE AREAS TO CLOSE OFF 

01:34:44.944 --> 01:34:47.846
AND THE OTHER THING WAS JUST    
THESE LITTLE AREAS TO CLOSE OFF 
OF THE OFF OF THE SIDEWALK KIND 

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:48.579
THESE LITTLE AREAS TO CLOSE OFF 
OF THE OFF OF THE SIDEWALK KIND 
OF A TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN    

01:34:48.581 --> 01:34:51.816
OF THE OFF OF THE SIDEWALK KIND 
OF A TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN    
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPHERES AND  

01:34:51.818 --> 01:34:54.685
OF A TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN    
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPHERES AND  
ALSO, YOU KNOW, BEING THAT THAT 

01:34:54.687 --> 01:34:55.453
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPHERES AND  
ALSO, YOU KNOW, BEING THAT THAT 
THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION HAS    

01:34:55.455 --> 01:34:59.090
ALSO, YOU KNOW, BEING THAT THAT 
THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION HAS    
SOME TERRAIN CHANGES TOO.       

01:34:59.092 --> 01:35:02.594
THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION HAS    
SOME TERRAIN CHANGES TOO.       
SO WITH SORT OF THE LOWER AREAS 

01:35:02.596 --> 01:35:03.861
SOME TERRAIN CHANGES TOO.       
SO WITH SORT OF THE LOWER AREAS 
GOING DOWN INTO, YOU KNOW, SORT 

01:35:03.863 --> 01:35:06.730
SO WITH SORT OF THE LOWER AREAS 
GOING DOWN INTO, YOU KNOW, SORT 
OF REMOTE AREAS VERSUS GOING    

01:35:06.732 --> 01:35:07.799
GOING DOWN INTO, YOU KNOW, SORT 
OF REMOTE AREAS VERSUS GOING    
KIND OF UP INTO THE THE THE     

01:35:07.801 --> 01:35:10.435
OF REMOTE AREAS VERSUS GOING    
KIND OF UP INTO THE THE THE     
CHURCH ITSELF KIND OF THE THE   

01:35:10.437 --> 01:35:13.838
KIND OF UP INTO THE THE THE     
CHURCH ITSELF KIND OF THE THE   
THINGS THAT WE WE USED TO CALL  

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.176
CHURCH ITSELF KIND OF THE THE   
THINGS THAT WE WE USED TO CALL  
ON TO TO HELP THIS DESIGN UM I  

01:35:18.178 --> 01:35:19.143
THINGS THAT WE WE USED TO CALL  
ON TO TO HELP THIS DESIGN UM I  
THINK JUST SHOWED YOU THIS      

01:35:19.145 --> 01:35:22.012
ON TO TO HELP THIS DESIGN UM I  
THINK JUST SHOWED YOU THIS      
SLIDE.                          

01:35:22.014 --> 01:35:23.214
THINK JUST SHOWED YOU THIS      
SLIDE.                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO YEAH WE ARE IT IS TWO     

01:35:23.216 --> 01:35:25.683
SLIDE.                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO YEAH WE ARE IT IS TWO     
RISERS DOWN TO TWO THE THE      

01:35:25.685 --> 01:35:29.320
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO YEAH WE ARE IT IS TWO     
RISERS DOWN TO TWO THE THE      
SUNKEN AREA THERE THAT IS A     

01:35:29.322 --> 01:35:30.121
RISERS DOWN TO TWO THE THE      
SUNKEN AREA THERE THAT IS A     
TOTAL OF NINE FEET FROM THE     

01:35:30.123 --> 01:35:33.357
SUNKEN AREA THERE THAT IS A     
TOTAL OF NINE FEET FROM THE     
HOUSE TO THE TO THE FRONT.      

01:35:33.359 --> 01:35:36.795
TOTAL OF NINE FEET FROM THE     
HOUSE TO THE TO THE FRONT.      
SO AGAIN NOT A HUGE AREA BUT A  

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:37.662
HOUSE TO THE TO THE FRONT.      
SO AGAIN NOT A HUGE AREA BUT A  
LITTLE MORE GENEROUS THAN IF    

01:35:37.664 --> 01:35:39.964
SO AGAIN NOT A HUGE AREA BUT A  
LITTLE MORE GENEROUS THAN IF    
YOU JUST HAD TO MAKE A PATHWAY  

01:35:39.966 --> 01:35:40.164
LITTLE MORE GENEROUS THAN IF    
YOU JUST HAD TO MAKE A PATHWAY  
.                               

01:35:40.166 --> 01:35:41.099
YOU JUST HAD TO MAKE A PATHWAY  
.                               
THERE IS REALLY NO WAY TO GET   

01:35:41.101 --> 01:35:43.868
.                               
THERE IS REALLY NO WAY TO GET   
TO THE POINT OF NOT NEEDING A   

01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:44.802
THERE IS REALLY NO WAY TO GET   
TO THE POINT OF NOT NEEDING A   
HANDRAIL SOMEWHERE UNLESS WE AT 

01:35:44.804 --> 01:35:45.436
TO THE POINT OF NOT NEEDING A   
HANDRAIL SOMEWHERE UNLESS WE AT 
LEAST BROUGHT THIS DOWN.        

01:35:45.438 --> 01:35:48.439
HANDRAIL SOMEWHERE UNLESS WE AT 
LEAST BROUGHT THIS DOWN.        
SO WE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO THE    

01:35:48.441 --> 01:35:49.207
LEAST BROUGHT THIS DOWN.        
SO WE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO THE    
MINIMUM AMOUNT WE COULD TO BE   

01:35:49.209 --> 01:35:49.974
SO WE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO THE    
MINIMUM AMOUNT WE COULD TO BE   
ABLE TO LOSE THE HANDRAIL       

01:35:49.976 --> 01:35:54.645
MINIMUM AMOUNT WE COULD TO BE   
ABLE TO LOSE THE HANDRAIL       
ENTIRELY, DESIGN THE SURFACE    

01:35:54.647 --> 01:36:01.952
ABLE TO LOSE THE HANDRAIL       
ENTIRELY, DESIGN THE SURFACE    
BELOW TO BE A EXPOSED CON       

01:36:01.954 --> 01:36:02.319
ENTIRELY, DESIGN THE SURFACE    
BELOW TO BE A EXPOSED CON       
CONCRETE.                       

01:36:02.321 --> 01:36:06.391
BELOW TO BE A EXPOSED CON       
CONCRETE.                       
I TYPICALLY HAVE USED THAT FOR  

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:07.124
CONCRETE.                       
I TYPICALLY HAVE USED THAT FOR  
SORT OF OUTDOOR AREAS WHERE     

01:36:07.126 --> 01:36:10.594
I TYPICALLY HAVE USED THAT FOR  
SORT OF OUTDOOR AREAS WHERE     
STALIN OR PATIO PAVERS AREN&amp;apos;T   

01:36:10.596 --> 01:36:10.829
SORT OF OUTDOOR AREAS WHERE     
STALIN OR PATIO PAVERS AREN&amp;apos;T   
USED.                           

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:11.629
STALIN OR PATIO PAVERS AREN&amp;apos;T   
USED.                           
THE REASON I LIKE IT ESPECIALLY 

01:36:11.631 --> 01:36:14.432
USED.                           
THE REASON I LIKE IT ESPECIALLY 
IN THIS CONTEXT IS THAT WE USE  

01:36:14.434 --> 01:36:14.699
THE REASON I LIKE IT ESPECIALLY 
IN THIS CONTEXT IS THAT WE USE  
IT.                             

01:36:14.701 --> 01:36:18.036
IN THIS CONTEXT IS THAT WE USE  
IT.                             
IT IS A GRANITE PISTONE FINE    

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:21.872
IT.                             
IT IS A GRANITE PISTONE FINE    
STONE PEBBLES AND ONCE YOU WASH 

01:36:21.874 --> 01:36:22.807
IT IS A GRANITE PISTONE FINE    
STONE PEBBLES AND ONCE YOU WASH 
THE CREME CONCRETE CREAM OFF    

01:36:22.809 --> 01:36:26.678
STONE PEBBLES AND ONCE YOU WASH 
THE CREME CONCRETE CREAM OFF    
AND OIL THOSE PEBBLES THEY LOOK 

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.114
THE CREME CONCRETE CREAM OFF    
AND OIL THOSE PEBBLES THEY LOOK 
LIKE THEY&amp;apos;RE THE SAME MATERIAL  

01:36:30.116 --> 01:36:31.048
AND OIL THOSE PEBBLES THEY LOOK 
LIKE THEY&amp;apos;RE THE SAME MATERIAL  
AS THE GRANITE OF THE BLOCK.    

01:36:31.050 --> 01:36:32.282
LIKE THEY&amp;apos;RE THE SAME MATERIAL  
AS THE GRANITE OF THE BLOCK.    
SO YOU GET THAT KIND OF A NICE  

01:36:32.284 --> 01:36:34.585
AS THE GRANITE OF THE BLOCK.    
SO YOU GET THAT KIND OF A NICE  
COLORFUL SURFACE VERY EARLY IN  

01:36:34.587 --> 01:36:38.288
SO YOU GET THAT KIND OF A NICE  
COLORFUL SURFACE VERY EARLY IN  
TONE AND TEXTURE WHICH I        

01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:39.022
COLORFUL SURFACE VERY EARLY IN  
TONE AND TEXTURE WHICH I        
THOUGHT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT   

01:36:39.024 --> 01:36:41.992
TONE AND TEXTURE WHICH I        
THOUGHT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT   
WITH WITH THE STONE WHICH       

01:36:41.994 --> 01:36:42.560
THOUGHT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT   
WITH WITH THE STONE WHICH       
MULTICOLORED STONE.             

01:36:42.562 --> 01:36:45.229
WITH WITH THE STONE WHICH       
MULTICOLORED STONE.             
SO YOU KIND OF MULTICOLOR       

01:36:45.231 --> 01:36:49.066
MULTICOLORED STONE.             
SO YOU KIND OF MULTICOLOR       
EFFECT IN THE STONE ITSELF BUT  

01:36:49.068 --> 01:36:49.934
SO YOU KIND OF MULTICOLOR       
EFFECT IN THE STONE ITSELF BUT  
THAT&amp;apos;S JUST KIND OF WHAT WE     

01:36:49.936 --> 01:36:53.871
EFFECT IN THE STONE ITSELF BUT  
THAT&amp;apos;S JUST KIND OF WHAT WE     
CAME UP WITH IS THE DESIGN TEAM 

01:36:53.873 --> 01:36:54.605
THAT&amp;apos;S JUST KIND OF WHAT WE     
CAME UP WITH IS THE DESIGN TEAM 
AND THOUGHT THAT WOULD LOOK     

01:36:54.607 --> 01:36:57.408
CAME UP WITH IS THE DESIGN TEAM 
AND THOUGHT THAT WOULD LOOK     
NICE THERE IS THIS AREA DOES    

01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:58.075
AND THOUGHT THAT WOULD LOOK     
NICE THERE IS THIS AREA DOES    
NOT WORK ON THE SITE.           

01:36:58.077 --> 01:37:00.644
NICE THERE IS THIS AREA DOES    
NOT WORK ON THE SITE.           
THERE IS A PART IN THE BACK     

01:37:00.646 --> 01:37:04.047
NOT WORK ON THE SITE.           
THERE IS A PART IN THE BACK     
THAT DOES SO WE ARE REQUIRED TO 

01:37:04.049 --> 01:37:07.985
THERE IS A PART IN THE BACK     
THAT DOES SO WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
HAVE A DRAIN IN THIS IN THIS    

01:37:07.987 --> 01:37:09.087
THAT DOES SO WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
HAVE A DRAIN IN THIS IN THIS    
AREA THAT THAT GOES OUT TO THE  

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:12.557
HAVE A DRAIN IN THIS IN THIS    
AREA THAT THAT GOES OUT TO THE  
DRIVEWAY WITH THE DRAIN THAT    

01:37:12.559 --> 01:37:16.059
AREA THAT THAT GOES OUT TO THE  
DRIVEWAY WITH THE DRAIN THAT    
COMES DOWN.                     

01:37:16.061 --> 01:37:17.094
DRIVEWAY WITH THE DRAIN THAT    
COMES DOWN.                     
SO THERE&amp;apos;S THIS AND A SMALL     

01:37:17.096 --> 01:37:19.763
COMES DOWN.                     
SO THERE&amp;apos;S THIS AND A SMALL     
AREA OF THE DRIVEWAY GO INTO    

01:37:19.765 --> 01:37:20.798
SO THERE&amp;apos;S THIS AND A SMALL     
AREA OF THE DRIVEWAY GO INTO    
THE STORM CELLAR WHICH IS RIGHT 

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.532
AREA OF THE DRIVEWAY GO INTO    
THE STORM CELLAR WHICH IS RIGHT 
AT THE EDGE OF THE PROPERTY     

01:37:21.534 --> 01:37:23.601
THE STORM CELLAR WHICH IS RIGHT 
AT THE EDGE OF THE PROPERTY     
THERE AND THEN ABOUT 90 TO 95   

01:37:23.603 --> 01:37:27.004
AT THE EDGE OF THE PROPERTY     
THERE AND THEN ABOUT 90 TO 95   
PERCENT OF THE WATER THAT FALLS 

01:37:27.006 --> 01:37:28.006
THERE AND THEN ABOUT 90 TO 95   
PERCENT OF THE WATER THAT FALLS 
ON THE SITE ACTUALLY WILL BE    

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:28.739
PERCENT OF THE WATER THAT FALLS 
ON THE SITE ACTUALLY WILL BE    
INFILTRATED IN THE BACK.        

01:37:28.741 --> 01:37:31.709
ON THE SITE ACTUALLY WILL BE    
INFILTRATED IN THE BACK.        
SO THIS AREA IS JUST A LITTLE   

01:37:31.711 --> 01:37:32.310
INFILTRATED IN THE BACK.        
SO THIS AREA IS JUST A LITTLE   
TOO LOW FOR THAT.               

01:37:32.312 --> 01:37:35.313
SO THIS AREA IS JUST A LITTLE   
TOO LOW FOR THAT.               
BUT IT&amp;apos;S A IT&amp;apos;S A VERY ABOUT BY 

01:37:35.315 --> 01:37:38.015
TOO LOW FOR THAT.               
BUT IT&amp;apos;S A IT&amp;apos;S A VERY ABOUT BY 
THE VOLUME ON THE TOTAL LOT     

01:37:38.017 --> 01:37:42.620
BUT IT&amp;apos;S A IT&amp;apos;S A VERY ABOUT BY 
THE VOLUME ON THE TOTAL LOT     
JUST TO KIND I THINK THE        

01:37:42.622 --> 01:37:43.354
THE VOLUME ON THE TOTAL LOT     
JUST TO KIND I THINK THE        
PICTURES CAN BE A LITTLE        

01:37:43.356 --> 01:37:43.687
JUST TO KIND I THINK THE        
PICTURES CAN BE A LITTLE        
DECEIVING.                      

01:37:43.689 --> 01:37:45.957
PICTURES CAN BE A LITTLE        
DECEIVING.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S REALLY NOT THAT FAR     

01:37:45.959 --> 01:37:49.794
DECEIVING.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S REALLY NOT THAT FAR     
ABOVE THE SIDEWALK AND IN FACT  

01:37:49.796 --> 01:37:50.894
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S REALLY NOT THAT FAR     
ABOVE THE SIDEWALK AND IN FACT  
THE NORTH SIDE OF THE SIDEWALK  

01:37:50.896 --> 01:37:54.599
ABOVE THE SIDEWALK AND IN FACT  
THE NORTH SIDE OF THE SIDEWALK  
IS IS EVEN A FOOT LOWER THAN    

01:37:54.601 --> 01:37:57.835
THE NORTH SIDE OF THE SIDEWALK  
IS IS EVEN A FOOT LOWER THAN    
THAN WHAT THE THE THE LOWEST    

01:37:57.837 --> 01:37:59.036
IS IS EVEN A FOOT LOWER THAN    
THAN WHAT THE THE THE LOWEST    
PART OR THE LOWER PART OF THE   

01:37:59.038 --> 01:38:02.506
THAN WHAT THE THE THE LOWEST    
PART OR THE LOWER PART OF THE   
ENTRY IS IT&amp;apos;S IN TOTAL AT THE   

01:38:02.508 --> 01:38:03.307
PART OR THE LOWER PART OF THE   
ENTRY IS IT&amp;apos;S IN TOTAL AT THE   
HIGHEST POINT OF THE SIDEWALK   

01:38:03.309 --> 01:38:06.377
ENTRY IS IT&amp;apos;S IN TOTAL AT THE   
HIGHEST POINT OF THE SIDEWALK   
TO THE ENTRY AREA.              

01:38:06.379 --> 01:38:07.378
HIGHEST POINT OF THE SIDEWALK   
TO THE ENTRY AREA.              
THE SECOND ENTRY AREA IS JUST   

01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.081
TO THE ENTRY AREA.              
THE SECOND ENTRY AREA IS JUST   
UNDER TWO FEET AND SO FROM THE  

01:38:10.083 --> 01:38:13.383
THE SECOND ENTRY AREA IS JUST   
UNDER TWO FEET AND SO FROM THE  
OUTSIDE YOU&amp;apos;LL SEE WALKING DOWN 

01:38:13.385 --> 01:38:14.085
UNDER TWO FEET AND SO FROM THE  
OUTSIDE YOU&amp;apos;LL SEE WALKING DOWN 
THE SIDEWALK YOU&amp;apos;LL SEE A       

01:38:14.087 --> 01:38:17.087
OUTSIDE YOU&amp;apos;LL SEE WALKING DOWN 
THE SIDEWALK YOU&amp;apos;LL SEE A       
LITTLE WALL ON THE INSIDE IT&amp;apos;S  

01:38:17.089 --> 01:38:17.622
THE SIDEWALK YOU&amp;apos;LL SEE A       
LITTLE WALL ON THE INSIDE IT&amp;apos;S  
PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT         

01:38:17.624 --> 01:38:18.422
LITTLE WALL ON THE INSIDE IT&amp;apos;S  
PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT         
SOMEBODY COULD KIND OF LEAN ON  

01:38:18.424 --> 01:38:20.924
PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT         
SOMEBODY COULD KIND OF LEAN ON  
OR SIT ON AND IT WOULD BE ABOUT 

01:38:20.926 --> 01:38:22.025
SOMEBODY COULD KIND OF LEAN ON  
OR SIT ON AND IT WOULD BE ABOUT 
RIGHT HEIGHT FOR FOR PEOPLE TO  

01:38:22.027 --> 01:38:24.294
OR SIT ON AND IT WOULD BE ABOUT 
RIGHT HEIGHT FOR FOR PEOPLE TO  
TO KIND OF CONGREGATE, SIT      

01:38:24.296 --> 01:38:28.266
RIGHT HEIGHT FOR FOR PEOPLE TO  
TO KIND OF CONGREGATE, SIT      
HERE, LEAN ON THE WALL ALSO IF  

01:38:28.268 --> 01:38:29.066
TO KIND OF CONGREGATE, SIT      
HERE, LEAN ON THE WALL ALSO IF  
IT WAS JUST THE HEIGHT          

01:38:29.068 --> 01:38:32.303
HERE, LEAN ON THE WALL ALSO IF  
IT WAS JUST THE HEIGHT          
DIFFERENCE FROM EVEN WALKING    

01:38:32.305 --> 01:38:33.104
IT WAS JUST THE HEIGHT          
DIFFERENCE FROM EVEN WALKING    
DOWN THE SIDEWALK TO SOMEBODY   

01:38:33.106 --> 01:38:33.671
DIFFERENCE FROM EVEN WALKING    
DOWN THE SIDEWALK TO SOMEBODY   
IN THERE, IT&amp;apos;S NOT GREAT.       

01:38:33.673 --> 01:38:36.073
DOWN THE SIDEWALK TO SOMEBODY   
IN THERE, IT&amp;apos;S NOT GREAT.       
SO I DON&amp;apos;T THINK IT&amp;apos;LL BE VERY  

01:38:36.075 --> 01:38:36.740
IN THERE, IT&amp;apos;S NOT GREAT.       
SO I DON&amp;apos;T THINK IT&amp;apos;LL BE VERY  
JARRING FROM A STANDPOINT       

01:38:36.742 --> 01:38:38.809
SO I DON&amp;apos;T THINK IT&amp;apos;LL BE VERY  
JARRING FROM A STANDPOINT       
OF BEING LIKE, YOU KNOW,        

01:38:38.811 --> 01:38:39.877
JARRING FROM A STANDPOINT       
OF BEING LIKE, YOU KNOW,        
SEVERAL FEET DOWN OR ANYTHING   

01:38:39.879 --> 01:38:43.047
OF BEING LIKE, YOU KNOW,        
SEVERAL FEET DOWN OR ANYTHING   
LIKE THAT.                      

01:38:43.049 --> 01:38:47.184
SEVERAL FEET DOWN OR ANYTHING   
LIKE THAT.                      
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS REALLY JUST  

01:38:47.186 --> 01:38:48.119
LIKE THAT.                      
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS REALLY JUST  
OUTSIDERS TO SAY THAT, YOU      

01:38:48.121 --> 01:38:50.320
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS REALLY JUST  
OUTSIDERS TO SAY THAT, YOU      
KNOW, THERE&amp;apos;S SO MUCH THAT IN   

01:38:50.322 --> 01:38:51.155
OUTSIDERS TO SAY THAT, YOU      
KNOW, THERE&amp;apos;S SO MUCH THAT IN

FEET LOWER.                     
THIS IS JUST A CONCRETE WALL TO 
PROTECT PEOPLE FROM FALLING

THIS IS JUST A CONCRETE WALL TO 
PROTECT PEOPLE FROM FALLING     
OVER THE EDGE TO THE PARKING

NONCONTRIBUTING STRUCTURE.      

01:39:36.268 --> 01:39:37.301
IMMEDIATE AREA FOR ANOTHER      
NONCONTRIBUTING STRUCTURE.      
AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING   

01:39:37.303 --> 01:39:37.969
NONCONTRIBUTING STRUCTURE.      
AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING   
IS THAT THIS ONE KIND           

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:40.738
AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING   
IS THAT THIS ONE KIND

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:41.605
IS THAT THIS ONE KIND           
OF ENLIVENS THE STREET SCENE.   
SO IT&amp;apos;S NOT SO MUCH LIKE        

01:39:41.607 --> 01:39:42.506
OF ENLIVENS THE STREET SCENE.   
SO IT&amp;apos;S NOT SO MUCH LIKE        
THERE&amp;apos;S A WALL TO PROTECT THE   

01:39:42.508 --> 01:39:44.809
SO IT&amp;apos;S NOT SO MUCH LIKE        
THERE&amp;apos;S A WALL TO PROTECT THE   
PROPERTY FROM THE SIDEWALK AND  

01:39:44.811 --> 01:39:45.209
THERE&amp;apos;S A WALL TO PROTECT THE   
PROPERTY FROM THE SIDEWALK AND  
VICE VERSA.

PROPERTY FROM THE SIDEWALK AND  
VICE VERSA.                     
BUT IN OUR CASE IT&amp;apos;S MORE LIKE  

01:39:48.081 --> 01:39:48.846
VICE VERSA.                     
BUT IN OUR CASE IT&amp;apos;S MORE LIKE  
NATURAL MATERIALS THAT MATCH    

01:39:48.848 --> 01:39:49.447
BUT IN OUR CASE IT&amp;apos;S MORE LIKE  
NATURAL MATERIALS THAT MATCH    
OTHER THINGS IN THE             

01:39:49.449 --> 01:39:52.449
NATURAL MATERIALS THAT MATCH

WE WE DID MAKE SOME CHANGES TO  
PROPERTY.                       
ONE OF THE ONES THAT I THINK    

01:40:05.498 --> 01:40:07.531
PROPERTY.                       
ONE OF THE ONES THAT I THINK    
WORKED OUT BETTER IS THAT WE    

01:40:07.533 --> 01:40:11.101
ONE OF THE ONES THAT I THINK    
WORKED OUT BETTER IS THAT WE    
WERE ABLE TO WE THINK ABOUT THE 

01:40:11.103 --> 01:40:12.035
WORKED OUT BETTER IS THAT WE    
WERE ABLE TO WE THINK ABOUT THE 
SECTIONS BETWEEN THE FLOORS AND 

01:40:12.037 --> 01:40:15.873
WERE ABLE TO WE THINK ABOUT THE 
SECTIONS BETWEEN THE FLOORS AND 
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CEILING  

01:40:15.875 --> 01:40:16.607
SECTIONS BETWEEN THE FLOORS AND 
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CEILING  
THAT&amp;apos;S RAISED INSIDE THERE.     

01:40:16.609 --> 01:40:19.711
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CEILING  
THAT&amp;apos;S RAISED INSIDE THERE.     
THE CHANGES WERE PARTIALLY      

01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:23.847
THAT&amp;apos;S RAISED INSIDE THERE.     
THE CHANGES WERE PARTIALLY      
REQUIRED BY FIRE CODE BUT IN    

01:40:23.849 --> 01:40:24.782
THE CHANGES WERE PARTIALLY      
REQUIRED BY FIRE CODE BUT IN    
THE END I THINK IT LOOKED REAL  

01:40:24.784 --> 01:40:27.851
REQUIRED BY FIRE CODE BUT IN    
THE END I THINK IT LOOKED REAL  
REAL SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAD     

01:40:27.853 --> 01:40:28.452
THE END I THINK IT LOOKED REAL  
REAL SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAD     
ORIGINALLY PASSED.              

01:40:28.454 --> 01:40:31.489
REAL SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAD     
ORIGINALLY PASSED.              
THE WINDOWS CHANGED BECAUSE THE 

01:40:31.491 --> 01:40:32.222

THE WINDOWS CHANGED BECAUSE THE 
LAYOUT AND THE INSIDE HAD TO    

01:40:32.224 --> 01:40:35.325
THE WINDOWS CHANGED BECAUSE THE 
LAYOUT AND THE INSIDE HAD TO    
CHANGE AS A RESULT OF MOVING    

01:40:35.327 --> 01:40:39.130
LAYOUT AND THE INSIDE HAD TO    
CHANGE AS A RESULT OF MOVING    
THOSE THE STRUCTURE MOVING THE  

01:40:39.132 --> 01:40:39.530
CHANGE AS A RESULT OF MOVING    
THOSE THE STRUCTURE MOVING THE  
ENTRY DOWN.                     

01:40:39.532 --> 01:40:42.467
THOSE THE STRUCTURE MOVING THE  
ENTRY DOWN.                     
WE CHANGED THE INSIDE AND MADE  

01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:43.467
ENTRY DOWN.                     
WE CHANGED THE INSIDE AND MADE  
THE THE SOCIAL SPACE THE COMMON

SAVINGS ON THIS, I WAS ABLE TO  
BRING THE PROJECT I WOULDN&amp;apos;T    
SAY BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BUT    

01:42:53.132 --> 01:42:53.831
BRING THE PROJECT I WOULDN&amp;apos;T    
SAY BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BUT    
SOMEWHERE IN ALIGNMENT WHERE I  

01:42:53.833 --> 01:42:56.833
SAY BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BUT    
SOMEWHERE IN ALIGNMENT WHERE I  
COULD STILL ACTUALLY GET TO     

01:42:56.835 --> 01:42:57.101
SOMEWHERE IN ALIGNMENT WHERE I  
COULD STILL ACTUALLY GET TO     
FINANCE.                        

01:42:57.103 --> 01:43:00.804
COULD STILL ACTUALLY GET TO     
FINANCE.                        
BUT AS A RESULT ONE OF THE      

01:43:00.806 --> 01:43:01.805
FINANCE.                        
BUT AS A RESULT ONE OF THE      
SECTIONS IN THE BACK HAD TO GO  

01:43:01.807 --> 01:43:05.208
BUT AS A RESULT ONE OF THE      
SECTIONS IN THE BACK HAD TO GO  
TO THE TO THE REAR A LITTLE BIT 

01:43:05.210 --> 01:43:07.144
SECTIONS IN THE BACK HAD TO GO  
TO THE TO THE REAR A LITTLE BIT 
IN TO BE ABLE TO FIT IN WITH    

01:43:07.146 --> 01:43:10.781
TO THE TO THE REAR A LITTLE BIT 
IN TO BE ABLE TO FIT IN WITH    
THOSE ITEMS ARE BUILT THE SAME  

01:43:10.783 --> 01:43:15.318
IN TO BE ABLE TO FIT IN WITH    
THOSE ITEMS ARE BUILT THE SAME  
MY CHANGES TO THE FRONT DO ALSO 

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.023
THOSE ITEMS ARE BUILT THE SAME  
MY CHANGES TO THE FRONT DO ALSO 
AGAIN DUE TO THE DUE TO THE     

01:43:19.025 --> 01:43:23.227
MY CHANGES TO THE FRONT DO ALSO 
AGAIN DUE TO THE DUE TO THE     
CHANGE IN THE THREE WINDOWS IN  

01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:26.697
AGAIN DUE TO THE DUE TO THE     
CHANGE IN THE THREE WINDOWS IN  
THE FRONT NO LONGER WORKED IN   

01:43:26.699 --> 01:43:27.031
CHANGE IN THE THREE WINDOWS IN  
THE FRONT NO LONGER WORKED IN   
THAT WAY.                       

01:43:27.033 --> 01:43:28.098
THE FRONT NO LONGER WORKED IN   
THAT WAY.                       
SO WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT     

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:28.799
THAT WAY.                       
SO WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT     
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN     

01:43:28.801 --> 01:43:31.335
SO WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT     
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN     
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT WAS ALSO   

01:43:31.337 --> 01:43:37.675
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN     
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT WAS ALSO   
MATCHING MAGIC AND              

01:43:51.957 --> 01:43:54.158
                   PROVIDED A   
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT BETWEEN   
THE HOMES A LITTLE BIT          

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:54.758
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT BETWEEN   
THE HOMES A LITTLE BIT          
OF DISTINCTION ANYWAY.          

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:55.559
THE HOMES A LITTLE BIT          
OF DISTINCTION ANYWAY.          
WE&amp;apos;RE TRYING TO GO FROM TEN AND 

01:43:55.561 --> 01:43:56.293
OF DISTINCTION ANYWAY.          
WE&amp;apos;RE TRYING TO GO FROM TEN AND 
TWELVE TO TWELVE AND TWELVE     

01:43:56.295 --> 01:43:56.827
WE&amp;apos;RE TRYING TO GO FROM TEN AND 
TWELVE TO TWELVE AND TWELVE     
WHICH BETTER MATCH THE          

01:43:56.829 --> 01:43:57.695
TWELVE TO TWELVE AND TWELVE     
WHICH BETTER MATCH THE          
BUILDINGS ON THE STREET BUT ARE 

01:43:57.697 --> 01:43:58.362
WHICH BETTER MATCH THE          
BUILDINGS ON THE STREET BUT ARE 
WE&amp;apos;RE BEING COMPARED TO I THINK 

01:43:58.364 --> 01:43:59.162
BUILDINGS ON THE STREET BUT ARE 
WE&amp;apos;RE BEING COMPARED TO I THINK 
I HAVE A SLIDE COMING UP FOR    

01:43:59.164 --> 01:44:00.363
WE&amp;apos;RE BEING COMPARED TO I THINK 
I HAVE A SLIDE COMING UP FOR    
THAT ACTUALLY I JUST GO TO THAT 

01:44:00.365 --> 01:44:00.764
I HAVE A SLIDE COMING UP FOR    
THAT ACTUALLY I JUST GO TO THAT 
SLIDE HERE.                     

01:44:00.766 --> 01:44:01.432
THAT ACTUALLY I JUST GO TO THAT 
SLIDE HERE.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE PROPOSED SLIDE DOWN   

01:44:01.434 --> 01:44:02.233
SLIDE HERE.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE PROPOSED SLIDE DOWN   
ON THE BOTTOM THIS IS WHAT IT   

01:44:02.235 --> 01:44:03.233
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE PROPOSED SLIDE DOWN   
ON THE BOTTOM THIS IS WHAT IT   
IS IN THE FRONT AND THIS IS     

01:44:03.235 --> 01:44:04.801
ON THE BOTTOM THIS IS WHAT IT   
IS IN THE FRONT AND THIS IS     
WHAT IT IS BELOW THE LOW SLUNG  

01:44:04.803 --> 01:44:05.836
IS IN THE FRONT AND THIS IS     
WHAT IT IS BELOW THE LOW SLUNG  
NATURE OF THIS HOUSE AND HOW IT 

01:44:05.838 --> 01:44:06.437
WHAT IT IS BELOW THE LOW SLUNG  
NATURE OF THIS HOUSE AND HOW IT 
REALLY DOESN&amp;apos;T MATCH THE        

01:44:06.439 --> 01:44:09.440
NATURE OF THIS HOUSE AND HOW IT 
REALLY DOESN&amp;apos;T MATCH THE        
PATTERNS OF THE OTHER HOUSE.    

01:44:09.442 --> 01:44:10.574
REALLY DOESN&amp;apos;T MATCH THE        
PATTERNS OF THE OTHER HOUSE.    
IT KIND OF REMINDED ME OF A     

01:44:10.576 --> 01:44:12.910
PATTERNS OF THE OTHER HOUSE.    
IT KIND OF REMINDED ME OF A     
BROKEN FRONT TOOTH AND SO WHAT  

01:44:12.912 --> 01:44:16.380
IT KIND OF REMINDED ME OF A     
BROKEN FRONT TOOTH AND SO WHAT  
WE TRIED TO DO WITH THE NEW ONE 

01:44:16.382 --> 01:44:17.481
BROKEN FRONT TOOTH AND SO WHAT  
WE TRIED TO DO WITH THE NEW ONE 
IS TO MATCH THE DORMER PITCHES  

01:44:17.483 --> 01:44:21.218
WE TRIED TO DO WITH THE NEW ONE 
IS TO MATCH THE DORMER PITCHES  
AND THE 12 PITCHES YOU SEE      

01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:22.119
IS TO MATCH THE DORMER PITCHES  
AND THE 12 PITCHES YOU SEE      
COMMONLY ON THE BLOCK AND THEN  

01:44:22.121 --> 01:44:24.288
AND THE 12 PITCHES YOU SEE      
COMMONLY ON THE BLOCK AND THEN  
ALSO JUST SORT OF THE HEIGHTS   

01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:24.755
COMMONLY ON THE BLOCK AND THEN  
ALSO JUST SORT OF THE HEIGHTS   
OF THE HOMES.                   

01:44:24.757 --> 01:44:28.325
ALSO JUST SORT OF THE HEIGHTS   
OF THE HOMES.                   
SO SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE IT 

01:44:28.327 --> 01:44:29.159
OF THE HOMES.                   
SO SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE IT 
MATCH A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAN 

01:44:29.161 --> 01:44:34.999
SO SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE IT 
MATCH A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAN 
WHAT DOES CURRENTLY WE DID HGC  

01:44:35.001 --> 01:44:38.702
MATCH A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAN 
WHAT DOES CURRENTLY WE DID HGC  
PRINCIPLES FOR BUILDING THESE   

01:44:38.704 --> 01:44:39.370
WHAT DOES CURRENTLY WE DID HGC  
PRINCIPLES FOR BUILDING THESE   
STRUCTURES IN A HISTORIC        

01:44:39.372 --> 01:44:41.839
PRINCIPLES FOR BUILDING THESE   
STRUCTURES IN A HISTORIC        
DISTRICT AND THESE ARE THE SO   

01:44:41.841 --> 01:44:42.440
STRUCTURES IN A HISTORIC        
DISTRICT AND THESE ARE THE SO   
MAINTAINING THE EXISTING        

01:44:42.442 --> 01:44:45.743
DISTRICT AND THESE ARE THE SO   
MAINTAINING THE EXISTING        
SPACING FOR FRONT AND SIDE YARD 

01:44:45.745 --> 01:44:46.510
MAINTAINING THE EXISTING        
SPACING FOR FRONT AND SIDE YARD 
SETBACKS ALONG THE BLOCK AS     

01:44:46.512 --> 01:44:49.914
SPACING FOR FRONT AND SIDE YARD 
SETBACKS ALONG THE BLOCK AS     
SEEN FROM THE STREET AND THIS   

01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:50.680
SETBACKS ALONG THE BLOCK AS     
SEEN FROM THE STREET AND THIS   
SLIDE WAS REFERRED TO THIS      

01:44:50.682 --> 01:44:51.415
SEEN FROM THE STREET AND THIS   
SLIDE WAS REFERRED TO THIS      
YELLOW LINE HERE ALL OF THESE   

01:44:51.417 --> 01:44:54.418
SLIDE WAS REFERRED TO THIS      
YELLOW LINE HERE ALL OF THESE   
HOUSES MATCH UP PRETTY WELL AND 

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:55.252
YELLOW LINE HERE ALL OF THESE   
HOUSES MATCH UP PRETTY WELL AND 
THEN YOU GET TO THIS HOUSE AND  

01:44:55.254 --> 01:44:58.522
HOUSES MATCH UP PRETTY WELL AND 
THEN YOU GET TO THIS HOUSE AND  
IT&amp;apos;S IT IS KIND OF TWISTED ON   

01:44:58.524 --> 01:45:00.657
THEN YOU GET TO THIS HOUSE AND  
IT&amp;apos;S IT IS KIND OF TWISTED ON   
THE WALL AND I THINK PROBABLY   

01:45:00.659 --> 01:45:01.491
IT&amp;apos;S IT IS KIND OF TWISTED ON   
THE WALL AND I THINK PROBABLY   
THE ORIGINAL HOME THAT WAS      

01:45:01.493 --> 01:45:05.196
THE WALL AND I THINK PROBABLY   
THE ORIGINAL HOME THAT WAS      
THERE WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT 

01:45:05.198 --> 01:45:06.063
THE ORIGINAL HOME THAT WAS      
THERE WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT 
TIRED AND THEN WHEN THEY MOVED  

01:45:06.065 --> 01:45:09.166
THERE WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT 
TIRED AND THEN WHEN THEY MOVED  
THE OTHER HOUSE ON JUST KIND    

01:45:09.168 --> 01:45:09.834
TIRED AND THEN WHEN THEY MOVED  
THE OTHER HOUSE ON JUST KIND    
OF PUTTING THEM TOGETHER, IT&amp;apos;S  

01:45:09.836 --> 01:45:13.170
THE OTHER HOUSE ON JUST KIND    
OF PUTTING THEM TOGETHER, IT&amp;apos;S  
GOT A SIGNIFICANT HOUSE TO IT.  

01:45:13.172 --> 01:45:14.238
OF PUTTING THEM TOGETHER, IT&amp;apos;S  
GOT A SIGNIFICANT HOUSE TO IT.  
AND IF YOU THERE ARE A FEW      

01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.106
GOT A SIGNIFICANT HOUSE TO IT.  
AND IF YOU THERE ARE A FEW      
ORIENTATION POINTS IF YOU LIKE  

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:17.441
AND IF YOU THERE ARE A FEW      
ORIENTATION POINTS IF YOU LIKE  
ON THAT HOUSE A LINE UP.        

01:45:17.443 --> 01:45:19.976
ORIENTATION POINTS IF YOU LIKE  
ON THAT HOUSE A LINE UP.        
SO WE DID TURN IT TO MATCH THE  

01:45:19.978 --> 01:45:21.012
ON THAT HOUSE A LINE UP.        
SO WE DID TURN IT TO MATCH THE  
BUILDINGS TO THE SOUTH IN TERMS 

01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:24.481
SO WE DID TURN IT TO MATCH THE  
BUILDINGS TO THE SOUTH IN TERMS 
OF ITS ALIGNMENT TO THE STREET  

01:45:24.483 --> 01:45:25.315
BUILDINGS TO THE SOUTH IN TERMS 
OF ITS ALIGNMENT TO THE STREET  
AND THEN ALSO SQUARED IT UP TO  

01:45:25.317 --> 01:45:28.585
OF ITS ALIGNMENT TO THE STREET  
AND THEN ALSO SQUARED IT UP TO  
THE STREET AND THEN DOWN TO THE 

01:45:28.587 --> 01:45:29.253
AND THEN ALSO SQUARED IT UP TO  
THE STREET AND THEN DOWN TO THE 
NORTH IS THE CORNWALL MANSION   

01:45:29.255 --> 01:45:32.589
THE STREET AND THEN DOWN TO THE 
NORTH IS THE CORNWALL MANSION   
WHERE IT IS CONSIDERABLY AND AS 

01:45:32.591 --> 01:45:35.025
NORTH IS THE CORNWALL MANSION   
WHERE IT IS CONSIDERABLY AND AS 
JILL SAID, A KIND OF HISTORIC   

01:45:35.027 --> 01:45:35.826
WHERE IT IS CONSIDERABLY AND AS 
JILL SAID, A KIND OF HISTORIC   
DISTRICT KIND OF PETERS OUT     

01:45:35.828 --> 01:45:36.593
JILL SAID, A KIND OF HISTORIC   
DISTRICT KIND OF PETERS OUT     
THERE AND ALL THESE CHANGES     

01:45:36.595 --> 01:45:38.995
DISTRICT KIND OF PETERS OUT     
THERE AND ALL THESE CHANGES     
FORM.                           

01:45:38.997 --> 01:45:39.896
THERE AND ALL THESE CHANGES     
FORM.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS WAS ACTUALLY AN      

01:45:39.898 --> 01:45:42.900
FORM.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS WAS ACTUALLY AN      
IMPROVEMENT TO TO IT BECAUSE IT 

01:45:42.902 --> 01:45:43.834
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THIS WAS ACTUALLY AN      
IMPROVEMENT TO TO IT BECAUSE IT 
BRINGS IT MORE IN LINE WITH THE 

01:45:43.836 --> 01:45:46.737
IMPROVEMENT TO TO IT BECAUSE IT 
BRINGS IT MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
WITH THE OTHER WITH THE OTHER   

01:45:46.739 --> 01:45:47.871
BRINGS IT MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
WITH THE OTHER WITH THE OTHER   
HOMES ON THE BLOCK NOT ONLY IN  

01:45:47.873 --> 01:45:50.006
WITH THE OTHER WITH THE OTHER   
HOMES ON THE BLOCK NOT ONLY IN  
TERMS OF THE MASSING IN THE     

01:45:50.008 --> 01:45:50.941
HOMES ON THE BLOCK NOT ONLY IN  
TERMS OF THE MASSING IN THE     
BUILDING AND THE ROOF LINES AND 

01:45:50.943 --> 01:45:53.009
TERMS OF THE MASSING IN THE     
BUILDING AND THE ROOF LINES AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ALSO HOW   

01:45:53.011 --> 01:45:56.780
BUILDING AND THE ROOF LINES AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ALSO HOW   
IT&amp;apos;S ALIGNED TO THE STREET      

01:45:56.782 --> 01:45:57.648
THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ALSO HOW   
IT&amp;apos;S ALIGNED TO THE STREET      
LIGHTING THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 

01:45:57.650 --> 01:45:58.349
IT&amp;apos;S ALIGNED TO THE STREET      
LIGHTING THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
TOWARDS THE STREET AND CLEARLY  

01:45:58.351 --> 01:46:03.887
LIGHTING THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
TOWARDS THE STREET AND CLEARLY  
IDENTIFYING A FRONT DOOR.       

01:46:03.889 --> 01:46:04.822
TOWARDS THE STREET AND CLEARLY  
IDENTIFYING A FRONT DOOR.       
SO WE HAVE A TRADITIONAL PORCH  

01:46:04.824 --> 01:46:07.491
IDENTIFYING A FRONT DOOR.       
SO WE HAVE A TRADITIONAL PORCH  
ON THE FRONT IS THE FRONT DOOR  

01:46:07.493 --> 01:46:08.492
SO WE HAVE A TRADITIONAL PORCH  
ON THE FRONT IS THE FRONT DOOR  
AND A PORCH TO THE TO THE       

01:46:08.494 --> 01:46:11.562
ON THE FRONT IS THE FRONT DOOR  
AND A PORCH TO THE TO THE       
STREET I THINK PROBABLY BETTER  

01:46:11.564 --> 01:46:12.395
AND A PORCH TO THE TO THE       
STREET I THINK PROBABLY BETTER  
THAN IT DOES NOW WHICH IS       

01:46:12.397 --> 01:46:15.366
STREET I THINK PROBABLY BETTER  
THAN IT DOES NOW WHICH IS       
ALMOST KIND OF LIKE A DECK LIKE 

01:46:15.368 --> 01:46:15.966
THAN IT DOES NOW WHICH IS       
ALMOST KIND OF LIKE A DECK LIKE 
APPEARANCE ON THE FRONT WITH    

01:46:15.968 --> 01:46:18.969
ALMOST KIND OF LIKE A DECK LIKE 
APPEARANCE ON THE FRONT WITH    
SOME KIND OF STRANGE LITTLE     

01:46:18.971 --> 01:46:19.904
APPEARANCE ON THE FRONT WITH    
SOME KIND OF STRANGE LITTLE     
GABLE&amp;apos;S OVER THE OVER THE EACH  

01:46:19.906 --> 01:46:23.374
SOME KIND OF STRANGE LITTLE     
GABLE&amp;apos;S OVER THE OVER THE EACH  
DOOR THAT WE&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY A      

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:24.308
GABLE&amp;apos;S OVER THE OVER THE EACH  
DOOR THAT WE&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY A      
PORCH WAS CUT OFF AT A 45       

01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:27.010
DOOR THAT WE&amp;apos;RE ACTUALLY A      
PORCH WAS CUT OFF AT A 45       
DEGREE ANGLE.                   

01:46:27.012 --> 01:46:27.944
PORCH WAS CUT OFF AT A 45       
DEGREE ANGLE.

WAS REALLY THE MESSAGE THAT I   
HEARD THAT YOU WERE PROPOSING   
THIS SOLID CONCRETE PAVED       

01:56:57.976 --> 01:57:02.012
HEARD THAT YOU WERE PROPOSING   
THIS SOLID CONCRETE PAVED       
SURFACE IN THE IN THAT FRONT    

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:05.648
THIS SOLID CONCRETE PAVED       
SURFACE IN THE IN THAT FRONT    
PORTION OF THE YARD THAT IN UM  

01:57:05.650 --> 01:57:08.952
SURFACE IN THE IN THAT FRONT    
PORTION OF THE YARD THAT IN UM  
BUT I AND I APOLOGIZE IF I      

01:57:08.954 --> 01:57:09.820
PORTION OF THE YARD THAT IN UM  
BUT I AND I APOLOGIZE IF I      
MISSED IT BUT I DIDN&amp;apos;T HEAR     

01:57:09.822 --> 01:57:13.222

THAT THERE WAS A PERFORMANCE OR 

01:57:13.224 --> 01:57:16.793
MISSED IT BUT I DIDN&amp;apos;T HEAR     
THAT THERE WAS A PERFORMANCE OR 
SOME SORT OF WATER ISSUE REASON 

01:57:16.795 --> 01:57:21.097
THAT THERE WAS A PERFORMANCE OR 
SOME SORT OF WATER ISSUE REASON 
FOR THE SOLID CONCRETE THAT&amp;apos;S   

01:57:21.099 --> 01:57:24.600
SOME SORT OF WATER ISSUE REASON 
FOR THE SOLID CONCRETE THAT&amp;apos;S   
GOING IN.                       

01:57:24.602 --> 01:57:25.868
FOR THE SOLID CONCRETE THAT&amp;apos;S   
GOING IN.                       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS MORE OF AN ESTHETIC   

01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:26.135
GOING IN.                       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS MORE OF AN ESTHETIC   
DECISION.                       

01:57:26.137 --> 01:57:26.603
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS MORE OF AN ESTHETIC   
DECISION.                       
IS THAT CORRECT?                

01:57:26.605 --> 01:57:27.870
DECISION.                       
IS THAT CORRECT?                
YES.                            

01:57:27.872 --> 01:57:29.105
IS THAT CORRECT?                
YES.                            
I HAD TO PUT A DRAIN IN THIS    

01:57:29.107 --> 01:57:32.275
YES.                            
I HAD TO PUT A DRAIN IN THIS    
AREA REGARDLESS EVEN IF I WAS   

01:57:32.277 --> 01:57:33.042
I HAD TO PUT A DRAIN IN THIS    
AREA REGARDLESS EVEN IF I WAS   
TO DO ANY TYPE OF PAVEMENT      

01:57:33.044 --> 01:57:35.845
AREA REGARDLESS EVEN IF I WAS   
TO DO ANY TYPE OF PAVEMENT      
MATERIALS BECAUSE DOESN&amp;apos;T WORK  

01:57:35.847 --> 01:57:36.179
TO DO ANY TYPE OF PAVEMENT      
MATERIALS BECAUSE DOESN&amp;apos;T WORK  
HERE.                           

01:57:36.181 --> 01:57:39.649
MATERIALS BECAUSE DOESN&amp;apos;T WORK  
HERE.                           
SO EVEN PAVERS EVEN PERVIOUS    

01:57:39.651 --> 01:57:40.317
HERE.                           
SO EVEN PAVERS EVEN PERVIOUS    
PAVERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT     

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:40.983
SO EVEN PAVERS EVEN PERVIOUS    
PAVERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT     
STILL AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO           

01:57:40.985 --> 01:57:42.986
PAVERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT     
STILL AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO           
INFILTRATE WATER TO THE CITY    

01:57:42.988 --> 01:57:43.853
STILL AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO           
INFILTRATE WATER TO THE CITY    
STANDARDS OR REALLY WHAT I      

01:57:43.855 --> 01:57:47.523
INFILTRATE WATER TO THE CITY    
STANDARDS OR REALLY WHAT I      
WOULD WANT SEEING IS, YOU KNOW, 

01:57:47.525 --> 01:57:48.491
STANDARDS OR REALLY WHAT I      
WOULD WANT SEEING IS, YOU KNOW, 
THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS A    

01:57:48.493 --> 01:57:50.560
WOULD WANT SEEING IS, YOU KNOW, 
THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS A    
POND IN THAT AREA.              

01:57:50.562 --> 01:57:54.797
THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS A    
POND IN THAT AREA.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE MATERIALS WERE NOT    

01:57:54.799 --> 01:57:55.298
POND IN THAT AREA.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE MATERIALS WERE NOT    
SELECTED FROM A WATER           

01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:56.099
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THE MATERIALS WERE NOT    
SELECTED FROM A WATER           
MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE BUT MORE 

01:57:56.101 --> 01:57:58.735
SELECTED FROM A WATER           
MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE BUT MORE 
FROM AN ESTHETIC PERSPECTIVE    

01:57:58.737 --> 01:57:59.603
MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE BUT MORE 
FROM AN ESTHETIC PERSPECTIVE    
THAT IS CORRECT THAT THE WATER  

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:00.237
FROM AN ESTHETIC PERSPECTIVE    
THAT IS CORRECT THAT THE WATER  
WILL BE MANAGED THROUGH A DRAIN 

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:03.306
THAT IS CORRECT THAT THE WATER  
WILL BE MANAGED THROUGH A DRAIN 
AND THAT IN THAT AND THAT AREA. 

01:58:03.308 --> 01:58:06.075
WILL BE MANAGED THROUGH A DRAIN 
AND THAT IN THAT AND THAT AREA.

WELL IT&amp;apos;S NINE FEET TO LET ME   
SEE HOLD ON ONE SECOND.         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK THAT MIGHT BE TO THE 

02:03:04.075 --> 02:03:04.407
SEE HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

I THINK ON PAGE THIRTY SEVEN    
AND I THINK IT&amp;apos;S ON THAT SLIDE  
WHERE YOU HAD THE YELLOW LINE   

02:03:15.387 --> 02:03:18.654
AND I THINK IT&amp;apos;S ON THAT SLIDE  
WHERE YOU HAD THE YELLOW LINE   
INDICATING THAT YES I SEE       

02:03:18.656 --> 02:03:19.456
WHERE YOU HAD THE YELLOW LINE   
INDICATING THAT YES I SEE       
ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER REPORT 

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:22.358
INDICATING THAT YES I SEE       
ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER REPORT 
SET BACK AND THEN EIGHTEEN      

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:22.691
ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER REPORT 
SET BACK AND THEN EIGHTEEN      
YEAH.                           

02:03:22.693 --> 02:03:26.562
SET BACK AND THEN EIGHTEEN      
YEAH.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT&amp;apos;S SIXTY SIX DENHA LET  

02:03:26.564 --> 02:03:30.566
YEAH.

ME PULL THAT UP A LITTLE BIT OK 

02:03:30.568 --> 02:03:31.634
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT&amp;apos;S SIXTY SIX DENHA LET  
ME PULL THAT UP A LITTLE BIT OK 
SO THIS DRAWING IS A LITTLE BIT 

02:03:31.636 --> 02:03:34.970
ME PULL THAT UP A LITTLE BIT OK 
SO THIS DRAWING IS A LITTLE BIT 
AN ERROR BECAUSE THE WALL IS    

02:03:34.972 --> 02:03:35.905
SO THIS DRAWING IS A LITTLE BIT 
AN ERROR BECAUSE THE WALL IS    
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SIDEWALK  

02:03:35.907 --> 02:03:39.142
AN ERROR BECAUSE THE WALL IS    
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SIDEWALK  
IN THIS CASE AND WE BROUGHT IT  

02:03:39.144 --> 02:03:42.978
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SIDEWALK  
IN THIS CASE AND WE BROUGHT IT  
IN BOARD SO THAT WE CAN HAVE    

02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:43.613
IN THIS CASE AND WE BROUGHT IT  
IN BOARD SO THAT WE CAN HAVE    
SOME PLANTINGS THERE AND WE&amp;apos;RE  

02:03:43.615 --> 02:03:47.083
IN BOARD SO THAT WE CAN HAVE    
SOME PLANTINGS THERE AND WE&amp;apos;RE  
ABLE TO TO LOSE A STEP GOING UP 

02:03:47.085 --> 02:03:49.786
SOME PLANTINGS THERE AND WE&amp;apos;RE  
ABLE TO TO LOSE A STEP GOING UP 
TO THE PORCH SO IT&amp;apos;S NINE FEET  

02:03:49.788 --> 02:03:50.720
ABLE TO TO LOSE A STEP GOING UP 
TO THE PORCH SO IT&amp;apos;S NINE FEET  
FROM THE FRONT OF THE PORCH TO  

02:03:50.722 --> 02:03:54.090
TO THE PORCH SO IT&amp;apos;S NINE FEET  
FROM THE FRONT OF THE PORCH TO  
THE TO TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE    

02:03:54.092 --> 02:03:57.627
FROM THE FRONT OF THE PORCH TO  
THE TO TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE    
WALL LET&amp;apos;S SAY THE STREETSCAPE  

02:03:57.629 --> 02:04:01.564
THE TO TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE    
WALL LET&amp;apos;S SAY THE STREETSCAPE  
SIDE OF THE WALL AND THEN IT IS 

02:04:01.566 --> 02:04:02.632
WALL LET&amp;apos;S SAY THE STREETSCAPE  
SIDE OF THE WALL AND THEN IT IS 
THERE IS A PORCH IT&amp;apos;S SIX AND A 

02:04:02.634 --> 02:04:05.334
SIDE OF THE WALL AND THEN IT IS 
THERE IS A PORCH IT&amp;apos;S SIX AND A 
HALF FEET.                      

02:04:05.336 --> 02:04:06.369
THERE IS A PORCH IT&amp;apos;S SIX AND A 
HALF FEET.                      
SO IT&amp;apos;D BE LET&amp;apos;S SEE NINE FEET  

02:04:06.371 --> 02:04:08.971
HALF FEET.                      
SO IT&amp;apos;D BE LET&amp;apos;S SEE NINE FEET  
PLUS SIX AND I&amp;apos;M NOT GREAT AT   

02:04:08.973 --> 02:04:12.375
SO IT&amp;apos;D BE LET&amp;apos;S SEE NINE FEET  
PLUS SIX AND I&amp;apos;M NOT GREAT AT   
MATH ON THE SPOT ABOUT SIXTEEN  

02:04:12.377 --> 02:04:12.775
PLUS SIX AND I&amp;apos;M NOT GREAT AT   
MATH ON THE SPOT ABOUT SIXTEEN  
FEET.                           

02:04:12.777 --> 02:04:13.942
MATH ON THE SPOT ABOUT SIXTEEN
