00:10:26.057 --> 00:10:29.192
WELL, ALL OF THE OTHER          
LOCATIONS THAT HAVE THAT        
FEATURE HAVE THEIR DESIGN       

00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:29.659
LOCATIONS THAT HAVE THAT

00:10:37.835 --> 00:10:38.501
BUT THEY UNFORTUNATELY THINK    
WE'VE CLOSED THEIR DOORS        
ALTOGETHER AND THAT'S CERTAINLY 

00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:39.034
WE'VE CLOSED THEIR DOORS        
ALTOGETHER AND THAT'S CERTAINLY 
NOT OUR INTENT.
