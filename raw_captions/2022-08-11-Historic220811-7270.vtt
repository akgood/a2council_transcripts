THAT ARE GOING THIS HOUSE AND   
IN THE TWO HOUSES               

00:22:36.642 --> 00:22:38.675
                  NORTH ARE     
PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL SO THERE  
ARE NO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME     

00:22:38.677 --> 00:22:39.410
PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL SO THERE  
ARE NO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME     
THERE&amp;apos;S AN ADDITION ON THE      

00:22:39.412 --> 00:22:40.077

THERE&amp;apos;S AN ADDITION ON THE

00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:40.911
THERE&amp;apos;S AN ADDITION ON THE      
HOUSE IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH  
AND THEN THE GARAGE IN THE REAR 

00:22:40.913 --> 00:22:41.646

AND THEN THE GARAGE IN THE REAR 
IS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE     

00:22:41.648 --> 00:22:41.979
AND THEN THE GARAGE IN THE REAR 
IS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE     
ADJACENT.                       

00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:42.380
IS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE     
ADJACENT.                       
THAT&amp;apos;S CORRECT.                 

00:22:42.382 --> 00:22:43.314
ADJACENT.                       
THAT&amp;apos;S CORRECT.                 
I THINK THE AND THIS MAY BE A   

00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:44.114
THAT&amp;apos;S CORRECT.                 
I THINK THE AND THIS MAY BE A   
QUESTION FOR THE APPLICANT WHEN 

00:22:44.116 --> 00:22:44.782
I THINK THE AND THIS MAY BE A   
QUESTION FOR THE APPLICANT WHEN 
WE GET TO IT BUT WE WERE        

00:22:44.784 --> 00:22:45.450
QUESTION FOR THE APPLICANT WHEN 
WE GET TO IT BUT WE WERE        
LOOKING AT THE HEIGHT OF THE    

00:22:45.452 --> 00:22:46.183
WE GET TO IT BUT WE WERE        
LOOKING AT THE HEIGHT OF THE    
GARAGE IN COMPARISON TO THE     

00:22:46.185 --> 00:22:46.917
LOOKING AT THE HEIGHT OF THE    
GARAGE IN COMPARISON TO THE     
HOUSE WHICH I BELIEVE ARE TO    

00:22:46.919 --> 00:22:47.585
GARAGE IN COMPARISON TO THE     
HOUSE WHICH I BELIEVE ARE TO    
THE EDITION WHICH I BELIEVE IS  

00:22:47.587 --> 00:22:48.385
HOUSE WHICH I BELIEVE ARE TO    
THE EDITION WHICH I BELIEVE IS  
ONLY ABOUT FOUR INCHES OR SO    

00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:49.120
THE EDITION WHICH I BELIEVE IS  
ONLY ABOUT FOUR INCHES OR SO    
LESS BUT THE GRADE IS PRETTY    

00:22:49.122 --> 00:22:49.387
ONLY ABOUT FOUR INCHES OR SO    
LESS BUT THE GRADE IS PRETTY    
SLIGHT.                         

00:22:49.389 --> 00:22:52.089
LESS BUT THE GRADE IS PRETTY    
SLIGHT.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS HARD TO TELL HOW MUCH 

00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:52.757
SLIGHT.                         
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS HARD TO TELL HOW MUCH 
MORE THAT GRADE CHANGES AT THE  

00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:56.026
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS HARD TO TELL HOW MUCH 
MORE THAT GRADE CHANGES AT THE  
GARAGE LEVEL THAN A HOUSE.      

00:22:56.028 --> 00:22:57.161
MORE THAT GRADE CHANGES AT THE  
GARAGE LEVEL THAN A HOUSE.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT WILL BE TALLER I THINK 

00:22:57.163 --> 00:22:59.997
GARAGE LEVEL THAN A HOUSE.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT WILL BE TALLER I THINK 
THAN THE ADJACENT GARAGE BUT    

00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:00.464
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT WILL BE TALLER I THINK 
THAN THE ADJACENT GARAGE BUT    
NOT BY A LOT.                   

00:23:00.466 --> 00:23:03.467
THAN THE ADJACENT GARAGE BUT    
NOT BY A LOT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THAT WAS REALLY I THINK   

00:23:03.469 --> 00:23:04.735
NOT BY A LOT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THAT WAS REALLY I THINK   
THE ONLY THING THAT I WAS JUST  

00:23:04.737 --> 00:23:05.403

SO BACK TO TO BUILDINGS WILL BE 
BELOW THE RIDGE LINE OF THE

SO BACK TO TO BUILDINGS WILL BE 
BELOW THE RIDGE LINE OF THE

THE SAME HEIGHT RIDGE LENGTH OK 
AND THAT IS A FUNCTION THAT     

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.482
THE SAME HEIGHT RIDGE LENGTH OK 
AND THAT IS A FUNCTION THAT     
ABOUT TWO STORIES IN HEIGHT AND
