OF USE OF A GOLF GAS POWERED    
GOLF CART EMITS THE SAME AMOUNT 

01:33:56.101 --> 01:34:00.136
OF USE OF A GOLF GAS POWERED    
GOLF CART EMITS THE SAME AMOUNT 
OF CO2 AS EIGHT REFRIGERATORS   

01:34:00.138 --> 01:34:00.903
GOLF CART EMITS THE SAME AMOUNT

01:34:23.495 --> 01:34:24.427
CRAZY POLLUTANTS THAT WE&apos;RE     
SUBSIDIZING.                    
AND I ALSO THINK THERE&apos;S A      

01:34:24.429 --> 01:34:25.095
SUBSIDIZING.                    
AND I ALSO THINK THERE&apos;S A      
REALLY TERRIBLE DICHOTOMY THAT  

01:34:25.097 --> 01:34:27.496
