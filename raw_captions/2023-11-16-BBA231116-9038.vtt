STATE FOR A DIFFERENT EXEMPTION 
TO RAISE THE SECOND FLOOR       
DEPENDING ON THE USE THEN WE    

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:51.048
TO RAISE THE SECOND FLOOR       
DEPENDING ON THE USE THEN WE    
HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE STATE

THINGS WE FIND.                 
SO WE FOUND OUT LIKE BECAUSE IT 
WAS BUILT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN 

00:26:10.603 --> 00:26:12.436
SO WE FOUND OUT LIKE BECAUSE IT 
WAS BUILT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN 
HUNDREDS THERE ARE NOW CROSS

SO WE WE NEED TO REINFORCE      

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.948
ROOF IS LITERALLY PUSHING DOWN. 
SO WE WE NEED TO REINFORCE      
EVERYTHING MOVING FORWARD AND   

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.051
SO WE WE NEED TO REINFORCE      
EVERYTHING MOVING FORWARD AND   
WE HAVE TO LOOK COST BENEFITS   

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:28.686
EVERYTHING MOVING FORWARD AND   
WE HAVE TO LOOK COST BENEFITS   
OF EVERYTHING TO FIGURE OUT     

00:26:28.688 --> 00:26:29.486
WE HAVE TO LOOK COST BENEFITS   
OF EVERYTHING TO FIGURE OUT     
WHAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO AS FAR   

00:26:29.488 --> 00:26:32.122
OF EVERYTHING TO FIGURE OUT     
WHAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO AS FAR

00:26:32.124 --> 00:26:35.693
WHAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO AS FAR   
AS USE AND STUFF AND ACCESS TO  
THE FIRST FLOOR IF WE&apos;RE        

00:26:35.695 --> 00:26:36.560
AS USE AND STUFF AND ACCESS TO  
THE FIRST FLOOR IF WE&apos;RE        
HANDICAPPED WOULD BE USING THAT 

00:26:36.562 --> 00:26:40.063
THE FIRST FLOOR IF WE&apos;RE        
HANDICAPPED WOULD BE USING THAT 
RAMP EITHER EXIT OR ENTRANCE.   

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:41.064
HANDICAPPED WOULD BE USING THAT 
RAMP EITHER EXIT OR ENTRANCE.   
YEAH, AND THERE&apos;S NO REAL WAY   

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:43.967
RAMP EITHER EXIT OR ENTRANCE.   
YEAH, AND THERE&apos;S NO REAL WAY   
TO GET TO THE SECOND LOAD AT    

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:44.601
YEAH, AND THERE&apos;S NO REAL WAY   
TO GET TO THE SECOND LOAD AT    
THIS POINT BECAUSE THERE&apos;S NO   

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.271
TO GET TO THE SECOND LOAD AT    
THIS POINT BECAUSE THERE&apos;S NO   
ELEVATOR AND NO THERE&apos;S NO      

00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:48.071
THIS POINT BECAUSE THERE&apos;S NO

ELEVATOR WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN  

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:51.408
ELEVATOR AND NO THERE&apos;S NO      
ELEVATOR WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN  
HUNDRED BUT THERE ARE TWO       

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.109
ELEVATOR WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN  
HUNDRED BUT THERE ARE TWO

THE DRIVEWAY GETS GRAVEL BUT    
THERE&apos;S A SIDEWALK THAT&apos;S ALONG 

00:29:47.486 --> 00:29:47.951
THE DRIVEWAY GETS GRAVEL BUT    
THERE&apos;S A SIDEWALK THAT&apos;S ALONG 
THE SIDE.                       

00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:51.221
THERE&apos;S A SIDEWALK THAT&apos;S ALONG 
THE SIDE.                       
PART OF THAT IS PART OF IT WAS  

00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:51.922

00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:56.193
YEAH.                           
AND SO YOUR SIDE RAMP ISN&apos;T     
GOING TO INTERFERE WITH THE     

00:29:56.195 --> 00:29:58.394
AND SO YOUR SIDE RAMP ISN&apos;T     
GOING TO INTERFERE WITH THE     
SIDEWALK TO SIDEWALK WILL STILL

THE EAST RIVER                  

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:14.611
               THE REFERENDUM   
COMES OUT TO THE SIDEWALK AND   
THEN YOU TAKE THE SIDEWALK TO   

00:30:14.613 --> 00:30:20.984
COMES OUT TO THE SIDEWALK AND   
THEN YOU TAKE THE SIDEWALK TO   
THE STREET OR                   

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.563
              YOU KNOW, THERE

WAS NO WINDOWS IN THE BACK      
OF THE HOUSE YOU WERE FILLING   
UP TO THE BATHROOM.             

00:30:34.099 --> 00:30:34.964
OF THE HOUSE YOU WERE FILLING   
UP TO THE BATHROOM.             
SO THERE&apos;S THE RAMP IS          

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:37.633
UP TO THE BATHROOM.             
SO THERE&apos;S THE RAMP IS          
BASICALLY SEPARATED BY FIRE AT  

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:40.003
SO THERE&apos;S THE RAMP IS          
BASICALLY SEPARATED BY FIRE AT

TIME WITH THE WOOD DECK BURNING 
IN CASE OF A FIRE.              
I MEAN YOU CAN FRAME IT OUT     

00:31:48.674 --> 00:31:49.472
