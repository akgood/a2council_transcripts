00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:56.831
AND THEN IT GOES BACK OUTSIDE   
OF THE GARAGE TO THE GENERATOR  
.                               

00:37:56.833 --> 00:37:57.365

I APOLOGIZE.                    
I'M NOT LOOKING AT IT RIGHT     
THIS SECOND BUT I CAN I CAN     

00:38:01.238 --> 00:38:02.103
I'M NOT LOOKING AT IT RIGHT     
THIS SECOND BUT I CAN I CAN     
KIND OF DESCRIBE IT SO IT GOES  

00:38:02.105 --> 00:38:02.704
THIS SECOND BUT I CAN I CAN     
KIND OF DESCRIBE IT SO IT GOES  
THROUGH THE FOUNDATION WHILE    

00:38:02.706 --> 00:38:04.238
KIND OF DESCRIBE IT SO IT GOES  
THROUGH THE FOUNDATION WHILE    
THE HOUSE IT RUNS UNDERGROUND.  

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.272
THROUGH THE FOUNDATION WHILE    
THE HOUSE IT RUNS UNDERGROUND.  
IT DOES RUN UNDERNEATH THE IT

THE HOUSE IT RUNS UNDERGROUND.  
IT DOES RUN UNDERNEATH THE IT   
RUNS THROUGH THE FOUNDATION     

00:38:08.111 --> 00:38:08.843
IT DOES RUN UNDERNEATH THE IT   
RUNS THROUGH THE FOUNDATION     
WALL AND THEN COMES UP THROUGH

WALL AND THEN COMES UP THROUGH  
THE GARAGE FLOOR.               
I THINK I HAD ONE PICTURE OF IT 

00:38:12.315 --> 00:38:13.113
THE GARAGE FLOOR.               
I THINK I HAD ONE PICTURE OF IT 
COMING THROUGH THE GARAGE FLOOR 

00:38:13.115 --> 00:38:16.384
I THINK I HAD ONE PICTURE OF IT 
COMING THROUGH THE GARAGE FLOOR 
WHICH WAS AGAIN OLD WORK THEN   

00:38:16.386 --> 00:38:18.820
COMING THROUGH THE GARAGE FLOOR 
WHICH WAS AGAIN OLD WORK THEN   
IT RUNS IT RUNS UP THE WALL AND 

00:38:18.822 --> 00:38:19.788
WHICH WAS AGAIN OLD WORK THEN   
IT RUNS IT RUNS UP THE WALL AND 
ALONG THE CEILING OF THE GARAGE 

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:23.123
IT RUNS IT RUNS UP THE WALL AND 
ALONG THE CEILING OF THE GARAGE 
AND THEN DOWN THE WALL AND      

00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:23.858
ALONG THE CEILING OF THE GARAGE 
AND THEN DOWN THE WALL AND      
THROUGH THE WALL ABOVE GRADE TO 

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.526
AND THEN DOWN THE WALL AND      
THROUGH THE WALL ABOVE GRADE TO 
WHERE THE GENERATOR WAS         

00:38:24.528 --> 00:38:27.662
THROUGH THE WALL ABOVE GRADE TO 
WHERE THE GENERATOR WAS         
INSTALLED AND THAT THAT ABOVE   

00:38:27.664 --> 00:38:30.998
WHERE THE GENERATOR WAS         
INSTALLED AND THAT THAT ABOVE   
GRADE POINT WHERE IT GOES       

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.699
INSTALLED AND THAT THAT ABOVE   
GRADE POINT WHERE IT GOES       
THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE       

00:38:31.701 --> 00:38:32.867
GRADE POINT WHERE IT GOES       
THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE       
GENERATOR IS IS WHAT'S ON THIS  

00:38:32.869 --> 00:38:37.538
THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE       
GENERATOR IS IS WHAT'S ON THIS  
PERMIT.                         

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.339
GENERATOR IS IS WHAT'S ON THIS  
PERMIT.                         
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE        

00:38:38.341 --> 00:38:39.207
PERMIT.                         
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE        
QUADRUPLY HAVE TO COME UP TO    

00:38:39.209 --> 00:38:41.476
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE        
QUADRUPLY HAVE TO COME UP TO    
THE WALL LIKE THIS GO BACK DOWN 

00:38:41.478 --> 00:38:42.276
QUADRUPLY HAVE TO COME UP TO    
THE WALL LIKE THIS GO BACK DOWN 
BELOW GROUND BACK UP AROUND TO  

00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:45.146
THE WALL LIKE THIS GO BACK DOWN 
BELOW GROUND BACK UP AROUND TO  
SHOULD THAT WENT UP TO LIKE     

00:38:45.148 --> 00:38:45.946
BELOW GROUND BACK UP AROUND TO  
SHOULD THAT WENT UP TO LIKE     
THIS INSTEAD OF RIGHT THROUGH   

00:38:45.948 --> 00:38:48.182
SHOULD THAT WENT UP TO LIKE     
THIS INSTEAD OF RIGHT THROUGH   
THE WALL AND THEN UP ABOVE      

00:38:48.184 --> 00:38:48.983
THIS INSTEAD OF RIGHT THROUGH   
THE WALL AND THEN UP ABOVE      
GRADE FOR THE FITTING.          

00:38:48.985 --> 00:38:52.921
THE WALL AND THEN UP ABOVE      
GRADE FOR THE FITTING.          
SO SO ON PAGE SEVENTEEN THAT'S  

00:38:52.923 --> 00:38:56.491
GRADE FOR THE FITTING.          
SO SO ON PAGE SEVENTEEN THAT'S  
TWELVE UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IF  

00:38:56.493 --> 00:39:00.428
SO SO ON PAGE SEVENTEEN THAT'S  
TWELVE UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IF  
YOU IF YOU FLIP TO THE OTHER    

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.228
TWELVE UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IF  
YOU IF YOU FLIP TO THE OTHER    
SIDE OF THAT CONCRETE BLOCK YOU 

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.198
YOU IF YOU FLIP TO THE OTHER    
SIDE OF THAT CONCRETE BLOCK YOU 
WOULD BE OUTSIDE.               

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:04.965
SIDE OF THAT CONCRETE BLOCK YOU 
WOULD BE OUTSIDE.               
>> THAT IS CORRECT.             

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:07.868

IS IS JUST BELOW THE GRADE.     
SO IT SEEMED VERY SILLY TO GO   
CUT INTO THAT AND ADD MORE

I ASSUME THE ISSUE WITH THIS    
CODE AND WHY THE CODE WAS       
UPDATED WAS FOR LEAKS.          

00:40:16.072 --> 00:40:19.373
CODE AND WHY THE CODE WAS       
UPDATED WAS FOR LEAKS.

LEAK POINTS WHEN WE ALREADY     
PASSED THE PRESSURE TEST YOU    
PASSED A PRESSURE TEST FOR YOUR 

00:40:28.418 --> 00:40:32.320
PASSED THE PRESSURE TEST YOU    
PASSED A PRESSURE TEST FOR YOUR

NEW STUFF, NOT FOR THE OLD      
STUFF.                          
>> WE PASSED THE PRESSURE TEST  

00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:35.323
STUFF.                          
>> WE PASSED THE PRESSURE TEST  
FOR THE OLD STUFF AS WELL.      

00:40:35.325 --> 00:40:36.057
>> WE PASSED THE PRESSURE TEST  
FOR THE OLD STUFF AS WELL.      
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WAS       

00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:38.959
FOR THE OLD STUFF AS WELL.      
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WAS       
PRESSURE TESTED AND IT WAS      

00:40:38.961 --> 00:40:39.293
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WAS       
PRESSURE TESTED AND IT WAS      
INSTALLED.                      

00:40:39.295 --> 00:40:39.961
PRESSURE TESTED AND IT WAS      
INSTALLED.                      
SO WHEN THE GARAGE WAS          

00:40:39.963 --> 00:40:40.695
INSTALLED.                      
SO WHEN THE GARAGE WAS          
INSTALLED WE DID THAT AND WE    

00:40:40.697 --> 00:40:42.764
SO WHEN THE GARAGE WAS          
INSTALLED WE DID THAT AND WE    
RAN A BUNCH OF IN PREPARATION   

00:40:42.766 --> 00:40:46.367
INSTALLED WE DID THAT AND WE    
RAN A BUNCH OF IN PREPARATION   
FOR THIS GENERATOR INSTALL AND  

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:46.968
RAN A BUNCH OF IN PREPARATION   
FOR THIS GENERATOR INSTALL AND  
THE GENERATORS GENERATOR        

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:47.302
FOR THIS GENERATOR INSTALL AND  
THE GENERATORS GENERATOR        
INSTALLED.                      

00:40:47.304 --> 00:40:48.102
THE GENERATORS GENERATOR        
INSTALLED.                      
THEY THEY DID PRESSURE TESTING  

00:40:48.104 --> 00:40:50.905
INSTALLED.                      
THEY THEY DID PRESSURE TESTING  
TOO AND AGAIN IT PASSED.        

00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:52.106
THEY THEY DID PRESSURE TESTING  
TOO AND AGAIN IT PASSED.        
>> BUT THE ISSUE ISN'T THE      

00:40:52.108 --> 00:40:54.775
TOO AND AGAIN IT PASSED.        
>> BUT THE ISSUE ISN'T THE      
PRESSURE TEST.                  

00:40:54.777 --> 00:40:55.709
>> BUT THE ISSUE ISN'T THE      
PRESSURE TEST.                  
THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT      

00:40:55.711 --> 00:40:58.779
PRESSURE TEST.                  
THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT      
YOU'VE GOT TO PIPE GAS COMING   

00:40:58.781 --> 00:41:02.349
THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT      
YOU'VE GOT TO PIPE GAS COMING   
IN UNDER THE GARAGE SLAB AND    

00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:03.351
YOU'VE GOT TO PIPE GAS COMING   
IN UNDER THE GARAGE SLAB AND    
THEN TURNING UP IN THE GARAGE   

00:41:03.353 --> 00:41:05.954
IN UNDER THE GARAGE SLAB AND    
THEN TURNING UP IN THE GARAGE   
IF IT TURNED IT OUTSIDE THE

THEN TURNING UP IN THE GARAGE   
IF IT TURNED IT OUTSIDE THE     
GARAGE AND THEN CAME INTO THE   

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:10.858
IF IT TURNED IT OUTSIDE THE     
GARAGE AND THEN CAME INTO THE   
GARAGE ABOVE THE SLAB WOULD BE  

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.728
GARAGE AND THEN CAME INTO THE   
GARAGE ABOVE THE SLAB WOULD BE  
FINE.                           

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.931
GARAGE ABOVE THE SLAB WOULD BE  
FINE.                           
IT SEEMS LIKE A RELATIVE OF THE 

00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:21.402
FINE.                           
IT SEEMS LIKE A RELATIVE OF THE 
SIMPLE FIX TO COMPLY WITH THE   

00:41:21.404 --> 00:41:21.636
IT SEEMS LIKE A RELATIVE OF THE 
SIMPLE FIX TO COMPLY WITH THE   
CODE .                          

00:41:21.638 --> 00:41:22.870
SIMPLE FIX TO COMPLY WITH THE   
CODE .                          
>> YEAH, THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT 

00:41:22.872 --> 00:41:25.506
CODE .                          
>> YEAH, THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT 
IT'S BRAND NEW CONCRETE OUTSIDE 

00:41:25.508 --> 00:41:26.573
>> YEAH, THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT 
IT'S BRAND NEW CONCRETE OUTSIDE 
WE WOULD HAVE TO DIG UP AND     

00:41:26.575 --> 00:41:27.408
IT'S BRAND NEW CONCRETE OUTSIDE 
WE WOULD HAVE TO DIG UP AND     
THEN DIG UP THE SECTIONS        

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.643
WE WOULD HAVE TO DIG UP AND     
THEN DIG UP THE SECTIONS        
OF YARD BETWEEN IT TO TO MAKE   

00:41:29.645 --> 00:41:30.278
THEN DIG UP THE SECTIONS        
OF YARD BETWEEN IT TO TO MAKE

YEAH YEAH YEAH OBSERVE IT AND   
REALIZE IT AND THEN RIGHT       

00:44:52.047 --> 00:44:56.717
YEAH YEAH YEAH OBSERVE IT AND   
REALIZE IT AND THEN RIGHT       
SUKANYA THE CONCRETE WAS POURED 

00:44:56.719 --> 00:45:03.224
REALIZE IT AND THEN RIGHT       
SUKANYA THE CONCRETE WAS POURED 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN POURED         

00:45:04.493 --> 00:45:13.234
                        JUST    
UNRELATED QUESTION BUT WHEN ALL 
THE UTILITIES PUT THE GARAGE    

00:45:13.236 --> 00:45:16.737
UNRELATED QUESTION BUT WHEN ALL 
THE UTILITIES PUT THE GARAGE    
WITH THAT TRENCH WAS DUG ALL    

00:45:16.739 --> 00:45:19.874
THE UTILITIES PUT THE GARAGE    
WITH THAT TRENCH WAS DUG ALL    
THE PIPES IN THE SAME TRENCH.   

00:45:19.876 --> 00:45:20.874
WITH THAT TRENCH WAS DUG ALL    
THE PIPES IN THE SAME TRENCH.   
>> YES THERE ARE DIFFERENT      

00:45:20.876 --> 00:45:21.142
THE PIPES IN THE SAME TRENCH.   
>> YES THERE ARE DIFFERENT      
LEVELS.                         

00:45:21.144 --> 00:45:25.012
>> YES THERE ARE DIFFERENT      
LEVELS.                         
THEY'RE SLIGHTLY UPSET BECAUSE  

00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:28.115
LEVELS.                         
THEY'RE SLIGHTLY UPSET BECAUSE  
THE TRYING TO RUN BUT I THINK   

00:45:28.117 --> 00:45:28.916
THEY'RE SLIGHTLY UPSET BECAUSE  
THE TRYING TO RUN BUT I THINK   
THE WAISTLINE HAD TO BE A       

00:45:28.918 --> 00:45:29.684
THE TRYING TO RUN BUT I THINK   
THE WAISTLINE HAD TO BE A       
DIFFERENT DEPTH THAN THE FEED   

00:45:29.686 --> 00:45:31.785
THE WAISTLINE HAD TO BE A       
DIFFERENT DEPTH THAN THE FEED   
LINE FOR THE WATER.             

00:45:31.787 --> 00:45:33.087
DIFFERENT DEPTH THAN THE FEED   
LINE FOR THE WATER.             
BUT YES THEY ARE IT WAS ABOUT   

00:45:33.089 --> 00:45:36.423
LINE FOR THE WATER.             
BUT YES THEY ARE IT WAS ABOUT   
THREE FEET WIDE AND FIVE FEET   

00:45:36.425 --> 00:45:39.259
BUT YES THEY ARE IT WAS ABOUT   
THREE FEET WIDE AND FIVE FEET   
OR SO DEEP BUT YEAH BUT THEY'RE 

00:45:39.261 --> 00:45:39.760
THREE FEET WIDE AND FIVE FEET   
OR SO DEEP BUT YEAH BUT THEY'RE 
NEAR EACH OTHER.                

00:45:39.762 --> 00:45:40.227
OR SO DEEP BUT YEAH BUT THEY'RE 
NEAR EACH OTHER.                
>> YEAH YEAH.                   

00:45:40.229 --> 00:45:43.897

>> YEAH YEAH.                   
I MEAN YOU CAN'T I'M I'M I'M    
ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES I HAVE 

00:45:44.634 --> 00:45:47.367
I MEAN YOU CAN'T I'M I'M I'M    
ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES I HAVE 
TO CONFIRM WITH YOU CAN'T GO IN 

00:45:47.369 --> 00:45:48.068
ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES I HAVE 
TO CONFIRM WITH YOU CAN'T GO IN 
THE SAME TRENCH ELECTRIFYING    

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:53.907
TO CONFIRM WITH YOU CAN'T GO IN 
THE SAME TRENCH ELECTRIFYING    
GAS NOT NOT ELECTRICAL SORRY    

00:45:53.909 --> 00:45:58.112
THE SAME TRENCH ELECTRIFYING    
GAS NOT NOT ELECTRICAL SORRY    
ONLY ONLY WATER OUT WAIST BACK  

00:45:58.114 --> 00:45:59.012
GAS NOT NOT ELECTRICAL SORRY    
ONLY ONLY WATER OUT WAIST BACK  
BECAUSE THE WAIST TIES INTO OUR 

00:45:59.014 --> 00:46:02.549
ONLY ONLY WATER OUT WAIST BACK  
BECAUSE THE WAIST TIES INTO OUR 
HOUSE AND THE GAS THERE'S NO    

00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:03.351
BECAUSE THE WAIST TIES INTO OUR 
HOUSE AND THE GAS THERE'S NO    
ELECTRICAL IN THE SAME TRENCH.  

00:46:03.353 --> 00:46:05.986
HOUSE AND THE GAS THERE'S NO    
ELECTRICAL IN THE SAME TRENCH.  
>> I APOLOGIZE IF I SAID THAT   

00:46:05.988 --> 00:46:10.824
ELECTRICAL IN THE SAME TRENCH.  
>> I APOLOGIZE IF I SAID THAT   
MEAN THE WORST CASE THE         

00:46:10.826 --> 00:46:11.525
>> I APOLOGIZE IF I SAID THAT   
MEAN THE WORST CASE THE         
EQUIVALENT OF A WHOLE NEW GAS   

00:46:11.527 --> 00:46:12.593
MEAN THE WORST CASE THE         
EQUIVALENT OF A WHOLE NEW GAS   
LINE BUT IF TO BRING A BIG DOWN 

00:46:12.595 --> 00:46:14.795
EQUIVALENT OF A WHOLE NEW GAS   
LINE BUT IF TO BRING A BIG DOWN 
TIME BACK INTO THAT THING IT    

00:46:14.797 --> 00:46:15.529
LINE BUT IF TO BRING A BIG DOWN 
TIME BACK INTO THAT THING IT    
SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO CUT 

00:46:15.531 --> 00:46:17.598
TIME BACK INTO THAT THING IT    
SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO CUT 
A HOLE IN EACH END AND WELL THE 

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.499
SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO CUT 
A HOLE IN EACH END AND WELL THE 
THING IS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE  

00:46:18.501 --> 00:46:21.835
A HOLE IN EACH END AND WELL THE 
THING IS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE  
A SOLID SOLID RUN.              

00:46:21.837 --> 00:46:22.769
THING IS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE  
A SOLID SOLID RUN.              
>> YEAH, MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT

HE'S GOT THAT SOFT BUT THE      

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:29.076
YEP.                            
HE'S GOT THAT SOFT BUT THE      
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE EVER      

00:46:29.078 --> 00:46:32.947
HE'S GOT THAT SOFT BUT THE      
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE EVER      
HAPPENED TO THAT EXPLOSION      

00:46:32.949 --> 00:46:34.148
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE EVER      
HAPPENED TO THAT EXPLOSION      
OF THAT LINE WOULD BLOW UP THAT 

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:37.818
HAPPENED TO THAT EXPLOSION      
OF THAT LINE WOULD BLOW UP THAT 
FOUNDATION THIS MORNING WHEN I  

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:38.519
OF THAT LINE WOULD BLOW UP THAT 
FOUNDATION THIS MORNING WHEN I  
WAS WITH THIS FROM OUTSIDE      

00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:40.721
FOUNDATION THIS MORNING WHEN I  
WAS WITH THIS FROM OUTSIDE      
OF STAYING OUTSIDE AND HEARD UP 

00:46:40.723 --> 00:46:41.521
WAS WITH THIS FROM OUTSIDE      
OF STAYING OUTSIDE AND HEARD UP 
THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WHERE     

00:46:41.523 --> 00:46:45.526
OF STAYING OUTSIDE AND HEARD UP 
THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WHERE     
FIRE RATINGS ARE PUT IN PLACE   

00:46:45.528 --> 00:46:46.394
THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WHERE     
FIRE RATINGS ARE PUT IN PLACE   
FOR THAT REASON AND BECAUSE WE  

00:46:46.396 --> 00:46:49.096
FIRE RATINGS ARE PUT IN PLACE   
FOR THAT REASON AND BECAUSE WE  
WENT THROUGH A FOUNDATION       

00:46:49.098 --> 00:46:49.697
FOR THAT REASON AND BECAUSE WE  
WENT THROUGH A FOUNDATION       
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.             

00:46:49.699 --> 00:46:50.631
WENT THROUGH A FOUNDATION       
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.             
AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE      

00:46:50.633 --> 00:46:54.034
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.             
AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE      
PROPER LIKE YOU CAN'T SEE RIGHT 

00:46:54.036 --> 00:46:57.270
AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE      
PROPER LIKE YOU CAN'T SEE RIGHT 
NOW, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THEY   

00:46:57.272 --> 00:46:58.305
PROPER LIKE YOU CAN'T SEE RIGHT 
NOW, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THEY   
DON'T HAVE THE CONCRETE IS FLAT 

00:46:58.307 --> 00:47:01.141
NOW, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THEY   
DON'T HAVE THE CONCRETE IS FLAT 
AROUND PIPE AND THERE'S NO      

00:47:01.143 --> 00:47:01.875
DON'T HAVE THE CONCRETE IS FLAT 
AROUND PIPE AND THERE'S NO      
PROTECTION AROUND THAT PIPE.    

00:47:01.877 --> 00:47:04.812
AROUND PIPE AND THERE'S NO      
PROTECTION AROUND THAT PIPE.    
>> YOU CAN'T PUT CONCRETE UP    

00:47:04.814 --> 00:47:08.182
PROTECTION AROUND THAT PIPE.    
>> YOU CAN'T PUT CONCRETE UP    
AGAINST THIS BECAUSE THE LINE   

00:47:08.184 --> 00:47:09.049
>> YOU CAN'T PUT CONCRETE UP    
AGAINST THIS BECAUSE THE LINE   
WILL DETERIORATE THAT LINE AND  

00:47:09.051 --> 00:47:12.653
AGAINST THIS BECAUSE THE LINE   
WILL DETERIORATE THAT LINE AND  
THAT'S WHY THEY PUT A CUSHION   

00:47:12.655 --> 00:47:16.556
WILL DETERIORATE THAT LINE AND  
THAT'S WHY THEY PUT A CUSHION   
AROUND THOSE LINES SO WHOEVER   

00:47:16.558 --> 00:47:17.624
THAT'S WHY THEY PUT A CUSHION   
AROUND THOSE LINES SO WHOEVER   
DID THIS DID IT FOR HEY, LET'S  

00:47:17.626 --> 00:47:20.895
AROUND THOSE LINES SO WHOEVER   
DID THIS DID IT FOR HEY, LET'S  
JUST TALK OUTSIDE IN HERE JUST  

00:47:20.897 --> 00:47:21.428
DID THIS DID IT FOR HEY, LET'S  
JUST TALK OUTSIDE IN HERE JUST  
FOR THE FUTURE.                 

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.364
JUST TALK OUTSIDE IN HERE JUST  
FOR THE FUTURE.                 
BUT IT JUST DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT  

00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:25.298
FOR THE FUTURE.                 
BUT IT JUST DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT  
AND THAT'S YOUR CONDUIT, YOUR   

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.069
BUT IT JUST DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT  
AND THAT'S YOUR CONDUIT, YOUR   
GAS LINE WILL DETERIORATE OVER  

00:47:28.071 --> 00:47:31.539
AND THAT'S YOUR CONDUIT, YOUR   
GAS LINE WILL DETERIORATE OVER  
TIME.                           

00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:32.739
GAS LINE WILL DETERIORATE OVER  
TIME.                           
>> IT'S A GREAT GAS LINE BUT    

00:47:32.741 --> 00:47:34.775
TIME.                           
>> IT'S A GREAT GAS LINE BUT    
THE CONCRETE ITSELF WON'T       

00:47:34.777 --> 00:47:38.812
>> IT'S A GREAT GAS LINE BUT    
THE CONCRETE ITSELF WON'T       
DETERIORATE THAT GAS AND THAT   

00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:42.916
THE CONCRETE ITSELF WON'T       
DETERIORATE THAT GAS AND THAT   
CONTRACTOR SHOULD COME BACK,    

00:47:42.918 --> 00:47:43.884
DETERIORATE THAT GAS AND THAT   
CONTRACTOR SHOULD COME BACK,    
BRING THIS UP, PAY FOR THE      

00:47:43.886 --> 00:47:46.586
CONTRACTOR SHOULD COME BACK,    
BRING THIS UP, PAY FOR THE      
FOUNDATION, PAY FOR THE EVERY

FOUNDATION, PAY FOR THE EVERY   
BIT, TURN THIS UP OUTSIDE AND   
PUT IT RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT    

00:47:50.559 --> 00:47:56.664
BIT, TURN THIS UP OUTSIDE AND   
PUT IT RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT    
SHOULD HAPPEN                   

00:48:01.403 --> 00:48:06.039
              IS THAT EVEN IF   
THEY REMOVE THIS LINE BECAUSE   
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS LINE, IT 

00:48:06.041 --> 00:48:06.473
THEY REMOVE THIS LINE BECAUSE   
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS LINE, IT 
STILL CONNECTS.                 

00:48:06.475 --> 00:48:07.607
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS LINE, IT 
STILL CONNECTS.                 
YOU KNOW, I GUESS IF YOU DON'T

CHIP UP THE CONCRETE THAT'S     
RIGHT THERE.                    
THEY COULD TRIP UP THE CONCRETE 

00:48:16.718 --> 00:48:17.585
RIGHT THERE.                    
THEY COULD TRIP UP THE CONCRETE 
THAT'S ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEY
