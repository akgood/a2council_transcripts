DECREASE TRAFFIC STOPS IT'LL    
HAVE AN IMPACT ON TRAFFIC       
FATALITIES AND WE WERE HAVING A 

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.300
HAVE AN IMPACT ON TRAFFIC       
FATALITIES AND WE WERE HAVING A 
LOT OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES UNTIL 

00:34:25.302 --> 00:34:28.035
FATALITIES AND WE WERE HAVING A 
LOT OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES UNTIL 
WE IMPLEMENTED THE EQUIPMENT    

00:34:28.037 --> 00:34:28.703
LOT OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES UNTIL 
WE IMPLEMENTED THE EQUIPMENT    
VIOLATIONS AND STOPPED DOING    

00:34:28.705 --> 00:34:31.906
WE IMPLEMENTED THE EQUIPMENT    
VIOLATIONS AND STOPPED DOING    
THEM AND AT THAT TIME THEY      

00:34:31.908 --> 00:34:32.307
VIOLATIONS AND STOPPED DOING    
THEM AND AT THAT TIME THEY      
STOPPED.                        

00:34:32.309 --> 00:34:35.810
THEM AND AT THAT TIME THEY      
STOPPED.                        
WE HAD ONLY ONE FATALITY        

00:34:35.812 --> 00:34:36.678
STOPPED.                        
WE HAD ONLY ONE FATALITY        
INCIDENT AND THAT WAS BECAUSE   

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.881
WE HAD ONLY ONE FATALITY        
INCIDENT AND THAT WAS BECAUSE   
UNFORTUNATELY A PERSON RAN INTO 

00:34:39.883 --> 00:34:40.281
INCIDENT AND THAT WAS BECAUSE   
UNFORTUNATELY A PERSON RAN INTO 
A DEER.                         

00:34:40.283 --> 00:34:41.549
UNFORTUNATELY A PERSON RAN INTO 
A DEER.                         
AND SO WHAT THE STUDY SHOWED IS 

00:34:41.551 --> 00:34:43.584
A DEER.                         
AND SO WHAT THE STUDY SHOWED IS 
THAT WHEN YOU'RE STOPPING       

00:34:43.586 --> 00:34:44.352
AND SO WHAT THE STUDY SHOWED IS 
THAT WHEN YOU'RE STOPPING       
PEOPLE LESS FOR MINOR EQUIPMENT 

00:34:44.354 --> 00:34:47.522
THAT WHEN YOU'RE STOPPING       
PEOPLE LESS FOR MINOR EQUIPMENT 
VIOLATIONS, YOUR COMMUNITY IS   

00:34:47.524 --> 00:34:50.724
PEOPLE LESS FOR MINOR EQUIPMENT 
VIOLATIONS, YOUR COMMUNITY IS   
SAFER AND SOUNDS KIND OF ODD    

00:34:50.726 --> 00:34:51.726
VIOLATIONS, YOUR COMMUNITY IS   
SAFER AND SOUNDS KIND OF ODD    
BUT THAT'S WHAT THE STUDIES     

00:34:51.728 --> 00:34:51.993
SAFER AND SOUNDS KIND OF ODD    
BUT THAT'S WHAT THE STUDIES     
SAY.                            

00:34:51.995 --> 00:34:52.660
BUT THAT'S WHAT THE STUDIES     
SAY.                            
THAT'S WHAT THE INFORMATION     

00:34:52.662 --> 00:34:55.563

THAT'S WHAT THE INFORMATION     
THAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME SUGGEST. 

00:34:55.565 --> 00:34:56.497
THAT'S WHAT THE INFORMATION     
THAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME SUGGEST. 
WE LOOKED AT IT AND THAT'S      

00:34:56.499 --> 00:34:58.332
THAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME SUGGEST. 
WE LOOKED AT IT AND THAT'S      
CLEARLY WHAT'S HAPPENING.       

00:34:58.334 --> 00:35:01.902
WE LOOKED AT IT AND THAT'S      
CLEARLY WHAT'S HAPPENING.       
BUT I'LL END BY SAYING THAT IS  

00:35:01.904 --> 00:35:02.736
CLEARLY WHAT'S HAPPENING.       
BUT I'LL END BY SAYING THAT IS  
REALLY NOT ABOUT DATA.          

00:35:02.738 --> 00:35:06.474
BUT I'LL END BY SAYING THAT IS  
REALLY NOT ABOUT DATA.          
THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT  

00:35:06.476 --> 00:35:07.075
REALLY NOT ABOUT DATA.          
THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT  
WE DON'T HAVE A DISPARATE       

00:35:07.077 --> 00:35:10.478
THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT  
WE DON'T HAVE A DISPARATE       
IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHEN WE STOP   

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:10.811
WE DON'T HAVE A DISPARATE       
IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHEN WE STOP   
THEM.                           

00:35:10.813 --> 00:35:13.882
IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHEN WE STOP   
THEM.                           
MAINLY PEOPLE OF COLOR MOSTLY

SOMETIMES WHEN YOU FIND         
SOMEBODY IF LOOK AT MYSELF AND

01:05:22.023 --> 01:05:25.991
A WHITE BUT REALLY IT'S NOT THE

SO IF WE HAVE A DISTINCT ONE AS 

01:05:25.993 --> 01:05:29.461
ETHNICITY THAT I'M LOOKING AT.  
SO IF WE HAVE A DISTINCT ONE AS 
MIDDLE EASTERN NORTH AFRICAN    

01:05:29.463 --> 01:05:32.865
SO IF WE HAVE A DISTINCT ONE AS 
MIDDLE EASTERN NORTH AFRICAN    
THAT WOULD ALSO GIVE US ANOTHER

MIDDLE EASTERN NORTH AFRICAN    
THAT WOULD ALSO GIVE US ANOTHER 
SOURCE OF ANALYZING DATA AND    

01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:37.136
THAT WOULD ALSO GIVE US ANOTHER 
SOURCE OF ANALYZING DATA AND    
MORE FIFTH THE WAY THAN JUST    

01:05:37.138 --> 01:05:40.607
SOURCE OF ANALYZING DATA AND    
MORE FIFTH THE WAY THAN JUST

AND SO THIS IS SOME OF THE      

01:05:48.383 --> 01:05:49.048
