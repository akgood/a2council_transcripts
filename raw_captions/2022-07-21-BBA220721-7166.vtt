00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:23.303
ACROSS THE PROPERTY LINE WHICH  
CURRENTLY IS BEING SERVED OUT

CURRENTLY IS BEING SERVED OUT

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:26.272
OF THE CADILLAC BUILDING WHICH

SO IN THAT BUILDING GETS        

00:20:26.274 --> 00:20:27.007

SO IN THAT BUILDING GETS        
DEMOLISHED AND ORIGINALLY WE    

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:30.143
SO IN THAT BUILDING GETS        
DEMOLISHED AND ORIGINALLY WE    
WANTED TO TIE IT INTO THE       

00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:30.811
DEMOLISHED AND ORIGINALLY WE    
WANTED TO TIE IT INTO THE       
MICHIGAN THEATER FIRE SPRINKLER 

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:34.081
WANTED TO TIE IT INTO THE       
MICHIGAN THEATER FIRE SPRINKLER 
SYSTEM THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF THE LOBBY 

00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:34.814
MICHIGAN THEATER FIRE SPRINKLER 
SYSTEM THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF THE LOBBY 
BUT THAT CROSSES A PROPERTY     

00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:37.217
SYSTEM THAT&amp;apos;S PART OF THE LOBBY 
BUT THAT CROSSES A PROPERTY     
LINE WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE   

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:38.151
BUT THAT CROSSES A PROPERTY     
LINE WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE   
CODE THAT WE CAN THAT WOULD BE  

00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:41.187
LINE WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE   
CODE THAT WE CAN THAT WOULD BE  
ANOTHER REASON TO BE HERE.      

00:20:41.189 --> 00:20:42.322
CODE THAT WE CAN THAT WOULD BE  
ANOTHER REASON TO BE HERE.      
WE WERE GOING TO TRY TO TIE IT  

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:42.656
ANOTHER REASON TO BE HERE.      
WE WERE GOING TO TRY TO TIE IT  
INTO THAT.

WE WERE GOING TO TRY TO TIE IT  
INTO THAT.                      
SO GLEN IS NOT WRONG IN THE

WE HAVE TO COME BACK FROM THE

REMAIN SPRINKLED.               
WE HAVE TO COME BACK FROM THE

THAT WAS OUR CHOICE.            
BUT THERE COULD BE A POSSIBLE   
WAY OF WHICH IS THAT ALL THE

BUT THERE COULD BE A POSSIBLE   
WAY OF WHICH IS THAT ALL THE

HATCHET AREA WAS A THAT WAS A   
DEDICATED FIRE RATED ENCLOSED   
TUNNEL WOULD THAT MAKE A        

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.142
DEDICATED FIRE RATED ENCLOSED   
TUNNEL WOULD THAT MAKE A

PASSAGEWAY THAT MET THOSE       
REQUIREMENTS TO THE EXTERIOR,   
YES, THAT WOULD THAT WOULD MEET

THE OTHER PART OF IS THE        
OCCUPANT LOAD.                  
WE WOULD REQUIRE A SECOND EXIT

INTERESTING SCENARIO BETWEEN    
THESE TWO BUILDINGS.            

00:27:44.913 --> 00:27:48.648
INTERESTING SCENARIO BETWEEN    
THESE TWO BUILDINGS.            
SO WE CAME TO YOU LAST YEAR AND 

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.716
THESE TWO BUILDINGS.            
SO WE CAME TO YOU LAST YEAR AND 
A HALF AGO TO ASK FOR THIS DOOR 

00:27:49.718 --> 00:27:52.652
SO WE CAME TO YOU LAST YEAR AND 
A HALF AGO TO ASK FOR THIS DOOR 
BETWEEN THE THEATER IN THE AND  

00:27:52.654 --> 00:27:53.186
A HALF AGO TO ASK FOR THIS DOOR 
BETWEEN THE THEATER IN THE AND  
THE SCREENING ROOM.             

00:27:53.188 --> 00:27:57.090
BETWEEN THE THEATER IN THE AND  
THE SCREENING ROOM.             
YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A    

00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:57.691
THE SCREENING ROOM.             
YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A    
DOOR ON A PROPERTY LINE.        

00:27:57.693 --> 00:28:01.327
YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A    
DOOR ON A PROPERTY LINE.        
SO THIS DOOR IS ALREADY KIND    

00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:04.997
DOOR ON A PROPERTY LINE.        
SO THIS DOOR IS ALREADY KIND    
OF A CONVOLUTED CODE ISSUE HERE 

00:28:04.999 --> 00:28:05.532
SO THIS DOOR IS ALREADY KIND    
OF A CONVOLUTED CODE ISSUE HERE 
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY YOU         

00:28:05.534 --> 00:28:07.734
OF A CONVOLUTED CODE ISSUE HERE 
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY YOU         
SHOULDN&amp;apos;T BE ENTERING THE       

00:28:07.736 --> 00:28:08.468
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY YOU         
SHOULDN&amp;apos;T BE ENTERING THE       
MICHIGAN THEATER AND CROSSING   

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.202
SHOULDN&amp;apos;T BE ENTERING THE       
MICHIGAN THEATER AND CROSSING   
THE SCREENING ROOM, CROSSING    

00:28:09.204 --> 00:28:12.205
MICHIGAN THEATER AND CROSSING   
THE SCREENING ROOM, CROSSING    
THIS THRESHOLD TO GO INTO THE   

00:28:12.207 --> 00:28:13.005
THE SCREENING ROOM, CROSSING    
THIS THRESHOLD TO GO INTO THE   
SCREENING ROOM TO BEGIN WITH    

00:28:13.007 --> 00:28:15.709
THIS THRESHOLD TO GO INTO THE   
SCREENING ROOM TO BEGIN WITH    
BECAUSE THE SCREENING ARM       

00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:16.576
SCREENING ROOM TO BEGIN WITH    
BECAUSE THE SCREENING ARM       
SHOULD BE ON THE MICHIGAN       

00:28:16.578 --> 00:28:17.177
BECAUSE THE SCREENING ARM       
SHOULD BE ON THE MICHIGAN       
THEATER PROPERTY.               

00:28:17.179 --> 00:28:19.779
SHOULD BE ON THE MICHIGAN       
THEATER PROPERTY.               
SO IF THAT WAS THE CASE THEN    

00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:20.613
THEATER PROPERTY.               
SO IF THAT WAS THE CASE THEN    
THIS THIS BUILDING WOULD BE     

00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:21.314
SO IF THAT WAS THE CASE THEN    
THIS THIS BUILDING WOULD BE     
PART OF THE SAME BUILDING,      

00:28:21.316 --> 00:28:24.250
THIS THIS BUILDING WOULD BE     
PART OF THE SAME BUILDING,      
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE THIS SCENARIO SO  

00:28:24.252 --> 00:28:25.018
PART OF THE SAME BUILDING,      
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE THIS SCENARIO SO  
THAT YOU GUYS WOULD ALL WANT TO 

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.887
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE THIS SCENARIO SO  
THAT YOU GUYS WOULD ALL WANT TO 
GO THAT DIRECTION.              

00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:28.855
THAT YOU GUYS WOULD ALL WANT TO 
GO THAT DIRECTION.              
THE PROBLEM IS THAT&amp;apos;S NOT HOW   

00:28:28.857 --> 00:28:29.689
GO THAT DIRECTION.              
THE PROBLEM IS THAT&amp;apos;S NOT HOW   
THIS WAS BUILT AND HOW THIS WAS 

00:28:29.691 --> 00:28:31.758
THE PROBLEM IS THAT&amp;apos;S NOT HOW   
THIS WAS BUILT AND HOW THIS WAS

DIVIDER AND GO EITHER           
DIRECTION.                      
SO WE&amp;apos;D BE LIMITING THE EGRESS

EXITS.                          
SO I GO I DON&amp;apos;T BELIEVE THAT    
WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CREATE     

00:43:05.633 --> 00:43:08.501
SO I GO I DON&amp;apos;T BELIEVE THAT    
WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CREATE     
ACCORDING TO THE OPENING TO DO  

00:43:08.503 --> 00:43:09.368
WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CREATE     
ACCORDING TO THE OPENING TO DO  
THAT WE INTERRUPT THIS THEATER. 

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:10.035
ACCORDING TO THE OPENING TO DO  
THAT WE INTERRUPT THIS THEATER. 
THE BALCONY WOULD COULD BE      

00:43:10.037 --> 00:43:11.303
THAT WE INTERRUPT THIS THEATER. 
THE BALCONY WOULD COULD BE      
AFFECTED BY A HORIZONTAL EXIT.  

00:43:11.305 --> 00:43:15.274
THE BALCONY WOULD COULD BE      
AFFECTED BY A HORIZONTAL EXIT.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE WERE COULD BE THAT THE 

00:43:15.276 --> 00:43:18.944
AFFECTED BY A HORIZONTAL EXIT.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE WERE COULD BE THAT THE

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE WERE COULD BE THAT THE 
SPACE IS PRETTY TALL.           
SO I THINK YOU COULD CREATE A   

00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:20.879
SPACE IS PRETTY TALL.           
SO I THINK YOU COULD CREATE A   
TUNNEL THAT COMES OUT OF THOSE  

00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:22.914
SO I THINK YOU COULD CREATE A   
TUNNEL THAT COMES OUT OF THOSE  
DOORS.                          

00:43:22.916 --> 00:43:23.315

THE CHALLENGE IS YOU&amp;apos;VE GOT THE 
STAIRS COMING DOWN ON ONE SIDE

00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:18.363
                            SO  
IT WAS SIX THIRTY               
UNDER-CONSTRUCTION EACH ONE     

00:45:18.365 --> 00:45:19.064
IT WAS SIX THIRTY               
UNDER-CONSTRUCTION EACH ONE     
CONSTRUCTION WAS NOT UNDER      

00:45:19.066 --> 00:45:19.598
UNDER-CONSTRUCTION EACH ONE     
CONSTRUCTION WAS NOT UNDER      
CONSTRUCTION THERE.

COULD YOU EXIT SOONER?          
IT IS CURRENTLY UNDER           
CONSTRUCTION.

IT IS CURRENTLY UNDER           
CONSTRUCTION.                   
WE&amp;apos;RE UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR    

00:45:23.737 --> 00:45:26.604
CONSTRUCTION.                   
WE&amp;apos;RE UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR    
RIGHT NOW.                      

00:45:26.606 --> 00:45:27.539
WE&amp;apos;RE UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR    
RIGHT NOW.                      
IT IS PLANNED TO BE COMPLETE    

00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:30.242
RIGHT NOW.                      
IT IS PLANNED TO BE COMPLETE    
AND THE RESTAURANT OPERATIONAL

BEFORE THEY TEAR DOWN THE       
CADILLAC BUILDING.              
SO WE WILL HAVE FIRE            

00:45:34.581 --> 00:45:37.649
CADILLAC BUILDING.              
SO WE WILL HAVE FIRE            
SUPPRESSION OCCUPANCY EXITING   

00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:42.020
SO WE WILL HAVE FIRE            
SUPPRESSION OCCUPANCY EXITING   
FROM THAT BUILDING UNTIL THE    

00:45:42.022 --> 00:45:42.754

RESTROOMS ARE COMPLETE AND THEN 

00:45:42.756 --> 00:45:45.957
FROM THAT BUILDING UNTIL THE    
RESTROOMS ARE COMPLETE AND THEN 
THE RESTROOMS AND THE SIX       

00:45:45.959 --> 00:45:46.758
RESTROOMS ARE COMPLETE AND THEN 
THE RESTROOMS AND THE SIX       
THIRTY IS WASHINGTON BUILDING

THIRTY IS WASHINGTON BUILDING   
WILL BE OPEN.                   
SO THAT WOULD BE ALSO ANOTHER   

00:45:49.296 --> 00:45:50.195
WILL BE OPEN.                   
SO THAT WOULD BE ALSO ANOTHER   
CAVEAT TO THIS CORRIDOR IF
