IT&apos;S JUST A QUICK QUESTION.     

01:08:10.937 --> 01:08:14.171
A A GENEROUS WINDOW.

I JUST WONDER IS ANY OF THIS    
DATA SEGMENTED SO THAT I KNOW   

01:08:17.977 --> 01:08:18.643
I JUST WONDER IS ANY OF THIS    
DATA SEGMENTED SO THAT I KNOW   
WE&apos;VE SEGMENTED OUR OWN RACE    

01:08:18.645 --> 01:08:19.443
DATA SEGMENTED SO THAT I KNOW   
WE&apos;VE SEGMENTED OUR OWN RACE    
POSSIBLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE   

01:08:19.445 --> 01:08:21.746
WE&apos;VE SEGMENTED OUR OWN RACE    
POSSIBLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE

ANY UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT  
POPULATIONS LIKE THE HOMELESS   

01:08:25.618 --> 01:08:26.216
ANY UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT  
POPULATIONS LIKE THE HOMELESS   
POPULATION, YOUNG PEOPLE,       

01:08:26.218 --> 01:08:30.220
POPULATIONS LIKE THE HOMELESS   
POPULATION, YOUNG PEOPLE,       
STUDENT, ANY KIND

STUDENT, ANY KIND               
OF INFORMATION LIKE THAT THAT   

01:08:30.923 --> 01:08:33.791
STUDENT, ANY KIND               
OF INFORMATION LIKE THAT THAT   
SEGMENTS THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO 

01:08:33.793 --> 01:08:36.861
OF INFORMATION LIKE THAT THAT   
SEGMENTS THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO 
SAY THIS MANY INTERACTIONS      

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:37.728
SEGMENTS THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO 
SAY THIS MANY INTERACTIONS      
THESE KIND OF INTERACTIONS WERE 

01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:41.098
SAY THIS MANY INTERACTIONS      
THESE KIND OF INTERACTIONS WERE 
WITH STUDENTS OR HOMELESS       

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.132
THESE KIND OF INTERACTIONS WERE 
WITH STUDENTS OR HOMELESS

01:08:42.134 --> 01:08:42.567
WITH STUDENTS OR HOMELESS

PEOPLE OR ANY OF THOSE KIND     
OF POPULATIONS.                 
SO THE BEST PART IS I KNOW THE  

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:49.106
OF POPULATIONS.                 
SO THE BEST PART IS I KNOW THE  
OPPORTUNITY TO NOT RECORD A     

01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:52.943
SO THE BEST PART IS I KNOW THE  
OPPORTUNITY TO NOT RECORD A     
PERSON&apos;S HOUSING STATUS DURING  

01:08:52.945 --> 01:08:53.511
OPPORTUNITY TO NOT RECORD A     
PERSON&apos;S HOUSING STATUS DURING  
A TRAFFIC STOP.                 

01:08:53.513 --> 01:08:56.114
PERSON&apos;S HOUSING STATUS DURING  
A TRAFFIC STOP.                 
ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS      

01:08:56.116 --> 01:09:00.151
A TRAFFIC STOP.                 
ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS      
ALREADY OF THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS 

01:09:00.153 --> 01:09:01.085
ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS      
ALREADY OF THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS 
BEEN THAT UNTIL WE STARTED THIS 

01:09:01.087 --> 01:09:04.788
ALREADY OF THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS 
BEEN THAT UNTIL WE STARTED THIS 
PROCESS WITH THE OTHER PD IT    

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:05.423
BEEN THAT UNTIL WE STARTED THIS 
PROCESS WITH THE OTHER PD IT    
WAS IMPOSSIBLE ACTUALLY FOR     

01:09:05.425 --> 01:09:08.626
PROCESS WITH THE OTHER PD IT    
WAS IMPOSSIBLE ACTUALLY FOR     
THEM TO REPORT THE AGE OF THE   

01:09:08.628 --> 01:09:11.929
WAS IMPOSSIBLE ACTUALLY FOR     
THEM TO REPORT THE AGE OF THE   
PERSON STOPPED ALONG WITH IT.   

01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:13.131
THEM TO REPORT THE AGE OF THE   
PERSON STOPPED ALONG WITH IT.   
AND SO THAT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO  

01:09:13.133 --> 01:09:16.000
PERSON STOPPED ALONG WITH IT.   
AND SO THAT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO  
DO UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL NOT BE 

01:09:16.002 --> 01:09:16.600
AND SO THAT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO  
DO UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL NOT BE 
PART OF THIS ANALYSIS.          

01:09:16.602 --> 01:09:18.870
DO UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL NOT BE 
PART OF THIS ANALYSIS.          
IT CAN BE PART OF FUTURE        

01:09:18.872 --> 01:09:19.337

HIGH ON THE LIST OF THINGS TO

AND NOW THAT THERE SEEMS LIKE   
THERE IS A BIT IT WOULD SEEM    

01:10:44.623 --> 01:10:46.991
AND NOW THAT THERE SEEMS LIKE   
THERE IS A BIT IT WOULD SEEM    
THAT SINCE WE ARE SORT OF THE

THAT NUMBER MIGHT SEEM VERY     
SMALL TO YOU.

ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ESPECIALLY 
GIVEN THAT THE DATA SAYS THAT   
DR. KARPIAK AND I WERE PRIVY TO

HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND      
STOPS ON THEM ALSO RETIRED IN   

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:17.427
HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND      
STOPS ON THEM ALSO RETIRED IN   
OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT PERSON

FOUR HUNDRED OF THESE AND SO    

01:20:22.435 --> 01:20:25.235
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST    
FOUR HUNDRED OF THESE AND SO    
NINETEEN HUNDRED SEEM SMALL.    

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:29.039
FOUR HUNDRED OF THESE AND SO    
NINETEEN HUNDRED SEEM SMALL.    
SO THE QUESTION THAT POSED WHAT 

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:29.973
NINETEEN HUNDRED SEEM SMALL.    
SO THE QUESTION THAT POSED WHAT 
THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS THAT    

01:20:29.975 --> 01:20:30.840
SO THE QUESTION THAT POSED WHAT 
THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS THAT    
COME UP FROM THAT NO ONE IS     

01:20:30.842 --> 01:20:33.744
THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS THAT    
COME UP FROM THAT NO ONE IS     
FROM DO THESE NUMBERS ARISE ON  

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:34.277
COME UP FROM THAT NO ONE IS     
FROM DO THESE NUMBERS ARISE ON  
THE DASHBOARD?                  

01:20:34.279 --> 01:20:37.213
FROM DO THESE NUMBERS ARISE ON  
THE DASHBOARD?                  
WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?        

01:20:37.215 --> 01:20:38.314
THE DASHBOARD?                  
WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?        
BECAUSE I KNOW IN DEARBORN THEY 

01:20:38.316 --> 01:20:41.618
WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?        
BECAUSE I KNOW IN DEARBORN THEY 
COME DIRECTLY THEY ARE PULLED   

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:42.319
BECAUSE I KNOW IN DEARBORN THEY 
COME DIRECTLY THEY ARE PULLED   
FROM THE CLEMINS THAT DATABASE  

01:20:42.321 --> 01:20:44.988
COME DIRECTLY THEY ARE PULLED   
FROM THE CLEMINS THAT DATABASE  
DEARBORN DOES NOT DO ANYTHING   

01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.389
FROM THE CLEMINS THAT DATABASE  
DEARBORN DOES NOT DO ANYTHING   
TO THEM.                        

01:20:45.391 --> 01:20:46.123
DEARBORN DOES NOT DO ANYTHING   
TO THEM.                        
THEY DON&apos;T MASSAGE THEM.        

01:20:46.125 --> 01:20:49.225
TO THEM.                        
THEY DON&apos;T MASSAGE THEM.        
JEANNE SHAHEEN WAS VERY CLEAR.  

01:20:49.227 --> 01:20:50.227
THEY DON&apos;T MASSAGE THEM.        
JEANNE SHAHEEN WAS VERY CLEAR.  
THEY JUST ARE ABLE TO PULL THEM 

01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:52.496
JEANNE SHAHEEN WAS VERY CLEAR.  
THEY JUST ARE ABLE TO PULL THEM 
IN AND THEY SHOW UP SO THEY ARE 

01:20:52.498 --> 01:20:53.029
THEY JUST ARE ABLE TO PULL THEM 
IN AND THEY SHOW UP SO THEY ARE 
WHAT THEY ARE.                  

01:20:53.031 --> 01:20:54.130
IN AND THEY SHOW UP SO THEY ARE 
WHAT THEY ARE.                  
AND SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE    

01:20:54.132 --> 01:20:56.900
WHAT THEY ARE.                  
AND SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE    
FROM WHERE DO THESE DATA COME   

01:20:56.902 --> 01:20:57.634
AND SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE    
FROM WHERE DO THESE DATA COME   
AND THEN DO THEY USE THAT       

01:20:57.636 --> 01:21:00.204
FROM WHERE DO THESE DATA COME   
AND THEN DO THEY USE THAT       
PROCESS BECAUSE NINETEEN THIRTY 

01:21:00.206 --> 01:21:01.071
AND THEN DO THEY USE THAT       
PROCESS BECAUSE NINETEEN THIRTY 
NINE SEEMS REALLY SMALL AND IF  

01:21:01.073 --> 01:21:04.474
PROCESS BECAUSE NINETEEN THIRTY 
NINE SEEMS REALLY SMALL AND IF  
IT IS REALLY SMALL THAT RAISES  

01:21:04.476 --> 01:21:05.142
NINE SEEMS REALLY SMALL AND IF  
IT IS REALLY SMALL THAT RAISES  
A DIFFERENT QUESTION ABOUT WHY  

01:21:05.144 --> 01:21:08.645
IT IS REALLY SMALL THAT RAISES  
A DIFFERENT QUESTION ABOUT WHY  
THERE MIGHT ON AVERAGE FIFTEEN  

01:21:08.647 --> 01:21:09.346
A DIFFERENT QUESTION ABOUT WHY  
THERE MIGHT ON AVERAGE FIFTEEN  
THOUSAND TRAFFIC STOPS BUT ONLY 

01:21:09.348 --> 01:21:12.115
THERE MIGHT ON AVERAGE FIFTEEN  
THOUSAND TRAFFIC STOPS BUT ONLY 
NINETEEN THIRTY NINE CITATIONS  

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:12.983

01:21:16.855 --> 01:21:17.654
KIND OF QUESTION BUT I DID WANT 
TO RAISE THAT.                  
I KNOW OUR DASHBOARD IS NEW.
