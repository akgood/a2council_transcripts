THERE&amp;apos;S A PATHWAY THAT GOES     
BASICALLY FROM BETWEEN THE TWO  

01:39:02.061 --> 01:39:03.961
THERE&amp;apos;S A PATHWAY THAT GOES

JUST JOINT SIDES OF FAIR STREET 

01:39:03.963 --> 01:39:04.829

JUST JOINT SIDES OF FAIR STREET 
BECAUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE 

01:39:04.831 --> 01:39:07.898
JUST JOINT SIDES OF FAIR STREET 
BECAUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE 
VERY USEFUL IMPORTANT           

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:08.632
BECAUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE 
VERY USEFUL IMPORTANT           
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE   

01:39:08.634 --> 01:39:12.169
VERY USEFUL IMPORTANT           
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:39:12.171 --> 01:39:12.903
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE   
IN OUR CITY BECAUSE OFTEN THEY  
ARE CLOSING GAPS THAT WOULD     

01:39:12.905 --> 01:39:13.638

TO GET FROM FROM ONE SIDE TO    
THE OTHER IN THESE THINGS WERE  

01:39:23.682 --> 01:39:24.314
TO GET FROM FROM ONE SIDE TO    
THE OTHER IN THESE THINGS WERE  
INCLUDED IN SITE PLANS.         

01:39:24.316 --> 01:39:27.651
THE OTHER IN THESE THINGS WERE  
INCLUDED IN SITE PLANS.         
NOW AHEAD OF TIME THE           

01:39:27.653 --> 01:39:28.186

01:39:28.188 --> 01:39:29.053
NOW AHEAD OF TIME THE

BUT IT SEEMS LOGICAL TO ASSUME  

01:39:29.055 --> 01:39:31.255

BUT IT SEEMS LOGICAL TO ASSUME  
THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS 

01:39:31.257 --> 01:39:31.989
BUT IT SEEMS LOGICAL TO ASSUME  
THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS

01:39:34.761 --> 01:39:35.626
ALSO SAID THAT THIS WOULD BE

BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHY ARE THEY  
BEING BUILT SO I FIND IT PRETTY
