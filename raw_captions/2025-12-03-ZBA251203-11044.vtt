SO IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD BE  

00:24:19.141 --> 00:24:19.773
THE QUEUE OF THE DROP OFF.      
SO IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD BE  
A BUILDABLE THAT BOTTOM RIGHT

>> BUT THE WHOLE PARKING LOT IS 
BEING IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S    

00:28:27.155 --> 00:28:27.987
>> BUT THE WHOLE PARKING LOT IS 
BEING IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S    
BEEN VILE SWAILS ADDED AND SO   

00:28:27.989 --> 00:28:30.757
BEING IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S    
BEEN VILE SWAILS ADDED AND SO   
THE WHOLE PARKING LOT IS BEING  

00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:31.692
BEEN VILE SWAILS ADDED AND SO   
THE WHOLE PARKING LOT IS BEING  
ESSENTIALLY REMOVED AND WORK IS 

00:28:31.694 --> 00:28:34.995
THE WHOLE PARKING LOT IS BEING  
ESSENTIALLY REMOVED AND WORK IS 
BEING DONE RIGHT.               

00:28:34.997 --> 00:28:35.996
ESSENTIALLY REMOVED AND WORK IS 
BEING DONE RIGHT.               
AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARRIVED AT  

00:28:35.998 --> 00:28:37.731
BEING DONE RIGHT.               
AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARRIVED AT  
SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF REQUIRED 

00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:38.598
AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARRIVED AT  
SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF REQUIRED 
PARKING SPACES BECAUSE THE      

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.332
SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF REQUIRED 
PARKING SPACES BECAUSE THE      
WHOLE PARKING LOT IS GETTING    

00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:42.169
PARKING SPACES BECAUSE THE      
WHOLE PARKING LOT IS GETTING    
REMOVED AND REDONE AND THAT'S   

00:28:42.171 --> 00:28:45.639
WHOLE PARKING LOT IS GETTING    
REMOVED AND REDONE AND THAT'S   
KIND OF THE POINT OF THE        

00:28:45.641 --> 00:28:49.910
REMOVED AND REDONE AND THAT'S   
KIND OF THE POINT OF THE        
ORDINANCE IS RIGHT WHEN WHEN    

00:28:49.912 --> 00:28:50.710
KIND OF THE POINT OF THE        
ORDINANCE IS RIGHT WHEN WHEN    
YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE DOING MORE  

00:28:50.712 --> 00:28:51.411
ORDINANCE IS RIGHT WHEN WHEN    
YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE DOING MORE  
THAN JUST MILLING THE TOP LAYER 

00:28:51.413 --> 00:28:53.613
YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE DOING MORE  
THAN JUST MILLING THE TOP LAYER 
AND YOU KNOW, PUTTING DOWN NEW  

00:28:53.615 --> 00:28:54.014
THAN JUST MILLING THE TOP LAYER 
AND YOU KNOW, PUTTING DOWN NEW  
ASPHALT.                        

00:28:54.016 --> 00:28:54.681
AND YOU KNOW, PUTTING DOWN NEW  
ASPHALT.                        
BUT WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY        

00:28:54.683 --> 00:28:57.450
ASPHALT.                        
BUT WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY        
DIGGING IT UP AND THAT'S THE    

00:28:57.452 --> 00:28:58.218
BUT WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY        
DIGGING IT UP AND THAT'S THE    
POINT OF THE ORDINANCE IS THAT  

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.554
DIGGING IT UP AND THAT'S THE    
POINT OF THE ORDINANCE IS THAT  
THAT'S THE TIME TO INSTALL THE  

00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:03.990
POINT OF THE ORDINANCE IS THAT  
THAT'S THE TIME TO INSTALL THE  
CONDUIT BEFORE YOU PUT DOWN THE 

00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:08.195
THAT'S THE TIME TO INSTALL THE  
CONDUIT BEFORE YOU PUT DOWN THE 
NEW CONCRETE OR ASPHALT PETTY.  

00:29:08.197 --> 00:29:14.968
CONDUIT BEFORE YOU PUT DOWN THE 
NEW CONCRETE OR ASPHALT PETTY.  
SO THAT'S WHY THAT ARE SO EASY  

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:20.874
NEW CONCRETE OR ASPHALT PETTY.  
SO THAT'S WHY THAT ARE SO EASY  
FOR                             

00:29:21.743 --> 00:29:26.947
    WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU     
LOOK AT THE CURRENT STAFF WHICH 
IS AT THIRTY EIGHT, THAT MEANS  

00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:28.816
LOOK AT THE CURRENT STAFF WHICH 
IS AT THIRTY EIGHT, THAT MEANS  
AT LEAST 15 SPOTS HAVE TO BE    

00:29:28.818 --> 00:29:29.249
IS AT THIRTY EIGHT, THAT MEANS  
AT LEAST 15 SPOTS HAVE TO BE    
CAPABLE.                        

00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:33.220
AT LEAST 15 SPOTS HAVE TO BE    
CAPABLE.

00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:34.654
AND SO I'M WONDERING IF EVEN

CASE.                           
AT THE SAME TIME I SEE IT       
TOTALLY IN PARALLEL WITH WHAT   

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:06.639
AT THE SAME TIME I SEE IT       
TOTALLY IN PARALLEL WITH WHAT   
OUR DECISION WAS WITH THE ST.   

00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:07.106
TOTALLY IN PARALLEL WITH WHAT   
OUR DECISION WAS WITH THE ST.   
FRANCIS CASE.                   

00:37:07.108 --> 00:37:10.310
OUR DECISION WAS WITH THE ST.   
FRANCIS CASE.

BECAUSE IN THE ST. FRANCIS CASE 

00:37:22.257 --> 00:37:24.857
I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS        
BECAUSE IN THE ST. FRANCIS CASE 
THEY WERE NOT TEARING UP ALL    

00:37:24.859 --> 00:37:25.325
BECAUSE IN THE ST. FRANCIS CASE 
THEY WERE NOT TEARING UP ALL

THE PARKING BECAUSE IT HADN'T   
BEEN REVISED YET TO ONLY APPLY  

00:37:32.834 --> 00:37:33.666
THE PARKING BECAUSE IT HADN'T

SO THIS WILL BE A CONDO         
DEVELOPMENT OF FOUR UNITS WHICH

SO THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS THERE 
ALSO BEING BUILT IN SMALL

THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE          
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESULT      
OF INSERTING FOUR EVEN NEEDED   

01:20:30.742 --> 01:20:34.611
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESULT      
OF INSERTING FOUR EVEN NEEDED   
BUILDINGS ON THE ON THE PARCELS 

01:20:34.613 --> 01:20:34.844
OF INSERTING FOUR EVEN NEEDED   
BUILDINGS ON THE ON THE PARCELS 
.                               

01:20:34.846 --> 01:20:35.913
BUILDINGS ON THE ON THE PARCELS

01:20:38.817 --> 01:20:42.585
>> SO I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT    
THAT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE  
NEEDS TO BE AN OVERALL ANALYSIS 

01:20:42.587 --> 01:20:43.520
THAT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE  
NEEDS TO BE AN OVERALL ANALYSIS 
BECAUSE IF THESE LIGHTS KEEP    

01:20:43.522 --> 01:20:46.690
NEEDS TO BE AN OVERALL ANALYSIS 
BECAUSE IF THESE LIGHTS KEEP    
REPEATING THAT THIS APPROACH    

01:20:46.692 --> 01:20:47.791
BECAUSE IF THESE LIGHTS KEEP    
REPEATING THAT THIS APPROACH    
YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO       

01:20:47.793 --> 01:20:50.660
REPEATING THAT THIS APPROACH    
YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO       
HAPPEN TO THE ROAD DO IT AND    

01:20:50.662 --> 01:20:54.598
YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO       
HAPPEN TO THE ROAD DO IT AND    
JUST SIMPLE TRAFFIC PATTERNS    

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.599
HAPPEN TO THE ROAD DO IT AND    
JUST SIMPLE TRAFFIC PATTERNS    
AND JUST SAFE USE IT SOUNDS     

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:58.235
JUST SIMPLE TRAFFIC PATTERNS    
AND JUST SAFE USE IT SOUNDS     
LIKE THERE'S SIDEWALKS EITHER   

01:20:58.237 --> 01:21:02.372
AND JUST SAFE USE IT SOUNDS     
LIKE THERE'S SIDEWALKS EITHER   
ON THE STREET, NO SIDEWALKS.    

01:21:02.374 --> 01:21:06.543
LIKE THERE'S SIDEWALKS EITHER   
ON THE STREET, NO SIDEWALKS.    
SO IT'S I MEAN THAT THAT'S      

01:21:06.545 --> 01:21:09.346
ON THE STREET, NO SIDEWALKS.    
SO IT'S I MEAN THAT THAT'S      
CREATING A NOT CONDUCIVE SAFE   

01:21:09.348 --> 01:21:09.746
SO IT'S I MEAN THAT THAT'S      
CREATING A NOT CONDUCIVE SAFE   
ENVIRONMENT.                    

01:21:09.748 --> 01:21:13.750
CREATING A NOT CONDUCIVE SAFE   
ENVIRONMENT.                    
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE  

01:21:13.752 --> 01:21:17.020
ENVIRONMENT.                    
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE  
RIGHT ON PAPER.                 

01:21:17.022 --> 01:21:18.088
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE  
RIGHT ON PAPER.                 
I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE AN        

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:20.791

I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE AN        
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO INSERT     

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:21.458
I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE AN        
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO INSERT     
THESE FOUR RESIDENCES.          

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:25.529
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO INSERT     
THESE FOUR RESIDENCES.          
BUT IN REALITY I THINK I THINK  

01:21:25.531 --> 01:21:29.099
THESE FOUR RESIDENCES.          
BUT IN REALITY I THINK I THINK  
THERE'S A BIG DISCONNECT.       

01:21:29.101 --> 01:21:29.967
BUT IN REALITY I THINK I THINK  
THERE'S A BIG DISCONNECT.       
>> I APPRECIATE WHAT THE        

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:33.504

01:21:48.187 --> 01:21:49.386
NEIGHBORHOOD AND SETTING A      
STANDARD TO THANKS JULIE.       
I THINK TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A  

01:21:49.388 --> 01:21:52.455
STANDARD TO THANKS JULIE.       
I THINK TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A
