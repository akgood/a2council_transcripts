WORSE THAN WHAT IT ALREADY IS   
AND TO INSTALL A RAMP YOU WOULD 
HAVE TO PUT A LEVEL LANDING PAD

AND TO INSTALL A RAMP YOU WOULD 
HAVE TO PUT A LEVEL LANDING PAD 
IN THAT SIDEWALK WHICH THEN     

00:54:44.574 --> 00:54:45.440
HAVE TO PUT A LEVEL LANDING PAD 
IN THAT SIDEWALK WHICH THEN

WAY TO MAKE A RAMP WORK AND WE  
THEN LOOKED AT PUTTING A RAMP,  
YOU KNOW, THAT WENT DEEPER INTO

SOME OF THOSE SLOPES AND THINGS 

00:55:31.154 --> 00:55:34.322

SOME OF THOSE SLOPES AND THINGS 
YOU CAN GIVE MORE SPACE TO GIVE 

00:55:34.324 --> 00:55:35.190
SOME OF THOSE SLOPES AND THINGS 
YOU CAN GIVE MORE SPACE TO GIVE 
A PEDESTRIAN PATH AND DESIGNING 

00:55:35.192 --> 00:55:38.860
YOU CAN GIVE MORE SPACE TO GIVE 
A PEDESTRIAN PATH AND DESIGNING 
PERSON DOORS TO THE GARAGE      

00:55:38.862 --> 00:55:39.260
A PEDESTRIAN PATH AND DESIGNING 
PERSON DOORS TO THE GARAGE

01:12:07.016 --> 01:12:10.651
HAVE TO CREATE A LEVEL LANDING  
AREA OUT IN HERE.               
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT THAT MAKES 

01:12:10.653 --> 01:12:11.118
AREA OUT IN HERE.               
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT THAT MAKES 
A FLAT SPOT.                    

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.319
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT THAT MAKES 
A FLAT SPOT.                    
SO WHEN YOU DO THAT THEN IT     

01:12:12.321 --> 01:12:14.522
A FLAT SPOT.                    
SO WHEN YOU DO THAT THEN IT     
MAKES THE OF THE SIDEWALK EVEN  

01:12:14.524 --> 01:12:17.725
SO WHEN YOU DO THAT THEN IT     
MAKES THE OF THE SIDEWALK EVEN  
WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS.       

01:12:17.727 --> 01:12:18.692
MAKES THE OF THE SIDEWALK EVEN  
WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE LOOKED AT THAT.        

01:12:18.694 --> 01:12:21.661
WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE LOOKED AT THAT.        
WE ALSO LOOKED AT TRYING TO     

01:12:21.663 --> 01:12:25.632
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE LOOKED AT THAT.        
WE ALSO LOOKED AT TRYING TO     
GIVE IT A RAMP ALONG HERE.      

01:12:25.634 --> 01:12:26.834
WE ALSO LOOKED AT TRYING TO     
GIVE IT A RAMP ALONG HERE.      
IN FACT, WE LOOKED AT A COUPLE  

01:12:26.836 --> 01:12:27.634
GIVE IT A RAMP ALONG HERE.      
IN FACT, WE LOOKED AT A COUPLE  
OF DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS TO  

01:12:27.636 --> 01:12:29.002
IN FACT, WE LOOKED AT A COUPLE  
OF DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS TO  
TRY TO GET A RAMP ON THERE.     

01:12:29.004 --> 01:12:30.137
OF DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS TO  
TRY TO GET A RAMP ON THERE.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU CUT 

01:12:30.139 --> 01:12:32.807
TRY TO GET A RAMP ON THERE.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU CUT 
INTO THE GARAGE SPACE AND YOU   

01:12:32.809 --> 01:12:36.943
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU CUT 
INTO THE GARAGE SPACE AND YOU   
CAN NO LONGER HAVE THE SPACE    

01:12:36.945 --> 01:12:37.678
INTO THE GARAGE SPACE AND YOU   
CAN NO LONGER HAVE THE SPACE    
THAT YOU HAVE A GARAGE BECAUSE  

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.714
CAN NO LONGER HAVE THE SPACE    
THAT YOU HAVE A GARAGE BECAUSE  
IT&amp;apos;S THE RAMP WOULD START HERE  

01:12:40.716 --> 01:12:41.882
THAT YOU HAVE A GARAGE BECAUSE  
IT&amp;apos;S THE RAMP WOULD START HERE  
AS OPPOSED TO AND IT WOULD HAVE 

01:12:41.884 --> 01:12:45.119
IT&amp;apos;S THE RAMP WOULD START HERE  
AS OPPOSED TO AND IT WOULD HAVE 
TO GO THROUGH THE GARAGE AND    

01:12:45.121 --> 01:12:48.922
AS OPPOSED TO AND IT WOULD HAVE 
TO GO THROUGH THE GARAGE AND    
THEN COME UP AND AS YOU&amp;apos;RE      

01:12:48.924 --> 01:12:49.690
TO GO THROUGH THE GARAGE AND    
THEN COME UP AND AS YOU&amp;apos;RE      
COMING UP YOU&amp;apos;D GET TO A PATIO  

01:12:49.692 --> 01:12:51.591
THEN COME UP AND AS YOU&amp;apos;RE      
COMING UP YOU&amp;apos;D GET TO A PATIO  
LEVEL BUT IT WOULD IMPACT       

01:12:51.593 --> 01:12:57.898
COMING UP YOU&amp;apos;D GET TO A PATIO  
LEVEL BUT IT WOULD IMPACT       
GARAGE FOR SURE

I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE WITH  
THIS BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING    
GRIDS OUT THERE AT THE SIDEWALK 

01:25:11.166 --> 01:25:11.964
THIS BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING    
GRIDS OUT THERE AT THE SIDEWALK

INTO THEIR PROJECTS.            

02:31:21.098 --> 02:31:22.131
INCORPORATING SUSTAINABILITY    
INTO THEIR PROJECTS.            
CONTINUING TO DO THAT IS GOING  

02:31:22.133 --> 02:31:25.134
INTO THEIR PROJECTS.            
CONTINUING TO DO THAT IS GOING  
TO BE REALLY BENEFICIAL FOR THE 

02:31:25.136 --> 02:31:25.401
CONTINUING TO DO THAT IS GOING  
TO BE REALLY BENEFICIAL FOR THE 
SIU.                            

02:31:25.403 --> 02:31:28.838
TO BE REALLY BENEFICIAL FOR THE 
SIU.                            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE THE MORE THAT WE CAN     

02:31:28.840 --> 02:31:29.905
SIU.                            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE THE MORE THAT WE CAN     
BUILD OUR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND  

02:31:29.907 --> 02:31:33.475
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE THE MORE THAT WE CAN     
BUILD OUR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND  
RETROFIT PROJECTS CORRECTLY AND 

02:31:33.477 --> 02:31:37.113
BUILD OUR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND  
RETROFIT PROJECTS CORRECTLY AND 
REALLY INCORPORATE AS MUCH      

02:31:37.115 --> 02:31:37.914
RETROFIT PROJECTS CORRECTLY AND 
REALLY INCORPORATE AS MUCH      
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE        

02:31:37.916 --> 02:31:41.950
REALLY INCORPORATE AS MUCH      
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE        
PROCESS AT THE GET GO REDUCES   

02:31:41.952 --> 02:31:45.788
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE        
PROCESS AT THE GET GO REDUCES   
THE COST BURDEN ON BOTH THE CEO 

02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:48.324
PROCESS AT THE GET GO REDUCES   
THE COST BURDEN ON BOTH THE CEO 
AND RESIDENTS IN THE LONG RUN.  

02:31:48.326 --> 02:31:49.425
THE COST BURDEN ON BOTH THE CEO 
AND RESIDENTS IN THE LONG RUN.  
SO I THINK THE PLANNING         

02:31:49.427 --> 02:31:50.059
AND RESIDENTS IN THE LONG RUN.  
SO I THINK THE PLANNING         
COMMISSION IS REALLY DOING A    

02:31:50.061 --> 02:31:52.227
SO I THINK THE PLANNING         
COMMISSION IS REALLY DOING A    
GOOD JOB OF THAT.               

02:31:52.229 --> 02:31:56.032
COMMISSION IS REALLY DOING A    
GOOD JOB OF THAT.               
I I DON&amp;apos;T BELIEVE I WOULD I     

02:31:56.034 --> 02:31:57.233
GOOD JOB OF THAT.               
I I DON&amp;apos;T BELIEVE I WOULD I     
WOULD SAY MY MY NATURAL MY      

02:31:57.235 --> 02:32:00.669
I I DON&amp;apos;T BELIEVE I WOULD I     
WOULD SAY MY MY NATURAL MY      
INSTINCT TO ENCOURAGING MORE    

02:32:00.671 --> 02:32:03.439
WOULD SAY MY MY NATURAL MY      
INSTINCT TO ENCOURAGING MORE    
SOLAR BUT THIS IS SOMETHING     

02:32:03.441 --> 02:32:04.306
INSTINCT TO ENCOURAGING MORE    
SOLAR BUT THIS IS SOMETHING     
THAT EVEN WHETHER OR NOT THE    

02:32:04.308 --> 02:32:05.108
SOLAR BUT THIS IS SOMETHING     
THAT EVEN WHETHER OR NOT THE    
PLANNING COMMISSION DOES THAT   

02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:07.910
THAT EVEN WHETHER OR NOT THE    
PLANNING COMMISSION DOES THAT   
IF THE SIU PASSES THAT&amp;apos;S        

02:32:07.912 --> 02:32:08.678
PLANNING COMMISSION DOES THAT   
IF THE SIU PASSES THAT&amp;apos;S        
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PURSUE   

02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:11.848
IF THE SIU PASSES THAT&amp;apos;S        
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PURSUE   
ON ITS OWN THROUGH ITS OWN      

02:32:11.850 --> 02:32:12.148
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PURSUE   
ON ITS OWN THROUGH ITS OWN      
MEANS.                          

02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:16.218
ON ITS OWN THROUGH ITS OWN      
MEANS.                          
SO I WOULD JUST SAY KEEP UP THE 

02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:19.055
MEANS.

02:32:19.791 --> 02:32:22.357
GOOD WORK AND I&amp;apos;LL JUST         
ENCOURAGING AS MUCH SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT AS POSSIBLE.        

02:32:22.359 --> 02:32:22.725
ENCOURAGING AS MUCH SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT AS POSSIBLE.        
GREAT.                          

02:32:22.727 --> 02:32:23.592
DEVELOPMENT AS POSSIBLE.        
GREAT.

02:32:26.264 --> 02:32:27.129
AND THE COMMENT THAT I WOULD    
GIVE IT ALONG WITH THAT IS THAT 
I WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND     

02:32:27.131 --> 02:32:27.663

I WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND     
ABOUT WHAT HOW I WOULD

THING THAT I THINK OF IS        
ADDITIONAL LIKE OPPORTUNITIES   

02:32:31.335 --> 02:32:34.970
THING THAT I THINK OF IS        
ADDITIONAL LIKE OPPORTUNITIES   
FOR SOLAR AND SO FRONT YARD     

02:32:34.972 --> 02:32:35.638
ADDITIONAL LIKE OPPORTUNITIES   
FOR SOLAR AND SO FRONT YARD     
SOLAR MIGHT COME UP IN THE      

02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:37.539
FOR SOLAR AND SO FRONT YARD     
SOLAR MIGHT COME UP IN THE      
WORKPLACE DISCUSSION ANYTHING   

02:32:37.541 --> 02:32:41.778
SOLAR MIGHT COME UP IN THE      
WORKPLACE DISCUSSION ANYTHING   
ELSE GO COMMISSIONER.           

02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:42.912
WORKPLACE DISCUSSION ANYTHING   
ELSE GO COMMISSIONER.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO BY THE FRONT YOUR SOLAR   

02:32:42.914 --> 02:32:45.681
ELSE GO COMMISSIONER.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO BY THE FRONT YOUR SOLAR   
WAS GOING TO WHAT ARE MY        

02:32:45.683 --> 02:32:46.281
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO BY THE FRONT YOUR SOLAR   
WAS GOING TO WHAT ARE MY        
COMMENTS TO LOOK AT?            

02:32:46.283 --> 02:32:49.552
WAS GOING TO WHAT ARE MY        
COMMENTS TO LOOK AT?            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MEAN THIS REALLY DOES      

02:32:49.554 --> 02:32:50.553
COMMENTS TO LOOK AT?            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MEAN THIS REALLY DOES      
RAISE KIND OF A LOT OF LAND USE 

02:32:50.555 --> 02:32:53.055
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MEAN THIS REALLY DOES      
RAISE KIND OF A LOT OF LAND USE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE   

02:32:53.057 --> 02:32:53.789
RAISE KIND OF A LOT OF LAND USE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE   
ADDRESSED IT A BIT IN BUILDING  

02:32:53.791 --> 02:32:56.658
QUESTIONS ABOUT I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE   
ADDRESSED IT A BIT IN BUILDING  
RIGHT FRONT YARD SOLAR.         

02:32:56.660 --> 02:32:57.860
ADDRESSED IT A BIT IN BUILDING  
RIGHT FRONT YARD SOLAR.         
BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT     

02:32:57.862 --> 02:32:58.528
RIGHT FRONT YARD SOLAR.         
BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT     
OF CONDITIONS WHERE WE CAN      

02:32:58.530 --> 02:33:00.963
BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT     
OF CONDITIONS WHERE WE CAN      
PROBABLY IMPROVE OUR LAND USE   

02:33:00.965 --> 02:33:01.597
OF CONDITIONS WHERE WE CAN      
PROBABLY IMPROVE OUR LAND USE   
STRATEGIES TO LAYER THIS IN.    

02:33:01.599 --> 02:33:05.034
PROBABLY IMPROVE OUR LAND USE   
STRATEGIES TO LAYER THIS IN.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO DO IS   

02:33:05.036 --> 02:33:07.436
STRATEGIES TO LAYER THIS IN.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO DO IS   
INCENTIVIZE LOSING TREES TO     

02:33:07.438 --> 02:33:08.270
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO DO IS   
INCENTIVIZE LOSING TREES TO     
REDUCING SHADE TO GAIN SOLAR AS 

02:33:08.272 --> 02:33:08.504
INCENTIVIZE LOSING TREES TO     
REDUCING SHADE TO GAIN SOLAR AS 
WELL.                           

02:33:08.506 --> 02:33:12.274
REDUCING SHADE TO GAIN SOLAR AS 
WELL.                           
SO I&amp;apos;M NOT REALLY SURE LIKE ALL 

02:33:12.276 --> 02:33:13.108
WELL.                           
SO I&amp;apos;M NOT REALLY SURE LIKE ALL 
THE CURSORY REVIEW THROUGH OUR  

02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:16.079
SO I&amp;apos;M NOT REALLY SURE LIKE ALL 
THE CURSORY REVIEW THROUGH OUR  
UDC TO MAKE SURE WE&amp;apos;RE          

02:33:16.081 --> 02:33:16.612
THE CURSORY REVIEW THROUGH OUR  
UDC TO MAKE SURE WE&amp;apos;RE          
BALANCING THAT.                 

02:33:16.614 --> 02:33:20.249
UDC TO MAKE SURE WE&amp;apos;RE          
BALANCING THAT.                 
BUT THERE IS KIND OF WHERE WE   

02:33:20.251 --> 02:33:22.384
BALANCING THAT.                 
BUT THERE IS KIND OF WHERE WE   
MIGHT WILL GIVE VARIANCES.      

02:33:22.386 --> 02:33:26.855
BUT THERE IS KIND OF WHERE WE   
MIGHT WILL GIVE VARIANCES.      
WHAT OF MY THIS BALANCING ACT   

02:33:26.857 --> 02:33:30.726
MIGHT WILL GIVE VARIANCES.      
WHAT OF MY THIS BALANCING ACT   
OF OVER IMPROVING BUILDING      

02:33:30.728 --> 02:33:31.260
WHAT OF MY THIS BALANCING ACT   
OF OVER IMPROVING BUILDING      
STOCK THAT MIGHT HAVE           

02:33:31.262 --> 02:33:34.363
OF OVER IMPROVING BUILDING      
STOCK THAT MIGHT HAVE           
OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGHER DENSITY  

02:33:34.365 --> 02:33:35.230
STOCK THAT MIGHT HAVE           
OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGHER DENSITY  
AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT SWEET     

02:33:35.232 --> 02:33:35.698
OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGHER DENSITY  
AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT SWEET     
SPOT MIGHT BE.                  

02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:36.299
AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT SWEET     
SPOT MIGHT BE.                  
WE UNDERSTAND THE EMBODIED      

02:33:36.301 --> 02:33:38.768
SPOT MIGHT BE.                  
WE UNDERSTAND THE EMBODIED      
ENERGY AND VALUE OF EXISTING    

02:33:38.770 --> 02:33:39.535
WE UNDERSTAND THE EMBODIED      
ENERGY AND VALUE OF EXISTING    
BUILDINGS BEING RENOVATED BUT   

02:33:39.537 --> 02:33:42.505
ENERGY AND VALUE OF EXISTING    
BUILDINGS BEING RENOVATED BUT   
SOME OF THEM ARE KIND OF BEYOND 

02:33:42.507 --> 02:33:43.505
BUILDINGS BEING RENOVATED BUT   
SOME OF THEM ARE KIND OF BEYOND 
THEIR YEARS AND VERY LEAKY AND  

02:33:43.507 --> 02:33:45.774
SOME OF THEM ARE KIND OF BEYOND 
THEIR YEARS AND VERY LEAKY AND  
ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND SO EVEN 

02:33:45.776 --> 02:33:49.479
THEIR YEARS AND VERY LEAKY AND  
ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND SO EVEN 
A STUDY OF YOU KNOW, WHEN WE    

02:33:49.481 --> 02:33:50.346
ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND SO EVEN 
A STUDY OF YOU KNOW, WHEN WE    
SHOULD BE IMPROVING AND ADDING  

02:33:50.348 --> 02:33:51.013
A STUDY OF YOU KNOW, WHEN WE    
SHOULD BE IMPROVING AND ADDING  
TO THAT SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE  

02:33:51.015 --> 02:33:53.449
SHOULD BE IMPROVING AND ADDING  
TO THAT SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE  
VERSUS WHEN WE SHOULD SAY       

02:33:53.451 --> 02:33:54.183
TO THAT SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE  
VERSUS WHEN WE SHOULD SAY       
OPPORTUNITIES OF EIGHT STAR     

02:33:54.185 --> 02:33:56.819
VERSUS WHEN WE SHOULD SAY       
OPPORTUNITIES OF EIGHT STAR     
UNIT UNITS DOWNTOWN IS ADDING   

02:33:56.821 --> 02:33:57.587
OPPORTUNITIES OF EIGHT STAR     
UNIT UNITS DOWNTOWN IS ADDING   
DENSITY WITH SOLAR ON TOP.      

02:33:57.589 --> 02:34:00.522
UNIT UNITS DOWNTOWN IS ADDING   
DENSITY WITH SOLAR ON TOP.      
SO I THINK FOR US IF THERE&amp;apos;S    

02:34:00.524 --> 02:34:01.323
DENSITY WITH SOLAR ON TOP.      
SO I THINK FOR US IF THERE&amp;apos;S    
ANY ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS INTO    

02:34:01.325 --> 02:34:01.991
SO I THINK FOR US IF THERE&amp;apos;S    
ANY ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS INTO    
THAT SORT OF LAND USE STRATEGY  

02:34:01.993 --> 02:34:04.693
ANY ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS INTO    
THAT SORT OF LAND USE STRATEGY  
PLANNING WE CAN DO WOULD BE     

02:34:04.695 --> 02:34:05.294
THAT SORT OF LAND USE STRATEGY  
PLANNING WE CAN DO WOULD BE     
REALLY, REALLY HELPFUL.         

02:34:05.296 --> 02:34:06.162
PLANNING WE CAN DO WOULD BE     
REALLY, REALLY HELPFUL.         
THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT I ALSO   

02:34:06.164 --> 02:34:09.098
REALLY, REALLY HELPFUL.         
THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT I ALSO   
HAVE IS MY UNDERSTANDING        

02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:12.635
THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT I ALSO   
HAVE IS MY UNDERSTANDING        
ESPECIALLY IN KIND OF SINGLE    

02:34:12.637 --> 02:34:16.072
HAVE IS MY UNDERSTANDING        
ESPECIALLY IN KIND OF SINGLE    
FAMILY FINANCING IS IF THERE IS 

02:34:16.074 --> 02:34:17.005
ESPECIALLY IN KIND OF SINGLE    
FAMILY FINANCING IS IF THERE IS 
PRIVATE SOLAR AND IT&amp;apos;S FINANCED 

02:34:17.007 --> 02:34:20.076
FAMILY FINANCING IS IF THERE IS 
PRIVATE SOLAR AND IT&amp;apos;S FINANCED 
SEPARATELY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN     

02:34:20.078 --> 02:34:20.809
PRIVATE SOLAR AND IT&amp;apos;S FINANCED 
SEPARATELY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN     
HAVING ISSUES REFINANCING SO    

02:34:20.811 --> 02:34:24.113
SEPARATELY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN     
HAVING ISSUES REFINANCING SO    
ANY CONVERSATION INS WITH       

02:34:24.115 --> 02:34:24.846
HAVING ISSUES REFINANCING SO    
ANY CONVERSATION INS WITH       
BANKING AROUND MORTGAGE AND     

02:34:24.848 --> 02:34:27.850
ANY CONVERSATION INS WITH       
BANKING AROUND MORTGAGE AND     
REFINANCING LIABILITIES         

02:34:27.852 --> 02:34:28.784
BANKING AROUND MORTGAGE AND     
REFINANCING LIABILITIES         
OF BEING ABLE TO REFINANCE OR   

02:34:28.786 --> 02:34:32.053
REFINANCING LIABILITIES         
OF BEING ABLE TO REFINANCE OR   
SELL YOUR HOUSE WHEN            

02:34:32.055 --> 02:34:32.588

SELL YOUR HOUSE WHEN            
SOMETHING&amp;apos;S ON THERE?           
I&amp;apos;VE SEEN THOSE CONDITIONS

SOMETHING&amp;apos;S ON THERE?           
I&amp;apos;VE SEEN THOSE CONDITIONS      
BEFORE SO THAT SORT OF BANKING  

02:34:35.893 --> 02:34:39.628
I&amp;apos;VE SEEN THOSE CONDITIONS      
BEFORE SO THAT SORT OF BANKING  
ISSUE MIGHT COME UP IN FIGURING 

02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:40.429
BEFORE SO THAT SORT OF BANKING  
ISSUE MIGHT COME UP IN FIGURING 
LOCAL BANKS MIGHT BE MORE IN    

02:34:40.431 --> 02:34:43.466
ISSUE MIGHT COME UP IN FIGURING 
LOCAL BANKS MIGHT BE MORE IN    
TUNE TO HOW THIS STRUCTURE      

02:34:43.468 --> 02:34:44.566
LOCAL BANKS MIGHT BE MORE IN    
TUNE TO HOW THIS STRUCTURE      
MIGHT WORK AND BE WILLING TO    

02:34:44.568 --> 02:34:48.036
TUNE TO HOW THIS STRUCTURE      
MIGHT WORK AND BE WILLING TO    
WORK WITH HOMEOWNERS TO MAKE    

02:34:48.038 --> 02:34:48.737
MIGHT WORK AND BE WILLING TO    
WORK WITH HOMEOWNERS TO MAKE    
SURE THAT THEY DON&amp;apos;T KIND       

02:34:48.739 --> 02:34:51.474
WORK WITH HOMEOWNERS TO MAKE    
SURE THAT THEY DON&amp;apos;T KIND       
OF GET STUCK IN A CERTAIN       

02:34:51.476 --> 02:34:52.074
SURE THAT THEY DON&amp;apos;T KIND       
OF GET STUCK IN A CERTAIN       
FINANCING STRUCTURE.            

02:34:52.076 --> 02:34:52.908
OF GET STUCK IN A CERTAIN       
FINANCING STRUCTURE.            
SO I&amp;apos;VE UNDERSTOOD THAT TO

WE NEED TO RECONCILE WHERE      
WE&amp;apos;RE SAYING THERE&amp;apos;S NO         

02:50:43.359 --> 02:50:46.294
WE NEED TO RECONCILE WHERE      
WE&amp;apos;RE SAYING THERE&amp;apos;S NO         
MINIMUMS ANYWHERE BUT IF YOU DO

SOMEWHERE IN HERE ACTUALLY IS   
FOR EXAMPLE ON PRIVATE ROADS.   

02:54:40.063 --> 02:54:40.929
SOMEWHERE IN HERE ACTUALLY IS   
FOR EXAMPLE ON PRIVATE ROADS.   
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK CURRENTLY WE      

02:54:40.931 --> 02:54:41.529
FOR EXAMPLE ON PRIVATE ROADS.   
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK CURRENTLY WE      
NECESSARILY REQUIRE SIDEWALKS   

02:54:41.531 --> 02:54:43.130
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK CURRENTLY WE      
NECESSARILY REQUIRE SIDEWALKS   
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET.    

02:54:43.132 --> 02:54:43.898
NECESSARILY REQUIRE SIDEWALKS   
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET.    
SO MAKING SURE LIKE WHEN        

02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:46.568
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET.    
SO MAKING SURE LIKE WHEN

IT IS MEETING REQUIREMENTS.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT      

02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:51.506
IT IS MEETING REQUIREMENTS.     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT      
WOULD BE A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT   

02:54:51.508 --> 02:54:52.307
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT      
WOULD BE A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT

AFRICAN-AMERICAN POPULATION IN  
ANN ARBOR.                      

03:17:12.947 --> 03:17:16.315
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POPULATION IN  
ANN ARBOR.                      
TERRYTOWN WAS AN ENCLAVE THAT   

03:17:16.317 --> 03:17:17.116
ANN ARBOR.                      
TERRYTOWN WAS AN ENCLAVE THAT   
WAS CREATED BY ECONOMICS AND    

03:17:17.118 --> 03:17:23.990
TERRYTOWN WAS AN ENCLAVE THAT   
WAS CREATED BY ECONOMICS AND    
MONDESIRE LAND USES AND THEN WE 

03:17:23.992 --> 03:17:24.658
WAS CREATED BY ECONOMICS AND    
MONDESIRE LAND USES AND THEN WE 
CREATED COOPERATIVE HOUSING     

03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:28.895
MONDESIRE LAND USES AND THEN WE 
CREATED COOPERATIVE HOUSING     
WHICH IS NOT A BAD THING TO     

03:17:28.897 --> 03:17:29.229
CREATED COOPERATIVE HOUSING     
WHICH IS NOT A BAD THING TO     
HAVE.                           

03:17:29.231 --> 03:17:32.398
WHICH IS NOT A BAD THING TO     
HAVE.                           
BUT IF THAT IS ON CLOTHING FOR  

03:17:32.400 --> 03:17:33.199
HAVE.                           
BUT IF THAT IS ON CLOTHING FOR  
FOR MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND 

03:17:33.201 --> 03:17:37.170
BUT IF THAT IS ON CLOTHING FOR  
FOR MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND 
NOW MORE DIVERSE, THAT IS A     

03:17:37.172 --> 03:17:40.640
FOR MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND 
NOW MORE DIVERSE, THAT IS A     
PARTICULAR WAY OF IT&amp;apos;S NOT      

03:17:40.642 --> 03:17:41.274
NOW MORE DIVERSE, THAT IS A     
PARTICULAR WAY OF IT&amp;apos;S NOT      
TOTAL DISPLACEMENT BUT IT&amp;apos;S     

03:17:41.276 --> 03:17:44.344

TOTAL DISPLACEMENT BUT IT&amp;apos;S     
CERTAINLY NOT EQUITY.           
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE   

03:17:45.580 --> 03:17:47.881
CERTAINLY NOT EQUITY.           
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE   
ASPECTS OF OUR HISTORY THAT WE  

03:17:47.883 --> 03:17:51.384
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE   
ASPECTS OF OUR HISTORY THAT WE  
HAVE ARE GETTING SOME KIND      

03:17:51.386 --> 03:17:51.852
ASPECTS OF OUR HISTORY THAT WE  
HAVE ARE GETTING SOME KIND      
OF HANDLE ON.                   

03:17:51.854 --> 03:17:52.786
HAVE ARE GETTING SOME KIND      
OF HANDLE ON.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND OF COURSE THERE&amp;apos;S THE    

03:17:52.788 --> 03:17:55.688
OF HANDLE ON.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND OF COURSE THERE&amp;apos;S THE    
GENERAL PROBLEM OF SINGLE       

03:17:55.690 --> 03:17:56.056
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND OF COURSE THERE&amp;apos;S THE    
GENERAL PROBLEM OF SINGLE       
FAMILY ZONING.                  

03:17:56.058 --> 03:17:56.456
GENERAL PROBLEM OF SINGLE       
FAMILY ZONING.                  
ABSOLUTELY.                     

03:17:56.458 --> 03:17:59.759
FAMILY ZONING.                  
ABSOLUTELY.                     
THAT&amp;apos;S A GENERAL PROBLEM.       

03:17:59.761 --> 03:18:00.560
ABSOLUTELY.                     
THAT&amp;apos;S A GENERAL PROBLEM.       
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE&amp;apos;S ANYTHING  

03:18:00.562 --> 03:18:01.227
THAT&amp;apos;S A GENERAL PROBLEM.       
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE&amp;apos;S ANYTHING  
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING OR     

03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:03.830
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE&amp;apos;S ANYTHING  
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING OR     
UNIQUE IN ANN ARBOR ABOUT THAT  

03:18:03.832 --> 03:18:04.097
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING OR     
UNIQUE IN ANN ARBOR ABOUT THAT  
ONE.

UNIQUE IN ANN ARBOR ABOUT THAT  
ONE.                            
BUT SO WE&amp;apos;RE I THINK THAT WE    

03:18:28.489 --> 03:18:30.690
HAVE LEARNED SOME THINGS ABOUT  
THE HISTORY THAT WE CAN CARRY   
INTO THE MASTER PLANNING

THINK THAT THE PLANNING         
DEPARTMENT IS SET UP WITH THE

THAT IS A PROBLEM RIGHT.        
WE AND SO I THINK THIS IS GOING 
TO BE THE IT IS AN AMBITIOUS

CAN LEARN FROM THE RESEARCH.    
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS    

03:19:03.024 --> 03:19:05.491
CAN LEARN FROM THE RESEARCH.    
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS
