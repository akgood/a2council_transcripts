PROJECT, ONE WE'RE WORKING IN   
THAT AREA.                      
WE THINK THAT THOSE WOULD BE    

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.427
THAT AREA.                      
WE THINK THAT THOSE WOULD BE

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.098
WITH SIPI.                      
SO THE QUESTION WAS HOW MANY    
MORE DOLLARS COULD WE USE?      

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.034
SO THE QUESTION WAS HOW MANY    
MORE DOLLARS COULD WE USE?      
WELL, THE DIFFICULTY HERE IS IF 

01:01:30.036 --> 01:01:30.668
MORE DOLLARS COULD WE USE?      
WELL, THE DIFFICULTY HERE IS IF 
WE'RE WORKING WITHIN THE        

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:31.402
WELL, THE DIFFICULTY HERE IS IF 
WE'RE WORKING WITHIN THE        
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THERE'S NOT 

01:01:31.404 --> 01:01:34.072
WE'RE WORKING WITHIN THE        
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THERE'S NOT 
A LOT OF MONTHS OF CONSTRUCTION 

01:01:34.074 --> 01:01:34.840
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THERE'S NOT 
A LOT OF MONTHS OF CONSTRUCTION 
THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE CURRENT 

01:01:34.842 --> 01:01:35.440
A LOT OF MONTHS OF CONSTRUCTION 
THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE CURRENT 
FISCAL YEAR DOLLARS PROGRAMED   

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:38.110
THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE CURRENT 
FISCAL YEAR DOLLARS PROGRAMED   
TO CARRY OVER TO A FOLLOWING    

01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:38.777

FISCAL YEAR THEY MIGHT BE       

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:41.879
TO CARRY OVER TO A FOLLOWING    
FISCAL YEAR THEY MIGHT BE       
OF MORE VALUE TO US THEY        

01:01:41.881 --> 01:01:42.714
FISCAL YEAR THEY MIGHT BE       
OF MORE VALUE TO US THEY        
ESTIMATE THAT I GOT FROM STAFF  

01:01:42.716 --> 01:01:46.083
OF MORE VALUE TO US THEY        
ESTIMATE THAT I GOT FROM STAFF  
IS MAYBE MAYBE WE COULD WORK    

01:01:46.085 --> 01:01:46.751
ESTIMATE THAT I GOT FROM STAFF  
IS MAYBE MAYBE WE COULD WORK    
WITH SOMETHING LESS THAN A      

01:01:46.753 --> 01:01:48.487
IS MAYBE MAYBE WE COULD WORK

AND STILL MAYBE ADVANCE         
SOMETHING.                      
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS WE'D 

01:01:52.493 --> 01:01:53.457
SOMETHING.                      
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS WE'D 
BE ADVANCING THOSE THAT ARE     

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:54.092
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS WE'D 
BE ADVANCING THOSE THAT ARE

01:13:46.906 --> 01:13:47.638
HEARD THAT THAT WAS A BIG       
PROBLEM AMONG SOME OF OUR       
HEAVILY TRAVELED CORRIDORS JUST 

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.875
PROBLEM AMONG SOME OF OUR       
HEAVILY TRAVELED CORRIDORS JUST 
PERSIST NOT DOING ANYTHING.     

01:13:50.877 --> 01:13:54.412
HEAVILY TRAVELED CORRIDORS JUST 
PERSIST NOT DOING ANYTHING.     
AND I WOULD THINK THAT OUR HOPE 

01:13:54.414 --> 01:13:55.279
PERSIST NOT DOING ANYTHING.     
AND I WOULD THINK THAT OUR HOPE 
THROUGH THIS IS THAT PEOPLE     

01:13:55.281 --> 01:13:58.682
AND I WOULD THINK THAT OUR HOPE 
THROUGH THIS IS THAT PEOPLE     
FEEL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR  

01:13:58.684 --> 01:13:59.516
THROUGH THIS IS THAT PEOPLE     
FEEL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR  
ACTIONS AND THEN DON'T DO IT    

01:13:59.518 --> 01:13:59.750
FEEL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR  
ACTIONS AND THEN DON'T DO IT    
AGAIN.                          

01:13:59.752 --> 01:14:02.520
ACTIONS AND THEN DON'T DO IT    
AGAIN.

01:14:02.522 --> 01:14:03.321
AGAIN.                          
BUT THAT ALSO REQUIRES TIMELY   
ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK         

01:14:03.323 --> 01:14:07.124
BUT THAT ALSO REQUIRES TIMELY   
ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK         
PROBABLY THE ABILITY TO MOVE    

01:14:07.126 --> 01:14:10.627
