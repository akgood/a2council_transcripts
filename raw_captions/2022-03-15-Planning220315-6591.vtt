POSSIBLE NONCONFORMING          

00:27:14.853 --> 00:27:17.587
CONVERSATION ABOUT REDUCING     
POSSIBLE NONCONFORMING          
STRUCTURES.                     

00:27:17.589 --> 00:27:18.689
POSSIBLE NONCONFORMING          
STRUCTURES.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THAT WOULD BE THE SHORT   

00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:19.088
STRUCTURES.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THAT WOULD BE THE SHORT

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.325
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO THAT WOULD BE THE SHORT   
ANSWER.                         
IT&amp;apos;S MORE JUST MORE OF A WHY.   

00:27:22.327 --> 00:27:25.695
ANSWER.                         
IT&amp;apos;S MORE JUST MORE OF A WHY.   
WHAT WAS OUR BACKGROUND ABOUT   

00:27:25.697 --> 00:27:26.095
IT&amp;apos;S MORE JUST MORE OF A WHY.   
WHAT WAS OUR BACKGROUND ABOUT   
THAT ONE?                       

00:27:26.097 --> 00:27:29.365
WHAT WAS OUR BACKGROUND ABOUT   
THAT ONE?                       
THE FOUR CLASSES THE AR TWO A

GETTING FOUR UNITS BUT AGAIN IT 

00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:56.293
DUPLEX BUT THERE IS A PATH FOR

00:28:12.243 --> 00:28:15.112
ALEXIS MENTIONED THE DATA AND

THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY         
OF THOSE LOTS ARE GREATER THAN  
10000 SQUARE FEET WHICH WOULD

INTO TWO SEPARATE LOT.          
SO TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THAT

GO AHEAD COMMISSIONER.          
SO THE THE I UNDERSTAND         
ENTIRELY YOUR RATIONALE FOR

SAYING THAT WE&amp;apos;RE NOT LOOKING   
AT NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.    
WE DIDN&amp;apos;T THINK ABOUT SETBACK.  

00:29:41.332 --> 00:29:42.265
AT NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.    
WE DIDN&amp;apos;T THINK ABOUT SETBACK.  
THE REASON WHY IT WAS INTUITIVE 

00:29:42.267 --> 00:29:45.168
WE DIDN&amp;apos;T THINK ABOUT SETBACK.  
THE REASON WHY IT WAS INTUITIVE 
TO ME TO ASK ABOUT IT WAS THE   

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.305
THE REASON WHY IT WAS INTUITIVE 
TO ME TO ASK ABOUT IT WAS THE   
SENTENCE IN INTENT STATEMENT

ATTACHED EITHER SIDE TO SIDE OR 
VERTICALLY.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING TO MIMIC    

00:30:04.122 --> 00:30:08.724
VERTICALLY.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING TO MIMIC    
THE AA1 DISTRICT I SUPPOSE OR A 

00:30:08.726 --> 00:30:10.993
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING TO MIMIC    
THE AA1 DISTRICT I SUPPOSE OR A 
LAY PERSON WHICH IS WHAT I AM   

00:30:10.995 --> 00:30:11.928
THE AA1 DISTRICT I SUPPOSE OR A 
LAY PERSON WHICH IS WHAT I AM   
WOULD THINK THAT WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING  

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:15.765
LAY PERSON WHICH IS WHAT I AM   
WOULD THINK THAT WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING  
TO TO TO GET CLOSER TO THE      

00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:16.366
WOULD THINK THAT WE&amp;apos;RE LOOKING  
TO TO TO GET CLOSER TO THE

00:30:19.304 --> 00:30:20.603
CHARACTERISTICS OF OF THE       
SINGLE FAMILY DISTRICT.         
AND SO TO ME THEN IT WOULD MAKE 

00:30:20.605 --> 00:30:23.773
SINGLE FAMILY DISTRICT.         
AND SO TO ME THEN IT WOULD MAKE 
SENSE THAT WE WOULD ALSO MODIFY 

00:30:23.775 --> 00:30:24.707
AND SO TO ME THEN IT WOULD MAKE 
SENSE THAT WE WOULD ALSO MODIFY 
WE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE THAT WE  

00:30:24.709 --> 00:30:27.944
SENSE THAT WE WOULD ALSO MODIFY 
WE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE THAT WE  
WOULD ALSO MODIFY THE SIDE AND  

00:30:27.946 --> 00:30:30.813
WE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE THAT WE  
WOULD ALSO MODIFY THE SIDE AND  
REAR SETBACKS UNLESS THERE WERE 

00:30:30.815 --> 00:30:31.615
WOULD ALSO MODIFY THE SIDE AND  
REAR SETBACKS UNLESS THERE WERE 
A REASON THAT WE FELT THAT A    

00:30:31.617 --> 00:30:34.785
REAR SETBACKS UNLESS THERE WERE 
A REASON THAT WE FELT THAT A    
GREATER SETBACK WOULD BE NEEDED 

00:30:34.787 --> 00:30:38.522
A REASON THAT WE FELT THAT A    
GREATER SETBACK WOULD BE NEEDED 
IF SOMEONE WERE TO PUT A DUPLEX 

00:30:38.524 --> 00:30:41.992
GREATER SETBACK WOULD BE NEEDED 
IF SOMEONE WERE TO PUT A DUPLEX 
ON AN R TO A LOT THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S  

00:30:41.994 --> 00:30:42.959
IF SOMEONE WERE TO PUT A DUPLEX 
ON AN R TO A LOT THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S  
THE ONLY REASON THAT MY         

00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:43.493
ON AN R TO A LOT THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S  
THE ONLY REASON THAT MY         
THINKING IS THERE.              

00:30:43.495 --> 00:30:46.395
THE ONLY REASON THAT MY         
THINKING IS THERE.              
BUT I CAN TELL FROM WHAT YOU    

00:30:46.397 --> 00:30:50.100
THINKING IS THERE.              
BUT I CAN TELL FROM WHAT YOU    
SAID EARLIER, MR LEO, THAT THIS 

00:30:50.102 --> 00:30:50.901
BUT I CAN TELL FROM WHAT YOU    
SAID EARLIER, MR LEO, THAT THIS 
ISN&amp;apos;T LIKE SOMETHING WE COULD   

00:30:50.903 --> 00:30:51.734
SAID EARLIER, MR LEO, THAT THIS 
ISN&amp;apos;T LIKE SOMETHING WE COULD   
TAKE WHITE OUT TO AND CHANGE    

00:30:51.736 --> 00:30:54.370
ISN&amp;apos;T LIKE SOMETHING WE COULD   
TAKE WHITE OUT TO AND CHANGE    
THOSE NUMBERS.                  

00:30:54.372 --> 00:30:55.138
TAKE WHITE OUT TO AND CHANGE    
THOSE NUMBERS.                  
IT WOULD REQUIRE TIME AND       

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.573
THOSE NUMBERS.                  
IT WOULD REQUIRE TIME AND       
ENERGY AND DEBATE AND SO I      

00:30:57.575 --> 00:30:58.508
IT WOULD REQUIRE TIME AND       
ENERGY AND DEBATE AND SO I      
DON&amp;apos;T THINK I WANT TO CARRY IT  

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:01.411
ENERGY AND DEBATE AND SO I      
DON&amp;apos;T THINK I WANT TO CARRY IT  
FURTHER UNLESS YOU SAID OH      

00:31:01.413 --> 00:31:02.612
DON&amp;apos;T THINK I WANT TO CARRY IT  
FURTHER UNLESS YOU SAID OH      
YEAH, I&amp;apos;VE JUST GOT A BOTTLE

YEAH, I&amp;apos;VE JUST GOT A BOTTLE    
OF WHITE OUT HERE AND I&amp;apos;LL DO   
IT FOR YOU.                     

00:31:08.687 --> 00:31:09.786
OF WHITE OUT HERE AND I&amp;apos;LL DO   
IT FOR YOU.                     
WELL, I WOULD RESPOND JUST OFF  

00:31:09.788 --> 00:31:12.289
IT FOR YOU.                     
WELL, I WOULD RESPOND JUST OFF  
THE CUFF THAT I&amp;apos;M A CAUTIOUS    

00:31:12.291 --> 00:31:12.688
WELL, I WOULD RESPOND JUST OFF  
THE CUFF THAT I&amp;apos;M A CAUTIOUS    
PLANNER.                        

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.660
THE CUFF THAT I&amp;apos;M A CAUTIOUS    
PLANNER.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO    

00:31:16.662 --> 00:31:17.327
PLANNER.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO    
PERHAPS PUT THE PLANNING        

00:31:17.329 --> 00:31:18.127
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO    
PERHAPS PUT THE PLANNING        
COMMISSION CAN TALK ABOUT THAT  

00:31:18.129 --> 00:31:21.197
PERHAPS PUT THE PLANNING        
COMMISSION CAN TALK ABOUT THAT  
TONIGHT AND AND CHANGE THE SET  

00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:21.465
COMMISSION CAN TALK ABOUT THAT  
TONIGHT AND AND CHANGE THE SET  
BACKS.

TONIGHT AND AND CHANGE THE SET

WHAT THE EXISTING SETBACKS ARE. 
IT WOULD BE AGAIN IT WOULD BE   
MORE OF AN EXERCISE OF ON A

DIMENSION.                      
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?      
SO ANYTHING ELSE, COMMISSIONER  

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.576
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?      
SO ANYTHING ELSE, COMMISSIONER  
?

ANY OTHERS GO HAD COMMISSIONER

?                               
ANY OTHERS GO HAD COMMISSIONER  
APRON&amp;apos;S I WONDERED I ALSO HAD   

00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:27.784
ANY OTHERS GO HAD COMMISSIONER  
APRON&amp;apos;S I WONDERED I ALSO HAD   
THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT THE     

00:34:27.786 --> 00:34:30.620
APRON&amp;apos;S I WONDERED I ALSO HAD   
THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT THE     
REAR STEP BACK AND MAYBE BEFORE 

00:34:30.622 --> 00:34:31.487
THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT THE     
REAR STEP BACK AND MAYBE BEFORE 
WE HEARD FROM ALEXIS AND BRETT  

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:32.088
REAR STEP BACK AND MAYBE BEFORE 
WE HEARD FROM ALEXIS AND BRETT  
WAS GOING TO PROPOSE AN         

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.056
WE HEARD FROM ALEXIS AND BRETT  
WAS GOING TO PROPOSE AN         
AMENDMENT ON TO THE MOTION BUT  

00:34:34.058 --> 00:34:37.927
WAS GOING TO PROPOSE AN         
AMENDMENT ON TO THE MOTION BUT  
I WILL ALL WITHHOLD THAT.       

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:38.694
AMENDMENT ON TO THE MOTION BUT  
I WILL ALL WITHHOLD THAT.       
BUT I WONDERED IF THERE&amp;apos;S       

00:34:38.696 --> 00:34:39.395
I WILL ALL WITHHOLD THAT.       
BUT I WONDERED IF THERE&amp;apos;S       
ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT   

00:34:39.397 --> 00:34:45.535
BUT I WONDERED IF THERE&amp;apos;S       
ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT   
WHICH IS                        

00:34:58.382 --> 00:35:01.217
         NOT ABOUT CONFORMITY   
BUT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, INCREASING 
ALLOWABLE DENSITY.              

00:35:01.219 --> 00:35:02.619
BUT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, INCREASING 
ALLOWABLE DENSITY.              
SO THE 30 FOOT WITH IS SEEMS    

00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:03.619
ALLOWABLE DENSITY.              
SO THE 30 FOOT WITH IS SEEMS    
VIABLE BUT THE LOT DEPTH WE     

00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:04.420
SO THE 30 FOOT WITH IS SEEMS    
VIABLE BUT THE LOT DEPTH WE     
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW AND IT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY    

00:35:04.422 --> 00:35:05.021
VIABLE BUT THE LOT DEPTH WE     
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW AND IT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY    
MORE VARIABLE BUT THAT EXTRA    

00:35:05.023 --> 00:35:05.822
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW AND IT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY    
MORE VARIABLE BUT THAT EXTRA    
TEN FEET WOULD MAKE EITHER SIDE 

00:35:05.824 --> 00:35:06.622
MORE VARIABLE BUT THAT EXTRA    
TEN FEET WOULD MAKE EITHER SIDE 
UP OR DOWN OR SIDE BY SIDE      

00:35:06.624 --> 00:35:07.356
TEN FEET WOULD MAKE EITHER SIDE 
UP OR DOWN OR SIDE BY SIDE      
GETTING TWO UNITS ON THERE MORE 

00:35:07.358 --> 00:35:07.691
UP OR DOWN OR SIDE BY SIDE      
GETTING TWO UNITS ON THERE MORE 
FEASIBLE.                       

00:35:07.693 --> 00:35:08.758
GETTING TWO UNITS ON THERE MORE 
FEASIBLE.                       
SO I THINK I WOULD I WOULD VOTE 

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.194
FEASIBLE.                       
SO I THINK I WOULD I WOULD VOTE 
TO SUPPORT THAT CHANGE WHETHER

RESEARCH IN MY MIND WAS THE     
MOST INTERESTING THING EVEN

IT JUST SUGGESTS TO ME THAT     

00:50:24.642 --> 00:50:25.374
THE MOTION ON THE TABLE.        
IT JUST SUGGESTS TO ME THAT     
THAT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

00:50:25.376 --> 00:50:27.909
IT JUST SUGGESTS TO ME THAT     
THAT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
GET FEWER NONCONFORMING         

00:50:27.911 --> 00:50:28.644
THAT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
GET FEWER NONCONFORMING

SO IN THE IN THE EXAMPLE THAT   

01:10:30.146 --> 01:10:32.179

SO IN THE IN THE EXAMPLE THAT   
THE SPEAKER IS ADDRESSING, IF   

01:10:32.181 --> 01:10:35.750
SO IN THE IN THE EXAMPLE THAT   
THE SPEAKER IS ADDRESSING, IF

01:10:35.752 --> 01:10:36.950
THE SPEAKER IS ADDRESSING, IF

PROVISIONING CENTER LICENSES    
THEN WHAT THIS CHANGE WOULD DO  
CURRENTLY YOU COULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE

THEN WHAT THIS CHANGE WOULD DO  
CURRENTLY YOU COULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE     
MORE THAN ONE PROVISIONING      

01:10:48.365 --> 01:10:49.163
CURRENTLY YOU COULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE

01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:49.764
MORE THAN ONE PROVISIONING

THAT WERE TO HAPPEN.            

01:10:49.766 --> 01:10:52.367
LICENSE AT THAT LOCATION IF     
THAT WERE TO HAPPEN.            
OTHER LICENSES WERE TO COME UP  

01:10:52.369 --> 01:10:53.200
THAT WERE TO HAPPEN.            
OTHER LICENSES WERE TO COME UP  
AND NO OTHER CHANGES HAPPEN     

01:10:53.202 --> 01:10:55.602
OTHER LICENSES WERE TO COME UP  
AND NO OTHER CHANGES HAPPEN     
THEN A PETITIONER COULD COME    

01:10:55.604 --> 01:10:56.237
AND NO OTHER CHANGES HAPPEN     
THEN A PETITIONER COULD COME    
AND ASK TO AMEND A SPECIAL      

01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:58.806
THEN A PETITIONER COULD COME    
AND ASK TO AMEND A SPECIAL      
EXCEPTIONS FOR THAT SAME        

01:10:58.808 --> 01:10:59.673
AND ASK TO AMEND A SPECIAL      
EXCEPTIONS FOR THAT SAME        
PROPERTY TO ADD TO PROVISIONING 

01:10:59.675 --> 01:11:00.408
EXCEPTIONS FOR THAT SAME        
PROPERTY TO ADD TO PROVISIONING 
CENTERS TO THAT YOU WERE RIGHT  

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:02.943
PROPERTY TO ADD TO PROVISIONING 
CENTERS TO THAT YOU WERE RIGHT  
THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME THROUGH 

01:11:02.945 --> 01:11:03.811
CENTERS TO THAT YOU WERE RIGHT  
THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME THROUGH 
THIS PROCESS BUT THERE COULD BE 

01:11:03.813 --> 01:11:07.381
THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME THROUGH 
THIS PROCESS BUT THERE COULD BE 
ACTION AT THE CITY COUNCIL THAT 

01:11:07.383 --> 01:11:08.115
THIS PROCESS BUT THERE COULD BE 
ACTION AT THE CITY COUNCIL THAT 
IMPACTS THAT SORT OF OPENS THE

ACTION AT THE CITY COUNCIL THAT 
IMPACTS THAT SORT OF OPENS THE  
DOOR FOR THAT DIFFERENTLY.      

01:11:10.886 --> 01:11:11.986
IMPACTS THAT SORT OF OPENS THE  
DOOR FOR THAT DIFFERENTLY.      
SO THIS DOES NOT CHANGE IT      

01:11:11.988 --> 01:11:15.322
DOOR FOR THAT DIFFERENTLY.      
SO THIS DOES NOT CHANGE IT      
DOESN&amp;apos;T CHANGE THE USES THAT    

01:11:15.324 --> 01:11:15.923
SO THIS DOES NOT CHANGE IT

01:15:11.961 --> 01:15:15.629
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDED LANGUAGE   
THAT SAID A COMMUNITY CANNOT    
WITHHOLD A RETAIL LICENSE FROM  

01:15:15.631 --> 01:15:16.197
THAT SAID A COMMUNITY CANNOT    
WITHHOLD A RETAIL LICENSE FROM  
A MEDICAL MARIJUANA             

01:15:16.199 --> 01:15:19.099
WITHHOLD A RETAIL LICENSE FROM  
A MEDICAL MARIJUANA             
PROVISIONING CENTER.            

01:15:19.101 --> 01:15:22.870
A MEDICAL MARIJUANA             
PROVISIONING CENTER.            
SO IN THAT STATE LAW WAS A LINK 

01:15:22.872 --> 01:15:23.804
PROVISIONING CENTER.            
SO IN THAT STATE LAW WAS A LINK 
THAT THEN THE CITY SUBSEQUENTLY 

01:15:23.806 --> 01:15:26.373
SO IN THAT STATE LAW WAS A LINK 
THAT THEN THE CITY SUBSEQUENTLY 
FOLLOWED AND FOLLOWED THAT THAT 

01:15:26.375 --> 01:15:31.044
THAT THEN THE CITY SUBSEQUENTLY 
FOLLOWED AND FOLLOWED THAT THAT 
THAT CHANGE AND MODIFIED OUR

FOLLOWED AND FOLLOWED THAT THAT 
THAT CHANGE AND MODIFIED OUR    
DEFINITION TO SIMILARLY EQUATE  

01:15:31.847 --> 01:15:34.681
THAT CHANGE AND MODIFIED OUR

THOSE TWO FACILITIES THE SAME.  

01:15:34.683 --> 01:15:38.385
DEFINITION TO SIMILARLY EQUATE  
THOSE TWO FACILITIES THE SAME.  
SO IT IS TRUE WE DID NOT REALLY 

01:15:38.387 --> 01:15:39.086
THOSE TWO FACILITIES THE SAME.  
SO IT IS TRUE WE DID NOT REALLY 
REQUIRE THAT MEDICAL TO GO      

01:15:39.088 --> 01:15:42.089
SO IT IS TRUE WE DID NOT REALLY 
REQUIRE THAT MEDICAL TO GO      
THROUGH THE SPECIAL SUBSTANCE   

01:15:42.091 --> 01:15:43.024
REQUIRE THAT MEDICAL TO GO      
THROUGH THE SPECIAL SUBSTANCE   
USE PERMIT AT THAT TIME THE     

01:15:43.026 --> 01:15:46.126
THROUGH THE SPECIAL SUBSTANCE   
USE PERMIT AT THAT TIME THE     
VOTERS HAD ENACTED A LAW WITH   

01:15:46.128 --> 01:15:47.061
USE PERMIT AT THAT TIME THE     
VOTERS HAD ENACTED A LAW WITH   
THAT LENGTH THAT SAYS IF YOU    

01:15:47.063 --> 01:15:47.862
VOTERS HAD ENACTED A LAW WITH   
THAT LENGTH THAT SAYS IF YOU    
HAVE A PROVISIONING CENTER THE  

01:15:47.864 --> 01:15:50.264
THAT LENGTH THAT SAYS IF YOU    
HAVE A PROVISIONING CENTER THE  
COMMUNITY CANNOT DENY YOU A     

01:15:50.266 --> 01:15:50.598
HAVE A PROVISIONING CENTER THE  
COMMUNITY CANNOT DENY YOU A

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.333
COMMUNITY CANNOT DENY YOU A     
RETAILER.                       
OK, SO SO THEY DID CHANGE AND   

01:15:53.335 --> 01:15:54.468
RETAILER.                       
OK, SO SO THEY DID CHANGE AND   
IT WAS THAT SORT OF A SNAPSHOT  

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:57.238
OK, SO SO THEY DID CHANGE AND   
IT WAS THAT SORT OF A SNAPSHOT  
OF THAT FRAMEWORK.              

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.372
IT WAS THAT SORT OF A SNAPSHOT  
OF THAT FRAMEWORK.              
SO WE DID MODIFY OUR CODE TO    

01:15:58.374 --> 01:16:01.808
OF THAT FRAMEWORK.              
SO WE DID MODIFY OUR CODE TO    
REFLECT THAT LANGUAGE BUT THAT  

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:02.643
SO WE DID MODIFY OUR CODE TO    
REFLECT THAT LANGUAGE BUT THAT  
MANDATE LAW SO WE STILL HAVE TO 

01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:03.110
REFLECT THAT LANGUAGE BUT THAT  
MANDATE LAW SO WE STILL HAVE TO 
BE IN COMPLIANCE.               

01:16:03.112 --> 01:16:05.813
MANDATE LAW SO WE STILL HAVE TO 
BE IN COMPLIANCE.               
SO WE MYOZYME WOULD HAVE BEEN   

01:16:05.815 --> 01:16:06.346
BE IN COMPLIANCE.               
SO WE MYOZYME WOULD HAVE BEEN   
OUT OF COMPLIANCE.              

01:16:06.348 --> 01:16:07.081
SO WE MYOZYME WOULD HAVE BEEN   
OUT OF COMPLIANCE.              
WE MODIFIED OUR LAW TO NOT ONLY 

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:09.216
OUT OF COMPLIANCE.              
WE MODIFIED OUR LAW TO NOT ONLY 
REFLECT THAT BUT TO ALSO        

01:16:09.218 --> 01:16:10.217
WE MODIFIED OUR LAW TO NOT ONLY 
REFLECT THAT BUT TO ALSO        
CLEARLY PROVIDE THE OTHER TYPES 

01:16:10.219 --> 01:16:10.951
REFLECT THAT BUT TO ALSO

BIT CHANGING.                   
SO NOW I THINK THE BENEFIT IS   

01:26:27.702 --> 01:26:31.771
BIT CHANGING.

NEIGHBORHOODS NEARER TO RETAIL  
FACILITIES IF THE ONLY STACKING 

01:35:39.721 --> 01:35:42.655
NEIGHBORHOODS NEARER TO RETAIL  
FACILITIES IF THE ONLY STACKING 
POSSIBILITY WOULD BE WITH A     

01:35:42.657 --> 01:35:43.289
FACILITIES IF THE ONLY STACKING 
POSSIBILITY WOULD BE WITH A     
CONSUMPTION FACILITY, THE

01:40:27.474 --> 01:40:28.340
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS A POLICY AND IT WAS   
DEALT WITH ADMINISTRATIVELY     
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME    

01:40:28.342 --> 01:40:31.410
DEALT WITH ADMINISTRATIVELY     
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME    
VARIANCES AND WE THOUGHT THIS   

01:40:31.412 --> 01:40:32.478
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME    
VARIANCES AND WE THOUGHT THIS   
IS MAYBE NOT SUCH A BAD THING.  

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.280
VARIANCES AND WE THOUGHT THIS   
IS MAYBE NOT SUCH A BAD THING.  
MAYBE THIS IS JUST REALLY A

01:40:35.816 --> 01:40:36.815
MAYBE THIS IS JUST REALLY A     
MODIFICATION THING.             
SO NOT ONLY DID WE MAKE THE     

01:40:36.817 --> 01:40:39.418
MODIFICATION THING.             
SO NOT ONLY DID WE MAKE THE     
LINEAR MEASUREMENT ADJUSTMENT   

01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:42.287
SO NOT ONLY DID WE MAKE THE     
LINEAR MEASUREMENT ADJUSTMENT   
AS REQUESTED BY FORESTRY, WE

THE DEPRESSED LANDSCAPE ISLANDS 

01:41:49.457 --> 01:41:51.857
YOU TALK ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE,   
THE DEPRESSED LANDSCAPE ISLANDS 
FOR STORMWATER, I THINK USING   

01:41:51.859 --> 01:41:52.724
THE DEPRESSED LANDSCAPE ISLANDS 
FOR STORMWATER, I THINK USING   
THE WORD CLAY IS TOO VAGUE AND  

01:41:52.726 --> 01:41:56.161
FOR STORMWATER, I THINK USING   
THE WORD CLAY IS TOO VAGUE AND  
THAT I WOULD USE MORE SPECIFIC  

01:41:56.163 --> 01:41:56.829
THE WORD CLAY IS TOO VAGUE AND  
THAT I WOULD USE MORE SPECIFIC  
TERMINOLOGY ABOUT THE TYPE      

01:41:56.831 --> 01:42:00.966
THAT I WOULD USE MORE SPECIFIC  
TERMINOLOGY ABOUT THE TYPE      
OF SOILS THAT USUALLY REQUIRE   

01:42:00.968 --> 01:42:04.035
TERMINOLOGY ABOUT THE TYPE      
OF SOILS THAT USUALLY REQUIRE   
YOU TO NOT YOU KNOW, BECAUSE    

01:42:04.037 --> 01:42:05.070
OF SOILS THAT USUALLY REQUIRE   
YOU TO NOT YOU KNOW, BECAUSE    
SOME CLAY SOILS WILL BE OK AND  

01:42:05.072 --> 01:42:08.440
YOU TO NOT YOU KNOW, BECAUSE    
SOME CLAY SOILS WILL BE OK AND  
SO I WOULD USE LANGUAGE MORE    

01:42:08.442 --> 01:42:11.610
SOME CLAY SOILS WILL BE OK AND  
SO I WOULD USE LANGUAGE MORE    
AROUND LIKE C AND D SOILS       

01:42:11.612 --> 01:42:12.644
SO I WOULD USE LANGUAGE MORE    
AROUND LIKE C AND D SOILS       
RATHER THAN A AND B SOILS       

01:42:12.646 --> 01:42:15.848
AROUND LIKE C AND D SOILS       
RATHER THAN A AND B SOILS       
BECAUSE AND DOUBLECHECK ABOUT   

01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:16.181
RATHER THAN A AND B SOILS       
BECAUSE AND DOUBLECHECK ABOUT   
THAT.                           

01:42:16.183 --> 01:42:20.152
BECAUSE AND DOUBLECHECK ABOUT   
THAT.                           
BUT THAT&amp;apos;S JUST GOING TO BE WAY 

01:42:20.154 --> 01:42:20.419
THAT.

CLAY.                           
YOU COULD JUST BE PRETTY VAGUE  

01:42:23.491 --> 01:42:24.589
CLAY.                           
YOU COULD JUST BE PRETTY VAGUE  
ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE SOIL 

01:42:24.591 --> 01:42:25.357
YOU COULD JUST BE PRETTY VAGUE  
ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE SOIL 
TYPES THAT YOU HAVE AND THERE   

01:42:25.359 --> 01:42:28.127
ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE SOIL 
TYPES THAT YOU HAVE AND THERE   
ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS     

01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.760
TYPES THAT YOU HAVE AND THERE   
ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS

OF CLAY IN TERMS                
OF INFILTRATION RATES AND NONE  

01:42:29.463 --> 01:42:31.163
OF CLAY IN TERMS                
OF INFILTRATION RATES AND NONE  
OF THEM ARE LIKE FANTASTIC AND  

01:42:31.165 --> 01:42:31.897
OF INFILTRATION RATES AND NONE  
OF THEM ARE LIKE FANTASTIC AND  
SOILS WHICH WOULD INFILTRATE    

01:42:31.899 --> 01:42:37.402
OF THEM ARE LIKE FANTASTIC AND  
SOILS WHICH WOULD INFILTRATE    
REALLY QUICKLY BUT BE SOILS YOU 

01:42:37.404 --> 01:42:38.236

TO JUST SET THE STAGE WITH THAT 

02:35:56.567 --> 02:35:57.299

A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JUST HOW     
MUCH LAND THEY DO ON OVER IN

A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JUST HOW     
MUCH LAND THEY DO ON OVER IN    
THAT AREA TOO THAT LIKE EVEN    

02:36:01.505 --> 02:36:04.139
MUCH LAND THEY DO ON OVER IN    
THAT AREA TOO THAT LIKE EVEN    
EVEN A TINY PERCENTAGE OF THAT  

02:36:04.141 --> 02:36:07.509
THAT AREA TOO THAT LIKE EVEN    
EVEN A TINY PERCENTAGE OF THAT  
COULD REALLY GO SOMEWHERE.      

02:36:07.511 --> 02:36:08.411
EVEN A TINY PERCENTAGE OF THAT  
COULD REALLY GO SOMEWHERE.      
AND I KNOW THEY ALSO ARE YOU    

02:36:08.413 --> 02:36:09.278

THE END OF SOME OF THE AGE      
OF SOME OF THEIR HOUSING OVER   
IN NORTH CAMPUS TO WHERE        

02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:16.719

THEY&amp;apos;RE HAVING TO MAKE          

02:36:16.721 --> 02:36:19.055
IN NORTH CAMPUS TO WHERE        
THEY&amp;apos;RE HAVING TO MAKE          
DECISIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS    

02:36:19.057 --> 02:36:20.122
THEY&amp;apos;RE HAVING TO MAKE          
DECISIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS    
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S EITHER FIX A WHOLE 

02:36:20.124 --> 02:36:20.889
DECISIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS    
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S EITHER FIX A WHOLE 
LOT OF STUFF OR CHANGE IT ALL

WAY TO KIND OF CONTEXT WISE A   
LITTLE BIT AROUND SOME OF THAT  

02:36:35.473 --> 02:36:36.338
WAY TO KIND OF CONTEXT WISE A   
LITTLE BIT AROUND SOME OF THAT  
TOO BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE        

02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:38.941
LITTLE BIT AROUND SOME OF THAT  
TOO BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE        
OPPORTUNITY IF THEY WERE TO

BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT HOUSING  
BEYOND STUDENTS.                
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, I WOULD ONE WAY TO DO

BEYOND STUDENTS.                
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, I WOULD ONE WAY TO DO  
THAT WOULD BE TO THINK ABOUT    

02:36:51.655 --> 02:36:52.221
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, I WOULD ONE WAY TO DO  
THAT WOULD BE TO THINK ABOUT    
THE FRAMING OF THE              

02:36:52.223 --> 02:36:54.490
THAT WOULD BE TO THINK ABOUT    
THE FRAMING OF THE              
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.             

02:36:54.492 --> 02:36:55.424
THE FRAMING OF THE              
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN SAYS  

02:36:55.426 --> 02:36:58.494
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN SAYS  
IF THIS LAND WERE TO BE SOLD,   

02:36:58.496 --> 02:36:59.494
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN SAYS  
IF THIS LAND WERE TO BE SOLD,   
THIS IS HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT    

02:36:59.496 --> 02:36:59.761
IF THIS LAND WERE TO BE SOLD,

02:36:59.763 --> 02:37:02.030
THIS IS HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT    
IT.                             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE  

02:37:02.032 --> 02:37:06.001
IT.                             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE  
TO SORT OF RAISE THAT AND SAY   

02:37:06.003 --> 02:37:06.735
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ONE WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE  
TO SORT OF RAISE THAT AND SAY   
THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD     

02:37:06.737 --> 02:37:09.472
TO SORT OF RAISE THAT AND SAY

THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD     
THING IF THE LAND WERE SOLD AND 
THIS IS HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT    

02:37:10.508 --> 02:37:10.773

THIS IS HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT    
IT.                             

02:37:10.775 --> 02:37:11.106
THIS IS HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT    
IT.                             
RIGHT.                          

02:37:11.108 --> 02:37:14.276
IT.                             
RIGHT.                          
SO THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY TO     

02:37:14.278 --> 02:37:15.111
RIGHT.

KNOW THAT IT&amp;apos;S THE RIGHT TOOL   

02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:41.650
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT I AGREE THAT I DON&amp;apos;T     
KNOW THAT IT&amp;apos;S THE RIGHT TOOL   
AND I DON&amp;apos;T I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW TO THE 

02:45:41.652 --> 02:45:42.450
KNOW THAT IT&amp;apos;S THE RIGHT TOOL

RESOURCED.                      
THAT PARTICULAR ITEM I DID I    
DID THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT  

02:45:49.392 --> 02:45:50.025
THAT PARTICULAR ITEM I DID I    
DID THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

DID THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT  
THAT WAS STILL APPROPRIATE TO   
INCLUDE DOWN THERE AT ALL.      

02:45:50.761 --> 02:45:53.495
THAT WAS STILL APPROPRIATE TO   
INCLUDE DOWN THERE AT ALL.      
BUT MY SENSE WAS IF THE STATE   

02:45:53.497 --> 02:45:54.295
INCLUDE DOWN THERE AT ALL.      
BUT MY SENSE WAS IF THE STATE   
LEGISLATURE ENABLED THAT AS A

BUT MY SENSE WAS IF THE STATE   
LEGISLATURE ENABLED THAT AS A

THINK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL TO DO 
THAT.                           
SO IN SHORT, I THINK IT&amp;apos;S       

02:46:02.038 --> 02:46:04.572

THERE&amp;apos;S AN EXPECTATION BASED ON

THERE&amp;apos;S AN EXPECTATION BASED ON

ZONING LAW SHOULD BE.           

03:01:11.848 --> 03:01:14.648
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF WHAT THE  
ZONING LAW SHOULD BE.           
I THINK PART TWO TONIGHT        

03:01:14.650 --> 03:01:15.583
ZONING LAW SHOULD BE.           
I THINK PART TWO TONIGHT        
CHANGING THE LAW DIMENSIONS IS  

03:01:15.585 --> 03:01:19.486
I THINK PART TWO TONIGHT        
CHANGING THE LAW DIMENSIONS IS  
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE R2 TWO IS   

03:01:19.488 --> 03:01:20.154
CHANGING THE LAW DIMENSIONS IS  
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE R2 TWO IS   
STILL R2 IT&amp;apos;S STILL A DUPLEX.   

03:01:20.156 --> 03:01:23.424
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE R2 TWO IS   
STILL R2 IT&amp;apos;S STILL A DUPLEX.   
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE LESS      

03:01:23.426 --> 03:01:24.025
STILL R2 IT&amp;apos;S STILL A DUPLEX.   
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE LESS      
APPROPRIATE WOULD BE THINGS     

03:01:24.027 --> 03:01:26.693
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE LESS      
APPROPRIATE WOULD BE THINGS     
THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED UNDER     

03:01:26.695 --> 03:01:27.462
APPROPRIATE WOULD BE THINGS     
THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED UNDER     
EXISTING ZONING FOR EXAMPLE FOR 

03:01:27.464 --> 03:01:30.164
THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED UNDER     
EXISTING ZONING FOR EXAMPLE FOR 
UNIT SINGLE FAMILY OR DUPLEX    

03:01:30.166 --> 03:01:34.602
EXISTING ZONING FOR EXAMPLE FOR 
UNIT SINGLE FAMILY OR DUPLEX    
SLOTS WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION    

03:01:34.604 --> 03:01:35.269
UNIT SINGLE FAMILY OR DUPLEX    
SLOTS WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION    
THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER.

SLOTS WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION    
THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER.

HAS TO DO WITH VERY SIMPLE      

03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:41.442
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT THIRTY MORE SO PROBABLY  
HAS TO DO WITH VERY SIMPLE      
COMMON SENSE THAT WE HAVE A     

03:01:41.444 --> 03:01:42.243
HAS TO DO WITH VERY SIMPLE      
COMMON SENSE THAT WE HAVE A     
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT SETS UP 

03:01:42.245 --> 03:01:44.912
COMMON SENSE THAT WE HAVE A     
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT SETS UP 
AN EXPECTATION AND THEN OUR     

03:01:44.914 --> 03:01:45.846
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT SETS UP 
AN EXPECTATION AND THEN OUR     
ZONING CODIFIES THAT IN THE LAW 

03:01:45.848 --> 03:01:48.682
AN EXPECTATION AND THEN OUR     
ZONING CODIFIES THAT IN THE LAW
