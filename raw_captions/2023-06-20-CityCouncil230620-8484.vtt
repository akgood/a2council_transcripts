INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS.             
&gt;&gt; OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE  
HUNDRED PERCENT POWER.          

03:13:48.674 --> 03:13:51.141
&gt;&gt; OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE

03:13:51.143 --> 03:13:54.444
HUNDRED PERCENT POWER.          
BUT IF THE SAY THE SITE PLAN    
LITERALLY INCLUDES HUNDRED      

03:13:54.446 --> 03:13:58.849
BUT IF THE SAY THE SITE PLAN    
LITERALLY INCLUDES HUNDRED      
KILOWATTS OF SOLAR PANELS BY A  

03:13:58.851 --> 03:14:02.585
LITERALLY INCLUDES HUNDRED      
KILOWATTS OF SOLAR PANELS BY A  
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE      

03:14:02.587 --> 03:14:03.587
KILOWATTS OF SOLAR PANELS BY A  
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE      
WHICH IS A MUCH LESS ENERGY     

03:14:03.589 --> 03:14:06.290
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE      
WHICH IS A MUCH LESS ENERGY     
EFFICIENT TYPE OF BUILDING THAT 

03:14:06.292 --> 03:14:10.561
WHICH IS A MUCH LESS ENERGY     
EFFICIENT TYPE OF BUILDING THAT 
THEN THIS WILL BE THE NEEDS FOR 

03:14:10.563 --> 03:14:13.830
EFFICIENT TYPE OF BUILDING THAT 
THEN THIS WILL BE THE NEEDS FOR 
KILOWATTS OF OF SOLAR PANELS TO 

03:14:13.832 --> 03:14:17.468
THEN THIS WILL BE THE NEEDS FOR 
KILOWATTS OF OF SOLAR PANELS TO 
FULLY MAKE UP FOR MY ENERGY     

03:14:17.470 --> 03:14:17.868
KILOWATTS OF OF SOLAR PANELS TO 
FULLY MAKE UP FOR MY ENERGY     
CONSUMPTION.                    

03:14:17.870 --> 03:14:19.102
FULLY MAKE UP FOR MY ENERGY     
CONSUMPTION.                    
&gt;&gt; SO IT WILL THIS WILL BE      

03:14:19.104 --> 03:14:25.575
CONSUMPTION.                    
&gt;&gt; SO IT WILL THIS WILL BE      
COVERING AT LEAST 20 25 UNITS   

03:14:25.577 --> 03:14:26.576
&gt;&gt; SO IT WILL THIS WILL BE      
COVERING AT LEAST 20 25 UNITS   
PROBABLY PROBABLY FAR MORE JUST 

03:14:26.578 --> 03:14:30.381

04:28:41.595 --> 04:28:44.229
THE SPACE.                      
I MEAN RIGHT NOW IT EXISTS AS   
BASICALLY KIND OF A DEAD ZONE   

04:28:44.231 --> 04:28:44.997
I MEAN RIGHT NOW IT EXISTS AS   
BASICALLY KIND OF A DEAD ZONE   
WHERE NOTHING HAPPENS, WHICH IS 

04:28:44.999 --> 04:28:45.864
BASICALLY KIND OF A DEAD ZONE   
WHERE NOTHING HAPPENS, WHICH IS 
WHY WE ASKED FOR THE CITY

WHERE NOTHING HAPPENS, WHICH IS 
WHY WE ASKED FOR THE CITY

SO I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK     

04:28:55.976 --> 04:28:56.909
IN NOVEMBER.                    
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK     
BIGGER THAN WHAT EXISTS THERE   

04:28:56.911 --> 04:28:57.176
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK     
BIGGER THAN WHAT EXISTS THERE   
NOW.                            

04:28:57.178 --> 04:29:00.212
BIGGER THAN WHAT EXISTS THERE   
NOW.                            
I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY  

04:29:00.214 --> 04:29:01.046
NOW.                            
I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY  
TO ACTUALLY REFIGURE THE SPACE. 

04:29:01.048 --> 04:29:02.048
I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY  
TO ACTUALLY REFIGURE THE SPACE. 
I THINK YES, IT WOULD HAVE TO   

04:29:02.050 --> 04:29:04.449
TO ACTUALLY REFIGURE THE SPACE. 
I THINK YES, IT WOULD HAVE TO   
BE DESIGNED VERY THOUGHTFULLY.  

04:29:04.451 --> 04:29:05.284
I THINK YES, IT WOULD HAVE TO   
BE DESIGNED VERY THOUGHTFULLY.  
I THINK WHAT YOU&apos;RE HEARING IS  

04:29:05.286 --> 04:29:05.885

EVERYBODY WANTS A VIBRANT       
ACTIVE DOWNTOWN.                
NO ONE WANTS TO CREATE A SPACE  

04:29:09.690 --> 04:29:12.758
ACTIVE DOWNTOWN.                
NO ONE WANTS TO CREATE A SPACE  
WITH PROBLEMS BUT I THINK THAT  

04:29:12.760 --> 04:29:13.525
NO ONE WANTS TO CREATE A SPACE  
WITH PROBLEMS BUT I THINK THAT  
WHEN DONE RIGHT, THESE KINDS    

04:29:13.527 --> 04:29:16.328
WITH PROBLEMS BUT I THINK THAT  
WHEN DONE RIGHT, THESE KINDS    
OF SPACES ARE EXTREMELY         

04:29:16.330 --> 04:29:16.662
WHEN DONE RIGHT, THESE KINDS    
OF SPACES ARE EXTREMELY         
DESIRABLE.                      

04:29:16.664 --> 04:29:20.599

VEHICULAR TRAFFIC ARE THE MOST  
VIBRANT SPACES THAT WE HAVE.    

04:29:24.638 --> 04:29:27.773
VEHICULAR TRAFFIC ARE THE MOST  
VIBRANT SPACES THAT WE HAVE.    
I&apos;VE BEEN OTHER CITIES THAT     

04:29:27.775 --> 04:29:28.707
VIBRANT SPACES THAT WE HAVE.    
I&apos;VE BEEN OTHER CITIES THAT

IT&apos;S AN IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE   

04:30:10.351 --> 04:30:14.119
THAT INITIATES A PROCESS AND    
IT&apos;S AN IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE   
WE HAVE A DOWNTOWN THAT THAT WE 

04:30:14.121 --> 04:30:17.589
IT&apos;S AN IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE   
WE HAVE A DOWNTOWN THAT THAT WE 
I THINK SO MANY OF US ARE PROUD

SUPER CREATIVE WITH RESPECT TO  
THEIR THEIR BUILDING SPACE.     

04:30:36.811 --> 04:30:37.677
SUPER CREATIVE WITH RESPECT TO

AND THE UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER WAS  

04:30:37.679 --> 04:30:41.080
THEIR THEIR BUILDING SPACE.     
AND THE UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER WAS  
THAT THEY VIEWED THE THE        

04:30:41.082 --> 04:30:41.881
AND THE UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER WAS  
THAT THEY VIEWED THE THE

WE DID HEAR FROM GSA THAT THEY  

04:30:49.323 --> 04:30:52.591
THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.      
WE DID HEAR FROM GSA THAT THEY  
ARE EXCITED ABOUT REDESIGNING   

04:30:52.593 --> 04:30:53.826
WE DID HEAR FROM GSA THAT THEY  
ARE EXCITED ABOUT REDESIGNING
