MEZZANINE CAN&amp;apos;T OVERLAP OVERTOP 
OF THE RESTROOM BECAUSE THERE   
ARE DIFFERENT HEIGHT.           

01:13:57.336 --> 01:14:01.806
OF THE RESTROOM BECAUSE THERE   
ARE DIFFERENT HEIGHT.           
SO WE CAN&amp;apos;T GO ANY FURTHER ON   

01:14:01.808 --> 01:14:02.273
ARE DIFFERENT HEIGHT.           
SO WE CAN&amp;apos;T GO ANY FURTHER ON   
THAT SIDE.                      

01:14:02.275 --> 01:14:05.375
SO WE CAN&amp;apos;T GO ANY FURTHER ON   
THAT SIDE.                      
I MEAN WE COULD SHORTEN IT UP,  

01:14:05.377 --> 01:14:06.377
THAT SIDE.                      
I MEAN WE COULD SHORTEN IT UP,  
YOU KNOW, A FOOT SAY ON THE     

01:14:06.379 --> 01:14:09.780
I MEAN WE COULD SHORTEN IT UP,  
YOU KNOW, A FOOT SAY ON THE     
FRONT PART WE WERE SLOPING THE  

01:14:09.782 --> 01:14:12.616
YOU KNOW, A FOOT SAY ON THE     
FRONT PART WE WERE SLOPING THE  
ROOF ON TOP TO SHED WATER.      

01:14:12.618 --> 01:14:16.821
FRONT PART WE WERE SLOPING THE  
ROOF ON TOP TO SHED WATER.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT IF WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE 

01:14:16.823 --> 01:14:20.491
ROOF ON TOP TO SHED WATER.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT IF WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE 
WILLING TO COMPROMISE AND LEAVE 

01:14:20.493 --> 01:14:21.258
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT IF WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE 
WILLING TO COMPROMISE AND LEAVE 
THE SOUTHWESTERN FRONT THERE    

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:25.061
WILLING TO COMPROMISE AND LEAVE 
THE SOUTHWESTERN FRONT THERE    
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CAPTURE 

01:14:25.063 --> 01:14:28.398
THE SOUTHWESTERN FRONT THERE    
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CAPTURE 
WATER INSIDE THERE AND GET IT   

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:28.665
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CAPTURE 
WATER INSIDE THERE AND GET IT   
OUT.                            

01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:29.533
WATER INSIDE THERE AND GET IT   
OUT.                            
BUT RIGHT NOW IT WAS REALLY     

01:14:29.535 --> 01:14:32.803
OUT.                            
BUT RIGHT NOW IT WAS REALLY     
ABOUT SHEDDING WATER OUT TO THE 

01:14:32.805 --> 01:14:36.673
BUT RIGHT NOW IT WAS REALLY     
ABOUT SHEDDING WATER OUT TO THE 
STREET AND AWAY FROM THE        

01:14:36.675 --> 01:14:37.040
ABOUT SHEDDING WATER OUT TO THE 
STREET AND AWAY FROM THE        
STRUCTURE.                      

01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:39.443
STREET AND AWAY FROM THE        
STRUCTURE.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO HOW SET BACK FROM THE     

01:14:39.445 --> 01:14:43.880
STRUCTURE.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO HOW SET BACK FROM THE     
NORTH FACADE IS THE FOUR STORY  

01:14:43.882 --> 01:14:44.481
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO HOW SET BACK FROM THE     
NORTH FACADE IS THE FOUR STORY  
ADDITION OVER THE GARAGE?       

01:14:44.483 --> 01:14:47.784
NORTH FACADE IS THE FOUR STORY  
ADDITION OVER THE GARAGE?       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S THREE FOOT    

01:14:47.786 --> 01:14:51.489
ADDITION OVER THE GARAGE?       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S THREE FOOT    
SEVEN BUT I AM WORKING FROM     

01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:51.889
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S THREE FOOT    
SEVEN BUT I AM WORKING FROM     
MEMORY HERE.                    

01:14:51.891 --> 01:14:53.657
SEVEN BUT I AM WORKING FROM     
MEMORY HERE.                    
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE ACTUAL    

01:14:53.659 --> 01:14:57.761
MEMORY HERE.                    
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE ACTUAL    
PICTURE OF THE HOUSE.           

01:14:57.763 --> 01:14:58.863
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE ACTUAL    
PICTURE OF THE HOUSE.           
SO I THINK TERESA, YOU HAD TOLD 

01:14:58.865 --> 01:15:01.598
PICTURE OF THE HOUSE.           
SO I THINK TERESA, YOU HAD TOLD 
ME ON SITE THAT IT WOULD START  

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.266
SO I THINK TERESA, YOU HAD TOLD 
ME ON SITE THAT IT WOULD START  
WHERE THAT CLOSET WINDOW IS.    

01:15:02.268 --> 01:15:05.569
ME ON SITE THAT IT WOULD START  
WHERE THAT CLOSET WINDOW IS.    
YES, YEAH.                      

01:15:05.571 --> 01:15:06.636
WHERE THAT CLOSET WINDOW IS.    
YES, YEAH.                      
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE      

01:15:06.638 --> 01:15:09.873
YES, YEAH.                      
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE      
PROPOSED PLAN SO ON THE SECOND  

01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:13.677
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE      
PROPOSED PLAN SO ON THE SECOND  
FLOOR PLAN A ONE OH ONE SO YOU  

01:15:13.679 --> 01:15:14.611
PROPOSED PLAN SO ON THE SECOND  
FLOOR PLAN A ONE OH ONE SO YOU  
CAN SEE WHERE THE WINDOW IS     

01:15:14.613 --> 01:15:17.047
FLOOR PLAN A ONE OH ONE SO YOU  
CAN SEE WHERE THE WINDOW IS     
INFILL THERE ON THE SECOND      

01:15:17.049 --> 01:15:20.684
CAN SEE WHERE THE WINDOW IS     
INFILL THERE ON THE SECOND      
FLOOR AND WE WERE LINING WITH   

01:15:20.686 --> 01:15:21.485
INFILL THERE ON THE SECOND      
FLOOR AND WE WERE LINING WITH   
THAT THOUGH I THINK REALLY IT   

01:15:21.487 --> 01:15:23.820
FLOOR AND WE WERE LINING WITH   
THAT THOUGH I THINK REALLY IT   
HAD TO DO WITH THE CENTER LINE  

01:15:23.822 --> 01:15:27.691
THAT THOUGH I THINK REALLY IT   
HAD TO DO WITH THE CENTER LINE  
OF THE GABLE UP ABOVE.          

01:15:27.693 --> 01:15:31.928
HAD TO DO WITH THE CENTER LINE  
OF THE GABLE UP ABOVE.          
SO ANYWAY WE COULD WE COULD     

01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:32.763
OF THE GABLE UP ABOVE.          
SO ANYWAY WE COULD WE COULD     
BRING IT IN ANOTHER FOOT OR     

01:15:32.765 --> 01:15:33.364
SO ANYWAY WE COULD WE COULD     
BRING IT IN ANOTHER FOOT OR     
SOMETHING IF THAT MADE A        

01:15:33.366 --> 01:15:35.665
BRING IT IN ANOTHER FOOT OR     
SOMETHING IF THAT MADE A        
DIFFERENCE.                     

01:15:35.667 --> 01:15:36.434
SOMETHING IF THAT MADE A        
DIFFERENCE.                     
IT&amp;apos;S ALREADY THREE FOOT SEVEN   

01:15:36.436 --> 01:15:40.104
DIFFERENCE.                     
IT&amp;apos;S ALREADY THREE FOOT SEVEN   
BACK BUT IF YOU KNOW IF FOUR    

01:15:40.106 --> 01:15:40.771
IT&amp;apos;S ALREADY THREE FOOT SEVEN   
BACK BUT IF YOU KNOW IF FOUR    
FOOT SEVEN WAS THE HAPPY MEDIUM 

01:15:40.773 --> 01:15:44.274
BACK BUT IF YOU KNOW IF FOUR    
FOOT SEVEN WAS THE HAPPY MEDIUM 
FOR EVERYONE, WE JUST WE CAN&amp;apos;T  

01:15:44.276 --> 01:15:45.076
FOOT SEVEN WAS THE HAPPY MEDIUM 
FOR EVERYONE, WE JUST WE CAN&amp;apos;T  
EXTEND IT OVER THE TOP OF THE   

01:15:45.078 --> 01:15:46.943
FOR EVERYONE, WE JUST WE CAN&amp;apos;T  
EXTEND IT OVER THE TOP OF THE   
RESTROOM BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S A         

01:15:46.945 --> 01:15:47.411
EXTEND IT OVER THE TOP OF THE   
RESTROOM BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S A         
DIFFERENT HEIGHT.               

01:15:47.413 --> 01:15:50.447
RESTROOM BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S A         
DIFFERENT HEIGHT.               
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SECTION  

01:15:50.449 --> 01:15:51.415
DIFFERENT HEIGHT.               
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SECTION  
THERE THAT&amp;apos;S ON THAT LAST PAGE, 

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:55.218
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SECTION  
THERE THAT&amp;apos;S ON THAT LAST PAGE, 
I THINK IT KIND OF SHOWS THE    

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:59.222
THERE THAT&amp;apos;S ON THAT LAST PAGE, 
I THINK IT KIND OF SHOWS THE    
YEAH, RIGHT WHERE THE WHERE THE 

01:15:59.224 --> 01:15:59.923
I THINK IT KIND OF SHOWS THE    
YEAH, RIGHT WHERE THE WHERE THE 
FIRST FLOOR IS AND WHERE THE    

01:15:59.925 --> 01:16:02.126
YEAH, RIGHT WHERE THE WHERE THE 
FIRST FLOOR IS AND WHERE THE    
FIRST FLOOR CEILING IS WHAT     

01:16:02.128 --> 01:16:06.830
FIRST FLOOR IS AND WHERE THE    
FIRST FLOOR CEILING IS WHAT     
THAT COULD BE JUST DISTINGUISH  

01:16:06.832 --> 01:16:10.300
FIRST FLOOR CEILING IS WHAT     
THAT COULD BE JUST DISTINGUISH  
BETWEEN INTERIOR.               

01:16:10.302 --> 01:16:14.205
THAT COULD BE JUST DISTINGUISH  
BETWEEN INTERIOR.               
SO YOU SHOW WITH THE IS THERE A 

01:16:14.207 --> 01:16:17.675
BETWEEN INTERIOR.               
SO YOU SHOW WITH THE IS THERE A 
DIFFERENT MATERIAL THAT YOU     

01:16:17.677 --> 01:16:18.609
SO YOU SHOW WITH THE IS THERE A 
DIFFERENT MATERIAL THAT YOU     
DIDN&amp;apos;T SHOW YOU CAN LOOK AT IT  

01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:21.612
DIFFERENT MATERIAL THAT YOU     
DIDN&amp;apos;T SHOW YOU CAN LOOK AT IT  
AND YOU SEE WHAT USED TO BE     

01:16:21.614 --> 01:16:25.115
DIDN&amp;apos;T SHOW YOU CAN LOOK AT IT  
AND YOU SEE WHAT USED TO BE     
THERE THAT&amp;apos;S JUST THE THE       

01:16:25.117 --> 01:16:28.852
AND YOU SEE WHAT USED TO BE     
THERE THAT&amp;apos;S JUST THE THE       
DRUDGE REPORT AND ABOVE IT ON   

01:16:28.854 --> 01:16:29.987
THERE THAT&amp;apos;S JUST THE THE       
DRUDGE REPORT AND ABOVE IT ON   
THE SECOND FLOOR WE HAVE A KIND 

01:16:29.989 --> 01:16:33.023
DRUDGE REPORT AND ABOVE IT ON   
THE SECOND FLOOR WE HAVE A KIND 
OF A DIFFERENT MATERIAL, A      

01:16:33.025 --> 01:16:36.560
THE SECOND FLOOR WE HAVE A KIND 
OF A DIFFERENT MATERIAL, A      
DIFFERENT SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE   

01:16:36.562 --> 01:16:37.828
OF A DIFFERENT MATERIAL, A      
DIFFERENT SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE   
WHAT USED TO BE THERE FROM A    

01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:41.231
DIFFERENT SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE   
WHAT USED TO BE THERE FROM A    
LARGE PORTION YET THE SECOND    

01:16:41.233 --> 01:16:41.766
WHAT USED TO BE THERE FROM A    
LARGE PORTION YET THE SECOND    
FLOOR HAS A DIFFERENT           

01:16:41.768 --> 01:16:44.802
LARGE PORTION YET THE SECOND    
FLOOR HAS A DIFFERENT           
DISTINGUISHED YES.              

01:16:44.804 --> 01:16:51.775
FLOOR HAS A DIFFERENT           
DISTINGUISHED YES.              
THAT WOULD BE VERY AGREEABLE    

01:16:51.777 --> 01:16:52.809
DISTINGUISHED YES.              
THAT WOULD BE VERY AGREEABLE    
BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF AN        

01:16:52.811 --> 01:16:55.913
THAT WOULD BE VERY AGREEABLE    
BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF AN        
UNUSUALLY TALL I THINK BECAUSE  

01:16:55.915 --> 01:16:57.214
BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF AN        
UNUSUALLY TALL I THINK BECAUSE  
IT HAS TO SO FAR BACK TO THE    

01:16:57.216 --> 01:16:57.982
UNUSUALLY TALL I THINK BECAUSE  
IT HAS TO SO FAR BACK TO THE    
SOUTH SIDE IN TERMS OF THE      

01:16:57.984 --> 01:17:00.050
IT HAS TO SO FAR BACK TO THE    
SOUTH SIDE IN TERMS OF THE      
PITCH INSIDE.                   

01:17:00.052 --> 01:17:01.318
SOUTH SIDE IN TERMS OF THE      
PITCH INSIDE.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT YEAH, WE COULD LEAVE     

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.755
PITCH INSIDE.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT YEAH, WE COULD LEAVE     
THAT THAT HEIGHT THERE.         

01:17:04.757 --> 01:17:07.158
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT YEAH, WE COULD LEAVE     
THAT THAT HEIGHT THERE.         
IT WOULD BE NICE TO THE ROOF    

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.425
THAT THAT HEIGHT THERE.         
IT WOULD BE NICE TO THE ROOF    
ON TOP OF IT IS THE SHED TO     

01:17:08.427 --> 01:17:11.695
IT WOULD BE NICE TO THE ROOF    
ON TOP OF IT IS THE SHED TO     
SHED WATER OFF OTHERWISE IT&amp;apos;S   

01:17:11.697 --> 01:17:14.865
ON TOP OF IT IS THE SHED TO     
SHED WATER OFF OTHERWISE IT&amp;apos;S   
KIND OF A FLAT ROOF INSIDE THAT 

01:17:14.867 --> 01:17:15.666
SHED WATER OFF OTHERWISE IT&amp;apos;S   
KIND OF A FLAT ROOF INSIDE THAT 
ARE THEN TRYING TO CAPTURE      

01:17:15.668 --> 01:17:16.334
KIND OF A FLAT ROOF INSIDE THAT 
ARE THEN TRYING TO CAPTURE      
WATER AND BRING THROUGH THE     

01:17:16.336 --> 01:17:19.403
ARE THEN TRYING TO CAPTURE      
WATER AND BRING THROUGH THE     
INTERIOR IN THE GUTTER OR       

01:17:19.405 --> 01:17:20.070
WATER AND BRING THROUGH THE     
INTERIOR IN THE GUTTER OR       
SOMETHING AND SHOOT IT OUT      

01:17:20.072 --> 01:17:20.471
INTERIOR IN THE GUTTER OR       
SOMETHING AND SHOOT IT OUT      
THROUGH THERE.                  

01:17:20.473 --> 01:17:23.040
SOMETHING AND SHOOT IT OUT      
THROUGH THERE.                  
SO IT JUST MAKE THINGS A LITTLE 

01:17:23.042 --> 01:17:23.641
THROUGH THERE.                  
SO IT JUST MAKE THINGS A LITTLE 
MORE COMPLICATED FOR WATER      

01:17:23.643 --> 01:17:26.710
SO IT JUST MAKE THINGS A LITTLE 
MORE COMPLICATED FOR WATER      
SHEDDING IF IT WAS JUST THE     

01:17:26.712 --> 01:17:27.445
MORE COMPLICATED FOR WATER      
SHEDDING IF IT WAS JUST THE     
FALSE FRONT WITHOUT A PITCHED   

01:17:27.447 --> 01:17:30.614
SHEDDING IF IT WAS JUST THE     
FALSE FRONT WITHOUT A PITCHED   
ROOF UP ABOVE IT I THINK I      

01:17:30.616 --> 01:17:34.718
FALSE FRONT WITHOUT A PITCHED   
ROOF UP ABOVE IT I THINK I      
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT IT&amp;apos;S HARD TO    

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.419
ROOF UP ABOVE IT I THINK I      
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT IT&amp;apos;S HARD TO    
COMMENT BECAUSE NOW WE&amp;apos;RE JUST

GET YOUR SAME WATER FLOW ISSUE  
AGAIN BECAUSE THE FIRST FLOOR   

01:21:56.182 --> 01:21:59.149
GET YOUR SAME WATER FLOW ISSUE  
AGAIN BECAUSE THE FIRST FLOOR   
DISH BATHROOM WOULD BE HIGHER.  

01:21:59.151 --> 01:22:00.150
AGAIN BECAUSE THE FIRST FLOOR   
DISH BATHROOM WOULD BE HIGHER.
