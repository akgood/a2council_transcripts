VALUE OF THE THE HOUSE THAT HAS 
THAT PROPERTY THAT&apos;S            
NONCONFORMING BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE   

00:31:16.963 --> 00:31:17.862
THAT PROPERTY THAT&apos;S            
NONCONFORMING BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE   
BOTH STILL NOT ENJOYING THEIR

00:31:23.036 --> 00:31:25.370
SO IT&apos;S A PROBLEM ON BOTH ENDS  
AND I I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT     
WOULD DECREASE THE VALUE IF IT  

00:31:25.372 --> 00:31:28.840
AND I I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT     
WOULD DECREASE THE VALUE IF IT  
STAYS AS IS THAT PERHAPS IF IT  

00:31:28.842 --> 00:31:33.144
WOULD DECREASE THE VALUE IF IT

WILL INCREASE THE VALUE OF BOTH 

00:31:34.014 --> 00:31:37.015
HAS THIS TYPE OF FENCE THAT IT  
WILL INCREASE THE VALUE OF BOTH 
PROPERTIES THINKING THAT WE

CONFORMING STRUCTURE OFFERS     
MORE PRIVACY IN THIS SITUATION. 

00:32:19.593 --> 00:32:20.759
CONFORMING STRUCTURE OFFERS     
MORE PRIVACY IN THIS SITUATION.

PROBABLY WOULD HAVE A BETTER    
ANSWER THAN ME.                 

00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:51.976
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE A BETTER    
ANSWER THAN ME.                 
I&apos;VE NEVER BEEN TO THE PROPERTY 

00:34:51.978 --> 00:34:52.644
ANSWER THAN ME.                 
I&apos;VE NEVER BEEN TO THE PROPERTY 
BUT JUST LOOKING AT THIS        

00:34:52.646 --> 00:34:55.146
I&apos;VE NEVER BEEN TO THE PROPERTY 
BUT JUST LOOKING AT THIS        
PICTURE I CAN SEE THAT THE DECK 

00:34:55.148 --> 00:34:56.080
BUT JUST LOOKING AT THIS        
PICTURE I CAN SEE THAT THE DECK 
IS SET HIGHER BUT I THINK       

00:34:56.082 --> 00:34:59.217
PICTURE I CAN SEE THAT THE DECK 
IS SET HIGHER BUT I THINK       
THAT&apos;S BECAUSE IT&apos;S A DECK.     

00:34:59.219 --> 00:35:02.287
IS SET HIGHER BUT I THINK       
THAT&apos;S BECAUSE IT&apos;S A DECK.     
BUT IN TERMS ELEVATION I MEAN I 

00:35:02.289 --> 00:35:06.257
THAT&apos;S BECAUSE IT&apos;S A DECK.     
BUT IN TERMS ELEVATION I MEAN I 
THINK THE MAP SHOWS THAT IT IS  

00:35:06.259 --> 00:35:07.057
BUT IN TERMS ELEVATION I MEAN I 
THINK THE MAP SHOWS THAT IT IS  
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER ELEVATION   

00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:10.127
THINK THE MAP SHOWS THAT IT IS  
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER ELEVATION   
WHICH IS WISE.                  

00:35:10.129 --> 00:35:11.195
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER ELEVATION   
WHICH IS WISE.                  
BUT I THINK THAT WHICH IS WHY I 

00:35:11.197 --> 00:35:14.198
WHICH IS WISE.                  
BUT I THINK THAT WHICH IS WHY I 
LIKE THE EIGHT FOOT VERY LIKE   

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:14.699
BUT I THINK THAT WHICH IS WHY I 
LIKE THE EIGHT FOOT VERY LIKE   
EIGHT FOOT FENCE.               

00:35:14.701 --> 00:35:17.969
LIKE THE EIGHT FOOT VERY LIKE   
EIGHT FOOT FENCE.               
WOULD IT BE ENOUGH UNDERSTOOD.  

00:35:17.971 --> 00:35:19.304
EIGHT FOOT FENCE.               
WOULD IT BE ENOUGH UNDERSTOOD.  
SO AND THEN TO SORT OF PICK UP  

00:35:19.306 --> 00:35:22.239
WOULD IT BE ENOUGH UNDERSTOOD.  
SO AND THEN TO SORT OF PICK UP  
ON WHAT CHRIS&apos;S COMMENT WAS,    

00:35:22.241 --> 00:35:24.942
SO AND THEN TO SORT OF PICK UP  
ON WHAT CHRIS&apos;S COMMENT WAS,    
WAS THAT DOES THAT MAKE THAT    

00:35:24.944 --> 00:35:25.676
ON WHAT CHRIS&apos;S COMMENT WAS,    
WAS THAT DOES THAT MAKE THAT    
MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE     

00:35:25.678 --> 00:35:26.344
WAS THAT DOES THAT MAKE THAT    
MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE     
THREE FOOT SEVEN TO THE FIVE    

00:35:26.346 --> 00:35:26.677
MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE     
THREE FOOT SEVEN TO THE FIVE    
FEET?                           

00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:29.080
THREE FOOT SEVEN TO THE FIVE    
FEET?                           
I THINK IT PERSONALLY.          

00:35:29.082 --> 00:35:32.884
FEET?                           
I THINK IT PERSONALLY.          
AGAIN, THIS IS MY OBSERVATION   

00:35:32.886 --> 00:35:33.751
I THINK IT PERSONALLY.          
AGAIN, THIS IS MY OBSERVATION   
THAT BECAUSE OF THAT FINISHED   

00:35:33.753 --> 00:35:37.421
AGAIN, THIS IS MY OBSERVATION   
THAT BECAUSE OF THAT FINISHED   
FLOOR ELEVATION IS THERE IS TO  

00:35:37.423 --> 00:35:38.189
THAT BECAUSE OF THAT FINISHED   
FLOOR ELEVATION IS THERE IS TO  
ME IT SEEMS SIGNIFICANT AND SO  

00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:41.459
FLOOR ELEVATION IS THERE IS TO  
ME IT SEEMS SIGNIFICANT AND SO  
THAT IS A LITTLE EXACERBATED    

00:35:41.461 --> 00:35:44.995
ME IT SEEMS SIGNIFICANT AND SO  
THAT IS A LITTLE EXACERBATED    
THE CLOSER IT GETS TO THAT LINE 

00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:45.229
THAT IS A LITTLE EXACERBATED    
THE CLOSER IT GETS TO THAT LINE 
.                               

00:35:45.231 --> 00:35:46.163
THE CLOSER IT GETS TO THAT LINE 
.                               
SO IT BRINGS THE ISSUE MORE TO  

00:35:46.165 --> 00:35:49.533
.                               
SO IT BRINGS THE ISSUE MORE TO  
THE SURFACE THAN IF WAS MORE ON 

00:35:49.535 --> 00:35:50.167
SO IT BRINGS THE ISSUE MORE TO  
THE SURFACE THAN IF WAS MORE ON 
FLOOR ELEVATION OF FLOOR        

00:35:50.169 --> 00:35:53.638
THE SURFACE THAN IF WAS MORE ON 
FLOOR ELEVATION OF FLOOR        
ELEVATION EVEN YOU KNOW, ACROSS 

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.205
FLOOR ELEVATION OF FLOOR

00:35:54.207 --> 00:35:57.374
ELEVATION EVEN YOU KNOW, ACROSS 
THE PROPERTY LINE.              
SO FOR MY OBSERVATION HERE IT   

00:35:57.376 --> 00:36:00.611
THE PROPERTY LINE.              
SO FOR MY OBSERVATION HERE IT   
DOESN&apos;T BUT SO THAT&apos;S ALL I     

00:36:00.613 --> 00:36:01.579

JOHN OR WHOEVER WAS IN THE      

00:53:46.812 --> 00:53:47.578
VERY EASY RIGHT.                
JOHN OR WHOEVER WAS IN THE      
POSITION PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED    

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.311
JOHN OR WHOEVER WAS IN THE      
POSITION PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED    
THIS PLAN THAT WAS INCOME FORM. 

00:53:48.313 --> 00:53:48.979
POSITION PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED    
THIS PLAN THAT WAS INCOME FORM. 
&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S THE RULES AND EVEN IF   

00:53:48.981 --> 00:53:49.780
THIS PLAN THAT WAS INCOME FORM. 
&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S THE RULES AND EVEN IF   
THERE WAS A RULE THAT THAT JOHN 

00:53:49.782 --> 00:53:50.514
&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S THE RULES AND EVEN IF   
THERE WAS A RULE THAT THAT JOHN 
OR WHOEVER IT WAS IN THE

THERE WAS A RULE THAT THAT JOHN

BUILDING DEPARTMENT HAD TO GO   
OUT AND MEASURE ON SITE,        

00:53:54.253 --> 00:53:54.984
BUILDING DEPARTMENT HAD TO GO   
OUT AND MEASURE ON SITE,        
THERE&apos;S STILL LITTLE WAY TO     

00:53:54.986 --> 00:53:58.022
OUT AND MEASURE ON SITE,        
THERE&apos;S STILL LITTLE WAY TO     
CONFIRM WHERE THE PROPERTY LINE 

00:53:58.024 --> 00:53:58.956
THERE&apos;S STILL LITTLE WAY TO     
CONFIRM WHERE THE PROPERTY LINE 
ACTUALLY IS EVEN IF IT&apos;S MARKED 

00:53:58.958 --> 00:54:01.891
CONFIRM WHERE THE PROPERTY LINE 
ACTUALLY IS EVEN IF IT&apos;S MARKED 
THERE&apos;S NO WAY TO DETERMINE     

00:54:01.893 --> 00:54:02.893
ACTUALLY IS EVEN IF IT&apos;S MARKED 
THERE&apos;S NO WAY TO DETERMINE     
THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY PRECISE.  

00:54:02.895 --> 00:54:06.430
THERE&apos;S NO WAY TO DETERMINE     
THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY PRECISE.  
&gt;&gt; AND SO YOU KNOW, A FOOT OR   

00:54:06.432 --> 00:54:09.933
THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY PRECISE.  
&gt;&gt; AND SO YOU KNOW, A FOOT OR   
TWO IS PROBABLY VERY COMMON IN  

00:54:09.935 --> 00:54:10.401
&gt;&gt; AND SO YOU KNOW, A FOOT OR   
TWO IS PROBABLY VERY COMMON IN  
ALL COMMUNITIES.                

00:54:10.403 --> 00:54:13.403
TWO IS PROBABLY VERY COMMON IN  
ALL COMMUNITIES.                
&gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW, JUST KIND       

00:54:13.405 --> 00:54:14.204
ALL COMMUNITIES.                
&gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW, JUST KIND       
OF GENERALLY HOW THAT HAPPENS,  

00:54:14.206 --> 00:54:17.107
&gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW, JUST KIND       
OF GENERALLY HOW THAT HAPPENS,  
IT&apos;S REALLY EASY.               

00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:18.776
OF GENERALLY HOW THAT HAPPENS,  
IT&apos;S REALLY EASY.               
&gt;&gt; AND SO MY GENERAL THOUGHTS   

00:54:18.778 --> 00:54:24.114
IT&apos;S REALLY EASY.               
&gt;&gt; AND SO MY GENERAL THOUGHTS   
ARE TWO WRONGS DON&apos;T MAKE A     

00:54:24.116 --> 00:54:27.984
&gt;&gt; AND SO MY GENERAL THOUGHTS   
ARE TWO WRONGS DON&apos;T MAKE A     
RIGHT I I THINK WE&apos;RE TALKING   

00:54:27.986 --> 00:54:30.620
ARE TWO WRONGS DON&apos;T MAKE A     
RIGHT I I THINK WE&apos;RE TALKING   
ABOUT THE SELF-IMPOSED HARDSHIP 

00:54:30.622 --> 00:54:34.257
RIGHT I I THINK WE&apos;RE TALKING   
ABOUT THE SELF-IMPOSED HARDSHIP 
IN THE WRONG WAY.               

00:54:34.259 --> 00:54:35.159
ABOUT THE SELF-IMPOSED HARDSHIP 
IN THE WRONG WAY.               
THE THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY IS 

00:54:35.161 --> 00:54:38.128
IN THE WRONG WAY.               
THE THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT PREVENTS    

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:39.062
THE THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT PREVENTS    
THIS PERSON FROM COMPLYING AND  

00:54:39.064 --> 00:54:39.662
SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT PREVENTS    
THIS PERSON FROM COMPLYING AND  
THE ANSWER IS NOTHING.          

00:54:39.664 --> 00:54:42.733
THIS PERSON FROM COMPLYING AND  
THE ANSWER IS NOTHING.          
&gt;&gt; AN EIGHT FOOT FENCE COULD GO 

00:54:42.735 --> 00:54:43.400
THE ANSWER IS NOTHING.          
&gt;&gt; AN EIGHT FOOT FENCE COULD GO 
THERE WITHOUT WITH THESE.       

00:54:43.402 --> 00:54:43.734
&gt;&gt; AN EIGHT FOOT FENCE COULD GO 
THERE WITHOUT WITH THESE.       
RIGHT.                          

00:54:43.736 --> 00:54:46.337
THERE WITHOUT WITH THESE.       
RIGHT.                          
SO THERE&apos;S NO PRACTICAL         

00:54:46.339 --> 00:54:47.170
RIGHT.                          
SO THERE&apos;S NO PRACTICAL         
DIFFICULTY PREVENTING YOU FROM  

00:54:47.172 --> 00:54:50.240
SO THERE&apos;S NO PRACTICAL         
DIFFICULTY PREVENTING YOU FROM  
COMPLYING.                      

00:54:50.242 --> 00:54:51.308
DIFFICULTY PREVENTING YOU FROM  
COMPLYING.                      
&gt;&gt; SO IN THAT WAY I FIND THAT   

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.376
COMPLYING.                      
&gt;&gt; SO IN THAT WAY I FIND THAT   
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY NOT    

00:54:53.378 --> 00:54:54.244
&gt;&gt; SO IN THAT WAY I FIND THAT   
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY NOT    
ONLY IS THAT IS SELF IMPOSED,   

00:54:54.246 --> 00:54:57.414
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY NOT    
ONLY IS THAT IS SELF IMPOSED,   
IT JUST DOESN&apos;T EXIST.          

00:54:57.416 --> 00:54:58.482
ONLY IS THAT IS SELF IMPOSED,   
IT JUST DOESN&apos;T EXIST.          
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T BELIEVE THAT THAT IF 

00:54:58.484 --> 00:55:02.019
IT JUST DOESN&apos;T EXIST.          
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T BELIEVE THAT THAT IF 
A HOUSE WAS FIVE FEET AWAY      

00:55:02.021 --> 00:55:02.886
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T BELIEVE THAT THAT IF 
A HOUSE WAS FIVE FEET AWAY      
VERSUS THREE POINT SEVEN FEET   

00:55:02.888 --> 00:55:03.620
A HOUSE WAS FIVE FEET AWAY      
VERSUS THREE POINT SEVEN FEET   
AWAY THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY    

00:55:03.622 --> 00:55:05.689
VERSUS THREE POINT SEVEN FEET   
AWAY THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY    
LESS PRIVACY ISSUES.            

00:55:05.691 --> 00:55:06.689
AWAY THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY    
LESS PRIVACY ISSUES.            
&gt;&gt; NOR DO I BELIEVE THAT THERE  

00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:09.460
LESS PRIVACY ISSUES.            
&gt;&gt; NOR DO I BELIEVE THAT THERE  
WOULD BE ANY BETTER PLANTING    

00:55:09.462 --> 00:55:10.193
&gt;&gt; NOR DO I BELIEVE THAT THERE  
WOULD BE ANY BETTER PLANTING    
CONDITIONS FOR TREES THAN       

00:55:10.195 --> 00:55:13.496
WOULD BE ANY BETTER PLANTING    
CONDITIONS FOR TREES THAN       
EXISTS TODAY.                   

00:55:13.498 --> 00:55:17.501
CONDITIONS FOR TREES THAN       
EXISTS TODAY.                   
&gt;&gt; I I DISAGREE THAT THERE      

00:55:17.503 --> 00:55:18.302
EXISTS TODAY.                   
&gt;&gt; I I DISAGREE THAT THERE      
CANNOT BE ADEQUATE LIVING       

00:55:18.304 --> 00:55:21.438
&gt;&gt; I I DISAGREE THAT THERE      
CANNOT BE ADEQUATE LIVING       
SCREEN PLANTED HERE OR          

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:21.772
CANNOT BE ADEQUATE LIVING       
SCREEN PLANTED HERE OR          
ANYWHERE.                       

00:55:21.774 --> 00:55:25.308
SCREEN PLANTED HERE OR          
ANYWHERE.                       
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE CAN BE DESPITE 

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:26.109
ANYWHERE.                       
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE CAN BE DESPITE 
A DIFFICULT CLIMATE AT          

00:55:26.111 --> 00:55:29.013
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE CAN BE DESPITE 
A DIFFICULT CLIMATE AT          
SOMETIMES AND THEN JUST TO      

00:55:29.015 --> 00:55:32.682
A DIFFICULT CLIMATE AT          
SOMETIMES AND THEN JUST TO      
ADDRESS THE STANDARDS GIVEN THE 

00:55:32.684 --> 00:55:36.986
SOMETIMES AND THEN JUST TO      
ADDRESS THE STANDARDS GIVEN THE 
LACK OF WINDOWS ON THE SIDE     

00:55:36.988 --> 00:55:37.921
ADDRESS THE STANDARDS GIVEN THE 
LACK OF WINDOWS ON THE SIDE     
OF THE HOUSE, THE SUBJECTS ARE  

00:55:37.923 --> 00:55:42.726
LACK OF WINDOWS ON THE SIDE     
OF THE HOUSE, THE SUBJECTS ARE  
PROPERTY OF THE HOUSE.          

00:55:42.728 --> 00:55:43.594
OF THE HOUSE, THE SUBJECTS ARE  
PROPERTY OF THE HOUSE.          
&gt;&gt; SO WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT       

00:55:43.596 --> 00:55:46.496
PROPERTY OF THE HOUSE.          
&gt;&gt; SO WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT       
BACKYARD PRIVACY RIGHT FOR ONE  

00:55:46.498 --> 00:55:47.431
&gt;&gt; SO WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT       
BACKYARD PRIVACY RIGHT FOR ONE  
PERSON, ONE HOUSE WHICH WOULD   

00:55:47.433 --> 00:55:50.867
BACKYARD PRIVACY RIGHT FOR ONE  
PERSON, ONE HOUSE WHICH WOULD   
NOT BE IMPROVED WITH A          

00:55:50.869 --> 00:55:51.568
PERSON, ONE HOUSE WHICH WOULD   
NOT BE IMPROVED WITH A          
CONFORMING STRUCTURE IN MY

CONFORMING STRUCTURE IN MY      
OPINION THAT IS TO ME AN

CONFORMING STRUCTURE IN MY      
OPINION THAT IS TO ME AN        
INCONVENIENCE I UNDERSTAND      

00:55:58.544 --> 00:55:59.275
OPINION THAT IS TO ME AN        
INCONVENIENCE I UNDERSTAND      
PEOPLE LIKE BACKYARD PRIVACY    

00:55:59.277 --> 00:56:02.979
INCONVENIENCE I UNDERSTAND      
PEOPLE LIKE BACKYARD PRIVACY    
BUT SLIGHTLY LESS IS AN         

00:56:02.981 --> 00:56:03.480
PEOPLE LIKE BACKYARD PRIVACY    
BUT SLIGHTLY LESS IS AN         
INCONVENIENCE TO ME.            

00:56:03.482 --> 00:56:05.648
BUT SLIGHTLY LESS IS AN         
INCONVENIENCE TO ME.            
I THINK THEY HAVE FAILED TO

I THINK THEY HAVE FAILED TO     
MEET STANDARD B.                

00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:09.386
I THINK THEY HAVE FAILED TO     
MEET STANDARD B.                
I ALSO DON&apos;T THINK THAT THEY    

00:56:09.388 --> 00:56:10.186

I ALSO DON&apos;T THINK THAT THEY    
MEET THE STANDARD SEE           

00:56:10.188 --> 00:56:17.560
I ALSO DON&apos;T THINK THAT THEY    
MEET THE STANDARD SEE           
SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE IF IF WE    

00:56:17.562 --> 00:56:18.562
MEET THE STANDARD SEE           
SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE IF IF WE    
SAY THAT IT IS A PRACTICAL

SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE IF IF WE

ANSWERED DID YOU WANT TO GO     

01:16:51.595 --> 01:16:52.294
QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN        
ANSWERED DID YOU WANT TO GO     
OVER THE SLIDES THAT WERE HERE  

01:16:52.296 --> 01:16:52.895
ANSWERED DID YOU WANT TO GO     
OVER THE SLIDES THAT WERE HERE  
AT THE END OR NO.

OVER THE SLIDES THAT WERE HERE  
AT THE END OR NO.               
YOU KNOW, I YEAH, I COULD       

01:16:55.099 --> 01:16:55.831
AT THE END OR NO.               
YOU KNOW, I YEAH, I COULD       
DEMONSTRATE IN ONE OF THOSE     

01:16:55.833 --> 01:16:56.565
YOU KNOW, I YEAH, I COULD       
DEMONSTRATE IN ONE OF THOSE     
SITES I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE     

01:16:56.567 --> 01:16:59.367
DEMONSTRATE IN ONE OF THOSE     
SITES I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE     
PRINTOUTS THAT WE ARE WELL      

01:16:59.369 --> 01:17:00.036
SITES I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE     
PRINTOUTS THAT WE ARE WELL      
BEYOND I MEAN ORDERS            

01:17:00.038 --> 01:17:03.072
PRINTOUTS THAT WE ARE WELL      
BEYOND I MEAN ORDERS            
OF MAGNITUDE BEYOND THE RECORD  

01:17:03.074 --> 01:17:04.073
BEYOND I MEAN ORDERS            
OF MAGNITUDE BEYOND THE RECORD  
SETBACK FOR MOST OF THE LENGTH  

01:17:04.075 --> 01:17:06.742
OF MAGNITUDE BEYOND THE RECORD  
SETBACK FOR MOST OF THE LENGTH  
OF THE BUILDING TWO HUNDRED     

01:17:06.744 --> 01:17:07.609
SETBACK FOR MOST OF THE LENGTH  
OF THE BUILDING TWO HUNDRED     
FEET YOU KNOW, AS YOU GET       

01:17:07.611 --> 01:17:09.812
OF THE BUILDING TWO HUNDRED     
FEET YOU KNOW, AS YOU GET       
FARTHER AND FARTHER THERE&apos;S     

01:17:09.814 --> 01:17:10.612
FEET YOU KNOW, AS YOU GET       
FARTHER AND FARTHER THERE&apos;S     
SOME DIAGONAL DISTANCES THERE.  

01:17:10.614 --> 01:17:14.382
FARTHER AND FARTHER THERE&apos;S     
SOME DIAGONAL DISTANCES THERE.  
SO I THINK FROM FROM THE        

01:17:14.384 --> 01:17:15.051
SOME DIAGONAL DISTANCES THERE.  
SO I THINK FROM FROM THE        
CONCEPT OF HOW HOW DO WE HOW    

01:17:15.053 --> 01:17:17.986
SO I THINK FROM FROM THE        
CONCEPT OF HOW HOW DO WE HOW    
WOULD YOU LOOK AT IT AS AN      

01:17:17.988 --> 01:17:18.820
CONCEPT OF HOW HOW DO WE HOW    
WOULD YOU LOOK AT IT AS AN      
AVERAGE THAT WE&apos;RE WAY OVER THE 

01:17:18.822 --> 01:17:19.388
WOULD YOU LOOK AT IT AS AN      
AVERAGE THAT WE&apos;RE WAY OVER THE 
REQUIREMENT ONE MINUTE          

01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:21.990
AVERAGE THAT WE&apos;RE WAY OVER THE 
REQUIREMENT ONE MINUTE          
REMAINING GOOD.                 

01:17:21.992 --> 01:17:25.861
REQUIREMENT ONE MINUTE          
REMAINING GOOD.                 
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE 

01:17:25.863 --> 01:17:28.897
REMAINING GOOD.                 
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE 
APPLICATION OF THE QUESTION?    

01:17:28.899 --> 01:17:29.965
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE 
APPLICATION OF THE QUESTION?    
I NOTICE IN THE IN THE PACKET   

01:17:29.967 --> 01:17:33.469
APPLICATION OF THE QUESTION?    
I NOTICE IN THE IN THE PACKET   
IT JUST IT MADE MENTION THAT    

01:17:33.471 --> 01:17:36.872
I NOTICE IN THE IN THE PACKET   
IT JUST IT MADE MENTION THAT    
THERE A VERTICAL INCREASE WAS   

01:17:36.874 --> 01:17:39.942
IT JUST IT MADE MENTION THAT    
THERE A VERTICAL INCREASE WAS   
EVALUATED.                      

01:17:39.944 --> 01:17:41.143
THERE A VERTICAL INCREASE WAS   
EVALUATED.                      
DID YOU WANT TO JUST SPEAK TO   

01:17:41.145 --> 01:17:41.710
EVALUATED.                      
DID YOU WANT TO JUST SPEAK TO   
THAT A LITTLE BIT.              

01:17:41.712 --> 01:17:42.344
DID YOU WANT TO JUST SPEAK TO   
THAT A LITTLE BIT.              
SO SAYS HERE WITHOUT THE        

01:17:42.346 --> 01:17:42.978
THAT A LITTLE BIT.              
SO SAYS HERE WITHOUT THE        
VARIANCE THAT THE BALANCE       

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.513
SO SAYS HERE WITHOUT THE        
VARIANCE THAT THE BALANCE       
OF DENSITY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED 

01:17:44.515 --> 01:17:45.247
VARIANCE THAT THE BALANCE       
OF DENSITY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED 
BY HIGHER BUILDING HEIGHT I     

01:17:45.249 --> 01:17:47.983
OF DENSITY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED 
BY HIGHER BUILDING HEIGHT I     
GUESS MAYBE THAT HAS REALLY     

01:17:47.985 --> 01:17:48.717
BY HIGHER BUILDING HEIGHT I     
GUESS MAYBE THAT HAS REALLY     
BEEN STUDIED AT ALL.            

01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:49.151
GUESS MAYBE THAT HAS REALLY     
BEEN STUDIED AT ALL.            
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        

01:17:49.153 --> 01:17:50.252
BEEN STUDIED AT ALL.            
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO    

01:17:50.254 --> 01:17:52.854
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO    
TAKE UNITS IF WE DIDN&apos;T GET THE 

01:17:52.856 --> 01:17:53.622
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO    
TAKE UNITS IF WE DIDN&apos;T GET THE 
VARIANCE WE COULDN&apos;T BUILD OVER 

01:17:53.624 --> 01:17:56.225
TAKE UNITS IF WE DIDN&apos;T GET THE 
VARIANCE WE COULDN&apos;T BUILD OVER 
THE EXISTING IMPERVIOUS AREA,   

01:17:56.227 --> 01:17:56.959
VARIANCE WE COULDN&apos;T BUILD OVER 
THE EXISTING IMPERVIOUS AREA,   
THOSE UNITS COULD IN THEORY BE  

01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:59.895
THE EXISTING IMPERVIOUS AREA,   
THOSE UNITS COULD IN THEORY BE  
PILED ON TOP OF THE BUILDING.   

01:17:59.897 --> 01:18:00.862
THOSE UNITS COULD IN THEORY BE  
PILED ON TOP OF THE BUILDING.   
THE ISSUE IS ONE                

01:18:00.864 --> 01:18:01.596
PILED ON TOP OF THE BUILDING.   
THE ISSUE IS ONE                
OF CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY CAN  

01:18:01.598 --> 01:18:03.799
THE ISSUE IS ONE                
OF CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY CAN  
COST.                           

01:18:03.801 --> 01:18:04.800
OF CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY CAN  
COST.                           
SO THE MICHIGAN BUILDING        

01:18:04.802 --> 01:18:08.070
COST.                           
SO THE MICHIGAN BUILDING        
CODE REQUIRES CHANGES IN        

01:18:08.072 --> 01:18:08.803
SO THE MICHIGAN BUILDING        
CODE REQUIRES CHANGES IN        
CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY BASED   

01:18:08.805 --> 01:18:09.137
CODE REQUIRES CHANGES IN        
CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY BASED   
ON HEIGHT.                      

01:18:09.139 --> 01:18:11.507
CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY BASED   
ON HEIGHT.                      
SO THE FIVE STAR THAT WE&apos;RE     

01:18:11.509 --> 01:18:12.241
ON HEIGHT.                      
SO THE FIVE STAR THAT WE&apos;RE     
PROPOSING IS THE TALLEST THAT A 

01:18:12.243 --> 01:18:15.711
SO THE FIVE STAR THAT WE&apos;RE     
PROPOSING IS THE TALLEST THAT A 
BUILDING CAN BE BUILT USING     

01:18:15.713 --> 01:18:16.512
PROPOSING IS THE TALLEST THAT A 
BUILDING CAN BE BUILT USING     
WOOD FRAME CONSTRUCTION OFTEN   

01:18:16.514 --> 01:18:19.181
BUILDING CAN BE BUILT USING     
WOOD FRAME CONSTRUCTION OFTEN   
CALLED STICK CONSTRUCTION.

MAKE THE PROJECT FINANCIALLY    

01:18:24.021 --> 01:18:24.486
CONSTRUCTION WHICH WOULDN&apos;T     
MAKE THE PROJECT FINANCIALLY    
FEASIBLE I THINK.               

01:18:24.488 --> 01:18:27.622
MAKE THE PROJECT FINANCIALLY    
FEASIBLE I THINK.               
OK, ARE THERE ANY OTHER
