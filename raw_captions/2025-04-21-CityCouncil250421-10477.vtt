ELIMINATING A DESIGN REVIEW     

01:47:11.757 --> 01:47:12.423
THAT SUGGESTED THAT BY          
ELIMINATING A DESIGN REVIEW     
BOARD WE'RE ELIMINATING DESIGN  

01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:16.226
ELIMINATING A DESIGN REVIEW     
BOARD WE'RE ELIMINATING DESIGN

THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE IDEA   
HERE IS TO REASSIGN DESIGN      
REVIEW AND INTEGRATE IT INTO    

01:47:24.203 --> 01:47:27.537
HERE IS TO REASSIGN DESIGN

THE EXISTING PROCESS RATHER     
THAN HAVING DESIGN REVIEW OCCUR 
BY A SECOND BY A SEPARATE BOARD 

01:47:31.977 --> 01:47:38.482
THAN HAVING DESIGN REVIEW OCCUR 
BY A SECOND BY A SEPARATE BOARD 
WHICH HAS ITS OWN PROCESS       

01:47:52.364 --> 01:47:54.331
                          AND

SUBMISSION OF THE SITE AND      

01:47:54.333 --> 01:47:55.131
HAPPENS REALLY, REALLY HOLDS UP 
SUBMISSION OF THE SITE AND      
THAT'S WHAT THE DESIGN REVIEW   

01:47:55.133 --> 01:47:55.866
SUBMISSION OF THE SITE AND      
THAT'S WHAT THE DESIGN REVIEW   
PROCESS AS IT IS CURRENTLY
