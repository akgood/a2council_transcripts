MISSING ABOUT ONE POINT TWO     
MILLION DOLLARS OF PUBLIC       

01:19:22.573 --> 01:19:23.538
MISSING ABOUT ONE POINT TWO     
MILLION DOLLARS OF PUBLIC       
BENEFIT AND I WOULD LIKE THAT   

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.206
MILLION DOLLARS OF PUBLIC       
BENEFIT AND I WOULD LIKE THAT   
TO BE EXTERNALIZE IF THAT       

01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:30.945
BENEFIT AND I WOULD LIKE THAT   
TO BE EXTERNALIZE IF THAT       
NUMBER IS IN FACT THE CASE.     

01:19:30.947 --> 01:19:35.350
TO BE EXTERNALIZE IF THAT       
NUMBER IS IN FACT THE CASE.     
OK, THAT&apos;S WHERE I&apos;LL START.    

01:19:35.352 --> 01:19:36.351
NUMBER IS IN FACT THE CASE.     
OK, THAT&apos;S WHERE I&apos;LL START.    
SO WHY DON&apos;T WE GO WITH THE     

01:19:36.353 --> 01:19:37.085
OK, THAT&apos;S WHERE I&apos;LL START.    
SO WHY DON&apos;T WE GO WITH THE     
BIKE PARKING IF SOMEONE HAS AN  

01:19:37.087 --> 01:19:41.523
SO WHY DON&apos;T WE GO WITH THE     
BIKE PARKING IF SOMEONE HAS AN  
ANSWER FOR THAT ONE IT&apos;S GOING  

01:19:41.525 --> 01:19:45.794
BIKE PARKING IF SOMEONE HAS AN  
ANSWER FOR THAT ONE IT&apos;S GOING  
TO IF YOU CAN PULL UP THE BIKE  

01:19:45.796 --> 01:19:48.597
ANSWER FOR THAT ONE IT&apos;S GOING  
TO IF YOU CAN PULL UP THE BIKE  
PARK BASICALLY WE HAVE RIGHT    

01:19:48.599 --> 01:19:49.598
TO IF YOU CAN PULL UP THE BIKE  
PARK BASICALLY WE HAVE RIGHT    
PARKING IN TWO LEVELS STACK ON

TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT OTHER     
ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE THERE      
ISN&apos;T ENOUGH ELECTRIC CAPACITY  

01:23:12.636 --> 01:23:15.371
ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE THERE      
ISN&apos;T ENOUGH ELECTRIC CAPACITY  
IN THAT PART OF THE GRID.       

01:23:15.373 --> 01:23:16.772
ISN&apos;T ENOUGH ELECTRIC CAPACITY  
IN THAT PART OF THE GRID.       
WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET ABOUT   

01:23:16.774 --> 01:23:19.808
IN THAT PART OF THE GRID.       
WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET ABOUT   
HALF OF ELECTRICITY WE WOULD    

01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:20.409
WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET ABOUT   
HALF OF ELECTRICITY WE WOULD    
NEED TO MAKE THEM ALL

NEED TO MAKE THEM ALL           
ELECTRICAL.                     
SO WE SENT OUR ENGINEERS ABOUT  

01:23:22.613 --> 01:23:26.681
ELECTRICAL.                     
SO WE SENT OUR ENGINEERS ABOUT  
IT COMING UP WITH A DESIGN THAT 

01:23:26.683 --> 01:23:27.582
SO WE SENT OUR ENGINEERS ABOUT  
IT COMING UP WITH A DESIGN THAT 
WOULD GIVE US A STOPGAP MEASURE 

01:23:27.584 --> 01:23:31.086
IT COMING UP WITH A DESIGN THAT 
WOULD GIVE US A STOPGAP MEASURE 
UNTIL WE COULD GET TO A POINT   

01:23:31.088 --> 01:23:31.787
WOULD GIVE US A STOPGAP MEASURE 
UNTIL WE COULD GET TO A POINT   
WHERE THE GRID WAS LOCATED IN   

01:23:31.789 --> 01:23:32.588
UNTIL WE COULD GET TO A POINT   
WHERE THE GRID WAS LOCATED IN   
THE CITY COULD PROVIDE ENOUGH   

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:35.123
WHERE THE GRID WAS LOCATED IN   
THE CITY COULD PROVIDE ENOUGH   
ELECTRICITY TO OUR TO OUR       

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:35.524
THE CITY COULD PROVIDE ENOUGH   
ELECTRICITY TO OUR TO OUR       
PROJECT.                        

01:23:35.526 --> 01:23:38.761
ELECTRICITY TO OUR TO OUR       
PROJECT.                        
AND SO WHAT&apos;S BEEN EVOLVING IS  

01:23:38.763 --> 01:23:39.161
PROJECT.                        
AND SO WHAT&apos;S BEEN EVOLVING IS  
THE DESIGN.                     

01:23:39.163 --> 01:23:41.463
AND SO WHAT&apos;S BEEN EVOLVING IS  
THE DESIGN.                     
SO WE&apos;RE PRIMARILY ELECTRIC     

01:23:41.465 --> 01:23:45.500
THE DESIGN.                     
SO WE&apos;RE PRIMARILY ELECTRIC     
THAT IS TO SAY OUR ELECTRIC     

01:23:45.502 --> 01:23:46.301
SO WE&apos;RE PRIMARILY ELECTRIC     
THAT IS TO SAY OUR ELECTRIC     
BOILERS ARE PRIMARILY ELECTRIC  

01:23:46.303 --> 01:23:49.537
THAT IS TO SAY OUR ELECTRIC     
BOILERS ARE PRIMARILY ELECTRIC  
BUT THEY HAVE AUXILIARY GAS     

01:23:49.539 --> 01:23:50.472
BOILERS ARE PRIMARILY ELECTRIC  
BUT THEY HAVE AUXILIARY GAS     
COMPONENT TO THEM SO THAT IN    

01:23:50.474 --> 01:23:53.808
BUT THEY HAVE AUXILIARY GAS     
COMPONENT TO THEM SO THAT IN    
PEAK PERIODS OF TIME TIME WHEN  

01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:54.476
COMPONENT TO THEM SO THAT IN    
PEAK PERIODS OF TIME TIME WHEN  
PEOPLE ARE SHOWERING IN THE     

01:23:54.478 --> 01:23:57.112
PEAK PERIODS OF TIME TIME WHEN  
PEOPLE ARE SHOWERING IN THE     
MORNING OR OR TIMES WHEN THE    

01:23:57.114 --> 01:24:00.983
PEOPLE ARE SHOWERING IN THE     
MORNING OR OR TIMES WHEN THE    
TEMPERATURE IS MINUS 20 OUTSIDE 

01:24:00.985 --> 01:24:01.717
MORNING OR OR TIMES WHEN THE    
TEMPERATURE IS MINUS 20 OUTSIDE 
AND THERE JUST ISN&apos;T ENOUGH     

01:24:01.719 --> 01:24:04.920
TEMPERATURE IS MINUS 20 OUTSIDE 
AND THERE JUST ISN&apos;T ENOUGH     
CAPACITY WHAT WE CAN GET FROM   

01:24:04.922 --> 01:24:05.787
AND THERE JUST ISN&apos;T ENOUGH     
CAPACITY WHAT WE CAN GET FROM   
ELECTRICITY WE HAVE THE ABILITY 

01:24:05.789 --> 01:24:08.957
CAPACITY WHAT WE CAN GET FROM   
ELECTRICITY WE HAVE THE ABILITY 
TEMPORARILY TO USE AUXILIARY    

01:24:08.959 --> 01:24:09.224
ELECTRICITY WE HAVE THE ABILITY 
TEMPORARILY TO USE AUXILIARY    
GAS.                            

01:24:09.226 --> 01:24:12.828
TEMPORARILY TO USE AUXILIARY    
GAS.                            
I THINK YOU PROBABLY MAY        

01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:13.695
GAS.                            
I THINK YOU PROBABLY MAY        
REMEMBER THAT THAT&apos;S A SIMILAR  

01:24:13.697 --> 01:24:16.798
I THINK YOU PROBABLY MAY        
REMEMBER THAT THAT&apos;S A SIMILAR  
SITUATION IN A HOTEL RECENTLY   

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.632
REMEMBER THAT THAT&apos;S A SIMILAR  
SITUATION IN A HOTEL RECENTLY   
APPROVED HERE AND THEY HAD THE  

01:24:17.634 --> 01:24:18.000
SITUATION IN A HOTEL RECENTLY   
APPROVED HERE AND THEY HAD THE  
SAME PROBLEM.                   

01:24:18.002 --> 01:24:20.569
APPROVED HERE AND THEY HAD THE  
SAME PROBLEM.                   
ISN&apos;T THE ELECTRIC CAPACITY IS  

01:24:20.571 --> 01:24:20.836
SAME PROBLEM.                   
ISN&apos;T THE ELECTRIC CAPACITY IS  
IT?                             

01:24:20.838 --> 01:24:22.036
ISN&apos;T THE ELECTRIC CAPACITY IS  
IT?                             
WE ALSO COME UP WITH AN

FOUNDATION FOOTINGS SO WE CAN   
USE GROUND SOURCE HEAT PUMPS TO 
AUGMENT THAT TO REALLY MINIMIZE 

01:24:35.986 --> 01:24:36.818
USE GROUND SOURCE HEAT PUMPS TO

01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:03.691
THAT&apos;S NOT THE PROPOSAL FOR US. 
IT&apos;S FOR A D AND SO I DON&apos;T     
THINK THAT THE DENSITY I DON&apos;T  

01:33:03.693 --> 01:33:04.558
IT&apos;S FOR A D AND SO I DON&apos;T     
THINK THAT THE DENSITY I DON&apos;T  
THINK THAT AGAIN THE PUBLIC     

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.729
THINK THAT THE DENSITY I DON&apos;T  
THINK THAT AGAIN THE PUBLIC     
DENSITY ALONE MEETS OUR         

01:33:07.731 --> 01:33:08.396
THINK THAT AGAIN THE PUBLIC     
DENSITY ALONE MEETS OUR         
STANDARDS AND I THINK THAT      

01:33:08.398 --> 01:33:09.264
DENSITY ALONE MEETS OUR         
STANDARDS AND I THINK THAT      
THERE IS ANOTHER DISTRICT THAT  

01:33:09.266 --> 01:33:11.333
STANDARDS AND I THINK THAT      
THERE IS ANOTHER DISTRICT THAT  
DOES THAT.                      

01:33:11.335 --> 01:33:12.433
THERE IS ANOTHER DISTRICT THAT  
DOES THAT.                      
SO WHAT WOULD THE PUBLIC        

01:33:12.435 --> 01:33:15.302
DOES THAT.                      
SO WHAT WOULD THE PUBLIC        
BENEFIT BE?                     

01:33:15.304 --> 01:33:16.371
SO WHAT WOULD THE PUBLIC        
BENEFIT BE?                     
AND IN MY MIND IT&apos;S MAXING OUT  

01:33:16.373 --> 01:33:17.171
BENEFIT BE?                     
AND IN MY MIND IT&apos;S MAXING OUT  
THE SUSTAINABILITY WHICH MIGHT  

01:33:17.173 --> 01:33:18.506
AND IN MY MIND IT&apos;S MAXING OUT  
THE SUSTAINABILITY WHICH MIGHT  
BE CHALLENGING HERE.            

01:33:18.508 --> 01:33:19.640
THE SUSTAINABILITY WHICH MIGHT  
BE CHALLENGING HERE.            
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THE 

01:33:19.642 --> 01:33:22.510
BE CHALLENGING HERE.            
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THE 
REASON MY UNDERSTANDING BEYOND  

01:33:22.512 --> 01:33:23.311
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THE 
REASON MY UNDERSTANDING BEYOND  
THE REASON FOR NO NATURAL GAS   

01:33:23.313 --> 01:33:26.514
REASON MY UNDERSTANDING BEYOND  
THE REASON FOR NO NATURAL GAS   
CONNECTIONS IS THAT ONCE YOU    

01:33:26.516 --> 01:33:27.348
THE REASON FOR NO NATURAL GAS   
CONNECTIONS IS THAT ONCE YOU    
HAVE BUILDINGS THAT ARE HOOKED  

01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:28.149
CONNECTIONS IS THAT ONCE YOU    
HAVE BUILDINGS THAT ARE HOOKED  
UP TO NATURAL GAS, IT&apos;S HARDER  

01:33:28.151 --> 01:33:31.152
HAVE BUILDINGS THAT ARE HOOKED  
UP TO NATURAL GAS, IT&apos;S HARDER  
TO BIGGENDEN THOSE LINES IN THE 

01:33:31.154 --> 01:33:31.686
UP TO NATURAL GAS, IT&apos;S HARDER  
TO BIGGENDEN THOSE LINES IN THE 
FUTURE AND SO IT JUST           

01:33:31.688 --> 01:33:37.792
TO BIGGENDEN THOSE LINES IN THE 
FUTURE AND SO IT JUST

OF IT YOU COULD DO AND THEN     
THERE ARE CHARACTER AREAS AND   
THOSE ARE BASED ON THE

THERE ARE CHARACTER AREAS AND   
THOSE ARE BASED ON THE

02:25:31.204 --> 02:25:31.803
THOSE ARE BASED ON THE          
CHARACTER AND THOSE BOUNDARIES  
ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE D ONE    

02:25:31.805 --> 02:25:34.872
CHARACTER AND THOSE BOUNDARIES  
ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE D ONE    
OF THE D YEAH THAT&apos;S MORE OF OF

ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE D ONE    
OF THE D YEAH THAT&apos;S MORE OF OF 
THE THE VISUAL AND THE PHYSICAL 

02:25:35.808 --> 02:25:38.642
OF THE D YEAH THAT&apos;S MORE OF OF 
THE THE VISUAL AND THE PHYSICAL 
CHARACTER AND THAT REGULATES    

02:25:38.644 --> 02:25:41.979
THE THE VISUAL AND THE PHYSICAL 
CHARACTER AND THAT REGULATES    
THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE OF THE

THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE OF THE

AND SO THE D ONE THE S          
UNIVERSITY CHARACTER AREA IN D  

02:25:50.424 --> 02:25:53.257
AND SO THE D ONE THE S

ONE THAT HEIGHT LIMIT IS ONE    
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET IT IS

ONE THAT HEIGHT LIMIT IS ONE    
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET IT IS    
LOWER THAN THE HEIGHT LIMIT     

02:25:57.130 --> 02:25:57.829
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET IT IS    
LOWER THAN THE HEIGHT LIMIT     
OF MAIN STREET BECAUSE THAT S   

02:25:57.831 --> 02:26:00.831
LOWER THAN THE HEIGHT LIMIT     
OF MAIN STREET BECAUSE THAT S   
UNIVERSITY CHARACTER WAS MUCH

02:28:23.143 --> 02:28:25.677
FOOT SETBACK SIDE AND YOU&apos;D END 
UP WITH A HEIGHT LIMIT THAT WAS 
NO LESS DENSITY AND THEN YOU    

02:28:25.679 --> 02:28:29.347
UP WITH A HEIGHT LIMIT THAT WAS 
NO LESS DENSITY AND THEN YOU    
WOULDN&apos;T ALSO BE GETTING THAT   

02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.814
NO LESS DENSITY AND THEN YOU    
WOULDN&apos;T ALSO BE GETTING THAT   
AFFORDABLE HOUSING

YOU WOULDN&apos;T BE GETTING THE     
THOSE TYPE OF BENEFITS.         
NOW I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE&apos;RE  

02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:39.924
THOSE TYPE OF BENEFITS.         
NOW I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE&apos;RE  
MOVING IN TO IS SOMETHING THAT  

02:28:39.926 --> 02:28:40.792
NOW I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE&apos;RE  
MOVING IN TO IS SOMETHING THAT  
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT A          

02:28:40.794 --> 02:28:44.295
MOVING IN TO IS SOMETHING THAT  
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT A          
DEVELOPER WOULD BE TRYING TO    

02:28:44.297 --> 02:28:44.896
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT A          
DEVELOPER WOULD BE TRYING TO    
GET AWAY WITH AVOIDING          

02:28:44.898 --> 02:28:45.697
DEVELOPER WOULD BE TRYING TO    
GET AWAY WITH AVOIDING          
SOMETHING IF THEY WANTED TO     

02:28:45.699 --> 02:28:48.033
GET AWAY WITH AVOIDING          
SOMETHING IF THEY WANTED TO     
EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT.        

02:28:48.035 --> 02:28:48.900
SOMETHING IF THEY WANTED TO     
EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT.        
BUT THEY WERE ALREADY DOING     

02:28:48.902 --> 02:28:49.634
EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT.        
BUT THEY WERE ALREADY DOING     
WHAT THE CODE ALLOWED YOU TO DO 

02:28:49.636 --> 02:28:51.369
BUT THEY WERE ALREADY DOING     
WHAT THE CODE ALLOWED YOU TO DO 
TO GET A LIMIT INCREASE.        

02:28:51.371 --> 02:28:52.737
WHAT THE CODE ALLOWED YOU TO DO 
TO GET A LIMIT INCREASE.        
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IN THIS KIND    

02:28:52.739 --> 02:28:55.340
TO GET A LIMIT INCREASE.        
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IN THIS KIND    
OF CLOSE TO COMMISSIONER, THOSE

SO FOR EXAMPLE, IN THIS KIND    
OF CLOSE TO COMMISSIONER, THOSE 
THOUGHT ABOUT CONVERTING TO ALL

OF CLOSE TO COMMISSIONER, THOSE 
THOUGHT ABOUT CONVERTING TO ALL 
THAT TROUBLE YEARS LATER WE     

02:29:00.146 --> 02:29:03.047
THOUGHT ABOUT CONVERTING TO ALL 
THAT TROUBLE YEARS LATER WE     
CURRENTLY HAVE A SECTION THAT   

02:29:03.049 --> 02:29:04.048
THAT TROUBLE YEARS LATER WE     
CURRENTLY HAVE A SECTION THAT   
SAYS YOU CAN GET A HEIGHT       

02:29:04.050 --> 02:29:04.716
CURRENTLY HAVE A SECTION THAT   
SAYS YOU CAN GET A HEIGHT       
INCREASE OVER THAT ONE HUNDRED  

02:29:04.718 --> 02:29:05.116
SAYS YOU CAN GET A HEIGHT       
INCREASE OVER THAT ONE HUNDRED

02:29:05.118 --> 02:29:06.117
INCREASE OVER THAT ONE HUNDRED

SURE.                           

02:29:06.119 --> 02:29:07.351
AND FIFTY.                      
SURE.                           
IF YOU PUT FELLOW CELLS ON THE  

02:29:07.353 --> 02:29:10.521
SURE.                           
IF YOU PUT FELLOW CELLS ON THE  
ROOF AND MAKE ELECTRIC READY.   

02:29:10.523 --> 02:29:10.855
IF YOU PUT FELLOW CELLS ON THE  
ROOF AND MAKE ELECTRIC READY.   
YEAH.                           

02:29:10.857 --> 02:29:14.559
ROOF AND MAKE ELECTRIC READY.   
YEAH.                           
SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ASKING    

02:29:14.561 --> 02:29:15.426
YEAH.                           
SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ASKING    
FOR HELP, WE&apos;RE NOT TRYING TO   

02:29:15.428 --> 02:29:16.027
SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ASKING    
FOR HELP, WE&apos;RE NOT TRYING TO   
DO WE&apos;RE NOT PUTTING SOLAR      

02:29:16.029 --> 02:29:16.561
FOR HELP, WE&apos;RE NOT TRYING TO   
DO WE&apos;RE NOT PUTTING SOLAR      
PANELS OF SURE.                 

02:29:16.563 --> 02:29:19.164
DO WE&apos;RE NOT PUTTING SOLAR      
PANELS OF SURE.                 
AND NOT READY FOR DOING BOTH    

02:29:19.166 --> 02:29:19.697
PANELS OF SURE.                 
AND NOT READY FOR DOING BOTH    
OF THOSE THINGS.                

02:29:19.699 --> 02:29:22.266
AND NOT READY FOR DOING BOTH    
OF THOSE THINGS.                
SO THAT&apos;S HOW THE READING       

02:29:22.268 --> 02:29:23.300
OF THOSE THINGS.                
SO THAT&apos;S HOW THE READING       
OF THE CODE IN ITS TOTALITY SIR 

02:29:23.302 --> 02:29:26.737
SO THAT&apos;S HOW THE READING       
OF THE CODE IN ITS TOTALITY SIR 
AND I GOTCHA I APPRECIATE THAT  

02:29:26.739 --> 02:29:30.141
OF THE CODE IN ITS TOTALITY SIR 
AND I GOTCHA I APPRECIATE THAT  
PERSPECTIVE.                    

02:29:30.143 --> 02:29:31.008
AND I GOTCHA I APPRECIATE THAT  
PERSPECTIVE.                    
I DO THINK THAT ALSO MAKES      

02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:33.511
PERSPECTIVE.                    
I DO THINK THAT ALSO MAKES      
SENSE I THINK BECAUSE WITH A 30 

02:29:33.513 --> 02:29:34.212
I DO THINK THAT ALSO MAKES      
SENSE I THINK BECAUSE WITH A 30 
PERCENT SUSTAINABILITY PREMIUM  

02:29:34.214 --> 02:29:37.281
SENSE I THINK BECAUSE WITH A 30 
PERCENT SUSTAINABILITY PREMIUM  
ON HEIGHT TAKES YET ANOTHER     

02:29:37.283 --> 02:29:38.016
PERCENT SUSTAINABILITY PREMIUM  
ON HEIGHT TAKES YET ANOTHER     
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT ACTUALLY    

02:29:38.018 --> 02:29:38.783
ON HEIGHT TAKES YET ANOTHER     
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT ACTUALLY    
WHICH MEANS LUNN&apos;S LEADS ME TO  

02:29:38.785 --> 02:29:41.485
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT ACTUALLY    
WHICH MEANS LUNN&apos;S LEADS ME TO  
AN EASIER QUESTION.             

02:29:41.487 --> 02:29:42.253
WHICH MEANS LUNN&apos;S LEADS ME TO  
AN EASIER QUESTION.             
I DID SEE THE GEOTHERMAL        

02:29:42.255 --> 02:29:42.653
AN EASIER QUESTION.             
I DID SEE THE GEOTHERMAL        
ELEMENT.                        

02:29:42.655 --> 02:29:45.322
I DID SEE THE GEOTHERMAL        
ELEMENT.                        
I&apos;M NOT SURE THAT I SAW         

02:29:45.324 --> 02:29:46.057
ELEMENT.                        
I&apos;M NOT SURE THAT I SAW         
ANYTHING IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL    

02:29:46.059 --> 02:29:49.360
I&apos;M NOT SURE THAT I SAW         
ANYTHING IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL    
REGULATIONS REGARDING WHERE ARE 

02:29:49.362 --> 02:29:50.227
ANYTHING IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL    
REGULATIONS REGARDING WHERE ARE 
YOU GUYS WITH RESPECT TO, YOU   

02:29:50.229 --> 02:29:52.297
REGULATIONS REGARDING WHERE ARE 
YOU GUYS WITH RESPECT TO, YOU   
KNOW, VERTICAL GEOTHERMAL       

02:29:52.299 --> 02:29:52.497
YOU GUYS WITH RESPECT TO, YOU   
KNOW, VERTICAL GEOTHERMAL       
WELLS?                          

02:29:52.499 --> 02:29:53.598
KNOW, VERTICAL GEOTHERMAL       
WELLS?                          
I IMAGINE IT&apos;S VERTICAL AND YOU 

02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:56.500
WELLS?                          
I IMAGINE IT&apos;S VERTICAL AND YOU 
DON&apos;T HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO.      

02:29:56.502 --> 02:29:57.002
I IMAGINE IT&apos;S VERTICAL AND YOU 
DON&apos;T HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO.      
HORIZONTAL WELLS YEAH.          

02:29:57.004 --> 02:29:57.802
DON&apos;T HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO.      
HORIZONTAL WELLS YEAH.          
THEY WOULD BE VERTICAL BORES    

02:29:57.804 --> 02:30:04.075
HORIZONTAL WELLS YEAH.          
THEY WOULD BE VERTICAL BORES    
THAT WOULD GO                   

02:30:17.556 --> 02:30:19.390
              BETWEEN THE       
FOUNDATION SYSTEM OF THE

SUSTAINABILITY CONSULTANT SPOKE 

02:30:20.093 --> 02:30:21.358
BUILDING AND AS OUR             
SUSTAINABILITY CONSULTANT SPOKE 
TO EARLIER, THAT LIMITS US TO   

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:22.093
SUSTAINABILITY CONSULTANT SPOKE 
TO EARLIER, THAT LIMITS US TO   
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS WE    

02:30:22.095 --> 02:30:22.827
TO EARLIER, THAT LIMITS US TO   
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS WE    
CAN ACCOMMODATE AT THE SITE.    

02:30:22.829 --> 02:30:23.728
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS WE    
CAN ACCOMMODATE AT THE SITE.    
SO THERE WOULD BE A NUMBER      

02:30:23.730 --> 02:30:24.395
CAN ACCOMMODATE AT THE SITE.    
SO THERE WOULD BE A NUMBER      
OF BOARDS TO GO DOWN.           

02:30:24.397 --> 02:30:25.063
SO THERE WOULD BE A NUMBER      
OF BOARDS TO GO DOWN.           
WE DON&apos;T KNOW THE FINAL NUMBER  

02:30:25.065 --> 02:30:25.930
OF BOARDS TO GO DOWN.           
WE DON&apos;T KNOW THE FINAL NUMBER  
YET BECAUSE WE HAVEN&apos;T DONE THE 

02:30:25.932 --> 02:30:26.598
WE DON&apos;T KNOW THE FINAL NUMBER  
YET BECAUSE WE HAVEN&apos;T DONE THE 
FINAL STRUCTURE BECAUSE WE

02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:27.932
FINAL STRUCTURE BECAUSE WE      
DON&apos;T HAVE PROJECT YET.         
YEAH, BUT IT COULD BE 60 BORES  

02:30:27.934 --> 02:30:28.666
DON&apos;T HAVE PROJECT YET.         
YEAH, BUT IT COULD BE 60 BORES  
OR 40 BORES BUT SOMEWHERE IN

02:30:29.202 --> 02:30:30.434
OR 40 BORES BUT SOMEWHERE IN    
THAT RANGE AND THEY ARE         
DEPENDENT ON THE TEST WELLS.    

02:30:30.436 --> 02:30:31.536
THAT RANGE AND THEY ARE         
DEPENDENT ON THE TEST WELLS.    
WE DIG FOR THE CONNECTIVITY     

02:30:31.538 --> 02:30:34.639
DEPENDENT ON THE TEST WELLS.    
WE DIG FOR THE CONNECTIVITY     
OF THE SOIL THAT WOULD BE       

02:30:34.641 --> 02:30:35.439
WE DIG FOR THE CONNECTIVITY     
OF THE SOIL THAT WOULD BE       
BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR    

02:30:35.441 --> 02:30:36.273
OF THE SOIL THAT WOULD BE       
BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR    
HUNDRED FEET DEEP TO GET THE    

02:30:36.275 --> 02:30:39.177
BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR    
HUNDRED FEET DEEP TO GET THE    
KIND OF EXCHANGE WE NEED TO GET 

02:30:39.179 --> 02:30:41.646
HUNDRED FEET DEEP TO GET THE    
KIND OF EXCHANGE WE NEED TO GET 
TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF GAS ON

02:33:22.942 --> 02:33:23.608
I&apos;M LEANING TOWARDS SAYING THAT 
THE IMPOSITION OF STANDARDS     
QUESTION HAS BEEN ACTUALLY      

02:33:23.610 --> 02:33:26.110
THE IMPOSITION OF STANDARDS     
QUESTION HAS BEEN ACTUALLY      
RESOLVED FOR ME AND THEN        

02:33:26.112 --> 02:33:26.778
QUESTION HAS BEEN ACTUALLY

THEN THAT&apos;S MY QUESTION.        
SO A COUPLE OF PIECES.          

02:40:52.158 --> 02:40:54.692
THEN THAT&apos;S MY QUESTION.        
SO A COUPLE OF PIECES.          
IT SAYS THE INCREASED DENSITY   

02:40:54.694 --> 02:40:55.358
SO A COUPLE OF PIECES.          
IT SAYS THE INCREASED DENSITY   
OF THE SITE ALLOWS THE          

02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:55.959
IT SAYS THE INCREASED DENSITY   
OF THE SITE ALLOWS THE          
DEVELOPER TO JUSTIFY THE

USING ANOTHER ZONING            
DESIGNATION WOULD MAKE MANY     

02:41:03.869 --> 02:41:04.535
USING ANOTHER ZONING            
DESIGNATION WOULD MAKE MANY     
OF THE SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES  

02:41:04.537 --> 02:41:06.670
DESIGNATION WOULD MAKE MANY     
OF THE SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES  
THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED RAPIDES   

02:41:06.672 --> 02:41:07.271
OF THE SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES  
THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED RAPIDES   
BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND

THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED RAPIDES   
BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND           
ENVIRONMENTALLY AND FEASIBLE.

BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND           
ENVIRONMENTALLY AND FEASIBLE.   
AND I&apos;M CURIOUS WHICH

ENVIRONMENTALLY AND FEASIBLE.   
AND I&apos;M CURIOUS WHICH

SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES         
INCREASE THE COST TO THE POINT  

02:41:12.178 --> 02:41:14.911
SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES         
INCREASE THE COST TO THE POINT  
THAT DO YOU WANT TO BECOMES     

02:41:14.913 --> 02:41:20.985
INCREASE THE COST TO THE POINT  
THAT DO YOU WANT TO BECOMES     
ECONOMICALLY INFEASIBLE         

02:41:25.524 --> 02:41:30.695
                        IF ONE  
OF MY OTHER TEAM MEMBERS LET&apos;S  
TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT IT I      

02:41:30.697 --> 02:41:33.497
OF MY OTHER TEAM MEMBERS LET&apos;S  
TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT IT I      
THINK WHAT WAS TRYING TO BE     

02:41:33.499 --> 02:41:34.331
TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT IT I      
THINK WHAT WAS TRYING TO BE     
CONVEYED IS THAT IS THE OVERALL 

02:41:34.333 --> 02:41:37.335
THINK WHAT WAS TRYING TO BE     
CONVEYED IS THAT IS THE OVERALL 
DENSITY OF THE PRODUCT AS       

02:41:37.337 --> 02:41:40.805
CONVEYED IS THAT IS THE OVERALL 
DENSITY OF THE PRODUCT AS       
PROPOSED THAT PERMITS THE       

02:41:40.807 --> 02:41:41.739
DENSITY OF THE PRODUCT AS       
PROPOSED THAT PERMITS THE       
BENEFITS IF YOU ARE FORCED INTO 

02:41:41.741 --> 02:41:45.176
PROPOSED THAT PERMITS THE       
BENEFITS IF YOU ARE FORCED INTO 
A D ONE TYPE OF ZONING YOU      

02:41:45.178 --> 02:41:45.910
BENEFITS IF YOU ARE FORCED INTO 
A D ONE TYPE OF ZONING YOU      
WOULD HAVE SUCH A HUGE          

02:41:45.912 --> 02:41:48.779
A D ONE TYPE OF ZONING YOU      
WOULD HAVE SUCH A HUGE          
REDUCTION IN UNIT COUNT YOU     

02:41:48.781 --> 02:41:49.714
WOULD HAVE SUCH A HUGE          
REDUCTION IN UNIT COUNT YOU     
WOULDN&apos;T BE ABLE TO DO ANY      

02:41:49.716 --> 02:41:50.814
REDUCTION IN UNIT COUNT YOU     
WOULDN&apos;T BE ABLE TO DO ANY      
OF THOSE THINGS MAYBE NOT EVEN  

02:41:50.816 --> 02:41:54.885
WOULDN&apos;T BE ABLE TO DO ANY      
OF THOSE THINGS MAYBE NOT EVEN  
SUSTAINABLE BELIEVE THAT IS     

02:41:54.887 --> 02:41:55.753
OF THOSE THINGS MAYBE NOT EVEN  
SUSTAINABLE BELIEVE THAT IS     
JUST A BLANKET STATEMENT LIKE I 

02:41:55.755 --> 02:41:56.354
SUSTAINABLE BELIEVE THAT IS     
JUST A BLANKET STATEMENT LIKE I 
THINK THERE ARE PLENTY          

02:41:56.356 --> 02:41:59.289
JUST A BLANKET STATEMENT LIKE I 
THINK THERE ARE PLENTY          
OF PROJECTS THAT YOU COULD      

02:41:59.291 --> 02:42:00.024
THINK THERE ARE PLENTY          
OF PROJECTS THAT YOU COULD      
BUILD TO THE SUSTAINABILITY     

02:42:00.026 --> 02:42:03.460
OF PROJECTS THAT YOU COULD      
BUILD TO THE SUSTAINABILITY     
STANDARD IN A DIFFERENT ZONING  

02:42:03.462 --> 02:42:03.794
BUILD TO THE SUSTAINABILITY     
STANDARD IN A DIFFERENT ZONING  
DISTRICT.                       

02:42:03.796 --> 02:42:07.030
STANDARD IN A DIFFERENT ZONING  
DISTRICT.                       
SO MY POINT IS THAT D ONE       

02:42:07.032 --> 02:42:10.600
DISTRICT.                       
SO MY POINT IS THAT D ONE       
DOESN&apos;T REQUIRE THAT I DON&apos;T I  

02:42:10.602 --> 02:42:15.706
SO MY POINT IS THAT D ONE       
DOESN&apos;T REQUIRE THAT I DON&apos;T I  
BUT I JUST TO ME I MEAN I THINK 

02:42:15.708 --> 02:42:18.608
DOESN&apos;T REQUIRE THAT I DON&apos;T I  
BUT I JUST TO ME I MEAN I THINK 
WE&apos;VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE  

02:42:18.610 --> 02:42:18.842
BUT I JUST TO ME I MEAN I THINK 
WE&apos;VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE  
.

I KNOW WE CAN&apos;T ENFORCE IT BUT  

02:42:19.945 --> 02:42:22.446
.                               
I KNOW WE CAN&apos;T ENFORCE IT BUT  
LIKE THAT DOESN&apos;T A BENEFIT TO  

02:42:22.448 --> 02:42:25.883
I KNOW WE CAN&apos;T ENFORCE IT BUT  
LIKE THAT DOESN&apos;T A BENEFIT TO  
ME ANYMORE AT THIS POINT WHEN   

02:42:25.885 --> 02:42:26.816
LIKE THAT DOESN&apos;T A BENEFIT TO  
ME ANYMORE AT THIS POINT WHEN   
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT WE NEED TO 

02:42:26.818 --> 02:42:30.053

EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT WE NEED TO 
GO ELECTRIC LIKE THAT CAN&apos;T BE  

02:42:30.055 --> 02:42:30.854
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT WE NEED TO 
GO ELECTRIC LIKE THAT CAN&apos;T BE  
A STANDARD THAT WE THINK IS     

02:42:30.856 --> 02:42:31.722
GO ELECTRIC LIKE THAT CAN&apos;T BE  
A STANDARD THAT WE THINK IS     
LIKE AS HIGH AS IT MAYBE ONCE   

02:42:31.724 --> 02:42:37.861
A STANDARD THAT WE THINK IS     
LIKE AS HIGH AS IT MAYBE ONCE   
WAS.                            

02:42:37.863 --> 02:42:38.394

IN THE PAST I BELIEVE THAT      
OFTEN WE WERE SAYING YOU&apos;RE

AN EXPECTATION AND SO OFTEN     
LIKE DOUBLE COUNTING VERY       
COMMONLY IN THE PAST WE&apos;VE      

03:10:17.621 --> 03:10:18.420
LIKE DOUBLE COUNTING VERY       
COMMONLY IN THE PAST WE&apos;VE      
TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS DOUBLE     

03:10:18.422 --> 03:10:18.887
COMMONLY IN THE PAST WE&apos;VE      
TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS DOUBLE     
COUNTING.                       

03:10:18.889 --> 03:10:22.424
TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS DOUBLE     
COUNTING.                       
SO THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO   

03:10:22.426 --> 03:10:23.358
COUNTING.                       
SO THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO   
COUNT THIS AS A BENEFIT IN THAT 

03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:26.227
SO THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO   
COUNT THIS AS A BENEFIT IN THAT 
TYPE OF THING OF OF STANDARDS.  

03:10:26.229 --> 03:10:28.897
COUNT THIS AS A BENEFIT IN THAT

BUT IN MY MIND THIS THEN        

03:10:28.899 --> 03:10:29.898

OF WHERE DO WE THINK THAT THAT  

03:21:01.598 --> 03:21:03.698

OF WHERE DO WE THINK THAT THAT  
LIMIT IS?                       

03:21:03.700 --> 03:21:04.832
OF WHERE DO WE THINK THAT THAT

WHERE IS THAT WHEN DO WE THINK  

03:21:04.834 --> 03:21:08.035

WHERE IS THAT WHEN DO WE THINK  
THE BENEFIT IS ENOUGH THAT IT   

03:21:08.037 --> 03:21:11.772
WHERE IS THAT WHEN DO WE THINK  
THE BENEFIT IS ENOUGH THAT IT   
GOES FARTHER THAN THEY DO ON    

03:21:11.774 --> 03:21:13.140
THE BENEFIT IS ENOUGH THAT IT   
GOES FARTHER THAN THEY DO ON    
OUR D TO AND SO I THINK THAT&apos;S  

03:21:13.142 --> 03:21:16.211
GOES FARTHER THAN THEY DO ON    
OUR D TO AND SO I THINK THAT&apos;S  
PART OF THIS IS JUST THAT THERE 

03:21:16.213 --> 03:21:20.014
OUR D TO AND SO I THINK THAT&apos;S  
PART OF THIS IS JUST THAT THERE 
IS MOST LIKELY A MONEY MONEY AT

EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THROWING  
MONEY AT IT IS GOOD BUT WE&apos;RE   

03:21:29.393 --> 03:21:32.060
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THROWING  
MONEY AT IT IS GOOD BUT WE&apos;RE   
LOOKING MONEY FOR AFFORDABLE    

03:21:32.062 --> 03:21:32.894
MONEY AT IT IS GOOD BUT WE&apos;RE   
LOOKING MONEY FOR AFFORDABLE    
HOUSING WHICH IS SOMETHING WE   

03:21:32.896 --> 03:21:33.360
LOOKING MONEY FOR AFFORDABLE    
HOUSING WHICH IS SOMETHING WE   
DESPERATELY NEED.               

03:21:33.362 --> 03:21:36.197
HOUSING WHICH IS SOMETHING WE   
DESPERATELY NEED.               
IN ADDITION TO MARKET RATE

IN ADDITION TO MARKET RATE      
HOUSING.
