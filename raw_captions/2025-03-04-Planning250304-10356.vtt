ALSO BELIEVE FROM WHAT I'VE     
LEARNED SO FAR THAT INCREASING

THE PRICES HAVE GONE UP SO, SO  
MUCH I WOULD SUPPORT THE        
REZONING ATTEMPT AND ALSO I     

00:29:18.583 --> 00:29:19.416
MUCH I WOULD SUPPORT THE        
REZONING ATTEMPT AND ALSO I     
SUPPORT THE FACT THAT IT'S CITY 

00:29:19.418 --> 00:29:19.616
REZONING ATTEMPT AND ALSO I     
SUPPORT THE FACT THAT IT'S CITY 
WIDE.                           

00:29:19.618 --> 00:29:22.886
SUPPORT THE FACT THAT IT'S CITY 
WIDE.                           
I THINK THAT ANY NEIGHBORHOOD   

00:29:22.888 --> 00:29:23.620
WIDE.                           
I THINK THAT ANY NEIGHBORHOOD   
WOULD COME UP WITH REASONS WHY  

00:29:23.622 --> 00:29:25.322
I THINK THAT ANY NEIGHBORHOOD   
WOULD COME UP WITH REASONS WHY  
THEY SHOULD NOT GET RID         

00:29:25.324 --> 00:29:26.123
WOULD COME UP WITH REASONS WHY  
THEY SHOULD NOT GET RID         
OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING IN      

00:29:26.125 --> 00:29:26.790
THEY SHOULD NOT GET RID         
OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING IN      
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND BY       

00:29:26.792 --> 00:29:29.492
OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING IN      
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND BY       
MAKING IT CITY WIDE THAT        

00:29:29.494 --> 00:29:30.193
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND BY       
MAKING IT CITY WIDE THAT        
SPREADS THE IMPACT OUT ACROSS   

00:29:30.195 --> 00:29:30.527
MAKING IT CITY WIDE THAT        
SPREADS THE IMPACT OUT ACROSS   
THE CITY.                       

00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:33.330
SPREADS THE IMPACT OUT ACROSS   
THE CITY.                       
IT DOESN'T JUST CONCENTRATE ON  

00:29:33.332 --> 00:29:34.030
THE CITY.                       
IT DOESN'T JUST CONCENTRATE ON  
ONE NEIGHBORHOOD ALSO I.        

00:29:34.032 --> 00:29:40.503
IT DOESN'T JUST CONCENTRATE ON  
ONE NEIGHBORHOOD ALSO I.        
I HONESTLY THINK THAT THE       

00:29:40.505 --> 00:29:41.238
ONE NEIGHBORHOOD ALSO I.        
I HONESTLY THINK THAT THE       
IMPACT OF IT IS PROBABLY        

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.039
I HONESTLY THINK THAT THE       
IMPACT OF IT IS PROBABLY        
ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE THAT   

00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:44.274
IMPACT OF IT IS PROBABLY        
ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE THAT   
GREAT UNLESS THERE'S ADDITIONAL 

00:29:44.276 --> 00:29:45.075
ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE THAT   
GREAT UNLESS THERE'S ADDITIONAL 
STEPS TAKEN BY THE CITY.        

00:29:45.077 --> 00:29:48.611
GREAT UNLESS THERE'S ADDITIONAL 
STEPS TAKEN BY THE CITY.        
SO THE OTHER THING I WOULD      

00:29:48.613 --> 00:29:49.445
STEPS TAKEN BY THE CITY.        
SO THE OTHER THING I WOULD      
REALLY URGE IS THAT IN ADDITION 

00:29:49.447 --> 00:29:52.816
SO THE OTHER THING I WOULD      
REALLY URGE IS THAT IN ADDITION 
TO REZONING Y'ALL MAY ALREADY   

00:29:52.818 --> 00:29:53.283
REALLY URGE IS THAT IN ADDITION 
TO REZONING Y'ALL MAY ALREADY   
BE DOING THIS.                  

00:29:53.285 --> 00:29:56.319
TO REZONING Y'ALL MAY ALREADY   
BE DOING THIS.                  
YOU'RE EXPERTS THAT YOU ALSO    

00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:57.120
BE DOING THIS.                  
YOU'RE EXPERTS THAT YOU ALSO    
PUT IN PLACE CHANGES THAT       

00:29:57.122 --> 00:30:00.324
YOU'RE EXPERTS THAT YOU ALSO    
PUT IN PLACE CHANGES THAT       
INCENTIVIZE CERTAIN TYPES       

00:30:00.326 --> 00:30:01.124
PUT IN PLACE CHANGES THAT       
INCENTIVIZE CERTAIN TYPES       
OF BUILDING AND MISSING MIDDLE  

00:30:01.126 --> 00:30:01.792
INCENTIVIZE CERTAIN TYPES       
OF BUILDING AND MISSING MIDDLE  
HOUSING GENERALLY SO THAT WE    

00:30:01.794 --> 00:30:03.793
OF BUILDING AND MISSING MIDDLE  
HOUSING GENERALLY SO THAT WE    
DON'T JUST GET THIS DONUT HOLE  

00:30:03.795 --> 00:30:04.494
HOUSING GENERALLY SO THAT WE    
DON'T JUST GET THIS DONUT HOLE  
WHERE WE HAVE SINGLE FAMILY     

00:30:04.496 --> 00:30:05.229
DON'T JUST GET THIS DONUT HOLE  
WHERE WE HAVE SINGLE FAMILY     
HOMES WHICH ARE THE CHEAPEST TO 

00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:07.530
WHERE WE HAVE SINGLE FAMILY     
HOMES WHICH ARE THE CHEAPEST TO 
BUILD PER SQUARE FOOT OF ANY    

00:30:07.532 --> 00:30:08.298
HOMES WHICH ARE THE CHEAPEST TO 
BUILD PER SQUARE FOOT OF ANY    
TYPE OF HOUSING RIGHT NOW AND   

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.368
BUILD PER SQUARE FOOT OF ANY    
TYPE OF HOUSING RIGHT NOW AND   
LARGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS.      

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.302
TYPE OF HOUSING RIGHT NOW AND   
LARGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS.      
I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY        

00:30:12.304 --> 00:30:15.339
LARGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS.      
I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY        
CRITICAL TO LOOK AT WHAT THE    

00:30:15.341 --> 00:30:16.206
I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY        
CRITICAL TO LOOK AT WHAT THE    
BUILDING CODE IS IS MAKING IT   

00:30:16.208 --> 00:30:19.343
CRITICAL TO LOOK AT WHAT THE    
BUILDING CODE IS IS MAKING IT   
SO THAT THAT IS THE CASE.       

00:30:19.345 --> 00:30:20.610
BUILDING CODE IS IS MAKING IT   
SO THAT THAT IS THE CASE.       
AND THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT 

00:30:20.612 --> 00:30:21.211
SO THAT THAT IS THE CASE.       
AND THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT 
HAVE ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT   

00:30:21.213 --> 00:30:22.545
AND THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT 
HAVE ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT   
BY ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE

00:41:48.766 --> 00:41:51.667
ZONED LOT.                      
SO THE FIRST THING WAS TO GO    
WITH THE TREES WHICH WERE       

00:41:51.669 --> 00:41:52.302
SO THE FIRST THING WAS TO GO    
WITH THE TREES WHICH WERE       
CONSIDERABLE SIX MATURE TREES   

00:41:52.304 --> 00:41:58.807
WITH THE TREES WHICH WERE       
CONSIDERABLE SIX MATURE TREES   
AND TWO HUGE MAPLES.            

00:41:58.809 --> 00:41:59.742
CONSIDERABLE SIX MATURE TREES   
AND TWO HUGE MAPLES.            
THEN AFTER THE TREES WENT THE   

00:41:59.744 --> 00:42:02.578
AND TWO HUGE MAPLES.            
THEN AFTER THE TREES WENT THE   
ENTIRE STRUCTURE WAS            

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.012
THEN AFTER THE TREES WENT THE   
ENTIRE STRUCTURE WAS            
DEMOLISHED.                     

00:42:03.014 --> 00:42:03.779
ENTIRE STRUCTURE WAS            
DEMOLISHED.                     
THE OLD HOUSE STONE FOUNDATIONS 

00:42:03.781 --> 00:42:07.082
DEMOLISHED.                     
THE OLD HOUSE STONE FOUNDATIONS 
ALL WENT TO THE LANDFILL.       

00:42:07.084 --> 00:42:10.252
THE OLD HOUSE STONE FOUNDATIONS 
ALL WENT TO THE LANDFILL.       
WE ASKED THE DEVELOPER IF HE    

00:42:10.254 --> 00:42:11.120
ALL WENT TO THE LANDFILL.       
WE ASKED THE DEVELOPER IF HE    
WAS GOING TO HAVE ANY OF IT     

00:42:11.122 --> 00:42:14.357
WE ASKED THE DEVELOPER IF HE    
WAS GOING TO HAVE ANY OF IT     
RECYCLED AND HE SAID NO HE DID  

00:42:14.359 --> 00:42:14.624
WAS GOING TO HAVE ANY OF IT     
RECYCLED AND HE SAID NO HE DID  
NOT.                            

00:42:14.626 --> 00:42:17.726
RECYCLED AND HE SAID NO HE DID  
NOT.                            
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BUYERS    

00:42:17.728 --> 00:42:18.661
NOT.                            
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BUYERS    
FOR THE RECYCLING SO IT WAS ALL 

00:42:18.663 --> 00:42:21.830
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BUYERS    
FOR THE RECYCLING SO IT WAS ALL 
GOING TO THE LANDFILL.          

00:42:21.832 --> 00:42:22.832
FOR THE RECYCLING SO IT WAS ALL 
GOING TO THE LANDFILL.          
SO MY QUESTION IS IS THIS       

00:42:22.834 --> 00:42:25.701
GOING TO THE LANDFILL.          
SO MY QUESTION IS IS THIS       
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT?        

00:42:25.703 --> 00:42:26.869
SO MY QUESTION IS IS THIS       
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT?        
DO WE TAKE INTO EQUATION WHAT   

00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:29.472
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT?        
DO WE TAKE INTO EQUATION WHAT   
GOES TO THE LANDFILL WHEN THESE 

00:42:29.474 --> 00:42:30.006
DO WE TAKE INTO EQUATION WHAT   
GOES TO THE LANDFILL WHEN THESE 
HOUSES ARE REPLACED?            

00:42:30.008 --> 00:42:33.643
GOES TO THE LANDFILL WHEN THESE 
HOUSES ARE REPLACED?            
SO NOW THE LOT IS FILLED WITH   

00:42:33.645 --> 00:42:34.510
HOUSES ARE REPLACED?            
SO NOW THE LOT IS FILLED WITH   
TOO LARGE HOUSES FOR UNITS WITH 

00:42:34.512 --> 00:42:37.112
SO NOW THE LOT IS FILLED WITH   
TOO LARGE HOUSES FOR UNITS WITH 
FOUR BEDROOMS EACH FIVE         

00:42:37.114 --> 00:42:37.780
TOO LARGE HOUSES FOR UNITS WITH 
FOUR BEDROOMS EACH FIVE         
BATHROOMS EACH RUNNING AT       

00:42:37.782 --> 00:42:41.283
FOUR BEDROOMS EACH FIVE         
BATHROOMS EACH RUNNING AT       
FIFTEEN HUNDRED A BEDROOM AND A 

00:42:41.285 --> 00:42:41.651
BATHROOMS EACH RUNNING AT       
FIFTEEN HUNDRED A BEDROOM AND A 
PARKING LOT.                    

00:42:41.653 --> 00:42:44.821
FIFTEEN HUNDRED A BEDROOM AND A 
PARKING LOT.                    
SO 80 PERCENT IMPERVIOUS        

00:42:44.823 --> 00:42:45.622
PARKING LOT.                    
SO 80 PERCENT IMPERVIOUS        
SURFACES AND NO TREES ANY       

00:42:45.624 --> 00:42:46.021
SO 80 PERCENT IMPERVIOUS        
SURFACES AND NO TREES ANY       
LONGER.                         

00:42:46.023 --> 00:42:49.025
SURFACES AND NO TREES ANY       
LONGER.                         
SO IS THIS AFFORDABLE?          

00:42:49.027 --> 00:42:50.159
LONGER.                         
SO IS THIS AFFORDABLE?          
IS IT IS IT SUSTAINABLE AND IS  

00:42:50.161 --> 00:42:53.529
SO IS THIS AFFORDABLE?          
IS IT IS IT SUSTAINABLE AND IS  
IT EQUITABLE SO THE TWEEK TO UP

DON'T HAVE TO CLIMB MULTIPLE    
FLOORS OF STAIRS.               
THE RENTALS IN THE OLD DECREPIT 

00:49:07.104 --> 00:49:07.970
FLOORS OF STAIRS.               
THE RENTALS IN THE OLD DECREPIT 
HOUSES ACROSS THE STREET FOR ME 

00:49:07.972 --> 00:49:08.637
THE RENTALS IN THE OLD DECREPIT 
HOUSES ACROSS THE STREET FOR ME 
RENT FOR THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

00:49:14.378 --> 00:49:15.044
BEDROOM.                        
SO THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION IS     
DESPERATELY NEEDED AND THERE'S  

00:49:15.046 --> 00:49:15.845
SO THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION IS     
DESPERATELY NEEDED AND THERE'S  
A REASON DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE TO 

00:49:15.847 --> 00:49:18.280
DESPERATELY NEEDED AND THERE'S  
A REASON DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE TO 
BUILD IT AND GET THOSE GET      

00:49:18.282 --> 00:49:18.747
A REASON DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE TO 
BUILD IT AND GET THOSE GET      
THOSE RENTS.

BUILD IT AND GET THOSE GET      
THOSE RENTS.                    
AND SO IF WE DENY THAT AND      

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.151
THOSE RENTS.                    
AND SO IF WE DENY THAT AND      
STUDENTS WILL PAY INCREASINGLY  

00:49:23.153 --> 00:49:23.819

OF THE OWNER OCCUPIED HOUSES    
HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY          

00:49:31.929 --> 00:49:34.730
OF THE OWNER OCCUPIED HOUSES    
HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY          
INVESTORS WHO RECOGNIZE THAT    

00:49:34.732 --> 00:49:35.530

CHAIN AND ARE CONVERTING THEM   
TO RENTALS.                     
AND I'VE DONE THE MATH SO LIKE  

00:49:39.904 --> 00:49:42.304
TO RENTALS.                     
AND I'VE DONE THE MATH SO LIKE  
WHAT IF A DEVELOPER MULTIPLE    

00:49:42.306 --> 00:49:43.105
AND I'VE DONE THE MATH SO LIKE  
WHAT IF A DEVELOPER MULTIPLE    
PROPERTIES WITH THE AIR FORCES  

00:49:43.107 --> 00:49:46.308
WHAT IF A DEVELOPER MULTIPLE

SOMETHING NICER AND IT DOESN'T  

00:49:47.245 --> 00:49:49.644
ZONING AND TRIED TO REDEVELOP   
SOMETHING NICER AND IT DOESN'T  
WORK?                           

00:49:49.646 --> 00:49:50.413
SOMETHING NICER AND IT DOESN'T  
WORK?                           
NONE OF THESE PROPERTIES        

00:49:50.415 --> 00:49:51.213
WORK?                           
NONE OF THESE PROPERTIES        
CONFORM AND SO THEY ALL HAVE    

00:49:51.215 --> 00:49:51.947
NONE OF THESE PROPERTIES        
CONFORM AND SO THEY ALL HAVE    
WAY MORE UNITS AND YOU COULD    

00:49:51.949 --> 00:49:53.949
CONFORM AND SO THEY ALL HAVE    
WAY MORE UNITS AND YOU COULD    
BUILD LEGALLY NOW IF WE TORE    

00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:54.616
WAY MORE UNITS AND YOU COULD    
BUILD LEGALLY NOW IF WE TORE    
THEM DOWN WE WOULD HAVE LESS    

00:49:54.618 --> 00:49:55.351
BUILD LEGALLY NOW IF WE TORE    
THEM DOWN WE WOULD HAVE LESS    
UNITS THAN WHAT WE COULD BUILD  

00:49:55.353 --> 00:49:55.618
THEM DOWN WE WOULD HAVE LESS    
UNITS THAN WHAT WE COULD BUILD  
NOW.                            

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.486
UNITS THAN WHAT WE COULD BUILD  
NOW.                            
SO WE NEED WE NEED NEW ZONING.  

00:49:57.488 --> 00:49:58.653
NOW.                            
SO WE NEED WE NEED NEW ZONING.  
WE NEED TO UPDATE IT AND I      

00:49:58.655 --> 00:49:59.321
SO WE NEED WE NEED NEW ZONING.  
WE NEED TO UPDATE IT AND I
