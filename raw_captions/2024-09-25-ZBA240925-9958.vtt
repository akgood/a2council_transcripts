BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT   
THAT HAS BEEN USED WHENEVER THE 
BUILDING HAS BEEN OCCUPIED.     

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:43.958
THAT HAS BEEN USED WHENEVER THE 
BUILDING HAS BEEN OCCUPIED.     
IT HAS HAD A SIGN ON THERE YOU  

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.626

THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN USED FOR   
SIGN WHENEVER THERE'S BEEN A    
TENANT OCCUPYING THE BUILDING   

00:13:50.266 --> 00:13:51.132
SIGN WHENEVER THERE'S BEEN A    
TENANT OCCUPYING THE BUILDING   
IT IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION      

00:13:51.134 --> 00:13:54.601
TENANT OCCUPYING THE BUILDING   
IT IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION      
BECAUSE THERE IS A STRUCTURE, A 

00:13:54.603 --> 00:13:58.172
IT IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION      
BECAUSE THERE IS A STRUCTURE, A 
LARGE SLAB OF CONCRETE THAT WAS 

00:13:58.174 --> 00:13:58.973
BECAUSE THERE IS A STRUCTURE, A 
LARGE SLAB OF CONCRETE THAT WAS 
CONSTRUCTED WITH THIS BUILDING  

00:13:58.975 --> 00:13:59.707
LARGE SLAB OF CONCRETE THAT WAS

BACK WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY     
DONE.

00:14:02.512 --> 00:14:05.313
DONE.                           
SO IT'S VERY UNUSUAL THAT MOST  
BUILDINGS DON'T HAVE THAT KIND

PURPOSE FOR IT SO THAT IT'S A   

00:14:14.824 --> 00:14:18.559
FOR SIGNS THERE'S NO OTHER      
PURPOSE FOR IT SO THAT IT'S A   
VERY UNUSUAL AND UNIQUE         

00:14:18.561 --> 00:14:21.329
PURPOSE FOR IT SO THAT IT'S A   
VERY UNUSUAL AND UNIQUE         
CIRCUMSTANCE CREATING THAT

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.039
WERE NOT IF THE VARIANCE WERE   
NOT GRANTED, THE PRACTICAL      
DIFFICULTY WOULD BE IS THAT     

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:33.908
NOT GRANTED, THE PRACTICAL      
DIFFICULTY WOULD BE IS THAT     
THAT WOULD REMAIN VACANT.       

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.175
DIFFICULTY WOULD BE IS THAT     
THAT WOULD REMAIN VACANT.       
THERE WAS A PICTURE OF IT AS

00:14:42.218 --> 00:14:45.285
UNATTRACTIVE BUT THE SIGNAGE    
THAT COULD BE CONSTRUCTED ON    
THAT WOULD BE IT ONLY A COUPLE  

00:14:45.287 --> 00:14:46.220
THAT COULD BE CONSTRUCTED ON    
THAT WOULD BE IT ONLY A COUPLE  
LIKE TWO OR THREE FEET ABOVE

SLIGHTLY SO IT'S MORE VISIBLE   

00:19:34.743 --> 00:19:36.810
THE STRUCTURE IS TIPPED         
SLIGHTLY SO IT'S MORE VISIBLE   
WHEN YOU'RE HEADING NORTH ON    

00:19:36.812 --> 00:19:40.448
SLIGHTLY SO IT'S MORE VISIBLE   
WHEN YOU'RE HEADING NORTH ON    
STADIUM MEANING THE SIGN IS ON  

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:40.981
WHEN YOU'RE HEADING NORTH ON    
STADIUM MEANING THE SIGN IS ON  
THE SOUTH SIDE.                 

00:19:40.983 --> 00:19:41.849
STADIUM MEANING THE SIGN IS ON  
THE SOUTH SIDE.

00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:44.785
THE SOUTH SIDE.                 
BUT I'M PRESUMING IT WOULD BE   
ON BOTH SIDES THIS OF FRICTION. 

00:19:44.787 --> 00:19:48.088
BUT I'M PRESUMING IT WOULD BE   
ON BOTH SIDES THIS OF FRICTION. 
SO I'VE ONLY BEEN TOLD IT'S     

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.123
ON BOTH SIDES THIS OF FRICTION. 
SO I'VE ONLY BEEN TOLD IT'S     
GOING TO BE ON ONE SIDE BECAUSE 

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:51.926
SO I'VE ONLY BEEN TOLD IT'S     
GOING TO BE ON ONE SIDE BECAUSE 
IF IT WAS ON TWO SIDES IT WOULD 

00:19:51.928 --> 00:19:55.329
GOING TO BE ON ONE SIDE BECAUSE 
IF IT WAS ON TWO SIDES IT WOULD 
BE OVER THE SQUARE FOOT         

00:19:55.331 --> 00:19:55.796
IF IT WAS ON TWO SIDES IT WOULD 
BE OVER THE SQUARE FOOT

YES, WELL THEY'RE THE GARAGE    

00:46:46.073 --> 00:46:47.072
CLOSER TO THE REAR PLOTLINE?    
YES, WELL THEY'RE THE GARAGE    
PER ZONING CAN BE THREE FEET.   

00:46:47.074 --> 00:46:47.873
YES, WELL THEY'RE THE GARAGE    
PER ZONING CAN BE THREE FEET.   
THAT'S A THAT'S A SETBACK.      

00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:49.675
PER ZONING CAN BE THREE FEET.   
THAT'S A THAT'S A SETBACK.      
THAT'S THE MINIMUM.

THAT'S A THAT'S A SETBACK.      
THAT'S THE MINIMUM.             
BUT WHAT IT IS IS WHEN YOU PUT  

00:46:50.811 --> 00:46:53.812
THAT'S THE MINIMUM.             
BUT WHAT IT IS IS WHEN YOU PUT  
IT THREE FEET ON THIS GARAGE    

00:46:53.814 --> 00:46:54.546
BUT WHAT IT IS IS WHEN YOU PUT  
IT THREE FEET ON THIS GARAGE    
THERE'S TOO MUCH AREA SO THAT   

00:46:54.548 --> 00:46:57.916
IT THREE FEET ON THIS GARAGE    
THERE'S TOO MUCH AREA SO THAT   
THE AREA THAT'S ALLOWED TO HAVE 

00:46:57.918 --> 00:46:58.651
THERE'S TOO MUCH AREA SO THAT   
THE AREA THAT'S ALLOWED TO HAVE 
IMPERVIOUSNESS TWO HUNDRED AND  

00:46:58.653 --> 00:47:01.920
THE AREA THAT'S ALLOWED TO HAVE 
IMPERVIOUSNESS TWO HUNDRED AND  
FIFTEEN SQUARE FEET AND ARE 216 

00:47:01.922 --> 00:47:02.587
IMPERVIOUSNESS TWO HUNDRED AND  
FIFTEEN SQUARE FEET AND ARE 216 
SQUARE FEET EXCUSE ME AND       

00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:05.891
FIFTEEN SQUARE FEET AND ARE 216 
SQUARE FEET EXCUSE ME AND       
THEY'RE ASKING TO HAVE 238 BACK 

00:47:05.893 --> 00:47:06.125
SQUARE FEET EXCUSE ME AND       
THEY'RE ASKING TO HAVE 238 BACK 
THERE.

THERE.                          
UNDERSTOOD.                     
BUT THE REASON THEY'RE HERE IS  

00:47:09.196 --> 00:47:12.264
UNDERSTOOD.                     
BUT THE REASON THEY'RE HERE IS  
IF THEY WERE TO KEEP THE GARAGE 

00:47:12.266 --> 00:47:13.298
BUT THE REASON THEY'RE HERE IS  
IF THEY WERE TO KEEP THE GARAGE 
FIVE FEET AWAY FROM THE REAR    

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.132
IF THEY WERE TO KEEP THE GARAGE 
FIVE FEET AWAY FROM THE REAR    
OUTLINE THEY WOULD NOT NEED A   

00:47:14.134 --> 00:47:16.969
FIVE FEET AWAY FROM THE REAR    
OUTLINE THEY WOULD NOT NEED A   
VERY YES THAT'S CORRECT.        

00:47:16.971 --> 00:47:17.570
OUTLINE THEY WOULD NOT NEED A   
VERY YES THAT'S CORRECT.        
OK ALL RIGHT.                   

00:47:17.572 --> 00:47:21.173
VERY YES THAT'S CORRECT.        
OK ALL RIGHT.                   
BUT THERE THEY'RE WANTING TO    

00:47:21.175 --> 00:47:21.841
OK ALL RIGHT.                   
BUT THERE THEY'RE WANTING TO    
KEEP IT WELL AT THE OUTCOMES.   

00:47:21.843 --> 00:47:22.375
BUT THERE THEY'RE WANTING TO    
KEEP IT WELL AT THE OUTCOMES.   
YEAH, OK.                       

00:47:22.377 --> 00:47:24.643
KEEP IT WELL AT THE OUTCOMES.   
YEAH, OK.                       
BECAUSE JUST WANT TO DERMOT     

00:47:24.645 --> 00:47:27.946
YEAH, OK.                       
BECAUSE JUST WANT TO DERMOT     
SORRY NONWORK CONDUCED SO ARE   

00:47:27.948 --> 00:47:28.714
BECAUSE JUST WANT TO DERMOT     
SORRY NONWORK CONDUCED SO ARE   
THERE TWO WAYS IN WHICH THEY'RE 

00:47:28.716 --> 00:47:29.448
SORRY NONWORK CONDUCED SO ARE   
THERE TWO WAYS IN WHICH THEY'RE 
SEEKING A VARIANCE OF VARIABLES 

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:32.318
THERE TWO WAYS IN WHICH THEY'RE 
SEEKING A VARIANCE OF VARIABLES 
FROM THE ALLOWED IN PERVIOUS    

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.821
SEEKING A VARIANCE OF VARIABLES 
FROM THE ALLOWED IN PERVIOUS    
AREA AND AN ALLOWANCE FROM THE  

00:47:35.823 --> 00:47:36.155
FROM THE ALLOWED IN PERVIOUS    
AREA AND AN ALLOWANCE FROM THE  
SET BACK?                       

00:47:36.157 --> 00:47:37.222
AREA AND AN ALLOWANCE FROM THE  
SET BACK?                       
NO, JUST THE SO WHY WOULD IT BE 

00:47:37.224 --> 00:47:40.126
SET BACK?                       
NO, JUST THE SO WHY WOULD IT BE 
OK IF IT WAS SET BACK FIVE FEET 

00:47:40.128 --> 00:47:40.926
NO, JUST THE SO WHY WOULD IT BE 
OK IF IT WAS SET BACK FIVE FEET 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SMALLER     

00:47:40.928 --> 00:47:43.128
OK IF IT WAS SET BACK FIVE FEET 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SMALLER     
THAT WOULD BE LESS IMPERVIOUS   

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.929
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SMALLER     
THAT WOULD BE LESS IMPERVIOUS   
SURFACE IN THAT THAT TWENTY     

00:47:43.931 --> 00:47:47.466
THAT WOULD BE LESS IMPERVIOUS   
SURFACE IN THAT THAT TWENTY     
FEET BECAUSE THEY COULD INSTEAD 

00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:48.200
SURFACE IN THAT THAT TWENTY     
FEET BECAUSE THEY COULD INSTEAD 
OF BEING THREE FEET FROM THE    

00:47:48.202 --> 00:47:50.635
FEET BECAUSE THEY COULD INSTEAD 
OF BEING THREE FEET FROM THE    
REAR LANCE FIVE FEET SO THERE'S 

00:47:50.637 --> 00:47:51.504
OF BEING THREE FEET FROM THE    
REAR LANCE FIVE FEET SO THERE'S 
THE GARAGE SHIFTED FORWARD MORE 

00:47:51.506 --> 00:47:53.305
REAR LANCE FIVE FEET SO THERE'S 
THE GARAGE SHIFTED FORWARD MORE 
OUTSIDE OF THE BACK TWENTY FEET 

00:47:53.307 --> 00:47:57.776
THE GARAGE SHIFTED FORWARD MORE 
OUTSIDE OF THE BACK TWENTY FEET 
OK AND WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE    

00:47:57.778 --> 00:48:00.679
OUTSIDE OF THE BACK TWENTY FEET 
OK AND WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE    
CURRENT ZONING SPECIFICATIONS

OK AND WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE    
CURRENT ZONING SPECIFICATIONS

IT WOULD BE TO HAVE LESS MACING 

00:48:16.431 --> 00:48:19.498
YEAH IT'S IN MY BEST ANALYSIS   
IT WOULD BE TO HAVE LESS MACING 
TO ABUTTIN PROPERTIES AND ALSO  

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.332
