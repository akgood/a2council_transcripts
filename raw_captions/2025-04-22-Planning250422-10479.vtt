00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:47.566
TO THE THE TYPE                 
OF DENSIFICATION THAT'S         
PLANNED.                        

00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:50.236
OF DENSIFICATION THAT'S         
PLANNED.                        
WE HAVE LOTS OF DENSIFICATION.  

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:54.440
PLANNED.                        
WE HAVE LOTS OF DENSIFICATION.  
I WALKED DOWN DEWEY YESTERDAY.  

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:55.375
WE HAVE LOTS OF DENSIFICATION.  
I WALKED DOWN DEWEY YESTERDAY.  
I JUST BEEN WALKING VARIOUS     

00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:56.108
I WALKED DOWN DEWEY YESTERDAY.  
I JUST BEEN WALKING VARIOUS     
STREETS TO SEE WHAT APARTMENTS  

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.611
I JUST BEEN WALKING VARIOUS     
STREETS TO SEE WHAT APARTMENTS  
LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY'RE          

00:03:58.613 --> 00:03:59.279
STREETS TO SEE WHAT APARTMENTS  
LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY'RE          
INTERMIXED WITH HOUSES AND      

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:02.381
LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY'RE          
INTERMIXED WITH HOUSES AND      
THERE'S LOTS OF THAT ON DEWEY.  

00:04:02.383 --> 00:04:03.149
INTERMIXED WITH HOUSES AND      
THERE'S LOTS OF THAT ON DEWEY.  
BUT IT HAPPENED GRADUALLY OVER  

00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:05.618
THERE'S LOTS OF THAT ON DEWEY.  
BUT IT HAPPENED GRADUALLY OVER  
TIME AND I WONDER HOW MUCH PENT 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.519
BUT IT HAPPENED GRADUALLY OVER  
TIME AND I WONDER HOW MUCH PENT 
UP DEMAND THERE IS IN SOME      

00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:10.189
TIME AND I WONDER HOW MUCH PENT 
UP DEMAND THERE IS IN SOME      
OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE    

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:10.923
UP DEMAND THERE IS IN SOME      
OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE    
THE WHERE THINGS COULD HAPPEN   

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:11.390
OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE    
THE WHERE THINGS COULD HAPPEN   
VERY RAPIDLY.                   

00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:14.059
THE WHERE THINGS COULD HAPPEN   
VERY RAPIDLY.                   
SO I WOULD ASK YOU PLEASE TO    

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:14.861

SO I WOULD ASK YOU PLEASE TO    
PHASE THIS GRADUALLY SO I DON'T 
HAVE TO WEAR WATER IN MY        

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:18.631
PHASE THIS GRADUALLY SO I DON'T 
HAVE TO WEAR WATER IN MY        
BASEMENT AGAIN THAT WE DON'T    

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.434
HAVE TO WEAR WATER IN MY        
BASEMENT AGAIN THAT WE DON'T    
HAVE STORM WATER PROBLEMS.      

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:22.368
BASEMENT AGAIN THAT WE DON'T    
HAVE STORM WATER PROBLEMS.      
WE'VE HAD ENDLESS STORMWATER    

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.702
HAVE STORM WATER PROBLEMS.      
WE'VE HAD ENDLESS STORMWATER    
PROBLEMS.                       

00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:26.038
WE'VE HAD ENDLESS STORMWATER    
PROBLEMS.                       
WE USED TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.773
PROBLEMS.                       
WE USED TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO 
LIVED IN VARIOUS HOUSES WHO     

00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:29.609
WE USED TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO 
LIVED IN VARIOUS HOUSES WHO     
TOOK CARE OF CLEARING OUT THEIR 

00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:30.343
LIVED IN VARIOUS HOUSES WHO     
TOOK CARE OF CLEARING OUT THEIR 
STORMWATER DRAINS EVERY TIME    

00:04:30.345 --> 00:04:31.077
TOOK CARE OF CLEARING OUT THEIR 
STORMWATER DRAINS EVERY TIME    
THERE WAS PREDICTED TO BE A BIG 

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.379
STORMWATER DRAINS EVERY TIME    
THERE WAS PREDICTED TO BE A BIG 
RAIN.                           

00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:34.547
THERE WAS PREDICTED TO BE A BIG 
RAIN.                           
WELL, THOSE ARE NO RENTAL UNITS 

00:04:34.549 --> 00:04:35.215
RAIN.                           
WELL, THOSE ARE NO RENTAL UNITS 
AND NO ONE'S COMING OUT THERE   

00:04:35.217 --> 00:04:37.316
WELL, THOSE ARE NO RENTAL UNITS 
AND NO ONE'S COMING OUT THERE   
TO CLEAN THAT OUT.              

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:38.384
AND NO ONE'S COMING OUT THERE   
TO CLEAN THAT OUT.              
I REALIZE THE CITY HAS LOTS     

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:39.185
TO CLEAN THAT OUT.              
I REALIZE THE CITY HAS LOTS     
OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT PROBABLY  

00:04:39.187 --> 00:04:40.519
I REALIZE THE CITY HAS LOTS     
OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT PROBABLY  
HAVE MORE PROBLEMS THAN OURS.   

00:04:40.521 --> 00:04:41.754
OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT PROBABLY  
HAVE MORE PROBLEMS THAN OURS.   
BUT WHO'S GOING TO BE DOING     

00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:45.058
HAVE MORE PROBLEMS THAN OURS.   
BUT WHO'S GOING TO BE DOING     
THAT IN THE FUTURE AND WHO'S    

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.858
BUT WHO'S GOING TO BE DOING     
THAT IN THE FUTURE AND WHO'S    
CLEANING OUT THOSE DRAINS AND   

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.962
THAT IN THE FUTURE AND WHO'S    
CLEANING OUT THOSE DRAINS AND   
MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE  

00:04:49.964 --> 00:04:50.497
CLEANING OUT THOSE DRAINS AND   
MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE  
WATER IN OUR BASEMENTS          

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.165
MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE  
WATER IN OUR BASEMENTS          
PARTICULARLY AS YOU COVER MORE  

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.032
WATER IN OUR BASEMENTS          
PARTICULARLY AS YOU COVER MORE  
OF THE LAND WITH NON-POROUS     

00:04:53.034 --> 00:04:53.366
PARTICULARLY AS YOU COVER MORE  
OF THE LAND WITH NON-POROUS     
SURFACES.                       

00:04:53.368 --> 00:04:56.602
OF THE LAND WITH NON-POROUS     
SURFACES.                       
SO I WOULD PLEASE ASK YOU TO

SURFACES.                       
SO I WOULD PLEASE ASK YOU TO    
CONSIDER THIS IN A VERY         

00:04:57.238 --> 00:04:57.904
SO I WOULD PLEASE ASK YOU TO    
CONSIDER THIS IN A VERY         
INCREMENTAL AND THOUGHTFUL WAY  

00:04:57.906 --> 00:05:00.739
CONSIDER THIS IN A VERY         
INCREMENTAL AND THOUGHTFUL WAY  
WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL DO.       

00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:01.440
INCREMENTAL AND THOUGHTFUL WAY  
WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL DO.

>> THANKS SO MUCH.              
THANK YOU.                      
IS RELIEF AND I WANT TO TALK    

00:05:12.053 --> 00:05:15.120
THANK YOU.                      
IS RELIEF AND I WANT TO TALK    
ABOUT JUST ONE SECTION IN       

00:05:15.122 --> 00:05:16.088
IS RELIEF AND I WANT TO TALK    
ABOUT JUST ONE SECTION IN       
CHAPTER FOUR WHICH IS I THINK   

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.357
ABOUT JUST ONE SECTION IN       
CHAPTER FOUR WHICH IS I THINK   
CALLED FLEXIBILITY AND LAND USE 

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:19.292
CHAPTER FOUR WHICH IS I THINK   
CALLED FLEXIBILITY AND LAND USE 
AND I THINK IT'D BE HELPFUL TO  

00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:20.093
CALLED FLEXIBILITY AND LAND USE 
AND I THINK IT'D BE HELPFUL TO  
DISTINGUISH TWO DIFFERENT KINDS 

00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:22.428
AND I THINK IT'D BE HELPFUL TO  
DISTINGUISH TWO DIFFERENT KINDS 
OF FLEXIBILITY.                 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.495
DISTINGUISH TWO DIFFERENT KINDS 
OF FLEXIBILITY.                 
ONE TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY COULD   

00:05:23.497 --> 00:05:26.399
OF FLEXIBILITY.                 
ONE TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY COULD   
BE FLEXIBILITY AND USE.         

00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:27.333
ONE TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY COULD   
BE FLEXIBILITY AND USE.         
YOU COULD ALLOW FOR EXAMPLE IN  

00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:30.302
BE FLEXIBILITY AND USE.         
YOU COULD ALLOW FOR EXAMPLE IN  
THE TRANSITION DISTRICT BOTH    

00:05:30.304 --> 00:05:30.937
YOU COULD ALLOW FOR EXAMPLE IN  
THE TRANSITION DISTRICT BOTH    
LIGHT INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL    

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:31.671
THE TRANSITION DISTRICT BOTH    
LIGHT INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL    
AND RESIDENTIAL TOGETHER.       

00:05:31.673 --> 00:05:33.606
LIGHT INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL    
AND RESIDENTIAL TOGETHER.       
AND I THINK THIS FLEXIBILITY IS 

00:05:33.608 --> 00:05:33.940
AND RESIDENTIAL TOGETHER.       
AND I THINK THIS FLEXIBILITY IS 
GREAT.                          

00:05:33.942 --> 00:05:37.343
AND I THINK THIS FLEXIBILITY IS 
GREAT.                          
IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO WALK FROM   

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:38.044
GREAT.                          
IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO WALK FROM   
THEIR HOMES TO NEARBY           

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:38.444
IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO WALK FROM   
THEIR HOMES TO NEARBY           
BUSINESSES.                     

00:05:38.446 --> 00:05:41.313
THEIR HOMES TO NEARBY           
BUSINESSES.                     
IT DOESN'T TRY TO ANTICIPATE    

00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:42.248
BUSINESSES.                     
IT DOESN'T TRY TO ANTICIPATE    
WHAT WILL BE THE DOMINANT LAND  

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.516
IT DOESN'T TRY TO ANTICIPATE    
WHAT WILL BE THE DOMINANT LAND  
USE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHICH AS 

00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:45.351
WHAT WILL BE THE DOMINANT LAND  
USE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHICH AS 
YOU KNOW CAN BE VERY HARD.      

00:05:45.353 --> 00:05:48.921
USE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHICH AS 
YOU KNOW CAN BE VERY HARD.      
SO I'M ALL FOR THAT AND I THINK 

00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:49.622
YOU KNOW CAN BE VERY HARD.      
SO I'M ALL FOR THAT AND I THINK 
IT'S GREAT THAT THAT'S IN THE   

00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:49.955
SO I'M ALL FOR THAT AND I THINK 
IT'S GREAT THAT THAT'S IN THE   
PLAN.                           

00:05:49.957 --> 00:05:55.829
IT'S GREAT THAT THAT'S IN THE   
PLAN.                           
THERE'S                         

00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:11.978
        ALSO A DIFFERENT TYPE   
OF FLEXIBILITY WHICH WOULD BE   
FLEXIBILITY IN USE IN STANDARD  

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.779
OF FLEXIBILITY WHICH WOULD BE   
FLEXIBILITY IN USE IN STANDARD  
AND THIS IS ONE THAT HASN'T     

00:06:12.781 --> 00:06:13.512
FLEXIBILITY IN USE IN STANDARD  
AND THIS IS ONE THAT HASN'T     
BEEN TALKED ABOUT VERY MUCH BUT 

00:06:13.514 --> 00:06:14.280
AND THIS IS ONE THAT HASN'T     
BEEN TALKED ABOUT VERY MUCH BUT 
IT IS REFERENCED IN THE PLANT I 

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:15.014
BEEN TALKED ABOUT VERY MUCH BUT 
IT IS REFERENCED IN THE PLANT I 
BELIEVE THAT SECTION SAYS THAT  

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:15.615
IT IS REFERENCED IN THE PLANT I 
BELIEVE THAT SECTION SAYS THAT  
IN THIS PROPOSED FLECK'S        

00:06:15.617 --> 00:06:16.282
BELIEVE THAT SECTION SAYS THAT  
IN THIS PROPOSED FLECK'S        
DISTRICT THERE WOULD BE         

00:06:16.284 --> 00:06:16.949
IN THIS PROPOSED FLECK'S        
DISTRICT THERE WOULD BE         
FLEXIBILITY PRIORITIZED TO      

00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:17.683
DISTRICT THERE WOULD BE         
FLEXIBILITY PRIORITIZED TO      
MINIMIZE COMPLAINTS WITHIN THIS 

00:06:17.685 --> 00:06:18.284
FLEXIBILITY PRIORITIZED TO      
MINIMIZE COMPLAINTS WITHIN THIS 
DISTRICT AND I BELIEVE THE      

00:06:18.286 --> 00:06:19.084
MINIMIZE COMPLAINTS WITHIN THIS 
DISTRICT AND I BELIEVE THE      
INTENTION OF THIS DISTRICT IS   

00:06:19.086 --> 00:06:19.686
DISTRICT AND I BELIEVE THE      
INTENTION OF THIS DISTRICT IS   
TO ATTRACT INDUSTRIAL           

00:06:19.688 --> 00:06:20.353
INTENTION OF THIS DISTRICT IS   
TO ATTRACT INDUSTRIAL           
EMPLOYMENT USES ALONG WITH      

00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:21.020
TO ATTRACT INDUSTRIAL           
EMPLOYMENT USES ALONG WITH      
CIRCULAR ECONOMY USES LIKE      

00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:23.890
EMPLOYMENT USES ALONG WITH      
CIRCULAR ECONOMY USES LIKE      
RECYCLING CENTERS AND STORAGE   

00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:24.857
CIRCULAR ECONOMY USES LIKE      
RECYCLING CENTERS AND STORAGE   
FOR THRIFT SHOPS AS WHAT IT     

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:28.127
RECYCLING CENTERS AND STORAGE   
FOR THRIFT SHOPS AS WHAT IT     
SAYS IN THE PLAN.               

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:29.262
FOR THRIFT SHOPS AS WHAT IT     
SAYS IN THE PLAN.               
>> SO I THINK SOME OF THESE     

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:29.929
SAYS IN THE PLAN.               
>> SO I THINK SOME OF THESE     
CIRCULAR ECONOMY USES COULD BE  

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.031
>> SO I THINK SOME OF THESE     
CIRCULAR ECONOMY USES COULD BE  
GREAT AND YOU CAN CONTAIN       

00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:32.732
CIRCULAR ECONOMY USES COULD BE  
GREAT AND YOU CAN CONTAIN       
RECYCLING CENTERS IN A          

00:06:32.734 --> 00:06:34.800
GREAT AND YOU CAN CONTAIN       
RECYCLING CENTERS IN A          
RESPONSIBLE WAY.                

00:06:34.802 --> 00:06:35.835
RECYCLING CENTERS IN A          
RESPONSIBLE WAY.                
BUT IF YOU GOOGLE RUBI          

00:06:35.837 --> 00:06:39.171
RESPONSIBLE WAY.                
BUT IF YOU GOOGLE RUBI          
RECYCLING SOME OF THESE OTHER   

00:06:39.173 --> 00:06:39.839
BUT IF YOU GOOGLE RUBI          
RECYCLING SOME OF THESE OTHER   
RECYCLING CENTERS IN WAYNE      

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:43.109
RECYCLING SOME OF THESE OTHER   
RECYCLING CENTERS IN WAYNE      
COUNTY THAT OFTEN COULD ALSO BE 

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:46.346
RECYCLING CENTERS IN WAYNE      
COUNTY THAT OFTEN COULD ALSO BE 
CALLED SCRAP METAL PLACES THEY  

00:06:46.348 --> 00:06:47.546
COUNTY THAT OFTEN COULD ALSO BE 
CALLED SCRAP METAL PLACES THEY  
ARE OFTEN VERY NOXIOUS AND HAVE 

00:06:47.548 --> 00:06:49.749
CALLED SCRAP METAL PLACES THEY  
ARE OFTEN VERY NOXIOUS AND HAVE 
ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS.            

00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:51.050
ARE OFTEN VERY NOXIOUS AND HAVE 
ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS.            
SO I THINK THAT TO SAY THAT     

00:06:51.052 --> 00:06:54.120
ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS.            
SO I THINK THAT TO SAY THAT     
SOUTH INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH PARK  

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:54.787
SO I THINK THAT TO SAY THAT     
SOUTH INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH PARK  
IN THESE AREAS NEED TO ATTRACT  

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.790
SOUTH INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH PARK  
IN THESE AREAS NEED TO ATTRACT  
MORE INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT AND  

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:58.658
IN THESE AREAS NEED TO ATTRACT  
MORE INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT AND  
WE SHOULD CONSIDER LOOSENING    

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.727
MORE INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT AND  
WE SHOULD CONSIDER LOOSENING    
OUR NUISANCE STANDARDS TO       

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:02.462
WE SHOULD CONSIDER LOOSENING    
OUR NUISANCE STANDARDS TO       
ATTRACT THAT EMPLOYMENT IS NOT  

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:05.698
OUR NUISANCE STANDARDS TO       
ATTRACT THAT EMPLOYMENT IS NOT  
NECESSARY OR WISE.              

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.501
ATTRACT THAT EMPLOYMENT IS NOT  
NECESSARY OR WISE.              
SO I SUGGEST FOCUSING ON THIS   

00:07:09.503 --> 00:07:10.369

THAT MEANS IN PRACTICE I THINK  
IS DROPPING THIS IDEA OF THE    

00:07:18.412 --> 00:07:20.546
THAT MEANS IN PRACTICE I THINK  
IS DROPPING THIS IDEA OF THE    
FLECK'S DISTRICT AND INSTEAD    

00:07:20.548 --> 00:07:21.480
IS DROPPING THIS IDEA OF THE    
FLECK'S DISTRICT AND INSTEAD    
IT'S ONLY THOSE AREAS IN        

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:24.950
FLECK'S DISTRICT AND INSTEAD    
IT'S ONLY THOSE AREAS IN        
TRANSITION AND I KNOW THIS BODY

IT'S ONLY THOSE AREAS IN        
TRANSITION AND I KNOW THIS BODY 
ALREADY REJECTED A VERY SIMILAR

ALREADY REJECTED A VERY SIMILAR 
EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT BUT IT'D BE 

00:07:26.454 --> 00:07:32.591
ALREADY REJECTED A VERY SIMILAR 
EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT BUT IT'D BE 
NICE REJECTED AGAIN AND BECAUSE 

00:07:32.593 --> 00:07:33.526
EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT BUT IT'D BE 
NICE REJECTED AGAIN AND BECAUSE 
I THINK IT DOES ALLOW HOUSING   

00:07:33.528 --> 00:07:36.963
NICE REJECTED AGAIN AND BECAUSE 
I THINK IT DOES ALLOW HOUSING   
IN THEORY IN PRACTICE THE PLAN

I THINK IT DOES ALLOW HOUSING   
IN THEORY IN PRACTICE THE PLAN  
CALLS FOR A SEPARATE DISTRICT   

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:38.431
IN THEORY IN PRACTICE THE PLAN  
CALLS FOR A SEPARATE DISTRICT   
AND THE RATIONALE FOR THE       

00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:40.299
CALLS FOR A SEPARATE DISTRICT   
AND THE RATIONALE FOR THE       
DISTRICT IS THAT HOUSING WILL   

00:07:40.301 --> 00:07:41.034
AND THE RATIONALE FOR THE

BE RESTRICTED IN IT AND I THINK 

00:07:41.036 --> 00:07:44.070
DISTRICT IS THAT HOUSING WILL   
BE RESTRICTED IN IT AND I THINK 
THAT'S A BIG MISSED OPPORTUNITY 

00:07:44.072 --> 00:07:44.937
BE RESTRICTED IN IT AND I THINK 
THAT'S A BIG MISSED OPPORTUNITY 
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE AREAS     

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:48.274
THAT'S A BIG MISSED OPPORTUNITY 
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE AREAS     
WHERE DEVELOPERS ARE LIKELY TO

BECAUSE THESE ARE THE AREAS     
WHERE DEVELOPERS ARE LIKELY TO  
GO WITH A LOT OF HOUSING AND IT 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.808
WHERE DEVELOPERS ARE LIKELY TO  
GO WITH A LOT OF HOUSING AND IT 
MIGHT BE MUCH LESS              

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.244
GO WITH A LOT OF HOUSING AND IT 
MIGHT BE MUCH LESS

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.188
IDEA OF BRINGING MORE PEOPLE    
INTO THE POOR DOESN'T SOLVE THE 
BASIC PROBLEM OF RENTS THAT ARE

BASIC PROBLEM OF RENTS THAT ARE 
TOO HIGH FOR STORES ARE USED TO

BASIC PROBLEM OF RENTS THAT ARE 
TOO HIGH FOR STORES ARE USED TO

00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:21.634
TOO HIGH FOR STORES ARE USED TO

DISAPPEARED AND I THINK THAT    
THE INTEGRITY OF THE DOWNTOWN

THE INTEGRITY OF THE DOWNTOWN   
NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON.          

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:38.183
THE INTEGRITY OF THE DOWNTOWN   
NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON.          
THERE ARE TOO MANY EMPTY        

00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:41.253
NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON.          
THERE ARE TOO MANY EMPTY        
STOREFRONTS RIGHT NOW AND THE   

00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:41.721
THERE ARE TOO MANY EMPTY        
STOREFRONTS RIGHT NOW AND THE   
QUESTION IS WHY?                

00:14:41.723 --> 00:14:45.056
STOREFRONTS RIGHT NOW AND THE   
QUESTION IS WHY?                
AND WE'RE WE TALK ABOUT         

00:14:45.058 --> 00:14:45.725
QUESTION IS WHY?                
AND WE'RE WE TALK ABOUT         
BUILDING UP AND NOW NO GROUND   

00:14:45.727 --> 00:14:48.961

BUILDING UP AND NOW NO GROUND   
FLOOR WILL BE MORE STOREFRONTS. 

00:14:48.963 --> 00:14:49.829
BUILDING UP AND NOW NO GROUND   
FLOOR WILL BE MORE STOREFRONTS. 
WE CAN'T FILL THE STOREFRONTS   

00:14:49.831 --> 00:14:53.031
FLOOR WILL BE MORE STOREFRONTS. 
WE CAN'T FILL THE STOREFRONTS   
THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE THE      

00:14:53.033 --> 00:14:53.565
WE CAN'T FILL THE STOREFRONTS   
THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE THE      
RENTS ARE TOO HIGH.             

00:14:53.567 --> 00:14:57.669
THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE THE      
RENTS ARE TOO HIGH.             
SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT      

00:14:57.671 --> 00:15:01.140

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.694
PUTTING FOUR STOREY BUILDINGS   
NEXT TO TWO STOREY HOMES IS A   
DISASTER FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:08.824
WITH THE RELATIONSHIP MAYBE     
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED   
TO DO THAT COULD BE SOMETHING   

01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:11.828
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED   
TO DO THAT COULD BE SOMETHING   
THAT WE DO IS JUST AS A         

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:12.361
TO DO THAT COULD BE SOMETHING   
THAT WE DO IS JUST AS A         
STARTING POINT.                 

01:03:12.363 --> 01:03:13.162
THAT WE DO IS JUST AS A         
STARTING POINT.                 
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THESE TERMS 

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:16.032
STARTING POINT.                 
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THESE TERMS 
THROUGHOUT THIS CHAPTER.        

01:03:16.034 --> 01:03:17.099
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THESE TERMS 
THROUGHOUT THIS CHAPTER.        
THIS IS HOW THEY INTERRELATE.   

01:03:17.101 --> 01:03:18.101
THROUGHOUT THIS CHAPTER.        
THIS IS HOW THEY INTERRELATE.   
I THINK THAT IS A LOT OF THEM   

01:03:18.103 --> 01:03:20.102
THIS IS HOW THEY INTERRELATE.   
I THINK THAT IS A LOT OF THEM   
START GOING LIKE THE KEY        

01:03:20.104 --> 01:03:20.703
I THINK THAT IS A LOT OF THEM   
START GOING LIKE THE KEY        
CONSIDERATION SOUND LIKE        

01:03:20.705 --> 01:03:23.472
START GOING LIKE THE KEY        
CONSIDERATION SOUND LIKE        
THEY'RE MORE DATA DRIVEN RIGHT  

01:03:23.474 --> 01:03:23.739
CONSIDERATION SOUND LIKE        
THEY'RE MORE DATA DRIVEN RIGHT  
NOW.                            

01:03:23.741 --> 01:03:26.742
THEY'RE MORE DATA DRIVEN RIGHT  
NOW.                            
>> I DIDN'T I MEAN OBVIOUSLY    

01:03:26.744 --> 01:03:27.944
NOW.                            
>> I DIDN'T I MEAN OBVIOUSLY    
LIKE READ THAT BUT I WAS I JUST 

01:03:27.946 --> 01:03:31.281
>> I DIDN'T I MEAN OBVIOUSLY    
LIKE READ THAT BUT I WAS I JUST 
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT IN MY HEAD  

01:03:31.283 --> 01:03:32.148
LIKE READ THAT BUT I WAS I JUST 
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT IN MY HEAD  
LIKE HOW THEY WERE RELATING AND 

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.749
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT IN MY HEAD  
LIKE HOW THEY WERE RELATING AND 
THE OBJECTIVES COMING FIRST     

01:03:32.751 --> 01:03:35.451
LIKE HOW THEY WERE RELATING AND 
THE OBJECTIVES COMING FIRST     
BEFORE JUST LIKE I FEEL LIKE    

01:03:35.453 --> 01:03:38.921
THE OBJECTIVES COMING FIRST     
BEFORE JUST LIKE I FEEL LIKE    
THE DATA SHOULD SUPPORT         

01:03:38.923 --> 01:03:39.655
BEFORE JUST LIKE I FEEL LIKE    
THE DATA SHOULD SUPPORT         
OBJECTIVES WHICH THEN DEVELOP   

01:03:39.657 --> 01:03:40.055
THE DATA SHOULD SUPPORT         
OBJECTIVES WHICH THEN DEVELOP   
THE GOALS.                      

01:03:40.057 --> 01:03:42.692
OBJECTIVES WHICH THEN DEVELOP   
THE GOALS.                      
SO MAYBE IT WAS LIKE THE ORDER  

01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:43.559
THE GOALS.                      
SO MAYBE IT WAS LIKE THE ORDER  
THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME.        

01:03:43.561 --> 01:03:46.328
SO MAYBE IT WAS LIKE THE ORDER  
THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME.        
>> I THINK A LIKE A GRAPHIC     

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:47.096
THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME.        
>> I THINK A LIKE A GRAPHIC     
DESIGN PROBLEM OR A SOLUTION TO 

01:03:47.098 --> 01:03:50.032
>> I THINK A LIKE A GRAPHIC

01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:50.866
DESIGN PROBLEM OR A SOLUTION TO 
THIS PROBLEM.                   
SO SOME COMBINATION TO WHAT     

01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:51.600
THIS PROBLEM.                   
SO SOME COMBINATION TO WHAT     
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS   

01:03:51.602 --> 01:03:54.169
SO SOME COMBINATION TO WHAT     
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS   
LIKE THE SAMPLE SPREAD BUT THEN 

01:03:54.171 --> 01:03:54.937
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS   
LIKE THE SAMPLE SPREAD BUT THEN 
THAT STUFF HAS TO EXIST IN THE

JUST SAYS I MIGHT NOT COME IN   
AND HAVE BREAKING INTO MORE     
MORE CHAPTERS BUT EVEN          

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:22.532
AND HAVE BREAKING INTO MORE     
MORE CHAPTERS BUT EVEN          
SOMETHING THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW,  

01:04:22.534 --> 01:04:25.201
MORE CHAPTERS BUT EVEN          
SOMETHING THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW,  
THERE ARE THREE SECTIONS AND    

01:04:25.203 --> 01:04:25.935
SOMETHING THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW,  
THERE ARE THREE SECTIONS AND    
FOR EACH SECTION THESE ELEMENTS 

01:04:25.937 --> 01:04:26.869
THERE ARE THREE SECTIONS AND    
FOR EACH SECTION THESE ELEMENTS 
AND THIS IS HOW I FINISH UP THE 

01:04:26.871 --> 01:04:29.171
FOR EACH SECTION THESE ELEMENTS 
AND THIS IS HOW I FINISH UP THE 
EXACT EVERY TIME.               

01:04:29.173 --> 01:04:30.272
AND THIS IS HOW I FINISH UP THE 
EXACT EVERY TIME.               
BUT FOR ME I DON'T I'M          

01:04:30.274 --> 01:04:33.309
EXACT EVERY TIME.               
BUT FOR ME I DON'T I'M          
WONDERING WHAT THE DIFFERENCE   

01:04:33.311 --> 01:04:34.043
BUT FOR ME I DON'T I'M          
WONDERING WHAT THE DIFFERENCE   
BETWEEN A GOAL AND AN OBJECTIVE 

01:04:34.045 --> 01:04:34.911
WONDERING WHAT THE DIFFERENCE   
BETWEEN A GOAL AND AN OBJECTIVE 
WHICH FEELS LIKE THE SAME THING 

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.846
BETWEEN A GOAL AND AN OBJECTIVE 
WHICH FEELS LIKE THE SAME THING 
TO ME AND RIGHT NOW THE         

01:04:36.848 --> 01:04:39.715
WHICH FEELS LIKE THE SAME THING 
TO ME AND RIGHT NOW THE         
OBJECTIVES ARE A LITTLE MORE    

01:04:39.717 --> 01:04:40.249
TO ME AND RIGHT NOW THE         
OBJECTIVES ARE A LITTLE MORE    
GRANULARITY THERE.              

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:41.283
OBJECTIVES ARE A LITTLE MORE    
GRANULARITY THERE.              
BUT MAYBE THERE'S ALSO A LOT    

01:04:41.285 --> 01:04:43.752
GRANULARITY THERE.              
BUT MAYBE THERE'S ALSO A LOT    
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE          

01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:44.153
BUT MAYBE THERE'S ALSO A LOT    
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE          
REGULARITY.                     

01:04:44.155 --> 01:04:44.887
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE          
REGULARITY.                     
SO MAYBE THEY COULD BE          

01:04:44.889 --> 01:04:47.790
REGULARITY.                     
SO MAYBE THEY COULD BE          
GENERALIZED BUT AND THEN FOLDED 

01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:48.758
SO MAYBE THEY COULD BE          
GENERALIZED BUT AND THEN FOLDED 
INTO THE GOALS SO LIKE REDUCE   

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.860
GENERALIZED BUT AND THEN FOLDED 
INTO THE GOALS SO LIKE REDUCE   
REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED 

01:04:51.862 --> 01:04:56.131
INTO THE GOALS SO LIKE REDUCE   
REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED 
WOULD FIT THEIR GOAL FOR SO I   

01:04:56.133 --> 01:04:56.933
REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED 
WOULD FIT THEIR GOAL FOR SO I   
THINK THAT'S ALSO CONFUSING TO  

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:57.600
WOULD FIT THEIR GOAL FOR SO I   
THINK THAT'S ALSO CONFUSING TO  
HAVE GOALS AND THEN OBJECTIVES  

01:04:57.602 --> 01:05:01.871
THINK THAT'S ALSO CONFUSING TO  
HAVE GOALS AND THEN OBJECTIVES  
AND UNDERSTAND HOW THEY BETTER  

01:05:01.873 --> 01:05:02.071
HAVE GOALS AND THEN OBJECTIVES  
AND UNDERSTAND HOW THEY BETTER  
.                               

01:05:02.073 --> 01:05:03.306
AND UNDERSTAND HOW THEY BETTER  
.                               
YEAH, AND I HAD A LOT OF JUST   

01:05:03.308 --> 01:05:06.042
.                               
YEAH, AND I HAD A LOT OF JUST   
THE LAST ONES ON BOTH OF THOSE  

01:05:06.044 --> 01:05:07.310
YEAH, AND I HAD A LOT OF JUST   
THE LAST ONES ON BOTH OF THOSE  
BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF THE SAME 

01:05:07.312 --> 01:05:08.044
THE LAST ONES ON BOTH OF THOSE  
BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF THE SAME 
LIKE WHAT ARE WE GOING WITH MY  

01:05:08.046 --> 01:05:09.645
BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF THE SAME 
LIKE WHAT ARE WE GOING WITH MY  
ONE POINT ONE POINT TWO THREE   

01:05:09.647 --> 01:05:10.479
LIKE WHAT ARE WE GOING WITH MY  
ONE POINT ONE POINT TWO THREE   
POINT FOUR LIKE IT WAS KIND     

01:05:10.481 --> 01:05:13.616
ONE POINT ONE POINT TWO THREE   
POINT FOUR LIKE IT WAS KIND     
OF I FELT LIKE I WAS A LITTLE   

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:14.350
POINT FOUR LIKE IT WAS KIND     
OF I FELT LIKE I WAS A LITTLE   
BIT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE      

01:05:14.352 --> 01:05:17.252
OF I FELT LIKE I WAS A LITTLE   
BIT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE      
RELATIONSHIP.                   

01:05:17.254 --> 01:05:20.823
BIT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE      
RELATIONSHIP.                   
OK, SO WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IS   

01:05:20.825 --> 01:05:22.057
RELATIONSHIP.                   
OK, SO WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IS   
WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEARER HOW  

01:05:22.059 --> 01:05:25.261
OK, SO WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IS   
WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEARER HOW  
EACH SECTION WITHIN EACH        

01:05:25.263 --> 01:05:25.994
WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEARER HOW  
EACH SECTION WITHIN EACH        
SECTION, THESE DIFFERENT AREAS  

01:05:25.996 --> 01:05:28.330
EACH SECTION WITHIN EACH        
SECTION, THESE DIFFERENT AREAS  
RELATE TO EACH OTHER FOR        

01:05:28.332 --> 01:05:29.131
SECTION, THESE DIFFERENT AREAS  
RELATE TO EACH OTHER FOR        
EXAMPLE OBJECTIVES WHAT WE'VE   

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:32.267
RELATE TO EACH OTHER FOR        
EXAMPLE OBJECTIVES WHAT WE'VE   
HEARD THE KEY CONSIDERATION INS 

01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:33.168
EXAMPLE OBJECTIVES WHAT WE'VE   
HEARD THE KEY CONSIDERATION INS 
AND MORE BROADLY HEARING THAT   

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:36.639
HEARD THE KEY CONSIDERATION INS 
AND MORE BROADLY HEARING THAT   
THE OBJECTIVES OUT IS CONFUSING 

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:40.108
AND MORE BROADLY HEARING THAT   
THE OBJECTIVES OUT IS CONFUSING 
AND THAT THOSE SHOULD BE MAYBE  

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:43.979
THE OBJECTIVES OUT IS CONFUSING 
AND THAT THOSE SHOULD BE MAYBE  
INTEGRATED INTO THE STRATEGIES  

01:05:43.981 --> 01:05:45.013
AND THAT THOSE SHOULD BE MAYBE  
INTEGRATED INTO THE STRATEGIES  
WHERE THEY FIT UNDER THE GOAL   

01:05:45.015 --> 01:05:48.984
INTEGRATED INTO THE STRATEGIES  
WHERE THEY FIT UNDER THE GOAL   
THAT WOULD BE CLEARER.          

01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:56.258
WHERE THEY FIT UNDER THE GOAL   
THAT WOULD BE CLEARER.          
OK, SO SO LET'S LOOK A PAGE     

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.092
THAT WOULD BE CLEARER.          
OK, SO SO LET'S LOOK A PAGE     
FORTY SIX WHAT WE HAVE OPEN     

01:05:57.094 --> 01:05:58.360
OK, SO SO LET'S LOOK A PAGE     
FORTY SIX WHAT WE HAVE OPEN     
THERE ON A CALLOUT BOX ON THE   

01:05:58.362 --> 01:06:03.131
FORTY SIX WHAT WE HAVE OPEN     
THERE ON A CALLOUT BOX ON THE   
LEFT I THINK THAT'S A FAIR UM   

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:06.335
THERE ON A CALLOUT BOX ON THE   
LEFT I THINK THAT'S A FAIR UM   
REORGANIZATIONS.                

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:09.939
LEFT I THINK THAT'S A FAIR UM   
REORGANIZATIONS.                
WE AGREE TO THAT WE CAN DO THAT 

01:06:09.941 --> 01:06:10.273
REORGANIZATIONS.                
WE AGREE TO THAT WE CAN DO THAT 
.                               

01:06:10.275 --> 01:06:11.273
WE AGREE TO THAT WE CAN DO THAT 
.                               
IT WOULD ALSO BE CLEAR THERE'S  

01:06:11.275 --> 01:06:14.410
.                               
IT WOULD ALSO BE CLEAR THERE'S  
A LITTLE TARGET IN THE          

01:06:14.412 --> 01:06:15.110
IT WOULD ALSO BE CLEAR THERE'S  
A LITTLE TARGET IN THE          
OBJECTIVES BOX AND WE'RE        

01:06:15.112 --> 01:06:18.747
A LITTLE TARGET IN THE          
OBJECTIVES BOX AND WE'RE        
HEARING A LOT OF CONCERN WHEN   

01:06:18.749 --> 01:06:19.348
OBJECTIVES BOX AND WE'RE        
HEARING A LOT OF CONCERN WHEN   
PEOPLE THINK THAT WE'RE

OF POPULATION WHEN IN FACT I    
THINK IT'S MORE THE WAY MR.     
LEINERT JUST PUT IT.            

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.163
THINK IT'S MORE THE WAY MR.     
LEINERT JUST PUT IT.            
THESE ARE PROJECTIONS BUT       

01:06:34.165 --> 01:06:34.830
LEINERT JUST PUT IT.            
THESE ARE PROJECTIONS BUT       
THEY'RE CONDITIONED AS YOU      

01:06:34.832 --> 01:06:36.832
THESE ARE PROJECTIONS BUT       
THEY'RE CONDITIONED AS YOU      
SAID, MATT BENNETT, ON WHAT     

01:06:36.834 --> 01:06:37.433
THEY'RE CONDITIONED AS YOU      
SAID, MATT BENNETT, ON WHAT     
PEOPLE WILL TOLERATE AND        

01:06:37.435 --> 01:06:38.167
SAID, MATT BENNETT, ON WHAT     
PEOPLE WILL TOLERATE AND        
THEY'RE CONDITIONED ON WHAT     

01:06:38.169 --> 01:06:40.436
PEOPLE WILL TOLERATE AND        
THEY'RE CONDITIONED ON WHAT     
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SUPPORT.     

01:06:40.438 --> 01:06:41.436
THEY'RE CONDITIONED ON WHAT     
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SUPPORT.     
AND SO WHEN IT'S STATED LIKE    

01:06:41.438 --> 01:06:44.373
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SUPPORT.     
AND SO WHEN IT'S STATED LIKE    
THIS IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE       

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.074
AND SO WHEN IT'S STATED LIKE    
THIS IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE       
MARCHING IN THESE DIRECTIONS    

01:06:45.076 --> 01:06:48.877
THIS IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE       
MARCHING IN THESE DIRECTIONS    
WHEN IN FACT WE HAVE NO IDEA    

01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:49.612
MARCHING IN THESE DIRECTIONS    
WHEN IN FACT WE HAVE NO IDEA    
YET WHAT'S EVEN REASONABLE IN   

01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:52.648
WHEN IN FACT WE HAVE NO IDEA    
YET WHAT'S EVEN REASONABLE IN   
TERMS OF SANITARY SEWER         

01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:56.452
YET WHAT'S EVEN REASONABLE IN   
TERMS OF SANITARY SEWER         
CAPACITY, LET ALONE WHAT IS     

01:06:56.454 --> 01:06:56.919
TERMS OF SANITARY SEWER         
CAPACITY, LET ALONE WHAT IS     
TOLERABLE.                      

01:06:56.921 --> 01:06:57.186
CAPACITY, LET ALONE WHAT IS     
TOLERABLE.                      
YES.                            

01:06:57.188 --> 01:07:00.088
TOLERABLE.                      
YES.                            
SO I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE CLEAR 

01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:00.789
YES.                            
SO I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE CLEAR 
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE   

01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:04.226
SO I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE CLEAR 
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE   
NOT WE DON'T HAVE HARD AND FAST 

01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:04.961
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE   
NOT WE DON'T HAVE HARD AND FAST 
NUMBERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET 

01:07:04.963 --> 01:07:08.030
NOT WE DON'T HAVE HARD AND FAST 
NUMBERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET 
TO NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES      

01:07:08.032 --> 01:07:08.830
NUMBERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET 
TO NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES      
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THAT'S    

01:07:08.832 --> 01:07:11.967
TO NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES      
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THAT'S    
JUST NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING AND  

01:07:11.969 --> 01:07:12.968
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THAT'S    
JUST NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING AND  
THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH THIS IT  

01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:16.004
JUST NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING AND  
THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH THIS IT  
MAY BE A COMBINATION OF THE     

01:07:16.006 --> 01:07:16.672
THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH THIS IT  
MAY BE A COMBINATION OF THE     
PRESENTATION AND ALSO JUST THE  

01:07:16.674 --> 01:07:17.472
MAY BE A COMBINATION OF THE     
PRESENTATION AND ALSO JUST THE  
WORDING LIKE IS IT A TARGET?    

01:07:17.474 --> 01:07:20.042
PRESENTATION AND ALSO JUST THE  
WORDING LIKE IS IT A TARGET?    
IS AN OBJECTIVE IS IT A         

01:07:20.044 --> 01:07:20.476
WORDING LIKE IS IT A TARGET?    
IS AN OBJECTIVE IS IT A         
PROJECTION?                     

01:07:20.478 --> 01:07:21.109
IS AN OBJECTIVE IS IT A         
PROJECTION?                     
>> THOSE ARE ALL REALLY         

01:07:21.111 --> 01:07:22.744
PROJECTION?                     
>> THOSE ARE ALL REALLY         
DIFFERENT THINGS.               

01:07:22.746 --> 01:07:23.746
>> THOSE ARE ALL REALLY         
DIFFERENT THINGS.               
>> SO OK, I APPRECIATE THAT     

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:24.079
DIFFERENT THINGS.               
>> SO OK, I APPRECIATE THAT     
POINT.                          

01:07:24.081 --> 01:07:26.749
>> SO OK, I APPRECIATE THAT     
POINT.                          
I THINK IT TOUCHES ON THIS      

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:27.549
POINT.                          
I THINK IT TOUCHES ON THIS      
REOCCURRING THEME OF HOW VAGUE  

01:07:27.551 --> 01:07:30.686
I THINK IT TOUCHES ON THIS      
REOCCURRING THEME OF HOW VAGUE  
AND HOW SPECIFIC WE WANT TO BE. 

01:07:30.688 --> 01:07:31.787
REOCCURRING THEME OF HOW VAGUE  
AND HOW SPECIFIC WE WANT TO BE. 
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IN HERE      

01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:32.388
AND HOW SPECIFIC WE WANT TO BE. 
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IN HERE      
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS     

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:34.756
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IN HERE      
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS     
OF WHAT THAT MEANS.             

01:07:34.758 --> 01:07:35.691
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS     
OF WHAT THAT MEANS.             
SO IN SOME INSTANCES WE SAY     

01:07:35.693 --> 01:07:38.226
OF WHAT THAT MEANS.             
SO IN SOME INSTANCES WE SAY     
THERE'S COMMENTS HERE THAT'S    

01:07:38.228 --> 01:07:39.394
SO IN SOME INSTANCES WE SAY     
THERE'S COMMENTS HERE THAT'S    
WAY TOO VAGUE AND NOW WE HAVE   

01:07:39.396 --> 01:07:42.565
THERE'S COMMENTS HERE THAT'S    
WAY TOO VAGUE AND NOW WE HAVE   
SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND FEELS LIKE 

01:07:42.567 --> 01:07:43.432
WAY TOO VAGUE AND NOW WE HAVE   
SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND FEELS LIKE 
MARCHING ORDERS AS A COMMISSION 

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:46.569
SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND FEELS LIKE 
MARCHING ORDERS AS A COMMISSION 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE   

01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:50.372
MARCHING ORDERS AS A COMMISSION 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE   
OUT LIKE WHAT WHAT LEVEL OF OF  

01:07:50.374 --> 01:07:51.307
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE   
OUT LIKE WHAT WHAT LEVEL OF OF  
THE PUBLIC IS ASKED OF US.      

01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:53.476
OUT LIKE WHAT WHAT LEVEL OF OF  
THE PUBLIC IS ASKED OF US.      
WHAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY DO WE 

01:07:53.478 --> 01:07:53.809
THE PUBLIC IS ASKED OF US.      
WHAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY DO WE 
WANT?                           

01:07:53.811 --> 01:07:54.877
WHAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY DO WE 
WANT?                           
AND I WOULD SAY AND I'LL LET    

01:07:54.879 --> 01:07:57.746
WANT?                           
AND I WOULD SAY AND I'LL LET    
BRETT SPEAK TO THAT NUMBER      

01:07:57.748 --> 01:07:58.414
AND I WOULD SAY AND I'LL LET    
BRETT SPEAK TO THAT NUMBER      
SPECIFICALLY BUT NOW THAT THERE 

01:07:58.416 --> 01:08:04.720
BRETT SPEAK TO THAT NUMBER      
SPECIFICALLY BUT NOW THAT THERE 
IS SOMEONE ON                   

01:08:18.368 --> 01:08:21.304
              STAFF WHO CAN     
HELP IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AND     
ANNUALLY REVIEW IT SOME SORT    

01:08:21.306 --> 01:08:22.204
HELP IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AND     
ANNUALLY REVIEW IT SOME SORT    
OF METRICS ARE GOING TO BE      

01:08:22.206 --> 01:08:22.938
ANNUALLY REVIEW IT SOME SORT    
OF METRICS ARE GOING TO BE      
NECESSARY FOR US TO FOLLOW      

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:23.739
OF METRICS ARE GOING TO BE      
NECESSARY FOR US TO FOLLOW      
RIGHT TO TO SEE OUR PROGRESS.   

01:08:23.741 --> 01:08:24.540
NECESSARY FOR US TO FOLLOW      
RIGHT TO TO SEE OUR PROGRESS.   
AND SO THAT IS EASIER WHEN YOU  

01:08:24.542 --> 01:08:25.141
RIGHT TO TO SEE OUR PROGRESS.   
AND SO THAT IS EASIER WHEN YOU  
HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT IT    

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:25.875
AND SO THAT IS EASIER WHEN YOU  
HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT IT    
ALSO DOES HOLD US MAYBE         

01:08:25.877 --> 01:08:26.475
HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT IT    
ALSO DOES HOLD US MAYBE         
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE      

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:27.009
ALSO DOES HOLD US MAYBE         
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE      
CONTEXTUALIZED WITH             

01:08:27.011 --> 01:08:27.809
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE      
CONTEXTUALIZED WITH             
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THINGS LIKE  

01:08:27.811 --> 01:08:29.612
CONTEXTUALIZED WITH             
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THINGS LIKE  
THAT.                           

01:08:29.614 --> 01:08:30.612
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THINGS LIKE  
THAT.                           
SO THIS IS A BROADER            

01:08:30.614 --> 01:08:32.448
THAT.                           
SO THIS IS A BROADER            
CONVERSATION, ONE WHERE I THINK 

01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:33.449
SO THIS IS A BROADER            
CONVERSATION, ONE WHERE I THINK 
ONE THING WE'RE GOING TO NEED   

01:08:33.451 --> 01:08:34.249
CONVERSATION, ONE WHERE I THINK 
ONE THING WE'RE GOING TO NEED   
CONSENSUS ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD 

01:08:34.251 --> 01:08:36.719
ONE THING WE'RE GOING TO NEED   
CONSENSUS ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD 
IS LIKE WHAT'S TOO VAGUE AND    

01:08:36.721 --> 01:08:37.519
CONSENSUS ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD 
IS LIKE WHAT'S TOO VAGUE AND    
WHAT'S TOO SPECIFIC AND THAT'S  

01:08:37.521 --> 01:08:38.187
IS LIKE WHAT'S TOO VAGUE AND    
WHAT'S TOO SPECIFIC AND THAT'S  
GOING TO DEPEND PROBABLY ON     

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:41.123
WHAT'S TOO SPECIFIC AND THAT'S  
GOING TO DEPEND PROBABLY ON     
WHAT THE ACTUAL THING IS THAT   

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:41.590
GOING TO DEPEND PROBABLY ON     
WHAT THE ACTUAL THING IS THAT   
WE'RE LOOKING AT.               

01:08:41.592 --> 01:08:45.127
WHAT THE ACTUAL THING IS THAT   
WE'RE LOOKING AT.               
I WONDER IF THE ECONOMIC        

01:08:45.129 --> 01:08:48.530
WE'RE LOOKING AT.               
I WONDER IF THE ECONOMIC        
DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT CAN HELP   

01:08:48.532 --> 01:08:49.798
I WONDER IF THE ECONOMIC        
DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT CAN HELP   
US HERE IF IT HAS ANY OF THOSE  

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:52.034
DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT CAN HELP   
US HERE IF IT HAS ANY OF THOSE  
TARGETS BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING  

01:08:52.036 --> 01:08:52.768
US HERE IF IT HAS ANY OF THOSE  
TARGETS BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING  
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED.    

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:53.369
TARGETS BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING  
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED.    
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY   

01:08:53.371 --> 01:08:56.438
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED.    
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY   
DRIVING POLICY AND SO THAT WAY  

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.841
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY   
DRIVING POLICY AND SO THAT WAY  
WE CAN JUST STAY IN THAT LOW.   

01:08:59.843 --> 01:09:00.309
DRIVING POLICY AND SO THAT WAY  
WE CAN JUST STAY IN THAT LOW.   
>> YES.                         

01:09:00.311 --> 01:09:01.243
WE CAN JUST STAY IN THAT LOW.   
>> YES.                         
AND I THINK COMMISSIONER ADAMS  

01:09:01.245 --> 01:09:03.845
>> YES.                         
AND I THINK COMMISSIONER ADAMS  
BROUGHT THAT REPORT LAST TIME   

01:09:03.847 --> 01:09:04.713
AND I THINK COMMISSIONER ADAMS  
BROUGHT THAT REPORT LAST TIME   
SO AND I HAVE STARTED LOOKING   

01:09:04.715 --> 01:09:05.747
BROUGHT THAT REPORT LAST TIME   
SO AND I HAVE STARTED LOOKING   
AT THAT AND I'LL MAKE A NOTE    

01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:06.715
SO AND I HAVE STARTED LOOKING   
AT THAT AND I'LL MAKE A NOTE    
OF THAT.                        

01:09:06.717 --> 01:09:10.652
AT THAT AND I'LL MAKE A NOTE    
OF THAT.                        
I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY I MEAN WE 

01:09:10.654 --> 01:09:11.620
OF THAT.                        
I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY I MEAN WE 
ARE PLANNING IN THE CONTEXT     

01:09:11.622 --> 01:09:15.323
I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY I MEAN WE 
ARE PLANNING IN THE CONTEXT     
OF A REGION AND A STATE THAT    

01:09:15.325 --> 01:09:18.427
ARE PLANNING IN THE CONTEXT     
OF A REGION AND A STATE THAT    
SPECIFICALLY HAS TARGETS FOR    

01:09:18.429 --> 01:09:19.361
OF A REGION AND A STATE THAT    
SPECIFICALLY HAS TARGETS FOR    
HOUSING AND SO UNDERSTANDING    

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:22.531
SPECIFICALLY HAS TARGETS FOR    
HOUSING AND SO UNDERSTANDING    
THAT I THINK SPECIFICITY IS IN  

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:23.298
HOUSING AND SO UNDERSTANDING    
THAT I THINK SPECIFICITY IS IN  
THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IS     

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.469
THAT I THINK SPECIFICITY IS IN  
THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IS     
FINE AND ACTUALLY IT'S GOING TO 

01:09:26.471 --> 01:09:27.336
THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IS     
FINE AND ACTUALLY IT'S GOING TO 
ALLOW US TO MEASURE I LIKE THE  

01:09:27.338 --> 01:09:30.539
FINE AND ACTUALLY IT'S GOING TO 
ALLOW US TO MEASURE I LIKE THE  
IDEA THAT THERE'S A RANGE       

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:31.707
ALLOW US TO MEASURE I LIKE THE  
IDEA THAT THERE'S A RANGE       
GIVING THE IDEA THAT IT IS NOT  

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:35.111
IDEA THAT THERE'S A RANGE       
GIVING THE IDEA THAT IT IS NOT  
A SPECIFIC NUMBER BUT WE'RE     

01:09:35.113 --> 01:09:35.711
GIVING THE IDEA THAT IT IS NOT  
A SPECIFIC NUMBER BUT WE'RE     
GOING FOR SOMETHING.            

01:09:35.713 --> 01:09:38.346
A SPECIFIC NUMBER BUT WE'RE     
GOING FOR SOMETHING.            
I JUST THINK THE QUESTION THAT  

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:39.048
GOING FOR SOMETHING.            
I JUST THINK THE QUESTION THAT  
I HAD WAS WHERE DOES THIS       

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.514
I JUST THINK THE QUESTION THAT  
I HAD WAS WHERE DOES THIS       
NUMBER COME FROM?               

01:09:39.516 --> 01:09:42.651
I HAD WAS WHERE DOES THIS       
NUMBER COME FROM?               
AND SO JUST THE SPECIFICITY YOU 

01:09:42.653 --> 01:09:43.618
NUMBER COME FROM?               
AND SO JUST THE SPECIFICITY YOU 
HAD ABOUT THIS IS DOUBLING OR   

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.888
AND SO JUST THE SPECIFICITY YOU 
HAD ABOUT THIS IS DOUBLING OR   
THIS IS HOW IT LINKS TO WHAT    

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.089
HAD ABOUT THIS IS DOUBLING OR   
THIS IS HOW IT LINKS TO WHAT    
THE REGION LIKE LATER ON WE     

01:09:47.091 --> 01:09:50.626
THIS IS HOW IT LINKS TO WHAT    
THE REGION LIKE LATER ON WE     
HAVE INFORMATION IN A DIFFERENT 

01:09:50.628 --> 01:09:51.160
THE REGION LIKE LATER ON WE     
HAVE INFORMATION IN A DIFFERENT 
PART WHICH IS WE'RE             

01:09:51.162 --> 01:09:54.029
HAVE INFORMATION IN A DIFFERENT 
PART WHICH IS WE'RE             
CONSOLIDATING SOME OF STUCK     

01:09:54.031 --> 01:09:58.300
PART WHICH IS WE'RE             
CONSOLIDATING SOME OF STUCK     
TOGETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW IT   

01:09:58.302 --> 01:09:59.001
CONSOLIDATING SOME OF STUCK     
TOGETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW IT

THE ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN LONG IN 
PROCESS.                        

01:11:12.577 --> 01:11:15.578
THE ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN LONG IN 
PROCESS.                        
IT'S BEEN MULTIFACETED AND IT'S 

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:19.214

AND SO I THINK IT'S BEEN        

01:11:20.418 --> 01:11:23.018
.                               
AND SO I THINK IT'S BEEN        
SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY BECAUSE 

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:23.619
AND SO I THINK IT'S BEEN        
SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY BECAUSE

THAT'S KIND OF MORE THAN THAT.  
YEAH WELL LET'S SAY THAT AGAIN  
IT WAS JUST KIND OF A BUSY      

01:14:14.292 --> 01:14:15.290
YEAH WELL LET'S SAY THAT AGAIN  
IT WAS JUST KIND OF A BUSY      
RIGHT AND A LOT OF THINGS WERE  

01:14:15.292 --> 01:14:16.157
IT WAS JUST KIND OF A BUSY      
RIGHT AND A LOT OF THINGS WERE  
DELIVERED AND THEN WE GOT A NEW 

01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:18.760
RIGHT AND A LOT OF THINGS WERE  
DELIVERED AND THEN WE GOT A NEW 
DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL AND        

01:14:18.762 --> 01:14:19.461
DELIVERED AND THEN WE GOT A NEW 
DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL AND        
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO USE THAT    

01:14:19.463 --> 01:14:22.398
DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL AND        
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO USE THAT    
KIND OF IN THE NEGATIVE OR THE  

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.198
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO USE THAT    
KIND OF IN THE NEGATIVE OR THE  
POSITIVE IF WE HAVE.            

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.132
KIND OF IN THE NEGATIVE OR THE  
POSITIVE IF WE HAVE.            
SO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW  

01:14:24.134 --> 01:14:26.601
POSITIVE IF WE HAVE.            
SO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW  
THIS BECOMES OPERATIONALIZED    

01:14:26.603 --> 01:14:27.202
SO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW  
THIS BECOMES OPERATIONALIZED    
ONCE IT'S PUBLISHED.            

01:14:27.204 --> 01:14:31.172
THIS BECOMES OPERATIONALIZED    
ONCE IT'S PUBLISHED.            
SO YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'LL GET TO 

01:14:31.174 --> 01:14:31.840
ONCE IT'S PUBLISHED.            
SO YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'LL GET TO 
THIS A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT     

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:34.776
SO YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'LL GET TO 
THIS A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT     
LIKE THIS FIRST POINT WHAT WE   

01:14:34.778 --> 01:14:35.444
THIS A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT     
LIKE THIS FIRST POINT WHAT WE   
SHOULD KIND OF FOCUS ON I'D     

01:14:35.446 --> 01:14:38.413
LIKE THIS FIRST POINT WHAT WE   
SHOULD KIND OF FOCUS ON I'D     
LIKE TO GET A LITTLE BIT THE    

01:14:38.415 --> 01:14:39.281
SHOULD KIND OF FOCUS ON I'D     
LIKE TO GET A LITTLE BIT THE    
ONLY THING THAT I HAVE IS I     

01:14:39.283 --> 01:14:39.949
LIKE TO GET A LITTLE BIT THE    
ONLY THING THAT I HAVE IS I     
WANT CONSISTENCY AND WHETHER    

01:14:39.951 --> 01:14:42.284
ONLY THING THAT I HAVE IS I     
WANT CONSISTENCY AND WHETHER    
IT'S UNITS OR BEDS, JUST THE    

01:14:42.286 --> 01:14:45.421

IT'S UNITS OR BEDS, JUST THE    
CONCEPT OF HOMES IS A LITTLE    

01:14:45.423 --> 01:14:45.888
IT'S UNITS OR BEDS, JUST THE    
CONCEPT OF HOMES IS A LITTLE    
DIFFICULT.                      

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:46.688
CONCEPT OF HOMES IS A LITTLE    
DIFFICULT.                      
>> SO THAT'S MY FEEDBACK.       

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:49.124
DIFFICULT.                      
>> SO THAT'S MY FEEDBACK.       
BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO BETTER     

01:14:49.126 --> 01:14:49.925
>> SO THAT'S MY FEEDBACK.       
BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO BETTER     
UNDERSTAND FROM OTHER FOLKS     

01:14:49.927 --> 01:14:53.261
BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO BETTER     
UNDERSTAND FROM OTHER FOLKS     
WHERE THEY STAND ON THE         

01:14:53.263 --> 01:14:54.196
UNDERSTAND FROM OTHER FOLKS     
WHERE THEY STAND ON THE         
SPECIFICITY OF 12 TO 18 HUNDRED 

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:54.863
WHERE THEY STAND ON THE         
SPECIFICITY OF 12 TO 18 HUNDRED 
AND HOW IT GETS UP              

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:57.733
SPECIFICITY OF 12 TO 18 HUNDRED 
AND HOW IT GETS UP              
OPERATIONALIZE WHEN PEOPLE ARE  

01:14:57.735 --> 01:14:58.467
AND HOW IT GETS UP              
OPERATIONALIZE WHEN PEOPLE ARE  
LOOKING AT IT SAYING OH WELL    

01:14:58.469 --> 01:14:59.034
OPERATIONALIZE WHEN PEOPLE ARE  
LOOKING AT IT SAYING OH WELL    
YOU HIT THE TARGET.             

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:01.570
LOOKING AT IT SAYING OH WELL    
YOU HIT THE TARGET.             
OH SO DO I NOT BRING THIS       

01:15:01.572 --> 01:15:02.237
YOU HIT THE TARGET.             
OH SO DO I NOT BRING THIS       
FORWARD KIND OF A THOUGHT       

01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:05.407
OH SO DO I NOT BRING THIS       
FORWARD KIND OF A THOUGHT       
PROCESS SO I COULD JUMP IN      

01:15:05.409 --> 01:15:05.641
FORWARD KIND OF A THOUGHT       
PROCESS SO I COULD JUMP IN      
THERE?                          

01:15:05.643 --> 01:15:08.711
PROCESS SO I COULD JUMP IN      
THERE?                          
>> YEAH, I THINK PART OF WHAT'S 

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:09.911
THERE?                          
>> YEAH, I THINK PART OF WHAT'S 
MISSING IS WE DON'T HAVE A CITY 

01:15:09.913 --> 01:15:15.751
>> YEAH, I THINK PART OF WHAT'S 
MISSING IS WE DON'T HAVE A CITY 
COUNCIL OR A FRAMEWORK.         

01:15:15.753 --> 01:15:19.454
MISSING IS WE DON'T HAVE A CITY 
COUNCIL OR A FRAMEWORK.         
WE DON'T HAVE A LIKE POPULATION 

01:15:19.456 --> 01:15:19.654
COUNCIL OR A FRAMEWORK.         
WE DON'T HAVE A LIKE POPULATION 
.                               

01:15:19.656 --> 01:15:23.458
WE DON'T HAVE A LIKE POPULATION 
.                               
WE ARE REACTING TO THE MARKET   

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:24.559
.                               
WE ARE REACTING TO THE MARKET   
AND SO CURRENTLY WE ARE BEHIND  

01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:28.129
WE ARE REACTING TO THE MARKET   
AND SO CURRENTLY WE ARE BEHIND  
THE MARKET BECAUSE WE ARE SHORT 

01:15:28.131 --> 01:15:28.597
AND SO CURRENTLY WE ARE BEHIND  
THE MARKET BECAUSE WE ARE SHORT 
ON HOUSING UNITS.               

01:15:28.599 --> 01:15:31.500
THE MARKET BECAUSE WE ARE SHORT 
ON HOUSING UNITS.               
PEOPLE PUT IT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 

01:15:31.502 --> 01:15:32.300
ON HOUSING UNITS.               
PEOPLE PUT IT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN    

01:15:32.302 --> 01:15:32.634
PEOPLE PUT IT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN    
THOUSAND.                       

01:15:32.636 --> 01:15:35.037
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN    
THOUSAND.                       
SO IF WE HIT THAT GOAL THEN DO  

01:15:35.039 --> 01:15:35.870
THOUSAND.                       
SO IF WE HIT THAT GOAL THEN DO  
WE STOP DEVELOPING AND I THINK  

01:15:35.872 --> 01:15:39.274
SO IF WE HIT THAT GOAL THEN DO  
WE STOP DEVELOPING AND I THINK  
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO.       

01:15:39.276 --> 01:15:42.944
WE STOP DEVELOPING AND I THINK  
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO.       
SO ABSENT A ACTUAL POPULATION   

01:15:42.946 --> 01:15:46.648
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO.       
SO ABSENT A ACTUAL POPULATION   
TARGET THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE    

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:47.715
SO ABSENT A ACTUAL POPULATION   
TARGET THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE    
THE CITY DO WE WANT TO SEE THE  

01:15:47.717 --> 01:15:48.083
TARGET THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE    
THE CITY DO WE WANT TO SEE THE  
CITY DOUBLED?                   

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:50.885
THE CITY DO WE WANT TO SEE THE  
CITY DOUBLED?                   
THIS IS A THIRTY FORTY FIFTY    

01:15:50.887 --> 01:15:51.920
CITY DOUBLED?                   
THIS IS A THIRTY FORTY FIFTY    
YEAR LOOK AHEAD AT THE CITY AND 

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:55.290
THIS IS A THIRTY FORTY FIFTY    
YEAR LOOK AHEAD AT THE CITY AND 
I AGAIN JUST REMIND THE         

01:15:55.292 --> 01:15:55.991
YEAR LOOK AHEAD AT THE CITY AND 
I AGAIN JUST REMIND THE         
COMMISSION IN 1970 THEY WERE    

01:15:55.993 --> 01:15:59.094
I AGAIN JUST REMIND THE         
COMMISSION IN 1970 THEY WERE    
DISCUSSING THE CITY WITHIN TEN  

01:15:59.096 --> 01:15:59.828
COMMISSION IN 1970 THEY WERE    
DISCUSSING THE CITY WITHIN TEN  
YEARS GROWING TO ONE HUNDRED    

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:02.230
DISCUSSING THE CITY WITHIN TEN  
YEARS GROWING TO ONE HUNDRED    
AND FIFTY THOUSAND WHEREVER IT  

01:16:02.232 --> 01:16:03.231
YEARS GROWING TO ONE HUNDRED    
AND FIFTY THOUSAND WHEREVER IT  
WAS AT THAT TIME IT WAS UNDER A 

01:16:03.233 --> 01:16:06.301
AND FIFTY THOUSAND WHEREVER IT  
WAS AT THAT TIME IT WAS UNDER A 
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THEY NEVER 

01:16:06.303 --> 01:16:06.768
WAS AT THAT TIME IT WAS UNDER A 
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THEY NEVER 
ACHIEVED THAT.                  

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.669
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THEY NEVER 
ACHIEVED THAT.                  
AND WE KNOW SOMEWHERE IN THE    

01:16:07.671 --> 01:16:10.406
ACHIEVED THAT.                  
AND WE KNOW SOMEWHERE IN THE    
70S WE HAVE SOME CONSTRAINT     

01:16:10.408 --> 01:16:13.609
AND WE KNOW SOMEWHERE IN THE    
70S WE HAVE SOME CONSTRAINT     
THAT PREVENTS US FROM ACTUALLY  

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:14.409
70S WE HAVE SOME CONSTRAINT     
THAT PREVENTS US FROM ACTUALLY  
GETTING ABOVE ONE HUNDRED AND   

01:16:14.411 --> 01:16:14.810
THAT PREVENTS US FROM ACTUALLY  
GETTING ABOVE ONE HUNDRED AND   
TWENTY THOUSAND.                

01:16:14.812 --> 01:16:17.879
GETTING ABOVE ONE HUNDRED AND   
TWENTY THOUSAND.                
SO AS WE THINK ABOUT SO THAT    

01:16:17.881 --> 01:16:18.947
TWENTY THOUSAND.                
SO AS WE THINK ABOUT SO THAT    
WAS PART OF WHY I PERSONALLY    

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:19.514
SO AS WE THINK ABOUT SO THAT    
WAS PART OF WHY I PERSONALLY    
WANTED TO STRIKE ALL OF THIS    

01:16:19.516 --> 01:16:22.584
WAS PART OF WHY I PERSONALLY    
WANTED TO STRIKE ALL OF THIS    
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT LACKED A 

01:16:22.586 --> 01:16:26.054
WANTED TO STRIKE ALL OF THIS    
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT LACKED A 
TIGHT END TO A LARGER GOAL THAT 

01:16:26.056 --> 01:16:26.821
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT LACKED A 
TIGHT END TO A LARGER GOAL THAT 
WE COULD SEE HOW THIS IS        

01:16:26.823 --> 01:16:29.057
TIGHT END TO A LARGER GOAL THAT 
WE COULD SEE HOW THIS IS        
CONTRIBUTING TO.                

01:16:29.059 --> 01:16:29.958
WE COULD SEE HOW THIS IS        
CONTRIBUTING TO.                
AND SO ABSENT THAT AGAIN I WILL 

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.894
CONTRIBUTING TO.                
AND SO ABSENT THAT AGAIN I WILL 
GO BACK TO THE ECONOMIC         

01:16:32.896 --> 01:16:33.628
AND SO ABSENT THAT AGAIN I WILL 
GO BACK TO THE ECONOMIC         
DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT TO SEE IF  

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:37.065
GO BACK TO THE ECONOMIC         
DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT TO SEE IF  
MR FOURNIER HAD ANYTHING ABOUT  

01:16:37.067 --> 01:16:37.565
DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT TO SEE IF  
MR FOURNIER HAD ANYTHING ABOUT  
POPULATION GROWTH.              

01:16:37.567 --> 01:16:38.367
MR FOURNIER HAD ANYTHING ABOUT  
POPULATION GROWTH.              
I KNOW HE HAS SOMETHING IN      

01:16:38.369 --> 01:16:41.703
POPULATION GROWTH.              
I KNOW HE HAS SOMETHING IN      
THERE ABOUT UNIT NEED AND SO    

01:16:41.705 --> 01:16:45.607
I KNOW HE HAS SOMETHING IN      
THERE ABOUT UNIT NEED AND SO    
TRY TO ALIGN THOSE TWO THINGS   

01:16:45.609 --> 01:16:46.341
THERE ABOUT UNIT NEED AND SO    
TRY TO ALIGN THOSE TWO THINGS   
WOULD BE SORT OF MY COOKOFF FOR 

01:16:46.343 --> 01:16:46.742
TRY TO ALIGN THOSE TWO THINGS   
WOULD BE SORT OF MY COOKOFF FOR 
THAT PART.                      

01:16:46.744 --> 01:16:50.812
WOULD BE SORT OF MY COOKOFF FOR 
THAT PART.                      
THE DISCUSSION.                 

01:16:50.814 --> 01:16:52.013
THAT PART.                      
THE DISCUSSION.                 
>> SO MY INTERPRETATION OF THIS 

01:16:52.015 --> 01:16:52.748
THE DISCUSSION.                 
>> SO MY INTERPRETATION OF THIS 
IS IT ALIGNS WITH OUR GOAL      

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.950
>> SO MY INTERPRETATION OF THIS 
IS IT ALIGNS WITH OUR GOAL      
OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY RIGHT.    

01:16:54.952 --> 01:16:55.817
IS IT ALIGNS WITH OUR GOAL      
OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY RIGHT.    
WE'RE TRYING TO DOUBLE OR       

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:56.618
OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY RIGHT.    
WE'RE TRYING TO DOUBLE OR       
TRIPLE THE AMOUNT THAT WE       

01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:59.053
WE'RE TRYING TO DOUBLE OR       
TRIPLE THE AMOUNT THAT WE       
CURRENT OUR CURRENT HOUSING     

01:16:59.055 --> 01:16:59.888
TRIPLE THE AMOUNT THAT WE       
CURRENT OUR CURRENT HOUSING     
DEVELOPMENT IS BUT I CAN SEE    

01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:03.258
CURRENT OUR CURRENT HOUSING     
DEVELOPMENT IS BUT I CAN SEE    
THAT THAT ALSO MAYBE DOESN'T    

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:06.261
DEVELOPMENT IS BUT I CAN SEE    
THAT THAT ALSO MAYBE DOESN'T    
GET AT WHAT WE WANT IS THE NEXT 

01:17:06.263 --> 01:17:07.229
THAT THAT ALSO MAYBE DOESN'T    
GET AT WHAT WE WANT IS THE NEXT 
BULLET POINT IS THE DIVERSITY   

01:17:07.231 --> 01:17:07.695
GET AT WHAT WE WANT IS THE NEXT 
BULLET POINT IS THE DIVERSITY   
OF HOUSING TYPES.               

01:17:07.697 --> 01:17:08.030
BULLET POINT IS THE DIVERSITY   
OF HOUSING TYPES.               
RIGHT?                          

01:17:08.032 --> 01:17:10.131
OF HOUSING TYPES.               
RIGHT?                          
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT       

01:17:10.133 --> 01:17:10.766
RIGHT?                          
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT       
TWELVE HUNDRED OF THE SAME      

01:17:10.768 --> 01:17:14.169
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT       
TWELVE HUNDRED OF THE SAME      
EXACT UNIT BEING BUILT SO THOSE 

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:14.770
TWELVE HUNDRED OF THE SAME      
EXACT UNIT BEING BUILT SO THOSE 
COULD BE TIED TOGETHER.         

01:17:14.772 --> 01:17:18.240
EXACT UNIT BEING BUILT SO THOSE 
COULD BE TIED TOGETHER.         
THERE WERE ALSO COMMENTS IN     

01:17:18.242 --> 01:17:18.907
COULD BE TIED TOGETHER.         
THERE WERE ALSO COMMENTS IN     
HERE ABOUT HOW MAYBE VACANCY    

01:17:18.909 --> 01:17:21.543
THERE WERE ALSO COMMENTS IN     
HERE ABOUT HOW MAYBE VACANCY    
RATE IS A BETTER METRIC.        

01:17:21.545 --> 01:17:22.710
HERE ABOUT HOW MAYBE VACANCY    
RATE IS A BETTER METRIC.        
>> YES, THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE    

01:17:22.712 --> 01:17:25.880
RATE IS A BETTER METRIC.        
>> YES, THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE    
WHO COMMENTED ON THAT AND SO IF 

01:17:25.882 --> 01:17:28.984
>> YES, THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE    
WHO COMMENTED ON THAT AND SO IF 
WE DO GO THIS ROUTE WHERE WE    

01:17:28.986 --> 01:17:29.985
WHO COMMENTED ON THAT AND SO IF 
WE DO GO THIS ROUTE WHERE WE    
WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC AND    

01:17:29.987 --> 01:17:33.254
WE DO GO THIS ROUTE WHERE WE    
WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC AND    
PUT THESE UNDER OUR GOALS, YOU  

01:17:33.256 --> 01:17:34.256
WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC AND    
PUT THESE UNDER OUR GOALS, YOU  
KNOW, THEN WE'D HAVE TO FIGURE  

01:17:34.258 --> 01:17:34.990
PUT THESE UNDER OUR GOALS, YOU  
KNOW, THEN WE'D HAVE TO FIGURE  
OUT WE COULD HAVE A HEALTHY     

01:17:34.992 --> 01:17:37.526
KNOW, THEN WE'D HAVE TO FIGURE  
OUT WE COULD HAVE A HEALTHY     
VACANCY RATE WHICH WE CURRENTLY 

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:37.926
OUT WE COULD HAVE A HEALTHY     
VACANCY RATE WHICH WE CURRENTLY 
DO NOT HAVE.                    

01:17:37.928 --> 01:17:41.463
VACANCY RATE WHICH WE CURRENTLY 
DO NOT HAVE.                    
SO THAT COULD ONCE WE ACHIEVE   

01:17:41.465 --> 01:17:42.164
DO NOT HAVE.                    
SO THAT COULD ONCE WE ACHIEVE   
THAT THEN IT'S LIKE OH NOW      

01:17:42.166 --> 01:17:44.700
SO THAT COULD ONCE WE ACHIEVE   
THAT THEN IT'S LIKE OH NOW      
WE'RE FINALLY WHERE WE NEED TO  

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:44.967
THAT THEN IT'S LIKE OH NOW      
WE'RE FINALLY WHERE WE NEED TO  
BE.                             

01:17:44.969 --> 01:17:48.069
WE'RE FINALLY WHERE WE NEED TO  
BE.                             
SO AND WE HEARD THAT LAST WHEN  

01:17:48.071 --> 01:17:52.340
BE.                             
SO AND WE HEARD THAT LAST WHEN  
WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS.        

01:17:52.342 --> 01:17:53.274
SO AND WE HEARD THAT LAST WHEN  
WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS.        
I ALSO NOTICED IN THE QUESTIONS 

01:17:53.276 --> 01:17:56.844
WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS.        
I ALSO NOTICED IN THE QUESTIONS 
FROM STAFF THAT WAS THAT OUR    

01:17:56.846 --> 01:17:57.546
I ALSO NOTICED IN THE QUESTIONS 
FROM STAFF THAT WAS THAT OUR    
PACKET A COMMENT THAT THESE     

01:17:57.548 --> 01:18:00.415
FROM STAFF THAT WAS THAT OUR    
PACKET A COMMENT THAT THESE     
NUMBERS APPROXIMATELY TWO TO    

01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:01.083
PACKET A COMMENT THAT THESE     
NUMBERS APPROXIMATELY TWO TO    
THREE TIMES THE CITY'S CURRENT  

01:18:01.085 --> 01:18:04.119
NUMBERS APPROXIMATELY TWO TO    
THREE TIMES THE CITY'S CURRENT  
ANNUAL PRODUCTION.              

01:18:04.121 --> 01:18:05.253
THREE TIMES THE CITY'S CURRENT  
ANNUAL PRODUCTION.              
SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S HELPFUL 

01:18:05.255 --> 01:18:07.856
ANNUAL PRODUCTION.              
SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S HELPFUL 
TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE DOUBLE    

01:18:07.858 --> 01:18:08.923
SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S HELPFUL 
TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE DOUBLE    
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE    

01:18:08.925 --> 01:18:11.993
TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE DOUBLE    
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE    
BEING BUILT HERE OR SOMETHING   

01:18:11.995 --> 01:18:13.162
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE

LIKE I THINK I DON'T LIKE THE   

01:18:13.164 --> 01:18:16.031
BEING BUILT HERE OR SOMETHING   
LIKE I THINK I DON'T LIKE THE   
TOTAL GENERALITY OF INCREASE    

01:18:16.033 --> 01:18:19.334
LIKE I THINK I DON'T LIKE THE   
TOTAL GENERALITY OF INCREASE    
LIKE BY ONE YOU KNOW, SO        

01:18:19.336 --> 01:18:20.102
TOTAL GENERALITY OF INCREASE    
LIKE BY ONE YOU KNOW, SO        
SOMETHING WHICH IS ASPIRATIONAL 

01:18:20.104 --> 01:18:26.375
LIKE BY ONE YOU KNOW, SO        
SOMETHING WHICH IS ASPIRATIONAL 
BUT THAT IS                     

01:18:40.857 --> 01:18:42.890
            THERE'S SOMETHING   
ODD ABOUT THE TWELVE HUNDRED    
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND THE TWENTY 

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:43.358
ODD ABOUT THE TWELVE HUNDRED    
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND THE TWENTY 
FIVE YEARS FOR ME.

>> YEAH I JUST I, I DON'T MIND  
THE SPECIFICITY.                
I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO BE    

01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:46.361
THE SPECIFICITY.                
I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO BE    
SPECIFIC WE SHOULD BE SPECIFIC  

01:18:46.363 --> 01:18:46.962
I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO BE    
SPECIFIC WE SHOULD BE SPECIFIC  
LIKE MOST OF THOSE OTHER        

01:18:46.964 --> 01:18:47.763

VERY SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE AND AN  
INCREDIBLY VAGUE OBJECTIVE      

01:20:12.749 --> 01:20:13.381
VERY SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE AND AN  
INCREDIBLY VAGUE OBJECTIVE      
RIGHT BELOW IT.                 

01:20:13.383 --> 01:20:16.618
INCREDIBLY VAGUE OBJECTIVE      
RIGHT BELOW IT.                 
>> YEAH, I FEEL CLEAR THE       

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.552
RIGHT BELOW IT.                 
>> YEAH, I FEEL CLEAR THE       
DIRECTION ON THIS BUT THE ONLY  

01:20:17.554 --> 01:20:20.989
>> YEAH, I FEEL CLEAR THE       
DIRECTION ON THIS BUT THE ONLY  
ADDITIONAL THING THAT IS GOING  

01:20:20.991 --> 01:20:21.723
DIRECTION ON THIS BUT THE ONLY  
ADDITIONAL THING THAT IS GOING  
TO ADD AND I DON'T THINK I      

01:20:21.725 --> 01:20:24.393
ADDITIONAL THING THAT IS GOING  
TO ADD AND I DON'T THINK I      
PICKED IT UP LATER ON IS        

01:20:24.395 --> 01:20:28.529
TO ADD AND I DON'T THINK I      
PICKED IT UP LATER ON IS        
HOUSING IS IMPORTANT AND        

01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:29.197
PICKED IT UP LATER ON IS        
HOUSING IS IMPORTANT AND        
SUSTAINABILITY IS IMPORTANT IN  

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:31.366
HOUSING IS IMPORTANT AND        
SUSTAINABILITY IS IMPORTANT IN  
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE LINKED AND 

01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:32.367
SUSTAINABILITY IS IMPORTANT IN  
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE LINKED AND 
JUST THE LAST BULLET THAT TALKS 

01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:33.035
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE LINKED AND 
JUST THE LAST BULLET THAT TALKS 
ABOUT REDUCE VEHICLE MILES      

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:35.971
JUST THE LAST BULLET THAT TALKS 
ABOUT REDUCE VEHICLE MILES      
TRAVELED I FEEL LIKE IF WE IF   

01:20:35.973 --> 01:20:36.838
ABOUT REDUCE VEHICLE MILES      
TRAVELED I FEEL LIKE IF WE IF   
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO 

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.574
TRAVELED I FEEL LIKE IF WE IF   
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO 
HERE IS INCORPORATE A TWO ZERO  

01:20:39.576 --> 01:20:40.342
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO 
HERE IS INCORPORATE A TWO ZERO  
THAT THERE IS SPECIFICITY IN    

01:20:40.344 --> 01:20:40.809
HERE IS INCORPORATE A TWO ZERO  
THAT THERE IS SPECIFICITY IN    
THAT ONE TOO.                   

01:20:40.811 --> 01:20:44.212
THAT THERE IS SPECIFICITY IN    
THAT ONE TOO.                   
AND SO THERE COULD BE AND I     

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:47.082
THAT ONE TOO.                   
AND SO THERE COULD BE AND I     
THINK THAT WE GET AT SOME       

01:20:47.084 --> 01:20:47.815
AND SO THERE COULD BE AND I     
THINK THAT WE GET AT SOME       
OF THAT BUT ACTUALLY I THINK    

01:20:47.817 --> 01:20:48.617
THINK THAT WE GET AT SOME       
OF THAT BUT ACTUALLY I THINK    
THAT IT'S A LOT VAGUER TO BE    

01:20:48.619 --> 01:20:51.386
OF THAT BUT ACTUALLY I THINK    
THAT IT'S A LOT VAGUER TO BE    
REAL HONEST ON THIS ON THE      

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.287
THAT IT'S A LOT VAGUER TO BE    
REAL HONEST ON THIS ON THE      
SUSTAINABILITY THINGS EVEN      

01:20:53.289 --> 01:20:58.193
REAL HONEST ON THIS ON THE      
SUSTAINABILITY THINGS EVEN      
RELATED TO MORE OR EVEN RELATED 

01:20:58.195 --> 01:20:59.060
SUSTAINABILITY THINGS EVEN      
RELATED TO MORE OR EVEN RELATED 
TO TRANSPORTATION IF YOU TRAVEL 

01:20:59.062 --> 01:21:02.230
RELATED TO MORE OR EVEN RELATED 
TO TRANSPORTATION IF YOU TRAVEL 
WHICH WE HAVE ANOTHER DOCUMENT  

01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:04.499
TO TRANSPORTATION IF YOU TRAVEL 
WHICH WE HAVE ANOTHER DOCUMENT  
IN OUR GOAL BUT HAS A WHOLE LOT 

01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:08.569
WHICH WE HAVE ANOTHER DOCUMENT  
IN OUR GOAL BUT HAS A WHOLE LOT 
SO WHICH ISN'T WHICH ISN'T      

01:21:08.571 --> 01:21:09.338

SO WHICH ISN'T WHICH ISN'T      
GOING AWAY RIGHT NOW.

SO WHICH ISN'T WHICH ISN'T      
GOING AWAY RIGHT NOW.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.274
GOING AWAY RIGHT NOW.           
>> SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY I        
REFERENCED THAT OR THE FACT     

01:21:13.276 --> 01:21:14.142
>> SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY I        
REFERENCED THAT OR THE FACT     
THAT IT'S IN THERE I THINK      

01:21:14.144 --> 01:21:17.612
REFERENCED THAT OR THE FACT     
THAT IT'S IN THERE I THINK      
HELPS GIVE IT SOME PARITY LIKE  

01:21:17.614 --> 01:21:20.782
THAT IT'S IN THERE I THINK      
HELPS GIVE IT SOME PARITY LIKE  
THAT.                           

01:21:20.784 --> 01:21:21.983
HELPS GIVE IT SOME PARITY LIKE  
THAT.                           
>> WE'RE NOT OF ONE YOU KNOW,   

01:21:21.985 --> 01:21:24.852
THAT.

LIKE SOLELY FOCUSED.            
HEY, BY THE WAY, REMEMBER THIS  

01:21:26.089 --> 01:21:28.623
LIKE SOLELY FOCUSED.            
HEY, BY THE WAY, REMEMBER THIS  
IS ALSO PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE 

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:29.391
HEY, BY THE WAY, REMEMBER THIS  
IS ALSO PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE 
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THE     

01:21:29.393 --> 01:21:30.125
IS ALSO PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE 
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THE     
GUIDING PRINCIPLES WERE         

01:21:30.127 --> 01:21:32.794
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THE     
GUIDING PRINCIPLES WERE         
AFFORDABILITY AND               

01:21:32.796 --> 01:21:33.328
GUIDING PRINCIPLES WERE         
AFFORDABILITY AND               
SUSTAINABILITY.

AFFORDABILITY AND               
SUSTAINABILITY.                 
SO I WANT TO MAKE THAT PART     

01:21:34.097 --> 01:21:37.299
SUSTAINABILITY.                 
SO I WANT TO MAKE THAT PART     
CLEAR AS WELL IF I RECALL       

01:21:37.301 --> 01:21:37.899
SO I WANT TO MAKE THAT PART     
CLEAR AS WELL IF I RECALL       
CORRECTLY WAS 50 PERCENT        

01:21:37.901 --> 01:21:40.569

CORRECTLY WAS 50 PERCENT        
REDUCTION OF SINGLE OCCUPANT    

01:21:40.571 --> 01:21:41.035
CORRECTLY WAS 50 PERCENT        
REDUCTION OF SINGLE OCCUPANT    
VEHICLES.                       

01:21:41.037 --> 01:21:41.969
REDUCTION OF SINGLE OCCUPANT    
VEHICLES.

ZERO.                           
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING TO  
ASK IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO BE

WELL, THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING TO  
ASK IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO BE

LIKE TO SEE IT SAVE REDUCE      
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BY 50

         MAYBE I'LL KEEP MY EYE 
ON THEM TO THERE IS A GRAPHIC

ON, YOU KNOW, FOR A LONG.       
BUT I HAVE MORE TO SAY I'M PAID 
FOR BUT I JUST MEAN THAT THIS

GRAPHIC ON PAGE FORTY EIGHT     
THAT SHOWS REALLY HOW LOW OUR   
HOUSING PRODUCTION IS NOW WHILE

THAT SHOWS REALLY HOW LOW OUR   
HOUSING PRODUCTION IS NOW WHILE 
THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO

HOUSING PRODUCTION IS NOW WHILE 
THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO   
LIVE HERE NOW THEY FEEL AS      

01:22:41.598 --> 01:22:42.664
THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO   
LIVE HERE NOW THEY FEEL AS      
THOUGH THERE IS A MASSIVE       

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:43.465
LIVE HERE NOW THEY FEEL AS      
THOUGH THERE IS A MASSIVE       
AMOUNT OF STUFF GOING ON BLAH   

01:22:43.467 --> 01:22:46.534
THOUGH THERE IS A MASSIVE       
AMOUNT OF STUFF GOING ON BLAH   
BLAH BUT I MEAN OUR PRODUCTION  

01:22:46.536 --> 01:22:50.672
AMOUNT OF STUFF GOING ON BLAH   
BLAH BUT I MEAN OUR PRODUCTION  
IS AN EVEN HALF WHAT IT WAS IN  

01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:57.412
BLAH BUT I MEAN OUR PRODUCTION  
IS AN EVEN HALF WHAT IT WAS IN  
FROM NUMBERS BUT FROM 70 TO 79  

01:22:57.414 --> 01:22:57.813
IS AN EVEN HALF WHAT IT WAS IN  
FROM NUMBERS BUT FROM 70 TO 79  
YOU'RE RIGHT.                   

01:22:57.815 --> 01:22:58.813
FROM NUMBERS BUT FROM 70 TO 79  
YOU'RE RIGHT.                   
IT'S NOT EVEN HALF WHAT IT WAS  

01:22:58.815 --> 01:23:01.749
YOU'RE RIGHT.                   
IT'S NOT EVEN HALF WHAT IT WAS  
THEN WHICH IS OFF PEAK AND      

01:23:01.751 --> 01:23:05.253
IT'S NOT EVEN HALF WHAT IT WAS  
THEN WHICH IS OFF PEAK AND      
WE'RE ON PACE TO NOT DEVELOP AS 

01:23:05.255 --> 01:23:06.220
THEN WHICH IS OFF PEAK AND      
WE'RE ON PACE TO NOT DEVELOP AS 
MUCH AS WE DID LAST YEAR AS FAR 

01:23:06.222 --> 01:23:08.089
WE'RE ON PACE TO NOT DEVELOP AS 
MUCH AS WE DID LAST YEAR AS FAR 
AS I CAN SEE.

MUCH AS WE DID LAST YEAR AS FAR 
AS I CAN SEE.                   
AND SO I THINK THAT MIGHT HELP  

01:23:09.459 --> 01:23:15.730
AS I CAN SEE.                   
AND SO I THINK THAT MIGHT HELP

WE ARE FOLLOWING A WAVE THAT'S  

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:12.867
NOT LIKE THE PIONEERS OF THIS.  
WE ARE FOLLOWING A WAVE THAT'S

BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT  
IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL SOME       

01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:21.276
BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT  
IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL SOME       
OF THE IN SOME OF THESE         

01:27:21.278 --> 01:27:27.782

WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT WE      
SHOULD STRIKE IT BECAUSE        

01:30:39.342 --> 01:30:41.609
WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT WE      
SHOULD STRIKE IT BECAUSE        
THEY'RE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS.  

01:30:41.611 --> 01:30:42.276
SHOULD STRIKE IT BECAUSE        
THEY'RE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS.  
THEY'RE DIFFERENT CONTEXTS.     

01:30:42.278 --> 01:30:45.212
THEY'RE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS.  
THEY'RE DIFFERENT CONTEXTS.     
AND SO AGAIN, LIKE MY THOUGHT   

01:30:45.214 --> 01:30:46.013
THEY'RE DIFFERENT CONTEXTS.     
AND SO AGAIN, LIKE MY THOUGHT   
PROCESSES HOW IS LIKE THIS      

01:30:46.015 --> 01:30:46.781
AND SO AGAIN, LIKE MY THOUGHT   
PROCESSES HOW IS LIKE THIS      
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN GOING TO BE  

01:30:46.783 --> 01:30:49.784
PROCESSES HOW IS LIKE THIS      
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN GOING TO BE  
OPERATIONALIZED WHEN PEOPLE ARE 

01:30:49.786 --> 01:30:50.518
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN GOING TO BE  
OPERATIONALIZED WHEN PEOPLE ARE 
READING IT THEY GET TWENTY      

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.253
OPERATIONALIZED WHEN PEOPLE ARE 
READING IT THEY GET TWENTY      
YEARS ON THE ROAD RIGHT.        

01:30:53.255 --> 01:30:54.088
READING IT THEY GET TWENTY      
YEARS ON THE ROAD RIGHT.        
THEY'RE LIKE OH LOOK AT

THEY'RE LIKE OH LOOK AT         
MINNEAPOLIS.                    
I WONDER WHY THIS IS HERE.      

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.293
MINNEAPOLIS.                    
I WONDER WHY THIS IS HERE.      
IS IT PERTINENT OR RELEVANT?    

01:30:58.295 --> 01:30:59.093
I WONDER WHY THIS IS HERE.      
IS IT PERTINENT OR RELEVANT?    
I MEAN IT'S GOOD THAT WE'VE     

01:30:59.095 --> 01:31:01.495
IS IT PERTINENT OR RELEVANT?    
I MEAN IT'S GOOD THAT WE'VE     
DONE THE RESEARCH AND THE CASE  

01:31:01.497 --> 01:31:01.763
I MEAN IT'S GOOD THAT WE'VE     
DONE THE RESEARCH AND THE CASE  
STUDIES.                        

01:31:01.765 --> 01:31:02.830
DONE THE RESEARCH AND THE CASE  
STUDIES.                        
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT HAS     

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:05.633

I JUST DON'T THINK THAT HAS     
GRAVITAS OR RELEVANCE LONGEVITY

SHOULD JUST SEE WHY THAT IS.    

01:45:48.750 --> 01:45:52.252
COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY WE       
SHOULD JUST SEE WHY THAT IS.    
WHY IS THAT WHY IS THE STATE    

01:45:52.254 --> 01:45:52.986
SHOULD JUST SEE WHY THAT IS.    
WHY IS THAT WHY IS THE STATE    
TARGET NOT APPROPRIATE FOR US

01:46:03.232 --> 01:46:04.164
IT'S ABOUT NOT BEING CONFUSING  
AND I THINK ON THE LEFT COLUMN  
THE OTHER CONFUSING THING IS

AND I THINK ON THE LEFT COLUMN  
THE OTHER CONFUSING THING IS    
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SAYING     

01:46:06.301 --> 01:46:07.500
THE OTHER CONFUSING THING IS    
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SAYING     
THAT ALL OF OUR GROWTH IS IN    

01:46:07.502 --> 01:46:11.004
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SAYING     
THAT ALL OF OUR GROWTH IS IN    
STUDENT HOUSEHOLDS NOT IN NON   

01:46:11.006 --> 01:46:11.671
THAT ALL OF OUR GROWTH IS IN

STUDENT HOUSEHOLDS BUT THE      
DECLINE IN STUDENT HOUSEHOLDS   

01:46:14.876 --> 01:46:15.609
STUDENT HOUSEHOLDS BUT THE      
DECLINE IN STUDENT HOUSEHOLDS   
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE MEETING 

01:46:15.611 --> 01:46:16.009
DECLINE IN STUDENT HOUSEHOLDS   
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE MEETING 
DEMAND.

DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE MEETING 
DEMAND.                         
SO IT'S LIKE I TWIST MYSELF IN  

01:46:19.281 --> 01:46:19.980
DEMAND.

>> SO MAYBE THE SENTENCE NEEDS  
TO BE BLOWN UP.                 
THAT WAS A SUGGESTION I HEARD   

01:53:52.367 --> 01:53:54.501
TO BE BLOWN UP.                 
THAT WAS A SUGGESTION I HEARD   
FROM COMMISSIONER NORTON AND I

SAYS THIS IS ALL THAT THE       

01:55:44.913 --> 01:55:48.648
CREATES MORE CONSISTENCY THAT   
SAYS THIS IS ALL THAT THE       
DOTTED LINE YOU LIKE THAT IF    

01:55:48.650 --> 01:55:49.582
SAYS THIS IS ALL THAT THE       
DOTTED LINE YOU LIKE THAT IF    
YOU DID WHAT COMMISSIONER MILLS 

01:55:49.584 --> 01:55:52.618
DOTTED LINE YOU LIKE THAT IF    
YOU DID WHAT COMMISSIONER MILLS 
SAID ON TOP OF IT BUT IT MAY BE 

01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.688
YOU DID WHAT COMMISSIONER MILLS 
SAID ON TOP OF IT BUT IT MAY BE 
WORTH EXPLAINING THAT THIS IS   

01:55:55.690 --> 01:55:56.889
SAID ON TOP OF IT BUT IT MAY BE 
WORTH EXPLAINING THAT THIS IS   
LOOKING AT TOTAL UNITS OVER TEN 

01:55:56.891 --> 01:56:00.527
WORTH EXPLAINING THAT THIS IS   
LOOKING AT TOTAL UNITS OVER TEN 
YEARS SOMEWHERE SO THAT PEOPLE  

01:56:00.529 --> 01:56:04.230
LOOKING AT TOTAL UNITS OVER TEN 
YEARS SOMEWHERE SO THAT PEOPLE  
EITHER CAN DO MATH OR YOU CAN   

01:56:04.232 --> 01:56:04.797
YEARS SOMEWHERE SO THAT PEOPLE  
EITHER CAN DO MATH OR YOU CAN   
GIVE THEM THE AVERAGE.          

01:56:04.799 --> 01:56:05.531
EITHER CAN DO MATH OR YOU CAN   
GIVE THEM THE AVERAGE.          
YEAH, BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE    

01:56:05.533 --> 01:56:07.132
GIVE THEM THE AVERAGE.          
YEAH, BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE    
LOOK AT THIS AND GO OH WE'RE    

01:56:07.134 --> 01:56:07.801
YEAH, BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE    
LOOK AT THIS AND GO OH WE'RE    
BUILDING THIRTY THREE HUNDRED   

01:56:07.803 --> 01:56:11.003
LOOK AT THIS AND GO OH WE'RE    
BUILDING THIRTY THREE HUNDRED   
UNITS OF HOUSING EVERY YEAR FOR 

01:56:11.005 --> 01:56:11.504
BUILDING THIRTY THREE HUNDRED   
UNITS OF HOUSING EVERY YEAR FOR 
THE LAST TEN YEARS.             

01:56:11.506 --> 01:56:12.439
UNITS OF HOUSING EVERY YEAR FOR 
THE LAST TEN YEARS.             
NO WE'RE BUILDING THREE HUNDRED 

01:56:12.441 --> 01:56:15.541
THE LAST TEN YEARS.             
NO WE'RE BUILDING THREE HUNDRED 
AND SEVENTY UNITS OF HOUSING A  

01:56:15.543 --> 01:56:17.911
NO WE'RE BUILDING THREE HUNDRED 
AND SEVENTY UNITS OF HOUSING A  
YEAR OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS SO 

01:56:17.913 --> 01:56:21.881
AND SEVENTY UNITS OF HOUSING A  
YEAR OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS SO 
SO THE TITLE COULD BE TOTAL     

01:56:21.883 --> 01:56:22.748
YEAR OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS SO 
SO THE TITLE COULD BE TOTAL     
NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS BUT     

01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:26.852
SO THE TITLE COULD BE TOTAL     
NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS BUT     
DECADE AGO NOT BY YEAR BUILT    

01:56:26.854 --> 01:56:30.256
NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS BUT     
DECADE AGO NOT BY YEAR BUILT    
RIGHT.                          

01:56:30.258 --> 01:56:31.557
DECADE AGO NOT BY YEAR BUILT    
RIGHT.                          
AND THEN YOU COULD PUT IN THE   

01:56:31.559 --> 01:56:34.461
RIGHT.                          
AND THEN YOU COULD PUT IN THE   
IT LINE THAT COMMISSIONER MILLS 

01:56:34.463 --> 01:56:35.328
AND THEN YOU COULD PUT IN THE   
IT LINE THAT COMMISSIONER MILLS 
SUGGESTED FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND 

01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:37.397
IT LINE THAT COMMISSIONER MILLS 
SUGGESTED FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND 
THAT'S THE PIPELINE THROUGH     

01:56:37.399 --> 01:56:41.233
SUGGESTED FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND 
THAT'S THE PIPELINE THROUGH     
TWENTY OR DO A PROJECTION.      

01:56:41.235 --> 01:56:42.235
THAT'S THE PIPELINE THROUGH     
TWENTY OR DO A PROJECTION.      
I KNOW THE DATA DOESN'T EXIST   

01:56:42.237 --> 01:56:45.137
TWENTY OR DO A PROJECTION.      
I KNOW THE DATA DOESN'T EXIST   
JUST YOU COULD DO YOUR BEST AND 

01:56:45.139 --> 01:56:45.705
I KNOW THE DATA DOESN'T EXIST   
JUST YOU COULD DO YOUR BEST AND 
PUT AN ASTERISK.                

01:56:45.707 --> 01:56:46.705
JUST YOU COULD DO YOUR BEST AND 
PUT AN ASTERISK.                
>> THIS IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE    

01:56:46.707 --> 01:56:49.341
PUT AN ASTERISK.                
>> THIS IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE    
OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THIS     

01:56:49.343 --> 01:56:50.276
>> THIS IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE    
OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THIS     
NEXT TEN YEARS AT OUR CURRENT   

01:56:50.278 --> 01:56:53.813
OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THIS     
NEXT TEN YEARS AT OUR CURRENT   
RATE IF I MIGHT I THOUGHT ABOUT 

01:56:53.815 --> 01:56:54.213
NEXT TEN YEARS AT OUR CURRENT   
RATE IF I MIGHT I THOUGHT ABOUT 
THIS ONE A LOT.                 

01:56:54.215 --> 01:56:56.549
RATE IF I MIGHT I THOUGHT ABOUT 
THIS ONE A LOT.                 
THIS DATA IS PULLED FROM THE    

01:56:56.551 --> 01:56:56.816
THIS ONE A LOT.                 
THIS DATA IS PULLED FROM THE    
CENSUS.                         

01:56:56.818 --> 01:56:57.917
THIS DATA IS PULLED FROM THE    
CENSUS.                         
SO THIS IS THE CURRENT LIKE THE 

01:56:57.919 --> 01:57:00.687
CENSUS.                         
SO THIS IS THE CURRENT LIKE THE 
AGE OF THE CURRENT HOUSING      

01:57:00.689 --> 01:57:01.020
SO THIS IS THE CURRENT LIKE THE 
AGE OF THE CURRENT HOUSING      
UNITS.                          

01:57:01.022 --> 01:57:01.821
AGE OF THE CURRENT HOUSING      
UNITS.                          
SO THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY WHAT    

01:57:01.823 --> 01:57:04.056
UNITS.                          
SO THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY WHAT    
WAS BUILT IF SOMETHING WAS TORN 

01:57:04.058 --> 01:57:07.861
SO THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY WHAT    
WAS BUILT IF SOMETHING WAS TORN 
DOWN IT IS TAKEN OUT OF THIS SO 

01:57:07.863 --> 01:57:09.061
WAS BUILT IF SOMETHING WAS TORN 
DOWN IT IS TAKEN OUT OF THIS SO 
OVER TIME IF THAT MAKES SENSE   

01:57:09.063 --> 01:57:12.932

THAT'S NOT TRUE.                
THAT'S JUST FOR ME THAT SEEMS   
TO ME LIKE A KEY CONSIDERATION  

02:08:42.389 --> 02:08:42.988
THAT'S JUST FOR ME THAT SEEMS   
TO ME LIKE A KEY CONSIDERATION  
FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.        

02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:46.725
TO ME LIKE A KEY CONSIDERATION  
FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.        
>> OK, THE OTHER LEG WHAT MIGHT

BE INCLUDED IN KEY              
CONSIDERATIONS IS THE IDEA AND  
THE MAP ACTUALLY MAKES A GOOD   

02:08:54.235 --> 02:08:55.167
CONSIDERATIONS IS THE IDEA AND  
THE MAP ACTUALLY MAKES A GOOD   
PLACE TO TALK ABOUT THIS THAT   

02:08:55.169 --> 02:08:58.704
THE MAP ACTUALLY MAKES A GOOD   
PLACE TO TALK ABOUT THIS THAT   
OUR HOUSEHOLD SIZE HAS REDUCED. 

02:08:58.706 --> 02:09:01.339
PLACE TO TALK ABOUT THIS THAT   
OUR HOUSEHOLD SIZE HAS REDUCED. 
SO THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN WE  

02:09:01.341 --> 02:09:02.040
OUR HOUSEHOLD SIZE HAS REDUCED. 
SO THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN WE  
THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE     

02:09:02.042 --> 02:09:02.774
SO THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN WE  
THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE     
BUILT FOR THE FIFTIES, THEY     

02:09:02.776 --> 02:09:03.575
THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE     
BUILT FOR THE FIFTIES, THEY     
WERE BUILT FOR THE FAMILY SIZE  

02:09:03.577 --> 02:09:06.611
BUILT FOR THE FIFTIES, THEY     
WERE BUILT FOR THE FAMILY SIZE  
OF THE FIFTIES AND WE HAVE      

02:09:06.613 --> 02:09:07.346
WERE BUILT FOR THE FAMILY SIZE  
OF THE FIFTIES AND WE HAVE      
FEWER PEOPLE IN EACH OF THOSE   

02:09:07.348 --> 02:09:09.414
OF THE FIFTIES AND WE HAVE      
FEWER PEOPLE IN EACH OF THOSE

02:09:09.416 --> 02:09:10.415
FEWER PEOPLE IN EACH OF THOSE   
HOUSES NOW THAN WE USED TO.     
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS AND    

02:09:10.417 --> 02:09:13.418
HOUSES NOW THAN WE USED TO.     
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS AND    
THAT'S A KEY CONSIDERATION AS   

02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:14.052
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS AND    
THAT'S A KEY CONSIDERATION AS   
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE        

02:09:14.054 --> 02:09:14.720
THAT'S A KEY CONSIDERATION AS   
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE        
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THOSE 

02:09:14.722 --> 02:09:17.956
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

HOUSES LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THOSE 
NEIGHBORHOODS AND I FEEL LIKE   
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH    

02:09:22.396 --> 02:09:24.830
NEIGHBORHOODS AND I FEEL LIKE   
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH    
ADIEUS THAT'S CLICKED FOR A LOT 

02:09:24.832 --> 02:09:28.100
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH    
ADIEUS THAT'S CLICKED FOR A LOT 
OF A LOT OF FOLKS IN THOSE      

02:09:28.102 --> 02:09:28.701

NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO THAT MIGHT 
BE USEFUL TO BRING UP HERE.

AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED BUT IT   

02:10:46.681 --> 02:10:47.779
WE'VE MADE ALL THESE CHANGES    
AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED BUT IT   
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE MORE MAYBE IT 

02:10:47.781 --> 02:10:50.982
AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED BUT IT   
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE MORE MAYBE IT 
HAS MAYBE SOME OF THE THINGS

SOUNDS TO ME LIKE MORE MAYBE IT 
HAS MAYBE SOME OF THE THINGS    
WE'VE DONE ARE ACTUALLY

BY INCREASED HOUSING NUMBERS.   

02:10:55.056 --> 02:10:58.490

I CAN'T SEE THAT IN TWENTY      
TWENTY THREE THE AVERAGE SALES

FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING WE  
ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN THE

ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN THE

TRANSPORTATION PLAN OR IN DAY   
TO ZERO.

02:21:29.856 --> 02:21:30.655
TO ZERO.                        
AND SO I WOULD ACTUALLY PREFER  
TO USE ONE OF THOSE MAPS EVEN   

02:21:30.657 --> 02:21:31.256
AND SO I WOULD ACTUALLY PREFER  
TO USE ONE OF THOSE MAPS EVEN   
IF WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IS THE    

02:21:31.258 --> 02:21:32.056
TO USE ONE OF THOSE MAPS EVEN   
IF WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IS THE

02:21:33.126 --> 02:21:34.058
THAT'S FINE.                    
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ONE      
OF THE REASONS WE DID A NEW MAP 

02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:34.659
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ONE      
OF THE REASONS WE DID A NEW MAP 
SOME OF THOSE OTHER MAPS        

02:21:34.661 --> 02:21:35.460
OF THE REASONS WE DID A NEW MAP 
SOME OF THOSE OTHER MAPS        
AGGREGATED THINGS THAT IS IF    

02:21:35.462 --> 02:21:36.060
SOME OF THOSE OTHER MAPS        
AGGREGATED THINGS THAT IS IF    
THERE WAS A SCHOOL OR A         

02:21:36.062 --> 02:21:37.662
AGGREGATED THINGS THAT IS IF    
THERE WAS A SCHOOL OR A         
SHOPPING CENTER OR A SERVICE,   

02:21:37.664 --> 02:21:40.365
THERE WAS A SCHOOL OR A         
SHOPPING CENTER OR A SERVICE,   
IT WAS DEEMED TO BE A 15 MINUTE 

02:21:40.367 --> 02:21:41.232
SHOPPING CENTER OR A SERVICE,   
IT WAS DEEMED TO BE A 15 MINUTE 
OR 20 MINUTE NEIGHBORHOOD.      

02:21:41.234 --> 02:21:44.568
IT WAS DEEMED TO BE A 15 MINUTE 
OR 20 MINUTE NEIGHBORHOOD.      
THIS IS THAT WHAT ARE THE AREAS 

02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:45.303
OR 20 MINUTE NEIGHBORHOOD.      
THIS IS THAT WHAT ARE THE AREAS 
THAT HAVE EVERYTHING WITHIN     

02:21:45.305 --> 02:21:45.703
THIS IS THAT WHAT ARE THE AREAS 
THAT HAVE EVERYTHING WITHIN

THAT HAVE EVERYTHING WITHIN     
WALKABILITY?                    
SO THAT'S WHERE THE MAP IS      

02:21:48.674 --> 02:21:49.007

SO THAT'S WHERE THE MAP IS      
DISTINCT.

IT MAY NOT BE EXPLAINED THAT    

02:21:50.009 --> 02:21:53.377

02:43:06.051 --> 02:43:09.919
I GUESS THAT'S A QUESTION       
BECAUSE I DIDN'T DON'T KNOW     
ENOUGH ABOUT IF THEY ARE        

02:43:09.921 --> 02:43:13.624
BECAUSE I DIDN'T DON'T KNOW     
ENOUGH ABOUT IF THEY ARE        
RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE FOR     

02:43:13.626 --> 02:43:17.060
ENOUGH ABOUT IF THEY ARE        
RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE FOR     
EXAMPLE, THEY ARE WHAT THAT     

02:43:17.062 --> 02:43:21.798
RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE FOR     
EXAMPLE, THEY ARE WHAT THAT     
MEANS THAT UM FOR HOW THAT      

02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:25.035
EXAMPLE, THEY ARE WHAT THAT     
MEANS THAT UM FOR HOW THAT      
INTERSECTS WITH OUR ZONING SO   

02:43:25.037 --> 02:43:26.202
MEANS THAT UM FOR HOW THAT      
INTERSECTS WITH OUR ZONING SO   
JUST AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL WE    

02:43:26.204 --> 02:43:29.106
INTERSECTS WITH OUR ZONING SO   
JUST AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL WE    
HAVE FIFTEEN HISTORIC DISTRICTS 

02:43:29.108 --> 02:43:32.408
JUST AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL WE    
HAVE FIFTEEN HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
THAT REQUIRE EXTERIOR CHANGES   

02:43:32.410 --> 02:43:33.076
HAVE FIFTEEN HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
THAT REQUIRE EXTERIOR CHANGES   
BROADLY THERE ARE SOME          

02:43:33.078 --> 02:43:36.679
THAT REQUIRE EXTERIOR CHANGES   
BROADLY THERE ARE SOME          
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT THAT HAVE TO 

02:43:36.681 --> 02:43:40.450
BROADLY THERE ARE SOME          
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT THAT HAVE TO 
BE APPROVED FOR FIDELITY TO THE 

02:43:40.452 --> 02:43:41.651
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT THAT HAVE TO 
BE APPROVED FOR FIDELITY TO THE 
ERA OF TIME IN WHICH THAT THE

ERA OF TIME IN WHICH THAT THE   
PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANT THAT

THAT PERIOD OF TIME CAN BE

DISTRICT WAS ESTABLISHED IN     
THAT PERIOD OF TIME CAN BE      
DIFFERENT FROM DISTRICTS.       

02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:52.295
THAT PERIOD OF TIME CAN BE      
DIFFERENT FROM DISTRICTS.       
BUT IT IS BY NATURE A BIT       

02:43:52.297 --> 02:43:53.029
DIFFERENT FROM DISTRICTS.       
BUT IT IS BY NATURE A BIT       
OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY   

02:43:53.031 --> 02:43:56.499
BUT IT IS BY NATURE A BIT       
OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY   
FRAMEWORK TO PRESERVE A         

02:43:56.501 --> 02:43:57.234
OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY   
FRAMEWORK TO PRESERVE A         
NEIGHBORHOOD AND AMBER BECAUSE  

02:43:57.236 --> 02:44:00.036
FRAMEWORK TO PRESERVE A         
NEIGHBORHOOD AND AMBER BECAUSE  
WE BECAUSE THE CITY IN THE PAST 

02:44:00.038 --> 02:44:00.904
NEIGHBORHOOD AND AMBER BECAUSE  
WE BECAUSE THE CITY IN THE PAST 
HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE'S     

02:44:00.906 --> 02:44:04.140
WE BECAUSE THE CITY IN THE PAST 
HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE'S     
VALUE IN THAT AND SO ZONING AND 

02:44:04.142 --> 02:44:08.011
HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE'S     
VALUE IN THAT AND SO ZONING AND 
THOSE REGULATIONS CAN COEXIST.  

02:44:08.013 --> 02:44:15.385
VALUE IN THAT AND SO ZONING AND 
THOSE REGULATIONS CAN COEXIST.  
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE DOWNTOWN WE 

02:44:15.387 --> 02:44:16.252
THOSE REGULATIONS CAN COEXIST.  
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE DOWNTOWN WE 
WOULD ALLOW MAYBE ONE HUNDRED   

02:44:16.254 --> 02:44:17.120
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE DOWNTOWN WE 
WOULD ALLOW MAYBE ONE HUNDRED   
AND TWENTY OR ONE HUNDRED AND   

02:44:17.122 --> 02:44:19.923
WOULD ALLOW MAYBE ONE HUNDRED   
AND TWENTY OR ONE HUNDRED AND   
FIFTY FOOT BUILDING WHERE THE   

02:44:19.925 --> 02:44:20.457
AND TWENTY OR ONE HUNDRED AND   
FIFTY FOOT BUILDING WHERE THE   
MICHIGAN THEATER IS.            

02:44:20.459 --> 02:44:22.859
FIFTY FOOT BUILDING WHERE THE   
MICHIGAN THEATER IS.            
HOWEVER, THE HISTORIC DISTRICT  

02:44:22.861 --> 02:44:23.560
MICHIGAN THEATER IS.            
HOWEVER, THE HISTORIC DISTRICT  
REGULATIONS FOR THAT WOULD      

02:44:23.562 --> 02:44:26.729
HOWEVER, THE HISTORIC DISTRICT  
REGULATIONS FOR THAT WOULD      
LIKELY PREVENT A NEW ADDITION   

02:44:26.731 --> 02:44:27.564
REGULATIONS FOR THAT WOULD      
LIKELY PREVENT A NEW ADDITION   
BEING PUT ON TOP OF THAT        

02:44:27.566 --> 02:44:28.231
LIKELY PREVENT A NEW ADDITION   
BEING PUT ON TOP OF THAT        
BUILDING THAT WOULD REALLY      

02:44:28.233 --> 02:44:31.000
BEING PUT ON TOP OF THAT        
BUILDING THAT WOULD REALLY      
COMPROMISE THE HISTORIC         

02:44:31.002 --> 02:44:31.668
BUILDING THAT WOULD REALLY      
COMPROMISE THE HISTORIC         
INTEGRITY OF THAT DISTRICT      

02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:34.704
COMPROMISE THE HISTORIC         
INTEGRITY OF THAT DISTRICT      
BEING ESTABLISHED TRYING TO     

02:44:34.706 --> 02:44:35.472
INTEGRITY OF THAT DISTRICT      
BEING ESTABLISHED TRYING TO     
RECOGNIZE THAT FORM IN ITS      

02:44:35.474 --> 02:44:38.574
BEING ESTABLISHED TRYING TO     
RECOGNIZE THAT FORM IN ITS      
CURRENT STATE.                  

02:44:38.576 --> 02:44:39.476
RECOGNIZE THAT FORM IN ITS      
CURRENT STATE.                  
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE      

02:44:39.478 --> 02:44:40.343
CURRENT STATE.                  
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE      
ZONING MIGHT BE MORE PERMISSIVE 

02:44:40.345 --> 02:44:42.912
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE      
ZONING MIGHT BE MORE PERMISSIVE 
BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE       

02:44:42.914 --> 02:44:43.647
ZONING MIGHT BE MORE PERMISSIVE 
BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE       
HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION    

02:44:43.649 --> 02:44:44.314
BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE       
HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION    
RECOGNIZING THAT A 15 STOREY

HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION    
RECOGNIZING THAT A 15 STOREY    
ADDITION ON TOP OF THAT         

02:44:46.985 --> 02:44:47.750
RECOGNIZING THAT A 15 STOREY    
ADDITION ON TOP OF THAT         
BUILDING WOULD NOT HAVE AN      

02:44:47.752 --> 02:44:49.986
ADDITION ON TOP OF THAT         
BUILDING WOULD NOT HAVE AN      
ADVERSE IMPACT PRESERVING THAT  

02:44:49.988 --> 02:44:50.787
BUILDING WOULD NOT HAVE AN      
ADVERSE IMPACT PRESERVING THAT  
BUILDING IN ITS PERIOD

ADVERSE IMPACT PRESERVING THAT  
BUILDING IN ITS PERIOD          
OF SIGNIFICANCE THOSE TO        

02:44:54.025 --> 02:44:57.894

OF SIGNIFICANCE THOSE TO

APPLY TO THAT PROPERTY.         
>> YEAH.                        
DOES THAT HELP BUILD IT?        

02:45:01.734 --> 02:45:02.398
>> YEAH.                        
DOES THAT HELP BUILD IT?        
>> IT DOES.

DOES THAT HELP BUILD IT?        
>> IT DOES.

AND JUST TO BE CLEAR LIKE WE UM 
I GUESS I DON'T WANT TO GET     
INTO A HISTORIC DISTRICT        

02:45:09.974 --> 02:45:10.640
I GUESS I DON'T WANT TO GET     
INTO A HISTORIC DISTRICT        
CONVERSATION NECESSARILY BUT    

02:45:10.642 --> 02:45:13.376
INTO A HISTORIC DISTRICT        
CONVERSATION NECESSARILY BUT    
LIKE IF IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED   

02:45:13.378 --> 02:45:16.612
CONVERSATION NECESSARILY BUT    
LIKE IF IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED   
CAN IT BE ESTABLISHED AS ONE    

02:45:16.614 --> 02:45:20.883
LIKE IF IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED   
CAN IT BE ESTABLISHED AS ONE    
AND I FELT ON THE ONE HAND IF

CAN IT BE ESTABLISHED AS ONE    
AND I FELT ON THE ONE HAND IF   
THE REALITY IS THE PRESENCE     

02:45:21.687 --> 02:45:23.953
AND I FELT ON THE ONE HAND IF   
THE REALITY IS THE PRESENCE     
OF A HISTORIC DISTRICT MEANS    

02:45:23.955 --> 02:45:24.887
THE REALITY IS THE PRESENCE     
OF A HISTORIC DISTRICT MEANS    
THAT THERE IS LESS LIKELY TO BE 

02:45:24.889 --> 02:45:27.957
OF A HISTORIC DISTRICT MEANS    
THAT THERE IS LESS LIKELY TO BE 
A CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY, I    

02:45:27.959 --> 02:45:28.724
THAT THERE IS LESS LIKELY TO BE 
A CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY, I    
THINK IN SOME WAYS THAT'S       

02:45:28.726 --> 02:45:32.061
A CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY, I    
THINK IN SOME WAYS THAT'S       
IMPORTANT TO SAY AND IF THAT'S  

02:45:32.063 --> 02:45:36.700
THINK IN SOME WAYS THAT'S       
IMPORTANT TO SAY AND IF THAT'S  
ALSO YOU CAN SEE MY YOUR QUOTES 

02:45:36.702 --> 02:45:37.567
IMPORTANT TO SAY AND IF THAT'S  
ALSO YOU CAN SEE MY YOUR QUOTES 
BECAUSE I'M NOT TALKING TO IN   

02:45:37.569 --> 02:45:40.470
ALSO YOU CAN SEE MY YOUR QUOTES 
BECAUSE I'M NOT TALKING TO IN   
REAL IF THAT'S THE WAY THAT YOU 

02:45:40.472 --> 02:45:44.040
BECAUSE I'M NOT TALKING TO IN   
REAL IF THAT'S THE WAY THAT YOU 
DON'T HAVE CHANGE IN YOUR IN    

02:45:44.042 --> 02:45:44.708
REAL IF THAT'S THE WAY THAT YOU 
DON'T HAVE CHANGE IN YOUR IN    
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, I THINK THAT 

02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:46.809
DON'T HAVE CHANGE IN YOUR IN    
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, I THINK THAT 
THAT IS A PERVERSE OUTCOME      

02:45:46.811 --> 02:45:47.477
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, I THINK THAT 
THAT IS A PERVERSE OUTCOME      
OF NEW HISTORIC DISTRICTS BEING 

02:45:47.479 --> 02:45:47.877
THAT IS A PERVERSE OUTCOME      
OF NEW HISTORIC DISTRICTS BEING 
FORMED.                         

02:45:47.879 --> 02:45:51.514
OF NEW HISTORIC DISTRICTS BEING 
FORMED.                         
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS WHAT WE 

02:45:51.516 --> 02:45:52.215
FORMED.                         
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS WHAT WE 
WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE.        

02:45:52.217 --> 02:45:53.115
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS WHAT WE 
WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE.        
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M WEIGHING 

02:45:53.117 --> 02:45:55.352
WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE.        
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M WEIGHING 
IN MY MIND WITH THIS SENTENCE   

02:45:55.354 --> 02:45:59.055
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M WEIGHING 
IN MY MIND WITH THIS SENTENCE   
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BOTH IT'S  

02:45:59.057 --> 02:46:02.225
IN MY MIND WITH THIS SENTENCE   
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BOTH IT'S  
BOTH A REALITY AND LIKE I DON'T

BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BOTH IT'S  
BOTH A REALITY AND LIKE I DON'T 
KNOW HOW YOU WEIGH LIKE HOW YOU

BOTH A REALITY AND LIKE I DON'T 
KNOW HOW YOU WEIGH LIKE HOW YOU 
BALANCE THOSE TWO THINGS.       

02:46:06.664 --> 02:46:09.800
KNOW HOW YOU WEIGH LIKE HOW YOU 
BALANCE THOSE TWO THINGS.       
>> I I THINK THERE IS A BALANCE

BALANCE THOSE TWO THINGS.       
>> I I THINK THERE IS A BALANCE 
TO TRY TO GET SOME SORT

OF WHERE THE MIND OF THE        
COMMISSION IS.                  

02:46:13.838 --> 02:46:14.671
OF WHERE THE MIND OF THE        
COMMISSION IS.                  
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE    

02:46:14.673 --> 02:46:15.271
COMMISSION IS.                  
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE    
THE CITY IS RIGHT NOW.

THE CITY IS RIGHT NOW.          
RIGHT.                          
AS WE WOULD THE WAY WE'VE

RIGHT.                          
AS WE WOULD THE WAY WE'VE       
TALKED ABOUT IN THIS PLAN IS WE 

02:46:18.276 --> 02:46:20.777
AS WE WOULD THE WAY WE'VE       
TALKED ABOUT IN THIS PLAN IS WE 
WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESERVE 15

TALKED ABOUT IN THIS PLAN IS WE 
WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESERVE 15

IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF KIND

OF A CITY STANCE ON IT RIGHT    
NOW.

WHAT DOES THAT PROCESS I'M NOT

EXPERT ON THAT AND MY           
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS     
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE     

02:47:03.722 --> 02:47:07.557
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS     
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE     
PART OF PART OF THE LEAD UP TO  

02:47:07.559 --> 02:47:08.291
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE     
PART OF PART OF THE LEAD UP TO  
CREATING IT IS RECOGNIZING THAT 

02:47:08.293 --> 02:47:10.760
PART OF PART OF THE LEAD UP TO  
CREATING IT IS RECOGNIZING THAT 
THERE'S A PUBLIC PURPOSE VALUE

I THINK MR. LEONARD WAS BEING   

02:47:58.410 --> 02:48:00.610
MAY BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.       
I THINK MR. LEONARD WAS BEING   
KIND WHEN HE SAID DIFFICULT TO  

02:48:00.612 --> 02:48:04.113
I THINK MR. LEONARD WAS BEING   
KIND WHEN HE SAID DIFFICULT TO  
UNWIND A HISTORIC DISTRICT      

02:48:04.115 --> 02:48:05.214
KIND WHEN HE SAID DIFFICULT TO  
UNWIND A HISTORIC DISTRICT      
BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF THE      

02:48:05.216 --> 02:48:05.781
UNWIND A HISTORIC DISTRICT      
BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF THE      
MEMBERS OF THE HISTORIC         

02:48:05.783 --> 02:48:08.051
BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF THE      
MEMBERS OF THE HISTORIC         
DISTRICT HAVE TO AGREE THAT IT

SO THERE'S AT LEAST THREE       

02:48:12.958 --> 02:48:15.257
APPROVED BY THE STATE.          
SO THERE'S AT LEAST THREE       
STAGES WHERE WHERE THAT CAN RUN 

02:48:15.259 --> 02:48:15.825
SO THERE'S AT LEAST THREE

THAT.                           
I UNDERSTAND IF THE STRATEGY IS 
TO DIVERSIFY THE HOUSING TYPE,  

03:00:58.689 --> 03:01:02.224
I UNDERSTAND IF THE STRATEGY IS 
TO DIVERSIFY THE HOUSING TYPE,  
THE FIRST PRIORITY IS DUPLEXES  

03:01:02.226 --> 03:01:02.958
TO DIVERSIFY THE HOUSING TYPE,  
THE FIRST PRIORITY IS DUPLEXES  
,PROPERTIES, COMPLEXES,

AND THE SECOND PART IS MORE     
ACCESSIBLE HOUSING.             

03:01:10.267 --> 03:01:11.333
AND THE SECOND PART IS MORE     
ACCESSIBLE HOUSING.             
BOTH OF THOSE WILL ACHIEVE MORE 

03:01:11.335 --> 03:01:14.269
ACCESSIBLE HOUSING.             
BOTH OF THOSE WILL ACHIEVE MORE 
DIVERSITY IN HOUSING TYPE I     

03:01:14.271 --> 03:01:14.870
BOTH OF THOSE WILL ACHIEVE MORE 
DIVERSITY IN HOUSING TYPE I     
DON'T KNOW HOW YEAH.            

03:01:14.872 --> 03:01:15.905
DIVERSITY IN HOUSING TYPE I     
DON'T KNOW HOW YEAH.            
SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT    

03:01:15.907 --> 03:01:18.374
DON'T KNOW HOW YEAH.            
SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT    
THE STRATEGY OF VINCENT IS      

03:01:18.376 --> 03:01:18.707
SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT    
THE STRATEGY OF VINCENT IS

LIKE.                           
I GUESS THAT MEANS              
INCENTIVIZING DEVELOPERS TO

I GUESS THAT MEANS

BUILD DIFFERENT KINDS           

03:01:22.079 --> 03:01:22.511
INCENTIVIZING DEVELOPERS TO     
BUILD DIFFERENT KINDS           
OF HOUSING.                     

03:01:22.513 --> 03:01:26.581
BUILD DIFFERENT KINDS           
OF HOUSING.                     
UM I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.  

03:01:26.583 --> 03:01:29.652
OF HOUSING.                     
UM I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.  
WE TALKED ABOUT ZONING IS JUST  

03:01:29.654 --> 03:01:33.122
UM I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.  
WE TALKED ABOUT ZONING IS JUST  
ONE PIECE OF A MYRIAD           

03:01:33.124 --> 03:01:33.856
WE TALKED ABOUT ZONING IS JUST  
ONE PIECE OF A MYRIAD           
OF INFLUENCES THAT BUILDING     

03:01:33.858 --> 03:01:34.523
ONE PIECE OF A MYRIAD           
OF INFLUENCES THAT BUILDING     
HOUSING BEING BUILT OR NOT      

03:01:34.525 --> 03:01:37.860
OF INFLUENCES THAT BUILDING     
HOUSING BEING BUILT OR NOT      
BEING CAPACITY IS GOING TO BE   

03:01:37.862 --> 03:01:38.326
HOUSING BEING BUILT OR NOT      
BEING CAPACITY IS GOING TO BE   
ONE OF THEM.                    

03:01:38.328 --> 03:01:39.261
BEING CAPACITY IS GOING TO BE   
ONE OF THEM.                    
WE COULD SIT HERE AND HOPE THAT 

03:01:39.263 --> 03:01:40.695
ONE OF THEM.                    
WE COULD SIT HERE AND HOPE THAT 
WE'RE GOING TO QUADRUPLE OUR    

03:01:40.697 --> 03:01:44.500
WE COULD SIT HERE AND HOPE THAT 
WE'RE GOING TO QUADRUPLE OUR    
ANNUAL HOUSING SUPPLY THAT      

03:01:44.502 --> 03:01:45.400
WE'RE GOING TO QUADRUPLE OUR    
ANNUAL HOUSING SUPPLY THAT      
WON'T BECOME A REALITY WITHOUT  

03:01:45.402 --> 03:01:46.034
ANNUAL HOUSING SUPPLY THAT      
WON'T BECOME A REALITY WITHOUT  
A LOT OF OTHER SUPPORT.         

03:01:46.036 --> 03:01:48.871
WON'T BECOME A REALITY WITHOUT  
A LOT OF OTHER SUPPORT.         
SO I THINK THIS IS SPECIFICALLY 

03:01:48.873 --> 03:01:49.604
A LOT OF OTHER SUPPORT.         
SO I THINK THIS IS SPECIFICALLY 
TRYING TO GET TO RECOGNIZING    

03:01:49.606 --> 03:01:53.074
SO I THINK THIS IS SPECIFICALLY 
TRYING TO GET TO RECOGNIZING    
THAT YEAH, I WE WANT TO BE MORE 

03:01:53.076 --> 03:01:53.809
TRYING TO GET TO RECOGNIZING    
THAT YEAH, I WE WANT TO BE MORE 
SPECIFIC BECAUSE I THINK THAT   

03:01:53.811 --> 03:01:56.345
THAT YEAH, I WE WANT TO BE MORE 
SPECIFIC BECAUSE I THINK THAT   
THE STRATEGY FOR DIVERSIFYING   

03:01:56.347 --> 03:01:57.513
SPECIFIC BECAUSE I THINK THAT   
THE STRATEGY FOR DIVERSIFYING   
MIGHT BE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY. 

03:01:57.515 --> 03:01:57.980
THE STRATEGY FOR DIVERSIFYING   
MIGHT BE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY. 
IT'S A GOOD PLAN.               

03:01:57.982 --> 03:02:01.050
MIGHT BE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY. 
IT'S A GOOD PLAN.               
I HAVE PLANS TO PLANT WHAT IT   

03:02:01.052 --> 03:02:01.917
IT'S A GOOD PLAN.               
I HAVE PLANS TO PLANT WHAT IT   
IS BECAUSE I HAVE A CONCEPT     

03:02:01.919 --> 03:02:03.519
I HAVE PLANS TO PLANT WHAT IT   
IS BECAUSE I HAVE A CONCEPT     
OF A PLAN.                      

03:02:03.521 --> 03:02:04.653
IS BECAUSE I HAVE A CONCEPT     
OF A PLAN.                      
I THINK IT COULD MAYBE JUST SAY 

03:02:04.655 --> 03:02:08.157
OF A PLAN.                      
I THINK IT COULD MAYBE JUST SAY 
THE CITY NEEDS TO INCENTIVIZE   

03:02:08.159 --> 03:02:08.758
I THINK IT COULD MAYBE JUST SAY 
THE CITY NEEDS TO INCENTIVIZE   
DEVELOPERS AND CONTRACTORS      

03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:09.491
THE CITY NEEDS TO INCENTIVIZE   
DEVELOPERS AND CONTRACTORS      
NEEDS TO BUILD CAPACITY AND

TAKEAWAY BECAUSE WHAT WE        
PROBABLY WON'T GET INTO HERE IS 

03:02:20.504 --> 03:02:23.773
TAKEAWAY BECAUSE WHAT WE        
PROBABLY WON'T GET INTO HERE IS 
WHAT DOES INCENTIVES SHOULD BE

SENSE TO BUILD NEW ONES.        
ALEPPO'S GO.

ALEPPO'S GO.                    
SO I THINK JUST KIND OF LIKE A  
BLANKET ASSUMPTION THAT WE      

03:04:51.188 --> 03:04:52.053
SO I THINK JUST KIND OF LIKE A  
BLANKET ASSUMPTION THAT WE      
SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESERVING THE 

03:04:52.055 --> 03:04:55.490
BLANKET ASSUMPTION THAT WE      
SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESERVING THE 
EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS AND I 

03:04:55.492 --> 03:04:56.225
SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESERVING THE 
EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS AND I 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER THOSE ARE    

03:04:56.227 --> 03:04:59.794
EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS AND I 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER THOSE ARE

OTHER ONES.                     
SO I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING    
ABOUT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN

RIGHT HERE BECAUSE THAT'S       
EXACTLY RIGHT.                  
MAKING SURE THAT WE BUY THOSE   

03:11:26.783 --> 03:11:27.649
EXACTLY RIGHT.                  
MAKING SURE THAT WE BUY THOSE   
AND KEEP THEM AFFORDABLE WHEN   

03:11:27.651 --> 03:11:30.885
MAKING SURE THAT WE BUY THOSE   
AND KEEP THEM AFFORDABLE WHEN   
WE CAN DO THAT IS VERY CRUCIAL  

03:11:30.887 --> 03:11:31.419
AND KEEP THEM AFFORDABLE WHEN   
WE CAN DO THAT IS VERY CRUCIAL  
FOR AFFORDABILITY.

WE CAN DO THAT IS VERY CRUCIAL  
FOR AFFORDABILITY.              
BUT IT THAT THE THE EMBODIED    

03:11:35.058 --> 03:11:35.824
FOR AFFORDABILITY.              
BUT IT THAT THE THE EMBODIED    
CARBON POINT IS A POINT THAT    

03:11:35.826 --> 03:11:39.427
BUT IT THAT THE THE EMBODIED    
CARBON POINT IS A POINT THAT    
ONE WOULD THAT IS NOT SPECIFIC

CARBON POINT IS A POINT THAT

POINT FOR YOU YOU DON'T JUST    
TALK ABOUT EXISTING CAPITAL, A

POINT FOR YOU YOU DON'T JUST    
TALK ABOUT EXISTING CAPITAL, A  
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.       
YOU TALK IT TALKS ABOUT         
PRESERVING NATURALLY OCCURRING

YOU TALK IT TALKS ABOUT         
PRESERVING NATURALLY OCCURRING  
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH FEELS  

03:12:44.561 --> 03:12:45.293
PRESERVING NATURALLY OCCURRING  
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH FEELS  
LIKE IF WE WANT TO DO THOSE     

03:12:45.295 --> 03:12:51.533
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH FEELS  
LIKE IF WE WANT TO DO THOSE     
THINGS, THOSE THINGS

TOGETHER.                       
AND SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF WE 
CUT OUT EMBODYING CARBON FROM   

03:13:07.384 --> 03:13:08.182
AND SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF WE 
CUT OUT EMBODYING CARBON FROM   
NO ONE POINT THREE, THEN WHAT   

03:13:08.184 --> 03:13:08.917
CUT OUT EMBODYING CARBON FROM   
NO ONE POINT THREE, THEN WHAT   
ARE WE ACTUALLY SAYING IN ONE   

03:13:08.919 --> 03:13:09.584
NO ONE POINT THREE, THEN WHAT   
ARE WE ACTUALLY SAYING IN ONE   
POINT THREE THAT WE'RE NOT      

03:13:09.586 --> 03:13:10.318
ARE WE ACTUALLY SAYING IN ONE   
POINT THREE THAT WE'RE NOT      
SAYING IN ONE POINT FOUR AND    

03:13:10.320 --> 03:13:11.052
POINT THREE THAT WE'RE NOT      
SAYING IN ONE POINT FOUR AND    
THEN MAYBE WE COMBINE I JUST    

03:13:11.054 --> 03:13:11.720
SAYING IN ONE POINT FOUR AND    
THEN MAYBE WE COMBINE I JUST    
WOULD NOT WANT US TO I'M        

03:13:11.722 --> 03:13:12.287
THEN MAYBE WE COMBINE I JUST    
WOULD NOT WANT US TO I'M        
NERVOUS ABOUT THE NATURALLY     

03:13:12.289 --> 03:13:13.087
WOULD NOT WANT US TO I'M        
NERVOUS ABOUT THE NATURALLY     
OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.   

03:13:13.089 --> 03:13:13.822
NERVOUS ABOUT THE NATURALLY     
OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.   
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT IT      

03:13:13.824 --> 03:13:14.089
OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.   
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT IT      
EXISTS.                         

03:13:14.091 --> 03:13:14.822
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT IT      
EXISTS.                         
I BUY THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT BUT   

03:13:14.824 --> 03:13:15.557
EXISTS.                         
I BUY THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT BUT   
IT'S A IT'S PART OF A WHOLE     

03:13:15.559 --> 03:13:16.224
I BUY THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT BUT   
IT'S A IT'S PART OF A WHOLE     
SEPARATE THEORY OF HOW HOUSING  

03:13:16.226 --> 03:13:16.958
IT'S A IT'S PART OF A WHOLE     
SEPARATE THEORY OF HOW HOUSING  
BECOMES AFFORDABLE, WHICH IS    

03:13:16.960 --> 03:13:18.760
SEPARATE THEORY OF HOW HOUSING  
BECOMES AFFORDABLE, WHICH IS    
MARKET RATE HOUSING BECOMING    

03:13:18.762 --> 03:13:19.627
BECOMES AFFORDABLE, WHICH IS    
MARKET RATE HOUSING BECOMING    
MORE AFFORDABLE AS IT AGES,     

03:13:19.629 --> 03:13:20.561
MARKET RATE HOUSING BECOMING    
MORE AFFORDABLE AS IT AGES,     
WHICH IS A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT   

03:13:20.563 --> 03:13:22.797
MORE AFFORDABLE AS IT AGES,     
WHICH IS A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT   
THAN ARGUMENT THEN THAT WE NEED 

03:13:22.799 --> 03:13:26.033
WHICH IS A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT   
THAN ARGUMENT THEN THAT WE NEED 
TO BUY EXISTING INCOME          

03:13:26.035 --> 03:13:26.802
THAN ARGUMENT THEN THAT WE NEED 
TO BUY EXISTING INCOME          
QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE USER UNITS 

03:13:26.804 --> 03:13:30.938
TO BUY EXISTING INCOME          
QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE USER UNITS 
SO IF THERE'S A LOT MATCHED IN  

03:13:30.940 --> 03:13:34.643
QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE USER UNITS 
SO IF THERE'S A LOT MATCHED IN  
HERE AND I'M NOT CLEAR WHAT THE

SO IF THERE'S A LOT MATCHED IN

NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE  
HOUSING IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO      
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO SAY  

03:13:46.489 --> 03:13:49.757
HOUSING IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO      
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO SAY  
NO BUT WE NEED TO REALLY DEFINE

OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO SAY  
NO BUT WE NEED TO REALLY DEFINE 
THAT AND NOT JUST IN A GLOSSARY

APPLICATIONS FOR THIS FALL'S    
ENROLLMENT.                     
I KEEP MY THOUGHT GOING.

SURE.                           

04:26:23.943 --> 04:26:26.977
I KEEP MY THOUGHT GOING.        
SURE.                           
THE STRATEGY THAT WE KIND       

04:26:26.979 --> 04:26:27.678
SURE.                           
THE STRATEGY THAT WE KIND       
OF ARE TAKING I THINK WE NEED   

04:26:27.680 --> 04:26:30.915
THE STRATEGY THAT WE KIND       
OF ARE TAKING I THINK WE NEED   
TO SET ASIDE SOME DISTRICTS TO  

04:26:30.917 --> 04:26:31.715
OF ARE TAKING I THINK WE NEED   
TO SET ASIDE SOME DISTRICTS TO  
ALLOW BUSINESSES TO DIVERSIFY   

04:26:31.717 --> 04:26:34.251
TO SET ASIDE SOME DISTRICTS TO  
ALLOW BUSINESSES TO DIVERSIFY   
THE TAX BASE AND WE'LL LET SOME 

04:26:34.253 --> 04:26:34.985
ALLOW BUSINESSES TO DIVERSIFY   
THE TAX BASE AND WE'LL LET SOME 
HOUSING HAPPEN WITHIN THEM.     

04:26:34.987 --> 04:26:38.388
THE TAX BASE AND WE'LL LET SOME 
HOUSING HAPPEN WITHIN THEM.     
BUT GOING TO THIS IS GOING TO   

04:26:38.390 --> 04:26:38.922
HOUSING HAPPEN WITHIN THEM.     
BUT GOING TO THIS IS GOING TO   
MR. LEE'S COMMENTS.             

04:26:38.924 --> 04:26:41.858
BUT GOING TO THIS IS GOING TO   
MR. LEE'S COMMENTS.             
BUT WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE   

04:26:41.860 --> 04:26:42.626
MR. LEE'S COMMENTS.             
BUT WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE   
NUISANCE STANDARDS TO MAKE THEM

THAT NOT POSSIBLE?              
THAT'S LIMITED I THINK AT THE   

04:27:10.089 --> 04:27:12.690
THAT NOT POSSIBLE?              
THAT'S LIMITED I THINK AT THE   
SCALE I THINK THE ISSUE FOR ME  

04:27:12.692 --> 04:27:16.593
THAT'S LIMITED I THINK AT THE   
SCALE I THINK THE ISSUE FOR ME  
IS THE SCALE 94000 JOBS LIKE    

04:27:16.595 --> 04:27:16.927
SCALE I THINK THE ISSUE FOR ME  
IS THE SCALE 94000 JOBS LIKE    
THAT.

IS THE SCALE 94000 JOBS LIKE    
THAT.                           
THE CONSULTANTS GAVE US A       

04:27:17.930 --> 04:27:20.331
THAT.                           
THE CONSULTANTS GAVE US A       
NUMBER EIGHTY THOUSAND WE DON'T 

04:27:20.333 --> 04:27:23.601
THE CONSULTANTS GAVE US A       
NUMBER EIGHTY THOUSAND WE DON'T 
HAVE ENOUGH RESIDENTS IN THE

NUMBER EIGHTY THOUSAND WE DON'T 
HAVE ENOUGH RESIDENTS IN THE    
CITY TO FILL THE JOBS THAT ARE

HAVE ENOUGH RESIDENTS IN THE    
CITY TO FILL THE JOBS THAT ARE

04:33:01.407 --> 04:33:02.338
OF STRATEGIES TO INCREASE

BUT I'M ACTUALLY ONE OF THE     

04:33:02.340 --> 04:33:05.041

BUT I'M ACTUALLY ONE OF THE     
CONCERNS THAT I HAD IS THAT     

04:33:05.043 --> 04:33:05.775
BUT I'M ACTUALLY ONE OF THE     
CONCERNS THAT I HAD IS THAT     
I'VE SEEN SOME REDUNDANCY       

04:33:05.777 --> 04:33:09.412
CONCERNS THAT I HAD IS THAT     
I'VE SEEN SOME REDUNDANCY       
BETWEEN GOAL NUMBER FOUR ABOUT  

04:33:09.414 --> 04:33:13.283
I'VE SEEN SOME REDUNDANCY       
BETWEEN GOAL NUMBER FOUR ABOUT  
LIKE WHICH IS RETAIL IN

BETWEEN GOAL NUMBER FOUR ABOUT  
LIKE WHICH IS RETAIL IN

SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN.      
SO I WONDER IF LIKE THE FIRST

04:33:52.624 --> 04:33:53.423
MIGHT BE A LITTLE I MEAN        
HOPEFULLY IT'S MORE BALANCED    
BUT WE BOTH WANTED TO SWING THE 

04:33:53.425 --> 04:33:55.425
HOPEFULLY IT'S MORE BALANCED    
BUT WE BOTH WANTED TO SWING THE 
OTHER WAY EITHER THAT'S NOT

SIX BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF     
THAT IF THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT

YEAH.                           
I MEAN IT'S THE GOOD NEWS IS    
IT'S SUPER EASY TO LOSE CAR

IT'S SUPER EASY TO LOSE CAR     
RENTAL HOUSING NAME YOUR USE    

04:38:46.451 --> 04:38:50.453
IT'S SUPER EASY TO LOSE CAR     
RENTAL HOUSING NAME YOUR USE    
ALL IN THE SAME DISTRICT.       

04:38:50.455 --> 04:38:51.188
RENTAL HOUSING NAME YOUR USE    
ALL IN THE SAME DISTRICT.

>> THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY EASY  
TO DO.                          
THE CHALLENGE IS THAT DOWNTOWN  

04:38:54.326 --> 04:38:55.091
TO DO.                          
THE CHALLENGE IS THAT DOWNTOWN  
CAR RENTAL DOESN'T MEET THE     

04:38:55.093 --> 04:39:00.964
THE CHALLENGE IS THAT DOWNTOWN  
CAR RENTAL DOESN'T MEET THE     
EASY ON PARKING MAXIMUM SO IT'S 

04:39:00.966 --> 04:39:01.631
CAR RENTAL DOESN'T MEET THE     
EASY ON PARKING MAXIMUM SO IT'S 
EASY TO IDENTIFY USERS BUT      

04:39:01.633 --> 04:39:05.368
EASY ON PARKING MAXIMUM SO IT'S 
EASY TO IDENTIFY USERS BUT      
THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE IF YOU  

04:39:05.370 --> 04:39:06.335
EASY TO IDENTIFY USERS BUT      
THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE IF YOU  
IT'S EASY TO LIST THAT USE BUT  

04:39:06.337 --> 04:39:09.606
THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE IF YOU  
IT'S EASY TO LIST THAT USE BUT  
UNLESS UNLESS YOU MAKE IT AS WE 

04:39:09.608 --> 04:39:10.540
IT'S EASY TO LIST THAT USE BUT  
UNLESS UNLESS YOU MAKE IT AS WE 
SAY IT HAS TO BE THE TORONTO

UNLESS UNLESS YOU MAKE IT AS WE 
SAY IT HAS TO BE THE TORONTO    
MODEL WHERE ALL THOSE CARS ARE

GOING TO FUNDAMENTALLY LIMIT    
THE ABILITY FOR THAT TO BE

THE ABILITY FOR THAT TO BE

04:39:29.061 --> 04:39:29.325
PLEA FOR KEEPING IN AND         
DEVELOPING THIS CIRCULAR        
ECONOMY?

DEVELOPING THIS CIRCULAR

IT BECAUSE NO, I DON'T THINK I

I THINK IT I THINK IT'S BEEN

DID IT.                         
I THINK IT I THINK IT'S BEEN    
PROBABLY LOBBIED FOR BY OSSI    

04:39:40.171 --> 04:39:42.605
I THINK IT I THINK IT'S BEEN    
PROBABLY LOBBIED FOR BY OSSI    
BECAUSE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY    

04:39:42.607 --> 04:39:43.639
PROBABLY LOBBIED FOR BY OSSI    
BECAUSE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY    
STRATEGY IS A WEIRD PART OF THE 

04:39:43.641 --> 04:39:46.575
BECAUSE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY    
STRATEGY IS A WEIRD PART OF THE 
OSSI THING BECAUSE IT'S NOT     

04:39:46.577 --> 04:39:47.277
STRATEGY IS A WEIRD PART OF THE 
OSSI THING BECAUSE IT'S NOT     
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN BUY      

04:39:47.279 --> 04:39:50.814
OSSI THING BECAUSE IT'S NOT     
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN BUY      
SOLAR PANELS OR YOU KNOW IT IT  

04:39:50.816 --> 04:39:54.384
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN BUY      
SOLAR PANELS OR YOU KNOW IT IT  
ACTUALLY AND SO THERE'S THIS    

04:39:54.386 --> 04:39:55.185
SOLAR PANELS OR YOU KNOW IT IT  
ACTUALLY AND SO THERE'S THIS    
THING IN HERE THIS LITTLE GREEN 

04:39:55.187 --> 04:39:58.388
ACTUALLY AND SO THERE'S THIS    
THING IN HERE THIS LITTLE GREEN 
BOX LAND IS ESSENTIAL TO        

04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:59.188
THING IN HERE THIS LITTLE GREEN 
BOX LAND IS ESSENTIAL TO        
TRANSITION FROM A LINEAR MODEL  

04:39:59.190 --> 04:40:01.924
BOX LAND IS ESSENTIAL TO        
TRANSITION FROM A LINEAR MODEL  
TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY.          

04:40:01.926 --> 04:40:05.094
TRANSITION FROM A LINEAR MODEL  
TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY.          
I I UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK THAT 

04:40:05.096 --> 04:40:05.961
TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY.          
I I UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK THAT 
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THAT    

04:40:05.963 --> 04:40:08.931
I I UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK THAT 
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THAT    
BECAUSE THE LINEAR MODEL IS WE  

04:40:08.933 --> 04:40:13.369
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THAT    
BECAUSE THE LINEAR MODEL IS WE  
OUTSOURCE OUR TRASH DISPOSAL TO

BECAUSE THE LINEAR MODEL IS WE  
OUTSOURCE OUR TRASH DISPOSAL TO 
PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE NEXT COUNTY 

04:40:17.409 --> 04:40:18.074
OUTSOURCE OUR TRASH DISPOSAL TO 
PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE NEXT COUNTY 
OVER BASICALLY I THINK IT'S     

04:40:18.076 --> 04:40:21.143
PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE NEXT COUNTY 
OVER BASICALLY I THINK IT'S     
GOING TO YEAH.                  

04:40:21.145 --> 04:40:25.649
OVER BASICALLY I THINK IT'S     
GOING TO YEAH.                  
AND UM AND SO THE FIRST OF ALL  

04:40:25.651 --> 04:40:28.718
GOING TO YEAH.                  
AND UM AND SO THE FIRST OF ALL  
IT'S NOT JUST AND SECOND OF ALL 

04:40:28.720 --> 04:40:32.188
AND UM AND SO THE FIRST OF ALL  
IT'S NOT JUST AND SECOND OF ALL 
IT'S NOT IT IT MEANS THAT WE'RE 

04:40:32.190 --> 04:40:32.922
IT'S NOT JUST AND SECOND OF ALL 
IT'S NOT IT IT MEANS THAT WE'RE 
IMPLICATED IN VEHICLES MILES    

04:40:32.924 --> 04:40:33.656
IT'S NOT IT IT MEANS THAT WE'RE 
IMPLICATED IN VEHICLES MILES    
TRAVELED BECAUSE WE'RE SENDING  

04:40:33.658 --> 04:40:36.459
IMPLICATED IN VEHICLES MILES    
TRAVELED BECAUSE WE'RE SENDING  
THAT STUFF OUT THERE AND THE    

04:40:36.461 --> 04:40:37.160
TRAVELED BECAUSE WE'RE SENDING  
THAT STUFF OUT THERE AND THE    
CIRCULAR ECONOMY IDEA IS THAT   

04:40:37.162 --> 04:40:40.563
THAT STUFF OUT THERE AND THE    
CIRCULAR ECONOMY IDEA IS THAT   
YOU CAPTURE VALUE FROM THINGS   

04:40:40.565 --> 04:40:41.297
CIRCULAR ECONOMY IDEA IS THAT   
YOU CAPTURE VALUE FROM THINGS   
THAT SHOULDN'T BE LANDFILLED    

04:40:41.299 --> 04:40:44.533
YOU CAPTURE VALUE FROM THINGS   
THAT SHOULDN'T BE LANDFILLED    
YET AND IN ORDER TO CAPTURE     

04:40:44.535 --> 04:40:45.201
THAT SHOULDN'T BE LANDFILLED    
YET AND IN ORDER TO CAPTURE     
THAT VALUE YOU NEED PLACES TO   

04:40:45.203 --> 04:40:48.271
YET AND IN ORDER TO CAPTURE     
THAT VALUE YOU NEED PLACES TO   
WORK ON THOSE THINGS.           

04:40:48.273 --> 04:40:49.605
THAT VALUE YOU NEED PLACES TO   
WORK ON THOSE THINGS.           
AND SO IT GOES ALONG I THINK    

04:40:49.607 --> 04:40:52.141
WORK ON THOSE THINGS.           
AND SO IT GOES ALONG I THINK    
WITH ONE WITH WHAT YOU WERE     

04:40:52.143 --> 04:40:52.876
AND SO IT GOES ALONG I THINK    
WITH ONE WITH WHAT YOU WERE     
SAYING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT USING  

04:40:52.878 --> 04:40:55.578
WITH ONE WITH WHAT YOU WERE     
SAYING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT USING  
TITLES TONIGHT THAT YOU KNOW    

04:40:55.580 --> 04:40:59.316
SAYING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT USING  
TITLES TONIGHT THAT YOU KNOW    
THAT THE SPACE FOR THE EXAMPLE  

04:40:59.318 --> 04:41:00.116
TITLES TONIGHT THAT YOU KNOW    
THAT THE SPACE FOR THE EXAMPLE  
THAT'S LISTED HERE IS SOMETHING 

04:41:00.118 --> 04:41:01.083
THAT THE SPACE FOR THE EXAMPLE  
THAT'S LISTED HERE IS SOMETHING 
THAT WE HEARD A LOT FROM WHEN   

04:41:01.085 --> 04:41:03.119
THAT'S LISTED HERE IS SOMETHING 
THAT WE HEARD A LOT FROM WHEN   
WE WERE WORKING ON THE STRATEGY 

04:41:03.121 --> 04:41:03.753
THAT WE HEARD A LOT FROM WHEN   
WE WERE WORKING ON THE STRATEGY 
FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY WAS WE     

04:41:03.755 --> 04:41:07.022
WE WERE WORKING ON THE STRATEGY 
FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY WAS WE     
COULD HAVE MORE THRIFT STORES   

04:41:07.024 --> 04:41:07.823
FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY WAS WE     
COULD HAVE MORE THRIFT STORES   
AND MORE STUFF IN THRIFT STORES 

04:41:07.825 --> 04:41:10.693
COULD HAVE MORE THRIFT STORES   
AND MORE STUFF IN THRIFT STORES 
IN ANN ARBOR IF WE HAD PLACES   

04:41:10.695 --> 04:41:14.331
AND MORE STUFF IN THRIFT STORES 
IN ANN ARBOR IF WE HAD PLACES   
TO WAREHOUSE FURNITURE AND MORE 

04:41:14.333 --> 04:41:17.433
IN ANN ARBOR IF WE HAD PLACES   
TO WAREHOUSE FURNITURE AND MORE 
STUFF THAN WHAT THEY HAVE AT    

04:41:17.435 --> 04:41:18.467
TO WAREHOUSE FURNITURE AND MORE 
STUFF THAN WHAT THEY HAVE AT    
THE AT THE THRIFT STORES, THEY  

04:41:18.469 --> 04:41:21.303
STUFF THAN WHAT THEY HAVE AT    
THE AT THE THRIFT STORES, THEY  
JUST CAN'T EVEN KEEP ALL THE    

04:41:21.305 --> 04:41:22.238
THE AT THE THRIFT STORES, THEY  
JUST CAN'T EVEN KEEP ALL THE    
AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT THEY GET.  

04:41:22.240 --> 04:41:23.305
JUST CAN'T EVEN KEEP ALL THE    
AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT THEY GET.  
AND SO THIS IS AND I DON'T      

04:41:23.307 --> 04:41:25.708
AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT THEY GET.  
AND SO THIS IS AND I DON'T      
THINK IT NEEDS 45 THOUSAND      

04:41:25.710 --> 04:41:29.412
AND SO THIS IS AND I DON'T      
THINK IT NEEDS 45 THOUSAND      
SQUARE FEET OR ANYTHING.        

04:41:29.414 --> 04:41:30.446
THINK IT NEEDS 45 THOUSAND      
SQUARE FEET OR ANYTHING.        
AND AND I I THINK THAT, YOU     

04:41:30.448 --> 04:41:33.115
SQUARE FEET OR ANYTHING.        
AND AND I I THINK THAT, YOU     
KNOW WELL I DON'T WANT TO       

04:41:33.117 --> 04:41:33.817
AND AND I I THINK THAT, YOU     
KNOW WELL I DON'T WANT TO       
RELITIGATE THAT THING BUT I     

04:41:33.819 --> 04:41:36.486
KNOW WELL I DON'T WANT TO       
RELITIGATE THAT THING BUT I     
THINK THAT WE COULD SAVE MORE   

04:41:36.488 --> 04:41:37.287
RELITIGATE THAT THING BUT I     
THINK THAT WE COULD SAVE MORE   
ABOUT HOW THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  

04:41:37.289 --> 04:41:38.020
THINK THAT WE COULD SAVE MORE   
ABOUT HOW THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  
MEANS INTERNALIZING SOME OF THE 

04:41:38.022 --> 04:41:40.890
ABOUT HOW THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  
MEANS INTERNALIZING SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT WE CURRENTLY        

04:41:40.892 --> 04:41:44.460
MEANS INTERNALIZING SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT WE CURRENTLY        
EXTERNALIZE FOR LAND USES AND   

04:41:44.462 --> 04:41:45.462
THINGS THAT WE CURRENTLY        
EXTERNALIZE FOR LAND USES AND   
THAT IT DOES MEAN THAT YOU WANT 

04:41:45.464 --> 04:41:47.931
EXTERNALIZE FOR LAND USES AND   
THAT IT DOES MEAN THAT YOU WANT 
A KIND OF LIGHT INDUSTRIAL.     

04:41:47.933 --> 04:41:49.131
THAT IT DOES MEAN THAT YOU WANT 
A KIND OF LIGHT INDUSTRIAL.     
>> YOU WANT TO BRING BACK SOME  

04:41:49.133 --> 04:41:51.467
A KIND OF LIGHT INDUSTRIAL.     
>> YOU WANT TO BRING BACK SOME  
STUFF LIKE REMEMBER THOSE TWO   

04:41:51.469 --> 04:41:52.402
>> YOU WANT TO BRING BACK SOME  
STUFF LIKE REMEMBER THOSE TWO   
HUGE REALLY LONG MEETINGS THAT  

04:41:52.404 --> 04:41:53.135
STUFF LIKE REMEMBER THOSE TWO   
HUGE REALLY LONG MEETINGS THAT  
WE HAD WHEN WE TRIED TO         

04:41:53.137 --> 04:41:56.238
HUGE REALLY LONG MEETINGS THAT  
WE HAD WHEN WE TRIED TO         
REDEFINE MAKERS OR OCCUPATIONS. 

04:41:56.240 --> 04:42:00.276
WE HAD WHEN WE TRIED TO         
REDEFINE MAKERS OR OCCUPATIONS. 
>> YEAH, I MEAN WE DID HAVE A   

04:42:00.278 --> 04:42:03.512
REDEFINE MAKERS OR OCCUPATIONS. 
>> YEAH, I MEAN WE DID HAVE A   
SIMILAR CONVERSATION ABOUT      

04:42:03.514 --> 04:42:07.350
>> YEAH, I MEAN WE DID HAVE A   
SIMILAR CONVERSATION ABOUT      
NUISANCES AND THE KIND          

04:42:07.352 --> 04:42:08.084
SIMILAR CONVERSATION ABOUT      
NUISANCES AND THE KIND          
OF TINKERING THAT PEOPLE DO AND 

04:42:08.086 --> 04:42:11.421
NUISANCES AND THE KIND          
OF TINKERING THAT PEOPLE DO AND 
THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NEEDS THAT 

04:42:11.423 --> 04:42:12.488
OF TINKERING THAT PEOPLE DO AND 
THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NEEDS THAT 
AND IT'S JUST BECAUSE WE        

04:42:12.490 --> 04:42:15.958
THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NEEDS THAT 
AND IT'S JUST BECAUSE WE        
INTERNALIZED MORE OF OUR WASTE  

04:42:15.960 --> 04:42:16.892
AND IT'S JUST BECAUSE WE        
INTERNALIZED MORE OF OUR WASTE  
AND WE ARE PRODUCING VALUE OUT  

04:42:16.894 --> 04:42:19.929
INTERNALIZED MORE OF OUR WASTE  
AND WE ARE PRODUCING VALUE OUT  
OF WASTE AND SO WE COULD SAY    

04:42:19.931 --> 04:42:23.799
AND WE ARE PRODUCING VALUE OUT  
OF WASTE AND SO WE COULD SAY    
MORE ABOUT WHAT SORT OF LAND    

04:42:23.801 --> 04:42:24.433
OF WASTE AND SO WE COULD SAY    
MORE ABOUT WHAT SORT OF LAND    
USE WOULD BE NEEDED.            

04:42:24.435 --> 04:42:26.869
MORE ABOUT WHAT SORT OF LAND    
USE WOULD BE NEEDED.            
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE IDEA  

04:42:26.871 --> 04:42:27.503
USE WOULD BE NEEDED.            
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE IDEA  
OF EXCLUDING HOUSING FROM       

04:42:27.505 --> 04:42:32.041
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE IDEA  
OF EXCLUDING HOUSING FROM       
CERTAIN PLACES DIDN'T FLY VERY  

04:42:32.043 --> 04:42:32.375
OF EXCLUDING HOUSING FROM       
CERTAIN PLACES DIDN'T FLY VERY  
WELL.                           

04:42:32.377 --> 04:42:35.744
CERTAIN PLACES DIDN'T FLY VERY  
WELL.                           
BUT YOU'RE AND I SPOKE HALF     

04:42:35.746 --> 04:42:38.581
WELL.                           
BUT YOU'RE AND I SPOKE HALF     
AGAINST THAT WHICH I REGRET     

04:42:38.583 --> 04:42:39.381

NEED SPACE AND I WATCHED HOW    
HARD THE CITY HAD TO LOOK TO    
FIND AN ELECTION CENTER AND I'M

I MEAN THE CITY IS STARTING TO  
HAVE MEETINGS THERE AND I CAN'T 

04:42:56.701 --> 04:42:58.768
I MEAN THE CITY IS STARTING TO  
HAVE MEETINGS THERE AND I CAN'T 
BIKE THERE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO 

04:42:58.770 --> 04:42:59.635
HAVE MEETINGS THERE AND I CAN'T 
BIKE THERE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO

GET KILLED AND I DON'T WANT     
THAT.

04:43:21.793 --> 04:43:25.695
SAYING THAT WE NEED TO RESERVE  
IT IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY    
BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT 

04:43:25.697 --> 04:43:26.763
IT IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY    
BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT 
I THINK A STRONGER ARGUMENT CAN 

04:43:26.765 --> 04:43:30.232
BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT 
I THINK A STRONGER ARGUMENT CAN 
BE MADE FOR THAT IF WE WANT TO  

04:43:30.234 --> 04:43:31.067
I THINK A STRONGER ARGUMENT CAN 
BE MADE FOR THAT IF WE WANT TO  
KEEP THAT IN THERE THE CIRCULAR

04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:34.337
ECONOMY THING.                  
>> SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING   
TO ASK IS I THINK WHAT I'M

04:43:38.142 --> 04:43:38.774
ONE BUT KEEP FIVE POINT TWO.    
>> DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT?       
I THINK SO.                     

04:43:38.776 --> 04:43:45.281

04:43:49.320 --> 04:43:52.755
EITHER SHRINK OR MODIFY WHAT'S  
WRONG WITH FIVE POINT ONE?      
IT DOESN'T SAY I MEAN SECURA    

04:43:52.757 --> 04:43:53.689

THAT'S LIKE YEAH WE SHOULD GET  

04:43:55.893 --> 04:43:56.692
FAIRSHARE THE SPIN OFF AND      
THAT'S LIKE YEAH WE SHOULD GET  
SOMETHING OUT OF A UNIVERSITY.

THAT'S LIKE YEAH WE SHOULD GET  
SOMETHING OUT OF A UNIVERSITY.

POINT TWO.                      
I THINK WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT IS 
THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A RATIONALE

SO CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND   

05:02:31.241 --> 05:02:33.307
YES.                            
SO CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND   
THAT PRESERVE DOESN'T MEAN SET  

05:02:33.309 --> 05:02:37.378
SO CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND   
THAT PRESERVE DOESN'T MEAN SET  
ASIDE LAND THE SEVEN POINT ONE  

05:02:37.380 --> 05:02:43.285
THAT PRESERVE DOESN'T MEAN SET  
ASIDE LAND THE SEVEN POINT ONE  
YEAR                            

05:02:44.153 --> 05:02:46.287
    .                           
SO I THINK THIS IS THE SAME     
THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT  

05:02:46.289 --> 05:02:55.329
SO I THINK THIS IS THE SAME     
THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT  
IF WE DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE WE  

05:02:55.331 --> 05:03:00.334
THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT  
IF WE DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE WE  
WANT TO TAKE STEPS TO MAKE IT   

05:03:00.336 --> 05:03:02.670
IF WE DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE WE  
WANT TO TAKE STEPS TO MAKE IT   
MORE VIABLE FOR THE ENTIRE      

05:03:02.672 --> 05:03:07.676
WANT TO TAKE STEPS TO MAKE IT   
MORE VIABLE FOR THE ENTIRE      
PAPITO SHOP TO CONTINUE IN THAT 

05:03:07.678 --> 05:03:08.176
MORE VIABLE FOR THE ENTIRE      
PAPITO SHOP TO CONTINUE IN THAT

05:03:08.178 --> 05:03:11.413
PAPITO SHOP TO CONTINUE IN THAT 
DISTRICT OR NOT.                
I THINK IF THIS WAS AN          

05:03:11.415 --> 05:03:14.515
DISTRICT OR NOT.                
I THINK IF THIS WAS AN          
OPPORTUNITY ZONE LIKE THE CITY  

05:03:14.517 --> 05:03:15.484
I THINK IF THIS WAS AN          
OPPORTUNITY ZONE LIKE THE CITY  
HAD IT AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE  

05:03:15.486 --> 05:03:16.318
OPPORTUNITY ZONE LIKE THE CITY  
HAD IT AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE  
TO LOWER THE RENTS SO THAT      

05:03:16.320 --> 05:03:18.954
HAD IT AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE  
TO LOWER THE RENTS SO THAT      
ENTREPRENEURS COULD MOVE INTO   

05:03:18.956 --> 05:03:19.921
TO LOWER THE RENTS SO THAT      
ENTREPRENEURS COULD MOVE INTO   
IT, I THINK I WOULD BE ONE      

05:03:19.923 --> 05:03:22.757
ENTREPRENEURS COULD MOVE INTO   
IT, I THINK I WOULD BE ONE      
HUNDRED PERCENT IN SUPPORT THAT 

05:03:22.759 --> 05:03:23.558
IT, I THINK I WOULD BE ONE      
HUNDRED PERCENT IN SUPPORT THAT 
BECAUSE NOW WE ARE DOING        

05:03:23.560 --> 05:03:26.794
HUNDRED PERCENT IN SUPPORT THAT 
BECAUSE NOW WE ARE DOING        
SOMETHING PROACTIVE FOR LOCAL   

05:03:26.796 --> 05:03:30.331
BECAUSE NOW WE ARE DOING        
SOMETHING PROACTIVE FOR LOCAL   
BUSINESSES USING LAND AS THE

TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE THAT.       

05:03:31.101 --> 05:03:32.233
BUSINESSES USING LAND AS THE    
TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE THAT.       
BUT IF WE ARE JUST SETTING

TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE THAT.       
BUT IF WE ARE JUST SETTING      
ASIDE LAND THAT IS INTERESTING. 

05:03:34.438 --> 05:03:38.039
BUT IF WE ARE JUST SETTING      
ASIDE LAND THAT IS INTERESTING.

YOU KNOW PRESERVER VARIETY      
OF SPACE.                       
I MEAN THIS IS WHAT HE IS       

05:04:29.025 --> 05:04:31.827
OF SPACE.                       
I MEAN THIS IS WHAT HE IS       
TALKING ABOUT OUT HIS           

05:04:31.829 --> 05:04:32.561
I MEAN THIS IS WHAT HE IS       
TALKING ABOUT OUT HIS           
VOCABULARY WAS PROACTIVELY      

05:04:32.563 --> 05:04:36.398
TALKING ABOUT OUT HIS           
VOCABULARY WAS PROACTIVELY      
BUYING THINGS WHEN THEY COME ON 

05:04:36.400 --> 05:04:40.168
VOCABULARY WAS PROACTIVELY      
BUYING THINGS WHEN THEY COME ON 
THE MARKET SO THAT WE CAN DO    

05:04:40.170 --> 05:04:40.602
BUYING THINGS WHEN THEY COME ON 
THE MARKET SO THAT WE CAN DO    
THIS WITH THEM.                 

05:04:40.604 --> 05:04:43.672
THE MARKET SO THAT WE CAN DO    
THIS WITH THEM.                 
SO LET'S SAY SOMEBODY WANTS TO  

05:04:43.674 --> 05:04:44.472
THIS WITH THEM.                 
SO LET'S SAY SOMEBODY WANTS TO  
SELL THAT SHOPPING CENTER THAT  

05:04:44.474 --> 05:04:46.841
SO LET'S SAY SOMEBODY WANTS TO  
SELL THAT SHOPPING CENTER THAT  
THE THRIFT STORE IS IN.         

05:04:46.843 --> 05:04:47.943
SELL THAT SHOPPING CENTER THAT  
THE THRIFT STORE IS IN.         
THE CITY MIGHT BUY IT SO THAT   

05:04:47.945 --> 05:04:51.045
THE THRIFT STORE IS IN.         
THE CITY MIGHT BUY IT SO THAT   
WE CAN BECOME THE LANDFILL.     

05:04:51.047 --> 05:04:51.979
THE CITY MIGHT BUY IT SO THAT   
WE CAN BECOME THE LANDFILL.     
WE SAY THAT ABSOLUTELY.         

05:04:51.981 --> 05:04:54.682
WE CAN BECOME THE LANDFILL.     
WE SAY THAT ABSOLUTELY.         
BUT I'VE GOT TO BE REAL THAT IF 

05:04:54.684 --> 05:04:55.783
WE SAY THAT ABSOLUTELY.         
BUT I'VE GOT TO BE REAL THAT IF 
LAND USE FRAMEWORK IS SUCH THAT 

05:04:55.785 --> 05:04:58.987
BUT I'VE GOT TO BE REAL THAT IF 
LAND USE FRAMEWORK IS SUCH THAT 
RESIDENTIAL IS MORE ENTICING    

05:04:58.989 --> 05:05:01.856
LAND USE FRAMEWORK IS SUCH THAT 
RESIDENTIAL IS MORE ENTICING    
THERE THE FINANCIAL REALITY     

05:05:01.858 --> 05:05:02.858
RESIDENTIAL IS MORE ENTICING    
THERE THE FINANCIAL REALITY     
OF THE CITY CHOOSING TO BUY IT  

05:05:02.860 --> 05:05:03.725
THERE THE FINANCIAL REALITY     
OF THE CITY CHOOSING TO BUY IT  
VERSUS HOUSING TO COME IN THERE 

05:05:03.727 --> 05:05:06.027
OF THE CITY CHOOSING TO BUY IT  
VERSUS HOUSING TO COME IN THERE 
MIGHT BE DIFFERENTIAL.          

05:05:06.029 --> 05:05:07.028
VERSUS HOUSING TO COME IN THERE 
MIGHT BE DIFFERENTIAL.          
IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I THINK  

05:05:07.030 --> 05:05:10.098
MIGHT BE DIFFERENTIAL.          
IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I THINK  
THE FOCUS SHOULD BE IF IF YOU   

05:05:10.100 --> 05:05:10.832
IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I THINK  
THE FOCUS SHOULD BE IF IF YOU   
DON'T WANT TO USE LAND USE      

05:05:10.834 --> 05:05:13.935
THE FOCUS SHOULD BE IF IF YOU   
DON'T WANT TO USE LAND USE      
REGULATIONS TO DO IT, LET'S BE  

05:05:13.937 --> 05:05:14.769
DON'T WANT TO USE LAND USE      
REGULATIONS TO DO IT, LET'S BE  
CLEAR ABOUT THAT LIKE I THINK   

05:05:14.771 --> 05:05:15.636
REGULATIONS TO DO IT, LET'S BE  
CLEAR ABOUT THAT LIKE I THINK   
THIS IS INTENDED TO SAY I THINK 

05:05:15.638 --> 05:05:18.340
CLEAR ABOUT THAT LIKE I THINK   
THIS IS INTENDED TO SAY I THINK 
IT MIGHT BE VALUABLE TO FIND    

05:05:18.342 --> 05:05:18.740
THIS IS INTENDED TO SAY I THINK 
IT MIGHT BE VALUABLE TO FIND    
THE SPACES.                     

05:05:18.742 --> 05:05:20.809
IT MIGHT BE VALUABLE TO FIND    
THE SPACES.                     
THIS IS ALSO I THINK TALKING    

05:05:20.811 --> 05:05:21.743
THE SPACES.                     
THIS IS ALSO I THINK TALKING    
ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW, THE        

05:05:21.745 --> 05:05:25.647
THIS IS ALSO I THINK TALKING    
ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW, THE        
ZINGERMAN'S SPHERE              

05:05:25.649 --> 05:05:26.181
ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW, THE        
ZINGERMAN'S SPHERE              
OF BUSINESSES.                  

05:05:26.183 --> 05:05:26.914
ZINGERMAN'S SPHERE              
OF BUSINESSES.                  
MANY OF THEM CAN'T AREN'T       

05:05:26.916 --> 05:05:27.649
OF BUSINESSES.                  
MANY OF THEM CAN'T AREN'T       
LOCATED IN THE CITY BECAUSE     

05:05:27.651 --> 05:05:28.783
MANY OF THEM CAN'T AREN'T       
LOCATED IN THE CITY BECAUSE     
THEY FOUND MORE AFFORDABLE      

05:05:28.785 --> 05:05:29.317
LOCATED IN THE CITY BECAUSE     
THEY FOUND MORE AFFORDABLE      
SPACE SOMEWHERE ELSE.           

05:05:29.319 --> 05:05:30.551
THEY FOUND MORE AFFORDABLE      
SPACE SOMEWHERE ELSE.           
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT FROM A   

05:05:30.553 --> 05:05:31.052
SPACE SOMEWHERE ELSE.           
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT FROM A   
LAND-USE PERSPECTIVE.           

05:05:31.054 --> 05:05:33.455
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT FROM A   
LAND-USE PERSPECTIVE.           
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A GOAL.   

05:05:33.457 --> 05:05:36.924
LAND-USE PERSPECTIVE.           
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A GOAL.   
IT COULD BE FROM TRYING TO PUT  

05:05:36.926 --> 05:05:37.558
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A GOAL.   
IT COULD BE FROM TRYING TO PUT  
MORE FLEXIBILITY SO A CAR       

05:05:37.560 --> 05:05:38.293
IT COULD BE FROM TRYING TO PUT  
MORE FLEXIBILITY SO A CAR       
RENTAL PLACE DOESN'T HAVE TO    

05:05:38.295 --> 05:05:41.163
MORE FLEXIBILITY SO A CAR       
RENTAL PLACE DOESN'T HAVE TO    
ABIDE BY A MAXIMUM PARKING      

05:05:41.165 --> 05:05:41.996
RENTAL PLACE DOESN'T HAVE TO    
ABIDE BY A MAXIMUM PARKING      
RATIO SO THAT THEY CAN MORE     

05:05:41.998 --> 05:05:44.699
ABIDE BY A MAXIMUM PARKING      
RATIO SO THAT THEY CAN MORE     
VIABLY CREATE A RENTAL FACILITY 

05:05:44.701 --> 05:05:45.566
RATIO SO THAT THEY CAN MORE     
VIABLY CREATE A RENTAL FACILITY 
WITHOUT BUILDING A GARAGE TO    

05:05:45.568 --> 05:05:49.136
VIABLY CREATE A RENTAL FACILITY 
WITHOUT BUILDING A GARAGE TO    
HOUSE ALL THE VEHICLES OR WE    

05:05:49.138 --> 05:05:50.071
WITHOUT BUILDING A GARAGE TO    
HOUSE ALL THE VEHICLES OR WE    
COULD SAY NO, WE CARE MORE      

05:05:50.073 --> 05:05:52.273
HOUSE ALL THE VEHICLES OR WE    
COULD SAY NO, WE CARE MORE      
ABOUT FORM AND SIDEWALK         

05:05:52.275 --> 05:05:53.208
COULD SAY NO, WE CARE MORE      
ABOUT FORM AND SIDEWALK         
EXPERIENCE THAN WE DO ABOUT THE 

05:05:53.210 --> 05:05:56.244
ABOUT FORM AND SIDEWALK         
EXPERIENCE THAN WE DO ABOUT THE 
VIABILITY OF THE RENTAL COMPANY 

05:05:56.246 --> 05:05:56.711
EXPERIENCE THAN WE DO ABOUT THE 
VIABILITY OF THE RENTAL COMPANY 
GOING THERE.                    

05:05:56.713 --> 05:05:57.445
VIABILITY OF THE RENTAL COMPANY

BUT IT'S GOOD TO CONTEMPLATE    

05:08:58.061 --> 05:08:58.759

BUT IT'S GOOD TO CONTEMPLATE    
THAT AND PUT THAT MEMORIALIZED
