QUESTION IS WHY DOES NOT WHY    
DOES THE DESIGN NO LONGER GO    

00:48:34.528 --> 00:48:37.997
QUESTION IS WHY DOES NOT WHY    
DOES THE DESIGN NO LONGER GO    
OVER THE BUS LANES IN THAT      

00:48:37.999 --> 00:48:38.330
DOES THE DESIGN NO LONGER GO    
OVER THE BUS LANES IN THAT      
AREA?                           

00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:41.433
OVER THE BUS LANES IN THAT      
AREA?                           
SO I THINK IF YOU REMEMBER      

00:48:41.435 --> 00:48:42.167

SO I THINK IF YOU REMEMBER      
EARLIER IN THE CONVERSATION     
JENNIFER PRESENTED THERE WAS A  

00:48:45.205 --> 00:48:49.074
EARLIER IN THE CONVERSATION     
JENNIFER PRESENTED THERE WAS A  
MUCH GREATER EXPENSE TO THE     

00:48:49.076 --> 00:48:49.508
JENNIFER PRESENTED THERE WAS A  
MUCH GREATER EXPENSE TO THE     
PREVIOUS DESIGN.                

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:50.475
MUCH GREATER EXPENSE TO THE     
PREVIOUS DESIGN.                
IT WAS IT WAS ESSENTIALLY TWO

HIGH RISE TOWERS IN ONE WITH    
TWO SETS OF ELEVATORS AND TWO   
SETS OF STAIRS AND THE          

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.885
TWO SETS OF ELEVATORS AND TWO   
SETS OF STAIRS AND THE          
DEVELOPMENT WAS COST            

00:48:59.887 --> 00:49:00.285
SETS OF STAIRS AND THE          
DEVELOPMENT WAS COST            
PROHIBITIVE.                    

00:49:00.287 --> 00:49:04.189
DEVELOPMENT WAS COST            
PROHIBITIVE.                    
SO AS WE CREATED A SINGLE       

00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:12.031
PROHIBITIVE.                    
SO AS WE CREATED A SINGLE       
BUILDING SOLUTION, WE THEN MOVE 

00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:12.698
SO AS WE CREATED A SINGLE       
BUILDING SOLUTION, WE THEN MOVE 
TO SOMETHING THAT WAS MUCH      

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.966
BUILDING SOLUTION, WE THEN MOVE 
TO SOMETHING THAT WAS MUCH      
SIMPLER AND EASIER TO CALL.     

00:49:14.968 --> 00:49:15.768
TO SOMETHING THAT WAS MUCH

SO IT WAS BIGGER.               

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:19.571
SIMPLER AND EASIER TO CALL.     
SO IT WAS BIGGER.               
IT MIGHT REQUIRE MORE OF THAT.  

00:49:19.573 --> 00:49:20.572
SO IT WAS BIGGER.               
IT MIGHT REQUIRE MORE OF THAT.  
YES, THERE STUFF RIGHT.         

00:49:20.574 --> 00:49:23.174
IT MIGHT REQUIRE MORE OF THAT.  
YES, THERE STUFF RIGHT.

00:58:30.457 --> 00:58:31.189
WHERE THEY JUST CLOSE OFF THE   
SIDEWALK AND THE BIKE LANES     
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A      

00:58:31.191 --> 00:58:31.989
SIDEWALK AND THE BIKE LANES     
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A      
REALLY TRICKY PLACE TO JUST     

00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:34.025
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A

SIDEWALKS OPEN AS POSSIBLE      

00:58:45.071 --> 00:58:45.937
BIKE LANE OPEN AS MANY

RIGHT.                          
I THINK ONE THING THAT'S        
CHANGED IN THE TAX CREDIT       

01:01:53.093 --> 01:01:53.891
I THINK ONE THING THAT'S

PROGRAM WHICH IS SORT OF THE    

01:01:53.893 --> 01:01:54.559
CHANGED IN THE TAX CREDIT       
PROGRAM WHICH IS SORT OF THE    
KEY FUNDING LINCHPIN TO THESE   

01:01:54.561 --> 01:01:55.293
PROGRAM WHICH IS SORT OF THE    
KEY FUNDING LINCHPIN TO THESE   
TYPES OF PROJECTS IS THE        

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.027

I THINK WAS YOU KNOW, SOMETIME  
AROUND TWENTY NINETEEN OR SO.   

01:02:01.601 --> 01:02:05.469
I THINK WAS YOU KNOW, SOMETIME  
AROUND TWENTY NINETEEN OR SO.   
BUT THAT EIGHT PERCENT UNIT IS  

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:06.471
AROUND TWENTY NINETEEN OR SO.   
BUT THAT EIGHT PERCENT UNIT IS  
ACTUALLY MORE FEASIBLE THAN THE 

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:10.141
BUT THAT EIGHT PERCENT UNIT IS  
ACTUALLY MORE FEASIBLE THAN THE 
MARKET UNIT, ESPECIALLY WHEN    

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:12.510
ACTUALLY MORE FEASIBLE THAN THE 
MARKET UNIT, ESPECIALLY WHEN    
YOU'RE THINKING OF DOING A

QUESTIONS SO WE WILL START WITH 
THE CAPITAL STACK WHICH YOU WE  

01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:07.051
QUESTIONS SO WE WILL START WITH 
THE CAPITAL STACK WHICH YOU WE  
ARE JUST IN AND FOR THOSE WHO   

01:05:07.053 --> 01:05:07.785
THE CAPITAL STACK WHICH YOU WE

STACK JUST SORT REFERS TO THE   

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:11.455
ARE LISTENING IN THE CAPITAL    
STACK JUST SORT REFERS TO THE   
LAYERS OF FINANCING THAT MAKES  

01:05:11.457 --> 01:05:14.659
STACK JUST SORT REFERS TO THE   
LAYERS OF FINANCING THAT MAKES  
A PROJECT LIKE THIS WORK.       

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:17.995
LAYERS OF FINANCING THAT MAKES  
A PROJECT LIKE THIS WORK.       
AND SO YOU HAVE BUILT A STACK   

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:18.896
A PROJECT LIKE THIS WORK.       
AND SO YOU HAVE BUILT A STACK   
OF TOOLS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN  

01:05:18.898 --> 01:05:22.400
AND SO YOU HAVE BUILT A STACK   
OF TOOLS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN  
YOU ARE ESTIMATING THE PROJECTS 

01:05:22.402 --> 01:05:23.334
OF TOOLS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN  
YOU ARE ESTIMATING THE PROJECTS 
GOING TO COST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED 

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:24.001
YOU ARE ESTIMATING THE PROJECTS 
GOING TO COST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED 
AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO   

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:25.536
GOING TO COST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED 
AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO   
CONSTRUCT CORRECT.              

01:05:25.538 --> 01:05:26.604
AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO   
CONSTRUCT CORRECT.              
SO THAT BRINGS THE UNIT COST TO 

01:05:26.606 --> 01:05:27.272
CONSTRUCT CORRECT.              
SO THAT BRINGS THE UNIT COST TO 
SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX       

01:05:27.274 --> 01:05:29.974
SO THAT BRINGS THE UNIT COST TO 
SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX       
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT.      

01:05:29.976 --> 01:05:30.608
SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX       
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT.

THOSE THINGS COME WITH THE COST 

01:06:47.553 --> 01:06:48.352
OF SUSTAINABILITY.              
THOSE THINGS COME WITH THE COST 
THE BENEFIT ANOTHER THE         

01:06:48.354 --> 01:06:51.989
THOSE THINGS COME WITH THE COST 
THE BENEFIT ANOTHER THE

01:06:51.991 --> 01:06:52.690
THE BENEFIT ANOTHER THE         
GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE. 
THAT'S NOT CHEAP .              

01:06:52.692 --> 01:06:55.893
GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE. 
THAT'S NOT CHEAP .              
THAT COMES WITH A TAX CREDIT AS

THAT COMES WITH A TAX CREDIT AS 
WELL.                           
SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN A      

01:06:57.297 --> 01:07:00.365
WELL.                           
SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN A      
WORLD WHERE IF YOU'RE BUILDING  

01:07:00.367 --> 01:07:01.098
SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN A      
WORLD WHERE IF YOU'RE BUILDING  
JUST MARKET RATE AND YOU'RE NOT 

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.068
WORLD WHERE IF YOU'RE BUILDING  
JUST MARKET RATE AND YOU'RE NOT 
PURSUING SOME INCENTIVES, YES,  

01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:04.769
JUST MARKET RATE AND YOU'RE NOT 
PURSUING SOME INCENTIVES, YES,  
THE COST WOULD BE LOWER.        

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.271
PURSUING SOME INCENTIVES, YES,  
THE COST WOULD BE LOWER.        
BUT THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A    

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:07.571
THE COST WOULD BE LOWER.        
BUT THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A    
HOUSING.

THEY I THINK YOU'RE TALKING     
ABOUT WHAT'S A NINE PERCENT     

01:12:19.451 --> 01:12:20.384
THEY I THINK YOU'RE TALKING     
ABOUT WHAT'S A NINE PERCENT     
NINE AND THE FOUR PERCENT?      

01:12:20.386 --> 01:12:21.184
ABOUT WHAT'S A NINE PERCENT     
NINE AND THE FOUR PERCENT?      
YEAH, WE'RE DOING A FOUR        

01:12:21.186 --> 01:12:21.452
NINE AND THE FOUR PERCENT?      
YEAH, WE'RE DOING A FOUR

SO YOU'RE NOT DOING NINE

ABOUT 60 TO 70 PERCENT WOULD    

01:12:47.914 --> 01:12:50.982
THE GAP BECAUSE MY CALCULATIONS 
ABOUT 60 TO 70 PERCENT WOULD    
COME THROUGH THE LOW INCOME TAX 

01:12:50.984 --> 01:12:51.982
ABOUT 60 TO 70 PERCENT WOULD    
COME THROUGH THE LOW INCOME TAX 
BUT THEN YOU STILL HAD ABOUT 80 

01:12:51.984 --> 01:12:55.352
COME THROUGH THE LOW INCOME TAX 
BUT THEN YOU STILL HAD ABOUT 80 
TO 90 MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU  

01:12:55.354 --> 01:12:56.020
BUT THEN YOU STILL HAD ABOUT 80

01:19:50.403 --> 01:19:53.503
SO WHEN THE CITY SOLD THE       
PROPERTY TO US AND I THINK      
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE  

01:19:53.505 --> 01:19:56.706
PROPERTY TO US AND I THINK      
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE  
WE DID A APPRAISAL I THINK THE  

01:19:56.708 --> 01:19:57.440
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE  
WE DID A APPRAISAL I THINK THE  
YEAR BEFORE THAT I THINK THE

01:20:04.683 --> 01:20:05.382
MILLION IF I RECALL ISH AND THE

POINT TWO SO RIGHT THERE IT'S   

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:08.384
CITY SOLD IT TO US FOR SIX      
POINT TWO SO RIGHT THERE IT'S   
ABOUT A FIFTY PERCENT DISCOUNT
