I JUST GOT IT TWO DAYS AGO WE   
COULD WE COULD REQUIRE THAT     

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:54.421
I JUST GOT IT TWO DAYS AGO WE   
COULD WE COULD REQUIRE THAT     
EVERY TIME A SIDEWALK OR A      

01:07:54.423 --> 01:07:56.824
COULD WE COULD REQUIRE THAT     
EVERY TIME A SIDEWALK OR A      
CROSSWALK IS CONSTRUCTED THAT   

01:07:56.826 --> 01:08:00.594
EVERY TIME A SIDEWALK OR A

THEY WOULD PUT IN THE           
UNDERGROUND STUFF THE CONDUITS  

01:08:08.537 --> 01:08:09.637
THEY WOULD PUT IN THE           
UNDERGROUND STUFF THE CONDUITS  
,THE HANDLES SO THAT IT&amp;apos;S SO    

01:08:09.639 --> 01:08:10.437
UNDERGROUND STUFF THE CONDUITS  
,THE HANDLES SO THAT IT&amp;apos;S SO    
THAT IT&amp;apos;S READY BUT NOT

THAT IT&amp;apos;S READY BUT NOT         
INSTALLED.                      
THAT&amp;apos;S LIKE EVERY CROSSWALK OR  

01:08:13.976 --> 01:08:17.478
INSTALLED.                      
THAT&amp;apos;S LIKE EVERY CROSSWALK OR  
SECTION THEY DO LIKE THEY MAKE  

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:17.945
THAT&amp;apos;S LIKE EVERY CROSSWALK OR  
SECTION THEY DO LIKE THEY MAKE  
THEM ALL APPS READY.            

01:08:17.947 --> 01:08:18.613
SECTION THEY DO LIKE THEY MAKE  
THEM ALL APPS READY.            
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN OBVIOUS      

01:08:18.615 --> 01:08:19.814
THEM ALL APPS READY.            
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN OBVIOUS      
THING TO DO.                    

01:08:19.816 --> 01:08:20.815
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN OBVIOUS      
THING TO DO.                    
THE SECOND OPTION IS THAT       

01:08:20.817 --> 01:08:24.451
THING TO DO.                    
THE SECOND OPTION IS THAT       
WHENEVER ANY ANY SIDEWALK OR    

01:08:24.453 --> 01:08:28.322
THE SECOND OPTION IS THAT       
WHENEVER ANY ANY SIDEWALK OR    
CROSSWALK IS PART OF A CAPITAL  

01:08:28.324 --> 01:08:32.093
WHENEVER ANY ANY SIDEWALK OR    
CROSSWALK IS PART OF A CAPITAL  
IMPROVEMENT PROJECT THEY COULD  

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:36.030
CROSSWALK IS PART OF A CAPITAL  
IMPROVEMENT PROJECT THEY COULD  
JUST UPGRADE TO AN APPS JUST AS 

01:08:36.032 --> 01:08:36.697
IMPROVEMENT PROJECT THEY COULD  
JUST UPGRADE TO AN APPS JUST AS 
LIKE A DEFAULT.                 

01:08:36.699 --> 01:08:38.933
JUST UPGRADE TO AN APPS JUST AS 
LIKE A DEFAULT.                 
BUT THEY&amp;apos;RE SAYING THAT THAT A  

01:08:38.935 --> 01:08:39.833
LIKE A DEFAULT.                 
BUT THEY&amp;apos;RE SAYING THAT THAT A  
LOT OF THESE PROJECTS DON&amp;apos;T     

01:08:39.835 --> 01:08:40.568
BUT THEY&amp;apos;RE SAYING THAT THAT A  
LOT OF THESE PROJECTS DON&amp;apos;T     
TOUCH ALL FOUR CORNERS OF AN    

01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:42.837
LOT OF THESE PROJECTS DON&amp;apos;T     
TOUCH ALL FOUR CORNERS OF AN

TOUCH ALL FOUR CORNERS OF AN    
INTERSECTION.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF WE WERE TO DO THAT     

01:08:44.073 --> 01:08:47.274
INTERSECTION.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF WE WERE TO DO THAT     
THEN WE WOULD BE WE MIGHT NOT   

01:08:47.276 --> 01:08:50.978
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IF WE WERE TO DO THAT     
THEN WE WOULD BE WE MIGHT NOT   
WE MIGHT HAVE SORT OF APPS ON   

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.679
THEN WE WOULD BE WE MIGHT NOT   
WE MIGHT HAVE SORT OF APPS ON   
ONE SIDE OF THE INTERSECTION    

01:08:51.681 --> 01:08:52.480
WE MIGHT HAVE SORT OF APPS ON   
ONE SIDE OF THE INTERSECTION    
BUT NOT ON THE OTHER BECAUSE WE 

01:08:52.482 --> 01:08:55.583
ONE SIDE OF THE INTERSECTION    
BUT NOT ON THE OTHER BECAUSE WE 
WOULD AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE  

01:08:55.585 --> 01:08:56.317
BUT NOT ON THE OTHER BECAUSE WE 
WOULD AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE  
OF IT BECAUSE I WAS ASKING      

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:59.720
WOULD AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE
