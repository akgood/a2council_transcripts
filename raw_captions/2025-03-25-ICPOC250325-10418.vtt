OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND SO I  
KIND OF ALERTED THE CHAIR AT

00:30:06.277 --> 00:30:09.379
KIND OF ALERTED THE CHAIR AT

WAS THERE FUNDING FROM THAT     

00:30:09.381 --> 00:30:09.913
THE TIME TO IT'S AVAILABLE AND  
WAS THERE FUNDING FROM THAT     
DISSOLVED AS WELL?              

00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:13.383
WAS THERE FUNDING FROM THAT     
DISSOLVED AS WELL?              
>> IT WAS ALL THOSE THAT REALLY 

00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:14.050
DISSOLVED AS WELL?              
>> IT WAS ALL THOSE THAT REALLY 
WAS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT.        

00:30:14.052 --> 00:30:17.087

WAS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT.        
IT WAS IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT WAS

WAS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT.        
IT WAS IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT WAS 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS    

00:30:20.225 --> 00:30:21.224
IT WAS IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT WAS 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS    
BUT THAT'S ABOUT A TENTH        

00:30:21.226 --> 00:30:21.891
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS    
BUT THAT'S ABOUT A TENTH        
OF WHAT THE PREVIOUS STUDY HAD  

00:30:21.893 --> 00:30:24.894
BUT THAT'S ABOUT A TENTH        
OF WHAT THE PREVIOUS STUDY HAD  
COST THE CITY AND WE REALLY USE 

00:30:24.896 --> 00:30:25.561
OF WHAT THE PREVIOUS STUDY HAD  
COST THE CITY AND WE REALLY USE 
THAT TO SUPPORT A GRADUATE      

00:30:25.563 --> 00:30:28.331
COST THE CITY AND WE REALLY USE 
THAT TO SUPPORT A GRADUATE      
STUDENT DURING THE COURSE THAT  

00:30:28.333 --> 00:30:31.868
THAT TO SUPPORT A GRADUATE      
STUDENT DURING THE COURSE THAT  
AND SO WHAT IT WOULD COST IT    

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.602
STUDENT DURING THE COURSE THAT  
AND SO WHAT IT WOULD COST IT    
WOULD BE ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE 

00:30:32.604 --> 00:30:33.403
AND SO WHAT IT WOULD COST IT    
WOULD BE ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE 
THE MONEY WOULD COME FROM THAT  

00:30:33.405 --> 00:30:35.472
WOULD BE ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE 
THE MONEY WOULD COME FROM THAT  
KIND OF STUFF.                  

00:30:35.474 --> 00:30:36.406
THE MONEY WOULD COME FROM THAT  
KIND OF STUFF.                  
SO HOW MUCH WAS THIS?           

00:30:36.408 --> 00:30:40.043
KIND OF STUFF.                  
SO HOW MUCH WAS THIS?           
WAS THIS THE GRANT AS FAR AS

YEAH, SO THE POSSIBILITY I      
WOULD IMAGINE EXISTS THAT IS    

00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:58.261
YEAH, SO THE POSSIBILITY I      
WOULD IMAGINE EXISTS THAT IS    
WILLINGNESS AND THE ABILITY     

00:30:58.263 --> 00:31:01.731
WOULD IMAGINE EXISTS THAT IS    
WILLINGNESS AND THE ABILITY

MENTIONED ABOUT WEBINARS.       
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE         

01:02:00.757 --> 01:02:04.659
MENTIONED ABOUT WEBINARS.       
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE         
WEBINARS FROM NICOLE AND IT WAS 

01:02:04.661 --> 01:02:08.463
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE         
WEBINARS FROM NICOLE AND IT WAS 
ON THE LIMITATIONS OF USING     

01:02:08.465 --> 01:02:12.633
WEBINARS FROM NICOLE AND IT WAS 
ON THE LIMITATIONS OF USING     
VIDEOS AS EVIDENCE AND          

01:02:12.635 --> 01:02:13.534
ON THE LIMITATIONS OF USING     
VIDEOS AS EVIDENCE AND          
ESPECIALLY IN COURT AND THE     

01:02:13.536 --> 01:02:16.470
VIDEOS AS EVIDENCE AND          
ESPECIALLY IN COURT AND THE     
PERSON WHO WAS PRESENTING THE   

01:02:16.472 --> 01:02:17.238
ESPECIALLY IN COURT AND THE     
PERSON WHO WAS PRESENTING THE   
WEBINAR WHO WAS GIVEN THE       

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:26.181
PERSON WHO WAS PRESENTING THE   
WEBINAR WHO WAS GIVEN THE       
WEBINAR WAS FROM EXXON BUT ALSO 

01:02:40.929 --> 01:02:44.832
HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH THE      
SYSTEM THE EXXON IS USING TO    
PLAY ANY TYPE OF VIDEO AS IT'S  

01:02:44.834 --> 01:02:45.566
SYSTEM THE EXXON IS USING TO    
PLAY ANY TYPE OF VIDEO AS IT'S  
CALLED EXXON INVESTIGATIVE AND  

01:02:45.568 --> 01:02:47.601
PLAY ANY TYPE OF VIDEO AS IT'S  
CALLED EXXON INVESTIGATIVE AND  
I BELIEVE THAT THE APD IS USING 

01:02:47.603 --> 01:02:49.036
CALLED EXXON INVESTIGATIVE AND  
I BELIEVE THAT THE APD IS USING 
ANOTHER SYSTEM BEFORE FOR FOR   

01:02:49.038 --> 01:02:49.904
I BELIEVE THAT THE APD IS USING 
ANOTHER SYSTEM BEFORE FOR FOR   
THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THEY  

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:51.305
ANOTHER SYSTEM BEFORE FOR FOR   
THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THEY  
HAD WAS BECAUSE ALL POLICE      

01:02:51.307 --> 01:02:54.742
THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THEY  
HAD WAS BECAUSE ALL POLICE      
DEPARTMENTS USING EXXON CAMERAS 

01:02:54.744 --> 01:02:59.413
HAD WAS BECAUSE ALL POLICE      
DEPARTMENTS USING EXXON CAMERAS 
ARE THESE ALSO HAVING SOME KIND 

01:02:59.415 --> 01:03:00.148
DEPARTMENTS USING EXXON CAMERAS 
ARE THESE ALSO HAVING SOME KIND 
OF HEALTH PROBLEMS IF YOU PLAY  

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.483
ARE THESE ALSO HAVING SOME KIND 
OF HEALTH PROBLEMS IF YOU PLAY  
THE VIDEOS BACK AND THE ANSWER  

01:03:02.485 --> 01:03:09.790
OF HEALTH PROBLEMS IF YOU PLAY  
THE VIDEOS BACK AND THE ANSWER  
WAS NOT BECAUSE THE VIDEO IS    

01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:14.061
THE VIDEOS BACK AND THE ANSWER  
WAS NOT BECAUSE THE VIDEO IS    
BEING RECORDED AT FIXED RATE    

01:03:14.063 --> 01:03:18.099
WAS NOT BECAUSE THE VIDEO IS    
BEING RECORDED AT FIXED RATE    
MEANING THAT FRAME PER UNIT PER 

01:03:18.101 --> 01:03:21.902
BEING RECORDED AT FIXED RATE    
MEANING THAT FRAME PER UNIT PER 
SECOND AS FIXED RATE IF TWENTY  

01:03:21.904 --> 01:03:22.903
MEANING THAT FRAME PER UNIT PER 
SECOND AS FIXED RATE IF TWENTY  
OR THIRTY OR WHATEVER NUMBER    

01:03:22.905 --> 01:03:26.340
SECOND AS FIXED RATE IF TWENTY  
OR THIRTY OR WHATEVER NUMBER    
OF FRAMES PER SECOND THIS IS    

01:03:26.342 --> 01:03:29.743
OR THIRTY OR WHATEVER NUMBER    
OF FRAMES PER SECOND THIS IS    
WHAT YOU SEE NOW IF YOU GET THE 

01:03:29.745 --> 01:03:30.678
OF FRAMES PER SECOND THIS IS    
WHAT YOU SEE NOW IF YOU GET THE 
OLD CCTV OR IF YOU GET          

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.181
WHAT YOU SEE NOW IF YOU GET THE 
OLD CCTV OR IF YOU GET          
SOMETHING FROM YOUR PHONE OR    

01:03:33.183 --> 01:03:37.385
OLD CCTV OR IF YOU GET          
SOMETHING FROM YOUR PHONE OR    
FROM THE RING ON ON THE DOOR OR 

01:03:37.387 --> 01:03:41.055
SOMETHING FROM YOUR PHONE OR    
FROM THE RING ON ON THE DOOR OR 
SO THAT MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT    

01:03:41.057 --> 01:03:45.326
FROM THE RING ON ON THE DOOR OR 
SO THAT MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT    
FRAMES EVEN EVEN THE SAME VIDEO 

01:03:45.328 --> 01:03:48.229
SO THAT MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT    
FRAMES EVEN EVEN THE SAME VIDEO 
WOULD BE DONE AT DIFFERENT      

01:03:48.231 --> 01:03:48.629
FRAMES EVEN EVEN THE SAME VIDEO 
WOULD BE DONE AT DIFFERENT      
FRAMES.                         

01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:52.100
WOULD BE DONE AT DIFFERENT      
FRAMES.                         
SO IF YOU IF YOU PLAY IT AT A   

01:03:52.102 --> 01:03:56.003
FRAMES.                         
SO IF YOU IF YOU PLAY IT AT A   
PARTICULAR SPEED YOU LOSE THE   

01:03:56.005 --> 01:04:00.608
SO IF YOU IF YOU PLAY IT AT A   
PARTICULAR SPEED YOU LOSE THE   
NATURE OF OF THE VIDEO ITSELF   

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:01.409
PARTICULAR SPEED YOU LOSE THE   
NATURE OF OF THE VIDEO ITSELF   
AND YOU CAN MAKE A JUDGMENT     

01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:03.778
NATURE OF OF THE VIDEO ITSELF   
AND YOU CAN MAKE A JUDGMENT     
THAT IS GOING TO BE NOT HOLDING 

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.245
AND YOU CAN MAKE A JUDGMENT     
THAT IS GOING TO BE NOT HOLDING 
IN THE COURT.                   

01:04:04.247 --> 01:04:07.982
THAT IS GOING TO BE NOT HOLDING 
IN THE COURT.                   
>> SO YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT   

01:04:07.984 --> 01:04:10.185
IN THE COURT.                   
>> SO YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT   
THAT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

>> SO YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT   
THAT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.      
THANK YOU A A LOT OF PEOPLE     

01:04:14.724 --> 01:04:15.423
THAT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.      
THANK YOU A A LOT OF PEOPLE     
REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND TRY 

01:04:15.425 --> 01:04:21.762
THANK YOU A A LOT OF PEOPLE     
REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND TRY 
TO MAKE A TECHNICAL SCENARIO    

01:04:21.764 --> 01:04:22.797
REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND TRY 
TO MAKE A TECHNICAL SCENARIO    
WHERE WE CAN KIND OF DIGEST     

01:04:22.799 --> 01:04:25.099
TO MAKE A TECHNICAL SCENARIO    
WHERE WE CAN KIND OF DIGEST     
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.       

01:04:25.101 --> 01:04:26.334
WHERE WE CAN KIND OF DIGEST     
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.       
WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED     

01:04:26.336 --> 01:04:29.203
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.       
WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED     
AXUM INVESTIGATE.               

01:04:29.205 --> 01:04:33.440
WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED     
AXUM INVESTIGATE.               
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU A     

01:04:33.442 --> 01:04:36.110
AXUM INVESTIGATE.               
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU A     
REGULAR PERSON AND IT HAPPENS   

01:04:36.112 --> 01:04:37.077
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU A     
REGULAR PERSON AND IT HAPPENS   
ALL THE TIME YOU SEE A VIDEO    

01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:37.846
REGULAR PERSON AND IT HAPPENS   
ALL THE TIME YOU SEE A VIDEO    
THE VIDEO COULD BE FROM A       

01:04:37.848 --> 01:04:41.649
ALL THE TIME YOU SEE A VIDEO    
THE VIDEO COULD BE FROM A       
SITUATION WHERE A PERSON HAS A  

01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:42.250
THE VIDEO COULD BE FROM A       
SITUATION WHERE A PERSON HAS A  
CD PLAYER WHERE THEIR           

01:04:42.252 --> 01:04:45.586
SITUATION WHERE A PERSON HAS A

COLLECTIVE VIDEO OF AN INCIDENT 
THAT YOU SEE ON TV WHERE IT     

01:04:46.622 --> 01:04:49.757
COLLECTIVE VIDEO OF AN INCIDENT 
THAT YOU SEE ON TV WHERE IT     
INVOLVES AN OFFICER IT COULD BE 

01:04:49.759 --> 01:04:50.524
THAT YOU SEE ON TV WHERE IT     
INVOLVES AN OFFICER IT COULD BE 
INVOLVE A USE OF FORCE OR A     

01:04:50.526 --> 01:04:52.794
INVOLVES AN OFFICER IT COULD BE 
INVOLVE A USE OF FORCE OR A     
SHOOTING AND YOU SEE THE VIDEO

01:04:56.866 --> 01:05:00.334
AND WHAT YOU SEE IN THE VIDEO   
IS TAKEN FROM PERHAPS SOME      
SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T REALLY      

01:05:00.336 --> 01:05:01.135
IS TAKEN FROM PERHAPS SOME      
SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T REALLY      
CAPTURE THE REAL SPEED          

01:05:01.137 --> 01:05:04.438
SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T REALLY      
CAPTURE THE REAL SPEED          
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FRAMES PER  

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:04.706
CAPTURE THE REAL SPEED          
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FRAMES PER  
SECOND.                         

01:05:04.708 --> 01:05:08.242
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FRAMES PER  
SECOND.                         
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IS       

01:05:08.244 --> 01:05:08.976
SECOND.                         
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IS       
YOU'RE ACTUALLY MISSING WHAT    

01:05:08.978 --> 01:05:12.313
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IS       
YOU'RE ACTUALLY MISSING WHAT    
REALLY OCCURRED BECAUSE YOUR    

01:05:12.315 --> 01:05:13.281
YOU'RE ACTUALLY MISSING WHAT    
REALLY OCCURRED BECAUSE YOUR    
EYES ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPTURE    

01:05:13.283 --> 01:05:16.884
REALLY OCCURRED BECAUSE YOUR    
EYES ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPTURE    
THINGS THE WAY SOME YOUR EYES   

01:05:16.886 --> 01:05:18.953
EYES ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPTURE    
THINGS THE WAY SOME YOUR EYES   
CAN CAPTURE THINGS A LOT FASTER 

01:05:18.955 --> 01:05:19.888
THINGS THE WAY SOME YOUR EYES   
CAN CAPTURE THINGS A LOT FASTER 
REALITY DENHA SOMETIMES THE WAY 

01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:23.724
CAN CAPTURE THINGS A LOT FASTER 
REALITY DENHA SOMETIMES THE WAY 
A CAMERA SET UP IT'S SO FOR     

01:05:23.726 --> 01:05:27.761
REALITY DENHA SOMETIMES THE WAY 
A CAMERA SET UP IT'S SO FOR     
EXAMPLE, YOU SEE A PERSON       

01:05:27.763 --> 01:05:31.399
A CAMERA SET UP IT'S SO FOR     
EXAMPLE, YOU SEE A PERSON       
STRIKE SOMEONE BUT WHEN THEY    

01:05:31.401 --> 01:05:32.400
EXAMPLE, YOU SEE A PERSON       
STRIKE SOMEONE BUT WHEN THEY    
HAVE THE VIDEO YOU WILL NOT SEE 

01:05:32.402 --> 01:05:35.102
STRIKE SOMEONE BUT WHEN THEY    
HAVE THE VIDEO YOU WILL NOT SEE 
THE STRIKE OR YOU MAY SEE A     

01:05:35.104 --> 01:05:35.837
HAVE THE VIDEO YOU WILL NOT SEE 
THE STRIKE OR YOU MAY SEE A     
POLICE OFFICER STRIKE THEN THEY 

01:05:35.839 --> 01:05:39.106
THE STRIKE OR YOU MAY SEE A     
POLICE OFFICER STRIKE THEN THEY 
MAY RESPOND YOU I SEE IT AND    

01:05:39.108 --> 01:05:42.243
POLICE OFFICER STRIKE THEN THEY 
MAY RESPOND YOU I SEE IT AND    
YOU THINK THAT YOU SAW IT.      

01:05:42.245 --> 01:05:43.211
MAY RESPOND YOU I SEE IT AND    
YOU THINK THAT YOU SAW IT.      
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHAT EXXON      

01:05:43.213 --> 01:05:46.681
YOU THINK THAT YOU SAW IT.      
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHAT EXXON      
INVESTIGATE IS IT TAKES THE     

01:05:46.683 --> 01:05:47.682
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHAT EXXON      
INVESTIGATE IS IT TAKES THE     
ACTUAL REAL IT IT CAN IT CAN    

01:05:47.684 --> 01:05:51.318
INVESTIGATE IS IT TAKES THE     
ACTUAL REAL IT IT CAN IT CAN    
COMPRESS OR TAKE A LOOK AT THE  

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.721
ACTUAL REAL IT IT CAN IT CAN    
COMPRESS OR TAKE A LOOK AT THE  
ACTUAL FOOTAGE AND OFTENTIMES   

01:05:53.723 --> 01:05:54.655
COMPRESS OR TAKE A LOOK AT THE  
ACTUAL FOOTAGE AND OFTENTIMES   
IT CAN GET IN THE BACKGROUND    

01:05:54.657 --> 01:05:57.658
ACTUAL FOOTAGE AND OFTENTIMES   
IT CAN GET IN THE BACKGROUND    
AND ACTUALLY SEE SOMETIMES      

01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.526
IT CAN GET IN THE BACKGROUND    
AND ACTUALLY SEE SOMETIMES      
CREATE REAL TIME SPEED OF WHAT  

01:05:58.528 --> 01:06:01.596
AND ACTUALLY SEE SOMETIMES      
CREATE REAL TIME SPEED OF WHAT  
REALLY HAPPENS.                 

01:06:01.598 --> 01:06:06.034
CREATE REAL TIME SPEED OF WHAT  
REALLY HAPPENS.                 
SO IT REALLY IT REALLY IS A     

01:06:06.036 --> 01:06:06.901
REALLY HAPPENS.                 
SO IT REALLY IT REALLY IS A     
SCIENCE WITH RESPECT TO VIDEOS
