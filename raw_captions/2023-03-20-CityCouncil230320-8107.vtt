POTENTIALLY COULD BE SIX FEET   
ADDED RATHER THAN TWO AND A     
HALF FEET BECAUSE THE EXISTING  

00:25:19.892 --> 00:25:23.127
ADDED RATHER THAN TWO AND A     
HALF FEET BECAUSE THE EXISTING  
BEAMS ON THE BRIDGE THAT ARE

00:25:30.135 --> 00:25:31.035
FEET ACROSS FIVE FIVE FEET 11   
INCHES A LITTLE BIT MORE.       
SO IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AT      

00:25:31.037 --> 00:25:34.237

SO IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AT      
MINIMAL COST TO TO WIDEN THAT   

00:25:34.239 --> 00:25:34.571
SO IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AT

BASICALLY WHAT THIS ORDINANCE   
DOES IS AMEND THE HOUSING       

02:17:48.167 --> 02:17:52.035
BASICALLY WHAT THIS ORDINANCE   
DOES IS AMEND THE HOUSING       
CODE WITHIN THE CITY TO REQUIRE 

02:17:52.037 --> 02:17:52.636
DOES IS AMEND THE HOUSING

CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR.       

02:17:56.042 --> 02:17:59.009
RENTAL UNITS TO HAVE A          
CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR.       
IT&apos;S CURRENTLY NOT PART         

02:17:59.011 --> 02:17:59.676
CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR.       
IT&apos;S CURRENTLY NOT PART         
OF EXISTING RENTAL UNITS.       

02:17:59.678 --> 02:18:00.710
IT&apos;S CURRENTLY NOT PART         
OF EXISTING RENTAL UNITS.       
SO THE STATE DOES REQUIRE IF    

02:18:00.712 --> 02:18:03.814
OF EXISTING RENTAL UNITS.       
SO THE STATE DOES REQUIRE IF    
YOU ARE BUILDING A NEW RENTAL   

02:18:03.816 --> 02:18:04.815
SO THE STATE DOES REQUIRE IF    
YOU ARE BUILDING A NEW RENTAL   
UNIT THAT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE   

02:18:04.817 --> 02:18:07.418
YOU ARE BUILDING A NEW RENTAL   
UNIT THAT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE   
CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS.      

02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:08.652
UNIT THAT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE   
CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS.      
BUT AS WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT  

02:18:08.654 --> 02:18:11.054
CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS.      
BUT AS WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT  
OF EXISTING AND MUCH OLDER      

02:18:11.056 --> 02:18:11.988
BUT AS WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT  
OF EXISTING AND MUCH OLDER      
UNITS HERE IN ANN ARBOR FOR     

02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:14.157

WHICH THIS THAT DOES NOT APPLY  
.                               
SO THIS WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR   

02:18:15.327 --> 02:18:18.662

HERE.                           
THE ONE THING THAT I DID WANT   

02:18:24.003 --> 02:18:26.170

JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW IS THAT   
IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT SOME    

02:18:35.948 --> 02:18:38.582

WITHIN THE DWELLINGS            

02:18:43.388 --> 02:18:45.923
SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT CONTAINED  
WITHIN THE DWELLINGS            
SPECIFICALLY AND SO UNDER THE   

02:18:45.925 --> 02:18:46.590

SPECIFICALLY AND SO UNDER THE   
INITIAL VERSION OF THIS         

02:18:46.592 --> 02:18:47.324
SPECIFICALLY AND SO UNDER THE   
INITIAL VERSION OF THIS         
ORDINANCE THEY WOULD HAVE THOSE 

02:18:47.326 --> 02:18:50.193
INITIAL VERSION OF THIS         
ORDINANCE THEY WOULD HAVE THOSE 
UNITS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXEMPT    

02:18:50.195 --> 02:18:50.828
ORDINANCE THEY WOULD HAVE THOSE 
UNITS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXEMPT    
FROM HAVING CO2 DETECTION       

02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:51.695
UNITS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXEMPT    
FROM HAVING CO2 DETECTION       
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE FUEL   

02:18:51.697 --> 02:18:54.565
FROM HAVING CO2 DETECTION       
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE FUEL   
FIRED APPLIANCES WITHIN THE
