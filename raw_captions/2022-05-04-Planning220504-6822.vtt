WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION     
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.            

00:47:32.857 --> 00:47:33.656

01:20:50.819 --> 01:20:51.551
WE COULD CLEAR THE DECK AND     
DEDICATE OUR NEXT WORKING

OF THAT I THINK WOULD BE SORTED 

01:20:55.557 --> 01:20:57.690
FOR THE UDC AND THEN SOME       
OF THAT I THINK WOULD BE SORTED 
IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT OUR      

01:20:57.692 --> 01:20:58.359
OF THAT I THINK WOULD BE SORTED 
IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT OUR

01:20:58.361 --> 01:20:59.026
IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT OUR

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COMMISSIONER, JUST I LIKE    
THIS IDEA OF AN UNSETTLING      

01:27:48.803 --> 01:27:52.372
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COMMISSIONER, JUST I LIKE    
THIS IDEA OF AN UNSETTLING      
CONVERSATION AS OFTEN WHEN      

01:27:52.374 --> 01:27:56.176
THIS IDEA OF AN UNSETTLING      
CONVERSATION AS OFTEN WHEN      
THERE&amp;apos;S A POTLUCK OR EVEN A     

01:27:56.178 --> 01:27:56.977
CONVERSATION AS OFTEN WHEN      
THERE&amp;apos;S A POTLUCK OR EVEN A     
REVERSE POTLUCK, I&amp;apos;M A LITTLE   

01:27:56.979 --> 01:27:57.644
THERE&amp;apos;S A POTLUCK OR EVEN A     
REVERSE POTLUCK, I&amp;apos;M A LITTLE   
DAUNTED THAT MY OFFERING MAY    

01:27:57.646 --> 01:27:59.712
REVERSE POTLUCK, I&amp;apos;M A LITTLE   
DAUNTED THAT MY OFFERING MAY    
NOT BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE THE    

01:27:59.714 --> 01:28:00.413
DAUNTED THAT MY OFFERING MAY    
NOT BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE THE    
IDEA OF READING THROUGH THE UDC 

01:28:00.415 --> 01:28:03.015
NOT BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE THE    
IDEA OF READING THROUGH THE UDC 
AND FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT      

01:28:03.017 --> 01:28:03.850
IDEA OF READING THROUGH THE UDC 
AND FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT      
FEELS LIKE MORE THAN A          

01:28:03.852 --> 01:28:06.886
AND FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT      
FEELS LIKE MORE THAN A          
WEEKEND&amp;apos;S HOMEWORK.             

01:28:06.888 --> 01:28:10.990
FEELS LIKE MORE THAN A          
WEEKEND&amp;apos;S HOMEWORK.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT  

01:28:10.992 --> 01:28:11.858
WEEKEND&amp;apos;S HOMEWORK.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT  
A NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE COME    

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:12.125
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT  
A NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE COME    
UP.                             

01:28:12.127 --> 01:28:15.395
A NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE COME    
UP.                             
SO I KNOW THAT DURING THE       

01:28:15.397 --> 01:28:18.898
UP.                             
SO I KNOW THAT DURING THE       
DISCUSSION OF ADIEUS TWO YEARS  

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:19.832
SO I KNOW THAT DURING THE       
DISCUSSION OF ADIEUS TWO YEARS  
AGO THAT RESTRICTION ON THE     

01:28:19.834 --> 01:28:23.503
DISCUSSION OF ADIEUS TWO YEARS  
AGO THAT RESTRICTION ON THE     
NUMBER OF UNRELATED PEOPLE THAT 

01:28:23.505 --> 01:28:27.040
AGO THAT RESTRICTION ON THE     
NUMBER OF UNRELATED PEOPLE THAT 
CAN LIVE IN A PLACE BECAUSE WE  

01:28:27.042 --> 01:28:28.041
NUMBER OF UNRELATED PEOPLE THAT 
CAN LIVE IN A PLACE BECAUSE WE  
HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS  

01:28:28.043 --> 01:28:31.077
CAN LIVE IN A PLACE BECAUSE WE  
HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS  
OF THE 82 AND THE MAIN HOUSE.   

01:28:31.079 --> 01:28:38.118
HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS  
OF THE 82 AND THE MAIN HOUSE.   
SO THAT HAS COME UP AND THERE   

01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.534
SEEMS TO BE AN APPETITE TO      
THINK ABOUT WHAT PURPOSE THAT   
IS SERVING AND WHAT SORTS       

01:28:54.536 --> 01:28:55.334
THINK ABOUT WHAT PURPOSE THAT   
IS SERVING AND WHAT SORTS       
OF NORMATIVE HOUSEHOLD FORMS IT 

01:28:55.336 --> 01:28:56.103
IS SERVING AND WHAT SORTS       
OF NORMATIVE HOUSEHOLD FORMS IT 
IS ENFORCING.                   

01:28:56.105 --> 01:28:57.303
OF NORMATIVE HOUSEHOLD FORMS IT 
IS ENFORCING.                   
AND SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING  

01:28:57.305 --> 01:28:57.904
IS ENFORCING.                   
AND SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING  
THAT I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE ALREADY      

01:28:57.906 --> 01:28:58.371
AND SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING  
THAT I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE ALREADY      
TALKED ABOUT.                   

01:28:58.373 --> 01:28:59.038
THAT I THINK WE&amp;apos;VE ALREADY      
TALKED ABOUT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE      

01:28:59.040 --> 01:28:59.773
TALKED ABOUT.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE      
PROBABLY OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT 

01:28:59.775 --> 01:29:00.540
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE      
PROBABLY OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT 
THAT WE THAT HAVE COME UP       

01:29:00.542 --> 01:29:01.207
PROBABLY OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT 
THAT WE THAT HAVE COME UP       
BEFORE THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO    

01:29:01.209 --> 01:29:01.941
THAT WE THAT HAVE COME UP       
BEFORE THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO    
VISIT IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY.      

01:29:01.943 --> 01:29:02.542
BEFORE THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO    
VISIT IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND LIKE YOU SAID,           

01:29:02.544 --> 01:29:03.210
VISIT IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND LIKE YOU SAID,           
COMMISSIONER, GETTING SOME

MIGHT BE LESS IMPACTFUL AND     

01:33:07.022 --> 01:33:07.420
WORK TO BE DONE AND SOME THINGS 
MIGHT BE LESS IMPACTFUL AND     
BOTH SINGLE.                    

01:33:07.422 --> 01:33:07.887
MIGHT BE LESS IMPACTFUL AND     
BOTH SINGLE.                    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CORRECT.                     

01:33:07.889 --> 01:33:15.695
BOTH SINGLE.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.501
MAXIMUMS BUT I LIKE ZONING      
BEFORE PARKING MAXIMUMS AND     
THEN AT LEAST WE GET THE FIRST  

01:33:22.503 --> 01:33:23.269
BEFORE PARKING MAXIMUMS AND     
THEN AT LEAST WE GET THE FIRST  
ROUND OF THINGS OUT TO FIGURE   

01:33:23.271 --> 01:33:26.305
THEN AT LEAST WE GET THE FIRST  
ROUND OF THINGS OUT TO FIGURE   
OUT WHAT NEEDS TO MAP INTO THIS 

01:33:26.307 --> 01:33:29.942
ROUND OF THINGS OUT TO FIGURE   
OUT WHAT NEEDS TO MAP INTO THIS 
LIST AND WHAT THEN BECOMES      

01:33:29.944 --> 01:33:30.710
OUT WHAT NEEDS TO MAP INTO THIS 
LIST AND WHAT THEN BECOMES      
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE LIST        

01:33:30.712 --> 01:33:33.780
