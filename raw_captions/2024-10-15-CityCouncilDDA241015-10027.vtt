INFORMED AND EQUITABLE WAY AND  
WE REALLY WANTED TO GET A GOOD  
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S         

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:44.946
WE REALLY WANTED TO GET A GOOD  
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S         
CURRENTLY HAPPENING AT THE CURB 

00:04:44.948 --> 00:04:45.179
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S         
CURRENTLY HAPPENING AT THE CURB 
.                               

00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:46.514
CURRENTLY HAPPENING AT THE CURB 
.                               
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST A  

00:04:46.516 --> 00:04:49.517
.                               
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST A  
FEW OF THE KEY FINDINGS FROM    

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:52.754
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST A  
FEW OF THE KEY FINDINGS FROM    
THAT STUDY.                     

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:54.022
FEW OF THE KEY FINDINGS FROM    
THAT STUDY.                     
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE   

00:04:54.024 --> 00:05:00.162
THAT STUDY.                     
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE   
CONSULTANT TEAM                 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.344
                WAS HAPPY TO    
LET US KNOW THAT WE THE ANN     
ARBOR HAS ALREADY MADE SOME     

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:17.045
LET US KNOW THAT WE THE ANN     
ARBOR HAS ALREADY MADE SOME     
STRIDES WHEN IT COMES TO        

00:05:17.047 --> 00:05:17.579
ARBOR HAS ALREADY MADE SOME     
STRIDES WHEN IT COMES TO        
CURBSIDE MANAGEMENT.            

00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:18.180
STRIDES WHEN IT COMES TO        
CURBSIDE MANAGEMENT.            
>> SO WE'VE LONG RECOGNIZED     

00:05:18.182 --> 00:05:19.047
CURBSIDE MANAGEMENT.            
>> SO WE'VE LONG RECOGNIZED     
THAT OUR CURBSIDE IS FOR MORE   

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:19.714
>> SO WE'VE LONG RECOGNIZED     
THAT OUR CURBSIDE IS FOR MORE   
THAN JUST STORING VEHICLES,     

00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:20.315
THAT OUR CURBSIDE IS FOR MORE   
THAN JUST STORING VEHICLES,     
MORE THAN JUST PARKING.         

00:05:20.317 --> 00:05:21.049
THAN JUST STORING VEHICLES,     
MORE THAN JUST PARKING.         
THERE'S HIGHER USE FOR THAT     

00:05:21.051 --> 00:05:21.382
MORE THAN JUST PARKING.         
THERE'S HIGHER USE FOR THAT     
CURB.                           

00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:22.083
THERE'S HIGHER USE FOR THAT     
CURB.                           
SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE   

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:22.684
CURB.                           
SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE   
HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THE        

00:05:22.686 --> 00:05:23.418
SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE   
HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THE        
CURBSIDE THINGS LIKE ADDING     

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.151
HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THE        
CURBSIDE THINGS LIKE ADDING     
BIKE LANES WITH EVERY PROJECT   

00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:24.886
CURBSIDE THINGS LIKE ADDING     
BIKE LANES WITH EVERY PROJECT   
WE TYPICALLY LOOK AT ADDING     

00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:27.222
BIKE LANES WITH EVERY PROJECT   
WE TYPICALLY LOOK AT ADDING     
LOADING ZONES AND DROP OFF PICK 

00:05:27.224 --> 00:05:27.689
WE TYPICALLY LOOK AT ADDING     
LOADING ZONES AND DROP OFF PICK 
UP AREAS.                       

00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:28.556
LOADING ZONES AND DROP OFF PICK 
UP AREAS.                       
SO WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED      

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:31.726
UP AREAS.                       
SO WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED      
MOVING IN A DIRECTION THAT A    

00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:32.393
SO WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED      
MOVING IN A DIRECTION THAT A    
LOT OF COMMUNITIES OUR          

00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:34.962
MOVING IN A DIRECTION THAT A    
LOT OF COMMUNITIES OUR          
CONSULTANT TEAM WAS WORKING     

00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:35.797
LOT OF COMMUNITIES OUR          
CONSULTANT TEAM WAS WORKING     
WITH ARE JUST STARTING TO THINK 

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:36.130
CONSULTANT TEAM WAS WORKING     
WITH ARE JUST STARTING TO THINK 
ABOUT.                          

00:05:36.132 --> 00:05:37.999
WITH ARE JUST STARTING TO THINK 
ABOUT.                          
SO THAT WAS POSITIVE.           

00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:39.100
ABOUT.                          
SO THAT WAS POSITIVE.           
THE STUDY THE DATA FROM THE     

00:05:39.102 --> 00:05:43.305
SO THAT WAS POSITIVE.           
THE STUDY THE DATA FROM THE     
STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT THE      

00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:44.172
THE STUDY THE DATA FROM THE     
STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT THE      
MAJORITY OF OUR STAYS AT THE    

00:05:44.174 --> 00:05:47.108
STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT THE      
MAJORITY OF OUR STAYS AT THE    
CURB ARE SHORT TERM SO ABOUT 60 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.411
MAJORITY OF OUR STAYS AT THE    
CURB ARE SHORT TERM SO ABOUT 60 
PERCENT OF PEOPLE PARKING AT    

00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:51.345
CURB ARE SHORT TERM SO ABOUT 60 
PERCENT OF PEOPLE PARKING AT    
THE CURB ARE PARKING FOR UNDER  

00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:54.549
PERCENT OF PEOPLE PARKING AT    
THE CURB ARE PARKING FOR UNDER  
FIFTEEN MINUTES AND ABOUT 20    

00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:55.283
THE CURB ARE PARKING FOR UNDER  
FIFTEEN MINUTES AND ABOUT 20    
PERCENT OF PARKING FOR LESS     

00:05:55.285 --> 00:05:57.451
FIFTEEN MINUTES AND ABOUT 20    
PERCENT OF PARKING FOR LESS     
THAN TWO MINUTES.               

00:05:57.453 --> 00:05:58.386
PERCENT OF PARKING FOR LESS     
THAN TWO MINUTES.               
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THE     

00:05:58.388 --> 00:06:02.456
THAN TWO MINUTES.               
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THE     
CURB IS ACTUALLY MEETING THE    

00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:05.426
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THE     
CURB IS ACTUALLY MEETING THE    
NEEDS AT THE CURBSIDE BECAUSE   

00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:06.127
CURB IS ACTUALLY MEETING THE    
NEEDS AT THE CURBSIDE BECAUSE   
PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY PARKING    

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.461
NEEDS AT THE CURBSIDE BECAUSE   
PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY PARKING    
ANYWHERE.                       

00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:09.931
PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY PARKING    
ANYWHERE.                       
SO ALTHOUGH THE CURB IS MEETING 

00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:10.665
ANYWHERE.                       
SO ALTHOUGH THE CURB IS MEETING 
THE NEEDS, IT'S CREATING OTHER  

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:10.999
SO ALTHOUGH THE CURB IS MEETING 
THE NEEDS, IT'S CREATING OTHER  
PROBLEMS.                       

00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:13.635
THE NEEDS, IT'S CREATING OTHER  
PROBLEMS.                       
>> SO WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE  

00:06:13.637 --> 00:06:14.302
PROBLEMS.                       
>> SO WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE  
PARKING IN LOADING ZONES.       

00:06:14.304 --> 00:06:17.505
>> SO WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE  
PARKING IN LOADING ZONES.       
PEOPLE ARE PARKING IN DRIVEWAYS 

00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:20.508
PARKING IN LOADING ZONES.       
PEOPLE ARE PARKING IN DRIVEWAYS 
AT FIRE HYDRANTS.               

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.609
PEOPLE ARE PARKING IN DRIVEWAYS 
AT FIRE HYDRANTS.               
>> SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO   

00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:24.412
AT FIRE HYDRANTS.               
>> SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO   
REALLY LOOK AT OUR SHORT TERM   

00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:25.280
>> SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO   
REALLY LOOK AT OUR SHORT TERM   
PARKING INVENTORY, THESE SHORT  

00:06:25.282 --> 00:06:28.950
REALLY LOOK AT OUR SHORT TERM   
PARKING INVENTORY, THESE SHORT  
TERM STAYS ARE ALSO VERY        

00:06:28.952 --> 00:06:32.420
PARKING INVENTORY, THESE SHORT  
TERM STAYS ARE ALSO VERY        
DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE.           

00:06:32.422 --> 00:06:36.290
TERM STAYS ARE ALSO VERY        
DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE.           
SO OUR ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE 

00:06:36.292 --> 00:06:40.528
DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE.           
SO OUR ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE 
TYPICALLY IN THE PAST MANY      

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.429
SO OUR ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE 
TYPICALLY IN THE PAST MANY      
YEARS ARE MANAGING A CURB THAT  

00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:45.166
TYPICALLY IN THE PAST MANY      
YEARS ARE MANAGING A CURB THAT  
HAS ABOUT TWO HOUR PARKING IS   

00:06:45.168 --> 00:06:45.767
YEARS ARE MANAGING A CURB THAT  
HAS ABOUT TWO HOUR PARKING IS   
PRETTY MUCH OUR NORM.           

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:47.969
HAS ABOUT TWO HOUR PARKING IS   
PRETTY MUCH OUR NORM.           
>> SO A DIFFERENT STRATEGY IS   

00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:48.703
PRETTY MUCH OUR NORM.           
>> SO A DIFFERENT STRATEGY IS   
REQUIRED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING    

00:06:48.705 --> 00:06:51.439

REQUIRED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING    
ABOUT THESE REALLY SHORT TERM   

00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:55.676
REQUIRED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING    
ABOUT THESE REALLY SHORT TERM   
DAYS AND THE OTHER PIECE

PLAN PROCESS.                   
WE LOOK AT THOSE AFTER THE FACT 
SO THAT KIND OF GIVES A LITTLE  

00:16:22.946 --> 00:16:23.610
WE LOOK AT THOSE AFTER THE FACT 
SO THAT KIND OF GIVES A LITTLE  
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY.           

00:16:23.612 --> 00:16:26.280
SO THAT KIND OF GIVES A LITTLE  
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY.           
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S     

00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:26.947
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY.           
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S     
BEING LOOKED AT.                

00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:27.614
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S     
BEING LOOKED AT.                
I KNOW THAT ONE.                

00:16:27.616 --> 00:16:29.750
BEING LOOKED AT.                
I KNOW THAT ONE.                
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE    

00:16:29.752 --> 00:16:30.518
I KNOW THAT ONE.                
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE    
BEEN ON PLANNING COMMISSION BUT 

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.252
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE    
BEEN ON PLANNING COMMISSION BUT 
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THERE   

00:16:31.254 --> 00:16:33.588
BEEN ON PLANNING COMMISSION BUT 
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THERE   
WASN'T NECESSARILY A CLEAR WAY  

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.455
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THERE   
WASN'T NECESSARILY A CLEAR WAY  
TO REVIEW THOSE PROJECTS AT THE 

00:16:34.457 --> 00:16:34.655
WASN'T NECESSARILY A CLEAR WAY  
TO REVIEW THOSE PROJECTS AT THE

TO REVIEW THOSE PROJECTS AT THE 
TIME.                           
SO THAT'S IMPROVED.             

00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:38.392
TIME.                           
SO THAT'S IMPROVED.             
IT'S BEING TALKED ABOUT IN AS A

SO THAT'S IMPROVED.             
IT'S BEING TALKED ABOUT IN AS A 
MATTER OF FACT STAFF WILL BE AT 

00:16:41.864 --> 00:16:42.497
IT'S BEING TALKED ABOUT IN AS A

IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE.          
SO IN REGARDS TO THE CURB USE   
STUDY, I WAS WONDERING DID DID  

00:16:58.148 --> 00:17:01.549
SO IN REGARDS TO THE CURB USE   
STUDY, I WAS WONDERING DID DID  
CURB USE BEHAVIOR CHANGE ON     

00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:02.350
STUDY, I WAS WONDERING DID DID  
CURB USE BEHAVIOR CHANGE ON     
CURB ILLUSTRATES LIKE WHAT WE   

00:17:02.352 --> 00:17:06.153
CURB USE BEHAVIOR CHANGE ON     
CURB ILLUSTRATES LIKE WHAT WE   
DID WITH STATE STREET UM OR SO  

00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:09.557
CURB ILLUSTRATES LIKE WHAT WE   
DID WITH STATE STREET UM OR SO  
WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY THAT     

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:13.293
DID WITH STATE STREET UM OR SO  
WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY THAT     
WASN'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED   

00:17:13.295 --> 00:17:14.628
WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY THAT     
WASN'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED   
IN THE STUDY BUT I WOULD SAY I  

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:21.335
WASN'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED   
IN THE STUDY BUT I WOULD SAY I  
THINK THE BEHAVIOR ON STATES    

00:17:21.337 --> 00:17:22.669
IN THE STUDY BUT I WOULD SAY I  
THINK THE BEHAVIOR ON STATES    
WHAT WE DID AND WE WERE VERY    

00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:25.706
THINK THE BEHAVIOR ON STATES    
WHAT WE DID AND WE WERE VERY    
COGNIZANT OF THE NEED FOR       

00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:26.340
WHAT WE DID AND WE WERE VERY    
COGNIZANT OF THE NEED FOR       
ADDITIONAL LOADING ZONES ON     

00:17:26.342 --> 00:17:30.210
COGNIZANT OF THE NEED FOR       
ADDITIONAL LOADING ZONES ON     
THAT STREET SO WE ADDED LOADING 

00:17:30.212 --> 00:17:32.880
ADDITIONAL LOADING ZONES ON     
THAT STREET SO WE ADDED LOADING 
ZONES ON STATE AND AROUND THE   

00:17:32.882 --> 00:17:36.617
THAT STREET SO WE ADDED LOADING 
ZONES ON STATE AND AROUND THE   
CORNER ON MAINARD SO AND I      

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:37.417
ZONES ON STATE AND AROUND THE   
CORNER ON MAINARD SO AND I      
HAVEN'T HEARD PLAINT SO I       

00:17:37.419 --> 00:17:40.721
CORNER ON MAINARD SO AND I      
HAVEN'T HEARD PLAINT SO I       
ACTUALLY CAN'T REALLY SPEAK WHO 

00:17:40.723 --> 00:17:41.322
HAVEN'T HEARD PLAINT SO I       
ACTUALLY CAN'T REALLY SPEAK WHO 
IS IT WORKING?                  

00:17:41.324 --> 00:17:44.358
ACTUALLY CAN'T REALLY SPEAK WHO 
IS IT WORKING?                  
BUT I WAS WONDERING IF BY       

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.392
IS IT WORKING?                  
BUT I WAS WONDERING IF BY       
HAVING HER BLISTERY IT'S IT MAY 

00:17:45.394 --> 00:17:48.662
BUT I WAS WONDERING IF BY       
HAVING HER BLISTERY IT'S IT MAY 
DISCOURAGE SHORT TERM PARKING   

00:17:48.664 --> 00:17:49.564
HAVING HER BLISTERY IT'S IT MAY 
DISCOURAGE SHORT TERM PARKING   
WHERE I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT 

00:17:49.566 --> 00:17:52.433
DISCOURAGE SHORT TERM PARKING   
WHERE I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT 
IF THAT COULD BE A FACTOR UM    

00:17:52.435 --> 00:17:53.367
WHERE I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT 
IF THAT COULD BE A FACTOR UM    
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT WASN'T      

00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:53.967
IF THAT COULD BE A FACTOR UM    
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT WASN'T      
SPECIFICALLY STUDIED.           

00:17:53.969 --> 00:17:56.303
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT WASN'T      
SPECIFICALLY STUDIED.           
SO THE OTHER THING IS THAT UM   

00:17:56.305 --> 00:17:57.038
SPECIFICALLY STUDIED.           
SO THE OTHER THING IS THAT UM   
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU WERE   

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.773
SO THE OTHER THING IS THAT UM   
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU WERE   
WORKING ON CREATING ACCESSIBLE  

00:17:59.775 --> 00:18:00.407
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU WERE   
WORKING ON CREATING ACCESSIBLE  
PATHWAYS FROM ACCESSIBLE        

00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:04.244
WORKING ON CREATING ACCESSIBLE  
PATHWAYS FROM ACCESSIBLE        
PARKING SPACES INTO AREAS LIKE  

00:18:04.246 --> 00:18:04.945
PATHWAYS FROM ACCESSIBLE        
PARKING SPACES INTO AREAS LIKE  
THE STREET CLOSURES ON MAIN     

00:18:04.947 --> 00:18:05.346
PARKING SPACES INTO AREAS LIKE  
THE STREET CLOSURES ON MAIN     
STREET.                         

00:18:05.348 --> 00:18:07.814
THE STREET CLOSURES ON MAIN     
STREET.

>> IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS I  

00:18:12.154 --> 00:18:12.953
THE BUSINESS DISTRICTS.         
>> IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS I  
KNOW THAT ACCESSIBLE PATHWAYS   

00:18:12.955 --> 00:18:15.789
>> IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS I  
KNOW THAT ACCESSIBLE PATHWAYS   
IS SOMETHING THAT CITIES WILL   

00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:16.490
KNOW THAT ACCESSIBLE PATHWAYS   
IS SOMETHING THAT CITIES WILL   
INCORPORATE AND I WONDER IF     

00:18:16.492 --> 00:18:17.424
IS SOMETHING THAT CITIES WILL   
INCORPORATE AND I WONDER IF     
THAT IS GOING TO BE PART        

00:18:17.426 --> 00:18:20.027
INCORPORATE AND I WONDER IF     
THAT IS GOING TO BE PART        
OF SOME OF THESE ADA            

00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.494
THAT IS GOING TO BE PART        
OF SOME OF THESE ADA            
IMPROVEMENTS.                   

00:18:20.496 --> 00:18:23.096
OF SOME OF THESE ADA            
IMPROVEMENTS.                   
UM, WE HAVE NOT SPECIFICALLY    

00:18:23.098 --> 00:18:27.100
IMPROVEMENTS.                   
UM, WE HAVE NOT SPECIFICALLY    
ADDRESSED THAT AND I THINK WHEN 

00:18:27.102 --> 00:18:28.168
UM, WE HAVE NOT SPECIFICALLY    
ADDRESSED THAT AND I THINK WHEN 
THAT CAME UP MAYBE LAST YEAR OR 

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.305
ADDRESSED THAT AND I THINK WHEN 
THAT CAME UP MAYBE LAST YEAR OR 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I CAN'T   

00:18:31.307 --> 00:18:32.106
THAT CAME UP MAYBE LAST YEAR OR 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I CAN'T   
REMEMBER NOW BUT IT WAS A       

00:18:32.108 --> 00:18:35.742
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I CAN'T   
REMEMBER NOW BUT IT WAS A       
MATTER OF OR THERE WERE A LOT   

00:18:35.744 --> 00:18:37.978
REMEMBER NOW BUT IT WAS A       
MATTER OF OR THERE WERE A LOT   
OF FACTORS BUT ONE FACTOR WAS   

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.646
MATTER OF OR THERE WERE A LOT   
OF FACTORS BUT ONE FACTOR WAS   
DETERMINING WHAT PATH SOMEONE   

00:18:38.648 --> 00:18:41.983
OF FACTORS BUT ONE FACTOR WAS   
DETERMINING WHAT PATH SOMEONE   
IS ACTUALLY TAKING RIGHT.       

00:18:41.985 --> 00:18:43.317
DETERMINING WHAT PATH SOMEONE   
IS ACTUALLY TAKING RIGHT.       
SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NEW TO 

00:18:43.319 --> 00:18:46.787
IS ACTUALLY TAKING RIGHT.       
SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NEW TO 
REPORT ON THAT FRONT AND YOU    

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:47.488
SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NEW TO 
REPORT ON THAT FRONT AND YOU    
GUYS DID AT THAT TIME AD        

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:47.888
REPORT ON THAT FRONT AND YOU    
GUYS DID AT THAT TIME AD        
ACCESSIBLE.

GUYS DID AT THAT TIME AD        
ACCESSIBLE.                     
>> WE ADDED ACCESSIBLE SPACES.  

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:51.492
ACCESSIBLE.                     
>> WE ADDED ACCESSIBLE SPACES.  
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH      

00:18:51.494 --> 00:18:54.361
>> WE ADDED ACCESSIBLE SPACES.  
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH      
PATHWAYS BUT WE ADDED           

00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:55.062
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH      
PATHWAYS BUT WE ADDED           
ACCESSIBLE SPACES WHERE WHICH I 

00:18:55.064 --> 00:18:56.063
PATHWAYS BUT WE ADDED           
ACCESSIBLE SPACES WHERE WHICH I 
THINK REALLY HELPED.            

00:18:56.065 --> 00:19:00.600
ACCESSIBLE SPACES WHERE WHICH I 
THINK REALLY HELPED.            
I THINK YOU ONE OF THE          

00:19:00.602 --> 00:19:01.535
THINK REALLY HELPED.            
I THINK YOU ONE OF THE          
PERSISTENT ISSUES THAT A LOT    

00:19:01.537 --> 00:19:04.705
I THINK YOU ONE OF THE          
PERSISTENT ISSUES THAT A LOT    
OF UH, COMPLAINTS ABOUT ON      

00:19:04.707 --> 00:19:05.505
PERSISTENT ISSUES THAT A LOT    
OF UH, COMPLAINTS ABOUT ON      
COUNCIL IS PEOPLE PARKING ON    

00:19:05.507 --> 00:19:08.642
OF UH, COMPLAINTS ABOUT ON      
COUNCIL IS PEOPLE PARKING ON    
THE BIKE WHETHER THAT'S WITHIN  

00:19:08.644 --> 00:19:09.376
COUNCIL IS PEOPLE PARKING ON    
THE BIKE WHETHER THAT'S WITHIN  
THE DAY TO DAY BALANCE OR NOT.  

00:19:09.378 --> 00:19:12.713
THE BIKE WHETHER THAT'S WITHIN  
THE DAY TO DAY BALANCE OR NOT.  
BUT SPECIFICALLY AS RELATES TO  

00:19:12.715 --> 00:19:13.381
THE DAY TO DAY BALANCE OR NOT.  
BUT SPECIFICALLY AS RELATES TO  
DELIA, I'M WONDERING HOW THAT   

00:19:13.383 --> 00:19:16.483
BUT SPECIFICALLY AS RELATES TO  
DELIA, I'M WONDERING HOW THAT   
SHORT TERM PARKING FOR LIKE     

00:19:16.485 --> 00:19:17.217
DELIA, I'M WONDERING HOW THAT   
SHORT TERM PARKING FOR LIKE     
AMAZON DELIVERY VEHICLES WHICH  

00:19:17.219 --> 00:19:19.753
SHORT TERM PARKING FOR LIKE     
AMAZON DELIVERY VEHICLES WHICH  
I SEE OFTEN KIND OF JUST QUICK  

00:19:19.755 --> 00:19:20.488
AMAZON DELIVERY VEHICLES WHICH  
I SEE OFTEN KIND OF JUST QUICK  
PULL OVER AND AS YOU NOTED,     

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:24.591
I SEE OFTEN KIND OF JUST QUICK  
PULL OVER AND AS YOU NOTED,     
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE  

00:19:24.593 --> 00:19:25.226
PULL OVER AND AS YOU NOTED,     
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE  
BECAUSE BY THE TIME SOMEONE     

00:19:25.228 --> 00:19:27.661
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE  
BECAUSE BY THE TIME SOMEONE     
CALLS IN THAT'S DONE BUT IT'S   

00:19:27.663 --> 00:19:28.362
BECAUSE BY THE TIME SOMEONE     
CALLS IN THAT'S DONE BUT IT'S   
REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.   

00:19:28.364 --> 00:19:31.665
CALLS IN THAT'S DONE BUT IT'S   
REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.   
SO HOW DOES THAT FIT IN WITH    

00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:32.432
REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.   
SO HOW DOES THAT FIT IN WITH    
WHAT I UNDERSTAND WITH THE SITE 

00:19:32.434 --> 00:19:35.303
SO HOW DOES THAT FIT IN WITH    
WHAT I UNDERSTAND WITH THE SITE
