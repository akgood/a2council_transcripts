SO THERE IS A TREE BACK HERE    
THAT THAT IS NOT A HEALTHY TREE

THAT THAT IS NOT A HEALTHY TREE

00:39:42.642 --> 00:39:43.708
THAT THAT IS NOT A HEALTHY TREE

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:47.244
OR A SAVABLE TREE.              
SO PUTTING THE GARAGE IN ITS

THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE          
APPLICATION AND I THINK THAT    

00:39:57.957 --> 00:39:58.790
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE          
APPLICATION AND I THINK THAT    
THE THE THE THE ONE THING THAT  

00:39:58.792 --> 00:40:01.726
APPLICATION AND I THINK THAT    
THE THE THE THE ONE THING THAT  
GAVE ME PAUSE WAS THE CREATIVE  

00:40:01.728 --> 00:40:05.196
THE THE THE THE ONE THING THAT  
GAVE ME PAUSE WAS THE CREATIVE  
USE OF THE ROOFING TO WRAP      

00:40:05.198 --> 00:40:05.863
GAVE ME PAUSE WAS THE CREATIVE  
USE OF THE ROOFING TO WRAP      
AROUND THAT WINDOW ON THE       

00:40:05.865 --> 00:40:08.732
USE OF THE ROOFING TO WRAP

AROUND THAT WINDOW ON THE       
SECOND FLOOR.

BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE

01:07:36.481 --> 01:07:37.213
OF THE ADDITIONS.               
IT&apos;S INSET AT THE NORTHWEST

01:07:37.215 --> 01:07:40.182
IT&apos;S INSET AT THE NORTHWEST

BUMPS BACK OUT TO ALIGN WITH    
IT.                             

01:07:40.451 --> 01:07:43.253
BUMPS BACK OUT TO ALIGN WITH    
IT.                             
AND THIS IS THAT BASEMENT DOOR  

01:07:43.255 --> 01:07:44.120
IT.                             
AND THIS IS THAT BASEMENT DOOR  
AND IT&apos;S WORKING AROUND THE     

01:07:44.122 --> 01:07:47.523
AND THIS IS THAT BASEMENT DOOR  
AND IT&apos;S WORKING AROUND THE     
BASEMENT DOOR NORMALLY I WOULD  

01:07:47.525 --> 01:07:51.227
AND IT&apos;S WORKING AROUND THE     
BASEMENT DOOR NORMALLY I WOULD  
SAY I WOULDN&apos;T RECOMMEND DOING  

01:07:51.229 --> 01:07:52.095
BASEMENT DOOR NORMALLY I WOULD  
SAY I WOULDN&apos;T RECOMMEND DOING  
THIS BUMPING BACK OUT HERE BUT  

01:07:52.097 --> 01:07:55.798
SAY I WOULDN&apos;T RECOMMEND DOING  
THIS BUMPING BACK OUT HERE BUT  
THERE&apos;S SO LIMITED IN THE WIDTH 

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.565
THIS BUMPING BACK OUT HERE BUT  
THERE&apos;S SO LIMITED IN THE WIDTH 
OF THIS RARE EDITION ANYWAY IT  

01:07:56.567 --> 01:08:02.972
THERE&apos;S SO LIMITED IN THE WIDTH 
OF THIS RARE EDITION ANYWAY IT  
WOULD BECOME JUST A BOWLING     

01:08:16.453 --> 01:08:19.054
ALLEY OF A ROOM IF THEY KEPT IT 
INSET ALL THE WAY BACK AND JUST 
PUSHED IT OUT EVEN FARTHER.     

01:08:19.056 --> 01:08:19.622
INSET ALL THE WAY BACK AND JUST 
PUSHED IT OUT EVEN FARTHER.     
SO I THINK THAT IT&apos;S            

01:08:19.624 --> 01:08:20.423
PUSHED IT OUT EVEN FARTHER.     
SO I THINK THAT IT&apos;S            
APPROPRIATE TO MAKE A LITTLE    

01:08:20.425 --> 01:08:21.090
SO I THINK THAT IT&apos;S            
APPROPRIATE TO MAKE A LITTLE    
CONCESSION THAT THEY AND THEY   

01:08:21.092 --> 01:08:21.824
APPROPRIATE TO MAKE A LITTLE
