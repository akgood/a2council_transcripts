TO THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT    
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT          

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.185
TO THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT    
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT          
OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE

THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY AT      

01:12:27.442 --> 01:12:27.773
RUNWAY IMPROVEMENTS WOULD PUT   
THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY AT      
RISK.                           

01:12:27.775 --> 01:12:31.343
THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY AT      
RISK.                           
IT'S A SEPARATE SHEET.          

01:12:31.345 --> 01:12:32.711

IT'S A SEPARATE SHEET.

YEAH, THAT'S YOU KNOW, THAT'S   

01:12:35.817 --> 01:12:36.349
>> YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE IT OK THE 
YEAH, THAT'S YOU KNOW, THAT'S   
BEEN AN ISSUE.                  

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.083
YEAH, THAT'S YOU KNOW, THAT'S   
BEEN AN ISSUE.                  
SO WE HAVE THREE WATER WELLS    

01:12:37.085 --> 01:12:39.585
BEEN AN ISSUE.                  
SO WE HAVE THREE WATER WELLS    
DOWN LOCATED THE AIRPORT AND    

01:12:39.587 --> 01:12:43.222
SO WE HAVE THREE WATER WELLS    
DOWN LOCATED THE AIRPORT AND    
THOSE THREE COMBINED TYPICALLY  

01:12:43.224 --> 01:12:43.990
DOWN LOCATED THE AIRPORT AND    
THOSE THREE COMBINED TYPICALLY  
PROVIDE ABOUT FIVE TO 10        

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:46.992
THOSE THREE COMBINED TYPICALLY  
PROVIDE ABOUT FIVE TO 10        
PERCENT OF THE CITY'S WATER.    

01:12:46.994 --> 01:12:48.294
PROVIDE ABOUT FIVE TO 10        
PERCENT OF THE CITY'S WATER.    
AS YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE WATER  

01:12:48.296 --> 01:12:48.895
PERCENT OF THE CITY'S WATER.    
AS YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE WATER  
COMES FROM HERE ON RIVER.       

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:51.764
AS YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE WATER  
COMES FROM HERE ON RIVER.       
SO WE ARE IN THE THREE FIRES    

01:12:51.766 --> 01:12:52.365
COMES FROM HERE ON RIVER.       
SO WE ARE IN THE THREE FIRES    
AQUIFER AND IN THE WELLHEAD     

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:54.633
SO WE ARE IN THE THREE FIRES    
AQUIFER AND IN THE WELLHEAD     
PROTECTION ZONE FOR THOSE       

01:12:54.635 --> 01:12:54.967
AQUIFER AND IN THE WELLHEAD     
PROTECTION ZONE FOR THOSE

PROTECTION ZONE FOR THOSE       
WELLS.                          
NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT WELLHEAD  

01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:58.604
WELLS.                          
NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT WELLHEAD  
PROTECTION ZONE COVERS A GOOD   

01:12:58.606 --> 01:12:59.338
NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT WELLHEAD  
PROTECTION ZONE COVERS A GOOD   
CHUNK OF PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP.   

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:02.908
PROTECTION ZONE COVERS A GOOD   
CHUNK OF PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP.   
IT EXPANDS TO SILO CHURCH ROAD  

01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:06.946
CHUNK OF PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP.   
IT EXPANDS TO SILO CHURCH ROAD

BE FARTHER AWAY FROM THE CITY   
WHICH MEANS THAT THE PLANES     

01:26:31.852 --> 01:26:34.686
BE FARTHER AWAY FROM THE CITY   
WHICH MEANS THAT THE PLANES     
WILL BE FLYING COMING IN AT A   

01:26:34.688 --> 01:26:35.353
WHICH MEANS THAT THE PLANES     
WILL BE FLYING COMING IN AT A   
HIGHER ALTITUDE WHICH WILL      

01:26:35.355 --> 01:26:38.356
