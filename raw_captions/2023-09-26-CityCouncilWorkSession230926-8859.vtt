THE BIG TAKEAWAY WHAT I CALL    
INSIGHT NUMBER ONE RESILIENCE,  

00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:54.732
THE BIG TAKEAWAY WHAT I CALL    
INSIGHT NUMBER ONE RESILIENCE,  
RELIABILITY AND COST ARE        

00:10:54.734 --> 00:10:59.169
INSIGHT NUMBER ONE RESILIENCE,

THREE RESIDENTS REALLY DID MAKE 
A PRIORITY ON RESILIENCE AND    

00:11:10.716 --> 00:11:11.382
THREE RESIDENTS REALLY DID MAKE 
A PRIORITY ON RESILIENCE AND    
RESILIENCE IN THIS CASE IS      

00:11:11.384 --> 00:11:14.284
A PRIORITY ON RESILIENCE AND    
RESILIENCE IN THIS CASE IS      
BEING ABLE TO KEEP POWERED

SO I JUST WANTED TO STRESS THAT 
THIS IS NOT A GIVEN IT&apos;S A      

00:28:37.028 --> 00:28:40.030
SO I JUST WANTED TO STRESS THAT 
THIS IS NOT A GIVEN IT&apos;S A      
REASONABLE FORECAST.            

00:28:40.032 --> 00:28:44.567
THIS IS NOT A GIVEN IT&apos;S A      
REASONABLE FORECAST.            
SO BY 20 30 IF THESE THINGS GO  

00:28:44.569 --> 00:28:48.104
REASONABLE FORECAST.            
SO BY 20 30 IF THESE THINGS GO  
AS I DESCRIBED EITHER DTV OR    

00:28:48.106 --> 00:28:52.142
SO BY 20 30 IF THESE THINGS GO  
AS I DESCRIBED EITHER DTV OR    
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES WITHIN 

00:28:52.144 --> 00:28:52.942
AS I DESCRIBED EITHER DTV OR

00:28:52.944 --> 00:28:56.178
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES WITHIN 
ANN ARBOR OR THE CITIES         
EXISTING INITIATIVES WOULD HAVE 

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.582
ANN ARBOR OR THE CITIES         
EXISTING INITIATIVES WOULD HAVE 
ABOUT FIFTY NINE PERCENT        

00:28:59.584 --> 00:29:00.383
EXISTING INITIATIVES WOULD HAVE 
ABOUT FIFTY NINE PERCENT        
OF YOUR POWER CONSUMPTION BE    

00:29:00.385 --> 00:29:03.853
ABOUT FIFTY NINE PERCENT        
OF YOUR POWER CONSUMPTION BE    
FROM RENEWABLES LEAVING A GAP   

00:29:03.855 --> 00:29:04.520
OF YOUR POWER CONSUMPTION BE    
FROM RENEWABLES LEAVING A GAP

00:29:04.522 --> 00:29:07.990
FROM RENEWABLES LEAVING A GAP   
OF FORTY ONE PERCENT.           
SO THAT&apos;S THE BASIC NUMBER THAT 

00:29:07.992 --> 00:29:09.124
OF FORTY ONE PERCENT.           
SO THAT&apos;S THE BASIC NUMBER THAT 
WE USED IN OUR VARIOUS ANALYZES

01:07:40.136 --> 01:07:43.437
OF MUNICIPAL IZATION YOU DID    
NOT FACTOR IN THE COST THAT     
WOULD BE YOU DIDN&apos;T PROJECT ANY 

01:07:43.439 --> 01:07:44.138
NOT FACTOR IN THE COST THAT     
WOULD BE YOU DIDN&apos;T PROJECT ANY 
COSTS REGARDING LITIGATION AND

COUNCILMAN MODISH, I HAVE A     
QUESTION JUST ABOUT WORDING AND 

01:07:58.521 --> 01:08:02.823
COUNCILMAN MODISH, I HAVE A     
QUESTION JUST ABOUT WORDING AND 
THEN I HAD A COUPLE OF OTHER    

01:08:02.825 --> 01:08:06.059
QUESTION JUST ABOUT WORDING AND 
THEN I HAD A COUPLE OF OTHER    
QUESTIONS THAT I&apos;LL PICK UP     

01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:06.494
THEN I HAD A COUPLE OF OTHER    
QUESTIONS THAT I&apos;LL PICK UP     
AFTER THAT.                     

01:08:06.496 --> 01:08:09.530
QUESTIONS THAT I&apos;LL PICK UP     
AFTER THAT.                     
BUT SO WOULD YOU PUT IT THIS    

01:08:09.532 --> 01:08:10.597

BUT SO WOULD YOU PUT IT THIS    
WAY OR AM I AM I UNDERSTAND YOU 

01:08:10.599 --> 01:08:14.267
BUT SO WOULD YOU PUT IT THIS    
WAY OR AM I AM I UNDERSTAND YOU 
CORRECTLY THAT WE SHOULDN&apos;T     

01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:16.803
WAY OR AM I AM I UNDERSTAND YOU 
CORRECTLY THAT WE SHOULDN&apos;T     
RULE OUT MUNICIPAL CAUSATION    

01:08:16.805 --> 01:08:17.671
CORRECTLY THAT WE SHOULDN&apos;T     
RULE OUT MUNICIPAL CAUSATION    
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT ENABLE 

01:08:17.673 --> 01:08:21.075
RULE OUT MUNICIPAL CAUSATION    
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT ENABLE 
US TO ACHIEVE 100 PERCENT       

01:08:21.077 --> 01:08:21.609
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT ENABLE 
US TO ACHIEVE 100 PERCENT       
RENEWABLE BY 2030.              

01:08:21.611 --> 01:08:22.443
US TO ACHIEVE 100 PERCENT       
RENEWABLE BY 2030.              
WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT WE      

01:08:22.445 --> 01:08:25.579
RENEWABLE BY 2030.              
WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT WE      
MIGHT GET FROM IT AND CONSIDER  

01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:26.313
WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT WE      
MIGHT GET FROM IT AND CONSIDER  
PURSUING IT FOR THE BENEFITS    

01:08:26.315 --> 01:08:29.583
MIGHT GET FROM IT AND CONSIDER  
PURSUING IT FOR THE BENEFITS    
THAT IT CAN PROVIDE US BUT NOT  

01:08:29.585 --> 01:08:32.620
PURSUING IT FOR THE BENEFITS    
THAT IT CAN PROVIDE US BUT NOT  
BUT KNOWING THAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO 

01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:33.353
THAT IT CAN PROVIDE US BUT NOT  
BUT KNOWING THAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO 
HAVE TO GET TO 100 PERCENT      

01:08:33.355 --> 01:08:34.088
BUT KNOWING THAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO 
HAVE TO GET TO 100 PERCENT      
RENEWABLE BY 2030 THROUGH OTHER 

01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:35.856
HAVE TO GET TO 100 PERCENT      
RENEWABLE BY 2030 THROUGH OTHER 
MEANS.                          

01:08:35.858 --> 01:08:37.257
RENEWABLE BY 2030 THROUGH OTHER 
MEANS.                          
I AGREE AND THAT IS AN ACCURATE 

01:08:37.259 --> 01:08:37.791
MEANS.                          
I AGREE AND THAT IS AN ACCURATE 
RESTATEMENT OF OUR              

01:08:37.793 --> 01:08:39.960
I AGREE AND THAT IS AN ACCURATE 
RESTATEMENT OF OUR              
RECOMMENDATION.                 

01:08:39.962 --> 01:08:48.101
RESTATEMENT OF OUR              
RECOMMENDATION.                 
OK THEN I I WAS CURIOUS WHY DO  

01:08:48.103 --> 01:08:51.505
RECOMMENDATION.                 
OK THEN I I WAS CURIOUS WHY DO  
THE VIRTUAL POWER AGREEMENTS    

01:08:51.507 --> 01:08:54.975
OK THEN I I WAS CURIOUS WHY DO  
THE VIRTUAL POWER AGREEMENTS    
POOR FIRST SPEED AND WELL SPEED 

01:08:54.977 --> 01:08:55.843
THE VIRTUAL POWER AGREEMENTS    
POOR FIRST SPEED AND WELL SPEED 
I GUESS BECAUSE THERE JUST ARE  

01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:58.845
POOR FIRST SPEED AND WELL SPEED 
I GUESS BECAUSE THERE JUST ARE  
YOU WERE SAYING IT&apos;S HARDER TO  

01:08:58.847 --> 01:08:59.613
I GUESS BECAUSE THERE JUST ARE  
YOU WERE SAYING IT&apos;S HARDER TO  
GET ENOUGH PEOPLE ORGANIZED AND 

01:08:59.615 --> 01:09:03.016
YOU WERE SAYING IT&apos;S HARDER TO  
GET ENOUGH PEOPLE ORGANIZED AND 
THEN FAIR FOR SCALABILITY IS    

01:09:03.018 --> 01:09:04.050
GET ENOUGH PEOPLE ORGANIZED AND 
THEN FAIR FOR SCALABILITY IS    
THAT THE SAME ISSUE THAT YEAH   

01:09:04.052 --> 01:09:07.688
THEN FAIR FOR SCALABILITY IS    
THAT THE SAME ISSUE THAT YEAH   
UM THE SPEED PART OF IT IS      

01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:11.491
THAT THE SAME ISSUE THAT YEAH   
UM THE SPEED PART OF IT IS      
SIMPLY THAT IF YOU WANT POWER   

01:09:11.493 --> 01:09:14.261
UM THE SPEED PART OF IT IS      
SIMPLY THAT IF YOU WANT POWER   
PURCHASE AGREEMENT IN MICHIGAN  

01:09:14.263 --> 01:09:18.532
SIMPLY THAT IF YOU WANT POWER   
PURCHASE AGREEMENT IN MICHIGAN  
OR NEAR MICHIGAN THERE&apos;S NOT AN 

01:09:18.534 --> 01:09:19.333
PURCHASE AGREEMENT IN MICHIGAN  
OR NEAR MICHIGAN THERE&apos;S NOT AN 
AMPLE SUPPLY OF THEM NOW.       

01:09:19.335 --> 01:09:22.569
OR NEAR MICHIGAN THERE&apos;S NOT AN 
AMPLE SUPPLY OF THEM NOW.       
SO YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE        

01:09:22.571 --> 01:09:23.370
AMPLE SUPPLY OF THEM NOW.       
SO YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE        
CONTRACTING WITH SOMEBODY WHO   

01:09:23.372 --> 01:09:26.573
SO YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE        
CONTRACTING WITH SOMEBODY WHO   
IS PREPARED TO BUILD ONE BUT    

01:09:26.575 --> 01:09:30.077
CONTRACTING WITH SOMEBODY WHO   
IS PREPARED TO BUILD ONE BUT    
HASN&apos;T DONE SO AND FOR THEM TO  

01:09:30.079 --> 01:09:30.745
IS PREPARED TO BUILD ONE BUT    
HASN&apos;T DONE SO AND FOR THEM TO  
GET THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS   

01:09:30.747 --> 01:09:32.880
HASN&apos;T DONE SO AND FOR THEM TO  
GET THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS   
WOULD TAKE THREE OR FOUR YEARS  

01:09:32.882 --> 01:09:33.214
GET THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS   
WOULD TAKE THREE OR FOUR YEARS  
.                               

01:09:33.216 --> 01:09:36.884
WOULD TAKE THREE OR FOUR YEARS  
.                               
SO SPEED IS JUST SLOW BECAUSE   

01:09:36.886 --> 01:09:37.818
.                               
SO SPEED IS JUST SLOW BECAUSE   
IT&apos;S A LEGAL PROCESS TO GET     

01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.389
SO SPEED IS JUST SLOW BECAUSE   
IT&apos;S A LEGAL PROCESS TO GET     
INTO THE CONTRACTS AND FOR THEM 

01:09:41.391 --> 01:09:42.122
IT&apos;S A LEGAL PROCESS TO GET     
INTO THE CONTRACTS AND FOR THEM 
TO GET INTERCONNECTION RIGHTS   

01:09:42.124 --> 01:09:42.923
INTO THE CONTRACTS AND FOR THEM 
TO GET INTERCONNECTION RIGHTS   
TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND  

01:09:42.925 --> 01:09:45.325
TO GET INTERCONNECTION RIGHTS   
TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND  
ALL OF THAT AND THEN ACTUALLY   

01:09:45.327 --> 01:09:48.895
TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND  
ALL OF THAT AND THEN ACTUALLY   
BUILD IT UNDER YOUR CRITERIA    

01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:52.566
ALL OF THAT AND THEN ACTUALLY   
BUILD IT UNDER YOUR CRITERIA    
FOR SCALABILITY AND IT WAS      

01:09:52.568 --> 01:09:53.300
BUILD IT UNDER YOUR CRITERIA    
FOR SCALABILITY AND IT WAS      
COUPLED WITH TRANSFERABILITY    

01:09:53.302 --> 01:09:56.570
FOR SCALABILITY AND IT WAS      
COUPLED WITH TRANSFERABILITY    
AND IT IS REALLY ABOUT THE      

01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:57.304
COUPLED WITH TRANSFERABILITY    
AND IT IS REALLY ABOUT THE      
ABILITY OF COMMUNITIES OTHER    

01:09:57.306 --> 01:10:00.307
AND IT IS REALLY ABOUT THE      
ABILITY OF COMMUNITIES OTHER    
THAN ANN ARBOR TO PURSUE THE    

01:10:00.309 --> 01:10:04.578
ABILITY OF COMMUNITIES OTHER    
THAN ANN ARBOR TO PURSUE THE    
SAME PATH AND NOT EVERYONE HAS  

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.282
THAN ANN ARBOR TO PURSUE THE    
SAME PATH AND NOT EVERYONE HAS  
AN ARBOR&apos;S KIND VILLAGE AND AND 

01:10:08.284 --> 01:10:10.984
SAME PATH AND NOT EVERYONE HAS  
AN ARBOR&apos;S KIND VILLAGE AND AND 
OTHER TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT 

01:10:10.986 --> 01:10:11.185
AN ARBOR&apos;S KIND VILLAGE AND AND 
OTHER TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT 
.                               

01:10:11.187 --> 01:10:11.986
OTHER TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT 
.                               
AND SO THAT&apos;S THE SCALABILITY   

01:10:11.988 --> 01:10:15.389
.                               
AND SO THAT&apos;S THE SCALABILITY   
THAT WE WERE BASING THAT        

01:10:15.391 --> 01:10:18.859
AND SO THAT&apos;S THE SCALABILITY   
THAT WE WERE BASING THAT        
REINKING ON THAT FEELS A LITTLE 

01:10:18.861 --> 01:10:19.427
THAT WE WERE BASING THAT        
REINKING ON THAT FEELS A LITTLE 
SECONDARY TO ME.                

01:10:19.429 --> 01:10:20.761
REINKING ON THAT FEELS A LITTLE 
SECONDARY TO ME.                
I KNOW WE LIKE TO SHOW A PATH   

01:10:20.763 --> 01:10:23.564
SECONDARY TO ME.                
I KNOW WE LIKE TO SHOW A PATH   
FOR OTHERS THAT THAT IS LESS    

01:10:23.566 --> 01:10:24.431
I KNOW WE LIKE TO SHOW A PATH   
FOR OTHERS THAT THAT IS LESS    
IMPORTANT TO ME THAN THE OTHER  

01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:26.767
FOR OTHERS THAT THAT IS LESS    
IMPORTANT TO ME THAN THE OTHER  
ISSUE BECAUSE I&apos;M PERSONALLY    

01:10:26.769 --> 01:10:27.868
IMPORTANT TO ME THAN THE OTHER  
ISSUE BECAUSE I&apos;M PERSONALLY    
REALLY NOT VERY I WOULD NEED TO 

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:31.605

REALLY NOT VERY I WOULD NEED TO 
LEARN A LOT MORE AND BE REALLY  

01:10:31.607 --> 01:10:32.339
REALLY NOT VERY I WOULD NEED TO

REASSURED ABOUT THE NATIONAL

01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:56.002
TIME TO REALLY PROCESS WHAT&apos;S   
EVERYTHING THAT&apos;S IN IT AND     
COME WITH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS  

01:19:56.004 --> 01:20:00.506
EVERYTHING THAT&apos;S IN IT AND     
COME WITH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS  
BUT SOME OF THE PIECES THAT     

01:20:00.508 --> 01:20:01.174
COME WITH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS  
BUT SOME OF THE PIECES THAT     
HAVEN&apos;T BEEN COVERED THAT AND   

01:20:01.176 --> 01:20:04.044
BUT SOME OF THE PIECES THAT     
HAVEN&apos;T BEEN COVERED THAT AND   
THAT YOU DIDN&apos;T GO INTO TOO     

01:20:04.046 --> 01:20:07.881
HAVEN&apos;T BEEN COVERED THAT AND   
THAT YOU DIDN&apos;T GO INTO TOO     
MUCH TONIGHT WERE SOME OF THE   

01:20:07.883 --> 01:20:08.815
THAT YOU DIDN&apos;T GO INTO TOO     
MUCH TONIGHT WERE SOME OF THE   
THE ALIGNMENT WITH TWO ZERO     

01:20:08.817 --> 01:20:11.418
MUCH TONIGHT WERE SOME OF THE   
THE ALIGNMENT WITH TWO ZERO     
CRITERIA AND IN PARTICULAR SOME 

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.285
THE ALIGNMENT WITH TWO ZERO     
CRITERIA AND IN PARTICULAR SOME 
OF THAT&apos;S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND  

01:20:12.287 --> 01:20:12.686
CRITERIA AND IN PARTICULAR SOME 
OF THAT&apos;S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND  
THAN OTHERS.                    

01:20:12.688 --> 01:20:15.188
OF THAT&apos;S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND  
THAN OTHERS.                    
BUT THE ONE THAT KIND OF POPS   

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:16.122
THAN OTHERS.                    
BUT THE ONE THAT KIND OF POPS   
OUT AT ME IS ONE AROUND EQUITY  

01:20:16.124 --> 01:20:18.991
BUT THE ONE THAT KIND OF POPS   
OUT AT ME IS ONE AROUND EQUITY  
AND JUSTICE.                    

01:20:18.993 --> 01:20:20.059
OUT AT ME IS ONE AROUND EQUITY  
AND JUSTICE.                    
AND SO I WAS CURIOUS IF YOU     

01:20:20.061 --> 01:20:22.462
AND JUSTICE.                    
AND SO I WAS CURIOUS IF YOU     
COULD GO IN A LITTLE BIT MORE   

01:20:22.464 --> 01:20:23.529
AND SO I WAS CURIOUS IF YOU     
COULD GO IN A LITTLE BIT MORE   
ON SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT 

01:20:23.531 --> 01:20:24.264
COULD GO IN A LITTLE BIT MORE   
ON SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT 
ARE MADE THERE IN PARTICULAR I  

01:20:24.266 --> 01:20:26.967
ON SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT 
ARE MADE THERE IN PARTICULAR I  
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN          

01:20:26.969 --> 01:20:30.703
ARE MADE THERE IN PARTICULAR I  
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN          
UNDERSTANDING WHY COMMUNITY     

01:20:30.705 --> 01:20:31.705
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN          
UNDERSTANDING WHY COMMUNITY     
SOLAR DOESN&apos;T ALIGN WELL WITH   

01:20:31.707 --> 01:20:35.408
UNDERSTANDING WHY COMMUNITY     
SOLAR DOESN&apos;T ALIGN WELL WITH   
EQUITY JUSTICE AND THEN ALSO    

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:38.945
SOLAR DOESN&apos;T ALIGN WELL WITH   
EQUITY JUSTICE AND THEN ALSO    
WHEN IT COMES TO THE STRUCTURE  

01:20:38.947 --> 01:20:42.549
EQUITY JUSTICE AND THEN ALSO    
WHEN IT COMES TO THE STRUCTURE  
OF THAT WERE THAT WERE          

01:20:42.551 --> 01:20:43.416
WHEN IT COMES TO THE STRUCTURE  
OF THAT WERE THAT WERE          
STRUCTURES THAT WERE LOOKED AT  

01:20:43.418 --> 01:20:45.852
OF THAT WERE THAT WERE          
STRUCTURES THAT WERE LOOKED AT  
TRYING TO SCROLL THROUGH TO     

01:20:45.854 --> 01:20:49.589
STRUCTURES THAT WERE LOOKED AT  
TRYING TO SCROLL THROUGH TO     
MAKE SURE I SAID CORRECTLY DTT  

01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:50.790
TRYING TO SCROLL THROUGH TO     
MAKE SURE I SAID CORRECTLY DTT  
IF I&apos;M CALLING ENDS UP COMING   

01:20:50.792 --> 01:20:54.327
MAKE SURE I SAID CORRECTLY DTT  
IF I&apos;M CALLING ENDS UP COMING   
OUT IS GOOD OR SOMETHING LIKE   

01:20:54.329 --> 01:20:54.928
IF I&apos;M CALLING ENDS UP COMING   
OUT IS GOOD OR SOMETHING LIKE   
THAT ON EQUITY AND JUSTICE      

01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:57.564
OUT IS GOOD OR SOMETHING LIKE   
THAT ON EQUITY AND JUSTICE      
WHICH LEADS ME TO SOME          

01:20:57.566 --> 01:21:03.970
THAT ON EQUITY AND JUSTICE      
WHICH LEADS ME TO SOME          
QUESTIONS BUT THEN              

01:21:04.605 --> 01:21:10.243
                   FOR THE      
MUNICIPAL ENERGY UTILITY IT&apos;S   
IT&apos;S POOR TO FAIR AND SO I&apos;M    

01:21:10.245 --> 01:21:13.813
MUNICIPAL ENERGY UTILITY IT&apos;S   
IT&apos;S POOR TO FAIR AND SO I&apos;M    
CURIOUS JUST HOW THESE WHAT ARE 

01:21:13.815 --> 01:21:17.217
IT&apos;S POOR TO FAIR AND SO I&apos;M    
CURIOUS JUST HOW THESE WHAT ARE 
HOW YOU DEFINING THIS?          

01:21:17.219 --> 01:21:20.887
CURIOUS JUST HOW THESE WHAT ARE 
HOW YOU DEFINING THIS?          
SO THEY CERTAINLY ARE           

01:21:20.889 --> 01:21:21.688
HOW YOU DEFINING THIS?          
SO THEY CERTAINLY ARE           
CONSIDERATIONS FOR EQUALITY AND 

01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:24.924
SO THEY CERTAINLY ARE           
CONSIDERATIONS FOR EQUALITY AND 
JUSTICE OTHER THAN COST BUT     

01:21:24.926 --> 01:21:28.694
CONSIDERATIONS FOR EQUALITY AND 
JUSTICE OTHER THAN COST BUT     
THOSE SCORES ARE DOMINATED BY   

01:21:28.696 --> 01:21:29.730
JUSTICE OTHER THAN COST BUT     
THOSE SCORES ARE DOMINATED BY   
THE LIKELY COST TO LOW INCOME   

01:21:29.732 --> 01:21:32.031
THOSE SCORES ARE DOMINATED BY   
THE LIKELY COST TO LOW INCOME   
HOUSEHOLDS.                     

01:21:32.033 --> 01:21:36.236
THE LIKELY COST TO LOW INCOME   
HOUSEHOLDS.                     
SO THAT&apos;S REALLY THE CORE       

01:21:36.238 --> 01:21:36.703
HOUSEHOLDS.                     
SO THAT&apos;S REALLY THE CORE       
OF THE ANSWER.                  

01:21:36.705 --> 01:21:39.972
SO THAT&apos;S REALLY THE CORE       
OF THE ANSWER.                  
A LITTLE ELABORATION COMMUNITY  

01:21:39.974 --> 01:21:44.478
OF THE ANSWER.                  
A LITTLE ELABORATION COMMUNITY  
SOLAR SO COMMUNITY SOLAR IS     

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.281
A LITTLE ELABORATION COMMUNITY  
SOLAR SO COMMUNITY SOLAR IS     
TYPICALLY A YOU A SOLAR ARRAY   

01:21:48.283 --> 01:21:49.082
SOLAR SO COMMUNITY SOLAR IS     
TYPICALLY A YOU A SOLAR ARRAY   
THAT&apos;S SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM THE  

01:21:49.084 --> 01:21:51.818
TYPICALLY A YOU A SOLAR ARRAY   
THAT&apos;S SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM THE  
CUSTOMER SO EFFECTIVELY THAT    

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:52.819
THAT&apos;S SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM THE  
CUSTOMER SO EFFECTIVELY THAT    
POWER IS SOLD TO THE UTILITY    

01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:53.553
CUSTOMER SO EFFECTIVELY THAT    
POWER IS SOLD TO THE UTILITY    
AND THEN DELIVERED BY THE       

01:21:53.555 --> 01:21:56.456
POWER IS SOLD TO THE UTILITY    
AND THEN DELIVERED BY THE       
UTILITY THE CUSTOMER AND THE    

01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:57.323
AND THEN DELIVERED BY THE       
UTILITY THE CUSTOMER AND THE    
CUSTOMER GETS A BILL CREDIT FOR 

01:21:57.325 --> 01:21:58.991
UTILITY THE CUSTOMER AND THE    
CUSTOMER GETS A BILL CREDIT FOR 
IT.                             

01:21:58.993 --> 01:21:59.926
CUSTOMER GETS A BILL CREDIT FOR 
IT.                             
THE UTILITIES THINK THAT THEY   

01:21:59.928 --> 01:22:00.860
IT.                             
THE UTILITIES THINK THAT THEY   
NEED TO CHARGE THE FULL COST    

01:22:00.862 --> 01:22:03.696
THE UTILITIES THINK THAT THEY   
NEED TO CHARGE THE FULL COST    
OF DELIVERY FOR THAT ROUTE AND  

01:22:03.698 --> 01:22:07.501
NEED TO CHARGE THE FULL COST    
OF DELIVERY FOR THAT ROUTE AND  
THEN HOW THEY TREAT THE POWER   

01:22:07.503 --> 01:22:11.237
OF DELIVERY FOR THAT ROUTE AND  
THEN HOW THEY TREAT THE POWER   
COST IS TYPICALLY IN DISPUTE.   

01:22:11.239 --> 01:22:12.305
THEN HOW THEY TREAT THE POWER   
COST IS TYPICALLY IN DISPUTE.   
BUT YOU KNOW, COMPARING THE     

01:22:12.307 --> 01:22:14.874
COST IS TYPICALLY IN DISPUTE.   
BUT YOU KNOW, COMPARING THE     
COST OF THE POWER FROM THAT     

01:22:14.876 --> 01:22:15.742
BUT YOU KNOW, COMPARING THE     
COST OF THE POWER FROM THAT     
SOLAR FACILITY TO THE COST

HAVE SUPPLIED, THAT CAN         
POTENTIALLY BE BENEFICIAL IN    
COMMUNITY SOLAR IF THE COST

YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE AN OUTAGE

AT YOUR HOUSE BUT YOUR FRIEND   
ACROSS TOWN HAS POWER AND YOU   

01:36:40.875 --> 01:36:43.542
AT YOUR HOUSE BUT YOUR FRIEND   
ACROSS TOWN HAS POWER AND YOU   
CAN GO OVER THERE THAT&apos;S MUCH   

01:36:43.544 --> 01:36:44.210
ACROSS TOWN HAS POWER AND YOU   
CAN GO OVER THERE THAT&apos;S MUCH   
LESS INJURIOUS THAN IF          

01:36:44.212 --> 01:36:47.580
CAN GO OVER THERE THAT&apos;S MUCH   
LESS INJURIOUS THAN IF          
EVERYBODY IN TOWN IS OUT AND    

01:36:47.582 --> 01:36:48.247
LESS INJURIOUS THAN IF

01:36:48.249 --> 01:36:50.582
EVERYBODY IN TOWN IS OUT AND    
YOU JUST HAVE TO SUFFER.        
THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE     

01:36:50.584 --> 01:36:53.985

THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE     
ABOUT THOSE ASSESSMENTS IS THEY 

01:36:53.987 --> 01:36:54.754
THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE     
ABOUT THOSE ASSESSMENTS IS THEY 
HAVE NOT TREATED LOW INCOME     

01:36:54.756 --> 01:36:58.023
ABOUT THOSE ASSESSMENTS IS THEY

GREAT LAKES AND ENERGY HAS BEEN 
WORKING FOR A WHILE ON AN       
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SCREENING 

01:42:58.319 --> 01:43:01.720
WORKING FOR A WHILE ON AN       
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SCREENING 
TOOL WHICH IS MAP BASED AND HAS 

01:43:01.722 --> 01:43:02.654
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SCREENING 
TOOL WHICH IS MAP BASED AND HAS 
ALL OF THAT KIND OF INFORMATION 

01:43:02.656 --> 01:43:05.590
TOOL WHICH IS MAP BASED AND HAS 
ALL OF THAT KIND OF INFORMATION 
ALREADY IN PART OF THE          

01:43:05.592 --> 01:43:09.260
ALL OF THAT KIND OF INFORMATION 
ALREADY IN PART OF THE

ALREADY IN PART OF THE          
COMMITMENT THAT THE COMMISSION  
HAS MADE AND I THINK HE HAS     

01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:13.165
COMMITMENT THAT THE COMMISSION  
HAS MADE AND I THINK HE HAS     
MADE IS TO PUT IS TO OVERLAY    

01:43:13.167 --> 01:43:16.601
HAS MADE AND I THINK HE HAS     
MADE IS TO PUT IS TO OVERLAY    
THESE RELIABILITY DATA WITH THE 

01:43:16.603 --> 01:43:17.336
MADE IS TO PUT IS TO OVERLAY    
THESE RELIABILITY DATA WITH THE 
DATA IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL

THAT EVERY BIT OF POWER THEY    
WOULD HAVE SOLD TO PEOPLE IN

THAT EVERY BIT OF POWER THEY    
WOULD HAVE SOLD TO PEOPLE IN    
ANN ARBOR COULD BE SOLD INTO

THE MORE YOU MOVE TO RELIANCE   

01:49:02.949 --> 01:49:06.651

THE MORE YOU MOVE TO RELIANCE   
ON INCOME HAVING TO PAY THEM    

01:49:06.653 --> 01:49:10.355
THE MORE YOU MOVE TO RELIANCE   
ON INCOME HAVING TO PAY THEM    
FOR LOST INCOME, THE BIGGER THE 

01:49:10.357 --> 01:49:10.756
ON INCOME HAVING TO PAY THEM

YES, AS I SHOWED IN EARLY SLIDE 
OUR PROJECTIONS OF YOUR NEED    
FOR INCREASED CAPACITY IS THAT

OUR PROJECTIONS OF YOUR NEED    
FOR INCREASED CAPACITY IS THAT  
THAT DOESN&apos;T REALLY COME UNTIL

GRADUAL OUT.                    
YOU KNOW, FROM THERE YOU WOULD

YOU KNOW, FROM THERE YOU WOULD  
NOT SEE LIKE A UNIFORM

SO IT&apos;S VERY LIKELY THAT THE

WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT IT

OF MUNICIPAL IZATION EVEN IN    
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WHICH I 
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE     

02:12:08.366 --> 02:12:09.099
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WHICH I 
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE     
ANOTHER COMMUNITY THAT HAD THAT

WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE     
ANOTHER COMMUNITY THAT HAD THAT

02:12:12.204 --> 02:12:13.137
ANOTHER COMMUNITY THAT HAD THAT 
TYPE OF A WORST CASE SCENARIO   
BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE     

02:12:13.139 --> 02:12:13.870
TYPE OF A WORST CASE SCENARIO   
BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE     
PERSONALLY IN THE THREE YEARS   

02:12:13.872 --> 02:12:15.472
BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE

PERSONALLY IN THE THREE YEARS   
I&apos;VE SEEN I&apos;VE BEEN ORGANIZING

02:12:16.108 --> 02:12:17.140
I&apos;VE SEEN I&apos;VE BEEN ORGANIZING  
ON THIS ISSUE.                  
BUT EVEN IN THAT WORST CASE     

02:12:17.142 --> 02:12:19.943
ON THIS ISSUE.                  
BUT EVEN IN THAT WORST CASE     
SCENARIO AFTER 20 YEARS THE     

02:12:19.945 --> 02:12:20.811
BUT EVEN IN THAT WORST CASE     
SCENARIO AFTER 20 YEARS THE     
RATES ARE NEARLY THE SAME ONLY  

02:12:20.813 --> 02:12:23.580
SCENARIO AFTER 20 YEARS THE     
RATES ARE NEARLY THE SAME ONLY  
FOUR PERCENT HIGHER AND THAT    

02:12:23.582 --> 02:12:24.314
RATES ARE NEARLY THE SAME ONLY  
FOUR PERCENT HIGHER AND THAT    
TABLE REALLY SHOULD BE AMENDED  

02:12:24.316 --> 02:12:27.517
FOUR PERCENT HIGHER AND THAT    
TABLE REALLY SHOULD BE AMENDED  
TO SHOW 30 YEAR RATES BECAUSE   

02:12:27.519 --> 02:12:28.351
TABLE REALLY SHOULD BE AMENDED  
TO SHOW 30 YEAR RATES BECAUSE   
THE DEBT THAT THEY ARE          

02:12:28.353 --> 02:12:31.521
TO SHOW 30 YEAR RATES BECAUSE   
THE DEBT THAT THEY ARE          
ESTIMATING ON IS 30 YEAR DEBT.  

02:12:31.523 --> 02:12:32.423
THE DEBT THAT THEY ARE          
ESTIMATING ON IS 30 YEAR DEBT.  
SO IT IS AN INVESTMENT THAT     

02:12:32.425 --> 02:12:35.759
ESTIMATING ON IS 30 YEAR DEBT.  
SO IT IS AN INVESTMENT THAT     
PAYS FOR ITSELF OVER TIME,      

02:12:35.761 --> 02:12:36.760
SO IT IS AN INVESTMENT THAT

ALLOWS US TO REACH 100 PERCENT  

02:12:36.762 --> 02:12:39.929
PAYS FOR ITSELF OVER TIME,      
ALLOWS US TO REACH 100 PERCENT  
RENEWABLE POWER AND IT IS THE   

02:12:39.931 --> 02:12:40.697
ALLOWS US TO REACH 100 PERCENT  
RENEWABLE POWER AND IT IS THE   
ONLY REAL WAY THAT WE HAVE TO   

02:12:40.699 --> 02:12:41.231
RENEWABLE POWER AND IT IS THE   
ONLY REAL WAY THAT WE HAVE TO   
ADDRESS THE RELIABILITY

ONLY REAL WAY THAT WE HAVE TO

GIVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THE

02:34:36.547 --> 02:34:37.479
GIVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THE    
PRESENTATION TO STUDY.          
THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO     

02:34:37.481 --> 02:34:39.915
PRESENTATION TO STUDY.          
THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO     
TALK ABOUT WAS JUST LIKE WHAT   

02:34:39.917 --> 02:34:40.883
THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO     
TALK ABOUT WAS JUST LIKE WHAT   
IT MEANS TO HAVE A RESILIENT    

02:34:40.885 --> 02:34:41.650
TALK ABOUT WAS JUST LIKE WHAT   
IT MEANS TO HAVE A RESILIENT    
POWER SYSTEM AND THEN THE MAIN  

02:34:41.652 --> 02:34:44.653
IT MEANS TO HAVE A RESILIENT    
POWER SYSTEM AND THEN THE MAIN  
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS LIKE  

02:34:44.655 --> 02:34:45.387
POWER SYSTEM AND THEN THE MAIN  
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS LIKE  
THE REDUNDANT INFRASTRUCTURE    

02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:47.790
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS LIKE  
THE REDUNDANT INFRASTRUCTURE    
HAVING A REDUNDANT DISTRIBUTION 

02:34:47.792 --> 02:34:48.790
THE REDUNDANT INFRASTRUCTURE    
HAVING A REDUNDANT DISTRIBUTION 
SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN ONE LINE    

02:34:48.792 --> 02:34:49.525
HAVING A REDUNDANT DISTRIBUTION 
SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN ONE LINE    
FAILS OTHER LINES CAN BE IN     

02:34:49.527 --> 02:34:51.993
SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN ONE LINE    
FAILS OTHER LINES CAN BE IN     
PLACE SO THAT IT DOESN&apos;T        

02:34:51.995 --> 02:34:52.762
FAILS OTHER LINES CAN BE IN     
PLACE SO THAT IT DOESN&apos;T        
ACTUALLY RESULT IN AN OUTAGE    

02:34:52.764 --> 02:34:53.562
PLACE SO THAT IT DOESN&apos;T        
ACTUALLY RESULT IN AN OUTAGE    
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE       

02:34:53.564 --> 02:34:56.398
ACTUALLY RESULT IN AN OUTAGE    
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE       
MENTIONED RESPONSIBILITY TO ITS 

02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:58.901
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE       
MENTIONED RESPONSIBILITY TO ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS TO DO IT MEANS IT  

02:34:58.903 --> 02:34:59.835
MENTIONED RESPONSIBILITY TO ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS TO DO IT MEANS IT  
DOESN&apos;T WANT TO CUT INTO THOSE  

02:34:59.837 --> 02:35:00.703
SHAREHOLDERS TO DO IT MEANS IT  
DOESN&apos;T WANT TO CUT INTO THOSE  
AND INCREASE THE OVERHEAD COSTS 

02:35:00.705 --> 02:35:03.572
DOESN&apos;T WANT TO CUT INTO THOSE  
AND INCREASE THE OVERHEAD COSTS 
IN ORDER TO BUILD THE

OPERATES THE TRANSMISSION LINES 
IT CAN MAKE THOSE UPGRADES TO   
INCREASE REDUNDANCY AND REDUCE  

02:35:12.049 --> 02:35:14.850
IT CAN MAKE THOSE UPGRADES TO   
INCREASE REDUNDANCY AND REDUCE  
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OUTAGE    

02:35:14.852 --> 02:35:15.718
INCREASE REDUNDANCY AND REDUCE  
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OUTAGE    
ESPECIALLY AS LARGE STORMS LIKE 

02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:16.385
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OUTAGE    
ESPECIALLY AS LARGE STORMS LIKE 
THE ONE THAT HAPPENED JUST A    

02:35:16.387 --> 02:35:19.255
ESPECIALLY AS LARGE STORMS LIKE 
THE ONE THAT HAPPENED JUST A    
MONTH AGO WILL INCREASE OVER

THE NEXT FEW DECADES.           

02:35:19.923 --> 02:35:22.023
MONTH AGO WILL INCREASE OVER    
THE NEXT FEW DECADES.           
IT&apos;S IMPORTANT TO PLAN FOR THAT 

02:35:22.025 --> 02:35:22.224
THE NEXT FEW DECADES.           
IT&apos;S IMPORTANT TO PLAN FOR THAT

02:35:27.899 --> 02:35:30.632
IT&apos;S NO SECRET THAT YOU&apos;RE SLOW 
TO REPLACE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT  
AGES THERE CUT LOTS OF FOLKS    

02:35:30.634 --> 02:35:34.470
TO REPLACE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT  
AGES THERE CUT LOTS OF FOLKS    
THAT HAVE A FEW YEARS AGO AND

AGES THERE CUT LOTS OF FOLKS    
THAT HAVE A FEW YEARS AGO AND   
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THAT ALSO     

02:35:35.339 --> 02:35:38.340

YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THAT ALSO     
INCREASES OVERHEAD AND IMPACTS

INCREASES OVERHEAD AND IMPACTS  
THEIR PROFITS WHEN YOU HAVE A

REPLACE IT AND YOU NEED A       
CENTRALIZED GRID OBVIOUSLY THAT 

02:36:05.136 --> 02:36:07.202
REPLACE IT AND YOU NEED A       
CENTRALIZED GRID OBVIOUSLY THAT 
SIU DOES A LOT OF DISTRIBUTED

GREAT THAT IT&apos;S BUILDING BUT    
YOU HAVE TO UPDATE THE          
TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE IF  

02:36:11.909 --> 02:36:12.707
YOU HAVE TO UPDATE THE          
TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE IF  
YOU&apos;RE GOING TO INTEGRATE THOSE 

02:36:12.709 --> 02:36:15.377
TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE IF  
YOU&apos;RE GOING TO INTEGRATE THOSE 
THINGS AS I&apos;M SURE YOU ALREADY  

02:36:15.379 --> 02:36:16.311
YOU&apos;RE GOING TO INTEGRATE THOSE 
THINGS AS I&apos;M SURE YOU ALREADY  
KNOW, POWER WAS MADE TO FLOW    

02:36:16.313 --> 02:36:19.147
THINGS AS I&apos;M SURE YOU ALREADY  
KNOW, POWER WAS MADE TO FLOW    
ONE WAY IN A GRID.

KNOW, POWER WAS MADE TO FLOW    
ONE WAY IN A GRID.              
SO YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT         

02:36:20.384 --> 02:36:21.150
ONE WAY IN A GRID.              
SO YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT         
OF UPGRADES IN ORDER TO GET     

02:36:21.152 --> 02:36:22.417
SO YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT         
OF UPGRADES IN ORDER TO GET     
THAT BACK AND FORTH FLOW AND    

02:36:22.419 --> 02:36:23.218
OF UPGRADES IN ORDER TO GET     
THAT BACK AND FORTH FLOW AND    
IT&apos;S THE SYSTEMS AS THEY&apos;RE     

02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:26.422
THAT BACK AND FORTH FLOW AND    
IT&apos;S THE SYSTEMS AS THEY&apos;RE     
BUILT REALLY AREN&apos;T AREN&apos;T      

02:36:26.424 --> 02:36:27.156
IT&apos;S THE SYSTEMS AS THEY&apos;RE     
BUILT REALLY AREN&apos;T AREN&apos;T      
DESIGNED FOR AN EFFECTIVE       

02:36:27.158 --> 02:36:30.225
BUILT REALLY AREN&apos;T AREN&apos;T      
DESIGNED FOR AN EFFECTIVE       
DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES       

02:36:30.227 --> 02:36:34.063
DESIGNED FOR AN EFFECTIVE       
DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES       
SPREAD OUT AROUND AROUND HOMES  

02:36:34.065 --> 02:36:34.263
DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES

SPREAD OUT AROUND AROUND HOMES  
.                               
SO THERE&apos;S A REASON THAT DC HAS 

02:36:35.365 --> 02:36:38.600
.                               
SO THERE&apos;S A REASON THAT DC HAS 
THAT THAT CILACAP THAT CILACAP. 

02:36:38.602 --> 02:36:38.933
SO THERE&apos;S A REASON THAT DC HAS 
THAT THAT CILACAP THAT CILACAP. 
RIGHT.                          

02:36:38.935 --> 02:36:39.768
THAT THAT CILACAP THAT CILACAP. 
RIGHT.                          
IT&apos;S BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT     

02:36:39.770 --> 02:36:41.370
RIGHT.                          
IT&apos;S BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT     
ONLY UP UPDATE THE              

02:36:41.372 --> 02:36:42.171
IT&apos;S BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT     
ONLY UP UPDATE THE              
INFRASTRUCTURE IF THEY PROMOTE  

02:36:42.173 --> 02:36:46.041
ONLY UP UPDATE THE              
INFRASTRUCTURE IF THEY PROMOTE  
PEOPLE FROM INCREASING          

02:36:46.043 --> 02:36:49.344
INFRASTRUCTURE IF THEY PROMOTE  
PEOPLE FROM INCREASING          
DECREASING THEIR SOLAR HOMES.   

02:36:49.346 --> 02:36:50.512
PEOPLE FROM INCREASING          
DECREASING THEIR SOLAR HOMES.   
SO WHEN YOU OPERATE AND OWN THE

SO WHEN YOU OPERATE AND OWN THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN MORE
