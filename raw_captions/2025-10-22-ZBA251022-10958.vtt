THOSE WINDOWS SO THIS FOOTPRINT 
DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK WHEN   
WE TALK ABOUT BUILDING          

00:19:44.988 --> 00:19:45.554
DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK WHEN   
WE TALK ABOUT BUILDING          
RESILIENCY BECAUSE IT'S         

00:19:45.556 --> 00:19:46.155
WE TALK ABOUT BUILDING

FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE GRADE    

00:19:53.097 --> 00:19:55.664
RAILROAD BERM WHICH IS ABOUT    
FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE GRADE    
WHERE IT'S AT AND THEN          

00:19:55.666 --> 00:19:56.498
FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE GRADE    
WHERE IT'S AT AND THEN          
ADDITIONALLY THE TRAIN THAT     

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.299
WHERE IT'S AT AND THEN          
ADDITIONALLY THE TRAIN THAT     
COMES BY WILL BE AT ANOTHER TEN 

00:19:57.301 --> 00:20:00.136
ADDITIONALLY THE TRAIN THAT     
COMES BY WILL BE AT ANOTHER TEN 
TO TWELVE FEET OF HEIGHT        

00:20:00.138 --> 00:20:00.569
COMES BY WILL BE AT ANOTHER TEN 
TO TWELVE FEET OF HEIGHT        
RUNNING ALONG THAT.             

00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:01.404
TO TWELVE FEET OF HEIGHT        
RUNNING ALONG THAT.             
SO THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY TWO     

00:20:01.406 --> 00:20:04.106
RUNNING ALONG THAT.             
SO THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY TWO     
FEET OF BOUNDARY WHEN WE        

00:20:04.108 --> 00:20:04.774
SO THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY TWO     
FEET OF BOUNDARY WHEN WE        
CONSIDER THAT ALONG THAT        

00:20:04.776 --> 00:20:07.576
FEET OF BOUNDARY WHEN WE        
CONSIDER THAT ALONG THAT        
WESTERLY SIDE IT ALSO           

00:20:07.578 --> 00:20:08.310
CONSIDER THAT ALONG THAT        
WESTERLY SIDE IT ALSO           
INTERNALIZES THE OPEN SPACE     

00:20:08.312 --> 00:20:10.645
WESTERLY SIDE IT ALSO           
INTERNALIZES THE OPEN SPACE     
WHICH THERE IS GUIDANCE IN SOME

00:20:15.586 --> 00:20:16.818
OPEN SPACE TO BE ADJACENT TO    
PUBLIC WAYS WHERE POSSIBLE.     
SO I'M GOING TO GO TO THE NEXT  

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.988
PUBLIC WAYS WHERE POSSIBLE.     
SO I'M GOING TO GO TO THE NEXT  
SLIDE.                          

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.122
SO I'M GOING TO GO TO THE NEXT  
SLIDE.                          
SO THIS SHOWS THE BUILDING FOR  

00:20:20.124 --> 00:20:23.225
SLIDE.                          
SO THIS SHOWS THE BUILDING FOR  
THE FOOTPRINT THAT WE HAVE      

00:20:23.227 --> 00:20:23.625
SO THIS SHOWS THE BUILDING FOR  
THE FOOTPRINT THAT WE HAVE      
PROPOSED.

POSSIBLE.                       
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS FOOTPRINT 
IS THAT IF WE WERE TO BUILD     

00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:20.582
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS FOOTPRINT 
IS THAT IF WE WERE TO BUILD     
THIS THE FULL SEVEN STOREYS TO  

00:21:20.584 --> 00:21:21.349
IS THAT IF WE WERE TO BUILD     
THIS THE FULL SEVEN STOREYS TO  
MAX OUT WHAT WE COULD BUILD     

00:21:21.351 --> 00:21:24.586
THIS THE FULL SEVEN STOREYS TO

MAX OUT WHAT WE COULD BUILD     
WHEN WE ARE USING THE FULL      
PERIMETER OF THE SITE, WE WOULD 

00:21:25.456 --> 00:21:26.121
WHEN WE ARE USING THE FULL      
PERIMETER OF THE SITE, WE WOULD 
END UP WITH A BUILDING THAT     

00:21:26.123 --> 00:21:28.557
PERIMETER OF THE SITE, WE WOULD 
END UP WITH A BUILDING THAT     
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY A        

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:29.391
END UP WITH A BUILDING THAT     
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY A        
HEALTHY, RESILIENT WAY TO BUILD 

00:21:29.393 --> 00:21:30.192
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY A        
HEALTHY, RESILIENT WAY TO BUILD 
BECAUSE WE CAN'T PUT OPENINGS   

00:21:30.194 --> 00:21:32.828
HEALTHY, RESILIENT WAY TO BUILD 
BECAUSE WE CAN'T PUT OPENINGS   
ALONG THE PROPERTY LINE THAT    

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.729
BECAUSE WE CAN'T PUT OPENINGS   
ALONG THE PROPERTY LINE THAT    
ARE INTERIOR TO THE TO THE

ARE INTERIOR TO THE TO THE      
PARCEL THAT WOULD AFFECT THE    
INTERIOR BUILDING BECAUSE IT    

00:21:37.468 --> 00:21:40.101
PARCEL THAT WOULD AFFECT THE    
INTERIOR BUILDING BECAUSE IT    
WOULD TAKE AWAY THEIR WINDOWS   

00:21:40.103 --> 00:21:40.869
INTERIOR BUILDING BECAUSE IT    
WOULD TAKE AWAY THEIR WINDOWS   
AND THEIR ACCESS TO DAYLIGHT    

00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:43.639
WOULD TAKE AWAY THEIR WINDOWS   
AND THEIR ACCESS TO DAYLIGHT    
AND IT WOULD MEAN WE JUST DON'T 

00:21:43.641 --> 00:21:44.439
AND THEIR ACCESS TO DAYLIGHT    
AND IT WOULD MEAN WE JUST DON'T 
NECESSARILY HAVE A LONG TERM    

00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:47.509
AND IT WOULD MEAN WE JUST DON'T 
NECESSARILY HAVE A LONG TERM    
FUNCTIONAL SPACE BY DOING THAT. 

00:21:47.511 --> 00:21:48.844
NECESSARILY HAVE A LONG TERM    
FUNCTIONAL SPACE BY DOING THAT. 
SO THAT LED TO THE NEXT SLIDE   

00:21:48.846 --> 00:21:51.947
FUNCTIONAL SPACE BY DOING THAT. 
SO THAT LED TO THE NEXT SLIDE   
WHICH SHOWS THE FOOTPRINT       

00:21:51.949 --> 00:21:52.647
SO THAT LED TO THE NEXT SLIDE   
WHICH SHOWS THE FOOTPRINT       
OF THE BUILDING, THE TYPICAL    

00:21:52.649 --> 00:21:53.348
WHICH SHOWS THE FOOTPRINT

FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING AS IT 
RISES ABOVE THAT FIRST LEVEL    
GRADE THE MAGENTA ER SHADED     

00:21:56.554 --> 00:22:00.188
RISES ABOVE THAT FIRST LEVEL    
GRADE THE MAGENTA ER SHADED     
AREA IS THE SET BACK WE WERE    

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.756
GRADE THE MAGENTA ER SHADED     
AREA IS THE SET BACK WE WERE    
PROPOSING THAT'S FAR ENOUGH     

00:22:00.758 --> 00:22:02.390
AREA IS THE SET BACK WE WERE    
PROPOSING THAT'S FAR ENOUGH     
BACK FROM THE OLD BUILDING      

00:22:02.392 --> 00:22:03.225
PROPOSING THAT'S FAR ENOUGH     
BACK FROM THE OLD BUILDING      
BUILDING DID NOT REQUIRE ANY    

00:22:03.227 --> 00:22:03.959
BACK FROM THE OLD BUILDING      
BUILDING DID NOT REQUIRE ANY    
ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE ON   

00:22:03.961 --> 00:22:06.295
BUILDING DID NOT REQUIRE ANY    
ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE ON   
THEIR BUILDING TO PROTECT IT    

00:22:06.297 --> 00:22:06.728

ROBUST FIRE CODE AND NOW THEY   

00:22:11.235 --> 00:22:14.436
BUILT WE DIDN'T HAVE SO SUCH    
ROBUST FIRE CODE AND NOW THEY   
WANT ABOUT A 30 FOOT SETBACK    

00:22:14.438 --> 00:22:15.103
ROBUST FIRE CODE AND NOW THEY   
WANT ABOUT A 30 FOOT SETBACK    
BETWEEN BUILDINGS TO HAVE       

00:22:15.105 --> 00:22:15.838
WANT ABOUT A 30 FOOT SETBACK

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.674
BETWEEN BUILDINGS TO HAVE       
OPENINGS IN THE WALL PERIOD.    
SO WE IDENTIFIED THIS AMOUNT    

00:22:19.676 --> 00:22:20.342
OPENINGS IN THE WALL PERIOD.    
SO WE IDENTIFIED THIS AMOUNT    
OF SETBACK AND THAT'S THE       

00:22:20.344 --> 00:22:22.211
SO WE IDENTIFIED THIS AMOUNT    
OF SETBACK AND THAT'S THE       
BUILDING THAT RISES ABOVE THAT  

00:22:22.213 --> 00:22:23.012
OF SETBACK AND THAT'S THE

WOULD BE A REASONABLE ASK TO TO 
DEVELOP A FOOTPRINT THAT WORKED 

00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:28.050
WOULD BE A REASONABLE ASK TO TO

01:13:55.269 --> 01:13:58.571
AREA THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD 
IN THE REAR OPEN YARD AS WE     
CALL THE BLACK OUTLINE IS THE   

01:13:58.573 --> 01:14:02.241
IN THE REAR OPEN YARD AS WE     
CALL THE BLACK OUTLINE IS THE   
EXISTING GARAGE AND THEN WHAT   

01:14:02.243 --> 01:14:03.042
CALL THE BLACK OUTLINE IS THE   
EXISTING GARAGE AND THEN WHAT   
WE HAVE IN BLUE IS ACTUALLY     

01:14:03.044 --> 01:14:06.378
EXISTING GARAGE AND THEN WHAT   
WE HAVE IN BLUE IS ACTUALLY     
WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWABLE PER THE

01:14:09.016 --> 01:14:10.249
WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWABLE PER THE

SO THE AREA IN RED IS WHAT IS   

01:14:10.251 --> 01:14:12.885
ZONING CODE AS IT'S WRITTEN.    
SO THE AREA IN RED IS WHAT IS

SO OF THIS ENTIRE GARAGE YOU    
COULD SEE IT WOULD NO LONGER BE

SO OF THIS ENTIRE GARAGE YOU    
COULD SEE IT WOULD NO LONGER BE 
ABLE TO BE A TWO STALL GARAGE

IS ACTUALLY TO THE LEFT BUT     
ALONG THAT THE WEST BOUNDARY IS

ALONG THAT THE WEST BOUNDARY IS 
ALSO JUST MAKING THINGS A       

01:14:35.343 --> 01:14:39.178
ALONG THAT THE WEST BOUNDARY IS 
ALSO JUST MAKING THINGS A

                    WHAT I'VE   
BE ABLE TO KNOW JUST IN         
ADDITION TO THE FRONT YARD STEP 

01:32:17.704 --> 01:32:18.436
BE ABLE TO KNOW JUST IN         
ADDITION TO THE FRONT YARD STEP 
BACK, IT'S ALSO THE AVERAGE     

01:32:18.438 --> 01:32:20.905
ADDITION TO THE FRONT YARD STEP 
BACK, IT'S ALSO THE AVERAGE     
FRONT STEP FOR THE NEIGHBORING  

01:32:20.907 --> 01:32:21.573
BACK, IT'S ALSO THE AVERAGE     
FRONT STEP FOR THE NEIGHBORING  
PROPERTIES WHICH THEN TAKES     

01:32:21.575 --> 01:32:24.675
FRONT STEP FOR THE NEIGHBORING  
PROPERTIES WHICH THEN TAKES     
AWAY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY     

01:32:24.677 --> 01:32:25.509
PROPERTIES WHICH THEN TAKES     
AWAY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY     
EIGHT OF YOUR OPEN YARD WHICH   

01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:28.513
AWAY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY     
EIGHT OF YOUR OPEN YARD WHICH   
THEN EQUATES TO A FIFTY SQUARE

EIGHT OF YOUR OPEN YARD WHICH   
THEN EQUATES TO A FIFTY SQUARE  
FEET OF BUILDABLE SPACE.        

01:32:29.249 --> 01:32:31.783
THEN EQUATES TO A FIFTY SQUARE  
FEET OF BUILDABLE SPACE.        
SO THAT'S ALSO KIND ENTERING    

01:32:31.785 --> 01:32:32.784
FEET OF BUILDABLE SPACE.        
SO THAT'S ALSO KIND ENTERING    
WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IN
