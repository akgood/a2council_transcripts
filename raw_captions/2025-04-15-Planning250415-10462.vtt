PROVIDES A LOT OF CONTEXT FOR   
WHY CHANGE IS NECESSARY.        
THERE'S ONE POINT ON PAGE       

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.067
WHY CHANGE IS NECESSARY.        
THERE'S ONE POINT ON PAGE       
EIGHTEEN I THINK COULD BE       

00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.734
THERE'S ONE POINT ON PAGE       
EIGHTEEN I THINK COULD BE       
IMPROVED AND THERE'S AN

EIGHTEEN I THINK COULD BE       
IMPROVED AND THERE'S AN         
ARGUMENT SPECIFICALLY IT SAYS   

00:16:48.706 --> 00:16:49.405
IMPROVED AND THERE'S AN         
ARGUMENT SPECIFICALLY IT SAYS   
WHILE NEW HOUSING GENERATES     

00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:52.507
ARGUMENT SPECIFICALLY IT SAYS   
WHILE NEW HOUSING GENERATES     
REVENUE FOR THE CITY AND HELPS  

00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:53.108
WHILE NEW HOUSING GENERATES

CAPITALIZE THE AFFORDABLE       
HOUSING TRUST FUND LOSING THE   

00:16:53.845 --> 00:16:57.112
CAPITALIZE THE AFFORDABLE       
HOUSING TRUST FUND LOSING THE   
NONRESIDENTIAL TAX BASE WILL    

00:16:57.114 --> 00:16:57.847
HOUSING TRUST FUND LOSING THE   
NONRESIDENTIAL TAX BASE WILL    
SHIFT EVEN GREATER BURDEN ONTO  

00:16:57.849 --> 00:17:00.582
NONRESIDENTIAL TAX BASE WILL    
SHIFT EVEN GREATER BURDEN ONTO  
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES BOTH     

00:17:00.584 --> 00:17:01.283
SHIFT EVEN GREATER BURDEN ONTO  
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES BOTH     
TRADITIONAL AND COMMERCIAL      

00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:02.017
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES BOTH     
TRADITIONAL AND COMMERCIAL      
MULTIFAMILY FURTHER IMPACTING   

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:04.519
TRADITIONAL AND COMMERCIAL      
MULTIFAMILY FURTHER IMPACTING   
AFFORDABILITY.                  

00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:05.554
MULTIFAMILY FURTHER IMPACTING   
AFFORDABILITY.                  
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOTALLY 

00:17:05.556 --> 00:17:09.024
AFFORDABILITY.                  
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOTALLY 
LOGICAL BECAUSE IT CONFUSES THE 

00:17:09.026 --> 00:17:12.361
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOTALLY 
LOGICAL BECAUSE IT CONFUSES THE 
AGGREGATE BURDEN BETWEEN LAND   

00:17:12.363 --> 00:17:13.295
LOGICAL BECAUSE IT CONFUSES THE 
AGGREGATE BURDEN BETWEEN LAND   
USES WITH THE ACTUAL BURDEN ON  

00:17:13.297 --> 00:17:14.062
AGGREGATE BURDEN BETWEEN LAND   
USES WITH THE ACTUAL BURDEN ON  
EACH INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER. 

00:17:14.064 --> 00:17:17.333
USES WITH THE ACTUAL BURDEN ON  
EACH INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER. 
SO IF A NEW APARTMENT BUILDING  

00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:20.069
EACH INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER. 
SO IF A NEW APARTMENT BUILDING  
GOES INTO A PLACE THAT'S        

00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:20.802
SO IF A NEW APARTMENT BUILDING  
GOES INTO A PLACE THAT'S        
CURRENTLY LOW DENSITY           

00:17:20.804 --> 00:17:21.303
GOES INTO A PLACE THAT'S        
CURRENTLY LOW DENSITY           
COMMERCIAL FOR EXAMPLE AND      

00:17:21.305 --> 00:17:23.839
CURRENTLY LOW DENSITY           
COMMERCIAL FOR EXAMPLE AND      
THERE'S A BIG INCREASE IN TAX   

00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:24.640
COMMERCIAL FOR EXAMPLE AND      
THERE'S A BIG INCREASE IN TAX   
REVENUE, THE AGGREGATE BURDEN   

00:17:24.642 --> 00:17:27.809
THERE'S A BIG INCREASE IN TAX   
REVENUE, THE AGGREGATE BURDEN   
OF RESIDENTIAL GOES UP, THAT    

00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:28.577
REVENUE, THE AGGREGATE BURDEN   
OF RESIDENTIAL GOES UP, THAT    
PERCENTAGE GOES UP BECAUSE NOW  

00:17:28.579 --> 00:17:31.613
OF RESIDENTIAL GOES UP, THAT    
PERCENTAGE GOES UP BECAUSE NOW  
MORE OF THE PROPERTY TAX BASE   

00:17:31.615 --> 00:17:32.415
PERCENTAGE GOES UP BECAUSE NOW  
MORE OF THE PROPERTY TAX BASE   
IS RESIDENTIAL BUT THE BURDEN   

00:17:32.417 --> 00:17:35.751
MORE OF THE PROPERTY TAX BASE   
IS RESIDENTIAL BUT THE BURDEN   
ON EACH INDIVIDUAL GOES DOWN SO 

00:17:35.753 --> 00:17:36.551
IS RESIDENTIAL BUT THE BURDEN   
ON EACH INDIVIDUAL GOES DOWN SO 
IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THAT NEW      

00:17:36.553 --> 00:17:39.788
ON EACH INDIVIDUAL GOES DOWN SO 
IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THAT NEW      
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IS GOING   

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.689
IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THAT NEW      
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IS GOING   
TO HURT THE AFFORDABILITY       

00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:40.989
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IS GOING   
TO HURT THE AFFORDABILITY       
OF HOUSING.                     

00:17:40.991 --> 00:17:43.125
TO HURT THE AFFORDABILITY       
OF HOUSING.                     
SO I THINK YOU JUST REMOVE IT   

00:17:43.127 --> 00:17:43.892
OF HOUSING.                     
SO I THINK YOU JUST REMOVE IT   
AND THE REASON THIS IS          

00:17:43.894 --> 00:17:46.928
SO I THINK YOU JUST REMOVE IT   
AND THE REASON THIS IS          
IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THERE'S    

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:47.663
AND THE REASON THIS IS          
IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THERE'S    
ACTUALLY AN AREA OR AREAS IN    

00:17:47.665 --> 00:17:48.430
IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THERE'S    
ACTUALLY AN AREA OR AREAS IN

YOU'RE WALKING A LITTLE BIT     
FARTHER AND THAT'S WHERE YOU    

01:03:50.158 --> 01:03:53.959
YOU'RE WALKING A LITTLE BIT     
FARTHER AND THAT'S WHERE YOU    
ARE ENTERING WHAT MATT WAS      

01:03:53.961 --> 01:03:54.727
FARTHER AND THAT'S WHERE YOU    
ARE ENTERING WHAT MATT WAS      
SAYING THAT THE CENTER PLACE    

01:03:54.729 --> 01:03:56.428
ARE ENTERING WHAT MATT WAS      
SAYING THAT THE CENTER PLACE    
THAT PLAZA THAT WHEN YOU CAN

01:04:01.937 --> 01:04:04.771
KIDS ON AND PLAY AND IN REGARDS 
TO THE ELEVATION AND THE        
EXTERIOR USE OF MATERIALS THAT  

01:04:04.773 --> 01:04:08.407
TO THE ELEVATION AND THE        
EXTERIOR USE OF MATERIALS THAT  
WE USED ALL NATURAL TOWNE'S     

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:09.308
EXTERIOR USE OF MATERIALS THAT  
WE USED ALL NATURAL TOWNE'S     
MATERIALS AND TRYING TO CREATE  

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:12.345
WE USED ALL NATURAL TOWNE'S     
MATERIALS AND TRYING TO CREATE  
AND THIS ELEGANT ELEGANT        

01:04:12.347 --> 01:04:12.912
MATERIALS AND TRYING TO CREATE  
AND THIS ELEGANT ELEGANT        
ELEVATION HERE.                 

01:04:12.914 --> 01:04:16.716
AND THIS ELEGANT ELEGANT        
ELEVATION HERE.                 
SO AND MY NEXT SLIDE HERE I     

01:04:16.718 --> 01:04:17.650
ELEVATION HERE.                 
SO AND MY NEXT SLIDE HERE I     
JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT  

01:04:17.652 --> 01:04:20.487
SO AND MY NEXT SLIDE HERE I     
JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT  
ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY.           

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:21.721
JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT  
ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY.           
SO FIRST OF ALL, LIKE WHEN I'M  

01:04:21.723 --> 01:04:22.155
ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY.           
SO FIRST OF ALL, LIKE WHEN I'M  
THINKING ABOUT THIS             

01:04:22.157 --> 01:04:24.857
SO FIRST OF ALL, LIKE WHEN I'M  
THINKING ABOUT THIS             
NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING OF THIS,  

01:04:24.859 --> 01:04:25.558
THINKING ABOUT THIS             
NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING OF THIS,  
WHAT IS THE MORE SUSTAINABLE    

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.127
NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING OF THIS,  
WHAT IS THE MORE SUSTAINABLE    
THAT WALKING IN THE SPACE AND   

01:04:28.129 --> 01:04:31.397
WHAT IS THE MORE SUSTAINABLE    
THAT WALKING IN THE SPACE AND   
USING PUBLIC TRANSPORT THIS IS  

01:04:31.399 --> 01:04:32.198
THAT WALKING IN THE SPACE AND   
USING PUBLIC TRANSPORT THIS IS  
JUST ITSELF BY ITSELF.          

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.265
USING PUBLIC TRANSPORT THIS IS  
JUST ITSELF BY ITSELF.          
I THINK THAT'S JUST NUMBER ONE  

01:04:33.267 --> 01:04:36.236
JUST ITSELF BY ITSELF.          
I THINK THAT'S JUST NUMBER ONE  
POINT ACTUALLY SELLS FOR THE    

01:04:36.238 --> 01:04:39.738
I THINK THAT'S JUST NUMBER ONE  
POINT ACTUALLY SELLS FOR THE    
POINT OF SUSTAINABILITY HERE WE 

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.473
POINT ACTUALLY SELLS FOR THE    
POINT OF SUSTAINABILITY HERE WE 
SIGN THAT BUILDING THE BUILDING 

01:04:40.475 --> 01:04:43.576
POINT OF SUSTAINABILITY HERE WE 
SIGN THAT BUILDING THE BUILDING 
AND BUILD ENVIRONMENT.          

01:04:43.578 --> 01:04:44.644
SIGN THAT BUILDING THE BUILDING 
AND BUILD ENVIRONMENT.          
SO WE ALSO GOING TO INCORPORATE 

01:04:44.646 --> 01:04:47.646
AND BUILD ENVIRONMENT.          
SO WE ALSO GOING TO INCORPORATE 
THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN 

01:04:47.648 --> 01:04:50.482
SO WE ALSO GOING TO INCORPORATE 
THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN 
DIVERTING DEMOLITION DEBRIS AND 

01:04:50.484 --> 01:04:51.050
THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN 
DIVERTING DEMOLITION DEBRIS AND 
AND SELECTING THEM.             

01:04:51.052 --> 01:04:55.188
DIVERTING DEMOLITION DEBRIS AND 
AND SELECTING THEM.             
WE ARE SO THE THE MULTIFAMILY   

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:58.791
AND SELECTING THEM.             
WE ARE SO THE THE MULTIFAMILY   
BUILDINGS ARE USING LIGHT FROM  

01:04:58.793 --> 01:05:02.996
WE ARE SO THE THE MULTIFAMILY   
BUILDINGS ARE USING LIGHT FROM  
WOOD CONSTRUCTION WHICH AS WE   

01:05:02.998 --> 01:05:03.930
BUILDINGS ARE USING LIGHT FROM  
WOOD CONSTRUCTION WHICH AS WE   
KNOW WOOD AS A CARBON SEQUESTER 

01:05:03.932 --> 01:05:07.266
WOOD CONSTRUCTION WHICH AS WE   
KNOW WOOD AS A CARBON SEQUESTER 
SO WE CAN SAY THAT WE'RE USING  

01:05:07.268 --> 01:05:07.867
KNOW WOOD AS A CARBON SEQUESTER 
SO WE CAN SAY THAT WE'RE USING  
LOWER BETA CARBON CARBON        

01:05:07.869 --> 01:05:08.201
SO WE CAN SAY THAT WE'RE USING  
LOWER BETA CARBON CARBON        
MATERIALS.                      

01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:11.170
LOWER BETA CARBON CARBON        
MATERIALS.                      
WE ALSO DID ANALYSIS AND I      

01:05:11.172 --> 01:05:11.937
MATERIALS.                      
WE ALSO DID ANALYSIS AND I      
DON'T KNOW I KNOW THAT I DON'T  

01:05:11.939 --> 01:05:13.739
WE ALSO DID ANALYSIS AND I      
DON'T KNOW I KNOW THAT I DON'T  
HAVE MUCH TIME HERE THAT'S      

01:05:13.741 --> 01:05:14.140
DON'T KNOW I KNOW THAT I DON'T  
HAVE MUCH TIME HERE THAT'S      
SPEEDY.                         

01:05:14.142 --> 01:05:18.644
HAVE MUCH TIME HERE THAT'S      
SPEEDY.                         
BUT WE DID SOME ANALYSIS HERE   

01:05:18.646 --> 01:05:19.311
SPEEDY.                         
BUT WE DID SOME ANALYSIS HERE   
TO COMPARE COLD FOR METAL       

01:05:19.313 --> 01:05:22.748
BUT WE DID SOME ANALYSIS HERE   
TO COMPARE COLD FOR METAL       
FRAMING TO WOOD FRAMING LET'S   

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:23.516
TO COMPARE COLD FOR METAL       
FRAMING TO WOOD FRAMING LET'S   
SAY THIS CONSTRUCTION AND HOW   

01:05:23.518 --> 01:05:26.385
FRAMING TO WOOD FRAMING LET'S   
SAY THIS CONSTRUCTION AND HOW   
MUCH ACTUALLY THIS IS THE       

01:05:26.387 --> 01:05:27.186
SAY THIS CONSTRUCTION AND HOW   
MUCH ACTUALLY THIS IS THE       
CARBON THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THE   

01:05:27.188 --> 01:05:30.756
MUCH ACTUALLY THIS IS THE       
CARBON THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THE   
MATERIAL ITSELF.                

01:05:30.758 --> 01:05:33.659
CARBON THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THE   
MATERIAL ITSELF.                
I WAS SAYING ALL ELECTRIC

PARKING SPOTS EVERY THREE UNITS 

01:06:55.677 --> 01:06:58.744
>> THEY'RE BASICALLY TALKING TO 
PARKING SPOTS EVERY THREE UNITS 
SO THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S A MIXED 

01:06:58.746 --> 01:07:02.448
PARKING SPOTS EVERY THREE UNITS 
SO THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S A MIXED 
USE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THE     

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:03.115
SO THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S A MIXED 
USE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THE     
PARKING IS SHARED DAYTIME

ABOUT WHILE WE'RE REALLY ONLY

ABOUT WHILE WE'RE REALLY ONLY   
ADDING ELEVEN HUNDRED SPACES TO 

01:22:07.988 --> 01:22:10.788
ABOUT WHILE WE'RE REALLY ONLY   
ADDING ELEVEN HUNDRED SPACES TO 
THE EXISTING FIFTEEN HUNDRED    

01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:15.059
ADDING ELEVEN HUNDRED SPACES TO 
THE EXISTING FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:22:15.061 --> 01:22:15.827
THE EXISTING FIFTEEN HUNDRED    
SPACES THAT'S TRUE BUT THE      
FIFTEEN HUNDRED SPACES IS LIKE  

01:22:15.829 --> 01:22:19.197
SPACES THAT'S TRUE BUT THE      
FIFTEEN HUNDRED SPACES IS LIKE  
I SAID MOSTLY UNUSED NOW ANYWAY 

01:22:19.199 --> 01:22:19.864
FIFTEEN HUNDRED SPACES IS LIKE  
I SAID MOSTLY UNUSED NOW ANYWAY 
SO WE'RE REALLY PUTTING IN I    

01:22:19.866 --> 01:22:21.799
I SAID MOSTLY UNUSED NOW ANYWAY 
SO WE'RE REALLY PUTTING IN I    
THINK A LOT OF UNNECESSARY      

01:22:21.801 --> 01:22:26.204
SO WE'RE REALLY PUTTING IN I    
THINK A LOT OF UNNECESSARY      
PARKING AGAIN END OF ONE ONE    

01:22:26.206 --> 01:22:30.074
THINK A LOT OF UNNECESSARY      
PARKING AGAIN END OF ONE ONE    
MORNING BUT I THINK THAT PFM    

01:22:30.076 --> 01:22:30.842
PARKING AGAIN END OF ONE ONE    
MORNING BUT I THINK THAT PFM    
SHOULD GO FROM USING A STANDARD 

01:22:30.844 --> 01:22:32.644
MORNING BUT I THINK THAT PFM    
SHOULD GO FROM USING A STANDARD 
MODEL WHICH THEY'RE DOING NOW   

01:22:32.646 --> 01:22:33.445
SHOULD GO FROM USING A STANDARD 
MODEL WHICH THEY'RE DOING NOW   
TO USING EXPERIENCE BASED MODEL 

01:22:33.447 --> 01:22:36.514
MODEL WHICH THEY'RE DOING NOW   
TO USING EXPERIENCE BASED MODEL 
AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WHAT    

01:22:36.516 --> 01:22:37.449
TO USING EXPERIENCE BASED MODEL 
AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WHAT    
PARKING IS BEING USED ON THAT   

01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:38.183
AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WHAT    
PARKING IS BEING USED ON THAT   
SITE BEFORE MAKING A PROJECTION 

01:22:38.185 --> 01:22:41.486
PARKING IS BEING USED ON THAT   
SITE BEFORE MAKING A PROJECTION 
AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE USED IN  

01:22:41.488 --> 01:22:44.722
SITE BEFORE MAKING A PROJECTION 
AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE USED IN  
THE FUTURE.                     

01:22:44.724 --> 01:22:45.824
AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE USED IN  
THE FUTURE.                     
AND OF COURSE AS MR. HAMMOND    

01:22:45.826 --> 01:22:46.691
THE FUTURE.                     
AND OF COURSE AS MR. HAMMOND    
SAID, A LOT OF THE PARKING      

01:22:46.693 --> 01:22:50.729
AND OF COURSE AS MR. HAMMOND    
SAID, A LOT OF THE PARKING      
SHARED.                         

01:22:50.731 --> 01:22:51.729
SAID, A LOT OF THE PARKING      
SHARED.                         
SO BOTTOM LINE THE SITE PLAN IS 

01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:53.865
SHARED.                         
SO BOTTOM LINE THE SITE PLAN IS 
WAY TOO MUCH PARKING ESPECIALLY 

01:22:53.867 --> 01:22:57.869
SO BOTTOM LINE THE SITE PLAN IS 
WAY TOO MUCH PARKING ESPECIALLY 
FOR TAXI ONE NOW THE EXISTING   

01:22:57.871 --> 01:22:58.670
WAY TOO MUCH PARKING ESPECIALLY 
FOR TAXI ONE NOW THE EXISTING   
PARKING STRUCTURE I UNDERSTAND  

01:22:58.672 --> 01:23:01.606
FOR TAXI ONE NOW THE EXISTING   
PARKING STRUCTURE I UNDERSTAND  
BASED ON THE PHASING WILL       

01:23:01.608 --> 01:23:02.373
PARKING STRUCTURE I UNDERSTAND  
BASED ON THE PHASING WILL       
REMAIN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY NINE 

01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:06.177
BASED ON THE PHASING WILL       
REMAIN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY NINE 
OR SO WHEN THIRD PHASE WILL BE  

01:23:06.179 --> 01:23:09.614
REMAIN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY NINE 
OR SO WHEN THIRD PHASE WILL BE  
CONSTRUCTED.                    

01:23:09.616 --> 01:23:10.682
OR SO WHEN THIRD PHASE WILL BE  
CONSTRUCTED.                    
THEN IT'LL BE DEMOLISHED AND    

01:23:10.684 --> 01:23:12.817
CONSTRUCTED.                    
THEN IT'LL BE DEMOLISHED AND    
WILL BE REPLACED BY THE THIRD   

01:23:12.819 --> 01:23:13.618
THEN IT'LL BE DEMOLISHED AND    
WILL BE REPLACED BY THE THIRD   
PARKING STRUCTURE WHICH IS KEY  

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:16.821
WILL BE REPLACED BY THE THIRD   
PARKING STRUCTURE WHICH IS KEY  
TO IN YOUR DIAGRAM 800 SPACES.  

01:23:16.823 --> 01:23:21.025

A CONVENIENT FOR THOSE PEOPLE.  
I'M THINKING OF PEOPLE THAT     
LIVE IN GEORGETOWN, FOR EXAMPLE 

01:35:46.405 --> 01:35:50.375
I'M THINKING OF PEOPLE THAT     
LIVE IN GEORGETOWN, FOR EXAMPLE 
,EASILY WALKABLE, LIKABLE BUT   

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:51.309
LIVE IN GEORGETOWN, FOR EXAMPLE 
,EASILY WALKABLE, LIKABLE BUT   
NOT EVERYONE AND I COME FROM    

01:35:51.311 --> 01:35:52.110
,EASILY WALKABLE, LIKABLE BUT   
NOT EVERYONE AND I COME FROM    
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT COME FROM 

01:35:52.112 --> 01:35:54.878
NOT EVERYONE AND I COME FROM    
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT COME FROM 
THE SELINE CHELSI SOUTH OF TOWN 

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.546

THE SELINE CHELSI SOUTH OF TOWN 
THE FREEWAYS RIGHT THERE.       

01:35:55.548 --> 01:35:58.382
THE SELINE CHELSI SOUTH OF TOWN 
THE FREEWAYS RIGHT THERE.       
SO IT'S REALLY CONVENIENT       

01:35:58.384 --> 01:35:59.150
THE FREEWAYS RIGHT THERE.       
SO IT'S REALLY CONVENIENT       
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PARK.  

01:35:59.152 --> 01:36:02.486
SO IT'S REALLY CONVENIENT

SO THAT'S THE MATH BEHIND IT.   

01:36:02.488 --> 01:36:03.621
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PARK.  
SO THAT'S THE MATH BEHIND IT.   
AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION

MR. MILLS, YOU CAN REMEMBER WE  
STARTED ON THIS A YEAR AGO AND  
THE FIRST INTRODUCTION IT'S     

01:53:37.476 --> 01:53:37.874
STARTED ON THIS A YEAR AGO AND  
THE FIRST INTRODUCTION IT'S     
EVOLVED.                        

01:53:37.876 --> 01:53:38.208
THE FIRST INTRODUCTION IT'S

AND SO THROUGH THAT EVOLUTION   
THE SUPERBLOCK REFERS TO THE    
EXISTING LOCATION RIGHT NOW     

01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:45.314
THE SUPERBLOCK REFERS TO THE    
EXISTING LOCATION RIGHT NOW     
IT'S JUST IT'S JUST UGLY.       

01:53:45.316 --> 01:53:46.183

OF WHAT THRESHOLD IS IT CLOSED? 

02:05:51.542 --> 02:05:55.044
SO IT'S REALLY JUST A QUESTION  
OF WHAT THRESHOLD IS IT CLOSED? 
IS IT CLOSED 90 PERCENT OF THE  

02:05:55.046 --> 02:05:55.978
OF WHAT THRESHOLD IS IT CLOSED? 
IS IT CLOSED 90 PERCENT OF THE  
TIME IS IT CLOSED NINETY FIVE   

02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:58.580
IS IT CLOSED 90 PERCENT OF THE

10 PERCENT OF THE TIME.         
SO TO ME THERE'S A GRADIENT I   
WOULD ADVOCATE FOR DESIGNING IT 

02:06:06.691 --> 02:06:07.556
SO TO ME THERE'S A GRADIENT I   
WOULD ADVOCATE FOR DESIGNING IT 
AS A PEDESTRIAN SPACE THAT

BUT LET ME JUST SAY I MEAN I    

02:07:39.650 --> 02:07:40.416
YOU AGREE WITH ME ON THE SPOT   
BUT LET ME JUST SAY I MEAN I    
THINK IT'S IT'S LIKE TWO SIDES  

02:07:40.418 --> 02:07:41.283
BUT LET ME JUST SAY I MEAN I    
THINK IT'S IT'S LIKE TWO SIDES  
OF THE SAME.                    

02:07:41.285 --> 02:07:41.684
THINK IT'S IT'S LIKE TWO SIDES  
OF THE SAME.                    
RIGHT.                          

02:07:41.686 --> 02:07:42.584
OF THE SAME.                    
RIGHT.                          
SO WE COULD TALK ABOUT MAIN     

02:07:42.586 --> 02:07:45.120
RIGHT.                          
SO WE COULD TALK ABOUT MAIN     
STREET DOWNTOWN BEING ALSO A    

02:07:45.122 --> 02:07:45.821
SO WE COULD TALK ABOUT MAIN     
STREET DOWNTOWN BEING ALSO A    
PLACE I WOULD NEVER DRIVE       

02:07:45.823 --> 02:07:46.555
STREET DOWNTOWN BEING ALSO A    
PLACE I WOULD NEVER DRIVE       
THROUGH BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO    

02:07:46.557 --> 02:07:49.358
PLACE I WOULD NEVER DRIVE       
THROUGH BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO    
DEAL WITH THE TRAFFIC THE RIGHT 

02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.192
THROUGH BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO    
DEAL WITH THE TRAFFIC THE RIGHT 
I WOULD ALWAYS GO AROUND IF I   

02:07:50.194 --> 02:07:50.659
DEAL WITH THE TRAFFIC THE RIGHT 
I WOULD ALWAYS GO AROUND IF I   
NEEDED TO GO.                   

02:07:50.661 --> 02:07:53.929
I WOULD ALWAYS GO AROUND IF I   
NEEDED TO GO.                   
HOWEVER, WE ALSO I THINK        

02:07:53.931 --> 02:07:54.530
NEEDED TO GO.                   
HOWEVER, WE ALSO I THINK        
PROBABLY CAN AGREE THAT IT'S    

02:07:54.532 --> 02:07:55.330
HOWEVER, WE ALSO I THINK        
PROBABLY CAN AGREE THAT IT'S    
MUCH NICER IN THE SUMMER WHEN   

02:07:55.332 --> 02:07:57.933
PROBABLY CAN AGREE THAT IT'S    
MUCH NICER IN THE SUMMER WHEN   
IT'S ACTUALLY CLOSE TO          

02:07:57.935 --> 02:07:58.600
MUCH NICER IN THE SUMMER WHEN   
IT'S ACTUALLY CLOSE TO          
AUTOMOBILES COMPLETELY SO.      

02:07:58.602 --> 02:07:59.635
IT'S ACTUALLY CLOSE TO          
AUTOMOBILES COMPLETELY SO.      
AND I THINK THAT FOR PEDESTRIAN 

02:07:59.637 --> 02:08:02.505
AUTOMOBILES COMPLETELY SO.      
AND I THINK THAT FOR PEDESTRIAN 
SAFETY LIKE SAFETY PEOPLE WITH  

02:08:02.507 --> 02:08:03.372
AND I THINK THAT FOR PEDESTRIAN 
SAFETY LIKE SAFETY PEOPLE WITH  
STROLLERS ALL OVER THE CITY AND 

02:08:03.374 --> 02:08:05.641
SAFETY LIKE SAFETY PEOPLE WITH  
STROLLERS ALL OVER THE CITY AND 
ALSO IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE   

02:08:05.643 --> 02:08:05.974
STROLLERS ALL OVER THE CITY AND 
ALSO IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE   
CLOSE.

ALSO IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE   
CLOSE.

COULD NOT HELP MYSELF IN        
EARLIER PRESENTATIONS FROM THIS 

02:09:22.753 --> 02:09:26.122
COULD NOT HELP MYSELF IN        
EARLIER PRESENTATIONS FROM THIS 
TEAM THEY HAD EMPHASIZED HOW    

02:09:26.124 --> 02:09:26.989
EARLIER PRESENTATIONS FROM THIS 
TEAM THEY HAD EMPHASIZED HOW    
THEY HAD DESIGNED THE PROJECT   

02:09:26.991 --> 02:09:27.722
TEAM THEY HAD EMPHASIZED HOW    
THEY HAD DESIGNED THE PROJECT   
SO THAT THAT MAIN STREET COULD  

02:09:27.724 --> 02:09:30.659
THEY HAD DESIGNED THE PROJECT   
SO THAT THAT MAIN STREET COULD  
BE CLOSED AND YET STILL CROSS   

02:09:30.661 --> 02:09:33.995
SO THAT THAT MAIN STREET COULD  
BE CLOSED AND YET STILL CROSS   
ACCESS CAN STILL BE MAINTAINED  

02:09:33.997 --> 02:09:34.796
BE CLOSED AND YET STILL CROSS   
ACCESS CAN STILL BE MAINTAINED  
TO ALL OF THE PARKING           

02:09:34.798 --> 02:09:35.464
ACCESS CAN STILL BE MAINTAINED  
TO ALL OF THE PARKING           
STRUCTURES TOLD THE RESIDENTIAL 

02:09:35.466 --> 02:09:38.234
TO ALL OF THE PARKING           
STRUCTURES TOLD THE RESIDENTIAL 
BUILDINGS THE COMMERCIAL ROADS  

02:09:38.236 --> 02:09:38.767
STRUCTURES TOLD THE RESIDENTIAL 
BUILDINGS THE COMMERCIAL ROADS  
AND SO FORTH.                   

02:09:38.769 --> 02:09:39.568
BUILDINGS THE COMMERCIAL ROADS  
AND SO FORTH.                   
I THINK THEIR INTENTION IS TO   

02:09:39.570 --> 02:09:42.404
AND SO FORTH.                   
I THINK THEIR INTENTION IS TO   
CLOSE THEM FREQUENTLY AND OFTEN 

02:09:42.406 --> 02:09:43.171
I THINK THEIR INTENTION IS TO   
CLOSE THEM FREQUENTLY AND OFTEN 
EVERY SINGLE TIME THERE IS AN   

02:09:43.173 --> 02:09:43.772
CLOSE THEM FREQUENTLY AND OFTEN 
EVERY SINGLE TIME THERE IS AN   
EVENT THERE WOULD NOT BE        

02:09:43.774 --> 02:09:46.075
EVERY SINGLE TIME THERE IS AN   
EVENT THERE WOULD NOT BE        
THROUGH TRAFFIC DURING THE      

02:09:46.077 --> 02:09:46.942
EVENT THERE WOULD NOT BE        
THROUGH TRAFFIC DURING THE      
EVENT AND OPERATED VERY SIMILAR 

02:09:46.944 --> 02:09:47.476
THROUGH TRAFFIC DURING THE      
EVENT AND OPERATED VERY SIMILAR 
TO MAIN STREET.                 

02:09:47.478 --> 02:09:50.378
EVENT AND OPERATED VERY SIMILAR 
TO MAIN STREET.                 
I THINK THERE MIGHT HOURS AND   

02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:53.882
TO MAIN STREET.                 
I THINK THERE MIGHT HOURS AND   
MAYBE DAYS UPON DAYS WHERE THE  

02:09:53.884 --> 02:09:54.749
I THINK THERE MIGHT HOURS AND   
MAYBE DAYS UPON DAYS WHERE THE  
THAT MAIN STREET WOULD BE       

02:09:54.751 --> 02:09:55.484
MAYBE DAYS UPON DAYS WHERE THE  
THAT MAIN STREET WOULD BE       
CLOSED BUT WHEN THERE IS NO     

02:09:55.486 --> 02:09:57.920
THAT MAIN STREET WOULD BE       
CLOSED BUT WHEN THERE IS NO     
EVENT MAYBE IN THE OFF SEASON   

02:09:57.922 --> 02:09:58.787
CLOSED BUT WHEN THERE IS NO     
EVENT MAYBE IN THE OFF SEASON   
MAYBE THE STREET WOULD BE OPEN. 

02:09:58.789 --> 02:09:59.788
EVENT MAYBE IN THE OFF SEASON   
MAYBE THE STREET WOULD BE OPEN. 
SO I DON'T THINK WHEN THEY'RE   

02:09:59.790 --> 02:10:02.724
MAYBE THE STREET WOULD BE OPEN. 
SO I DON'T THINK WHEN THEY'RE   
TALKING ABOUT CORRECT ME IF I'M 

02:10:02.726 --> 02:10:03.392
SO I DON'T THINK WHEN THEY'RE   
TALKING ABOUT CORRECT ME IF I'M

02:10:03.394 --> 02:10:05.927
TALKING ABOUT CORRECT ME IF I'M 
WRONG THEY WERE PLANNING ON     
CLOSING THE STREETS TO          

02:10:05.929 --> 02:10:06.762
WRONG THEY WERE PLANNING ON     
CLOSING THE STREETS TO          
VEHICULAR USE DURING AN EVENT   

02:10:06.764 --> 02:10:09.798
CLOSING THE STREETS TO          
VEHICULAR USE DURING AN EVENT   
BUT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO    

02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:10.566
VEHICULAR USE DURING AN EVENT   
BUT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO    
KEEP IT OPEN WHEN THERE'S NO    

02:10:10.568 --> 02:10:13.502
BUT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO    
KEEP IT OPEN WHEN THERE'S NO    
EVENT.                          

02:10:13.504 --> 02:10:14.103
KEEP IT OPEN WHEN THERE'S NO    
EVENT.                          
OK, ALL RIGHT.

STRUCTURES WILL THEN BE USED AS 
A I THINK THEY CALL IT A MODE   
SHIFT OR MODE TRANSFER POINT    

02:18:23.927 --> 02:18:24.959
A I THINK THEY CALL IT A MODE   
SHIFT OR MODE TRANSFER POINT    
AND THE CITY WOULD BE LOOKING   

02:18:24.961 --> 02:18:28.063
SHIFT OR MODE TRANSFER POINT    
AND THE CITY WOULD BE LOOKING   
FOR SPECIFIC DESIGN FEATURES    

02:18:28.065 --> 02:18:28.930
AND THE CITY WOULD BE LOOKING   
FOR SPECIFIC DESIGN FEATURES    
THAT FACILITATE THIS TRANSFER.  

02:18:28.932 --> 02:18:32.067
FOR SPECIFIC DESIGN FEATURES    
THAT FACILITATE THIS TRANSFER.  
WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT IF    

02:18:32.069 --> 02:18:33.001
THAT FACILITATE THIS TRANSFER.  
WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT IF    
THESE ARE PARKING RIDES OR THIS 

02:18:33.003 --> 02:18:33.802
WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT IF    
THESE ARE PARKING RIDES OR THIS 
IS WHERE YOU SHIFT MODES, THEN  

02:18:33.804 --> 02:18:36.972
THESE ARE PARKING RIDES OR THIS 
IS WHERE YOU SHIFT MODES, THEN  
HOW DO YOU GET EITHER FROM THE  

02:18:36.974 --> 02:18:40.141
IS WHERE YOU SHIFT MODES, THEN  
HOW DO YOU GET EITHER FROM THE  
SITE OFF OR HOW DO YOU COME OFF 

02:18:40.143 --> 02:18:41.175
HOW DO YOU GET EITHER FROM THE  
SITE OFF OR HOW DO YOU COME OFF 
A SITE ON AND THESE I'M NOT     

02:18:41.177 --> 02:18:41.843
SITE OFF OR HOW DO YOU COME OFF 
A SITE ON AND THESE I'M NOT     
SURE IF WE HAVE THE FINAL       

02:18:41.845 --> 02:18:44.513
A SITE ON AND THESE I'M NOT     
SURE IF WE HAVE THE FINAL       
ANSWERS BUT WE THIS WE ARE AT   

02:18:44.515 --> 02:18:45.280
SURE IF WE HAVE THE FINAL       
ANSWERS BUT WE THIS WE ARE AT   
THE DESIGN LEVEL AND WE ARE     

02:18:45.282 --> 02:18:46.147
ANSWERS BUT WE THIS WE ARE AT   
THE DESIGN LEVEL AND WE ARE     
CREATING THE WISH LIST AND THEN 

02:18:46.149 --> 02:18:49.050
THE DESIGN LEVEL AND WE ARE     
CREATING THE WISH LIST AND THEN 
EXECUTING AS WE SPEAK AS PART

INTERESTED FOR YOU THE LATEST   
DEVELOPMENTS TO CHECK.          
SO THEN IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE  

02:19:00.497 --> 02:19:03.632
DEVELOPMENTS TO CHECK.          
SO THEN IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE  
BUS TO GO INTO ONE OF THE       

02:19:03.634 --> 02:19:07.102
SO THEN IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE  
BUS TO GO INTO ONE OF THE       
STRUCTURES SO MUCH PEOPLE AS

HOWEVER, THEY MIGHT GO DIRECTLY 
TO THE FRONT DOOR.              
OK, NOW SO THAT THAT'S THE      

02:19:23.253 --> 02:19:26.521
TO THE FRONT DOOR.              
OK, NOW SO THAT THAT'S THE      
DIRECTION OF MY QUESTION IS HOW 

02:19:26.523 --> 02:19:27.555
OK, NOW SO THAT THAT'S THE      
DIRECTION OF MY QUESTION IS HOW 
ARE YOU GOING TO GET PEOPLE OFF 

02:19:27.557 --> 02:19:28.223
DIRECTION OF MY QUESTION IS HOW 
ARE YOU GOING TO GET PEOPLE OFF 
OF THE BUS FROM THE WEST SIDE

IT'S EASY TO GET VEHICLES IN    
AND OUT.                        
BUT WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT IT   

02:19:58.088 --> 02:19:58.887
AND OUT.                        
BUT WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT IT   
FROM THE MULTIMODAL STANDPOINT  

02:19:58.889 --> 02:20:01.523
BUT WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT IT   
FROM THE MULTIMODAL STANDPOINT  
AND I THINK THIS DIAGRAM IS A   

02:20:01.525 --> 02:20:02.390
FROM THE MULTIMODAL STANDPOINT

THE C BLOCK, THE ONE FURTHEST   
TO THE EAST OF THAT'S ACTUALLY  
OPEN LOT RIGHT NOW.             

02:27:34.511 --> 02:27:37.745
TO THE EAST OF THAT'S ACTUALLY  
OPEN LOT RIGHT NOW.             
RIGHT NEXT TO IT IS THE

TO THE EAST THAT STRUCTURE      
MAYBE IT TURNS OUT WE DON'T     

02:27:55.932 --> 02:27:56.664
TO THE EAST THAT STRUCTURE      
MAYBE IT TURNS OUT WE DON'T     
NEED AS MUCH PARKING SO WE      

02:27:56.666 --> 02:27:58.900
MAYBE IT TURNS OUT WE DON'T     
NEED AS MUCH PARKING SO WE      
DON'T BUILD MANY FLOORS.        

02:27:58.902 --> 02:28:00.101
NEED AS MUCH PARKING SO WE      
DON'T BUILD MANY FLOORS.        
HARD TO SAY IT MAY BE THAT      

02:28:00.103 --> 02:28:00.902
DON'T BUILD MANY FLOORS.

IT'S GREAT BUT I'VE BEEN        
THINKING ABOUT THE REAL         

03:12:33.374 --> 03:12:34.873
IT'S GREAT BUT I'VE BEEN        
THINKING ABOUT THE REAL         
IMPORTANCE OF HOLISTIC PLANNING 

03:12:34.875 --> 03:12:35.874
THINKING ABOUT THE REAL         
IMPORTANCE OF HOLISTIC PLANNING 
THAT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IS A  

03:12:35.876 --> 03:12:39.177
IMPORTANCE OF HOLISTIC PLANNING 
THAT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IS A  
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT.         

03:12:39.179 --> 03:12:40.078
THAT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IS A  
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT.         
SO YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 

03:12:40.080 --> 03:12:40.812
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT.         
SO YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
HOW DIFFERENT PIECES OF A       

03:12:40.814 --> 03:12:43.615
SO YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
HOW DIFFERENT PIECES OF A       
PUZZLE FIT TOGETHER AND IT IS   

03:12:43.617 --> 03:12:46.918
HOW DIFFERENT PIECES OF A       
PUZZLE FIT TOGETHER AND IT IS   
REALLY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE   

03:12:46.920 --> 03:12:47.919
PUZZLE FIT TOGETHER AND IT IS   
REALLY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE   
THAT I LOVE THE PHRASE THAT     

03:12:47.921 --> 03:12:51.155
REALLY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE   
THAT I LOVE THE PHRASE THAT     
PLAN IS NOT A CURE.             

03:12:51.157 --> 03:12:51.990
THAT I LOVE THE PHRASE THAT     
PLAN IS NOT A CURE.             
THERE'S NO CURE ALL FOR         

03:12:51.992 --> 03:12:52.524
PLAN IS NOT A CURE.             
THERE'S NO CURE ALL FOR         
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.             

03:12:52.526 --> 03:12:55.493
THERE'S NO CURE ALL FOR         
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.             
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT        

03:12:55.495 --> 03:12:56.161
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.             
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT        
APPROACHES THAT A CITY HAS TO   

03:12:56.163 --> 03:12:59.797
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT        
APPROACHES THAT A CITY HAS TO   
TAKE ALL OF THEM AND AND WE YOU 

03:12:59.799 --> 03:13:02.834
APPROACHES THAT A CITY HAS TO   
TAKE ALL OF THEM AND AND WE YOU 
WE UNUSUALLY ARE TAKING A LOT   

03:13:02.836 --> 03:13:03.602
TAKE ALL OF THEM AND AND WE YOU 
WE UNUSUALLY ARE TAKING A LOT   
OF THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE TO      

03:13:03.604 --> 03:13:06.437
WE UNUSUALLY ARE TAKING A LOT   
OF THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE TO      
MILEAGES NOT EVERYBODY GETS     

03:13:06.439 --> 03:13:07.206
OF THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE TO      
MILEAGES NOT EVERYBODY GETS     
THEIR RESIDENTS TO GIVE THEM TO 

03:13:07.208 --> 03:13:10.708
MILEAGES NOT EVERYBODY GETS     
THEIR RESIDENTS TO GIVE THEM TO 
VILLAGES AND SO I BELIEVE THAT  

03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:11.476
THEIR RESIDENTS TO GIVE THEM TO 
VILLAGES AND SO I BELIEVE THAT  
IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT   

03:13:11.478 --> 03:13:14.112
VILLAGES AND SO I BELIEVE THAT  
IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT   
THE IMPORTANCE OF HOLISTIC      

03:13:14.114 --> 03:13:14.713
IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT   
THE IMPORTANCE OF HOLISTIC      
PLANNING VERSUS PIECEMEAL       

03:13:14.715 --> 03:13:18.116
THE IMPORTANCE OF HOLISTIC      
PLANNING VERSUS PIECEMEAL       
REACTIVE.                       

03:13:18.118 --> 03:13:19.184
PLANNING VERSUS PIECEMEAL       
REACTIVE.                       
THIS IS NOT THE LANGUAGE THAT I 

03:13:19.186 --> 03:13:19.985
REACTIVE.                       
THIS IS NOT THE LANGUAGE THAT I 
WOULD USE BUT VERSUS PIECEMEAL  

03:13:19.987 --> 03:13:24.522
THIS IS NOT THE LANGUAGE THAT I 
WOULD USE BUT VERSUS PIECEMEAL  
REACTIVE ADOPTION OF THINGS     

03:13:24.524 --> 03:13:25.290
WOULD USE BUT VERSUS PIECEMEAL  
REACTIVE ADOPTION OF THINGS     
THAT DEVELOPERS BRING FORWARD   

03:13:25.292 --> 03:13:29.027
REACTIVE ADOPTION OF THINGS     
THAT DEVELOPERS BRING FORWARD   
THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO PLAN.    

03:13:29.029 --> 03:13:32.764
THAT DEVELOPERS BRING FORWARD   
THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO PLAN.    
AND SO WHY WE PLAN IS BECAUSE   

03:13:32.766 --> 03:13:36.467
THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO PLAN.    
AND SO WHY WE PLAN IS BECAUSE   
IT'S HOLISTIC AND IT'S PIECES   

03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:37.302
AND SO WHY WE PLAN IS BECAUSE   
IT'S HOLISTIC AND IT'S PIECES   
OF A SYSTEM AND IT'S LOOKING AT 

03:13:37.304 --> 03:13:39.271
IT'S HOLISTIC AND IT'S PIECES   
OF A SYSTEM AND IT'S LOOKING AT 
THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH ONE   

03:13:39.273 --> 03:13:39.938
OF A SYSTEM AND IT'S LOOKING AT 
THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH ONE   
APPROACHES A PROBLEM.           

03:13:39.940 --> 03:13:43.508
THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH ONE   
APPROACHES A PROBLEM.           
YOU KNOW.                       

03:13:43.510 --> 03:13:44.643
APPROACHES A PROBLEM.           
YOU KNOW.                       
>> SO AND IN TERMS OF I REALLY  

03:13:44.645 --> 03:13:47.045
YOU KNOW.                       
>> SO AND IN TERMS OF I REALLY  
WANT TO STRONGLY SUPPORT WHAT   

03:13:47.047 --> 03:13:47.913
>> SO AND IN TERMS OF I REALLY  
WANT TO STRONGLY SUPPORT WHAT   
COMMISSIONER I WAS SAYING, I    

03:13:47.915 --> 03:13:51.049
WANT TO STRONGLY SUPPORT WHAT   
COMMISSIONER I WAS SAYING, I    
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE

DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE    
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REPORT     
SHOULD FIT.                     

03:13:52.119 --> 03:13:55.119
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REPORT     
SHOULD FIT.                     
I THINK IF PASSED PLANS WANT TO 

03:13:55.121 --> 03:13:55.887
SHOULD FIT.                     
I THINK IF PASSED PLANS WANT TO 
GO ON ANOTHER PAGE BECAUSE THEY 

03:13:55.889 --> 03:13:58.423
I THINK IF PASSED PLANS WANT TO 
GO ON ANOTHER PAGE BECAUSE THEY 
ARE PLANS THE ECONOMIC          

03:13:58.425 --> 03:13:59.223
GO ON ANOTHER PAGE BECAUSE THEY 
ARE PLANS THE ECONOMIC          
DEVELOPMENT REPORT WASN'T BUT

DEVELOPMENT REPORT WASN'T BUT   
IT KIND OF HAS A SIMILAR STATUS 
TO A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR TO THE

IT KIND OF HAS A SIMILAR STATUS 
TO A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR TO THE  
ANN ARBOR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN    

03:14:07.134 --> 03:14:07.865
TO A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR TO THE

03:16:12.960 --> 03:16:13.891
LITTLE BIT THERE RATHER THAN    
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT AND THEN

GO ON PAGES.                    

03:16:22.569 --> 03:16:25.136
PLANNING IT WOULDN'T IT WOULD   
GO ON PAGES.                    
IT WOULD START ARE WE PLANNING  

03:16:25.138 --> 03:16:25.804
GO ON PAGES.                    
IT WOULD START ARE WE PLANNING  
TO SUPPORT DELIBERATIVE         

03:16:25.806 --> 03:16:28.973
IT WOULD START ARE WE PLANNING  
TO SUPPORT DELIBERATIVE         
DECISION MAKING AND BECAUSE WE  

03:16:28.975 --> 03:16:29.740
TO SUPPORT DELIBERATIVE         
DECISION MAKING AND BECAUSE WE  
HAVE TO UNDER STATE LAW AND     

03:16:29.742 --> 03:16:30.541
DECISION MAKING AND BECAUSE WE  
HAVE TO UNDER STATE LAW AND     
THERE'S NO REASON TO HIDE THAT  

03:16:30.543 --> 03:16:32.543
HAVE TO UNDER STATE LAW AND     
THERE'S NO REASON TO HIDE THAT  
AND WE DO AND TO EXPLAIN A      

03:16:32.545 --> 03:16:33.245
THERE'S NO REASON TO HIDE THAT  
AND WE DO AND TO EXPLAIN A      
LITTLE BIT THE INSTITUTIONAL    

03:16:33.247 --> 03:16:36.248
AND WE DO AND TO EXPLAIN A      
LITTLE BIT THE INSTITUTIONAL    
ROLE THAT THE NPA IS SET UP     

03:16:36.250 --> 03:16:37.048
LITTLE BIT THE INSTITUTIONAL    
ROLE THAT THE NPA IS SET UP     
DOESN'T NEED TO BE DETAILED.    

03:16:37.050 --> 03:16:40.585
ROLE THAT THE NPA IS SET UP     
DOESN'T NEED TO BE DETAILED.    
I THINK IF YOU DO THAT FIRST    

03:16:40.587 --> 03:16:44.122
DOESN'T NEED TO BE DETAILED.    
I THINK IF YOU DO THAT FIRST    
THEN THAT LEADS INTO WHAT IS    

03:16:44.124 --> 03:16:44.956
I THINK IF YOU DO THAT FIRST    
THEN THAT LEADS INTO WHAT IS    
THE PLAN THAT GETS PRODUCED AND 

03:16:44.958 --> 03:16:45.490
THEN THAT LEADS INTO WHAT IS    
THE PLAN THAT GETS PRODUCED AND 
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?            

03:16:45.492 --> 03:16:47.458

IT PALES IN COMPARISON.         
THE HOCKEY STICK GRAPH THAT WE  
SAW THROUGH THE POST-WORLD WAR

TWO HOUSING BOOM VERSUS LESS    
EXACTLY.                        
SO THIS IS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION 

03:39:03.662 --> 03:39:04.327
EXACTLY.

THAT CAN BE A WAY TO ANSWER     

03:39:59.918 --> 03:40:00.750
GROWING BEHIND IT.              
THAT CAN BE A WAY TO ANSWER     
THAT AND THEY ALREADY HAVE A

YEAH.                           
THIS WAS THE ONLY DIAGRAM THAT  
I THOUGHT I COULD USE SOME WORK 

04:12:16.219 --> 04:12:16.984
THIS WAS THE ONLY DIAGRAM THAT  
I THOUGHT I COULD USE SOME WORK 
AS I WAS MOVING THROUGH I WAS   

04:12:16.986 --> 04:12:19.354
I THOUGHT I COULD USE SOME WORK 
AS I WAS MOVING THROUGH I WAS   
LIKE OH YES.

AS I WAS MOVING THROUGH I WAS   
LIKE OH YES.                    
>> IT WAS LIKE I'VE HEARD FROM  

04:12:20.590 --> 04:12:23.759
LIKE OH YES.                    
>> IT WAS LIKE I'VE HEARD FROM  
PEOPLE AT THE CITY OF YOU KNOW  

04:12:23.761 --> 04:12:27.195
>> IT WAS LIKE I'VE HEARD FROM  
PEOPLE AT THE CITY OF YOU KNOW  
LIKE AN APARTMENT AND OTHERS

PEOPLE AT THE CITY OF YOU KNOW  
LIKE AN APARTMENT AND OTHERS    
THAT AN APARTMENT BUILDING DOES 

04:12:28.065 --> 04:12:31.499
LIKE AN APARTMENT AND OTHERS    
THAT AN APARTMENT BUILDING DOES 
NOT USE MORE RESOURCES BUT A

THAT AN APARTMENT BUILDING DOES 
NOT USE MORE RESOURCES BUT A    
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD

NOT USE MORE RESOURCES BUT A    
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD      
ACTUALLY USES MORE RESOURCES    

04:12:32.803 --> 04:12:34.736
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD      
ACTUALLY USES MORE RESOURCES    
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE PAVING     

04:12:34.738 --> 04:12:39.174
ACTUALLY USES MORE RESOURCES    
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE PAVING     
MORE LINES OF UTILITIES MORE    

04:12:39.176 --> 04:12:40.374
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE PAVING     
MORE LINES OF UTILITIES MORE    
AND SO LIKE WHAT IS HOUSING     

04:12:40.376 --> 04:12:44.145
MORE LINES OF UTILITIES MORE    
AND SO LIKE WHAT IS HOUSING     
AGAIN TO GET TO THAT POINT IS   

04:12:44.147 --> 04:12:46.448
AND SO LIKE WHAT IS HOUSING     
AGAIN TO GET TO THAT POINT IS   
HOUSING SINGLE FAMILY HOUSES OR

AGAIN TO GET TO THAT POINT IS   
HOUSING SINGLE FAMILY HOUSES OR 
IS HOUSING AN APARTMENT

HISTORICALLY THAT THERE WERE

FROM THE THIRD PARAGRAPH ON     
PAGE TWENTY THAT START RIGHT    

04:13:29.560 --> 04:13:33.228
FROM THE THIRD PARAGRAPH ON     
PAGE TWENTY THAT START RIGHT    
AROUND NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN IS  

04:13:33.230 --> 04:13:35.863
PAGE TWENTY THAT START RIGHT    
AROUND NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN IS  
OUR ZONING ORDINANCE CODIFIES A 

04:13:35.865 --> 04:13:36.531
AROUND NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN IS  
OUR ZONING ORDINANCE CODIFIES A 
SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND THEY   

04:13:36.533 --> 04:13:39.868
OUR ZONING ORDINANCE CODIFIES A

04:13:39.870 --> 04:13:44.039
SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND THEY   
CHANGE THE MINIMUM SIZES.       
SO THE ADL HAS A WHOLE ARTICLE  

04:13:44.041 --> 04:13:44.773
CHANGE THE MINIMUM SIZES.       
SO THE ADL HAS A WHOLE ARTICLE  
BUT IT'S NOT TILL NINETEEN      

04:13:44.775 --> 04:13:48.042
SO THE ADL HAS A WHOLE ARTICLE

04:18:22.085 --> 04:18:22.884
SOME RESEARCH TO SEE IF THE     
CITY UTILIZED RIGHT REDLINING   
MAPS BUT THE CITY WASN'T A      

04:18:22.886 --> 04:18:23.685
CITY UTILIZED RIGHT REDLINING   
MAPS BUT THE CITY WASN'T A      
LARGE ENOUGH MUNICIPALITY FOR   

04:18:23.687 --> 04:18:24.418
MAPS BUT THE CITY WASN'T A      
LARGE ENOUGH MUNICIPALITY FOR   
THE GOVERNMENT TO CREATE THOSE  

04:18:24.420 --> 04:18:24.752
LARGE ENOUGH MUNICIPALITY FOR   
THE GOVERNMENT TO CREATE THOSE  
MAPS.                           

04:18:24.754 --> 04:18:25.552
THE GOVERNMENT TO CREATE THOSE  
MAPS.                           
BUT THE INSURANCE MAPS TELL A   

04:18:25.554 --> 04:18:26.187
MAPS.                           
BUT THE INSURANCE MAPS TELL A   
DIFFERENT STORY BECAUSE THEY    

04:18:26.189 --> 04:18:26.854
BUT THE INSURANCE MAPS TELL A   
DIFFERENT STORY BECAUSE THEY    
WERE NOT ABLE TO GET INSURANCE  

04:18:26.856 --> 04:18:27.655
DIFFERENT STORY BECAUSE THEY    
WERE NOT ABLE TO GET INSURANCE  
FOR THE HOUSE WHICH MEANT THEY  

04:18:27.657 --> 04:18:28.389
WERE NOT ABLE TO GET INSURANCE  
FOR THE HOUSE WHICH MEANT THEY  
WEREN'T ABLE TO GET A MORTGAGE  

04:18:28.391 --> 04:18:29.057
FOR THE HOUSE WHICH MEANT THEY  
WEREN'T ABLE TO GET A MORTGAGE  
FOR THE HOUSE WHICH MEANT THEY  

04:18:29.059 --> 04:18:29.990
WEREN'T ABLE TO GET A MORTGAGE  
FOR THE HOUSE WHICH MEANT THEY  
WEREN'T ABLE TO PURCHASE THE    

04:18:29.992 --> 04:18:30.325
FOR THE HOUSE WHICH MEANT THEY  
WEREN'T ABLE TO PURCHASE THE    
HOUSE.                          

04:18:30.327 --> 04:18:31.125
WEREN'T ABLE TO PURCHASE THE    
HOUSE.                          
SO WHILE THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE  

04:18:31.127 --> 04:18:33.928
HOUSE.                          
SO WHILE THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE  
A HISTORY OF REDLINING THAT     

04:18:33.930 --> 04:18:37.565
SO WHILE THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE  
A HISTORY OF REDLINING THAT     
OTHER MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS  

04:18:37.567 --> 04:18:38.500
A HISTORY OF REDLINING THAT     
OTHER MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS  
DO, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY   

04:18:38.502 --> 04:18:41.569
OTHER MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS  
DO, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY   
DIDN'T HAVE SYSTEMS             

04:18:41.571 --> 04:18:42.237
DO, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY   
DIDN'T HAVE SYSTEMS             
OF EXCLUSION THAT PREVENTED     

04:18:42.239 --> 04:18:45.940
DIDN'T HAVE SYSTEMS             
OF EXCLUSION THAT PREVENTED     
BLACKS FROM OBTAINING WHAT      

04:18:45.942 --> 04:18:49.610
OF EXCLUSION THAT PREVENTED     
BLACKS FROM OBTAINING WHAT      
COMMISSIONER MARTIN HAS BEEN    

04:18:49.612 --> 04:18:50.344
BLACKS FROM OBTAINING WHAT      
COMMISSIONER MARTIN HAS BEEN    
TALKING ABOUT SINGLE FAMILY     

04:18:50.346 --> 04:18:52.747
COMMISSIONER MARTIN HAS BEEN    
TALKING ABOUT SINGLE FAMILY     
HOMES TO SORT OF PARTICIPATE IN 

04:18:52.749 --> 04:18:56.483
TALKING ABOUT SINGLE FAMILY     
HOMES TO SORT OF PARTICIPATE IN 
THOSE ESSENTIAL BENEFICIAL      

04:18:56.485 --> 04:19:00.521
HOMES TO SORT OF PARTICIPATE IN 
THOSE ESSENTIAL BENEFICIAL      
ASPECTS OF THEIR THEIR LIFE AND 

04:19:00.523 --> 04:19:01.523
THOSE ESSENTIAL BENEFICIAL      
ASPECTS OF THEIR THEIR LIFE AND 
SO THAT HAS HAD AN IMPACT BOTH  

04:19:01.525 --> 04:19:04.758
ASPECTS OF THEIR THEIR LIFE AND 
SO THAT HAS HAD AN IMPACT BOTH  
ON THE POPULATION BUT IT'S ALSO 

04:19:04.760 --> 04:19:05.560
SO THAT HAS HAD AN IMPACT BOTH  
ON THE POPULATION BUT IT'S ALSO 
HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE 

04:19:05.562 --> 04:19:08.829
ON THE POPULATION BUT IT'S ALSO 
HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE 
BLACK POPULATION WITHIN THE     

04:19:08.831 --> 04:19:09.897
HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE 
BLACK POPULATION WITHIN THE     
CITY AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE  

04:19:09.899 --> 04:19:12.900
BLACK POPULATION WITHIN THE     
CITY AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE  
DATA IT LIKE FROM NINETEEN      

04:19:12.902 --> 04:19:15.737
CITY AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE  
DATA IT LIKE FROM NINETEEN      
FIFTY SEVEN TILL IT FLATLINES.  

04:19:15.739 --> 04:19:16.604
DATA IT LIKE FROM NINETEEN      
FIFTY SEVEN TILL IT FLATLINES.  
SOMETHING IS CONSTRAINING BUT   

04:19:16.606 --> 04:19:20.074
FIFTY SEVEN TILL IT FLATLINES.  
SOMETHING IS CONSTRAINING BUT   
THE CITY IS STILL GROWING AND   

04:19:20.076 --> 04:19:20.675
SOMETHING IS CONSTRAINING BUT   
THE CITY IS STILL GROWING AND   
THE COUNTY IS GROWING.          

04:19:20.677 --> 04:19:21.876
THE CITY IS STILL GROWING AND   
THE COUNTY IS GROWING.          
>> SO YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS     

04:19:21.878 --> 04:19:25.746
THE COUNTY IS GROWING.          
>> SO YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS     
HAPPENING.                      

04:19:25.748 --> 04:19:26.914
>> SO YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS     
HAPPENING.                      
>> OK, ANY OTHER COMMENTS JUST  

04:19:26.916 --> 04:19:29.717
HAPPENING.                      
>> OK, ANY OTHER COMMENTS JUST  
TO TERMINOLOGICAL POINTS I      

04:19:29.719 --> 04:19:30.517
>> OK, ANY OTHER COMMENTS JUST  
TO TERMINOLOGICAL POINTS I      
THINK IF WE MEAN DETACHED       

04:19:30.519 --> 04:19:34.121
TO TERMINOLOGICAL POINTS I      
THINK IF WE MEAN DETACHED       
SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING WE MIGHT  

04:19:34.123 --> 04:19:34.756
THINK IF WE MEAN DETACHED       
SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING WE MIGHT  
WANT TO SPECIFY THAT BECAUSE    

04:19:34.758 --> 04:19:38.226
SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING WE MIGHT  
WANT TO SPECIFY THAT BECAUSE    
THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF SINGLE 

04:19:38.228 --> 04:19:38.893
WANT TO SPECIFY THAT BECAUSE    
THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF SINGLE 
FAMILY HOUSING THAT ARE NOT     

04:19:38.895 --> 04:19:42.096
THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF SINGLE 
FAMILY HOUSING THAT ARE NOT     
DETACHED AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE 

04:19:42.098 --> 04:19:44.732
FAMILY HOUSING THAT ARE NOT     
DETACHED AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE 
ZONING CHANGES TO MOST OF OUR   

04:19:44.734 --> 04:19:45.400
DETACHED AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE 
ZONING CHANGES TO MOST OF OUR   
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS IN ORDER  

04:19:45.402 --> 04:19:45.933
ZONING CHANGES TO MOST OF OUR   
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS IN ORDER  
TO ENABLE THEM.                 

04:19:45.935 --> 04:19:49.270
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS IN ORDER  
TO ENABLE THEM.                 
AND SO I THINK THE MODEL THAT   

04:19:49.272 --> 04:19:50.070
TO ENABLE THEM.                 
AND SO I THINK THE MODEL THAT   
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT GETS   

04:19:50.072 --> 04:19:54.108
AND SO I THINK THE MODEL THAT   
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT GETS   
WRITTEN IN STONE IS THAT IT'S   

04:19:54.110 --> 04:19:55.109
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT GETS   
WRITTEN IN STONE IS THAT IT'S   
ONE THING PER PARCEL AND IT'S A 

04:19:55.111 --> 04:19:57.144
WRITTEN IN STONE IS THAT IT'S   
ONE THING PER PARCEL AND IT'S A 
DETACHED THING.                 

04:19:57.146 --> 04:19:58.046
ONE THING PER PARCEL AND IT'S A 
DETACHED THING.                 
>> SO AND THEN THE OTHER THING  

04:19:58.048 --> 04:19:58.913
DETACHED THING.                 
>> SO AND THEN THE OTHER THING  
IS I DON'T HONESTLY KNOW WHAT   

04:19:58.915 --> 04:20:01.316
>> SO AND THEN THE OTHER THING  
IS I DON'T HONESTLY KNOW WHAT   
CONCENTRATED CODE ENFORCEMENT   

04:20:01.318 --> 04:20:05.486
IS I DON'T HONESTLY KNOW WHAT   
CONCENTRATED CODE ENFORCEMENT   
IS A IT'S IN THE SECOND KEY     

04:20:05.488 --> 04:20:06.220
CONCENTRATED CODE ENFORCEMENT   
IS A IT'S IN THE SECOND KEY     
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE     

04:20:06.222 --> 04:20:09.223

CONCENTRATED CODE ENFORCEMENT

04:20:17.533 --> 04:20:18.265
CONCENTRATED CODE ENFORCEMENT   
IN THE 1960S AND LIKE THAT PART 
OF THAT WAS THE URBAN RENEWAL

THOSE ARE ACTUALLY FEDERALLY

BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BEING       
POLICED THE POLICE ARE THERE SO 

04:20:44.460 --> 04:20:45.125
BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BEING

THIS BUILDING MORE SUPPORT      
HOUSING SUPPORTS AFFORDABILITY  

05:08:48.475 --> 05:08:49.340
THIS BUILDING MORE SUPPORT      
HOUSING SUPPORTS AFFORDABILITY  
BY EASING PRESSURE ON SUPPLY    

05:08:49.342 --> 05:08:52.577
HOUSING SUPPORTS AFFORDABILITY  
BY EASING PRESSURE ON SUPPLY    
PROVIDING A RANGE OF VALUE

BY EASING PRESSURE ON SUPPLY

WOULD LIKE US TO CONSIDER AT    

05:09:19.239 --> 05:09:22.773
AND I MEAN THE OTHER POINT I    
WOULD LIKE US TO CONSIDER AT    
SOME POINT IS AS I'VE HEARD     

05:09:22.775 --> 05:09:23.775
WOULD LIKE US TO CONSIDER AT    
SOME POINT IS AS I'VE HEARD     
FEEDBACK FROM THE TABLE, A LOT  

05:09:23.777 --> 05:09:27.078
SOME POINT IS AS I'VE HEARD     
FEEDBACK FROM THE TABLE, A LOT  
OF CRITICISM AROUND THAT CITY   

05:09:27.080 --> 05:09:30.749
FEEDBACK FROM THE TABLE, A LOT  
OF CRITICISM AROUND THAT CITY   
IS NOT GOING TO LEAD TO         

05:09:30.751 --> 05:09:31.216
OF CRITICISM AROUND THAT CITY   
IS NOT GOING TO LEAD TO         
AFFORDABILITY.                  

05:09:31.218 --> 05:09:34.552
IS NOT GOING TO LEAD TO         
AFFORDABILITY.                  
THEREFORE NOTHING SHOULD HAPPEN 

05:09:34.554 --> 05:09:34.753
AFFORDABILITY.                  
THEREFORE NOTHING SHOULD HAPPEN 
.                               

05:09:34.755 --> 05:09:35.820
THEREFORE NOTHING SHOULD HAPPEN 
.                               
I THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEMATIC 

05:09:35.822 --> 05:09:39.690
.                               
I THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEMATIC 
PART FOR ME, WHICH IS NO ONE    

05:09:39.692 --> 05:09:42.326
I THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEMATIC 
PART FOR ME, WHICH IS NO ONE    
REGULATOR WHO IS OBJECTING IS   

05:09:42.328 --> 05:09:45.796
PART FOR ME, WHICH IS NO ONE    
REGULATOR WHO IS OBJECTING IS   
COUNTING THE COST OF WHAT       

05:09:45.798 --> 05:09:46.731
REGULATOR WHO IS OBJECTING IS   
COUNTING THE COST OF WHAT       
HAPPENS IF WE DO NOTHING AND    

05:09:46.733 --> 05:09:52.904
COUNTING THE COST OF WHAT       
HAPPENS IF WE DO NOTHING AND    
WE'VE TAKEN                     

05:10:06.786 --> 05:10:09.754
            A FORWARD MOVING    
POSTURE TO DO SOMETHING AND WE  
RECOGNIZE THAT THE THINGS THAT  

05:10:09.756 --> 05:10:10.688
POSTURE TO DO SOMETHING AND WE  
RECOGNIZE THAT THE THINGS THAT  
YOU PLAN TO DO WILL NOT ACHIEVE 

05:10:10.690 --> 05:10:11.423
RECOGNIZE THAT THE THINGS THAT  
YOU PLAN TO DO WILL NOT ACHIEVE 
EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT BUT     

05:10:11.425 --> 05:10:12.023
YOU PLAN TO DO WILL NOT ACHIEVE 
EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT BUT     
THEY WILL MOVE US IN THAT       

05:10:12.025 --> 05:10:12.490
EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT BUT     
THEY WILL MOVE US IN THAT       
DIRECTION.                      

05:10:12.492 --> 05:10:13.357
THEY WILL MOVE US IN THAT       
DIRECTION.                      
>> OK, SO HOW DO THAT FORWARD?  

05:10:13.359 --> 05:10:14.092
DIRECTION.                      
>> OK, SO HOW DO THAT FORWARD?  
THERE'S ALSO EMPIRICAL RESEARCH 

05:10:14.094 --> 05:10:14.759
>> OK, SO HOW DO THAT FORWARD?  
THERE'S ALSO EMPIRICAL RESEARCH 
THAT SAYS THAT IF YOU DO        

05:10:14.761 --> 05:10:15.426
THERE'S ALSO EMPIRICAL RESEARCH 
THAT SAYS THAT IF YOU DO        
NOTHING IT WILL GET MORE        

05:10:15.428 --> 05:10:15.760
THAT SAYS THAT IF YOU DO        
NOTHING IT WILL GET MORE        
EXPENSIVE.                      

05:10:15.762 --> 05:10:16.560
NOTHING IT WILL GET MORE        
EXPENSIVE.                      
SO THE FACT THAT IT MAY BE A    

05:10:16.562 --> 05:10:17.095
EXPENSIVE.                      
SO THE FACT THAT IT MAY BE A    
IT'S HARD TO ESTABLISH          

05:10:17.097 --> 05:10:17.895
SO THE FACT THAT IT MAY BE A    
IT'S HARD TO ESTABLISH          
CAUSALITY SO WE WANT TO BE      

05:10:17.897 --> 05:10:18.430
IT'S HARD TO ESTABLISH          
CAUSALITY SO WE WANT TO BE      
CAREFUL ABOUT THE KIND          

05:10:18.432 --> 05:10:20.932
CAUSALITY SO WE WANT TO BE      
CAREFUL ABOUT THE KIND          
OF LANGUAGE BUT BUT IT IS       

05:10:20.934 --> 05:10:23.734
CAREFUL ABOUT THE KIND          
OF LANGUAGE BUT BUT IT IS       
STABILIZING RENT INCREASES IS   

05:10:23.736 --> 05:10:24.135
OF LANGUAGE BUT BUT IT IS       
STABILIZING RENT INCREASES IS   
AFFORDABILITY.                  

05:10:24.137 --> 05:10:25.102
STABILIZING RENT INCREASES IS   
AFFORDABILITY.                  
>> SO THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ARE    

05:10:25.104 --> 05:10:25.804
AFFORDABILITY.                  
>> SO THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ARE    
MAKING THOSE STATEMENTS ARE     

05:10:25.806 --> 05:10:28.806
>> SO THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ARE    
MAKING THOSE STATEMENTS ARE     
JUST TAKING OUT OF CONTEXT.     

05:10:28.808 --> 05:10:29.908
MAKING THOSE STATEMENTS ARE     
JUST TAKING OUT OF CONTEXT.     
SO I'M PART OF MY REASON FOR    

05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:32.844
JUST TAKING OUT OF CONTEXT.     
SO I'M PART OF MY REASON FOR    
SUGGESTING THAT THE THINGS ON   

05:10:32.846 --> 05:10:33.778
SO I'M PART OF MY REASON FOR    
SUGGESTING THAT THE THINGS ON   
THE LEFT BE IDENTIFIED AS       

05:10:33.780 --> 05:10:34.445
SUGGESTING THAT THE THINGS ON   
THE LEFT BE IDENTIFIED AS       
FACTUAL STATEMENTS THAT LENDS   

05:10:34.447 --> 05:10:37.449
THE LEFT BE IDENTIFIED AS       
FACTUAL STATEMENTS THAT LENDS   
ITSELF TO THEN CITATIONS TO THE 

05:10:37.451 --> 05:10:38.116
FACTUAL STATEMENTS THAT LENDS   
ITSELF TO THEN CITATIONS TO THE 
LITERATURE THAT CAN SUPPORT     

05:10:38.118 --> 05:10:40.218
ITSELF TO THEN CITATIONS TO THE 
LITERATURE THAT CAN SUPPORT     
THEM RIGHT.                     

05:10:40.220 --> 05:10:41.219
LITERATURE THAT CAN SUPPORT     
THEM RIGHT.                     
AND I THINK THE CONSENSUS       

05:10:41.221 --> 05:10:43.822
THEM RIGHT.                     
AND I THINK THE CONSENSUS       
OF THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE IS   

05:10:43.824 --> 05:10:44.890
AND I THINK THE CONSENSUS       
OF THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE IS   
BE THERE IS A SUPPLY AND DEMAND 

05:10:44.892 --> 05:10:45.490
OF THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE IS   
BE THERE IS A SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
THING GOING ON HERE.            

05:10:45.492 --> 05:10:48.626
BE THERE IS A SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
THING GOING ON HERE.            
BULLIMORE HOUSING IF IT DOESN'T 

05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:49.361
THING GOING ON HERE.            
BULLIMORE HOUSING IF IT DOESN'T 
MAKE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY GO   

05:10:49.363 --> 05:10:52.096
BULLIMORE HOUSING IF IT DOESN'T 
MAKE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY GO   
DOWN AT LEAST TEMPERS THE RISE  

05:10:52.098 --> 05:10:52.330
MAKE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY GO   
DOWN AT LEAST TEMPERS THE RISE  
.                               

05:10:52.332 --> 05:10:52.797
DOWN AT LEAST TEMPERS THE RISE  
.                               
YEAH, RIGHT.                    

05:10:52.799 --> 05:10:54.065

YEAH, RIGHT.                    
SO I THINK YOU CAN MOVE THESE   

05:10:54.067 --> 05:10:56.267
YEAH, RIGHT.                    
SO I THINK YOU CAN MOVE THESE   
KIND OF KEY FACTUAL ASSERTIONS  

05:10:56.269 --> 05:10:56.935
SO I THINK YOU CAN MOVE THESE   
KIND OF KEY FACTUAL ASSERTIONS
