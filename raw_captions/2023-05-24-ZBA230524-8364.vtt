00:20:07.733 --> 00:20:10.667
YOU CAN APPLY TO MEN TO THE     
PARTY.                          
THAT IS A VERY BIG STEP FOR FOR 

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:11.602

00:20:14.073 --> 00:20:15.072
FOR SIGNS BUT BUT THE           
POSSIBILITY EXISTS RIGHT.       
AND SO I THINK THAT FOR ME      

00:20:15.074 --> 00:20:15.806
POSSIBILITY EXISTS RIGHT.       
AND SO I THINK THAT FOR ME      
THERE&apos;S DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER WE 

00:20:15.808 --> 00:20:18.608
AND SO I THINK THAT FOR ME      
THERE&apos;S DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER WE 
ARE EVEN THE RIGHT VENUE AND    

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.345
THERE&apos;S DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER WE 
ARE EVEN THE RIGHT VENUE AND    
THE REASON IS WHEN WHEN THE     

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:22.913

THE REASON IS WHEN WHEN THE     
SIGNS WERE BUILT.               

00:20:22.915 --> 00:20:23.114
THE REASON IS WHEN WHEN THE     
SIGNS WERE BUILT.               
RIGHT.                          

00:20:23.116 --> 00:20:26.049
SIGNS WERE BUILT.               
RIGHT.                          
THEY THEY WERE BUILT TO         

00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:26.717
RIGHT.                          
THEY THEY WERE BUILT TO         
STANDARDS THAT WERE PUT IN

THE TYPES OF SIGNS HOW BIG WE   
WANT THEM TO BE AND THEN WE     

00:20:30.422 --> 00:20:33.157

WANT THEM TO BE AND THEN WE     
DECIDE I MEAN NOT US BUT AS A

00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:37.194
DECIDE I MEAN NOT US BUT AS A   
CITY WE DECIDED WE WANT SIGNS   
THAT ARE SMALLER AND SO THOSE   

00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:37.862
CITY WE DECIDED WE WANT SIGNS   
THAT ARE SMALLER AND SO THOSE   
WHO BUILT BIGGER SIGNS IN THE   

00:20:37.864 --> 00:20:41.498
THAT ARE SMALLER AND SO THOSE   
WHO BUILT BIGGER SIGNS IN THE   
PAST CAN KEEP THEIRS FOR AS     

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.066
WHO BUILT BIGGER SIGNS IN THE   
PAST CAN KEEP THEIRS FOR AS     
LONG AS THEY WANT.              

00:20:42.068 --> 00:20:42.933
PAST CAN KEEP THEIRS FOR AS     
LONG AS THEY WANT.              
BUT ONCE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE   

00:20:42.935 --> 00:20:45.469
LONG AS THEY WANT.              
BUT ONCE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE   
IT, YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE

EXISTING SIGN AND SO THEY HAVE  
THE ABILITY TO KEEP THE SITE IN

IMPORTANT PART.                 
THE HARD IS THE THE SENSE       

00:38:23.428 --> 00:38:24.160
IMPORTANT PART.                 
THE HARD IS THE THE SENSE       
OF SCALE, THE PROPORTIONALITY   

00:38:24.162 --> 00:38:27.029
THE HARD IS THE THE SENSE       
OF SCALE, THE PROPORTIONALITY   
IF YOU DO MEASURE THIS PROJECT  

00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:27.797
OF SCALE, THE PROPORTIONALITY   
IF YOU DO MEASURE THIS PROJECT  
FROM EXTERIOR FACE EXTRA SPACE, 

00:38:27.799 --> 00:38:28.531
IF YOU DO MEASURE THIS PROJECT  
FROM EXTERIOR FACE EXTRA SPACE, 
HOW COME UP WITH A CERTAIN      

00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:31.334
FROM EXTERIOR FACE EXTRA SPACE, 
HOW COME UP WITH A CERTAIN      
NUMBER BUT THEY ARE ASKING TO   

00:38:31.336 --> 00:38:35.037
HOW COME UP WITH A CERTAIN      
NUMBER BUT THEY ARE ASKING TO   
EXCLUDE SPECIF USE FROM THOSE   

00:38:35.039 --> 00:38:39.508
NUMBER BUT THEY ARE ASKING TO   
EXCLUDE SPECIF USE FROM THOSE   
NUMBERS AND IF WE DO THE MATH   

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.443
EXCLUDE SPECIF USE FROM THOSE   
NUMBERS AND IF WE DO THE MATH   
THEN EXCLUDING THAT CATEGORY    

00:38:40.445 --> 00:38:44.647
NUMBERS AND IF WE DO THE MATH   
THEN EXCLUDING THAT CATEGORY    
THE NUMBERS ARE SMALLER.        

00:38:44.649 --> 00:38:45.281
THEN EXCLUDING THAT CATEGORY    
THE NUMBERS ARE SMALLER.

WITH TINY TINY DIAGRAMS.        
THE INTENTION OF THIS REALLY AT 
THE END OF THE DAY IS WE HAVE A 

00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:51.266
THE INTENTION OF THIS REALLY AT 
THE END OF THE DAY IS WE HAVE A 
REALLY HIGH WATER TABLE AND SO  

00:56:51.268 --> 00:56:52.133
THE END OF THE DAY IS WE HAVE A 
REALLY HIGH WATER TABLE AND SO  
TO BE ABLE TO TALK THAT         

00:56:52.135 --> 00:56:52.867
REALLY HIGH WATER TABLE AND SO  
TO BE ABLE TO TALK THAT         
STORMWATER DETENTION REQUIRED   

00:56:52.869 --> 00:56:55.303
TO BE ABLE TO TALK THAT         
STORMWATER DETENTION REQUIRED   
AS PART OF THE CONDITIONS       

00:56:55.305 --> 00:56:55.970

WITHOUT LOWERING IT TO THE      
POINT OF DEWATERING THE SITE,   

00:56:59.977 --> 00:57:02.310
WITHOUT LOWERING IT TO THE      
POINT OF DEWATERING THE SITE,   
WE CAN&apos;T ACTUALLY SUBMERGE      

00:57:02.312 --> 00:57:03.178
POINT OF DEWATERING THE SITE,   
WE CAN&apos;T ACTUALLY SUBMERGE      
PARKING TO NOT QUALIFY AS NON   

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:03.945
WE CAN&apos;T ACTUALLY SUBMERGE      
PARKING TO NOT QUALIFY AS NON   
IF THEY ARE 50 PERCENT          

00:57:03.947 --> 00:57:06.347
PARKING TO NOT QUALIFY AS NON   
IF THEY ARE 50 PERCENT          
UNDERGROUND.

00:57:07.484 --> 00:57:10.685
UNDERGROUND.                    
SO THE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT    
WAS THAT WE BUILT A MOUND AS A  

00:57:10.687 --> 00:57:11.486
SO THE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT    
WAS THAT WE BUILT A MOUND AS A  
PARK AND THAT WE ALMOST CARVED  

00:57:11.488 --> 00:57:13.888
WAS THAT WE BUILT A MOUND AS A  
PARK AND THAT WE ALMOST CARVED  
A CAVE INTO THAT LANDSCAPE      

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:14.656
PARK AND THAT WE ALMOST CARVED  
A CAVE INTO THAT LANDSCAPE      
BOUND TO OUR PARKING INTO I     

00:57:14.658 --> 00:57:18.927
A CAVE INTO THAT LANDSCAPE      
BOUND TO OUR PARKING INTO I     
KNOW TECHNICALLY WE CAN WE HAVE 

00:57:18.929 --> 00:57:19.795
BOUND TO OUR PARKING INTO I     
KNOW TECHNICALLY WE CAN WE HAVE 
A ROOF IN AN ENCLOSED PARKING   

00:57:19.797 --> 00:57:22.296
KNOW TECHNICALLY WE CAN WE HAVE 
A ROOF IN AN ENCLOSED PARKING   
BUT THAT&apos;S THE DESIGN INTENT    

00:57:22.298 --> 00:57:23.331
A ROOF IN AN ENCLOSED PARKING   
BUT THAT&apos;S THE DESIGN INTENT    
AND THIS WORKS THROUGH A FEW    

00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:23.965
BUT THAT&apos;S THE DESIGN INTENT    
AND THIS WORKS THROUGH A FEW    
OF THESE OPTIONS THAT I LAID    

00:57:23.967 --> 00:57:25.767
AND THIS WORKS THROUGH A FEW    
OF THESE OPTIONS THAT I LAID    
OUT ON THE HANDOUT FOR YOU IN   

00:57:25.769 --> 00:57:30.038
OF THESE OPTIONS THAT I LAID    
OUT ON THE HANDOUT FOR YOU IN   
ONE LAYER OR I WISH I REALLY    

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:30.772
OUT ON THE HANDOUT FOR YOU IN   
ONE LAYER OR I WISH I REALLY    
WISH I COULD ZOOM IN ON THIS

01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:26.201
CARBON FOOTPRINT OF STEEL OR    
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.           
SO BASED ON THE TWENTY TWENTY   

01:02:26.203 --> 01:02:27.001
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.           
SO BASED ON THE TWENTY TWENTY   
ONE BUILDING CODE WE CAN ONLY   

01:02:27.003 --> 01:02:29.804
SO BASED ON THE TWENTY TWENTY   
ONE BUILDING CODE WE CAN ONLY   
GO TO EIGHTY FIVE FEET WHICH IS 

01:02:29.806 --> 01:02:30.138
ONE BUILDING CODE WE CAN ONLY   
GO TO EIGHTY FIVE FEET WHICH IS 
GREAT.                          

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:30.805
GO TO EIGHTY FIVE FEET WHICH IS 
GREAT.                          
IT RESTRICTS OUR HIGH WHICH     

01:02:30.807 --> 01:02:32.407
GREAT.                          
IT RESTRICTS OUR HIGH WHICH     
MEANS WE HAVE TO BUT OUR        

01:02:32.409 --> 01:02:33.274
IT RESTRICTS OUR HIGH WHICH     
MEANS WE HAVE TO BUT OUR        
FOOTPRINT OUT WHEN WE SPREAD    

01:02:33.276 --> 01:02:34.041
MEANS WE HAVE TO BUT OUR        
FOOTPRINT OUT WHEN WE SPREAD    
OUR FOOTPRINT OUT WE DON&apos;T HAVE 

01:02:34.043 --> 01:02:36.477
FOOTPRINT OUT WHEN WE SPREAD    
OUR FOOTPRINT OUT WE DON&apos;T HAVE 
INFILTRATION PARKING AREA       

01:02:36.479 --> 01:02:36.911
OUR FOOTPRINT OUT WE DON&apos;T HAVE 
INFILTRATION PARKING AREA       
BECAUSE OF IT.                  

01:02:36.913 --> 01:02:40.582
INFILTRATION PARKING AREA       
BECAUSE OF IT.                  
WE NEED TO EVEN THAT OUT TO BE  

01:02:40.584 --> 01:02:41.382
BECAUSE OF IT.                  
WE NEED TO EVEN THAT OUT TO BE  
RESPECTIVE NEIGHBORS TO AVALON  

01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:44.285
WE NEED TO EVEN THAT OUT TO BE  
RESPECTIVE NEIGHBORS TO AVALON  
AND CASTING SHADOWS OF THINGS   

01:02:44.287 --> 01:02:45.220
RESPECTIVE NEIGHBORS TO AVALON  
AND CASTING SHADOWS OF THINGS   
WE REALLY STEPPED UP TO STATE   

01:02:45.222 --> 01:02:47.355
AND CASTING SHADOWS OF THINGS   
WE REALLY STEPPED UP TO STATE   
STREET OVERALL WE HAVE MAXIMUM  

01:02:47.357 --> 01:02:48.222
WE REALLY STEPPED UP TO STATE   
STREET OVERALL WE HAVE MAXIMUM  
AS WELL BECAUSE SEE WHAT THEY   

01:02:48.224 --> 01:02:51.225
STREET OVERALL WE HAVE MAXIMUM  
AS WELL BECAUSE SEE WHAT THEY   
ARE DOES NOT HAVE A MAXIMUM.    

01:02:51.227 --> 01:02:52.293
AS WELL BECAUSE SEE WHAT THEY   
ARE DOES NOT HAVE A MAXIMUM.    
SO IT&apos;S REALLY ABOUT THAT LOT   

01:02:52.295 --> 01:02:55.864
ARE DOES NOT HAVE A MAXIMUM.    
SO IT&apos;S REALLY ABOUT THAT LOT   
COVERAGE AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE. 

01:02:55.866 --> 01:02:59.200
SO IT&apos;S REALLY ABOUT THAT LOT   
COVERAGE AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE. 
THAT LOT COVERAGE COULD COME    

01:02:59.202 --> 01:03:00.134
COVERAGE AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE. 
THAT LOT COVERAGE COULD COME    
THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS 

01:03:00.136 --> 01:03:00.735
THAT LOT COVERAGE COULD COME    
THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS 
BUT WE&apos;VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE       

01:03:00.737 --> 01:03:03.838
THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS 
BUT WE&apos;VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE       
OF ALL OF IT AND ANY OTHER KIND

ZONING LIKE WHAT WHAT PROJECT   
COULD WE SEE SURFACE PARKING    
THAT DOESN&apos;T HAVE TOWARDS FLIR  

01:03:14.617 --> 01:03:15.583
COULD WE SEE SURFACE PARKING    
THAT DOESN&apos;T HAVE TOWARDS FLIR  
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF WE    

01:03:15.585 --> 01:03:22.656

01:05:09.565 --> 01:05:10.397
OVERWHELMED IF WE LOWER THAT    
STORMWATER DETENTION BASIN WE   
WOULD HAVE TO CAP IT AND WE     

01:05:10.399 --> 01:05:11.099
STORMWATER DETENTION BASIN WE   
WOULD HAVE TO CAP IT AND WE     
WOULD BE PUMPING BECAUSE WE     

01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:13.934
WOULD HAVE TO CAP IT AND WE     
WOULD BE PUMPING BECAUSE WE     
WOULD BE IN THE AQUIFER.        

01:05:13.936 --> 01:05:14.869
WOULD BE PUMPING BECAUSE WE     
WOULD BE IN THE AQUIFER.        
BUT ONCE WE&apos;RE IN THAT WATER    

01:05:14.871 --> 01:05:17.872
WOULD BE IN THE AQUIFER.        
BUT ONCE WE&apos;RE IN THAT WATER    
TABLE THERE WE WOULD BE PUMPING 

01:05:17.874 --> 01:05:18.739
BUT ONCE WE&apos;RE IN THAT WATER    
TABLE THERE WE WOULD BE PUMPING 
IT OUT TO ENSURE IT&apos;S EMPTY TO

01:05:21.878 --> 01:05:22.610
IT OUT TO ENSURE IT&apos;S EMPTY TO  
TAKE ON THAT ONE HUNDRED YEAR   
STORM EVENT AND SO WE WOULD     

01:05:22.612 --> 01:05:24.779
TAKE ON THAT ONE HUNDRED YEAR   
STORM EVENT AND SO WE WOULD     
CONTINUOUSLY BE LOADING UP THE  

01:05:24.781 --> 01:05:25.513
STORM EVENT AND SO WE WOULD     
CONTINUOUSLY BE LOADING UP THE  
STORM WATER SYSTEM OF THE CITY  

01:05:25.515 --> 01:05:28.883
CONTINUOUSLY BE LOADING UP THE  
STORM WATER SYSTEM OF THE CITY  
WHICH IS A BIG COST THAT WOULD

OVERWHELMING OUR CITY SERVICE   
INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT&apos;S NOT     

01:05:36.459 --> 01:05:37.358
OVERWHELMING OUR CITY SERVICE   
INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT&apos;S NOT     
JUST PRACTICES, RIGHT TO JUST   

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.327
INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT&apos;S NOT     
JUST PRACTICES, RIGHT TO JUST   
BE PUMPING THE WATER PEOPLE OUT 

01:05:40.329 --> 01:05:41.229
JUST PRACTICES, RIGHT TO JUST   
BE PUMPING THE WATER PEOPLE OUT 
AND THEN BACK TO MAYBE THAT     

01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:42.029
BE PUMPING THE WATER PEOPLE OUT 
AND THEN BACK TO MAYBE THAT     
GEOTHERMAL TO MAKE SURE THAT    

01:05:42.031 --> 01:05:44.399
AND THEN BACK TO MAYBE THAT     
GEOTHERMAL TO MAKE SURE THAT    
WE&apos;RE NOT TOUCHING THAT         

01:05:44.401 --> 01:05:44.799
GEOTHERMAL TO MAKE SURE THAT    
WE&apos;RE NOT TOUCHING THAT         
AQUIFER.                        

01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:48.269
WE&apos;RE NOT TOUCHING THAT         
AQUIFER.                        
WATER IS THE BEST CONDUCTOR FOR 

01:05:48.271 --> 01:05:49.137
AQUIFER.                        
WATER IS THE BEST CONDUCTOR FOR 
ENERGY BEFORE WE DRILL THOSE    

01:05:49.139 --> 01:05:52.540
WATER IS THE BEST CONDUCTOR FOR 
ENERGY BEFORE WE DRILL THOSE    
WELLS OVER FIVE HUNDRED DEEP    

01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:53.607
ENERGY BEFORE WE DRILL THOSE    
WELLS OVER FIVE HUNDRED DEEP    
AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE A REALLY 

01:05:53.609 --> 01:05:56.944
WELLS OVER FIVE HUNDRED DEEP    
AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE A REALLY 
HEALTHY AQUIFER TO BE ABLE TO   

01:05:56.946 --> 01:05:57.878
AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE A REALLY 
HEALTHY AQUIFER TO BE ABLE TO   
HAVE A LONG LIFE SPAN OF THAT   

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.048
HEALTHY AQUIFER TO BE ABLE TO   
HAVE A LONG LIFE SPAN OF THAT   
GEOTHERMAL FIELD AND THAT       

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:00.648
HAVE A LONG LIFE SPAN OF THAT   
GEOTHERMAL FIELD AND THAT       
REALLY IS OUR SUSTAINABILITY    

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:03.952
GEOTHERMAL FIELD AND THAT       
REALLY IS OUR SUSTAINABILITY    
GOALS AND IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT 

01:06:03.954 --> 01:06:04.819
REALLY IS OUR SUSTAINABILITY    
GOALS AND IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT 
OF ELECTRICITY THAT WE NEED TO  

01:06:04.821 --> 01:06:05.486
GOALS AND IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT 
OF ELECTRICITY THAT WE NEED TO  
PULL INTO THE SITE BECAUSE WE   

01:06:05.488 --> 01:06:08.089
OF ELECTRICITY THAT WE NEED TO  
PULL INTO THE SITE BECAUSE WE   
CAN USE RENEWABLES AND AS WE    

01:06:08.091 --> 01:06:11.960
PULL INTO THE SITE BECAUSE WE   
CAN USE RENEWABLES AND AS WE    
DID DTT ALL THESE STUDIES TO    

01:06:11.962 --> 01:06:12.894
CAN USE RENEWABLES AND AS WE    
DID DTT ALL THESE STUDIES TO    
FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY 

01:06:12.896 --> 01:06:15.596
DID DTT ALL THESE STUDIES TO    
FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY 
WE MIGHT BRING, WE REALIZE THAT 

01:06:15.598 --> 01:06:16.363
FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY 
WE MIGHT BRING, WE REALIZE THAT 
IF THIS PROJECT WERE FULLY      

01:06:16.365 --> 01:06:18.999
WE MIGHT BRING, WE REALIZE THAT 
IF THIS PROJECT WERE FULLY      
ELECTRIFIED FROM WITHOUT ONSITE 

01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:22.470
IF THIS PROJECT WERE FULLY      
ELECTRIFIED FROM WITHOUT ONSITE 
RENEWABLES WE WOULD MAX OUT     

01:06:22.472 --> 01:06:26.340
ELECTRIFIED FROM WITHOUT ONSITE 
RENEWABLES WE WOULD MAX OUT     
SUBSTATION PROVIDES TO THE SITE 

01:06:26.342 --> 01:06:26.574
RENEWABLES WE WOULD MAX OUT     
SUBSTATION PROVIDES TO THE SITE 
.                               

01:06:26.576 --> 01:06:27.575
SUBSTATION PROVIDES TO THE SITE 
.

OR TWO.                         
I JUST DON&apos;T SEE HOW A SURFACE  

01:22:21.397 --> 01:22:22.663
OR TWO.                         
I JUST DON&apos;T SEE HOW A SURFACE  
PARKING WITHOUT THIS TRANSITION 

01:22:22.665 --> 01:22:23.530
I JUST DON&apos;T SEE HOW A SURFACE  
PARKING WITHOUT THIS TRANSITION 
A PUBLIC AMENITY OF GREEN       

01:22:23.532 --> 01:22:26.967
PARKING WITHOUT THIS TRANSITION 
A PUBLIC AMENITY OF GREEN       
SPACES IS BETTER.               

01:22:26.969 --> 01:22:27.967
A PUBLIC AMENITY OF GREEN       
SPACES IS BETTER.               
I DO HAVE A QUESTION PERHAPS    

01:22:27.969 --> 01:22:31.037
SPACES IS BETTER.               
I DO HAVE A QUESTION PERHAPS    
FOR STAFF ABOUT HOW VARIANTS    

01:22:31.039 --> 01:22:31.704
I DO HAVE A QUESTION PERHAPS    
FOR STAFF ABOUT HOW VARIANTS    
LIKE THIS GETS TRANSFERRED      

01:22:31.706 --> 01:22:32.305
FOR STAFF ABOUT HOW VARIANTS    
LIKE THIS GETS TRANSFERRED      
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE         

01:22:32.307 --> 01:22:35.108
LIKE THIS GETS TRANSFERRED      
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE         
VARIANCE GOES WITH THE LAND.    

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:36.209
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE         
VARIANCE GOES WITH THE LAND.    
BUT HOW STRICT IS THE           

01:22:36.211 --> 01:22:38.211
VARIANCE GOES WITH THE LAND.    
BUT HOW STRICT IS THE           
INTERPRETATION OF THE VARIANCE? 

01:22:38.213 --> 01:22:41.981
BUT HOW STRICT IS THE           
INTERPRETATION OF THE VARIANCE? 
SO LIKE IF WE GRANTED THIS WITH 

01:22:41.983 --> 01:22:42.616
INTERPRETATION OF THE VARIANCE? 
SO LIKE IF WE GRANTED THIS WITH 
WHAT SPECIFICITY WOULD IT BE    

01:22:42.618 --> 01:22:45.852
SO LIKE IF WE GRANTED THIS WITH 
WHAT SPECIFICITY WOULD IT BE    
CARRIED OVER TO ANOTHER SITE?   

01:22:45.854 --> 01:22:47.020
WHAT SPECIFICITY WOULD IT BE    
CARRIED OVER TO ANOTHER SITE?   
COULD IT BE IGNORE ALL PARKING  

01:22:47.022 --> 01:22:50.257
CARRIED OVER TO ANOTHER SITE?   
COULD IT BE IGNORE ALL PARKING  
AND OK GO AHEAD.                

01:22:50.259 --> 01:22:53.660
COULD IT BE IGNORE ALL PARKING  
AND OK GO AHEAD.                
WELL I DON&apos;T IT DOESN&apos;T CARRY   

01:22:53.662 --> 01:22:57.097
AND OK GO AHEAD.                
WELL I DON&apos;T IT DOESN&apos;T CARRY   
OVER TO ANOTHER SITE.           

01:22:57.099 --> 01:22:58.031
WELL I DON&apos;T IT DOESN&apos;T CARRY   
OVER TO ANOTHER SITE.           
OK, BUT YOU WOULD HAVE          

01:22:58.033 --> 01:23:00.767
OVER TO ANOTHER SITE.           
OK, BUT YOU WOULD HAVE          
ESTABLISHED THE PRECEDENT THAT  

01:23:00.769 --> 01:23:01.501
OK, BUT YOU WOULD HAVE          
ESTABLISHED THE PRECEDENT THAT  
SOMEONE COULD REQUEST AND       

01:23:01.503 --> 01:23:05.305
ESTABLISHED THE PRECEDENT THAT  
SOMEONE COULD REQUEST AND       
DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT A HIGH    

01:23:05.307 --> 01:23:07.875
SOMEONE COULD REQUEST AND       
DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT A HIGH    
WATER TABLE OR ANOTHER FEATURE  

01:23:07.877 --> 01:23:08.742
DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT A HIGH    
WATER TABLE OR ANOTHER FEATURE  
IS JUSTIFICATION FOR A VARIANCE 

01:23:08.744 --> 01:23:12.746
WATER TABLE OR ANOTHER FEATURE  
IS JUSTIFICATION FOR A VARIANCE 
IN TERMS OF HOW IT WOULD APPLY  

01:23:12.748 --> 01:23:16.015
IS JUSTIFICATION FOR A VARIANCE 
IN TERMS OF HOW IT WOULD APPLY  
TO A FUTURE IF THIS PROJECT     

01:23:16.017 --> 01:23:16.850
IN TERMS OF HOW IT WOULD APPLY  
TO A FUTURE IF THIS PROJECT     
DOESN&apos;T COME TO FRUITION IT I   

01:23:16.852 --> 01:23:18.284
TO A FUTURE IF THIS PROJECT     
DOESN&apos;T COME TO FRUITION IT I   
BELIEVE IT WOULD ALONG WITH THE 

01:23:18.286 --> 01:23:22.689
DOESN&apos;T COME TO FRUITION IT I   
BELIEVE IT WOULD ALONG WITH THE 
LAND UNLESS IT WAS SOMEHOW      

01:23:22.691 --> 01:23:25.425
BELIEVE IT WOULD ALONG WITH THE 
LAND UNLESS IT WAS SOMEHOW      
CONDITIONED FOR THIS PARTICULAR 

01:23:25.427 --> 01:23:29.630
LAND UNLESS IT WAS SOMEHOW      
CONDITIONED FOR THIS PARTICULAR 
DESIGN AND I BELIEVE THAT       

01:23:29.632 --> 01:23:32.899
CONDITIONED FOR THIS PARTICULAR 
DESIGN AND I BELIEVE THAT       
SOMEONE HAD MENTIONED I HAVE TO 

01:23:32.901 --> 01:23:36.202
DESIGN AND I BELIEVE THAT       
SOMEONE HAD MENTIONED I HAVE TO 
VERIFY THAT WITH JOHN BARITE IF 

01:23:36.204 --> 01:23:40.606
SOMEONE HAD MENTIONED I HAVE TO 
VERIFY THAT WITH JOHN BARITE IF 
THAT CAN BE AN ACTION TO AVOID  

01:23:40.608 --> 01:23:43.843
VERIFY THAT WITH JOHN BARITE IF 
THAT CAN BE AN ACTION TO AVOID  
A VARIANCE OR LACK OF A RETURN  

01:23:43.845 --> 01:23:44.077
THAT CAN BE AN ACTION TO AVOID  
A VARIANCE OR LACK OF A RETURN  
.                               

01:23:44.079 --> 01:23:47.914
A VARIANCE OR LACK OF A RETURN  
.                               
SO THE VARIANCE OR THE MOTION   

01:23:47.916 --> 01:23:48.915
.                               
SO THE VARIANCE OR THE MOTION   
COULD BE CUSTOMIZED TO SAY THAT 

01:23:48.917 --> 01:23:52.385
SO THE VARIANCE OR THE MOTION   
COULD BE CUSTOMIZED TO SAY THAT 
THIS WAS ONLY CONSISTENT WITH   

01:23:52.387 --> 01:23:55.288
COULD BE CUSTOMIZED TO SAY THAT 
THIS WAS ONLY CONSISTENT WITH   
THIS PROJECT SOMETHING TO THAT  

01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:55.555
THIS WAS ONLY CONSISTENT WITH   
THIS PROJECT SOMETHING TO THAT  
EFFECT.                         

01:23:55.557 --> 01:23:56.356
THIS PROJECT SOMETHING TO THAT  
EFFECT.                         
AND THEN ALSO SOMEBODY DID      

01:23:56.358 --> 01:23:59.759
EFFECT.                         
AND THEN ALSO SOMEBODY DID      
BRING UP LAPSING AS WELL WHICH  

01:23:59.761 --> 01:24:03.696
AND THEN ALSO SOMEBODY DID      
BRING UP LAPSING AS WELL WHICH  
HAS NOT HAPPENED IN MY TENURE.  

01:24:03.698 --> 01:24:04.698
BRING UP LAPSING AS WELL WHICH  
HAS NOT HAPPENED IN MY TENURE.  
BUT THERE IS A SECTION OF CODE  

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.534
HAS NOT HAPPENED IN MY TENURE.  
BUT THERE IS A SECTION OF CODE  
THAT STATES THAT IF A VARIANCE  

01:24:07.536 --> 01:24:10.937

ON THIS I THINK IT IS AN        
ELEGANT BUILDING.               
I KNOW THERE&apos;S BEEN EXPERIENCES 

01:24:57.419 --> 01:24:59.919

I KNOW THERE&apos;S BEEN EXPERIENCES 
IN THE PAST NOT ZONING BOARD    

01:24:59.921 --> 01:25:00.754
I KNOW THERE&apos;S BEEN EXPERIENCES 
IN THE PAST NOT ZONING BOARD    
CITY COUNCIL WHERE DEVELOPERS   

01:25:00.756 --> 01:25:04.624
IN THE PAST NOT ZONING BOARD    
CITY COUNCIL WHERE DEVELOPERS   
COULDN&apos;T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

AND RESORTED TO SORT OF A       
HOMOGENOUS BLOCK.               
I&apos;M THINKING OF A STRETCH ONE S 

01:25:13.068 --> 01:25:16.803
HOMOGENOUS BLOCK.               
I&apos;M THINKING OF A STRETCH ONE S 
FIFTH ON THE EAST SIDE JUST     

01:25:16.805 --> 01:25:17.571
I&apos;M THINKING OF A STRETCH ONE S 
FIFTH ON THE EAST SIDE JUST     
BEFORE PACARD I THINK WITH A    

01:25:17.573 --> 01:25:20.807
FIFTH ON THE EAST SIDE JUST     
BEFORE PACARD I THINK WITH A

01:25:21.577 --> 01:25:24.811
DEVELOPER SAID FINE I&apos;LL JUST   
BUILD WHAT YOU CAN DO AND THAT  
IS REALLY THE SINGLE PROBLEM I  

01:25:24.813 --> 01:25:27.180

CRITERIA ABOUT THE THE MINIMUM  
USE OF THE PROPERTY AND I THINK 
THE DEVELOPER COULD BUILD       

01:25:31.586 --> 01:25:35.021
USE OF THE PROPERTY AND I THINK 
THE DEVELOPER COULD BUILD       
SOMETHING THAT WAS BORING WITH  

01:25:35.023 --> 01:25:35.789
THE DEVELOPER COULD BUILD       
SOMETHING THAT WAS BORING WITH  
ATTACHED PARKING STRUCTURE THAT 

01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:39.259
SOMETHING THAT WAS BORING WITH  
ATTACHED PARKING STRUCTURE THAT 
MET THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

PRODUCE A A GOOD PRODUCT WITH   
IT.                             
I THINK THAT IT IS A STANDARD   

01:26:56.338 --> 01:26:59.206

I THINK THAT IT IS A STANDARD   
THAT IS THE ENEMY OF ANY        

01:26:59.208 --> 01:27:00.273
I THINK THAT IT IS A STANDARD   
THAT IS THE ENEMY OF ANY        
COMMUNITY THAT PURPORTS TO WANT 

01:27:00.275 --> 01:27:03.877
THAT IS THE ENEMY OF ANY        
COMMUNITY THAT PURPORTS TO WANT 
ADEQUATE HOUSING SUPPLY BUILT   

01:27:03.879 --> 01:27:07.580
COMMUNITY THAT PURPORTS TO WANT 
ADEQUATE HOUSING SUPPLY BUILT   
IN THEIR COMMUNITY.             

01:27:07.582 --> 01:27:10.450
ADEQUATE HOUSING SUPPLY BUILT

AND I WOULD HATE THE IDEA THAT  
ANN ARBOR AND ITS RESIDENTS AND

WE GET A LESSER PRODUCT BECAUSE 

01:27:22.231 --> 01:27:26.766

THEORY YOU COULD BUILD NO       
PARKING BUT THEN YOU&apos;RE         

01:28:00.803 --> 01:28:01.401
THEORY YOU COULD BUILD NO       
PARKING BUT THEN YOU&apos;RE         
CREATING PROBLEMS FOR           

01:28:01.403 --> 01:28:01.735
PARKING BUT THEN YOU&apos;RE         
CREATING PROBLEMS FOR           
RESIDENTS.                      

01:28:01.737 --> 01:28:02.469
CREATING PROBLEMS FOR           
RESIDENTS.                      
YOU&apos;RE CREATING PROBLEMS FOR

YOU&apos;RE CREATING PROBLEMS FOR    
NEIGHBORS.                      
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IF IF IT WAS  

01:28:09.178 --> 01:28:09.909
NEIGHBORS.                      
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IF IF IT WAS  
THREE PARKING SPOTS PER UNIT,   

01:28:09.911 --> 01:28:12.779
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IF IF IT WAS  
THREE PARKING SPOTS PER UNIT,   
THEN I THINK WE WOULD HAVE THE  

01:28:12.781 --> 01:28:13.646
THREE PARKING SPOTS PER UNIT,   
THEN I THINK WE WOULD HAVE THE  
JUSTIFICATION TO SAY THAT IS    

01:28:13.648 --> 01:28:14.047
THEN I THINK WE WOULD HAVE THE  
JUSTIFICATION TO SAY THAT IS    
NOT RIGHT.                      

01:28:14.049 --> 01:28:14.614
JUSTIFICATION TO SAY THAT IS    
NOT RIGHT.                      
THAT&apos;S NOT THE MINIMUM.         

01:28:14.616 --> 01:28:17.350
NOT RIGHT.                      
THAT&apos;S NOT THE MINIMUM.         
I THINK THEY KNOW THEN I THINK  

01:28:17.352 --> 01:28:17.817
THAT&apos;S NOT THE MINIMUM.         
I THINK THEY KNOW THEN I THINK  
WE KNOW THAT.                   

01:28:17.819 --> 01:28:19.585
I THINK THEY KNOW THEN I THINK  
WE KNOW THAT.                   
SO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT AND   

01:28:19.587 --> 01:28:24.023
WE KNOW THAT.                   
SO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT AND

01:28:39.841 --> 01:28:40.574
I MEAN I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER   
PROJECTS LIKE THIS BUT YOU KNOW 
HOW MANY PROJECTS COME BEFORE   

01:28:40.576 --> 01:28:44.311
PROJECTS LIKE THIS BUT YOU KNOW 
HOW MANY PROJECTS COME BEFORE   
US AND THEY CAN&apos;T MEET FAR      

01:28:44.313 --> 01:28:44.677
HOW MANY PROJECTS COME BEFORE   
US AND THEY CAN&apos;T MEET FAR      
RIGHT.

RIGHT.                          
IT&apos;S NOT HAPPENING AND FRANKLY  

01:28:47.049 --> 01:28:47.881
RIGHT.                          
IT&apos;S NOT HAPPENING AND FRANKLY  
IT SHOULDN&apos;T BE AN IMPEDIMENT   

01:28:47.883 --> 01:28:51.084

01:28:52.154 --> 01:28:55.055
TOWARDS PROVIDING HOUSING.      
AND SO I THINK THAT THEY HAVE   
MET THE STANDARDS AND I THINK

AND SO I THINK THAT THEY HAVE   
MET THE STANDARDS AND I THINK   
THAT IF WE VOTED NO WE WOULD BE

APPROPRIATE OR IS THAT TO HER   
TO SOUND?                       

01:29:58.153 --> 01:30:04.324
APPROPRIATE OR IS THAT TO HER   
TO SOUND?                       
YEAH,                           

01:30:05.793 --> 01:30:09.295
      SO IF IT&apos;S ONLY           
CONDITIONAL FOR ACCURATE        
PARKING IS THE VARIANCE THAT    

01:30:09.297 --> 01:30:10.129
CONDITIONAL FOR ACCURATE        
PARKING IS THE VARIANCE THAT    
MEANS THAT ANY DECT PARKING     

01:30:10.131 --> 01:30:10.930
PARKING IS THE VARIANCE THAT    
MEANS THAT ANY DECT PARKING     
WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THE EFFORT  

01:30:10.932 --> 01:30:13.166
MEANS THAT ANY DECT PARKING     
WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THE EFFORT  
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE 

01:30:13.168 --> 01:30:14.066
WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THE EFFORT  
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE 
FOR THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY IS   

01:30:14.068 --> 01:30:16.970
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE 
FOR THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY IS   
THE PARKING THAT WE CAN&apos;T SYNC  

01:30:16.972 --> 01:30:17.303
FOR THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY IS   
THE PARKING THAT WE CAN&apos;T SYNC  
.                               

01:30:17.305 --> 01:30:18.304
THE PARKING THAT WE CAN&apos;T SYNC  
.                               
SO ANY FURTHER PARKING OF ANY   

01:30:18.306 --> 01:30:19.004
.                               
SO ANY FURTHER PARKING OF ANY   
FUTURE PROJECT I MEAN WE&apos;RE     

01:30:19.006 --> 01:30:21.941
SO ANY FURTHER PARKING OF ANY   
FUTURE PROJECT I MEAN WE&apos;RE     
HAPPY WITH IT WITH THIS PLAN TO 

01:30:21.943 --> 01:30:22.742
FUTURE PROJECT I MEAN WE&apos;RE     
HAPPY WITH IT WITH THIS PLAN TO 
WE KNOW THAT THESE THINGS ARE   

01:30:22.744 --> 01:30:25.211

VERY WEDDED TOGETHER IN THIS    
MATRIX OF THINGS.               

01:30:25.814 --> 01:30:26.712
VERY WEDDED TOGETHER IN THIS    
MATRIX OF THINGS.               
BUT AT GRADE PARKING IS REALLY  

01:30:26.714 --> 01:30:29.482
MATRIX OF THINGS.               
BUT AT GRADE PARKING IS REALLY  
THE VARIANCE THAT WE&apos;RE

BUT AT GRADE PARKING IS REALLY  
THE VARIANCE THAT WE&apos;RE         
SEEKING.

THE VARIANCE THAT WE&apos;RE         
SEEKING.

FOOTAGE OF THAT PARKING         

01:30:38.126 --> 01:30:40.260
THEN IT PROVIDES A SQUARE       
FOOTAGE OF THAT PARKING
