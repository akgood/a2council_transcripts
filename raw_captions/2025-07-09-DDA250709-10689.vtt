00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:15.883
DATA, WEAK GOOD INFLATION       
REPORTS AND THEN IT'S GONE THE  
OTHER WAY.                      

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:17.051
REPORTS AND THEN IT'S GONE THE  
OTHER WAY.                      
AND SO THE MARKET HAS REALLY    

00:05:17.053 --> 00:05:20.255
OTHER WAY.                      
AND SO THE MARKET HAS REALLY    
KIND OF MOVED ON THAT LAST WEEK 

00:05:20.257 --> 00:05:23.691
AND SO THE MARKET HAS REALLY    
KIND OF MOVED ON THAT LAST WEEK 
I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST WEEK WE   

00:05:23.693 --> 00:05:27.562
KIND OF MOVED ON THAT LAST WEEK 
I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST WEEK WE   
HAD STRONG NUMBERS ON T JOBS    

00:05:27.564 --> 00:05:28.529
I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST WEEK WE   
HAD STRONG NUMBERS ON T JOBS    
CREATED AND SO WHILE THERE WAS  

00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:34.802
HAD STRONG NUMBERS ON T JOBS    
CREATED AND SO WHILE THERE WAS  
A 18 PERCENT CHANCE OF A CUT IN 

00:05:34.804 --> 00:05:35.737
CREATED AND SO WHILE THERE WAS  
A 18 PERCENT CHANCE OF A CUT IN 
JULY BEFORE THAT NUMBER CAME    

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:39.607
A 18 PERCENT CHANCE OF A CUT IN 
JULY BEFORE THAT NUMBER CAME    
OUT, IT'S BASICALLY DOWN TO     

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:39.941
JULY BEFORE THAT NUMBER CAME    
OUT, IT'S BASICALLY DOWN TO     
ZERO NOW.                       

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:43.644
OUT, IT'S BASICALLY DOWN TO     
ZERO NOW.                       
SO ANYWAY I I DO BELIEVE THAT   

00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:46.648
ZERO NOW.                       
SO ANYWAY I I DO BELIEVE THAT   
TWO CUTS WE WILL SEE TWO CUTS   

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.950
SO ANYWAY I I DO BELIEVE THAT   
TWO CUTS WE WILL SEE TWO CUTS   
THIS YEAR.                      

00:05:49.952 --> 00:05:54.121

I BELIEVE THE ATLANTA FED IS    

00:07:30.086 --> 00:07:31.018
ECONOMY.                        
I BELIEVE THE ATLANTA FED IS    
PROJECTING ABOUT TWO AND A HALF 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.488
I BELIEVE THE ATLANTA FED IS    
PROJECTING ABOUT TWO AND A HALF 
PERCENT GROWTH FOR Q2 GDP.      

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.058
PROJECTING ABOUT TWO AND A HALF 
PERCENT GROWTH FOR Q2 GDP.      
IT WAS NEGATIVE FOUR POINT FIVE 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.993
PERCENT GROWTH FOR Q2 GDP.      
IT WAS NEGATIVE FOUR POINT FIVE 
FOR Q1 MOSTLY BECAUSE OF NET    

00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:42.096
IT WAS NEGATIVE FOUR POINT FIVE 
FOR Q1 MOSTLY BECAUSE OF NET    
EXPORTS.                        

00:07:42.098 --> 00:07:43.064
FOR Q1 MOSTLY BECAUSE OF NET    
EXPORTS.                        
SO THIS IS BASICALLY STILL      

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:45.533
EXPORTS.

THE ECONOMY IS STILL MOVING     
ALONG.                          
TURNING THE PAGE THREE THIS IS  

00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:54.242
ALONG.

00:08:14.463 --> 00:08:16.197
CLAIMS.                         
SO AGAIN IT'S TIMELY.           
IT'S A LEADING INDICATOR AND    

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:17.031
SO AGAIN IT'S TIMELY.           
IT'S A LEADING INDICATOR AND    
THIS IS SHOWS UNEMPLOYMENT

CLAIMS ON A FOUR WEEK MOVING    
AVERAGE.                        
SO WHEN SOMEONE LOSES THEIR     

00:08:19.302 --> 00:08:20.168
AVERAGE.                        
SO WHEN SOMEONE LOSES THEIR

IS THEY SIGN UP FOR             
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.          
SO IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAKENING, 

00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:22.771
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.          
SO IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAKENING, 
WEAKENING, WE SHOULD START TO   

00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:24.405
SO IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAKENING, 
WEAKENING, WE SHOULD START TO   
SEE THAT NUMBER RISE.           

00:08:24.407 --> 00:08:25.506
WEAKENING, WE SHOULD START TO   
SEE THAT NUMBER RISE.           
YOU CAN SEE KIND OF TWENTY      

00:08:25.508 --> 00:08:28.610
SEE THAT NUMBER RISE.           
YOU CAN SEE KIND OF TWENTY      
TWENTY FIVE IT'S GOING UP A BIT 

00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:29.543
YOU CAN SEE KIND OF TWENTY      
TWENTY FIVE IT'S GOING UP A BIT 
BUT WE HAD A GOOD NUMBER ON     

00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:31.479
TWENTY FIVE IT'S GOING UP A BIT 
BUT WE HAD A GOOD NUMBER ON     
THAT LAST WEEK THAT WAS AROUND  

00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:31.879

THAT LAST WEEK THAT WAS AROUND  
TO THIRTY.                      

00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:35.483
THAT LAST WEEK THAT WAS AROUND  
TO THIRTY.                      
SO THE RED LINE IS UNEMPLOYMENT 

00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:36.217
TO THIRTY.

YIELD THAT WE SHOULD BE         
FOCUSING ON BECAUSE IT TAKES

SO OVERALL THE YIELD TO         

00:13:53.002 --> 00:13:57.404
OF THE THE LAST PAYMENT.        
SO OVERALL THE YIELD TO         
MATURITY ON THE PORTFOLIO WAS   

00:13:57.406 --> 00:13:58.338
SO OVERALL THE YIELD TO

PROBABLY CAN'T READ THAT BUT IT 

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.842
MATURITY ON THE PORTFOLIO WAS   
PROBABLY CAN'T READ THAT BUT IT 
IS THREE POINT EIGHTY THREE IN  

00:14:00.844 --> 00:14:04.478
PROBABLY CAN'T READ THAT BUT IT 
IS THREE POINT EIGHTY THREE IN  
THE DURATION WHICH IS A MAJOR   

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.579
IS THREE POINT EIGHTY THREE IN  
THE DURATION WHICH IS A MAJOR   
RISK IS TWO POINT THREE ONE     

00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:08.616
THE DURATION WHICH IS A MAJOR   
RISK IS TWO POINT THREE ONE     
YEARS.                          

00:14:08.618 --> 00:14:09.750
RISK IS TWO POINT THREE ONE     
YEARS.                          
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH   

00:14:09.752 --> 00:14:13.154
YEARS.                          
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH   
THE PORTFOLIO OVER THE LAST     

00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:13.887
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH   
THE PORTFOLIO OVER THE LAST     
YEAR IS BASICALLY DOUBLED THE   

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:17.090
THE PORTFOLIO OVER THE LAST     
YEAR IS BASICALLY DOUBLED THE   
DURATION FROM A LITTLE OVER ONE 

00:14:17.092 --> 00:14:17.791
YEAR IS BASICALLY DOUBLED THE

YEAR TO TWO POINT THREE YEARS   

00:14:17.793 --> 00:14:20.394
DURATION FROM A LITTLE OVER ONE 
YEAR TO TWO POINT THREE YEARS   
AND I THINK THAT REALLY MAKES   

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:24.665
YEAR TO TWO POINT THREE YEARS   
AND I THINK THAT REALLY MAKES   
SENSE IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT   

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:25.599
AND I THINK THAT REALLY MAKES   
SENSE IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT   
TWO TO THREE YEAR RATES COMING
