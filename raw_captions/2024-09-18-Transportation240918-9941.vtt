THE SHORT VERSION IS IS THAT    
THEY'RE NOT REALLY EXTRA SPACE  

00:28:08.715 --> 00:28:09.480
THE SHORT VERSION IS IS THAT    
THEY'RE NOT REALLY EXTRA SPACE  
TO DO THAT WHILE ALSO

AT JUST OUR FATAL CRASHES, WE   
ARE STILL YOU KNOW, WE HAD

AT JUST OUR FATAL CRASHES, WE   
ARE STILL YOU KNOW, WE HAD      
THREE LAST YEAR, THREE STILL    

01:08:55.059 --> 01:08:55.457
ARE STILL YOU KNOW, WE HAD      
THREE LAST YEAR, THREE STILL    
TOO MANY.

THREE LAST YEAR, THREE STILL    
TOO MANY.                       
BUT OUR PATTERN IS A LITTLE BIT 

01:08:58.896 --> 01:08:59.895
TOO MANY.                       
BUT OUR PATTERN IS A LITTLE BIT 
MORE STABLE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING

01:09:00.598 --> 01:09:02.799
MORE STABLE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING 
AT OUR FIVE YEAR AVERAGE.       
SO WE'RE STILL RUNNING BETWEEN

AT OUR FIVE YEAR AVERAGE.       
SO WE'RE STILL RUNNING BETWEEN  
TWO TO THREE CRASHES ON AVERAGE

TYPICALLY IT'S ONE ONE PARTY    
WHO HAS THE MORE EGREGIOUS      
HAZARD WHICH MAKE THE ASPHALT   

01:12:20.798 --> 01:12:21.397
WHO HAS THE MORE EGREGIOUS      
HAZARD WHICH MAKE THE ASPHALT   
AND THEN THE SECOND MOST        

01:12:21.399 --> 01:12:24.500
HAZARD WHICH MAKE THE ASPHALT   
AND THEN THE SECOND MOST

YES, YOU CAN SEE MULTIPLE       

01:12:28.472 --> 01:12:29.338
SEE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION     
YES, YOU CAN SEE MULTIPLE       
HAZARDS VIOLATIONS ON A SINGLE  

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.242
YES, YOU CAN SEE MULTIPLE       
HAZARDS VIOLATIONS ON A SINGLE  
CRASH ON THE BIG THE BIG DATA   

01:12:33.244 --> 01:12:36.712
HAZARDS VIOLATIONS ON A SINGLE  
CRASH ON THE BIG THE BIG DATA   
SET YOU'LL SEE THAT THE         

01:12:36.714 --> 01:12:39.448
CRASH ON THE BIG THE BIG DATA   
SET YOU'LL SEE THAT THE         
MAJORITY OR THE THE MOST COMMON

SET YOU'LL SEE THAT THE         
MAJORITY OR THE THE MOST COMMON 
HAZARDS VIOLATION IS GOING TO   

01:12:40.151 --> 01:12:43.819
MAJORITY OR THE THE MOST COMMON 
HAZARDS VIOLATION IS GOING TO   
SAY NONE BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES 

01:12:43.821 --> 01:12:44.753
HAZARDS VIOLATION IS GOING TO   
SAY NONE BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES 
YOU'LL HAVE ONE UNIT HAS A      

01:12:44.755 --> 01:12:47.823
SAY NONE BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES 
YOU'LL HAVE ONE UNIT HAS A      
HOUSE VIOLATION AND THEN THE    

01:12:47.825 --> 01:12:48.423
YOU'LL HAVE ONE UNIT HAS A      
HOUSE VIOLATION AND THEN THE    
SECOND UNIT HAS NONE.

IT RAISES AN A LEVEL INJURY IN  
TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE HAVE ONE

AND THE UDY 10 FATALITIES AND   
IT'S PROBABLY THAT SAME THAT SO 
WE HAVE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.     

01:15:19.243 --> 01:15:19.941
IT'S PROBABLY THAT SAME THAT SO 
WE HAVE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

WE HAVE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.     
OKAY YEAH.                      
JUST SO I JUST WANT TO ADD SOME

JUST SO I JUST WANT TO ADD SOME 
CONTEXT.                        
>> THE REASON FOR THE

DISCREPANCY IS THAT SOME        
OF THESE CRASHES ARE LOCATED    
OUTSIDE THE RIGHT WAY SO THEN   

01:15:31.956 --> 01:15:32.821
OF THESE CRASHES ARE LOCATED    
OUTSIDE THE RIGHT WAY SO THEN   
THE DUTY TENDS THAT WE WOULD    

01:15:32.823 --> 01:15:35.891
OUTSIDE THE RIGHT WAY SO THEN   
THE DUTY TENDS THAT WE WOULD    
HAVE PULLED TO REVIEW THOSE     

01:15:35.893 --> 01:15:36.625
THE DUTY TENDS THAT WE WOULD    
HAVE PULLED TO REVIEW THOSE     
CRASHES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN  

01:15:36.627 --> 01:15:39.729
HAVE PULLED TO REVIEW THOSE     
CRASHES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN  
THE DATA SET THAT WE            

01:15:39.731 --> 01:15:40.462
CRASHES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN  
THE DATA SET THAT WE            
INVESTIGATED VERSUS THE CRASH

ALL OF THOSE FATAL CRASHES.     
SO I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A   

01:15:47.938 --> 01:15:48.604
ALL OF THOSE FATAL CRASHES.     
SO I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A   
LITTLE CONTEXT TO THAT.         

01:15:48.606 --> 01:15:49.004

INVOLVE A BEHAVIOR THAT'S IN    
THOSE FIVE BEHAVIORS THAT COULD 
BE CHANGED AND WHETHER WE HAVE  

01:37:19.095 --> 01:37:22.297
THOSE FIVE BEHAVIORS THAT COULD 
BE CHANGED AND WHETHER WE HAVE  
OUR CURRENT GRANT FUNDING FOR

AND WE NOTICED THAT 25 PERCENT  

01:39:15.678 --> 01:39:19.280
THE NEXT IS OUR QUICK PROGRAM   
AND WE NOTICED THAT 25 PERCENT  
OF THOSE THAT FIVE YEARS        

01:39:19.282 --> 01:39:23.150
AND WE NOTICED THAT 25 PERCENT  
OF THOSE THAT FIVE YEARS        
OF CRASHES COULD BE IMPACTED BY 

01:39:23.152 --> 01:39:23.884
OF THOSE THAT FIVE YEARS        
OF CRASHES COULD BE IMPACTED BY 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF QUICK

PROGRAMING AND NOW WE REALLY    
WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT LENS,    

01:39:42.505 --> 01:39:43.370
PROGRAMING AND NOW WE REALLY    
WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT LENS,    
LOOK BACK THROUGH THAT LENS     

01:39:43.372 --> 01:39:46.941
WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT LENS,    
LOOK BACK THROUGH THAT LENS
