00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:23.827
OF THESE CHANGES THAT OCCURRED. 
IT WAS REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE  
DID A COMPREHENSIVE POST COVID  

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:28.098
IT WAS REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE  
DID A COMPREHENSIVE POST COVID  
ANALYSIS OF THE PARKING SYSTEM. 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.099
DID A COMPREHENSIVE POST COVID  
ANALYSIS OF THE PARKING SYSTEM. 
SO THAT ENTAILED OUR TWENTY     

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.934
ANALYSIS OF THE PARKING SYSTEM. 
SO THAT ENTAILED OUR TWENTY     
YEAR MAINTENANCE PLAN.          

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:32.034
SO THAT ENTAILED OUR TWENTY     
YEAR MAINTENANCE PLAN.          
THIS IS A PLANNING AND          

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:34.670
YEAR MAINTENANCE PLAN.          
THIS IS A PLANNING AND          
BUDGETING TOOL.                 

00:04:34.672 --> 00:04:35.672
THIS IS A PLANNING AND          
BUDGETING TOOL.                 
WE HAVE ENGINEERS COME IN TO    

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:38.674
BUDGETING TOOL.                 
WE HAVE ENGINEERS COME IN TO    
ALL OF OUR PARKING FACILITIES.  

00:04:38.676 --> 00:04:39.676
WE HAVE ENGINEERS COME IN TO    
ALL OF OUR PARKING FACILITIES.  
THEY LOOK AT EVERYTHING TOP TO  

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:42.445
ALL OF OUR PARKING FACILITIES.  
THEY LOOK AT EVERYTHING TOP TO  
BOTTOM AND THEY BASICALLY       

00:04:42.447 --> 00:04:43.079
THEY LOOK AT EVERYTHING TOP TO  
BOTTOM AND THEY BASICALLY       
PRIORITIZE ALL OF OUR           

00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:43.780
BOTTOM AND THEY BASICALLY       
PRIORITIZE ALL OF OUR           
MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION     

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:46.949
PRIORITIZE ALL OF OUR           
MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION     
WORK OUT TWENTY YEARS AND THIS  

00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:47.717
MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION     
WORK OUT TWENTY YEARS AND THIS  
WAS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THIS 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.820
WORK OUT TWENTY YEARS AND THIS  
WAS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THIS 
YEAR BECAUSE IT DID COVER ALL   

00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:51.488
WAS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THIS 
YEAR BECAUSE IT DID COVER ALL   
OF THOSE DEFERRED EXPENSES.     

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.157
YEAR BECAUSE IT DID COVER ALL   
OF THOSE DEFERRED EXPENSES.     
SO WE NEED TO FACTOR THAT INTO  

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.624
OF THOSE DEFERRED EXPENSES.     
SO WE NEED TO FACTOR THAT INTO  
OUR PLANNING.                   

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:58.027
SO WE NEED TO FACTOR THAT INTO  
OUR PLANNING.                   
WE ALSO UNDERTOOK OUR UNDERWENT 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.829
OUR PLANNING.                   
WE ALSO UNDERTOOK OUR UNDERWENT 
A CURBSIDE MANAGEMENT STUDY.    

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.065
WE ALSO UNDERTOOK OUR UNDERWENT 
A CURBSIDE MANAGEMENT STUDY.    
WE&apos;RE EXPECTING A DELIVERABLE   

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:02.799
A CURBSIDE MANAGEMENT STUDY.    
WE&apos;RE EXPECTING A DELIVERABLE   
ON THAT PROBABLY WITHIN THE     

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:05.968
WE&apos;RE EXPECTING A DELIVERABLE   
ON THAT PROBABLY WITHIN THE     
NEXT MONTH AND THEN OF COURSE   

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.669
ON THAT PROBABLY WITHIN THE     
NEXT MONTH AND THEN OF COURSE   
THE PARKING RATE STUDY WHICH    

00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:13.143
NEXT MONTH AND THEN OF COURSE   
THE PARKING RATE STUDY WHICH    
WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT     

00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:28.724
                           .    
SO OUR FIRST STEP WITH THE      
PARKING RATE STUDY WAS TO       

00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:29.426
SO OUR FIRST STEP WITH THE      
PARKING RATE STUDY WAS TO       
IDENTIFY THE PRIORITIES OF THE  

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:29.960
PARKING RATE STUDY WAS TO       
IDENTIFY THE PRIORITIES OF THE  
PARKING SYSTEM.                 

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:30.660
IDENTIFY THE PRIORITIES OF THE  
PARKING SYSTEM.                 
I&apos;M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL 

00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:31.461

JUST SIMPLY NOT NEGOTIABLE.     

00:05:32.797 --> 00:05:33.396
TO POINT OUT TOO THAT WE&apos;RE     
JUST SIMPLY NOT NEGOTIABLE.     
WE HAVE TO OPERATE A            

00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:34.030
JUST SIMPLY NOT NEGOTIABLE.     
WE HAVE TO OPERATE A            
FINANCIALLY SOUND PARKING       

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:34.631
WE HAVE TO OPERATE A            
FINANCIALLY SOUND PARKING       
SYSTEM AND AGAIN THOSE PARKING  

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:35.165
FINANCIALLY SOUND PARKING       
SYSTEM AND AGAIN THOSE PARKING  
FEES MUST COVER OUR             

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:35.832
SYSTEM AND AGAIN THOSE PARKING

BEEN INCREASED SINCE ITS        
INCEPTION IN TWENTY SIX WE ALSO 

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:07.657
BEEN INCREASED SINCE ITS        
INCEPTION IN TWENTY SIX WE ALSO 
ARE MAKING SOME OPERATIONAL     

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.193
INCEPTION IN TWENTY SIX WE ALSO 
ARE MAKING SOME OPERATIONAL     
CHANGES ON THE FLAT RATE SIDE   

00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:11.161
ARE MAKING SOME OPERATIONAL     
CHANGES ON THE FLAT RATE SIDE   
SO RIGHT NOW WE OPERATE FLAT    

00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:14.431
CHANGES ON THE FLAT RATE SIDE   
SO RIGHT NOW WE OPERATE FLAT    
RATES AT AND ASHLEY AND LIBERTY 

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:15.298
SO RIGHT NOW WE OPERATE FLAT    
RATES AT AND ASHLEY AND LIBERTY 
SQUARE WE&apos;RE SHIFTING THAT FLAT 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.635
RATES AT AND ASHLEY AND LIBERTY 
SQUARE WE&apos;RE SHIFTING THAT FLAT 
RATE TO LIBRARY SO THE LIBRARY  

00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:22.272
SQUARE WE&apos;RE SHIFTING THAT FLAT 
RATE TO LIBRARY SO THE LIBRARY  
LANE FACILITY WILL HAVE A FIVE  

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:23.206
RATE TO LIBRARY SO THE LIBRARY  
LANE FACILITY WILL HAVE A FIVE  
DOLLAR FLAT RATE FROM THREE     

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.876
LANE FACILITY WILL HAVE A FIVE  
DOLLAR FLAT RATE FROM THREE     
P.M. TO SIX A.M. MONDAY THROUGH

00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:30.246
P.M. TO SIX A.M. MONDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY AND ALL DAY SATURDAY.    
AND THE REASON FOR THAT SHIFT   

00:07:30.248 --> 00:07:31.046
FRIDAY AND ALL DAY SATURDAY.    
AND THE REASON FOR THAT SHIFT   
IS BECAUSE THAT LIBRARY LANE    

00:07:31.048 --> 00:07:33.716
AND THE REASON FOR THAT SHIFT   
IS BECAUSE THAT LIBRARY LANE    
STRUCTURE IS CENTRALLY LOCATED  

00:07:33.718 --> 00:07:37.320
IS BECAUSE THAT LIBRARY LANE    
STRUCTURE IS CENTRALLY LOCATED  
AND IT HAS A LOT OF CAPACITY.   

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:38.054
STRUCTURE IS CENTRALLY LOCATED  
AND IT HAS A LOT OF CAPACITY.   
ANOTHER OPERATIONAL CHANGE      

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:41.624
AND IT HAS A LOT OF CAPACITY.   
ANOTHER OPERATIONAL CHANGE      
WE&apos;RE MAKING THE FIRST IN

PROPERTIES.                     

01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:37.523
