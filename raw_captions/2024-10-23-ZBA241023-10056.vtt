00:34:14.242 --> 00:34:17.677
TRYING TO BALANCE IN TERMS      
OF THAT BUILDING SPACE BETWEEN  
BETWEEN THOMPSON AND MAINARD IS 

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.947
OF THAT BUILDING SPACE BETWEEN  
BETWEEN THOMPSON AND MAINARD IS 
THE THE FRONTAGE OF THE OF THE  

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:25.818
BETWEEN THOMPSON AND MAINARD IS 
THE THE FRONTAGE OF THE OF THE  
PINBALL PIZZA WILL ALLOW BY     

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.521
THE THE FRONTAGE OF THE OF THE  
PINBALL PIZZA WILL ALLOW BY     
CODE A VERY BIG SIGN.           

00:34:28.523 --> 00:34:29.789
PINBALL PIZZA WILL ALLOW BY     
CODE A VERY BIG SIGN.           
AND SO IF THE NEXT CAN ONLY     

00:34:29.791 --> 00:34:33.793
CODE A VERY BIG SIGN.           
AND SO IF THE NEXT CAN ONLY     
CONFORM TO WHAT THE CODE WILL   

00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:36.329
AND SO IF THE NEXT CAN ONLY     
CONFORM TO WHAT THE CODE WILL   
ALLOW, IT WILL CREATE A MUCH    

00:34:36.331 --> 00:34:36.896
CONFORM TO WHAT THE CODE WILL   
ALLOW, IT WILL CREATE A MUCH    
DIMINISHED SIGN.                

00:34:36.898 --> 00:34:37.764
ALLOW, IT WILL CREATE A MUCH    
DIMINISHED SIGN.                
SO THE ESTHETIC BALANCE         

00:34:37.766 --> 00:34:41.067
DIMINISHED SIGN.                
SO THE ESTHETIC BALANCE         
OF THOSE TWO SIDES WOULD BE     

00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.401
SO THE ESTHETIC BALANCE

OF THOSE TWO SIDES WOULD BE     
DISTORTED.                      
NOW OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE WILLING   

00:34:44.372 --> 00:34:45.138
DISTORTED.                      
NOW OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE WILLING   
TO WORK TOGETHER SO THAT SO     

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.408
NOW OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE WILLING   
TO WORK TOGETHER SO THAT SO     
THAT THERE'S AN ESTHETIC UNITY

THERE WAS A BIG NEON SIGN       
BECAUSE IN MY HEAD THAT THERE   

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:25.611
THERE WAS A BIG NEON SIGN       
BECAUSE IN MY HEAD THAT THERE   
IS LIKE A BIG SIGN BECAUSE

IS LIKE A BIG SIGN BECAUSE      
THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE IN   

00:40:28.716 --> 00:40:32.418
IS LIKE A BIG SIGN BECAUSE      
THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE IN   
SOME WAYS AND IT DOES HAVE A    

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.988
THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE IN   
SOME WAYS AND IT DOES HAVE A    
VERY SMALL FRONTAGE WHICH I     

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.823
SOME WAYS AND IT DOES HAVE A    
VERY SMALL FRONTAGE WHICH I     
THINK IS REALLY WHAT'S SETTING  

00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:37.156
VERY SMALL FRONTAGE WHICH I     
THINK IS REALLY WHAT'S SETTING  
THIS OFF.                       

00:40:37.158 --> 00:40:39.759
THINK IS REALLY WHAT'S SETTING  
THIS OFF.                       
IF IT WERE IF YOU DID SQUARE    

00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:43.162

00:40:43.164 --> 00:40:44.096
IF IT WERE IF YOU DID SQUARE    
FOOTAGE OF THE INTERIOR THEN    
THE SIGN WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE.

THE SIGN WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE. 
BUT IT DOES HAVE A VERY SMALL   

00:40:46.934 --> 00:40:47.867
THE SIGN WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE. 
BUT IT DOES HAVE A VERY SMALL   
FRONTAGE SO I ACTUALLY CAN SEE  

00:40:47.869 --> 00:40:51.270
BUT IT DOES HAVE A VERY SMALL   
FRONTAGE SO I ACTUALLY CAN SEE  
WHY YOU WOULD NEED A BIGGER     

00:40:51.272 --> 00:40:54.874
FRONTAGE SO I ACTUALLY CAN SEE  
WHY YOU WOULD NEED A BIGGER     
SIGN AND SEVEN FEET IS REALLY   

00:40:54.876 --> 00:40:58.977
WHY YOU WOULD NEED A BIGGER

I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO ADD BUT   

01:11:07.386 --> 01:11:09.987
IT WAS THE DRIVEWAY AND JIM,    
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO ADD BUT   
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS    

01:11:09.989 --> 01:11:10.721
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO ADD BUT   
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS    
PROVIDING ADEQUATE SPACE FOR    

01:11:10.723 --> 01:11:11.422
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS    
PROVIDING ADEQUATE SPACE FOR    
DRIVEWAY ON THAT SIDE OF THE    

01:11:11.424 --> 01:11:14.458
PROVIDING ADEQUATE SPACE FOR    
DRIVEWAY ON THAT SIDE OF THE    
LOT AND THEN THE FIVE FEET AND  

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:18.162
DRIVEWAY ON THAT SIDE OF THE    
LOT AND THEN THE FIVE FEET AND  
YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO A POINT    

01:11:18.164 --> 01:11:18.830
LOT AND THEN THE FIVE FEET AND  
YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO A POINT    
WHERE THE THE BUILDING NO       

01:11:18.832 --> 01:11:21.732
YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO A POINT    
WHERE THE THE BUILDING NO       
LONGER HAS VIABLE LIVABLE       

01:11:21.734 --> 01:11:22.066
WHERE THE THE BUILDING NO       
LONGER HAS VIABLE LIVABLE       
WIDTH.                          

01:11:22.068 --> 01:11:25.603
LONGER HAS VIABLE LIVABLE       
WIDTH.                          
SO YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE    

01:11:25.605 --> 01:11:26.470
WIDTH.                          
SO YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE    
AFTER THOUGH THE FIVE FEET ON   

01:11:26.472 --> 01:11:27.137
SO YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE    
AFTER THOUGH THE FIVE FEET ON   
THE ONE SIDE THAT MATCHED THE   

01:11:27.139 --> 01:11:28.405
AFTER THOUGH THE FIVE FEET ON   
THE ONE SIDE THAT MATCHED THE   
ADJACENT AND THEN DRIVEWAY ON   

01:11:28.407 --> 01:11:32.610
THE ONE SIDE THAT MATCHED THE   
ADJACENT AND THEN DRIVEWAY ON   
THE OTHER.                      

01:11:32.612 --> 01:11:35.712
ADJACENT AND THEN DRIVEWAY ON   
THE OTHER.                      
OK, THANK YOU DAVE.             

01:11:35.714 --> 01:11:40.150

BUILDING JUST BE MOVED OVER TO  

01:11:43.956 --> 01:11:44.588
SO YEAH IF I COULDN'T THIS NEW  
BUILDING JUST BE MOVED OVER TO  
THE MIDDLE THERE BECAUSE        

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:47.824
BUILDING JUST BE MOVED OVER TO  
THE MIDDLE THERE BECAUSE        
THEY'RE NOT REALLY THERE ONE    

01:11:47.826 --> 01:11:48.192
THE MIDDLE THERE BECAUSE        
THEY'RE NOT REALLY THERE ONE    
PARCEL RIGHT.                   

01:11:48.194 --> 01:11:49.126
THEY'RE NOT REALLY THERE ONE    
PARCEL RIGHT.                   
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONSIDER   

01:11:49.128 --> 01:11:52.029
PARCEL RIGHT.                   
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONSIDER   
THE SETBACK BETWEEN THE TWO     

01:11:52.031 --> 01:11:55.633
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONSIDER   
THE SETBACK BETWEEN THE TWO     
BUILDINGS ON THIS SINGLE PARCEL 

01:11:55.635 --> 01:11:56.901
THE SETBACK BETWEEN THE TWO     
BUILDINGS ON THIS SINGLE PARCEL 
SO IT COULD ALMOST BE LIKE A    

01:11:56.903 --> 01:12:00.037
BUILDINGS ON THIS SINGLE PARCEL 
SO IT COULD ALMOST BE LIKE A    
DUPLEX AND ATTACHED DUPLEX      

01:12:00.039 --> 01:12:00.871
SO IT COULD ALMOST BE LIKE A    
DUPLEX AND ATTACHED DUPLEX      
ALMOST OR YOU COULD HAVE SPACE  

01:12:00.873 --> 01:12:03.373
DUPLEX AND ATTACHED DUPLEX      
ALMOST OR YOU COULD HAVE SPACE  
BETWEEN THEM AND THEN HAVE THE  

01:12:03.375 --> 01:12:07.244
ALMOST OR YOU COULD HAVE SPACE  
BETWEEN THEM AND THEN HAVE THE  
DRIVEWAY IN THAT AREA TO THE    

01:12:07.246 --> 01:12:08.012
BETWEEN THEM AND THEN HAVE THE  
DRIVEWAY IN THAT AREA TO THE    
EAST AND MEET THE SETBACK       

01:12:08.014 --> 01:12:13.985
DRIVEWAY IN THAT AREA TO THE    
EAST AND MEET THE SETBACK       
REQUIREMENTS                    

01:12:14.653 --> 01:12:18.856

DO THAT.                        

01:12:18.858 --> 01:12:19.590
SURE THERE'S SPACE IN THERE TO

THAT GOT US TO THE TO THE BACK  
THE BACK PART OF THE LOT        

01:12:36.608 --> 01:12:40.110

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:52.056
SO THERE IS NO WORRY ABOUT ANY  
SETBACK OR ANYTHING AT THAT THE 
FICTIONAL MIDDLE LINE WHICH YOU 

01:12:52.058 --> 01:12:55.726
SETBACK OR ANYTHING AT THAT THE

01:12:55.728 --> 01:12:59.330
FICTIONAL MIDDLE LINE WHICH YOU 
WANT ONE TIME WAS THE DIVIDING  
LINE BETWEEN TWO LOTS BECAUSE   

01:12:59.332 --> 01:13:02.033
WANT ONE TIME WAS THE DIVIDING  
LINE BETWEEN TWO LOTS BECAUSE   
THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.     

01:13:02.035 --> 01:13:02.833
LINE BETWEEN TWO LOTS BECAUSE   
THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.
