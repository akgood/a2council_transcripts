SO REDESIGNING IT TO SLOW DOWN  

00:20:29.153 --> 00:20:30.118
RATHER THAN AN INTERSECTION.    
SO REDESIGNING IT TO SLOW DOWN  
SPEEDS WILL BENEFIT ME BUT IT

01:00:44.165 --> 01:00:45.098
WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR         
FINALIZING THE DESIGN?          
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS ONCE  

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.067
FINALIZING THE DESIGN?          
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS ONCE  
THE ADDITIONAL CONCEPTS THAT WE 

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.835
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS ONCE  
THE ADDITIONAL CONCEPTS THAT WE 
ARE LOOKING AT ARE ANALYZED,    

01:00:48.837 --> 01:00:49.402
