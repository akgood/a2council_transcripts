IT'S REALLY HARD TO CLEAR RAMPS 
SO THIS IS REALLY THE REASON WE 
WE LOOKED TO CHANGE.            

00:27:06.557 --> 00:27:07.356
SO THIS IS REALLY THE REASON WE 
WE LOOKED TO CHANGE.            
HERE'S ANOTHER LOCATION WHERE

00:27:30.914 --> 00:27:31.646
FEET OF SNOW OR A PEDESTRIAN

BECAUSE NOBODY'S RESPONSIBLE

WOULD HAVE TO CROSS THAT        
BECAUSE NOBODY'S RESPONSIBLE

OK, THANKS FOR THAT ANSWER.     

01:13:57.064 --> 01:13:57.830
THE FUTURE.                     
OK, THANKS FOR THAT ANSWER.     
I GUESS THE OTHER THING I'D     

01:13:57.832 --> 01:14:00.699
OK, THANKS FOR THAT ANSWER.     
I GUESS THE OTHER THING I'D     
LIKE TO OBSERVE IS THAT THE     

01:14:00.701 --> 01:14:04.169
I GUESS THE OTHER THING I'D     
LIKE TO OBSERVE IS THAT THE     
PLIMOTH THE LIMITS OF THE       

01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:05.203
LIKE TO OBSERVE IS THAT THE     
PLIMOTH THE LIMITS OF THE       
PLIMOTH CORRIDOR DO NOT EXTEND  

01:14:05.205 --> 01:14:09.008
PLIMOTH THE LIMITS OF THE       
PLIMOTH CORRIDOR DO NOT EXTEND  
EAST OF GREEN WHICH IS WHERE WE 

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:12.879
PLIMOTH CORRIDOR DO NOT EXTEND  
EAST OF GREEN WHICH IS WHERE WE 
HAD A FATAL CRASH IN MARCH AND  

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:16.748
EAST OF GREEN WHICH IS WHERE WE 
HAD A FATAL CRASH IN MARCH AND  
WHERE I ROUTINELY SEE PEOPLE    

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:19.585
HAD A FATAL CRASH IN MARCH AND  
WHERE I ROUTINELY SEE PEOPLE    
CROSSING WITHOUT A CROSSWALK.   

01:14:19.587 --> 01:14:23.188
WHERE I ROUTINELY SEE PEOPLE    
CROSSING WITHOUT A CROSSWALK.   
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S LIKE ONE 

01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:24.189
CROSSING WITHOUT A CROSSWALK.   
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S LIKE ONE 
THE ONE OF THE MORE CRITICAL    

01:14:24.191 --> 01:14:27.593
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S LIKE ONE 
THE ONE OF THE MORE CRITICAL    
PLACES ON PLYMOUTH THAT NEEDS   

01:14:27.595 --> 01:14:28.560
THE ONE OF THE MORE CRITICAL    
PLACES ON PLYMOUTH THAT NEEDS   
TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S NOT IN 

01:14:28.562 --> 01:14:28.961
PLACES ON PLYMOUTH THAT NEEDS   
TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S NOT IN 
THE SCOPE.                      

01:14:28.963 --> 01:14:32.231
TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S NOT IN 
THE SCOPE.                      
SO I WOULD LIKE TO URGE US TO   

01:14:32.233 --> 01:14:35.568
THE SCOPE.                      
SO I WOULD LIKE TO URGE US TO   
EXPAND THE SCOPE TO A LITTLE    

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:36.369
SO I WOULD LIKE TO URGE US TO   
EXPAND THE SCOPE TO A LITTLE    
BIT FURTHER EAST ON PLYMOUTH.   

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:38.538
EXPAND THE SCOPE TO A LITTLE    
BIT FURTHER EAST ON PLYMOUTH.   
>> THANK YOU.                   

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.638
BIT FURTHER EAST ON PLYMOUTH.
