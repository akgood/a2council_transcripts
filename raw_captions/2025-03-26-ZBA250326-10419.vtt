OCCASIONALLY BUT YEAH WE HAD A  
SIMILAR APPLICATION LAST MONTH  
WHERE IT JUST MADE MOST SENSE

SIMILAR APPLICATION LAST MONTH  
WHERE IT JUST MADE MOST SENSE   
FOR THE SCIENCE TO FIT WITHIN   

00:29:44.528 --> 00:29:47.529
WHERE IT JUST MADE MOST SENSE   
FOR THE SCIENCE TO FIT WITHIN   
THE HORIZONTAL BANDS.           

00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:47.862
FOR THE SCIENCE TO FIT WITHIN   
THE HORIZONTAL BANDS.

00:29:47.864 --> 00:29:48.930
THE HORIZONTAL BANDS.           
RIGHT.                          
IT WAS HARD TO TELL FROM THAT   

00:29:48.932 --> 00:29:49.664
RIGHT.                          
IT WAS HARD TO TELL FROM THAT   
ONE PHOTOGRAPH BECAUSE IF THEY  

00:29:49.666 --> 00:29:51.800
IT WAS HARD TO TELL FROM THAT   
ONE PHOTOGRAPH BECAUSE IF THEY  
DROPPED IT LOWER THEN IT WOULD  

00:29:51.802 --> 00:29:52.534
ONE PHOTOGRAPH BECAUSE IF THEY  
DROPPED IT LOWER THEN IT WOULD

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:55.904
DROPPED IT LOWER THEN IT WOULD  
OVERLAP IN AN AWKWARD POSITION. 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE

THE MAXIMUM THAT YOU CAN GET    
AWAY WITH.                      

00:34:15.331 --> 00:34:16.731
THE MAXIMUM THAT YOU CAN GET    
AWAY WITH.                      
AND YOU KNOW, FOR THAT REASON I 

00:34:16.733 --> 00:34:20.735
AWAY WITH.                      
AND YOU KNOW, FOR THAT REASON I 
BELIEVE THEY COULD PUT THAT     

00:34:20.737 --> 00:34:21.135
AND YOU KNOW, FOR THAT REASON I 
BELIEVE THEY COULD PUT THAT     
SIDE LOWER.                     

00:34:21.137 --> 00:34:24.338
BELIEVE THEY COULD PUT THAT     
SIDE LOWER.                     
THEY MIGHT STILL NEED A         

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:24.672
SIDE LOWER.                     
THEY MIGHT STILL NEED A         
VARIANCE.                       

00:34:24.674 --> 00:34:25.540
THEY MIGHT STILL NEED A         
VARIANCE.                       
I'M NOT SURE BUT THEY CERTAINLY 

00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:28.309
VARIANCE.                       
I'M NOT SURE BUT THEY CERTAINLY 
DON'T NEED THE NEED FOR PARENTS 

00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:32.414
I'M NOT SURE BUT THEY CERTAINLY 
DON'T NEED THE NEED FOR PARENTS 
PAY FOR THE SERVICE.            

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:33.481
DON'T NEED THE NEED FOR PARENTS 
PAY FOR THE SERVICE.            
DO YOU THINK THERE IS SOME      

00:34:33.483 --> 00:34:36.384
PAY FOR THE SERVICE.            
DO YOU THINK THERE IS SOME      
VALUE FOR THAT RIVER, THAT SIDE 

00:34:36.386 --> 00:34:39.620
DO YOU THINK THERE IS SOME      
VALUE FOR THAT RIVER, THAT SIDE 
OF PARTY?                       

00:34:39.622 --> 00:34:40.855
VALUE FOR THAT RIVER, THAT SIDE 
OF PARTY?                       
THERE IS A LINE OF TREES THAT   

00:34:40.857 --> 00:34:43.524
OF PARTY?                       
THERE IS A LINE OF TREES THAT   
WOULD NEED TO BE PUT ASIDE.     

00:34:43.526 --> 00:34:47.495
THERE IS A LINE OF TREES THAT   
WOULD NEED TO BE PUT ASIDE.     
AND SO IN MY MIND IF YOU RAISE  

00:34:47.497 --> 00:34:48.763
WOULD NEED TO BE PUT ASIDE.     
AND SO IN MY MIND IF YOU RAISE  
THE SIGN UP YOU COULD THEN SEE  

00:34:48.765 --> 00:34:49.497
AND SO IN MY MIND IF YOU RAISE  
THE SIGN UP YOU COULD THEN SEE  
OVERFLIGHTS SUBSET OF TREES     

00:34:49.499 --> 00:34:51.732
THE SIGN UP YOU COULD THEN SEE  
OVERFLIGHTS SUBSET OF TREES     
WHITE OR ANY OTHER SIDE OF THE  

00:34:51.734 --> 00:34:52.500
OVERFLIGHTS SUBSET OF TREES     
WHITE OR ANY OTHER SIDE OF THE  
PARKING LOT BECAUSE THE PARKING 

00:34:52.502 --> 00:34:58.907
WHITE OR ANY OTHER SIDE OF THE  
PARKING LOT BECAUSE THE PARKING 
LOT ETHNOLOGIST IS EXPENSIVE    

00:34:59.041 --> 00:35:06.348
                            .   
I AM STRUGGLING WITH THIS       
BECAUSE I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES.   

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.349
I AM STRUGGLING WITH THIS       
BECAUSE I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES.   
I AGREE THAT THESE BUILDINGS    

00:35:07.351 --> 00:35:10.484
BECAUSE I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES.   
I AGREE THAT THESE BUILDINGS    
BEING EXISTING BUILDINGS I      

00:35:10.486 --> 00:35:11.285
I AGREE THAT THESE BUILDINGS    
BEING EXISTING BUILDINGS I      
THINK WERE DESIGNED TO HAVE THE 

00:35:11.287 --> 00:35:14.588
BEING EXISTING BUILDINGS I      
THINK WERE DESIGNED TO HAVE THE 
SIGNS IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY  

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.590
THINK WERE DESIGNED TO HAVE THE 
SIGNS IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY  
EXIST ON MANY OF THE EXISTING

EXIST ON MANY OF THE EXISTING

BEING PROPOSED ON THIS ONE.     
DO I THINK IT MIGHT LOOK A      

00:35:22.899 --> 00:35:23.665
BEING PROPOSED ON THIS ONE.     
DO I THINK IT MIGHT LOOK A      
LITTLE BIT ODD TO BRING IT      

00:35:23.667 --> 00:35:29.537
DO I THINK IT MIGHT LOOK A      
LITTLE BIT ODD TO BRING IT      
LOWER PERHAPS THAT SAID, I      

00:35:29.539 --> 00:35:30.304
LITTLE BIT ODD TO BRING IT      
LOWER PERHAPS THAT SAID, I      
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A REAL  

00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:33.308
LOWER PERHAPS THAT SAID, I      
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A REAL  
HARDSHIP IN THIS OTHER THAN

HARDSHIP IN THIS OTHER THAN     
THEY WANT TO SIGN HIGHER FOR    
VISIBILITY PURPOSES THEM HAVING 

00:35:37.647 --> 00:35:38.346
THEY WANT TO SIGN HIGHER FOR    
VISIBILITY PURPOSES THEM HAVING 
A LOWER SIGN THEY COULD STILL   

00:35:38.348 --> 00:35:44.686
VISIBILITY PURPOSES THEM HAVING 
A LOWER SIGN THEY COULD STILL   
HAVE A SIGN                     

00:35:45.154 --> 00:35:52.927
            AND UNLIKE SOME     
OF THE OTHER APPLICATIONS THAT  
WE'VE SEEN WHERE A LOWER SIGN

RIGHT.                          
SO AS YOU PULL IN AND THEN      
THERE'S A STOP SIGN TO YOUR

SO AS YOU PULL IN AND THEN      
THERE'S A STOP SIGN TO YOUR     
LEFT IS STARBUCKS AND SOME

LEFT IS STARBUCKS AND SOME      
OTHER STORES.                   
SO THESE STORES ARE VERY        

00:36:47.617 --> 00:36:47.915
OTHER STORES.                   
SO THESE STORES ARE VERY        
VISIBLE.                        

00:36:47.917 --> 00:36:50.852
SO THESE STORES ARE VERY        
VISIBLE.                        
THEY'RE THE VERY FIRST OR AS    

00:36:50.854 --> 00:36:51.786
VISIBLE.                        
THEY'RE THE VERY FIRST OR AS    
YOU SEE IT AFTER LAND FAR IN    

00:36:51.788 --> 00:36:54.956
THEY'RE THE VERY FIRST OR AS    
YOU SEE IT AFTER LAND FAR IN    
THE DISTANCE TO THE NORTH ARE   

00:36:54.958 --> 00:36:55.689
YOU SEE IT AFTER LAND FAR IN    
THE DISTANCE TO THE NORTH ARE   
MARTIAL'S AND HOME-MADE AND     

00:36:55.691 --> 00:36:58.493
THE DISTANCE TO THE NORTH ARE   
MARTIAL'S AND HOME-MADE AND     
VALLEY AND ALL THOSE OTHER      

00:36:58.495 --> 00:36:59.227
MARTIAL'S AND HOME-MADE AND     
VALLEY AND ALL THOSE OTHER      
STORES AND THEY ARE PARTIALLY   

00:36:59.229 --> 00:37:02.263
VALLEY AND ALL THOSE OTHER      
STORES AND THEY ARE PARTIALLY   
BLOCKED BY THE TREES AND I      

00:37:02.265 --> 00:37:03.030
STORES AND THEY ARE PARTIALLY   
BLOCKED BY THE TREES AND I      
POINT IN SAYING THIS IS THAT    

00:37:03.032 --> 00:37:06.667
BLOCKED BY THE TREES AND I      
POINT IN SAYING THIS IS THAT    
OFFICEMAX IN THE SKETCHERS      

00:37:06.669 --> 00:37:07.401
POINT IN SAYING THIS IS THAT    
OFFICEMAX IN THE SKETCHERS      
STORE DON'T HAVE THE SAME       

00:37:07.403 --> 00:37:10.538
OFFICEMAX IN THE SKETCHERS      
STORE DON'T HAVE THE SAME       
VISIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ONES   

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.739
STORE DON'T HAVE THE SAME       
VISIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ONES   
DO AND THE LARGE ROW OF STORES  

00:37:11.741 --> 00:37:14.909
VISIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ONES   
DO AND THE LARGE ROW OF STORES  
TO THE NORTH OF OUR LAND.       

00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:15.844
DO AND THE LARGE ROW OF STORES  
TO THE NORTH OF OUR LAND.       
WHY SO VISIBILITY REALLY        

00:37:15.846 --> 00:37:18.212
TO THE NORTH OF OUR LAND.       
WHY SO VISIBILITY REALLY        
WOULDN'T BE HURT BY SMALLER     

00:37:18.214 --> 00:37:18.513
WHY SO VISIBILITY REALLY        
WOULDN'T BE HURT BY SMALLER     
LETTERS.                        

00:37:18.515 --> 00:37:22.583
WOULDN'T BE HURT BY SMALLER

00:37:26.556 --> 00:37:27.755
MANAGES TO EAT THERE ON A       
REGULAR BASIS AND NOT GET LOST. 
>> SO I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING  

00:37:27.757 --> 00:37:30.591
REGULAR BASIS AND NOT GET LOST. 
>> SO I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING  
TO IMPACT THE FLOW OF FOOT

TRAFFIC OR CAR TRAFFIC TO       
SKETCHERS.                      
THEY DID HAVE A SMALL SIDE AND  

00:37:34.998 --> 00:37:37.998
SKETCHERS.                      
THEY DID HAVE A SMALL SIDE AND  
I DO LIKE DAVE'S COMMENT THAT   

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.869
THEY DID HAVE A SMALL SIDE AND  
I DO LIKE DAVE'S COMMENT THAT   
THIS IS THE MAXIMUM THEY CAN DO 

00:37:41.871 --> 00:37:45.840
I DO LIKE DAVE'S COMMENT THAT   
THIS IS THE MAXIMUM THEY CAN DO 
BUT THEY COULD VERY WELL COMPLY 

00:37:45.842 --> 00:37:46.674
THIS IS THE MAXIMUM THEY CAN DO 
BUT THEY COULD VERY WELL COMPLY 
WITH THE ORDINANCE I THINK BY   

00:37:46.676 --> 00:37:50.110
BUT THEY COULD VERY WELL COMPLY 
WITH THE ORDINANCE I THINK BY   
LOWERING THE LETTERS AND HAVING 

00:37:50.112 --> 00:37:50.845
WITH THE ORDINANCE I THINK BY   
LOWERING THE LETTERS AND HAVING 
SMALLER LETTERS AND IT WOULD    

00:37:50.847 --> 00:37:53.948
LOWERING THE LETTERS AND HAVING 
SMALLER LETTERS AND IT WOULD    
NOT IMPACT THE VISIBILITY       

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:54.415
SMALLER LETTERS AND IT WOULD    
NOT IMPACT THE VISIBILITY       
OF THE STORE.                   

00:37:54.417 --> 00:37:55.449
NOT IMPACT THE VISIBILITY       
OF THE STORE.
