THAT I HEARD WAS AROUND THE     
TREES THAT ARE COMING OFF       

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:21.470
THAT I HEARD WAS AROUND THE     
TREES THAT ARE COMING OFF       
BECAUSE THE TREES CREATE FOR    

00:21:21.472 --> 00:21:24.340
TREES THAT ARE COMING OFF       
BECAUSE THE TREES CREATE FOR    
THOSE RESIDENTS WHETHER IT&amp;apos;S

CLEAR ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE

I THINK THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED   

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:38.320

ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT     
OF THEM.                        
SO HOW ARE THEY PLANNING TO     

00:21:47.965 --> 00:21:48.764

SO HOW ARE THEY PLANNING TO     
MITIGATE THAT AND THAT&amp;apos;S        

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:49.431
SO HOW ARE THEY PLANNING TO     
MITIGATE THAT AND THAT&amp;apos;S        
IMPORTANT BECAUSE COUNSEL JUST  

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:52.401
MITIGATE THAT AND THAT&amp;apos;S        
IMPORTANT BECAUSE COUNSEL JUST  
HAD A CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT   

00:21:52.403 --> 00:21:53.335
IMPORTANT BECAUSE COUNSEL JUST  
HAD A CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT

ONE HUNDRED DECIBELS MAINTAINED 

00:21:59.977 --> 00:22:00.910
OF END 14 AT A LEVEL OF ABOUT   
ONE HUNDRED DECIBELS MAINTAINED 
WHICH IS A LEVEL THAT CAN       

00:22:00.912 --> 00:22:03.311
ONE HUNDRED DECIBELS MAINTAINED 
WHICH IS A LEVEL THAT CAN       
CREATE SUSTAINED HEARING LOSS.  

00:22:03.313 --> 00:22:07.215
WHICH IS A LEVEL THAT CAN       
CREATE SUSTAINED HEARING LOSS.  
SO HOW DOES THAT ALL FACTOR IN  

00:22:07.217 --> 00:22:07.449
CREATE SUSTAINED HEARING LOSS.  
SO HOW DOES THAT ALL FACTOR IN  
?                               

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.250
SO HOW DOES THAT ALL FACTOR IN

IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS IN

I DON&amp;apos;T I CAN&amp;apos;T SPEAK           
AUTHORITATIVELY.

00:24:21.985 --> 00:24:25.053
AUTHORITATIVELY.                
I DOUBT THAT DECIDUOUS TREES    
PROVIDE MUCH SOUND BARRIER.     

00:24:25.055 --> 00:24:26.321
I DOUBT THAT DECIDUOUS TREES    
PROVIDE MUCH SOUND BARRIER.     
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IN MY OWN 

00:24:26.323 --> 00:24:29.390
PROVIDE MUCH SOUND BARRIER.     
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IN MY OWN

WOULDN&amp;apos;T NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE  
BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER.      

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.167
WOULDN&amp;apos;T NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE  
BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER.      
THERE WERE A LOT OF TREES SO A  

00:24:38.169 --> 00:24:40.936
BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER.      
THERE WERE A LOT OF TREES SO A

00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:44.807
THERE WERE A LOT OF TREES SO A  
LOT MORE THAN WHAT THESE ARE.   
SO PERHAPS SOME EVERGREENS      

00:24:44.809 --> 00:24:45.941
LOT MORE THAN WHAT THESE ARE.   
SO PERHAPS SOME EVERGREENS      
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN 

00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:48.811
SO PERHAPS SOME EVERGREENS

THAT REGARD JUST BECAUSE        

00:24:48.813 --> 00:24:49.778
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN 
THAT REGARD JUST BECAUSE        
THEY&amp;apos;RE ON YOU KNOW THEY&amp;apos;RE NOT

ADDRESS THIS IN SOME OF OUR     

00:45:38.528 --> 00:45:41.062
CLOSE OR LEAVE CHIP, WE DID     
ADDRESS THIS IN SOME OF OUR     
INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS AND SO   

00:45:41.064 --> 00:45:42.129
ADDRESS THIS IN SOME OF OUR     
INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS AND SO   
WE WILL BE CREATING SOME        

00:45:42.131 --> 00:45:44.732
INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS AND SO   
WE WILL BE CREATING SOME        
NONCONFORMIST WITH REZONING.    

00:45:44.734 --> 00:45:45.599
WE WILL BE CREATING SOME        
NONCONFORMIST WITH REZONING.    
THERE ARE THREE KINDS           

00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:46.099
NONCONFORMIST WITH REZONING.    
THERE ARE THREE KINDS           
OF NONCONFORMITY.               

00:45:46.101 --> 00:45:48.736
THERE ARE THREE KINDS           
OF NONCONFORMITY.               
THERE IS A NONCONFORMING LOT    

00:45:48.738 --> 00:45:52.806
OF NONCONFORMITY.               
THERE IS A NONCONFORMING LOT    
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE AND A   

00:45:52.808 --> 00:45:53.374
THERE IS A NONCONFORMING LOT    
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE AND A   
NONCONFORMING USE.              

00:45:53.376 --> 00:45:56.410
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE AND A   
NONCONFORMING USE.              
WE WILL NOT BE CREATING ANY     

00:45:56.412 --> 00:45:57.144
NONCONFORMING USE.              
WE WILL NOT BE CREATING ANY     
NONCONFORMING LOCKS BECAUSE THE 

00:45:57.146 --> 00:46:00.647
WE WILL NOT BE CREATING ANY     
NONCONFORMING LOCKS BECAUSE THE 
MINIMUM LOCK SIZE IS ZERO.      

00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:01.515
NONCONFORMING LOCKS BECAUSE THE 
MINIMUM LOCK SIZE IS ZERO.      
SO EVERYTHING QUALIFIES.        

00:46:01.517 --> 00:46:04.618
MINIMUM LOCK SIZE IS ZERO.      
SO EVERYTHING QUALIFIES.        
WE MAY BE CREATING SOME         

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.385
SO EVERYTHING QUALIFIES.        
WE MAY BE CREATING SOME         
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND    

00:46:05.387 --> 00:46:06.086
WE MAY BE CREATING SOME         
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND    
THE DEFINITION OF THAT IS IF    

00:46:06.088 --> 00:46:08.189
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND    
THE DEFINITION OF THAT IS IF    
THE STRUCTURE DOESN&amp;apos;T MEET THE  

00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:08.989
THE DEFINITION OF THAT IS IF    
THE STRUCTURE DOESN&amp;apos;T MEET THE  
SET BACK OR THE HEIGHT          

00:46:08.991 --> 00:46:11.759
THE STRUCTURE DOESN&amp;apos;T MEET THE  
SET BACK OR THE HEIGHT          
REQUIREMENT.                    

00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:16.096
SET BACK OR THE HEIGHT          
REQUIREMENT.                    
SO UPON ZONING A ONE STOREY     

00:46:16.098 --> 00:46:16.830
REQUIREMENT.                    
SO UPON ZONING A ONE STOREY     
BUILDING WOULD BE NONCONFORMING 

00:46:16.832 --> 00:46:20.167
SO UPON ZONING A ONE STOREY     
BUILDING WOULD BE NONCONFORMING 
AND A BUILDING THAT IS PERHAPS  

00:46:20.169 --> 00:46:20.868
BUILDING WOULD BE NONCONFORMING 
AND A BUILDING THAT IS PERHAPS  
TOO FAR BACK WOULD BE           

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:24.037
AND A BUILDING THAT IS PERHAPS  
TOO FAR BACK WOULD BE           
NONCONFORMING BUILDING AND A    

00:46:24.039 --> 00:46:24.772
TOO FAR BACK WOULD BE           
NONCONFORMING BUILDING AND A    
THIRD KIND OF NONCONFORMITY IS  

00:46:24.774 --> 00:46:27.774
NONCONFORMING BUILDING AND A    
THIRD KIND OF NONCONFORMITY IS  
NOT CONFORMING USE.             

00:46:27.776 --> 00:46:28.842
THIRD KIND OF NONCONFORMITY IS  
NOT CONFORMING USE.             
WE ALSO WILL BE CREATING SOME   

00:46:28.844 --> 00:46:32.079
NOT CONFORMING USE.             
WE ALSO WILL BE CREATING SOME   
NONCONFORMING USES OF THE TOP   

00:46:32.081 --> 00:46:32.813
WE ALSO WILL BE CREATING SOME   
NONCONFORMING USES OF THE TOP   
OF MY HEAD GAS STATIONS OR      

00:46:32.815 --> 00:46:33.414
NONCONFORMING USES OF THE TOP   
OF MY HEAD GAS STATIONS OR      
OFFICIALLY CALLED FUELING       

00:46:33.416 --> 00:46:36.183
OF MY HEAD GAS STATIONS OR      
OFFICIALLY CALLED FUELING       
STATIONS WOULD BECOME           

00:46:36.185 --> 00:46:36.917
OFFICIALLY CALLED FUELING       
STATIONS WOULD BECOME           
NONCONFORMING BECAUSE THEY ARE  

00:46:36.919 --> 00:46:38.785
STATIONS WOULD BECOME           
NONCONFORMING BECAUSE THEY ARE  
NOT PERMITTED USE IN THE U.S.   

00:46:38.787 --> 00:46:39.186
NONCONFORMING BECAUSE THEY ARE  
NOT PERMITTED USE IN THE U.S.

WE DECIDED NOT TO WANT TO LIST  
THREE WAYS YOU CAN GET          
AFFORDABILITY AND ONE WAY YOU   

02:14:41.598 --> 02:14:43.732
THREE WAYS YOU CAN GET          
AFFORDABILITY AND ONE WAY YOU   
CANNOT.

AFFORDABILITY AND ONE WAY YOU   
CANNOT.                         
ONE WAY IS THROUGH LOCATION.

CANNOT.                         
ONE WAY IS THROUGH LOCATION.    
ANOTHER WAY IS THROUGH          

02:14:48.572 --> 02:14:51.173
ONE WAY IS THROUGH LOCATION.    
ANOTHER WAY IS THROUGH          
MULTIFAMILY HOUSING AND IT&amp;apos;S    

02:14:51.175 --> 02:14:52.040
ANOTHER WAY IS THROUGH          
MULTIFAMILY HOUSING AND IT&amp;apos;S    
BEST WHEN YOU COMBINE THOSE TWO 

02:14:52.042 --> 02:14:55.411
MULTIFAMILY HOUSING AND IT&amp;apos;S    
BEST WHEN YOU COMBINE THOSE TWO 
THE THIRD WAY IS TO BUILD MORE

BEST WHEN YOU COMBINE THOSE TWO 
THE THIRD WAY IS TO BUILD MORE  
HOUSING THE HOUSING THAT WAS    

02:14:56.146 --> 02:14:59.047
THE THIRD WAY IS TO BUILD MORE  
HOUSING THE HOUSING THAT WAS    
BUILT A DECADE AROUND TWENTY    

02:14:59.049 --> 02:15:00.081
HOUSING THE HOUSING THAT WAS    
BUILT A DECADE AROUND TWENTY    
TEN AS LUXURY HOUSING IS MORE

TEN AS LUXURY HOUSING IS MORE   
AFFORDABLE THAN WHAT&amp;apos;S BEEN

TEN AS LUXURY HOUSING IS MORE   
AFFORDABLE THAN WHAT&amp;apos;S BEEN     
BUILT SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN.    

02:15:04.154 --> 02:15:06.788
AFFORDABLE THAN WHAT&amp;apos;S BEEN     
BUILT SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN.    
THE PRICES OF THAT HOUSING WAS  

02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:07.723
BUILT SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN.    
THE PRICES OF THAT HOUSING WAS  
BUILT IN TWENTY TEN FALLS AS

THE PRICES OF THAT HOUSING WAS  
BUILT IN TWENTY TEN FALLS AS    
THE NEWER MORE MORE AMENITIES

SO THOUGH YOU CANNOT REQUIRE    
DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE IT, YOU   

02:15:35.319 --> 02:15:37.986
SO THOUGH YOU CANNOT REQUIRE    
DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE IT, YOU   
CAN TRADE THEM FOR IT.

I DON&amp;apos;T BELIEVE SO.             
T SEE ONE AS A VERY GOOD JOB    
WITH THE FIRST THREE WAYS YOU   

02:16:01.311 --> 02:16:02.010
T SEE ONE AS A VERY GOOD JOB    
WITH THE FIRST THREE WAYS YOU

MULTIFAMILY BUILD MORE HOUSING. 
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK WE NEED TO BUILD  

02:16:06.650 --> 02:16:09.818
MULTIFAMILY BUILD MORE HOUSING. 
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK WE NEED TO BUILD  
A DENSITY PREMIUM IN BUT HOW    

02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:10.452
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK WE NEED TO BUILD  
A DENSITY PREMIUM IN BUT HOW    
ABOUT WRITING SOMETHING INTO    

02:16:10.454 --> 02:16:13.455
A DENSITY PREMIUM IN BUT HOW    
ABOUT WRITING SOMETHING INTO    
THE ORDINANCE FOR ADDITIONAL    

02:16:13.457 --> 02:16:14.156
ABOUT WRITING SOMETHING INTO    
THE ORDINANCE FOR ADDITIONAL    
DENSITY AS A PREMIUM FOR        

02:16:14.158 --> 02:16:17.492
THE ORDINANCE FOR ADDITIONAL    
DENSITY AS A PREMIUM FOR        
ELECTRIFICATION ALSO A GOOD     

02:16:17.494 --> 02:16:18.159
DENSITY AS A PREMIUM FOR        
ELECTRIFICATION ALSO A GOOD     
QUESTION ALSO SOMETHING WE      

02:16:18.161 --> 02:16:18.894
ELECTRIFICATION ALSO A GOOD     
QUESTION ALSO SOMETHING WE      
CONSIDERED ALSO SOMETHING WE    

02:16:18.896 --> 02:16:21.362
QUESTION ALSO SOMETHING WE      
CONSIDERED ALSO SOMETHING WE    
DECIDED NOT TO.

CONSIDERED ALSO SOMETHING WE    
DECIDED NOT TO.                 
I AM ALL FOR REQUIRING          

02:16:22.366 --> 02:16:25.867
DECIDED NOT TO.                 
I AM ALL FOR REQUIRING          
ELECTRIFICATION AND I WILL WORK 

02:16:25.869 --> 02:16:26.535
I AM ALL FOR REQUIRING          
ELECTRIFICATION AND I WILL WORK 
HARD TO SEE THAT IT HAPPENS     

02:16:26.537 --> 02:16:30.005
ELECTRIFICATION AND I WILL WORK 
HARD TO SEE THAT IT HAPPENS     
THAT I WANT TO MAKE IT A        

02:16:30.007 --> 02:16:30.739
HARD TO SEE THAT IT HAPPENS     
THAT I WANT TO MAKE IT A        
UNIVERSAL REQUIREMENT OF ALL    

02:16:30.741 --> 02:16:33.742
THAT I WANT TO MAKE IT A        
UNIVERSAL REQUIREMENT OF ALL    
NEW DEVELOPMENT NOT JUST TAKE   

02:16:33.744 --> 02:16:37.046
UNIVERSAL REQUIREMENT OF ALL    
NEW DEVELOPMENT NOT JUST TAKE   
ONE TO MAKE EXTRA DENSITY A     

02:16:37.048 --> 02:16:37.846
NEW DEVELOPMENT NOT JUST TAKE   
ONE TO MAKE EXTRA DENSITY A     
PREMIUM FOR SUSTAINABILITY IN   

02:16:37.848 --> 02:16:40.782
ONE TO MAKE EXTRA DENSITY A     
PREMIUM FOR SUSTAINABILITY IN   
TSAY ONE WOULD AS MR. CARTER    

02:16:40.784 --> 02:16:41.583
PREMIUM FOR SUSTAINABILITY IN   
TSAY ONE WOULD AS MR. CARTER    
PAUL NOTED, BE A POISON PILL    

02:16:41.585 --> 02:16:44.486
TSAY ONE WOULD AS MR. CARTER    
PAUL NOTED, BE A POISON PILL    
FOR TSAY ONE BECAUSE            

02:16:44.488 --> 02:16:48.490
PAUL NOTED, BE A POISON PILL    
FOR TSAY ONE BECAUSE            
DEVELOPMENT WOULD BUILD ANY     

02:16:48.492 --> 02:16:52.227
FOR TSAY ONE BECAUSE            
DEVELOPMENT WOULD BUILD ANY     
PLACE IT COULD DO SO WITHOUT    

02:16:52.229 --> 02:16:52.961
DEVELOPMENT WOULD BUILD ANY     
PLACE IT COULD DO SO WITHOUT    
HAVING TO PROVIDE SOMETHING     

02:16:52.963 --> 02:16:53.762
PLACE IT COULD DO SO WITHOUT    
HAVING TO PROVIDE SOMETHING     
THAT MAKES IT LESS COMPETITIVE  

02:16:53.764 --> 02:16:56.799
HAVING TO PROVIDE SOMETHING     
THAT MAKES IT LESS COMPETITIVE  
THAN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.        

02:16:56.801 --> 02:16:57.933
THAT MAKES IT LESS COMPETITIVE  
THAN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.        
SO WE NEED TO MAKE THAT MAKE A  

02:16:57.935 --> 02:17:00.802
THAN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.        
SO WE NEED TO MAKE THAT MAKE A  
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHICH MEANS 

02:17:00.804 --> 02:17:01.669
SO WE NEED TO MAKE THAT MAKE A  
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHICH MEANS 
IT NEEDS TO BE A UNIVERSAL      

02:17:01.671 --> 02:17:03.705
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHICH MEANS 
IT NEEDS TO BE A UNIVERSAL      
REQUIREMENT.                    

02:17:03.707 --> 02:17:04.839
IT NEEDS TO BE A UNIVERSAL      
REQUIREMENT.                    
I WANT TO ADDRESS JUST TWO MORE 

02:17:04.841 --> 02:17:08.209
REQUIREMENT.                    
I WANT TO ADDRESS JUST TWO MORE 
THINGS BECAUSE I KNOW MY        

02:17:08.211 --> 02:17:08.977
I WANT TO ADDRESS JUST TWO MORE 
THINGS BECAUSE I KNOW MY        
COLLEAGUES ARE HAVE MANY THINGS 

02:17:08.979 --> 02:17:12.447
THINGS BECAUSE I KNOW MY        
COLLEAGUES ARE HAVE MANY THINGS 
THEY WANT TO SAY AND THEY WILL  

02:17:12.449 --> 02:17:13.281
COLLEAGUES ARE HAVE MANY THINGS 
THEY WANT TO SAY AND THEY WILL  
DO SO MORE ARTICULATELY THAN I  

02:17:13.283 --> 02:17:15.717
THEY WANT TO SAY AND THEY WILL  
DO SO MORE ARTICULATELY THAN I  
CAN.                            

02:17:15.719 --> 02:17:16.518
DO SO MORE ARTICULATELY THAN I

YOU WANTED US TO WAIT FOR THE   
COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN       
UPDATE.                         

02:17:20.191 --> 02:17:23.325
COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN       
UPDATE.                         
THE FACT IS THAT WE ARE         

02:17:23.327 --> 02:17:24.326
UPDATE.                         
THE FACT IS THAT WE ARE         
CATCHING UP WITH A VISION THAT  

02:17:24.328 --> 02:17:26.428
THE FACT IS THAT WE ARE         
CATCHING UP WITH A VISION THAT  
WAS EXPRESSED IN SEVERAL        

02:17:26.430 --> 02:17:27.061
CATCHING UP WITH A VISION THAT  
WAS EXPRESSED IN SEVERAL        
ELEMENTS OF THE EXISTING        

02:17:27.063 --> 02:17:30.399
WAS EXPRESSED IN SEVERAL        
ELEMENTS OF THE EXISTING        
COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN SOME  

02:17:30.401 --> 02:17:31.467
ELEMENTS OF THE EXISTING        
COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN SOME  
OF WHICH ARE MORE THAN A DECADE 

02:17:31.469 --> 02:17:34.503
COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN SOME  
OF WHICH ARE MORE THAN A DECADE 
OLD BUT MOST OF WHICH ARE NOT.  

02:17:34.505 --> 02:17:35.571
OF WHICH ARE MORE THAN A DECADE 
OLD BUT MOST OF WHICH ARE NOT.  
SO WE ARE BEHIND OUR MASTER     

02:17:35.573 --> 02:17:38.373
OLD BUT MOST OF WHICH ARE NOT.  
SO WE ARE BEHIND OUR MASTER     
PLAN AND AND YOU COULD ALWAYS   

02:17:38.375 --> 02:17:39.241
SO WE ARE BEHIND OUR MASTER

02:18:01.999 --> 02:18:05.100
PARKING MAINLY I&amp;apos;M JUST GOING   
TO ADDRESS THE PARKING OVERFLOW 
PART PARKING IS NOT FORBIDDEN.  

02:18:05.102 --> 02:18:08.870
TO ADDRESS THE PARKING OVERFLOW 
PART PARKING IS NOT FORBIDDEN.  
THE CITY IS NO LONGER MANDATING 

02:18:08.872 --> 02:18:09.571
PART PARKING IS NOT FORBIDDEN.  
THE CITY IS NO LONGER MANDATING 
A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARKING

SPACES THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE   
DEVELOPERS ARE GOING TO GO      
DEVELOPMENTS ARE GOING TO GO UP 

02:18:14.745 --> 02:18:16.344
DEVELOPERS ARE GOING TO GO      
DEVELOPMENTS ARE GOING TO GO UP 
WITHOUT PARKING BANKS WILL

DEVELOPMENTS ARE GOING TO GO UP 
WITHOUT PARKING BANKS WILL      
REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF PARKING

WITHOUT PARKING BANKS WILL      
REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF PARKING   
OR THEY AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO LOAN TO 

02:18:21.084 --> 02:18:23.118
REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF PARKING   
OR THEY AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO LOAN TO 
THESE DEVELOPERS BUT WE THINK   

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:27.322
OR THEY AREN&amp;apos;T GOING TO LOAN TO 
THESE DEVELOPERS BUT WE THINK   
THAT MINIMUM LEVELS OF PARKING  

02:18:27.324 --> 02:18:30.726
THESE DEVELOPERS BUT WE THINK   
THAT MINIMUM LEVELS OF PARKING  
ARE BETTER DECIDED BY WHAT YOUR 

02:18:30.728 --> 02:18:34.162
THAT MINIMUM LEVELS OF PARKING  
ARE BETTER DECIDED BY WHAT YOUR 
WHAT YOUR FINANCIER WANTS THAT  

02:18:34.164 --> 02:18:35.029
ARE BETTER DECIDED BY WHAT YOUR 
WHAT YOUR FINANCIER WANTS THAT  
DECIDED BY US BECAUSE WHAT WE   

02:18:35.031 --> 02:18:38.500
WHAT YOUR FINANCIER WANTS THAT  
DECIDED BY US BECAUSE WHAT WE   
ARE SEEING IS OVER PROVISION    

02:18:38.502 --> 02:18:41.970
DECIDED BY US BECAUSE WHAT WE   
ARE SEEING IS OVER PROVISION    
OF PARKING WE ARE SEEING AND SO 

02:18:41.972 --> 02:18:42.904
ARE SEEING IS OVER PROVISION    
OF PARKING WE ARE SEEING AND SO 
WE ARE SEEING DEVELOPERS BUYING 

02:18:42.906 --> 02:18:46.007
OF PARKING WE ARE SEEING AND SO 
WE ARE SEEING DEVELOPERS BUYING 
SPACES IN PARKING STRUCTURES    

02:18:46.009 --> 02:18:46.742
WE ARE SEEING DEVELOPERS BUYING 
SPACES IN PARKING STRUCTURES    
THAT IN ORDER TO MEET THE       

02:18:46.744 --> 02:18:49.844
SPACES IN PARKING STRUCTURES    
THAT IN ORDER TO MEET THE       
PARKING MINIMUM THAT GO UNUSED  

02:18:49.846 --> 02:18:50.879
THAT IN ORDER TO MEET THE       
PARKING MINIMUM THAT GO UNUSED  
THEY PASS THOSE COSTS ON TO     

02:18:50.881 --> 02:18:54.116
PARKING MINIMUM THAT GO UNUSED  
THEY PASS THOSE COSTS ON TO     
THEIR RENTERS.                  

02:18:54.118 --> 02:18:55.283
THEY PASS THOSE COSTS ON TO     
THEIR RENTERS.                  
WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT THEM TO DO THAT   

02:18:55.285 --> 02:18:57.919
THEIR RENTERS.                  
WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT THEM TO DO THAT   
ANYMORE.                        

02:18:57.921 --> 02:18:58.853
WE DON&amp;apos;T WANT THEM TO DO THAT   
ANYMORE.                        
SO ELIMINATING MINIMUM PARKING  

02:18:58.855 --> 02:19:02.624
ANYMORE.                        
SO ELIMINATING MINIMUM PARKING  
IS NOT THE SAME THING AS        

02:19:02.626 --> 02:19:03.125
SO ELIMINATING MINIMUM PARKING  
IS NOT THE SAME THING AS        
PROHIBITING PARKING.            

02:19:03.127 --> 02:19:06.428
IS NOT THE SAME THING AS        
PROHIBITING PARKING.            
THERE WILL BE PARKING IN THE    

02:19:06.430 --> 02:19:07.162
PROHIBITING PARKING.            
THERE WILL BE PARKING IN THE    
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.       

02:19:07.164 --> 02:19:10.598
THERE WILL BE PARKING IN THE    
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.       
THERE WILL LIKELY I SHOULD SAY  

02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:11.299

THERE WILL LIKELY I SHOULD SAY  
BECAUSE I DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A CRYSTAL  

02:19:11.301 --> 02:19:11.633
THERE WILL LIKELY I SHOULD SAY  
BECAUSE I DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A CRYSTAL  
BALL.                           

02:19:11.635 --> 02:19:14.536
BECAUSE I DON&amp;apos;T HAVE A CRYSTAL  
BALL.                           
THE PARKING OFFERED IN THE

THE PARKING OFFERED IN THE      
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT

WHAT THAT DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT  

02:19:31.722 --> 02:19:34.289
WOULD BE VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW   
WHAT THAT DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT  
BEFORE WE MOVE ON BECAUSE SO    

02:19:34.291 --> 02:19:35.290
WHAT THAT DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT  
BEFORE WE MOVE ON BECAUSE SO    
MANY PEOPLE REFERENCED IT AND I 

02:19:35.292 --> 02:19:37.893
BEFORE WE MOVE ON BECAUSE SO

PARCELS.                        

02:24:40.196 --> 02:24:44.099
ASSEMBLY AND ADDING MULTIPLE    
PARCELS.                        
SO WE TALKED ABOUT SHOULD TAKE  

02:24:44.101 --> 02:24:47.101
PARCELS.                        
SO WE TALKED ABOUT SHOULD TAKE  
ONE DISTRICT ALREADY A LOT WITH 

02:24:47.103 --> 02:24:47.935
SO WE TALKED ABOUT SHOULD TAKE  
ONE DISTRICT ALREADY A LOT WITH 
ABOVE AND BELOW TWO HUNDRED AND 

02:24:47.937 --> 02:24:51.406
ONE DISTRICT ALREADY A LOT WITH 
ABOVE AND BELOW TWO HUNDRED AND 
FIFTY FEET AND THERE&amp;apos;S THE      

02:24:51.408 --> 02:24:52.107
ABOVE AND BELOW TWO HUNDRED AND 
FIFTY FEET AND THERE&amp;apos;S THE      
DIFFERENCE OF THRESHOLDS WE     

02:24:52.109 --> 02:24:54.743
FIFTY FEET AND THERE&amp;apos;S THE      
DIFFERENCE OF THRESHOLDS WE     
TALKED.                         

02:24:54.745 --> 02:24:55.677
DIFFERENCE OF THRESHOLDS WE     
TALKED.                         
SHOULD WE CONSIDER CHANGES TO   

02:24:55.679 --> 02:24:55.877
TALKED.                         
SHOULD WE CONSIDER CHANGES TO   
THAT?                           

02:24:55.879 --> 02:25:01.750
SHOULD WE CONSIDER CHANGES TO   
THAT?                           
SHOULD WE SKEW THE DEVELOPMENT  

02:25:01.752 --> 02:25:02.550
THAT?                           
SHOULD WE SKEW THE DEVELOPMENT  
STANDARDS DOWN TO ADDRESS THE   

02:25:02.552 --> 02:25:05.454
SHOULD WE SKEW THE DEVELOPMENT  
STANDARDS DOWN TO ADDRESS THE   
FACT THAT WE HAVE A SMALLER     

02:25:05.456 --> 02:25:06.421
STANDARDS DOWN TO ADDRESS THE   
FACT THAT WE HAVE A SMALLER     
AVERAGE LOT SIZE IN OTHER       

02:25:06.423 --> 02:25:06.788
FACT THAT WE HAVE A SMALLER     
AVERAGE LOT SIZE IN OTHER       
CORRIDORS?                      

02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:09.724
AVERAGE LOT SIZE IN OTHER       
CORRIDORS?                      
IN THE END IT WAS DECIDED THAT  

02:25:09.726 --> 02:25:10.725
CORRIDORS?                      
IN THE END IT WAS DECIDED THAT  
THE DC ONE DISTRICT IS ROBUST   

02:25:10.727 --> 02:25:13.694
IN THE END IT WAS DECIDED THAT  
THE DC ONE DISTRICT IS ROBUST   
ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE THIS      

02:25:13.696 --> 02:25:14.363
THE DC ONE DISTRICT IS ROBUST   
ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE THIS      
SMALLER AVERAGE BECAUSE ACROSS  

02:25:14.365 --> 02:25:17.465
ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE THIS      
SMALLER AVERAGE BECAUSE ACROSS  
THE CITY YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO FIND   

02:25:17.467 --> 02:25:18.032
SMALLER AVERAGE BECAUSE ACROSS  
THE CITY YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING TO FIND   
THAT AVERAGES MIGHT BE

02:43:53.949 --> 02:43:56.983
WRITTEN MATERIAL BUT ALSO FROM  
THE STAFF REPORT THAT WE SAW

THERE WAS COMMENT PERIOD BUT I  
DID WATCH THAT AND I IN MY      

02:44:05.561 --> 02:44:09.229
THERE WAS COMMENT PERIOD BUT I  
DID WATCH THAT AND I IN MY      
THINKING ABOUT WHY SOMETHING    

02:44:09.231 --> 02:44:10.230
DID WATCH THAT AND I IN MY      
THINKING ABOUT WHY SOMETHING    
NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THAT I      

02:44:10.232 --> 02:44:13.433
THINKING ABOUT WHY SOMETHING    
NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THAT I      
THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERNS     

02:44:13.435 --> 02:44:14.168
NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THAT I      
THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERNS     
THAT ARE BROUGHT UP ARE ABOUT   

02:44:14.170 --> 02:44:16.069
THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERNS     
THAT ARE BROUGHT UP ARE ABOUT   
THE CHANGE FROM WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE    

02:44:16.071 --> 02:44:16.670
THAT ARE BROUGHT UP ARE ABOUT   
THE CHANGE FROM WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE    
NOW TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE          

02:44:16.672 --> 02:44:19.973
THE CHANGE FROM WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE    
NOW TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE          
IMAGINING COULD BE.             

02:44:19.975 --> 02:44:20.941
NOW TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE          
IMAGINING COULD BE.             
BUT ACTUALLY A LOT OF THOSE     

02:44:20.943 --> 02:44:24.344
IMAGINING COULD BE.             
BUT ACTUALLY A LOT OF THOSE     
THINGS ARE ALSO ALLOWED RIGHT   

02:44:24.346 --> 02:44:25.045
BUT ACTUALLY A LOT OF THOSE     
THINGS ARE ALSO ALLOWED RIGHT   
NOW IT&amp;apos;S JUST NOBODY HAS        

02:44:25.047 --> 02:44:25.446
THINGS ARE ALSO ALLOWED RIGHT   
NOW IT&amp;apos;S JUST NOBODY HAS        
REDEVELOPED.                    

02:44:25.448 --> 02:44:27.781
NOW IT&amp;apos;S JUST NOBODY HAS        
REDEVELOPED.                    
SO THAT&amp;apos;S SO LIKE I AM TRYING   

02:44:27.783 --> 02:44:31.017
REDEVELOPED.                    
SO THAT&amp;apos;S SO LIKE I AM TRYING   
TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO WHETHER   

02:44:31.019 --> 02:44:31.985
SO THAT&amp;apos;S SO LIKE I AM TRYING   
TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO WHETHER   
IT&amp;apos;S A DRAMATIC CHANGE TO MOVE  

02:44:31.987 --> 02:44:35.221
TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO WHETHER   
IT&amp;apos;S A DRAMATIC CHANGE TO MOVE  
TO TAKE ONE FOR EXAMPLE.        

02:44:35.223 --> 02:44:36.156
IT&amp;apos;S A DRAMATIC CHANGE TO MOVE  
TO TAKE ONE FOR EXAMPLE.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT     

02:44:36.158 --> 02:44:39.526
TO TAKE ONE FOR EXAMPLE.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT     
EXCEPT IN PLACES AND THIS IS    

02:44:39.528 --> 02:44:40.227
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT     
EXCEPT IN PLACES AND THIS IS    
LIKE MYCELIA PLEASE CORRECT ME  

02:44:40.229 --> 02:44:43.496
EXCEPT IN PLACES AND THIS IS    
LIKE MYCELIA PLEASE CORRECT ME  
MOST OF THE MOST OF THE         

02:44:43.498 --> 02:44:44.164
LIKE MYCELIA PLEASE CORRECT ME  
MOST OF THE MOST OF THE         
PROPERTIES ARE IN DISTRICTS     

02:44:44.166 --> 02:44:44.798
MOST OF THE MOST OF THE         
PROPERTIES ARE IN DISTRICTS     
WHERE HOUSING COULD BE BUILT    

02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:47.100
PROPERTIES ARE IN DISTRICTS     
WHERE HOUSING COULD BE BUILT    
RIGHT NOW.                      

02:44:47.102 --> 02:44:48.201
WHERE HOUSING COULD BE BUILT    
RIGHT NOW.                      
SO THIS IDEA OF LIKE DISPLACING 

02:44:48.203 --> 02:44:50.737
RIGHT NOW.                      
SO THIS IDEA OF LIKE DISPLACING 
COMMERCIAL WE ALLOW HOUSING IN

SO THIS IDEA OF LIKE DISPLACING 
COMMERCIAL WE ALLOW HOUSING IN  
OUR COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS, WE&amp;apos;RE 

02:44:54.410 --> 02:44:54.974
COMMERCIAL WE ALLOW HOUSING IN

JUST NOT GETTING IT.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THAT RIGHT?               

02:44:55.577 --> 02:44:58.412
JUST NOT GETTING IT.            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THAT RIGHT?               
YES.                            

02:44:58.414 --> 02:45:01.882

EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT&amp;apos;S     
OPEN YET BUT THE QUARTER BISTRO 

02:47:22.791 --> 02:47:23.423
EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT&amp;apos;S     
OPEN YET BUT THE QUARTER BISTRO 
WAS THAT A LITTLE BIT FARTHER   

02:47:23.425 --> 02:47:25.892
OPEN YET BUT THE QUARTER BISTRO 
WAS THAT A LITTLE BIT FARTHER   
BACK?                           

02:47:25.894 --> 02:47:27.127
WAS THAT A LITTLE BIT FARTHER

COUPLE OF THE PARKING IN FRONT  
OF IT AND THE NEW BUILDING THE  
LOUIS JEWELERS THEY HAVE IT HAS 

02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:34.000
OF IT AND THE NEW BUILDING THE  
LOUIS JEWELERS THEY HAVE IT HAS 
PARKING.                        

02:47:34.002 --> 02:47:35.001
LOUIS JEWELERS THEY HAVE IT HAS

IT&amp;apos;S ON THE SIDE OF THE

02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:37.503
IT&amp;apos;S ON THE SIDE OF THE         
BUILDING AND THE LEWIS JEWELERS 
IS MUCH CLOSER.                 

02:47:37.505 --> 02:47:38.638
BUILDING AND THE LEWIS JEWELERS 
IS MUCH CLOSER.                 
IT&amp;apos;S GOT TO IT HAS TO BE        

02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:39.205
IS MUCH CLOSER.                 
IT&amp;apos;S GOT TO IT HAS TO BE        
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND       

02:47:39.207 --> 02:47:41.274
IT&amp;apos;S GOT TO IT HAS TO BE        
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND       
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM.          

02:47:41.276 --> 02:47:42.442
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND

SO THAT&amp;apos;S A PERFECT EXAMPLE     

02:47:42.444 --> 02:47:45.412
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM.          
SO THAT&amp;apos;S A PERFECT EXAMPLE     
OF THAT ONE WAS REDEVELOPED ON  

02:47:45.414 --> 02:47:46.446
SO THAT&amp;apos;S A PERFECT EXAMPLE     
OF THAT ONE WAS REDEVELOPED ON  
STANDARDS IF IT WAS DC ONE      

02:47:46.448 --> 02:47:49.416
OF THAT ONE WAS REDEVELOPED ON  
STANDARDS IF IT WAS DC ONE      
OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCE WOULD BE 

02:47:49.418 --> 02:47:50.283
STANDARDS IF IT WAS DC ONE      
OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCE WOULD BE 
IT WOULD BE A TWO STOREY        

02:47:50.285 --> 02:47:52.085
OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCE WOULD BE 
IT WOULD BE A TWO STOREY        
BUILDING.                       

02:47:52.087 --> 02:47:53.153
IT WOULD BE A TWO STOREY        
BUILDING.                       
THE OTHER ONE WAS GREEN SPACE.  

02:47:53.155 --> 02:47:54.087
BUILDING.                       
THE OTHER ONE WAS GREEN SPACE.  
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT GREEN SPACE 

02:47:54.089 --> 02:47:56.556
THE OTHER ONE WAS GREEN SPACE.  
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT GREEN SPACE 
AND THIS IS CORRIDOR WITH NOT   

02:47:56.558 --> 02:47:57.224
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT GREEN SPACE 
AND THIS IS CORRIDOR WITH NOT   
VERY MANY TALL TREES.           

02:47:57.226 --> 02:47:58.091
AND THIS IS CORRIDOR WITH NOT   
VERY MANY TALL TREES.           
I THINK THAT IT COULD USE MORE  

02:47:58.093 --> 02:48:00.526
VERY MANY TALL TREES.           
I THINK THAT IT COULD USE MORE  
GREEN SPACE GENERALLY BUT       

02:48:00.528 --> 02:48:01.094
I THINK THAT IT COULD USE MORE  
GREEN SPACE GENERALLY BUT       
THERE&amp;apos;S NO OPEN SPACE           

02:48:01.096 --> 02:48:01.694
GREEN SPACE GENERALLY BUT       
THERE&amp;apos;S NO OPEN SPACE           
REQUIREMENTS IN THOSE           

02:48:01.696 --> 02:48:04.630
THERE&amp;apos;S NO OPEN SPACE

READING THE TABLE RIGHT.        
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE IT FOR TO SEE ONE 

02:48:06.234 --> 02:48:08.101
READING THE TABLE RIGHT.        
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE IT FOR TO SEE ONE

SO IN TERMS OF LIKE IT IS       

02:48:12.774 --> 02:48:13.407
WHAT&amp;apos;S ALREADY EXISTING THERE.  
SO IN TERMS OF LIKE IT IS       
DRAMATIC IF YOU&amp;apos;RE IMAGINING

SO IN TERMS OF LIKE IT IS       
DRAMATIC IF YOU&amp;apos;RE IMAGINING    
THAT ALL OF THESE PARCELS ARE

THAT ALL OF THESE PARCELS ARE   
REDEVELOPED ACCORDING TO KIND   

02:48:16.177 --> 02:48:16.843
THAT ALL OF THESE PARCELS ARE

OF ONE STANDARDS WHICH IS THAT  

02:48:16.845 --> 02:48:19.913
REDEVELOPED ACCORDING TO KIND   
OF ONE STANDARDS WHICH IS THAT  
THEY ARE TWO STOREY BUT IF YOU

THEY ARE TWO STOREY BUT IF YOU  
ALSO IMAGINE NO CHANGE TO       

02:48:20.715 --> 02:48:23.717
THEY ARE TWO STOREY BUT IF YOU  
ALSO IMAGINE NO CHANGE TO       
ZONING AND REDEVELOPMENT, IT&amp;apos;S  

02:48:23.719 --> 02:48:24.550
ALSO IMAGINE NO CHANGE TO       
ZONING AND REDEVELOPMENT, IT&amp;apos;S  
GOING TO LOOK SO DIFFERENT THAN 

02:48:24.552 --> 02:48:27.487
ZONING AND REDEVELOPMENT, IT&amp;apos;S  
GOING TO LOOK SO DIFFERENT THAN 
WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE NOW IN MOST        

02:48:27.489 --> 02:48:28.287
GOING TO LOOK SO DIFFERENT THAN 
WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE NOW IN MOST        
OF THOSE PLACES YOU COULD HAVE  

02:48:28.289 --> 02:48:30.423
WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE NOW IN MOST        
OF THOSE PLACES YOU COULD HAVE  
FIFTY FIVE FOOT BUILDINGS RIGHT 

02:48:30.425 --> 02:48:34.393
OF THOSE PLACES YOU COULD HAVE  
FIFTY FIVE FOOT BUILDINGS RIGHT 
UP UP LIKE AGAIN NOT ON ZERO    

02:48:34.395 --> 02:48:35.262
FIFTY FIVE FOOT BUILDINGS RIGHT 
UP UP LIKE AGAIN NOT ON ZERO    
SETBACKS BUT ON TEN FOOT        

02:48:35.264 --> 02:48:35.862
UP UP LIKE AGAIN NOT ON ZERO    
SETBACKS BUT ON TEN FOOT        
SETBACKS FROM THE ROAD LIKE     

02:48:35.864 --> 02:48:38.397
SETBACKS BUT ON TEN FOOT        
SETBACKS FROM THE ROAD LIKE     
IT&amp;apos;S QUITE QUITE DIFFERENT.     

02:48:38.399 --> 02:48:39.532
SETBACKS FROM THE ROAD LIKE     
IT&amp;apos;S QUITE QUITE DIFFERENT.     
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S ONE OF THE 

02:48:39.534 --> 02:48:42.802
IT&amp;apos;S QUITE QUITE DIFFERENT.     
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S ONE OF THE 
REASONS THAT I THINK IT&amp;apos;S I I   

02:48:42.804 --> 02:48:43.469
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S ONE OF THE 
REASONS THAT I THINK IT&amp;apos;S I I   
HEAR AND ACKNOWLEDGE IT BUT     

02:48:43.471 --> 02:48:46.806
REASONS THAT I THINK IT&amp;apos;S I I   
HEAR AND ACKNOWLEDGE IT BUT     
IT&amp;apos;S A REACTION TO WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE 

02:48:46.808 --> 02:48:47.708
HEAR AND ACKNOWLEDGE IT BUT     
IT&amp;apos;S A REACTION TO WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE 
NOW NOT WHAT THE ZONING FOR THE 

02:48:47.710 --> 02:48:50.176
IT&amp;apos;S A REACTION TO WHAT&amp;apos;S THERE 
NOW NOT WHAT THE ZONING FOR THE 
LAST DECADE, TWO DECADES, THREE 

02:48:50.178 --> 02:48:57.316
NOW NOT WHAT THE ZONING FOR THE 
LAST DECADE, TWO DECADES, THREE 
DECADES HAS ALLOWED FOR AND AND 

02:48:57.318 --> 02:48:58.384
LAST DECADE, TWO DECADES, THREE

IN SOME WAYS LIKE WE ARE THERE  

02:48:58.386 --> 02:49:01.854
DECADES HAS ALLOWED FOR AND AND 
IN SOME WAYS LIKE WE ARE THERE  
IS THE REASON THAT IN MY MIND   

02:49:01.856 --> 02:49:05.458
IN SOME WAYS LIKE WE ARE THERE  
IS THE REASON THAT IN MY MIND   
REZONING IS IMPORTANT IS TO WE  

02:49:05.460 --> 02:49:06.259
IS THE REASON THAT IN MY MIND   
REZONING IS IMPORTANT IS TO WE  
ARE PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL   

02:49:06.261 --> 02:49:09.529
REZONING IS IMPORTANT IS TO WE  
ARE PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL   
HEIGHT FOR THE DISTANCES AWAY   

02:49:09.531 --> 02:49:10.196
ARE PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL

DON&amp;apos;T HAVE THAT SAME KIND

DON&amp;apos;T HAVE THAT SAME KIND

DON&amp;apos;T HAVE THAT SAME KIND       
OF F.R. LIMITS THAT WE MAY HAVE 
BEEN SOME OF THOSE DISTRICTS    

02:49:20.608 --> 02:49:21.307
OF F.R. LIMITS THAT WE MAY HAVE 
BEEN SOME OF THOSE DISTRICTS    
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME         

02:49:21.309 --> 02:49:21.708
BEEN SOME OF THOSE DISTRICTS    
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME         
LIMITATIONS.

02:49:22.511 --> 02:49:25.212
LIMITATIONS.                    
AND SO THIS IS WHY I&amp;apos;M CAUTIOUS 
TO ASK TOO MUCH BECAUSE I DO    

02:49:25.214 --> 02:49:26.012
AND SO THIS IS WHY I&amp;apos;M CAUTIOUS 
TO ASK TOO MUCH BECAUSE I DO    
THINK THAT WE NEED HOUSING.     

02:49:26.014 --> 02:49:29.082
TO ASK TOO MUCH BECAUSE I DO

FORMULAIC IN THE DESIGN WHICH   
IS ALSO A GOOD LIKE I THINK     
THAT THEY&amp;apos;RE LIKE THE TOWARDS   

02:49:48.704 --> 02:49:50.937
IS ALSO A GOOD LIKE I THINK     
THAT THEY&amp;apos;RE LIKE THE TOWARDS   
COMMUNITY BENEFITS BUT I THINK  

02:49:50.939 --> 02:49:51.704
THAT THEY&amp;apos;RE LIKE THE TOWARDS   
COMMUNITY BENEFITS BUT I THINK  
THAT THAT&amp;apos;S ALSO A LIMIT.       

02:49:51.706 --> 02:49:52.639

THAT THAT&amp;apos;S ALSO A LIMIT.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S TYING    

02:49:52.641 --> 02:49:54.875
THAT THAT&amp;apos;S ALSO A LIMIT.

THEY HAVE TO GO TO STORIES EVEN

02:57:30.932 --> 02:57:34.900
THAT&amp;apos;S WHY YOU HAVE DIFFERENT   
ZONING DISTRICTS.               
SO IT WOULD TO HAVE TO STEPS UP 

02:57:34.902 --> 02:57:38.771

SO IT WOULD TO HAVE TO STEPS UP 
FRONT STEP BACK REQUIREMENTS    

02:57:38.773 --> 02:57:39.338
SO IT WOULD TO HAVE TO STEPS UP

DIDN&amp;apos;T AND WE DIDN&amp;apos;T DISCUSS IT

I CAN TELL YOU THAT OTHER

I CAN TELL YOU THAT OTHER

02:58:02.830 --> 02:58:05.932
DISTRICTS HAVE A MORE MILD

THEY DON&amp;apos;T OTHER DISTRICTS      

02:58:05.934 --> 02:58:06.832

THEY DON&amp;apos;T OTHER DISTRICTS      
DON&amp;apos;T HAVE YOU KNOW WELL WHEN   

02:58:06.834 --> 02:58:07.534
THEY DON&amp;apos;T OTHER DISTRICTS      
DON&amp;apos;T HAVE YOU KNOW WELL WHEN   
YOU&amp;apos;RE ON THE WEST, WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE 

02:58:07.536 --> 02:58:09.301
DON&amp;apos;T HAVE YOU KNOW WELL WHEN   
YOU&amp;apos;RE ON THE WEST, WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE 
ON THE WEST SIDE FOR THIS IS    

02:58:09.303 --> 02:58:10.169
YOU&amp;apos;RE ON THE WEST, WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE 
ON THE WEST SIDE FOR THIS IS    
YOUR SET BACK AND WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE   

02:58:10.171 --> 02:58:10.503
ON THE WEST SIDE FOR THIS IS    
YOUR SET BACK AND WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE   
ON THE SIDE.                    

02:58:10.505 --> 02:58:13.273
YOUR SET BACK AND WHEN YOU&amp;apos;RE   
ON THE SIDE.                    
BUT SOME DISTRICTS SAY WHAT     

02:58:13.275 --> 02:58:14.373
ON THE SIDE.                    
BUT SOME DISTRICTS SAY WHAT     
WILL A SETBACK IS ZERO TO 10    

02:58:14.375 --> 02:58:20.646
BUT SOME DISTRICTS SAY WHAT     
WILL A SETBACK IS ZERO TO 10    
ACCEPT WHEN I&amp;apos;M PICKING UP SOME 

02:58:20.648 --> 02:58:24.351
WILL A SETBACK IS ZERO TO 10    
ACCEPT WHEN I&amp;apos;M PICKING UP SOME 
IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS BUT   

02:58:24.353 --> 02:58:25.184
ACCEPT WHEN I&amp;apos;M PICKING UP SOME 
IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS BUT   
THEY SAY EXCEPT WHEN YOU DON&amp;apos;T  

02:58:25.186 --> 02:58:27.587
IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS BUT   
THEY SAY EXCEPT WHEN YOU DON&amp;apos;T

02:58:27.589 --> 02:58:28.254
THEY SAY EXCEPT WHEN YOU DON&amp;apos;T

02:58:31.192 --> 02:58:32.325
DIMENSION BETWEEN THE BACK      
OF THE BACK OF THE CURB.        
SO THAT WOULD BE A MORE MUCH    

02:58:32.327 --> 02:58:35.328
OF THE BACK OF THE CURB.        
SO THAT WOULD BE A MORE MUCH    
MORE MILD APPROACH.             

02:58:35.330 --> 02:58:36.329
SO THAT WOULD BE A MORE MUCH    
MORE MILD APPROACH.             
SO IT WOULD APPLY TO BOTH THE

UNDER ITS CURRENT C3.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT DEFINITELY HAS         

03:30:41.321 --> 03:30:42.186
UNDER ITS CURRENT C3.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT DEFINITELY HAS         
CHALLENGES NOW AND I THINK IT   

03:30:42.188 --> 03:30:44.389
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT DEFINITELY HAS         
CHALLENGES NOW AND I THINK IT   
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE           

03:30:44.391 --> 03:30:44.922
CHALLENGES NOW AND I THINK IT   
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE           
CHALLENGES.                     

03:30:44.924 --> 03:30:45.556
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE           
CHALLENGES.

BUT THIS MIGHT MIGHT YOU KNOW   
THEY MIGHT                      

03:30:51.863 --> 03:30:56.800
           IT HAS CHALLENGES    
NOW ANYWAY AND IT&amp;apos;S PROBABLY    
GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE       
CHALLENGES AND I THINK WE&amp;apos;RE    

03:30:57.437 --> 03:30:59.937

WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TONIGHT AND           
COMMISSIONER MILLS I THINK      

03:32:17.083 --> 03:32:17.748
WE&amp;apos;VE HAD TONIGHT AND           
COMMISSIONER MILLS I THINK      
STARTED WITH SOME OF THE        

03:32:17.750 --> 03:32:20.484
COMMISSIONER MILLS I THINK      
STARTED WITH SOME OF THE        
STORIES THAT THIS IS SOME POINT 

03:32:20.486 --> 03:32:21.418
STARTED WITH SOME OF THE        
STORIES THAT THIS IS SOME POINT 
BECAUSE WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T SEEN ANY     

03:32:21.420 --> 03:32:24.588
STORIES THAT THIS IS SOME POINT 
BECAUSE WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T SEEN ANY     
OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS      

03:32:24.590 --> 03:32:25.456
BECAUSE WE HAVEN&amp;apos;T SEEN ANY     
OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS      
CURRENTLY ALLOWED THAT WE WANT. 

03:32:25.458 --> 03:32:28.192
OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS      
CURRENTLY ALLOWED THAT WE WANT. 
BUT THAT IS WHY TO ME REZONING  

03:32:28.194 --> 03:32:29.426
CURRENTLY ALLOWED THAT WE WANT. 
BUT THAT IS WHY TO ME REZONING  
IS SO IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW, I 

03:32:29.428 --> 03:32:30.261
BUT THAT IS WHY TO ME REZONING  
IS SO IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW, I 
DON&amp;apos;T SEE THIS AS A GIVEAWAY TO 

03:32:30.263 --> 03:32:30.661
IS SO IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW, I 
DON&amp;apos;T SEE THIS AS A GIVEAWAY TO 
DEVELOPERS.                     

03:32:30.663 --> 03:32:32.129
DON&amp;apos;T SEE THIS AS A GIVEAWAY TO 
DEVELOPERS.                     
I THINK THIS IS REALLY HELPING  

03:32:32.131 --> 03:32:32.930
DEVELOPERS.                     
I THINK THIS IS REALLY HELPING  
US AS A COMMUNITY ENSURE THAT   

03:32:32.932 --> 03:32:33.731
I THINK THIS IS REALLY HELPING  
US AS A COMMUNITY ENSURE THAT   
WE GET THE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT 

03:32:33.733 --> 03:32:35.766
US AS A COMMUNITY ENSURE THAT   
WE GET THE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT 
THAT WE WANT.                   

03:32:35.768 --> 03:32:36.767
WE GET THE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT 
THAT WE WANT.                   
I THINK WE ALL REMEMBER THE     

03:32:36.769 --> 03:32:39.536
THAT WE WANT.                   
I THINK WE ALL REMEMBER THE     
PROPOSAL FOR THE STORAGE ON     

03:32:39.538 --> 03:32:40.371
I THINK WE ALL REMEMBER THE     
PROPOSAL FOR THE STORAGE ON     
STADIUM THAT IS CURRENTLY       

03:32:40.373 --> 03:32:40.637
PROPOSAL FOR THE STORAGE ON     
STADIUM THAT IS CURRENTLY       
ALLOWED.                        

03:32:40.639 --> 03:32:43.707
STADIUM THAT IS CURRENTLY       
ALLOWED.                        
THAT IS NOT THE TYPE THAT WE    

03:32:43.709 --> 03:32:44.441
ALLOWED.                        
THAT IS NOT THE TYPE THAT WE    
HEARD THE COMMUNITY LOUD AND    

03:32:44.443 --> 03:32:44.675
THAT IS NOT THE TYPE THAT WE    
HEARD THE COMMUNITY LOUD AND    
CLEAR.                          

03:32:44.677 --> 03:32:45.409
HEARD THE COMMUNITY LOUD AND    
CLEAR.                          
THAT IS NOT THE TYPE            

03:32:45.411 --> 03:32:47.544
CLEAR.                          
THAT IS NOT THE TYPE            
OF DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY WANT   

03:32:47.546 --> 03:32:48.345
THAT IS NOT THE TYPE            
OF DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY WANT   
AND LUCKILY THE DEVELOPER IS    

03:32:48.347 --> 03:32:49.146
OF DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY WANT   
AND LUCKILY THE DEVELOPER IS    
GOING TO PULL OUT OF THAT.      

03:32:49.148 --> 03:32:52.082
AND LUCKILY THE DEVELOPER IS    
GOING TO PULL OUT OF THAT.      
BUT I THINK THIS PROACTIVE      

03:32:52.084 --> 03:32:55.352
GOING TO PULL OUT OF THAT.      
BUT I THINK THIS PROACTIVE      
REZONING IS MAKING SURE THAT WE 

03:32:55.354 --> 03:32:58.922
BUT I THINK THIS PROACTIVE      
REZONING IS MAKING SURE THAT WE 
ARE GETTING THE FORM AND THE    

03:32:58.924 --> 03:32:59.857
REZONING IS MAKING SURE THAT WE 
ARE GETTING THE FORM AND THE    
DENSITY THAT WE WANT THAT THAT  

03:32:59.859 --> 03:33:03.527
ARE GETTING THE FORM AND THE    
DENSITY THAT WE WANT THAT THAT  
DENSITY TO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT  

03:33:03.529 --> 03:33:04.195
DENSITY THAT WE WANT THAT THAT  
DENSITY TO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT  
IS ALLOWED BUT WE&amp;apos;RE NOT        

03:33:04.197 --> 03:33:04.495
DENSITY TO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT  
IS ALLOWED BUT WE&amp;apos;RE NOT        
GETTING IT.                     

03:33:04.497 --> 03:33:07.030
IS ALLOWED BUT WE&amp;apos;RE NOT        
GETTING IT.                     
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE I THINK BY  

03:33:07.032 --> 03:33:07.697
GETTING IT.                     
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE I THINK BY  
DOING THE PROACTIVE ZONING      

03:33:07.699 --> 03:33:10.934
AND SO THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE I THINK BY  
DOING THE PROACTIVE ZONING      
WHICH I THINK A LOT PEOPLE HAVE 

03:33:10.936 --> 03:33:11.702
DOING THE PROACTIVE ZONING      
WHICH I THINK A LOT PEOPLE HAVE 
HAD CONCERNS WITH LIKE THIS     

03:33:11.704 --> 03:33:15.205
WHICH I THINK A LOT PEOPLE HAVE 
HAD CONCERNS WITH LIKE THIS     
KIND OF FORCES THE HAND A       

03:33:15.207 --> 03:33:17.808
HAD CONCERNS WITH LIKE THIS     
KIND OF FORCES THE HAND A       
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ANYTHING   

03:33:17.810 --> 03:33:22.012
KIND OF FORCES THE HAND A       
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ANYTHING   
THAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY ALLOWED.       

03:33:22.014 --> 03:33:23.013
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ANYTHING   
THAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY ALLOWED.       
I THINK TO THE POINT OF FACT    

03:33:23.015 --> 03:33:25.516
THAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY ALLOWED.       
I THINK TO THE POINT OF FACT    
RIGHT NOW THIS A REALLY WIDE    

03:33:25.518 --> 03:33:26.317
I THINK TO THE POINT OF FACT    
RIGHT NOW THIS A REALLY WIDE    
CORRIDOR THAT FRANKLY I WOULD   

03:33:26.319 --> 03:33:27.051
RIGHT NOW THIS A REALLY WIDE    
CORRIDOR THAT FRANKLY I WOULD   
NOT WANT TO CROSS ON FOOT.      

03:33:27.053 --> 03:33:30.387
CORRIDOR THAT FRANKLY I WOULD   
NOT WANT TO CROSS ON FOOT.      
I THINK IF WE WANT TO GET       

03:33:30.389 --> 03:33:31.122
NOT WANT TO CROSS ON FOOT.      
I THINK IF WE WANT TO GET       
SOMETHING THAT IS TRULY VIABLE  

03:33:31.124 --> 03:33:33.124
I THINK IF WE WANT TO GET       
SOMETHING THAT IS TRULY VIABLE  
AND WALKABLE AND IT FEELS MORE  

03:33:33.126 --> 03:33:33.791
SOMETHING THAT IS TRULY VIABLE  
AND WALKABLE AND IT FEELS MORE  
COMFORTABLE, THE ROAD JUST      

03:33:33.793 --> 03:33:34.558
AND WALKABLE AND IT FEELS MORE  
COMFORTABLE, THE ROAD JUST      
CAN&amp;apos;T BE THAT WIDE AND I KNOW   

03:33:34.560 --> 03:33:37.360
COMFORTABLE, THE ROAD JUST      
CAN&amp;apos;T BE THAT WIDE AND I KNOW   
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL 

03:33:37.362 --> 03:33:37.694
CAN&amp;apos;T BE THAT WIDE AND I KNOW   
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL 
OVER THAT.                      

03:33:37.696 --> 03:33:38.496
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL 
OVER THAT.                      
I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE      

03:33:38.498 --> 03:33:39.229
OVER THAT.                      
I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE      
THERE PROBABLY IS GOING TO BE   

03:33:39.231 --> 03:33:45.302
I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE      
THERE PROBABLY IS GOING TO BE   
AN OPPORTUNITY                  

03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:59.783
               TO REDUCE THE    
NUMBER OF DRIVING DRIVING       
LANES.

THINK THAT IT IS A TRADE OFF UM 
AS WE HAVE ALL CONCLUDED        

03:47:21.853 --> 03:47:24.587
THINK THAT IT IS A TRADE OFF UM 
AS WE HAVE ALL CONCLUDED        
STADIUM I THINK IT IS UNLIKELY  

03:47:24.589 --> 03:47:25.655
AS WE HAVE ALL CONCLUDED        
STADIUM I THINK IT IS UNLIKELY  
FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME  

03:47:25.657 --> 03:47:31.661
STADIUM I THINK IT IS UNLIKELY  
FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME  
TO BE A TREE LINED STREET.      

03:47:31.663 --> 03:47:35.632
FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME  
TO BE A TREE LINED STREET.      
I THINK THAT BY PROVIDING ZERO  

03:47:35.634 --> 03:47:38.568
TO BE A TREE LINED STREET.      
I THINK THAT BY PROVIDING ZERO  
SETBACKS WE ARE INCREASING      

03:47:38.570 --> 03:47:42.605
I THINK THAT BY PROVIDING ZERO  
SETBACKS WE ARE INCREASING      
FLEXIBILITY TOWARDS A MORE      

03:47:42.607 --> 03:47:43.339
SETBACKS WE ARE INCREASING      
FLEXIBILITY TOWARDS A MORE      
CONSTRAINED FEELING RIGHT AWAY, 

03:47:43.341 --> 03:47:47.143
FLEXIBILITY TOWARDS A MORE      
CONSTRAINED FEELING RIGHT AWAY, 
ALBEIT POTENTIALLY WITH A MORE  

03:47:47.145 --> 03:47:51.881
CONSTRAINED FEELING RIGHT AWAY, 
ALBEIT POTENTIALLY WITH A MORE  
URBANIZED FIELD IF WE THINK     

03:47:51.883 --> 03:47:54.951
ALBEIT POTENTIALLY WITH A MORE  
URBANIZED FIELD IF WE THINK     
THAT GREEN IS CRITICAL WITHIN   

03:47:54.953 --> 03:47:55.585
URBANIZED FIELD IF WE THINK     
THAT GREEN IS CRITICAL WITHIN   
THE SPACE BETWEEN THOSE         

03:47:55.587 --> 03:47:59.222
THAT GREEN IS CRITICAL WITHIN   
THE SPACE BETWEEN THOSE         
BUILDINGS THEN I THINK IT&amp;apos;S     

03:47:59.224 --> 03:48:02.859
THE SPACE BETWEEN THOSE         
BUILDINGS THEN I THINK IT&amp;apos;S     
WORTHWHILE TO EXPLORE A GREATER 

03:48:02.861 --> 03:48:03.292
BUILDINGS THEN I THINK IT&amp;apos;S     
WORTHWHILE TO EXPLORE A GREATER 
SET BACK.                       

03:48:03.294 --> 03:48:04.360
WORTHWHILE TO EXPLORE A GREATER 
SET BACK.                       
BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR AND   

03:48:04.362 --> 03:48:07.164
SET BACK.                       
BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR AND   
MAYBE CONTRIBUTE BRENNO FIVE OR 

03:48:07.166 --> 03:48:07.898
BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR AND   
MAYBE CONTRIBUTE BRENNO FIVE OR 
TEN FEET OF A SETBACK.          

03:48:07.900 --> 03:48:10.400
MAYBE CONTRIBUTE BRENNO FIVE OR 
TEN FEET OF A SETBACK.          
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW RIGHT.             

03:48:10.402 --> 03:48:13.737
TEN FEET OF A SETBACK.          
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW RIGHT.             
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT THAT WILL     

03:48:13.739 --> 03:48:14.203
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW RIGHT.             
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT THAT WILL     
ACCOMPLISH IT.                  

03:48:14.205 --> 03:48:15.138
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THAT THAT WILL     
ACCOMPLISH IT.                  
WE MIGHT VERY WELL IF THAT&amp;apos;S    

03:48:15.140 --> 03:48:17.874
ACCOMPLISH IT.                  
WE MIGHT VERY WELL IF THAT&amp;apos;S    
THE GOAL IS TO ADD GREEN YOU    

03:48:17.876 --> 03:48:18.741
WE MIGHT VERY WELL IF THAT&amp;apos;S    
THE GOAL IS TO ADD GREEN YOU    
MIGHT VERY WELL BE TALKING      

03:48:18.743 --> 03:48:19.409
THE GOAL IS TO ADD GREEN YOU    
MIGHT VERY WELL BE TALKING      
ABOUT SETBACKS THAT ARE MORE    

03:48:19.411 --> 03:48:22.612
MIGHT VERY WELL BE TALKING      
ABOUT SETBACKS THAT ARE MORE    
AKIN TO WHAT ARE THERE NOW      

03:48:22.614 --> 03:48:23.246
ABOUT SETBACKS THAT ARE MORE    
AKIN TO WHAT ARE THERE NOW      
MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE FEET.    

03:48:23.248 --> 03:48:26.450
AKIN TO WHAT ARE THERE NOW      
MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE FEET.    
I DON&amp;apos;T I&amp;apos;M SURE THAT THERE ARE 

03:48:26.452 --> 03:48:29.786
MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE FEET.    
I DON&amp;apos;T I&amp;apos;M SURE THAT THERE ARE 
SOME VARIABILITY BUT UM LIKE    

03:48:29.788 --> 03:48:30.721
I DON&amp;apos;T I&amp;apos;M SURE THAT THERE ARE 
SOME VARIABILITY BUT UM LIKE    
I&amp;apos;M JUST SPECULATING THAT BY    

03:48:30.723 --> 03:48:34.491
SOME VARIABILITY BUT UM LIKE    
I&amp;apos;M JUST SPECULATING THAT BY    
SIMPLY ADDING A FIVE FOOT       

03:48:34.493 --> 03:48:35.224
I&amp;apos;M JUST SPECULATING THAT BY    
SIMPLY ADDING A FIVE FOOT       
MINIMUM STEP BACK IS NOT GOING  

03:48:35.226 --> 03:48:38.228
SIMPLY ADDING A FIVE FOOT       
MINIMUM STEP BACK IS NOT GOING  
TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.          

03:48:38.230 --> 03:48:41.898
MINIMUM STEP BACK IS NOT GOING  
TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.          
SO UM I SORT OF FEEL LIKE THE   

03:48:41.900 --> 03:48:49.238
TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.          
SO UM I SORT OF FEEL LIKE THE   
QUESTION IS I THINK ONE IN      

03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:52.742
SO UM I SORT OF FEEL LIKE THE   
QUESTION IS I THINK ONE IN      
STADIUM IS GOING TO MEMORIALIZE 

03:48:52.744 --> 03:48:53.709
QUESTION IS I THINK ONE IN      
STADIUM IS GOING TO MEMORIALIZE 
THAT STREET AND ITS WAY THAT    

03:48:53.711 --> 03:48:56.913
STADIUM IS GOING TO MEMORIALIZE 
THAT STREET AND ITS WAY THAT    
HAS SOME BENEFITS TO TRAFFIC.   

03:48:56.915 --> 03:48:58.248
THAT STREET AND ITS WAY THAT    
HAS SOME BENEFITS TO TRAFFIC.   
I THINK IT HAS SOME BENEFITS TO

HAS SOME BENEFITS TO TRAFFIC.   
I THINK IT HAS SOME BENEFITS TO 
PEDESTRIAN COMFORT .

PEDESTRIAN COMFORT .            
I THINK IT HAS SOME BENEFITS TO 
REDUCING SPEED AND BICYCLE      

03:49:04.655 --> 03:49:07.957
I THINK IT HAS SOME BENEFITS TO 
REDUCING SPEED AND BICYCLE      
ACCESS AND THE LIKE.            

03:49:07.959 --> 03:49:09.225
REDUCING SPEED AND BICYCLE      
ACCESS AND THE LIKE.            
I THINK THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE 

03:49:09.227 --> 03:49:12.528
ACCESS AND THE LIKE.            
I THINK THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE 
CHALLENGING TO ADD GREEN WITHIN 

03:49:12.530 --> 03:49:16.499
I THINK THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE 
CHALLENGING TO ADD GREEN WITHIN 
THAT SPACE AND SO I I SORT      

03:49:16.501 --> 03:49:17.534
CHALLENGING TO ADD GREEN WITHIN 
THAT SPACE AND SO I I SORT      
OF FEEL LIKE IT IS SORT OF A    

03:49:17.536 --> 03:49:19.736
THAT SPACE AND SO I I SORT      
OF FEEL LIKE IT IS SORT OF A

ABOUT SCENARIOS THAT IF THE     
SIDEWALK IS X THEN IT MIGHT BE  
MORE THAT I DON&amp;apos;T THAT DOESN&amp;apos;T  

03:49:27.779 --> 03:49:28.645

MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO        

03:49:50.535 --> 03:49:51.600
TO BE AN IMPORTANT GOAL, IT     
MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO        
DECLARE THAT WE WANT THIS TO BE 

03:49:51.602 --> 03:49:54.637
MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO        
DECLARE THAT WE WANT THIS TO BE 
MORE OF A PARKWAY TYPE FIELD    

03:49:54.639 --> 03:49:58.507
DECLARE THAT WE WANT THIS TO BE 
MORE OF A PARKWAY TYPE FIELD    
THAN AN URBAN TYPE FEEL OFF THE 

03:49:58.509 --> 03:50:01.177
MORE OF A PARKWAY TYPE FIELD    
THAN AN URBAN TYPE FEEL OFF THE 
CUFF THAT SEEMS A LITTLE LESS

TRANSIT SUPPORTIVE TO ME MOST   
OUR EXPERIENCE IN PLANNING IS   

03:50:09.421 --> 03:50:10.353
TRANSIT SUPPORTIVE TO ME MOST   
OUR EXPERIENCE IN PLANNING IS   
THAT BRAIN USE IS CLOSE TO

OUR EXPERIENCE IN PLANNING IS   
THAT BRAIN USE IS CLOSE TO      
THOSE TRANSIT STOPS IS BETTER   

03:50:13.458 --> 03:50:14.056
THAT BRAIN USE IS CLOSE TO      
THOSE TRANSIT STOPS IS BETTER   
FOR THAT DYNAMIC.               

03:50:14.058 --> 03:50:17.293
THOSE TRANSIT STOPS IS BETTER

STADIUM YOU&amp;apos;RE WRESTLING WITH   
SHOULD IT FEEL LIKE MORE LIKE   

03:50:26.304 --> 03:50:30.907
STADIUM YOU&amp;apos;RE WRESTLING WITH   
SHOULD IT FEEL LIKE MORE LIKE   
THE BSU THAT THAT EVEN HAS SOME

TO FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW,        
SNAPPING THE FINGERS WHAT&amp;apos;S THE 
LONG TERM?                      

03:50:43.388 --> 03:50:44.153

I THINK THE MISTAKE OF THINKING 
WHAT IF IT&amp;apos;S ALL ABOUT THE ZERO 
SET BACK?                       

03:50:49.994 --> 03:50:50.960
WHAT IF IT&amp;apos;S ALL ABOUT THE ZERO 
SET BACK?                       
NOBODY CHOOSES TO DO A WIDE A

IT&amp;apos;S PERMISSIBLE.               
IT&amp;apos;S GOING TO BE VERY STARK.    
BUT I THINK AGAIN, UNLESS WE
