BE KIND OF JUST A STANDARD      

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:41.253
BUT I THINK IT WILL IT WILL NOT 
BE KIND OF JUST A STANDARD      
THING THAT IS OUR GOAL AND WE   

00:58:41.255 --> 00:58:44.555
BE KIND OF JUST A STANDARD      
THING THAT IS OUR GOAL AND WE   
APPRECIATE THAT ONE.            

00:58:44.557 --> 00:58:45.690
THING THAT IS OUR GOAL AND WE   
APPRECIATE THAT ONE.            
THE THINGS THAT I ALSO THIS IS  

00:58:45.692 --> 00:58:49.027
APPRECIATE THAT ONE.            
THE THINGS THAT I ALSO THIS IS  
THIS IS THE ZONING IS WOULD     

00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:51.696
THE THINGS THAT I ALSO THIS IS  
THIS IS THE ZONING IS WOULD     
ALLOW FOR THIS LAND.            

00:58:51.698 --> 00:58:52.163
THIS IS THE ZONING IS WOULD     
ALLOW FOR THIS LAND.            
RIGHT.

ALLOW FOR THIS LAND.            
RIGHT.                          
SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS AS   

00:58:53.233 --> 00:58:59.738
RIGHT.                          
SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS AS   
YOU KNOW, WE ASK AND ONE OF THE 

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:00.739
SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS AS   
YOU KNOW, WE ASK AND ONE OF THE 
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD IN GOING   

00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:03.709
YOU KNOW, WE ASK AND ONE OF THE 
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD IN GOING   
THROUGH ESPECIALLY KIND OF THE  

00:59:03.711 --> 00:59:04.509
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD IN GOING   
THROUGH ESPECIALLY KIND OF THE  
LEAD UP TO THE SUSTAINABILITY   

00:59:04.511 --> 00:59:07.713
THROUGH ESPECIALLY KIND OF THE  
LEAD UP TO THE SUSTAINABILITY   
IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 

00:59:07.715 --> 00:59:08.647
LEAD UP TO THE SUSTAINABILITY   
IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
SORTED OUT AND WHAT WE WHAT THE 

00:59:08.649 --> 00:59:11.983
IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
SORTED OUT AND WHAT WE WHAT THE 
SITE PLAN COVERS THAT WE KNOW   

00:59:11.985 --> 00:59:12.817
SORTED OUT AND WHAT WE WHAT THE

01:20:54.386 --> 01:20:54.685
SO THAT REPRESENTS THE THE      
FOUNDATION WALLS OF THE         
BUILDING.                       

01:20:54.687 --> 01:20:58.622
FOUNDATION WALLS OF THE         
BUILDING.                       
SO WE'RE JUST SHOWING IT WAS ON 

01:20:58.624 --> 01:20:59.423
BUILDING.                       
SO WE'RE JUST SHOWING IT WAS ON 
A NUMBER OF PLANS TO MAKE SURE  

01:20:59.425 --> 01:21:02.158
SO WE'RE JUST SHOWING IT WAS ON 
A NUMBER OF PLANS TO MAKE SURE  
THAT THAT'S EVIDENT EVERYWHERE  

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:02.859
A NUMBER OF PLANS TO MAKE SURE  
THAT THAT'S EVIDENT EVERYWHERE  
,ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO THE        

01:21:02.861 --> 01:21:06.396
THAT THAT'S EVIDENT EVERYWHERE  
,ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO THE        
EASEMENT AND THEN SO THIS LINE  

01:21:06.398 --> 01:21:07.330
,ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO THE        
EASEMENT AND THEN SO THIS LINE  
RIGHT HERE IS REALLY JUST THE   

01:21:07.332 --> 01:21:10.734
EASEMENT AND THEN SO THIS LINE  
RIGHT HERE IS REALLY JUST THE   
LIMIT OF WHERE THIS CURVING AND 

01:21:10.736 --> 01:21:14.438
RIGHT HERE IS REALLY JUST THE   
LIMIT OF WHERE THIS CURVING AND 
THE DRIVE ENTERS THE GARAGE     

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.305
LIMIT OF WHERE THIS CURVING AND 
THE DRIVE ENTERS THE GARAGE     
AREA WHERE THAT STOPS ON THE    

01:21:15.307 --> 01:21:18.375
THE DRIVE ENTERS THE GARAGE     
AREA WHERE THAT STOPS ON THE    
NORTH SIDE OF THAT THERE'S      

01:21:18.377 --> 01:21:22.278
AREA WHERE THAT STOPS ON THE    
NORTH SIDE OF THAT THERE'S      
THERE'S AN EXIT MAIN DOOR       

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.682
NORTH SIDE OF THAT THERE'S      
THERE'S AN EXIT MAIN DOOR       
PERSON DOOR THAT COMES OUT TO   

01:21:25.684 --> 01:21:29.887
THERE'S AN EXIT MAIN DOOR       
PERSON DOOR THAT COMES OUT TO   
KIND OF A CONCRETE SIDEWALK AND 

01:21:29.889 --> 01:21:33.590
PERSON DOOR THAT COMES OUT TO   
KIND OF A CONCRETE SIDEWALK AND 
ENDS UP GOING UP TO THE PUBLIC  

01:21:33.592 --> 01:21:37.160
KIND OF A CONCRETE SIDEWALK AND 
ENDS UP GOING UP TO THE PUBLIC  
SIDEWALK BELOW THIS BALCONY NO  

01:21:37.162 --> 01:21:38.128
ENDS UP GOING UP TO THE PUBLIC  
SIDEWALK BELOW THIS BALCONY NO  
DOUBT WHERE WE ROLL OUR CURB    

01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:40.797
SIDEWALK BELOW THIS BALCONY NO  
DOUBT WHERE WE ROLL OUR CURB    
CARTS FOR COMPOST THE THE DASH  

01:21:40.799 --> 01:21:41.698
DOUBT WHERE WE ROLL OUR CURB    
CARTS FOR COMPOST THE THE DASH  
LINES REPRESENT I GET IN AND    

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:45.235
CARTS FOR COMPOST THE THE DASH  
LINES REPRESENT I GET IN AND    
OUT OF THE GAS LINES.           

01:21:45.237 --> 01:21:46.036
LINES REPRESENT I GET IN AND    
OUT OF THE GAS LINES.           
I APPRECIATE THAT'S WHERE YOU   

01:21:46.038 --> 01:21:46.703
OUT OF THE GAS LINES.           
I APPRECIATE THAT'S WHERE YOU   
WOULD ENTER THE GARAGE AT.      

01:21:46.705 --> 01:21:47.037
I APPRECIATE THAT'S WHERE YOU   
WOULD ENTER THE GARAGE AT.      
RIGHT.                          

01:21:47.039 --> 01:21:50.039
WOULD ENTER THE GARAGE AT.      
RIGHT.                          
BUT SO IF YOU KEEP YOUR CURSOR  

01:21:50.041 --> 01:21:50.774
RIGHT.                          
BUT SO IF YOU KEEP YOUR CURSOR  
RIGHT WHERE IT IS STOPPING      

01:21:50.776 --> 01:21:53.844
BUT SO IF YOU KEEP YOUR CURSOR  
RIGHT WHERE IT IS STOPPING      
THERE SO THAT YOU HAVE THAT     

01:21:53.846 --> 01:21:54.545
RIGHT WHERE IT IS STOPPING      
THERE SO THAT YOU HAVE THAT     
SOLID LINE THAT'S COMING AROUND 

01:21:54.547 --> 01:21:56.613
THERE SO THAT YOU HAVE THAT     
SOLID LINE THAT'S COMING AROUND 
SO IS THAT JUST A DEMARCATION   

01:21:56.615 --> 01:21:57.347
SOLID LINE THAT'S COMING AROUND 
SO IS THAT JUST A DEMARCATION   
THAT IT'S A DIFFERENT MATERIAL  

01:21:57.349 --> 01:22:00.818
SO IS THAT JUST A DEMARCATION   
THAT IT'S A DIFFERENT MATERIAL  
FROM THE DRIVE OR IS THAT       

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:04.053
THAT IT'S A DIFFERENT MATERIAL  
FROM THE DRIVE OR IS THAT       
ACTUALLY BLOCKING ACCESS TO     

01:22:04.055 --> 01:22:04.988
FROM THE DRIVE OR IS THAT       
ACTUALLY BLOCKING ACCESS TO     
THERE WOULD BE AN ELEVATION     

01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.655
ACTUALLY BLOCKING ACCESS TO     
THERE WOULD BE AN ELEVATION     
SEPARATION BETWEEN WHERE THE    

01:22:05.657 --> 01:22:08.558
THERE WOULD BE AN ELEVATION     
SEPARATION BETWEEN WHERE THE    
DRIVE OF THE VEHICULAR USE IS   

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.259
SEPARATION BETWEEN WHERE THE    
DRIVE OF THE VEHICULAR USE IS   
AND THEN THE NEXT LEVEL WHERE   

01:22:09.261 --> 01:22:12.962
DRIVE OF THE VEHICULAR USE IS   
AND THEN THE NEXT LEVEL WHERE   
THE DOOR EXITING THE THE LOWER  

01:22:12.964 --> 01:22:13.330
AND THEN THE NEXT LEVEL WHERE   
THE DOOR EXITING THE THE LOWER  
LEVEL IS OK?                    

01:22:13.332 --> 01:22:16.132
THE DOOR EXITING THE THE LOWER  
LEVEL IS OK?                    
NOT NOT A HUGE ELEVATION        

01:22:16.134 --> 01:22:16.833
LEVEL IS OK?                    
NOT NOT A HUGE ELEVATION        
SEPARATION BUT THERE'S IT'S NOT 

01:22:16.835 --> 01:22:20.136
NOT NOT A HUGE ELEVATION        
SEPARATION BUT THERE'S IT'S NOT 
JUST DEMARCATION BUT THERE IS   

01:22:20.138 --> 01:22:21.238
SEPARATION BUT THERE'S IT'S NOT 
JUST DEMARCATION BUT THERE IS   
GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF A      

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:21.971
JUST DEMARCATION BUT THERE IS   
GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF A      
BARRIER THERE FOR VEHICLE AND   

01:22:21.973 --> 01:22:24.407
GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF A      
BARRIER THERE FOR VEHICLE AND   
DIRECTING VEHICLES INTO THE     

01:22:24.409 --> 01:22:25.209
BARRIER THERE FOR VEHICLE AND   
DIRECTING VEHICLES INTO THE     
GARAGE AND IT'S IT'S MIRRORED   

01:22:25.211 --> 01:22:28.244
DIRECTING VEHICLES INTO THE     
GARAGE AND IT'S IT'S MIRRORED   
AT THE END THE LONG SHORT ROAD  

01:22:28.246 --> 01:22:31.281
GARAGE AND IT'S IT'S MIRRORED   
AT THE END THE LONG SHORT ROAD  
SLIPS AWAY.                     

01:22:31.283 --> 01:22:32.416
AT THE END THE LONG SHORT ROAD  
SLIPS AWAY.                     
SO THE FIRST FLOOR IS BASICALLY 

01:22:32.418 --> 01:22:35.518
SLIPS AWAY.                     
SO THE FIRST FLOOR IS BASICALLY 
AT GRADE AT THE EAST END BUT    

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.486
SO THE FIRST FLOOR IS BASICALLY 
AT GRADE AT THE EAST END BUT    
THE GARAGE IS AT GRADE AT THE   

01:22:36.488 --> 01:22:36.853
AT GRADE AT THE EAST END BUT    
THE GARAGE IS AT GRADE AT THE   
WEST END.                       

01:22:36.855 --> 01:22:40.056
THE GARAGE IS AT GRADE AT THE   
WEST END.                       
SO I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO   

01:22:40.058 --> 01:22:40.791
WEST END.                       
SO I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO   
MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT      

01:22:40.793 --> 01:22:42.358
SO I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO   
MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT      
GOING TO BLOCK ACCESS HERE      

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.327
MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT      
GOING TO BLOCK ACCESS HERE      
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  

01:22:43.329 --> 01:22:43.994
GOING TO BLOCK ACCESS HERE      
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  
WE WERE DEALING WITH WITH       

01:22:43.996 --> 01:22:46.830
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  
WE WERE DEALING WITH WITH       
ANOTHER DEVELOPER THAT WAS ON A 

01:22:46.832 --> 01:22:50.233
WE WERE DEALING WITH WITH       
ANOTHER DEVELOPER THAT WAS ON A 
WAS IT MADE IT HARD FOR SOMEONE 

01:22:50.235 --> 01:22:51.168
ANOTHER DEVELOPER THAT WAS ON A 
WAS IT MADE IT HARD FOR SOMEONE 
WHO MIGHT NEED ASSISTANCE TO    

01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:54.837
WAS IT MADE IT HARD FOR SOMEONE 
WHO MIGHT NEED ASSISTANCE TO    
MAKE USE OF THIS ACCESS AND     

01:22:54.839 --> 01:22:55.472
WHO MIGHT NEED ASSISTANCE TO    
MAKE USE OF THIS ACCESS AND     
THEY HAD A VERY SIMILAR SETUP   

01:22:55.474 --> 01:22:58.341
MAKE USE OF THIS ACCESS AND     
THEY HAD A VERY SIMILAR SETUP   
LIKE YOU DID AN UNDERGRAD       

01:22:58.343 --> 01:22:58.942
THEY HAD A VERY SIMILAR SETUP   
LIKE YOU DID AN UNDERGRAD       
UNDERGROUND GARAGE WITH         

01:22:58.944 --> 01:23:02.212
LIKE YOU DID AN UNDERGRAD       
UNDERGROUND GARAGE WITH         
ELEVATORS THAT WENT RIGHT TO    

01:23:02.214 --> 01:23:02.612
UNDERGROUND GARAGE WITH         
ELEVATORS THAT WENT RIGHT TO    
RESIDENCES.                     

01:23:02.614 --> 01:23:06.516
ELEVATORS THAT WENT RIGHT TO    
RESIDENCES.                     
AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS A    

01:23:06.518 --> 01:23:07.117
RESIDENCES.                     
AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS A    
SOMEONE COMING INTO THE         

01:23:07.119 --> 01:23:10.386
AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS A    
SOMEONE COMING INTO THE         
BUILDING THAT NEEDED            

01:23:10.388 --> 01:23:11.254
SOMEONE COMING INTO THE         
BUILDING THAT NEEDED            
ACCESSIBILITY HELP WOULD NOT BE 

01:23:11.256 --> 01:23:13.356
BUILDING THAT NEEDED            
ACCESSIBILITY HELP WOULD NOT BE 
ABLE TO ENTER THE BUILDING      

01:23:13.358 --> 01:23:14.091
ACCESSIBILITY HELP WOULD NOT BE 
ABLE TO ENTER THE BUILDING      
UNLESS THEY ENTERED THE         

01:23:14.093 --> 01:23:14.625
ABLE TO ENTER THE BUILDING      
UNLESS THEY ENTERED THE         
BUILDING THROUGH SOMEONE'S      

01:23:14.627 --> 01:23:18.295
UNLESS THEY ENTERED THE         
BUILDING THROUGH SOMEONE'S      
PRIVATE GARAGE AND THEN THEY    

01:23:18.297 --> 01:23:19.095
BUILDING THROUGH SOMEONE'S      
PRIVATE GARAGE AND THEN THEY    
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO     

01:23:19.097 --> 01:23:22.032
PRIVATE GARAGE AND THEN THEY    
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO     
WHERE THEY WANT IT TO GO        

01:23:22.034 --> 01:23:25.135
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO     
WHERE THEY WANT IT TO GO        
BECAUSE THE DEVELOPER HADN'T    

01:23:25.137 --> 01:23:26.069
WHERE THEY WANT IT TO GO        
BECAUSE THE DEVELOPER HADN'T    
CREATED A MEANS FOR THAT TO     

01:23:26.071 --> 01:23:26.403
BECAUSE THE DEVELOPER HADN'T    
CREATED A MEANS FOR THAT TO     
OCCUR.                          

01:23:26.405 --> 01:23:29.873
CREATED A MEANS FOR THAT TO     
OCCUR.                          
SO MY QUESTION IS TRYING TO     

01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:33.410
OCCUR.                          
SO MY QUESTION IS TRYING TO     
ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING  

01:23:33.412 --> 01:23:34.210
SO MY QUESTION IS TRYING TO     
ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING  
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE     

01:23:34.212 --> 01:23:37.547
ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING  
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE     
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR        

01:23:37.549 --> 01:23:41.585
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE     
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR        
SOMEONE WHO REQUIRES AID TO     

01:23:41.587 --> 01:23:42.385
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR        
SOMEONE WHO REQUIRES AID TO     
ENTER AND EXIT THE BUILDING     

01:23:42.387 --> 01:23:44.687
SOMEONE WHO REQUIRES AID TO     
ENTER AND EXIT THE BUILDING     
UNLESS THEY ARE COMING THROUGH  

01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:45.355
ENTER AND EXIT THE BUILDING     
UNLESS THEY ARE COMING THROUGH  
SOMEONE'S PRIVATE GARAGE WHICH  

01:23:45.357 --> 01:23:46.223
UNLESS THEY ARE COMING THROUGH  
SOMEONE'S PRIVATE GARAGE WHICH  
WOULD THEN PRECLUDE THEM FROM   

01:23:46.225 --> 01:23:48.959
SOMEONE'S PRIVATE GARAGE WHICH  
WOULD THEN PRECLUDE THEM FROM   
GETTING TO WHERE THEY NEEDED TO 

01:23:48.961 --> 01:23:50.027
WOULD THEN PRECLUDE THEM FROM   
GETTING TO WHERE THEY NEEDED TO 
GO IF THEY WERE IN THESE TWO    

01:23:50.029 --> 01:23:53.263
GETTING TO WHERE THEY NEEDED TO 
GO IF THEY WERE IN THESE TWO    
SPOTS WHERE WE CAN JUST FLIP    

01:23:53.265 --> 01:23:53.931
GO IF THEY WERE IN THESE TWO    
SPOTS WHERE WE CAN JUST FLIP    
BACK TO THE OTHER PRESENTATION  

01:23:53.933 --> 01:23:56.833
SPOTS WHERE WE CAN JUST FLIP    
BACK TO THE OTHER PRESENTATION  
REAL QUICK.                     

01:23:56.835 --> 01:23:57.067
BACK TO THE OTHER PRESENTATION  
REAL QUICK.                     
SURE.                           

01:23:57.069 --> 01:24:00.603
REAL QUICK.                     
SURE.                           
AND SHOW THE FIRST THE THE      

01:24:00.605 --> 01:24:01.304
SURE.                           
AND SHOW THE FIRST THE THE      
WHICH ONE IS IT?                

01:24:01.306 --> 01:24:04.441
AND SHOW THE FIRST THE THE      
WHICH ONE IS IT?                
YES, BUT THE TASKBAR AT THE     

01:24:04.443 --> 01:24:05.242
WHICH ONE IS IT?                
YES, BUT THE TASKBAR AT THE     
BOTTOM OVER OVER THE TASKBAR    

01:24:05.244 --> 01:24:08.111
YES, BUT THE TASKBAR AT THE     
BOTTOM OVER OVER THE TASKBAR    
THEY WERE ON THE READER.        

01:24:08.113 --> 01:24:11.881
BOTTOM OVER OVER THE TASKBAR    
THEY WERE ON THE READER.        
>> SO IF WE JUST GO UP TO THE   

01:24:11.883 --> 01:24:12.915
THEY WERE ON THE READER.        
>> SO IF WE JUST GO UP TO THE   
FIRST FLOOR, YOU KNOW, IT'S A   

01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:15.151
>> SO IF WE JUST GO UP TO THE   
FIRST FLOOR, YOU KNOW, IT'S A   
LITTLE BIT MISNOMER SINCE WE'RE 

01:24:15.153 --> 01:24:15.918
FIRST FLOOR, YOU KNOW, IT'S A   
LITTLE BIT MISNOMER SINCE WE'RE 
BUILT INTO THIS AND THERE'S     

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.855
LITTLE BIT MISNOMER SINCE WE'RE 
BUILT INTO THIS AND THERE'S     
ABOUT TEN FEET OF FALL TEN OR   

01:24:18.857 --> 01:24:19.556
BUILT INTO THIS AND THERE'S     
ABOUT TEN FEET OF FALL TEN OR   
TWELVE FEET OF FALL I BELIEVE   

01:24:19.558 --> 01:24:20.290
ABOUT TEN FEET OF FALL TEN OR   
TWELVE FEET OF FALL I BELIEVE   
FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST ON    

01:24:20.292 --> 01:24:22.992
TWELVE FEET OF FALL I BELIEVE   
FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST ON    
THE SITE THERE'S THREE WELL     

01:24:22.994 --> 01:24:23.694
FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST ON    
THE SITE THERE'S THREE WELL     
THERE'S TWO GREAT ENTRIES.      

01:24:23.696 --> 01:24:26.696
THE SITE THERE'S THREE WELL     
THERE'S TWO GREAT ENTRIES.      
THERE'S ONE FROM THE EAST.      

01:24:26.698 --> 01:24:27.631
THERE'S TWO GREAT ENTRIES.      
THERE'S ONE FROM THE EAST.      
THERE'S A SIDEWALK THAT COMES   

01:24:27.633 --> 01:24:28.398
THERE'S ONE FROM THE EAST.      
THERE'S A SIDEWALK THAT COMES   
IN BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS AS 

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.867
THERE'S A SIDEWALK THAT COMES   
IN BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS AS 
AN ACCURATE ENTRANCE TO THIS    

01:24:30.869 --> 01:24:31.634
IN BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS AS 
AN ACCURATE ENTRANCE TO THIS    
OPEN AIR CONCOURSE THAT FEEDS   

01:24:31.636 --> 01:24:34.837
AN ACCURATE ENTRANCE TO THIS    
OPEN AIR CONCOURSE THAT FEEDS   
THE UNITS FROM THAT LEVEL AND   

01:24:34.839 --> 01:24:35.605
OPEN AIR CONCOURSE THAT FEEDS   
THE UNITS FROM THAT LEVEL AND   
THEN THERE'S A RAMP AND STAIRS

IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE ASPHALT 
AND ASPHALT WASN'T ALLOWED AND  

02:11:51.106 --> 02:11:53.940
IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE ASPHALT 
AND ASPHALT WASN'T ALLOWED AND  
IT NEEDED TO BE A NON PERMEABLE 

02:11:53.942 --> 02:11:54.641
AND ASPHALT WASN'T ALLOWED AND  
IT NEEDED TO BE A NON PERMEABLE 
SURFACE AND THAT'S WHY THE      

02:11:54.643 --> 02:11:57.010
IT NEEDED TO BE A NON PERMEABLE 
SURFACE AND THAT'S WHY THE      
DECISION WAS MADE TO PUT IN THE 

02:11:57.012 --> 02:11:57.611
SURFACE AND THAT'S WHY THE      
DECISION WAS MADE TO PUT IN THE 
PAVERS EASIER FOR UPKEEP,       

02:11:57.613 --> 02:12:01.815
DECISION WAS MADE TO PUT IN THE 
PAVERS EASIER FOR UPKEEP,       
LANDSCAPING, ET CETERA.         

02:12:01.817 --> 02:12:02.816
PAVERS EASIER FOR UPKEEP,       
LANDSCAPING, ET CETERA.         
BUT THEN THE PLANTER IS THE BIG 

02:12:02.818 --> 02:12:03.617
LANDSCAPING, ET CETERA.         
BUT THEN THE PLANTER IS THE BIG 
THING THAT WE PUT IN TOO IS     

02:12:03.619 --> 02:12:06.153
BUT THEN THE PLANTER IS THE BIG 
THING THAT WE PUT IN TOO IS     
THAT EIGHT FOOT LONG SEVERAL    

02:12:06.155 --> 02:12:06.854
THING THAT WE PUT IN TOO IS     
THAT EIGHT FOOT LONG SEVERAL    
FOOT HIGH PLANTER THAT'S FILLED 

02:12:06.856 --> 02:12:09.523
THAT EIGHT FOOT LONG SEVERAL    
FOOT HIGH PLANTER THAT'S FILLED 
WITH DIRT AND WE NOW HAVE       

02:12:09.525 --> 02:12:09.857
FOOT HIGH PLANTER THAT'S FILLED 
WITH DIRT AND WE NOW HAVE       
PLANTS IN IT.

WITH DIRT AND WE NOW HAVE       
PLANTS IN IT.                   
SO TO SAY IT'S MOVABLE.         

02:12:10.593 --> 02:12:13.326
PLANTS IN IT.                   
SO TO SAY IT'S MOVABLE.         
I GUESS THIS IS TRUE BUT BUT I  

02:12:13.328 --> 02:12:14.061
SO TO SAY IT'S MOVABLE.         
I GUESS THIS IS TRUE BUT BUT I  
THINK AT THE SAME TIME YOU

I GUESS THIS IS TRUE BUT BUT I  
THINK AT THE SAME TIME YOU      
COULD SAY PRETTY MUCH           

02:12:14.597 --> 02:12:15.396
THINK AT THE SAME TIME YOU      
COULD SAY PRETTY MUCH           
EVERYTHING WOULD BE MOVABLE AT  

02:12:15.398 --> 02:12:17.197
COULD SAY PRETTY MUCH           
EVERYTHING WOULD BE MOVABLE AT  
THAT POINT.                     

02:12:17.199 --> 02:12:18.031
EVERYTHING WOULD BE MOVABLE AT  
THAT POINT.                     
I MEAN WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT    

02:12:18.033 --> 02:12:18.832
THAT POINT.                     
I MEAN WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT    
DISASSEMBLING AN ENTIRE BOX,    

02:12:18.834 --> 02:12:21.569
I MEAN WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT    
DISASSEMBLING AN ENTIRE BOX,    
REMOVING ALL OF THE DIRT AND    

02:12:21.571 --> 02:12:24.804
DISASSEMBLING AN ENTIRE BOX,    
REMOVING ALL OF THE DIRT AND    
IT'S ALL BUT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY 

02:12:24.806 --> 02:12:25.705
REMOVING ALL OF THE DIRT AND    
IT'S ALL BUT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY 
NO PLANS OF USING THAT SPACE    

02:12:25.707 --> 02:12:26.473
IT'S ALL BUT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY 
NO PLANS OF USING THAT SPACE    
FOR PARKING DEFINITELY FOR THE

RETAIL.                         
WE PLAN ON HAVING THAT PLANTER  

02:12:30.012 --> 02:12:33.080
RETAIL.                         
WE PLAN ON HAVING THAT PLANTER  
REMAIN THERE AND I GUESS THAT   

02:12:33.082 --> 02:12:34.014
WE PLAN ON HAVING THAT PLANTER  
REMAIN THERE AND I GUESS THAT   
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY IS THE     

02:12:34.016 --> 02:12:36.116
REMAIN THERE AND I GUESS THAT   
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY IS THE     
TENANT AND WHAT OUR PLANS ARE   

02:12:36.118 --> 02:12:36.817
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY IS THE     
TENANT AND WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

>> BUT AGAIN, I WANT TO ALSO    

02:12:37.887 --> 02:12:40.488
AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT.       
>> BUT AGAIN, I WANT TO ALSO    
MAYBE THIS IS THE POINT         

02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:41.088
>> BUT AGAIN, I WANT TO ALSO    
MAYBE THIS IS THE POINT         
OF CLARIFICATION.               

02:12:41.090 --> 02:12:43.991
MAYBE THIS IS THE POINT         
OF CLARIFICATION.               
THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STAYS 

02:12:43.993 --> 02:12:44.925
OF CLARIFICATION.               
THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STAYS 
THE LAND IT DOESN'T IS THE      

02:12:44.927 --> 02:12:47.794
THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STAYS 
THE LAND IT DOESN'T IS THE      
REASON THAT ACTUALLY THAT WAS   

02:12:47.796 --> 02:12:48.662
THE LAND IT DOESN'T IS THE      
REASON THAT ACTUALLY THAT WAS   
ONE OF MY QUESTIONS HERE TODAY  

02:12:48.664 --> 02:12:49.396
REASON THAT ACTUALLY THAT WAS   
ONE OF MY QUESTIONS HERE TODAY  
IS LIKE WHY WE ALREADY APPROVED

ONE OF MY QUESTIONS HERE TODAY  
IS LIKE WHY WE ALREADY APPROVED 
A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE.        

02:12:52.067 --> 02:12:53.099
IS LIKE WHY WE ALREADY APPROVED 
A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE.

SUCCESSFUL THERE AND STAY       
THERE.                          
BUT IF THAT'S IF FOR SOME       

02:12:57.506 --> 02:13:00.574
THERE.                          
BUT IF THAT'S IF FOR SOME       
REASON THERE'S A BETTER PLACE   

02:13:00.576 --> 02:13:04.278
BUT IF THAT'S IF FOR SOME       
REASON THERE'S A BETTER PLACE   
TO BE AND AND OTHER TENANT      

02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:05.012
REASON THERE'S A BETTER PLACE   
TO BE AND AND OTHER TENANT      
COMES THAT WISHES TO USE THAT   

02:13:05.014 --> 02:13:08.215
TO BE AND AND OTHER TENANT      
COMES THAT WISHES TO USE THAT   
SPECIAL EXCEPTION, THEY THEY    

02:13:08.217 --> 02:13:09.282
COMES THAT WISHES TO USE THAT   
SPECIAL EXCEPTION, THEY THEY    
MAY MOVE THE BOX AND SO THAT'S  

02:13:09.284 --> 02:13:12.719
SPECIAL EXCEPTION, THEY THEY    
MAY MOVE THE BOX AND SO THAT'S  
WHY HAVING LIKE THAT WILL GIVE  

02:13:12.721 --> 02:13:13.386
MAY MOVE THE BOX AND SO THAT'S  
WHY HAVING LIKE THAT WILL GIVE  
ME MORE COMFORT BUT I'M NOT     

02:13:13.388 --> 02:13:16.190
WHY HAVING LIKE THAT WILL GIVE  
ME MORE COMFORT BUT I'M NOT     
GOING TO STAND IN THE WAY THIS  

02:13:16.192 --> 02:13:16.856
ME MORE COMFORT BUT I'M NOT     
GOING TO STAND IN THE WAY THIS  
IS JUST GOODNESS GUYS.          

02:13:16.858 --> 02:13:17.724
GOING TO STAND IN THE WAY THIS  
IS JUST GOODNESS GUYS.          
>> THIS HAS COME BEFORE US A    

02:13:17.726 --> 02:13:17.991
IS JUST GOODNESS GUYS.          
>> THIS HAS COME BEFORE US A    
LOT.

LOT.                            
ONE MORE THING IS IF YOU LOOK   

02:13:20.495 --> 02:13:21.328
LOT.                            
ONE MORE THING IS IF YOU LOOK   
AT THE SITE PLAN WHEN WE TURNED 

02:13:21.330 --> 02:13:24.431
ONE MORE THING IS IF YOU LOOK   
AT THE SITE PLAN WHEN WE TURNED 
IN THE AMENDED PLAN IT CHANGED  

02:13:24.433 --> 02:13:25.098
AT THE SITE PLAN WHEN WE TURNED 
IN THE AMENDED PLAN IT CHANGED  
THE PARKING SPACES FOR          

02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:28.435
IN THE AMENDED PLAN IT CHANGED  
THE PARKING SPACES FOR          
POTENTIALLY FIVE TO THREE AND   

02:13:28.437 --> 02:13:29.103
THE PARKING SPACES FOR          
POTENTIALLY FIVE TO THREE AND   
THAT IS ON THE SITE PLAN        

02:13:29.105 --> 02:13:31.805
POTENTIALLY FIVE TO THREE AND   
THAT IS ON THE SITE PLAN        
CONCEDING THAT AS A PARKING     

02:13:31.807 --> 02:13:32.673
THAT IS ON THE SITE PLAN        
CONCEDING THAT AS A PARKING     
SPACE IT WOULD BE JUST THE      

02:13:32.675 --> 02:13:33.473
CONCEDING THAT AS A PARKING     
SPACE IT WOULD BE JUST THE      
THREE SPOTS THAT WE LEASE       

02:13:33.475 --> 02:13:36.076
SPACE IT WOULD BE JUST THE      
THREE SPOTS THAT WE LEASE       
BEHIND DOMINICK'S.              

02:13:36.078 --> 02:13:37.278
THREE SPOTS THAT WE LEASE       
BEHIND DOMINICK'S.              
>> AND SO WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING

WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE LIMITATION 

02:23:11.052 --> 02:23:12.052
WE'RE NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT  
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE LIMITATION 
THAT WE HAVE OR AT LEAST THAT'S 

02:23:12.054 --> 02:23:12.652
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE LIMITATION 
THAT WE HAVE OR AT LEAST THAT'S 
MY POINT OF VIEW.               

02:23:12.654 --> 02:23:14.287
THAT WE HAVE OR AT LEAST THAT'S 
MY POINT OF VIEW.               
I'LL SPEAK FOR MYSELF.          

02:23:14.289 --> 02:23:15.288
MY POINT OF VIEW.               
I'LL SPEAK FOR MYSELF.          
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET WHAT YOU 

02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:15.621
I'LL SPEAK FOR MYSELF.          
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET WHAT YOU 
NEED.                           

02:23:15.623 --> 02:23:18.425
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET WHAT YOU 
NEED.                           
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS OTHER     

02:23:18.427 --> 02:23:18.892
NEED.                           
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS OTHER     
CHALLENGE.                      

02:23:18.894 --> 02:23:22.228
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS OTHER     
CHALLENGE.                      
SO IF THE ENFORCEMENT HASN'T    

02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:25.731
CHALLENGE.                      
SO IF THE ENFORCEMENT HASN'T    
OCCURRED AND THAT WAS REDUCING  

02:23:25.733 --> 02:23:26.966
SO IF THE ENFORCEMENT HASN'T    
OCCURRED AND THAT WAS REDUCING  
FROM FOUR TO TWO AND THE ONLY   

02:23:26.968 --> 02:23:30.536
OCCURRED AND THAT WAS REDUCING  
FROM FOUR TO TWO AND THE ONLY   
REASON WHY THE FOUR GOT         

02:23:30.538 --> 02:23:31.370
FROM FOUR TO TWO AND THE ONLY   
REASON WHY THE FOUR GOT         
APPROVED WAS THE SECOND TIME IT 

02:23:31.372 --> 02:23:34.640
REASON WHY THE FOUR GOT         
APPROVED WAS THE SECOND TIME IT 
CAME TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION 

02:23:34.642 --> 02:23:35.308
APPROVED WAS THE SECOND TIME IT 
CAME TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
TWO TIMES PLANNING COMMISSION   

02:23:35.310 --> 02:23:38.178
CAME TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
TWO TIMES PLANNING COMMISSION   
HAD ALREADY DENIED THE REQUEST  

02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:39.045
TWO TIMES PLANNING COMMISSION   
HAD ALREADY DENIED THE REQUEST  
TO HAVE THE FOUR CURB CUTS.     

02:23:39.047 --> 02:23:42.182
HAD ALREADY DENIED THE REQUEST  
TO HAVE THE FOUR CURB CUTS.     
THEN IT CAME BACK AGAIN AND     

02:23:42.184 --> 02:23:42.949
TO HAVE THE FOUR CURB CUTS.     
THEN IT CAME BACK AGAIN AND     
THEN IT WENT TO CITY COUNCIL    

02:23:42.951 --> 02:23:46.619
THEN IT CAME BACK AGAIN AND     
THEN IT WENT TO CITY COUNCIL    
AND THAT LAST TIME IT WENT TO   

02:23:46.621 --> 02:23:47.354
THEN IT WENT TO CITY COUNCIL    
AND THAT LAST TIME IT WENT TO   
CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE THERE WAS  

02:23:47.356 --> 02:23:50.523
AND THAT LAST TIME IT WENT TO   
CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE THERE WAS  
A TENANT AND IT IS GOING TO BE  

02:23:50.525 --> 02:23:51.224
CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE THERE WAS  
A TENANT AND IT IS GOING TO BE  
DIFFICULT FOR THAT TENANT TO    

02:23:51.226 --> 02:23:53.193
A TENANT AND IT IS GOING TO BE  
DIFFICULT FOR THAT TENANT TO    
ACCESS THEIR APARTMENT IF THAT  

02:23:53.195 --> 02:23:57.263
DIFFICULT FOR THAT TENANT TO    
ACCESS THEIR APARTMENT IF THAT  
SPECIFIC CURB CUT WAS REMOVED,  

02:23:57.265 --> 02:23:58.097
ACCESS THEIR APARTMENT IF THAT  
SPECIFIC CURB CUT WAS REMOVED,  
A COUNCIL MEMBER CHANGED OR     

02:23:58.099 --> 02:24:01.735
SPECIFIC CURB CUT WAS REMOVED,  
A COUNCIL MEMBER CHANGED OR     
THEY VOTED IT WASN'T A SINGLE   

02:24:01.737 --> 02:24:02.001
A COUNCIL MEMBER CHANGED OR     
THEY VOTED IT WASN'T A SINGLE   
PERSON.                         

02:24:02.003 --> 02:24:02.835
THEY VOTED IT WASN'T A SINGLE   
PERSON.                         
SO I GUESS THE WHOLE COUNCIL    

02:24:02.837 --> 02:24:06.205
PERSON.

SO I GUESS THE WHOLE COUNCIL    
VOTED TO LEAVE THAT CURB CUT IN 
PLACE.

VOTED TO LEAVE THAT CURB CUT IN 
PLACE.                          
SO NOW IT'S BACK TO US AND IF

WHERE DOES GO THEN?             

02:24:16.551 --> 02:24:17.117
THE CURB CUT HAS TO BE REMOVED, 
WHERE DOES GO THEN?             
DOES IT STOP?

BECAUSE I DO LIVE TWO BLOCKS    

02:28:37.746 --> 02:28:41.647
PEOPLE WILL PARK ON ANYTHING

NOT WE'RE NOT JUST ATOMIZING    
THAT BUT THAT WE LOOK AT HOW    

02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:26.138
NOT WE'RE NOT JUST ATOMIZING    
THAT BUT THAT WE LOOK AT HOW    
THE MEETINGS ACTUALLY FLOW SO   

02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:27.239
THAT BUT THAT WE LOOK AT HOW    
THE MEETINGS ACTUALLY FLOW SO

ABOUT HOW THE ACTUAL MEETING    
RUNS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

RECOMMENDATION COMES OTHERWISE  
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE JUST GOING TO 
GET A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE
