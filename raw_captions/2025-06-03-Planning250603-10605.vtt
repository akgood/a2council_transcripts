SO LUXURY SHIFTS DEMOGRAPHICS

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:22.635
DISPLACES LONG TIME RESIDENTS.  
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK THIS     
WILL HAPPEN IN ANN ARBOR, IT

00:56:42.729 --> 00:56:43.527
HIGH END SCENARIOS THAT WE      
EXCEED THAT 80 PERCENT IN THE   
RELATIVELY NEAR FUTURE IF WE    

00:56:43.529 --> 00:56:47.198
EXCEED THAT 80 PERCENT IN THE

AND SO HOW WILL WE ADDRESS      
THOSE ISSUES?                   
WILL WE BUILD ANOTHER PIPE AND  

01:03:12.918 --> 01:03:13.784
THOSE ISSUES?                   
WILL WE BUILD ANOTHER PIPE AND  
IF WE BUILD ANOTHER PIPE, CAN   

01:03:13.786 --> 01:03:14.652
WILL WE BUILD ANOTHER PIPE AND  
IF WE BUILD ANOTHER PIPE, CAN   
THE TREATMENT PLANT TREAT IT IF 

01:03:14.654 --> 01:03:15.119
IF WE BUILD ANOTHER PIPE, CAN   
THE TREATMENT PLANT TREAT IT IF 
WE CAN GET IT THERE?            

01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:16.253
THE TREATMENT PLANT TREAT IT IF 
WE CAN GET IT THERE?            
SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS          

01:03:16.255 --> 01:03:16.954
WE CAN GET IT THERE?            
SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS          
OF QUESTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS    

01:03:16.956 --> 01:03:17.688
SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS          
OF QUESTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS    
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IN THESE 

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:23.528
OF QUESTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS    
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IN THESE 
DIFFERENT                       

01:03:37.009 --> 01:03:38.976
          STUDIES.              
SO TRY TO KEEP THIS REALLY HIGH 
LEVEL.                          

01:03:38.978 --> 01:03:39.776
SO TRY TO KEEP THIS REALLY HIGH 
LEVEL.                          
YOU CAN GO REALLY DEEP INTO THE 

01:03:39.778 --> 01:03:40.311
LEVEL.                          
YOU CAN GO REALLY DEEP INTO THE 
WEEDS REALLY QUICKLY.           

01:03:40.313 --> 01:03:41.111
YOU CAN GO REALLY DEEP INTO THE 
WEEDS REALLY QUICKLY.           
BUT THE TAKEAWAY IS HERE IS     

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:41.646
WEEDS REALLY QUICKLY.           
BUT THE TAKEAWAY IS HERE IS     
THAT THERE ARE EXISTING         

01:03:41.648 --> 01:03:42.313
BUT THE TAKEAWAY IS HERE IS     
THAT THERE ARE EXISTING         
CONSTRAINTS IN OUR UTILITY      

01:03:42.315 --> 01:03:43.180
THAT THERE ARE EXISTING         
CONSTRAINTS IN OUR UTILITY      
SYSTEMS THIS WE DON'T HAVE ALL  

01:03:43.182 --> 01:03:43.914
CONSTRAINTS IN OUR UTILITY      
SYSTEMS THIS WE DON'T HAVE ALL  
THE ANSWERS TO EVERY SINGLE ONE 

01:03:43.916 --> 01:03:44.415
SYSTEMS THIS WE DON'T HAVE ALL  
THE ANSWERS TO EVERY SINGLE ONE 
OF THOSE CONSTRAINTS.           

01:03:44.417 --> 01:03:45.149
THE ANSWERS TO EVERY SINGLE ONE 
OF THOSE CONSTRAINTS.           
THAT ANALYSIS WILL CONTINUE.    

01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:45.950
OF THOSE CONSTRAINTS.           
THAT ANALYSIS WILL CONTINUE.    
THERE IS CAPACITY FOR GROWTH    

01:03:45.952 --> 01:03:46.683
THAT ANALYSIS WILL CONTINUE.    
THERE IS CAPACITY FOR GROWTH    
BUT IT WILL DRIVE THE NEED FOR  

01:03:46.685 --> 01:03:47.284
THERE IS CAPACITY FOR GROWTH    
BUT IT WILL DRIVE THE NEED FOR  
MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE            

01:03:47.286 --> 01:03:47.952
BUT IT WILL DRIVE THE NEED FOR  
MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE            
INVESTMENTS PARTICULARLY LIKE   

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:48.619
MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE            
INVESTMENTS PARTICULARLY LIKE   
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE         

01:03:48.621 --> 01:03:49.220
INVESTMENTS PARTICULARLY LIKE   
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE         
INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT AND    

01:03:49.222 --> 01:03:49.954
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE         
INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT AND    
FUNDING STRATEGIES WILL BE      

01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:51.689
INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT AND    
FUNDING STRATEGIES WILL BE      
NEEDED SO THE CURRENT WAY THAT  

01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:55.225
FUNDING STRATEGIES WILL BE      
NEEDED SO THE CURRENT WAY THAT  
WE PLAN FOR REPAIRS OR          

01:03:55.227 --> 01:03:55.926
NEEDED SO THE CURRENT WAY THAT  
WE PLAN FOR REPAIRS OR          
REPLACEMENT OF IMPROVEMENTS TO  

01:03:55.928 --> 01:03:59.663
WE PLAN FOR REPAIRS OR          
REPLACEMENT OF IMPROVEMENTS TO  
OUR EXISTING SYSTEM CANNINESS   

01:03:59.665 --> 01:04:00.464
REPLACEMENT OF IMPROVEMENTS TO  
OUR EXISTING SYSTEM CANNINESS   
NECESSARILY FUND ALL FUTURE     

01:04:00.466 --> 01:04:03.133
OUR EXISTING SYSTEM CANNINESS   
NECESSARILY FUND ALL FUTURE     
NEEDS.

NECESSARILY FUND ALL FUTURE     
NEEDS.                          
SO WE HAVE A LITTLE TABLE HERE  

01:04:04.237 --> 01:04:07.305
NEEDS.                          
SO WE HAVE A LITTLE TABLE HERE  
THAT SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS AGAIN   

01:04:07.307 --> 01:04:07.838
SO WE HAVE A LITTLE TABLE HERE  
THAT SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS AGAIN   
THAT THERE ARE MAJOR            

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.706
THAT SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS AGAIN   
THAT THERE ARE MAJOR            
CONSTRAINTS ON THE SOURCE WATER 

01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:11.575
THAT THERE ARE MAJOR            
CONSTRAINTS ON THE SOURCE WATER 
SIDE ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND

ARE CONSTRAINTS ON THE WATER    

01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:19.016
TREATMENT SIDE WE KNOW THERE    
ARE CONSTRAINTS ON THE WATER    
SIDE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT        

01:04:19.018 --> 01:04:19.684
ARE CONSTRAINTS ON THE WATER

ANALYSIS IS NEEDED ON THE       
SANITARY WASTEWATER SIDE AND    

01:04:22.522 --> 01:04:23.387
ANALYSIS IS NEEDED ON THE       
SANITARY WASTEWATER SIDE AND    
WITH THAT I'LL TAKE QUESTIONS.  

01:04:23.389 --> 01:04:26.123
SANITARY WASTEWATER SIDE AND    
WITH THAT I'LL TAKE QUESTIONS.  
GREAT.

GREAT.                          
I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE      
BENCHMARK TO COMPARE THOSE      

01:04:37.236 --> 01:04:38.001
I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE      
BENCHMARK TO COMPARE THOSE      
GROWTH RATES AGAINST YOUR TWO   

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:38.302
BENCHMARK TO COMPARE THOSE      
GROWTH RATES AGAINST YOUR TWO   
CHARTS.                         

01:04:38.304 --> 01:04:41.939
GROWTH RATES AGAINST YOUR TWO   
CHARTS.

SHAPE AND HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED  
AGAINST A SIM CARD RATE THAT WE 
KNOW FROM PLANNING DATA IS NOT

AGAINST A SIM CARD RATE THAT WE 
KNOW FROM PLANNING DATA IS NOT  
ACCURATE.

ACCURATE.                       
IT'S OFF BY FOUR HUNDRED

IT'S OFF BY FOUR HUNDRED        
PERCENT COMPARED TO THE RATE    
THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY.        

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:01.025
PERCENT COMPARED TO THE RATE    
THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY.        
LOOK, WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO   

01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:01.959
THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY.        
LOOK, WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO   
BECAUSE I GUESS MY INITIAL

LOOK, WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO   
BECAUSE I GUESS MY INITIAL      
REACTION WAS WE'RE GOING TO BE

BECAUSE I GUESS MY INITIAL      
REACTION WAS WE'RE GOING TO BE  
IN THE SAME WOULD BE FACING A

REACTION WAS WE'RE GOING TO BE  
IN THE SAME WOULD BE FACING A   
LOT OF THE SAME CONSTRAINTS

NUMBER INSTEAD OF TWO HUNDRED   
WHICH WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE 
850 IS THE NUMBER BECAUSE       

01:05:21.914 --> 01:05:24.982
WHICH WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE 
850 IS THE NUMBER BECAUSE       
THAT'S HOW WE'RE BUILDING TODAY 

01:05:24.984 --> 01:05:25.182
850 IS THE NUMBER BECAUSE       
THAT'S HOW WE'RE BUILDING TODAY 
.                               

01:05:25.184 --> 01:05:26.250
THAT'S HOW WE'RE BUILDING TODAY

.                               
>> I MEAN WHAT'S YOUR REACTION  
TO THAT?                        

01:05:26.652 --> 01:05:28.518
>> I MEAN WHAT'S YOUR REACTION  
TO THAT?                        
YEAH I WILL SAY THE SECOND      

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.186
TO THAT?                        
YEAH I WILL SAY THE SECOND      
GROWTH PROJECTIONS THAT WERE    

01:05:29.188 --> 01:05:29.986
YEAH I WILL SAY THE SECOND      
GROWTH PROJECTIONS THAT WERE    
USED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WAS   

01:05:29.988 --> 01:05:32.756
GROWTH PROJECTIONS THAT WERE    
USED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WAS   
AT A DIFFERENT MOMENT WHERE WE  

01:05:32.758 --> 01:05:33.424
USED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WAS   
AT A DIFFERENT MOMENT WHERE WE  
WERE NOT BUILDING CONSISTENTLY  

01:05:33.426 --> 01:05:36.827
AT A DIFFERENT MOMENT WHERE WE  
WERE NOT BUILDING CONSISTENTLY  
AT THAT RATE AND SO THAT I      

01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:40.530
WERE NOT BUILDING CONSISTENTLY  
AT THAT RATE AND SO THAT I      
UNDERSTAND I TOTALLY AGREE THAT 

01:05:40.532 --> 01:05:41.331
AT THAT RATE AND SO THAT I      
UNDERSTAND I TOTALLY AGREE THAT 
WE ARE BUILDING AT A HIGHER     

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:43.800
UNDERSTAND I TOTALLY AGREE THAT 
WE ARE BUILDING AT A HIGHER     
RATE RIGHT NOW BUT WE ALSO KNOW 

01:05:43.802 --> 01:05:44.535
WE ARE BUILDING AT A HIGHER     
RATE RIGHT NOW BUT WE ALSO KNOW 
THAT DEVELOPMENT ISN'T LINEAR   

01:05:44.537 --> 01:05:47.471
RATE RIGHT NOW BUT WE ALSO KNOW 
THAT DEVELOPMENT ISN'T LINEAR   
AND SO A LOT OF THIS IS MAKING  

01:05:47.473 --> 01:05:48.138
THAT DEVELOPMENT ISN'T LINEAR   
AND SO A LOT OF THIS IS MAKING  
SOME ASSUMPTIONS AND GUESSES    

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:48.872
AND SO A LOT OF THIS IS MAKING  
SOME ASSUMPTIONS AND GUESSES    
ABOUT THE INTENSITY OF A        

01:05:48.874 --> 01:05:51.975
SOME ASSUMPTIONS AND GUESSES    
ABOUT THE INTENSITY OF A        
DEVELOPMENT AND HOW THAT WILL   

01:05:51.977 --> 01:05:52.376

HAPPEN.                         

01:05:52.378 --> 01:05:53.043

HAPPEN.                         
BUT YES, YOU ARE RIGHT THERE

THAT'S FINE.                    
YEAH, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE     
DONE THE ANALYSIS.

YEAH, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE     
DONE THE ANALYSIS.              
WE COULD LOOK INTO THAT BUT WE  

01:06:05.491 --> 01:06:07.157
DONE THE ANALYSIS.              
WE COULD LOOK INTO THAT BUT WE  
HAVE NOT DONE AT EIGHT FIFTY

REALLY HYPER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS 
AS YOU WERE GOING THROUGH ON    
THE WHAT WATER TREATMENT SIDE   

01:06:53.906 --> 01:06:58.109
AS YOU WERE GOING THROUGH ON    
THE WHAT WATER TREATMENT SIDE   
WHERE COULD WE ARE YOU HAVE YOU 

01:06:58.111 --> 01:06:58.776
THE WHAT WATER TREATMENT SIDE   
WHERE COULD WE ARE YOU HAVE YOU 
BEEN LOOKING INTO WHERE WE      

01:06:58.778 --> 01:06:59.510
WHERE COULD WE ARE YOU HAVE YOU 
BEEN LOOKING INTO WHERE WE      
COULD BE EXPANDING CAPACITY     

01:06:59.512 --> 01:07:02.012
BEEN LOOKING INTO WHERE WE      
COULD BE EXPANDING CAPACITY     
SINCE IT SOUNDS LIKE WE CANNOT  

01:07:02.014 --> 01:07:02.713
COULD BE EXPANDING CAPACITY     
SINCE IT SOUNDS LIKE WE CANNOT  
EXPAND IT TO THE CURRENT SITE?  

01:07:02.715 --> 01:07:04.915
SINCE IT SOUNDS LIKE WE CANNOT  
EXPAND IT TO THE CURRENT SITE?  
WOULD IT BE A SECOND PLANT      

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:08.786
EXPAND IT TO THE CURRENT SITE?  
WOULD IT BE A SECOND PLANT      
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE HI MOLLY    

01:07:08.788 --> 01:07:09.520
WOULD IT BE A SECOND PLANT      
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE HI MOLLY    
MOCHIZUKI WATER TREATMENT

SO TWO THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK   

01:07:13.726 --> 01:07:16.360
SERVICES MANAGER.               
SO TWO THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK   
FIRST AT THE TREATMENT PLANT    

01:07:16.362 --> 01:07:17.428
SO TWO THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK   
FIRST AT THE TREATMENT PLANT    
AND SO YES WE ARE SPACE LIMITED 

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.897
FIRST AT THE TREATMENT PLANT    
AND SO YES WE ARE SPACE LIMITED 
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS THAT    

01:07:19.899 --> 01:07:20.698
AND SO YES WE ARE SPACE LIMITED 
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS THAT    
NICE GREEN GRASSY AREA THAT     

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.431
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS THAT    
NICE GREEN GRASSY AREA THAT     
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ALL SORTS    

01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:23.466
NICE GREEN GRASSY AREA THAT     
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ALL SORTS    
OF SPACE THAT'S ACTUALLY A SIX  

01:07:23.468 --> 01:07:24.168
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ALL SORTS    
OF SPACE THAT'S ACTUALLY A SIX  
MILLION GALLON UNDERGROUND      

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.702
OF SPACE THAT'S ACTUALLY A SIX  
MILLION GALLON UNDERGROUND      
STORAGE RESERVOIR.              

01:07:24.704 --> 01:07:28.572
MILLION GALLON UNDERGROUND      
STORAGE RESERVOIR.              
SO WE CANNOT BUILD ON TOP       

01:07:28.574 --> 01:07:28.972
STORAGE RESERVOIR.              
SO WE CANNOT BUILD ON TOP       
OF THAT.                        

01:07:28.974 --> 01:07:31.741
SO WE CANNOT BUILD ON TOP       
OF THAT.                        
WE HAVE LOOKED AT DIFFERENT     

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:32.209
OF THAT.                        
WE HAVE LOOKED AT DIFFERENT     
TYPES OF TREATMENT.             

01:07:32.211 --> 01:07:33.176
WE HAVE LOOKED AT DIFFERENT     
TYPES OF TREATMENT.             
WHAT COULD WE FIT IN THIS       

01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:33.577
TYPES OF TREATMENT.             
WHAT COULD WE FIT IN THIS       
FOOTPRINT?                      

01:07:33.579 --> 01:07:36.046
WHAT COULD WE FIT IN THIS       
FOOTPRINT?                      
BUT NOTHING HAS SHOWN THAT WE   

01:07:36.048 --> 01:07:36.714
FOOTPRINT?                      
BUT NOTHING HAS SHOWN THAT WE   
CAN ACTUALLY EXPAND CAPACITY.   

01:07:36.716 --> 01:07:37.747
BUT NOTHING HAS SHOWN THAT WE   
CAN ACTUALLY EXPAND CAPACITY.   
SO WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT A   

01:07:37.749 --> 01:07:40.283
CAN ACTUALLY EXPAND CAPACITY.   
SO WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT A   
WHOLE NEW LOCATION AS FAR AS    

01:07:40.285 --> 01:07:40.951
SO WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT A

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:44.922
LIMITED STEER FARM AND WE'RE    
LIMITED TO THE RIVER.           
SO WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK        

01:07:44.924 --> 01:07:48.225
LIMITED TO THE RIVER.           
SO WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK        
PROBABLY TO THE NORTH FOR       

01:07:48.227 --> 01:07:51.561
SO WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK

THE SCENARIO WE WOULD NEED TO

THE SCENARIO WE WOULD NEED TO

FUNDING FOR THIS IS A BIT       
CHICKEN AND EGG.                
IS THAT YOU YOU CAN'T BUILD IT  

01:12:17.095 --> 01:12:17.628
CHICKEN AND EGG.                
IS THAT YOU YOU CAN'T BUILD IT

01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:18.628
IS THAT YOU YOU CAN'T BUILD IT

YOU NEED TO BUILD IT KNOWING    
THEY WILL COME BECAUSE THEY     

01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:22.065
YOU NEED TO BUILD IT KNOWING    
THEY WILL COME BECAUSE THEY     
HAVE TO BUY INTO THE SYSTEM AND 

01:12:22.067 --> 01:12:22.466
THEY WILL COME BECAUSE THEY     
HAVE TO BUY INTO THE SYSTEM AND

PAY FOR IT.                     
WE WE CAN'T FUND FULL GROWTH.   
WE CAN FUND IMPROVEMENTS AND    

01:12:29.075 --> 01:12:29.873
WE WE CAN'T FUND FULL GROWTH.   
WE CAN FUND IMPROVEMENTS AND    
REPAIRS TO EXISTING SYSTEM WITH

SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO FIX THE

SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO FIX THE 
CURRENT SYSTEM.                 
THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO        

01:12:40.386 --> 01:12:41.318
CURRENT SYSTEM.                 
THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO        
CAREFULLY PLAN TO FIGURE OUT    

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:41.951
THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO        
CAREFULLY PLAN TO FIGURE OUT    
WHEN IS THE TIME COME THAT WE   

01:12:41.953 --> 01:12:44.120
CAREFULLY PLAN TO FIGURE OUT    
WHEN IS THE TIME COME THAT WE   
NOW NEED TO START PLANNING FOR  

01:12:44.122 --> 01:12:44.821
WHEN IS THE TIME COME THAT WE   
NOW NEED TO START PLANNING FOR  
EXPANSION TO ACCOMMODATE WHAT

ARE THERE SIMILAR CONSTRAINTS

01:13:01.373 --> 01:13:02.172
ARE THERE SIMILAR CONSTRAINTS

TAKE OUT OF GROUNDWATER OR IS   

01:13:02.174 --> 01:13:03.573
ON WHAT WE COULD EVENTUALLY     
TAKE OUT OF GROUNDWATER OR IS   
IT JUST A MATTER OF FINDING A   

01:13:03.575 --> 01:13:07.244
TAKE OUT OF GROUNDWATER OR IS   
IT JUST A MATTER OF FINDING A   
NEW SITE TO SINK A WELL, IF I   

01:13:07.246 --> 01:13:08.044
IT JUST A MATTER OF FINDING A

01:13:11.883 --> 01:13:14.817
>> I JUST WANT TO EXPAND ON     
WHAT SIZE A LITTLE BIT.         
SO WE ARE IN THE PLANNING       

01:13:14.819 --> 01:13:15.619
WHAT SIZE A LITTLE BIT.         
SO WE ARE IN THE PLANNING       
STAGES TO REPLACE THAT OLDEST   

01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:17.954
SO WE ARE IN THE PLANNING       
STAGES TO REPLACE THAT OLDEST   
PORTION OF THE PLANT AND SO WE  

01:13:17.956 --> 01:13:18.755
STAGES TO REPLACE THAT OLDEST   
PORTION OF THE PLANT AND SO WE  
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT 

01:13:18.757 --> 01:13:22.058
PORTION OF THE PLANT AND SO WE  
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT 
AND WE WOULD WANT TO MAYBE      

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:22.926
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT 
AND WE WOULD WANT TO MAYBE      
CONSIDER IF WE THINK THAT THE   

01:13:22.928 --> 01:13:25.729
AND WE WOULD WANT TO MAYBE      
CONSIDER IF WE THINK THAT THE   
FUTURE GROWTH IS COMING SOONER  

01:13:25.731 --> 01:13:26.663
CONSIDER IF WE THINK THAT THE   
FUTURE GROWTH IS COMING SOONER  
TO CHANGE DIRECTION OR CONSIDER 

01:13:26.665 --> 01:13:30.567
FUTURE GROWTH IS COMING SOONER  
TO CHANGE DIRECTION OR CONSIDER 
THAT SOONER RATHER THAN BUILD A 

01:13:30.569 --> 01:13:33.836
TO CHANGE DIRECTION OR CONSIDER 
THAT SOONER RATHER THAN BUILD A 
NEW PLANT AND THEN BEFORE       

01:13:33.838 --> 01:13:34.238
THAT SOONER RATHER THAN BUILD A 
NEW PLANT AND THEN BEFORE       
AUGUST ANOTHER.                 

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.841
NEW PLANT AND THEN BEFORE       
AUGUST ANOTHER.                 
YEAH, BECAUSE EVERYTHING TAKES  

01:13:37.843 --> 01:13:38.541
AUGUST ANOTHER.                 
YEAH, BECAUSE EVERYTHING TAKES  
A REALLY LONG TIME.             

01:13:38.543 --> 01:13:45.449
YEAH, BECAUSE EVERYTHING TAKES  
A REALLY LONG TIME.             
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS WE   

01:13:59.396 --> 01:14:01.431
ACTUALLY DID OUR FIRST          
EVALUATION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN   
AND THEN WE CAME BACK IN TWENTY 

01:14:01.433 --> 01:14:02.165
EVALUATION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN   
AND THEN WE CAME BACK IN TWENTY 
TWENTY ONE AND TOOK THIS TO     

01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:02.899
AND THEN WE CAME BACK IN TWENTY 
TWENTY ONE AND TOOK THIS TO     
COUNCIL AGAIN AND ASKED THEM TO 

01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:03.634
TWENTY ONE AND TOOK THIS TO     
COUNCIL AGAIN AND ASKED THEM TO 
LOOK AT THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAD 

01:14:03.636 --> 01:14:04.434
COUNCIL AGAIN AND ASKED THEM TO 
LOOK AT THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAD 
AT THE TABLE AT THAT TIME AND   

01:14:04.436 --> 01:14:05.102
LOOK AT THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAD 
AT THE TABLE AT THAT TIME AND   
THEY MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO   

01:14:05.104 --> 01:14:05.902
AT THE TABLE AT THAT TIME AND   
THEY MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO   
MOVE FORWARD WITH REPLACING THE 

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:06.236
THEY MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO   
MOVE FORWARD WITH REPLACING THE 
PLANT.                          

01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:06.903
MOVE FORWARD WITH REPLACING THE 
PLANT.                          
SO THAT SAID THAT JUST SHOWS    

01:14:06.905 --> 01:14:07.638
PLANT.                          
SO THAT SAID THAT JUST SHOWS    
YOU HOW LONG THAT IT ALL TAKES  

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:08.438
SO THAT SAID THAT JUST SHOWS    
YOU HOW LONG THAT IT ALL TAKES  
SO WE WOULD HOPEFULLY WANT TO   

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.105
YOU HOW LONG THAT IT ALL TAKES  
SO WE WOULD HOPEFULLY WANT TO   
START THAT PROCESS SOONER       

01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:09.840
SO WE WOULD HOPEFULLY WANT TO   
START THAT PROCESS SOONER       
RATHER THAN LATER AS FAR AS     

01:14:09.842 --> 01:14:10.507
START THAT PROCESS SOONER       
RATHER THAN LATER AS FAR AS     
SOURCE WE DO KNOW WE'VE DONE    

01:14:10.509 --> 01:14:12.075
RATHER THAN LATER AS FAR AS     
SOURCE WE DO KNOW WE'VE DONE    
SOME INITIAL STUDIES DOWN AT    

01:14:12.077 --> 01:14:13.076
SOURCE WE DO KNOW WE'VE DONE    
SOME INITIAL STUDIES DOWN AT    
OUR EXISTING WELL FIELD AND WE  

01:14:13.078 --> 01:14:13.910
SOME INITIAL STUDIES DOWN AT    
OUR EXISTING WELL FIELD AND WE  
KNOW THAT WE ARE LIMITED DOWN   

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:15.278
OUR EXISTING WELL FIELD AND WE  
KNOW THAT WE ARE LIMITED DOWN   
THERE.                          

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.346
KNOW THAT WE ARE LIMITED DOWN   
THERE.                          
WE CAN GET A LITTLE BIT MORE    

01:14:16.348 --> 01:14:17.080
THERE.                          
WE CAN GET A LITTLE BIT MORE    
LIKE I WAS SAYING EARLIER BUT   

01:14:17.082 --> 01:14:19.816
WE CAN GET A LITTLE BIT MORE    
LIKE I WAS SAYING EARLIER BUT   
NOT A LOT MORE NOT MAYBE WHAT   

01:14:19.818 --> 01:14:23.086
LIKE I WAS SAYING EARLIER BUT   
NOT A LOT MORE NOT MAYBE WHAT   
WE WOULD NEED FOR THE THE HIGH  

01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:24.187
NOT A LOT MORE NOT MAYBE WHAT   
WE WOULD NEED FOR THE THE HIGH  
END, MAYBE NOT EVEN THE LOW     

01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.454
WE WOULD NEED FOR THE THE HIGH  
END, MAYBE NOT EVEN THE LOW     
END.                            

01:14:24.456 --> 01:14:25.322
END, MAYBE NOT EVEN THE LOW     
END.                            
SO THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO   

01:14:25.324 --> 01:14:27.724
END.                            
SO THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO   
LOOK SOMEWHERE AND WE KNOW WE   

01:14:27.726 --> 01:14:28.524
SO THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO   
LOOK SOMEWHERE AND WE KNOW WE   
CAN'T LOOK WEST BECAUSE OF THE  

01:14:28.526 --> 01:14:28.992
LOOK SOMEWHERE AND WE KNOW WE   
CAN'T LOOK WEST BECAUSE OF THE  
GALMAN PLUME.                   

01:14:28.994 --> 01:14:31.427
CAN'T LOOK WEST BECAUSE OF THE  
GALMAN PLUME.                   
SO THAT HAS REALLY LIMITED US   

01:14:31.429 --> 01:14:32.262
GALMAN PLUME.                   
SO THAT HAS REALLY LIMITED US   
IN OUR ABILITY TO PULL FROM     

01:14:32.264 --> 01:14:35.566
SO THAT HAS REALLY LIMITED US   
IN OUR ABILITY TO PULL FROM     
GROUNDWATER SO THAT'S WHY I     

01:14:35.568 --> 01:14:36.366
IN OUR ABILITY TO PULL FROM     
GROUNDWATER SO THAT'S WHY I     
SAID WE'D PROBABLY BE LOOKING   

01:14:36.368 --> 01:14:38.635
GROUNDWATER SO THAT'S WHY I     
SAID WE'D PROBABLY BE LOOKING   
NORTHEAST SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH  

01:14:38.637 --> 01:14:39.436
SAID WE'D PROBABLY BE LOOKING   
NORTHEAST SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH  
WOULD MEAN GOING OUT AND BUYING 

01:14:39.438 --> 01:14:42.072
NORTHEAST SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH  
WOULD MEAN GOING OUT AND BUYING 
SOME LAND TO BE ABLE TO SINK    

01:14:42.074 --> 01:14:42.939
WOULD MEAN GOING OUT AND BUYING 
SOME LAND TO BE ABLE TO SINK    
WELL AND DRAW WATER POTENTIALLY 

01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:46.409
SOME LAND TO BE ABLE TO SINK    
WELL AND DRAW WATER POTENTIALLY 
IT MEAN SOME KIND OF REGIONAL   

01:14:46.411 --> 01:14:50.113
WELL AND DRAW WATER POTENTIALLY 
IT MEAN SOME KIND OF REGIONAL   
COLLABORATION NEGOTIATION YOU   

01:14:50.115 --> 01:14:51.114
IT MEAN SOME KIND OF REGIONAL   
COLLABORATION NEGOTIATION YOU   
WE HAVE NOT WE DID THIS         

01:14:51.116 --> 01:14:51.781
COLLABORATION NEGOTIATION YOU   
WE HAVE NOT WE DID THIS         
EVALUATION BACK IN TWENTY       

01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:54.183
WE HAVE NOT WE DID THIS         
EVALUATION BACK IN TWENTY       
FOURTEEN.                       

01:14:54.185 --> 01:14:55.318
EVALUATION BACK IN TWENTY       
FOURTEEN.                       
WE DID LOOK AT WHERE WE COULD   

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.052
FOURTEEN.                       
WE DID LOOK AT WHERE WE COULD   
POTENTIALLY LOOK AND SO I'M     

01:14:56.054 --> 01:14:58.388
WE DID LOOK AT WHERE WE COULD   
POTENTIALLY LOOK AND SO I'M     
BASING IT ON THAT ALL OF THESE  

01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:59.289
POTENTIALLY LOOK AND SO I'M     
BASING IT ON THAT ALL OF THESE  
STUDIES WOULD REALLY NEED TO BE 

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:00.056
BASING IT ON THAT ALL OF THESE

SOME STUDIO APARTMENTS,         
THERE'LL BE ONE OR OR YOU MIGHT 
HAVE LARGER UNITS THAT HAVE     

01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:03.673
THERE'LL BE ONE OR OR YOU MIGHT 
HAVE LARGER UNITS THAT HAVE     
MANY MORE THAN THAT AND SO IT'S 

01:18:03.675 --> 01:18:04.807
HAVE LARGER UNITS THAT HAVE     
MANY MORE THAN THAT AND SO IT'S 
THAT IS WHAT IS THERE ANYTHING  

01:18:04.809 --> 01:18:08.077
MANY MORE THAN THAT AND SO IT'S 
THAT IS WHAT IS THERE ANYTHING  
ELSE YOU'VE HAD THERE, ISN'T    

01:18:08.079 --> 01:18:08.344
THAT IS WHAT IS THERE ANYTHING  
ELSE YOU'VE HAD THERE, ISN'T    
IT?                             

01:18:08.346 --> 01:18:09.479
ELSE YOU'VE HAD THERE, ISN'T    
IT?                             
I MEAN AT LEAST THIS IS NOW     

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:12.715
IT?                             
I MEAN AT LEAST THIS IS NOW     
DATING AND AGAIN I KNOW ENOUGH  

01:18:12.717 --> 01:18:15.318
I MEAN AT LEAST THIS IS NOW     
DATING AND AGAIN I KNOW ENOUGH  
TO BE DANGEROUS BUT I FEEL LIKE 

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.052
DATING AND AGAIN I KNOW ENOUGH  
TO BE DANGEROUS BUT I FEEL LIKE 
THERE WAS HUGE CONTROVERSY A    

01:18:16.054 --> 01:18:19.255
TO BE DANGEROUS BUT I FEEL LIKE 
THERE WAS HUGE CONTROVERSY A    
FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT WATER RATES 

01:18:19.257 --> 01:18:22.692
THERE WAS HUGE CONTROVERSY A    
FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT WATER RATES 
AND HOW IT'S DISTRIBUTED        

01:18:22.694 --> 01:18:23.559
FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT WATER RATES 
AND HOW IT'S DISTRIBUTED        
BETWEEN BETWEEN SINGLE FAMILY   

01:18:23.561 --> 01:18:27.363
AND HOW IT'S DISTRIBUTED        
BETWEEN BETWEEN SINGLE FAMILY   
AND MULTIFAMILY RESIDENCES AND  

01:18:27.365 --> 01:18:28.364
BETWEEN BETWEEN SINGLE FAMILY   
AND MULTIFAMILY RESIDENCES AND  
ALSO THE IDEA THAT LIKE WHO WAS 

01:18:28.366 --> 01:18:31.601
AND MULTIFAMILY RESIDENCES AND  
ALSO THE IDEA THAT LIKE WHO WAS 
THERE WHO WATERS THEIR LAWN AND 

01:18:31.603 --> 01:18:35.071
ALSO THE IDEA THAT LIKE WHO WAS 
THERE WHO WATERS THEIR LAWN AND 
WASHES CARS AND THE LIKE.       

01:18:35.073 --> 01:18:36.239
THERE WHO WATERS THEIR LAWN AND 
WASHES CARS AND THE LIKE.       
AND I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS IF     

01:18:36.241 --> 01:18:38.942
WASHES CARS AND THE LIKE.       
AND I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS IF     
FIRST WALL IF THAT'S IF I'M     

01:18:38.944 --> 01:18:39.476
AND I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS IF     
FIRST WALL IF THAT'S IF I'M     
REMEMBERING RIGHT.              

01:18:39.478 --> 01:18:40.177
FIRST WALL IF THAT'S IF I'M     
REMEMBERING RIGHT.              
BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY COVID I   

01:18:40.179 --> 01:18:42.312
REMEMBERING RIGHT.              
BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY COVID I   
KIND OF THINK AND SO GOODNESS   

01:18:42.314 --> 01:18:43.246
BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY COVID I   
KIND OF THINK AND SO GOODNESS   
KNOWS AND SECOND OF ALL LIKE    

01:18:43.248 --> 01:18:46.582
KIND OF THINK AND SO GOODNESS

KNOWS AND SECOND OF ALL LIKE    
HOW DOES THAT FACTOR IN BECAUSE 
I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING      

01:18:47.252 --> 01:18:50.286
HOW DOES THAT FACTOR IN BECAUSE 
I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING      
ABOUT HERE IS ALSO A SHIFT IN   

01:18:50.288 --> 01:18:51.087
I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING      
ABOUT HERE IS ALSO A SHIFT IN   
THE KINDS OF UNITS AND PARTIC   

01:18:51.089 --> 01:18:51.421
ABOUT HERE IS ALSO A SHIFT IN   
THE KINDS OF UNITS AND PARTIC   
YEAH.                           

01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:55.391
THE KINDS OF UNITS AND PARTIC   
YEAH.                           
>> YEAH YEAH I WOULD FEEL LIKE  

01:18:55.393 --> 01:18:58.195

YES.                            
>> SO I WOULD SAY LIKE I GO     
BACK TO AGAIN MORE STUDIES BE   

01:19:02.066 --> 01:19:03.032
>> SO I WOULD SAY LIKE I GO     
BACK TO AGAIN MORE STUDIES BE   
NEEDED BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT  

01:19:03.034 --> 01:19:03.733
BACK TO AGAIN MORE STUDIES BE   
NEEDED BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT  
WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK WE DO     

01:19:03.735 --> 01:19:06.570
NEEDED BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT  
WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK WE DO     
KNOW THAT SINCE WE MOVED TO A   

01:19:06.572 --> 01:19:07.370
WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK WE DO     
KNOW THAT SINCE WE MOVED TO A   
DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURE MANY   

01:19:07.372 --> 01:19:10.373
KNOW THAT SINCE WE MOVED TO A   
DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURE MANY   
YEARS AGO THAT WE'VE SEEN OUR   

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:11.107
DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURE MANY   
YEARS AGO THAT WE'VE SEEN OUR   
AVERAGE PER CAPITA USE GO DOWN  

01:19:11.109 --> 01:19:13.710
YEARS AGO THAT WE'VE SEEN OUR   
AVERAGE PER CAPITA USE GO DOWN  
QUITE A BIT SO PEOPLE ARE USING 

01:19:13.712 --> 01:19:14.244
AVERAGE PER CAPITA USE GO DOWN  
QUITE A BIT SO PEOPLE ARE USING 
A LOT LESS WATER.               

01:19:14.246 --> 01:19:17.881
QUITE A BIT SO PEOPLE ARE USING 
A LOT LESS WATER.               
WE WE APPRECIATE THAT WE PUT    

01:19:17.883 --> 01:19:21.083
A LOT LESS WATER.               
WE WE APPRECIATE THAT WE PUT    
CONSERVATION MEASURES IN PLACE  

01:19:21.085 --> 01:19:21.284
WE WE APPRECIATE THAT WE PUT    
CONSERVATION MEASURES IN PLACE  
.                               

01:19:21.286 --> 01:19:22.152
CONSERVATION MEASURES IN PLACE  
.                               
WE ALSO NEED THOUGH TO GENERATE 

01:19:22.154 --> 01:19:22.985
.                               
WE ALSO NEED THOUGH TO GENERATE 
ENOUGH REVENUE TO KEEP UP OUR   

01:19:22.987 --> 01:19:25.555
WE ALSO NEED THOUGH TO GENERATE 
ENOUGH REVENUE TO KEEP UP OUR   
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE       

01:19:25.557 --> 01:19:26.355
ENOUGH REVENUE TO KEEP UP OUR   
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE       
INFRASTRUCTURE NERDS AND WE WE  

01:19:26.357 --> 01:19:28.524
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE       
INFRASTRUCTURE NERDS AND WE WE  
NEED TO WELL IN GROWTH I MEAN   

01:19:28.526 --> 01:19:29.325
INFRASTRUCTURE NERDS AND WE WE  
NEED TO WELL IN GROWTH I MEAN   
THIS IS EFFICIENCY IMPROVING    

01:19:29.327 --> 01:19:32.895
NEED TO WELL IN GROWTH I MEAN   
THIS IS EFFICIENCY IMPROVING    
CAN MEET ADDITIONAL GROWTH AND  

01:19:32.897 --> 01:19:33.630
THIS IS EFFICIENCY IMPROVING    
CAN MEET ADDITIONAL GROWTH AND  
SO THOSE ARE COMPLEMENTARY IN   

01:19:33.632 --> 01:19:36.799
CAN MEET ADDITIONAL GROWTH AND  
SO THOSE ARE COMPLEMENTARY IN   
SOME WAYS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS  

01:19:36.801 --> 01:19:37.534
SO THOSE ARE COMPLEMENTARY IN   
SOME WAYS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS  
ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WENT 

01:19:37.536 --> 01:19:40.202
SOME WAYS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS  
ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WENT 
INTO HERE IS THAT USING A       

01:19:40.204 --> 01:19:41.003
ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WENT 
INTO HERE IS THAT USING A       
MULTIPLIER FOR A SINGLE FAMILY  

01:19:41.005 --> 01:19:44.106
INTO HERE IS THAT USING A       
MULTIPLIER FOR A SINGLE FAMILY  
OR IS THAT USING THE MULTIPLIER 

01:19:44.108 --> 01:19:45.175
MULTIPLIER FOR A SINGLE FAMILY  
OR IS THAT USING THE MULTIPLIER 
FOR MULTIFAMILY OR IS IT KIND   

01:19:45.177 --> 01:19:45.775
OR IS THAT USING THE MULTIPLIER 
FOR MULTIFAMILY OR IS IT KIND   
OF A BLENDED BECAUSE AGAIN      

01:19:45.777 --> 01:19:48.912
FOR MULTIFAMILY OR IS IT KIND   
OF A BLENDED BECAUSE AGAIN      
THAT'S I THINK THAT THAT WE'RE  

01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:52.448
OF A BLENDED BECAUSE AGAIN      
THAT'S I THINK THAT THAT WE'RE  
ANTICIPATING A SHIFT IN THE     

01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:53.382
THAT'S I THINK THAT THAT WE'RE  
ANTICIPATING A SHIFT IN THE     
KIND OF UNITS THAT WILL HAVE WE 

01:19:53.384 --> 01:19:55.351
ANTICIPATING A SHIFT IN THE     
KIND OF UNITS THAT WILL HAVE WE 
ARE AND I WILL LET OUR

KIND OF UNITS THAT WILL HAVE WE 
ARE AND I WILL LET OUR          
CONSULTANTS MAYBE SPEAK TO

I WILL SAY THAT IN GENERAL      
THOUGH IN PLANNING FOR THIS     
SORT OF THING YOU CAN IMAGINE   

01:20:00.291 --> 01:20:00.923
THOUGH IN PLANNING FOR THIS     
SORT OF THING YOU CAN IMAGINE   
THAT WE ARE CONSERVATIVE        

01:20:00.925 --> 01:20:03.927
SORT OF THING YOU CAN IMAGINE   
THAT WE ARE CONSERVATIVE        
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PLAN FOR THE  

01:20:03.929 --> 01:20:04.727
THAT WE ARE CONSERVATIVE        
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PLAN FOR THE

I'M SAHM ADVISORS.              
I WILL SAY AT LEAST ON THE      
WATER SIDE AND I BELIEVE ON THE 

01:20:15.373 --> 01:20:16.039
I WILL SAY AT LEAST ON THE      
WATER SIDE AND I BELIEVE ON THE 
SEMATARY SIDE IT'S REALLY       

01:20:16.041 --> 01:20:19.642
WATER SIDE AND I BELIEVE ON THE 
SEMATARY SIDE IT'S REALLY       
REFLECTIVE OF AVERAGE IN THE    

01:20:19.644 --> 01:20:20.176
SEMATARY SIDE IT'S REALLY       
REFLECTIVE OF AVERAGE IN THE    
CITY RIGHT NOW.

REFLECTIVE OF AVERAGE IN THE    
CITY RIGHT NOW.                 
SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH LOOKED AT 

01:20:23.015 --> 01:20:24.147
CITY RIGHT NOW.                 
SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH LOOKED AT 
THE USE PER PERSON THE KIND     

01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:26.750
SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH LOOKED AT 
THE USE PER PERSON THE KIND     
OF PEAKING FACTOR WE SEE ON     

01:20:26.752 --> 01:20:27.750
THE USE PER PERSON THE KIND     
OF PEAKING FACTOR WE SEE ON     
THAT USE AND THAT IS WHAT WE    

01:20:27.752 --> 01:20:30.920
OF PEAKING FACTOR WE SEE ON     
THAT USE AND THAT IS WHAT WE    
PROJECTED I THINK IN THE WATER  

01:20:30.922 --> 01:20:34.390
THAT USE AND THAT IS WHAT WE    
PROJECTED I THINK IN THE WATER  
PLAN PLAN THEY USE A BIT        

01:20:34.392 --> 01:20:35.125
PROJECTED I THINK IN THE WATER  
PLAN PLAN THEY USE A BIT        
DIFFERENT NUMBERS ORIGINALLY SO 

01:20:35.127 --> 01:20:38.661
PLAN PLAN THEY USE A BIT        
DIFFERENT NUMBERS ORIGINALLY SO 
THAT THEY'RE NOT TOTALLY IN     

01:20:38.663 --> 01:20:39.596
DIFFERENT NUMBERS ORIGINALLY SO 
THAT THEY'RE NOT TOTALLY IN     
LINE AND WE KIND OF NEED TO GET 

01:20:39.598 --> 01:20:42.765
THAT THEY'RE NOT TOTALLY IN     
LINE AND WE KIND OF NEED TO GET 
TO A CONSENSUS IN THIS PROCESS

>> SO THAT'S THAT'S JUST WHY I  
WOULD I MEAN WE ALREADY KNOW    
LIKE ANN ARBOR IN GENERAL WATER 

01:21:27.746 --> 01:21:28.478
WOULD I MEAN WE ALREADY KNOW    
LIKE ANN ARBOR IN GENERAL WATER 
USE PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT THAN

LIKE ANN ARBOR IN GENERAL WATER 
USE PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT THAN 
WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN ANOTHER   

01:21:32.117 --> 01:21:32.916
USE PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT THAN 
WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN ANOTHER   
COMMUNITY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT

WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH           
IRRIGATION AND LIKE THAT PLAYS  

01:21:40.125 --> 01:21:41.124
WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH           
IRRIGATION AND LIKE THAT PLAYS  
INTO IT AND WE ARE LOOKING AT   

01:21:41.126 --> 01:21:43.727
IRRIGATION AND LIKE THAT PLAYS  
INTO IT AND WE ARE LOOKING AT   
THAT COOL.

QUESTION WHICH I THINK AGAIN IS 

01:21:51.636 --> 01:21:52.435
LOVELY TRANSITION TO MY NEXT    
QUESTION WHICH I THINK AGAIN IS 
MAYBE OUTSIDE OF YOUR EXPERTIZE 

01:21:52.437 --> 01:21:55.438
QUESTION WHICH I THINK AGAIN IS 
MAYBE OUTSIDE OF YOUR EXPERTIZE 
BUT YOU GUYS ARE THE UTILITY    

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.506
MAYBE OUTSIDE OF YOUR EXPERTIZE 
BUT YOU GUYS ARE THE UTILITY    
PEOPLE SO I'M JUST GOING TO ASK 

01:21:56.508 --> 01:21:57.440
BUT YOU GUYS ARE THE UTILITY    
PEOPLE SO I'M JUST GOING TO ASK 
IT PART OF THIS IS THAT THERE'S 

01:21:57.442 --> 01:22:00.210
PEOPLE SO I'M JUST GOING TO ASK 
IT PART OF THIS IS THAT THERE'S 
GROSS HAPPENING IN THE REGION.  

01:22:00.212 --> 01:22:00.543
IT PART OF THIS IS THAT THERE'S 
GROSS HAPPENING IN THE REGION.  
RIGHT.                          

01:22:00.545 --> 01:22:01.477
GROSS HAPPENING IN THE REGION.  
RIGHT.                          
AND SO ALSO WHEN WE'RE THINKING 

01:22:01.479 --> 01:22:03.045
RIGHT.                          
AND SO ALSO WHEN WE'RE THINKING 
ABOUT WATER WITHDRAWAL LIKE YOU 

01:22:03.047 --> 01:22:03.979
AND SO ALSO WHEN WE'RE THINKING 
ABOUT WATER WITHDRAWAL LIKE YOU 
MENTIONED, LIKE WE GOT TO THINK 

01:22:03.981 --> 01:22:04.681
ABOUT WATER WITHDRAWAL LIKE YOU 
MENTIONED, LIKE WE GOT TO THINK 
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S WELLS      

01:22:04.683 --> 01:22:06.750
MENTIONED, LIKE WE GOT TO THINK 
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S WELLS      
RIGHT.

ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S WELLS      
RIGHT.                          
AND MY BUT THERE ARE HOLES      

01:22:11.056 --> 01:22:14.457
RIGHT.                          
AND MY BUT THERE ARE HOLES      
HOUSING UNITS BEING BUILT THERE 

01:22:14.459 --> 01:22:17.693
AND MY BUT THERE ARE HOLES      
HOUSING UNITS BEING BUILT THERE 
THAT ARE ALSO INCREASING AND SO 

01:22:17.695 --> 01:22:19.028
HOUSING UNITS BEING BUILT THERE 
THAT ARE ALSO INCREASING AND SO 
MOST OF MY TIME IS IN ENERGY SO 

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:22.431
THAT ARE ALSO INCREASING AND SO 
MOST OF MY TIME IS IN ENERGY SO 
I'M GOING TO GIVE THE ENERGY    

01:22:22.433 --> 01:22:23.099
MOST OF MY TIME IS IN ENERGY SO 
I'M GOING TO GIVE THE ENERGY    
ANALOGY AND THEN ASK THE WATER  

01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:26.202
I'M GOING TO GIVE THE ENERGY    
ANALOGY AND THEN ASK THE WATER  
QUESTION LIKE IT'S IT'S MUCH    

01:22:26.204 --> 01:22:29.605
ANALOGY AND THEN ASK THE WATER  
QUESTION LIKE IT'S IT'S MUCH    
EASIER FOR US TO BE NET ZERO AS 

01:22:29.607 --> 01:22:30.940
QUESTION LIKE IT'S IT'S MUCH    
EASIER FOR US TO BE NET ZERO AS 
A CITY IF WE JUST PUT A BUBBLE  

01:22:30.942 --> 01:22:33.343
EASIER FOR US TO BE NET ZERO AS 
A CITY IF WE JUST PUT A BUBBLE  
BREAK BECAUSE WE CAN CONTROL    

01:22:33.345 --> 01:22:33.610
A CITY IF WE JUST PUT A BUBBLE  
BREAK BECAUSE WE CAN CONTROL    
IT.

BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY HOW THE 
WORLD WORKS.                    
EMISSIONS GROW AROUND US AND    

01:22:37.749 --> 01:22:38.414
WORLD WORKS.                    
EMISSIONS GROW AROUND US AND    
ACTUALLY COULD GROW FASTER      

01:22:38.416 --> 01:22:41.450
EMISSIONS GROW AROUND US AND    
ACTUALLY COULD GROW FASTER      
AROUND BECAUSE UNITS FROM AN    

01:22:41.452 --> 01:22:42.118
ACTUALLY COULD GROW FASTER      
AROUND BECAUSE UNITS FROM AN    
ENERGY PERSPECTIVE THAT ARE     

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.987
AROUND BECAUSE UNITS FROM AN    
ENERGY PERSPECTIVE THAT ARE     
BUILT OUTSIDE THE CITY BANABA   

01:22:44.989 --> 01:22:45.888
ENERGY PERSPECTIVE THAT ARE     
BUILT OUTSIDE THE CITY BANABA   
TEND TO BE BIGGER AND SO        

01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:46.656
BUILT OUTSIDE THE CITY BANABA   
TEND TO BE BIGGER AND SO        
THERE'S MORE TO HEAT AND COOL   

01:22:46.658 --> 01:22:48.725
TEND TO BE BIGGER AND SO        
THERE'S MORE TO HEAT AND COOL   
RIGHT?                          

01:22:48.727 --> 01:22:49.759
THERE'S MORE TO HEAT AND COOL   
RIGHT?                          
>> THEY DON'T THEY'RE THEY'RE

DRIVING MORE BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
HAVE WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS.

>> RIGHT.                       
AND SO LIKE WE SHOULDN'T REALLY 
LIKE PUTTING A BUBBLE IS        

01:22:56.701 --> 01:22:59.602
AND SO LIKE WE SHOULDN'T REALLY 
LIKE PUTTING A BUBBLE IS        
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE WORLD  

01:22:59.604 --> 01:22:59.803
LIKE PUTTING A BUBBLE IS        
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE WORLD

IS ALSO THE CASE LIKE INDOOR    
AND IT SEEMS LIKE AT LEAST LIKE

>> RIGHT.                       
AND SO WE NEED SO EVEN IF THAT  
MEANS BUILDING ANOTHER          

01:24:30.295 --> 01:24:30.960
AND SO WE NEED SO EVEN IF THAT  
MEANS BUILDING ANOTHER          
EXPANDING OUR WATER SYSTEM      

01:24:30.962 --> 01:24:31.628
MEANS BUILDING ANOTHER

AGAIN FROM A REGIONAL           

01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:32.361
EXPANDING OUR WATER SYSTEM      
AGAIN FROM A REGIONAL           
PERSPECTIVE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT

AGAIN FROM A REGIONAL           
PERSPECTIVE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT 
BE MAYBE MORE SUSTAINABLE EVEN  

01:24:33.031 --> 01:24:33.829
PERSPECTIVE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT 
BE MAYBE MORE SUSTAINABLE EVEN  
IF IT'S A PAIN IN THE FOR US    

01:24:33.831 --> 01:24:36.098
BE MAYBE MORE SUSTAINABLE EVEN  
IF IT'S A PAIN IN THE FOR US    
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ADD IT YOU   

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:36.899
IF IT'S A PAIN IN THE FOR US    
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ADD IT YOU   
KNOW, WE HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER    

01:24:36.901 --> 01:24:37.233
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ADD IT YOU   
KNOW, WE HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER    
PLANT.                          

01:24:37.235 --> 01:24:39.335
KNOW, WE HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER    
PLANT.                          
SO WHAT I'M TRYING UNDERSTAND   

01:24:39.337 --> 01:24:40.336
PLANT.                          
SO WHAT I'M TRYING UNDERSTAND   
IS LIKE IS THAT A CORRECT       

01:24:40.338 --> 01:24:43.940
SO WHAT I'M TRYING UNDERSTAND   
IS LIKE IS THAT A CORRECT       
ASSUMPTION THAT THERE ARE SOME  

01:24:43.942 --> 01:24:44.740
IS LIKE IS THAT A CORRECT       
ASSUMPTION THAT THERE ARE SOME  
ECONOMIES OF SCALE ASSOCIATED   

01:24:44.742 --> 01:24:47.276
ASSUMPTION THAT THERE ARE SOME  
ECONOMIES OF SCALE ASSOCIATED   
WITH THIS?                      

01:24:47.278 --> 01:24:48.377
ECONOMIES OF SCALE ASSOCIATED   
WITH THIS?                      
I MEAN AND YOU MIGHT NOT IT'S   

01:24:48.379 --> 01:24:49.178
WITH THIS?                      
I MEAN AND YOU MIGHT NOT IT'S   
NOT PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION.  

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.646
I MEAN AND YOU MIGHT NOT IT'S   
NOT PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION.  
YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THE ANSWER   

01:24:50.648 --> 01:24:51.381
NOT PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION.  
YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THE ANSWER   
BUT I'M TRYING TO THINK BEYOND  

01:24:51.383 --> 01:24:54.717
YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THE ANSWER   
BUT I'M TRYING TO THINK BEYOND  
JUST THE CITY BECAUSE YEAH, IT  

01:24:54.719 --> 01:24:55.451
BUT I'M TRYING TO THINK BEYOND  
JUST THE CITY BECAUSE YEAH, IT  
WOULD SAY AT A HIGH LEVEL.      

01:24:55.453 --> 01:24:55.718
JUST THE CITY BECAUSE YEAH, IT  
WOULD SAY AT A HIGH LEVEL.      
YES.                            

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.555
WOULD SAY AT A HIGH LEVEL.      
YES.                            
AND DEPENDING ON SCENARIO WE    

01:24:58.557 --> 01:24:59.355
YES.                            
AND DEPENDING ON SCENARIO WE    
LOOKED AT WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO 

01:24:59.357 --> 01:25:02.424
AND DEPENDING ON SCENARIO WE    
LOOKED AT WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO 
DO FOR WELLS COULD BE           

01:25:02.426 --> 01:25:03.092
LOOKED AT WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO 
DO FOR WELLS COULD BE           
CONTAMINATED STILL OR HAVE      

01:25:03.094 --> 01:25:03.559
DO FOR WELLS COULD BE           
CONTAMINATED STILL OR HAVE      
DIOXANE HITS.                   

01:25:03.561 --> 01:25:05.762
CONTAMINATED STILL OR HAVE      
DIOXANE HITS.                   
SO LIKE WE KNOW THAT WE MAY     

01:25:05.764 --> 01:25:06.629
DIOXANE HITS.                   
SO LIKE WE KNOW THAT WE MAY     
HAVE TO EXPAND FOR THOSE FOLKS, 

01:25:06.631 --> 01:25:06.830
SO LIKE WE KNOW THAT WE MAY     
HAVE TO EXPAND FOR THOSE FOLKS, 
RIGHT?                          

01:25:06.832 --> 01:25:07.163
HAVE TO EXPAND FOR THOSE FOLKS, 
RIGHT?                          
YEAH.                           

01:25:07.165 --> 01:25:09.866
RIGHT?                          
YEAH.                           
SO MORE OF THAT COULD BE        

01:25:09.868 --> 01:25:10.666
YEAH.                           
SO MORE OF THAT COULD BE        
NECESSARY BUT YOU'RE CERTAINLY  

01:25:10.668 --> 01:25:13.803
SO MORE OF THAT COULD BE        
NECESSARY BUT YOU'RE CERTAINLY  
RIGHT THAT WE WE DID AND I      

01:25:13.805 --> 01:25:14.604
NECESSARY BUT YOU'RE CERTAINLY  
RIGHT THAT WE WE DID AND I      
TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE  

01:25:14.606 --> 01:25:17.406
RIGHT THAT WE WE DID AND I      
TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE  
THAT WE WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT    

01:25:17.408 --> 01:25:18.274
TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE  
THAT WE WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT    
GROWTH IN THE TOWNSHIPS THAT WE 

01:25:18.276 --> 01:25:20.109
THAT WE WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT    
GROWTH IN THE TOWNSHIPS THAT WE 
CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH   

01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:20.943
GROWTH IN THE TOWNSHIPS THAT WE 
CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH   
AS PART OF THIS ANALYSIS.       

01:25:20.945 --> 01:25:24.180
CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH   
AS PART OF THIS ANALYSIS.       
BUT IT IS YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING  

01:25:24.182 --> 01:25:24.813
AS PART OF THIS ANALYSIS.       
BUT IT IS YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING  
TO BE NEEDED.                   

01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:25.381
BUT IT IS YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING  
TO BE NEEDED.                   
>> YEAH.                        

01:25:25.383 --> 01:25:26.182
TO BE NEEDED.                   
>> YEAH.                        
AND EVEN THE GROWTH THAT IS     

01:25:26.184 --> 01:25:28.417
>> YEAH.                        
AND EVEN THE GROWTH THAT IS     
BEYOND YOUR SYSTEM BUT THE      

01:25:28.419 --> 01:25:28.884
AND EVEN THE GROWTH THAT IS     
BEYOND YOUR SYSTEM BUT THE      
WELLS RIGHT.                    

01:25:28.886 --> 01:25:29.685
BEYOND YOUR SYSTEM BUT THE      
WELLS RIGHT.                    
AGAIN THAT'S IMPACTING OUR      

01:25:29.687 --> 01:25:32.688
WELLS RIGHT.                    
AGAIN THAT'S IMPACTING OUR      
WATER BUDGET OVERALL.           

01:25:32.690 --> 01:25:33.156
AGAIN THAT'S IMPACTING OUR      
WATER BUDGET OVERALL.           
>> RIGHT.                       

01:25:33.158 --> 01:25:33.756
WATER BUDGET OVERALL.           
>> RIGHT.                       
REGIONAL RIGHT.                 

01:25:33.758 --> 01:25:36.292
>> RIGHT.                       
REGIONAL RIGHT.                 
OK, SO AND AS CHRIS SAID, YOU   

01:25:36.294 --> 01:25:36.959
REGIONAL RIGHT.                 
OK, SO AND AS CHRIS SAID, YOU   
KNOW, DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES     

01:25:36.961 --> 01:25:40.195
OK, SO AND AS CHRIS SAID, YOU   
KNOW, DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES     
LOOK DIFFERENT AND SO WHEN WE   

01:25:40.197 --> 01:25:40.863
KNOW, DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES     
LOOK DIFFERENT AND SO WHEN WE   
TALK ABOUT ALL THESE NUMBERS    

01:25:40.865 --> 01:25:41.697
LOOK DIFFERENT AND SO WHEN WE   
TALK ABOUT ALL THESE NUMBERS    
AND WE'RE LIKE WHY ARE IT'S ALL 

01:25:41.699 --> 01:25:43.933
TALK ABOUT ALL THESE NUMBERS    
AND WE'RE LIKE WHY ARE IT'S ALL 
OVER THE PLACE?                 

01:25:43.935 --> 01:25:44.934
AND WE'RE LIKE WHY ARE IT'S ALL 
OVER THE PLACE?                 
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT    

01:25:44.936 --> 01:25:47.270
OVER THE PLACE?                 
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT    
STANDARDS WE USE IN THE SECTOR  

01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:48.304
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT    
STANDARDS WE USE IN THE SECTOR  
AND IT SORT OF DEPENDS YOU PICK 

01:25:48.306 --> 01:25:49.104
STANDARDS WE USE IN THE SECTOR  
AND IT SORT OF DEPENDS YOU PICK 
WHAT FITS BEST FOR YOUR         

01:25:49.106 --> 01:25:51.307
AND IT SORT OF DEPENDS YOU PICK 
WHAT FITS BEST FOR YOUR         
COMMUNITY.                      

01:25:51.309 --> 01:25:52.575
WHAT FITS BEST FOR YOUR         
COMMUNITY.                      
SO IN ANN ARBOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 

01:25:52.577 --> 01:25:53.409
COMMUNITY.                      
SO IN ANN ARBOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
DON'T IRRIGATE BECAUSE A LOT    

01:25:53.411 --> 01:25:56.078
SO IN ANN ARBOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
DON'T IRRIGATE BECAUSE A LOT    
OF THE HOMES ARE OLDER AND YOUR 

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:56.712
DON'T IRRIGATE BECAUSE A LOT    
OF THE HOMES ARE OLDER AND YOUR 
YARDS ARE SMALL AND WE          

01:25:56.714 --> 01:25:59.482
OF THE HOMES ARE OLDER AND YOUR 
YARDS ARE SMALL AND WE          
ENCOURAGE POLLINATOR FRIENDLY   

01:25:59.484 --> 01:26:00.282
YARDS ARE SMALL AND WE          
ENCOURAGE POLLINATOR FRIENDLY   
YARDS AND PEOPLE THAT AREN'T    

01:26:00.284 --> 01:26:02.685
ENCOURAGE POLLINATOR FRIENDLY   
YARDS AND PEOPLE THAT AREN'T    
MOWING AS MUCH VERSUS MAYBE A   

01:26:02.687 --> 01:26:03.553
YARDS AND PEOPLE THAT AREN'T    
MOWING AS MUCH VERSUS MAYBE A   
NEWER DEVELOPMENT THAT'S OUT IN 

01:26:03.555 --> 01:26:04.153
MOWING AS MUCH VERSUS MAYBE A   
NEWER DEVELOPMENT THAT'S OUT IN 
A TOWNSHIP WHERE THEY'VE ALL    

01:26:04.155 --> 01:26:06.689
NEWER DEVELOPMENT THAT'S OUT IN 
A TOWNSHIP WHERE THEY'VE ALL    
GOT UNDERGROUND SPRINKLER       

01:26:06.691 --> 01:26:07.089
A TOWNSHIP WHERE THEY'VE ALL    
GOT UNDERGROUND SPRINKLER       
SYSTEMS.                        

01:26:07.091 --> 01:26:07.890
GOT UNDERGROUND SPRINKLER       
SYSTEMS.                        
SO IT'S JUST LOOKS DIFFERENT    

01:26:07.892 --> 01:26:10.926
SYSTEMS.                        
SO IT'S JUST LOOKS DIFFERENT    
HERE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.  

01:26:10.928 --> 01:26:11.794
SO IT'S JUST LOOKS DIFFERENT    
HERE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.  
AND SO WE PICK DIFFERENT        

01:26:11.796 --> 01:26:14.264
HERE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.  
AND SO WE PICK DIFFERENT        
FACTORS WHEN WE CALCULATE       

01:26:14.266 --> 01:26:14.864
AND SO WE PICK DIFFERENT        
FACTORS WHEN WE CALCULATE       
CAPACITY ANALYSIS.              

01:26:14.866 --> 01:26:15.198
FACTORS WHEN WE CALCULATE       
CAPACITY ANALYSIS.              
YEAH, YEAH.                     

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.168
CAPACITY ANALYSIS.              
YEAH, YEAH.                     
OK, THE FINAL ONE IS ABOUT THE  

01:26:19.170 --> 01:26:21.303
YEAH, YEAH.                     
OK, THE FINAL ONE IS ABOUT THE  
TRUNK LINES AND THIS IS NOW NOT 

01:26:21.305 --> 01:26:22.305
OK, THE FINAL ONE IS ABOUT THE  
TRUNK LINES AND THIS IS NOW NOT 
WATER BUT IT'S MORE ON THE      

01:26:22.307 --> 01:26:23.038
TRUNK LINES AND THIS IS NOW NOT 
WATER BUT IT'S MORE ON THE      
WASTE WATER DISTRIBUTION AND    

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:26.141
WATER BUT IT'S MORE ON THE      
WASTE WATER DISTRIBUTION AND    
MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE THE MAP   

01:26:26.143 --> 01:26:26.842
WASTE WATER DISTRIBUTION AND    
MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE THE MAP   
THAT YOU SHOWED WITH THE RED    

01:26:26.844 --> 01:26:30.146
MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE THE MAP   
THAT YOU SHOWED WITH THE RED    
LINES WHICH TOOK IS LIKE DANGER 

01:26:30.148 --> 01:26:33.950
THAT YOU SHOWED WITH THE RED    
LINES WHICH TOOK IS LIKE DANGER 
DANGER BACKUP'S INTO PATED NOW  

01:26:33.952 --> 01:26:37.486
LINES WHICH TOOK IS LIKE DANGER 
DANGER BACKUP'S INTO PATED NOW  
THE NEXT ONE WITH ARROWS KEEP   

01:26:37.488 --> 01:26:37.920
DANGER BACKUP'S INTO PATED NOW  
THE NEXT ONE WITH ARROWS KEEP   
THAT ONE.                       

01:26:37.922 --> 01:26:38.221
THE NEXT ONE WITH ARROWS KEEP   
THAT ONE.                       
YEP.

YEP.                            
YEAH THERE ARE SOME GROUPS      
THERE IT FEELS TO ME LIKE THAT  

01:26:41.959 --> 01:26:48.030
YEAH THERE ARE SOME GROUPS      
THERE IT FEELS TO ME LIKE THAT  
HAPPENS TO BE WHERE DO WE KNOW  

01:26:48.032 --> 01:26:50.967
THERE IT FEELS TO ME LIKE THAT  
HAPPENS TO BE WHERE DO WE KNOW  
THE QUESTION IS MAYBE THIS      

01:26:50.969 --> 01:26:52.034
HAPPENS TO BE WHERE DO WE KNOW  
THE QUESTION IS MAYBE THIS      
STUDY IS YOU'RE NOT DONE YET SO 

01:26:52.036 --> 01:26:54.437
THE QUESTION IS MAYBE THIS      
STUDY IS YOU'RE NOT DONE YET SO 
RIGHT.

RIGHT.                          
BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT           
DEVELOPMENT ALONG TRUNK LINES

BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT           
DEVELOPMENT ALONG TRUNK LINES   
VERSUS FARTHER TOWARDS THE END  

01:27:02.747 --> 01:27:03.379

YARDS WITH LESS GRASS MEANS WE  
USE LESS WATER WHICH IS

01:34:04.468 --> 01:34:05.600
SO TALK TO ME ABOUT WET WEATHER 
.                               
DOES THAT IN AH THE CONNECTED   

01:34:05.602 --> 01:34:07.970
.                               
DOES THAT IN AH THE CONNECTED   
FLOODING RAINS A PART OF THAT.  

01:34:07.972 --> 01:34:08.637
DOES THAT IN AH THE CONNECTED   
FLOODING RAINS A PART OF THAT.  
>> YEP.                         

01:34:08.639 --> 01:34:13.041
FLOODING RAINS A PART OF THAT.  
>> YEP.                         
AND IF THEY WERE DISCONNECTED   

01:34:13.043 --> 01:34:15.477
>> YEP.                         
AND IF THEY WERE DISCONNECTED   
WOULD THAT IMPROVE THAT?        

01:34:15.479 --> 01:34:16.511
AND IF THEY WERE DISCONNECTED   
WOULD THAT IMPROVE THAT?        
WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE THAT AS 

01:34:16.513 --> 01:34:17.213
WOULD THAT IMPROVE THAT?        
WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE THAT AS 
PART OF THE STUDY OK YES.       

01:34:17.215 --> 01:34:19.714
WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE THAT AS 
PART OF THE STUDY OK YES.       
I MEAN THEY ARE CONNECTED OK    

01:34:19.716 --> 01:34:23.185
PART OF THE STUDY OK YES.       
I MEAN THEY ARE CONNECTED OK    
AND THEN IS IT THE CASE THAT    

01:34:23.187 --> 01:34:24.252
I MEAN THEY ARE CONNECTED OK    
AND THEN IS IT THE CASE THAT    
OUR PEAK USAGE IS OFF BY ABOUT  

01:34:24.254 --> 01:34:30.559
AND THEN IS IT THE CASE THAT    
OUR PEAK USAGE IS OFF BY ABOUT  
15 PERCENT OVER                 

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.042
                THE LAST        
SEVERAL YEARS?

SEVERAL YEARS?                  
>> ARE YOU FOR WATER USAGE JUST 
WATER USAGE ACROSS THE CITY

WATER USAGE ACROSS THE CITY     
LIKE WHEN WE HIT A PEAK BUT     

01:34:48.379 --> 01:34:49.177
WATER USAGE ACROSS THE CITY     
LIKE WHEN WE HIT A PEAK BUT     
WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT ABOVE THAT

WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT ABOVE THAT  
PEAK.                           
WE'RE BELOW THAT PEAK ABOUT 15

WE'RE BELOW THAT PEAK ABOUT 15  
PERCENT.                        
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT         

01:34:51.615 --> 01:34:52.281
PERCENT.                        
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT         
DRINKING WATER, OUR AVERAGE     

01:34:52.283 --> 01:34:52.948
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT         
DRINKING WATER, OUR AVERAGE     
DEMAND HAS DROPPED AS I

DRINKING WATER, OUR AVERAGE     
DEMAND HAS DROPPED AS I         
MENTIONED SINCE THE INCLINING

IT'S PART OF SORT OF IN         
STRUCTURE.                      
I WILL SAY THAT THAT WHEN THAT

STRUCTURE.                      
I WILL SAY THAT THAT WHEN THAT  
WAS CREATED AND I CAN PROBABLY

I WILL SAY THAT THAT WHEN THAT  
WAS CREATED AND I CAN PROBABLY  
SPEAK TO THE MORE OF THIS IN    

01:36:38.021 --> 01:36:38.787
WAS CREATED AND I CAN PROBABLY  
SPEAK TO THE MORE OF THIS IN    
DETAIL IT WAS CREATED IT WAS    

01:36:38.789 --> 01:36:41.256
SPEAK TO THE MORE OF THIS IN    
DETAIL IT WAS CREATED IT WAS    
SEVERAL THAT HASN'T BEEN        

01:36:41.258 --> 01:36:42.057
DETAIL IT WAS CREATED IT WAS    
SEVERAL THAT HASN'T BEEN        
UPDATED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN  

01:36:42.059 --> 01:36:42.791
SEVERAL THAT HASN'T BEEN        
UPDATED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN  
AND SO IT WAS BASED ON SORT     

01:36:42.793 --> 01:36:45.260
UPDATED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN  
AND SO IT WAS BASED ON SORT     
OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE  

01:36:45.262 --> 01:36:45.928
AND SO IT WAS BASED ON SORT     
OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE  
AT THE TIME AND LIKE WHAT       

01:36:45.930 --> 01:36:49.164
OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE  
AT THE TIME AND LIKE WHAT       
PEOPLE WOULD NEED TO BUY INTO.  

01:36:49.166 --> 01:36:50.231
AT THE TIME AND LIKE WHAT       
PEOPLE WOULD NEED TO BUY INTO.  
SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT 

01:36:50.233 --> 01:36:53.068
PEOPLE WOULD NEED TO BUY INTO.  
SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT 
WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT.         

01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:54.002
SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT 
WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT.         
DOES THAT NEED TO CHANGE NOW    

01:36:54.004 --> 01:36:54.836
WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT.         
DOES THAT NEED TO CHANGE NOW    
THAT WE ARE CONTEMPLATING A LOT 

01:36:54.838 --> 01:36:57.606
DOES THAT NEED TO CHANGE NOW    
THAT WE ARE CONTEMPLATING A LOT 
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT WE 

01:36:57.608 --> 01:36:58.207
THAT WE ARE CONTEMPLATING A LOT 
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT WE 
NEED ALL THOSE USERS TO BE      

01:36:58.209 --> 01:36:59.074
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT WE 
NEED ALL THOSE USERS TO BE      
BUYING INTO THAT INFRASTRUCTURE 

01:36:59.076 --> 01:37:01.943
NEED ALL THOSE USERS TO BE      
BUYING INTO THAT INFRASTRUCTURE 
TO AND SO THAT IS I THINK ONE   

01:37:01.945 --> 01:37:04.379
BUYING INTO THAT INFRASTRUCTURE 
TO AND SO THAT IS I THINK ONE   
OF THE THINGS THAT HOPEFULLY

SCALE PROJECTS LIKE THE PLANT   

01:37:16.527 --> 01:37:17.258
AS WE THINK ABOUT LIKE LARGE    
SCALE PROJECTS LIKE THE PLANT   
REPLACEMENT PROJECT WE WOULD BE 

01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:19.761
SCALE PROJECTS LIKE THE PLANT   
REPLACEMENT PROJECT WE WOULD BE 
LOOKING FOR LOW INTEREST LOANS  

01:37:19.763 --> 01:37:20.563
REPLACEMENT PROJECT WE WOULD BE 
LOOKING FOR LOW INTEREST LOANS  
THROUGH THE STATE AND ALSO THE

THIS I TALKED TO A LOT          
OF DEVELOPERS TALK TO A FAIR

OF DEVELOPERS TALK TO A FAIR    
AMOUNT OF BUSINESSES AND YOU    

02:01:40.956 --> 02:01:43.791

KNOW, THEY EMBRACE THAT TOO     
THAT IT DRIVES THEIR            
EMPLOYMENT.                     

02:01:44.794 --> 02:01:47.661
THAT IT DRIVES THEIR

EMPLOYMENT.                     
THEY DON'T YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD  
TO FIND EMPLOYEES IN A CITY     

02:01:48.331 --> 02:01:50.998
THEY DON'T YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD  
TO FIND EMPLOYEES IN A CITY     
THAT DOESN'T OFFER THE THINGS   

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:51.565
TO FIND EMPLOYEES IN A CITY     
THAT DOESN'T OFFER THE THINGS   
THAT WE OFFER.

THAT DOESN'T OFFER THE THINGS   
THAT WE OFFER.                  
SO I THINK WE'RE A STEP AHEAD   

02:01:52.501 --> 02:01:52.966
THAT WE OFFER.                  
SO I THINK WE'RE A STEP AHEAD   
IN THAT AREA.

SO I THINK WE'RE A STEP AHEAD   
IN THAT AREA.                   
BUT THE REALITY IS TOO THAT IT  

02:01:55.772 --> 02:01:58.839
IN THAT AREA.                   
BUT THE REALITY IS TOO THAT IT  
IS REALLY EXPENSIVE TO DEVELOP  

02:01:58.841 --> 02:02:03.376
BUT THE REALITY IS TOO THAT IT  
IS REALLY EXPENSIVE TO DEVELOP  
AND A LOT OF COMPANIES CAN KIND 

02:02:03.378 --> 02:02:04.011
IS REALLY EXPENSIVE TO DEVELOP  
AND A LOT OF COMPANIES CAN KIND 
OF CHOOSE A LITTLE BIT WHERE    

02:02:04.013 --> 02:02:04.612
AND A LOT OF COMPANIES CAN KIND 
OF CHOOSE A LITTLE BIT WHERE    
THEY WANT TO BE.                

02:02:04.614 --> 02:02:07.748
OF CHOOSE A LITTLE BIT WHERE    
THEY WANT TO BE.                
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

ONE EXAMPLE THAT I MIGHT OFFER  

02:14:44.138 --> 02:14:44.804
NOT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.   
ONE EXAMPLE THAT I MIGHT OFFER  
THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THIS       

02:14:44.806 --> 02:14:47.574
ONE EXAMPLE THAT I MIGHT OFFER  
THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THIS       
CATEGORY THIS IS THE CITIES     

02:14:47.576 --> 02:14:48.308
THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THIS       
CATEGORY THIS IS THE CITIES     
HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS     

02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.909
CATEGORY THIS IS THE CITIES     
HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS     
WITH THE PROJECT THAT IS

SCHEDULED FOR YOUR UPCOMING     
AGENDA HERSELF.                 
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S      

02:14:52.413 --> 02:14:55.081
AGENDA HERSELF.                 
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S      
THAT'S KIND OF AN EXAMPLE THAT  

02:14:55.083 --> 02:14:56.215
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S      
THAT'S KIND OF AN EXAMPLE THAT  
WE HAVE WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE    

02:14:56.217 --> 02:14:59.452
THAT'S KIND OF AN EXAMPLE THAT  
WE HAVE WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE    
FORM BASED STANDARDS THAT ARE   

02:14:59.454 --> 02:15:00.086
WE HAVE WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE    
FORM BASED STANDARDS THAT ARE   
SIGNIFICANTLY ADDING TO THE

FORM BASED STANDARDS THAT ARE   
SIGNIFICANTLY ADDING TO THE     
COST TO REALIZE THAT PROJECT    

02:15:00.822 --> 02:15:03.290
SIGNIFICANTLY ADDING TO THE     
COST TO REALIZE THAT PROJECT

COST TO REALIZE THAT PROJECT    
AND FORM.                       
THEREFORE THE CITY IS           

02:15:04.159 --> 02:15:06.993
AND FORM.                       
THEREFORE THE CITY IS           
UNDERTAKING SOME CONVERSATION   

02:15:06.995 --> 02:15:07.927
THEREFORE THE CITY IS           
UNDERTAKING SOME CONVERSATION   
WITH WHAT'S OUR FINANCIAL ROLE  

02:15:07.929 --> 02:15:08.195
UNDERTAKING SOME CONVERSATION   
WITH WHAT'S OUR FINANCIAL ROLE  
IN THAT.                        

02:15:08.197 --> 02:15:11.264
WITH WHAT'S OUR FINANCIAL ROLE  
IN THAT.                        
I WOULD SAY THAT IT THAT COULD  

02:15:11.266 --> 02:15:12.199
IN THAT.                        
I WOULD SAY THAT IT THAT COULD  
BE KIND OF AN EXAMPLE, RIGHT?   

02:15:12.201 --> 02:15:15.468
I WOULD SAY THAT IT THAT COULD  
BE KIND OF AN EXAMPLE, RIGHT?   
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A LIMITATION, 

02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:16.236
BE KIND OF AN EXAMPLE, RIGHT?   
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A LIMITATION, 
FOR EXAMPLE, ON PARKING BEING   

02:15:16.238 --> 02:15:19.105
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A LIMITATION, 
FOR EXAMPLE, ON PARKING BEING   
STRUCTURED IN THAT PLACE AND WE 

02:15:19.107 --> 02:15:19.773
FOR EXAMPLE, ON PARKING BEING   
STRUCTURED IN THAT PLACE AND WE 
JUST ALLOWED CERTAIN PARKING    

02:15:19.775 --> 02:15:20.573
STRUCTURED IN THAT PLACE AND WE 
JUST ALLOWED CERTAIN PARKING    
LOTS THAT WOULD GREATLY REDUCE  

02:15:20.575 --> 02:15:23.509
JUST ALLOWED CERTAIN PARKING    
LOTS THAT WOULD GREATLY REDUCE  
THE CORRESPONDING PARKING COST  

02:15:23.511 --> 02:15:24.043
LOTS THAT WOULD GREATLY REDUCE  
THE CORRESPONDING PARKING COST  
FOR THAT PROJECT.               

02:15:24.045 --> 02:15:26.746
THE CORRESPONDING PARKING COST  
FOR THAT PROJECT.               
BUT WE'VE DESIGN STANDARDS IN   

02:15:26.748 --> 02:15:27.480
FOR THAT PROJECT.               
BUT WE'VE DESIGN STANDARDS IN   
PLACE THAT NECESSITATE THIS     

02:15:27.482 --> 02:15:31.284
BUT WE'VE DESIGN STANDARDS IN   
PLACE THAT NECESSITATE THIS     
BALANCE THAT I THINK WHAT JOE   

02:15:31.286 --> 02:15:32.218
PLACE THAT NECESSITATE THIS     
BALANCE THAT I THINK WHAT JOE   
IS GETTING AT IT'S LIKE IN THAT 

02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:32.819

IS GETTING AT IT'S LIKE IN THAT 
CASE THAT MIGHT BE ONE          

02:15:32.821 --> 02:15:35.288
IS GETTING AT IT'S LIKE IN THAT 
CASE THAT MIGHT BE ONE          
FINANCIAL TOOL.

IN ANOTHER CASE IT MIGHT BE A   
BROWNFIELD TO IN ANOTHER CASE

I THINK IT SHOULD SIT SOMEWHERE 
ELSE BECAUSE I THINK THE THE

BUT LIKE A SIX BEDROOM HOUSE IS 
NOT AS VERSATILE AND CAN'T BE

CODIFY THESE POLICIES.          

03:14:22.781 --> 03:14:23.646
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO     
CODIFY THESE POLICIES.          
FOR EXAMPLE, A LOT              

03:14:23.648 --> 03:14:26.982
CODIFY THESE POLICIES.          
FOR EXAMPLE, A LOT              
OF COMMUNITIES PROVIDE A HIGHER 

03:14:26.984 --> 03:14:27.683
FOR EXAMPLE, A LOT              
OF COMMUNITIES PROVIDE A HIGHER 
LEVEL OF DENSITY ADJACENT TO

CAMPUS AND OTHERWISE SIMILAR    
DISTRICTS.                      
THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY THAT  

03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:35.257
DISTRICTS.                      
THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY THAT  
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DESIGNATE A   

03:14:35.259 --> 03:14:36.059
THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY THAT  
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DESIGNATE A   
GEOGRAPHY OR A TYPE OF HOUSING

APPROPRIATELY SCALED FOR THESE  
AREAS.

APPROPRIATELY SCALED FOR THESE  
AREAS.                          
OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT

MIGHT BE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. 
AND SO I THINK I DON'T THINK    
WE'RE GOING TO ANSWER ALL THOSE

AND SO I THINK I DON'T THINK    
WE'RE GOING TO ANSWER ALL THOSE 
CORE OF THESE QUESTIONS IN HERE 

03:17:28.266 --> 03:17:31.567
WE'RE GOING TO ANSWER ALL THOSE 
CORE OF THESE QUESTIONS IN HERE 
BUT I THINK WE COULD SAY WE'RE  

03:17:31.569 --> 03:17:32.201
CORE OF THESE QUESTIONS IN HERE 
BUT I THINK WE COULD SAY WE'RE  
GOING TO LOOK AT LOT SIZE

SOMETHING LIKE THIS I THIS      

03:17:42.247 --> 03:17:46.048
SENSE BUT IN SOMETHING AGAIN    
SOMETHING LIKE THIS I THIS      
COULD BE A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT  

03:17:46.050 --> 03:17:46.915
SOMETHING LIKE THIS I THIS      
COULD BE A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT  
WHEN THERE IS DISTINCT          

03:17:46.917 --> 03:17:50.086
COULD BE A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT  
WHEN THERE IS DISTINCT          
GEOGRAPHIC PRESSURE PRESSURES   

03:17:50.088 --> 03:17:51.020
WHEN THERE IS DISTINCT          
GEOGRAPHIC PRESSURE PRESSURES   
IN NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GOING TO   

03:17:51.022 --> 03:17:51.754
GEOGRAPHIC PRESSURE PRESSURES   
IN NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GOING TO   
BE DISTINCT IN OUR COMMUNITY    

03:17:51.756 --> 03:17:57.826
IN NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GOING TO   
BE DISTINCT IN OUR COMMUNITY    
BASED ON WHERE THEY'RE WHETHER

BASED ON WHERE THEY'RE WHETHER  
HIS NEIGHBORHOOD THERE IS A

BASED ON WHERE THEY'RE WHETHER  
HIS NEIGHBORHOOD THERE IS A     
VERY DIFFERENT LEVEL            

03:17:58.997 --> 03:18:00.730
HIS NEIGHBORHOOD THERE IS A     
VERY DIFFERENT LEVEL            
OF PRESSURE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES 

03:18:00.732 --> 03:18:01.397
VERY DIFFERENT LEVEL            
OF PRESSURE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF DEVELOPMENT AND MAYBE THE    

03:18:01.399 --> 03:18:04.200
OF PRESSURE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF DEVELOPMENT AND MAYBE THE    
EQUIVALENT ZONE NEIGHBORHOODS

03:18:06.137 --> 03:18:08.237
ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY, A LOT    
OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF PROXIMITY 
AND SO I DON'T WANT THIS HERE   

03:18:08.239 --> 03:18:08.904
OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF PROXIMITY 
AND SO I DON'T WANT THIS HERE   
TO SAY THAT WE NEED IT.         

03:18:08.906 --> 03:18:12.307
AND SO I DON'T WANT THIS HERE   
TO SAY THAT WE NEED IT.         
I PUT IT HERE TO SAY THAT THAT  

03:18:12.309 --> 03:18:13.108
TO SAY THAT WE NEED IT.         
I PUT IT HERE TO SAY THAT THAT  
MIGHT BE SOME WAY THAT HE USED  

03:18:13.110 --> 03:18:15.511
I PUT IT HERE TO SAY THAT THAT  
MIGHT BE SOME WAY THAT HE USED  
THE CITY COUNCIL COULD SAY WE   

03:18:15.513 --> 03:18:16.179
MIGHT BE SOME WAY THAT HE USED  
THE CITY COUNCIL COULD SAY WE   
MIGHT HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH      

03:18:16.181 --> 03:18:19.481
THE CITY COUNCIL COULD SAY WE   
MIGHT HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH      
DISTINCT APPROACHES TO ANSWER   

03:18:19.483 --> 03:18:20.216
MIGHT HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH      
DISTINCT APPROACHES TO ANSWER   
THESE QUESTIONS IN SIMILARLY    

03:18:20.218 --> 03:18:26.422
DISTINCT APPROACHES TO ANSWER   
THESE QUESTIONS IN SIMILARLY    
ZONED AREAS GIVEN               

03:18:40.904 --> 03:18:42.571
                  OUR GOAL TO   
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ZONING     
DISTRICTS.                      

03:18:42.573 --> 03:18:43.372
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ZONING     
DISTRICTS.                      
AND SO MAYBE THAT ONE WAY IS TO 

03:18:43.374 --> 03:18:44.173
DISTRICTS.                      
AND SO MAYBE THAT ONE WAY IS TO 
WITH OUR USED TO BE ABLE TO     

03:18:44.175 --> 03:18:44.641
AND SO MAYBE THAT ONE WAY IS TO 
WITH OUR USED TO BE ABLE TO     
DEFINE DIFFERENT TYPES          

03:18:44.643 --> 03:18:45.508
WITH OUR USED TO BE ABLE TO     
DEFINE DIFFERENT TYPES          
OF MULTIPLE HOUSES IN DIFFERENT 

03:18:45.510 --> 03:18:45.708
DEFINE DIFFERENT TYPES          
OF MULTIPLE HOUSES IN DIFFERENT 
WAYS.                           

03:18:45.710 --> 03:18:46.508
OF MULTIPLE HOUSES IN DIFFERENT 
WAYS.                           
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT I NEED   

03:18:46.510 --> 03:18:46.843
WAYS.                           
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT I NEED   
THAT.                           

03:18:46.845 --> 03:18:47.643
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT I NEED   
THAT.                           
IT IS AN IDEA THAT HAS BEEN

I THINK ONE WAY THAT WOULD HELP 

03:23:44.475 --> 03:23:47.877
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.            
I THINK ONE WAY THAT WOULD HELP 
ME IS IF IN THE NEXT ITERATION  

03:23:47.879 --> 03:23:48.877
I THINK ONE WAY THAT WOULD HELP 
ME IS IF IN THE NEXT ITERATION  
THIS YOU COULD HAVE ANOTHER     

03:23:48.879 --> 03:23:49.545
ME IS IF IN THE NEXT ITERATION  
THIS YOU COULD HAVE ANOTHER     
COLUMN THAT COULD HAVE          

03:23:49.547 --> 03:23:52.547
THIS YOU COULD HAVE ANOTHER     
COLUMN THAT COULD HAVE          
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES       

03:23:52.549 --> 03:23:56.118
COLUMN THAT COULD HAVE          
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES       
OF THIS IS A FORM BASE TYPE     

03:23:56.120 --> 03:23:56.786
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES       
OF THIS IS A FORM BASE TYPE     
OF APPROACH BECAUSE THEN THAT   

03:23:56.788 --> 03:24:00.456
OF THIS IS A FORM BASE TYPE     
OF APPROACH BECAUSE THEN THAT   
HELPS ME LOCATE WHERE THIS IS.  

03:24:00.458 --> 03:24:02.958
OF APPROACH BECAUSE THEN THAT   
HELPS ME LOCATE WHERE THIS IS.

BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT'S THE    
BEST WAY FOR US TO ACHIEVE THAT 
FORM BASED DESIGN, THAT IS A    

03:24:12.236 --> 03:24:15.404

FORM BASED DESIGN, THAT IS A    
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION THAN IT

PERVERSE OUTCOME.               

03:27:19.223 --> 03:27:20.155
DOESN'T CREATE THAT KIND OF A   
PERVERSE OUTCOME.               
THAT'S A REALLY LONG, WORDY     

03:27:20.157 --> 03:27:20.422
PERVERSE OUTCOME.               
THAT'S A REALLY LONG, WORDY     
WAY.                            

03:27:20.424 --> 03:27:22.090
THAT'S A REALLY LONG, WORDY     
WAY.                            
BUT I I READ THAT IS THAT WAS   

03:27:22.092 --> 03:27:23.025
WAY.                            
BUT I I READ THAT IS THAT WAS   
AN ATTEMPT TO GET THERE MAYBE   

03:27:23.027 --> 03:27:26.262
BUT I I READ THAT IS THAT WAS   
AN ATTEMPT TO GET THERE MAYBE   
WASN'T THE RIGHT BUT THAT'S THE 

03:27:26.264 --> 03:27:27.129
AN ATTEMPT TO GET THERE MAYBE   
WASN'T THE RIGHT BUT THAT'S THE 
KIND OF SPECIFICITY WE NEED TO  

03:27:27.131 --> 03:27:27.730
WASN'T THE RIGHT BUT THAT'S THE 
KIND OF SPECIFICITY WE NEED TO  
MAKE SURE THAT IN DESIGNING     

03:27:27.732 --> 03:27:30.732
KIND OF SPECIFICITY WE NEED TO  
MAKE SURE THAT IN DESIGNING     
STANDARDS THAT WE DON'T CREATE  

03:27:30.734 --> 03:27:31.533
MAKE SURE THAT IN DESIGNING     
STANDARDS THAT WE DON'T CREATE  
PERVERSE OUTCOMES THAT RESULTS  

03:27:31.535 --> 03:27:34.502
STANDARDS THAT WE DON'T CREATE  
PERVERSE OUTCOMES THAT RESULTS  
IN HOUSING UNIT TYPES THAT      

03:27:34.504 --> 03:27:35.171
PERVERSE OUTCOMES THAT RESULTS  
IN HOUSING UNIT TYPES THAT      
AREN'T FLEXIBLE, SOMETHING LIKE 

03:27:35.173 --> 03:27:35.504
IN HOUSING UNIT TYPES THAT      
AREN'T FLEXIBLE, SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT.                           

03:27:35.506 --> 03:27:39.175
AREN'T FLEXIBLE, SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT.                           
SO I THINK THE THE WHY THE YOU  

03:27:39.177 --> 03:27:42.510
THAT.                           
SO I THINK THE THE WHY THE YOU  
KNOW WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO   

03:27:42.512 --> 03:27:43.345
SO I THINK THE THE WHY THE YOU  
KNOW WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO   
AND WHY IS A CONCRETE ACTION    

03:27:43.347 --> 03:27:46.682
KNOW WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO   
AND WHY IS A CONCRETE ACTION    
MAKES SENSE TO HAVE MAYBE A     

03:27:46.684 --> 03:27:47.549
AND WHY IS A CONCRETE ACTION    
MAKES SENSE TO HAVE MAYBE A     
LITTLE BIT BUT NOT TO SUCH GORY 

03:27:47.551 --> 03:27:49.885
MAKES SENSE TO HAVE MAYBE A     
LITTLE BIT BUT NOT TO SUCH GORY 
DETAIL THAT IT BECOMES FIXED IN 

03:27:49.887 --> 03:27:50.686
LITTLE BIT BUT NOT TO SUCH GORY 
DETAIL THAT IT BECOMES FIXED IN 
STONE AND IT'S TO DETAIL THAT'S 

03:27:50.688 --> 03:27:53.789
DETAIL THAT IT BECOMES FIXED IN 
STONE AND IT'S TO DETAIL THAT'S 
THAT'S THE BALANCE WE NEED TO   

03:27:53.791 --> 03:27:54.723
STONE AND IT'S TO DETAIL THAT'S 
THAT'S THE BALANCE WE NEED TO   
STRIKE SO SO I GUESS I WAS      

03:27:54.725 --> 03:27:58.126
THAT'S THE BALANCE WE NEED TO   
STRIKE SO SO I GUESS I WAS      
BEING HOPEFUL AS WE LOOK AT THE 

03:27:58.128 --> 03:27:58.794
STRIKE SO SO I GUESS I WAS      
BEING HOPEFUL AS WE LOOK AT THE 
REVISED PLAN THAT THIS WILL     

03:27:58.796 --> 03:28:01.730
BEING HOPEFUL AS WE LOOK AT THE 
REVISED PLAN THAT THIS WILL     
FLOW FROM THIS MORE CLEARLY AND 

03:28:01.732 --> 03:28:02.431
REVISED PLAN THAT THIS WILL     
FLOW FROM THIS MORE CLEARLY AND 
BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT, I      

03:28:02.433 --> 03:28:05.568
FLOW FROM THIS MORE CLEARLY AND 
BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT, I      
THINK I CAN LEAD TO THAT        

03:28:05.570 --> 03:28:06.368
BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT, I      
THINK I CAN LEAD TO THAT

WERE CREATED , IF THAT'S WHY    
WE'RE SEEING THIS SORT OF LIKE  

03:30:04.355 --> 03:30:11.660
WERE CREATED , IF THAT'S WHY    
WE'RE SEEING THIS SORT OF LIKE  
DISJOINTED LIST OF ACTIONS THAT 

03:30:11.662 --> 03:30:12.761
WE'RE SEEING THIS SORT OF LIKE  
DISJOINTED LIST OF ACTIONS THAT 
AREN'T ALWAYS AT THE SAME SORT  

03:30:12.763 --> 03:30:13.462
DISJOINTED LIST OF ACTIONS THAT 
AREN'T ALWAYS AT THE SAME SORT  
OF LIKE A LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY  

03:30:13.464 --> 03:30:16.831
AREN'T ALWAYS AT THE SAME SORT  
OF LIKE A LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY  
I DON'T I MEAN I WOULD I THINK  

03:30:16.833 --> 03:30:17.633
OF LIKE A LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY  
I DON'T I MEAN I WOULD I THINK  
IT MIGHT HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE 

03:30:17.635 --> 03:30:19.768
I DON'T I MEAN I WOULD I THINK  
IT MIGHT HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE 
PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAME TO     

03:30:19.770 --> 03:30:20.568
IT MIGHT HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE 
PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAME TO     
THESE THINGS BUT I DON'T THINK  

03:30:20.570 --> 03:30:21.236
PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAME TO     
THESE THINGS BUT I DON'T THINK  
IT WAS BASED IN LIKE WHAT WE    

03:30:21.238 --> 03:30:23.238
THESE THINGS BUT I DON'T THINK  
IT WAS BASED IN LIKE WHAT WE    
WERE HEARING FROM FROM PEOPLE   

03:30:23.240 --> 03:30:23.638
IT WAS BASED IN LIKE WHAT WE    
WERE HEARING FROM FROM PEOPLE   
AT ALL.                         

03:30:23.640 --> 03:30:24.639
WERE HEARING FROM FROM PEOPLE   
AT ALL.                         
I THINK I THINK LIKE WHAT I     

03:30:24.641 --> 03:30:27.742
AT ALL.                         
I THINK I THINK LIKE WHAT I     
WOULD EXPECT IS THAT IT'S BASED 

03:30:27.744 --> 03:30:28.410
I THINK I THINK LIKE WHAT I     
WOULD EXPECT IS THAT IT'S BASED 
IN THINGS THAT THE CONSULTANTS  

03:30:28.412 --> 03:30:31.746
WOULD EXPECT IS THAT IT'S BASED 
IN THINGS THAT THE CONSULTANTS  
HAVE SEEN IN OTHER CITIES OR    

03:30:31.748 --> 03:30:32.414
IN THINGS THAT THE CONSULTANTS  
HAVE SEEN IN OTHER CITIES OR    
LIKE SOME SORT OF KNOWLEDGE     

03:30:32.416 --> 03:30:35.951
HAVE SEEN IN OTHER CITIES OR    
LIKE SOME SORT OF KNOWLEDGE     
BASE IN ALL OF THE RESEARCH AND 

03:30:35.953 --> 03:30:36.518
LIKE SOME SORT OF KNOWLEDGE     
BASE IN ALL OF THE RESEARCH AND 
THAT'S WHY THEY HIRE THEM.      

03:30:36.520 --> 03:30:38.587
BASE IN ALL OF THE RESEARCH AND 
THAT'S WHY THEY HIRE THEM.      
>> WE HEARD THEM TO HELP GUIDE  

03:30:38.589 --> 03:30:42.390
THAT'S WHY THEY HIRE THEM.      
>> WE HEARD THEM TO HELP GUIDE  
US AND THEN WITH YOUR INPUT.    

03:30:42.392 --> 03:30:42.690
>> WE HEARD THEM TO HELP GUIDE  
US AND THEN WITH YOUR INPUT.    
YES.                            

03:30:42.692 --> 03:30:46.461
US AND THEN WITH YOUR INPUT.    
YES.                            
SO I'LL TAKE A I'LL START HERE. 

03:30:46.463 --> 03:30:50.298
YES.                            
SO I'LL TAKE A I'LL START HERE. 
I THINK THE VARYING LEVEL       

03:30:50.300 --> 03:30:51.166
SO I'LL TAKE A I'LL START HERE. 
I THINK THE VARYING LEVEL       
OF SPECIFICITY IS SORT OF BASED 

03:30:51.168 --> 03:30:54.502
I THINK THE VARYING LEVEL       
OF SPECIFICITY IS SORT OF BASED 
ON THE GOAL AREA.               

03:30:54.504 --> 03:30:57.138
OF SPECIFICITY IS SORT OF BASED 
ON THE GOAL AREA.               
>> SO LIKE HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE  

03:30:57.140 --> 03:30:58.072
ON THE GOAL AREA.               
>> SO LIKE HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE  
LENDS ITSELF MUCH MORE EASILY   

03:30:58.074 --> 03:31:01.877
>> SO LIKE HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE  
LENDS ITSELF MUCH MORE EASILY   
TO ZONING WHICH YOU CAN WRITE   

03:31:01.879 --> 03:31:02.478
LENDS ITSELF MUCH MORE EASILY   
TO ZONING WHICH YOU CAN WRITE   
MORE SPECIFICALLY YOU CAN SEE   

03:31:02.480 --> 03:31:05.046
TO ZONING WHICH YOU CAN WRITE   
MORE SPECIFICALLY YOU CAN SEE   
THESE RIGHT LIKE REDUCE OR      

03:31:05.048 --> 03:31:05.980
MORE SPECIFICALLY YOU CAN SEE   
THESE RIGHT LIKE REDUCE OR      
REMOVE REVIEW AND REWRITE LIKE  

03:31:05.982 --> 03:31:09.417
THESE RIGHT LIKE REDUCE OR      
REMOVE REVIEW AND REWRITE LIKE  
THESE ARE MORE SPECIFIC ACTIONS 

03:31:09.419 --> 03:31:10.252
REMOVE REVIEW AND REWRITE LIKE  
THESE ARE MORE SPECIFIC ACTIONS 
THAT TELL US WHAT TO DO AND     

03:31:10.254 --> 03:31:10.985
THESE ARE MORE SPECIFIC ACTIONS 
THAT TELL US WHAT TO DO AND     
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WITHIN    

03:31:10.987 --> 03:31:13.389
THAT TELL US WHAT TO DO AND     
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WITHIN    
OUR REALM AS PLANNING           

03:31:13.391 --> 03:31:14.056
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WITHIN    
OUR REALM AS PLANNING           
COMMISSIONERS, AS PLANNING      

03:31:14.058 --> 03:31:14.389
OUR REALM AS PLANNING           
COMMISSIONERS, AS PLANNING      
STAFF.                          

03:31:14.391 --> 03:31:17.659
COMMISSIONERS, AS PLANNING      
STAFF.                          
I THINK THEY PROBABLY FEEL MORE 

03:31:17.661 --> 03:31:20.429
STAFF.                          
I THINK THEY PROBABLY FEEL MORE 
VAGUE IN OTHER AREAS BECAUSE IF 

03:31:20.431 --> 03:31:21.362
I THINK THEY PROBABLY FEEL MORE 
VAGUE IN OTHER AREAS BECAUSE IF 
YOU SEE WHO LIKE THE LEAD,      

03:31:21.364 --> 03:31:22.063
VAGUE IN OTHER AREAS BECAUSE IF 
YOU SEE WHO LIKE THE LEAD,      
WE'RE NOT ALWAYS THE LEAD       

03:31:22.065 --> 03:31:24.499
YOU SEE WHO LIKE THE LEAD,      
WE'RE NOT ALWAYS THE LEAD       
AGENCY RIGHT.                   

03:31:24.501 --> 03:31:25.366
WE'RE NOT ALWAYS THE LEAD       
AGENCY RIGHT.                   
WE ARE ALSO ASSIGNING THINGS    

03:31:25.368 --> 03:31:29.004
AGENCY RIGHT.                   
WE ARE ALSO ASSIGNING THINGS    
FOR OTHER STAFF TO DO THAT WE   

03:31:29.006 --> 03:31:29.737
WE ARE ALSO ASSIGNING THINGS    
FOR OTHER STAFF TO DO THAT WE   
DON'T HAVE AN EXPERTIZE IN.     

03:31:29.739 --> 03:31:32.674
FOR OTHER STAFF TO DO THAT WE   
DON'T HAVE AN EXPERTIZE IN.     
SO IT IS BROADER AND BIGGER AND 

03:31:32.676 --> 03:31:33.609
DON'T HAVE AN EXPERTIZE IN.     
SO IT IS BROADER AND BIGGER AND 
IT IT'S SORT OF FOR THEM TO AND 

03:31:33.611 --> 03:31:37.512
SO IT IS BROADER AND BIGGER AND 
IT IT'S SORT OF FOR THEM TO AND 
THEY'VE REVIEWED THIS FOR THEM  

03:31:37.514 --> 03:31:38.647
IT IT'S SORT OF FOR THEM TO AND 
THEY'VE REVIEWED THIS FOR THEM  
TO SIGN OFF ON AND SAY OK SO I  

03:31:38.649 --> 03:31:40.949
THEY'VE REVIEWED THIS FOR THEM  
TO SIGN OFF ON AND SAY OK SO I  
THINK THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THIS 

03:31:40.951 --> 03:31:41.583
TO SIGN OFF ON AND SAY OK SO I  
THINK THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THIS 
VARYING LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY    

03:31:41.585 --> 03:31:44.586
THINK THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THIS 
VARYING LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY    
COMES FROM AND I GUESS I WOULD  

03:31:44.588 --> 03:31:45.453
VARYING LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY    
COMES FROM AND I GUESS I WOULD  
EXPECT GIVEN HOW HARD OF A      

03:31:45.455 --> 03:31:48.757
COMES FROM AND I GUESS I WOULD  
EXPECT GIVEN HOW HARD OF A      
TOPIC IT IS CURRENTLY THAT THE  

03:31:48.759 --> 03:31:49.624
EXPECT GIVEN HOW HARD OF A      
TOPIC IT IS CURRENTLY THAT THE  
HOUSING ONES WOULD BE TO THIS   

03:31:49.626 --> 03:31:52.894
TOPIC IT IS CURRENTLY THAT THE  
HOUSING ONES WOULD BE TO THIS   
LEVEL AND COMPARISON TO OTHER   

03:31:52.896 --> 03:31:53.895
HOUSING ONES WOULD BE TO THIS   
LEVEL AND COMPARISON TO OTHER   
ONES UM IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY

RIGHT.                          

03:31:57.000 --> 03:31:57.866
COME FROM.                      
RIGHT.                          
YOU START WITH YOUR GOAL THAT   

03:31:57.868 --> 03:31:58.600
RIGHT.                          
YOU START WITH YOUR GOAL THAT   
WE'VE AGREED ON AND THEN YES,   

03:31:58.602 --> 03:32:01.135
YOU START WITH YOUR GOAL THAT   
WE'VE AGREED ON AND THEN YES,   
THESE ARE KNOWN WAYS TO ACHIEVE 

03:32:01.137 --> 03:32:04.339
WE'VE AGREED ON AND THEN YES,   
THESE ARE KNOWN WAYS TO ACHIEVE 
THAT.                           

03:32:04.341 --> 03:32:05.540
THESE ARE KNOWN WAYS TO ACHIEVE 
THAT.                           
AT LEAST I CAN SPEAK TO THAT    

03:32:05.542 --> 03:32:08.309
THAT.                           
AT LEAST I CAN SPEAK TO THAT    
COMFORTABLY WITH THE HOUSING    

03:32:08.311 --> 03:32:09.177
AT LEAST I CAN SPEAK TO THAT    
COMFORTABLY WITH THE HOUSING    
SOME OF THEM THEY MAY HAVE      

03:32:09.179 --> 03:32:09.912
COMFORTABLY WITH THE HOUSING    
SOME OF THEM THEY MAY HAVE      
MISSED THE MARK A LITTLE BIT BY 

03:32:09.914 --> 03:32:11.412
SOME OF THEM THEY MAY HAVE      
MISSED THE MARK A LITTLE BIT BY 
SAYING FOUR BEDROOMS            

03:32:11.414 --> 03:32:12.347
MISSED THE MARK A LITTLE BIT BY 
SAYING FOUR BEDROOMS            
SPECIFICALLY BUT I DO THINK     

03:32:12.349 --> 03:32:13.048
SAYING FOUR BEDROOMS            
SPECIFICALLY BUT I DO THINK     
THAT GETS AT CONVERSATIONS      

03:32:13.050 --> 03:32:15.984
SPECIFICALLY BUT I DO THINK     
THAT GETS AT CONVERSATIONS      
WE'VE HAD HOUSING NOT BEING     

03:32:15.986 --> 03:32:16.618
THAT GETS AT CONVERSATIONS      
WE'VE HAD HOUSING NOT BEING     
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH AND THEN        

03:32:16.620 --> 03:32:19.354
WE'VE HAD HOUSING NOT BEING     
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH AND THEN        
WANTING TO DEFINE LIKE          

03:32:19.356 --> 03:32:20.155
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH AND THEN        
WANTING TO DEFINE LIKE          
DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSING TO   

03:32:20.157 --> 03:32:24.026
WANTING TO DEFINE LIKE          
DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSING TO   
FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT WE CAN DO  

03:32:24.028 --> 03:32:27.462
DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSING TO   
FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT WE CAN DO  
ABOUT THAT SO THAT THAT ONE I   

03:32:27.464 --> 03:32:28.463
FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT WE CAN DO  
ABOUT THAT SO THAT THAT ONE I   
CAN SEE HAS PROBABLY GONE AWRY  

03:32:28.465 --> 03:32:31.366
ABOUT THAT SO THAT THAT ONE I   
CAN SEE HAS PROBABLY GONE AWRY  
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY 

03:32:31.368 --> 03:32:32.334
CAN SEE HAS PROBABLY GONE AWRY  
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY 
TALK ABOUT THAT IN A STRATEGY   

03:32:32.336 --> 03:32:35.136
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY 
TALK ABOUT THAT IN A STRATEGY   
SO WE CAN WE CAN WORK ON THAT   

03:32:35.138 --> 03:32:35.938
TALK ABOUT THAT IN A STRATEGY   
SO WE CAN WE CAN WORK ON THAT   
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALIGN    

03:32:35.940 --> 03:32:36.271
SO WE CAN WE CAN WORK ON THAT   
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALIGN    
MORE.                           

03:32:36.273 --> 03:32:38.840
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALIGN    
MORE.                           
UM, THE AUTOMOBILE THING I      

03:32:38.842 --> 03:32:39.441
MORE.                           
UM, THE AUTOMOBILE THING I      
THINK THAT'S WHAT THE           

03:32:39.443 --> 03:32:40.108
UM, THE AUTOMOBILE THING I      
THINK THAT'S WHAT THE           
COLLAPSING OF DIFFERENT         

03:32:40.110 --> 03:32:42.944
THINK THAT'S WHAT THE           
COLLAPSING OF DIFFERENT         
DISTRICTS.                      

03:32:42.946 --> 03:32:43.378
COLLAPSING OF DIFFERENT

03:32:43.380 --> 03:32:44.546
DISTRICTS.                      
>> RIGHT.                       
WE HAVE TO AS WE TALKED ABOUT   

03:32:44.548 --> 03:32:47.082
>> RIGHT.                       
WE HAVE TO AS WE TALKED ABOUT   
BROADENING WHAT IS ALLOWED      

03:32:47.084 --> 03:32:47.749
WE HAVE TO AS WE TALKED ABOUT   
BROADENING WHAT IS ALLOWED      
THERE AT LEAST IN MY            

03:32:47.751 --> 03:32:48.349
BROADENING WHAT IS ALLOWED      
THERE AT LEAST IN MY            
RECOLLECTION OF OUR LAST

THERE AT LEAST IN MY            
RECOLLECTION OF OUR LAST

CONVERSATION OR COLLAPSING      
THINGS.                         
DO WE HAVE TO BROADEN THEM AND  

03:32:54.492 --> 03:32:55.690
THINGS.                         
DO WE HAVE TO BROADEN THEM AND  
SO NOW IT'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE   

03:32:55.692 --> 03:32:58.594
DO WE HAVE TO BROADEN THEM AND  
SO NOW IT'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE   
BOTH AND SO THAT I BELIEVE WAS  

03:32:58.596 --> 03:33:02.063
SO NOW IT'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE   
BOTH AND SO THAT I BELIEVE WAS  
BASED ON A CONVERSATION THAT WE 

03:33:02.065 --> 03:33:02.864
BOTH AND SO THAT I BELIEVE WAS  
BASED ON A CONVERSATION THAT WE 
ARE OUR INTERPRETATION OF HOW   

03:33:02.866 --> 03:33:03.532
BASED ON A CONVERSATION THAT WE 
ARE OUR INTERPRETATION OF HOW   
TO WRITE SOMETHING BASED ON OUR 

03:33:03.534 --> 03:33:06.467
ARE OUR INTERPRETATION OF HOW   
TO WRITE SOMETHING BASED ON OUR 
CONVERSATION THAT WASN'T MEANT  

03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:10.505
TO WRITE SOMETHING BASED ON OUR 
CONVERSATION THAT WASN'T MEANT  
TO SURPRISE WELL AND COME OUT   

03:33:10.507 --> 03:33:10.906
CONVERSATION THAT WASN'T MEANT  
TO SURPRISE WELL AND COME OUT   
OF NOWHERE.

TO SURPRISE WELL AND COME OUT   
OF NOWHERE.                     
SO YEAH, THESE ARE COMBINATION  

03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:14.709
OF NOWHERE.                     
SO YEAH, THESE ARE COMBINATION  
OF LIKE BEST PRACTICES THINGS   

03:33:14.711 --> 03:33:18.179
SO YEAH, THESE ARE COMBINATION  
OF LIKE BEST PRACTICES THINGS   
WE'VE HEARD OUR RESEARCH THINGS 

03:33:18.181 --> 03:33:18.880
OF LIKE BEST PRACTICES THINGS   
WE'VE HEARD OUR RESEARCH THINGS 
WE KNOW THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES

IT'S IT'S A COMPLETE AND        
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT UM, DOES   
THAT ANSWER ANYTHING THAT YOU

REMEMBER THE THE CALL-OUT THAT  
HAD OBJECTIVES IN THEM AND THE  

03:38:25.188 --> 03:38:26.120
REMEMBER THE THE CALL-OUT THAT  
HAD OBJECTIVES IN THEM AND THE

SO IN DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT WE  

03:38:32.596 --> 03:38:33.394
SOMEHOW TO THE STRATEGIES.      
SO IN DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT WE  
THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THAT THOSE

SO IN DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT WE  
THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THAT THOSE   
COULD BE EITHER INCLUDED

03:52:15.385 --> 03:52:16.183
NEW WATER TREATMENT PLANT.      
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF LIKE    
TEN YEARS VERSUS TWENTY YEARS   

03:52:16.185 --> 03:52:18.985
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF LIKE    
TEN YEARS VERSUS TWENTY YEARS   
BUT ANY FORM OF GROWTH THAT'S   

03:52:18.987 --> 03:52:19.687
TEN YEARS VERSUS TWENTY YEARS   
BUT ANY FORM OF GROWTH THAT'S   
GOING TO REQUIRE MORE WATER     

03:52:19.689 --> 03:52:22.023
BUT ANY FORM OF GROWTH THAT'S   
GOING TO REQUIRE MORE WATER     
TREATMENT AND IN FACT PERHAPS   

03:52:22.025 --> 03:52:22.623
GOING TO REQUIRE MORE WATER     
TREATMENT AND IN FACT PERHAPS   
THE NEW WATER SOURCE.           

03:52:22.625 --> 03:52:25.959
TREATMENT AND IN FACT PERHAPS   
THE NEW WATER SOURCE.           
SO MY MAIN QUESTION IS WHAT IS  

03:52:25.961 --> 03:52:29.530
THE NEW WATER SOURCE.           
SO MY MAIN QUESTION IS WHAT IS  
OUR PLAN EVEN IF WE DIDN'T SEE  

03:52:29.532 --> 03:52:30.731
SO MY MAIN QUESTION IS WHAT IS  
OUR PLAN EVEN IF WE DIDN'T SEE  
A BIG UPTICK IN THE RATE        

03:52:30.733 --> 03:52:34.134
OUR PLAN EVEN IF WE DIDN'T SEE  
A BIG UPTICK IN THE RATE        
OF GROWTH, WHAT IS OUR PLAN FOR 

03:52:34.136 --> 03:52:34.801
A BIG UPTICK IN THE RATE        
OF GROWTH, WHAT IS OUR PLAN FOR 
BUILDING NEW WATER TREATMENT    

03:52:34.803 --> 03:52:36.671
OF GROWTH, WHAT IS OUR PLAN FOR 
BUILDING NEW WATER TREATMENT    
PLANTS OR GETTING A NEW WATER   

03:52:36.673 --> 03:52:41.775
BUILDING NEW WATER TREATMENT    
PLANTS OR GETTING A NEW WATER   
SOURCE >> ABOUT THE BEST        

03:52:41.777 --> 03:52:42.443

03:52:42.445 --> 03:52:44.511
SOURCE >> ABOUT THE BEST        
OF WHAT THAT TIMEFRAME IS,      
WHETHER IT'S TEN YEARS OR 20    

03:52:44.513 --> 03:52:45.513
OF WHAT THAT TIMEFRAME IS,      
WHETHER IT'S TEN YEARS OR 20    
YEARS, I'D RATHER THOSE UPFRONT 

03:52:45.515 --> 03:52:46.113
WHETHER IT'S TEN YEARS OR 20    
YEARS, I'D RATHER THOSE UPFRONT 
CAPITAL COSTS BE DISTRIBUTED    

03:52:46.115 --> 03:52:48.949
YEARS, I'D RATHER THOSE UPFRONT 
CAPITAL COSTS BE DISTRIBUTED    
AMONG MORE RESIDENTS.           

03:52:48.951 --> 03:52:50.017
CAPITAL COSTS BE DISTRIBUTED    
AMONG MORE RESIDENTS.           
AS A PERSON WHO LIVES HERE I    

03:52:50.019 --> 03:52:53.020
AMONG MORE RESIDENTS.           
AS A PERSON WHO LIVES HERE I    
WILL PAY LESS TO SUPPORT THAT   

03:52:53.022 --> 03:52:55.989
AS A PERSON WHO LIVES HERE I    
WILL PAY LESS TO SUPPORT THAT   
NEW PLAN IF I IF I HAVE MORE    

03:52:55.991 --> 03:52:56.690

NEW PLAN IF I IF I HAVE MORE    
NEIGHBORS TO DISTRIBUTE THAT    

03:52:56.692 --> 03:53:00.127
NEW PLAN IF I IF I HAVE MORE    
NEIGHBORS TO DISTRIBUTE THAT    
NEW PLANTS COST ROSS AND I'LL   

03:53:00.129 --> 03:53:00.861
NEIGHBORS TO DISTRIBUTE THAT    
NEW PLANTS COST ROSS AND I'LL   
ALSO NOTE THAT RESIDENTS IN     

03:53:00.863 --> 03:53:03.798
NEW PLANTS COST ROSS AND I'LL   
ALSO NOTE THAT RESIDENTS IN     
NEWER DEVELOPMENTS BOTH RENTERS 

03:53:03.800 --> 03:53:04.598
ALSO NOTE THAT RESIDENTS IN     
NEWER DEVELOPMENTS BOTH RENTERS 
AND OWNERS WILL PAY MORE        

03:53:04.600 --> 03:53:07.934
NEWER DEVELOPMENTS BOTH RENTERS 
AND OWNERS WILL PAY MORE        
OF THIS CAPITAL COST BECAUSE    

03:53:07.936 --> 03:53:08.869
AND OWNERS WILL PAY MORE        
OF THIS CAPITAL COST BECAUSE    
NEW DEVELOPMENT PAYS HIGHER TAX 

03:53:08.871 --> 03:53:11.639
OF THIS CAPITAL COST BECAUSE    
NEW DEVELOPMENT PAYS HIGHER TAX 
RATES.                          

03:53:11.641 --> 03:53:12.707

WAS MENTIONED VERY BRIEFLY BUT  
GETTING DURING DISCONNECTS      

03:53:19.549 --> 03:53:20.214
WAS MENTIONED VERY BRIEFLY BUT  
GETTING DURING DISCONNECTS      
OF EXISTING HOUSING STOCK COULD 

03:53:20.216 --> 03:53:23.350
GETTING DURING DISCONNECTS      
OF EXISTING HOUSING STOCK COULD 
DECREASE THE WET WEATHER        

03:53:23.352 --> 03:53:26.987
OF EXISTING HOUSING STOCK COULD 
DECREASE THE WET WEATHER
