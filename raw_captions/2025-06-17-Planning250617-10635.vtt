AND THEN I'M LOOKING AT THE     
PLAN AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE    

00:44:43.615 --> 00:44:44.347
AND THEN I'M LOOKING AT THE

OF THESE ROADS GREW UP ST.      
CHARLOTTE STREET, THEIR         

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:47.316
OF THESE ROADS GREW UP ST.      
CHARLOTTE STREET, THEIR         
EXISTING IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.    

00:44:47.318 --> 00:44:47.917
CHARLOTTE STREET, THEIR         
EXISTING IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.    
IS THAT CORRECT?                

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:48.584
EXISTING IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.    
IS THAT CORRECT?                
SO I'M SAYING THAT IS THE       

00:44:48.586 --> 00:44:49.251
IS THAT CORRECT?                
SO I'M SAYING THAT IS THE       
EXISTING SURFACE BEING RETAINED 

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:49.985
SO I'M SAYING THAT IS THE       
EXISTING SURFACE BEING RETAINED 
FOR THE ROADS ON THE NEW ON     

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:50.453
EXISTING SURFACE BEING RETAINED 
FOR THE ROADS ON THE NEW ON     
THIS NEW PLAN.                  

00:44:50.455 --> 00:44:51.186

PUBLIC STREETS.                 
PUBLIC STREETS SERVE TO ACCESS  
LAND AND WE PUT STREET TREES    

00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:59.494
PUBLIC STREETS SERVE TO ACCESS  
LAND AND WE PUT STREET TREES    
ALONG PUBLIC STREETS.           

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:00.429
LAND AND WE PUT STREET TREES    
ALONG PUBLIC STREETS.           
THEN YOU HAVE A PRIVATE STREET  

00:50:00.431 --> 00:50:01.163
ALONG PUBLIC STREETS.           
THEN YOU HAVE A PRIVATE STREET  
AND BY DEFINITION A PRIVATE     

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:03.966
THEN YOU HAVE A PRIVATE STREET  
AND BY DEFINITION A PRIVATE     
STREET SERVES TO ACCESS PARCELS 

00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:04.966
AND BY DEFINITION A PRIVATE     
STREET SERVES TO ACCESS PARCELS 
OF LAND SO IT COULD BE IN A     

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:07.802
STREET SERVES TO ACCESS PARCELS 
OF LAND SO IT COULD BE IN A     
SUBDIVISION OF SINGLE FAMILY    

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:08.536
OF LAND SO IT COULD BE IN A     
SUBDIVISION OF SINGLE FAMILY    
DETACHED HOMES, PARCELS OF LAND 

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:11.874
SUBDIVISION OF SINGLE FAMILY    
DETACHED HOMES, PARCELS OF LAND 
COULD BE IN AN OFFICE COMPLEX,  

00:50:11.876 --> 00:50:15.243
DETACHED HOMES, PARCELS OF LAND 
COULD BE IN AN OFFICE COMPLEX,  
MAYBE A SITUATION, MAYBE.       

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.278
COULD BE IN AN OFFICE COMPLEX,  
MAYBE A SITUATION, MAYBE.       
AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE A SINGLE 

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.715
MAYBE A SITUATION, MAYBE.       
AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE A SINGLE 
SITE SUCH AS THIS THEN YOU HAVE 

00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:20.515
AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE A SINGLE 
SITE SUCH AS THIS THEN YOU HAVE 
PARKING LOT AND DRIVEWAYS THAT  

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:23.551
SITE SUCH AS THIS THEN YOU HAVE 
PARKING LOT AND DRIVEWAYS THAT  
ACCESS THE BUILDINGS.           

00:50:23.553 --> 00:50:27.556
PARKING LOT AND DRIVEWAYS THAT  
ACCESS THE BUILDINGS.           
SO IN THIS CASE THE DESIGN IS   

00:50:27.558 --> 00:50:28.657
ACCESS THE BUILDINGS.           
SO IN THIS CASE THE DESIGN IS   
LIKE A PRIVATE STREET BUT AND   

00:50:28.659 --> 00:50:32.027
SO IN THIS CASE THE DESIGN IS   
LIKE A PRIVATE STREET BUT AND   
IT'S STILL A SINGLE PARCEL AND  

00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:32.828
LIKE A PRIVATE STREET BUT AND   
IT'S STILL A SINGLE PARCEL AND  
WHAT THESE STREETS ARE DOING IS 

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:35.463
IT'S STILL A SINGLE PARCEL AND  
WHAT THESE STREETS ARE DOING IS 
JUST CONNECTING YOU FROM THE    

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:36.164
WHAT THESE STREETS ARE DOING IS 
JUST CONNECTING YOU FROM THE    
PUBLIC STREET TO THE BUILDING

STREET TO A PARCEL AND THEN     

00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.006
CONNECTING YOU FROM THE PUBLIC  
STREET TO A PARCEL AND THEN     
FROM THE PARCEL IT'S A LITTLE   

00:50:44.008 --> 00:50:46.808
STREET TO A PARCEL AND THEN     
FROM THE PARCEL IT'S A LITTLE   
DRIVEWAY WE'VE KEPT THE PRIVATE 

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:47.476
FROM THE PARCEL IT'S A LITTLE   
DRIVEWAY WE'VE KEPT THE PRIVATE 
STREET PART AND WE'VE GONE

00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:54.449
STREET PART AND WE'VE GONE      
RIGHT FROM IT'S A DRIVEWAY SO   
TO END BUT THE CODE CLEARLY IS  

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:55.250
RIGHT FROM IT'S A DRIVEWAY SO   
TO END BUT THE CODE CLEARLY IS  
DESIGNED FOR MORE TRADITIONAL

VARIOUS BUILDINGS INSIDE BUT    
IT'S VEHICULAR USE AREA.        
YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE ALSO WITH

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:30.165
CORRECT.                        
WE ARE PLANTING THAT MANY TREES 
IN TOTAL SO WE HAVE THE KILLER  

00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:33.268
WE ARE PLANTING THAT MANY TREES 
IN TOTAL SO WE HAVE THE KILLER  
USE AREA TREES RIGHT.           

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.269
IN TOTAL SO WE HAVE THE KILLER  
USE AREA TREES RIGHT.           
WE KNOW THAT TREES THAT WE WANT 

00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:37.339
USE AREA TREES RIGHT.           
WE KNOW THAT TREES THAT WE WANT 
TO COUNT TOWARDS VEHICULAR USE  

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:41.209
WE KNOW THAT TREES THAT WE WANT 
TO COUNT TOWARDS VEHICULAR USE  
AND THEN WE HAVE MITIGATION     

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:41.509
TO COUNT TOWARDS VEHICULAR USE  
AND THEN WE HAVE MITIGATION     
TREES.                          

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.311
AND THEN WE HAVE MITIGATION     
TREES.                          
THERE ARE A FEW LAMARK TREES    

00:54:42.313 --> 00:54:43.044
TREES.                          
THERE ARE A FEW LAMARK TREES    
WHERE WE'RE MOVING AND WE'RE    

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:49.117
THERE ARE A FEW LAMARK TREES    
WHERE WE'RE MOVING AND WE'RE    
MITIGATING THOSE                

00:55:02.165 --> 00:55:03.965
                 AND THEN WE    
HAVE PUBLIC STREET TREES BEING  
PLANTED.                        

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:10.205
HAVE PUBLIC STREET TREES BEING  
PLANTED.                        
SO ON THIS GRAPHIC              

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:24.419
                   THE BLUE

00:55:25.022 --> 00:55:25.687
LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION TREES,   
THE YELLOW TREES ARE THE        
MITIGATION TREES AND THEN I     

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:26.487
THE YELLOW TREES ARE THE        
MITIGATION TREES AND THEN I     
GUESS IT'S ORANGE IT'S KIND     

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:27.155
MITIGATION TREES AND THEN I     
GUESS IT'S ORANGE IT'S KIND     
OF RED HERE BUT ORANGE ON THE   

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:28.023
GUESS IT'S ORANGE IT'S KIND     
OF RED HERE BUT ORANGE ON THE   
PLAN WOULD BE THE PUBLIC STREET 

00:55:28.025 --> 00:55:28.223
OF RED HERE BUT ORANGE ON THE   
PLAN WOULD BE THE PUBLIC STREET 
TREES.                          

00:55:28.225 --> 00:55:28.824
