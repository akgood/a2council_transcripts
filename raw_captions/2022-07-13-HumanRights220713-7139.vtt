00:28:07.145 --> 00:28:11.014
OF THESE PROPOSALS.             
AND SO I THINK TO TO            
COMMISSIONER GARBER&amp;apos;S POINT,    

00:28:11.016 --> 00:28:11.748
AND SO I THINK TO TO            
COMMISSIONER GARBER&amp;apos;S POINT,    
THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THE      

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.584

THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THE      
SECOND ONE INCLUDING XPAC AS    
WELL.                           

00:28:14.986 --> 00:28:15.919
SECOND ONE INCLUDING XPAC AS

00:28:15.921 --> 00:28:16.720
WELL.                           
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THAT THE RESOLVED 
CLAUSES BETWEEN THE TWO ARE SO  

00:28:16.722 --> 00:28:19.188
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THAT THE RESOLVED 
CLAUSES BETWEEN THE TWO ARE SO  
SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAT    

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.922
CLAUSES BETWEEN THE TWO ARE SO  
SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAT    
THE EFFECT WOULD CHANGE MUCH    

00:28:19.924 --> 00:28:22.926
SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAT    
THE EFFECT WOULD CHANGE MUCH    
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.            

00:28:22.928 --> 00:28:24.093
THE EFFECT WOULD CHANGE MUCH    
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.            
SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU SUGGEST   

00:28:24.095 --> 00:28:26.830
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.            
SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU SUGGEST   
WE DO WANT TO DO WHICH ONE      

00:28:26.832 --> 00:28:30.367
SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU SUGGEST   
WE DO WANT TO DO WHICH ONE

SAY I WON&amp;apos;T BE INVOLVED IN THE  

00:48:45.516 --> 00:48:46.081

00:48:50.487 --> 00:48:53.154

THEY&amp;apos;RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT A   

00:48:53.156 --> 00:48:53.755
PROFESSORS AND I BELIEVE THAT   
THEY&amp;apos;RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT A   
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE
