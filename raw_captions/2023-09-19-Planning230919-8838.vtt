OF THESE AMENDMENTS?            
FIRST OFF IN OUR RESEARCH       
OF COMPARABLE COMMUNITIES WE    

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.092
FIRST OFF IN OUR RESEARCH       
OF COMPARABLE COMMUNITIES WE    
FOUND THAT MOST DO NOT HAVE     

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:56.794
OF COMPARABLE COMMUNITIES WE    
FOUND THAT MOST DO NOT HAVE     
PREMIUMS AND MOST REGULATE

HYP BUT THEY DON&apos;T DO IT WITH   
BOTH.                           
WE FOUND THAT ELIMINATING THE   

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:07.771
BOTH.                           
WE FOUND THAT ELIMINATING THE   
FACTOR AND RATHER REGULATING    

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:08.571
WE FOUND THAT ELIMINATING THE   
FACTOR AND RATHER REGULATING

THE PROCESS IT MAKES IT EASIER  
FOR CITY ADMINISTRATION AS PART 
OF THE REVIEW ESSENTIALLY WE    

00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:22.318
FOR CITY ADMINISTRATION AS PART 
OF THE REVIEW ESSENTIALLY WE    
FOUND THAT UTILIZING BOTH FFR   

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.353
OF THE REVIEW ESSENTIALLY WE    
FOUND THAT UTILIZING BOTH FFR   
AND HEIGHT WAS COMPLEX AND NOT  

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:26.823
FOUND THAT UTILIZING BOTH FFR   
AND HEIGHT WAS COMPLEX AND NOT  
NECESSARILY WOULD AFFECT THE    

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:30.160
AND HEIGHT WAS COMPLEX AND NOT  
NECESSARILY WOULD AFFECT THE    
DEVELOPMENT MASSING IN THE      

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:30.861
NECESSARILY WOULD AFFECT THE    
DEVELOPMENT MASSING IN THE      
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND  

00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:33.930
DEVELOPMENT MASSING IN THE      
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND  
WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT A        

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:34.731
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND  
WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT A        
LIMITING FACTOR ON DEVELOPMENT  

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:35.131
WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT A        
LIMITING FACTOR ON DEVELOPMENT  
IN THE DOWNTOWN.                

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.367
LIMITING FACTOR ON DEVELOPMENT  
IN THE DOWNTOWN.                
IT WAS HEIGHT WAS LIVING IN     

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:37.901
IN THE DOWNTOWN.                
IT WAS HEIGHT WAS LIVING IN     
RESTRICTING FACTOR.             

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:38.702
IT WAS HEIGHT WAS LIVING IN     
RESTRICTING FACTOR.             
SO BY LIMITING RAFAAT YOU&apos;RE    

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:41.704
RESTRICTING FACTOR.             
SO BY LIMITING RAFAAT YOU&apos;RE    
REALLY NOT AFFECTING WHAT CAN   

00:20:41.706 --> 00:20:45.441
SO BY LIMITING RAFAAT YOU&apos;RE    
REALLY NOT AFFECTING WHAT CAN   
BE BUILT IN THE DOWNTOWN.       

00:20:45.443 --> 00:20:46.509
REALLY NOT AFFECTING WHAT CAN   
BE BUILT IN THE DOWNTOWN.       
WE DO NOT THAT WE ARE NOT       

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:47.143
BE BUILT IN THE DOWNTOWN.       
WE DO NOT THAT WE ARE NOT       
MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE       

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:49.746
WE DO NOT THAT WE ARE NOT       
MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE       
HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS ARE           

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:50.413
MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE       
HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS ARE           
SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE      

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:51.081
HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS ARE           
SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE      
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT       

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.483
SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE      
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT       
PROVISION THAT ARE STILL STILL  

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:53.816
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT       
PROVISION THAT ARE STILL STILL

DOING THIS AS YOU&apos;VE ALREADY    
LIMITED FBAR CONSIDERATIONS IN  

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:01.991
DOING THIS AS YOU&apos;VE ALREADY    
LIMITED FBAR CONSIDERATIONS IN  
THE TCW AND AGAIN YOU REGULATE  

00:21:01.993 --> 00:21:02.659
LIMITED FBAR CONSIDERATIONS IN  
THE TCW AND AGAIN YOU REGULATE  
THAT THROUGH HEIGHT AND         

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:05.462
THE TCW AND AGAIN YOU REGULATE  
THAT THROUGH HEIGHT AND         
SETBACKS AS WELL.               

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:06.329
THAT THROUGH HEIGHT AND         
SETBACKS AS WELL.               
AND LASTLY AND PERHAPS MOST

AND LASTLY AND PERHAPS MOST     
IMPORTANTLY, THE CITY NOW IS    

00:21:06.998 --> 00:21:09.232
AND LASTLY AND PERHAPS MOST     
IMPORTANTLY, THE CITY NOW IS    
UNDERGOING A COMPREHENSIVE      

00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:10.032
IMPORTANTLY, THE CITY NOW IS    
UNDERGOING A COMPREHENSIVE      
PROCESS WHERE THE ISSUE         

00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:10.700
UNDERGOING A COMPREHENSIVE      
PROCESS WHERE THE ISSUE         
OF HEIGHT IN THE DOWNTOWN       

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:13.770
PROCESS WHERE THE ISSUE         
OF HEIGHT IN THE DOWNTOWN       
PROBABLY SHOULD AND COULD BE    

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:14.438
OF HEIGHT IN THE DOWNTOWN       
PROBABLY SHOULD AND COULD BE    
DISCUSSED THAT PROCESS IN       

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.171
PROBABLY SHOULD AND COULD BE    
DISCUSSED THAT PROCESS IN       
CONTEXT OF THE LARGER CITY      

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:17.240
DISCUSSED THAT PROCESS IN       
CONTEXT OF THE LARGER CITY      
GOALS WAS TRYING TO BE          

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:17.607
CONTEXT OF THE LARGER CITY      
GOALS WAS TRYING TO BE          
ACHIEVED.                       

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:22.311
GOALS WAS TRYING TO BE          
ACHIEVED.                       
SO AGAIN, JUST TO REITERATE THE 

00:21:22.313 --> 00:21:25.949
ACHIEVED.                       
SO AGAIN, JUST TO REITERATE THE 
REGULATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO   

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.385
SO AGAIN, JUST TO REITERATE THE 
REGULATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO   
REMAIN THAT WE RECOMMENDING IS  

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:29.186
REGULATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO   
REMAIN THAT WE RECOMMENDING IS  
FROM A MARKETING STANDPOINT     

00:21:29.188 --> 00:21:30.053
REMAIN THAT WE RECOMMENDING IS  
FROM A MARKETING STANDPOINT     
STILL GOING TO REGULATE MACING  

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:32.955
FROM A MARKETING STANDPOINT     
STILL GOING TO REGULATE MACING  
THROUGH THE CHARACTERS OWNS THE 

00:21:32.957 --> 00:21:33.590
STILL GOING TO REGULATE MACING  
THROUGH THE CHARACTERS OWNS THE 
FRONT SET BACKS WILL REMAIN.    

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:36.759
THROUGH THE CHARACTERS OWNS THE 
FRONT SET BACKS WILL REMAIN.    
THERE&apos;S NO PROPOSAL CHANGE TO   

00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:37.360
FRONT SET BACKS WILL REMAIN.    
THERE&apos;S NO PROPOSAL CHANGE TO   
THAT AND THE HEIGHT             

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:40.296
THERE&apos;S NO PROPOSAL CHANGE TO   
THAT AND THE HEIGHT             
RESTRICTIONS WILL STILL REMAIN  

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:41.298
THAT AND THE HEIGHT             
RESTRICTIONS WILL STILL REMAIN  
SO FOR THAT REASON WE DO THINK  

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:41.965
RESTRICTIONS WILL STILL REMAIN  
SO FOR THAT REASON WE DO THINK  
THAT THE FAMILIAR BUILDING      

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.767
SO FOR THAT REASON WE DO THINK  
THAT THE FAMILIAR BUILDING      
FORMS YOU SEE TODAY WILL REMAIN 

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:45.435
THAT THE FAMILIAR BUILDING      
FORMS YOU SEE TODAY WILL REMAIN 
SINCE THE BUILDING MASSINA AND  

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:46.335
FORMS YOU SEE TODAY WILL REMAIN 
SINCE THE BUILDING MASSINA AND  
SETBACKS ARE NOT PROPOSED TO    

00:21:46.337 --> 00:21:49.006
SINCE THE BUILDING MASSINA AND  
SETBACKS ARE NOT PROPOSED TO    
CHANGE THAT WE WERE ELIMINATING 

00:21:49.008 --> 00:21:49.873
SETBACKS ARE NOT PROPOSED TO    
CHANGE THAT WE WERE ELIMINATING 
THE FAA ARE AS PART OF THE      

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:53.010
CHANGE THAT WE WERE ELIMINATING 
THE FAA ARE AS PART OF THE      
EQUATION AND LASTLY AS I KNOW   

00:21:53.012 --> 00:21:53.810
THE FAA ARE AS PART OF THE      
EQUATION AND LASTLY AS I KNOW   
AT THE HEIGHT BONUS WILL ALSO   

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:56.079
EQUATION AND LASTLY AS I KNOW   
AT THE HEIGHT BONUS WILL ALSO   
REMAIN AS IS MOVING AS WELL.    

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:59.716
AT THE HEIGHT BONUS WILL ALSO   
REMAIN AS IS MOVING AS WELL.    
LAST SLIDE I BELIEVE SO IT&apos;S    

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:00.750
REMAIN AS IS MOVING AS WELL.    
LAST SLIDE I BELIEVE SO IT&apos;S    
ALSO IMPORTANT TO TO WHEN YOU   

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:03.854
LAST SLIDE I BELIEVE SO IT&apos;S    
ALSO IMPORTANT TO TO WHEN YOU   
CONSIDER ZONING AMENDMENTS      

00:22:03.856 --> 00:22:04.620
ALSO IMPORTANT TO TO WHEN YOU   
CONSIDER ZONING AMENDMENTS      
IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT THE  

00:22:04.622 --> 00:22:08.025
CONSIDER ZONING AMENDMENTS      
IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT THE  
IMPLICATIONS ARE, WHAT THE      

00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:08.825
IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT THE  
IMPLICATIONS ARE, WHAT THE      
CONSEQUENCES ARE AND WHAT SOME  

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.794
IMPLICATIONS ARE, WHAT THE      
CONSEQUENCES ARE AND WHAT SOME  
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES MAY BE. 

00:22:11.796 --> 00:22:12.829
CONSEQUENCES ARE AND WHAT SOME  
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES MAY BE. 
I&apos;VE ADDRESSED MOST OF THESE IN 

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:15.264
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES MAY BE. 
I&apos;VE ADDRESSED MOST OF THESE IN 
THE PRESENTATION BUT I JUST     

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:16.133
I&apos;VE ADDRESSED MOST OF THESE IN 
THE PRESENTATION BUT I JUST     
WANT TO REITERATE AGAIN ONCE    

00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:16.799
THE PRESENTATION BUT I JUST     
WANT TO REITERATE AGAIN ONCE    
AGAIN MOST COMPARABLE           

00:22:16.801 --> 00:22:19.603
WANT TO REITERATE AGAIN ONCE    
AGAIN MOST COMPARABLE           
COMMUNITIES DO NOT REGULATE THE 

00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:20.203
AGAIN MOST COMPARABLE           
COMMUNITIES DO NOT REGULATE THE 
FAA ARE IN HEIGHT.              

00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:23.339
COMMUNITIES DO NOT REGULATE THE 
FAA ARE IN HEIGHT.              
THEY PICK ONE TO REGULATE       

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:24.408
FAA ARE IN HEIGHT.              
THEY PICK ONE TO REGULATE       
MAXIMUM AND MOST DO NOT HAVE    

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.275
THEY PICK ONE TO REGULATE       
MAXIMUM AND MOST DO NOT HAVE    
ANY SORT OF PREMIUM MEASURE IN  

00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:27.577
MAXIMUM AND MOST DO NOT HAVE    
ANY SORT OF PREMIUM MEASURE IN  
THEIR ORDINANCE.                

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:28.511
ANY SORT OF PREMIUM MEASURE IN  
THEIR ORDINANCE.                
WE DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S GOING TO 

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.312
THEIR ORDINANCE.                
WE DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S GOING TO 
BE AN INCREASE IN BILLABLE AREA 

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:31.214
WE DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S GOING TO 
BE AN INCREASE IN BILLABLE AREA 
SINCE THE HEIGHT AGAIN IS THAT  

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:31.848
BE AN INCREASE IN BILLABLE AREA 
SINCE THE HEIGHT AGAIN IS THAT  
MOST OF THE LIMITING FACTOR     

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.582
SINCE THE HEIGHT AGAIN IS THAT  
MOST OF THE LIMITING FACTOR     
THAT WE STUDY FOR THE RECENT    

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:34.718
MOST OF THE LIMITING FACTOR     
THAT WE STUDY FOR THE RECENT    
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DOWNTOWN?   

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.719
THAT WE STUDY FOR THE RECENT    
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DOWNTOWN?   
HOWEVER, WE DO KNOW IT IS       

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:36.486
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DOWNTOWN?   
HOWEVER, WE DO KNOW IT IS       
PROBABLY LIKELY THAT IT&apos;S GOING 

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:38.822
HOWEVER, WE DO KNOW IT IS       
PROBABLY LIKELY THAT IT&apos;S GOING 
BE EASIER TO REACH THE MAXIMUM  

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:39.489
PROBABLY LIKELY THAT IT&apos;S GOING 
BE EASIER TO REACH THE MAXIMUM  
HEIGHT BECAUSE OF THOSE FAA     

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:40.090
BE EASIER TO REACH THE MAXIMUM  
HEIGHT BECAUSE OF THOSE FAA     
RESTRICTIONS ARE REMOVED.       

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:43.193
HEIGHT BECAUSE OF THOSE FAA     
RESTRICTIONS ARE REMOVED.       
WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE SIMILAR    

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:43.994
RESTRICTIONS ARE REMOVED.       
WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE SIMILAR    
BUILDING FORMS BECAUSE AGAIN WE 

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:45.929
WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE SIMILAR    
BUILDING FORMS BECAUSE AGAIN WE 
ARE NOT CHANGING HEIGHT MASSEN

BUILDING FORMS BECAUSE AGAIN WE 
ARE NOT CHANGING HEIGHT MASSEN  
OR BUILDING FRONT SETBACKS.

THAT IN ORDER TO EVEN REACH THE 
MAX HEIGHT THAT WAS ALLOWABLE   

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.230
THAT IN ORDER TO EVEN REACH THE 
MAX HEIGHT THAT WAS ALLOWABLE   
THEY WERE NEEDING PREMIUM&apos;S     

00:46:09.232 --> 00:46:10.232
MAX HEIGHT THAT WAS ALLOWABLE   
THEY WERE NEEDING PREMIUM&apos;S     
BECAUSE THEY ARE WAS CAPPED OR  

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:13.969
THEY WERE NEEDING PREMIUM&apos;S     
BECAUSE THEY ARE WAS CAPPED OR  
OUR BASE F.R. WAS SO SMALL THAT 

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:14.770
BECAUSE THEY ARE WAS CAPPED OR  
OUR BASE F.R. WAS SO SMALL THAT 
YOU JUST COULDN&apos;T GO UP TO ONE  

00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:17.372
OUR BASE F.R. WAS SO SMALL THAT 
YOU JUST COULDN&apos;T GO UP TO ONE  
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET UNLESS  

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:18.473
YOU JUST COULDN&apos;T GO UP TO ONE  
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET UNLESS  
YOU TOOK THAT YOU TOOK THE FFA  

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:22.143
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET UNLESS  
YOU TOOK THAT YOU TOOK THE FFA  
PREMIUM AND THEN YOU DIDN&apos;T     

00:46:22.145 --> 00:46:22.878
YOU TOOK THAT YOU TOOK THE FFA  
PREMIUM AND THEN YOU DIDN&apos;T     
ACTUALLY EVEN MAX OUT ON ALL    

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.211
PREMIUM AND THEN YOU DIDN&apos;T     
ACTUALLY EVEN MAX OUT ON ALL    
THAT FAR.                       

00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:25.614
ACTUALLY EVEN MAX OUT ON ALL    
THAT FAR.                       
YOU COULD HAVE BECAUSE THE      

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:26.248
THAT FAR.                       
YOU COULD HAVE BECAUSE THE      
HEIGHT CAPPED YOU RIGHT.        

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.451
YOU COULD HAVE BECAUSE THE      
HEIGHT CAPPED YOU RIGHT.        
YEAH YEAH IT IS UNCLEAR THEY    

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:30.252
HEIGHT CAPPED YOU RIGHT.        
YEAH YEAH IT IS UNCLEAR THEY    
DIDN&apos;T MAX OUT JUST BECAUSE     

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:30.986
YEAH YEAH IT IS UNCLEAR THEY    
DIDN&apos;T MAX OUT JUST BECAUSE     
THAT WAS THE DESIGN AND THEY    

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:33.455
DIDN&apos;T MAX OUT JUST BECAUSE     
THAT WAS THE DESIGN AND THEY    
WERE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT OR IF 

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:34.322
THAT WAS THE DESIGN AND THEY    
WERE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT OR IF 
THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO TO  

00:46:34.324 --> 00:46:40.261
WERE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT OR IF 
THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO TO  
GO MORE BUT TO MEET OUR GOALS   

00:46:40.263 --> 00:46:41.229
THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO TO  
GO MORE BUT TO MEET OUR GOALS   
OF MAKING IT MUCH EASIER BUT    

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:45.100
GO MORE BUT TO MEET OUR GOALS   
OF MAKING IT MUCH EASIER BUT    
KNOWING THERE YOU HAVE TO DRAW  

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:45.867
OF MAKING IT MUCH EASIER BUT    
KNOWING THERE YOU HAVE TO DRAW  
A LINE IN THE SAND SOMEWHERE.   

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:46.535
KNOWING THERE YOU HAVE TO DRAW  
A LINE IN THE SAND SOMEWHERE.   
SO WE&apos;RE THE HEIGHT LIMIT       

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:48.770
A LINE IN THE SAND SOMEWHERE.   
SO WE&apos;RE THE HEIGHT LIMIT       
REMAINS THE MACING A BUILDING   

00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:49.471
SO WE&apos;RE THE HEIGHT LIMIT       
REMAINS THE MACING A BUILDING   
ARTICULATION, THE MODULES,      

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:52.474
REMAINS THE MACING A BUILDING

ACRES I&apos;M PIONEER TRAIL.        

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:02.072
BACK IN AND THOSE ARE THE TEN   
ACRES I&apos;M PIONEER TRAIL.        
THE REASON WE DID THAT FOR      

02:08:02.074 --> 02:08:02.706
ACRES I&apos;M PIONEER TRAIL.        
THE REASON WE DID THAT FOR      
DENSITY ALTHOUGH I THINK WE     

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:03.374
THE REASON WE DID THAT FOR      
DENSITY ALTHOUGH I THINK WE     
WOULD HAVE MET THE DENSITY      

02:08:03.376 --> 02:08:06.009
DENSITY ALTHOUGH I THINK WE     
WOULD HAVE MET THE DENSITY      
WITHOUT BUT REALLY THE OPEN     

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:06.677
WOULD HAVE MET THE DENSITY      
WITHOUT BUT REALLY THE OPEN     
SPACE THE OPEN SPACE IS SIXTY   

02:08:06.679 --> 02:08:07.144
WITHOUT BUT REALLY THE OPEN     
SPACE THE OPEN SPACE IS SIXTY   
FIVE PERCENT.                   

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:09.079
SPACE THE OPEN SPACE IS SIXTY   
FIVE PERCENT.                   
IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO       

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:09.947
FIVE PERCENT.                   
IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO       
WITHOUT BUYING ADDITIONAL LAND. 

02:08:09.949 --> 02:08:12.482
IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO       
WITHOUT BUYING ADDITIONAL LAND. 
SO WE HAD IDENTIFIED A LONG     

02:08:12.484 --> 02:08:13.483
WITHOUT BUYING ADDITIONAL LAND. 
SO WE HAD IDENTIFIED A LONG     
TIME AGO JUST TOOK TIME TO GET  

02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:13.884
SO WE HAD IDENTIFIED A LONG     
TIME AGO JUST TOOK TIME TO GET  
THE ANNEXATION.                 

02:08:13.886 --> 02:08:16.486
TIME AGO JUST TOOK TIME TO GET  
THE ANNEXATION.                 
SO THAT REALLY IS THE PURPOSE   

02:08:16.488 --> 02:08:17.187
THE ANNEXATION.                 
SO THAT REALLY IS THE PURPOSE   
MEANING YOUR OPEN SPACE.

03:25:33.921 --> 03:25:34.787
I THINK THAT JUST MAKES THE     
CONVERSATION A LITTLE BIT       
BETTER BECAUSE IT SORT OF PUTS  

03:25:34.789 --> 03:25:36.522
CONVERSATION A LITTLE BIT       
BETTER BECAUSE IT SORT OF PUTS  
THE STAFF AGAINST THE COUNCIL   

03:25:36.524 --> 03:25:37.456
BETTER BECAUSE IT SORT OF PUTS  
THE STAFF AGAINST THE COUNCIL   
OR AGAINST THE TABLE AND I      

03:25:37.458 --> 03:25:38.257
THE STAFF AGAINST THE COUNCIL

03:26:07.855 --> 03:26:08.420
ARGUMENT FOR US AS WE&apos;RE SORT   
OF TRYING TO IMPROVE WHAT WE&apos;RE 
DOING WITH THAT CITY.           

03:26:08.422 --> 03:26:09.421
OF TRYING TO IMPROVE WHAT WE&apos;RE 
DOING WITH THAT CITY.           
SO SO I FULLY SUPPORT WHERE     

03:26:09.423 --> 03:26:13.826
DOING WITH THAT CITY.           
SO SO I FULLY SUPPORT WHERE     
YOU&apos;RE GOING, COMMISSIONER.     

03:26:13.828 --> 03:26:18.531
SO SO I FULLY SUPPORT WHERE     
YOU&apos;RE GOING, COMMISSIONER.     
MR. SELBY, I JUST HAD SOME      

03:26:18.533 --> 03:26:19.264
YOU&apos;RE GOING, COMMISSIONER.     
MR. SELBY, I JUST HAD SOME      
QUICK MATH BUT IF WE&apos;RE LOOKING 

03:26:19.266 --> 03:26:22.200
MR. SELBY, I JUST HAD SOME      
QUICK MATH BUT IF WE&apos;RE LOOKING 
AT FRONTAGE WITH OUR WINDY      

03:26:22.202 --> 03:26:23.001
QUICK MATH BUT IF WE&apos;RE LOOKING 
AT FRONTAGE WITH OUR WINDY      
WOULD BE FIVE INSTEAD OF SIX    

03:26:23.003 --> 03:26:26.204
AT FRONTAGE WITH OUR WINDY      
WOULD BE FIVE INSTEAD OF SIX    
PARCELS COULD BE A LOT SPLIT.   

03:26:26.206 --> 03:26:27.072
WOULD BE FIVE INSTEAD OF SIX    
PARCELS COULD BE A LOT SPLIT.   
SO THAT IS ACTUALLY MORE THE    

03:26:27.074 --> 03:26:29.642
PARCELS COULD BE A LOT SPLIT.   
SO THAT IS ACTUALLY MORE THE    
LIMITING FACTOR THAN THE FIVE   

03:26:29.644 --> 03:26:30.376
SO THAT IS ACTUALLY MORE THE    
LIMITING FACTOR THAN THE FIVE   
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MINIMUM    

03:26:30.378 --> 03:26:33.445
LIMITING FACTOR THAN THE FIVE   
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MINIMUM    
LOT SIZE IT&apos;S A LOT FRONTAGE    

03:26:33.447 --> 03:26:34.446
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MINIMUM    
LOT SIZE IT&apos;S A LOT FRONTAGE    
JUST FOR MORE SPATIAL CONTEXT
