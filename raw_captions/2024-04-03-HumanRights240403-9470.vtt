FIND OUT WHAT DATA THEY HAVE.   
WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW AND SO   
WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE I MEAN    

00:28:50.425 --> 00:28:51.024
WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW AND SO   
WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE I MEAN    
THEY PUT SOMETHING ON A         

00:28:51.026 --> 00:28:54.060
WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE I MEAN    
THEY PUT SOMETHING ON A         
DASHBOARD BECAUSE IT'S NOT      

00:28:54.062 --> 00:28:54.727
THEY PUT SOMETHING ON A         
DASHBOARD BECAUSE IT'S NOT      
ENOUGH FOR GOOD ANALYSIS.       

00:28:54.729 --> 00:28:58.331
DASHBOARD BECAUSE IT'S NOT      
ENOUGH FOR GOOD ANALYSIS.       
THEY REALLY NEED TO DO THE      

00:28:58.333 --> 00:28:59.132
ENOUGH FOR GOOD ANALYSIS.       
THEY REALLY NEED TO DO THE      
WHOLE KIND OF AND IN FACT THEY  

00:28:59.134 --> 00:29:01.434
THEY REALLY NEED TO DO THE      
WHOLE KIND OF AND IN FACT THEY  
NEED TO DO TO COLLECT MORE DATA 

00:29:01.436 --> 00:29:02.168
WHOLE KIND OF AND IN FACT THEY  
NEED TO DO TO COLLECT MORE DATA 
THAN THEY'RE NOW COLLECTING     

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.838
NEED TO DO TO COLLECT MORE DATA 
THAN THEY'RE NOW COLLECTING     
LIKE DATA THAT THEY COLLECTED   

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.575
THAN THEY'RE NOW COLLECTING     
LIKE DATA THAT THEY COLLECTED   
BEFORE ONLY HAS TO DO WITH WHAT 

00:29:09.577 --> 00:29:10.176
LIKE DATA THAT THEY COLLECTED   
BEFORE ONLY HAS TO DO WITH WHAT 
HAPPENED AT THE TRAFFIC STOP    

00:29:10.178 --> 00:29:13.746
BEFORE ONLY HAS TO DO WITH WHAT 
HAPPENED AT THE TRAFFIC STOP    
BUT NOT NECESSARY WHAT HAPPENED 

00:29:13.748 --> 00:29:15.381
HAPPENED AT THE TRAFFIC STOP    
BUT NOT NECESSARY WHAT HAPPENED 
NEXT LIKE WHERE PEOPLE WHERE
