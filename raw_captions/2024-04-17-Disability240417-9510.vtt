SO THE SELF EVALUATION PROCESS  
WE LOOKED AT FACILITIES AND OUR 
OUR EFFORT WAS TO IDENTIFY      

00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:19.807
WE LOOKED AT FACILITIES AND OUR 
OUR EFFORT WAS TO IDENTIFY      
BARRIERS SO WE ONLY CAPTURED    

00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:22.743
OUR EFFORT WAS TO IDENTIFY      
BARRIERS SO WE ONLY CAPTURED    
BARRIERS THAT WE SAW.

BARRIERS SO WE ONLY CAPTURED    
BARRIERS THAT WE SAW.           
WE ASSESSED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED   

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:26.847
BARRIERS THAT WE SAW.           
WE ASSESSED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.755
OF FACILITIES THAT ARE OWNED BY 
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.           
WE COLLECTED DATA USING A       

00:14:34.757 --> 00:14:37.524
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.           
WE COLLECTED DATA USING A       
DIGITAL APPLICATION WHICH I'LL  

00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:38.626
WE COLLECTED DATA USING A       
DIGITAL APPLICATION WHICH I'LL  
SHOW YOU HERE IN A MINUTE.      

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:41.628
DIGITAL APPLICATION WHICH I'LL  
SHOW YOU HERE IN A MINUTE.      
WE IDENTIFIED BARRIERS.         

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.563
SHOW YOU HERE IN A MINUTE.      
WE IDENTIFIED BARRIERS.         
THESE BARRIERS ARE IDENTIFIED   

00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:46.066
WE IDENTIFIED BARRIERS.         
THESE BARRIERS ARE IDENTIFIED   
WITHIN OUR GIALLO SO YOU CAN    

00:14:46.068 --> 00:14:49.337
THESE BARRIERS ARE IDENTIFIED   
WITHIN OUR GIALLO SO YOU CAN    
FIND THEM ON A MAP AND THERE    

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:50.137
WITHIN OUR GIALLO SO YOU CAN    
FIND THEM ON A MAP AND THERE    
ARE PHOTOS FOR EACH             

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:50.937
FIND THEM ON A MAP AND THERE    
ARE PHOTOS FOR EACH             
NON-COMPLIANT BARRIER THAT WE   

00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:54.274
ARE PHOTOS FOR EACH             
NON-COMPLIANT BARRIER THAT WE   
FOUND.                          

00:14:54.276 --> 00:15:01.315
NON-COMPLIANT BARRIER THAT WE   
FOUND.                          
SO HERE IS A QUICK SHOWING      

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:17.632
OF THE APPLICATION THAT WE USED 
AND THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE FROM  
ANOTHER PROJECT.                

00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:18.532
AND THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE FROM  
ANOTHER PROJECT.                
BUT WE WOULD GO OUT AND AS SOON 

00:15:18.534 --> 00:15:19.266
ANOTHER PROJECT.                
BUT WE WOULD GO OUT AND AS SOON 
AS WE FOUND A BARRIER WE WOULD  

00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:20.000
BUT WE WOULD GO OUT AND AS SOON 
AS WE FOUND A BARRIER WE WOULD  
TAKE AN IMAGE AND IT WOULD TELL 

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:20.735
AS WE FOUND A BARRIER WE WOULD  
TAKE AN IMAGE AND IT WOULD TELL 
US WHERE IT WAS IN THE LOBBY.   

00:15:20.737 --> 00:15:21.602
TAKE AN IMAGE AND IT WOULD TELL 
US WHERE IT WAS IN THE LOBBY.   
THE MAIN LOBBY WE WOULD GEO     

00:15:21.604 --> 00:15:22.402
US WHERE IT WAS IN THE LOBBY.   
THE MAIN LOBBY WE WOULD GEO     
LOCATE IT SO IT WOULD TELL US   

00:15:22.404 --> 00:15:23.170
THE MAIN LOBBY WE WOULD GEO     
LOCATE IT SO IT WOULD TELL US   
WHERE THIS BARRIER IS FOUND.    

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.037
LOCATE IT SO IT WOULD TELL US   
WHERE THIS BARRIER IS FOUND.    
THEN WE DO A PULL DOWN MENU AND 

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:24.772
WHERE THIS BARRIER IS FOUND.    
THEN WE DO A PULL DOWN MENU AND 
WE WOULD LOOK FOR THE ELEMENT   

00:15:24.774 --> 00:15:25.239
THEN WE DO A PULL DOWN MENU AND 
WE WOULD LOOK FOR THE ELEMENT   
IN THIS CASE DOORS.             

00:15:25.241 --> 00:15:27.674
WE WOULD LOOK FOR THE ELEMENT   
IN THIS CASE DOORS.             
THEN WE FIND THE NEXT ELEMENT   

00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:30.844
IN THIS CASE DOORS.             
THEN WE FIND THE NEXT ELEMENT   
IN THIS CASE IT'S HARDWARE AND  

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:34.949
THEN WE FIND THE NEXT ELEMENT   
IN THIS CASE IT'S HARDWARE AND  
SINCE IT'S A DOOR KNOB IT IS    

00:15:34.951 --> 00:15:35.516
IN THIS CASE IT'S HARDWARE AND  
SINCE IT'S A DOOR KNOB IT IS    
NOT COMPLIANT.                  

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:39.120
SINCE IT'S A DOOR KNOB IT IS    
NOT COMPLIANT.                  
WE WOULD THEN AUTO POPULATE     

00:15:39.122 --> 00:15:43.457
NOT COMPLIANT.                  
WE WOULD THEN AUTO POPULATE     
WHAT THE THE FINDING IS AND     

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:44.391
WE WOULD THEN AUTO POPULATE     
WHAT THE THE FINDING IS AND     
THEN WE WOULD PUT IT IN A       

00:15:44.393 --> 00:15:47.328
WHAT THE THE FINDING IS AND     
THEN WE WOULD PUT IT IN A       
COMMENTARY LIKE IT'S ONE IT
