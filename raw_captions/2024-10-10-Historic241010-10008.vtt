WHEN THEY USE WHEN THEY ADDED   
THE KITCHEN ON THE BACK THERE   

01:17:59.495 --> 01:18:00.227
WHEN THEY USE WHEN THEY ADDED   
THE KITCHEN ON THE BACK THERE

02:12:15.848 --> 02:12:19.149
BACKYARD.                       
SO IT'S THAT'S KIND OF CREATING

SO IT'S THAT'S KIND OF CREATING 
AN UNCOMMON SITUATION WHERE THE 
GARAGE IS LIKE RIGHT UP THERE.  

02:12:21.954 --> 02:12:25.756

02:12:25.758 --> 02:12:26.923
GARAGE IS LIKE RIGHT UP THERE.  
>> SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?  
ONE OF THE TRADEOFFS THERE IS   

02:12:26.925 --> 02:12:30.460
>> SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?  
ONE OF THE TRADEOFFS THERE IS   
GETTING LIGHT AND AIR AND GREEN 

02:12:30.462 --> 02:12:33.664
ONE OF THE TRADEOFFS THERE IS   
GETTING LIGHT AND AIR AND GREEN 
SPACE TO BOTH OF THOSE UNITS SO 

02:12:33.666 --> 02:12:34.598
GETTING LIGHT AND AIR AND GREEN 
SPACE TO BOTH OF THOSE UNITS SO 
AND THE OTHER TRADEOFF IS CAN   

02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:37.434
SPACE TO BOTH OF THOSE UNITS SO 
AND THE OTHER TRADEOFF IS CAN   
YOU PARK A CAR IN FRONT OF THE  

02:12:37.436 --> 02:12:38.102
AND THE OTHER TRADEOFF IS CAN   
YOU PARK A CAR IN FRONT OF THE  
GARAGE WITHOUT CROSSING OVER    

02:12:38.104 --> 02:12:41.104
YOU PARK A CAR IN FRONT OF THE

THE SIDEWALK?                   

02:12:41.106 --> 02:12:42.038
GARAGE WITHOUT CROSSING OVER    
THE SIDEWALK?                   
SO I THE GARAGES ARE            

02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:45.442
THE SIDEWALK?                   
SO I THE GARAGES ARE            
SPECIFICALLY ARRANGED SO THAT   

02:12:45.444 --> 02:12:46.476
SO I THE GARAGES ARE            
SPECIFICALLY ARRANGED SO THAT   
YOU CAN GET ONE CAR SO IT'S ON  

02:12:46.478 --> 02:12:49.279
SPECIFICALLY ARRANGED SO THAT   
YOU CAN GET ONE CAR SO IT'S ON  
THE PROPERTY THERE WITHOUT      

02:12:49.281 --> 02:12:52.749
YOU CAN GET ONE CAR SO IT'S ON  
THE PROPERTY THERE WITHOUT      
BEING ON THE SIDEWALK AND STILL 

02:12:52.751 --> 02:12:53.884
THE PROPERTY THERE WITHOUT      
BEING ON THE SIDEWALK AND STILL 
NOT OBSCURING A LOT OF THE REAR 

02:12:53.886 --> 02:12:54.218
BEING ON THE SIDEWALK AND STILL 
NOT OBSCURING A LOT OF THE REAR 
LOT AREA.                       

02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:57.487
NOT OBSCURING A LOT OF THE REAR 
LOT AREA.                       
SO THAT'S KIND WHY THE GARAGES  

02:12:57.489 --> 02:12:58.255
LOT AREA.                       
SO THAT'S KIND WHY THE GARAGES  
ARRIVED AT THAT LOCATION THERE  

02:12:58.257 --> 02:13:01.192
SO THAT'S KIND WHY THE GARAGES  
ARRIVED AT THAT LOCATION THERE  
AND THEY ALSO THE GARAGE        

02:13:01.194 --> 02:13:02.192
ARRIVED AT THAT LOCATION THERE  
AND THEY ALSO THE GARAGE        
BETWEEN UNIT AND B THEN DOES    

02:13:02.194 --> 02:13:05.862
AND THEY ALSO THE GARAGE        
BETWEEN UNIT AND B THEN DOES    
NOT BLOCK THE WINDOWS THEN IN   

02:13:05.864 --> 02:13:09.733
BETWEEN UNIT AND B THEN DOES    
NOT BLOCK THE WINDOWS THEN IN   
UNITS AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE 

02:13:09.735 --> 02:13:10.501
NOT BLOCK THE WINDOWS THEN IN   
UNITS AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE 
TRADEOFF WE WE MADE NOW IN      

02:13:10.503 --> 02:13:12.802
UNITS AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE 
TRADEOFF WE WE MADE NOW IN      
TERMS THE OTHER QUESTION THAT   

02:13:12.804 --> 02:13:13.637
TRADEOFF WE WE MADE NOW IN      
TERMS THE OTHER QUESTION THAT   
WAS ASKED IS WHY ARE THE        

02:13:13.639 --> 02:13:19.076
TERMS THE OTHER QUESTION THAT   
WAS ASKED IS WHY ARE THE        
DEPARTURES SMALLER?             

02:13:19.078 --> 02:13:20.076
WAS ASKED IS WHY ARE THE        
DEPARTURES SMALLER?             
I THINK THE STAFF REPORT        

02:13:20.078 --> 02:13:20.744
DEPARTURES SMALLER?             
I THINK THE STAFF REPORT        
BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT THAT    

02:13:20.746 --> 02:13:21.412
I THINK THE STAFF REPORT        
BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT THAT    
THIS HAS BEEN A COMMERCIAL      

02:13:21.414 --> 02:13:23.580
BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT THAT    
THIS HAS BEEN A COMMERCIAL      
CORRIDOR SINCE AT LEAST         

02:13:23.582 --> 02:13:27.150
THIS HAS BEEN A COMMERCIAL      
CORRIDOR SINCE AT LEAST         
EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE MAYBE SO   

02:13:27.152 --> 02:13:28.118
CORRIDOR SINCE AT LEAST         
EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE MAYBE SO   
IT'S HAD A BIG HISTORY OF BEING 

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:31.121
EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE MAYBE SO   
IT'S HAD A BIG HISTORY OF BEING 
A KIND OF AN URBAN CORNER.      

02:13:31.123 --> 02:13:32.189
IT'S HAD A BIG HISTORY OF BEING 
A KIND OF AN URBAN CORNER.      
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT       

02:13:32.191 --> 02:13:32.857

PICTURE OF THE OLD ALMOND       
CLEANER'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 

02:13:35.427 --> 02:13:36.260
PICTURE OF THE OLD ALMOND       
CLEANER'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
I THINK IT WAS IT'S CLEAR THAT  

02:13:36.262 --> 02:13:36.993
CLEANER'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
I THINK IT WAS IT'S CLEAR THAT  
WAS REALLY INTERESTING KIND     

02:13:36.995 --> 02:13:39.497
I THINK IT WAS IT'S CLEAR THAT

OF MODERNE BUILDING CLAD IN     
LOOKS LIKE PORCELAIN GLASS AND  

02:13:43.101 --> 02:13:44.167

LOOKS LIKE PORCELAIN GLASS AND  
SO IT'S HAD THAT KIND OF THAT   

02:13:44.169 --> 02:13:47.671
LOOKS LIKE PORCELAIN GLASS AND  
SO IT'S HAD THAT KIND OF THAT   
SIDE HAS HAD THAT CHARACTER FOR 

02:13:47.673 --> 02:13:48.405
SO IT'S HAD THAT KIND OF THAT   
SIDE HAS HAD THAT CHARACTER FOR 
MANY YEARS AND OF COURSE THAT   

02:13:48.407 --> 02:13:50.474
SIDE HAS HAD THAT CHARACTER FOR 
MANY YEARS AND OF COURSE THAT   
CORNER HAS BEEN VERY COMMERCIAL 

02:13:50.476 --> 02:13:51.075
MANY YEARS AND OF COURSE THAT
