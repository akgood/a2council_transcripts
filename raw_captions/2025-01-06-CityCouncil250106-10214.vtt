GOING TOWARDS INVESTIGATING     
THOSE QUESTIONS.                
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S      

00:12:34.273 --> 00:12:37.107
THOSE QUESTIONS.                
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S      
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION THAT     

00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:37.942
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S      
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION THAT     
MAYBE THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED  

00:12:37.944 --> 00:12:40.945
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION THAT

PARTICULARLY MADE WE LIMITED    
THAT PRETTY LOW BUT THEN ALSO   

01:51:34.742 --> 01:51:37.408
PARTICULARLY MADE WE LIMITED    
THAT PRETTY LOW BUT THEN ALSO   
MADE IT REFUNDABLE WAS BECAUSE  

01:51:37.410 --> 01:51:38.410
THAT PRETTY LOW BUT THEN ALSO   
MADE IT REFUNDABLE WAS BECAUSE  
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK  

01:51:38.412 --> 01:51:41.679
MADE IT REFUNDABLE WAS BECAUSE  
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK  
WAS ALSO HAPPENING AND THAT WE  

01:51:41.681 --> 01:51:42.381
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK  
WAS ALSO HAPPENING AND THAT WE  
SAW HAPPENING WAS LANDLORDS     

01:51:42.383 --> 01:51:45.117
WAS ALSO HAPPENING AND THAT WE  
SAW HAPPENING WAS LANDLORDS     
TAKING AN ABUNDANCE             

01:51:45.119 --> 01:51:45.851
SAW HAPPENING WAS LANDLORDS     
TAKING AN ABUNDANCE             
OF APPLICATIONS KNOWING THAT    

01:51:45.853 --> 01:51:49.254
TAKING AN ABUNDANCE             
OF APPLICATIONS KNOWING THAT    
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE QUITE 

01:51:49.256 --> 01:51:50.054
OF APPLICATIONS KNOWING THAT    
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE QUITE 
THAT SAME QUANTITY OF OF        

01:51:50.056 --> 01:51:53.225
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE QUITE 
THAT SAME QUANTITY OF OF        
APARTMENTS.                     

01:51:53.227 --> 01:51:54.226
THAT SAME QUANTITY OF OF        
APARTMENTS.

01:51:54.228 --> 01:51:56.294
APARTMENTS.                     
AND SO THIS IS AN EFFORT TO     
ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT         

01:51:56.296 --> 01:51:57.095
AND SO THIS IS AN EFFORT TO     
ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT
