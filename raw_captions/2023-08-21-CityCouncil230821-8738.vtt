ONE WAS THAT A ONE POINT        
INCREASE IN THE HOME ENERGY     

02:16:40.741 --> 02:16:44.008
ONE WAS THAT A ONE POINT        
INCREASE IN THE HOME ENERGY     
SCORE IN THESE LOCATIONS WAS    

02:16:44.010 --> 02:16:44.843
INCREASE IN THE HOME ENERGY     
SCORE IN THESE LOCATIONS WAS    
ASSOCIATED WITH A POINT FIVE

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE SALES   
PRICE.                          
SO THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S GOOD FOR THE   

02:16:49.183 --> 02:16:52.117
PRICE.

SELLER.                         

02:16:52.119 --> 02:16:53.118
SO THAT&apos;S THAT&apos;S GOOD FOR THE   
SELLER.                         
BUT THEY ALSO FOUND THAT AN     

02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:56.387
SELLER.                         
BUT THEY ALSO FOUND THAT AN

THE HOME ENERGY SKORTON NOT     

02:18:03.424 --> 02:18:06.124
IN FACT WHY WE&apos;VE CLEANED UP    
THE HOME ENERGY SKORTON NOT     
ENERGY BILLS BECAUSE PEOPLE USE 

02:18:06.126 --> 02:18:06.724
THE HOME ENERGY SKORTON NOT     
ENERGY BILLS BECAUSE PEOPLE USE 
ENERGY VERY DIFFERENTLY         

02:18:06.726 --> 02:18:10.195
ENERGY BILLS BECAUSE PEOPLE USE 
ENERGY VERY DIFFERENTLY         
DEPENDING ON IF THERE ARE OLDER 

02:18:10.197 --> 02:18:10.863
ENERGY VERY DIFFERENTLY         
DEPENDING ON IF THERE ARE OLDER 
ADULTS THEY&apos;VE GOT KIDS IN THE

HOUSEHOLD AND SO USING ENERGY   
BY ITSELF IS NOT REALLY AN      
INDICATION OF THE EFFICIENCY    

02:18:15.168 --> 02:18:15.567
BY ITSELF IS NOT REALLY AN

OPEN A LOT OF HOME BUYERS RIGHT 
NOW ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO      
HISTORICAL ENERGY USE DATA FROM 

02:18:36.823 --> 02:18:37.589
NOW ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO      
HISTORICAL ENERGY USE DATA FROM 
FROM THE UTILITY AND THAT       

02:18:37.591 --> 02:18:40.992
HISTORICAL ENERGY USE DATA FROM 
FROM THE UTILITY AND THAT       
DOESN&apos;T TELL THE FULL PICTURE
