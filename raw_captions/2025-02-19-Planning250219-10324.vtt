OF THE THINGS THAT STRIKES ME   
IN THE MATERIALS IS THE OTHER   
LIST OF BANNED MATERIALS        

00:53:46.327 --> 00:53:47.026
IN THE MATERIALS IS THE OTHER   
LIST OF BANNED MATERIALS        
INCLUDING VINYL SIDING AND      

00:53:47.028 --> 00:53:47.826
LIST OF BANNED MATERIALS        
INCLUDING VINYL SIDING AND      
THERE WAS AN ACTIVE DEBATE WITH

INCLUDING VINYL SIDING AND      
THERE WAS AN ACTIVE DEBATE WITH 
OUR ARCHITECTS THAT ARE         

00:53:50.631 --> 00:53:51.429
THERE WAS AN ACTIVE DEBATE WITH 
OUR ARCHITECTS THAT ARE

SUSTAINABILITY MINDED ABOUT THE 
LIFECYCLE LIKE THIS DENHA LIKE  
VINYL SIDING HOW SUSTAINABLE IT 

00:53:54.768 --> 00:53:58.136
LIFECYCLE LIKE THIS DENHA LIKE  
VINYL SIDING HOW SUSTAINABLE IT 
IS IS HOTLY CONTESTED BECAUSE   

00:53:58.138 --> 00:54:02.341
VINYL SIDING HOW SUSTAINABLE IT 
IS IS HOTLY CONTESTED BECAUSE   
IT IS VERY DURABLE AND SO OVER

00:54:06.847 --> 00:54:09.448
THAT'S ONE OF THE BAND          
MATERIALS RIGHT NOW AND SO THAT 
MAY BE THE ARGUMENT FOR         

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:12.717

THE WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS OR   
AGAIN IN THE DESIGN REVIEW      
BOARD MEETING THE IDEA THAT AH

AGAIN IN THE DESIGN REVIEW      
BOARD MEETING THE IDEA THAT AH  
,WE HAVE NOT MADE TONS          

00:54:37.845 --> 00:54:41.313
BOARD MEETING THE IDEA THAT AH  
,WE HAVE NOT MADE TONS

TO THE DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES 

00:54:44.651 --> 00:54:45.317
OF CHANGES TO THE STANDARDS OR  
TO THE DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES 
THEY'RE NOT STANDARDS BECAUSE   

00:54:45.319 --> 00:54:46.184
TO THE DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES 
THEY'RE NOT STANDARDS BECAUSE   
THEY ARE VOLUNTARY ONLY BUT THE 

00:54:46.186 --> 00:54:49.221
THEY'RE NOT STANDARDS BECAUSE   
THEY ARE VOLUNTARY ONLY BUT THE 
GUIDELINES AND IT FEELS LIKE    

00:54:49.223 --> 00:54:52.691
THEY ARE VOLUNTARY ONLY BUT THE 
GUIDELINES AND IT FEELS LIKE    
THERE IS SOME EXPERTIZE ABOUT   

00:54:52.693 --> 00:54:53.692
GUIDELINES AND IT FEELS LIKE    
THERE IS SOME EXPERTIZE ABOUT   
LIKE CHANGES THAT COULD BE MADE 

00:54:53.694 --> 00:54:57.396
THERE IS SOME EXPERTIZE ABOUT   
LIKE CHANGES THAT COULD BE MADE 
AND SO THAT WOULD BE A SHAME TO 

00:54:57.398 --> 00:55:00.332
LIKE CHANGES THAT COULD BE MADE 
AND SO THAT WOULD BE A SHAME TO 
LOSE ABOUT LIKE WHAT IN THE     

00:55:00.334 --> 00:55:00.999
AND SO THAT WOULD BE A SHAME TO 
LOSE ABOUT LIKE WHAT IN THE     
GUIDELINES WERE NOT WORKING     

00:55:01.001 --> 00:55:03.936
LOSE ABOUT LIKE WHAT IN THE     
GUIDELINES WERE NOT WORKING     
THAT COULD BE PULLED ON.        

00:55:03.938 --> 00:55:07.906
GUIDELINES WERE NOT WORKING     
THAT COULD BE PULLED ON.        
SO THOSE ARE I THINK THAT THAT  

00:55:07.908 --> 00:55:08.574
THAT COULD BE PULLED ON.        
SO THOSE ARE I THINK THAT THAT  
PARTICULARLY IF THE DESIGN      

00:55:08.576 --> 00:55:11.777
SO THOSE ARE I THINK THAT THAT  
PARTICULARLY IF THE DESIGN      
GUIDELINES ARE TO LIVE ON AND   

00:55:11.779 --> 00:55:12.710
PARTICULARLY IF THE DESIGN      
GUIDELINES ARE TO LIVE ON AND   
WE TALKED ABOUT THE BENEFIT     

00:55:12.712 --> 00:55:15.714
GUIDELINES ARE TO LIVE ON AND   
WE TALKED ABOUT THE BENEFIT     
OF HAVING THEM LIVE ON MAYBE    

00:55:15.716 --> 00:55:16.715
WE TALKED ABOUT THE BENEFIT     
OF HAVING THEM LIVE ON MAYBE    
NOT IN THEIR CURRENT FORMAT BUT 

00:55:16.717 --> 00:55:19.350
OF HAVING THEM LIVE ON MAYBE    
NOT IN THEIR CURRENT FORMAT BUT 
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT  

00:55:19.352 --> 00:55:23.021
NOT IN THEIR CURRENT FORMAT BUT 
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT  
WOULD BE USEFUL TO GET THAT

THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT  
WOULD BE USEFUL TO GET THAT     
EXPERTIZE.                      

00:55:23.357 --> 00:55:26.992

DIFFICULT.

THINGS IN ONE MOTION FEELS      
DIFFICULT.

THE ROLE AND THE EXISTENCE      
OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD IS   

00:55:47.614 --> 00:55:49.614
THE ROLE AND THE EXISTENCE

I HAVE HEARD THAT ANN ARBOR IS  
A FRUSTRATING PLACE TO DEVELOP  
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY HOOPS 

01:11:51.845 --> 01:11:52.510
A FRUSTRATING PLACE TO DEVELOP  
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY HOOPS

01:11:52.512 --> 01:11:55.813

                .               
AND SO THE IDEA OF HAVING SOME  
KIND OF MOMENT TO STOP AT LEAST 

01:28:38.383 --> 01:28:39.115
AND SO THE IDEA OF HAVING SOME  
KIND OF MOMENT TO STOP AT LEAST 
ASK A DEVELOPER COULDN'T YOU DO 

01:28:39.117 --> 01:28:39.783
KIND OF MOMENT TO STOP AT LEAST 
ASK A DEVELOPER COULDN'T YOU DO 
IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER?         

01:28:39.785 --> 01:28:40.450
ASK A DEVELOPER COULDN'T YOU DO 
IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER?         
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING   

01:28:40.452 --> 01:28:41.251
IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER?         
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING   
THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIVE WITH   

01:28:41.253 --> 01:28:41.918
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING   
THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIVE WITH   
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME LONG     

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.452
THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIVE WITH   
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME LONG     
AFTER YOU'RE GONE.              

01:28:42.454 --> 01:28:43.186
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME LONG     
AFTER YOU'RE GONE.

AFTER YOU'RE GONE.              
IT'S STRIKING ME IS LIKE THIS   
IS FOR A FAIRLY SMALL RETURN IN 

01:28:44.056 --> 01:28:44.654
IT'S STRIKING ME IS LIKE THIS   
IS FOR A FAIRLY SMALL RETURN IN 
THE COST RECOGNIZING NICKELS    

01:28:44.656 --> 01:28:45.522
IS FOR A FAIRLY SMALL RETURN IN 
THE COST RECOGNIZING NICKELS    
AND DIMES ADD UP IT SEEMS LIKE  

01:28:45.524 --> 01:28:46.189
THE COST RECOGNIZING NICKELS    
AND DIMES ADD UP IT SEEMS LIKE  
LIKE A RADICAL THING TO DO.     

01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:46.790
AND DIMES ADD UP IT SEEMS LIKE  
LIKE A RADICAL THING TO DO.     
IT'S KIND OF THROWING OUT THE

THROUGH THE DESIGN REVIEW

ALL OF THAT, I THINK THE REASON 
THAT WE ARE HAVING SOME LEVEL

THAT WE ARE HAVING SOME LEVEL   
OF CONSTERNATION IS BECAUSE     

01:29:32.471 --> 01:29:34.804
THAT WE ARE HAVING SOME LEVEL   
OF CONSTERNATION IS BECAUSE     
IT'S NOT AN EASY DECISION ONE   

01:29:34.806 --> 01:29:35.405
OF CONSTERNATION IS BECAUSE     
IT'S NOT AN EASY DECISION ONE   
WAY OR THE OTHER.

SURE THAT IT'S NOT MANDATORY    
CURRENTLY RIGHT.                
>> SHINOHARA DID NOT HAVE TO    

01:29:43.615 --> 01:29:46.282
CURRENTLY RIGHT.                
>> SHINOHARA DID NOT HAVE TO    
CHANGE THAT DESIGN AND RON

DIDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE THAT      
DESIGN.                         
BUT I THINK THEY DID BECAUSE    

01:29:48.086 --> 01:29:48.818
DESIGN.                         
BUT I THINK THEY DID BECAUSE    
THEY WERE LIKE, YOU KNOW,       

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:49.952
BUT I THINK THEY DID BECAUSE    
THEY WERE LIKE, YOU KNOW,       
ACTUALLY FOR LONGEVITY IT
