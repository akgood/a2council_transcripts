WE BEGAN PUBLICIZING OUR DATA.  
WE BEGAN THAT IN TWENTY         
EIGHTEEN AND REALLY TRIED TO BE

PUBLIC WE SERVE.                
IN FACT WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN

GIVE THE CONFIDENCE WITHIN OUR  
AGENCY A BIG CHANGE THAT REALLY 

00:07:38.628 --> 00:07:39.560
GIVE THE CONFIDENCE WITHIN OUR  
AGENCY A BIG CHANGE THAT REALLY 
KIND OF SOLIDIFIED THIS IS THAT 

00:07:39.562 --> 00:07:43.097
AGENCY A BIG CHANGE THAT REALLY 
KIND OF SOLIDIFIED THIS IS THAT 
WE STARTED COLLECTING MANDATED  

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:46.835
KIND OF SOLIDIFIED THIS IS THAT 
WE STARTED COLLECTING MANDATED  
DATA ON THE RACE DRIVERS IN A   

00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:47.501
WE STARTED COLLECTING MANDATED  
DATA ON THE RACE DRIVERS IN A   
TRAFFIC CRASH INSTEAD.

DATA ON THE RACE DRIVERS IN A   
TRAFFIC CRASH INSTEAD.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND LET ME GIVE YOU A SOME   

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:51.038
TRAFFIC CRASH INSTEAD.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND LET ME GIVE YOU A SOME   
POINTS AS TO WHY THIS IS SO     

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.674
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND LET ME GIVE YOU A SOME   
POINTS AS TO WHY THIS IS SO     
IMPORTANT.                      

00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:54.742
POINTS AS TO WHY THIS IS SO     
IMPORTANT.                      
IT WOULD BE ALL TOO EASY TO     

00:07:54.744 --> 00:07:58.179
IMPORTANT.                      
IT WOULD BE ALL TOO EASY TO     
TAKE THE TRAFFIC THAT BAD OF A  

00:07:58.181 --> 00:07:58.946
IT WOULD BE ALL TOO EASY TO     
TAKE THE TRAFFIC THAT BAD OF A  
TROOPER AND COMPARE IT TO THE   

00:07:58.948 --> 00:07:59.514
TAKE THE TRAFFIC THAT BAD OF A  
TROOPER AND COMPARE IT TO THE   
GENERAL POPULATION.             

00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:02.250
TROOPER AND COMPARE IT TO THE   
GENERAL POPULATION.             
BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO THE        

00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:03.118
GENERAL POPULATION.             
BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO THE        
RESEARCHERS THAT IS NOT A GOOD  

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.086
BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO THE        
RESEARCHERS THAT IS NOT A GOOD  
BENCHMARK AND SO WE LOOKED AT   

00:08:05.088 --> 00:08:05.887
RESEARCHERS THAT IS NOT A GOOD  
BENCHMARK AND SO WE LOOKED AT   
SEVERAL BENCHMARKS TO USE AND   

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:06.787
BENCHMARK AND SO WE LOOKED AT   
SEVERAL BENCHMARKS TO USE AND   
ONE OF THEM BEING WHO ARE THE   

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:09.557
SEVERAL BENCHMARKS TO USE AND   
ONE OF THEM BEING WHO ARE THE   
LIKELY DRIVERS IN ANY GIVEN     

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:09.824
ONE OF THEM BEING WHO ARE THE   
LIKELY DRIVERS IN ANY GIVEN     
AREA?                           

00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:12.793
LIKELY DRIVERS IN ANY GIVEN     
AREA?                           
AND ONE OF THE GOOD INDICATORS  

00:08:12.795 --> 00:08:13.561
AREA?                           
AND ONE OF THE GOOD INDICATORS  
THAT RESEARCH INDICATES IS THIS 

00:08:13.563 --> 00:08:17.065
AND ONE OF THE GOOD INDICATORS  
THAT RESEARCH INDICATES IS THIS 
TRAFFIC CRASH REPORT, THE       

00:08:17.067 --> 00:08:17.899
THAT RESEARCH INDICATES IS THIS 
TRAFFIC CRASH REPORT, THE       
THEORY BEING THAT MOST PEOPLE   

00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:20.735
TRAFFIC CRASH REPORT, THE

00:35:37.305 --> 00:35:38.338
AND SO ANYTHING OVER THAT WOULD 
BE CONSIDERED PROBLEMATIC.      
AND SO IN OUR STATISTICAL

00:35:52.187 --> 00:35:53.253
HALF TIMES.                     
AND I THINK IN ANN ARBOR WE     
COULD GO FOR THE GOAL OF ALL    

00:35:53.255 --> 00:35:54.053
AND I THINK IN ANN ARBOR WE     
COULD GO FOR THE GOAL OF ALL    
DRIVERS BEING TREATED THE SAME. 

00:35:54.055 --> 00:35:57.123
COULD GO FOR THE GOAL OF ALL    
DRIVERS BEING TREATED THE SAME. 
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE SHOULD BE   

00:35:57.125 --> 00:35:57.790
DRIVERS BEING TREATED THE SAME. 
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE SHOULD BE   
AN EXPECTATION THAT             

00:35:57.792 --> 00:35:58.357
I DON&amp;apos;T THINK THERE SHOULD BE   
AN EXPECTATION THAT             
AFRICAN-AMERICAN DRIVERS SHOULD 

00:35:58.359 --> 00:35:59.091
AN EXPECTATION THAT             
AFRICAN-AMERICAN DRIVERS SHOULD 
WALK AROUND AND SAY WELL AT

AFRICAN-AMERICAN DRIVERS SHOULD 
WALK AROUND AND SAY WELL AT

00:36:00.629 --> 00:36:01.494
WALK AROUND AND SAY WELL AT

AGAINST, YOU KNOW, ONE AND A    

00:36:01.496 --> 00:36:02.028

AGAINST, YOU KNOW, ONE AND A    
HALF TIMES AS MUCH.

HALF TIMES AS MUCH.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I FIND THAT TO BE            
UNREASONABLE.

MAKE.                           
BUT WE&amp;apos;RE CERTAINLY GOING TO    
ASK FOR THAT AGAIN, WE THINK IF 

00:56:33.793 --> 00:56:34.459
BUT WE&amp;apos;RE CERTAINLY GOING TO    
ASK FOR THAT AGAIN, WE THINK IF 
YOUR POLICE CHIEF GOES THROUGH  

00:56:34.461 --> 00:56:37.629
ASK FOR THAT AGAIN, WE THINK IF 
YOUR POLICE CHIEF GOES THROUGH  
THE STEPS TO DOCUMENT THAT      

00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:38.363
YOUR POLICE CHIEF GOES THROUGH  
THE STEPS TO DOCUMENT THAT      
SOMEONE SHOULD BE DISMISSED     

00:56:38.365 --> 00:56:41.265
THE STEPS TO DOCUMENT THAT      
SOMEONE SHOULD BE DISMISSED     
THAT IF THEY DO GET THEIR JOB   

00:56:41.267 --> 00:56:41.900
SOMEONE SHOULD BE DISMISSED     
THAT IF THEY DO GET THEIR JOB   
BACK THROUGH ARBITRATION THEY   

00:56:41.902 --> 00:56:44.836
THAT IF THEY DO GET THEIR JOB   
BACK THROUGH ARBITRATION THEY   
KIND OF HAVE A LICENSE TO DO    

00:56:44.838 --> 00:56:45.537
BACK THROUGH ARBITRATION THEY   
KIND OF HAVE A LICENSE TO DO    
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO        

00:56:45.539 --> 00:56:46.138
KIND OF HAVE A LICENSE TO DO    
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO        
BECAUSE THE POLICE CHIEF WAS    

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.407
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO        
BECAUSE THE POLICE CHIEF WAS    
NOT ABLE TO PREVAIL IN THEIR    

00:56:48.409 --> 00:56:48.807
BECAUSE THE POLICE CHIEF WAS    
NOT ABLE TO PREVAIL IN THEIR    
TERMINATION.                    

00:56:48.809 --> 00:56:51.476
NOT ABLE TO PREVAIL IN THEIR    
TERMINATION.                    
WE THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE HIRED 

00:56:51.478 --> 00:56:52.343
TERMINATION.                    
WE THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE HIRED 
A COMPETENT POLICE CHIEF AND WE 

00:56:52.345 --> 00:56:55.446
WE THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE HIRED 
A COMPETENT POLICE CHIEF AND WE 
CERTAINLY HAVE IN THIS TOWN,    

00:56:55.448 --> 00:56:56.114
A COMPETENT POLICE CHIEF AND WE 
CERTAINLY HAVE IN THIS TOWN,    
THEN IF THAT POLICE CHIEF       

00:56:56.116 --> 00:56:56.914
CERTAINLY HAVE IN THIS TOWN,    
THEN IF THAT POLICE CHIEF       
DETERMINES THAT YOU SHOULD BE   

00:56:56.916 --> 00:56:59.484
THEN IF THAT POLICE CHIEF       
DETERMINES THAT YOU SHOULD BE   
FIRED, THEN YOU PROBABLY SHOULD 

00:56:59.486 --> 00:56:59.884
DETERMINES THAT YOU SHOULD BE   
FIRED, THEN YOU PROBABLY SHOULD 
BE FIRED.                       

00:56:59.886 --> 00:57:03.054
FIRED, THEN YOU PROBABLY SHOULD 
BE FIRED.                       
I AM NOT NAIVE, HOWEVER, TO HOW 

00:57:03.056 --> 00:57:03.588
BE FIRED.                       
I AM NOT NAIVE, HOWEVER, TO HOW 
THE NEGOTIATION WORK            

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:04.388
I AM NOT NAIVE, HOWEVER, TO HOW 
THE NEGOTIATION WORK            
NEGOTIATIONS WORK AND WHAT IT   

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:06.491
THE NEGOTIATION WORK            
NEGOTIATIONS WORK AND WHAT IT   
WOULD TAKE TO GET RID OF THAT.  

00:57:06.493 --> 00:57:07.759
NEGOTIATIONS WORK AND WHAT IT   
WOULD TAKE TO GET RID OF THAT.  
BUT I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD    

00:57:07.761 --> 00:57:08.426
WOULD TAKE TO GET RID OF THAT.  
BUT I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD    
STOP ASKING FOR THAT OR STOP    

00:57:08.428 --> 00:57:10.495
BUT I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD    
STOP ASKING FOR THAT OR STOP    
PUSHING FOR THAT STOP LOBBYING  

00:57:10.497 --> 00:57:10.928
STOP ASKING FOR THAT OR STOP    
PUSHING FOR THAT STOP LOBBYING  
FOR THAT.                       

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:14.499
PUSHING FOR THAT STOP LOBBYING  
FOR THAT.                       
OF COURSE THE OTHER SIDE        

00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:15.467
FOR THAT.                       
OF COURSE THE OTHER SIDE        
OF THAT COIN IS WHAT IF YOU     

00:57:15.469 --> 00:57:16.200
OF COURSE THE OTHER SIDE        
OF THAT COIN IS WHAT IF YOU     
HAVE A TOLERANCE FOR A POLICE   

00:57:16.202 --> 00:57:17.001
OF THAT COIN IS WHAT IF YOU     
HAVE A TOLERANCE FOR A POLICE   
CHIEF AND HE JUST FIRES PEOPLE  

00:57:17.003 --> 00:57:19.170
HAVE A TOLERANCE FOR A POLICE   
CHIEF AND HE JUST FIRES PEOPLE  
BECAUSE HE DOES NOT LIKE THE    

00:57:19.172 --> 00:57:19.871
CHIEF AND HE JUST FIRES PEOPLE  
BECAUSE HE DOES NOT LIKE THE    
WAY YOU RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS     

00:57:19.873 --> 00:57:23.008
BECAUSE HE DOES NOT LIKE THE    
WAY YOU RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS     
THEN THAT MEANS THE CITY        

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:23.808
WAY YOU RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS     
THEN THAT MEANS THE CITY        
COUNCIL ALWAYS HAS THE ABILITY  

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:25.643
THEN THAT MEANS THE CITY        
COUNCIL ALWAYS HAS THE ABILITY  
TO FIRE THAT POLICE CHIEF.      

00:57:25.645 --> 00:57:26.445

TO FIRE THAT POLICE CHIEF.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT SINCE THEY HAVE          

00:57:26.447 --> 00:57:27.112
TO FIRE THAT POLICE CHIEF.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT SINCE THEY HAVE          
DETERMINED THAT THE POLICE      

00:57:27.114 --> 00:57:29.680
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BUT SINCE THEY HAVE

BUT WE I DON&amp;apos;T THINK WE HAD A A 

01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:47.044

BUT WE I DON&amp;apos;T THINK WE HAD A A 
DEFINITE ABOUT TALKING ABOUT

01:05:56.723 --> 01:05:58.722
GREW UP IN THIS COMMUNITY TO BE

01:05:58.724 --> 01:05:59.391
A POLICE OFFICER.               
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S DEFINITELY A     
DISCUSSION WE SHOULD HAVE IN    

01:05:59.393 --> 01:05:59.924
I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S DEFINITELY A     
DISCUSSION WE SHOULD HAVE IN    
THE FUTURE.                     

01:05:59.926 --> 01:06:02.426
DISCUSSION WE SHOULD HAVE IN    
THE FUTURE.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY GAVE US  

01:06:02.428 --> 01:06:03.094
THE FUTURE.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY GAVE US  
SOME SPECIFIC REASONS ABOUT WHY 

01:06:03.096 --> 01:06:03.962
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY GAVE US  
SOME SPECIFIC REASONS ABOUT WHY 
THEY DID NOT WANT TO BECOME THE 

01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:06.564
SOME SPECIFIC REASONS ABOUT WHY 
THEY DID NOT WANT TO BECOME THE 
POLICE AND SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S      

01:06:06.566 --> 01:06:07.298
THEY DID NOT WANT TO BECOME THE 
POLICE AND SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S      
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HEAR THAT   

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:07.899
POLICE AND SO I THINK IT&amp;apos;S      
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HEAR THAT   
TOO BECAUSE IT HELPS TO         

01:06:07.901 --> 01:06:10.068
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HEAR THAT   
TOO BECAUSE IT HELPS TO         
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES WITH  

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:11.068

UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES WITH  
HOW THAT MIGHT BE OVERCOME IN   

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:11.469
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES WITH  
HOW THAT MIGHT BE OVERCOME IN   
THE FUTURE.                     

01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:12.870
HOW THAT MIGHT BE OVERCOME IN   
THE FUTURE.                     
SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO   

01:06:12.872 --> 01:06:14.005
THE FUTURE.                     
SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO   
HEAR THAT AS WELL AS WE THINK   

01:06:14.007 --> 01:06:14.806
SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO   
HEAR THAT AS WELL AS WE THINK   
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT THAT      

01:06:14.808 --> 01:06:17.641
HEAR THAT AS WELL AS WE THINK   
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT THAT      
MEANS FOR POLICING IN THE       

01:06:17.643 --> 01:06:17.942
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT THAT

FUTURE.                         

01:06:17.944 --> 01:06:21.312
MEANS FOR POLICING IN THE       
FUTURE.
