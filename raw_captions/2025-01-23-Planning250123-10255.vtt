ONE OF THE WAYS FRANKLY WE      

00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:21.167
OF DIFFERENT THINGS.            
ONE OF THE WAYS FRANKLY WE      
TRIED TO SCALE THAT FOR PEOPLE  

00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:22.035
ONE OF THE WAYS FRANKLY WE      
TRIED TO SCALE THAT FOR PEOPLE  
IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS IS TO    

00:24:22.037 --> 00:24:22.736
TRIED TO SCALE THAT FOR PEOPLE  
IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS IS TO    
START TALKING ABOUT A NUMBER    

00:24:22.738 --> 00:24:25.539
IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS IS TO    
START TALKING ABOUT A NUMBER    
OF UNITS IN PREVIOUSLY OUR ONE  

00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:28.976
START TALKING ABOUT A NUMBER    
OF UNITS IN PREVIOUSLY OUR ONE  
OUR TWO NEIGHBORHOODS.          

00:24:28.978 --> 00:24:32.179
OF UNITS IN PREVIOUSLY OUR ONE  
OUR TWO NEIGHBORHOODS.          
SINCE THAT TIME WE'LL GET TO    

00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:32.946
OUR TWO NEIGHBORHOODS.          
SINCE THAT TIME WE'LL GET TO    
THERE'S BEEN QUESTIONS RAISED   

00:24:32.948 --> 00:24:33.614
SINCE THAT TIME WE'LL GET TO    
THERE'S BEEN QUESTIONS RAISED   
ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S RIGHT,     

00:24:33.616 --> 00:24:36.283
THERE'S BEEN QUESTIONS RAISED   
ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S RIGHT,     
WHETHER THAT LIMIT IS

ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S RIGHT,     
WHETHER THAT LIMIT IS           
APPROPRIATE.                    

00:24:36.752 --> 00:24:37.617
WHETHER THAT LIMIT IS           
APPROPRIATE.                    
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:38.185
APPROPRIATE.                    
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 
WE WANT TO GET FEEDBACK.        

00:24:38.187 --> 00:24:40.754
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 
WE WANT TO GET FEEDBACK.        
THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE AS

THINKING ABOUT THAT WE KNOW WE  
HAVE TANGIBLE EXAMPLES OF WHAT  

00:34:25.173 --> 00:34:32.411
THINKING ABOUT THAT WE KNOW WE  
HAVE TANGIBLE EXAMPLES OF WHAT  
THAT LOOKS RESIDENTIAL CAN BE   

00:34:32.413 --> 00:34:33.045
HAVE TANGIBLE EXAMPLES OF WHAT  
THAT LOOKS RESIDENTIAL CAN BE   
REGULATED BY THE NUMBER         

00:34:33.047 --> 00:34:35.415
THAT LOOKS RESIDENTIAL CAN BE   
REGULATED BY THE NUMBER         
OF UNITS IT CAN BE REGULATED BY 

00:34:35.417 --> 00:34:36.182
REGULATED BY THE NUMBER         
OF UNITS IT CAN BE REGULATED BY 
FORM OR OTHER DIMENSIONAL       

00:34:36.184 --> 00:34:39.953
OF UNITS IT CAN BE REGULATED BY

00:38:06.727 --> 00:38:07.126
GOING TO PRETEND THAT THERE ARE 
WAYS THAT WE COULD TRY TO       
MINIMIZE THAT.                  

00:38:07.128 --> 00:38:13.266
WAYS THAT WE COULD TRY TO       
MINIMIZE THAT.                  
BUT GENERALLY                   

00:38:26.914 --> 00:38:29.148
              I PRESUME I AM    
MAKING THE ASSUMPTION EVEN AS A 
DESIGNER UNDERSTANDING ALL THE  

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.815
MAKING THE ASSUMPTION EVEN AS A 
DESIGNER UNDERSTANDING ALL THE  
REGULATIONS ON THE FOREIGN      

00:38:29.817 --> 00:38:30.517
DESIGNER UNDERSTANDING ALL THE  
REGULATIONS ON THE FOREIGN      
BASED CODE IS GOING TO BE MORE  

00:38:30.519 --> 00:38:31.384
REGULATIONS ON THE FOREIGN      
BASED CODE IS GOING TO BE MORE  
COMPLEX AND MORE TIME INTENSIVE 

00:38:31.386 --> 00:38:32.084
BASED CODE IS GOING TO BE MORE  
COMPLEX AND MORE TIME INTENSIVE 
THAN OH AS LONG AS I KNOW I'M   

00:38:32.086 --> 00:38:32.818
COMPLEX AND MORE TIME INTENSIVE 
THAN OH AS LONG AS I KNOW I'M   
OUT OF THIS HEIGHT AND THESE    

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.553
THAN OH AS LONG AS I KNOW I'M   
OUT OF THIS HEIGHT AND THESE    
SETBACKS I CAN GO FORWARD BUT   

00:38:33.555 --> 00:38:34.287
OUT OF THIS HEIGHT AND THESE    
SETBACKS I CAN GO FORWARD BUT   
THERE ARE WAYS TO REGULATE      

00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:34.921
SETBACKS I CAN GO FORWARD BUT   
THERE ARE WAYS TO REGULATE      
WITHOUT DOING IT BY A NUMBER    

00:38:34.923 --> 00:38:35.421
THERE ARE WAYS TO REGULATE      
WITHOUT DOING IT BY A NUMBER    
OF UNITS FOR SURE.              

00:38:35.423 --> 00:38:36.222
WITHOUT DOING IT BY A NUMBER    
OF UNITS FOR SURE.              
SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT   

00:38:36.224 --> 00:38:36.989
OF UNITS FOR SURE.              
SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT   
WE'LL GET TO IS SHOULD LOW RISE 

00:38:36.991 --> 00:38:37.790
SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT   
WE'LL GET TO IS SHOULD LOW RISE 
RESIDENTIAL REPLACE OUR ONE IN  

00:38:37.792 --> 00:38:39.425
WE'LL GET TO IS SHOULD LOW RISE 
RESIDENTIAL REPLACE OUR ONE IN  
OUR TWO DISTRICT OR DO YOU      

00:38:39.427 --> 00:38:40.126
RESIDENTIAL REPLACE OUR ONE IN  
OUR TWO DISTRICT OR DO YOU      
ENVISION SOMETHING ELSE?        

00:38:40.128 --> 00:38:42.996
OUR TWO DISTRICT OR DO YOU      
ENVISION SOMETHING ELSE?        
IF SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO TO  

00:38:42.998 --> 00:38:43.996
ENVISION SOMETHING ELSE?        
IF SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO TO  
US WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE       

00:38:43.998 --> 00:38:44.664
IF SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO TO  
US WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE       
MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING, WHAT    

00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:47.333
US WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE       
MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING, WHAT    
ARE THE PROJECTS SAMPLES THAT   

00:38:47.335 --> 00:38:48.167
MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING, WHAT    
ARE THE PROJECTS SAMPLES THAT   
DO OR DON'T FALL INTO THAT      

00:38:48.169 --> 00:38:48.868
ARE THE PROJECTS SAMPLES THAT   
DO OR DON'T FALL INTO THAT      
CATEGORY MAYBE WAY TO THINK     

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.170
DO OR DON'T FALL INTO THAT      
CATEGORY MAYBE WAY TO THINK     
ABOUT THAT.                     

00:38:51.172 --> 00:38:52.071
CATEGORY MAYBE WAY TO THINK     
ABOUT THAT.                     
I'M DRAWING A LINE I JUST       

00:38:52.073 --> 00:38:52.772
ABOUT THAT.                     
I'M DRAWING A LINE I JUST       
ARBITRARILY PUT A LINE HERE ON  

00:38:52.774 --> 00:38:55.774
I'M DRAWING A LINE I JUST       
ARBITRARILY PUT A LINE HERE ON  
THIS CATEGORY THAT I THINK IT   

00:38:55.776 --> 00:38:56.542
ARBITRARILY PUT A LINE HERE ON  
THIS CATEGORY THAT I THINK IT   
IS SORT OF OUR CONVERSATION     

00:38:56.544 --> 00:38:59.579
THIS CATEGORY THAT I THINK IT   
IS SORT OF OUR CONVERSATION     
OVER THE LAST YEAR TO           

00:38:59.581 --> 00:39:03.082
IS SORT OF OUR CONVERSATION     
OVER THE LAST YEAR TO           
OVERSIMPLIFY IS INCLUDING       

00:39:03.084 --> 00:39:03.883
OVER THE LAST YEAR TO           
OVERSIMPLIFY IS INCLUDING       
EVERYTHING LEFT OF THE LINE     

00:39:03.885 --> 00:39:04.617
OVERSIMPLIFY IS INCLUDING       
EVERYTHING LEFT OF THE LINE     
PROBABLY AND THOSE ARE ONE IN   

00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:07.487
EVERYTHING LEFT OF THE LINE     
PROBABLY AND THOSE ARE ONE IN   
OUR TWO DISTRICTS BUT I DON'T   

00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:08.288
PROBABLY AND THOSE ARE ONE IN   
OUR TWO DISTRICTS BUT I DON'T   
THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:08.755
OUR TWO DISTRICTS BUT I DON'T   
THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  
DENSITY EVERYBODY WAS           

00:39:08.757 --> 00:39:09.555
THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  
DENSITY EVERYBODY WAS           
ENVISIONING EVERYTHING TO THE   

00:39:09.557 --> 00:39:11.824
DENSITY EVERYBODY WAS           
ENVISIONING EVERYTHING TO THE   
RIGHT OF THE LINE AND SO WHAT   

00:39:11.826 --> 00:39:12.358
ENVISIONING EVERYTHING TO THE   
RIGHT OF THE LINE AND SO WHAT   
DOES THAT MEAN?                 

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.293
RIGHT OF THE LINE AND SO WHAT   
DOES THAT MEAN?                 
HOW DO WE WANT TO APPROACH IT   

00:39:13.295 --> 00:39:15.194
DOES THAT MEAN?                 
HOW DO WE WANT TO APPROACH IT   
AND WHEN DO WE WANT A MASS      

00:39:15.196 --> 00:39:18.364
HOW DO WE WANT TO APPROACH IT   
AND WHEN DO WE WANT A MASS      
SCALE STANDARD IS THAT          

00:39:18.366 --> 00:39:22.501
AND WHEN DO WE WANT A MASS      
SCALE STANDARD IS THAT          
IMPORTANT TO US AND AT ALL AND  

00:39:22.503 --> 00:39:25.871
SCALE STANDARD IS THAT          
IMPORTANT TO US AND AT ALL AND  
IF SO, DO WE DESIRE TO DO THAT  

00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:26.539
IMPORTANT TO US AND AT ALL AND  
IF SO, DO WE DESIRE TO DO THAT  
THROUGH SOMETHING OTHER THAN A  

00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:29.341
IF SO, DO WE DESIRE TO DO THAT  
THROUGH SOMETHING OTHER THAN A  
UNIT COUNT?                     

00:39:29.343 --> 00:39:30.043
THROUGH SOMETHING OTHER THAN A  
UNIT COUNT?                     
>> ALL RIGHT.                   

00:39:30.045 --> 00:39:33.145
UNIT COUNT?                     
>> ALL RIGHT.                   
GETTING TO MIXED USE AREAS BOTH 

00:39:33.147 --> 00:39:33.780
>> ALL RIGHT.                   
GETTING TO MIXED USE AREAS BOTH 
HUBS AND CORRIDORS.             

00:39:33.782 --> 00:39:37.750
GETTING TO MIXED USE AREAS BOTH 
HUBS AND CORRIDORS.             
SO THIS IN THIS CONTEXT         

00:39:37.752 --> 00:39:44.357
HUBS AND CORRIDORS.             
SO THIS IN THIS CONTEXT         
PROVIDES PROBABLY SOME OF MOST  

00:39:44.359 --> 00:39:44.958
SO THIS IN THIS CONTEXT         
PROVIDES PROBABLY SOME OF MOST  
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND MOST     

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.661
PROVIDES PROBABLY SOME OF MOST  
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND MOST     
STATUS QUO LAND USE POLICIES    

00:39:48.663 --> 00:39:49.595
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND MOST     
STATUS QUO LAND USE POLICIES    
THAT THE FUTURE LAND USE MAP    

00:39:49.597 --> 00:39:52.431
STATUS QUO LAND USE POLICIES    
THAT THE FUTURE LAND USE MAP    
CURRENTLY SHOWS.                

00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:53.699
THAT THE FUTURE LAND USE MAP    
CURRENTLY SHOWS.                
FIRST OF ALL, IT SHOWS A LOT    

00:39:53.701 --> 00:39:55.168
CURRENTLY SHOWS.                
FIRST OF ALL, IT SHOWS A LOT    
OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING MIXED     

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:55.901
FIRST OF ALL, IT SHOWS A LOT    
OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING MIXED     
TRANSIT TRANSITION ZONES.       

00:39:55.903 --> 00:39:59.705
OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING MIXED     
TRANSIT TRANSITION ZONES.       
THESE ARE A LOT OF THE YELLOW   

00:39:59.707 --> 00:40:00.373
TRANSIT TRANSITION ZONES.       
THESE ARE A LOT OF THE YELLOW   
CORRIDORS THAT YOU SEE ALONG    

00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:03.242
THESE ARE A LOT OF THE YELLOW   
CORRIDORS THAT YOU SEE ALONG    
THIS THAT REPRESENT ABOUT       

00:40:03.244 --> 00:40:04.310
CORRIDORS THAT YOU SEE ALONG    
THIS THAT REPRESENT ABOUT       
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW ACRES   

00:40:04.312 --> 00:40:07.313
THIS THAT REPRESENT ABOUT       
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW ACRES   
OF SORT OF CORE TRANSIT         

00:40:07.315 --> 00:40:07.980
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW ACRES   
OF SORT OF CORE TRANSIT         
ORIENTED SCALE DEVELOPMENT.     

00:40:07.982 --> 00:40:11.717
OF SORT OF CORE TRANSIT         
ORIENTED SCALE DEVELOPMENT.     
WE ENVISION THIS TO BE PODIA    

00:40:11.719 --> 00:40:14.286
ORIENTED SCALE DEVELOPMENT.     
WE ENVISION THIS TO BE PODIA    
STICK OVER A PODIUM READY       

00:40:14.288 --> 00:40:15.287
WE ENVISION THIS TO BE PODIA    
STICK OVER A PODIUM READY       
PROBABLY UP TO SEVENTY FIVE     

00:40:15.289 --> 00:40:18.958
STICK OVER A PODIUM READY       
PROBABLY UP TO SEVENTY FIVE     
FEET COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A   

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.994
PROBABLY UP TO SEVENTY FIVE     
FEET COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A   
CONTEXTUAL HEIGHT LIMITATION    

00:40:21.996 --> 00:40:22.995
FEET COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A   
CONTEXTUAL HEIGHT LIMITATION    
BUT PROVIDING A LOT OF NEW      

00:40:22.997 --> 00:40:26.432
CONTEXTUAL HEIGHT LIMITATION    
BUT PROVIDING A LOT OF NEW      
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES ON        

00:40:26.434 --> 00:40:27.132
BUT PROVIDING A LOT OF NEW      
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES ON        
CORRIDORS BOTH SIGNIFICANT      

00:40:27.134 --> 00:40:30.336
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES ON        
CORRIDORS BOTH SIGNIFICANT      
TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND CORRIDORS 

00:40:30.338 --> 00:40:31.070
CORRIDORS BOTH SIGNIFICANT      
TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND CORRIDORS 
THAT DON'T HAVE SUPER ROBUST    

00:40:31.072 --> 00:40:33.272
TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND CORRIDORS 
THAT DON'T HAVE SUPER ROBUST    
TRANSIT YET BUT HAVE SOME       

00:40:33.274 --> 00:40:33.873
THAT DON'T HAVE SUPER ROBUST    
TRANSIT YET BUT HAVE SOME       
TRANSIT ON THEM.

TRANSIT YET BUT HAVE SOME       
TRANSIT ON THEM.                
SO THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE A  

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.910
TRANSIT ON THEM.                
SO THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE A  
DIVERSITY OF LAND USE TYPES.    

00:40:37.912 --> 00:40:38.778
SO THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE A  
DIVERSITY OF LAND USE TYPES.    
CATEGORIES RANGING FROM CURRENT

WHEN I HAD BROUGHT THAT UP      
WHICH WAS TO ME TO THE EXTENT   
THAT'S FEASIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO

THAT'S FEASIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO 
TRY TO ELIMINATE CONFLICTS WITH 
THE MICHIGAN BUILDING           

01:36:05.202 --> 01:36:05.935
TRY TO ELIMINATE CONFLICTS WITH 
THE MICHIGAN BUILDING           
CODE RELATIVE TO ZONING CODE SO 

01:36:05.937 --> 01:36:08.404
THE MICHIGAN BUILDING           
CODE RELATIVE TO ZONING CODE SO 
THAT A DEVELOPER DOESN'T HAVE   

01:36:08.406 --> 01:36:09.272
CODE RELATIVE TO ZONING CODE SO 
THAT A DEVELOPER DOESN'T HAVE   
TO NECESSARILY LOOK AT MULTIPLE 

01:36:09.274 --> 01:36:12.274
THAT A DEVELOPER DOESN'T HAVE   
TO NECESSARILY LOOK AT MULTIPLE 
SOURCES TO SAY LIKE OH THIS IS  

01:36:12.276 --> 01:36:13.209
TO NECESSARILY LOOK AT MULTIPLE 
SOURCES TO SAY LIKE OH THIS IS  
WHAT I CAN DO UNDER MICHIGAN    

01:36:13.211 --> 01:36:13.742
SOURCES TO SAY LIKE OH THIS IS  
WHAT I CAN DO UNDER MICHIGAN    
BUILDING CODE .                 

01:36:13.744 --> 01:36:16.679
WHAT I CAN DO UNDER MICHIGAN    
BUILDING CODE .                 
BUT FOR SOME REASON IT HAS      

01:36:16.681 --> 01:36:17.380
BUILDING CODE .                 
BUT FOR SOME REASON IT HAS      
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS THAN      

01:36:17.382 --> 01:36:20.382
BUT FOR SOME REASON IT HAS      
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS THAN      
ZONING AND SO I WAS LOOKING AT  

01:36:20.384 --> 01:36:21.117
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS THAN      
ZONING AND SO I WAS LOOKING AT  
TYPE THREE CONSTRUCTION WOOD    

01:36:21.119 --> 01:36:24.020
ZONING AND SO I WAS LOOKING AT  
TYPE THREE CONSTRUCTION WOOD    
FRAME NON-STORE SPRINKLER

THE FORTY EIGHT FEET            

01:36:29.027 --> 01:36:32.127
GRADE.                          
THE FORTY EIGHT FEET            
SPECIFICALLY CAME FROM SOME     

01:36:32.129 --> 01:36:32.896
THE FORTY EIGHT FEET            
SPECIFICALLY CAME FROM SOME     
OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE WERE   

01:36:32.898 --> 01:36:33.763
SPECIFICALLY CAME FROM SOME     
OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE WERE   
GETTING I THINK IT WAS LOCKWOOD 

01:36:33.765 --> 01:36:34.463
OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE WERE   
GETTING I THINK IT WAS LOCKWOOD 
BUT I THINK THAT WAS ACTUALLY   

01:36:34.465 --> 01:36:37.066
GETTING I THINK IT WAS LOCKWOOD 
BUT I THINK THAT WAS ACTUALLY   
FORD OR THREE WHAT I WAS TRYING 

01:36:37.068 --> 01:36:40.336
BUT I THINK THAT WAS ACTUALLY   
FORD OR THREE WHAT I WAS TRYING 
TO COMBINE THE PRACTICALITY     

01:36:40.338 --> 01:36:43.973
FORD OR THREE WHAT I WAS TRYING 
TO COMBINE THE PRACTICALITY     
OF TRYING TO ELIMINATE CONFLICT 

01:36:43.975 --> 01:36:44.907
TO COMBINE THE PRACTICALITY     
OF TRYING TO ELIMINATE CONFLICT 
POINTS BETWEEN ZONING AND THE   

01:36:44.909 --> 01:36:48.577
OF TRYING TO ELIMINATE CONFLICT 
POINTS BETWEEN ZONING AND THE   
MICHIGAN BUILDING CODE AND I    

01:36:48.579 --> 01:36:49.245
POINTS BETWEEN ZONING AND THE   
MICHIGAN BUILDING CODE AND I    
THINK WE ACTUALLY ALSO WE'RE    

01:36:49.247 --> 01:36:52.081
MICHIGAN BUILDING CODE AND I    
THINK WE ACTUALLY ALSO WE'RE    
TALKING ABOUT THE RESIDENTIAL   

01:36:52.083 --> 01:36:52.982
THINK WE ACTUALLY ALSO WE'RE    
TALKING ABOUT THE RESIDENTIAL   
CODE AT ONE POINT AS WELL BUT   

01:36:52.984 --> 01:36:53.716
TALKING ABOUT THE RESIDENTIAL   
CODE AT ONE POINT AS WELL BUT   
IT HELPS TO REDUCE CONFLICTS    

01:36:53.718 --> 01:36:56.552
CODE AT ONE POINT AS WELL BUT   
IT HELPS TO REDUCE CONFLICTS    
AND TO TRY TO CREATE SOME LEVEL 

01:36:56.554 --> 01:36:59.888
IT HELPS TO REDUCE CONFLICTS    
AND TO TRY TO CREATE SOME LEVEL 
OF ELIGIBILITY AND STREAMLINE   

01:36:59.890 --> 01:37:00.689
AND TO TRY TO CREATE SOME LEVEL 
OF ELIGIBILITY AND STREAMLINE   
THINGS SO THAT AGAIN A          

01:37:00.691 --> 01:37:01.424
OF ELIGIBILITY AND STREAMLINE   
THINGS SO THAT AGAIN A          
DEVELOPER DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK  

01:37:01.426 --> 01:37:03.226
THINGS SO THAT AGAIN A          
DEVELOPER DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK  
AT MULTIPLE POINTS AND SAY THIS 

01:37:03.228 --> 01:37:06.796
DEVELOPER DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK  
AT MULTIPLE POINTS AND SAY THIS 
IS WHAT IS ACTUALLY CREATING    

01:37:06.798 --> 01:37:07.663
AT MULTIPLE POINTS AND SAY THIS 
IS WHAT IS ACTUALLY CREATING    
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BUILDABLE   

01:37:07.665 --> 01:37:11.333
IS WHAT IS ACTUALLY CREATING    
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BUILDABLE   
HEIGHT FOR ME.                  

01:37:11.335 --> 01:37:12.267
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BUILDABLE   
HEIGHT FOR ME.                  
AND SO THAT'S WHERE THAT        

01:37:12.269 --> 01:37:15.437
HEIGHT FOR ME.                  
AND SO THAT'S WHERE THAT        
COMMENT CAME FROM ALSO HAS TO   

01:37:15.439 --> 01:37:16.105
AND SO THAT'S WHERE THAT        
COMMENT CAME FROM ALSO HAS TO   
DO WITH GENERALLY A FLOOR IS    

01:37:16.107 --> 01:37:19.175
COMMENT CAME FROM ALSO HAS TO   
DO WITH GENERALLY A FLOOR IS    
ABOUT TWELVE FEET AND SO ON     

01:37:19.177 --> 01:37:19.975
DO WITH GENERALLY A FLOOR IS    
ABOUT TWELVE FEET AND SO ON     
WOOD CONSTRUCTION ON SPRINKLER  

01:37:19.977 --> 01:37:23.212
ABOUT TWELVE FEET AND SO ON     
WOOD CONSTRUCTION ON SPRINKLER  
YOU'D THINK GENERALLY YOU       

01:37:23.214 --> 01:37:24.013
WOOD CONSTRUCTION ON SPRINKLER  
YOU'D THINK GENERALLY YOU       
SQUEEZE OUT FOUR FLOORS IF YOU  

01:37:24.015 --> 01:37:26.915
YOU'D THINK GENERALLY YOU       
SQUEEZE OUT FOUR FLOORS IF YOU  
COULD NOW I THERE IS A QUESTION 

01:37:26.917 --> 01:37:27.750
SQUEEZE OUT FOUR FLOORS IF YOU  
COULD NOW I THERE IS A QUESTION 
TO BE HAD WHICH IS ONE OF THE   

01:37:27.752 --> 01:37:28.617
COULD NOW I THERE IS A QUESTION

AN APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW THE     
LAST THING WE WANT ARE UGLY     
OBTRUSIVE RIGHT LARGER          

01:37:38.329 --> 01:37:39.261
LAST THING WE WANT ARE UGLY     
OBTRUSIVE RIGHT LARGER          
COMPLETELY OUT OF SCALE AND NON 

01:37:39.263 --> 01:37:42.498
OBTRUSIVE RIGHT LARGER          
COMPLETELY OUT OF SCALE AND NON 
LEGIBLE THINGS THAT IMPACT      

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:42.865
COMPLETELY OUT OF SCALE AND NON 
LEGIBLE THINGS THAT IMPACT      
BUILDING FORM.                  

01:37:42.867 --> 01:37:43.199
LEGIBLE THINGS THAT IMPACT      
BUILDING FORM.                  
RIGHT.                          

01:37:43.201 --> 01:37:46.201
BUILDING FORM.                  
RIGHT.                          
BECAUSE EVEN IF IT'S BECAUSE    

01:37:46.203 --> 01:37:46.902
RIGHT.                          
BECAUSE EVEN IF IT'S BECAUSE    
ULTIMATELY THERE'S A CHARM TO   

01:37:46.904 --> 01:37:47.570
BECAUSE EVEN IF IT'S BECAUSE    
ULTIMATELY THERE'S A CHARM TO   
SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS, ET      

01:37:47.572 --> 01:37:50.306
ULTIMATELY THERE'S A CHARM TO   
SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS, ET      
CETERA.

SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS, ET      
CETERA.                         
THAT BEING SAID, WE DO HAVE TO  

01:37:51.542 --> 01:37:54.143
CETERA.                         
THAT BEING SAID, WE DO HAVE TO  
ADD AN ADDITIONAL DENSER        

01:37:54.145 --> 01:37:55.244
THAT BEING SAID, WE DO HAVE TO  
ADD AN ADDITIONAL DENSER        
HOUSING AND SO SO WHAT IS THE   

01:37:55.246 --> 01:37:55.744
ADD AN ADDITIONAL DENSER        
HOUSING AND SO SO WHAT IS THE   
CORRECT BALANCE?                

01:37:55.746 --> 01:37:58.481
HOUSING AND SO SO WHAT IS THE   
CORRECT BALANCE?                
I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION     

01:37:58.483 --> 01:37:59.148
CORRECT BALANCE?                
I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION     
WE'RE HERE TO DELIBERATE.       

01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:00.016
I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION     
WE'RE HERE TO DELIBERATE.       
I WANTED TO AT LEAST PROVIDE    

01:38:00.018 --> 01:38:02.317
WE'RE HERE TO DELIBERATE.       
I WANTED TO AT LEAST PROVIDE    
THAT KIND OF CLARIFICATION AS   

01:38:02.319 --> 01:38:03.086
I WANTED TO AT LEAST PROVIDE    
THAT KIND OF CLARIFICATION AS   
TO WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM  

01:38:03.088 --> 01:38:05.388
THAT KIND OF CLARIFICATION AS   
TO WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM  
AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE THE   

01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:06.055
TO WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM  
AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE THE   
ELIMINATION TO THE EXTENT       

01:38:06.057 --> 01:38:10.025
AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE THE   
ELIMINATION TO THE EXTENT       
POSSIBLE BETWEEN CONFLICTS      

01:38:10.027 --> 01:38:10.726
ELIMINATION TO THE EXTENT       
POSSIBLE BETWEEN CONFLICTS      
OF MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES     

01:38:10.728 --> 01:38:11.327
POSSIBLE BETWEEN CONFLICTS      
OF MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES     
OF CODE ZONING AND MICHIGAN     

01:38:11.329 --> 01:38:13.763
OF MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES     
OF CODE ZONING AND MICHIGAN     
BUILDING CODE AND THEN ALSO     

01:38:13.765 --> 01:38:14.564
OF CODE ZONING AND MICHIGAN     
BUILDING CODE AND THEN ALSO     
WHAT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE   

01:38:14.566 --> 01:38:17.700
BUILDING CODE AND THEN ALSO     
WHAT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE   
FROM THINKING THROUGH IF THIS   

01:38:17.702 --> 01:38:21.036
WHAT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE   
FROM THINKING THROUGH IF THIS   
DOESN'T WORK FOR TWO STORIES    

01:38:21.038 --> 01:38:22.105
FROM THINKING THROUGH IF THIS   
DOESN'T WORK FOR TWO STORIES    
BASED ON THE OVERALL COST BASIS 

01:38:22.107 --> 01:38:24.673
DOESN'T WORK FOR TWO STORIES    
BASED ON THE OVERALL COST BASIS 
OF THE LAND, WHAT MAKES IT      

01:38:24.675 --> 01:38:25.541
BASED ON THE OVERALL COST BASIS

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:37.873
THEY KNOW WHO'S GOING TO LIVE   
IN THE HOUSING AND THEY CHANGE  
THEIR MINDS DEPENDING ON IF     

01:50:37.875 --> 01:50:43.979
IN THE HOUSING AND THEY CHANGE  
THEIR MINDS DEPENDING ON IF     
THERE ARE GOING                 

01:50:57.827 --> 01:50:59.995
                TO BE RICH      
PEOPLE LIVING IN THAT HOUSING   
OR NOT RICH PEOPLE LIVING IN    

01:50:59.997 --> 01:51:00.462
PEOPLE LIVING IN THAT HOUSING   
OR NOT RICH PEOPLE LIVING IN    
THE HOUSING.                    

01:51:00.464 --> 01:51:01.263
OR NOT RICH PEOPLE LIVING IN    
THE HOUSING.                    
AND I SAT IN ON SOME REALLY     

01:51:01.265 --> 01:51:01.930
THE HOUSING.                    
AND I SAT IN ON SOME REALLY     
INTERESTING MEETINGS WHERE      

01:51:01.932 --> 01:51:02.598
AND I SAT IN ON SOME REALLY     
INTERESTING MEETINGS WHERE      
PEOPLE'S OPPOSITION TO NEW      

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:03.198
INTERESTING MEETINGS WHERE      
PEOPLE'S OPPOSITION TO NEW      
BUILDING CHANGED DRAMATICALLY   

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:03.998
PEOPLE'S OPPOSITION TO NEW      
BUILDING CHANGED DRAMATICALLY   
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THEY WERE   

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:04.666
BUILDING CHANGED DRAMATICALLY   
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THEY WERE   
GOING TO BE A MILLION DOLLAR    

01:51:04.668 --> 01:51:05.466
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THEY WERE   
GOING TO BE A MILLION DOLLAR    
CONDOS BECAUSE THAT MEANT THEIR 

01:51:05.468 --> 01:51:06.134
GOING TO BE A MILLION DOLLAR    
CONDOS BECAUSE THAT MEANT THEIR 
HOUSING WOULD GO UP THEIR       

01:51:06.136 --> 01:51:06.801
CONDOS BECAUSE THAT MEANT THEIR 
HOUSING WOULD GO UP THEIR       
SINGLE FAMILY HOME WAS NOT      

01:51:06.803 --> 01:51:07.402
HOUSING WOULD GO UP THEIR       
SINGLE FAMILY HOME WAS NOT      
GOING TO BE WORTH LESS.         

01:51:07.404 --> 01:51:08.137
SINGLE FAMILY HOME WAS NOT      
GOING TO BE WORTH LESS.         
IT WAS GOING TO BE WORTH MORE.  

01:51:08.139 --> 01:51:08.804
GOING TO BE WORTH LESS.         
IT WAS GOING TO BE WORTH MORE.  
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE       

01:51:08.806 --> 01:51:10.939
IT WAS GOING TO BE WORTH MORE.  
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE       
THINGS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT       

01:51:10.941 --> 01:51:11.873
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE       
THINGS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT       
MISSING MIDDLE IS IT'S NOT JUST 

01:51:11.875 --> 01:51:14.976
THINGS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT       
MISSING MIDDLE IS IT'S NOT JUST 
A HOUSING TYPE BECAUSE HOUSING  

01:51:14.978 --> 01:51:18.847
MISSING MIDDLE IS IT'S NOT JUST 
A HOUSING TYPE BECAUSE HOUSING  
TYPES DEPENDING ON HOW THEY'RE  

01:51:18.849 --> 01:51:19.614
A HOUSING TYPE BECAUSE HOUSING  
TYPES DEPENDING ON HOW THEY'RE  
MARKETED AND FINISHED CAN       

01:51:19.616 --> 01:51:22.951
TYPES DEPENDING ON HOW THEY'RE  
MARKETED AND FINISHED CAN       
ACTUALLY BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN 

01:51:22.953 --> 01:51:23.752
MARKETED AND FINISHED CAN       
ACTUALLY BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN 
THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT    

01:51:23.754 --> 01:51:26.822
ACTUALLY BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN 
THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT    
WERE THERE.                     

01:51:26.824 --> 01:51:28.023
THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT    
WERE THERE.                     
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY I DON'T   

01:51:28.025 --> 01:51:30.491
WERE THERE.                     
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY I DON'T   
SEE A LINE ON THE MISSING       

01:51:30.493 --> 01:51:31.392
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY I DON'T   
SEE A LINE ON THE MISSING       
MIDDLE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO  

01:51:31.394 --> 01:51:34.762
SEE A LINE ON THE MISSING       
MIDDLE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO  
VARIED AND AND I THINK MORE     

01:51:34.764 --> 01:51:38.233
MIDDLE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO  
VARIED AND AND I THINK MORE     
UNITS IS GOOD.                  

01:51:38.235 --> 01:51:39.267
VARIED AND AND I THINK MORE     
UNITS IS GOOD.                  
BUT BUT SOME OF THOSE UNITS ARE 

01:51:39.269 --> 01:51:41.970
UNITS IS GOOD.                  
BUT BUT SOME OF THOSE UNITS ARE 
GOING TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE    

01:51:41.972 --> 01:51:46.474
BUT BUT SOME OF THOSE UNITS ARE 
GOING TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE    
AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.  

01:51:46.476 --> 01:51:49.878
GOING TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE    
AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.  
COUNCILMAN REDISH, I WANT TO I  

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:52.981
AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.  
COUNCILMAN REDISH, I WANT TO I

01:51:52.983 --> 01:51:57.386
COUNCILMAN REDISH, I WANT TO I  
WANT TO GET INTO SOME OF THE I  
WANT TO GET INTO THINGS THAT    

01:51:57.388 --> 01:51:58.187

WANT TO GET INTO THINGS THAT    
I'M NOT FULLY QUALIFIED TO TALK

SOME THINGS AND THEN IF I MAKE  
MISTAKES PEOPLE CAN JUMP IN AND 

01:52:04.995 --> 01:52:08.329
SOME THINGS AND THEN IF I MAKE  
MISTAKES PEOPLE CAN JUMP IN AND 
HELP US THINK THEM THROUGH.     

01:52:08.331 --> 01:52:09.497
MISTAKES PEOPLE CAN JUMP IN AND 
HELP US THINK THEM THROUGH.     
>> BUT SO ONE THING I DID WANT  

01:52:09.499 --> 01:52:12.567
HELP US THINK THEM THROUGH.     
>> BUT SO ONE THING I DID WANT  
TO SAY IS THAT I DO THINK THAT  

01:52:12.569 --> 01:52:13.302
>> BUT SO ONE THING I DID WANT  
TO SAY IS THAT I DO THINK THAT  
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER     

01:52:13.304 --> 01:52:16.537
TO SAY IS THAT I DO THINK THAT  
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER     
THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW    

01:52:16.539 --> 01:52:19.607
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER     
THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW    
GREATER DENSITY IN IN WHAT'S    

01:52:19.609 --> 01:52:20.609
THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW    
GREATER DENSITY IN IN WHAT'S    
NOW ARE ONE AND TWO THAT THAT   

01:52:20.611 --> 01:52:23.678
GREATER DENSITY IN IN WHAT'S    
NOW ARE ONE AND TWO THAT THAT   
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN       

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.479
NOW ARE ONE AND TWO THAT THAT   
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN       
PRICES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN   

01:52:24.481 --> 01:52:27.315
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN       
PRICES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN   
BECAUSE WHERE WE ARE SEEING     

01:52:27.317 --> 01:52:28.116
PRICES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN   
BECAUSE WHERE WE ARE SEEING     
THAT HAPPEN FOR EXAMPLE ALONG   

01:52:28.118 --> 01:52:31.720
BECAUSE WHERE WE ARE SEEING     
THAT HAPPEN FOR EXAMPLE ALONG   
ASHLEIGH, THERE'S A LOT         

01:52:31.722 --> 01:52:32.454
THAT HAPPEN FOR EXAMPLE ALONG   
ASHLEIGH, THERE'S A LOT         
OF GREATER DENSITY DENSITY      

01:52:32.456 --> 01:52:33.054

BECAUSE OF WHAT'S ON THERE NOW  
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD    
HAVE TO ASSEMBLE SO MANY

BUT I I WHAT I SEE AS THE       
ADVANTAGE ALONG THE CORRIDORS

01:54:08.418 --> 01:54:11.386
ADVANTAGE ALONG THE CORRIDORS   
OF THE MIXED USE TRANSITION     
ZONING IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE    

01:54:11.388 --> 01:54:14.957
OF THE MIXED USE TRANSITION     
ZONING IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE    
LESS TALL WHEN IT BUTTS UP      

01:54:14.959 --> 01:54:18.527
ZONING IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE    
LESS TALL WHEN IT BUTTS UP      
AGAINST LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL SO 

01:54:18.529 --> 01:54:19.327
LESS TALL WHEN IT BUTTS UP      
AGAINST LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL SO 
IT'S 55 WITHIN 50 FEET.         

01:54:19.329 --> 01:54:25.567
AGAINST LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL SO 
IT'S 55 WITHIN 50 FEET.         
T7 IS 55 WITHIN 80 FEET.        

01:54:25.569 --> 01:54:26.635
IT'S 55 WITHIN 50 FEET.         
T7 IS 55 WITHIN 80 FEET.        
>> I MEAN ACTUALLY THAT IS MORE

T7 IS 55 WITHIN 80 FEET.        
>> I MEAN ACTUALLY THAT IS MORE 
PERMISSIVE AND THEN IT'S TCW TO 

01:54:29.873 --> 01:54:33.775
>> I MEAN ACTUALLY THAT IS MORE 
PERMISSIVE AND THEN IT'S TCW TO 
SEVENTY FIVE WITHIN 80 TO 300

SEVENTY FIVE WITHIN 80 TO 300   
FEET.                           
SO I MEAN ACTUALLY THE TRANSIT  

01:54:38.282 --> 01:54:38.947
FEET.                           
SO I MEAN ACTUALLY THE TRANSIT  
ACTUALLY NOW NOW I'VE CONFUSED  

01:54:38.949 --> 01:54:42.216
SO I MEAN ACTUALLY THE TRANSIT  
ACTUALLY NOW NOW I'VE CONFUSED  
MYSELF AS I'M LOOKING AT IT     

01:54:42.218 --> 01:54:42.551
ACTUALLY NOW NOW I'VE CONFUSED  
MYSELF AS I'M LOOKING AT IT     
AGAIN.

MYSELF AS I'M LOOKING AT IT     
AGAIN.                          
OK SO ACTUALLY LET ME ASK WHAT  

01:54:44.621 --> 01:54:45.353
AGAIN.                          
OK SO ACTUALLY LET ME ASK WHAT  
ARE WE GAINING NOW?             

01:54:45.355 --> 01:54:48.991
OK SO ACTUALLY LET ME ASK WHAT  
ARE WE GAINING NOW?             
>> I'M WONDERING WHAT WE ARE    

01:54:48.993 --> 01:54:52.326
ARE WE GAINING NOW?             
>> I'M WONDERING WHAT WE ARE    
GAINING BY HAVING A SEPARATE    

01:54:52.328 --> 01:54:56.364
>> I'M WONDERING WHAT WE ARE    
GAINING BY HAVING A SEPARATE    
DISTRICT FOR THOSE CORRIDORS    

01:54:56.366 --> 01:54:57.298
GAINING BY HAVING A SEPARATE    
DISTRICT FOR THOSE CORRIDORS    
WHICH ARE MORE LIKE ARDEN'S     

01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.901
DISTRICT FOR THOSE CORRIDORS    
WHICH ARE MORE LIKE ARDEN'S     
THAN THEY ARE FOR US.           

01:54:59.903 --> 01:55:01.102
WHICH ARE MORE LIKE ARDEN'S     
THAN THEY ARE FOR US.           
>> WHY DON'T WE JUST RUN THEM   

01:55:01.104 --> 01:55:01.703
THAN THEY ARE FOR US.           
>> WHY DON'T WE JUST RUN THEM   
TO ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT      

01:55:01.705 --> 01:55:03.905
>> WHY DON'T WE JUST RUN THEM   
TO ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT      
GOING TO GET 300 FEET.          

01:55:03.907 --> 01:55:07.775
TO ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT      
GOING TO GET 300 FEET.          
SO I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE.    

01:55:07.777 --> 01:55:08.943
GOING TO GET 300 FEET.          
SO I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE.    
BUT I'M OK AND I'M HAPPY FOR IF 

01:55:08.945 --> 01:55:11.946
SO I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE.    
BUT I'M OK AND I'M HAPPY FOR IF 
SOMEONE WAS GOING JUMP IN AND   

01:55:11.948 --> 01:55:12.747
BUT I'M OK AND I'M HAPPY FOR IF 
SOMEONE WAS GOING JUMP IN AND   
TELL ME WHAT I'M NOT SEEING     

01:55:12.749 --> 01:55:13.481
SOMEONE WAS GOING JUMP IN AND   
TELL ME WHAT I'M NOT SEEING     
ABOUT THE DISTINCTION THAT'S    

01:55:13.483 --> 01:55:15.717
TELL ME WHAT I'M NOT SEEING     
ABOUT THE DISTINCTION THAT'S    
BEING ADDED.                    

01:55:15.719 --> 01:55:20.122
ABOUT THE DISTINCTION THAT'S    
BEING ADDED.                    
I DO WANT TO WONDER WHY WE WERE 

01:55:20.124 --> 01:55:23.224
BEING ADDED.                    
I DO WANT TO WONDER WHY WE WERE 
DOWN ZONE PARTS OF DC ONE TO    

01:55:23.226 --> 01:55:27.295
I DO WANT TO WONDER WHY WE WERE 
DOWN ZONE PARTS OF DC ONE TO    
THIS THIS NEW CATEGORY THAT     

01:55:27.297 --> 01:55:31.232
DOWN ZONE PARTS OF DC ONE TO    
THIS THIS NEW CATEGORY THAT     
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME   

01:55:31.234 --> 01:55:32.133
THIS THIS NEW CATEGORY THAT     
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME   
AND THOUGH I'M OPEN TO THE NEW  

01:55:32.135 --> 01:55:34.368
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME   
AND THOUGH I'M OPEN TO THE NEW  
CATEGORY FOR THE ARTERIES RIGHT 

01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:35.003
AND THOUGH I'M OPEN TO THE NEW  
CATEGORY FOR THE ARTERIES RIGHT 
NOW, I'VE COMPLETELY TURNED     

01:55:35.005 --> 01:55:37.605
CATEGORY FOR THE ARTERIES RIGHT 
NOW, I'VE COMPLETELY TURNED     
MYSELF SORT OF INSIDE OUT ABOUT 

01:55:37.607 --> 01:55:38.473
NOW, I'VE COMPLETELY TURNED     
MYSELF SORT OF INSIDE OUT ABOUT 
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE VALUE    

01:55:38.475 --> 01:55:42.410
MYSELF SORT OF INSIDE OUT ABOUT 
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE VALUE    
ADDED IS OF ADDING THIS RATHER  

01:55:42.412 --> 01:55:43.278
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE VALUE    
ADDED IS OF ADDING THIS RATHER  
THAN JUST EXTENDING TO ONE.     

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:45.580
ADDED IS OF ADDING THIS RATHER  
THAN JUST EXTENDING TO ONE.     
>> SO THAT'S THAT IS ONE THING  

01:55:45.582 --> 01:55:46.581
THAN JUST EXTENDING TO ONE.     
>> SO THAT'S THAT IS ONE THING  
PERHAPS I SHOULD LEAVE IT THERE

PERHAPS I SHOULD LEAVE IT THERE 
AND JUST COME BACK LATER.       

01:55:47.317 --> 01:55:49.951
PERHAPS I SHOULD LEAVE IT THERE 
AND JUST COME BACK LATER.       
BUT THE OTHER THINGS I WANTED   

01:55:49.953 --> 01:55:50.985
AND JUST COME BACK LATER.       
BUT THE OTHER THINGS I WANTED   
TO ASK ABOUT WERE SOME OF THE   

01:55:50.987 --> 01:55:54.222
BUT THE OTHER THINGS I WANTED   
TO ASK ABOUT WERE SOME OF THE   
PREMISES AROUND THE IDEA OF THE 

01:55:54.224 --> 01:55:54.856
TO ASK ABOUT WERE SOME OF THE   
PREMISES AROUND THE IDEA OF THE 
EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT AND I       

01:55:54.858 --> 01:55:57.225
PREMISES AROUND THE IDEA OF THE 
EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT AND I       
WANTED TO REALLY CONFRONT THE   

01:55:57.227 --> 01:56:00.728
EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT AND I       
WANTED TO REALLY CONFRONT THE   
QUESTION OF SELF INDUSTRIAL SO  

01:56:00.730 --> 01:56:01.762
WANTED TO REALLY CONFRONT THE   
QUESTION OF SELF INDUSTRIAL SO  
IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S TWO AREAS 

01:56:01.764 --> 01:56:02.363
QUESTION OF SELF INDUSTRIAL SO  
IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S TWO AREAS 
OF SOUTH INDUSTRIAL HERE.       

01:56:02.365 --> 01:56:05.533
IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S TWO AREAS 
OF SOUTH INDUSTRIAL HERE.       
THERE'S AN AREA THAT'S NORTH    

01:56:05.535 --> 01:56:06.267
OF SOUTH INDUSTRIAL HERE.       
THERE'S AN AREA THAT'S NORTH    
OF 94 AND THERE'S AN AREA

THERE'S AN AREA THAT'S NORTH    
OF 94 AND THERE'S AN AREA       
THAT'S SOUTH OF 94 AND WE HAVE  

01:56:09.073 --> 01:56:13.241
OF 94 AND THERE'S AN AREA       
THAT'S SOUTH OF 94 AND WE HAVE  
HAD DISCUSSIONS AND CALLS SINCE 

01:56:13.243 --> 01:56:13.875
THAT'S SOUTH OF 94 AND WE HAVE  
HAD DISCUSSIONS AND CALLS SINCE 
WE STARTED ZONING TO SEE ONE    

01:56:13.877 --> 01:56:16.244
HAD DISCUSSIONS AND CALLS SINCE 
WE STARTED ZONING TO SEE ONE    
WHICH IS QUITE A WHILE AGO NOW  

01:56:16.246 --> 01:56:16.912
WE STARTED ZONING TO SEE ONE    
WHICH IS QUITE A WHILE AGO NOW  
THAT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL BE        

01:56:16.914 --> 01:56:20.382
WHICH IS QUITE A WHILE AGO NOW  
THAT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL BE        
INCLUDED IN THAT AND THAT'S     

01:56:20.384 --> 01:56:21.249
THAT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL BE        
INCLUDED IN THAT AND THAT'S     
WHAT I'M HEARING AGAIN IS A     

01:56:21.251 --> 01:56:24.719
INCLUDED IN THAT AND THAT'S     
WHAT I'M HEARING AGAIN IS A     
DESIRE THAT AT LEAST THE PART   

01:56:24.721 --> 01:56:25.419
WHAT I'M HEARING AGAIN IS A     
DESIRE THAT AT LEAST THE PART   
OF SOUTH INDUSTRIAL THAT'S

DESIRE THAT AT LEAST THE PART   
OF SOUTH INDUSTRIAL THAT'S      
NORTH OF 94 BE ZONED ONE AND I  

01:56:32.096 --> 01:56:33.027
OF SOUTH INDUSTRIAL THAT'S      
NORTH OF 94 BE ZONED ONE AND I  
JUST THINK IT'S TIME WE NEED TO 

01:56:33.029 --> 01:56:35.796
NORTH OF 94 BE ZONED ONE AND I

OF GRACE BECAUSE WE HAVE YET IN 
THREE YEARS AND A SQUARE MILE   

01:59:38.181 --> 01:59:38.913
OF GRACE BECAUSE WE HAVE YET IN 
THREE YEARS AND A SQUARE MILE   
TO SEE A DEVELOPMENT BUILT      

01:59:38.915 --> 01:59:41.850
THREE YEARS AND A SQUARE MILE

SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT    
WHY NOT ZONE SOMETHING TO WHY   
NOT JUST CALL RELATING TO ONE,

MIND ONE WAY THAT I THINK ABOUT 
THE MIXED USE TRANSITION        

01:59:50.961 --> 01:59:54.296
MIND ONE WAY THAT I THINK ABOUT 
THE MIXED USE TRANSITION        
DISTRICT IS THAT IT MIGHT VERY  

01:59:54.298 --> 01:59:57.799
THE MIXED USE TRANSITION        
DISTRICT IS THAT IT MIGHT VERY  
WELL HAVE A RESPONSIVE HEIGHT

DISTRICT IS THAT IT MIGHT VERY  
WELL HAVE A RESPONSIVE HEIGHT   
LIMITATION BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE  

01:59:58.602 --> 02:00:02.036
WELL HAVE A RESPONSIVE HEIGHT   
LIMITATION BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE  
THE SAME AS WHAT OUR CURRENT    

02:00:02.038 --> 02:00:05.706
LIMITATION BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE  
THE SAME AS WHAT OUR CURRENT    
D.C. ONE DISTRICT IS IT BECAUSE 

02:00:05.708 --> 02:00:06.507
THE SAME AS WHAT OUR CURRENT    
D.C. ONE DISTRICT IS IT BECAUSE 
PERHAPS IT HAS MORE LIKELIHOOD  

02:00:06.509 --> 02:00:10.111
D.C. ONE DISTRICT IS IT BECAUSE 
PERHAPS IT HAS MORE LIKELIHOOD  
OR MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON

RESIDENTIAL IN RESIDENTIAL      
AREAS IT MIGHT NOT DEMAND THE   
SAME STEP BACK AND HIGHER       

02:00:14.884 --> 02:00:18.352
AREAS IT MIGHT NOT DEMAND THE   
SAME STEP BACK AND HIGHER       
FRAMEWORK THAT A DISTRICT OF UP 

02:00:18.354 --> 02:00:22.757
SAME STEP BACK AND HIGHER       
FRAMEWORK THAT A DISTRICT OF UP 
TO 300 BUILDINGS.

TO 300 BUILDINGS.               
LET'S KEEP THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. 
VERY FEW CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT    

02:00:25.862 --> 02:00:26.794
LET'S KEEP THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. 
VERY FEW CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT    
MIGHT BE DESIRED BY OUR         

02:00:26.796 --> 02:00:30.064
VERY FEW CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT    
MIGHT BE DESIRED BY OUR         
REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

SO ONE WAY ONE REASON TO DO     

02:00:31.033 --> 02:00:34.201
REGULATORY AUTHORITY.           
SO ONE WAY ONE REASON TO DO     
THIS IS THAT IT MIGHT NOT

SO ONE WAY ONE REASON TO DO     
THIS IS THAT IT MIGHT NOT       
FOLLOW THE SAME ADJACENT

THIS IS THAT IT MIGHT NOT

IT IS AND I THINK TO WHAT SOME  
OF THE PUBLIC HAD MENTIONED     
LIKE WHY ARE WE DOWN ZONING THE 

02:02:55.445 --> 02:02:59.280
OF THE PUBLIC HAD MENTIONED     
LIKE WHY ARE WE DOWN ZONING THE 
ONE DISTRICTS WE ARE NOT WE

ONE DISTRICTS WE ARE NOT WE     
HAVE NOT DONE ZONED ANYTHING    

02:03:00.082 --> 02:03:00.681

BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ZONING        
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE      
OF THE WAY DC ONE WORKS EVEN IF 

02:03:07.557 --> 02:03:08.489
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE      
OF THE WAY DC ONE WORKS EVEN IF 
YOU DID ZONE THE CORRIDOR       

02:03:08.491 --> 02:03:11.692
OF THE WAY DC ONE WORKS EVEN IF 
YOU DID ZONE THE CORRIDOR       
DAQUAN AS COMMISSIONERS MENTION 

02:03:11.694 --> 02:03:15.129
YOU DID ZONE THE CORRIDOR       
DAQUAN AS COMMISSIONERS MENTION 
THE DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS    

02:03:15.131 --> 02:03:15.930
DAQUAN AS COMMISSIONERS MENTION 
THE DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS    
AND THEIR ADJACENCY TO          

02:03:15.932 --> 02:03:18.632
THE DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS    
AND THEIR ADJACENCY TO          
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS WOULD     

02:03:18.634 --> 02:03:19.433
AND THEIR ADJACENCY TO          
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS WOULD     
MEAN THAT YOU COULDN'T ACTUALLY 

02:03:19.435 --> 02:03:22.503

I THINK THIS FITS WITH THIS     
KIND OF VISION OF THE CORRIDOR, 
THE TRANSITION CORRIDORS I GET  

02:07:49.338 --> 02:07:53.541
KIND OF VISION OF THE CORRIDOR, 
THE TRANSITION CORRIDORS I GET  
I'M A LITTLE BIT BAFFLED BY CAN 

02:07:53.543 --> 02:07:54.008
THE TRANSITION CORRIDORS I GET  
I'M A LITTLE BIT BAFFLED BY CAN 
I CLEAR?                        

02:07:54.010 --> 02:07:54.809
I'M A LITTLE BIT BAFFLED BY CAN 
I CLEAR?                        
CAN YOU TALKED ABOUT IT FITS    

02:07:54.811 --> 02:07:57.845

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE        

02:07:59.215 --> 02:07:59.680
TO THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE        
MAJORITY DENSITY.               

02:07:59.682 --> 02:08:01.782
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE        
MAJORITY DENSITY.               
YOU'RE SAYING THAT FORCE RATE   

02:08:01.784 --> 02:08:02.516
MAJORITY DENSITY.               
YOU'RE SAYING THAT FORCE RATE   
IS APPROPRIATE TO TRANSITION TO 

02:08:02.518 --> 02:08:03.317
YOU'RE SAYING THAT FORCE RATE   
IS APPROPRIATE TO TRANSITION TO 
THESE CORRIDORS THAT MIGHT BE   

02:08:03.319 --> 02:08:05.018
IS APPROPRIATE TO TRANSITION TO 
THESE CORRIDORS THAT MIGHT BE   
TALLER AS KNOW I'M KIND         

02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:05.586
THESE CORRIDORS THAT MIGHT BE   
TALLER AS KNOW I'M KIND         
OF BOUNCING OFF OF THE          

02:08:05.588 --> 02:08:08.589
TALLER AS KNOW I'M KIND         
OF BOUNCING OFF OF THE          
TRANSITION CORRIDOR.            

02:08:08.591 --> 02:08:09.857
OF BOUNCING OFF OF THE          
TRANSITION CORRIDOR.            
OK, AND WHAT AND IT'S THE FACT  

02:08:09.859 --> 02:08:10.524
TRANSITION CORRIDOR.            
OK, AND WHAT AND IT'S THE FACT  
THAT THIS IS PRESENTING A       

02:08:10.526 --> 02:08:13.127
OK, AND WHAT AND IT'S THE FACT  
THAT THIS IS PRESENTING A       
VISION OF WHAT THE CITY MIGHT   

02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.861
THAT THIS IS PRESENTING A       
VISION OF WHAT THE CITY MIGHT   
LOOK LIKE OVER TIME AS IT       

02:08:13.863 --> 02:08:14.195
VISION OF WHAT THE CITY MIGHT   
LOOK LIKE OVER TIME AS IT       
BUILDS UP.                      

02:08:14.197 --> 02:08:17.231
LOOK LIKE OVER TIME AS IT       
BUILDS UP.                      
OK, SO I I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THE 

02:08:17.233 --> 02:08:17.965
BUILDS UP.                      
OK, SO I I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THE 
WHOLE LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS    

02:08:17.967 --> 02:08:19.800
OK, SO I I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THE 
WHOLE LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS    
WILL TURN INTO THAT.            

02:08:19.802 --> 02:08:21.035
WHOLE LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS    
WILL TURN INTO THAT.            
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THE  

02:08:21.037 --> 02:08:21.702
WILL TURN INTO THAT.            
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THE  
WHOLE IDEA IS TO REALLY         

02:08:21.704 --> 02:08:23.537
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THE  
WHOLE IDEA IS TO REALLY         
ENCOURAGE TRANSIT BRAIN         

02:08:23.539 --> 02:08:24.172
WHOLE IDEA IS TO REALLY         
ENCOURAGE TRANSIT BRAIN         
DEVELOPMENT WHERE PEOPLE CAN    

02:08:24.174 --> 02:08:27.608
ENCOURAGE TRANSIT BRAIN         
DEVELOPMENT WHERE PEOPLE CAN    
LIVE WALK OUT OF THEIR HOUSE,   

02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:28.276
DEVELOPMENT WHERE PEOPLE CAN    
LIVE WALK OUT OF THEIR HOUSE,   
THAT TRANSITION HAPPENING ALONG 

02:08:28.278 --> 02:08:29.009
LIVE WALK OUT OF THEIR HOUSE,   
THAT TRANSITION HAPPENING ALONG 
THOSE BUSY BUSIER CORRIDORS     

02:08:29.011 --> 02:08:31.679
THAT TRANSITION HAPPENING ALONG 
THOSE BUSY BUSIER CORRIDORS     
THAT PRESUMABLY WILL HAVE       

02:08:31.681 --> 02:08:32.546
THOSE BUSY BUSIER CORRIDORS     
THAT PRESUMABLY WILL HAVE       
DEDICATED BUS LANES AND QUICK   

02:08:32.548 --> 02:08:35.950
THAT PRESUMABLY WILL HAVE       
DEDICATED BUS LANES AND QUICK   
TRANSIT ARE THE LIKELY PLACE    

02:08:35.952 --> 02:08:36.750
DEDICATED BUS LANES AND QUICK   
TRANSIT ARE THE LIKELY PLACE    
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FIRST    

02:08:36.752 --> 02:08:40.187
TRANSIT ARE THE LIKELY PLACE    
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FIRST    
I'M RAMBLING A LITTLE BIT TOO.  

02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:41.121
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FIRST    
I'M RAMBLING A LITTLE BIT TOO.  
I'M KIND OF HITTING OFF POINTS  

02:08:41.123 --> 02:08:42.924
I'M RAMBLING A LITTLE BIT TOO.  
I'M KIND OF HITTING OFF POINTS  
I WANTED NOT IRONICALLY         

02:08:42.926 --> 02:08:47.661
I'M KIND OF HITTING OFF POINTS  
I WANTED NOT IRONICALLY         
HISTORICALLY WHEN PLANNERS,     

02:08:47.663 --> 02:08:48.328
I WANTED NOT IRONICALLY         
HISTORICALLY WHEN PLANNERS,     
DESIGNERS, ZONING OFFICIALS     

02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:48.996
HISTORICALLY WHEN PLANNERS,     
DESIGNERS, ZONING OFFICIALS     
TALKED ABOUT THE HIGHEST AND    

02:08:48.998 --> 02:08:50.498
DESIGNERS, ZONING OFFICIALS     
TALKED ABOUT THE HIGHEST AND

02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:51.232
TALKED ABOUT THE HIGHEST AND    
BEST USE THEY WERE USUALLY      
TALKING ABOUT COMMERCIAL        

02:08:51.234 --> 02:08:51.833
BEST USE THEY WERE USUALLY      
TALKING ABOUT COMMERCIAL        
INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES BECAUSE   

02:08:51.835 --> 02:08:52.599
TALKING ABOUT COMMERCIAL        
INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES BECAUSE   
THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT THE MOST   

02:08:52.601 --> 02:08:55.303
INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES BECAUSE   
THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT THE MOST   
MONEY AND WE WERE PROTECTING    

02:08:55.305 --> 02:08:56.103
THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT THE MOST   
MONEY AND WE WERE PROTECTING    
THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME FROM THE 

02:08:56.105 --> 02:08:59.072
MONEY AND WE WERE PROTECTING    
THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME FROM THE 
HIGHEST AND ECONOMIC USES.      

02:08:59.074 --> 02:09:00.240
THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME FROM THE 
HIGHEST AND ECONOMIC USES.      
HOW BAD IS OUR HOUSING CRISIS   

02:09:00.242 --> 02:09:03.211
HIGHEST AND ECONOMIC USES.      
HOW BAD IS OUR HOUSING CRISIS   
THAT THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE   

02:09:03.213 --> 02:09:03.611
HOW BAD IS OUR HOUSING CRISIS   
THAT THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE   
IS HOUSING?                     

02:09:03.613 --> 02:09:03.944
THAT THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE   
IS HOUSING?                     
RIGHT.                          

02:09:03.946 --> 02:09:06.414
IS HOUSING?                     
RIGHT.                          
I MEAN THAT'S JUST COMPLETELY   

02:09:06.416 --> 02:09:07.148
RIGHT.                          
I MEAN THAT'S JUST COMPLETELY   
INVERTING THE HISTORICAL        

02:09:07.150 --> 02:09:10.751
I MEAN THAT'S JUST COMPLETELY   
INVERTING THE HISTORICAL        
PATTERN OF OF WHAT WE'RE        

02:09:10.753 --> 02:09:11.051
INVERTING THE HISTORICAL        
PATTERN OF OF WHAT WE'RE        
NEEDING.

PATTERN OF OF WHAT WE'RE        
NEEDING.                        
SO I THINK THERE'S A ROLE FOR I 

02:09:12.055 --> 02:09:14.188
NEEDING.                        
SO I THINK THERE'S A ROLE FOR I 
DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO ZONE 

02:09:14.190 --> 02:09:14.922
SO I THINK THERE'S A ROLE FOR I 
DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO ZONE 
SPECIFICALLY TO MAXIMIZE        

02:09:14.924 --> 02:09:17.992
DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO ZONE 
SPECIFICALLY TO MAXIMIZE        
PRIVATE PROPERTY RETURN ON      

02:09:17.994 --> 02:09:18.793
SPECIFICALLY TO MAXIMIZE        
PRIVATE PROPERTY RETURN ON      
THEIR INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THERE 

02:09:18.795 --> 02:09:21.929
PRIVATE PROPERTY RETURN ON      
THEIR INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THERE 
ARE LARGER COMMUNITY THINGS WE  

02:09:21.931 --> 02:09:22.697
THEIR INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THERE 
ARE LARGER COMMUNITY THINGS WE  
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AND NOT     

02:09:22.699 --> 02:09:23.230
ARE LARGER COMMUNITY THINGS WE  
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AND NOT     
FOCUS ON THAT.                  

02:09:23.232 --> 02:09:25.532
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AND NOT     
FOCUS ON THAT.                  
BUT WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IT  

02:09:25.534 --> 02:09:25.766
FOCUS ON THAT.                  
BUT WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IT  
.                               

02:09:25.768 --> 02:09:29.603
BUT WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IT  
.                               
>> I I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED  

02:09:29.605 --> 02:09:30.404

BY THE RETAIL DESIGNATIONS TO   

02:09:30.406 --> 02:09:33.741
>> I I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED  
BY THE RETAIL DESIGNATIONS TO   
MY MIND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM     

02:09:33.743 --> 02:09:34.975
BY THE RETAIL DESIGNATIONS TO   
MY MIND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM     
THAT WE FACE IN ANN ARBOR IS SO 

02:09:34.977 --> 02:09:37.077
MY MIND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM     
THAT WE FACE IN ANN ARBOR IS SO 
MUCH OF THE CITY IS BUILT OUT   

02:09:37.079 --> 02:09:38.012
THAT WE FACE IN ANN ARBOR IS SO 
MUCH OF THE CITY IS BUILT OUT   
IN A WAY THAT IT'S GOING TO     

02:09:38.014 --> 02:09:38.746
MUCH OF THE CITY IS BUILT OUT   
IN A WAY THAT IT'S GOING TO     
TAKE A LONG TIME FOR PEOPLE TO  

02:09:38.748 --> 02:09:41.248
IN A WAY THAT IT'S GOING TO     
TAKE A LONG TIME FOR PEOPLE TO  
ACCEPT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING 

02:09:41.250 --> 02:09:42.049
TAKE A LONG TIME FOR PEOPLE TO  
ACCEPT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING 
TO BUILD OUT IS TO BUILD        

02:09:42.051 --> 02:09:42.783
ACCEPT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING 
TO BUILD OUT IS TO BUILD        
DENSELY IN THE PLACES WHERE YOU 

02:09:42.785 --> 02:09:45.485
TO BUILD OUT IS TO BUILD        
DENSELY IN THE PLACES WHERE YOU 
CAN WHICH IS THE RETAIL         

02:09:45.487 --> 02:09:46.120
DENSELY IN THE PLACES WHERE YOU 
CAN WHICH IS THE RETAIL         
QUARTERS WITH THE HOW CAN BIG   

02:09:46.122 --> 02:09:48.789
CAN WHICH IS THE RETAIL         
QUARTERS WITH THE HOW CAN BIG   
PARKING LOTS THAT ARE SITTING   

02:09:48.791 --> 02:09:49.724
QUARTERS WITH THE HOW CAN BIG   
PARKING LOTS THAT ARE SITTING   
RIGHT NOW THAT COULD BE TOTALLY 

02:09:49.726 --> 02:09:50.391
PARKING LOTS THAT ARE SITTING   
RIGHT NOW THAT COULD BE TOTALLY 
REDEVELOPED WITH HIGHER DENSITY 

02:09:50.393 --> 02:09:53.627
RIGHT NOW THAT COULD BE TOTALLY 
REDEVELOPED WITH HIGHER DENSITY 
HOUSING MIXED USE, WHY ARE WE   

02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:56.997
REDEVELOPED WITH HIGHER DENSITY 
HOUSING MIXED USE, WHY ARE WE   
CONSTRAINING THEM TO TO A       

02:09:56.999 --> 02:09:57.632
HOUSING MIXED USE, WHY ARE WE   
CONSTRAINING THEM TO TO A       
SHOPPING MALL LIKE SETTINGS     

02:09:57.634 --> 02:10:00.100
CONSTRAINING THEM TO TO A       
SHOPPING MALL LIKE SETTINGS     
WHICH I THINK IS WHAT THIS IS   

02:10:00.102 --> 02:10:00.534
SHOPPING MALL LIKE SETTINGS     
WHICH I THINK IS WHAT THIS IS   
ENVISIONING?                    

02:10:00.536 --> 02:10:01.201
WHICH I THINK IS WHAT THIS IS   
ENVISIONING?                    
AND THEN THE OTHER PROBLEM IS   

02:10:01.203 --> 02:10:01.969
ENVISIONING?                    
AND THEN THE OTHER PROBLEM IS   
THE SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS 

02:10:01.971 --> 02:10:04.472
AND THEN THE OTHER PROBLEM IS   
THE SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS 
WHERE ARE FOLKS LIVING THERE    

02:10:04.474 --> 02:10:05.339
THE SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS 
WHERE ARE FOLKS LIVING THERE    
WHO JUST ARE GOING TO FIERCELY  

02:10:05.341 --> 02:10:07.775
WHERE ARE FOLKS LIVING THERE    
WHO JUST ARE GOING TO FIERCELY  
RESIST ANY KIND OF INCREASINGLY 

02:10:07.777 --> 02:10:08.575
WHO JUST ARE GOING TO FIERCELY  
RESIST ANY KIND OF INCREASINGLY 
UNSEEN UNTIL MAYBE THEY REALIZE 

02:10:08.577 --> 02:10:09.210
RESIST ANY KIND OF INCREASINGLY 
UNSEEN UNTIL MAYBE THEY REALIZE 
IT'S ACTUALLY HIGH END PIECE    

02:10:09.212 --> 02:10:10.043
UNSEEN UNTIL MAYBE THEY REALIZE 
IT'S ACTUALLY HIGH END PIECE    
COMING IN THAT'S GOING TO RAISE 

02:10:10.045 --> 02:10:12.179
IT'S ACTUALLY HIGH END PIECE    
COMING IN THAT'S GOING TO RAISE 
THEIR PROPERTY VALUES?          

02:10:12.181 --> 02:10:12.780
COMING IN THAT'S GOING TO RAISE 
THEIR PROPERTY VALUES?          
OH MY GOSH.                     

02:10:12.782 --> 02:10:13.780
THEIR PROPERTY VALUES?          
OH MY GOSH.                     
I DON'T THINK WE COULD AFFORD   

02:10:13.782 --> 02:10:15.816
OH MY GOSH.                     
I DON'T THINK WE COULD AFFORD   
TO BUY THE HOUSE WE'RE LIVING   

02:10:15.818 --> 02:10:16.784
I DON'T THINK WE COULD AFFORD   
TO BUY THE HOUSE WE'RE LIVING   
IN NOW BECAUSE OF THE INFLATING 

02:10:16.786 --> 02:10:20.287
TO BUY THE HOUSE WE'RE LIVING   
IN NOW BECAUSE OF THE INFLATING 
PRICES THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE   

02:10:20.289 --> 02:10:23.890
IN NOW BECAUSE OF THE INFLATING 
PRICES THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE   
AND IT'LL BE TO THE DETRIMENT   

02:10:23.892 --> 02:10:24.625
PRICES THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE   
AND IT'LL BE TO THE DETRIMENT   
OF ALL OF US IF THAT TREND      

02:10:24.627 --> 02:10:27.094
AND IT'LL BE TO THE DETRIMENT   
OF ALL OF US IF THAT TREND      
KEEPS GOING.                    

02:10:27.096 --> 02:10:33.734
OF ALL OF US IF THAT TREND      
KEEPS GOING.                    
SO SO I GUESS PUSHING BACK ON   

02:10:33.736 --> 02:10:34.601
KEEPS GOING.                    
SO SO I GUESS PUSHING BACK ON   
PICKING OUT PARTS OF THIS       

02:10:34.603 --> 02:10:38.005
SO SO I GUESS PUSHING BACK ON   
PICKING OUT PARTS OF THIS       
OF THE PLANNING OF THE CITY AND 

02:10:38.007 --> 02:10:38.940
PICKING OUT PARTS OF THIS       
OF THE PLANNING OF THE CITY AND 
SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET   

02:10:38.942 --> 02:10:39.473
OF THE PLANNING OF THE CITY AND 
SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET   
HOUSING THERE.                  

02:10:39.475 --> 02:10:40.274
SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET   
HOUSING THERE.                  
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME.  

02:10:40.276 --> 02:10:42.309
HOUSING THERE.                  
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME.

ALLOCATE SPACE FOR THESE        
HYPOTHETICAL STARTUPS WHEN      

02:20:54.990 --> 02:20:58.559
ALLOCATE SPACE FOR THESE        
HYPOTHETICAL STARTUPS WHEN      
THEY'VE GOT TONS OF LAND JUST   

02:20:58.561 --> 02:21:01.762
HYPOTHETICAL STARTUPS WHEN      
THEY'VE GOT TONS OF LAND JUST   
SITTING EMPTY IN THAT SAME AREA 

02:21:01.764 --> 02:21:02.562
THEY'VE GOT TONS OF LAND JUST   
SITTING EMPTY IN THAT SAME AREA 
,I DON'T LIKE IT.               

02:21:02.564 --> 02:21:06.432
SITTING EMPTY IN THAT SAME AREA 
,I DON'T LIKE IT.               
I JUST I LIKE I THINK LIKE THE  

02:21:06.434 --> 02:21:09.068
,I DON'T LIKE IT.               
I JUST I LIKE I THINK LIKE THE  
MORE HOUSING IN THAT AREA WOULD 

02:21:09.070 --> 02:21:09.870
I JUST I LIKE I THINK LIKE THE  
MORE HOUSING IN THAT AREA WOULD 
BENEFIT IT A LOT MORE THAN      

02:21:09.872 --> 02:21:13.039
MORE HOUSING IN THAT AREA WOULD 
BENEFIT IT A LOT MORE THAN      
HOLDING SPACE FOR SOMETHING     

02:21:13.041 --> 02:21:13.906
BENEFIT IT A LOT MORE THAN      
HOLDING SPACE FOR SOMETHING     
THAT WE THINK MIGHT HAPPEN IN   

02:21:13.908 --> 02:21:16.943
HOLDING SPACE FOR SOMETHING     
THAT WE THINK MIGHT HAPPEN IN   
THE FUTURE.                     

02:21:16.945 --> 02:21:17.844
THAT WE THINK MIGHT HAPPEN IN   
THE FUTURE.                     
AND I GUESS I COULD MAKE        

02:21:17.846 --> 02:21:19.746
THE FUTURE.                     
AND I GUESS I COULD MAKE        
SIMILAR COMMENTS FOR THE OTHER  

02:21:19.748 --> 02:21:20.146
AND I GUESS I COULD MAKE        
SIMILAR COMMENTS FOR THE OTHER  
AREAS.                          

02:21:20.148 --> 02:21:21.314
SIMILAR COMMENTS FOR THE OTHER  
AREAS.                          
I JUST DON'T SEE A NEED TO      

02:21:21.316 --> 02:21:24.684
AREAS.                          
I JUST DON'T SEE A NEED TO      
DISTINGUISH THEM SO MUCH FROM   

02:21:24.686 --> 02:21:25.385
I JUST DON'T SEE A NEED TO      
DISTINGUISH THEM SO MUCH FROM   
EACH OTHER AT THIS POINT.       

02:21:25.387 --> 02:21:28.921
DISTINGUISH THEM SO MUCH FROM   
EACH OTHER AT THIS POINT.       
>> I WHEN WE LET'S GO BACK TO   

02:21:28.923 --> 02:21:29.622
EACH OTHER AT THIS POINT.       
>> I WHEN WE LET'S GO BACK TO   
SOMETHING BUT WHEN WE ZONED     

02:21:29.624 --> 02:21:32.426
>> I WHEN WE LET'S GO BACK TO   
SOMETHING BUT WHEN WE ZONED     
THESE CORRIDORS TAKE ONE I      

02:21:32.428 --> 02:21:33.226
SOMETHING BUT WHEN WE ZONED     
THESE CORRIDORS TAKE ONE I      
THINK WE ZONE THEM ALL TAKE ONE 

02:21:33.228 --> 02:21:35.996
THESE CORRIDORS TAKE ONE I      
THINK WE ZONE THEM ALL TAKE ONE 
WE DIDN'T ZONE ONE OF THEM TWO  

02:21:35.998 --> 02:21:36.763
THINK WE ZONE THEM ALL TAKE ONE 
WE DIDN'T ZONE ONE OF THEM TWO  
OR THREE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT     

02:21:36.765 --> 02:21:40.334
WE DIDN'T ZONE ONE OF THEM TWO  
OR THREE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT     
THAT THEY HAD VERY SIMILAR      

02:21:40.336 --> 02:21:41.201
OR THREE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT     
THAT THEY HAD VERY SIMILAR      
FEELING LIKE YES, THERE IS AN   

02:21:41.203 --> 02:21:47.374
THAT THEY HAD VERY SIMILAR      
FEELING LIKE YES, THERE IS AN   
URBAN LAND                      

02:22:01.022 --> 02:22:03.490
          , THERE IS A WHATEVER 
THAT ONE IS OVER ON MAPLE       
SOMETHING VILLAGE MAYBE VILLAGE 

02:22:03.492 --> 02:22:04.758
THAT ONE IS OVER ON MAPLE       
SOMETHING VILLAGE MAYBE VILLAGE 
BUT IN GENERAL WE WANTED THE

02:22:07.328 --> 02:22:08.127
WE WANTED HOUSING AND WE WANTED 
RETAIL AND WE LIKE THIS IS      
GETTING AWAY FROM THAT A LITTLE 

02:22:08.129 --> 02:22:08.795
RETAIL AND WE LIKE THIS IS      
GETTING AWAY FROM THAT A LITTLE 
BIT BY BACKING OFF THE HOUSING  

02:22:08.797 --> 02:22:09.595
GETTING AWAY FROM THAT A LITTLE 
BIT BY BACKING OFF THE HOUSING  
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE THESE A 

02:22:09.597 --> 02:22:10.330
BIT BY BACKING OFF THE HOUSING  
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE THESE A 
LOT MORE VIBRANT ZONES AREAS    

02:22:10.332 --> 02:22:10.931
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE THESE A 
LOT MORE VIBRANT ZONES AREAS    
OF THE CITY PARTICULARLY FOR    

02:22:10.933 --> 02:22:11.898
LOT MORE VIBRANT ZONES AREAS    
OF THE CITY PARTICULARLY FOR    
PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIVE HERE AND 

02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:14.401
OF THE CITY PARTICULARLY FOR

AMONG THOSE AND ALLOWING MORE   
HOUSING WITHIN THOSE ZONES.     
I KEEP CALLING THEM ZONES BUT   

02:22:29.551 --> 02:22:30.216
HOUSING WITHIN THOSE ZONES.     
I KEEP CALLING THEM ZONES BUT   
THEY'RE NOT REALLY ZONES.

INDIVIDUAL OIL WEALTH SITS IN   
THE PROPERTY VALUE OF MY HOME   
AND SO THERE'S A CONFLICT       

02:23:24.206 --> 02:23:24.971
THE PROPERTY VALUE OF MY HOME   
AND SO THERE'S A CONFLICT       
OF INTEREST BETWEEN MY FAMILY'S

SO I DON'T SUPPORT THAT.        
I THINK DENSITY ACTUALLY WE CAN 

02:23:53.802 --> 02:23:54.501
SO I DON'T SUPPORT THAT.        
I THINK DENSITY ACTUALLY WE CAN 
JUST TALK ABOUT A DEFINITION    

02:23:54.503 --> 02:23:56.569
I THINK DENSITY ACTUALLY WE CAN 
JUST TALK ABOUT A DEFINITION    
OF DENSITY WHICH IS LIKE THERE  

02:23:56.571 --> 02:23:57.303
JUST TALK ABOUT A DEFINITION    
OF DENSITY WHICH IS LIKE THERE  
ARE MORE PEOPLE PER SQUARE      

02:23:57.305 --> 02:23:57.971
OF DENSITY WHICH IS LIKE THERE  
ARE MORE PEOPLE PER SQUARE      
WHATEVER AREA YOU WANT TO       

02:23:57.973 --> 02:24:00.306
ARE MORE PEOPLE PER SQUARE      
WHATEVER AREA YOU WANT TO       
MEASURE THAN THERE ARE NOW      

02:24:00.308 --> 02:24:00.907
WHATEVER AREA YOU WANT TO       
MEASURE THAN THERE ARE NOW      
THAT'S INCREASED DENSITY.       

02:24:00.909 --> 02:24:01.975
MEASURE THAN THERE ARE NOW      
THAT'S INCREASED DENSITY.       
YOU CAN DO IT BY ADDING UNITS.  

02:24:01.977 --> 02:24:04.844
THAT'S INCREASED DENSITY.       
YOU CAN DO IT BY ADDING UNITS.  
YOU CAN DO IT BY ADDING MASS.   

02:24:04.846 --> 02:24:06.079
YOU CAN DO IT BY ADDING UNITS.  
YOU CAN DO IT BY ADDING MASS.   
>> I MEAN WE CAN DO IT IN A     

02:24:06.081 --> 02:24:07.881
YOU CAN DO IT BY ADDING MASS.   
>> I MEAN WE CAN DO IT IN A     
WHOLE LOT OF WAYS AND I THINK   

02:24:07.883 --> 02:24:08.682
>> I MEAN WE CAN DO IT IN A     
WHOLE LOT OF WAYS AND I THINK   
YEAH, AN EU DOES INCREASE       

02:24:08.684 --> 02:24:11.684
WHOLE LOT OF WAYS AND I THINK   
YEAH, AN EU DOES INCREASE       
DENSITY BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY    

02:24:11.686 --> 02:24:12.619
YEAH, AN EU DOES INCREASE       
DENSITY BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY    
NOT THE SCALE AT WHICH WE NEED  

02:24:12.621 --> 02:24:12.819
DENSITY BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY    
NOT THE SCALE AT WHICH WE NEED  
TO BE.                          

02:24:12.821 --> 02:24:16.155
NOT THE SCALE AT WHICH WE NEED  
TO BE.                          
WE NEED TO BE THINKING.         

02:24:16.157 --> 02:24:19.593
TO BE.                          
WE NEED TO BE THINKING.         
SO I AGREE WITH INCLUDING ALL

BOOKMARK BUT TO MY MIND IT      
FEELS LIKE THERE'S A KIND       

02:25:07.743 --> 02:25:11.211
BOOKMARK BUT TO MY MIND IT      
FEELS LIKE THERE'S A KIND       
OF CONSENSUS THAT LOW RISE WE

02:25:18.587 --> 02:25:22.055
JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN AND SAY 
THAT I I DON'T THINK REGULATING 
BY UNIT COUNT WORKS BECAUSE WE  

02:25:22.057 --> 02:25:22.789
THAT I I DON'T THINK REGULATING 
BY UNIT COUNT WORKS BECAUSE WE  
JUST END UP WITH THESE BIG SIX  

02:25:22.791 --> 02:25:23.322
BY UNIT COUNT WORKS BECAUSE WE  
JUST END UP WITH THESE BIG SIX  
BEDROOM UNITS.                  

02:25:23.324 --> 02:25:25.491

02:25:30.298 --> 02:25:31.231
OF THROWING YOU AN ACCOUNT

THE IDEA IS LIKE FARC WOULD     
ALLOW YOU TO THINK ABOUT OPEN   

02:25:49.851 --> 02:25:51.951
THE IDEA IS LIKE FARC WOULD

THERE WAS CONVERSATION ABOUT    

02:50:14.648 --> 02:50:17.582

SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE       

02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:37.268
THAT IS FINE.                   
SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE

03:09:01.907 --> 03:09:02.573
I WOULD CHALLENGE EVERYONE TO   
THINK ABOUT WHAT THE UTILITY    
OF THE TRANSITION MIXED-USE     

03:09:02.575 --> 03:09:06.209
THINK ABOUT WHAT THE UTILITY    
OF THE TRANSITION MIXED-USE     
TRANSITION DISTRICT IS IF WE    

03:09:06.211 --> 03:09:06.944
OF THE TRANSITION MIXED-USE     
TRANSITION DISTRICT IS IF WE    
ARE ALLOWING HIGHER HEIGHTS AND 

03:09:06.946 --> 03:09:10.280
TRANSITION DISTRICT IS IF WE    
ARE ALLOWING HIGHER HEIGHTS AND 
LOW RISE I THINK SOME OF THOSE  

03:09:10.282 --> 03:09:11.081
ARE ALLOWING HIGHER HEIGHTS AND 
LOW RISE I THINK SOME OF THOSE  
CORRIDORS THAT ARE IN PLACES    

03:09:11.083 --> 03:09:11.816
LOW RISE I THINK SOME OF THOSE  
CORRIDORS THAT ARE IN PLACES    
LIKE LONG MILLER SOME OF THE    

03:09:11.818 --> 03:09:14.484
CORRIDORS THAT ARE IN PLACES

03:09:17.723 --> 03:09:21.791
WOULD BE THE ONES THAT          
ORGANICALLY REDEVELOP ANYWAY.   
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO IMPOSE 

03:09:21.793 --> 03:09:24.962
ORGANICALLY REDEVELOP ANYWAY.   
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO IMPOSE 
A HIGHER HEIGHT ALLOWANCE THERE 

03:09:24.964 --> 03:09:25.829
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO IMPOSE 
A HIGHER HEIGHT ALLOWANCE THERE 
THAT MIGHT NOT ALLOW SOME       

03:09:25.831 --> 03:09:29.233
A HIGHER HEIGHT ALLOWANCE THERE 
THAT MIGHT NOT ALLOW SOME
