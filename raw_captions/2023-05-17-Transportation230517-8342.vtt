THIS TENDS TO HAPPEN ESPECIALLY 
WHEN WE HAVE RAISED             

00:07:50.794 --> 00:07:52.526
THIS TENDS TO HAPPEN ESPECIALLY 
WHEN WE HAVE RAISED             
INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE IT&apos;S JUST

WELL.                           
AND THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE KIND 

00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:37.699
WELL.                           
AND THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE KIND 
OF THE DASHT BIKE LANES KIND    

00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:38.633
AND THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE KIND 
OF THE DASHT BIKE LANES KIND    
OF ON THE SIDE AND THEN OF THE

OF THE DASHT BIKE LANES KIND    
OF ON THE SIDE AND THEN OF THE  
CENTER RUNNING VEHICULAR TRAVEL

BUT THEN IF THERE&apos;S ONCOMING    

00:14:46.209 --> 00:14:48.476
ROOM FOR CYCLISTS.              
BUT THEN IF THERE&apos;S ONCOMING    
TRAFFIC THEN THEY SHARE THE     

00:14:48.478 --> 00:14:49.276
BUT THEN IF THERE&apos;S ONCOMING    
TRAFFIC THEN THEY SHARE THE     
ROAD LIKE THEY WOULD IN ANY     

00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:49.744
TRAFFIC THEN THEY SHARE THE     
ROAD LIKE THEY WOULD IN ANY     
OTHER CONDITION.                

00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:52.980
ROAD LIKE THEY WOULD IN ANY     
OTHER CONDITION.                
WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE WAS A    

00:14:52.982 --> 00:14:53.681
OTHER CONDITION.                
WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE WAS A    
PRETTY POSITIVE RECEPTION AMONG 

00:14:53.683 --> 00:14:56.350
WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE WAS A    
PRETTY POSITIVE RECEPTION AMONG 
CYCLISTS WITH THAT FACILITY.    

00:14:56.352 --> 00:14:57.551
PRETTY POSITIVE RECEPTION AMONG 
CYCLISTS WITH THAT FACILITY.    
IT DID HAVE A SORT OF MARGINAL  

00:14:57.553 --> 00:15:00.521
CYCLISTS WITH THAT FACILITY.    
IT DID HAVE A SORT OF MARGINAL  
TRAFFIC CALMING EFFECT FROM     

00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:01.055
IT DID HAVE A SORT OF MARGINAL  
TRAFFIC CALMING EFFECT FROM     
WHAT WE CAN TELL.               

00:15:01.057 --> 00:15:04.925
TRAFFIC CALMING EFFECT FROM     
WHAT WE CAN TELL.               
BUT IN TERMS OF I THINK THERE   

00:15:04.927 --> 00:15:05.660
WHAT WE CAN TELL.               
BUT IN TERMS OF I THINK THERE   
WAS STILL THIS DESIRE FOR SOME  

00:15:05.662 --> 00:15:06.394
BUT IN TERMS OF I THINK THERE   
WAS STILL THIS DESIRE FOR SOME  
ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC CALMING TO   

00:15:06.396 --> 00:15:09.029
WAS STILL THIS DESIRE FOR SOME  
ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC CALMING TO   
AND GOOD NEWS TOO IS WELL I     

00:15:09.031 --> 00:15:11.833
ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC CALMING TO   
AND GOOD NEWS TOO IS WELL I     
KNOW SPEED HUMPS HAVE IMPACT ON 

00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:12.433
AND GOOD NEWS TOO IS WELL I     
KNOW SPEED HUMPS HAVE IMPACT ON 
CYCLISTS AS WELL.               

00:15:12.435 --> 00:15:13.167
KNOW SPEED HUMPS HAVE IMPACT ON 
CYCLISTS AS WELL.               
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE BIGGER  

00:15:13.169 --> 00:15:15.869
CYCLISTS AS WELL.               
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE BIGGER  
DEVICES AND NOT SPEED BUMPS WE  

00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:16.504
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE BIGGER  
DEVICES AND NOT SPEED BUMPS WE  
TEND NOT TO DO SPEED BUMPS.     

00:15:16.506 --> 00:15:19.373
DEVICES AND NOT SPEED BUMPS WE  
TEND NOT TO DO SPEED BUMPS.     
WE DO THESE MORE ELONGATED      

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:20.074
TEND NOT TO DO SPEED BUMPS.     
WE DO THESE MORE ELONGATED      
SPEED TABLES AND SPEED HUMPS    

00:15:20.076 --> 00:15:20.875
WE DO THESE MORE ELONGATED      
SPEED TABLES AND SPEED HUMPS    
AND TO RAISE CROSSWALKS THEY    

00:15:20.877 --> 00:15:23.811
SPEED TABLES AND SPEED HUMPS    
AND TO RAISE CROSSWALKS THEY    
TEND TO BE LESS JARRING FOR     

00:15:23.813 --> 00:15:24.545
AND TO RAISE CROSSWALKS THEY    
TEND TO BE LESS JARRING FOR     
CYCLISTS THEN IT&apos;S A LITTLE BIT 

00:15:24.547 --> 00:15:27.648
TEND TO BE LESS JARRING FOR     
CYCLISTS THEN IT&apos;S A LITTLE BIT 
EASIER TO GET OVER SO SO I      

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.449
CYCLISTS THEN IT&apos;S A LITTLE BIT 
EASIER TO GET OVER SO SO I      
DON&apos;T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER ABOUT  

00:15:28.451 --> 00:15:31.585
EASIER TO GET OVER SO SO I      
DON&apos;T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER ABOUT  
HOW WELL THAT PLAYED INTO THE   

00:15:31.587 --> 00:15:32.286
DON&apos;T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER ABOUT  
HOW WELL THAT PLAYED INTO THE   
NEIGHBORHOODS CONSIDERATION     

00:15:32.288 --> 00:15:35.189
HOW WELL THAT PLAYED INTO THE   
NEIGHBORHOODS CONSIDERATION     
OF THESE DEVICES BUT IT IS      

00:15:35.191 --> 00:15:36.090
NEIGHBORHOODS CONSIDERATION     
OF THESE DEVICES BUT IT IS      
SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TRYING   

00:15:36.092 --> 00:15:36.824
OF THESE DEVICES BUT IT IS      
SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TRYING   
TO BE MINDFUL OF WHEN WE CAME   

00:15:36.826 --> 00:15:40.127
SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TRYING   
TO BE MINDFUL OF WHEN WE CAME   
UP WITH THIS AND THAT&apos;S BEEN MY 

00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.828
TO BE MINDFUL OF WHEN WE CAME   
UP WITH THIS AND THAT&apos;S BEEN MY 
EXPERIENCE TO THE SPEED TABLES  

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:46.266
UP WITH THIS AND THAT&apos;S BEEN MY 
EXPERIENCE TO THE SPEED TABLES  
OR NOT NOT AS BAD AS A CYCLIST  

00:15:46.268 --> 00:15:46.467
EXPERIENCE TO THE SPEED TABLES  
OR NOT NOT AS BAD AS A CYCLIST  
.

00:18:19.188 --> 00:18:19.987
COST EFFECTIVE IT IS TO USE THE

I THINK STILL IT&apos;S TO BE        

00:18:19.989 --> 00:18:20.787
CONSULTANT FOR THIS WORK.       
I THINK STILL IT&apos;S TO BE        
DETERMINED BUT BASED ON OUR     

00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:23.457
I THINK STILL IT&apos;S TO BE        
DETERMINED BUT BASED ON OUR     
INITIAL KIND OF COST ESTIMATION 

00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:24.391
DETERMINED BUT BASED ON OUR     
INITIAL KIND OF COST ESTIMATION 
OF HOW MUCH STAFF TIME IT TAKES 

00:18:24.393 --> 00:18:27.294
INITIAL KIND OF COST ESTIMATION 
OF HOW MUCH STAFF TIME IT TAKES 
VERSUS THE CONSULTANT TIME, IT  

00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:28.028
OF HOW MUCH STAFF TIME IT TAKES 
VERSUS THE CONSULTANT TIME, IT  
SEEMED TO BE PRETTY CLOSE AND   

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.432
VERSUS THE CONSULTANT TIME, IT  
SEEMED TO BE PRETTY CLOSE AND   
COST AND SINCE STAFF HAS PULLED 

00:18:31.434 --> 00:18:32.232
SEEMED TO BE PRETTY CLOSE AND   
COST AND SINCE STAFF HAS PULLED 
A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,  

00:18:32.234 --> 00:18:32.966
COST AND SINCE STAFF HAS PULLED 
A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,  
THIS IS ALLOWING US TO PROCESS  

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:34.168
A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,  
THIS IS ALLOWING US TO PROCESS  
MORE PETITIONS.                 

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.235
THIS IS ALLOWING US TO PROCESS  
MORE PETITIONS.                 
SO I DON&apos;T WE DON&apos;T ANTICIPATE  

00:18:35.237 --> 00:18:39.539
MORE PETITIONS.                 
SO I DON&apos;T WE DON&apos;T ANTICIPATE  
A LARGE INCREASE IN THE STAFF   

00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:42.142
SO I DON&apos;T WE DON&apos;T ANTICIPATE  
A LARGE INCREASE IN THE STAFF   
COST OR THE PETITION COST AND   

00:18:42.144 --> 00:18:43.044
A LARGE INCREASE IN THE STAFF   
COST OR THE PETITION COST AND   
THE CONSTRUCTION COST IS JUST A 

00:18:43.046 --> 00:18:46.079
COST OR THE PETITION COST AND   
THE CONSTRUCTION COST IS JUST A 
FUNCTION OF WHAT THE OUTCOME    

00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:46.781
THE CONSTRUCTION COST IS JUST A 
FUNCTION OF WHAT THE OUTCOME    
OF THE PETITION PROCESS IS.     

00:18:46.783 --> 00:18:50.584
FUNCTION OF WHAT THE OUTCOME    
OF THE PETITION PROCESS IS.     
SO SO I THINK THIS IS THE THIS  

00:18:50.586 --> 00:18:51.252
OF THE PETITION PROCESS IS.     
SO SO I THINK THIS IS THE THIS  
WILL BE THE FIRST FULL FULLY

SO SO I THINK THIS IS THE THIS  
WILL BE THE FIRST FULL FULLY    
COMPLETE PROCESS.               

00:18:54.123 --> 00:18:55.122
WILL BE THE FIRST FULL FULLY    
COMPLETE PROCESS.               
WE&apos;LL HAVE LIKE ONE FULL DATA   

00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:55.989
COMPLETE PROCESS.               
WE&apos;LL HAVE LIKE ONE FULL DATA

AND WE&apos;LL HAVE A BETTER AND     
CLEARER PICTURE IF WE WANT TO   
CONTINUE THIS FORWARD AGAIN,    

00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:10.070
CLEARER PICTURE IF WE WANT TO   
CONTINUE THIS FORWARD AGAIN,    
OUR OUR WHOLE STRATEGY WITH     

00:19:10.072 --> 00:19:13.107
CONTINUE THIS FORWARD AGAIN,    
OUR OUR WHOLE STRATEGY WITH     
HIRING THE CONSULTANT WAS       

00:19:13.109 --> 00:19:13.874
OUR OUR WHOLE STRATEGY WITH     
HIRING THE CONSULTANT WAS       
BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS BIG      

00:19:13.876 --> 00:19:17.144
HIRING THE CONSULTANT WAS       
BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS BIG      
BACKLOG BECAUSE WE HAD UPWARDS  

00:19:17.146 --> 00:19:18.045
BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS BIG      
BACKLOG BECAUSE WE HAD UPWARDS  
OF 17 OR 18 PETITIONS WE JUST   

00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:21.047
BACKLOG BECAUSE WE HAD UPWARDS  
OF 17 OR 18 PETITIONS WE JUST   
REALLY NEEDED THAT ADDED ACIDY  

00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.716
OF 17 OR 18 PETITIONS WE JUST   
REALLY NEEDED THAT ADDED ACIDY  
AND THE CONSULTANT WAS          

00:19:21.718 --> 00:19:22.516
REALLY NEEDED THAT ADDED ACIDY  
AND THE CONSULTANT WAS          
AVAILABLE TO HELP US OUT AND SO 

00:19:22.518 --> 00:19:24.785
AND THE CONSULTANT WAS          
AVAILABLE TO HELP US OUT AND SO 
WE FELT IT WAS WELL WORTH IT TO 

00:19:24.787 --> 00:19:25.453
AVAILABLE TO HELP US OUT AND SO 
WE FELT IT WAS WELL WORTH IT TO 
EXPLORE THAT OPTION UNTIL WE    

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:25.986
WE FELT IT WAS WELL WORTH IT TO 
EXPLORE THAT OPTION UNTIL WE    
GET CAUGHT UP.                  

00:19:25.988 --> 00:19:29.923
EXPLORE THAT OPTION UNTIL WE    
GET CAUGHT UP.                  
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU IF YOU CAN       

00:19:29.925 --> 00:19:33.693
GET CAUGHT UP.                  
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU IF YOU CAN       
PROCESS A PETITIONS IN A YEAR,  

00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:36.530
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU IF YOU CAN       
PROCESS A PETITIONS IN A YEAR,  
DOES THAT MEAN THEN IT&apos;S        

00:19:36.532 --> 00:19:37.131
PROCESS A PETITIONS IN A YEAR,  
DOES THAT MEAN THEN IT&apos;S        
WHENEVER THE CONSTRUCTION       

00:19:37.133 --> 00:19:37.865
DOES THAT MEAN THEN IT&apos;S        
WHENEVER THE CONSTRUCTION       
OPPORTUNITY OR THE WINDOW       

00:19:37.867 --> 00:19:40.601
WHENEVER THE CONSTRUCTION       
OPPORTUNITY OR THE WINDOW       
BECOMES AVAILABLE THEN IT&apos;S     

00:19:40.603 --> 00:19:41.402
OPPORTUNITY OR THE WINDOW       
BECOMES AVAILABLE THEN IT&apos;S     
JUST KIND OF READY TO GO OR     

00:19:41.404 --> 00:19:44.605
BECOMES AVAILABLE THEN IT&apos;S     
JUST KIND OF READY TO GO OR     
WHAT IS I GUESS IT&apos;S STILL NOT  

00:19:44.607 --> 00:19:45.505
JUST KIND OF READY TO GO OR     
WHAT IS I GUESS IT&apos;S STILL NOT  
CLEAR TO ME WHAT GOOD DOES IT   

00:19:45.507 --> 00:19:46.140
WHAT IS I GUESS IT&apos;S STILL NOT  
CLEAR TO ME WHAT GOOD DOES IT   
DO TO CLEAR TEN PETITIONS IF    

00:19:46.142 --> 00:19:48.442
CLEAR TO ME WHAT GOOD DOES IT   
DO TO CLEAR TEN PETITIONS IF    
YOU CAN ONLY BUILD ONE PROJECT  

00:19:48.444 --> 00:19:48.842
DO TO CLEAR TEN PETITIONS IF    
YOU CAN ONLY BUILD ONE PROJECT  
A YEAR?                         

00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:49.110
YOU CAN ONLY BUILD ONE PROJECT  
A YEAR?                         
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        

00:19:49.112 --> 00:19:52.246
A YEAR?                         
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
SO AGAIN THAT MIGHT REQUIRE A   

00:19:52.248 --> 00:19:53.213
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
SO AGAIN THAT MIGHT REQUIRE A   
FUTURE BUDGET ASK FOR BUDGET    

00:19:53.215 --> 00:19:56.283
SO AGAIN THAT MIGHT REQUIRE A   
FUTURE BUDGET ASK FOR BUDGET    
MODIFICATION.                   

00:19:56.285 --> 00:19:57.251
FUTURE BUDGET ASK FOR BUDGET    
MODIFICATION.                   
I KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A          

00:19:57.253 --> 00:19:59.286
MODIFICATION.                   
I KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A          
DIFFICULT THING TO ASK FOR BUT  

00:19:59.288 --> 00:20:03.290
I KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A          
DIFFICULT THING TO ASK FOR BUT  
WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS WELL FIRST  

00:20:03.292 --> 00:20:04.291
DIFFICULT THING TO ASK FOR BUT  
WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS WELL FIRST  
OF ALL WE THERE WERE DURING THE 

00:20:04.293 --> 00:20:07.361
WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS WELL FIRST  
OF ALL WE THERE WERE DURING THE 
BUDGET PROCESS THERE WERE       

00:20:07.363 --> 00:20:08.195
OF ALL WE THERE WERE DURING THE 
BUDGET PROCESS THERE WERE       
ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE TRAFFIC 

00:20:08.197 --> 00:20:11.232
BUDGET PROCESS THERE WERE       
ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE TRAFFIC 
CALMING BUDGET.                 

00:20:11.234 --> 00:20:12.499
ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE TRAFFIC 
CALMING BUDGET.                 
SO I THINK GIVEN HOW MUCH ALL   

00:20:12.501 --> 00:20:15.569
CALMING BUDGET.                 
SO I THINK GIVEN HOW MUCH ALL   
THE COMPETING PRIORITIES WITHIN 

00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:16.370
SO I THINK GIVEN HOW MUCH ALL   
THE COMPETING PRIORITIES WITHIN 
THE CITY, THE INITIAL REQUEST   

00:20:16.372 --> 00:20:19.072
THE COMPETING PRIORITIES WITHIN 
THE CITY, THE INITIAL REQUEST   
WAS FOR MORE THAN WHAT IT IS    

00:20:19.074 --> 00:20:23.143
THE CITY, THE INITIAL REQUEST   
WAS FOR MORE THAN WHAT IT IS    
RIGHT NOW KNOWING OR ANTICIPATE 

00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:23.911
WAS FOR MORE THAN WHAT IT IS    
RIGHT NOW KNOWING OR ANTICIPATE 
WHAT YOU&apos;RE BRINGING UP THAT    

00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:24.911
RIGHT NOW KNOWING OR ANTICIPATE 
WHAT YOU&apos;RE BRINGING UP THAT    
THERE WOULD BE IF WE CLEARED    

00:20:24.913 --> 00:20:26.514
WHAT YOU&apos;RE BRINGING UP THAT    
THERE WOULD BE IF WE CLEARED    
OF THE BACKLOG OF PETITIONS     

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:27.280
THERE WOULD BE IF WE CLEARED    
OF THE BACKLOG OF PETITIONS     
THEN THAT MEANS WE&apos;RE GONNA     

00:20:27.282 --> 00:20:28.015
OF THE BACKLOG OF PETITIONS     
THEN THAT MEANS WE&apos;RE GONNA     
HAVE A BACKLOG OF CONSTRUCTION  

00:20:28.017 --> 00:20:30.685
THEN THAT MEANS WE&apos;RE GONNA     
HAVE A BACKLOG OF CONSTRUCTION  
AND CONSTRUCTION, THE HEAVY     

00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:31.485
HAVE A BACKLOG OF CONSTRUCTION  
AND CONSTRUCTION, THE HEAVY     
LIFT OR AT LEAST THE EXPENSIVE  

00:20:31.487 --> 00:20:31.819
AND CONSTRUCTION, THE HEAVY     
LIFT OR AT LEAST THE EXPENSIVE  
LIFT.                           

00:20:31.821 --> 00:20:35.122
LIFT OR AT LEAST THE EXPENSIVE  
LIFT.                           
BUT AGAIN, THIS IS JUST TRYING  

00:20:35.124 --> 00:20:38.425
LIFT.                           
BUT AGAIN, THIS IS JUST TRYING  
TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO CLEAR     

00:20:38.427 --> 00:20:39.126
BUT AGAIN, THIS IS JUST TRYING  
TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO CLEAR     
THIS QUEUE AND SO WE&apos;RE         

00:20:39.128 --> 00:20:41.395
TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO CLEAR     
THIS QUEUE AND SO WE&apos;RE

SO THEN THAT WAY WE CAN AT      

00:20:42.564 --> 00:20:43.330
PROCESSING THE PETITIONS.       
SO THEN THAT WAY WE CAN AT      
LEAST TEAR UP THE CONSTRUCTION  

00:20:43.332 --> 00:20:45.665
SO THEN THAT WAY WE CAN AT      
LEAST TEAR UP THE CONSTRUCTION  
AND WHETHER THAT MAKES IT INTO  

00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:46.400
LEAST TEAR UP THE CONSTRUCTION  
AND WHETHER THAT MAKES IT INTO  
THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUDGET

IDENTICAL BUT THAT&apos;S THE BASIC  
THAT WAS THE GOAL.              
AND SO I THINK NOW WE CAN LOOK  

00:26:46.528 --> 00:26:47.194

THIS POINT THAT THE BIGGEST     

00:38:02.704 --> 00:38:03.569
SOMETHING THAT I DID DRIVE HOME 
THIS POINT THAT THE BIGGEST     
CONCERN WE HAVE IS WITHOUT      

00:38:03.571 --> 00:38:07.107
THIS POINT THAT THE BIGGEST     
CONCERN WE HAVE IS WITHOUT      
GOING THROUGH SOME PROCESS TO   

00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:10.709
CONCERN WE HAVE IS WITHOUT      
GOING THROUGH SOME PROCESS TO   
IDENTIFY IF THERE&apos;S SUPPORT FOR

GOING THROUGH SOME PROCESS TO   
IDENTIFY IF THERE&apos;S SUPPORT FOR

00:38:14.749 --> 00:38:15.682
IDENTIFY IF THERE&apos;S SUPPORT FOR 
VERTICAL DEVICES WE DON&apos;T WANT  
TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE   

00:38:15.684 --> 00:38:18.651
VERTICAL DEVICES WE DON&apos;T WANT  
TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE   
HAVE TO UNDO CERTAIN THINGS.    

00:38:18.653 --> 00:38:22.522
TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE   
HAVE TO UNDO CERTAIN THINGS.    
NOW THAT&apos;S NOT TO SAY THAT YOU  

00:38:22.524 --> 00:38:23.389
HAVE TO UNDO CERTAIN THINGS.    
NOW THAT&apos;S NOT TO SAY THAT YOU  
READ ON THIS RESOLUTION COULD   

00:38:23.391 --> 00:38:25.891
NOW THAT&apos;S NOT TO SAY THAT YOU  
READ ON THIS RESOLUTION COULD   
STILL ENABLE US TO DO THAT.     

00:38:25.893 --> 00:38:29.629
READ ON THIS RESOLUTION COULD   
STILL ENABLE US TO DO THAT.     
BUT I THINK THE THE IDEA IS WE  

00:38:29.631 --> 00:38:30.830
STILL ENABLE US TO DO THAT.     
BUT I THINK THE THE IDEA IS WE  
DON&apos;T FIND IT A VERY PRODUCTIVE 

00:38:30.832 --> 00:38:37.637
BUT I THINK THE THE IDEA IS WE  
DON&apos;T FIND IT A VERY PRODUCTIVE 
USE OF RESOURCES BOTH MONITARY  

00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:38.471
DON&apos;T FIND IT A VERY PRODUCTIVE 
USE OF RESOURCES BOTH MONITARY  
CAPITAL STAFF IF WE END UP      

00:38:38.473 --> 00:38:39.338
USE OF RESOURCES BOTH MONITARY  
CAPITAL STAFF IF WE END UP      
PUTTING IN THINGS JUST TO TAKE  

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.807
CAPITAL STAFF IF WE END UP      
PUTTING IN THINGS JUST TO TAKE  
THEM.                           

00:38:41.809 --> 00:38:42.609
PUTTING IN THINGS JUST TO TAKE  
THEM.                           
AND SO WHAT&apos;S NICE ABOUT THE    

00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:46.079
THEM.                           
AND SO WHAT&apos;S NICE ABOUT THE    
EXISTING PROGRAM IS BECAUSE IT  

00:38:46.081 --> 00:38:49.782
AND SO WHAT&apos;S NICE ABOUT THE    
EXISTING PROGRAM IS BECAUSE IT  
IS A NEIGHBOR INITIATED AND     

00:38:49.784 --> 00:38:50.516
EXISTING PROGRAM IS BECAUSE IT  
IS A NEIGHBOR INITIATED AND     
IT&apos;S A VERY SORT                

00:38:50.518 --> 00:38:52.652
IS A NEIGHBOR INITIATED AND     
IT&apos;S A VERY SORT                
OF COLLABORATIVE PROCESS TO     

00:38:52.654 --> 00:38:53.319
IT&apos;S A VERY SORT                
OF COLLABORATIVE PROCESS TO     
DEVELOP THE DEVICES.            

00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:54.286
OF COLLABORATIVE PROCESS TO     
DEVELOP THE DEVICES.            
WHEN WE LOOK AT GRANGER, FOR    

00:38:54.288 --> 00:38:57.356
DEVELOP THE DEVICES.            
WHEN WE LOOK AT GRANGER, FOR    
EXAMPLE, THAT YOU ALL JUST      

00:38:57.358 --> 00:39:00.827
WHEN WE LOOK AT GRANGER, FOR    
EXAMPLE, THAT YOU ALL JUST      
RECOMMENDED WE WENT THROUGH A   

00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:01.694
EXAMPLE, THAT YOU ALL JUST      
RECOMMENDED WE WENT THROUGH A   
LOT OF ITERATIONS TO GET TO     

00:39:01.696 --> 00:39:02.095
RECOMMENDED WE WENT THROUGH A   
LOT OF ITERATIONS TO GET TO     
THAT POINT.                     

00:39:02.097 --> 00:39:05.365
LOT OF ITERATIONS TO GET TO     
THAT POINT.                     
WE WON&apos;T BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON  

00:39:05.367 --> 00:39:06.099
THAT POINT.                     
WE WON&apos;T BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON  
EVERY SINGLE RESURFACING        

00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:07.901
WE WON&apos;T BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON  
EVERY SINGLE RESURFACING        
PROJECT.                        

00:39:07.903 --> 00:39:08.934
EVERY SINGLE RESURFACING        
PROJECT.                        
AND SO I THINK THE QUESTION FOR 

00:39:08.936 --> 00:39:11.771
PROJECT.                        
AND SO I THINK THE QUESTION FOR 
US THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TEASE  

00:39:11.773 --> 00:39:12.839
AND SO I THINK THE QUESTION FOR 
US THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TEASE  
OUT IS IF THERE IS A LOCATION   

00:39:12.841 --> 00:39:13.573
US THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TEASE  
OUT IS IF THERE IS A LOCATION   
WHERE WE THINK FOR VERTICAL     

00:39:13.575 --> 00:39:16.376
OUT IS IF THERE IS A LOCATION   
WHERE WE THINK FOR VERTICAL     
DEVICES MAKES SENSE BECAUSE     

00:39:16.378 --> 00:39:17.176
WHERE WE THINK FOR VERTICAL     
DEVICES MAKES SENSE BECAUSE     
MAYBE THERE IS A DOCUMENTED     

00:39:17.178 --> 00:39:19.812
DEVICES MAKES SENSE BECAUSE     
MAYBE THERE IS A DOCUMENTED     
SPEEDING PROBLEM.               

00:39:19.814 --> 00:39:20.780
MAYBE THERE IS A DOCUMENTED     
SPEEDING PROBLEM.               
WE KNOW THERE&apos;S SOME OTHER      

00:39:20.782 --> 00:39:21.381
SPEEDING PROBLEM.               
WE KNOW THERE&apos;S SOME OTHER      
ISSUE THAT WE&apos;RE TRYING TO      

00:39:21.383 --> 00:39:23.783
WE KNOW THERE&apos;S SOME OTHER      
ISSUE THAT WE&apos;RE TRYING TO      
SOLVE FOR I THINK IT WOULD UP   

00:39:23.785 --> 00:39:24.851
ISSUE THAT WE&apos;RE TRYING TO      
SOLVE FOR I THINK IT WOULD UP   
TO US TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE      

00:39:24.853 --> 00:39:27.687
SOLVE FOR I THINK IT WOULD UP   
TO US TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE      
COULD GET THE APPROPRIATE LABI  

00:39:27.689 --> 00:39:28.554
TO US TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE      
COULD GET THE APPROPRIATE LABI  
IN FROM THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO    

00:39:28.556 --> 00:39:31.491
COULD GET THE APPROPRIATE LABI  
IN FROM THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO    
INSTALL THAT DEVICE AS PART     

00:39:31.493 --> 00:39:32.591
IN FROM THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO    
INSTALL THAT DEVICE AS PART     
OF A PROJECT TO ENSURE THAT     

00:39:32.593 --> 00:39:36.162
INSTALL THAT DEVICE AS PART     
OF A PROJECT TO ENSURE THAT     
IT&apos;S SUPPORTED PRETTY BROADLY   

00:39:36.164 --> 00:39:39.933
OF A PROJECT TO ENSURE THAT     
IT&apos;S SUPPORTED PRETTY BROADLY   
AND THAT WE DON&apos;T GET PEOPLE    

00:39:39.935 --> 00:39:42.868
IT&apos;S SUPPORTED PRETTY BROADLY   
AND THAT WE DON&apos;T GET PEOPLE    
YOU KNOW, HAVING US TAKE IT OUT 

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:47.474
AND THAT WE DON&apos;T GET PEOPLE    
YOU KNOW, HAVING US TAKE IT OUT 
WITH THIS PARTICULAR RESULT     

00:39:47.476 --> 00:39:51.110

PREREQUISITE THAT A CAPITAL

PREREQUISITE THAT A CAPITAL     
PROJECT HAPPEN OR BE PLANNED    

00:39:58.953 --> 00:39:59.752
PREREQUISITE THAT A CAPITAL     
PROJECT HAPPEN OR BE PLANNED

BEFORE THESE ELEMENTS WOULD BE  
YOU CAN INCORPORATE UNLESS THEY 
ONLY BE INCORPORATED INTO A     

00:40:03.892 --> 00:40:07.360
YOU CAN INCORPORATE UNLESS THEY 
ONLY BE INCORPORATED INTO A     
CAPITAL PROJECT OR CAN THEY     

00:40:07.362 --> 00:40:09.829
ONLY BE INCORPORATED INTO A

00:40:13.334 --> 00:40:14.366
OCCUR OUTSIDE OF A PLANNED      
CAPITAL PROJECT?                
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO    

00:40:14.368 --> 00:40:17.236
CAPITAL PROJECT?                
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO    
DESCRIBE TWO THINGS.            

00:40:17.238 --> 00:40:18.137
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO    
DESCRIBE TWO THINGS.            
SO ONE, THERE&apos;S A PETITION      

00:40:18.139 --> 00:40:22.342
DESCRIBE TWO THINGS.            
SO ONE, THERE&apos;S A PETITION      
PROCESS THAT EXISTS THAT WOULD  

00:40:22.344 --> 00:40:22.875
SO ONE, THERE&apos;S A PETITION      
PROCESS THAT EXISTS THAT WOULD  
CONTINUE TO EXIST.              

00:40:22.877 --> 00:40:25.210
PROCESS THAT EXISTS THAT WOULD  
CONTINUE TO EXIST.              
I THINK THE OTHER PART OF THIS  

00:40:25.212 --> 00:40:26.045
CONTINUE TO EXIST.              
I THINK THE OTHER PART OF THIS  
WAS AND I THINK BY SAYING       

00:40:26.047 --> 00:40:26.779
I THINK THE OTHER PART OF THIS  
WAS AND I THINK BY SAYING       
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS WE 

00:40:26.781 --> 00:40:30.048
WAS AND I THINK BY SAYING       
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS WE 
WERE TRYING TO DISTINGUISH KIND 

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.883
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS WE 
WERE TRYING TO DISTINGUISH KIND 
OF LEVELS OF ROAD TREATMENT     

00:40:30.885 --> 00:40:34.253
WERE TRYING TO DISTINGUISH KIND 
OF LEVELS OF ROAD TREATMENT     
BECAUSE WE DO PRETTY SIMPLE     

00:40:34.255 --> 00:40:35.087
OF LEVELS OF ROAD TREATMENT     
BECAUSE WE DO PRETTY SIMPLE     
SURFACE TREATMENTS, THE NAMES   

00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:37.223
BECAUSE WE DO PRETTY SIMPLE     
SURFACE TREATMENTS, THE NAMES   
OF WHICH I CAN&apos;T REMEMBER WHICH 

00:40:37.225 --> 00:40:38.090
SURFACE TREATMENTS, THE NAMES   
OF WHICH I CAN&apos;T REMEMBER WHICH 
PROBABLY DON&apos;T WARRANT THIS     

00:40:38.092 --> 00:40:41.494
OF WHICH I CAN&apos;T REMEMBER WHICH 
PROBABLY DON&apos;T WARRANT THIS     
LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT AND ADDING  

00:40:41.496 --> 00:40:45.397
PROBABLY DON&apos;T WARRANT THIS     
LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT AND ADDING  
DEVICES.                        

00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:46.465
LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT AND ADDING  
DEVICES.                        
AND SO I THINK THAT WAS REALLY  

00:40:46.467 --> 00:40:47.200
DEVICES.                        
AND SO I THINK THAT WAS REALLY  
THE INTENT OF THAT TO TALK      

00:40:47.202 --> 00:40:49.334
AND SO I THINK THAT WAS REALLY  
THE INTENT OF THAT TO TALK      
ABOUT A SPECTRUM KIND OF ROAD   

00:40:49.336 --> 00:40:50.003
THE INTENT OF THAT TO TALK      
ABOUT A SPECTRUM KIND OF ROAD   
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND WHERE 

00:40:50.005 --> 00:40:52.872
ABOUT A SPECTRUM KIND OF ROAD   
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND WHERE 
IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO      

00:40:52.874 --> 00:40:53.739
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND WHERE 
IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO      
EVALUATE THIS WITHOUT A         

00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:54.073
IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO      
EVALUATE THIS WITHOUT A         
PETITION.                       

00:40:54.075 --> 00:40:57.109
EVALUATE THIS WITHOUT A         
PETITION.                       
&gt;&gt; OK, SO IT&apos;S NOT POSSIBLE

FIRST RESULT WAS REMOVE THE     
REQUIREMENT OF CITY COUNCIL

COMMISSION APPROVAL IS NOT

OR ANOTHER TO COUNCIL.          

00:41:34.415 --> 00:41:35.348
GIVE A RECOMMENDATION ONE WAY   
OR ANOTHER TO COUNCIL.          
DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT STILL    

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:35.681
OR ANOTHER TO COUNCIL.          
DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT STILL    
HAPPENING?                      

00:41:35.683 --> 00:41:37.950
DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT STILL    
HAPPENING?                      
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN      

00:41:37.952 --> 00:41:41.253
HAPPENING?                      
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN      
STILL HAPPEN OR SHOULD YOU      

00:41:41.255 --> 00:41:42.488
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN      
STILL HAPPEN OR SHOULD YOU      
SHOULD ANY OF THESE COME TO US  

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.792
STILL HAPPEN OR SHOULD YOU      
SHOULD ANY OF THESE COME TO US  
FIRST WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT 

00:41:45.794 --> 00:41:46.726
SHOULD ANY OF THESE COME TO US  
FIRST WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT 
IT WOULD MEAN THAT WE DIDN&apos;T    

00:41:46.728 --> 00:41:52.832
FIRST WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT 
IT WOULD MEAN THAT WE DIDN&apos;T    
SEE THESE PROJECTS AND I THINK  

00:41:52.834 --> 00:41:53.533
IT WOULD MEAN THAT WE DIDN&apos;T    
SEE THESE PROJECTS AND I THINK  
THEY STILL COULD BUT IT WOULD   

00:41:53.535 --> 00:41:54.334
SEE THESE PROJECTS AND I THINK  
THEY STILL COULD BUT IT WOULD   
BECOME AN AND IT WOULD BE LIKE  

00:41:54.336 --> 00:41:56.835
THEY STILL COULD BUT IT WOULD   
BECOME AN AND IT WOULD BE LIKE  
AN INFORMATION PIECE OF THE     

00:41:56.837 --> 00:41:57.636
BECOME AN AND IT WOULD BE LIKE  
AN INFORMATION PIECE OF THE     
MEETING AS OPPOSED TO A         

00:41:57.638 --> 00:41:58.304
AN INFORMATION PIECE OF THE     
MEETING AS OPPOSED TO A         
BUSINESS PIECE OF THE MEETING.  

00:41:58.306 --> 00:41:59.138
MEETING AS OPPOSED TO A         
BUSINESS PIECE OF THE MEETING.  
SO THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE     

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:04.209
BUSINESS PIECE OF THE MEETING.  
SO THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE     
SOMETHING FOR US TO VOTE ON BUT 

00:42:04.211 --> 00:42:05.477
SO THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE     
SOMETHING FOR US TO VOTE ON BUT 
YEAH, I MEAN IT WAS SOMETHING I 

00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:06.212
SOMETHING FOR US TO VOTE ON BUT 
YEAH, I MEAN IT WAS SOMETHING I 
WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT    

00:42:06.214 --> 00:42:08.580
YEAH, I MEAN IT WAS SOMETHING I 
WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT    
JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE LIKE WE  

00:42:08.582 --> 00:42:12.151
WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT    
JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE LIKE WE  
ALREADY PRETTY MUCH DON&apos;T SEE   

00:42:12.153 --> 00:42:12.952
JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE LIKE WE  
ALREADY PRETTY MUCH DON&apos;T SEE   
DENHA INITIATED DESIGNS UNTIL   

00:42:12.954 --> 00:42:15.888
ALREADY PRETTY MUCH DON&apos;T SEE   
DENHA INITIATED DESIGNS UNTIL   
UNTIL LIKE FAIT ACCOMPLI        

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:16.255
DENHA INITIATED DESIGNS UNTIL   
UNTIL LIKE FAIT ACCOMPLI        
BASICALLY.                      

00:42:16.257 --> 00:42:19.525
UNTIL LIKE FAIT ACCOMPLI        
BASICALLY.                      
AND SO TO REMOVE ANOTHER BATCH  

00:42:19.527 --> 00:42:20.393
BASICALLY.                      
AND SO TO REMOVE ANOTHER BATCH  
OF THINGS FROM WHAT WE WOULD

OF THINGS FROM WHAT WE WOULD    
HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE AND GET    

00:42:21.328 --> 00:42:24.130
OF THINGS FROM WHAT WE WOULD    
HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE AND GET    
FEEDBACK ON BUT I THINK WE      

00:42:24.132 --> 00:42:27.567
HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE AND GET    
FEEDBACK ON BUT I THINK WE      
ALWAYS APPROVE THEM.            

00:42:27.569 --> 00:42:28.501
FEEDBACK ON BUT I THINK WE      
ALWAYS APPROVE THEM.            
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S EVER BEEN 

00:42:28.503 --> 00:42:30.803
ALWAYS APPROVE THEM.            
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S EVER BEEN 
A TRAFFIC COMING PROPOSAL THAT  

00:42:30.805 --> 00:42:35.408
I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S EVER BEEN 
A TRAFFIC COMING PROPOSAL THAT

THE COMMISSION.                 
AND SO THAT&apos;S ALSO A SIGN TO ME 
THAT WE PROBABLY DON&apos;T THIS     

00:42:38.813 --> 00:42:39.512
AND SO THAT&apos;S ALSO A SIGN TO ME 
THAT WE PROBABLY DON&apos;T THIS     
ISN&apos;T NECESSARY AS AN OVERSIGHT 

00:42:39.514 --> 00:42:39.845
THAT WE PROBABLY DON&apos;T THIS     
ISN&apos;T NECESSARY AS AN OVERSIGHT 
STEP.                           

00:42:39.847 --> 00:42:42.581
ISN&apos;T NECESSARY AS AN OVERSIGHT 
STEP.                           
IT REALLY JUST WOULD ABOUT

00:46:35.283 --> 00:46:36.481
IMMEDIATELY OR IS THIS AGAIN    
WHEN THERE&apos;S A CAPITAL PROJECT  
AND THE IDEA WAS WHEN THERE&apos;S A 

00:46:36.483 --> 00:46:39.951
WHEN THERE&apos;S A CAPITAL PROJECT  
AND THE IDEA WAS WHEN THERE&apos;S A 
CAPITAL SO LIKE WHEN YEAH.      

00:46:39.953 --> 00:46:44.256
AND THE IDEA WAS WHEN THERE&apos;S A 
CAPITAL SO LIKE WHEN YEAH.      
THIS IS PART OF THE WHOLE LIKE  

00:46:44.258 --> 00:46:47.326
CAPITAL SO LIKE WHEN YEAH.      
THIS IS PART OF THE WHOLE LIKE  
WHEN WE&apos;RE TOUCHING A STREET WE 

00:46:47.328 --> 00:46:48.127
THIS IS PART OF THE WHOLE LIKE  
WHEN WE&apos;RE TOUCHING A STREET WE 
SHOULD BE INSTALLING ABOUT THAT 

00:46:48.129 --> 00:46:50.362
WHEN WE&apos;RE TOUCHING A STREET WE 
SHOULD BE INSTALLING ABOUT THAT 
BUT THAT&apos;S OK AND THAT MIGHT BE 

00:46:50.364 --> 00:46:51.196
SHOULD BE INSTALLING ABOUT THAT 
BUT THAT&apos;S OK AND THAT MIGHT BE 
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CLARIFY   

00:46:51.198 --> 00:46:55.034
BUT THAT&apos;S OK AND THAT MIGHT BE 
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CLARIFY   
IN THAT IN THAT LANGUAGE        

00:46:55.036 --> 00:46:55.968
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CLARIFY   
IN THAT IN THAT LANGUAGE        
BECAUSE A SECOND SENTENCE IS    

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.371
IN THAT IN THAT LANGUAGE        
BECAUSE A SECOND SENTENCE IS    
JUST CONSIDER THEM BUT THAT&apos;S   

00:46:58.373 --> 00:46:59.105
BECAUSE A SECOND SENTENCE IS    
JUST CONSIDER THEM BUT THAT&apos;S   
THAT&apos;S FOR STREETSCAPE          

00:46:59.107 --> 00:46:59.438
JUST CONSIDER THEM BUT THAT&apos;S   
THAT&apos;S FOR STREETSCAPE          
PROJECTS.                       

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.172
THAT&apos;S FOR STREETSCAPE          
PROJECTS.                       
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A SEPARATE    

00:47:00.174 --> 00:47:03.208
PROJECTS.                       
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A SEPARATE    
THING, IS THAT RIGHT?           

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:03.742
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF A SEPARATE    
THING, IS THAT RIGHT?           
I THINK SO.                     

00:47:03.744 --> 00:47:04.810
THING, IS THAT RIGHT?           
I THINK SO.                     
BUT I&apos;M GOING TO HAND OUT MY    

00:47:04.812 --> 00:47:10.950
I THINK SO.                     
BUT I&apos;M GOING TO HAND OUT MY    
ANSWER THAT                     

00:47:23.597 --> 00:47:26.298
            OK?                 
I DON&apos;T THINK SO.               
I GUESS I DON&apos;T KNOW WHERE      

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:26.899
I DON&apos;T THINK SO.               
I GUESS I DON&apos;T KNOW WHERE      
STREETSCAPE CAME IN.            

00:47:26.901 --> 00:47:27.566
I GUESS I DON&apos;T KNOW WHERE      
STREETSCAPE CAME IN.            
I THINK IT&apos;S JUST CAPITAL       

00:47:27.568 --> 00:47:28.167
STREETSCAPE CAME IN.            
I THINK IT&apos;S JUST CAPITAL       
IMPROVEMENTS THREE PROJECTS     

00:47:28.169 --> 00:47:28.968
I THINK IT&apos;S JUST CAPITAL       
IMPROVEMENTS THREE PROJECTS     
BECAUSE RIGHT THERE JUST AS D   

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:29.635
IMPROVEMENTS THREE PROJECTS     
BECAUSE RIGHT THERE JUST AS D   
CONSIDERED SO THAT KIND OF A    

00:47:29.637 --> 00:47:30.436
BECAUSE RIGHT THERE JUST AS D   
CONSIDERED SO THAT KIND OF A    
ALIGNS WITH THE SUGGESTED EDIT  

00:47:30.438 --> 00:47:30.635
CONSIDERED SO THAT KIND OF A    
ALIGNS WITH THE SUGGESTED EDIT  
.                               

00:47:30.637 --> 00:47:32.037
ALIGNS WITH THE SUGGESTED EDIT  
.                               
SO IF IT SEEMS LIKE THERE&apos;S A   

00:47:32.039 --> 00:47:32.771
.                               
SO IF IT SEEMS LIKE THERE&apos;S A   
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THOSE TWO   

00:47:32.773 --> 00:47:33.973
SO IF IT SEEMS LIKE THERE&apos;S A   
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THOSE TWO   
SENTENCES AND AS C STANDS AM I  

00:47:33.975 --> 00:47:36.775
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THOSE TWO   
SENTENCES AND AS C STANDS AM I  
I THINK IT&apos;S BY DEFAULT ON      

00:47:36.777 --> 00:47:37.509
SENTENCES AND AS C STANDS AM I  
I THINK IT&apos;S BY DEFAULT ON      
STREETS WITH ON STREET PARKING  

00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:40.713
I THINK IT&apos;S BY DEFAULT ON      
STREETS WITH ON STREET PARKING  
CONSIDERED ON EVERY MAJOR       

00:47:40.715 --> 00:47:44.816
STREETS WITH ON STREET PARKING  
CONSIDERED ON EVERY MAJOR       
THINGY WHETHER OR NOT ON STREET 

00:47:44.818 --> 00:47:45.518
CONSIDERED ON EVERY MAJOR       
THINGY WHETHER OR NOT ON STREET 
PARKING I THINK THAT&apos;S THE      

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.453
THINGY WHETHER OR NOT ON STREET 
PARKING I THINK THAT&apos;S THE      
SECOND WHAT THE SECOND SENTENCE 

00:47:47.455 --> 00:47:51.990
PARKING I THINK THAT&apos;S THE      
SECOND WHAT THE SECOND SENTENCE 
IS GETTING AT THAT WRONG?       

00:47:51.992 --> 00:47:55.761
SECOND WHAT THE SECOND SENTENCE 
IS GETTING AT THAT WRONG?       
YEAH I THINK OK.                

00:47:55.763 --> 00:47:56.795
IS GETTING AT THAT WRONG?       
YEAH I THINK OK.                
I THINK BASICALLY WHEN I WROTE  

00:47:56.797 --> 00:47:59.965
YEAH I THINK OK.                
I THINK BASICALLY WHEN I WROTE  
THIS I THOUGHT MY ORIGINAL      

00:47:59.967 --> 00:48:02.601
I THINK BASICALLY WHEN I WROTE  
THIS I THOUGHT MY ORIGINAL      
PIECE GAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT 

00:48:02.603 --> 00:48:03.535
THIS I THOUGHT MY ORIGINAL      
PIECE GAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT 
I THINK THERE ARE STILL         

00:48:03.537 --> 00:48:04.170
PIECE GAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT 
I THINK THERE ARE STILL         
SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT YOU     

00:48:04.172 --> 00:48:06.572
I THINK THERE ARE STILL         
SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT YOU     
KNOW, I UNDERSTAND IT&apos;S         

00:48:06.574 --> 00:48:07.373
SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT YOU     
KNOW, I UNDERSTAND IT&apos;S         
PROBABLY STILL COMING ACROSS AS 

00:48:07.375 --> 00:48:07.907
KNOW, I UNDERSTAND IT&apos;S         
PROBABLY STILL COMING ACROSS AS 
REALLY PRESCRIPTIVE.            

00:48:07.909 --> 00:48:12.378
PROBABLY STILL COMING ACROSS AS 
REALLY PRESCRIPTIVE.            
SO MY READ ON THIS IS THAT      

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.514
REALLY PRESCRIPTIVE.            
SO MY READ ON THIS IS THAT      
MAYBE THERE&apos;S SOME DUPLICATION  

00:48:15.516 --> 00:48:16.348
SO MY READ ON THIS IS THAT      
MAYBE THERE&apos;S SOME DUPLICATION  
IN THE REVISED VERSION BUT I    

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.115
MAYBE THERE&apos;S SOME DUPLICATION  
IN THE REVISED VERSION BUT I    
THINK IT TRIES TO GET THE SAME  

00:48:17.117 --> 00:48:18.584
IN THE REVISED VERSION BUT I    
THINK IT TRIES TO GET THE SAME  
THING WHICH IS ALLOWING STAFF   

00:48:18.586 --> 00:48:19.451
THINK IT TRIES TO GET THE SAME  
THING WHICH IS ALLOWING STAFF   
DISCRETION BASED ON THOSE       

00:48:19.453 --> 00:48:22.721
THING WHICH IS ALLOWING STAFF   
DISCRETION BASED ON THOSE       
THINGS.                         

00:48:22.723 --> 00:48:23.689
DISCRETION BASED ON THOSE       
THINGS.                         
CONSIDER IT BUT BALANCE THIS    

00:48:23.691 --> 00:48:24.356
THINGS.                         
CONSIDER IT BUT BALANCE THIS    
BALANCE THESE THINGS AND I      

00:48:24.358 --> 00:48:26.692
CONSIDER IT BUT BALANCE THIS    
BALANCE THESE THINGS AND I      
THINK THAT WE STRUGGLED WITH    

00:48:26.694 --> 00:48:27.626
BALANCE THESE THINGS AND I      
THINK THAT WE STRUGGLED WITH    
THE FACT THAT I THINK THAT      

00:48:27.628 --> 00:48:30.696
THINK THAT WE STRUGGLED WITH    
THE FACT THAT I THINK THAT      
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO LIKE IN THE WAY 

00:48:30.698 --> 00:48:31.630
THE FACT THAT I THINK THAT      
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO LIKE IN THE WAY 
OUR WHOLE PROJECT HERE HAS BEEN 

00:48:31.632 --> 00:48:35.267
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO LIKE IN THE WAY 
OUR WHOLE PROJECT HERE HAS BEEN 
A REACTION TO THE OVERLY KIND   

00:48:35.269 --> 00:48:36.001
OUR WHOLE PROJECT HERE HAS BEEN 
A REACTION TO THE OVERLY KIND   
OF PRESCRIPTIVE OVERSIGHT       

00:48:36.003 --> 00:48:38.337
A REACTION TO THE OVERLY KIND   
OF PRESCRIPTIVE OVERSIGHT       
NATURE OF THE CURRENT TRAFFIC   

00:48:38.339 --> 00:48:39.137
OF PRESCRIPTIVE OVERSIGHT       
NATURE OF THE CURRENT TRAFFIC   
CALMING AND THEN LIKE I THINK   

00:48:39.139 --> 00:48:42.107
NATURE OF THE CURRENT TRAFFIC   
CALMING AND THEN LIKE I THINK   
THAT WE REALIZED IN SOME WAYS   

00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.708
CALMING AND THEN LIKE I THINK   
THAT WE REALIZED IN SOME WAYS   
ARE SPEAKING FOR MYSELF.        

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:43.442
THAT WE REALIZED IN SOME WAYS   
ARE SPEAKING FOR MYSELF.        
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES WE WERE  

00:48:43.444 --> 00:48:46.945
ARE SPEAKING FOR MYSELF.        
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES WE WERE  
TRYING TO SIMILARLY BE VERY     

00:48:46.947 --> 00:48:47.313
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES WE WERE  
TRYING TO SIMILARLY BE VERY     
PRESCRIPTIVE.                   

00:48:47.315 --> 00:48:50.449
TRYING TO SIMILARLY BE VERY     
PRESCRIPTIVE.                   
SO I I THINK THAT MAYBE THERE&apos;S 

00:48:50.451 --> 00:48:51.116
PRESCRIPTIVE.                   
SO I I THINK THAT MAYBE THERE&apos;S 
SOME WORD SOMETHING THAT COULD  

00:48:51.118 --> 00:48:51.517
SO I I THINK THAT MAYBE THERE&apos;S 
SOME WORD SOMETHING THAT COULD  
HAPPEN.                         

00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:52.618
SOME WORD SOMETHING THAT COULD  
HAPPEN.                         
BUT I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL     

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:53.552
HAPPEN.                         
BUT I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL     
THING WAS GIVING STAFF SOME     

00:48:53.554 --> 00:48:55.621
BUT I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL     
THING WAS GIVING STAFF SOME     
DISCRETION.                     

00:48:55.623 --> 00:48:59.892
THING WAS GIVING STAFF SOME     
DISCRETION.                     
PETER.                          

00:48:59.894 --> 00:49:00.826
DISCRETION.                     
PETER.                          
SO OUR OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN  

00:49:00.828 --> 00:49:04.396
PETER.                          
SO OUR OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN  
SAYS BUMP OUTS SHOULD BE        

00:49:04.398 --> 00:49:04.996
SO OUR OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN  
SAYS BUMP OUTS SHOULD BE        
CONSIDERED IN CAPITAL           

00:49:04.998 --> 00:49:07.866
SAYS BUMP OUTS SHOULD BE        
CONSIDERED IN CAPITAL           
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS PLANNING   

00:49:07.868 --> 00:49:08.467
CONSIDERED IN CAPITAL           
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS PLANNING   
STREETSCAPE PROJECTS.           

00:49:08.469 --> 00:49:12.104
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS PLANNING   
STREETSCAPE PROJECTS.           
THAT&apos;S ONE BULLET POINT AND     

00:49:12.106 --> 00:49:12.838
STREETSCAPE PROJECTS.           
THAT&apos;S ONE BULLET POINT AND     
THEN IMPLEMENT A POLICY TO      

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.575
THAT&apos;S ONE BULLET POINT AND     
THEN IMPLEMENT A POLICY TO      
INSTALL BUMP OUTS BY DEFAULT ON

STREETS WITH ON STREET PARKING  
.                               
SO THAT IS IN THE PLAN THAT     

00:49:20.715 --> 00:49:23.783
.

TO PUT IN SOME SOME WAY TO DEAL 
WITH A PARTICULAR HARD ROCK, WE 
HAVE A PLACE WHERE I BUMP OUT   

00:49:44.004 --> 00:49:46.906
WITH A PARTICULAR HARD ROCK, WE 
HAVE A PLACE WHERE I BUMP OUT   
JUST ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT WORK   

00:49:46.908 --> 00:49:50.709
HAVE A PLACE WHERE I BUMP OUT   
JUST ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT WORK   
OR WILL BE TOO EXPENSIVE THEN   

00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:51.811
JUST ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT WORK   
OR WILL BE TOO EXPENSIVE THEN   
LET&apos;S COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR   

00:49:51.813 --> 00:49:54.146
OR WILL BE TOO EXPENSIVE THEN   
LET&apos;S COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR   
DEVIATING FROM OUR DEFAULT

THE SITUATION WHERE WE          
DEFINITELY CAN&apos;T HAVE ONE FOR

THE SITUATION WHERE WE          
DEFINITELY CAN&apos;T HAVE ONE FOR   
SOME SPECIAL REASON AND AND

DEFINITELY CAN&apos;T HAVE ONE FOR   
SOME SPECIAL REASON AND AND     
LEAVE THIS LANGUAGE AS IT IS SO

LOOK LIKE BUT FOR EXAMPLE, IT   

00:50:18.639 --> 00:50:21.506
I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD    
LOOK LIKE BUT FOR EXAMPLE, IT   
MIGHT BE THAT IN THAT CASE WE   

00:50:21.508 --> 00:50:24.676
LOOK LIKE BUT FOR EXAMPLE, IT   
MIGHT BE THAT IN THAT CASE WE

EASY TO SAY EVERY TIME.         
MAY I ALSO ADD WE&apos;RE SORT       
OF TALKING ABOUT TWO REASONS    

00:58:17.384 --> 00:58:17.983
MAY I ALSO ADD WE&apos;RE SORT

TWO DIFFERENT REASONS WHY WE

OF TALKING ABOUT TWO REASONS    
TWO DIFFERENT REASONS WHY WE    
WOULDN&apos;T WANT A BUMP OUT.       

00:58:18.652 --> 00:58:19.518
TWO DIFFERENT REASONS WHY WE    
WOULDN&apos;T WANT A BUMP OUT.       
DAMAR BROUGHT UP THE IDEA THAT  

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.118
WOULDN&apos;T WANT A BUMP OUT.       
DAMAR BROUGHT UP THE IDEA THAT  
SOME STREETS DON&apos;T NEED THEM    

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:20.585
DAMAR BROUGHT UP THE IDEA THAT  
SOME STREETS DON&apos;T NEED THEM    
LIKE STREET.                    

00:58:20.587 --> 00:58:21.920
SOME STREETS DON&apos;T NEED THEM    
LIKE STREET.                    
SO THAT IS WHY WE NEED A FLOOR. 

00:58:21.922 --> 00:58:22.120
LIKE STREET.                    
SO THAT IS WHY WE NEED A FLOOR. 
RIGHT.                          

00:58:22.122 --> 00:58:23.054
SO THAT IS WHY WE NEED A FLOOR. 
RIGHT.                          
BUT THERE ARE THERE COULD BE    

00:58:23.056 --> 00:58:23.789
RIGHT.                          
BUT THERE ARE THERE COULD BE    
ANOTHER THERE COULD BE OTHER    

00:58:23.791 --> 00:58:24.456
BUT THERE ARE THERE COULD BE    
ANOTHER THERE COULD BE OTHER    
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT      

00:58:24.458 --> 00:58:25.223
ANOTHER THERE COULD BE OTHER    
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT      
MIGHT, LIKE YOU SAID, FALL INTO 

00:58:25.225 --> 00:58:25.924
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT      
MIGHT, LIKE YOU SAID, FALL INTO 
THE CASE OF IT&apos;S TOO EXPENSIVE  

00:58:25.926 --> 00:58:27.992
MIGHT, LIKE YOU SAID, FALL INTO 
THE CASE OF IT&apos;S TOO EXPENSIVE  
FOR THE TOPOLOGY DOESN&apos;T        

00:58:27.994 --> 00:58:32.030
THE CASE OF IT&apos;S TOO EXPENSIVE  
FOR THE TOPOLOGY DOESN&apos;T

SUPPORT IT OR FOR SOME REASON   
LIKE THAT.                      
I THINK IT&apos;S OK TO HAVE AN OFF  

00:58:36.436 --> 00:58:39.070
LIKE THAT.                      
I THINK IT&apos;S OK TO HAVE AN OFF  
RAMP TO THIS FOR THOSE THAT WE  

00:58:39.072 --> 00:58:43.408
I THINK IT&apos;S OK TO HAVE AN OFF

CAN TAKE UNDER THOSE            

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:44.209

CAN TAKE UNDER THOSE            
CIRCUMSTANCES, SOME OF WHICH WE 
HAVEN&apos;T EVEN THOUGHT OF YET BUT 

00:58:47.514 --> 00:58:48.513
CIRCUMSTANCES, SOME OF WHICH WE 
HAVEN&apos;T EVEN THOUGHT OF YET BUT 
FOR ME ASKING FOR APPROVAL TO

FOR ME ASKING FOR APPROVAL TO   
USE THE OFF RAMP INSTEAD        
OF ASKING FOR APPROVAL TO PUT   

00:58:51.751 --> 00:58:55.186
USE THE OFF RAMP INSTEAD        
OF ASKING FOR APPROVAL TO PUT   
IN BUMP OUTS IS THE WAY THAT WE 

00:58:55.188 --> 00:58:55.787
OF ASKING FOR APPROVAL TO PUT   
IN BUMP OUTS IS THE WAY THAT WE 
SHOULD BE DOING IT.             

00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:56.555
IN BUMP OUTS IS THE WAY THAT WE 
SHOULD BE DOING IT.             
THAT&apos;S WHAT IT MEANS TO ME TO   

00:58:56.557 --> 00:58:58.856
SHOULD BE DOING IT.             
THAT&apos;S WHAT IT MEANS TO ME TO

SO IF WE IF WE HAVE TO BUILD IN 

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:03.261
BE BY DEFAULT.                  
SO IF WE IF WE HAVE TO BUILD IN 
THIS OFF RAMP IT GETS USED VERY 

00:59:03.263 --> 00:59:03.862
SO IF WE IF WE HAVE TO BUILD IN 
THIS OFF RAMP IT GETS USED VERY 
RARELY FOR REALLY UNUSUAL

STREET RESURFACING PROGRAM AND  
SO MAJOR STREETS LIKE I SAID    
BEFORE, I&apos;M GOING TO DISCUSS    

01:29:22.948 --> 01:29:23.814
SO MAJOR STREETS LIKE I SAID    
BEFORE, I&apos;M GOING TO DISCUSS    
TOO MUCH OF THAT HERE BUT THOSE

01:29:39.264 --> 01:29:40.263
BUCKET OR IN OUR CAPITAL        
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE AND    
THOSE ARE THE TWO WAYS THAT WE  

01:29:40.265 --> 01:29:42.532
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE AND    
THOSE ARE THE TWO WAYS THAT WE  
IMPLEMENT MOST OF THOSE         

01:29:42.534 --> 01:29:42.899
THOSE ARE THE TWO WAYS THAT WE  
IMPLEMENT MOST OF THOSE         
PROJECTS.                       

01:29:42.901 --> 01:29:46.169
IMPLEMENT MOST OF THOSE         
PROJECTS.                       
SO RESURFACING OF A STREET IS   

01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:46.836
PROJECTS.                       
SO RESURFACING OF A STREET IS   
TYPICALLY SOMETHING THAT&apos;S      

01:29:46.838 --> 01:29:47.637
SO RESURFACING OF A STREET IS   
TYPICALLY SOMETHING THAT&apos;S      
CONTAINED WITHIN THE EXISTING   

01:29:47.639 --> 01:29:48.038
TYPICALLY SOMETHING THAT&apos;S      
CONTAINED WITHIN THE EXISTING   
ROAD FOOTPRINT.                 

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.506
CONTAINED WITHIN THE EXISTING   
ROAD FOOTPRINT.                 
SO WE&apos;RE NOT GENERALLY DOING    

01:29:50.508 --> 01:29:54.377
ROAD FOOTPRINT.                 
SO WE&apos;RE NOT GENERALLY DOING    
ANY MAJOR HUGE CHANGES.         

01:29:54.379 --> 01:29:55.278
SO WE&apos;RE NOT GENERALLY DOING    
ANY MAJOR HUGE CHANGES.         
IT&apos;S NOT A RECONSTRUCTION.      

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.314
ANY MAJOR HUGE CHANGES.         
IT&apos;S NOT A RECONSTRUCTION.      
WE&apos;RE NOT WIDENING.             

01:29:58.316 --> 01:29:59.449
IT&apos;S NOT A RECONSTRUCTION.      
WE&apos;RE NOT WIDENING.             
YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S MOSTLY A PROGRAM 

01:29:59.451 --> 01:30:02.351
WE&apos;RE NOT WIDENING.             
YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S MOSTLY A PROGRAM 
THAT IS DESIGNED AROUND         

01:30:02.353 --> 01:30:03.152
YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S MOSTLY A PROGRAM 
THAT IS DESIGNED AROUND         
IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF THAT 

01:30:03.154 --> 01:30:05.788
THAT IS DESIGNED AROUND         
IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF THAT 
PAYMENT DATA COLLECTION ON      

01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:10.059
IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF THAT 
PAYMENT DATA COLLECTION ON      
THOSE IS MINIMAL WHERE WE&apos;RE    

01:30:10.061 --> 01:30:13.930
PAYMENT DATA COLLECTION ON      
THOSE IS MINIMAL WHERE WE&apos;RE    
TYPICALLY NOT DOING ANYTHING    

01:30:13.932 --> 01:30:14.631
THOSE IS MINIMAL WHERE WE&apos;RE    
TYPICALLY NOT DOING ANYTHING    
MAJOR LIKE TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS  

01:30:14.633 --> 01:30:17.634
TYPICALLY NOT DOING ANYTHING    
MAJOR LIKE TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS  
OR THINGS LIKE THAT.            

01:30:17.636 --> 01:30:18.834
MAJOR LIKE TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS  
OR THINGS LIKE THAT.            
THERE&apos;S A LITTLE BIT DISCUSSION 

01:30:18.836 --> 01:30:19.302
OR THINGS LIKE THAT.            
THERE&apos;S A LITTLE BIT DISCUSSION 
OF THIS EARLIER.                

01:30:19.304 --> 01:30:22.004
THERE&apos;S A LITTLE BIT DISCUSSION 
OF THIS EARLIER.                
SO I WILL MENTION THAT          

01:30:22.006 --> 01:30:25.075
OF THIS EARLIER.                
SO I WILL MENTION THAT          
TYPICALLY WE&apos;RE NOT COLLECTING  

01:30:25.077 --> 01:30:26.008
SO I WILL MENTION THAT          
TYPICALLY WE&apos;RE NOT COLLECTING  
STREET VOLUME OR SPEED DATA ON  

01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:26.876
TYPICALLY WE&apos;RE NOT COLLECTING  
STREET VOLUME OR SPEED DATA ON  
THESE STREETS MOST OF THE TIME  

01:30:26.878 --> 01:30:29.212
STREET VOLUME OR SPEED DATA ON  
THESE STREETS MOST OF THE TIME  
RIGHT NOW AND THEN THE DESIGN   

01:30:29.214 --> 01:30:29.746
THESE STREETS MOST OF THE TIME  
RIGHT NOW AND THEN THE DESIGN   
WORK IS ALSO MINIMAL.           

01:30:29.748 --> 01:30:32.448
RIGHT NOW AND THEN THE DESIGN   
WORK IS ALSO MINIMAL.           
THERE&apos;S VERY LITTLE ENGINEERING 

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:32.782
WORK IS ALSO MINIMAL.           
THERE&apos;S VERY LITTLE ENGINEERING 
WORK.                           

01:30:32.784 --> 01:30:36.252
THERE&apos;S VERY LITTLE ENGINEERING 
WORK.                           
WE PUT TOGETHER A SET OF PLANS  

01:30:36.254 --> 01:30:36.586
WORK.                           
WE PUT TOGETHER A SET OF PLANS  
.                               

01:30:36.588 --> 01:30:37.253
WE PUT TOGETHER A SET OF PLANS  
.                               
THERE&apos;S SOMETHING THAT THE      

01:30:37.255 --> 01:30:40.423
.                               
THERE&apos;S SOMETHING THAT THE      
CONTRACTOR CAN BID ON BUT WE    

01:30:40.425 --> 01:30:41.424
THERE&apos;S SOMETHING THAT THE      
CONTRACTOR CAN BID ON BUT WE    
DON&apos;T SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOING 

01:30:41.426 --> 01:30:41.825
CONTRACTOR CAN BID ON BUT WE    
DON&apos;T SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOING 
DESIGN.                         

01:30:41.827 --> 01:30:44.761
DON&apos;T SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOING 
DESIGN.                         
SO ALL OF THAT HELPS KEEP SOME  

01:30:44.763 --> 01:30:45.661
DESIGN.                         
SO ALL OF THAT HELPS KEEP SOME  
OF THE COSTS DOWN AS WELL AND   

01:30:45.663 --> 01:30:48.697
SO ALL OF THAT HELPS KEEP SOME  
OF THE COSTS DOWN AS WELL AND   
THEN WE&apos;RE TYPICALLY NOT        

01:30:48.699 --> 01:30:49.366
OF THE COSTS DOWN AS WELL AND   
THEN WE&apos;RE TYPICALLY NOT        
OBTAINING ANY ADDITIONAL RIGHT  

01:30:49.368 --> 01:30:52.702

GUESS I&apos;M WONDERING ABOUT CURB  
REPLACEMENTS AND WE WORK ON THE 

01:39:08.733 --> 01:39:14.269
GUESS I&apos;M WONDERING ABOUT CURB  
REPLACEMENTS AND WE WORK ON THE 
STREETS LIKE THIS AND HOW DO WE 

01:39:14.271 --> 01:39:21.110
REPLACEMENTS AND WE WORK ON THE 
STREETS LIKE THIS AND HOW DO WE 
KNOW WHEN A PIECE OF CURB IS    

01:39:34.958 --> 01:39:37.026
                             SO 
FAR GONE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE    
REPLACED BACK THERE?            

01:39:37.028 --> 01:39:38.027
FAR GONE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE    
REPLACED BACK THERE?            
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE&apos;S NOT THERE&apos;S    

01:39:38.029 --> 01:39:38.895
REPLACED BACK THERE?            
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE&apos;S NOT THERE&apos;S    
NOT THERE&apos;S NOT A SPEC PER SAY.

NOT THERE&apos;S NOT A SPEC PER SAY. 
IT&apos;S GENERALLY OUR OUR OUR

NOT THERE&apos;S NOT A SPEC PER SAY. 
IT&apos;S GENERALLY OUR OUR OUR      
TECHNICIANS THAT ARE COLLECTING 

01:39:40.431 --> 01:39:41.297
IT&apos;S GENERALLY OUR OUR OUR      
TECHNICIANS THAT ARE COLLECTING 
DATA IN THE FIELD REVIEW THOSE  

01:39:41.299 --> 01:39:41.964
TECHNICIANS THAT ARE COLLECTING 
DATA IN THE FIELD REVIEW THOSE  
THINGS TO TRY TO DETERMINE HOW  

01:39:41.966 --> 01:39:42.699
DATA IN THE FIELD REVIEW THOSE  
THINGS TO TRY TO DETERMINE HOW  
MUCH CURVE WE NEED TO REPLACE.  

01:39:42.701 --> 01:39:43.665
THINGS TO TRY TO DETERMINE HOW  
MUCH CURVE WE NEED TO REPLACE.  
WE TRY TO LIMIT HOW MUCH WE DO  

01:39:43.667 --> 01:39:44.400
MUCH CURVE WE NEED TO REPLACE.  
WE TRY TO LIMIT HOW MUCH WE DO  
BECAUSE IT DOES ADD A LOT       

01:39:44.402 --> 01:39:45.167
WE TRY TO LIMIT HOW MUCH WE DO  
BECAUSE IT DOES ADD A LOT       
OF EXPENSE TO THE PROJECT IF WE 

01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.835
BECAUSE IT DOES ADD A LOT       
OF EXPENSE TO THE PROJECT IF WE 
DO A LOT OF THE CURB TYPICALLY  

01:39:45.837 --> 01:39:46.569
OF EXPENSE TO THE PROJECT IF WE 
DO A LOT OF THE CURB TYPICALLY  
WHAT WE&apos;RE LOOKING FOR IS IF    

01:39:46.571 --> 01:39:49.572
DO A LOT OF THE CURB TYPICALLY  
WHAT WE&apos;RE LOOKING FOR IS IF    
CURB HAS BEEN MOVED, IF IT&apos;S    

01:39:49.574 --> 01:39:50.506
WHAT WE&apos;RE LOOKING FOR IS IF    
CURB HAS BEEN MOVED, IF IT&apos;S    
SETTLED, IF IT&apos;S BEEN LIFTED    

01:39:50.508 --> 01:39:51.240
CURB HAS BEEN MOVED, IF IT&apos;S    
SETTLED, IF IT&apos;S BEEN LIFTED    
OUT OF PLACE BY TREE ROOTS AND  

01:39:51.242 --> 01:39:53.376
SETTLED, IF IT&apos;S BEEN LIFTED    
OUT OF PLACE BY TREE ROOTS AND  
ON OCCASION THAT HAPPENS THE    

01:39:53.378 --> 01:39:57.213
OUT OF PLACE BY TREE ROOTS AND  
ON OCCASION THAT HAPPENS THE    
PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE HERB IS  

01:39:57.215 --> 01:39:57.947
ON OCCASION THAT HAPPENS THE    
PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE HERB IS  
TO KEEP WATER FLOWING.          

01:39:57.949 --> 01:40:01.550
PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE HERB IS  
TO KEEP WATER FLOWING.          
IT COLLECTS WATER OFF THE ROAD  

01:40:01.552 --> 01:40:02.351
TO KEEP WATER FLOWING.          
IT COLLECTS WATER OFF THE ROAD  
AND THEN GETS IT TO THE STORM.  

01:40:02.353 --> 01:40:04.787
IT COLLECTS WATER OFF THE ROAD  
AND THEN GETS IT TO THE STORM.  
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE     

01:40:04.789 --> 01:40:05.788
AND THEN GETS IT TO THE STORM.  
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE     
THAT THAT THERE&apos;S NOT GOING TO  

01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:06.522
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE     
THAT THAT THERE&apos;S NOT GOING TO  
BE ANY PONDING ISSUES AND       

01:40:06.524 --> 01:40:09.024
THAT THAT THERE&apos;S NOT GOING TO  
BE ANY PONDING ISSUES AND       
THINGS LIKE THAT.               

01:40:09.026 --> 01:40:09.992
BE ANY PONDING ISSUES AND       
THINGS LIKE THAT.               
SO THAT&apos;S SOME OF THE PRIMARY   

01:40:09.994 --> 01:40:12.227
THINGS LIKE THAT.               
SO THAT&apos;S SOME OF THE PRIMARY   
REASON WHY WE REPLACE CURB ON   

01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.795
SO THAT&apos;S SOME OF THE PRIMARY   
REASON WHY WE REPLACE CURB ON   
SOME OF THESE RESURFACING       

01:40:12.797 --> 01:40:13.262
REASON WHY WE REPLACE CURB ON   
SOME OF THESE RESURFACING       
PROJECTS.                       

01:40:13.264 --> 01:40:16.365
SOME OF THESE RESURFACING       
PROJECTS.                       
AND THEN THERE IS THE CASE IN   

01:40:16.367 --> 01:40:17.033
PROJECTS.                       
AND THEN THERE IS THE CASE IN   
SOME CASES THAT FURBIES         

01:40:17.035 --> 01:40:20.169
AND THEN THERE IS THE CASE IN   
SOME CASES THAT FURBIES         
DETERIORATED SO BADLY THAT JUST 

01:40:20.171 --> 01:40:20.970
SOME CASES THAT FURBIES         
DETERIORATED SO BADLY THAT JUST 
NEEDS TO REPLACE REGARDLESS     

01:40:20.972 --> 01:40:21.637
DETERIORATED SO BADLY THAT JUST 
NEEDS TO REPLACE REGARDLESS     
OF WHETHER IT&apos;S SETTLED OR      

01:40:21.639 --> 01:40:24.140
NEEDS TO REPLACE REGARDLESS     
OF WHETHER IT&apos;S SETTLED OR      
MOVED OR WHAT.                  

01:40:24.142 --> 01:40:25.441
OF WHETHER IT&apos;S SETTLED OR      
MOVED OR WHAT.                  
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S KIND OF A JUDGMENT   

01:40:25.443 --> 01:40:28.277
MOVED OR WHAT.                  
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S KIND OF A JUDGMENT   
CALL.                           

01:40:28.279 --> 01:40:29.344
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S KIND OF A JUDGMENT   
CALL.                           
OK, I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO     

01:40:29.346 --> 01:40:31.080
CALL.                           
OK, I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO     
ADVOCATE FOR A MORE             

01:40:31.082 --> 01:40:31.748
OK, I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO     
ADVOCATE FOR A MORE             
PRESCRIPTIVE SPECIFICATION WHEN 

01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:32.548
ADVOCATE FOR A MORE             
PRESCRIPTIVE SPECIFICATION WHEN 
IT COMES TO REPLACING CURBS AND 

01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:36.052
PRESCRIPTIVE SPECIFICATION WHEN 
IT COMES TO REPLACING CURBS AND 
THIS MY POINT OF VIEW HERE IS   

01:40:36.054 --> 01:40:39.321
IT COMES TO REPLACING CURBS AND 
THIS MY POINT OF VIEW HERE IS   
THAT THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME   

01:40:39.323 --> 01:40:40.123
THIS MY POINT OF VIEW HERE IS   
THAT THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME   
RIDING MY BIKE NEAR THE CURB    

01:40:40.125 --> 01:40:43.459
THAT THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME   
RIDING MY BIKE NEAR THE CURB    
AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT     

01:40:43.461 --> 01:40:44.093
RIDING MY BIKE NEAR THE CURB    
AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT     
WHEN WE&apos;RE REDOING STREETS      

01:40:44.095 --> 01:40:46.929
AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT     
WHEN WE&apos;RE REDOING STREETS      
WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE LEAVING A     

01:40:46.931 --> 01:40:50.500
WHEN WE&apos;RE REDOING STREETS      
WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE LEAVING A     
SMOOTH SURFACE THAT DOESN&apos;T     

01:40:50.502 --> 01:40:51.300
WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE LEAVING A     
SMOOTH SURFACE THAT DOESN&apos;T     
HAVE CRUMBLING BITS OF CEMENT   

01:40:51.302 --> 01:40:54.336
SMOOTH SURFACE THAT DOESN&apos;T     
HAVE CRUMBLING BITS OF CEMENT   
IN IT.                          

01:40:54.338 --> 01:40:57.906
HAVE CRUMBLING BITS OF CEMENT   
IN IT.                          
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S THE TIME TO   

01:40:57.908 --> 01:40:58.507
IN IT.                          
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S THE TIME TO   
DO IT AS WHEN WE&apos;RE             

01:40:58.509 --> 01:41:01.376
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S THE TIME TO   
DO IT AS WHEN WE&apos;RE             
REHABILITATING STREETS.         

01:41:01.378 --> 01:41:05.782
DO IT AS WHEN WE&apos;RE             
REHABILITATING STREETS.         
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT 

01:41:05.784 --> 01:41:09.252
REHABILITATING STREETS.         
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT 
CURBSTONE IS AS WE ADD MATERIAL 

01:41:09.254 --> 01:41:13.388
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT 
CURBSTONE IS AS WE ADD MATERIAL 
TO THE STREET LIKE HOW HOW      

01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:14.423
CURBSTONE IS AS WE ADD MATERIAL 
TO THE STREET LIKE HOW HOW      
SMALL OF A CURB IS TOO SMALL    

01:41:14.425 --> 01:41:18.160
TO THE STREET LIKE HOW HOW      
SMALL OF A CURB IS TOO SMALL    
LIKE I I THINK OF THE CURB IS   

01:41:18.162 --> 01:41:21.564
SMALL OF A CURB IS TOO SMALL    
LIKE I I THINK OF THE CURB IS   
DOING TWO THINGS YOU MENTIONED  

01:41:21.566 --> 01:41:22.397
LIKE I I THINK OF THE CURB IS   
DOING TWO THINGS YOU MENTIONED  
ONE WHICH IS KEEPING WATER IN   

01:41:22.399 --> 01:41:25.801
DOING TWO THINGS YOU MENTIONED  
ONE WHICH IS KEEPING WATER IN   
THE STREET BUT I ALSO THINK     

01:41:25.803 --> 01:41:26.602
ONE WHICH IS KEEPING WATER IN   
THE STREET BUT I ALSO THINK     
OF THEM AS LIKE KEEPING CARS IN 

01:41:26.604 --> 01:41:32.674
THE STREET BUT I ALSO THINK     
OF THEM AS LIKE KEEPING CARS IN 
THE STREET TO AND I GUESS I     

01:41:32.676 --> 01:41:33.409
OF THEM AS LIKE KEEPING CARS IN 
THE STREET TO AND I GUESS I     
JUST FEEL LIKE THERE HAVE THERE 

01:41:33.411 --> 01:41:34.110
THE STREET TO AND I GUESS I     
JUST FEEL LIKE THERE HAVE THERE 
ARE CURBS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD    

01:41:34.112 --> 01:41:37.045
JUST FEEL LIKE THERE HAVE THERE 
ARE CURBS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD    
THAT ARE VERY, VERY SMALL AND   

01:41:37.047 --> 01:41:37.780
ARE CURBS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD    
THAT ARE VERY, VERY SMALL AND   
REALLY WOULDN&apos;T STOP ANYBODY    

01:41:37.782 --> 01:41:41.216
THAT ARE VERY, VERY SMALL AND   
REALLY WOULDN&apos;T STOP ANYBODY    
FROM WHO IS GOING OFF THE       

01:41:41.218 --> 01:41:44.886
REALLY WOULDN&apos;T STOP ANYBODY    
FROM WHO IS GOING OFF THE       
STREET FROM WINDING UP IN       

01:41:44.888 --> 01:41:45.287
FROM WHO IS GOING OFF THE       
STREET FROM WINDING UP IN       
SOMEBODY&apos;S YARD.                

01:41:45.289 --> 01:41:50.492
STREET FROM WINDING UP IN       
SOMEBODY&apos;S YARD.                
SO HOW SHORT TOO SHORT?         

01:41:50.494 --> 01:41:54.463
SOMEBODY&apos;S YARD.                
SO HOW SHORT TOO SHORT?         
SO THE MOST OF THE CURVE AROUND 

01:41:54.465 --> 01:41:55.264
SO HOW SHORT TOO SHORT?         
SO THE MOST OF THE CURVE AROUND 
THE CITY IS STANDARD SIZE.      

01:41:55.266 --> 01:41:56.198
SO THE MOST OF THE CURVE AROUND 
THE CITY IS STANDARD SIZE.      
WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE      

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:02.238
THE CITY IS STANDARD SIZE.      
WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE      
YEARS IS IN THE PAST OVERLAYS   

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:03.438
WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE      
YEARS IS IN THE PAST OVERLAYS   
BEEN DONE IN THE CURB AND THAT  

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:04.239
YEARS IS IN THE PAST OVERLAYS   
BEEN DONE IN THE CURB AND THAT  
WAS REDUCED TO THE HEIGHT       

01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:07.242
BEEN DONE IN THE CURB AND THAT  
WAS REDUCED TO THE HEIGHT       
OF THE CURB FACE THE VISIBLE    

01:42:07.244 --> 01:42:10.212
WAS REDUCED TO THE HEIGHT       
OF THE CURB FACE THE VISIBLE    
HEIGHT OF THE CAR SPACE THAT&apos;S  

01:42:10.214 --> 01:42:11.080
OF THE CURB FACE THE VISIBLE    
HEIGHT OF THE CAR SPACE THAT&apos;S  
GENERALLY A TREATMENT THAT WE   

01:42:11.082 --> 01:42:14.349
HEIGHT OF THE CAR SPACE THAT&apos;S  
GENERALLY A TREATMENT THAT WE   
HAVE TRIED TO AVOID MORE IN     

01:42:14.351 --> 01:42:14.816
GENERALLY A TREATMENT THAT WE   
HAVE TRIED TO AVOID MORE IN     
MODERN TIMES.                   

01:42:14.818 --> 01:42:15.551
HAVE TRIED TO AVOID MORE IN     
MODERN TIMES.                   
SOMETIMES WHEN THE STREETS ARE  

01:42:15.553 --> 01:42:18.887
MODERN TIMES.                   
SOMETIMES WHEN THE STREETS ARE  
ALREADY OVERLAYED WE HAVE TO    

01:42:18.889 --> 01:42:19.688
SOMETIMES WHEN THE STREETS ARE  
ALREADY OVERLAYED WE HAVE TO    
OVERLAY IT AGAIN BUT WE REALLY  

01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:21.990
ALREADY OVERLAYED WE HAVE TO    
OVERLAY IT AGAIN BUT WE REALLY  
HAVEN&apos;T BEEN DOING MUCH OF IN   

01:42:21.992 --> 01:42:22.691
OVERLAY IT AGAIN BUT WE REALLY  
HAVEN&apos;T BEEN DOING MUCH OF IN   
RECENT TIMES IS ADDING A        

01:42:22.693 --> 01:42:25.761
HAVEN&apos;T BEEN DOING MUCH OF IN   
RECENT TIMES IS ADDING A        
SIGNIFICANT OVERLAY TO THE ROAD 

01:42:25.763 --> 01:42:26.595
RECENT TIMES IS ADDING A        
SIGNIFICANT OVERLAY TO THE ROAD 
WHEN I TALK ABOUT ADDING THINGS 

01:42:26.597 --> 01:42:29.398
SIGNIFICANT OVERLAY TO THE ROAD 
WHEN I TALK ABOUT ADDING THINGS 
TO THE TOP AND SOME OF OUR KPM  

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.333
WHEN I TALK ABOUT ADDING THINGS 
TO THE TOP AND SOME OF OUR KPM  
THOSE ARE VERY THIN TREATMENTS. 

01:42:30.335 --> 01:42:31.433
TO THE TOP AND SOME OF OUR KPM  
THOSE ARE VERY THIN TREATMENTS. 
&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE USUALLY AN INCH OR   

01:42:31.435 --> 01:42:34.169
THOSE ARE VERY THIN TREATMENTS.

AGAIN, THIS IS FOR LOCAL        

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:37.599
PLAN.                           
AGAIN, THIS IS FOR LOCAL        
NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS SO THEY    

01:58:37.601 --> 01:58:40.735
AGAIN, THIS IS FOR LOCAL        
NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS SO THEY    
HELP DESIGNATED PREFERRED ROUTE 

01:58:40.737 --> 01:58:41.669
NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS SO THEY    
HELP DESIGNATED PREFERRED ROUTE 
FOR CYCLISTS AND CAN RAISE THE

01:58:45.742 --> 01:58:52.379
AMONG CYCLISTS THEMSELVES BUT   
THEN ALSO ON MOTORISTS.         
SO THIS IS KIND OF A VERY LOW   

01:58:52.381 --> 01:58:53.314
THEN ALSO ON MOTORISTS.         
SO THIS IS KIND OF A VERY LOW   
BARRIER TO ENTRY SORT OF BIKE

01:59:00.524 --> 01:59:05.093
MARKINGS MAY BE ACCOMMODATED    
WITH SOME SIGNAGE AS WELL.      
THEN WE HAVE KIND OF MOVING UP  

01:59:05.095 --> 01:59:08.529
WITH SOME SIGNAGE AS WELL.      
THEN WE HAVE KIND OF MOVING UP  
A TIER SO FROM MINOR STREETS.   

01:59:08.531 --> 01:59:09.464
THEN WE HAVE KIND OF MOVING UP  
A TIER SO FROM MINOR STREETS.   
SO THESE ARE ROADS THAT MIGHT

THE TYPES OF FACILITIES THERE I 

01:59:16.573 --> 01:59:19.473
THOUSAND VEHICLES PER DAY AND   
THE TYPES OF FACILITIES THERE I 
THINK THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT   

01:59:19.475 --> 01:59:20.041
THE TYPES OF FACILITIES THERE I 
THINK THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT   
TYPES OF FACILITIES.            

01:59:20.043 --> 01:59:20.908
THINK THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT   
TYPES OF FACILITIES.            
THE FIRST THAT&apos;S IDENTIFIED IS  

01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:27.349
TYPES OF FACILITIES.            
THE FIRST THAT&apos;S IDENTIFIED IS  
KIND OF THE TRADITIONAL STRIPED 

01:59:27.883 --> 01:59:33.921
OF FACILITY JOUR A WHILE AGO    
DEMARCATES A CERTAIN PORTION    
OF THE STREET FOR RECYCLING IT  

01:59:33.923 --> 01:59:34.789
DEMARCATES A CERTAIN PORTION    
OF THE STREET FOR RECYCLING IT  
MAY INCLUDE KIND OF LIKE GREEN  

01:59:34.791 --> 01:59:38.359
OF THE STREET FOR RECYCLING IT  
MAY INCLUDE KIND OF LIKE GREEN  
PIGMENT THAT WE HAVE A CONFLICT 

01:59:38.361 --> 01:59:39.026
MAY INCLUDE KIND OF LIKE GREEN  
PIGMENT THAT WE HAVE A CONFLICT 
POINTS AND IT&apos;S MOST            

01:59:39.028 --> 01:59:39.794
PIGMENT THAT WE HAVE A CONFLICT 
POINTS AND IT&apos;S MOST            
APPROPRIATE ON STREETS WITH LOW 

01:59:39.796 --> 01:59:44.565
POINTS AND IT&apos;S MOST            
APPROPRIATE ON STREETS WITH LOW 
TO MODERATE SPEEDS VOLUMES      

01:59:44.567 --> 01:59:45.699
APPROPRIATE ON STREETS WITH LOW 
TO MODERATE SPEEDS VOLUMES      
TAKING THAT UP A NOTCH AGAIN    

01:59:45.701 --> 01:59:49.104
TO MODERATE SPEEDS VOLUMES      
TAKING THAT UP A NOTCH AGAIN    
LOOKING AT MINOR STREETS YOU    

01:59:49.106 --> 01:59:49.970
TAKING THAT UP A NOTCH AGAIN    
LOOKING AT MINOR STREETS YOU    
CAN TAKE THAT BIKE LANE AND IF  

01:59:49.972 --> 01:59:52.440
LOOKING AT MINOR STREETS YOU    
CAN TAKE THAT BIKE LANE AND IF  
YOU HAVE THE ROOM YOU CAN       

01:59:52.442 --> 01:59:53.174
CAN TAKE THAT BIKE LANE AND IF  
YOU HAVE THE ROOM YOU CAN       
BUFFER IT WITH PAINT.           

01:59:53.176 --> 01:59:54.376
YOU HAVE THE ROOM YOU CAN       
BUFFER IT WITH PAINT.           
SO YOU KIND OF ADD ANOTHER LINE 

01:59:54.378 --> 01:59:57.345
BUFFER IT WITH PAINT.           
SO YOU KIND OF ADD ANOTHER LINE 
PARALLEL TO IT WITH MAYBE SOME  

01:59:57.347 --> 01:59:58.012
SO YOU KIND OF ADD ANOTHER LINE 
PARALLEL TO IT WITH MAYBE SOME  
HASH MARKS IN BETWEEN.          

01:59:58.014 --> 02:00:04.386
PARALLEL TO IT WITH MAYBE SOME  
HASH MARKS IN BETWEEN.          
SO AGAIN, IT DEMARCATES         

02:00:17.633 --> 02:00:19.567
                        PORTION 
OF THE STREET BUT IT GIVES A    
GREATER SEPARATION BETWEEN THE  

02:00:19.569 --> 02:00:20.367
OF THE STREET BUT IT GIVES A    
GREATER SEPARATION BETWEEN THE  
CYCLIST AND THE MOTOR VEHICLES. 

02:00:20.369 --> 02:00:21.102
GREATER SEPARATION BETWEEN THE  
CYCLIST AND THE MOTOR VEHICLES. 
THERE&apos;S NOT JUST A SINGLE LINE  

02:00:21.104 --> 02:00:21.903
CYCLIST AND THE MOTOR VEHICLES. 
THERE&apos;S NOT JUST A SINGLE LINE  
THERE MIGHT BE TWO LINES WITH   

02:00:21.905 --> 02:00:22.504
THERE&apos;S NOT JUST A SINGLE LINE  
THERE MIGHT BE TWO LINES WITH   
SOME ADDITIONAL SPACE BETWEEN   

02:00:22.506 --> 02:00:23.170
THERE MIGHT BE TWO LINES WITH   
SOME ADDITIONAL SPACE BETWEEN   
THEM AND AGAIN THIS IS          

02:00:23.172 --> 02:00:23.838
SOME ADDITIONAL SPACE BETWEEN   
THEM AND AGAIN THIS IS          
APPROPRIATE STREETS TO LOW TO   

02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:24.506
THEM AND AGAIN THIS IS          
APPROPRIATE STREETS TO LOW TO   
MODERATE SPEEDS AND VOLUMES     

02:00:24.508 --> 02:00:25.173
APPROPRIATE STREETS TO LOW TO   
MODERATE SPEEDS AND VOLUMES     
OF THERE&apos;S ALSO THE CONCEPT     

02:00:25.175 --> 02:00:25.940
MODERATE SPEEDS AND VOLUMES     
OF THERE&apos;S ALSO THE CONCEPT     
OF CONTRAFLOW BIKE LANES.       

02:00:25.942 --> 02:00:26.741
OF THERE&apos;S ALSO THE CONCEPT     
OF CONTRAFLOW BIKE LANES.       
THE IDEA HERE IS THAT YOU WOULD 

02:00:26.743 --> 02:00:27.542
OF CONTRAFLOW BIKE LANES.       
THE IDEA HERE IS THAT YOU WOULD 
HAVE A BIKE LANE THAT GOES KIND 

02:00:27.544 --> 02:00:28.209
THE IDEA HERE IS THAT YOU WOULD 
HAVE A BIKE LANE THAT GOES KIND 
OF AGAINST TRAFFIC ON A ONE WAY 

02:00:28.211 --> 02:00:28.943
HAVE A BIKE LANE THAT GOES KIND 
OF AGAINST TRAFFIC ON A ONE WAY 
STREET SO IT PROVIDES A TWO WAY 

02:00:28.945 --> 02:00:29.744
OF AGAINST TRAFFIC ON A ONE WAY 
STREET SO IT PROVIDES A TWO WAY 
BICYCLE FACILITY ON A ONE WAY   

02:00:29.746 --> 02:00:30.011
STREET SO IT PROVIDES A TWO WAY 
BICYCLE FACILITY ON A ONE WAY   
STREET.                         

02:00:30.013 --> 02:00:31.378
BICYCLE FACILITY ON A ONE WAY   
STREET.                         
BUT IN DOING SO YOU HAVE TO     

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:32.012
STREET.                         
BUT IN DOING SO YOU HAVE TO     
CONSIDER SOME PROTECTIVE        

02:00:32.014 --> 02:00:32.613
BUT IN DOING SO YOU HAVE TO     
CONSIDER SOME PROTECTIVE        
ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT         

02:00:32.615 --> 02:00:34.816
CONSIDER SOME PROTECTIVE        
ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT         
ONCOMING VEHICLES KIND          

02:00:34.818 --> 02:00:35.483
ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT         
ONCOMING VEHICLES KIND          
OF RESPECT THAT BICYCLISTS      

02:00:35.485 --> 02:00:39.253
ONCOMING VEHICLES KIND          
OF RESPECT THAT BICYCLISTS      
REALM AND THIS IS MOSTLY        

02:00:39.255 --> 02:00:40.054
OF RESPECT THAT BICYCLISTS      
REALM AND THIS IS MOSTLY        
APPROPRIATE WHERE THERE ARE FEW 

02:00:40.056 --> 02:00:43.057
REALM AND THIS IS MOSTLY        
APPROPRIATE WHERE THERE ARE FEW 
TURNING CONFLICTS SO IN THE     

02:00:43.059 --> 02:00:43.991
APPROPRIATE WHERE THERE ARE FEW 
TURNING CONFLICTS SO IN THE     
PICTURE YOU CAN KIND OF SEE ON  

02:00:43.993 --> 02:00:46.761
TURNING CONFLICTS SO IN THE     
PICTURE YOU CAN KIND OF SEE ON  
THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PICTURE    

02:00:46.763 --> 02:00:49.997

02:00:49.999 --> 02:00:50.498
THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PICTURE    
THE THE THE CONTRAFLOW PORTION  
OF THE BIKE LANE.               

02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:50.765
THE THE THE CONTRAFLOW PORTION  
OF THE BIKE LANE.               
RIGHT.                          

02:00:50.767 --> 02:00:51.700
OF THE BIKE LANE.               
RIGHT.                          
BECAUSE THIS IS A ONE WAY       

02:00:51.702 --> 02:00:53.901
RIGHT.                          
BECAUSE THIS IS A ONE WAY       
STREET BUT YOU CAN SEE KIND     

02:00:53.903 --> 02:00:54.502
BECAUSE THIS IS A ONE WAY       
STREET BUT YOU CAN SEE KIND     
OF THE CORRESPONDING WITH       

02:00:54.504 --> 02:00:58.172
STREET BUT YOU CAN SEE KIND     
OF THE CORRESPONDING WITH       
DIRECTION OF TRAFFIC BIKE LANE  

02:00:58.174 --> 02:00:58.973
OF THE CORRESPONDING WITH       
DIRECTION OF TRAFFIC BIKE LANE  
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE     

02:00:58.975 --> 02:01:01.041
DIRECTION OF TRAFFIC BIKE LANE  
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE     
STREET.                         

02:01:01.043 --> 02:01:02.276
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE     
STREET.                         
&gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT  

02:01:02.278 --> 02:01:05.847
STREET.                         
&gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT  
STEPPING UP TO A DIFFERENT ROAD 

02:01:05.849 --> 02:01:06.514
&gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT  
STEPPING UP TO A DIFFERENT ROAD 
TYPE NOW WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT    

02:01:06.516 --> 02:01:09.317
STEPPING UP TO A DIFFERENT ROAD 
TYPE NOW WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT    
TOOLS FOR MAJOR STREETS.        

02:01:09.319 --> 02:01:10.251
TYPE NOW WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT    
TOOLS FOR MAJOR STREETS.        
SO THESE ARE STREETS THAT HAVE, 

02:01:10.253 --> 02:01:13.254
TOOLS FOR MAJOR STREETS.        
SO THESE ARE STREETS THAT HAVE, 
YOU KNOW, POSTED SPEED LIMITS   

02:01:13.256 --> 02:01:14.055
SO THESE ARE STREETS THAT HAVE, 
YOU KNOW, POSTED SPEED LIMITS   
OF THIRTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR   

02:01:14.057 --> 02:01:14.955
YOU KNOW, POSTED SPEED LIMITS   
OF THIRTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR   
OR GREATER AND MORE THAN TEN    

02:01:14.957 --> 02:01:17.291
OF THIRTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR   
OR GREATER AND MORE THAN TEN    
THOUSAND VEHICLES PER DAY.      

02:01:17.293 --> 02:01:18.325
OR GREATER AND MORE THAN TEN    
THOUSAND VEHICLES PER DAY.      
SO AGAIN, YOU CAN KIND          

02:01:18.327 --> 02:01:20.995
THOUSAND VEHICLES PER DAY.      
SO AGAIN, YOU CAN KIND          
OF FOLLOW THE SPECTRUM AND SORT 

02:01:20.997 --> 02:01:21.930
SO AGAIN, YOU CAN KIND          
OF FOLLOW THE SPECTRUM AND SORT 
OF GRADUATED APPROACH TO HOW WE 

02:01:21.932 --> 02:01:25.199
OF FOLLOW THE SPECTRUM AND SORT 
OF GRADUATED APPROACH TO HOW WE 
WOULD IMPLEMENT FACILITIES.     

02:01:25.201 --> 02:01:26.334
OF GRADUATED APPROACH TO HOW WE 
WOULD IMPLEMENT FACILITIES.     
&gt;&gt; SO THE FIRST IS A PROTECTED  

02:01:26.336 --> 02:01:26.668
WOULD IMPLEMENT FACILITIES.     
&gt;&gt; SO THE FIRST IS A PROTECTED  
BIKE LANE.                      

02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:29.703
&gt;&gt; SO THE FIRST IS A PROTECTED  
BIKE LANE.                      
THE IDEA IS THAT THESE RUN AT   

02:01:29.705 --> 02:01:30.404
BIKE LANE.                      
THE IDEA IS THAT THESE RUN AT   
STREET LEVEL AND THEY PROVIDE   

02:01:30.406 --> 02:01:33.141
THE IDEA IS THAT THESE RUN AT   
STREET LEVEL AND THEY PROVIDE   
SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL           

02:01:33.143 --> 02:01:34.108
STREET LEVEL AND THEY PROVIDE   
SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL           
SEPARATION FROM THE VEHICLES IN 

02:01:34.110 --> 02:01:36.778
SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL           
SEPARATION FROM THE VEHICLES IN 
THE FORM OF FLEXIBLE DELINEATOR

02:01:40.917 --> 02:01:42.050
PARKING LANES CURBS OR CONCRETE 
MEDIANS OR PLANTERS.            
AND THE ONE THING TO NOTE IS    

02:01:42.052 --> 02:01:42.650
MEDIANS OR PLANTERS.            
AND THE ONE THING TO NOTE IS    
THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION AT       

02:01:42.652 --> 02:01:45.052
AND THE ONE THING TO NOTE IS    
THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION AT       
INTERSECTIONS SHOULD BE MADE OR 

02:01:45.054 --> 02:01:45.820
THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION AT

BIDIRECTIONAL CYCLE TRACK LIKE  
THE ONE THAT&apos;S PICTURED.        
IT IS THE FOURTH STREET OR I&apos;M

THE ONE THAT&apos;S PICTURED.        
IT IS THE FOURTH STREET OR I&apos;M  
SORRY IT&apos;S THE WILLIAM STREET

IT IS THE FOURTH STREET OR I&apos;M  
SORRY IT&apos;S THE WILLIAM STREET

02:02:11.782 --> 02:02:14.381
SORRY IT&apos;S THE WILLIAM STREET   
CYCLE TRACK AT 47TH STREET.     
YOU CAN STILL HAVE A PROTECTED  

02:02:14.383 --> 02:02:15.383
CYCLE TRACK AT 47TH STREET.     
YOU CAN STILL HAVE A PROTECTED  
BIKE LANE AND IT JUST BE SINGLE 

02:02:15.385 --> 02:02:16.183
YOU CAN STILL HAVE A PROTECTED  
BIKE LANE AND IT JUST BE SINGLE 
DIRECTION BUT IT STILL HAS TO   

02:02:16.185 --> 02:02:18.619
BIKE LANE AND IT JUST BE SINGLE 
DIRECTION BUT IT STILL HAS TO   
HAVE THOSE SORT OF VERTICAL     

02:02:18.621 --> 02:02:19.286
DIRECTION BUT IT STILL HAS TO   
HAVE THOSE SORT OF VERTICAL     
ELEMENTS THAT PROVIDE THAT      

02:02:19.288 --> 02:02:20.889
HAVE THOSE SORT OF VERTICAL     
ELEMENTS THAT PROVIDE THAT      
PHYSICAL SEPARATION FROM THE    

02:02:20.891 --> 02:02:25.160
ELEMENTS THAT PROVIDE THAT      
PHYSICAL SEPARATION FROM THE

PHYSICAL SEPARATION FROM THE    
VEHICLES.                       
&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S ALSO ANOTHER CONCEPT 

02:02:26.062 --> 02:02:29.730
VEHICLES.                       
&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S ALSO ANOTHER CONCEPT 
SIMILAR TO THE CYCLE TRACK      

02:02:29.732 --> 02:02:30.398
&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S ALSO ANOTHER CONCEPT 
SIMILAR TO THE CYCLE TRACK      
WHERE THE PROTECTED BIKE LANE   

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:31.198
SIMILAR TO THE CYCLE TRACK      
WHERE THE PROTECTED BIKE LANE   
WHERE YOU HAVE A RAISED BIKE    

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.768
WHERE THE PROTECTED BIKE LANE   
WHERE YOU HAVE A RAISED BIKE    
LANE SO THIS IS WHERE YOU       

02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:34.469
WHERE YOU HAVE A RAISED BIKE    
LANE SO THIS IS WHERE YOU       
ACTUALLY TAKE THE ELEVATION     

02:02:34.471 --> 02:02:37.471
LANE SO THIS IS WHERE YOU       
ACTUALLY TAKE THE ELEVATION     
OF THE BIKE LANE AND BRING IT   

02:02:37.473 --> 02:02:38.039
ACTUALLY TAKE THE ELEVATION     
OF THE BIKE LANE AND BRING IT   
UP TO SIDEWALK LEVEL.           

02:02:38.041 --> 02:02:40.674
OF THE BIKE LANE AND BRING IT   
UP TO SIDEWALK LEVEL.           
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE 

02:02:40.676 --> 02:02:41.309
UP TO SIDEWALK LEVEL.           
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THERE&apos;S CLEAR SEPARATION   

02:02:41.311 --> 02:02:42.109
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THERE&apos;S CLEAR SEPARATION   
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE WALKING  

02:02:42.111 --> 02:02:44.378
THAT THERE&apos;S CLEAR SEPARATION   
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE WALKING  
AND BIKING.                     

02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:45.480
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE WALKING  
AND BIKING.                     
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT, YOU KNOW, 

02:02:45.482 --> 02:02:46.214
AND BIKING.                     
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT, YOU KNOW, 
THE CYCLIST IS A LITTLE BIT     

02:02:46.216 --> 02:02:47.014
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT, YOU KNOW, 
THE CYCLIST IS A LITTLE BIT     
MORE ELEVATED, A LITTLE BIT     

02:02:47.016 --> 02:02:48.816
THE CYCLIST IS A LITTLE BIT     
MORE ELEVATED, A LITTLE BIT     
MORE VISIBLE AND THEN JUST THE  

02:02:48.818 --> 02:02:49.484
MORE ELEVATED, A LITTLE BIT     
MORE VISIBLE AND THEN JUST THE  
SHEER FACT THAT THE BIKE        

02:02:49.486 --> 02:02:52.487
MORE VISIBLE AND THEN JUST THE  
SHEER FACT THAT THE BIKE        
FACILITY IS RAISED PROVIDES     

02:02:52.489 --> 02:02:53.287
SHEER FACT THAT THE BIKE        
FACILITY IS RAISED PROVIDES     
THAT VERTICAL SEPARATION FROM   

02:02:53.289 --> 02:02:59.394
FACILITY IS RAISED PROVIDES     
THAT VERTICAL SEPARATION FROM   
THE VEHICULAR TRAVELING         

02:02:59.862 --> 02:03:05.266
                        AND     
THEN ALSO FOUR MAJOR STREETS    
YOU HAVE OFF STREET SHARED USE  

02:03:05.268 --> 02:03:08.069
THEN ALSO FOUR MAJOR STREETS    
YOU HAVE OFF STREET SHARED USE  
PATHS OR SOMETIMES CALLED SIDE  

02:03:08.071 --> 02:03:11.372
YOU HAVE OFF STREET SHARED USE  
PATHS OR SOMETIMES CALLED SIDE  
PATHS.                          

02:03:11.374 --> 02:03:12.440
PATHS OR SOMETIMES CALLED SIDE  
PATHS.                          
SO THIS IS A BIKE AND HEAD      

02:03:12.442 --> 02:03:15.376
PATHS.                          
SO THIS IS A BIKE AND HEAD      
FACILITY THAT&apos;S PHYSICALLY      

02:03:15.378 --> 02:03:16.143
SO THIS IS A BIKE AND HEAD      
FACILITY THAT&apos;S PHYSICALLY      
SEPARATED FROM VEHICLES EITHER  

02:03:16.145 --> 02:03:19.280
FACILITY THAT&apos;S PHYSICALLY      
SEPARATED FROM VEHICLES EITHER  
BY SOME SORT OF OPEN SPACE OR   

02:03:19.282 --> 02:03:19.680
SEPARATED FROM VEHICLES EITHER  
BY SOME SORT OF OPEN SPACE OR   
BARRIER.                        

02:03:19.682 --> 02:03:20.548
BY SOME SORT OF OPEN SPACE OR   
BARRIER.                        
IT TENDS TO COMPLIMENT ON       

02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:23.818
BARRIER.                        
IT TENDS TO COMPLIMENT ON       
STREET ROUTES AND WHAT THAT     

02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:24.619
IT TENDS TO COMPLIMENT ON       
STREET ROUTES AND WHAT THAT     
MEANS IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 

02:03:24.621 --> 02:03:25.320
STREET ROUTES AND WHAT THAT     
MEANS IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 
BORDER TO BOARD A TRAIL WHICH   

02:03:25.322 --> 02:03:27.588
MEANS IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 
BORDER TO BOARD A TRAIL WHICH   
IS PICTURED ON THE SLIDE, IT    

02:03:27.590 --> 02:03:28.423
BORDER TO BOARD A TRAIL WHICH   
IS PICTURED ON THE SLIDE, IT    
CAN ACT LIKE A SPINE AND THEN   

02:03:28.425 --> 02:03:30.391
IS PICTURED ON THE SLIDE, IT    
CAN ACT LIKE A SPINE AND THEN   
FROM THAT SPINE YOU CAN THEN    

02:03:30.393 --> 02:03:31.159
CAN ACT LIKE A SPINE AND THEN   
FROM THAT SPINE YOU CAN THEN    
RADIATE OUT OTHER FACILITIES    

02:03:31.161 --> 02:03:34.895
FROM THAT SPINE YOU CAN THEN    
RADIATE OUT OTHER FACILITIES    
WHETHER THAT BE THE BIKE LANES  

02:03:34.897 --> 02:03:35.563
RADIATE OUT OTHER FACILITIES    
WHETHER THAT BE THE BIKE LANES  
OR THE PROTECTED AREAS THAT WE  

02:03:35.565 --> 02:03:38.566
WHETHER THAT BE THE BIKE LANES  
OR THE PROTECTED AREAS THAT WE  
SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER AND WHEN    

02:03:38.568 --> 02:03:39.433
OR THE PROTECTED AREAS THAT WE  
SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER AND WHEN    
DONE REALLY WELL IT CAN HELP    

02:03:39.435 --> 02:03:42.269
SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER AND WHEN    
DONE REALLY WELL IT CAN HELP    
FACILITATE LONG DISTANCE        

02:03:42.271 --> 02:03:43.171
DONE REALLY WELL IT CAN HELP    
FACILITATE LONG DISTANCE        
COMMUTING SUCH AS THE BORDER TO 

02:03:43.173 --> 02:03:45.272
FACILITATE LONG DISTANCE        
COMMUTING SUCH AS THE BORDER TO 
BORDER TRAIL CAN CONNECT AND    

02:03:45.274 --> 02:03:49.477
COMMUTING SUCH AS THE BORDER TO 
BORDER TRAIL CAN CONNECT AND    
IPSI FOR EXAMPLE.               

02:03:49.479 --> 02:03:50.711
BORDER TRAIL CAN CONNECT AND    
IPSI FOR EXAMPLE.               
&gt;&gt; AND SO WITH THOSE FACILITIES 

02:03:50.713 --> 02:03:53.614
IPSI FOR EXAMPLE.               
&gt;&gt; AND SO WITH THOSE FACILITIES 
OF MINES JUST TO WHAT&apos;S COMING  

02:03:53.616 --> 02:03:54.448
&gt;&gt; AND SO WITH THOSE FACILITIES 
OF MINES JUST TO WHAT&apos;S COMING  
UP NEXT, THE FIRST THING THAT   

02:03:54.450 --> 02:03:57.785
OF MINES JUST TO WHAT&apos;S COMING  
UP NEXT, THE FIRST THING THAT   
WE ARE FOCUSED ON IS LOOKING AT 

02:03:57.787 --> 02:03:58.519
UP NEXT, THE FIRST THING THAT   
WE ARE FOCUSED ON IS LOOKING AT 
OUR NETWORK OF BUFFORD BIKE     

02:03:58.521 --> 02:04:01.789
WE ARE FOCUSED ON IS LOOKING AT 
OUR NETWORK OF BUFFORD BIKE     
LANES AND UPGRADING THOSE TWO   

02:04:01.791 --> 02:04:02.457
OUR NETWORK OF BUFFORD BIKE     
LANES AND UPGRADING THOSE TWO   
PROTECTED BIKE LANES.           

02:04:02.459 --> 02:04:05.225
LANES AND UPGRADING THOSE TWO   
PROTECTED BIKE LANES.           
WE FEEL THIS IS A PRETTY LOW    

02:04:05.227 --> 02:04:05.626
PROTECTED BIKE LANES.           
WE FEEL THIS IS A PRETTY LOW    
HANGING FRUIT.                  

02:04:05.628 --> 02:04:06.627
WE FEEL THIS IS A PRETTY LOW    
HANGING FRUIT.                  
WE ALREADY HAVE THE PHYSICAL    

02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:08.695
HANGING FRUIT.

OF EQUIPMENT FOR WE START       
STALLING A LOT OF THOSE         
VERTICAL DELINEATOR IS BECAUSE  

02:06:00.676 --> 02:06:01.675
STALLING A LOT OF THOSE         
VERTICAL DELINEATOR IS BECAUSE  
WE DON&apos;T WANT TO SET UP THE     

02:06:01.677 --> 02:06:05.112
VERTICAL DELINEATOR IS BECAUSE  
WE DON&apos;T WANT TO SET UP THE     
FACILITY FOR FAILURE WHERE WE   

02:06:05.114 --> 02:06:05.747
WE DON&apos;T WANT TO SET UP THE     
FACILITY FOR FAILURE WHERE WE   
PUT IN ALL THESE VERTICAL       

02:06:05.749 --> 02:06:06.614
FACILITY FOR FAILURE WHERE WE   
PUT IN ALL THESE VERTICAL       
DEVICES AND THEN WE&apos;RE NOT ABLE 

02:06:06.616 --> 02:06:08.849
PUT IN ALL THESE VERTICAL

02:21:33.942 --> 02:21:34.807
MOTORIZED TRAVEL PROJECT AND    
IT&apos;S BIG AND AN EXAMPLE OF THIS 
WAS A FEW YEARS AGO THE ALLEN   

02:21:34.809 --> 02:21:37.010
IT&apos;S BIG AND AN EXAMPLE OF THIS 
WAS A FEW YEARS AGO THE ALLEN   
CREEK BERM PROJECT WAS FUNDED

TEMPORARILY RAISED IT I THINK   
FOR THAT YEAR FOR AN ADDITIONAL

FOR THAT YEAR FOR AN ADDITIONAL 
ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO COMPLETE
