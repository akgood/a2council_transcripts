ACROSS TO PROBABLY ABOUT HERE

A COAL CHUTE OR SOMETHING WAS   
BUILT ON THE BACK A HOUSE.      

00:09:02.782 --> 00:09:03.848
A COAL CHUTE OR SOMETHING WAS   
BUILT ON THE BACK A HOUSE.      
SO IT&apos;S VERY EASY TO PICK OUT   

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.851
BUILT ON THE BACK A HOUSE.      
SO IT&apos;S VERY EASY TO PICK OUT   
WHERE THE THE NEW ARE.          

00:09:06.853 --> 00:09:09.554
SO IT&apos;S VERY EASY TO PICK OUT   
WHERE THE THE NEW ARE.          
THIS WINDOW IS CLEARLY MODERN   

00:09:09.556 --> 00:09:10.622
WHERE THE THE NEW ARE.          
THIS WINDOW IS CLEARLY MODERN   
AS IS THIS AWNING AND THE DOOR  

00:09:10.624 --> 00:09:13.491
THIS WINDOW IS CLEARLY MODERN   
AS IS THIS AWNING AND THE DOOR  
BACK HERE.                      

00:09:13.493 --> 00:09:14.759
AS IS THIS AWNING AND THE DOOR  
BACK HERE.                      
SO WHEN THIS SECOND FLOOR WAS   

00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:18.195
BACK HERE.                      
SO WHEN THIS SECOND FLOOR WAS   
ADDED AS SORT OF AN EXTENSION   

00:09:18.197 --> 00:09:18.997
SO WHEN THIS SECOND FLOOR WAS   
ADDED AS SORT OF AN EXTENSION   
TO A BEDROOM UPSTAIRS I BELIEVE 

00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:21.866
ADDED AS SORT OF AN EXTENSION   
TO A BEDROOM UPSTAIRS I BELIEVE 
SORT OF A SUNROOM WITH A LOT    

00:09:21.868 --> 00:09:22.634
TO A BEDROOM UPSTAIRS I BELIEVE 
SORT OF A SUNROOM WITH A LOT    
OF WINDOWS, THIS OTHER WORK WAS 

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:25.570
SORT OF A SUNROOM WITH A LOT    
OF WINDOWS, THIS OTHER WORK WAS 
DONE AT THE SAME TIME IT&apos;S NOT  

00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:26.204
OF WINDOWS, THIS OTHER WORK WAS 
DONE AT THE SAME TIME IT&apos;S NOT  
KNOWN WHETHER THERE WERE        

00:09:26.206 --> 00:09:26.738
DONE AT THE SAME TIME IT&apos;S NOT  
KNOWN WHETHER THERE WERE        
WINDOWS BACK HERE.              

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.572
KNOWN WHETHER THERE WERE        
WINDOWS BACK HERE.              
THERE PROBABLY WAS A WINDOW OR  

00:09:27.574 --> 00:09:30.041
WINDOWS BACK HERE.              
THERE PROBABLY WAS A WINDOW OR  
TWO BUT CERTAINLY THEY WERE NOT 

00:09:30.043 --> 00:09:30.909
THERE PROBABLY WAS A WINDOW OR  
TWO BUT CERTAINLY THEY WERE NOT 
THIS BIG AND THEY WOULDN&apos;T HAVE 

00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:32.777
TWO BUT CERTAINLY THEY WERE NOT 
THIS BIG AND THEY WOULDN&apos;T HAVE 
HAD THIS BOX TRIM.              

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:33.578
THIS BIG AND THEY WOULDN&apos;T HAVE 
HAD THIS BOX TRIM.              
IT DOESN&apos;T REALLY MATTER        

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.311
HAD THIS BOX TRIM.              
IT DOESN&apos;T REALLY MATTER        
ANYTHING ELSE ON THE HOUSE.     

00:09:34.313 --> 00:09:37.181
IT DOESN&apos;T REALLY MATTER        
ANYTHING ELSE ON THE HOUSE.     
SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALL   

00:09:37.183 --> 00:09:37.648
ANYTHING ELSE ON THE HOUSE.     
SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALL   
NON HISTORIC.                   

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.651
SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALL   
NON HISTORIC.                   
ANOTHER VIEW OF THE BACK OF THE

THE PROPOSAL IS TO TAKE THE HIT 
ROOF THAT&apos;S CURRENTLY ON THE

EACH SECTION OF STONE WOULD BE  
HAVE ITS OWN PILE SO THEY       
WOULDN&apos;T GET MIXED TOGETHER AND 

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:51.894
HAVE ITS OWN PILE SO THEY       
WOULDN&apos;T GET MIXED TOGETHER AND 
THEN AS DAVID MENTIONED, YOU    

00:34:51.896 --> 00:34:55.098
WOULDN&apos;T GET MIXED TOGETHER AND 
THEN AS DAVID MENTIONED, YOU    
KNOW, THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S QUITE A

KNOW, THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S QUITE A   
VARIETY OF TYPES OF MORTAR      

00:34:55.767 --> 00:34:59.201
KNOW, THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S QUITE A   
VARIETY OF TYPES OF MORTAR      
JOINTS IN THIS BUILDING AS IT   

00:34:59.203 --> 00:34:59.502
VARIETY OF TYPES OF MORTAR      
JOINTS IN THIS BUILDING AS IT   
IS NOW.

JOINTS IN THIS BUILDING AS IT   
IS NOW.                         
AND SO THERE WOULD BE A CLEANUP 

00:35:03.341 --> 00:35:06.342
IS NOW.                         
AND SO THERE WOULD BE A CLEANUP 
PROCESS THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHERE 

00:35:06.344 --> 00:35:07.010
AND SO THERE WOULD BE A CLEANUP 
PROCESS THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHERE 
PARTICULARLY THE THE FIELD      

00:35:07.012 --> 00:35:10.080
PROCESS THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHERE 
PARTICULARLY THE THE FIELD      
STONE WHICH IS I&apos;D SAY THE MOST 

00:35:10.082 --> 00:35:11.013
PARTICULARLY THE THE FIELD      
STONE WHICH IS I&apos;D SAY THE MOST 
CAKED IN MORTAR WOULD ALMOST    

00:35:11.015 --> 00:35:11.548
STONE WHICH IS I&apos;D SAY THE MOST 
CAKED IN MORTAR WOULD ALMOST    
CERTAINLY NEED TO BE            

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.317
CAKED IN MORTAR WOULD ALMOST    
CERTAINLY NEED TO BE            
SANDBLASTED TO GET A LOT OF THE 

00:35:14.319 --> 00:35:19.021
CERTAINLY NEED TO BE            
SANDBLASTED TO GET A LOT OF THE 
MORTAR OFF AND OUR GOAL IS TO   

00:35:19.023 --> 00:35:21.690
SANDBLASTED TO GET A LOT OF THE 
MORTAR OFF AND OUR GOAL IS TO   
MAKE THIS THING LOOK AS AS      

00:35:21.692 --> 00:35:22.592
MORTAR OFF AND OUR GOAL IS TO   
MAKE THIS THING LOOK AS AS      
CLOSE TO ORIGINAL AS IT DID AND 

00:35:22.594 --> 00:35:25.962
MAKE THIS THING LOOK AS AS      
CLOSE TO ORIGINAL AS IT DID AND 
MUCH, MUCH BETTER AND MUCH      

00:35:25.964 --> 00:35:26.695
CLOSE TO ORIGINAL AS IT DID AND 
MUCH, MUCH BETTER AND MUCH      
CLEANER THAN IT DOES NOW.       

00:35:26.697 --> 00:35:30.366
MUCH, MUCH BETTER AND MUCH      
CLEANER THAN IT DOES NOW.       
SO IN FACT I THINK, YOU KNOW,   

00:35:30.368 --> 00:35:33.936
CLEANER THAN IT DOES NOW.       
SO IN FACT I THINK, YOU KNOW,   
AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE STATE   

00:35:33.938 --> 00:35:36.839
SO IN FACT I THINK, YOU KNOW,   
AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE STATE   
OF THE PORCH PARTICULARLY, IT&apos;S 

00:35:36.841 --> 00:35:40.810
AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE STATE   
OF THE PORCH PARTICULARLY, IT&apos;S 
REALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO 

00:35:40.812 --> 00:35:41.678
OF THE PORCH PARTICULARLY, IT&apos;S 
REALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO 
TAKE IT APART AND PUT IT BACK   

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.478
REALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO 
TAKE IT APART AND PUT IT BACK   
TOGETHER EVEN IF YOU WERE JUST  

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.347
TAKE IT APART AND PUT IT BACK   
TOGETHER EVEN IF YOU WERE JUST  
TRYING TO MAKE IT DURABLE, YOU  

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:48.651
TOGETHER EVEN IF YOU WERE JUST  
TRYING TO MAKE IT DURABLE, YOU  
KNOW, AND MAKE IT FIX THE       

00:35:48.653 --> 00:35:54.224
TRYING TO MAKE IT DURABLE, YOU  
KNOW, AND MAKE IT FIX THE       
ISSUES THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE 

00:35:54.226 --> 00:35:54.557
KNOW, AND MAKE IT FIX THE       
ISSUES THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE 
.                               

00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:55.692
ISSUES THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE 
.                               
SO LET ME SEE IF I&apos;M FORGETTING 

00:35:55.694 --> 00:35:56.159
.                               
SO LET ME SEE IF I&apos;M FORGETTING 
YOU KNOW.                       

00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:58.694
SO LET ME SEE IF I&apos;M FORGETTING 
YOU KNOW.                       
WELL, OF COURSE WE&apos;LL OF COURSE 

00:35:58.696 --> 00:35:59.629
YOU KNOW.                       
WELL, OF COURSE WE&apos;LL OF COURSE 
DO OUR BEST TO MATCH THE        

00:35:59.631 --> 00:36:03.066
WELL, OF COURSE WE&apos;LL OF COURSE 
DO OUR BEST TO MATCH THE        
ORIGINAL MORTAR AS FAR AS WE    

00:36:03.068 --> 00:36:05.735
DO OUR BEST TO MATCH THE        
ORIGINAL MORTAR AS FAR AS WE    
CAN AND TO THE BEST OF OUR      

00:36:05.737 --> 00:36:06.469
ORIGINAL MORTAR AS FAR AS WE    
CAN AND TO THE BEST OF OUR      
ABILITY DETERMINE THE ORIGINAL  

00:36:06.471 --> 00:36:09.538
CAN AND TO THE BEST OF OUR      
ABILITY DETERMINE THE ORIGINAL  
MORTAR JOINTS SIZE.             

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.540
ABILITY DETERMINE THE ORIGINAL  
MORTAR JOINTS SIZE.             
THAT&apos;S MUCH EASIER TO DO        

00:36:10.542 --> 00:36:13.809
MORTAR JOINTS SIZE.             
THAT&apos;S MUCH EASIER TO DO        
OF COURSE WHERE THE THERE&apos;S NOT 

00:36:13.811 --> 00:36:14.377
THAT&apos;S MUCH EASIER TO DO        
OF COURSE WHERE THE THERE&apos;S NOT 
SO MUCH TALK POINTING.          

00:36:14.379 --> 00:36:17.180
OF COURSE WHERE THE THERE&apos;S NOT 
SO MUCH TALK POINTING.          
SO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE  

00:36:17.182 --> 00:36:18.448
SO MUCH TALK POINTING.          
SO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE  
BUT YOU KNOW, WE&apos;LL DO OUR BEST 

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.451
SO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE  
BUT YOU KNOW, WE&apos;LL DO OUR BEST 
TO MAYBE CLEAN UP A MORTAR      

00:36:21.453 --> 00:36:22.185
BUT YOU KNOW, WE&apos;LL DO OUR BEST 
TO MAYBE CLEAN UP A MORTAR      
JOINT OR TWO BEFORE WE TAKE IT  

00:36:22.187 --> 00:36:25.221
TO MAYBE CLEAN UP A MORTAR      
JOINT OR TWO BEFORE WE TAKE IT  
APART AND TRY TO DOCUMENT THE   

00:36:25.223 --> 00:36:31.828
JOINT OR TWO BEFORE WE TAKE IT  
APART AND TRY TO DOCUMENT THE   
THE SIZE OF THE MORTAR JOINT    

00:36:32.296 --> 00:36:36.466
                            .   
I THINK THAT IS THAT IS         
GENERALLY OUR APPROACH TO THE   

00:36:36.468 --> 00:36:37.067
I THINK THAT IS THAT IS         
GENERALLY OUR APPROACH TO THE   
KIND OF TAKING IT APART,        

00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:40.069
GENERALLY OUR APPROACH TO THE   
KIND OF TAKING IT APART,        
CLEANING IT UP, STORING IT,     

00:36:40.071 --> 00:36:41.071
KIND OF TAKING IT APART,        
CLEANING IT UP, STORING IT,     
DOCUMENTING IT AND THEN THE NEW 

00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:44.540
CLEANING IT UP, STORING IT,     
DOCUMENTING IT AND THEN THE NEW 
WALL AS WE SHOW IN OUR OUR WALL 

00:36:44.542 --> 00:36:47.610
DOCUMENTING IT AND THEN THE NEW 
WALL AS WE SHOW IN OUR OUR WALL 
SECTION WILL BE CONCRETE BLOCK  

00:36:47.612 --> 00:36:48.711
WALL AS WE SHOW IN OUR OUR WALL 
SECTION WILL BE CONCRETE BLOCK  
UP TO GRADE AND THEN WE WOULD   

00:36:48.713 --> 00:36:52.381
SECTION WILL BE CONCRETE BLOCK  
UP TO GRADE AND THEN WE WOULD   
USE A STONE FROM ABOVE FROM     

00:36:52.383 --> 00:36:56.018
UP TO GRADE AND THEN WE WOULD   
USE A STONE FROM ABOVE FROM     
BELOW GRADE EXCUSE ME FROM      

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.422
USE A STONE FROM ABOVE FROM     
BELOW GRADE EXCUSE ME FROM      
ABOVE BASICALLY ABOVE GRADE.    

00:36:59.424 --> 00:37:00.490
BELOW GRADE EXCUSE ME FROM      
ABOVE BASICALLY ABOVE GRADE.    
SO AT THAT POINT THE MASON      

00:37:00.492 --> 00:37:01.357
ABOVE BASICALLY ABOVE GRADE.    
SO AT THAT POINT THE MASON      
ASSURED ME THEY WOULD DO THEIR  

00:37:01.359 --> 00:37:04.394
SO AT THAT POINT THE MASON      
ASSURED ME THEY WOULD DO THEIR  
BEST TO TO REPLACE THE STONES   

00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:07.463
ASSURED ME THEY WOULD DO THEIR  
BEST TO TO REPLACE THE STONES   
EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE.         

00:37:07.465 --> 00:37:08.531
BEST TO TO REPLACE THE STONES   
EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE.         
THEY DID TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE 

00:37:08.533 --> 00:37:11.935
EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE.         
THEY DID TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE 
TRIED THIS BEFORE AND IT&apos;S GONE 

00:37:11.937 --> 00:37:12.468
THEY DID TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE 
TRIED THIS BEFORE AND IT&apos;S GONE 
WELL GENERALLY.                 

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.238
TRIED THIS BEFORE AND IT&apos;S GONE 
WELL GENERALLY.                 
BUT JUST TO BE REALISTIC, THE   

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.105
WELL GENERALLY.                 
BUT JUST TO BE REALISTIC, THE   
YOU&apos;RE STACKING VERY IRREGULAR  

00:37:16.107 --> 00:37:19.909
BUT JUST TO BE REALISTIC, THE   
YOU&apos;RE STACKING VERY IRREGULAR  
STONES AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST  

00:37:19.911 --> 00:37:23.479
YOU&apos;RE STACKING VERY IRREGULAR  
STONES AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST  
CAN&apos;T GET THEM QUITE BACK AND   

00:37:23.481 --> 00:37:24.214
STONES AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST  
CAN&apos;T GET THEM QUITE BACK AND   
EXACT ORIENTATION THEY SAID     

00:37:24.216 --> 00:37:27.283
CAN&apos;T GET THEM QUITE BACK AND   
EXACT ORIENTATION THEY SAID     
THEY WOULD DO THEIR BEST TO GET 

00:37:27.285 --> 00:37:30.753
EXACT ORIENTATION THEY SAID     
THEY WOULD DO THEIR BEST TO GET 
IT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE.        

00:37:30.755 --> 00:37:34.924
THEY WOULD DO THEIR BEST TO GET 
IT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE.        
BUT I I CAN&apos;T PROMISE THAT THE  

00:37:34.926 --> 00:37:35.658
IT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE.        
BUT I I CAN&apos;T PROMISE THAT THE  
PERFECT ORIENTATION OF EVERY    

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.228
BUT I I CAN&apos;T PROMISE THAT THE  
PERFECT ORIENTATION OF EVERY    
SINGLE STONE YOU KNOW, I THINK  

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.063
PERFECT ORIENTATION OF EVERY    
SINGLE STONE YOU KNOW, I THINK  
TO TO THE BEST OF THEIR         

00:37:40.065 --> 00:37:42.766
SINGLE STONE YOU KNOW, I THINK  
TO TO THE BEST OF THEIR         
ABILITIES THEY WOULD THEY WOULD 

00:37:42.768 --> 00:37:43.700
TO TO THE BEST OF THEIR         
ABILITIES THEY WOULD THEY WOULD 
DO THAT AND AT THE VERY LEAST   

00:37:43.702 --> 00:37:46.969
ABILITIES THEY WOULD THEY WOULD 
DO THAT AND AT THE VERY LEAST   
GETTING THEM IN THE SAME        

00:37:46.971 --> 00:37:47.303
DO THAT AND AT THE VERY LEAST   
GETTING THEM IN THE SAME        
LOCATION.                       

00:37:47.305 --> 00:37:48.304
GETTING THEM IN THE SAME        
LOCATION.                       
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO KEEP  

00:37:48.306 --> 00:37:50.106
LOCATION.                       
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO KEEP  
IN MIND THERE THEY&apos;RE IRREGULAR 

00:37:50.108 --> 00:37:50.840
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO KEEP  
IN MIND THERE THEY&apos;RE IRREGULAR 
SHAPES AND THEY HAVE TO FIT     

00:37:50.842 --> 00:37:52.742
IN MIND THERE THEY&apos;RE IRREGULAR 
SHAPES AND THEY HAVE TO FIT     
TOGETHER ACROSS A VERY LARGE    

00:37:52.744 --> 00:37:56.645
SHAPES AND THEY HAVE TO FIT     
TOGETHER ACROSS A VERY LARGE    
LARGE AREA.                     

00:37:56.647 --> 00:38:00.683
TOGETHER ACROSS A VERY LARGE    
LARGE AREA.

DIFFERENT DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS 
I SEE DIFFERENT MORTAR JOINT    
WIDTHS AND I ALSO SEE DIFFERENT 

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.709
I SEE DIFFERENT MORTAR JOINT    
WIDTHS AND I ALSO SEE DIFFERENT 
DEPTHS OF RAKE RAKE IS THE HOW  

00:41:13.711 --> 00:41:14.476
WIDTHS AND I ALSO SEE DIFFERENT 
DEPTHS OF RAKE RAKE IS THE HOW  
MUCH OF THE MORTAR DO YOU BRUSH 

00:41:14.478 --> 00:41:15.077
DEPTHS OF RAKE RAKE IS THE HOW  
MUCH OF THE MORTAR DO YOU BRUSH 
AWAY TO CREATE A REVEAL         

00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:15.878
MUCH OF THE MORTAR DO YOU BRUSH 
AWAY TO CREATE A REVEAL         
SOMETIMES HAVE A VERY DEEP RAKE 

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.612
AWAY TO CREATE A REVEAL

WHERE THERE&apos;S LIKE A CREVICE    

00:41:16.614 --> 00:41:17.346
SOMETIMES HAVE A VERY DEEP RAKE 
WHERE THERE&apos;S LIKE A CREVICE    
BETWEEN THE STONES WHICH YOU

BETWEEN THE STONES WHICH YOU    
KNOW, CAST THEM IN HIGHER       
RELIEF BUT EXPOSES THE MORE     

00:41:18.616 --> 00:41:19.449
KNOW, CAST THEM IN HIGHER       
RELIEF BUT EXPOSES THE MORE     
WATER DAMAGE THEN AND THEN A    

00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:19.915
RELIEF BUT EXPOSES THE MORE     
WATER DAMAGE THEN AND THEN A    
VERY SHALLOW RAKE.

WATER DAMAGE THEN AND THEN A    
VERY SHALLOW RAKE.              
YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S ALMOST RIGHT     

00:41:20.652 --> 00:41:21.383
VERY SHALLOW RAKE.

WHAT WITH MORTAR JOINT I IT     
DOESN&apos;T SEEM TO ME LIKE WE WANT 
TO REPLICATE THE VARIETY        

00:41:50.281 --> 00:41:53.850
DOESN&apos;T SEEM TO ME LIKE WE WANT 
TO REPLICATE THE VARIETY        
OF MORTAR JOINT WIDTHS OR DEPTH 

00:41:53.852 --> 00:41:54.249
TO REPLICATE THE VARIETY        
OF MORTAR JOINT WIDTHS OR DEPTH 
OF RAKE.

SOMETHING CONSISTENT BUT IS     

00:41:55.787 --> 00:41:56.586
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE         
SOMETHING CONSISTENT BUT IS     
THERE A PREFERENCE THAT WE WANT 

00:41:56.588 --> 00:41:58.054
SOMETHING CONSISTENT BUT IS

00:41:58.056 --> 00:41:59.188
THERE A PREFERENCE THAT WE WANT 
TO SEE?                         
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO WE GO WITH THAT?    

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:02.091
TO SEE?                         
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO WE GO WITH THAT?    
CAN I JUST ONE PIECE            

00:42:02.093 --> 00:42:05.661
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO WE GO WITH THAT?    
CAN I JUST ONE PIECE            
OF INFORMATION WHICH IS I ALSO  

00:42:05.663 --> 00:42:06.596
CAN I JUST ONE PIECE            
OF INFORMATION WHICH IS I ALSO  
NOTICED THIS AND FROM MY        

00:42:06.598 --> 00:42:07.329
OF INFORMATION WHICH IS I ALSO  
NOTICED THIS AND FROM MY        
OBSERVATION ON THE NORTH THE    

00:42:07.331 --> 00:42:10.299
NOTICED THIS AND FROM MY        
OBSERVATION ON THE NORTH THE    
NORTH SIDE IS LIKE THE LEAST    

00:42:10.301 --> 00:42:13.770
OBSERVATION ON THE NORTH THE    
NORTH SIDE IS LIKE THE LEAST    
DISRUPTED MORTAR ON THE HOUSE   

00:42:13.772 --> 00:42:15.037
NORTH SIDE IS LIKE THE LEAST    
DISRUPTED MORTAR ON THE HOUSE   
AND YOU KNOW, SO I MEAN TO ME   

00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:17.240
DISRUPTED MORTAR ON THE HOUSE   
AND YOU KNOW, SO I MEAN TO ME   
THAT&apos;S THE CLOSEST TO ORIGINAL  

00:42:17.242 --> 00:42:18.041
AND YOU KNOW, SO I MEAN TO ME   
THAT&apos;S THE CLOSEST TO ORIGINAL  
JOIN WE HAVE AND REPLICATE      

00:42:18.043 --> 00:42:18.374
THAT&apos;S THE CLOSEST TO ORIGINAL  
JOIN WE HAVE AND REPLICATE      
THAT.                           

00:42:18.376 --> 00:42:22.044
JOIN WE HAVE AND REPLICATE      
THAT.                           
SO I WOULD PROBABLY YEAH THAT   

00:42:22.046 --> 00:42:22.812
THAT.                           
SO I WOULD PROBABLY YEAH THAT   
BUT IT&apos;S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT 

00:42:22.814 --> 00:42:25.114
SO I WOULD PROBABLY YEAH THAT   
BUT IT&apos;S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT 
LIKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STONE,  

00:42:25.116 --> 00:42:26.014
BUT IT&apos;S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT 
LIKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STONE,  
YOU KNOW, MIGHT HAVE A          

00:42:26.016 --> 00:42:26.749
LIKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STONE,  
YOU KNOW, MIGHT HAVE A          
DIFFERENT MORTAR JOINT LIKE     

00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:29.218
YOU KNOW, MIGHT HAVE A          
DIFFERENT MORTAR JOINT LIKE     
THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S STONE AND       

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.018
DIFFERENT MORTAR JOINT LIKE     
THERE&apos;S THERE&apos;S STONE AND       
THERE&apos;S THIS THESE VERY LARGE

THERE&apos;S THIS THESE VERY LARGE   
CUT STONES.                     
SO YOU KNOW, I COULD COULD      

00:42:36.795 --> 00:42:37.593
CUT STONES.                     
SO YOU KNOW, I COULD COULD      
CONSIDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE    

00:42:37.595 --> 00:42:41.230
SO YOU KNOW, I COULD COULD      
CONSIDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE    
YOU KNOW, A SPECIFIC JOINT USE  

00:42:41.232 --> 00:42:42.097
CONSIDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE    
YOU KNOW, A SPECIFIC JOINT USE  
FOR THE FIELD STONE AND A       

00:42:42.099 --> 00:42:42.765
YOU KNOW, A SPECIFIC JOINT USE  
FOR THE FIELD STONE AND A       
SPECIFIC JOINT FOR THE CUTS.    

00:42:42.767 --> 00:42:44.967
FOR THE FIELD STONE AND A       
SPECIFIC JOINT FOR THE CUTS.    
OH, I SEE.                      

00:42:44.969 --> 00:42:45.901

00:42:46.905 --> 00:42:49.171
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.         
I WAS THINKING MORE WITH THE    
FIELD STONE ITSELF.             

00:42:49.173 --> 00:42:49.539
I WAS THINKING MORE WITH THE    
FIELD STONE ITSELF.             
YEAH.                           

00:42:49.541 --> 00:42:50.739

DIFFERENT TYPE OF MORTAR JOINT  
FOR CUTS DOWN.                  

00:42:53.077 --> 00:42:53.842
DIFFERENT TYPE OF MORTAR JOINT  
FOR CUTS DOWN.                  
IT&apos;S EASIER TO MATCH BECAUSE    

00:42:53.844 --> 00:42:56.212
FOR CUTS DOWN.                  
IT&apos;S EASIER TO MATCH BECAUSE    
THE FACES OF AN MADE SMOOTH     

00:42:56.214 --> 00:43:00.116
IT&apos;S EASIER TO MATCH BECAUSE    
THE FACES OF AN MADE SMOOTH

CASE SCENARIO THERE&apos;S NOTHING   
THERE OTHER THAN A TWO BY FOUR. 

00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:28.164
CASE SCENARIO THERE&apos;S NOTHING   
THERE OTHER THAN A TWO BY FOUR. 
SO BUT IN ANY CASE YOU CAN SEE  

00:45:28.166 --> 00:45:28.897
THERE OTHER THAN A TWO BY FOUR. 
SO BUT IN ANY CASE YOU CAN SEE  
KIND OF WHERE THOSE EXISTING    

00:45:28.899 --> 00:45:31.367
SO BUT IN ANY CASE YOU CAN SEE  
KIND OF WHERE THOSE EXISTING    
ELEMENTS ARE.                   

00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:32.301
KIND OF WHERE THOSE EXISTING    
ELEMENTS ARE.                   
YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE OVERHANG   

00:45:32.303 --> 00:45:35.571
ELEMENTS ARE.                   
YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE OVERHANG   
WE BELIEVE JUST THE EXTENSION   

00:45:35.573 --> 00:45:36.338
YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE OVERHANG   
WE BELIEVE JUST THE EXTENSION   
OF THE RAFTER TAIL WITH A       

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.974
WE BELIEVE JUST THE EXTENSION   
OF THE RAFTER TAIL WITH A       
FASCIA BOARD AND THEN A SOFFIT  

00:45:38.976 --> 00:45:42.278
OF THE RAFTER TAIL WITH A       
FASCIA BOARD AND THEN A SOFFIT  
BENEATH THE SOFFIT IS A         

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.145
FASCIA BOARD AND THEN A SOFFIT  
BENEATH THE SOFFIT IS A         
FRETBOARD THAT GETS INTERRUPTED 

00:45:43.147 --> 00:45:47.282
BENEATH THE SOFFIT IS A         
FRETBOARD THAT GETS INTERRUPTED 
BY WINDOW TRIM.                 

00:45:47.284 --> 00:45:48.317
FRETBOARD THAT GETS INTERRUPTED 
BY WINDOW TRIM.                 
SO IN THIS SECTION YOU&apos;RE       

00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:50.786
BY WINDOW TRIM.                 
SO IN THIS SECTION YOU&apos;RE       
SEEING THE THE WINDOW TRIM      

00:45:50.788 --> 00:45:51.520
SO IN THIS SECTION YOU&apos;RE       
SEEING THE THE WINDOW TRIM      
WHICH IS NOT HISTORIC MATERIAL. 

00:45:51.522 --> 00:45:54.790
SEEING THE THE WINDOW TRIM      
WHICH IS NOT HISTORIC MATERIAL. 
IT&apos;S LIKE ALUMINUM WRAPPED TO   

00:45:54.792 --> 00:45:58.360
WHICH IS NOT HISTORIC MATERIAL. 
IT&apos;S LIKE ALUMINUM WRAPPED TO   
BUY MATERIAL WOOD MATERIAL.     

00:45:58.362 --> 00:45:59.428
IT&apos;S LIKE ALUMINUM WRAPPED TO   
BUY MATERIAL WOOD MATERIAL.     
AND AT THE TOP OF THAT THERE&apos;S  

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:02.898
BUY MATERIAL WOOD MATERIAL.     
AND AT THE TOP OF THAT THERE&apos;S  
A PIECE OF WOOD TRIM THAT DOES  

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:03.698
AND AT THE TOP OF THAT THERE&apos;S  
A PIECE OF WOOD TRIM THAT DOES  
RUN ALL ALONG THE SOFFIT        

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.769
A PIECE OF WOOD TRIM THAT DOES  
RUN ALL ALONG THE SOFFIT        
UNDERNEATH THE SOFFIT AND THAT  

00:46:06.771 --> 00:46:10.339
RUN ALL ALONG THE SOFFIT        
UNDERNEATH THE SOFFIT AND THAT  
RUNS AROUND THE WHOLE HOUSE.    

00:46:10.341 --> 00:46:11.273
UNDERNEATH THE SOFFIT AND THAT  
RUNS AROUND THE WHOLE HOUSE.    
THE FRETBOARD RUNS AROUND THE   

00:46:11.275 --> 00:46:11.740
RUNS AROUND THE WHOLE HOUSE.    
THE FRETBOARD RUNS AROUND THE   
WHOLE HOUSE.                    

00:46:11.742 --> 00:46:14.744
THE FRETBOARD RUNS AROUND THE   
WHOLE HOUSE.                    
BUT AS I SAID, IT GETS          

00:46:14.746 --> 00:46:15.544
WHOLE HOUSE.                    
BUT AS I SAID, IT GETS          
INTERRUPTED EVERY TIME THERE&apos;S  

00:46:15.546 --> 00:46:16.212
BUT AS I SAID, IT GETS          
INTERRUPTED EVERY TIME THERE&apos;S  
A WINDOW THE WINDOWS ARE RIGHT  

00:46:16.214 --> 00:46:18.046
INTERRUPTED EVERY TIME THERE&apos;S  
A WINDOW THE WINDOWS ARE RIGHT  
UP AGAINST USCIRF IT SO YOU     

00:46:18.048 --> 00:46:21.716
A WINDOW THE WINDOWS ARE RIGHT  
UP AGAINST USCIRF IT SO YOU     
KNOW OUR INTENTION IS TO        

00:46:21.718 --> 00:46:25.521
UP AGAINST USCIRF IT SO YOU     
KNOW OUR INTENTION IS TO        
REBUILD EVERYTHING ON THE

AND THEN IF WE COULD COULD WE   
ZOOM IN ON THE PROPOSED SECTION 
KIND OF IN THAT SAME LOCATION?  

00:47:26.417 --> 00:47:26.816
ZOOM IN ON THE PROPOSED SECTION 
KIND OF IN THAT SAME LOCATION?  
YES.

00:47:31.689 --> 00:47:34.824
A SEE OK, SO I WANT TO POINT    
OUT WE DID VERY FAINT.          
WE INDICATE THE EXISTING THE    

00:47:34.826 --> 00:47:41.530
OUT WE DID VERY FAINT.          
WE INDICATE THE EXISTING THE    
EXISTING TOPLANE WHICH IS JUST  

00:47:41.532 --> 00:47:45.367
WE INDICATE THE EXISTING THE    
EXISTING TOPLANE WHICH IS JUST  
IT&apos;S JUST ABOVE THE KIND OF TO

OF THE WALL.                    
IS EVERYBODY ABLE TO SEE THAT?  
SO THAT&apos;S THE EXISTING TOP WAY  

00:47:52.977 --> 00:47:53.308
IS EVERYBODY ABLE TO SEE THAT?  
SO THAT&apos;S THE EXISTING TOP WAY  
THERE.                          

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:54.043
SO THAT&apos;S THE EXISTING TOP WAY  
THERE.                          
SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO LOWER    

00:47:54.045 --> 00:47:56.311
THERE.                          
SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO LOWER    
THAT TOP PLATE APPROXIMATELY    

00:47:56.313 --> 00:48:00.549
SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO LOWER    
THAT TOP PLATE APPROXIMATELY    
FOUR INCHES TO GAIN ENOUGH      

00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:01.350
THAT TOP PLATE APPROXIMATELY    
FOUR INCHES TO GAIN ENOUGH      
SPACE FOR WHAT&apos;S CALLED AN      

00:48:01.352 --> 00:48:02.017
FOUR INCHES TO GAIN ENOUGH      
SPACE FOR WHAT&apos;S CALLED AN      
ENERGY HILL ON THE TRUSS.       

00:48:02.019 --> 00:48:04.686
SPACE FOR WHAT&apos;S CALLED AN      
ENERGY HILL ON THE TRUSS.       
SO THAT WILL JUST ALLOW FOR A   

00:48:04.688 --> 00:48:05.421
ENERGY HILL ON THE TRUSS.       
SO THAT WILL JUST ALLOW FOR A   
LITTLE MORE INSULATION IN THAT  

00:48:05.423 --> 00:48:08.323
SO THAT WILL JUST ALLOW FOR A   
LITTLE MORE INSULATION IN THAT  
IN THAT PART OF THE HOUSE AND   

00:48:08.325 --> 00:48:09.325
LITTLE MORE INSULATION IN THAT  
IN THAT PART OF THE HOUSE AND   
STILL LEAVES ROOM FOR A WINDOW  

00:48:09.327 --> 00:48:12.661
IN THAT PART OF THE HOUSE AND   
STILL LEAVES ROOM FOR A WINDOW  
HEADER IF WE NEED IT WITHOUT    

00:48:12.663 --> 00:48:13.528
STILL LEAVES ROOM FOR A WINDOW  
HEADER IF WE NEED IT WITHOUT    
CHANGING THE WINDOW AND THEN    

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:16.898
HEADER IF WE NEED IT WITHOUT    
CHANGING THE WINDOW AND THEN    
THE TAIL OF THAT NEW TRUSS      

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.502
CHANGING THE WINDOW AND THEN    
THE TAIL OF THAT NEW TRUSS      
WOULD EXTEND OUT JUST LIKE THE  

00:48:19.504 --> 00:48:20.369
THE TAIL OF THAT NEW TRUSS      
WOULD EXTEND OUT JUST LIKE THE  
RAFTER DOES NOW AS A TWO BY     

00:48:20.371 --> 00:48:23.839
WOULD EXTEND OUT JUST LIKE THE  
RAFTER DOES NOW AS A TWO BY     
FOUR AND BASICALLY GIVE US THE  

00:48:23.841 --> 00:48:24.573
RAFTER DOES NOW AS A TWO BY     
FOUR AND BASICALLY GIVE US THE  
SAME GEOMETRY THAT&apos;S THERE NOW. 

00:48:24.575 --> 00:48:27.375
FOUR AND BASICALLY GIVE US THE  
SAME GEOMETRY THAT&apos;S THERE NOW. 
SO JUST BE A MATTER PUTTING     

00:48:27.377 --> 00:48:28.343
SAME GEOMETRY THAT&apos;S THERE NOW. 
SO JUST BE A MATTER PUTTING     
EVERYTHING BACK, YOU KNOW, JUST

TOO COMPLICATED.                

00:48:35.953 --> 00:48:36.886
LIKE IT WAS SO IT SHOULDN&apos;T BE  
TOO COMPLICATED.                
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, GEOMETRICALLY 

00:48:36.888 --> 00:48:39.988
TOO COMPLICATED.                
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, GEOMETRICALLY 
ANYWAY IT&apos;S ALL TRYING TO BE    

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:43.458
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, GEOMETRICALLY 
ANYWAY IT&apos;S ALL TRYING TO BE    
WHAT WAS THERE NOW BUT BUT THE  

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.259
ANYWAY IT&apos;S ALL TRYING TO BE    
WHAT WAS THERE NOW BUT BUT THE  
STRUCTURE OF THE TRUSS JUST     

00:48:44.261 --> 00:48:47.963
WHAT WAS THERE NOW BUT BUT THE  
STRUCTURE OF THE TRUSS JUST     
ALLOWS US TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR  

00:48:47.965 --> 00:48:50.499
STRUCTURE OF THE TRUSS JUST     
ALLOWS US TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR  
PLAN FOR THE UPPER LEVEL AND    

00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:51.233
ALLOWS US TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR  
PLAN FOR THE UPPER LEVEL AND    
PROVIDE MORE CEILING HEIGHT     

00:48:51.235 --> 00:48:54.904
PLAN FOR THE UPPER LEVEL AND    
PROVIDE MORE CEILING HEIGHT     
WITHOUT HAVING A REALLY INTENSE 

00:48:54.906 --> 00:48:58.206
PROVIDE MORE CEILING HEIGHT     
WITHOUT HAVING A REALLY INTENSE 
NETWORK OF COLUMNS AND BEAMS    

00:48:58.208 --> 00:48:59.208
WITHOUT HAVING A REALLY INTENSE 
NETWORK OF COLUMNS AND BEAMS    
COMING DOWN THROUGH THE HOUSE.  

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:02.210
NETWORK OF COLUMNS AND BEAMS    
COMING DOWN THROUGH THE HOUSE.  
WE DID TRY WE DID DESIGN THIS   

00:49:02.212 --> 00:49:02.878
COMING DOWN THROUGH THE HOUSE.  
WE DID TRY WE DID DESIGN THIS   
THING WITHOUT THE TRUSSES AND   

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.214
WE DID TRY WE DID DESIGN THIS   
THING WITHOUT THE TRUSSES AND   
TRYING TO TRYING TO PRESERVE    

00:49:06.216 --> 00:49:07.048
THING WITHOUT THE TRUSSES AND   
TRYING TO TRYING TO PRESERVE    
THE EXISTING FRAMING AND IT     

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.453
TRYING TO TRYING TO PRESERVE    
THE EXISTING FRAMING AND IT     
JUST GOT TO BE QUITE THE        

00:49:10.455 --> 00:49:11.186
THE EXISTING FRAMING AND IT     
JUST GOT TO BE QUITE THE        
NETWORK OF COLUMNS AND BEAMS    

00:49:11.188 --> 00:49:14.189
JUST GOT TO BE QUITE THE        
NETWORK OF COLUMNS AND BEAMS    
AND AND REALLY STARTED          

00:49:14.191 --> 00:49:14.857
NETWORK OF COLUMNS AND BEAMS    
AND AND REALLY STARTED          
NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE SPACES 

00:49:14.859 --> 00:49:15.190
AND AND REALLY STARTED          
NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE SPACES 
BELOW.

NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE SPACES 
BELOW.                          
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF HOW WE GOT TO 

00:49:18.196 --> 00:49:22.398
BELOW.                          
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF HOW WE GOT TO 
THIS IDEA OF THE TRUSS.         

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.332
SO THAT&apos;S KIND OF HOW WE GOT TO 
THIS IDEA OF THE TRUSS.         
SO HOPEFULLY I&apos;VE ANSWERED YOUR 

00:49:23.334 --> 00:49:26.001
THIS IDEA OF THE TRUSS.

01:02:06.863 --> 01:02:09.063
THE FLOOR UP INTO THE ROOF SO   
THEY GAIN THAT SPACE.

01:02:09.065 --> 01:02:12.300
THEY GAIN THAT SPACE.           
BUT MOST OF THEM DO IT SOME     
OTHER WAY KEEPING THE RAFTERS   

01:02:12.302 --> 01:02:12.701

01:03:11.261 --> 01:03:12.127
CLOSER.                         
BUT WHAT THEY&apos;RE WHAT THEY&apos;VE   
GOT TO START WITH WHAT THEY&apos;RE  

01:03:12.129 --> 01:03:14.061
BUT WHAT THEY&apos;RE WHAT THEY&apos;VE   
GOT TO START WITH WHAT THEY&apos;RE  
WORKING WITH IS THE SMALLEST    

01:03:14.063 --> 01:03:14.662
GOT TO START WITH WHAT THEY&apos;RE  
WORKING WITH IS THE SMALLEST    
TYPE OF RAFTER WITH THE         

01:03:14.664 --> 01:03:17.932
WORKING WITH IS THE SMALLEST

GREATEST DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM. 

01:03:17.934 --> 01:03:19.234

GREATEST DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM. 
SO I THINK IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S I  

01:03:19.236 --> 01:03:22.470
GREATEST DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM. 
SO I THINK IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S I  
THINK IT&apos;S RISKY AS IT IS.      

01:03:22.472 --> 01:03:23.371
SO I THINK IT&apos;S I THINK IT&apos;S I  
THINK IT&apos;S RISKY AS IT IS.      
I THINK IT&apos;S I DON&apos;T THINK I

SO I MEAN FOR ME FROM A         
HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE, THERE WAS 

01:21:39.969 --> 01:21:41.635
SO I MEAN FOR ME FROM A         
HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE, THERE WAS 
A DAY WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE

01:21:42.638 --> 01:21:43.370
A DAY WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE

01:21:43.372 --> 01:21:46.806
STREET AND THERE&apos;S SMOKE OR GAS 
COMING OUT OF THESE CHIMNEYS    
AND THAT IS TO ME I THINK A     

01:21:46.808 --> 01:21:47.441
COMING OUT OF THESE CHIMNEYS    
AND THAT IS TO ME I THINK A     
PART OF THE CHARACTER OF THE    

01:21:47.443 --> 01:21:48.208
AND THAT IS TO ME I THINK A     
PART OF THE CHARACTER OF THE    
NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN YOU HAVE A    

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:49.876
PART OF THE CHARACTER OF THE    
NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN YOU HAVE A    
CHIMNEY.                        

01:21:49.878 --> 01:21:50.811
NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN YOU HAVE A    
CHIMNEY.                        
BUT IF YOU&apos;RE LIVING IN A       

01:21:50.813 --> 01:21:51.478
CHIMNEY.                        
BUT IF YOU&apos;RE LIVING IN A       
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THERE ARE    

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.114
BUT IF YOU&apos;RE LIVING IN A       
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THERE ARE    
ALL THESE CHIMNEYS AND          

01:21:54.116 --> 01:21:54.815
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THERE ARE    
ALL THESE CHIMNEYS AND          
NOTHING&apos;S COMING OUT OF THEM,   

01:21:54.817 --> 01:21:57.817
ALL THESE CHIMNEYS AND          
NOTHING&apos;S COMING OUT OF THEM,   
TO ME THAT&apos;S A VERY DIFFERENT A 

01:21:57.819 --> 01:21:58.318
NOTHING&apos;S COMING OUT OF THEM,   
TO ME THAT&apos;S A VERY DIFFERENT A 
DIFFERENT SITUATION.            

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.622
TO ME THAT&apos;S A VERY DIFFERENT A 
DIFFERENT SITUATION.            
I US AND SO I GUESS I JUST ASK  

01:22:02.624 --> 01:22:03.389
DIFFERENT SITUATION.            
I US AND SO I GUESS I JUST ASK  
YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THIS IS    

01:22:03.391 --> 01:22:05.259
I US AND SO I GUESS I JUST ASK  
YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THIS IS    
GOING TO THAT CHIMNEY AND WE&apos;RE 

01:22:05.261 --> 01:22:08.962
YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THIS IS    
GOING TO THAT CHIMNEY AND WE&apos;RE 
JUST WRAPPING IT UP.            

01:22:08.964 --> 01:22:09.830
GOING TO THAT CHIMNEY AND WE&apos;RE 
JUST WRAPPING IT UP.            
IT&apos;S NOT SERVING ANY FUNCTION   

01:22:09.832 --> 01:22:12.700
JUST WRAPPING IT UP.            
IT&apos;S NOT SERVING ANY FUNCTION   
FOR THE HOUSE.                  

01:22:12.702 --> 01:22:15.935
IT&apos;S NOT SERVING ANY FUNCTION   
FOR THE HOUSE.                  
SO THOSE THREE POINTS I THINK I 

01:22:15.937 --> 01:22:16.837
FOR THE HOUSE.                  
SO THOSE THREE POINTS I THINK I 
JUST ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THEM.  

01:22:16.839 --> 01:22:23.510
SO THOSE THREE POINTS I THINK I 
JUST ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THEM.  
I YOU KNOW, I&apos;M GENERALLY       

01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:38.692
                          VERY  
SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO         
PRESERVE THIS HOUSE ON THE      

01:22:38.694 --> 01:22:39.360
SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO         
PRESERVE THIS HOUSE ON THE      
EXTERIOR, YOU KNOW, REUSING     

01:22:39.362 --> 01:22:40.093
PRESERVE THIS HOUSE ON THE      
EXTERIOR, YOU KNOW, REUSING     
MATERIALS, SALVAGING WHAT WE    

01:22:40.095 --> 01:22:40.961
EXTERIOR, YOU KNOW, REUSING     
MATERIALS, SALVAGING WHAT WE    
CAN, PRESERVING THE CHARACTER.  

01:22:40.963 --> 01:22:42.029
MATERIALS, SALVAGING WHAT WE    
CAN, PRESERVING THE CHARACTER.  
BUT FOR ME THIS IS A VERY MINOR 

01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:42.763
CAN, PRESERVING THE CHARACTER.  
BUT FOR ME THIS IS A VERY MINOR 
FEATURE AND I THINK THE RISK    

01:22:42.765 --> 01:22:43.630
BUT FOR ME THIS IS A VERY MINOR 
FEATURE AND I THINK THE RISK    
DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE THE COST  

01:22:43.632 --> 01:22:44.097
FEATURE AND I THINK THE RISK    
DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE THE COST

IT JUST SEEMS TRICKY TO KNOW WE 
DON&apos;T WANT TO SAY MATCH RIGHT   

01:26:35.897 --> 01:26:39.032
IT JUST SEEMS TRICKY TO KNOW WE 
DON&apos;T WANT TO SAY MATCH RIGHT   
NOW THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO 

01:26:39.034 --> 01:26:45.939
DON&apos;T WANT TO SAY MATCH RIGHT   
NOW THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO 
USING USING THE NORTH SIDE      

01:26:45.941 --> 01:26:50.443
NOW THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO 
USING USING THE NORTH SIDE      
FOUNDATION WALL AS A WELL THE   

01:26:50.445 --> 01:26:54.848
USING USING THE NORTH SIDE      
FOUNDATION WALL AS A WELL THE   
NORSON FOUNDATION WELL HAS LIKE 

01:26:54.850 --> 01:26:55.449
FOUNDATION WALL AS A WELL THE   
NORSON FOUNDATION WELL HAS LIKE 
THE AXLER LIKE CUT STONE SO     

01:26:55.451 --> 01:26:58.184
NORSON FOUNDATION WELL HAS LIKE 
THE AXLER LIKE CUT STONE SO     
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR   

01:26:58.186 --> 01:26:58.985
THE AXLER LIKE CUT STONE SO     
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR   
THE OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE    

01:26:58.987 --> 01:26:59.318
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR   
THE OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE    
ARE THAT.                       

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.021
THE OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE    
ARE THAT.                       
BUT THEN THERE&apos;S THE MIX        

01:27:02.023 --> 01:27:05.291
ARE THAT.                       
BUT THEN THERE&apos;S THE MIX        
OF REGULAR STONE OR FIELD STONE 

01:27:05.293 --> 01:27:06.226
BUT THEN THERE&apos;S THE MIX        
OF REGULAR STONE OR FIELD STONE 
OR WHATEVER YOU WOULD CALL IT.  

01:27:06.228 --> 01:27:07.227
OF REGULAR STONE OR FIELD STONE 
OR WHATEVER YOU WOULD CALL IT.  
I THOUGHT THE ONE PICTURE WITH

OR WHATEVER YOU WOULD CALL IT.  
I THOUGHT THE ONE PICTURE WITH  
IT THAT WAS HADFIELD&apos;S STONE.   

01:27:09.364 --> 01:27:10.530
I THOUGHT THE ONE PICTURE WITH  
IT THAT WAS HADFIELD&apos;S STONE.   
&gt;&gt; YEAH THERE&apos;S SORT OF OK SO   

01:27:10.532 --> 01:27:13.466
IT THAT WAS HADFIELD&apos;S STONE.   
&gt;&gt; YEAH THERE&apos;S SORT OF OK SO   
WHAT DOES THIS SAY THIS DOESN&apos;T 

01:27:13.468 --> 01:27:17.270
&gt;&gt; YEAH THERE&apos;S SORT OF OK SO   
WHAT DOES THIS SAY THIS DOESN&apos;T 
OH DUPLICATING OLD MORTAR IN

WHAT DOES THIS SAY THIS DOESN&apos;T 
OH DUPLICATING OLD MORTAR IN

01:27:20.208 --> 01:27:27.513
OH DUPLICATING OLD MORTAR IN

CAN WE JUST SAY AND MORTAR AND  

01:27:27.515 --> 01:27:31.784
THE COMPOSITION COLOR TEXTURE   
CAN WE JUST SAY AND MORTAR AND  
MORTAR AS A AS APPROPRIATE IN   

01:27:31.786 --> 01:27:35.489
CAN WE JUST SAY AND MORTAR AND  
MORTAR AS A AS APPROPRIATE IN   
THE ANN ARBOR HISTORIC DISTRICT 

01:27:35.491 --> 01:27:36.289
MORTAR AS A AS APPROPRIATE IN   
THE ANN ARBOR HISTORIC DISTRICT 
DESIGN GUIDELINES IS THAT TOO   

01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:39.225
THE ANN ARBOR HISTORIC DISTRICT 
DESIGN GUIDELINES IS THAT TOO   
BIG FOR EVERYONE OR.            

01:27:39.227 --> 01:27:40.427
DESIGN GUIDELINES IS THAT TOO   
BIG FOR EVERYONE OR.            
OH I THINK THERE HAS TO BE I    

01:27:40.429 --> 01:27:41.360
BIG FOR EVERYONE OR.            
OH I THINK THERE HAS TO BE I    
THINK THERE HAS TO BE AN        

01:27:41.362 --> 01:27:43.763
OH I THINK THERE HAS TO BE I    
THINK THERE HAS TO BE AN        
ELEMENT OF FLEXIBILITY TO IT.   

01:27:43.765 --> 01:27:44.531
THINK THERE HAS TO BE AN        
ELEMENT OF FLEXIBILITY TO IT.   
YOU KNOW, I&apos;M ABSOLUTELY        

01:27:44.533 --> 01:27:47.133
ELEMENT OF FLEXIBILITY TO IT.   
YOU KNOW, I&apos;M ABSOLUTELY        
TALKING ABOUT THE ODD SHAPED    

01:27:47.135 --> 01:27:48.335
YOU KNOW, I&apos;M ABSOLUTELY        
TALKING ABOUT THE ODD SHAPED

01:27:48.337 --> 01:27:50.270
TALKING ABOUT THE ODD SHAPED    
STONE, YOU KNOW, I THINK RIGHT. 
SO THAT WOULD BE SORT OF BROAD  

01:27:50.272 --> 01:27:51.137
STONE, YOU KNOW, I THINK RIGHT. 
SO THAT WOULD BE SORT OF BROAD  
SOMETHING IN THERE ABOUT IT BUT 

01:27:51.139 --> 01:27:54.374
SO THAT WOULD BE SORT OF BROAD  
SOMETHING IN THERE ABOUT IT BUT 
BROAD ENOUGH THAT THEY COULD    

01:27:54.376 --> 01:27:54.775
SOMETHING IN THERE ABOUT IT BUT 
BROAD ENOUGH THAT THEY COULD    
ACHIEVE IT.                     

01:27:54.777 --> 01:27:55.875
BROAD ENOUGH THAT THEY COULD    
ACHIEVE IT.                     
YES, I THINK THAT CASEY SAID    

01:27:55.877 --> 01:27:58.512
ACHIEVE IT.                     
YES, I THINK THAT CASEY SAID    
SOMETHING JUST CONVERSATION     

01:27:58.514 --> 01:27:59.312
YES, I THINK THAT CASEY SAID    
SOMETHING JUST CONVERSATION     
THAT WE BROUGHT THIS UP THAT I  

01:27:59.314 --> 01:28:02.349
SOMETHING JUST CONVERSATION     
THAT WE BROUGHT THIS UP THAT I  
THOUGHT MADE SENSE WHICH WAS    

01:28:02.351 --> 01:28:03.149
THAT WE BROUGHT THIS UP THAT I  
THOUGHT MADE SENSE WHICH WAS    
LOOKING AT THE EXISTING         

01:28:03.151 --> 01:28:05.885
THOUGHT MADE SENSE WHICH WAS    
LOOKING AT THE EXISTING         
FOUNDATION FOR THE OLDEST AND   

01:28:05.887 --> 01:28:06.686
LOOKING AT THE EXISTING         
FOUNDATION FOR THE OLDEST AND   
LEAST DISTURBED PORTION OF THE  

01:28:06.688 --> 01:28:10.624
FOUNDATION FOR THE OLDEST AND   
LEAST DISTURBED PORTION OF THE  
FIELDSTONE WALL AND THEN        

01:28:10.626 --> 01:28:11.357
LEAST DISTURBED PORTION OF THE  
FIELDSTONE WALL AND THEN        
EMULATING IT BECAUSE I THINK    

01:28:11.359 --> 01:28:12.125
FIELDSTONE WALL AND THEN        
EMULATING IT BECAUSE I THINK    
WHAT WE&apos;RE REALLY TRYING TO     

01:28:12.127 --> 01:28:13.993
EMULATING IT BECAUSE I THINK    
WHAT WE&apos;RE REALLY TRYING TO     
AVOID IS IS MATCHING TO THE     

01:28:13.995 --> 01:28:14.728
WHAT WE&apos;RE REALLY TRYING TO     
AVOID IS IS MATCHING TO THE     
REALLY SLOPPILY REPAIRED THINGS 

01:28:14.730 --> 01:28:17.697
AVOID IS IS MATCHING TO THE     
REALLY SLOPPILY REPAIRED THINGS 
THAT HAVE BEEN DONE PATCHWORK   

01:28:17.699 --> 01:28:18.398
REALLY SLOPPILY REPAIRED THINGS 
THAT HAVE BEEN DONE PATCHWORK   
NILLY OVER TIME THAT THEIR      

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.801
THAT HAVE BEEN DONE PATCHWORK   
NILLY OVER TIME THAT THEIR      
WORKPLACES I REMEMBER THEM I    

01:28:21.803 --> 01:28:22.568
NILLY OVER TIME THAT THEIR      
WORKPLACES I REMEMBER THEM I    
DON&apos;T REMEMBER WHERE THERE WERE 

01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:25.104
WORKPLACES I REMEMBER THEM I    
DON&apos;T REMEMBER WHERE THERE WERE 
PLACES WHERE THE FIELDS LOOKED  

01:28:25.106 --> 01:28:26.039
DON&apos;T REMEMBER WHERE THERE WERE 
PLACES WHERE THE FIELDS LOOKED  
PRETTY MUCH ORIGINAL AND AND    

01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:29.843
PLACES WHERE THE FIELDS LOOKED  
PRETTY MUCH ORIGINAL AND AND    
THOSE THOSE MORTAR JOINTS WERE  

01:28:29.845 --> 01:28:30.243
PRETTY MUCH ORIGINAL AND AND    
THOSE THOSE MORTAR JOINTS WERE  
CONSISTENT.                     

01:28:30.245 --> 01:28:31.110
THOSE THOSE MORTAR JOINTS WERE  
CONSISTENT.                     
SO IF WE JUST SORT OF RIPPED    

01:28:31.112 --> 01:28:34.014
CONSISTENT.                     
SO IF WE JUST SORT OF RIPPED    
OFF OF THAT, I THINK THAT WORKS 

01:28:34.016 --> 01:28:34.347
SO IF WE JUST SORT OF RIPPED    
OFF OF THAT, I THINK THAT WORKS 
WELL.                           

01:28:34.349 --> 01:28:35.248
