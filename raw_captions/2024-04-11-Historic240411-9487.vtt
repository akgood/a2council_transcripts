WITH THE SAFETY OF THE TREE.    
ONE OF THE THING THAT CAME UP   
IN CONVERSATION WAS IF          

00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:25.465
ONE OF THE THING THAT CAME UP   
IN CONVERSATION WAS IF

00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:27.867
IN CONVERSATION WAS IF          
SOMETHING WERE TO BE DONE IN    
THAT DRIVEWAY, IF IT WOULDN'T

OR ASK FOR THERE TO BE A        
CONSTRUCTIVE END POINT TO THE   

00:14:35.143 --> 00:14:35.908
OR ASK FOR THERE TO BE A        
CONSTRUCTIVE END POINT TO THE   
DRIVEWAY LIKE A LIKE A BERM OR  

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.911
CONSTRUCTIVE END POINT TO THE   
DRIVEWAY LIKE A LIKE A BERM OR  
LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE CURBS IN 

00:14:38.913 --> 00:14:39.579
DRIVEWAY LIKE A LIKE A BERM OR  
LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE CURBS IN

00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:42.848
LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE CURBS IN 
PARKING LOTS SO THAT IT         
COULDN'T EASILY BE DRIVEN PAST  

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.253
PARKING LOTS SO THAT IT         
COULDN'T EASILY BE DRIVEN PAST  
WE I I DON'T KNOW IF I SAID IT  

00:14:47.255 --> 00:14:47.820
COULDN'T EASILY BE DRIVEN PAST  
WE I I DON'T KNOW IF I SAID IT

WE I I DON'T KNOW IF I SAID IT  
OUT LOUD TO JENNIFER.           
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE IDEA   

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:50.223
OUT LOUD TO JENNIFER.           
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE IDEA   
OF IF IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN    

00:14:50.225 --> 00:14:50.924
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE IDEA   
OF IF IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN    
COULD IT BE PAVERS AS OPPOSED   

00:14:50.926 --> 00:14:53.994
OF IF IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN    
COULD IT BE PAVERS AS OPPOSED   
TO CONCRETE OR AN EXTENSION     

00:14:53.996 --> 00:15:00.367
COULD IT BE PAVERS AS OPPOSED   
TO CONCRETE OR AN EXTENSION     
OF CONCRETE BECAUSE PAVERS      

00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:16.616
                           AND  
I'M NOT I'M PRETTY SURE PAVERS  
REQUIRE LESS OF A BED YOU DON'T 

00:15:16.618 --> 00:15:17.416
I'M NOT I'M PRETTY SURE PAVERS  
REQUIRE LESS OF A BED YOU DON'T 
TO DIG DOWN AS DEEP TO          

00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:17.951
REQUIRE LESS OF A BED YOU DON'T 
TO DIG DOWN AS DEEP TO          
FACILITATE A BRICK PAPER        

00:15:17.953 --> 00:15:18.684
TO DIG DOWN AS DEEP TO          
FACILITATE A BRICK PAPER        
DRIVEWAY AS YOU WOULD IF YOU    

00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:19.285
FACILITATE A BRICK PAPER        
DRIVEWAY AS YOU WOULD IF YOU    
PUT IN EIGHT INCHES             

00:15:19.287 --> 00:15:20.019
DRIVEWAY AS YOU WOULD IF YOU    
PUT IN EIGHT INCHES             
OF LIMESTONE AND THEN POURED    

00:15:20.021 --> 00:15:20.753
PUT IN EIGHT INCHES             
OF LIMESTONE AND THEN POURED    
CONCRETE AT THE TOP OF IT AND   

00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:21.454
OF LIMESTONE AND THEN POURED    
CONCRETE AT THE TOP OF IT AND   
SO EXCAVATING FOR THE PURPOSES  

00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:22.055
CONCRETE AT THE TOP OF IT AND   
SO EXCAVATING FOR THE PURPOSES  
OF A CONCRETE DRIVEWAY COULD    

00:15:22.057 --> 00:15:22.789
SO EXCAVATING FOR THE PURPOSES  
OF A CONCRETE DRIVEWAY COULD    
DAMAGE THE ROOT SYSTEM OF A     

00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:23.590
OF A CONCRETE DRIVEWAY COULD    
DAMAGE THE ROOT SYSTEM OF A     
TREE IF IT HAS SHALLOW ROOTS.   

00:15:23.592 --> 00:15:24.056
DAMAGE THE ROOT SYSTEM OF A     
TREE IF IT HAS SHALLOW ROOTS.   
SO THERE WAS A LOT              

00:15:24.058 --> 00:15:24.723

THAT'S NOT OUR THING.           
I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH EXTENDING  
A CONCRETE DRIVEWAY INTO THE    

00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:23.361
I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH EXTENDING  
A CONCRETE DRIVEWAY INTO THE    
ROOT ZONE OF THAT MAPLE TREE.   

00:34:23.363 --> 00:34:24.096
A CONCRETE DRIVEWAY INTO THE

IT'S A SHALLOW ROOTED TREE.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:34.206
KILL THE TREE OR THE TREE ROOTS 
ARE GOING TO RUIN THE CONCRETE. 
I'D BE OK WITH IT IF IT WERE    

00:34:34.208 --> 00:34:34.606
ARE GOING TO RUIN THE CONCRETE. 
I'D BE OK WITH IT IF IT WERE    
JUST GRAVEL.                    

00:34:34.608 --> 00:34:35.674
I'D BE OK WITH IT IF IT WERE    
JUST GRAVEL.                    
I THINK THERE'S A GREAT AND IF  

00:34:35.676 --> 00:34:38.876
JUST GRAVEL.                    
I THINK THERE'S A GREAT AND IF  
YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE HOUSES 

00:34:38.878 --> 00:34:42.747
I THINK THERE'S A GREAT AND IF  
YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE HOUSES 
TO THE EAST OF THAT PROPERTY,   

00:34:42.749 --> 00:34:46.384
YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE HOUSES 
TO THE EAST OF THAT PROPERTY,   
THEY HAVE GRAVEL DRIVEWAYS OR   

00:34:46.386 --> 00:34:47.119
TO THE EAST OF THAT PROPERTY,   
THEY HAVE GRAVEL DRIVEWAYS OR   
COMBINATION DIRT GRASS, GRAVEL  

00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:49.888
THEY HAVE GRAVEL DRIVEWAYS OR   
COMBINATION DIRT GRASS, GRAVEL  
DRIVEWAYS ACROSS THE STREET.    

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:53.759
COMBINATION DIRT GRASS, GRAVEL  
DRIVEWAYS ACROSS THE STREET.    
THERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF OF A 

00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:57.262
DRIVEWAYS ACROSS THE STREET.    
THERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF OF A 
GRAVEL DRIVEWAY THAT WOULD BE   

00:34:57.264 --> 00:34:58.230
THERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF OF A 
GRAVEL DRIVEWAY THAT WOULD BE   
FINE AND I WOULD THINK          

00:34:58.232 --> 00:34:58.897
GRAVEL DRIVEWAY THAT WOULD BE   
FINE AND I WOULD THINK          
ULTIMATELY COULD BE COMPATIBLE. 

00:34:58.899 --> 00:35:02.000
FINE AND I WOULD THINK          
ULTIMATELY COULD BE COMPATIBLE. 
BUT I THINK EXTENDING A GIANT   

00:35:02.002 --> 00:35:05.370
ULTIMATELY COULD BE COMPATIBLE. 
BUT I THINK EXTENDING A GIANT   
CONCRETE SLAB BACK THERE IS NOT 

00:35:05.372 --> 00:35:06.071
BUT I THINK EXTENDING A GIANT   
CONCRETE SLAB BACK THERE IS NOT 
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING WE JUST

00:38:27.207 --> 00:38:27.639
SAY IT'S WITH THE ADDITION OF A 
ROW OF BUMPER BLOCKS AT THE END 
OF THE DRIVEWAY.                

00:38:27.641 --> 00:38:28.606
ROW OF BUMPER BLOCKS AT THE END 
OF THE DRIVEWAY.                
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY  

00:38:28.608 --> 00:38:29.140
OF THE DRIVEWAY.                
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY  
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

YOU KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY  
STRAIGHTFORWARD.                
WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE.

STRAIGHTFORWARD.                
WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE.         
SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT PLANTERS   

00:38:31.245 --> 00:38:34.512
WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE.         
SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT PLANTERS   
THERE OR SOMETHING BUT I THINK  

00:38:34.514 --> 00:38:38.083
SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT PLANTERS   
THERE OR SOMETHING BUT I THINK  
BUMPER BLOCKS ARE THE EASIEST   

00:38:38.085 --> 00:38:39.217
THERE OR SOMETHING BUT I THINK  
BUMPER BLOCKS ARE THE EASIEST   
BUT DON'T CHANGE IT TOO MUCH.   

00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:43.054
BUMPER BLOCKS ARE THE EASIEST   
BUT DON'T CHANGE IT TOO MUCH.   
>> YOU I ACTUALLY THINK IF THAT 

00:38:43.056 --> 00:38:46.858
BUT DON'T CHANGE IT TOO MUCH.   
>> YOU I ACTUALLY THINK IF THAT 
IS LIKE IF THAT'S A CONCERN     

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.592
>> YOU I ACTUALLY THINK IF THAT 
IS LIKE IF THAT'S A CONCERN     
OF THE COMMISSIONERS, I THINK   

00:38:47.594 --> 00:38:49.393
IS LIKE IF THAT'S A CONCERN     
OF THE COMMISSIONERS, I THINK   
THAT THE TREE ITSELF IS         

00:38:49.395 --> 00:38:50.262
OF THE COMMISSIONERS, I THINK   
THAT THE TREE ITSELF IS         
ACTUALLY THE BUMPER BLOCKS HERE 

00:38:50.264 --> 00:38:53.798
THAT THE TREE ITSELF IS         
ACTUALLY THE BUMPER BLOCKS HERE 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW IT'S 

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.732
ACTUALLY THE BUMPER BLOCKS HERE 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW IT'S 
DRAWN, THE TREE IS KIND OF OFF  

00:38:54.734 --> 00:38:57.668
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW IT'S 
DRAWN, THE TREE IS KIND OF OFF  
TO THE SIDE ON ALMOST ON THE    

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.036
DRAWN, THE TREE IS KIND OF OFF  
TO THE SIDE ON ALMOST ON THE    
PROPERTY LINE.                  

00:38:58.038 --> 00:39:00.738
TO THE SIDE ON ALMOST ON THE    
PROPERTY LINE.                  
BUT WHEN YOU'RE THERE THAT TREE 

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.573
PROPERTY LINE.                  
BUT WHEN YOU'RE THERE THAT TREE 
LIKE I WAS STANDING RIGHT ON    

00:39:01.575 --> 00:39:04.576
BUT WHEN YOU'RE THERE THAT TREE 
LIKE I WAS STANDING RIGHT ON    
THE EDGE OF THE DRIVEWAY TODAY  

00:39:04.578 --> 00:39:05.376
LIKE I WAS STANDING RIGHT ON    
THE EDGE OF THE DRIVEWAY TODAY  
AND LOOKING BACK AND THE TREE   

00:39:05.378 --> 00:39:08.613
THE EDGE OF THE DRIVEWAY TODAY  
AND LOOKING BACK AND THE TREE   
IS LIKE WITHIN THE DRIVEWAY     

00:39:08.615 --> 00:39:09.014
AND LOOKING BACK AND THE TREE   
IS LIKE WITHIN THE DRIVEWAY     
ITSELF.

IS LIKE WITHIN THE DRIVEWAY     
ITSELF.

00:39:09.782 --> 00:39:12.150
ITSELF.                         
SO IF THEY'RE GOING STRAIGHT    
BACK AND THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE 

00:39:12.152 --> 00:39:15.553
SO IF THEY'RE GOING STRAIGHT    
BACK AND THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE 
FIVE FEET FROM THE TREE THAT

00:41:25.185 --> 00:41:28.919
THEN IF YOU GO YOU GO UP TO     
TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE THERE 
WAS LIKE ONE WHERE IT LOOKED    

00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:29.687
TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE THERE 
WAS LIKE ONE WHERE IT LOOKED    
LIKE SOMEONE HAD ACTUALLY       

00:41:29.689 --> 00:41:30.354
WAS LIKE ONE WHERE IT LOOKED    
LIKE SOMEONE HAD ACTUALLY       
PLANTED GRASS THERE AND IT      

00:41:30.356 --> 00:41:33.324
LIKE SOMEONE HAD ACTUALLY       
PLANTED GRASS THERE AND IT      
MAYBE WAS A SHADOW BUT THE TWO  

00:41:33.326 --> 00:41:34.091
PLANTED GRASS THERE AND IT      
MAYBE WAS A SHADOW BUT THE TWO  
TRACK WASN'T THERE AND THEN ALL 

00:41:34.093 --> 00:41:37.328
MAYBE WAS A SHADOW BUT THE TWO  
TRACK WASN'T THERE AND THEN ALL 
OF THE OTHER ONES DO SHOW A TWO 

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.864
TRACK WASN'T THERE AND THEN ALL 
OF THE OTHER ONES DO SHOW A TWO 
TRACK AFTER THE CONCRETE.       

00:41:39.866 --> 00:41:41.199
OF THE OTHER ONES DO SHOW A TWO 
TRACK AFTER THE CONCRETE.       
SO IN MY READING OF THAT THIS   

00:41:41.201 --> 00:41:45.537
TRACK AFTER THE CONCRETE.       
SO IN MY READING OF THAT THIS   
WAS I MEAN IT'D BE NICE IF      

00:41:45.539 --> 00:41:46.470
SO IN MY READING OF THAT THIS   
WAS I MEAN IT'D BE NICE IF      
THERE WAS A PHOTO WITH THE      

00:41:46.472 --> 00:41:49.641
WAS I MEAN IT'D BE NICE IF      
THERE WAS A PHOTO WITH THE      
SMOKING OF A CAR THERE FROM     

00:41:49.643 --> 00:41:52.443
THERE WAS A PHOTO WITH THE      
SMOKING OF A CAR THERE FROM     
FROM NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN OR    

00:41:52.445 --> 00:41:53.044
SMOKING OF A CAR THERE FROM     
FROM NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN OR    
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            

00:41:53.046 --> 00:41:53.778
FROM NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN OR    
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            
>> BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS  

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.281
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.            
>> BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS  
WAS USED AS PARKING THROUGHOUT  

00:41:57.283 --> 00:42:00.951
>> BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS  
WAS USED AS PARKING THROUGHOUT  
THE HISTORY OF THIS HOUSE.      

00:42:00.953 --> 00:42:02.019
WAS USED AS PARKING THROUGHOUT  
THE HISTORY OF THIS HOUSE.      
SO SO THE WAY I'M READING THAT  

00:42:02.021 --> 00:42:05.423
THE HISTORY OF THIS HOUSE.      
SO SO THE WAY I'M READING THAT  
IS THAT THIS IS MORE OF A       

00:42:05.425 --> 00:42:06.090
SO SO THE WAY I'M READING THAT  
IS THAT THIS IS MORE OF A       
CHANGE IN MATERIAL THAN A       

00:42:06.092 --> 00:42:09.260
IS THAT THIS IS MORE OF A       
CHANGE IN MATERIAL THAN A       
CHANGE IN USE AND I THINK THAT  

00:42:09.262 --> 00:42:12.730
CHANGE IN MATERIAL THAN A       
CHANGE IN USE AND I THINK THAT  
I WOULD PREFER OTHER MATERIALS  

00:42:12.732 --> 00:42:17.034
CHANGE IN USE AND I THINK THAT  
I WOULD PREFER OTHER MATERIALS  
BUT TO ME CONCRETE IS LIKE THE  

00:42:17.036 --> 00:42:17.902
I WOULD PREFER OTHER MATERIALS  
BUT TO ME CONCRETE IS LIKE THE  
WAY I'M JUST READING ALL THIS   

00:42:17.904 --> 00:42:20.938
BUT TO ME CONCRETE IS LIKE THE  
WAY I'M JUST READING ALL THIS

STANDARDS.                      
IT'S IT'S A CASE BY CASE AND I  

00:42:28.148 --> 00:42:28.813

IT'S IT'S A CASE BY CASE AND I  
UNDERSTAND THE THE OTHER        

00:42:28.815 --> 00:42:29.547
IT'S IT'S A CASE BY CASE AND I  
UNDERSTAND THE THE OTHER        
ARGUMENTS HERE AS WELL THOUGH   

00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:32.783

00:42:32.785 --> 00:42:36.588
ARGUMENTS HERE AS WELL THOUGH   
SO I DO BELIEVE THIS IS A       
TRICKY ONE THAT WAS MORE OF MY

SO IF SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO

OWNER THE HOMEOWNER IS VERY     
AMENABLE TO EITHER DOOR I THINK 

01:14:11.449 --> 01:14:14.584
OWNER THE HOMEOWNER IS VERY     
AMENABLE TO EITHER DOOR I THINK 
SO IF THAT'S YOUR ISSUE, IF     

01:14:14.586 --> 01:14:15.451
AMENABLE TO EITHER DOOR I THINK 
SO IF THAT'S YOUR ISSUE, IF     
IT'S THE WRONG DOOR, THEY'LL BE 

01:14:15.453 --> 01:14:15.985
SO IF THAT'S YOUR ISSUE, IF     
IT'S THE WRONG DOOR, THEY'LL BE 
FINE WITH EITHER DOOR.          

01:14:15.987 --> 01:14:19.054
IT'S THE WRONG DOOR, THEY'LL BE 
FINE WITH EITHER DOOR.          
I THINK THAT'S CLEAR FROM       

01:14:19.056 --> 01:14:19.289
FINE WITH EITHER DOOR.          
I THINK THAT'S CLEAR FROM       
THERE.                          

01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:20.223
I THINK THAT'S CLEAR FROM       
THERE.                          
>> I THINK WELL AND THAT'S WHY  

01:14:20.225 --> 01:14:23.058
THERE.                          
>> I THINK WELL AND THAT'S WHY  
I GET I'M NOT REALLY SURE I     

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:23.826
>> I THINK WELL AND THAT'S WHY  
I GET I'M NOT REALLY SURE I     
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS GOING TO 

01:14:23.828 --> 01:14:24.160
I GET I'M NOT REALLY SURE I     
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS GOING TO 
LOOK.                           

01:14:24.162 --> 01:14:25.561

LOOK.                           
I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE PLANE   

01:14:25.563 --> 01:14:26.528
LOOK.                           
I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE PLANE   
THE DOOR IS GOING TO BE IN      

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:26.763
I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE PLANE   
THE DOOR IS GOING TO BE IN      
UTAH.                           

01:14:26.765 --> 01:14:29.398
THE DOOR IS GOING TO BE IN      
UTAH.                           
>> THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE BUT 

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.332
UTAH.                           
>> THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE BUT 
IT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE IT'S A    

01:14:30.334 --> 01:14:33.536
>> THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE BUT 
IT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE IT'S A    
CHANGE THAT IT'S NOT PART       

01:14:33.538 --> 01:14:34.336
IT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE IT'S A    
CHANGE THAT IT'S NOT PART       
OF THE ORIGINAL HOUSE BECAUSE   

01:14:34.338 --> 01:14:37.673
CHANGE THAT IT'S NOT PART       
OF THE ORIGINAL HOUSE BECAUSE   
IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT HOW THE     

01:14:37.675 --> 01:14:38.408
OF THE ORIGINAL HOUSE BECAUSE   
IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT HOW THE     
HOUSE WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT.     

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:41.143
IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT HOW THE     
HOUSE WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT.     
SO IT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE IT WAS 

01:14:41.145 --> 01:14:47.884
HOUSE WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT.     
SO IT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE IT WAS 
A CHANGE OR THAT IT'S NEW       

01:14:48.152 --> 01:14:53.489
                         .      
I I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE      
SAYING 100 PERCENT.             

01:14:53.491 --> 01:14:56.159
I I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE      
SAYING 100 PERCENT.             
I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY     

01:14:56.161 --> 01:14:56.959
SAYING 100 PERCENT.             
I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY     
TRICKY APPLICATION FOR FOR A    

01:14:56.961 --> 01:14:59.729
I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY     
TRICKY APPLICATION FOR FOR A    
LOT OF REASONS.                 

01:14:59.731 --> 01:15:00.663
TRICKY APPLICATION FOR FOR A    
LOT OF REASONS.                 
ONE, IT'S THIS SINGULAR         

01:15:00.665 --> 01:15:03.933
LOT OF REASONS.                 
ONE, IT'S THIS SINGULAR         
HISTORIC DISTRICT AND WE DON'T  

01:15:03.935 --> 01:15:07.336
ONE, IT'S THIS SINGULAR         
HISTORIC DISTRICT AND WE DON'T  
HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT THIS  

01:15:07.338 --> 01:15:11.374
HISTORIC DISTRICT AND WE DON'T  
HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT THIS  
THE FIRST APPLICATION OF THIS   

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:11.774
HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT THIS  
THE FIRST APPLICATION OF THIS   
THIS SYSTEM.                    

01:15:11.776 --> 01:15:12.241
THE FIRST APPLICATION OF THIS   
THIS SYSTEM.                    
>> YEAH.                        

01:15:12.243 --> 01:15:15.712
THIS SYSTEM.                    
>> YEAH.                        
AND SO SO FOR THAT REASON IT'S  

01:15:15.714 --> 01:15:15.979
>> YEAH.                        
AND SO SO FOR THAT REASON IT'S  
NEW.                            

01:15:15.981 --> 01:15:16.779
AND SO SO FOR THAT REASON IT'S  
NEW.                            
I THINK ANOTHER REASON THAT     

01:15:16.781 --> 01:15:19.015
NEW.                            
I THINK ANOTHER REASON THAT     
MAKES IT TRICKY IS THAT THIS IS 

01:15:19.017 --> 01:15:19.749
I THINK ANOTHER REASON THAT     
MAKES IT TRICKY IS THAT THIS IS 
ON A FRONT FACING ELEVATION.    

01:15:19.751 --> 01:15:23.085
MAKES IT TRICKY IS THAT THIS IS 
ON A FRONT FACING ELEVATION.    
IT'S A CHANGE ON A ELEVATION    

01:15:23.087 --> 01:15:23.686
ON A FRONT FACING ELEVATION.    
IT'S A CHANGE ON A ELEVATION    
THAT FACES THE STREET.          

01:15:23.688 --> 01:15:27.156
IT'S A CHANGE ON A ELEVATION    
THAT FACES THE STREET.          
HOWEVER, IT'S LIKE THE          

01:15:27.158 --> 01:15:30.793
THAT FACES THE STREET.          
HOWEVER, IT'S LIKE THE          
SECONDARY ELEVATION OF THOSE    

01:15:30.795 --> 01:15:31.327
HOWEVER, IT'S LIKE THE          
SECONDARY ELEVATION OF THOSE    
TWO ELEVATIONS.                 

01:15:31.329 --> 01:15:35.197
SECONDARY ELEVATION OF THOSE    
TWO ELEVATIONS.                 
SO THAT'S THAT'S IN A WAY SORT  

01:15:35.199 --> 01:15:38.867
TWO ELEVATIONS.                 
SO THAT'S THAT'S IN A WAY SORT  
OF CONFLICTING ITEMS AND I      

01:15:38.869 --> 01:15:45.774
SO THAT'S THAT'S IN A WAY SORT  
OF CONFLICTING ITEMS AND I      
WOULD SAY THAT FOR ME THE I     

01:15:45.776 --> 01:15:46.442
OF CONFLICTING ITEMS AND I      
WOULD SAY THAT FOR ME THE I     
THINK THIS WILL LOOK QUITE      

01:15:46.444 --> 01:15:46.909
WOULD SAY THAT FOR ME THE I     
THINK THIS WILL LOOK QUITE      
DIFFERENT.                      

01:15:46.911 --> 01:15:50.312
THINK THIS WILL LOOK QUITE      
DIFFERENT.                      
I THINK TO ME A VOID IS A THING 

01:15:50.314 --> 01:15:53.483
DIFFERENT.                      
I THINK TO ME A VOID IS A THING 
LIKE JUST BECAUSE THERE'S       

01:15:53.485 --> 01:15:54.350
I THINK TO ME A VOID IS A THING 
LIKE JUST BECAUSE THERE'S       
NOTHING THERE YOU MIGHT GET     

01:15:54.352 --> 01:15:56.886
LIKE JUST BECAUSE THERE'S       
NOTHING THERE YOU MIGHT GET     
CONFUSED INTO THINKING IT'S     

01:15:56.888 --> 01:15:57.820
NOTHING THERE YOU MIGHT GET     
CONFUSED INTO THINKING IT'S     
NOTHING BUT IT'S A VOID WHICH

CONFUSED INTO THINKING IT'S     
NOTHING BUT IT'S A VOID WHICH   
IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW, YOU READ 

01:16:00.524 --> 01:16:01.590
NOTHING BUT IT'S A VOID WHICH   
IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW, YOU READ 
IT AS A VOID AND REALLY WHEN    

01:16:01.592 --> 01:16:05.227
IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW, YOU READ 
IT AS A VOID AND REALLY WHEN    
YOU SEE THAT HOUSE YOU SEE      

01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:08.698
IT AS A VOID AND REALLY WHEN    
YOU SEE THAT HOUSE YOU SEE      
HOUSE YOU SEE VOID AND THEN YOU 

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:09.565
YOU SEE THAT HOUSE YOU SEE      
HOUSE YOU SEE VOID AND THEN YOU 
KIND OF A GARAGE CARPORT THING  

01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:12.935

IF YOU PUT A DOOR THERE NOW YOU

IF YOU PUT A DOOR THERE NOW YOU 
DON'T HAVE THAT VOID AND IT'S   

01:16:13.704 --> 01:16:17.106
IF YOU PUT A DOOR THERE NOW YOU 
DON'T HAVE THAT VOID AND IT'S   
GOING TO LOOK VERY DIFFERENT.   

01:16:17.108 --> 01:16:19.809
DON'T HAVE THAT VOID AND IT'S   
GOING TO LOOK VERY DIFFERENT.   
IS IT DIFFERENT ENOUGH AND      

01:16:19.811 --> 01:16:23.545
GOING TO LOOK VERY DIFFERENT.   
IS IT DIFFERENT ENOUGH AND      
IMPORTANT ENOUGH CHANGE TO

SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT LITTLE     
PORTION OF THE HOUSE?

OF THE PLANTER BOXES IS A METAL 

01:28:06.983 --> 01:28:07.916
OF THE BUILDING AND INSIDE      
OF THE PLANTER BOXES IS A METAL 
GUARDRAIL THERE FOR THE SAME    

01:28:07.918 --> 01:28:14.856
OF THE PLANTER BOXES IS A METAL 
GUARDRAIL THERE FOR THE SAME    
REASON THIS IS THE BACK ALLEY

GUARDRAIL THERE FOR THE SAME    
REASON THIS IS THE BACK ALLEY   
ELEVATION YOU COULD SEE THAT

REASON THIS IS THE BACK ALLEY   
ELEVATION YOU COULD SEE THAT    
REAR STAIR THERE'S A STAIR      

01:28:19.196 --> 01:28:19.595
ELEVATION YOU COULD SEE THAT    
REAR STAIR THERE'S A STAIR      
THERE ALREADY.

REAR STAIR THERE'S A STAIR      
THERE ALREADY.                  
THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO EXTEND  

01:28:21.932 --> 01:28:23.097
THERE ALREADY.                  
THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO EXTEND  
UP HIGHER TO GO UP ONTO THE     

01:28:23.099 --> 01:28:25.333
THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO EXTEND  
UP HIGHER TO GO UP ONTO THE     
ROOF WHICH IS GREAT.

THAT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR IT.    

01:28:26.403 --> 01:28:27.435
ROOF WHICH IS GREAT.            
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR IT.    
SO THAT'S A SECOND MEANS        

01:28:27.437 --> 01:28:29.638
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR IT.    
SO THAT'S A SECOND MEANS        
OF EGRESS FROM THE ROOF.        

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.572
SO THAT'S A SECOND MEANS        
OF EGRESS FROM THE ROOF.        
THESE ARE THE BUILDINGS IN THE  

01:28:30.574 --> 01:28:31.239
OF EGRESS FROM THE ROOF.        
THESE ARE THE BUILDINGS IN THE  
DISTANCE LIKE SORRY I KEEP      

01:28:31.241 --> 01:28:34.042
THESE ARE THE BUILDINGS IN THE  
DISTANCE LIKE SORRY I KEEP      
SAYING BUILDING THESE ARE THE   

01:28:34.044 --> 01:28:34.743

THERE'S A GLASS GUARDRAIL HERE. 
I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE   

01:28:42.486 --> 01:28:45.386
THERE'S A GLASS GUARDRAIL HERE. 
I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE   
THAT IT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE     

01:28:45.388 --> 01:28:48.824
I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE   
THAT IT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE     
WE'VE GOT THE PLANTERS AND THE  

01:28:48.826 --> 01:28:49.891
THAT IT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE     
WE'VE GOT THE PLANTERS AND THE

REALLY AT ALL.

THE DRAINAGE SHOOT AS ABOUT     

01:35:28.157 --> 01:35:31.793
>> THAT'S CORRECT.              
THE DRAINAGE SHOOT AS ABOUT     
FOUR FEET OF SPACE THE ORIGINAL 

01:35:31.795 --> 01:35:32.627
THE DRAINAGE SHOOT AS ABOUT     
FOUR FEET OF SPACE THE ORIGINAL 
SECTION FOR FLOORING IS STILL   

01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:36.431
FOUR FEET OF SPACE THE ORIGINAL 
SECTION FOR FLOORING IS STILL   
IN THE BUILDING AND IT'S ON TOP 

01:35:36.433 --> 01:35:40.101
SECTION FOR FLOORING IS STILL   
IN THE BUILDING AND IT'S ON TOP 
OF THE THAT CEILING STRUCTURE   

01:35:40.103 --> 01:35:43.605
IN THE BUILDING AND IT'S ON TOP 
OF THE THAT CEILING STRUCTURE   
FORCE STRUCTURE THAT WAS THE    

01:35:43.607 --> 01:35:44.472
OF THE THAT CEILING STRUCTURE   
FORCE STRUCTURE THAT WAS THE    
SECOND FLOOR WAS ABOUT FOUR     

01:35:44.474 --> 01:35:45.140
FORCE STRUCTURE THAT WAS THE    
SECOND FLOOR WAS ABOUT FOUR     
FEET UP TO WHERE THE ROOF IS    

01:35:45.142 --> 01:35:48.175
SECOND FLOOR WAS ABOUT FOUR     
FEET UP TO WHERE THE ROOF IS    
AND THE ROOF SLOPES TO THE BACK 

01:35:48.177 --> 01:35:48.577
FEET UP TO WHERE THE ROOF IS    
AND THE ROOF SLOPES TO THE BACK 
OK FOR DRAINAGE.                

01:35:48.579 --> 01:35:52.247
AND THE ROOF SLOPES TO THE BACK 
OK FOR DRAINAGE.                
SO OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THAT   

01:35:52.249 --> 01:35:55.984
OK FOR DRAINAGE.                
SO OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THAT   
FOUR FEET TO ABOUT TWO FEET.    

01:35:55.986 --> 01:35:56.350
SO OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THAT   
FOUR FEET TO ABOUT TWO FEET.    
YES.                            

01:35:56.352 --> 01:35:58.854
FOUR FEET TO ABOUT TWO FEET.    
YES.                            
PUT A NEW ROOFING MEMBRANE AT   

01:35:58.856 --> 01:36:01.623
YES.                            
PUT A NEW ROOFING MEMBRANE AT   
THAT POINT AND THEN RIGHT MY    

01:36:01.625 --> 01:36:06.294
PUT A NEW ROOFING MEMBRANE AT   
THAT POINT AND THEN RIGHT MY    
COLLEAGUE AND THEN PUT A A      

01:36:06.296 --> 01:36:10.398
THAT POINT AND THEN RIGHT MY    
COLLEAGUE AND THEN PUT A A      
PEDESTAL DRAINAGE ROOF SO THAT  

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.935
COLLEAGUE AND THEN PUT A A      
PEDESTAL DRAINAGE ROOF SO THAT  
ACTUALLY THE NEW PEDESTAL ROOF  

01:36:13.937 --> 01:36:14.869
PEDESTAL DRAINAGE ROOF SO THAT  
ACTUALLY THE NEW PEDESTAL ROOF  
WILL BE SWOPE'S FLAT OR TIE     

01:36:14.871 --> 01:36:18.406
ACTUALLY THE NEW PEDESTAL ROOF  
WILL BE SWOPE'S FLAT OR TIE     
RIGHT BACK INTO WHERE WE DID    

01:36:18.408 --> 01:36:19.340
WILL BE SWOPE'S FLAT OR TIE     
RIGHT BACK INTO WHERE WE DID    
THE CUT OUT AND BE RIGHT ON TO  

01:36:19.342 --> 01:36:22.176
RIGHT BACK INTO WHERE WE DID    
THE CUT OUT AND BE RIGHT ON TO  
THE EXISTING ROOF.              

01:36:22.178 --> 01:36:23.011
THE CUT OUT AND BE RIGHT ON TO  
THE EXISTING ROOF.              
SO THAT WAS A VERY GOOD         

01:36:23.013 --> 01:36:26.280
THE EXISTING ROOF.              
SO THAT WAS A VERY GOOD
