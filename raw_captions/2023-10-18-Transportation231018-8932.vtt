CHANGE THAT WE WANT TO SEE      
WHICH IS A MOVE TOWARDS         
RECONFIGURING THESE ROADS AWAY  

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.710
WHICH IS A MOVE TOWARDS         
RECONFIGURING THESE ROADS AWAY  
FROM MULTI LANE AND SO I THINK  

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:41.379
RECONFIGURING THESE ROADS AWAY  
FROM MULTI LANE AND SO I THINK  
THAT&apos;S WHY WE INSERTED THIS     

00:23:41.381 --> 00:23:44.648
FROM MULTI LANE AND SO I THINK  
THAT&apos;S WHY WE INSERTED THIS     
KIND OF YOU KNOW, ANOTHER LAYER 

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.585
THAT&apos;S WHY WE INSERTED THIS     
KIND OF YOU KNOW, ANOTHER LAYER 
BASICALLY A LAYER OF APPROVAL   

00:23:48.587 --> 00:23:49.086
KIND OF YOU KNOW, ANOTHER LAYER 
BASICALLY A LAYER OF APPROVAL   
TO NOT DO IT.                   

00:23:49.088 --> 00:23:50.020
BASICALLY A LAYER OF APPROVAL   
TO NOT DO IT.                   
SO THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE WE     

00:23:50.022 --> 00:23:52.790
TO NOT DO IT.                   
SO THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE WE     
SHOULD DO IT AND IF WE DON&apos;T,   

00:23:52.792 --> 00:23:55.225
SO THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE WE     
SHOULD DO IT AND IF WE DON&apos;T,   
THERE SHOULD BE A GOOD REASON   

00:23:55.227 --> 00:23:55.960
SHOULD DO IT AND IF WE DON&apos;T,   
THERE SHOULD BE A GOOD REASON   
AND SUBJECT TO APPROVAL         

00:23:55.962 --> 00:23:58.829
THERE SHOULD BE A GOOD REASON   
AND SUBJECT TO APPROVAL         
OF COUNCIL FLAT, THE RATIONALE  

00:23:58.831 --> 00:24:04.935
AND SUBJECT TO APPROVAL         
OF COUNCIL FLAT, THE RATIONALE  
THANK YOU                       

00:24:05.804 --> 00:24:12.910
         .                      
FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT YOU SAID   
YOU ASKED ABOUT WHAT QUALIFIES  

00:24:12.912 --> 00:24:17.447
FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT YOU SAID   
YOU ASKED ABOUT WHAT QUALIFIES  
LIKE LANE ROADS WITH MULTIPLE   

00:24:17.449 --> 00:24:21.084
YOU ASKED ABOUT WHAT QUALIFIES  
LIKE LANE ROADS WITH MULTIPLE   
LANES AT INTERSECTIONS.         

00:24:21.086 --> 00:24:22.319
LIKE LANE ROADS WITH MULTIPLE   
LANES AT INTERSECTIONS.         
THAT IS THE THING THAT I AGREE  

00:24:22.321 --> 00:24:25.456
LANES AT INTERSECTIONS.         
THAT IS THE THING THAT I AGREE  
MIGHT NEED SOME CLARITY BUT     

00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:29.392
THAT IS THE THING THAT I AGREE  
MIGHT NEED SOME CLARITY BUT     
ALSO THE IDEA OF WHAT           

00:24:29.394 --> 00:24:30.060
MIGHT NEED SOME CLARITY BUT     
ALSO THE IDEA OF WHAT           
CONSTITUTES A MULTI LANE ROAD.  

00:24:30.062 --> 00:24:31.061
ALSO THE IDEA OF WHAT           
CONSTITUTES A MULTI LANE ROAD.  
I MEAN IS THAT ALREADY DEFINED  

00:24:31.063 --> 00:24:33.530
CONSTITUTES A MULTI LANE ROAD.  
I MEAN IS THAT ALREADY DEFINED  
SOMEWHERE ACTUALLY HAS TWO      

00:24:33.532 --> 00:24:36.066
I MEAN IS THAT ALREADY DEFINED  
SOMEWHERE ACTUALLY HAS TWO      
LANES ON IT BUT THEY&apos;RE IN      

00:24:36.068 --> 00:24:36.599
SOMEWHERE ACTUALLY HAS TWO      
LANES ON IT BUT THEY&apos;RE IN      
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.            

00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:37.734
LANES ON IT BUT THEY&apos;RE IN      
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.            
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE 

00:24:37.736 --> 00:24:40.170
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.            
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE 
RECONFIGURED.                   

00:24:40.172 --> 00:24:41.237
&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE 
RECONFIGURED.                   
DIVISION HAS TWO LANES AND IT   

00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:44.107
RECONFIGURED.                   
DIVISION HAS TWO LANES AND IT   
BOTH IN THE SAME DIRECTION.     

00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:45.141
DIVISION HAS TWO LANES AND IT   
BOTH IN THE SAME DIRECTION.     
I THINK IT DOES NEED TO BE      

00:24:45.143 --> 00:24:48.411
BOTH IN THE SAME DIRECTION.     
I THINK IT DOES NEED TO BE      
RECONFIGURED OR STADIUM TO IN   

00:24:48.413 --> 00:24:48.812
I THINK IT DOES NEED TO BE      
RECONFIGURED OR STADIUM TO IN   
EACH DIRECTION.                 

00:24:48.814 --> 00:24:49.779
RECONFIGURED OR STADIUM TO IN   
EACH DIRECTION.                 
IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED TO    

00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:52.149
EACH DIRECTION.                 
IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED TO    
RECONFIGURE.                    

00:24:52.151 --> 00:24:53.083
IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED TO    
RECONFIGURE.                    
SO MAYBE THERE&apos;S SOME SOME      

00:24:53.085 --> 00:24:53.883
RECONFIGURE.                    
SO MAYBE THERE&apos;S SOME SOME      
CLARITY THERE AND EXACTLY WHAT  

00:24:53.885 --> 00:24:59.923
SO MAYBE THERE&apos;S SOME SOME      
CLARITY THERE AND EXACTLY WHAT  
WE BY MOBILING ROAD THAT WE&apos;RE  

00:24:59.925 --> 00:25:01.058
CLARITY THERE AND EXACTLY WHAT  
WE BY MOBILING ROAD THAT WE&apos;RE  
I FOLLOW THE QUESTION OR THE    

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.060
WE BY MOBILING ROAD THAT WE&apos;RE  
I FOLLOW THE QUESTION OR THE    
COMMENT COME UP EARLIER ON I    

00:25:04.062 --> 00:25:04.727
I FOLLOW THE QUESTION OR THE    
COMMENT COME UP EARLIER ON I    
THINK THE EMAIL WHERE THEY      

00:25:04.729 --> 00:25:07.530
COMMENT COME UP EARLIER ON I    
THINK THE EMAIL WHERE THEY      
MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT AND I    

00:25:07.532 --> 00:25:11.035
THINK THE EMAIL WHERE THEY      
MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT AND I    
LOOKED UP THE DEFINITION        

00:25:11.037 --> 00:25:11.969
MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT AND I    
LOOKED UP THE DEFINITION        
OF MULTI LANE ROAD AND IT&apos;S HAS 

00:25:11.971 --> 00:25:12.969
LOOKED UP THE DEFINITION        
OF MULTI LANE ROAD AND IT&apos;S HAS 
TWO OR MORE LANES GOING IN ONE  

00:25:12.971 --> 00:25:15.572
OF MULTI LANE ROAD AND IT&apos;S HAS 
TWO OR MORE LANES GOING IN ONE  
DIRECTION I GUESS THE           

00:25:15.574 --> 00:25:18.609
TWO OR MORE LANES GOING IN ONE  
DIRECTION I GUESS THE           
TRANSPORTATION BOOKS CAN&apos;T TELL 

00:25:18.611 --> 00:25:19.442
DIRECTION I GUESS THE           
TRANSPORTATION BOOKS CAN&apos;T TELL 
ME IF THAT IS THE RIGHT         

00:25:19.444 --> 00:25:22.746
TRANSPORTATION BOOKS CAN&apos;T TELL 
ME IF THAT IS THE RIGHT         
DEFINITION BUT I THINK IT DOES  

00:25:22.748 --> 00:25:29.219
ME IF THAT IS THE RIGHT         
DEFINITION BUT I THINK IT DOES  
HAVE A SPECIFICITY THERE        

00:25:29.888 --> 00:25:33.056

COMMENTS ON THE FIRST RESULT    
AGAIN.                          
OH, JULIE ZACH I DON&apos;T KNOW IF  

00:25:59.851 --> 00:26:00.683
AGAIN.                          
OH, JULIE ZACH I DON&apos;T KNOW IF  
THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THE FIRST   

00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:03.787
OH, JULIE ZACH I DON&apos;T KNOW IF  
THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THE FIRST   
RESULT BUT I JUST WONDER HOW    

00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:04.788
THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THE FIRST   
RESULT BUT I JUST WONDER HOW    
THIS IF IT IF THERE IF IT&apos;S     

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.957
RESULT BUT I JUST WONDER HOW    
THIS IF IT IF THERE IF IT&apos;S     
DECIDED THAT WE DON&apos;T NEED A    

00:26:07.959 --> 00:26:11.027
THIS IF IT IF THERE IF IT&apos;S     
DECIDED THAT WE DON&apos;T NEED A    
DEDICATED BUS LANE BUT THERE    

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.895
DECIDED THAT WE DON&apos;T NEED A    
DEDICATED BUS LANE BUT THERE    
ARE BUSSES THAT GO DOWN THAT    

00:26:11.897 --> 00:26:12.229
DEDICATED BUS LANE BUT THERE    
ARE BUSSES THAT GO DOWN THAT    
ROAD.                           

00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:14.498
ARE BUSSES THAT GO DOWN THAT    
ROAD.                           
&gt;&gt; HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT BUS    

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.601
ROAD.                           
&gt;&gt; HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT BUS    
TRAVEL OR YOU KNOW, ARE THE     

00:26:18.603 --> 00:26:19.336
&gt;&gt; HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT BUS    
TRAVEL OR YOU KNOW, ARE THE     
BUSSES GOING TO BE BLOCKING     

00:26:19.338 --> 00:26:25.976
TRAVEL OR YOU KNOW, ARE THE     
BUSSES GOING TO BE BLOCKING     
HOLDING UP TRAFFIC OR HOW IS    

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:43.760
COULD WORK?                     
SO I&apos;LL TRY TO SPEAK TO THAT    
USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS ON ROAD    

00:26:43.762 --> 00:26:44.428
SO I&apos;LL TRY TO SPEAK TO THAT    
USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS ON ROAD    
ROADS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN    

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.162
USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS ON ROAD    
ROADS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN    
RECONFIGURED WITH DIETZE THE    

00:26:45.164 --> 00:26:45.963
ROADS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN    
RECONFIGURED WITH DIETZE THE    
TRANSIT VEHICLES ARE ACTUALLY   

00:26:45.965 --> 00:26:46.630
RECONFIGURED WITH DIETZE THE    
TRANSIT VEHICLES ARE ACTUALLY   
CONSIDERED PART OF THE TRAFFIC  

00:26:46.632 --> 00:26:47.164
TRANSIT VEHICLES ARE ACTUALLY   
CONSIDERED PART OF THE TRAFFIC  
CALMING SOLUTIONS.              

00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:47.897
CONSIDERED PART OF THE TRAFFIC  
CALMING SOLUTIONS.              
SO USUALLY WHEN A BUS MAKES A   

00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:48.665
CALMING SOLUTIONS.              
SO USUALLY WHEN A BUS MAKES A   
STOP THAT&apos;S ONLY UNLESS THERE&apos;S 

00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:49.399
SO USUALLY WHEN A BUS MAKES A   
STOP THAT&apos;S ONLY UNLESS THERE&apos;S 
A WHEELCHAIR OR SOMETHING LIKE  

00:26:49.401 --> 00:26:51.602
STOP THAT&apos;S ONLY UNLESS THERE&apos;S 
A WHEELCHAIR OR SOMETHING LIKE  
THAT IT&apos;S USUALLY MAYBE TEN TO  

00:26:51.604 --> 00:26:52.469
A WHEELCHAIR OR SOMETHING LIKE  
THAT IT&apos;S USUALLY MAYBE TEN TO  
FIFTEEN SECONDS AT THE MOST AND 

00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:55.606
THAT IT&apos;S USUALLY MAYBE TEN TO  
FIFTEEN SECONDS AT THE MOST AND 
THAT ALLOWS THE VEHICLES TO     

00:26:55.608 --> 00:26:56.006
FIFTEEN SECONDS AT THE MOST AND 
THAT ALLOWS THE VEHICLES TO     
KEEP MOVING.                    

00:26:56.008 --> 00:26:59.476
THAT ALLOWS THE VEHICLES TO     
KEEP MOVING.                    
BUT IT ALSO KIND OF PUTS I      

00:26:59.478 --> 00:27:00.177
KEEP MOVING.                    
BUT IT ALSO KIND OF PUTS I      
DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT&apos;S THE RIGHT     

00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:00.978
BUT IT ALSO KIND OF PUTS I      
DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT&apos;S THE RIGHT     
WORD FOR THIS PUTS THE PRUDENT  

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.480
DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT&apos;S THE RIGHT     
WORD FOR THIS PUTS THE PRUDENT  
DRIVER IN CONTROL.              

00:27:03.482 --> 00:27:04.314
WORD FOR THIS PUTS THE PRUDENT  
DRIVER IN CONTROL.              
SO WHOEVER IS GOING SLOW US     

00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:05.049
DRIVER IN CONTROL.              
SO WHOEVER IS GOING SLOW US     
DOWN THE CORRIDOR ENDS UP, YOU  

00:27:05.051 --> 00:27:06.516
SO WHOEVER IS GOING SLOW US     
DOWN THE CORRIDOR ENDS UP, YOU  
KNOW, KIND OF DETERMINING THE   

00:27:06.518 --> 00:27:11.121
DOWN THE CORRIDOR ENDS UP, YOU  
KNOW, KIND OF DETERMINING THE   
SPEED AND THEN IF A BUS IS      

00:27:11.123 --> 00:27:14.758
KNOW, KIND OF DETERMINING THE   
SPEED AND THEN IF A BUS IS      
PULLED OVER IT&apos;S KIND OF A GRAY 

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.492
SPEED AND THEN IF A BUS IS      
PULLED OVER IT&apos;S KIND OF A GRAY 
AREA FROM WHAT WE&apos;VE BEEN TOLD  

00:27:15.494 --> 00:27:18.495
PULLED OVER IT&apos;S KIND OF A GRAY 
AREA FROM WHAT WE&apos;VE BEEN TOLD  
ABOUT IF PEOPLE WANT TO PULL    

00:27:18.497 --> 00:27:19.129
AREA FROM WHAT WE&apos;VE BEEN TOLD  
ABOUT IF PEOPLE WANT TO PULL    
AROUND IT THEY&apos;RE WELCOME TO.   

00:27:19.131 --> 00:27:22.766
ABOUT IF PEOPLE WANT TO PULL    
AROUND IT THEY&apos;RE WELCOME TO.   
BUT THAT&apos;S YOU KNOW, THAT&apos;S     

00:27:22.768 --> 00:27:29.439
AROUND IT THEY&apos;RE WELCOME TO.   
BUT THAT&apos;S YOU KNOW, THAT&apos;S     
THEIR DECISION THAT ADDRESSED   

00:27:29.441 --> 00:27:30.040
BUT THAT&apos;S YOU KNOW, THAT&apos;S     
THEIR DECISION THAT ADDRESSED   
THAT QUESTION, JULIE.           

00:27:30.042 --> 00:27:33.643
THEIR DECISION THAT ADDRESSED   
THAT QUESTION, JULIE.           
&gt;&gt; AND I CERTAINLY THINK NO, I  

00:27:33.645 --> 00:27:37.648
THAT QUESTION, JULIE.           
&gt;&gt; AND I CERTAINLY THINK NO, I  
GUESS I JUST REALLY LIKE THE    

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.615
&gt;&gt; AND I CERTAINLY THINK NO, I  
GUESS I JUST REALLY LIKE THE    
IDEA OF A DEDICATED BUS LANES   

00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:45.321
GUESS I JUST REALLY LIKE THE    
IDEA OF A DEDICATED BUS LANES   
AND SO RIGHT NOW WITH THE IN    

00:27:45.323 --> 00:27:49.325
IDEA OF A DEDICATED BUS LANES   
AND SO RIGHT NOW WITH THE IN    
THIS CLAUSE THE STAFF HAVE TO   

00:27:49.327 --> 00:27:50.327
AND SO RIGHT NOW WITH THE IN    
THIS CLAUSE THE STAFF HAVE TO   
GET APPROVAL TO DO A BUS LANE I 

00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:52.996
THIS CLAUSE THE STAFF HAVE TO   
GET APPROVAL TO DO A BUS LANE I 
THINK IS THAT HOW AM I READING  

00:27:52.998 --> 00:27:56.433
GET APPROVAL TO DO A BUS LANE I 
THINK IS THAT HOW AM I READING  
THAT RIGHT.                     

00:27:56.435 --> 00:28:00.303
THINK IS THAT HOW AM I READING  
THAT RIGHT.                     
SO IS THAT GOING TO DISCOURAGE  

00:28:00.305 --> 00:28:00.704

OF EVALUATING ALL ROADS FOR A   
RECONFIGURATION?                
IT&apos;S A GOOD QUESTION.           

00:45:59.417 --> 00:46:01.784
RECONFIGURATION?                
IT&apos;S A GOOD QUESTION.           
I DON&apos;T KNOW IF I COULD SIGN UP 

00:46:01.786 --> 00:46:02.418
IT&apos;S A GOOD QUESTION.           
I DON&apos;T KNOW IF I COULD SIGN UP 
FOR THE FIRST ONE.              

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.619
I DON&apos;T KNOW IF I COULD SIGN UP 
FOR THE FIRST ONE.              
I THINK THE POINT OF THIS IS    

00:46:03.621 --> 00:46:06.255
FOR THE FIRST ONE.              
I THINK THE POINT OF THIS IS    
THE EVALUATION PROCESS BUT I    

00:46:06.257 --> 00:46:06.923
I THINK THE POINT OF THIS IS    
THE EVALUATION PROCESS BUT I    
DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE DICTATING THE 

00:46:06.925 --> 00:46:07.723
THE EVALUATION PROCESS BUT I    
DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE DICTATING THE 
OUTCOME OF THAT PROCESS         

00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:11.593
DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE DICTATING THE 
OUTCOME OF THAT PROCESS         
ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW, I I AGREE  

00:46:11.595 --> 00:46:13.563
OUTCOME OF THAT PROCESS         
ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW, I I AGREE

WITH YOU.                       
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT&apos;S A GOOD POINT. 
LET ME LET ME                   

00:46:21.537 --> 00:46:28.411
              A BIT MORE MUTED  
IF YOU&apos;RE                       

00:46:28.478 --> 00:46:36.518
          I THINK THAT&apos;S A GOOD 
RECOMMENDATION OF EVALUATING    
THE GOAL OF EVALUATING LET ME   

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.753
RECOMMENDATION OF EVALUATING    
THE GOAL OF EVALUATING LET ME   
LET DHARMA AND THEN WE&apos;LL TALK  

00:46:37.755 --> 00:46:41.223
THE GOAL OF EVALUATING LET ME   
LET DHARMA AND THEN WE&apos;LL TALK  
ABOUT YOU GUYS MENTIONED THAT   

00:46:41.225 --> 00:46:41.957
LET DHARMA AND THEN WE&apos;LL TALK  
ABOUT YOU GUYS MENTIONED THAT   
THERE WAS SOME MENTION OF A     

00:46:41.959 --> 00:46:44.359
ABOUT YOU GUYS MENTIONED THAT   
THERE WAS SOME MENTION OF A     
DATE IN A PREVIOUS GENERATION   

00:46:44.361 --> 00:46:45.527
THERE WAS SOME MENTION OF A     
DATE IN A PREVIOUS GENERATION   
SO MAYBE TALK ABOUT WHERE THAT  

00:46:45.529 --> 00:46:51.833
DATE IN A PREVIOUS GENERATION   
SO MAYBE TALK ABOUT WHERE THAT  
CONVERSATION WENT.              

00:46:51.835 --> 00:46:53.135
SO MAYBE TALK ABOUT WHERE THAT  
CONVERSATION WENT.              
YEAH, I MEAN THIS WILL BE OUR   

00:46:53.137 --> 00:46:55.771
CONVERSATION WENT.              
YEAH, I MEAN THIS WILL BE OUR   
FOCAL POINT.                    

00:46:55.773 --> 00:46:58.641
YEAH, I MEAN THIS WILL BE OUR   
FOCAL POINT.                    
THIS WILL BE THE WORK WE DO SO  

00:46:58.643 --> 00:46:59.375
FOCAL POINT.                    
THIS WILL BE THE WORK WE DO SO  
I MEAN EVALUATE THESE           

00:46:59.377 --> 00:47:02.845
THIS WILL BE THE WORK WE DO SO  
I MEAN EVALUATE THESE           
EVALUATIONS ARE NOT EASY.       

00:47:02.847 --> 00:47:03.846
I MEAN EVALUATE THESE           
EVALUATIONS ARE NOT EASY.       
THEY TAKE A LOT OF DATA         

00:47:03.848 --> 00:47:10.219
EVALUATIONS ARE NOT EASY.       
THEY TAKE A LOT OF DATA         
COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS         

00:47:23.867 --> 00:47:26.001
                       .        
SO IF THIS IS THE WORK WE       
SHOULD DO PRIMARILY THEN THIS   

00:47:26.003 --> 00:47:26.735
SO IF THIS IS THE WORK WE       
SHOULD DO PRIMARILY THEN THIS   
WOULD BE THE WORK WE WOULD DO.  

00:47:26.737 --> 00:47:27.570
SHOULD DO PRIMARILY THEN THIS   
WOULD BE THE WORK WE WOULD DO.  
SO WHAT WE WERE SUGGESTING THE  

00:47:27.572 --> 00:47:28.304
WOULD BE THE WORK WE WOULD DO.  
SO WHAT WE WERE SUGGESTING THE  
REASON WHY WE SUGGEST WHEN A    

00:47:28.306 --> 00:47:29.171
SO WHAT WE WERE SUGGESTING THE  
REASON WHY WE SUGGEST WHEN A    
ROAD IS KIND OF UP FOR PROGRAM  

00:47:29.173 --> 00:47:29.838
REASON WHY WE SUGGEST WHEN A    
ROAD IS KIND OF UP FOR PROGRAM  
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE EVALUATE   

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:30.639
ROAD IS KIND OF UP FOR PROGRAM  
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE EVALUATE   
AT THAT TIME, THEN IT&apos;S JUST    

00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:31.239
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE EVALUATE   
AT THAT TIME, THEN IT&apos;S JUST    
PART OF THE NATURAL SORT        

00:47:31.241 --> 00:47:31.974
AT THAT TIME, THEN IT&apos;S JUST    
PART OF THE NATURAL SORT        
OF THE, YOU KNOW, PROGRESSION   

00:47:31.976 --> 00:47:32.441
PART OF THE NATURAL SORT        
OF THE, YOU KNOW, PROGRESSION   
OF THAT PROJECT.                

00:47:32.443 --> 00:47:36.412
OF THE, YOU KNOW, PROGRESSION   
OF THAT PROJECT.                
THIS WOULD ALTER NOT JUST THE   

00:47:36.414 --> 00:47:37.346
OF THAT PROJECT.                
THIS WOULD ALTER NOT JUST THE   
WORK THAT OUR TEAM DOES BUT IT  

00:47:37.348 --> 00:47:42.651
THIS WOULD ALTER NOT JUST THE   
WORK THAT OUR TEAM DOES BUT IT  
WOULD AFFECT THE ENTIRE KIND    

00:47:42.653 --> 00:47:43.785
WORK THAT OUR TEAM DOES BUT IT  
WOULD AFFECT THE ENTIRE KIND    
OF IF IF THERE&apos;S SUPPOSED TO BE 

00:47:43.787 --> 00:47:47.022
WOULD AFFECT THE ENTIRE KIND    
OF IF IF THERE&apos;S SUPPOSED TO BE 
EVALUATED AND IMPLEMENTED THAT  

00:47:47.024 --> 00:47:47.956
OF IF IF THERE&apos;S SUPPOSED TO BE 
EVALUATED AND IMPLEMENTED THAT  
WOULD CHANGE A LOT OF THE       

00:47:47.958 --> 00:47:52.828
EVALUATED AND IMPLEMENTED THAT  
WOULD CHANGE A LOT OF THE       
CAPITAL PRIORITIES FOR THE CITY 

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:53.061
WOULD CHANGE A LOT OF THE       
CAPITAL PRIORITIES FOR THE CITY 
.                               

00:47:53.063 --> 00:47:57.099
CAPITAL PRIORITIES FOR THE CITY 
.                               
SO THERE&apos;S KIND OF A RIPPLE     

00:47:57.101 --> 00:47:58.133
.                               
SO THERE&apos;S KIND OF A RIPPLE     
EFFECT IN TERMS OF ALL THE WORK 

00:47:58.135 --> 00:47:58.867
SO THERE&apos;S KIND OF A RIPPLE     
EFFECT IN TERMS OF ALL THE WORK 
THAT IT WOULD AFFECT EVERYTHING 

00:47:58.869 --> 00:48:01.670
EFFECT IN TERMS OF ALL THE WORK 
THAT IT WOULD AFFECT EVERYTHING 
WOULD HAVE TO SHIFT THE FOCUS   

00:48:01.672 --> 00:48:02.404
THAT IT WOULD AFFECT EVERYTHING 
WOULD HAVE TO SHIFT THE FOCUS   
ON THIS WHICH YOU KNOW, IF      

00:48:02.406 --> 00:48:03.906
WOULD HAVE TO SHIFT THE FOCUS   
ON THIS WHICH YOU KNOW, IF      
THAT&apos;S THE THE PRIORITY THEN    

00:48:03.908 --> 00:48:12.014
ON THIS WHICH YOU KNOW, IF      
THAT&apos;S THE THE PRIORITY THEN    
THAT&apos;S THE PRIORITY THE SO IF   

00:48:12.016 --> 00:48:15.117
THAT&apos;S THE THE PRIORITY THEN    
THAT&apos;S THE PRIORITY THE SO IF   
WE HAD THIS TIME BOUND BY       

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:15.885
THAT&apos;S THE PRIORITY THE SO IF   
WE HAD THIS TIME BOUND BY       
TWENTY YEARS, LET&apos;S SAY WE&apos;RE   

00:48:15.887 --> 00:48:16.685
WE HAD THIS TIME BOUND BY       
TWENTY YEARS, LET&apos;S SAY WE&apos;RE   
GOING TO TOUCH EVERY ROAD IN    

00:48:16.687 --> 00:48:19.054
TWENTY YEARS, LET&apos;S SAY WE&apos;RE   
GOING TO TOUCH EVERY ROAD IN    
THE CITY WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY 

00:48:19.056 --> 00:48:20.022
GOING TO TOUCH EVERY ROAD IN    
THE CITY WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY 
YEARS TO REPAVE IT OR RESTART   

00:48:20.024 --> 00:48:23.525
THE CITY WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY 
YEARS TO REPAVE IT OR RESTART   
THE SO THAT WOULD NOT           

00:48:23.527 --> 00:48:26.995
YEARS TO REPAVE IT OR RESTART   
THE SO THAT WOULD NOT           
APPRECIABLY CHANGE THE WORKLOAD 

00:48:26.997 --> 00:48:30.432
THE SO THAT WOULD NOT           
APPRECIABLY CHANGE THE WORKLOAD 
OR THE PRIORITIZATION AT LEAST  

00:48:30.434 --> 00:48:34.036
APPRECIABLY CHANGE THE WORKLOAD 
OR THE PRIORITIZATION AT LEAST  
THAT&apos;S MY ASSUMPTION THAT       

00:48:34.038 --> 00:48:34.937
OR THE PRIORITIZATION AT LEAST  
THAT&apos;S MY ASSUMPTION THAT       
WOULDN&apos;T BE A RADICAL CHANGE.   

00:48:34.939 --> 00:48:38.840
THAT&apos;S MY ASSUMPTION THAT       
WOULDN&apos;T BE A RADICAL CHANGE.   
&gt;&gt; SO IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO IT   

00:48:38.842 --> 00:48:39.808
WOULDN&apos;T BE A RADICAL CHANGE.   
&gt;&gt; SO IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO IT   
IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS IT DOES   

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.578
&gt;&gt; SO IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO IT   
IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS IT DOES   
RADICALLY CHANGE OUR PRIORITIES 

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.914
IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS IT DOES   
RADICALLY CHANGE OUR PRIORITIES 
AND OUR TIMELINE PIECES WHAT

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.486
AND OUR TIMELINE PIECES WHAT    
SOME NUMBER IN BETWEEN TWO AND  
20 THAT IS THE RIGHT COMPROMISE 

00:48:50.488 --> 00:48:53.355
SOME NUMBER IN BETWEEN TWO AND  
20 THAT IS THE RIGHT COMPROMISE 
THAT CHANGES OUR PRIORITIES A
