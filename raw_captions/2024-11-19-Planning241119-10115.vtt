ZONING DISTRICT THAT WE WOULD   
HAVE WOULD BE IN OUR FORTY

HAVE WOULD BE IN OUR FORTY      
ZONING DISTRICT WHICH WORKS IN  
A LOT OF WAYS ACTUALLY IT WORKS 

00:21:47.028 --> 00:21:47.859
ZONING DISTRICT WHICH WORKS IN  
A LOT OF WAYS ACTUALLY IT WORKS 
IN ALMOST EVERY WAY EXCEPT FOR

A LOT OF WAYS ACTUALLY IT WORKS 
IN ALMOST EVERY WAY EXCEPT FOR

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.978
NORTHERN SETBACK WHICH IS       
ADJACENT TO THE WAY ONE AND TWO 
DEVELOPMENT DUE TO THE LENGTH   

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.646
ADJACENT TO THE WAY ONE AND TWO 
DEVELOPMENT DUE TO THE LENGTH   
OF THE BUILDING OUR CODE HAS A

DEVELOPMENT DUE TO THE LENGTH   
OF THE BUILDING OUR CODE HAS A  
REQUIREMENT THAT BUILDING ABOUT

REQUIREMENT THAT BUILDING ABOUT 
FIFTY FEET HAVE AN ADDITIONAL   

00:22:10.518 --> 00:22:13.752
REQUIREMENT THAT BUILDING ABOUT 
FIFTY FEET HAVE AN ADDITIONAL   
SIDE SET BACK SO WHAT THAT      

00:22:13.754 --> 00:22:14.620
FIFTY FEET HAVE AN ADDITIONAL   
SIDE SET BACK SO WHAT THAT      
WOULD DO IS THAT WOULD PUSH     

00:22:14.622 --> 00:22:15.221
SIDE SET BACK SO WHAT THAT      
WOULD DO IS THAT WOULD PUSH     
THIS BUILDING TO A REQUIRED     

00:22:15.223 --> 00:22:17.789
WOULD DO IS THAT WOULD PUSH     
THIS BUILDING TO A REQUIRED     
TWENTY EIGHT FOOT SETBACK FROM

THIS BUILDING TO A REQUIRED     
TWENTY EIGHT FOOT SETBACK FROM  
WHAT THEY HAVE NOW WHICH IS I   

00:22:18.826 --> 00:22:21.960
TWENTY EIGHT FOOT SETBACK FROM  
WHAT THEY HAVE NOW WHICH IS I   
BELIEVE TEN AT THIS CASE THEY   

00:22:21.962 --> 00:22:22.862
WHAT THEY HAVE NOW WHICH IS I   
BELIEVE TEN AT THIS CASE THEY   
HAVE SO THEY WOULD THEY WOULD   

00:22:22.864 --> 00:22:26.132
BELIEVE TEN AT THIS CASE THEY   
HAVE SO THEY WOULD THEY WOULD   
HAVE TO ADJUST THE BUILDING TO

HAVE TO ADJUST THE BUILDING TO  
ACCOMMODATE FOR THAT TWENTY

00:22:28.736 --> 00:22:29.468
ACCOMMODATE FOR THAT TWENTY     
EIGHT FOOT SIDE SETBACK.        
SO THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY     

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.572
EIGHT FOOT SIDE SETBACK.        
SO THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY     
EITHER ELIMINATE OR REDUCE THE

00:23:00.367 --> 00:23:01.467
FOOT WIDE BUFFER ADJACENT TO

IN THIS CASE IT'S LAND ADJACENT 

00:23:01.469 --> 00:23:02.401
LAND THAT'S RESIDENTIAL OR PARK 
IN THIS CASE IT'S LAND ADJACENT 
TO THE WEST AS WELL AS TO THE

IN THIS CASE IT'S LAND ADJACENT

TO THE WEST AS WELL AS TO THE   
SOUTH.                          
THEY DO MEET THE REQUIREMENT TO 

00:23:04.972 --> 00:23:07.439
SOUTH.                          
THEY DO MEET THE REQUIREMENT TO 
THE SOUTH AND THEY PRETTY MUCH  

00:23:07.441 --> 00:23:08.641
THEY DO MEET THE REQUIREMENT TO 
THE SOUTH AND THEY PRETTY MUCH  
MEET IT ON THE WEST EXCEPT FOR  

00:23:08.643 --> 00:23:11.676
THE SOUTH AND THEY PRETTY MUCH  
MEET IT ON THE WEST EXCEPT FOR  
A SMALL PORTION WHERE THE TURN

MEET IT ON THE WEST EXCEPT FOR  
A SMALL PORTION WHERE THE TURN

A SMALL PORTION WHERE THE TURN  
AROUND FOR SOLID WASTE AND      
FIRAXIS NEEDED TO BUMP INTO     

00:23:15.349 --> 00:23:18.717
AROUND FOR SOLID WASTE AND      
FIRAXIS NEEDED TO BUMP INTO     
THAT THAT SET SET BACK IN AN    

00:23:18.719 --> 00:23:19.418
FIRAXIS NEEDED TO BUMP INTO     
THAT THAT SET SET BACK IN AN    
AREA WHICH REDUCES THE          

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.152
THAT THAT SET SET BACK IN AN    
AREA WHICH REDUCES THE          
CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER IN  

00:23:20.154 --> 00:23:23.355
AREA WHICH REDUCES THE          
CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER IN  
THAT AREA TO ABOUT SIX FEET FOR 

00:23:23.357 --> 00:23:24.056
CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER IN  
THAT AREA TO ABOUT SIX FEET FOR 
ABOUT A WIDTH OF ABOUT TWENTY

ABOUT A WIDTH OF ABOUT TWENTY   
FEET.                           

00:23:24.391 --> 00:23:27.526
ABOUT A WIDTH OF ABOUT TWENTY   
FEET.                           
SO IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE LENGTH   

00:23:27.528 --> 00:23:28.193
FEET.                           
SO IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE LENGTH   
OF THAT REAR AND AGAIN IT IS    

00:23:28.195 --> 00:23:29.861
SO IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE LENGTH   
OF THAT REAR AND AGAIN IT IS    
ADJACENT DIRECTLY TO A PARK.    

00:23:29.863 --> 00:23:30.662
OF THAT REAR AND AGAIN IT IS    
ADJACENT DIRECTLY TO A PARK.    
THEY'RE PROVIDING LANDSCAPING   

00:23:30.664 --> 00:23:31.396
ADJACENT DIRECTLY TO A PARK.    
THEY'RE PROVIDING LANDSCAPING   
WITHIN THAT SMALL 20 FOOT AREA. 

00:23:31.398 --> 00:23:34.366
THEY'RE PROVIDING LANDSCAPING   
WITHIN THAT SMALL 20 FOOT AREA. 
BUT THE CONFLICTING LAND USE    

00:23:34.368 --> 00:23:35.166
WITHIN THAT SMALL 20 FOOT AREA. 
BUT THE CONFLICTING LAND USE    
BUFFER IS ONLY SIX FEET WIDE IN 

00:23:35.168 --> 00:23:35.501
BUT THE CONFLICTING LAND USE    
BUFFER IS ONLY SIX FEET WIDE IN 
THAT CASE.                      

00:23:35.503 --> 00:23:38.170
BUFFER IS ONLY SIX FEET WIDE IN 
THAT CASE.                      
SO AGAIN THAT WOULD REQUIRE     

00:23:38.172 --> 00:23:38.904
THAT CASE.                      
SO AGAIN THAT WOULD REQUIRE     
EITHER A VARIANCE IF IT WAS A   

00:23:38.906 --> 00:23:41.840
SO AGAIN THAT WOULD REQUIRE     
EITHER A VARIANCE IF IT WAS A   
STRAIGHT ZONING OR OBVIOUSLY    

00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:42.741
EITHER A VARIANCE IF IT WAS A   
STRAIGHT ZONING OR OBVIOUSLY    
DONE THROUGH A PAD THAT IS      

00:23:42.743 --> 00:23:45.878
STRAIGHT ZONING OR OBVIOUSLY    
DONE THROUGH A PAD THAT IS      
ALLOWED TO BE MODIFIED.         

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.581
DONE THROUGH A PAD THAT IS      
ALLOWED TO BE MODIFIED.         
>> SO YEAH, THAT WAS AND AGAIN  

00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:50.682
ALLOWED TO BE MODIFIED.         
>> SO YEAH, THAT WAS AND AGAIN  
IS ALSO SO OF COURSE IN GOING   

00:23:50.684 --> 00:23:52.751
>> SO YEAH, THAT WAS AND AGAIN  
IS ALSO SO OF COURSE IN GOING   
FORWARD WITH THE DROUGHT WE     

00:23:52.753 --> 00:23:53.685
IS ALSO SO OF COURSE IN GOING   
FORWARD WITH THE DROUGHT WE     
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE             

00:23:53.687 --> 00:23:54.119
FORWARD WITH THE DROUGHT WE     
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE             
JUSTIFICATIONS.                 

00:23:54.121 --> 00:23:56.855
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

00:37:43.417 --> 00:37:44.749
SO THIS GOES TO MR. KAWALSKY AS 
WE ARE WORKING ON THE PLAN.     
I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE   

00:37:44.751 --> 00:37:47.251
WE ARE WORKING ON THE PLAN.     
I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE   
SOME OF OUR ZONING DISTRICTS    

00:37:47.253 --> 00:37:48.085
I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE   
SOME OF OUR ZONING DISTRICTS    
DOWN FROM THIRTY TWO TO         

00:37:48.087 --> 00:37:50.721
SOME OF OUR ZONING DISTRICTS    
DOWN FROM THIRTY TWO TO         
POTENTIALLY FOR THIS WOULD      

00:37:50.723 --> 00:37:51.555
DOWN FROM THIRTY TWO TO         
POTENTIALLY FOR THIS WOULD      
STILL RIDE IN BECAUSE IT'S      

00:37:51.557 --> 00:37:55.260
POTENTIALLY FOR THIS WOULD      
STILL RIDE IN BECAUSE IT'S      
ACTUALLY THE UDC AND IT'S SET   

00:37:55.262 --> 00:37:58.830
STILL RIDE IN BECAUSE IT'S      
ACTUALLY THE UDC AND IT'S SET   
UP AROUND THE SITE NOT          

00:37:58.832 --> 00:38:02.500
ACTUALLY THE UDC AND IT'S SET   
UP AROUND THE SITE NOT          
NECESSARILY A PARTICULAR ZONING 

00:38:02.502 --> 00:38:02.834
UP AROUND THE SITE NOT          
NECESSARILY A PARTICULAR ZONING 
DISTRICT.                       

00:38:02.836 --> 00:38:04.536
NECESSARILY A PARTICULAR ZONING 
DISTRICT.                       
SO HOW DO WE AVOID THIS IN THE  

00:38:04.538 --> 00:38:08.839
DISTRICT.                       
SO HOW DO WE AVOID THIS IN THE  
FUTURE?                         

00:38:08.841 --> 00:38:09.373
SO HOW DO WE AVOID THIS IN THE  
FUTURE?                         
GOOD QUESTION.                  

00:38:09.375 --> 00:38:10.274
FUTURE?                         
GOOD QUESTION.                  
I MEAN WE WOULD BASICALLY HAVE  

00:38:10.276 --> 00:38:12.744
GOOD QUESTION.                  
I MEAN WE WOULD BASICALLY HAVE  
TO DO A ZONING AMENDMENT SO     

00:38:12.746 --> 00:38:13.611
I MEAN WE WOULD BASICALLY HAVE  
TO DO A ZONING AMENDMENT SO     
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S IN THE UDC    

00:38:13.613 --> 00:38:16.514
TO DO A ZONING AMENDMENT SO     
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S IN THE UDC    
IT'S AND I BELIEVE IT'S IN ALL  

00:38:16.516 --> 00:38:17.448
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S IN THE UDC    
IT'S AND I BELIEVE IT'S IN ALL  
THE FOUR SIDES SET BACKS THAT   

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.451
IT'S AND I BELIEVE IT'S IN ALL  
THE FOUR SIDES SET BACKS THAT   
THE ADDITIONAL IT'S THERE'S     

00:38:20.453 --> 00:38:21.052
THE FOUR SIDES SET BACKS THAT   
THE ADDITIONAL IT'S THERE'S     
SOMETHING FOR ADDITIONAL        

00:38:21.054 --> 00:38:21.786
THE ADDITIONAL IT'S THERE'S     
SOMETHING FOR ADDITIONAL        
BUILDING LENGTH AS WELL AS      

00:38:21.788 --> 00:38:23.755
SOMETHING FOR ADDITIONAL        
BUILDING LENGTH AS WELL AS      
ADDITIONAL BUILDING HEIGHT.     

00:38:23.757 --> 00:38:24.689
BUILDING LENGTH AS WELL AS      
ADDITIONAL BUILDING HEIGHT.     
SO EITHER ONE OF THOSE COULD BE 

00:38:24.691 --> 00:38:25.089
ADDITIONAL BUILDING HEIGHT.     
SO EITHER ONE OF THOSE COULD BE 
FLEXED.                         

00:38:25.091 --> 00:38:25.556

I MEAN I THINK THIS IS          
SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY IS     
KIND OF A SMALLER ISSUE WHICH

THE SITE PLAN, OK, AND THEN WE  
DIDN'T NEED TO DO A TRAFFIC UH

THE SITE PLAN, OK, AND THEN WE  
DIDN'T NEED TO DO A TRAFFIC UH

A BASIC TRAFFIC ANALYSIS DONE   
CORRECT.

BROUGHT UP, ONE NOTE WAS WHAT   
THEY PERCEIVED AS AN INCREASE   

00:40:26.946 --> 00:40:30.815
BROUGHT UP, ONE NOTE WAS WHAT   
THEY PERCEIVED AS AN INCREASE   
OF NONRESIDENT DUMPSTER DIVING  

00:40:30.817 --> 00:40:31.749
THEY PERCEIVED AS AN INCREASE   
OF NONRESIDENT DUMPSTER DIVING  
IN AND ON THEIR PROPERTY SO     

00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:34.385
OF NONRESIDENT DUMPSTER DIVING  
IN AND ON THEIR PROPERTY SO     
THEY WOULD BE ACROSS THE STREET 

00:40:34.387 --> 00:40:35.119
IN AND ON THEIR PROPERTY SO     
THEY WOULD BE ACROSS THE STREET 
FROM YOUR DEVELOPMENT OR        

00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:38.323
THEY WOULD BE ACROSS THE STREET 
FROM YOUR DEVELOPMENT OR

BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK 
RUNNING SOME MORE SENARIO THAN

RUNNING SOME MORE SENARIO THAN  
FEASIBILITY WOULD BE USEFUL AND 

01:19:24.348 --> 01:19:27.483
RUNNING SOME MORE SENARIO THAN  
FEASIBILITY WOULD BE USEFUL AND 
THEN THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IS

THEN THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IS  
ALREADY CONSIDERING HOW TO

WHAT HAPPENS THEN, RIGHT?       
I MEAN CAN I LEASE IT OUT AS A  

01:56:22.865 --> 01:56:23.596

I MEAN CAN I LEASE IT OUT AS A  
ANOTHER BEDROOM OR SOMETHING    
LIKE THAT WHEN IT'S NOT

01:56:27.336 --> 01:56:30.203
DESIGNED FOR SUCH?              
AND SO I THINK THAT KIND

ADAPTIVE REUSE AFTER THAT       

01:56:33.776 --> 01:56:37.444

ADAPTIVE REUSE AFTER THAT       
INITIAL KIND OF DEVELOPMENT.    

01:56:37.446 --> 01:56:38.611
ADAPTIVE REUSE AFTER THAT       
INITIAL KIND OF DEVELOPMENT.    
BUT AGAIN, THAT BEING SAID, THE 

01:56:38.613 --> 01:56:39.245

BUT AGAIN, THAT BEING SAID, THE 
ENCOURAGEMENT OF FIFTEEN        

01:56:39.247 --> 01:56:41.381
BUT AGAIN, THAT BEING SAID, THE 
ENCOURAGEMENT OF FIFTEEN        
NEIGHBORHOODS IS CONCEPT        

01:56:41.383 --> 01:56:42.149
ENCOURAGEMENT OF FIFTEEN        
NEIGHBORHOODS IS CONCEPT        
OF AGAIN THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY   

01:56:42.151 --> 01:56:45.351
NEIGHBORHOODS IS CONCEPT        
OF AGAIN THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY   
AND HAVING ACCESSIBILITY IS IS  

01:56:45.353 --> 01:56:46.152
OF AGAIN THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY   
AND HAVING ACCESSIBILITY IS IS  
ALWAYS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT     

01:56:46.154 --> 01:56:46.486
AND HAVING ACCESSIBILITY IS IS  
ALWAYS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT     
THING.

ALWAYS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT
