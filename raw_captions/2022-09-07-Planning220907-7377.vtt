&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOWEVER, I&amp;apos;M GOING TO START  
WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT.       
I REALLY DO LIKE THIS PROPOSAL  

00:26:43.528 --> 00:26:46.362
WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT.       
I REALLY DO LIKE THIS PROPOSAL  
OVERALL BUT HAVING LOOKED       

00:26:46.364 --> 00:26:47.064
I REALLY DO LIKE THIS PROPOSAL  
OVERALL BUT HAVING LOOKED       
THROUGH THE MATERIAL TODAY AND

YESTERDAY THAT&amp;apos;S BEEN UPDATED   
RECENTLY, I&amp;apos;M A LITTLE CONFUSED 
ABOUT WHY THE DEVELOPERS ARE    

00:26:53.839 --> 00:26:54.571
RECENTLY, I&amp;apos;M A LITTLE CONFUSED 
ABOUT WHY THE DEVELOPERS ARE    
TALKING ABOUT AIR BASED HEAT    

00:26:54.573 --> 00:26:57.508
ABOUT WHY THE DEVELOPERS ARE    
TALKING ABOUT AIR BASED HEAT    
PUMPS WHEN MOST RECOMMENDATIONS 

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.241
TALKING ABOUT AIR BASED HEAT

FOR SOMEWHERE LIKE ANN ARBOR    

00:26:58.243 --> 00:26:58.976
PUMPS WHEN MOST RECOMMENDATIONS 
FOR SOMEWHERE LIKE ANN ARBOR    
WOULD BE FOR GROUND LOOP HEAT   

00:26:58.978 --> 00:27:01.878
FOR SOMEWHERE LIKE ANN ARBOR    
WOULD BE FOR GROUND LOOP HEAT   
PUMPS WHICH WORK FABULOUSLY IN  

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.212
WOULD BE FOR GROUND LOOP HEAT   
PUMPS WHICH WORK FABULOUSLY IN

I HAVE A FRIEND WHO ACTUALLY    
HAS ONE OF THOSE.               
WE HAVE SOLAR WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE THE

PLANNING TO MAKE THAT           
ELECTRICITY ZERO EMISSION       
SEEMINGLY BEFORE THE FURNACES   

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:18.462
ELECTRICITY ZERO EMISSION       
SEEMINGLY BEFORE THE FURNACES

00:27:18.464 --> 00:27:21.765
SEEMINGLY BEFORE THE FURNACES   
IN THESE UNITS WOULD FAIL.      
SO IT SEEMS ODD THAT THEY WOULD 

00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:22.499
IN THESE UNITS WOULD FAIL.      
SO IT SEEMS ODD THAT THEY WOULD 
BE TALKING ABOUT AIR BASED HEAT 

00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:25.702
SO IT SEEMS ODD THAT THEY WOULD 
BE TALKING ABOUT AIR BASED HEAT

COULD BE TALKING ABOUT HEAT     
PUMPS THAT WOULD WORK           
FABULOUSLY AND THEN IT WOULD BE 

00:27:29.441 --> 00:27:32.208
PUMPS THAT WOULD WORK           
FABULOUSLY AND THEN IT WOULD BE 
MUCH CLOSER TO ZERO EMISSION    

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.143
FABULOUSLY AND THEN IT WOULD BE 
MUCH CLOSER TO ZERO EMISSION

FEEL LIKE THAT                  

00:46:15.832 --> 00:46:17.399
               IS AN            
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF PARKING   
FOR IT.                         

00:46:17.401 --> 00:46:18.134
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF PARKING   
FOR IT.                         
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR  

00:46:18.136 --> 00:46:18.867
FOR IT.                         
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR  
ZONING ACTUALLY SORT OF HAS     

00:46:18.869 --> 00:46:19.668
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR  
ZONING ACTUALLY SORT OF HAS     
ZONED THIS AREA OF OUR CITY IN  

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:20.403
ZONING ACTUALLY SORT OF HAS     
ZONED THIS AREA OF OUR CITY IN  
A WAY THAT MAKES CAR DEPENDENT. 

00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:21.136
ZONED THIS AREA OF OUR CITY IN  
A WAY THAT MAKES CAR DEPENDENT. 
I WISH YOU WOULD CONSIDER       

00:46:21.138 --> 00:46:21.904
A WAY THAT MAKES CAR DEPENDENT. 
I WISH YOU WOULD CONSIDER       
REDUCING PARKING FURTHER THAN   

00:46:21.906 --> 00:46:22.571
I WISH YOU WOULD CONSIDER       
REDUCING PARKING FURTHER THAN   
THE 10 PERCENT YOU HAVE MAYBE   

00:46:22.573 --> 00:46:23.372
REDUCING PARKING FURTHER THAN   
THE 10 PERCENT YOU HAVE MAYBE   
TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.   

00:46:23.374 --> 00:46:25.574
THE 10 PERCENT YOU HAVE MAYBE   
TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.   
I AGREE WITH THE SPEAKERS THAT  

00:46:25.576 --> 00:46:26.508
TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.   
I AGREE WITH THE SPEAKERS THAT  
HAVE SHARED AND I THINK THEY    

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:27.175
I AGREE WITH THE SPEAKERS THAT  
HAVE SHARED AND I THINK THEY    
DID A BETTER JOB THAN THE       

00:46:27.177 --> 00:46:29.778
HAVE SHARED AND I THINK THEY    
DID A BETTER JOB THAN THE       
COMMENTS I PREPARED AROUND THE  

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.682
DID A BETTER JOB THAN THE       
COMMENTS I PREPARED AROUND THE  
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE REST     

00:46:33.684 --> 00:46:34.483
COMMENTS I PREPARED AROUND THE  
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE REST     
OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND I WAS    

00:46:34.485 --> 00:46:37.552
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE REST     
OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND I WAS    
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED AROUND   

00:46:37.554 --> 00:46:42.224
OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND I WAS    
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED AROUND   
THE ATTACHMENTS FMG THAT LOOKED 

00:46:42.226 --> 00:46:45.160
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED AROUND   
THE ATTACHMENTS FMG THAT LOOKED 
AT THOSE HEAT SOURCE HEAT PUMPS 

00:46:45.162 --> 00:46:48.464
THE ATTACHMENTS FMG THAT LOOKED 
AT THOSE HEAT SOURCE HEAT PUMPS 
AND I AND SO I&amp;apos;M APPRECIATIVE   

00:46:48.466 --> 00:46:49.598
AT THOSE HEAT SOURCE HEAT PUMPS 
AND I AND SO I&amp;apos;M APPRECIATIVE   
TO MR. GARBER FOR DOING SOME    

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.834
AND I AND SO I&amp;apos;M APPRECIATIVE   
TO MR. GARBER FOR DOING SOME    
MATH ON THAT AND BRINGING SOME  

00:46:52.836 --> 00:46:56.439
TO MR. GARBER FOR DOING SOME    
MATH ON THAT AND BRINGING SOME  
INFORMATION FOR CONSIDERATION   

00:46:56.441 --> 00:46:57.539
MATH ON THAT AND BRINGING SOME  
INFORMATION FOR CONSIDERATION   
ON HOW YOU COULD ACHIEVE IT.    

00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:59.842
INFORMATION FOR CONSIDERATION   
ON HOW YOU COULD ACHIEVE IT.    
AND THEN MR. CLARKES COMMENT    

00:46:59.844 --> 00:47:01.009
ON HOW YOU COULD ACHIEVE IT.    
AND THEN MR. CLARKES COMMENT    
THAT CAME IN LATE TO US LATE    

00:47:01.011 --> 00:47:04.179
AND THEN MR. CLARKES COMMENT    
THAT CAME IN LATE TO US LATE    
THIS AFTERNOON ASKING FOR SOLAR 

00:47:04.181 --> 00:47:08.150
THAT CAME IN LATE TO US LATE    
THIS AFTERNOON ASKING FOR SOLAR 
IN THERE TO MITIGATE THE COSTS  

00:47:08.152 --> 00:47:08.818
THIS AFTERNOON ASKING FOR SOLAR 
IN THERE TO MITIGATE THE COSTS  
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SPOKE TO US    

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.753
IN THERE TO MITIGATE THE COSTS  
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SPOKE TO US    
EARLIER YOU WERE CONCERNED THAT 

00:47:11.755 --> 00:47:12.521
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SPOKE TO US    
EARLIER YOU WERE CONCERNED THAT 
HAVING A HUNDRED TO TWENTY TO   

00:47:12.523 --> 00:47:15.591
EARLIER YOU WERE CONCERNED THAT 
HAVING A HUNDRED TO TWENTY TO   
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PERCENT  

00:47:15.593 --> 00:47:16.458
HAVING A HUNDRED TO TWENTY TO   
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PERCENT  
INCREASE IN THE UTILITY COSTS   

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.761
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PERCENT  
INCREASE IN THE UTILITY COSTS   
WOULD MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO   

00:47:19.763 --> 00:47:20.329
INCREASE IN THE UTILITY COSTS   
WOULD MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO   
LEASE THOSE UNITS.              

00:47:20.331 --> 00:47:22.698
WOULD MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO   
LEASE THOSE UNITS.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE MATH   

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.699
LEASE THOSE UNITS.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE MATH   
THERE&amp;apos;S SOME SPACE IN THERE TO  

00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:27.035
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE MATH   
THERE&amp;apos;S SOME SPACE IN THERE TO  
GET TO PARITY ON THAT.          

00:47:27.037 --> 00:47:28.237
THERE&amp;apos;S SOME SPACE IN THERE TO  
GET TO PARITY ON THAT.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I JUST WANT TO START  

00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:31.940
GET TO PARITY ON THAT.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I JUST WANT TO START  
MY COMMENTS BY JUST ASKING      

00:47:31.942 --> 00:47:32.541
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I JUST WANT TO START  
MY COMMENTS BY JUST ASKING      
AGAIN FOR COMPLETE              

00:47:32.543 --> 00:47:35.811
MY COMMENTS BY JUST ASKING      
AGAIN FOR COMPLETE              
ELECTRIFICATION.

AGAIN FOR COMPLETE              
ELECTRIFICATION.                
AND THEN I DID HAVE ONE         

00:47:36.748 --> 00:47:39.615
ELECTRIFICATION.                
AND THEN I DID HAVE ONE         
SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR YOU WHICH

TO FULL SCREEN THIS OK, THERE   
WE GO.                          

00:47:49.159 --> 00:47:51.693
TO FULL SCREEN THIS OK, THERE   
WE GO.                          
THEY DON&amp;apos;T HAVE PAGE NUMBERS    

00:47:51.695 --> 00:47:54.863
WE GO.                          
THEY DON&amp;apos;T HAVE PAGE NUMBERS    
BUT IT&amp;apos;S BEFORE EXHIBIT A YOU   

00:47:54.865 --> 00:47:55.431
THEY DON&amp;apos;T HAVE PAGE NUMBERS    
BUT IT&amp;apos;S BEFORE EXHIBIT A YOU   
HAVEN&amp;apos;T READ THE                

00:47:55.433 --> 00:48:00.168
BUT IT&amp;apos;S BEFORE EXHIBIT A YOU   
HAVEN&amp;apos;T READ THE                
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OFFICE 

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.770
HAVEN&amp;apos;T READ THE                
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OFFICE 
OF SUSTAINABILITY AND

RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OFFICE 
OF SUSTAINABILITY AND           
INNOVATION AROUND THE CAMPUS    

00:48:04.142 --> 00:48:07.142
OF SUSTAINABILITY AND           
INNOVATION AROUND THE CAMPUS    
AND I JUST I WASN&amp;apos;T CLEAR       

00:48:07.144 --> 00:48:07.943
INNOVATION AROUND THE CAMPUS    
AND I JUST I WASN&amp;apos;T CLEAR       
WHETHER THE APARTMENT DWELLERS  

00:48:07.945 --> 00:48:12.280
AND I JUST I WASN&amp;apos;T CLEAR       
WHETHER THE APARTMENT DWELLERS  
COULD PARTICIPATE IN COMPOST.   

00:48:12.282 --> 00:48:13.315
WHETHER THE APARTMENT DWELLERS  
COULD PARTICIPATE IN COMPOST.   
SO THAT WAS JUST A QUESTION AS  

00:48:13.317 --> 00:48:15.517
COULD PARTICIPATE IN COMPOST.   
SO THAT WAS JUST A QUESTION AS  
I WAS REVIEWING EVERYTHING THAT 

00:48:15.519 --> 00:48:23.291
SO THAT WAS JUST A QUESTION AS  
I WAS REVIEWING EVERYTHING THAT 
WASN&amp;apos;T APPARENT TO ME.          

00:48:23.293 --> 00:48:24.360
I WAS REVIEWING EVERYTHING THAT 
WASN&amp;apos;T APPARENT TO ME.          
YOU CAN REPLY I THINK THIS IS   

00:48:24.362 --> 00:48:25.560
WASN&amp;apos;T APPARENT TO ME.          
YOU CAN REPLY I THINK THIS IS   
THE TIME WHERE WE GET TO TALK   

00:48:25.562 --> 00:48:29.631
YOU CAN REPLY I THINK THIS IS   
THE TIME WHERE WE GET TO TALK   
TO YOU SPECIFICALLY THOSE       

00:48:29.633 --> 00:48:29.965
THE TIME WHERE WE GET TO TALK   
TO YOU SPECIFICALLY THOSE       
QUESTIONS.

OF ITERATIVE PROCESS AND I      
THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S JUST MAKES    

00:48:38.742 --> 00:48:41.076
OF ITERATIVE PROCESS AND I      
THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S JUST MAKES    
FOR A BETTER PROJECT IN REGARD  

00:48:41.078 --> 00:48:41.510
THINK THAT THAT&amp;apos;S JUST MAKES    
FOR A BETTER PROJECT IN REGARD  
TO THE PARKING.                 

00:48:41.512 --> 00:48:44.313
FOR A BETTER PROJECT IN REGARD  
TO THE PARKING.                 
I UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMENT.      

00:48:44.315 --> 00:48:45.314
TO THE PARKING.                 
I UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMENT.      
WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT.  

00:48:45.316 --> 00:48:48.851
I UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMENT.      
WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT.  
YOU KNOW, WE WE TOOK OUT 10     

00:48:48.853 --> 00:48:49.919
WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT.  
YOU KNOW, WE WE TOOK OUT 10     
PERCENT WHICH FOR US IS A LOT I 

00:48:49.921 --> 00:48:53.022
YOU KNOW, WE WE TOOK OUT 10     
PERCENT WHICH FOR US IS A LOT I 
THINK IN MY MIND WHAT&amp;apos;S WHAT&amp;apos;S  

00:48:53.024 --> 00:48:56.291
PERCENT WHICH FOR US IS A LOT I 
THINK IN MY MIND WHAT&amp;apos;S WHAT&amp;apos;S  
REALLY DRIVING THE NUMBER IS    

00:48:56.293 --> 00:48:57.159
THINK IN MY MIND WHAT&amp;apos;S WHAT&amp;apos;S  
REALLY DRIVING THE NUMBER IS    
THE FACT THAT THERE&amp;apos;S DRIVEWAY  

00:48:57.161 --> 00:49:00.595
REALLY DRIVING THE NUMBER IS    
THE FACT THAT THERE&amp;apos;S DRIVEWAY  
PARKING IN FRONT OF A LOT THOSE 

00:49:00.597 --> 00:49:01.329
THE FACT THAT THERE&amp;apos;S DRIVEWAY  
PARKING IN FRONT OF A LOT THOSE 
UNITS PARTICULARLY ALL OF THE   

00:49:01.331 --> 00:49:03.865
PARKING IN FRONT OF A LOT THOSE 
UNITS PARTICULARLY ALL OF THE   
ATTACHED TO STORY AND THAT JUST 

00:49:03.867 --> 00:49:04.600
UNITS PARTICULARLY ALL OF THE   
ATTACHED TO STORY AND THAT JUST 
REALLY DRIVES UP THE NUMBERS    

00:49:04.602 --> 00:49:07.936
ATTACHED TO STORY AND THAT JUST 
REALLY DRIVES UP THE NUMBERS    
NOW I COULD SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU  

00:49:07.938 --> 00:49:08.837
REALLY DRIVES UP THE NUMBERS    
NOW I COULD SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU  
CAN&amp;apos;T PARK IN THAT AREA BUT I   

00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:12.241
NOW I COULD SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU  
CAN&amp;apos;T PARK IN THAT AREA BUT I   
MEAN IT JUST SEEMS TO BE A      

00:49:12.243 --> 00:49:12.975
CAN&amp;apos;T PARK IN THAT AREA BUT I   
MEAN IT JUST SEEMS TO BE A      
SINGLE FAMILY THING TO HAVE     

00:49:12.977 --> 00:49:15.177
MEAN IT JUST SEEMS TO BE A      
SINGLE FAMILY THING TO HAVE     
PARKING IN FRONT OF THOSE UNITS 

00:49:15.179 --> 00:49:15.911
SINGLE FAMILY THING TO HAVE     
PARKING IN FRONT OF THOSE UNITS 
REALLY NO STREET PARKING.       

00:49:15.913 --> 00:49:16.779
PARKING IN FRONT OF THOSE UNITS 
REALLY NO STREET PARKING.       
SO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GUESTS   

00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:19.248
REALLY NO STREET PARKING.       
SO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GUESTS   
IS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.       

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.982
SO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GUESTS   
IS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.       
SO I THINK THAT SKEWS THE       

00:49:19.984 --> 00:49:22.884
IS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.       
SO I THINK THAT SKEWS THE       
NUMBERS IS WHAT I&amp;apos;M GETTING TO. 

00:49:22.886 --> 00:49:26.488
SO I THINK THAT SKEWS THE       
NUMBERS IS WHAT I&amp;apos;M GETTING TO. 
SO WE&amp;apos;LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.     

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:27.322
NUMBERS IS WHAT I&amp;apos;M GETTING TO. 
SO WE&amp;apos;LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.     
OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO MOVE        

00:49:27.324 --> 00:49:30.226
SO WE&amp;apos;LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.     
OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO MOVE        
FORWARD IF WE CAN WITH APPROVAL 

00:49:30.228 --> 00:49:31.293
OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO MOVE        
FORWARD IF WE CAN WITH APPROVAL 
AND OF COURSE WE CAN LOOK AT    

00:49:31.295 --> 00:49:31.994
FORWARD IF WE CAN WITH APPROVAL 
AND OF COURSE WE CAN LOOK AT    
SOME AREAS THAT THAT MAYBE WE   

00:49:31.996 --> 00:49:33.695
AND OF COURSE WE CAN LOOK AT    
SOME AREAS THAT THAT MAYBE WE   
COULD REDUCE A COUPLE OF I      

00:49:33.697 --> 00:49:34.463
SOME AREAS THAT THAT MAYBE WE   
COULD REDUCE A COUPLE OF I      
THINK TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WOULD 

00:49:34.465 --> 00:49:35.131
COULD REDUCE A COUPLE OF I      
THINK TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WOULD 
BE WAY OVERLY AMBITIOUS FOR US  

00:49:35.133 --> 00:49:37.599
THINK TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WOULD 
BE WAY OVERLY AMBITIOUS FOR US  
TO DO.                          

00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:38.667
BE WAY OVERLY AMBITIOUS FOR US  
TO DO.                          
BUT I&amp;apos;M WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK  

00:49:38.669 --> 00:49:39.601
TO DO.                          
BUT I&amp;apos;M WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK  
AT THAT AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD   

00:49:39.603 --> 00:49:42.304
BUT I&amp;apos;M WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK  
AT THAT AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD   
SO I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF THAT&amp;apos;S       

00:49:42.306 --> 00:49:42.905
AT THAT AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD   
SO I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF THAT&amp;apos;S       
THAT&amp;apos;S CLEAR ENOUGH BUT I       

00:49:42.907 --> 00:49:45.674
SO I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW IF THAT&amp;apos;S       
THAT&amp;apos;S CLEAR ENOUGH BUT I       
UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN.        

00:49:45.676 --> 00:49:46.241
THAT&amp;apos;S CLEAR ENOUGH BUT I       
UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN.

I APPRECIATE IT.                
YOU KNOW, AGREEING WITH THE     
NEIGHBORS ON THE APARTMENT      

00:49:50.047 --> 00:49:53.648
YOU KNOW, AGREEING WITH THE     
NEIGHBORS ON THE APARTMENT      
ELECTRICITY YOU KNOW THERE&amp;apos;S I  

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.552
NEIGHBORS ON THE APARTMENT      
ELECTRICITY YOU KNOW THERE&amp;apos;S I  
GUESS THE WAY TO ANSWER THAT IS 

00:49:56.554 --> 00:49:57.553
ELECTRICITY YOU KNOW THERE&amp;apos;S I

00:50:01.592 --> 00:50:04.826
WITH A PROJECT AND I THINK      
WE&amp;apos;VE GONE FARTHER THAN WE      
NORMALLY WOULD HAVE.            

00:50:04.828 --> 00:50:05.594

00:50:20.511 --> 00:50:21.409
WE DO HAVE AN EXPERT ON ON ZOOM 
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T IF WE NEED TO GO    
INTO SPECIFICS ON IT IN ALL     

00:50:21.411 --> 00:50:24.413
BUT I DON&amp;apos;T IF WE NEED TO GO    
INTO SPECIFICS ON IT IN ALL     
COSTS GAS HAS GONE UP.          

00:50:24.415 --> 00:50:25.147
INTO SPECIFICS ON IT IN ALL     
COSTS GAS HAS GONE UP.

SO TO SAY THAT WE WERE SKEWING  

00:50:28.953 --> 00:50:29.551
ELECTRICITY HAS GONE.           
SO TO SAY THAT WE WERE SKEWING  
THE NUMBERS BECAUSE OF THAT

SO I THINK THAT THEY&amp;apos;RE THERE   
COULD BE A CALL FOR COMPOSTING  

00:54:04.535 --> 00:54:08.804
SO I THINK THAT THEY&amp;apos;RE THERE   
COULD BE A CALL FOR COMPOSTING  
AND WHERE WHERE RESIDENTIAL     

00:54:08.806 --> 00:54:09.571

LONG AS THERE&amp;apos;S A ROUTE AND     

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:23.686
AND SO I MEAN IT&amp;apos;S POSSIBLE AS  
LONG AS THERE&amp;apos;S A ROUTE AND     
SINCE THERE IS A ROUTE AND YOUR 

00:54:23.688 --> 00:54:24.553

AND FOR GAS SYSTEMS YOU CAN&amp;apos;T   
REALLY KIND OF FLIP THE SWITCH  
ELECTRIC SYSTEMS YOU CAN FLIP   

01:01:12.862 --> 01:01:13.662
REALLY KIND OF FLIP THE SWITCH  
ELECTRIC SYSTEMS YOU CAN FLIP   
THE SWITCH FROM WHAT HE IS      

01:01:13.664 --> 01:01:16.531
ELECTRIC SYSTEMS YOU CAN FLIP   
THE SWITCH FROM WHAT HE IS      
DOING.                          

01:01:16.533 --> 01:01:17.399

COMFORTABLE WITH THE YOU KNOW,  
THE CONDITION I WISH IT WOULD   
APPLY TO THE FINAL ENGINEERING  

01:04:29.492 --> 01:04:30.224
THE CONDITION I WISH IT WOULD   
APPLY TO THE FINAL ENGINEERING  
AND NOT TO CITY COUNCIL BUT WE  

01:04:30.226 --> 01:04:32.693

ARMED FORCES ON TOP OF MY MIND  
THE FUTURE SITE PLAN.           
YES, I ASKED LAST TIME ABOUT    

01:04:51.915 --> 01:04:56.150
THE FUTURE SITE PLAN.           
YES, I ASKED LAST TIME ABOUT    
THE ENTRY IN TO THE DEVELOPMENT 

01:04:56.152 --> 01:05:00.021
YES, I ASKED LAST TIME ABOUT    
THE ENTRY IN TO THE DEVELOPMENT 
JOBS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE       

01:05:00.023 --> 01:05:00.755
THE ENTRY IN TO THE DEVELOPMENT 
JOBS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE       
OF THE WETLANDS TO THE ADJACENT 

01:05:00.757 --> 01:05:03.892
JOBS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE       
OF THE WETLANDS TO THE ADJACENT 
DEVELOPMENT AND I LIKE WE&amp;apos;RE    

01:05:03.894 --> 01:05:04.425
OF THE WETLANDS TO THE ADJACENT 
DEVELOPMENT AND I LIKE WE&amp;apos;RE    
NEGOTIATING BETWEEN THE         

01:05:04.427 --> 01:05:07.027
DEVELOPMENT AND I LIKE WE&amp;apos;RE    
NEGOTIATING BETWEEN THE         
WETLANDS VERSUS REGULAR KIND    

01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.996
NEGOTIATING BETWEEN THE         
WETLANDS VERSUS REGULAR KIND    
CONFLICT POINTS FOR THE FUTURE  

01:05:07.998 --> 01:05:08.396
WETLANDS VERSUS REGULAR KIND    
CONFLICT POINTS FOR THE FUTURE

01:05:08.398 --> 01:05:11.065
CONFLICT POINTS FOR THE FUTURE  
DEVELOPMENT.                    
HAVE YOU DONE ANY SCHEMATICS    

01:05:11.067 --> 01:05:14.468
DEVELOPMENT.                    
HAVE YOU DONE ANY SCHEMATICS    
AND JUST IS THERE ANOTHER OUT   

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:15.603
HAVE YOU DONE ANY SCHEMATICS    
AND JUST IS THERE ANOTHER OUT   
TO THE STREET OR IS IT INTERNAL 

01:05:15.605 --> 01:05:16.004
AND JUST IS THERE ANOTHER OUT   
TO THE STREET OR IS IT INTERNAL 
CONNECTION?                     

01:05:16.006 --> 01:05:18.873
TO THE STREET OR IS IT INTERNAL 
CONNECTION?                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WOULD BE THE SAME            

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:19.574
CONNECTION?                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WOULD BE THE SAME            
CONNECTIONS THOSE WE&amp;apos;RE REALLY  

01:05:19.576 --> 01:05:20.307
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WOULD BE THE SAME            
CONNECTIONS THOSE WE&amp;apos;RE REALLY  
STUCK WITH OUR CONNECTIONS.     

01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:23.378
CONNECTIONS THOSE WE&amp;apos;RE REALLY  
STUCK WITH OUR CONNECTIONS.     
THERE&amp;apos;S NO WAY TO GET I MEAN WE 

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.112
STUCK WITH OUR CONNECTIONS.     
THERE&amp;apos;S NO WAY TO GET I MEAN WE 
COULD BUILD A BRIDGE BUT        

01:05:24.114 --> 01:05:27.014
THERE&amp;apos;S NO WAY TO GET I MEAN WE 
COULD BUILD A BRIDGE BUT        
THERE&amp;apos;D BE NO REASON TO DO THAT 

01:05:27.016 --> 01:05:27.749
COULD BUILD A BRIDGE BUT        
THERE&amp;apos;D BE NO REASON TO DO THAT 
SOUTH OF OUR EXISTING ENTRANCE  

01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:30.885
THERE&amp;apos;D BE NO REASON TO DO THAT 
SOUTH OF OUR EXISTING ENTRANCE  
ON PONTCHARTRAIN THERE&amp;apos;S JUST A 

01:05:30.887 --> 01:05:31.552
SOUTH OF OUR EXISTING ENTRANCE  
ON PONTCHARTRAIN THERE&amp;apos;S JUST A 
WETLAND COMPLEX THAT IT&amp;apos;S       

01:05:31.554 --> 01:05:33.788
ON PONTCHARTRAIN THERE&amp;apos;S JUST A 
WETLAND COMPLEX THAT IT&amp;apos;S       
IMPOSSIBLE TO GO OVER.          

01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:34.555
WETLAND COMPLEX THAT IT&amp;apos;S       
IMPOSSIBLE TO GO OVER.          
SO REALLY THE FUTURE            

01:05:34.557 --> 01:05:35.223
IMPOSSIBLE TO GO OVER.          
SO REALLY THE FUTURE            
DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING   

01:05:35.225 --> 01:05:37.725
SO REALLY THE FUTURE            
DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING   
TO SEE, MOST OF IT WILL BE      

01:05:37.727 --> 01:05:38.392
DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING   
TO SEE, MOST OF IT WILL BE      
CONCENTRATED ON THAT AREA.      

01:05:38.394 --> 01:05:39.260
TO SEE, MOST OF IT WILL BE      
CONCENTRATED ON THAT AREA.      
IF YOU REMEMBER THE SITE PLAN   

01:05:39.262 --> 01:05:42.263
CONCENTRATED ON THAT AREA.      
IF YOU REMEMBER THE SITE PLAN   
THE AREA NORTH UP TO DUVAN SO   

01:05:42.265 --> 01:05:42.997
IF YOU REMEMBER THE SITE PLAN   
THE AREA NORTH UP TO DUVAN SO   
THAT THAT WOULD BE WHERE THE    

01:05:42.999 --> 01:05:43.665
THE AREA NORTH UP TO DUVAN SO   
THAT THAT WOULD BE WHERE THE    
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE.    

01:05:43.667 --> 01:05:43.931
THAT THAT WOULD BE WHERE THE    
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OKAY.                        

01:05:43.933 --> 01:05:46.368
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE.    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OKAY.                        
AND THEN MY OTHER WHICH IS      

01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:49.570
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OKAY.                        
AND THEN MY OTHER WHICH IS      
MAYBE MORE OF A NO BECAUSE      

01:05:49.572 --> 01:05:50.404
AND THEN MY OTHER WHICH IS      
MAYBE MORE OF A NO BECAUSE      
WE&amp;apos;VE SEEN ALL OF THESE         

01:05:50.406 --> 01:05:53.641
MAYBE MORE OF A NO BECAUSE      
WE&amp;apos;VE SEEN ALL OF THESE         
DEVELOPMENTS COME ONE BY ONE.   

01:05:53.643 --> 01:05:54.642
WE&amp;apos;VE SEEN ALL OF THESE         
DEVELOPMENTS COME ONE BY ONE.   
IT&amp;apos;S VERY HARD TO PLAN BUT YOU  

01:05:54.644 --> 01:05:56.877
DEVELOPMENTS COME ONE BY ONE.   
IT&amp;apos;S VERY HARD TO PLAN BUT YOU  
KNOW, AS YOU GO IN BEING A GOOD 

01:05:56.879 --> 01:05:57.411
IT&amp;apos;S VERY HARD TO PLAN BUT YOU  
KNOW, AS YOU GO IN BEING A GOOD 
NEIGHBOR AND FINDING            

01:05:57.413 --> 01:05:58.012
KNOW, AS YOU GO IN BEING A GOOD 
NEIGHBOR AND FINDING            
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EACH        

01:05:58.014 --> 01:05:58.813
NEIGHBOR AND FINDING            
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EACH        
OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS, I THINK 

01:05:58.815 --> 01:06:01.148
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EACH        
OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS, I THINK 
REALLY LEANS INTO THE BANKABLE  

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:04.485
OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS, I THINK 
REALLY LEANS INTO THE BANKABLE  
WALKABLE THAT WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO  

01:06:04.487 --> 01:06:05.487
REALLY LEANS INTO THE BANKABLE  
WALKABLE THAT WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO  
GO ON TO THESE HEAVY TRAFFIC    

01:06:05.489 --> 01:06:06.053
WALKABLE THAT WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TO  
GO ON TO THESE HEAVY TRAFFIC    
PATTERNS THAT THERE ARE         

01:06:06.055 --> 01:06:08.323
GO ON TO THESE HEAVY TRAFFIC    
PATTERNS THAT THERE ARE         
NEIGHBORHOODS TO ACTUALLY BUY   

01:06:08.325 --> 01:06:08.790
PATTERNS THAT THERE ARE         
NEIGHBORHOODS TO ACTUALLY BUY   
THROUGH.                        

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:09.190
NEIGHBORHOODS TO ACTUALLY BUY   
THROUGH.                        
YES.                            

01:06:09.192 --> 01:06:09.991
THROUGH.                        
YES.                            
TO REALLY CUT THROUGH BETWEEN   

01:06:09.993 --> 01:06:10.325
YES.                            
TO REALLY CUT THROUGH BETWEEN   
EACH ONE.                       

01:06:10.327 --> 01:06:11.926
TO REALLY CUT THROUGH BETWEEN   
EACH ONE.                       
BUT RIGHT NOW WE&amp;apos;RE DEVELOPING  

01:06:11.928 --> 01:06:12.460
EACH ONE.                       
BUT RIGHT NOW WE&amp;apos;RE DEVELOPING  
ISOLATED NEIGHBORHOODS.         

01:06:12.462 --> 01:06:13.561
BUT RIGHT NOW WE&amp;apos;RE DEVELOPING  
ISOLATED NEIGHBORHOODS.         
I&amp;apos;LL REACH OUT ONTO IT AND SORT 

01:06:13.563 --> 01:06:16.197
ISOLATED NEIGHBORHOODS.         
I&amp;apos;LL REACH OUT ONTO IT AND SORT 
OF REACH INTO EACH OTHER&amp;apos;S KIND 

01:06:16.199 --> 01:06:16.764
I&amp;apos;LL REACH OUT ONTO IT AND SORT 
OF REACH INTO EACH OTHER&amp;apos;S KIND 
OF BACKYARDS AND ROADS.         

01:06:16.766 --> 01:06:20.601
OF REACH INTO EACH OTHER&amp;apos;S KIND 
OF BACKYARDS AND ROADS.         
SO AS YOU GET GOING, IF YOU     

01:06:20.603 --> 01:06:21.302
OF BACKYARDS AND ROADS.         
SO AS YOU GET GOING, IF YOU     
FIND CONNECTION POINTS TO       

01:06:21.304 --> 01:06:23.571
SO AS YOU GET GOING, IF YOU     
FIND CONNECTION POINTS TO       
ENGINEER AND CUT ACROSS         

01:06:23.573 --> 01:06:24.372
FIND CONNECTION POINTS TO       
ENGINEER AND CUT ACROSS         
PROPERTY LINES TO MERGE THOSE   

01:06:24.374 --> 01:06:25.239
ENGINEER AND CUT ACROSS         
PROPERTY LINES TO MERGE THOSE   
STREETS, I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S A       

01:06:25.241 --> 01:06:28.009
PROPERTY LINES TO MERGE THOSE   
STREETS, I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S A       
FANTASTIC MOVEMENT FORWARD FOR  

01:06:28.011 --> 01:06:31.479
STREETS, I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S A       
FANTASTIC MOVEMENT FORWARD FOR  
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE AREA UP     

01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:31.946
FANTASTIC MOVEMENT FORWARD FOR  
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE AREA UP     
HERE.                           

01:06:31.948 --> 01:06:32.881
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE AREA UP     
HERE.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MORE DEVELOPERS CAN WORK 

01:06:32.883 --> 01:06:33.348
HERE.                           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MORE DEVELOPERS CAN WORK 
TOGETHER TO CONNECT,            

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:36.050
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE MORE DEVELOPERS CAN WORK 
TOGETHER TO CONNECT,            
INTERCONNECT LOTS WOULD BE      

01:06:36.052 --> 01:06:36.383
TOGETHER TO CONNECT,            
INTERCONNECT LOTS WOULD BE      
GREAT.                          

01:06:36.385 --> 01:06:42.524
INTERCONNECT LOTS WOULD BE      
GREAT.                          
OK, UM                          

01:06:57.006 --> 01:06:59.874
       THE LAST ONE I JUST LIKE 
KIND OF A COMMENT THE PARKING I 
APPRECIATE KIND OF THE REMOVAL  

01:06:59.876 --> 01:07:00.607
KIND OF A COMMENT THE PARKING I 
APPRECIATE KIND OF THE REMOVAL  
OF PARKING AGAIN I&amp;apos;LL JUST KIND 

01:07:00.609 --> 01:07:01.409
APPRECIATE KIND OF THE REMOVAL  
OF PARKING AGAIN I&amp;apos;LL JUST KIND 
OF SAY TO MY JUSTIFICATION I    

01:07:01.411 --> 01:07:02.276
OF PARKING AGAIN I&amp;apos;LL JUST KIND 
OF SAY TO MY JUSTIFICATION I    
DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TOO MUCH ISSUE WITH  

01:07:02.278 --> 01:07:02.944
OF SAY TO MY JUSTIFICATION I    
DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TOO MUCH ISSUE WITH  
THE STACK PARKING LOT MORE      

01:07:02.946 --> 01:07:03.477
DON&amp;apos;T HAVE TOO MUCH ISSUE WITH  
THE STACK PARKING LOT MORE      
RECENTLY APPLAUDED STACK        

01:07:03.479 --> 01:07:04.278
THE STACK PARKING LOT MORE      
RECENTLY APPLAUDED STACK        
PARKING AS A WAY TO COUNT IT    

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:04.879
RECENTLY APPLAUDED STACK        
PARKING AS A WAY TO COUNT IT    
WHEN WE HAD PARKING MINIMUMS    

01:07:04.881 --> 01:07:05.679
PARKING AS A WAY TO COUNT IT    
WHEN WE HAD PARKING MINIMUMS    
BUT BECAUSE THOSE CURBS TO THE  

01:07:05.681 --> 01:07:06.447
WHEN WE HAD PARKING MINIMUMS    
BUT BECAUSE THOSE CURBS TO THE  
DRIVEWAYS REALLY LENGTHENED TO  

01:07:06.449 --> 01:07:07.181
BUT BECAUSE THOSE CURBS TO THE  
DRIVEWAYS REALLY LENGTHENED TO  
THE STREET THAT BECOMES YOU     

01:07:07.183 --> 01:07:07.915
DRIVEWAYS REALLY LENGTHENED TO  
THE STREET THAT BECOMES YOU     
KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S LIKE SIDEWALK CHALK  

01:07:07.917 --> 01:07:08.649
THE STREET THAT BECOMES YOU     
KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S LIKE SIDEWALK CHALK  
AND A PLACE TO LEARN HOW TO     

01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:10.451
KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S LIKE SIDEWALK CHALK  
AND A PLACE TO LEARN HOW TO     
RIDE A BIKE AND FOR TOYS TO     

01:07:10.453 --> 01:07:11.251
AND A PLACE TO LEARN HOW TO     
RIDE A BIKE AND FOR TOYS TO     
SPILL OUT FROM THE GARAGE AND   

01:07:11.253 --> 01:07:11.719
RIDE A BIKE AND FOR TOYS TO     
SPILL OUT FROM THE GARAGE AND   
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:16:05.988 --> 01:16:09.123
SOMETHING TO JUST PUT ON YOUR   
RADAR.                          
SIMILARLY IF THIS IF THE RENTAL 

01:16:09.125 --> 01:16:10.223
RADAR.                          
SIMILARLY IF THIS IF THE RENTAL 
UNITS EVER DO ELECTRIFY AND I   

01:16:10.225 --> 01:16:13.928
SIMILARLY IF THIS IF THE RENTAL 
UNITS EVER DO ELECTRIFY AND I   
AGREE WITH THE CALLER THAT IT&amp;apos;S 

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:17.764
UNITS EVER DO ELECTRIFY AND I   
AGREE WITH THE CALLER THAT IT&amp;apos;S 
MUCH LIKE THE FOR SALE UNITS    

01:16:17.766 --> 01:16:20.600
AGREE WITH THE CALLER THAT IT&amp;apos;S 
MUCH LIKE THE FOR SALE UNITS    
HAVE MORE AUTONOMY KIND OF IN   

01:16:20.602 --> 01:16:21.302
MUCH LIKE THE FOR SALE UNITS    
HAVE MORE AUTONOMY KIND OF IN   
THEIR MECHANICAL SYSTEMS.       

01:16:21.304 --> 01:16:24.871
HAVE MORE AUTONOMY KIND OF IN   
THEIR MECHANICAL SYSTEMS.       
AND SO IF I HAD TO CHOOSE I     

01:16:24.873 --> 01:16:28.041
THEIR MECHANICAL SYSTEMS.       
AND SO IF I HAD TO CHOOSE I     
WOULD I WOULD PUT THE THE       

01:16:28.043 --> 01:16:29.009
AND SO IF I HAD TO CHOOSE I     
WOULD I WOULD PUT THE THE       
ELECTRIC HEATING IN THE THE     

01:16:29.011 --> 01:16:32.712
WOULD I WOULD PUT THE THE       
ELECTRIC HEATING IN THE THE     
RENTAL UNITS BECAUSE OF THAT    

01:16:32.714 --> 01:16:39.386
ELECTRIC HEATING IN THE THE     
RENTAL UNITS BECAUSE OF THAT    
LACK OF AUTONOMY THERE I WOULD  

01:16:39.388 --> 01:16:40.253
RENTAL UNITS BECAUSE OF THAT    
LACK OF AUTONOMY THERE I WOULD  
JUST THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN      

01:16:40.255 --> 01:16:40.921
LACK OF AUTONOMY THERE I WOULD  
JUST THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN      
YOU&amp;apos;RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE  

01:16:40.923 --> 01:16:43.323
JUST THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN      
YOU&amp;apos;RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE  
SIZE OF YOUR CONNECTION IS AND  

01:16:43.325 --> 01:16:44.191
YOU&amp;apos;RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE  
SIZE OF YOUR CONNECTION IS AND  
AND SOME OF THE INTERCONNECTION 

01:16:44.193 --> 01:16:47.327
SIZE OF YOUR CONNECTION IS AND  
AND SOME OF THE INTERCONNECTION 
COSTS IT&amp;apos;S WAY CHEAPER NOW THAN 

01:16:47.329 --> 01:16:48.095
AND SOME OF THE INTERCONNECTION 
COSTS IT&amp;apos;S WAY CHEAPER NOW THAN 
IT IS DOWN THE ROAD AND         

01:16:48.097 --> 01:16:48.763
COSTS IT&amp;apos;S WAY CHEAPER NOW THAN 
IT IS DOWN THE ROAD AND         
PARTICULARLY FOR WHOEVER THE    

01:16:48.765 --> 01:16:51.498
IT IS DOWN THE ROAD AND

PARTICULARLY FOR WHOEVER THE    
OWNERS OF THOSE BUILDINGS WILL  
BE AND OBVIOUSLY WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO

OWNERS OF THOSE BUILDINGS WILL  
BE AND OBVIOUSLY WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO 
OWN ONLY APARTMENTS.

BE AND OBVIOUSLY WE&amp;apos;RE GOING TO 
OWN ONLY APARTMENTS.            
SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO US TO     

01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:55.235
OWN ONLY APARTMENTS.            
SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO US TO     
THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE.         

01:16:55.237 --> 01:16:56.003
SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO US TO

SO CERTAINLY FOR THE            
REPLACEMENT YOU KNOW, I DO      

01:16:59.274 --> 01:16:59.940
SO CERTAINLY FOR THE            
REPLACEMENT YOU KNOW, I DO      
BELIEVE THAT THOSE COSTS WILL   

01:16:59.942 --> 01:17:06.480
REPLACEMENT YOU KNOW, I DO      
BELIEVE THAT THOSE COSTS WILL   
COME DOWN TO WHERE IT MAKES     

01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:22.296
SENSE AND SO WE DO WANT TO PLAN 
FOR THE FUTURE WITH THAT.       
SO THAT IS NO QUESTION ABOUT    

01:17:22.298 --> 01:17:22.563
FOR THE FUTURE WITH THAT.       
SO THAT IS NO QUESTION ABOUT    
IT.                             

01:17:22.565 --> 01:17:23.164

ONE ACTIVE DEVINE AND PONTIAC   

01:23:13.749 --> 01:23:14.681
GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET 
ONE ACTIVE DEVINE AND PONTIAC   
IF WE GET THIS FEDERAL GRANT    

01:23:14.683 --> 01:23:18.318
ONE ACTIVE DEVINE AND PONTIAC   
IF WE GET THIS FEDERAL GRANT    
WHICH IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE TO ME 

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.186
IF WE GET THIS FEDERAL GRANT    
WHICH IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE TO ME 
IT TAKES TWO YEARS TO EVEN HEAR 

01:23:19.188 --> 01:23:20.988
WHICH IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE TO ME 
IT TAKES TWO YEARS TO EVEN HEAR 
ABOUT THE GRANT.                

01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.388
IT TAKES TWO YEARS TO EVEN HEAR 
ABOUT THE GRANT.                
RIGHT.                          

01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:22.456
ABOUT THE GRANT.                
RIGHT.

01:23:22.458 --> 01:23:25.125
RIGHT.                          
AND SO THIS WOULD BE THAT WAS   
WHAT WAS IN THE STAFF MEMO      

01:23:25.127 --> 01:23:25.993
AND SO THIS WOULD BE THAT WAS   
WHAT WAS IN THE STAFF MEMO      
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF TWENTY 

01:23:25.995 --> 01:23:29.262
WHAT WAS IN THE STAFF MEMO      
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF TWENTY 
TWENTY SIX FOR TRAFFIC LEAF     

01:23:29.264 --> 01:23:30.196
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF TWENTY 
TWENTY SIX FOR TRAFFIC LEAF     
THAT WE HAVE NEEDED FOR THE     

01:23:30.198 --> 01:23:33.833
TWENTY SIX FOR TRAFFIC LEAF     
THAT WE HAVE NEEDED FOR THE     
LAST YOU KNOW, DURING THE COVID 

01:23:33.835 --> 01:23:34.167
THAT WE HAVE NEEDED FOR THE

SO YOU&amp;apos;RE WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE WORRIED   

01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:42.009
SO IS SO I&amp;apos;M NOT SURE.          
SO YOU&amp;apos;RE WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE WORRIED   
ABOUT IS WELL IT&amp;apos;S THAT THE

SO YOU&amp;apos;RE WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE WORRIED   
ABOUT IS WELL IT&amp;apos;S THAT THE     
STUDY AT THE STUDY SUGGESTS     

01:23:45.614 --> 01:23:49.249
ABOUT IS WELL IT&amp;apos;S THAT THE     
STUDY AT THE STUDY SUGGESTS     
FOUR LOCATIONS INCLUDING THE    

01:23:49.251 --> 01:23:50.050
STUDY AT THE STUDY SUGGESTS     
FOUR LOCATIONS INCLUDING THE    
ONE THAT SOUNDS LIKE BARTON IS  

01:23:50.052 --> 01:23:50.850
FOUR LOCATIONS INCLUDING THE    
ONE THAT SOUNDS LIKE BARTON IS  
INFEASIBLE BUT THAT IS ON THE   

01:23:50.852 --> 01:23:52.919
ONE THAT SOUNDS LIKE BARTON IS  
INFEASIBLE BUT THAT IS ON THE   
LIST THIS SPECIFIC THE THE

DEVELOPMENT VILLAGE OF OVER     

01:23:57.192 --> 01:24:01.027
CONNECTING NEW RESIDENTIAL      
DEVELOPMENT VILLAGE OF OVER     
HERE IS ON THE LIST IN ADDITION 

01:24:01.029 --> 01:24:04.230
DEVELOPMENT VILLAGE OF OVER     
HERE IS ON THE LIST IN ADDITION 
TO DUVAN AND THEN ALSO MORE     

01:24:04.232 --> 01:24:05.164
HERE IS ON THE LIST IN ADDITION 
TO DUVAN AND THEN ALSO MORE     
STREET AND SHAW STREET THAT     

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:08.101

STREET AND SHAW STREET THAT     
KIND OF CONNECT LIKE THE        

01:24:08.103 --> 01:24:08.802
STREET AND SHAW STREET THAT     
KIND OF CONNECT LIKE THE        
INTERSECTION WITH PONTIAC.      

01:24:08.804 --> 01:24:12.672
KIND OF CONNECT LIKE THE        
INTERSECTION WITH PONTIAC.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I&amp;apos;M JUST I KNOW THAT      

01:24:12.674 --> 01:24:13.339
INTERSECTION WITH PONTIAC.      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I&amp;apos;M JUST I KNOW THAT      
THERE WAS DISCUSSION SOUTH      

01:24:13.341 --> 01:24:13.740
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I&amp;apos;M JUST I KNOW THAT      
THERE WAS DISCUSSION SOUTH      
OF THIS.                        

01:24:13.742 --> 01:24:15.609
THERE WAS DISCUSSION SOUTH      
OF THIS.                        
I KNOW CLEARLY IMPROVEMENT      

01:24:15.611 --> 01:24:16.509
OF THIS.                        
I KNOW CLEARLY IMPROVEMENT      
NORTH OF THIS MAKES SENSE LIKE  

01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:20.346
I KNOW CLEARLY IMPROVEMENT      
NORTH OF THIS MAKES SENSE LIKE  
THAT&amp;apos;S ALREADY.                 

01:24:20.348 --> 01:24:21.181
NORTH OF THIS MAKES SENSE LIKE  
THAT&amp;apos;S ALREADY.                 
BUT BECAUSE WE&amp;apos;RE MAKING A NEW  

01:24:21.183 --> 01:24:23.649
THAT&amp;apos;S ALREADY.                 
BUT BECAUSE WE&amp;apos;RE MAKING A NEW  
CONNECTION HERE, IT SEEMS ODD   

01:24:23.651 --> 01:24:24.584
BUT BECAUSE WE&amp;apos;RE MAKING A NEW  
CONNECTION HERE, IT SEEMS ODD   
TO NOT HAVE THAT DISCUSSION     

01:24:24.586 --> 01:24:27.153
CONNECTION HERE, IT SEEMS ODD   
TO NOT HAVE THAT DISCUSSION     
ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF THAT   

01:24:27.155 --> 01:24:32.159
TO NOT HAVE THAT DISCUSSION     
ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF THAT   
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT HASN&amp;apos;T 

01:24:32.161 --> 01:24:32.825
ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF THAT   
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT HASN&amp;apos;T 
BEEN CONNECTED YET.             

01:24:32.827 --> 01:24:35.895
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT HASN&amp;apos;T 
BEEN CONNECTED YET.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I FEEL LIKE NOW IS    

01:24:35.897 --> 01:24:36.563
BEEN CONNECTED YET.             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I FEEL LIKE NOW IS    
KIND OF OUR OPPORTUNITY TO      

01:24:36.565 --> 01:24:39.532
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND SO I FEEL LIKE NOW IS    
KIND OF OUR OPPORTUNITY TO      
UNDERSTAND IF IT&amp;apos;S FEASIBLE     

01:24:39.534 --> 01:24:40.533
KIND OF OUR OPPORTUNITY TO      
UNDERSTAND IF IT&amp;apos;S FEASIBLE     
ANYWAY I THE OTHER HANDS AROUND 

01:24:40.535 --> 01:24:43.770
UNDERSTAND IF IT&amp;apos;S FEASIBLE     
ANYWAY I THE OTHER HANDS AROUND 
THAT&amp;apos;S DR. CLARK I WANTED TO    

01:24:43.772 --> 01:24:46.940
ANYWAY I THE OTHER HANDS AROUND 
THAT&amp;apos;S DR. CLARK I WANTED TO    
MENTION THE BARTON ONE.         

01:24:46.942 --> 01:24:50.676
THAT&amp;apos;S DR. CLARK I WANTED TO    
MENTION THE BARTON ONE.         
IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT A SIDE THAT I 

01:24:50.678 --> 01:24:51.444
MENTION THE BARTON ONE.         
IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT A SIDE THAT I 
BELIEVE THAT IT WASN&amp;apos;T THERE    

01:24:51.446 --> 01:24:52.245
IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT A SIDE THAT I 
BELIEVE THAT IT WASN&amp;apos;T THERE    
WAS INFEASIBLE IT WAS THAT THEY 

01:24:52.247 --> 01:24:54.981
BELIEVE THAT IT WASN&amp;apos;T THERE    
WAS INFEASIBLE IT WAS THAT THEY 
WOULD IMPACT A LEVEL OF SERVICE 

01:24:54.983 --> 01:24:55.648
WAS INFEASIBLE IT WAS THAT THEY 
WOULD IMPACT A LEVEL OF SERVICE 
WHICH IS JUST THE MEASURE       

01:24:55.650 --> 01:24:58.352
WOULD IMPACT A LEVEL OF SERVICE 
WHICH IS JUST THE MEASURE       
OF LIKE HOW MANY CARS PASS      

01:24:58.354 --> 01:24:59.085
WHICH IS JUST THE MEASURE       
OF LIKE HOW MANY CARS PASS      
THROUGH AND HOW QUICKLY.        

01:24:59.087 --> 01:25:00.019
OF LIKE HOW MANY CARS PASS      
THROUGH AND HOW QUICKLY.        
SO THE LOWERTOWN STUDY DOES     

01:25:00.021 --> 01:25:03.156
THROUGH AND HOW QUICKLY.        
SO THE LOWERTOWN STUDY DOES     
MENTIONER AND I DON&amp;apos;T I DON&amp;apos;T

01:25:04.459 --> 01:25:06.526
KNOW IF WE WANT TO WRITE THAT   
OFF RIGHT AWAY.                 
IT IS INVISIBLE.                

01:25:06.528 --> 01:25:07.561
OFF RIGHT AWAY.                 
IT IS INVISIBLE.                
I VIEW IT AS PRIORITIES.        

01:25:07.563 --> 01:25:10.964
IT IS INVISIBLE.                
I VIEW IT AS PRIORITIES.        
BUT ANYWAY, COMMISSIONER SAUVé  

01:25:10.966 --> 01:25:14.368

BUT ANYWAY, COMMISSIONER SAUVé  
I LATELY ALLUDED TO THIS IN     

01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.235

I LATELY ALLUDED TO THIS IN     
TERMS OF THE CONVERSATION I HAD 

01:25:15.237 --> 01:25:18.071
I LATELY ALLUDED TO THIS IN     
TERMS OF THE CONVERSATION I HAD 
LAST TIME ABOUT THE STAGGERED   

01:25:18.073 --> 01:25:18.739
TERMS OF THE CONVERSATION I HAD 
LAST TIME ABOUT THE STAGGERED   
ENTRIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TO

01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:23.076
ENTRIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TO  
THE WEST ON FRONTIER TRAIL.     
SO THAT WAS OUR CONVERSATION    

01:25:23.078 --> 01:25:26.245
THE WEST ON FRONTIER TRAIL.     
SO THAT WAS OUR CONVERSATION

KIND OF STAGGERED AND THAT      

01:25:33.855 --> 01:25:34.588
INTERSECTION INSTEAD OF THE     
KIND OF STAGGERED AND THAT      
DISCUSSION FROM LAST TIME WAS A 

01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:36.489
KIND OF STAGGERED AND THAT

MITIGATION AND THE CLEARANCES   
AND THE RIGHT OF WAY AVAILABLE. 

01:25:38.027 --> 01:25:41.494
MITIGATION AND THE CLEARANCES   
AND THE RIGHT OF WAY AVAILABLE. 
SO WE DID HAVE A DISCUSSION     

01:25:41.496 --> 01:25:42.229
AND THE RIGHT OF WAY AVAILABLE. 
SO WE DID HAVE A DISCUSSION     
REALLY AT THAT INTERSECTION     

01:25:42.231 --> 01:25:45.098
SO WE DID HAVE A DISCUSSION     
REALLY AT THAT INTERSECTION     
OF THE ENTRY ALONG PONTIAC      

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:45.765
REALLY AT THAT INTERSECTION     
OF THE ENTRY ALONG PONTIAC      
TRAIL FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT      

01:25:45.767 --> 01:25:48.968
OF THE ENTRY ALONG PONTIAC      
TRAIL FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT      
RELATIVE TO EVEN SLIGHTLY       

01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:49.669
TRAIL FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT      
RELATIVE TO EVEN SLIGHTLY       
SHIFTING IT WHAT A ROUNDABOUT   

01:25:49.671 --> 01:25:50.436
RELATIVE TO EVEN SLIGHTLY       
SHIFTING IT WHAT A ROUNDABOUT   
WOULD LOOK LIKE THE AMOUNT      

01:25:50.438 --> 01:25:53.206
SHIFTING IT WHAT A ROUNDABOUT   
WOULD LOOK LIKE THE AMOUNT      
OF FOOTPRINT FOR IT, THE        

01:25:53.208 --> 01:25:57.043
WOULD LOOK LIKE THE AMOUNT      
OF FOOTPRINT FOR IT, THE        
EXTENSION FOR BUS STOP BIKE     

01:25:57.045 --> 01:26:00.813
OF FOOTPRINT FOR IT, THE        
EXTENSION FOR BUS STOP BIKE     
LANE SIDEWALK ALL ALONG THAT

AND A LOT OF IT WAS MAYBE IN A  

01:26:07.989 --> 01:26:08.688
INTERSECTION IF THAT&amp;apos;S HELPFUL  
AND A LOT OF IT WAS MAYBE IN A  
LOWERTOWN STUDY NOT UNDERSTAND  

01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:13.026
AND A LOT OF IT WAS MAYBE IN A  
LOWERTOWN STUDY NOT UNDERSTAND  
THE EXTENT OF THE SURVEY FOR    

01:26:13.028 --> 01:26:13.893
LOWERTOWN STUDY NOT UNDERSTAND  
THE EXTENT OF THE SURVEY FOR

THAT HIGH LEVEL THAT HAS BEEN   
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONCE THEY

THAT HIGH LEVEL THAT HAS BEEN   
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONCE THEY    
ACTUALLY GOT ONTO THIS PARCEL   

01:26:18.533 --> 01:26:20.500
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONCE THEY
