THEIR SUCCESS ORGANIZED AROUND

THAT CENTRAL BEHIND THAT THAT   
CENTRAL OPEN SPACE THAT WE      
TALKED ABOUT AND TRYING TO FIND 

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.086
CENTRAL OPEN SPACE THAT WE      
TALKED ABOUT AND TRYING TO FIND 
WAYS IN WHICH WE WERE           

00:52:01.088 --> 00:52:01.653
TALKED ABOUT AND TRYING TO FIND 
WAYS IN WHICH WE WERE           
CONTROLLING THE STREET.         

00:52:01.655 --> 00:52:04.322
WAYS IN WHICH WE WERE           
CONTROLLING THE STREET.         
SO WE'RE CONTROLLING BOTH SIDES 

00:52:04.324 --> 00:52:07.326
CONTROLLING THE STREET.         
SO WE'RE CONTROLLING BOTH SIDES 
OF THE STREET STREET TREES,     

00:52:07.328 --> 00:52:08.193
SO WE'RE CONTROLLING BOTH SIDES 
OF THE STREET STREET TREES,     
PARKING SPOTS, THAT SORT        

00:52:08.195 --> 00:52:11.129
OF THE STREET STREET TREES,     
PARKING SPOTS, THAT SORT        
OF THING, BUT ALSO MAKING SURE  

00:52:11.131 --> 00:52:12.130
PARKING SPOTS, THAT SORT        
OF THING, BUT ALSO MAKING SURE  
WE ARE INTEGRATING THE EXISTING 

00:52:12.132 --> 00:52:15.133
OF THING, BUT ALSO MAKING SURE  
WE ARE INTEGRATING THE EXISTING 
BUILDINGS AS WELL WHICH WEREN'T 

00:52:15.135 --> 00:52:15.934
WE ARE INTEGRATING THE EXISTING 
BUILDINGS AS WELL WHICH WEREN'T 
DESIGNED WITH SOME OF THOSE     

00:52:15.936 --> 00:52:16.401
BUILDINGS AS WELL WHICH WEREN'T 
DESIGNED WITH SOME OF THOSE     
THINGS IN MIND.                 

00:52:16.403 --> 00:52:18.903
DESIGNED WITH SOME OF THOSE     
THINGS IN MIND.                 
AND SO SOME OF THE SMALLER      

00:52:18.905 --> 00:52:19.905
THINGS IN MIND.                 
AND SO SOME OF THE SMALLER      
BUILDINGS IN THE MIDDLE ARE     

00:52:19.907 --> 00:52:20.572
AND SO SOME OF THE SMALLER      
BUILDINGS IN THE MIDDLE ARE     
MEANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE   

00:52:20.574 --> 00:52:23.641
BUILDINGS IN THE MIDDLE ARE     
MEANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE   
BREAKING DOWN THE SCALE SO THAT 

00:52:23.643 --> 00:52:24.342
MEANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE   
BREAKING DOWN THE SCALE SO THAT 
ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS FEEL     

00:52:24.344 --> 00:52:24.910
BREAKING DOWN THE SCALE SO THAT 
ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS FEEL     
LIKE THEY'RE A PART             

00:52:24.912 --> 00:52:29.347
ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS FEEL     
LIKE THEY'RE A PART             
OF SOMETHING BIGGER.            

00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:30.449
LIKE THEY'RE A PART             
OF SOMETHING BIGGER.            
THIS IS AN EARLY RENDER FOR     

00:52:30.451 --> 00:52:33.852
OF SOMETHING BIGGER.            
THIS IS AN EARLY RENDER FOR     
THAT THAT CENTRAL OPEN SPACE    

00:52:33.854 --> 00:52:36.555
THIS IS AN EARLY RENDER FOR     
THAT THAT CENTRAL OPEN SPACE    
AND THEY SAY EARLY BECAUSE      

00:52:36.557 --> 00:52:37.423
THAT THAT CENTRAL OPEN SPACE    
AND THEY SAY EARLY BECAUSE      
THERE'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH GREEN 

00:52:37.425 --> 00:52:38.189
AND THEY SAY EARLY BECAUSE      
THERE'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH GREEN 
IN IT DRIVES ME NUTS EVERY TIME 

00:52:38.191 --> 00:52:38.590
THERE'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH GREEN 
IN IT DRIVES ME NUTS EVERY TIME 
I SEE IT.                       

00:52:38.592 --> 00:52:41.693
IN IT DRIVES ME NUTS EVERY TIME 
I SEE IT.                       
HOWEVER, THERE IS SOMETHING     

00:52:41.695 --> 00:52:42.428
I SEE IT.                       
HOWEVER, THERE IS SOMETHING     
REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT IN     

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:44.629
HOWEVER, THERE IS SOMETHING     
REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT IN     
THIS IMAGE THAT I THINK I WANT  

00:52:44.631 --> 00:52:45.530
REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT IN     
THIS IMAGE THAT I THINK I WANT  
TO MAKE SURE I GET ACROSS AND   

00:52:45.532 --> 00:52:48.700
THIS IMAGE THAT I THINK I WANT  
TO MAKE SURE I GET ACROSS AND   
THAT IS THAT THIS PLACE AND     

00:52:48.702 --> 00:52:49.468
TO MAKE SURE I GET ACROSS AND   
THAT IS THAT THIS PLACE AND     
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET HERE    

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:53.038
THAT IS THAT THIS PLACE AND     
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET HERE    
NEEDS TO FEEL LIKE WE'VE SOFTEN 

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:53.838
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET HERE    
NEEDS TO FEEL LIKE WE'VE SOFTEN 
THE EDGES SO THAT THE           

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.875
NEEDS TO FEEL LIKE WE'VE SOFTEN 
THE EDGES SO THAT THE           
PEDESTRIAN FEELS PRIMARY AND    

00:52:56.877 --> 00:52:57.442
THE EDGES SO THAT THE           
PEDESTRIAN FEELS PRIMARY AND    
THE CAR FEELS SEPARATE.         

00:52:57.444 --> 00:53:00.713
PEDESTRIAN FEELS PRIMARY AND    
THE CAR FEELS SEPARATE.         
WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT   

00:53:00.715 --> 00:53:01.513
THE CAR FEELS SEPARATE.         
WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT   
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE CARS   

00:53:01.515 --> 00:53:02.347
WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT   
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE CARS   
HERE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT 

00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:05.050
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE CARS   
HERE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT 
THEY HAVE TO RULE THE STREETS.  

00:53:05.052 --> 00:53:05.984
HERE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT 
THEY HAVE TO RULE THE STREETS.  
AND SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT    

00:53:05.986 --> 00:53:09.054
THEY HAVE TO RULE THE STREETS.  
AND SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT    
WAYS IN WHICH ASPHALT BECOMES   

00:53:09.056 --> 00:53:11.756
AND SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT    
WAYS IN WHICH ASPHALT BECOMES   
PAVING RIGHT WHERE THERE AREN'T 

00:53:11.758 --> 00:53:12.557
WAYS IN WHICH ASPHALT BECOMES   
PAVING RIGHT WHERE THERE AREN'T 
CURB LINES BUT RATHER BOLLARDS. 

00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:15.794
PAVING RIGHT WHERE THERE AREN'T 
CURB LINES BUT RATHER BOLLARDS. 
THE IDEA THAT FOR CERTAIN       

00:53:15.796 --> 00:53:16.561
CURB LINES BUT RATHER BOLLARDS. 
THE IDEA THAT FOR CERTAIN       
EVENTS WE COULD SHUT THE        

00:53:16.563 --> 00:53:20.532
THE IDEA THAT FOR CERTAIN       
EVENTS WE COULD SHUT THE        
STREETS DOWN COMPLETELY AND YET 

00:53:20.534 --> 00:53:21.199
EVENTS WE COULD SHUT THE        
STREETS DOWN COMPLETELY AND YET 
THE SERVICEABILITY OF THE       

00:53:21.201 --> 00:53:21.834
STREETS DOWN COMPLETELY AND YET 
THE SERVICEABILITY OF THE       
NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE           

00:53:21.836 --> 00:53:24.435
THE SERVICEABILITY OF THE       
NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE           
MAINTAINED AND WHICH IS A PART  

00:53:24.437 --> 00:53:25.036
NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE           
MAINTAINED AND WHICH IS A PART  
OF WHAT THAT GRID OF STREETS    

00:53:25.038 --> 00:53:27.605
MAINTAINED AND WHICH IS A PART  
OF WHAT THAT GRID OF STREETS    
THAT WERE CREATED IS REALLY,    

00:53:27.607 --> 00:53:28.339
OF WHAT THAT GRID OF STREETS    
THAT WERE CREATED IS REALLY,    
REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE        

00:53:28.341 --> 00:53:28.974
THAT WERE CREATED IS REALLY,    
REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE        
LOCATION OF THE ENTRANCES AND   

00:53:28.976 --> 00:53:32.010
REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE        
LOCATION OF THE ENTRANCES AND   
EXITS TO THOSE GARAGES BECOME   

00:53:32.012 --> 00:53:34.980
LOCATION OF THE ENTRANCES AND   
EXITS TO THOSE GARAGES BECOME   
VITAL THAT THERE ARE SOME       

00:53:34.982 --> 00:53:35.647
EXITS TO THOSE GARAGES BECOME   
VITAL THAT THERE ARE SOME       
LESSONS THAT QUITE FRANKLY      

00:53:35.649 --> 00:53:36.448
VITAL THAT THERE ARE SOME       
LESSONS THAT QUITE FRANKLY      
WE'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY AT   

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.983
LESSONS THAT QUITE FRANKLY      
WE'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY AT   
BRIDGE PARK THAT WE BRING HERE  

00:53:38.985 --> 00:53:39.885
WE'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY AT   
BRIDGE PARK THAT WE BRING HERE  
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO IT  

00:53:39.887 --> 00:53:45.356
BRIDGE PARK THAT WE BRING HERE  
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO IT  
A LITTLE BIT BETTER EVERY TIME  

00:53:45.358 --> 00:53:45.657
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO IT  
A LITTLE BIT BETTER EVERY TIME  
.                               

00:53:45.659 --> 00:53:46.524
A LITTLE BIT BETTER EVERY TIME  
.                               
THESE ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF THE   

00:53:46.526 --> 00:53:49.761
.                               
THESE ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF THE   
THE OPEN SPACES THAT I'M        

00:53:49.763 --> 00:53:50.262
THESE ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF THE   
THE OPEN SPACES THAT I'M        
TALKING ABOUT.                  

00:53:50.264 --> 00:53:51.029
THE OPEN SPACES THAT I'M        
TALKING ABOUT.                  
AND SO YOU CAN SEE SOME         

00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:53.364
TALKING ABOUT.                  
AND SO YOU CAN SEE SOME         
OF THESE THEY'RE THEY'RE BIG    

00:53:53.366 --> 00:53:53.632
AND SO YOU CAN SEE SOME         
OF THESE THEY'RE THEY'RE BIG    
GRAND.                          

00:53:53.634 --> 00:53:56.701
OF THESE THEY'RE THEY'RE BIG    
GRAND.                          
THE IDEA IS THAT WHETHER YOU    

00:53:56.703 --> 00:53:57.603
GRAND.                          
THE IDEA IS THAT WHETHER YOU    
LIVE THERE OR NOT, YOU STILL    

00:53:57.605 --> 00:54:00.505
THE IDEA IS THAT WHETHER YOU    
LIVE THERE OR NOT, YOU STILL    
FEEL LIKE YOUR HOME THERE.      

00:54:00.507 --> 00:54:01.673
LIVE THERE OR NOT, YOU STILL    
FEEL LIKE YOUR HOME THERE.      
BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER SPACES 

00:54:01.675 --> 00:54:04.609
FEEL LIKE YOUR HOME THERE.      
BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER SPACES 
AND SOME OF THEM ELEVATED WHERE 

00:54:04.611 --> 00:54:05.410
BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER SPACES 
AND SOME OF THEM ELEVATED WHERE 
THESE BECOME AMENITIES FOR THE  

00:54:05.412 --> 00:54:07.779
AND SOME OF THEM ELEVATED WHERE 
THESE BECOME AMENITIES FOR THE  
RESIDENTS THEMSELVES AND THEY   

00:54:07.781 --> 00:54:08.580
THESE BECOME AMENITIES FOR THE  
RESIDENTS THEMSELVES AND THEY   
FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE SOMETHING   

00:54:08.582 --> 00:54:11.650
RESIDENTS THEMSELVES AND THEY   
FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE SOMETHING   
SPECIAL AS WELL.                

00:54:11.652 --> 00:54:15.553
FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE SOMETHING   
SPECIAL AS WELL.                
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF SPACES   

00:54:15.555 --> 00:54:16.588
SPECIAL AS WELL.                
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF SPACES   
THAT WE WILL DEFINE IF THEY GET 

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:20.024
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF SPACES   
THAT WE WILL DEFINE IF THEY GET 
USED THAT DEFINE SUCCESS FOR US 

00:54:20.026 --> 00:54:20.825
THAT WE WILL DEFINE IF THEY GET 
USED THAT DEFINE SUCCESS FOR US 
BECAUSE THAT IT'S THAT SORT     

00:54:20.827 --> 00:54:24.028
USED THAT DEFINE SUCCESS FOR US 
BECAUSE THAT IT'S THAT SORT     
OF DYNAMIC ATMOSPHERE OR THAT   

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.496
BECAUSE THAT IT'S THAT SORT     
OF DYNAMIC ATMOSPHERE OR THAT   
WOULD LOU.                      

00:54:24.498 --> 00:54:27.733
OF DYNAMIC ATMOSPHERE OR THAT   
WOULD LOU.                      
AND DONNA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  

00:54:27.735 --> 00:54:28.667
WOULD LOU.                      
AND DONNA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  
EARLIER THAT WE FOUND A         

00:54:28.669 --> 00:54:32.237
AND DONNA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  
EARLIER THAT WE FOUND A         
MULTITUDE OF PLACES THAT WE     

00:54:32.239 --> 00:54:33.071
EARLIER THAT WE FOUND A         
MULTITUDE OF PLACES THAT WE     
DEVELOPED IS THAT IF YOU CAN    

00:54:33.073 --> 00:54:35.773
MULTITUDE OF PLACES THAT WE     
DEVELOPED IS THAT IF YOU CAN    
CREATE THAT SENSE OF PLACE IT   

00:54:35.775 --> 00:54:36.708
DEVELOPED IS THAT IF YOU CAN    
CREATE THAT SENSE OF PLACE IT   
SORT OF SOLVES A LOT OF OTHER

CREATE THAT SENSE OF PLACE IT   
SORT OF SOLVES A LOT OF OTHER   
ISSUES FOR YOU.

THIS IS THESE ARE A COUPLE      
IMAGES OF BRIDGE PARK.          
SO OUR WE HAVE AN EVENTS TEAM   

00:54:47.687 --> 00:54:48.620

PHASE OF THE PHASE PHASE        
DEVELOPMENT.                    
THAT MEANS THAT WE WILL HAVE    

01:04:12.485 --> 01:04:13.317
DEVELOPMENT.                    
THAT MEANS THAT WE WILL HAVE

LIEU.                           

01:04:28.001 --> 01:04:28.933
WE HAD THEM PROVIDE A FEE IN    
LIEU.                           
THAT THEN COMES AS EACH PHASE   

01:04:28.935 --> 01:04:32.203
LIEU.                           
THAT THEN COMES AS EACH PHASE   
IS COMPLETED AND THEN THE FUNDS

SO THAT TAKES A MUCH LONGER     

01:04:35.641 --> 01:04:36.508
DEVELOP.                        
SO THAT TAKES A MUCH LONGER     
TIME TO ACTUALLY GET THE UNITS  

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:38.709
SO THAT TAKES A MUCH LONGER     
TIME TO ACTUALLY GET THE UNITS  
UP AND RUNNING.                 

01:04:38.711 --> 01:04:40.045
TIME TO ACTUALLY GET THE UNITS  
UP AND RUNNING.                 
IN ADDITION, THERE ARE A LOT    

01:04:40.047 --> 01:04:42.747
UP AND RUNNING.                 
IN ADDITION, THERE ARE A LOT

DEVELOP A SITE THIS LARGE.      

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:46.418
OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE TO        
DEVELOP A SITE THIS LARGE.      
SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING A THOUSAND 

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.352
DEVELOP A SITE THIS LARGE.      
SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING A THOUSAND 
UNITS VERSUS 50 UNITS YOU CAN   

01:04:47.354 --> 01:04:50.688
SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING A THOUSAND 
UNITS VERSUS 50 UNITS YOU CAN   
SPREAD SOME COST ACROSS THOSE   

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:51.656
UNITS VERSUS 50 UNITS YOU CAN   
SPREAD SOME COST ACROSS THOSE   
ALL THOSE UNITS AND IT BRINGS   

01:04:51.658 --> 01:04:54.258
SPREAD SOME COST ACROSS THOSE   
ALL THOSE UNITS AND IT BRINGS   
THE PER UNIT COST DOWN ON THE

ALL THOSE UNITS AND IT BRINGS   
THE PER UNIT COST DOWN ON THE

INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE THINK IS 

01:13:31.043 --> 01:13:31.642
HAVE ALREADY DESIGNED A PARKING 
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE THINK IS 
AN EFFICIENT PARKING PLAN       

01:13:31.644 --> 01:13:35.145
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE THINK IS 
AN EFFICIENT PARKING PLAN       
CURRENTLY THE SITE IF YOU LOOK  

01:13:35.147 --> 01:13:38.215
AN EFFICIENT PARKING PLAN       
CURRENTLY THE SITE IF YOU LOOK  
AT THE EXISTING PARKING DECK    

01:13:38.217 --> 01:13:39.016
CURRENTLY THE SITE IF YOU LOOK  
AT THE EXISTING PARKING DECK    
AND THE EXISTING SURFACE        

01:13:39.018 --> 01:13:42.620
AT THE EXISTING PARKING DECK    
AND THE EXISTING SURFACE        
PARKING SPACES FOR ALMOST       

01:13:42.622 --> 01:13:46.323
AND THE EXISTING SURFACE        
PARKING SPACES FOR ALMOST       
400000 SQUARE FEET              

01:13:46.325 --> 01:13:47.057
PARKING SPACES FOR ALMOST       
400000 SQUARE FEET              
OF COMMERCIAL SPACE, THERE ARE, 

01:13:47.059 --> 01:13:50.494
400000 SQUARE FEET              
OF COMMERCIAL SPACE, THERE ARE, 
YOU KNOW, 1500 SPACES THREE     

01:13:50.496 --> 01:13:51.262
OF COMMERCIAL SPACE, THERE ARE, 
YOU KNOW, 1500 SPACES THREE     
POINT EIGHT ONE ALMOST FOUR     

01:13:51.264 --> 01:13:54.765
YOU KNOW, 1500 SPACES THREE     
POINT EIGHT ONE ALMOST FOUR     
FOUR SPACES FOUR THOUSAND       

01:13:54.767 --> 01:13:57.634

FOUR SPACES FOUR THOUSAND       
SQUARE FEET AFTER COMPLETION    

01:13:57.636 --> 01:13:58.468
FOUR SPACES FOUR THOUSAND       
SQUARE FEET AFTER COMPLETION    
OF ALL OF THE PHASES AS         

01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:59.102
SQUARE FEET AFTER COMPLETION    
OF ALL OF THE PHASES AS         
CURRENTLY DESIGNED WE'RE        

01:13:59.104 --> 01:13:59.703
OF ALL OF THE PHASES AS         
CURRENTLY DESIGNED WE'RE        
LOOKING ABOUT TWENTY SIX        

01:13:59.705 --> 01:14:02.172
CURRENTLY DESIGNED WE'RE        
LOOKING ABOUT TWENTY SIX        
HUNDRED SPACES BUT THOSE TWENTY 

01:14:02.174 --> 01:14:02.906
LOOKING ABOUT TWENTY SIX        
HUNDRED SPACES BUT THOSE TWENTY 
SIX HUNDRED SPACES ARE GOING TO 

01:14:02.908 --> 01:14:05.876
HUNDRED SPACES BUT THOSE TWENTY 
SIX HUNDRED SPACES ARE GOING TO 
SERVE US ALMOST TWO POINT FIVE  

01:14:05.878 --> 01:14:06.544
SIX HUNDRED SPACES ARE GOING TO 
SERVE US ALMOST TWO POINT FIVE  
MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET.      

01:14:06.546 --> 01:14:09.480
SERVE US ALMOST TWO POINT FIVE  
MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET.      
THAT BRINGS THE PARKING RATIO   

01:14:09.482 --> 01:14:10.748
MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET.      
THAT BRINGS THE PARKING RATIO   
DOWN TO YOU KNOW, ABOUT ONE PER 

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.084
THAT BRINGS THE PARKING RATIO   
DOWN TO YOU KNOW, ABOUT ONE PER 
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOTAGE BASIS.  

01:14:13.086 --> 01:14:14.151
DOWN TO YOU KNOW, ABOUT ONE PER 
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOTAGE BASIS.  
AND SO WHILE WE ARE BUILDING    

01:14:14.153 --> 01:14:18.121
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOTAGE BASIS.  
AND SO WHILE WE ARE BUILDING    
ADDITIONAL PARKING WHILE WE ARE 

01:14:18.123 --> 01:14:18.789
AND SO WHILE WE ARE BUILDING    
ADDITIONAL PARKING WHILE WE ARE 
BUILDING PARKING TO SUPPORT     

01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:21.091
ADDITIONAL PARKING WHILE WE ARE 
BUILDING PARKING TO SUPPORT     
THIS DENSER ENVIRONMENT THAT I  

01:14:21.093 --> 01:14:21.926
BUILDING PARKING TO SUPPORT     
THIS DENSER ENVIRONMENT THAT I  
THINK WE ALL WANT IN TO SUPPORT 

01:14:21.928 --> 01:14:24.528
THIS DENSER ENVIRONMENT THAT I  
THINK WE ALL WANT IN TO SUPPORT 
ALL THE ADDITIONAL HOUSING THAT 

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:25.696
THINK WE ALL WANT IN TO SUPPORT 
ALL THE ADDITIONAL HOUSING THAT 
WE WANT, THE DESIGN IS MEANT TO 

01:14:25.698 --> 01:14:26.496
ALL THE ADDITIONAL HOUSING THAT 
WE WANT, THE DESIGN IS MEANT TO 
BE AS PARKING EFFICIENT AS      

01:14:26.498 --> 01:14:28.699
WE WANT, THE DESIGN IS MEANT TO 
BE AS PARKING EFFICIENT AS      
POSSIBLE.                       

01:14:28.701 --> 01:14:29.633
BE AS PARKING EFFICIENT AS      
POSSIBLE.                       
PART OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE   

01:14:29.635 --> 01:14:30.701
POSSIBLE.                       
PART OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE   
ABLE TO DO THIS, BY THE WAY, IS 

01:14:30.703 --> 01:14:33.303
PART OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE   
ABLE TO DO THIS, BY THE WAY, IS 
BECAUSE WE HAVE EXISTING OFFICE 

01:14:33.305 --> 01:14:36.640
ABLE TO DO THIS, BY THE WAY, IS 
BECAUSE WE HAVE EXISTING OFFICE 
USE THAT IS GOING TO SUPPORT A  

01:14:36.642 --> 01:14:37.574
BECAUSE WE HAVE EXISTING OFFICE 
USE THAT IS GOING TO SUPPORT A  
FAIR AMOUNT OF THESE SPACES AND 

01:14:37.576 --> 01:14:39.944
USE THAT IS GOING TO SUPPORT A  
FAIR AMOUNT OF THESE SPACES AND 
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH      

01:14:39.946 --> 01:14:40.745
FAIR AMOUNT OF THESE SPACES AND 
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH      
THESE MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS IS 

01:14:40.747 --> 01:14:41.578
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH      
THESE MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS IS 
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PLAN OUR     

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.316
THESE MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS IS 
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PLAN OUR     
PARKING IN A VERY EFFICIENT AND 

01:14:45.318 --> 01:14:45.650
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PLAN OUR     
PARKING IN A VERY EFFICIENT AND 
SHARED MANNER.                  

01:14:45.652 --> 01:14:48.919
PARKING IN A VERY EFFICIENT AND 
SHARED MANNER.                  
OFFICE USERS AND RESTAURANT     

01:14:48.921 --> 01:14:49.654
SHARED MANNER.                  
OFFICE USERS AND RESTAURANT     
USERS HAVE SOME OVERLAP DURING  

01:14:49.656 --> 01:14:50.120
OFFICE USERS AND RESTAURANT     
USERS HAVE SOME OVERLAP DURING  
TIMES OF DAY.                   

01:14:50.122 --> 01:14:53.023
USERS HAVE SOME OVERLAP DURING  
TIMES OF DAY.                   
WE'RE BOTH NEED PARKING BUT     

01:14:53.025 --> 01:14:53.624
TIMES OF DAY.                   
WE'RE BOTH NEED PARKING BUT     
TYPICALLY OFFICE USERS ARE      

01:14:53.626 --> 01:14:56.961
WE'RE BOTH NEED PARKING BUT     
TYPICALLY OFFICE USERS ARE      
DAYTIME USERS, RESTAURANT USERS 

01:14:56.963 --> 01:14:57.695
TYPICALLY OFFICE USERS ARE      
DAYTIME USERS, RESTAURANT USERS 
AND RESIDENTIAL USERS AND       

01:14:57.697 --> 01:15:00.297
DAYTIME USERS, RESTAURANT USERS 
AND RESIDENTIAL USERS AND       
NIGHTTIME USERS AS OUR HOTEL    

01:15:00.299 --> 01:15:00.631
AND RESIDENTIAL USERS AND       
NIGHTTIME USERS AS OUR HOTEL    
USERS.                          

01:15:00.633 --> 01:15:03.534
NIGHTTIME USERS AS OUR HOTEL    
USERS.                          
AND SO WE THINK THAT WE'RE      

01:15:03.536 --> 01:15:04.468
USERS.                          
AND SO WE THINK THAT WE'RE      
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHARE       

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:05.202
AND SO WE THINK THAT WE'RE      
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHARE       
SPACES IN A WAY THAT'S AN       

01:15:05.204 --> 01:15:06.003
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHARE       
SPACES IN A WAY THAT'S AN       
EFFICIENT USE OF THE SPACE AND  

01:15:06.005 --> 01:15:08.072
SPACES IN A WAY THAT'S AN       
EFFICIENT USE OF THE SPACE AND  
EFFICIENT USE OF THE PARKING    

01:15:08.074 --> 01:15:09.072
EFFICIENT USE OF THE SPACE AND  
EFFICIENT USE OF THE PARKING    
GARAGES, REDUCE THE COST TO THE 

01:15:09.074 --> 01:15:11.742
EFFICIENT USE OF THE PARKING    
GARAGES, REDUCE THE COST TO THE 
CITY, REDUCE THE FOOTPRINTS     

01:15:11.744 --> 01:15:12.476
GARAGES, REDUCE THE COST TO THE 
CITY, REDUCE THE FOOTPRINTS     
OF THESE PARKING GARAGES,       

01:15:12.478 --> 01:15:15.445
CITY, REDUCE THE FOOTPRINTS     
OF THESE PARKING GARAGES,       
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF VIBRANCY 

01:15:15.447 --> 01:15:16.514
OF THESE PARKING GARAGES,       
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF VIBRANCY 
WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE WITH THE   

01:15:16.516 --> 01:15:17.048
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF VIBRANCY 
WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE WITH THE   
REST OF DEVELOPMENT.            

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:19.917
WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE WITH THE   
REST OF DEVELOPMENT.            
>> THE OTHER THING WORTH NOTING 

01:15:19.919 --> 01:15:22.819
REST OF DEVELOPMENT.            
>> THE OTHER THING WORTH NOTING 
IS SOME OF THESE TRANSPORTATION

STATS WHAT THE COMMERCIAL       
SQUARE FOOTAGE IS DOWNTOWN AND  

01:15:36.068 --> 01:15:38.635
STATS WHAT THE COMMERCIAL       
SQUARE FOOTAGE IS DOWNTOWN AND  
THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE   

01:15:38.637 --> 01:15:39.669
SQUARE FOOTAGE IS DOWNTOWN AND  
THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE   
WHO DRIVE ALONE TO WORK TO THE  

01:15:39.671 --> 01:15:43.073
THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE   
WHO DRIVE ALONE TO WORK TO THE  
SOUTH SIDE AND THE RELATIVE

NOW DWARFS THE POPULATION IN    
PARTICULARLY IF YOU COMPARE IT  

01:15:51.651 --> 01:15:52.449
NOW DWARFS THE POPULATION IN    
PARTICULARLY IF YOU COMPARE IT  
TO THE POPULATION OF DOWNTOWN

COMPARED THE COMMERCIAL SQUARE  
FOOTAGE DOWNTOWN.               
WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT      

01:15:59.158 --> 01:16:00.023
FOOTAGE DOWNTOWN.               
WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT      
THERE'S ROOM FOR A DENSER NODE  

01:16:00.025 --> 01:16:03.460
WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT      
THERE'S ROOM FOR A DENSER NODE  
ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CITY   

01:16:03.462 --> 01:16:07.464
THERE'S ROOM FOR A DENSER NODE  
ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CITY   
ALLOWING HOUSING TO BE CLOSER   

01:16:07.466 --> 01:16:08.198
ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CITY   
ALLOWING HOUSING TO BE CLOSER   
TO THE JOBS THAT ARE ALREADY ON

THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CITY AND  

01:16:10.135 --> 01:16:10.868
TO THE JOBS THAT ARE ALREADY ON 
THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CITY AND  
HOPEFULLY ALLOWING FEWER PEOPLE

THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CITY AND  
HOPEFULLY ALLOWING FEWER PEOPLE 
TO DRIVE ALONE TO WORK,         

01:16:14.106 --> 01:16:17.974
HOPEFULLY ALLOWING FEWER PEOPLE 
TO DRIVE ALONE TO WORK,         
ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO ACCESS  

01:16:17.976 --> 01:16:18.775
TO DRIVE ALONE TO WORK,         
ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO ACCESS  
WORK EITHER THROUGH EITHER

REGARDLESS PROVIDING HOUSING.   

01:16:41.433 --> 01:16:42.166
OR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND IN 
REGARDLESS PROVIDING HOUSING.   
THAT WOULD BE A SHORTER DRIVE   

01:16:42.168 --> 01:16:42.866
REGARDLESS PROVIDING HOUSING.   
THAT WOULD BE A SHORTER DRIVE   
TO WORK NONETHELESS AND SO ALL  

01:16:42.868 --> 01:16:43.600
THAT WOULD BE A SHORTER DRIVE   
TO WORK NONETHELESS AND SO ALL  
OF THIS IS A IS REALLY A        

01:16:43.602 --> 01:16:44.335
TO WORK NONETHELESS AND SO ALL  
OF THIS IS A IS REALLY A        
HANDOFF OVER TO MARTY TO SAY,   

01:16:44.337 --> 01:16:45.302
OF THIS IS A IS REALLY A        
HANDOFF OVER TO MARTY TO SAY,   
YOU KNOW, WE'VE PUT A LOT

WE'RE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT     
USING THE DOLLARS WISELY BOTH

WE'RE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT     
PUTTING IN DEVELOPMENT THAT     

01:16:50.676 --> 01:16:53.644
WE'RE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT     
PUTTING IN DEVELOPMENT THAT     
WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

THINGS THAT LOU AND DONNA WERE  
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER.          

01:16:57.115 --> 01:16:58.048
THINGS THAT LOU AND DONNA WERE  
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER.          
THAT SENSE OF PLACEMAKING IS    

01:16:58.050 --> 01:17:01.151
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER.          
THAT SENSE OF PLACEMAKING IS    
IMPORTANT.                      

01:17:01.153 --> 01:17:01.985
THAT SENSE OF PLACEMAKING IS    
IMPORTANT.                      
IT'S NOT JUST IMPORTANT TO      

01:17:01.987 --> 01:17:02.620
IMPORTANT.                      
IT'S NOT JUST IMPORTANT TO      
YOUNG PROFESSIONALS.            

01:17:02.622 --> 01:17:05.488
IT'S NOT JUST IMPORTANT TO      
YOUNG PROFESSIONALS.            
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOST PEOPLE   

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:08.292
YOUNG PROFESSIONALS.            
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOST PEOPLE   
THAT WANT TO LIVE IN WALKABLE   

01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:08.959
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOST PEOPLE   
THAT WANT TO LIVE IN WALKABLE   
URBAN ENVIRONMENTS AND YOU      

01:17:08.961 --> 01:17:13.397
THAT WANT TO LIVE IN WALKABLE   
URBAN ENVIRONMENTS AND YOU      
KNOW, OUR EXPERIENCE IN OUR

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS BRIDGE PARK  
BEING A PRIME EXAMPLE OF IT WAS 

01:17:17.069 --> 01:17:17.735
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS BRIDGE PARK  
BEING A PRIME EXAMPLE OF IT WAS 
ACTUALLY THAT OUR EARLIEST

NUMBER OF UNITS BY YOUR ABILITY 
TO TURN ONE DOLLAR INTO         
MULTIPLE DOLLARS IS IS          

01:29:58.363 --> 01:30:00.964
TO TURN ONE DOLLAR INTO         
MULTIPLE DOLLARS IS IS          
IMPORTANT.                      

01:30:00.966 --> 01:30:02.098
MULTIPLE DOLLARS IS IS          
IMPORTANT.                      
I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS    

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:02.765
IMPORTANT.                      
I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS    
THAT I HAVE AROUND THIS         

01:30:02.767 --> 01:30:04.567
I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS    
THAT I HAVE AROUND THIS         
SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT IS THAT    

01:30:04.569 --> 01:30:05.334
THAT I HAVE AROUND THIS         
SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT IS THAT    
WITH THE BROWNFIELD TIF THERE   

01:30:05.336 --> 01:30:08.538
SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT IS THAT    
WITH THE BROWNFIELD TIF THERE   
ARE SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING     

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:09.205
WITH THE BROWNFIELD TIF THERE   
ARE SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING     
REQUIREMENTS INVOLVED AND I     

01:30:09.207 --> 01:30:12.074
ARE SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING     
REQUIREMENTS INVOLVED AND I     
THINK IT'S UP TO 15 PERCENT     

01:30:12.076 --> 01:30:13.009
REQUIREMENTS INVOLVED AND I     
THINK IT'S UP TO 15 PERCENT     
OF THE UNITS WOULD NEED TO BE   

01:30:13.011 --> 01:30:13.409
THINK IT'S UP TO 15 PERCENT     
OF THE UNITS WOULD NEED TO BE   
AFFORDABLE.                     

01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:16.779
OF THE UNITS WOULD NEED TO BE   
AFFORDABLE.                     
SO I GUESS I WONDER SPECIFIC TO 

01:30:16.781 --> 01:30:20.584
AFFORDABLE.                     
SO I GUESS I WONDER SPECIFIC TO 
THIS SITE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE  

01:30:20.586 --> 01:30:21.317
SO I GUESS I WONDER SPECIFIC TO 
THIS SITE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE  
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF HAVING   

01:30:21.319 --> 01:30:23.419
THIS SITE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE  
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF HAVING   
THE HOUSING COMMISSION KIND     

01:30:23.421 --> 01:30:24.120
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF HAVING   
THE HOUSING COMMISSION KIND     
OF TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS?      

01:30:24.122 --> 01:30:25.054
THE HOUSING COMMISSION KIND     
OF TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS?      
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE GETTING A 

01:30:25.056 --> 01:30:28.491
OF TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS?      
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE GETTING A 
FEW MORE UNITS IN THAT 15       

01:30:28.493 --> 01:30:28.892
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE GETTING A 
FEW MORE UNITS IN THAT 15       
PERCENT.                        

01:30:28.894 --> 01:30:29.492
FEW MORE UNITS IN THAT 15       
PERCENT.                        
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME        

01:30:29.494 --> 01:30:29.959
PERCENT.                        
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME        
SERVICES INVOLVED.              

01:30:29.961 --> 01:30:32.562
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME        
SERVICES INVOLVED.              
ARE THERE OTHER BENEFITS WE     

01:30:32.564 --> 01:30:33.296
SERVICES INVOLVED.              
ARE THERE OTHER BENEFITS WE     
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT AS     

01:30:33.298 --> 01:30:35.365
ARE THERE OTHER BENEFITS WE     
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT AS     
OPPOSED TO KIND OF FALLING BACK 

01:30:35.367 --> 01:30:36.265
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT AS     
OPPOSED TO KIND OF FALLING BACK 
ON THE 15 PERCENT REQUIREMENT   

01:30:36.267 --> 01:30:42.838
OPPOSED TO KIND OF FALLING BACK 
ON THE 15 PERCENT REQUIREMENT   
IN THE BROWNFIELD AND THEN KIND 

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.873
ON THE 15 PERCENT REQUIREMENT   
IN THE BROWNFIELD AND THEN KIND 
OF CONNECTED TO THAT I ASSUME   

01:30:43.875 --> 01:30:47.043
IN THE BROWNFIELD AND THEN KIND 
OF CONNECTED TO THAT I ASSUME   
BASED ON WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU  

01:30:47.045 --> 01:30:50.813
OF CONNECTED TO THAT I ASSUME   
BASED ON WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU  
THAT THAT PHASE ONE THAT WE SAW 

01:30:50.815 --> 01:30:51.514
BASED ON WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU  
THAT THAT PHASE ONE THAT WE SAW 
ON THE MAP IS THE AFFORDABLE    

01:30:51.516 --> 01:30:54.117
THAT THAT PHASE ONE THAT WE SAW 
ON THE MAP IS THE AFFORDABLE    
HOUSING COMPONENT.              

01:30:54.119 --> 01:30:58.654
ON THE MAP IS THE AFFORDABLE    
HOUSING COMPONENT.              
I GUESS I WONDER KNOWING THAT   

01:30:58.656 --> 01:30:59.289
HOUSING COMPONENT.              
I GUESS I WONDER KNOWING THAT   
THE PHASE FIVE WAS THE PIECE    

01:30:59.291 --> 01:31:01.957
I GUESS I WONDER KNOWING THAT   
THE PHASE FIVE WAS THE PIECE    
THAT WAS NEXT TO IT PHASE TWO   

01:31:01.959 --> 01:31:05.327
THE PHASE FIVE WAS THE PIECE    
THAT WAS NEXT TO IT PHASE TWO   
IS NEXT FOR HOW LONG WILL THE   

01:31:05.329 --> 01:31:05.862
THAT WAS NEXT TO IT PHASE TWO   
IS NEXT FOR HOW LONG WILL THE   
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BE           

01:31:05.864 --> 01:31:06.529
IS NEXT FOR HOW LONG WILL THE   
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BE           
DISCONNECTED FROM THE REST      

01:31:06.531 --> 01:31:10.332
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BE           
DISCONNECTED FROM THE REST      
OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD?           

01:31:10.334 --> 01:31:11.134
DISCONNECTED FROM THE REST      
OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD?           
AND AND THEN I GUESS ALSO       

01:31:11.136 --> 01:31:13.269
OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD?           
AND AND THEN I GUESS ALSO       
THINKING ABOUT WHERE THAT KIND  

01:31:13.271 --> 01:31:14.137
AND AND THEN I GUESS ALSO       
THINKING ABOUT WHERE THAT KIND  
OF CENTRAL CORRIDOR IS AND THE  

01:31:14.139 --> 01:31:14.804
THINKING ABOUT WHERE THAT KIND  
OF CENTRAL CORRIDOR IS AND THE  
THINGS THAT WE'RE THINKING      

01:31:14.806 --> 01:31:18.040
OF CENTRAL CORRIDOR IS AND THE  
THINGS THAT WE'RE THINKING      
ABOUT WHAT IS THE LEVEL         

01:31:18.042 --> 01:31:18.708
THINGS THAT WE'RE THINKING      
ABOUT WHAT IS THE LEVEL         
OF ACCESS THAT THE AFFORDABLE   

01:31:18.710 --> 01:31:21.378
ABOUT WHAT IS THE LEVEL         
OF ACCESS THAT THE AFFORDABLE   
HOUSING UNITS WILL HAVE TO THE  

01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.044
OF ACCESS THAT THE AFFORDABLE   
HOUSING UNITS WILL HAVE TO THE  
REST OF THAT SPACE.             

01:31:22.046 --> 01:31:25.114
HOUSING UNITS WILL HAVE TO THE  
REST OF THAT SPACE.             
AND I ASKED THIS QUESTION       

01:31:25.116 --> 01:31:25.749
REST OF THAT SPACE.             
AND I ASKED THIS QUESTION       
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY  

01:31:25.751 --> 01:31:26.482
AND I ASKED THIS QUESTION       
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY  
ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF NOT      

01:31:26.484 --> 01:31:28.684
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY  
ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF NOT      
HAVING A SINGLE AFFORDABLE      

01:31:28.686 --> 01:31:29.352
ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF NOT      
HAVING A SINGLE AFFORDABLE      
HOUSING HOUSING COMMISSION OWN  

01:31:29.354 --> 01:31:34.024
HAVING A SINGLE AFFORDABLE      
HOUSING HOUSING COMMISSION OWN  
SPACE MEANS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE 

01:31:34.026 --> 01:31:34.758
HOUSING HOUSING COMMISSION OWN  
SPACE MEANS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE 
KIND OF MORE MIXED INCOME       

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:36.826
SPACE MEANS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE 
KIND OF MORE MIXED INCOME       
HOUSING THROUGHOUT AND THERE    

01:31:36.828 --> 01:31:37.593
KIND OF MORE MIXED INCOME       
HOUSING THROUGHOUT AND THERE    
ARE OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS TO THAT  

01:31:37.595 --> 01:31:37.861
HOUSING THROUGHOUT AND THERE    
ARE OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS TO THAT  
AS WELL.                        

01:31:37.863 --> 01:31:40.663
ARE OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS TO THAT  
AS WELL.                        
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF MY        

01:31:40.665 --> 01:31:41.397
AS WELL.                        
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF MY        
INITIAL BIG QUESTION IN THE     

01:31:41.399 --> 01:31:44.533
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF MY        
INITIAL BIG QUESTION IN THE     
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SECTION.     

01:31:44.535 --> 01:31:48.504
INITIAL BIG QUESTION IN THE     
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SECTION.     
>> I THINK THE SINGLE BIGGEST   

01:31:48.506 --> 01:31:52.274
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SECTION.     
>> I THINK THE SINGLE BIGGEST   
BENEFIT IS THE WILLINGNESS FOR  

01:31:52.276 --> 01:31:53.043
>> I THINK THE SINGLE BIGGEST   
BENEFIT IS THE WILLINGNESS FOR  
THE DEVELOPER TO INCLUDE TWO    

01:31:53.045 --> 01:31:56.212
BENEFIT IS THE WILLINGNESS FOR  
THE DEVELOPER TO INCLUDE TWO    
HUNDRED THAT'S OUR GOAL         

01:31:56.214 --> 01:31:57.013
THE DEVELOPER TO INCLUDE TWO    
HUNDRED THAT'S OUR GOAL         
OF AFFORDABLE UNITS RATHER THAN 

01:31:57.015 --> 01:31:57.747
HUNDRED THAT'S OUR GOAL         
OF AFFORDABLE UNITS RATHER THAN 
THE MINIMUM REQUIRED OF ONE     

01:31:57.749 --> 01:32:01.050
OF AFFORDABLE UNITS RATHER THAN 
THE MINIMUM REQUIRED OF ONE     
HUNDRED FIFTY FIFTY IS A        

01:32:01.052 --> 01:32:05.088
THE MINIMUM REQUIRED OF ONE     
HUNDRED FIFTY FIFTY IS A        
STANDARD SORT OF LIKE TECH TAX  

01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:08.124
HUNDRED FIFTY FIFTY IS A        
STANDARD SORT OF LIKE TECH TAX  
CREDIT DEAL IS LIKE FIFTY SIXTY 

01:32:08.126 --> 01:32:09.192
STANDARD SORT OF LIKE TECH TAX  
CREDIT DEAL IS LIKE FIFTY SIXTY 
UNITS SO THAT'S LIKE AN ENTIRE  

01:32:09.194 --> 01:32:12.262
CREDIT DEAL IS LIKE FIFTY SIXTY 
UNITS SO THAT'S LIKE AN ENTIRE  
PROJECT FOR US THAT WE WOULDN'T 

01:32:12.264 --> 01:32:13.062
UNITS SO THAT'S LIKE AN ENTIRE  
PROJECT FOR US THAT WE WOULDN'T 
HAVE TO DO IT REALLY IT'S LIKE  

01:32:13.064 --> 01:32:13.662
PROJECT FOR US THAT WE WOULDN'T 
HAVE TO DO IT REALLY IT'S LIKE  
FOUR OF THEM BECAUSE WE'RE      

01:32:13.664 --> 01:32:16.298
HAVE TO DO IT REALLY IT'S LIKE  
FOUR OF THEM BECAUSE WE'RE      
TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED UNITS 

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:16.499
FOUR OF THEM BECAUSE WE'RE      
TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED UNITS 
.                               

01:32:16.501 --> 01:32:17.366
TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED UNITS 
.                               
IT'S MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN 

01:32:17.368 --> 01:32:21.003
.                               
IT'S MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN 
WHAT WE DO ON OUR OWN.          

01:32:21.005 --> 01:32:24.240
IT'S MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN 
WHAT WE DO ON OUR OWN.          
THE COST IS GOING TO BE MUCH    

01:32:24.242 --> 01:32:24.907
WHAT WE DO ON OUR OWN.          
THE COST IS GOING TO BE MUCH    
LESS BECAUSE OF BEING PART      

01:32:24.909 --> 01:32:27.743
THE COST IS GOING TO BE MUCH    
LESS BECAUSE OF BEING PART      
OF THIS LARGER PROJECT AND I    

01:32:27.745 --> 01:32:31.948
LESS BECAUSE OF BEING PART

WORKED HISTORICALLY I DO SEE    
MUCH BIGGER BENEFIT WHEN A      
MISSION OWNED NONPROFIT OWNS    

01:32:44.596 --> 01:32:48.631
MUCH BIGGER BENEFIT WHEN A

COUPLE OF INNER LIFE IN         

01:33:37.582 --> 01:33:38.514
THAT'S A GOOD ONE AND THERE'S A 
COUPLE OF INNER LIFE IN         
OVERLAPPING REASONS AS I MIX MY 

01:33:38.516 --> 01:33:41.984
COUPLE OF INNER LIFE IN         
OVERLAPPING REASONS AS I MIX MY 
METAPHORS HERE FOR THE          

01:33:41.986 --> 01:33:42.318
OVERLAPPING REASONS AS I MIX MY 
METAPHORS HERE FOR THE          
LOCATION.                       

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:45.154
METAPHORS HERE FOR THE          
LOCATION.                       
A PRIMARY REASON IS THAT THE    

01:33:45.156 --> 01:33:48.558
LOCATION.                       
A PRIMARY REASON IS THAT THE    
PARTICULAR LOCATION THAT IS     

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:49.358
A PRIMARY REASON IS THAT THE    
PARTICULAR LOCATION THAT IS     
TARGETED FOR THIS PORTION       

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.226
PARTICULAR LOCATION THAT IS     
TARGETED FOR THIS PORTION       
OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS ITS PAD   

01:33:50.228 --> 01:33:52.661
TARGETED FOR THIS PORTION       
OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS ITS PAD   
READY.                          

01:33:52.663 --> 01:33:53.496
OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS ITS PAD   
READY.                          
>> THERE'S MINIMAL DEMO THAT    

01:33:53.498 --> 01:33:55.965
READY.                          
>> THERE'S MINIMAL DEMO THAT    
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.                

01:33:55.967 --> 01:33:57.066
>> THERE'S MINIMAL DEMO THAT    
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.                
>> IT IS ON ITS FRONTAGE THAT   

01:33:57.068 --> 01:34:00.536
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.                
>> IT IS ON ITS FRONTAGE THAT   
WILL LARGELY REUSE SOME OF THE  

01:34:00.538 --> 01:34:03.806
>> IT IS ON ITS FRONTAGE THAT   
WILL LARGELY REUSE SOME OF THE  
STREETSCAPE THAT'S EXISTING ON  

01:34:03.808 --> 01:34:04.206
WILL LARGELY REUSE SOME OF THE  
STREETSCAPE THAT'S EXISTING ON  
THE SITE.                       

01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:07.911
STREETSCAPE THAT'S EXISTING ON  
THE SITE.                       
IT ALSO HAS ACCESS TO THE       

01:34:07.913 --> 01:34:08.644
THE SITE.                       
IT ALSO HAS ACCESS TO THE       
EASTERN PORTION OF THE SITE     

01:34:08.646 --> 01:34:09.045
IT ALSO HAS ACCESS TO THE       
EASTERN PORTION OF THE SITE     
ALREADY.                        

01:34:09.047 --> 01:34:12.315
EASTERN PORTION OF THE SITE     
ALREADY.                        
SO IT IS NOT IMPACTED BY SOME   

01:34:12.317 --> 01:34:12.849
ALREADY.                        
SO IT IS NOT IMPACTED BY SOME   
OF THE OTHER FAZING.            

01:34:12.851 --> 01:34:16.051
SO IT IS NOT IMPACTED BY SOME   
OF THE OTHER FAZING.            
THAT IS A REASON FOR TO BE      

01:34:16.053 --> 01:34:16.819
OF THE OTHER FAZING.            
THAT IS A REASON FOR TO BE      
THERE AS IT RELATES TO THE      

01:34:16.821 --> 01:34:17.553
THAT IS A REASON FOR TO BE      
THERE AS IT RELATES TO THE      
CONNECTIVITY OF THE REST OF THE 

01:34:17.555 --> 01:34:19.889
THERE AS IT RELATES TO THE      
CONNECTIVITY OF THE REST OF THE 
DEVELOPMENT.                    

01:34:19.891 --> 01:34:20.890
CONNECTIVITY OF THE REST OF THE 
DEVELOPMENT.                    
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE   

01:34:20.892 --> 01:34:21.790
DEVELOPMENT.                    
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE   
ON IN THE ISLAND AT ANY POINT   

01:34:21.792 --> 01:34:27.597
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE   
ON IN THE ISLAND AT ANY POINT   
IN TIME DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM IT 

01:34:27.599 --> 01:34:28.464
ON IN THE ISLAND AT ANY POINT   
IN TIME DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM IT 
FROM A NORTH SOUTH STANDPOINT   

01:34:28.466 --> 01:34:29.065
IN TIME DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM IT 
FROM A NORTH SOUTH STANDPOINT   
DIRECTLY TO THE SOUTH IS        

01:34:29.067 --> 01:34:31.734
FROM A NORTH SOUTH STANDPOINT   
DIRECTLY TO THE SOUTH IS        
ACTUALLY THE EXISTING PARKING   

01:34:31.736 --> 01:34:35.871
DIRECTLY TO THE SOUTH IS        
ACTUALLY THE EXISTING PARKING   
DECK AND THE ADJACENT SLIVER    

01:34:35.873 --> 01:34:36.805
ACTUALLY THE EXISTING PARKING   
DECK AND THE ADJACENT SLIVER    
OF A LOT THAT'S NEXT TO THAT    

01:34:36.807 --> 01:34:37.173
DECK AND THE ADJACENT SLIVER    
OF A LOT THAT'S NEXT TO THAT    
PARKING DECK.                   

01:34:37.175 --> 01:34:39.709
OF A LOT THAT'S NEXT TO THAT    
PARKING DECK.                   
SO A PORTION OF THE REASON THE  

01:34:39.711 --> 01:34:43.612
PARKING DECK.                   
SO A PORTION OF THE REASON THE  
THE THAT PARTICULAR BUILDING IS 

01:34:43.614 --> 01:34:44.780
SO A PORTION OF THE REASON THE  
THE THAT PARTICULAR BUILDING IS 
IS GOING TO THAT PORTION OF THE 

01:34:44.782 --> 01:34:45.481
THE THAT PARTICULAR BUILDING IS 
IS GOING TO THAT PORTION OF THE 
SITE IS BECAUSE THERE'S PARKING 

01:34:45.483 --> 01:34:47.316
IS GOING TO THAT PORTION OF THE 
SITE IS BECAUSE THERE'S PARKING 
INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTING THAT    

01:34:47.318 --> 01:34:48.084
SITE IS BECAUSE THERE'S PARKING 
INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTING THAT    
CAN SUPPORT IT WHILE WE BUILD   

01:34:48.086 --> 01:34:50.920
INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTING THAT    
CAN SUPPORT IT WHILE WE BUILD   
THE REST OF THE SITE.           

01:34:50.922 --> 01:34:55.391
CAN SUPPORT IT WHILE WE BUILD   
THE REST OF THE SITE.           
IT'S A UNIQUENESS OF THIS SITE  

01:34:55.393 --> 01:34:56.058
THE REST OF THE SITE.           
IT'S A UNIQUENESS OF THIS SITE  
OVERALL THAT IN ORDER TO        

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:56.726
IT'S A UNIQUENESS OF THIS SITE  
OVERALL THAT IN ORDER TO        
SUPPORT THE OFFICE USES THAT    

01:34:56.728 --> 01:34:59.462
OVERALL THAT IN ORDER TO        
SUPPORT THE OFFICE USES THAT    
ARE ALREADY THERE WE NEED TO    

01:34:59.464 --> 01:35:02.999
SUPPORT THE OFFICE USES THAT    
ARE ALREADY THERE WE NEED TO    
PHASE THE PROJECT SO THAT       

01:35:03.001 --> 01:35:03.799
ARE ALREADY THERE WE NEED TO    
PHASE THE PROJECT SO THAT       
EXISTING PARKING DECK STAYS IN  

01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:04.633
PHASE THE PROJECT SO THAT       
EXISTING PARKING DECK STAYS IN  
PLACE WHILE WE DO THE EARLY     

01:35:04.635 --> 01:35:07.436
EXISTING PARKING DECK STAYS IN  
PLACE WHILE WE DO THE EARLY     
PHASES SO THAT PARKING          

01:35:07.438 --> 01:35:08.104
PLACE WHILE WE DO THE EARLY     
PHASES SO THAT PARKING          
STRUCTURE WILL SERVICE THE      

01:35:08.106 --> 01:35:10.973
PHASES SO THAT PARKING          
STRUCTURE WILL SERVICE THE      
AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT    

01:35:10.975 --> 01:35:11.841
STRUCTURE WILL SERVICE THE      
AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT    
AND IT'LL SERVICE OUR INITIAL   

01:35:11.843 --> 01:35:15.244
AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT    
AND IT'LL SERVICE OUR INITIAL   
PHASES WHILE WE'RE BUILDING THE 

01:35:15.246 --> 01:35:15.945
AND IT'LL SERVICE OUR INITIAL   
PHASES WHILE WE'RE BUILDING THE 
PARKING GARAGES THERE AND IT'LL 

01:35:15.947 --> 01:35:19.015
PHASES WHILE WE'RE BUILDING THE 
PARKING GARAGES THERE AND IT'LL 
SERVICE THE OFFICE PHASES AND   

01:35:19.017 --> 01:35:20.015
PARKING GARAGES THERE AND IT'LL 
SERVICE THE OFFICE PHASES AND   
THEN IT WON'T BE UNTIL WE HAVE  

01:35:20.017 --> 01:35:22.618
SERVICE THE OFFICE PHASES AND   
THEN IT WON'T BE UNTIL WE HAVE  
ENOUGH PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE   

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:23.652
THEN IT WON'T BE UNTIL WE HAVE  
ENOUGH PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE   
BUILD OUT OTHER PORTIONS OF THE 

01:35:23.654 --> 01:35:26.989
ENOUGH PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE   
BUILD OUT OTHER PORTIONS OF THE 
SITE THAT WILL DEMO THAT        

01:35:26.991 --> 01:35:27.991
BUILD OUT OTHER PORTIONS OF THE 
SITE THAT WILL DEMO THAT        
PARKING DECK IN FAVOR OF MORE   

01:35:27.993 --> 01:35:31.327
SITE THAT WILL DEMO THAT        
PARKING DECK IN FAVOR OF MORE   
DENSE MOSTLY HOUSING AND        

01:35:31.329 --> 01:35:35.231
PARKING DECK IN FAVOR OF MORE   
DENSE MOSTLY HOUSING AND        
ENTERTAINMENT USES AND A TALLER 

01:35:35.233 --> 01:35:37.834
DENSE MOSTLY HOUSING AND        
ENTERTAINMENT USES AND A TALLER 
AND MORE EFFICIENT PARKING DECK 

01:35:37.836 --> 01:35:38.167
ENTERTAINMENT USES AND A TALLER 
AND MORE EFFICIENT PARKING DECK 
.                               

01:35:38.169 --> 01:35:39.302
AND MORE EFFICIENT PARKING DECK 
.                               
SO AT NO POINT IN TIME WITH THE 

01:35:39.304 --> 01:35:42.404
.                               
SO AT NO POINT IN TIME WITH THE 
SMALL EXCEPTION OF WHEN WE'RE   

01:35:42.406 --> 01:35:43.172
SO AT NO POINT IN TIME WITH THE 
SMALL EXCEPTION OF WHEN WE'RE   
GOING THROUGH THE DEMO AND      

01:35:43.174 --> 01:35:43.840
SMALL EXCEPTION OF WHEN WE'RE   
GOING THROUGH THE DEMO AND      
CONSTRUCTION OF THE STUFF THERE 

01:35:43.842 --> 01:35:46.476
GOING THROUGH THE DEMO AND      
CONSTRUCTION OF THE STUFF THERE 
IN FRONT OF THE AFFORDABLE      

01:35:46.478 --> 01:35:47.343
CONSTRUCTION OF THE STUFF THERE 
IN FRONT OF THE AFFORDABLE      
HOUSING BUILDING ITSELF AT NO   

01:35:47.345 --> 01:35:48.144
IN FRONT OF THE AFFORDABLE      
HOUSING BUILDING ITSELF AT NO   
POINT IN TIME WILL ACTUALLY BE  

01:35:48.146 --> 01:35:50.546
HOUSING BUILDING ITSELF AT NO   
POINT IN TIME WILL ACTUALLY BE  
DISCONNECTED FROM WHAT'S THERE. 

01:35:50.548 --> 01:35:51.547
POINT IN TIME WILL ACTUALLY BE  
DISCONNECTED FROM WHAT'S THERE. 
IT WILL BE CONNECTED DAY ONE TO 

01:35:51.549 --> 01:35:54.783
DISCONNECTED FROM WHAT'S THERE. 
IT WILL BE CONNECTED DAY ONE TO 
THAT PARKING DECK AND THEN WHEN 

01:35:54.785 --> 01:35:57.186
IT WILL BE CONNECTED DAY ONE TO 
THAT PARKING DECK AND THEN WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT THE PROJECT FOR     

01:35:57.188 --> 01:35:58.120
THAT PARKING DECK AND THEN WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT THE PROJECT FOR     
COMPLETION, IT'S JUST GOING TO  

01:35:58.122 --> 01:35:58.788
YOU LOOK AT THE PROJECT FOR     
COMPLETION, IT'S JUST GOING TO  
BE A CONTINUATION OF THE        

01:35:58.790 --> 01:36:01.123
COMPLETION, IT'S JUST GOING TO  
BE A CONTINUATION OF THE        
DEVELOPMENT IN LARGE.           

01:36:01.125 --> 01:36:02.124
BE A CONTINUATION OF THE        
DEVELOPMENT IN LARGE.           
SO BUT THERE'S SOME UNIQUENESS  

01:36:02.126 --> 01:36:05.294
DEVELOPMENT IN LARGE.           
SO BUT THERE'S SOME UNIQUENESS  
TO THE EXISTING PARKING         

01:36:05.296 --> 01:36:06.095
SO BUT THERE'S SOME UNIQUENESS  
TO THE EXISTING PARKING         
SITUATION THAT'S DICTATING SORT 

01:36:06.097 --> 01:36:09.365
TO THE EXISTING PARKING         
SITUATION THAT'S DICTATING SORT 
OF THAT SEQUENCING SO THE NEXT  

01:36:09.367 --> 01:36:13.703
SITUATION THAT'S DICTATING SORT 
OF THAT SEQUENCING SO THE NEXT  
PIECE THAT I WILL JUMP INTO AND 

01:36:13.705 --> 01:36:14.603
OF THAT SEQUENCING SO THE NEXT  
PIECE THAT I WILL JUMP INTO AND 
THEN I'M GOING TO PASS IT ALONG 

01:36:14.605 --> 01:36:20.076
PIECE THAT I WILL JUMP INTO AND 
THEN I'M GOING TO PASS IT ALONG 
TO OTHERS IS SPEAKING A SEGWAY  

01:36:20.078 --> 01:36:24.179
THEN I'M GOING TO PASS IT ALONG 
TO OTHERS IS SPEAKING A SEGWAY  
INTO PARKING AND SO I GUESS ONE 

01:36:24.181 --> 01:36:25.048
TO OTHERS IS SPEAKING A SEGWAY  
INTO PARKING AND SO I GUESS ONE 
I GUESS I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT   

01:36:25.050 --> 01:36:25.915
INTO PARKING AND SO I GUESS ONE 
I GUESS I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT   
WHERE HOW YOU LANDED ON KIND

I GUESS I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT   
WHERE HOW YOU LANDED ON KIND    
OF THE NEEDS OF PARKING YOU     

01:36:29.387 --> 01:36:30.186
WHERE HOW YOU LANDED ON KIND    
OF THE NEEDS OF PARKING YOU     
KNOW, IS THREE DECKS NECESSARY  

01:36:30.188 --> 01:36:32.855
OF THE NEEDS OF PARKING YOU     
KNOW, IS THREE DECKS NECESSARY  
VERSUS TWO X LIKE WHAT WHAT IS  

01:36:32.857 --> 01:36:33.589
KNOW, IS THREE DECKS NECESSARY  
VERSUS TWO X LIKE WHAT WHAT IS  
THE FORMULATION THAT WENT INTO  

01:36:33.591 --> 01:36:36.658
VERSUS TWO X LIKE WHAT WHAT IS  
THE FORMULATION THAT WENT INTO  
THAT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SOME    

01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:37.427
THE FORMULATION THAT WENT INTO  
THAT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SOME    
OF OUR DOWNTOWN STRUCTURES HAVE 

01:36:37.429 --> 01:36:40.696
THAT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SOME    
OF OUR DOWNTOWN STRUCTURES HAVE 
ENTIRE FLOORS OF VACANCY ALL    

01:36:40.698 --> 01:36:44.166
OF OUR DOWNTOWN STRUCTURES HAVE 
ENTIRE FLOORS OF VACANCY ALL    
THE TIME?                       

01:36:44.168 --> 01:36:45.134
ENTIRE FLOORS OF VACANCY ALL    
THE TIME?                       
AND I GUESS AGAIN SINCE THIS    

01:36:45.136 --> 01:36:45.868
THE TIME?                       
AND I GUESS AGAIN SINCE THIS    
WILL BE MY LAST QUESTION HERE,  

01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:49.038
AND I GUESS AGAIN SINCE THIS    
WILL BE MY LAST QUESTION HERE,  
I'LL THROW AN ADDITION ON TO IT 

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:52.675
WILL BE MY LAST QUESTION HERE,  
I'LL THROW AN ADDITION ON TO IT 
IS AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

IS AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT       
PLACEMAKING AND OBVIOUSLY       
HOPING THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE   

01:36:56.981 --> 01:36:57.647
PLACEMAKING AND OBVIOUSLY       
HOPING THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE   
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THESE

HOPING THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE   
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THESE  
NEW UNITS ARE WORKING THIS

ARE SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVE     
TRANSIT METHODS THAT YOU'RE

BUT ALSO THIS IS NOT OUR ONLY   
DEVELOPMENT OF SCALE AND WE'RE  

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:06.115
BUT ALSO THIS IS NOT OUR ONLY   
DEVELOPMENT OF SCALE AND WE'RE  
BASING THIS ON OUR EXPERIENCE   

01:38:06.117 --> 01:38:06.849
DEVELOPMENT OF SCALE AND WE'RE  
BASING THIS ON OUR EXPERIENCE

LESS PARKING AND I THINK THE    
LEARNING THAT WE'VE DONE FROM   

01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:21.930
LESS PARKING AND I THINK THE    
LEARNING THAT WE'VE DONE FROM   
OUR PRIOR DEVELOPMENTS HAS US   

01:38:21.932 --> 01:38:22.598
LEARNING THAT WE'VE DONE FROM   
OUR PRIOR DEVELOPMENTS HAS US   
LOOKING AT A TIGHTER PARKING    

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:25.234
OUR PRIOR DEVELOPMENTS HAS US   
LOOKING AT A TIGHTER PARKING    
RATIO HERE THAN WE'VE USED AT   

01:38:25.236 --> 01:38:25.935
LOOKING AT A TIGHTER PARKING    
RATIO HERE THAN WE'VE USED AT   
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE      

01:38:25.937 --> 01:38:28.671
RATIO HERE THAN WE'VE USED AT   
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE      
WE'VE SEEN EXCESS PARKING.      

01:38:28.673 --> 01:38:29.771
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE      
WE'VE SEEN EXCESS PARKING.      
IT'S ALLOWED US TO SCALE BACK   

01:38:29.773 --> 01:38:32.642
WE'VE SEEN EXCESS PARKING.      
IT'S ALLOWED US TO SCALE BACK   
AND REALLY MAXIMIZE THE PARKING 

01:38:32.644 --> 01:38:33.509
IT'S ALLOWED US TO SCALE BACK   
AND REALLY MAXIMIZE THE PARKING 
AND OUR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS AND  

01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:36.812
AND REALLY MAXIMIZE THE PARKING 
AND OUR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS AND  
WE DO NOT WANT EMPTY PARKING    

01:38:36.814 --> 01:38:37.580
AND OUR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS AND  
WE DO NOT WANT EMPTY PARKING    
DECKS OR EMPTY PARKING FLOORS   

01:38:37.582 --> 01:38:43.952
WE DO NOT WANT EMPTY PARKING    
DECKS OR EMPTY PARKING FLOORS   
SO THE OVERALL NEED IS BASED ON 

01:38:43.954 --> 01:38:44.487
DECKS OR EMPTY PARKING FLOORS   
SO THE OVERALL NEED IS BASED ON 
EXPERIENCE AND STUDIES.         

01:38:44.489 --> 01:38:52.661
SO THE OVERALL NEED IS BASED ON

THE THREE DECKS IS BASED ON     

01:38:52.663 --> 01:38:53.395

THE THREE DECKS IS BASED ON     
FINANCING CONSIDERATIONS AND    

01:38:53.397 --> 01:38:56.199
THE THREE DECKS IS BASED ON     
FINANCING CONSIDERATIONS AND    
SPECIFICALLY YOU HEARD ME TALK  

01:38:56.201 --> 01:38:56.999
FINANCING CONSIDERATIONS AND    
SPECIFICALLY YOU HEARD ME TALK  
A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT HOW

SPECIFICALLY YOU HEARD ME TALK  
A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT HOW  
WE'RE GOING TO LINE THE PHASING 

01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:00.536
A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT HOW  
WE'RE GOING TO LINE THE PHASING 
SO THAT THE PRIVATE             

01:39:00.538 --> 01:39:03.939
WE'RE GOING TO LINE THE PHASING 
SO THAT THE PRIVATE             
IMPROVEMENTS FULLY SUPPORT THE  

01:39:03.941 --> 01:39:04.873
SO THAT THE PRIVATE             
IMPROVEMENTS FULLY SUPPORT THE  
BOND SERVICE FOR EACH OF THE    

01:39:04.875 --> 01:39:07.910

INDIVIDUAL PARKING DECKS.       

01:39:07.912 --> 01:39:08.978
BOND SERVICE FOR EACH OF THE    
INDIVIDUAL PARKING DECKS.       
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE

INDIVIDUAL PARKING DECKS.       
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE    
WE'VE TAKEN A DEVELOPMENT TRIED 

01:39:12.416 --> 01:39:15.751
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE    
WE'VE TAKEN A DEVELOPMENT TRIED 
TO ALLOCATE THE PARKING THE     

01:39:15.753 --> 01:39:16.552
WE'VE TAKEN A DEVELOPMENT TRIED 
TO ALLOCATE THE PARKING THE     
RIGHT PLACES IN DEVELOPMENT SO  

01:39:16.554 --> 01:39:19.489
TO ALLOCATE THE PARKING THE     
RIGHT PLACES IN DEVELOPMENT SO  
IT HAS THE LEAST NEGATIVE       

01:39:19.491 --> 01:39:20.423
RIGHT PLACES IN DEVELOPMENT SO  
IT HAS THE LEAST NEGATIVE       
IMPACT ON THE FEEL ON THE       

01:39:20.425 --> 01:39:20.822
IT HAS THE LEAST NEGATIVE       
IMPACT ON THE FEEL ON THE       
STREET.

IMPACT ON THE FEEL ON THE       
STREET.                         
SO THE DENSITY IS STILL AMONG   

01:39:24.195 --> 01:39:26.828
STREET.                         
SO THE DENSITY IS STILL AMONG   
ACTIVE USERS, NOT AMONG PARKING 

01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:27.730
SO THE DENSITY IS STILL AMONG   
ACTIVE USERS, NOT AMONG PARKING 
BUT THEN ALSO SPACED IT OUT SO  

01:39:27.732 --> 01:39:31.467
ACTIVE USERS, NOT AMONG PARKING 
BUT THEN ALSO SPACED IT OUT SO  
THAT OUR PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS   

01:39:31.469 --> 01:39:32.301
BUT THEN ALSO SPACED IT OUT SO  
THAT OUR PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS   
CAN BE CONSTRUCTED ALONGSIDE    

01:39:32.303 --> 01:39:33.102
THAT OUR PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS   
CAN BE CONSTRUCTED ALONGSIDE    
THE PARKING DECKS IN A WAY THAT 

01:39:33.104 --> 01:39:35.170
CAN BE CONSTRUCTED ALONGSIDE    
THE PARKING DECKS IN A WAY THAT 
THERE'S NEVER AN ECONOMIC

THERE'S NEVER AN ECONOMIC       
SHORTFALL.

SHORTFALL.                      
SO THE TOTAL SPACES IS A        
FUNCTION OF EXPERIENCE AND NEED 

01:39:39.443 --> 01:39:44.480
SO THE TOTAL SPACES IS A

FUNCTION OF EXPERIENCE AND NEED 
THE NUMBER OF DECKS AND THE WAY 
THOSE TOTAL SPACES IS DIVIDED   

01:39:46.551 --> 01:39:47.683
THE NUMBER OF DECKS AND THE WAY 
THOSE TOTAL SPACES IS DIVIDED   
IS A LOT ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

THOSE TOTAL SPACES IS DIVIDED   
IS A LOT ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

01:44:48.752 --> 01:44:49.651
ABOUT HOW YOU ARE MAKING YOUR   
ESTIMATE FOR WHAT PARKING       
REVENUES FROM THESE DECKS WOULD 

01:44:49.653 --> 01:44:53.589
ESTIMATE FOR WHAT PARKING       
REVENUES FROM THESE DECKS WOULD 
BE AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE 

01:44:53.591 --> 01:44:57.292
REVENUES FROM THESE DECKS WOULD 
BE AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE 
A NUMBER BUT IF YOU DID I WOULD 

01:44:57.294 --> 01:44:59.962
BE AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE 
A NUMBER BUT IF YOU DID I WOULD 
BE CURIOUS TO KNOW IT AND THEN  

01:44:59.964 --> 01:45:00.896
A NUMBER BUT IF YOU DID I WOULD 
BE CURIOUS TO KNOW IT AND THEN  
SO THEN MY THIRD AND FINAL      

01:45:00.898 --> 01:45:07.636
BE CURIOUS TO KNOW IT AND THEN  
SO THEN MY THIRD AND FINAL      
QUESTION ABOUT THIS PART IS     

01:45:07.638 --> 01:45:08.337
SO THEN MY THIRD AND FINAL      
QUESTION ABOUT THIS PART IS     
PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE IS       

01:45:08.339 --> 01:45:11.673
QUESTION ABOUT THIS PART IS     
PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE IS       
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR VISION    

01:45:11.675 --> 01:45:12.408
PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE IS       
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR VISION    
FOR THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS YET 

01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:15.444
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR VISION    
FOR THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS YET 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE IN A  

01:45:15.446 --> 01:45:16.244
FOR THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS YET 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE IN A  
TRANSITION AND THAT PEOPLE, AS  

01:45:16.246 --> 01:45:19.047
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE IN A  
TRANSITION AND THAT PEOPLE, AS  
YOU SAID, ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE 

01:45:19.049 --> 01:45:19.648
TRANSITION AND THAT PEOPLE, AS  
YOU SAID, ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE 
UP THEIR CARS RIGHT AWAY.       

01:45:19.650 --> 01:45:22.651
YOU SAID, ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE 
UP THEIR CARS RIGHT AWAY.       
PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO MOVE FROM  

01:45:22.653 --> 01:45:23.652
UP THEIR CARS RIGHT AWAY.       
PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO MOVE FROM  
TWO TO ONE CAR HOUSEHOLD BUT    

01:45:23.654 --> 01:45:24.452
PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO MOVE FROM  
TWO TO ONE CAR HOUSEHOLD BUT    
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE YOU      

01:45:24.454 --> 01:45:25.287
TWO TO ONE CAR HOUSEHOLD BUT    
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE YOU      
KNOW, THE CARS ARE NOT GOING TO 

01:45:25.289 --> 01:45:27.322
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE YOU      
KNOW, THE CARS ARE NOT GOING TO 
GO AWAY NOW THIS PROJECT        

01:45:27.324 --> 01:45:30.893
KNOW, THE CARS ARE NOT GOING TO 
GO AWAY NOW THIS PROJECT        
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT I BELIEVE     

01:45:30.895 --> 01:45:31.826
GO AWAY NOW THIS PROJECT        
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT I BELIEVE     
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN ON SOME    

01:45:31.828 --> 01:45:34.530
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT I BELIEVE     
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN ON SOME    
OF THE THINGS THROUGH PLANNING  

01:45:34.532 --> 01:45:35.297
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN ON SOME    
OF THE THINGS THROUGH PLANNING  
EMISSION BY BUILDING THE        

01:45:35.299 --> 01:45:36.064
OF THE THINGS THROUGH PLANNING  
EMISSION BY BUILDING THE        
PARKING STRUCTURE SO THAT THEY  

01:45:36.066 --> 01:45:38.767
EMISSION BY BUILDING THE        
PARKING STRUCTURE SO THAT THEY  
CAN BE REPURPOSED.              

01:45:38.769 --> 01:45:41.603
PARKING STRUCTURE SO THAT THEY  
CAN BE REPURPOSED.              
AND WHAT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND   

01:45:41.605 --> 01:45:46.442
CAN BE REPURPOSED.              
AND WHAT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND   
IS HAVE YOU HOW CAN WE ASSURE   

01:45:46.444 --> 01:45:50.312
AND WHAT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND   
IS HAVE YOU HOW CAN WE ASSURE   
THAT THE PARKING STRUCTURES     

01:45:50.314 --> 01:45:53.014
IS HAVE YOU HOW CAN WE ASSURE   
THAT THE PARKING STRUCTURES     
WILL BE DESIGNED AND BUILT TO   

01:45:53.016 --> 01:45:53.782
THAT THE PARKING STRUCTURES     
WILL BE DESIGNED AND BUILT TO   
THE UTMOST STANDARD THAT WE     

01:45:53.784 --> 01:45:57.218
WILL BE DESIGNED AND BUILT TO   
THE UTMOST STANDARD THAT WE     
WILL NEED THEM IN THE FUTURE TO 

01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:57.887
THE UTMOST STANDARD THAT WE     
WILL NEED THEM IN THE FUTURE TO 
REPURPOSE THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE   

01:45:57.889 --> 01:45:58.353
WILL NEED THEM IN THE FUTURE TO 
REPURPOSE THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE   
BUILDING THEM?

ON.                             
WE'RE MAINTAINING THEM.         
WE WANT TO BE SURE IN 15 OR 20  

01:46:05.196 --> 01:46:06.061
WE'RE MAINTAINING THEM.         
WE WANT TO BE SURE IN 15 OR 20  
YEARS AND I'M BEING OPTIMISTIC  

01:46:06.063 --> 01:46:08.663
WE WANT TO BE SURE IN 15 OR 20  
YEARS AND I'M BEING OPTIMISTIC  
WHEN WE WANT TO PUT HOUSING OR  

01:46:08.665 --> 01:46:09.464
YEARS AND I'M BEING OPTIMISTIC  
WHEN WE WANT TO PUT HOUSING OR  
MAKE THOSE STRUCTURES INTO      

01:46:09.466 --> 01:46:10.198
WHEN WE WANT TO PUT HOUSING OR  
MAKE THOSE STRUCTURES INTO      
HOUSING OR PUT SOME HOUSING ON  

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.766
MAKE THOSE STRUCTURES INTO      
HOUSING OR PUT SOME HOUSING ON  
TOP OF THEM AND PUT THEM INTO   

01:46:11.768 --> 01:46:18.073
HOUSING OR PUT SOME HOUSING ON  
TOP OF THEM AND PUT THEM INTO   
THEY'RE NOT CRUMBLING           

01:46:19.576 --> 01:46:27.716

>> THANK YOU SO I THINK THAT I  
COUNT FOR TOTAL QUESTIONS OR    

01:46:27.718 --> 01:46:31.186
>> THANK YOU SO I THINK THAT I  
COUNT FOR TOTAL QUESTIONS OR    
WAS IT FIVE?

COUNT FOR TOTAL QUESTIONS OR    
WAS IT FIVE?                    
I'LL WORK THROUGH IT AND IF I   

01:46:34.625 --> 01:46:35.357
WAS IT FIVE?                    
I'LL WORK THROUGH IT AND IF I   
MISS ONE DRAW ME BACK TO IT.

MISS ONE DRAW ME BACK TO IT.    
I APOLOGIZE.                    
>> SO THE I THINK THE FIRST ONE 

01:46:42.466 --> 01:46:43.398
I APOLOGIZE.                    
>> SO THE I THINK THE FIRST ONE 
THAT I PICKED UP ON WAS ABOUT   

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:45.668
>> SO THE I THINK THE FIRST ONE 
THAT I PICKED UP ON WAS ABOUT   
THE CONCEPT OF FUTURE PROOFING  

01:46:45.670 --> 01:46:46.468
THAT I PICKED UP ON WAS ABOUT   
THE CONCEPT OF FUTURE PROOFING  
GENERALLY NOT NECESSARILY THE   

01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:49.972
THE CONCEPT OF FUTURE PROOFING  
GENERALLY NOT NECESSARILY THE   
PARKING STRUCTURE DESIGN BUT    

01:46:49.974 --> 01:46:50.772
GENERALLY NOT NECESSARILY THE   
PARKING STRUCTURE DESIGN BUT    
FUTURE PROOFING AND I THINK     

01:46:50.774 --> 01:46:51.440
PARKING STRUCTURE DESIGN BUT    
FUTURE PROOFING AND I THINK     
THERE'S A COUPLE COMPONENT      

01:46:51.442 --> 01:46:54.776
FUTURE PROOFING AND I THINK     
THERE'S A COUPLE COMPONENT      
PARTS THAT TO THE PLAN THAT WE  

01:46:54.778 --> 01:46:58.279
THERE'S A COUPLE COMPONENT      
PARTS THAT TO THE PLAN THAT WE  
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THAT HELP  

01:46:58.281 --> 01:47:01.916
PARTS THAT TO THE PLAN THAT WE  
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THAT HELP  
WITH FUTURE PROOFING ONE WE'VE  

01:47:01.918 --> 01:47:02.851
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THAT HELP  
WITH FUTURE PROOFING ONE WE'VE  
TALKED ABOUT ALREADY WHICH IS   

01:47:02.853 --> 01:47:06.555
WITH FUTURE PROOFING ONE WE'VE  
TALKED ABOUT ALREADY WHICH IS   
PHASING AND WE WANT TO MAKE     

01:47:06.557 --> 01:47:07.355
TALKED ABOUT ALREADY WHICH IS   
PHASING AND WE WANT TO MAKE     
SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING THE    

01:47:07.357 --> 01:47:09.725
PHASING AND WE WANT TO MAKE     
SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING THE    
PARKING AS WE GO TO SUIT THE    

01:47:09.727 --> 01:47:13.128
SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING THE    
PARKING AS WE GO TO SUIT THE    
USES AS WE GO.                  

01:47:13.130 --> 01:47:13.862
PARKING AS WE GO TO SUIT THE    
USES AS WE GO.                  
I THINK ANOTHER REALLY          

01:47:13.864 --> 01:47:17.365
USES AS WE GO.                  
I THINK ANOTHER REALLY          
IMPORTANT COMPONENT PART OF THE 

01:47:17.367 --> 01:47:18.100
I THINK ANOTHER REALLY          
IMPORTANT COMPONENT PART OF THE 
CORE THESIS OF WHAT'S BEING     

01:47:18.102 --> 01:47:21.836
IMPORTANT COMPONENT PART OF THE 
CORE THESIS OF WHAT'S BEING     
PROPOSED IS THAT THE REALITY IS 

01:47:21.838 --> 01:47:24.973
CORE THESIS OF WHAT'S BEING     
PROPOSED IS THAT THE REALITY IS 
IF THE CITY OWNS THE PARKING    

01:47:24.975 --> 01:47:25.907
PROPOSED IS THAT THE REALITY IS 
IF THE CITY OWNS THE PARKING    
GARAGES, THE CITY WILL CONTROL  

01:47:25.909 --> 01:47:32.247
IF THE CITY OWNS THE PARKING    
GARAGES, THE CITY WILL CONTROL  
THE DESTINY FOR                 

01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:48.163
                WHAT HAPPENS    
WITH THOSE PARKING GARAGES AND  
THAT DIRT AND I THINK THAT'S AN 

01:47:48.165 --> 01:47:49.031
WITH THOSE PARKING GARAGES AND  
THAT DIRT AND I THINK THAT'S AN 
IMPORTANT COMPONENT PART TO YOU 

01:47:49.033 --> 01:47:49.931
THAT DIRT AND I THINK THAT'S AN 
IMPORTANT COMPONENT PART TO YOU 
KNOW WHAT THE CITY GETS OUT     

01:47:49.933 --> 01:47:50.632
IMPORTANT COMPONENT PART TO YOU 
KNOW WHAT THE CITY GETS OUT     
OF THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE      

01:47:50.634 --> 01:47:51.299
KNOW WHAT THE CITY GETS OUT     
OF THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE      
WE'RE DISCUSSING AT LARGE THE   

01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:52.034
OF THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE      
WE'RE DISCUSSING AT LARGE THE   
IN THE FUTURE IF WE HAVE LESS   

01:47:52.036 --> 01:47:53.368
WE'RE DISCUSSING AT LARGE THE   
IN THE FUTURE IF WE HAVE LESS   
CARS WE WILL PRESUMABLY NEED    

01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:54.202
IN THE FUTURE IF WE HAVE LESS   
CARS WE WILL PRESUMABLY NEED    
LESS PARKING AND WE WOULD LIKE  

01:47:54.204 --> 01:47:55.037
CARS WE WILL PRESUMABLY NEED    
LESS PARKING AND WE WOULD LIKE  
TO REPURPOSE THAT NOT JUST THE  

01:47:55.039 --> 01:47:55.838
LESS PARKING AND WE WOULD LIKE  
TO REPURPOSE THAT NOT JUST THE  
STRUCTURES THEMSELVES BUT MAYBE 

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:59.074
TO REPURPOSE THAT NOT JUST THE  
STRUCTURES THEMSELVES BUT MAYBE 
THE GROUND AT LARGE, MAYBE FROM 

01:47:59.076 --> 01:47:59.742
STRUCTURES THEMSELVES BUT MAYBE 
THE GROUND AT LARGE, MAYBE FROM 
A DEMO AND A REPURPOSING.       

01:47:59.744 --> 01:48:02.444
THE GROUND AT LARGE, MAYBE FROM 
A DEMO AND A REPURPOSING.       
SO I THINK THAT'S THERE         

01:48:02.446 --> 01:48:06.481
A DEMO AND A REPURPOSING.       
SO I THINK THAT'S THERE         
PHILOSOPHICALLY SPEAKING THIS   

01:48:06.483 --> 01:48:10.719
SO I THINK THAT'S THERE         
PHILOSOPHICALLY SPEAKING THIS   
IS ANECDOTAL BUT I THINK IT'S   

01:48:10.721 --> 01:48:11.053
PHILOSOPHICALLY SPEAKING THIS   
IS ANECDOTAL BUT I THINK IT'S   
POWERFUL.                       

01:48:11.055 --> 01:48:11.787
IS ANECDOTAL BUT I THINK IT'S   
POWERFUL.                       
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR          

01:48:11.789 --> 01:48:14.790
POWERFUL.                       
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR          
DEVELOPMENTS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN 

01:48:14.792 --> 01:48:18.626
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR          
DEVELOPMENTS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN 
ABLE TO DO IN PLACES WHERE      

01:48:18.628 --> 01:48:19.294
DEVELOPMENTS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN 
ABLE TO DO IN PLACES WHERE      
WE'VE BUILT PARKING STRUCTURES  

01:48:19.296 --> 01:48:22.230
ABLE TO DO IN PLACES WHERE      
WE'VE BUILT PARKING STRUCTURES  
WHERE THERE WEREN'T BEFORE IS   

01:48:22.232 --> 01:48:23.232
WE'VE BUILT PARKING STRUCTURES  
WHERE THERE WEREN'T BEFORE IS   
DRAW PEOPLE INTO THE COMMUNITY  

01:48:23.234 --> 01:48:26.401
WHERE THERE WEREN'T BEFORE IS   
DRAW PEOPLE INTO THE COMMUNITY  
WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE AND     

01:48:26.403 --> 01:48:29.671
DRAW PEOPLE INTO THE COMMUNITY  
WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE AND     
HAVE THIS VIBRANCY THEY BEGIN   

01:48:29.673 --> 01:48:30.339
WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE AND     
HAVE THIS VIBRANCY THEY BEGIN   
TO PARK THEIR CAR IN THIS       

01:48:30.341 --> 01:48:31.073
HAVE THIS VIBRANCY THEY BEGIN   
TO PARK THEIR CAR IN THIS       
PARKING STRUCTURE THAT THEY     

01:48:31.075 --> 01:48:34.142
TO PARK THEIR CAR IN THIS       
PARKING STRUCTURE THAT THEY     
HAVE AND THEY FIND OUT OVER     

01:48:34.144 --> 01:48:35.043
PARKING STRUCTURE THAT THEY     
HAVE AND THEY FIND OUT OVER     
TIME THAT THEY DON'T NEED ALL   

01:48:35.045 --> 01:48:38.179
HAVE AND THEY FIND OUT OVER     
TIME THAT THEY DON'T NEED ALL   
THREE CARS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT  

01:48:38.181 --> 01:48:41.717
TIME THAT THEY DON'T NEED ALL   
THREE CARS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT  
DRIVING AS MUCH AND MAYBE A     

01:48:41.719 --> 01:48:42.584
THREE CARS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT  
DRIVING AS MUCH AND MAYBE A     
COUPLE OF THE FOLKS FIND THAT   

01:48:42.586 --> 01:48:43.185
DRIVING AS MUCH AND MAYBE A     
COUPLE OF THE FOLKS FIND THAT   
THEY DON'T NEED ANY CARS        

01:48:43.187 --> 01:48:45.454
COUPLE OF THE FOLKS FIND THAT   
THEY DON'T NEED ANY CARS        
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DRIVING AS  

01:48:45.456 --> 01:48:49.524
THEY DON'T NEED ANY CARS        
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DRIVING AS  
MUCH AND THAT THAT HAPPENS JUST 

01:48:49.526 --> 01:48:50.225
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DRIVING AS  
MUCH AND THAT THAT HAPPENS JUST 
WITH OUR RESIDENTS BUT IT       

01:48:50.227 --> 01:48:51.026
MUCH AND THAT THAT HAPPENS JUST 
WITH OUR RESIDENTS BUT IT       
HAPPENS WITH OUR HOTEL GUESTS   

01:48:51.028 --> 01:48:53.428
WITH OUR RESIDENTS BUT IT       
HAPPENS WITH OUR HOTEL GUESTS   
WHERE OVER TIME THE UBER TRIPS  

01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:56.831
HAPPENS WITH OUR HOTEL GUESTS   
WHERE OVER TIME THE UBER TRIPS  
INCREASE AND THE RENTAL CARS    

01:48:56.833 --> 01:48:57.666
WHERE OVER TIME THE UBER TRIPS  
INCREASE AND THE RENTAL CARS    
DECREASE AND WE DON'T HAVE      

01:48:57.668 --> 01:49:01.403
INCREASE AND THE RENTAL CARS    
DECREASE AND WE DON'T HAVE      
GREAT STATS ON THAT BUT WE HAVE 

01:49:01.405 --> 01:49:02.204
DECREASE AND WE DON'T HAVE      
GREAT STATS ON THAT BUT WE HAVE 
GOOD ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND AND 

01:49:02.206 --> 01:49:07.575
GREAT STATS ON THAT BUT WE HAVE 
GOOD ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND AND 
SO GETTING CARS OFF OF THE      

01:49:07.577 --> 01:49:12.013
GOOD ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND AND 
SO GETTING CARS OFF OF THE      
MASSIVE SURFACE LOTS AND INTO A 

01:49:12.015 --> 01:49:12.714
SO GETTING CARS OFF OF THE      
MASSIVE SURFACE LOTS AND INTO A 
PARKING GARAGE IN A COMMUNITY   

01:49:12.716 --> 01:49:15.717
MASSIVE SURFACE LOTS AND INTO A 
PARKING GARAGE IN A COMMUNITY   
WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE AND     

01:49:15.719 --> 01:49:16.684
PARKING GARAGE IN A COMMUNITY   
WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE AND     
DON'T WANT TO USE THEIR CAR IS  

01:49:16.686 --> 01:49:20.422
WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE AND     
DON'T WANT TO USE THEIR CAR IS  
A STEP IN REDUCING THE NEED FOR 

01:49:20.424 --> 01:49:24.125
DON'T WANT TO USE THEIR CAR IS

01:51:59.583 --> 01:52:03.184
THAT'S HOW YOU ENSURE THAT THE  
STRUCTURE IS YOU GET MAXIMUM    
USE OUT OF IT AND THEN IF THE

STRUCTURE IS YOU GET MAXIMUM    
USE OUT OF IT AND THEN IF THE   
MARKET DETERMINE IS AT A LATER  

01:52:06.723 --> 01:52:10.191
USE OUT OF IT AND THEN IF THE

THERE'S LOTS TO LIKE ABOUT THIS 
PROJECT CERTAINLY THIS IS THE   

01:56:42.098 --> 01:56:45.533
THERE'S LOTS TO LIKE ABOUT THIS 
PROJECT CERTAINLY THIS IS THE   
FIRST NOTABLE PROJECT ONE AND   

01:56:45.535 --> 01:56:46.134
PROJECT CERTAINLY THIS IS THE   
FIRST NOTABLE PROJECT ONE AND   
SO IT'S EXCITING TO SEE         

01:56:46.136 --> 01:56:49.204
FIRST NOTABLE PROJECT ONE AND   
SO IT'S EXCITING TO SEE         
SOMETHING THAT'S YOU KNOW,      

01:56:49.206 --> 01:56:53.207
SO IT'S EXCITING TO SEE         
SOMETHING THAT'S YOU KNOW,      
DENSE AND YOU KNOW VIBRANT AND  

01:56:53.209 --> 01:56:53.975
SOMETHING THAT'S YOU KNOW,      
DENSE AND YOU KNOW VIBRANT AND  
AND AIMING TO REINVIGORATE A    

01:56:53.977 --> 01:56:56.277
DENSE AND YOU KNOW VIBRANT AND  
AND AIMING TO REINVIGORATE A    
PORTION OF OUR PART OF OUR TOWN 

01:56:56.279 --> 01:57:00.348
AND AIMING TO REINVIGORATE A    
PORTION OF OUR PART OF OUR TOWN 
SO THAT THAT'S ALL GOOD.        

01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:01.216
PORTION OF OUR PART OF OUR TOWN 
SO THAT THAT'S ALL GOOD.        
HOWEVER I HAVE SOME CONCERNS    

01:57:01.218 --> 01:57:04.419
SO THAT THAT'S ALL GOOD.        
HOWEVER I HAVE SOME CONCERNS    
ABOUT THE SORT THE BASIC        

01:57:04.421 --> 01:57:05.220
HOWEVER I HAVE SOME CONCERNS    
ABOUT THE SORT THE BASIC        
PREMISE UPON WHICH A LOT        

01:57:05.222 --> 01:57:08.423
ABOUT THE SORT THE BASIC        
PREMISE UPON WHICH A LOT        
OF THESE TASKS ARE BASED WHICH  

01:57:08.425 --> 01:57:09.090
PREMISE UPON WHICH A LOT        
OF THESE TASKS ARE BASED WHICH  
IS AROUND THE THREE PARKING     

01:57:09.092 --> 01:57:09.523
OF THESE TASKS ARE BASED WHICH  
IS AROUND THE THREE PARKING     
STRUCTURES.                     

01:57:09.525 --> 01:57:15.931
IS AROUND THE THREE PARKING     
STRUCTURES.                     
SO THERE WAS A GASP             

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:25.273
                    AND THE ASK 
OF THE CITY IS TO INVEST IN     
THREE PARKING STRUCTURES THAT   

01:57:25.275 --> 01:57:28.509
OF THE CITY IS TO INVEST IN     
THREE PARKING STRUCTURES THAT   
ARE FURTHER INVESTING IN ARE    

01:57:28.511 --> 01:57:32.280
THREE PARKING STRUCTURES THAT   
ARE FURTHER INVESTING IN ARE    
YOU KNOW, ON AUTO DOMINATED     

01:57:32.282 --> 01:57:32.813
ARE FURTHER INVESTING IN ARE    
YOU KNOW, ON AUTO DOMINATED     
LIFESTYLES, RIGHT.              

01:57:32.815 --> 01:57:33.815
YOU KNOW, ON AUTO DOMINATED     
LIFESTYLES, RIGHT.              
SO THAT THOSE FOLKS CAN GO TO   

01:57:33.817 --> 01:57:36.084
LIFESTYLES, RIGHT.              
SO THAT THOSE FOLKS CAN GO TO   
ANOTHER GAS STATION AND OUR     

01:57:36.086 --> 01:57:36.885
SO THAT THOSE FOLKS CAN GO TO   
ANOTHER GAS STATION AND OUR     
COMMUNITY LIKELY AND FURTHER    

01:57:36.887 --> 01:57:37.418
ANOTHER GAS STATION AND OUR     
COMMUNITY LIKELY AND FURTHER    
POLLUTE OUR COMMUNITY.          

01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:39.654
COMMUNITY LIKELY AND FURTHER    
POLLUTE OUR COMMUNITY.          
WE KNOW THERE'S MANY            

01:57:39.656 --> 01:57:40.455
POLLUTE OUR COMMUNITY.          
WE KNOW THERE'S MANY            
BROWNFIELD'S ACROSS THE ACROSS  

01:57:40.457 --> 01:57:43.758
WE KNOW THERE'S MANY            
BROWNFIELD'S ACROSS THE ACROSS  
TOWN AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY FROM 

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:44.325
BROWNFIELD'S ACROSS THE ACROSS  
TOWN AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY FROM 
PAST POLLUTION FROM GAS         

01:57:44.327 --> 01:57:47.361
TOWN AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY FROM 
PAST POLLUTION FROM GAS         
STATIONS OR ANY OTHER SOURCE.   

01:57:47.363 --> 01:57:48.530
PAST POLLUTION FROM GAS         
STATIONS OR ANY OTHER SOURCE.   
AND SO THIS THIS PROJECT IS     

01:57:48.532 --> 01:57:54.502
STATIONS OR ANY OTHER SOURCE.   
AND SO THIS THIS PROJECT IS

01:58:08.384 --> 01:58:10.985
     A MODEL OF OF WHAT TYPES   
OF ASSETS WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN 
AS WE FURTHER REDEVELOP ALONG   

01:58:10.987 --> 01:58:11.653
OF ASSETS WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN 
AS WE FURTHER REDEVELOP ALONG   
OUR OTHER C1 CORRIDORS.         

01:58:11.655 --> 01:58:12.853
AS WE FURTHER REDEVELOP ALONG   
OUR OTHER C1 CORRIDORS.

THINK THE IDEA THAT THE         

01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:18.259
OF INVESTING IN THIS IN THIS I  
THINK THE IDEA THAT THE         
COMMUNITY THAT THE CITY WOULD   

01:58:18.261 --> 01:58:18.926
THINK THE IDEA THAT THE         
COMMUNITY THAT THE CITY WOULD   
INVEST IN THIS ONE PROJECT IS   

01:58:18.928 --> 01:58:21.763
COMMUNITY THAT THE CITY WOULD   
INVEST IN THIS ONE PROJECT IS   
ENTIRELY REASONABLE BUT I DO    

01:58:21.765 --> 01:58:25.634
INVEST IN THIS ONE PROJECT IS   
ENTIRELY REASONABLE BUT I DO    
FIND THE ASKE PROBLEMATIC.      

01:58:25.636 --> 01:58:26.867
ENTIRELY REASONABLE BUT I DO    
FIND THE ASKE PROBLEMATIC.      
SO TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER INTO  

01:58:26.869 --> 01:58:30.404
FIND THE ASKE PROBLEMATIC.      
SO TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER INTO  
THAT OR SOME OF YOU CAME IN AS

CARBON NEUTRAL PROJECT AND THEN 
ANOTHER THIRD COME FROM LOCAL

01:59:14.851 --> 01:59:15.983
WOULD HAVE PARKING GARAGES ALL  
THAT MAKE SENSE.                
>> BUT IT'S WHAT'S THE CITY IS

PRETTY STABLE AROUND THERE.     
SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE    

01:59:32.135 --> 01:59:34.335
PRETTY STABLE AROUND THERE.     
SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE

QUESTION IS IF WE'RE GOING TO   

01:59:35.872 --> 01:59:37.939
THAT WE WANT TO GO AND THE      
QUESTION IS IF WE'RE GOING TO

MEET THAT DIRECTION SO I HAVE   

01:59:42.178 --> 01:59:42.910
THAT'S HELPING US TO TO NOT     
MEET THAT DIRECTION SO I HAVE   
SOME I GUESS SOME FUNDAMENTAL   

01:59:42.912 --> 01:59:46.047
MEET THAT DIRECTION SO I HAVE   
SOME I GUESS SOME FUNDAMENTAL

02:08:31.306 --> 02:08:33.641
            WITH IT PAINTING A  
NEW COMPARISON, IT JUST ENDS UP 
BEING A PROJECT THAT'S NOT      

02:08:33.643 --> 02:08:34.242
NEW COMPARISON, IT JUST ENDS UP 
BEING A PROJECT THAT'S NOT      
ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AT THIS     

02:08:34.244 --> 02:08:35.109
BEING A PROJECT THAT'S NOT      
ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AT THIS     
SCALE AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT  

02:08:35.111 --> 02:08:35.776
ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AT THIS     
SCALE AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT  
NOTHING COULD BE BUILT WITHOUT  

02:08:35.778 --> 02:08:36.377
SCALE AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT  
NOTHING COULD BE BUILT WITHOUT  
PARKING DECKS BUT NOTHING       

02:08:36.379 --> 02:08:37.177
NOTHING COULD BE BUILT WITHOUT  
PARKING DECKS BUT NOTHING       
OF DENSITY COULD BE BUILT WITH  

02:08:37.179 --> 02:08:37.978
PARKING DECKS BUT NOTHING       
OF DENSITY COULD BE BUILT WITH  
PARKING DECKS AND SO I'D BE     

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:38.846
OF DENSITY COULD BE BUILT WITH  
PARKING DECKS AND SO I'D BE     
REMISS IF I PUT PERCENTAGES     

02:08:38.848 --> 02:08:39.780
PARKING DECKS AND SO I'D BE     
REMISS IF I PUT PERCENTAGES     
OF REAL DOLLAR FIGURES ON IT    

02:08:39.782 --> 02:08:40.181
REMISS IF I PUT PERCENTAGES     
OF REAL DOLLAR FIGURES ON IT    
TONIGHT.                        

02:08:40.183 --> 02:08:41.348
OF REAL DOLLAR FIGURES ON IT    
TONIGHT.                        
I HAVEN'T RESEARCHED THE GAP    

02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.816
TONIGHT.                        
I HAVEN'T RESEARCHED THE GAP    
BETWEEN THE OTHER               

02:08:41.818 --> 02:08:42.483
I HAVEN'T RESEARCHED THE GAP    
BETWEEN THE OTHER               
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS AND THE    

02:08:42.485 --> 02:08:45.219
BETWEEN THE OTHER               
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS AND THE    
PARKING COSTS OF RECENT BUT     

02:08:45.221 --> 02:08:49.323
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS AND THE    
PARKING COSTS OF RECENT BUT     
IT'S A MULTIPLE TIMES           

02:08:49.325 --> 02:08:50.123
PARKING COSTS OF RECENT BUT     
IT'S A MULTIPLE TIMES           
DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WE'RE        

02:08:50.125 --> 02:08:53.861
IT'S A MULTIPLE TIMES           
DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WE'RE        
ALLOWED TO SPEND ON OTHER       

02:08:53.863 --> 02:08:54.662
DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WE'RE        
ALLOWED TO SPEND ON OTHER       
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OTHER THAN 

02:08:54.664 --> 02:08:57.664

INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OTHER THAN 
PARKING AND THE AVAILABLE       

02:08:57.666 --> 02:08:58.332
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OTHER THAN 
PARKING AND THE AVAILABLE       
PROCEEDS THAT EXIST FOR IT.     

02:08:58.334 --> 02:08:59.166
PARKING AND THE AVAILABLE       
PROCEEDS THAT EXIST FOR IT.     
SO THERE HAS BEEN SOME          

02:08:59.168 --> 02:09:01.802
PROCEEDS THAT EXIST FOR IT.     
SO THERE HAS BEEN SOME          
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS ON IT.     

02:09:01.804 --> 02:09:04.972
SO THERE HAS BEEN SOME          
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS ON IT.     
WE LOOKED AT DOING THE PROJECT  

02:09:04.974 --> 02:09:08.608
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS ON IT.     
WE LOOKED AT DOING THE PROJECT  
ENTIRELY PRIVATELY WHEN WE      

02:09:08.610 --> 02:09:09.242
WE LOOKED AT DOING THE PROJECT  
ENTIRELY PRIVATELY WHEN WE      
FIRST LOOKED AT IT.             

02:09:09.244 --> 02:09:12.413
ENTIRELY PRIVATELY WHEN WE      
FIRST LOOKED AT IT.             
TWENTY FOUR ACTUALLY TWENTY     

02:09:12.415 --> 02:09:13.613
FIRST LOOKED AT IT.             
TWENTY FOUR ACTUALLY TWENTY     
EIGHT MONTHS AGO NOW AND IT IT  

02:09:13.615 --> 02:09:17.084
TWENTY FOUR ACTUALLY TWENTY     
EIGHT MONTHS AGO NOW AND IT IT  
WASN'T FEASIBLE IN PART BECAUSE 

02:09:17.086 --> 02:09:20.554
EIGHT MONTHS AGO NOW AND IT IT  
WASN'T FEASIBLE IN PART BECAUSE 
OF THE PARKING DECKS IN LARGE   

02:09:20.556 --> 02:09:21.255
WASN'T FEASIBLE IN PART BECAUSE 
OF THE PARKING DECKS IN LARGE   
PART BECAUSE OF THE PARKING     

02:09:21.257 --> 02:09:21.588
OF THE PARKING DECKS IN LARGE   
PART BECAUSE OF THE PARKING     
DECKS.                          

02:09:21.590 --> 02:09:22.289
PART BECAUSE OF THE PARKING     
DECKS.                          
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT       

02:09:22.291 --> 02:09:24.925
DECKS.                          
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT       
OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO 

02:09:24.927 --> 02:09:25.593
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT       
OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO 
BE BUILT AND THEN ONCE IT'S     

02:09:25.595 --> 02:09:29.063
OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO 
BE BUILT AND THEN ONCE IT'S     
BUILT IT ALSO GETS TAXED AND SO 

02:09:29.065 --> 02:09:32.032
BE BUILT AND THEN ONCE IT'S     
BUILT IT ALSO GETS TAXED AND SO 
THERE'S A FEEDBACK LOOP THAT    

02:09:32.034 --> 02:09:35.435
BUILT IT ALSO GETS TAXED AND SO 
THERE'S A FEEDBACK LOOP THAT    
HAPPENS THAT MAKES PARKING      

02:09:35.437 --> 02:09:36.370
THERE'S A FEEDBACK LOOP THAT    
HAPPENS THAT MAKES PARKING      
REALLY A DRAIN ON PRIVATE       

02:09:36.372 --> 02:09:39.840
HAPPENS THAT MAKES PARKING      
REALLY A DRAIN ON PRIVATE       
DEVELOPMENT AS A RESULT OF IT   

02:09:39.842 --> 02:09:40.574
REALLY A DRAIN ON PRIVATE       
DEVELOPMENT AS A RESULT OF IT   
BECAUSE THE TAXABLE VALUE       

02:09:40.576 --> 02:09:43.744
DEVELOPMENT AS A RESULT OF IT   
BECAUSE THE TAXABLE VALUE       
ITSELF ENDS UP ENDS UP MAKING   

02:09:43.746 --> 02:09:47.415
BECAUSE THE TAXABLE VALUE       
ITSELF ENDS UP ENDS UP MAKING   
IT ALMOST ENTIRELY FINANCIALLY  

02:09:47.417 --> 02:09:48.282
ITSELF ENDS UP ENDS UP MAKING   
IT ALMOST ENTIRELY FINANCIALLY  
FEASIBLE FOR PRIVATE PARTIES TO 

02:09:48.284 --> 02:09:50.484
IT ALMOST ENTIRELY FINANCIALLY  
FEASIBLE FOR PRIVATE PARTIES TO 
TO DO IT AT SCALE FOR           

02:09:50.486 --> 02:09:53.887
FEASIBLE FOR PRIVATE PARTIES TO 
TO DO IT AT SCALE FOR           
DEVELOPMENT LIKE THIS.          

02:09:53.889 --> 02:09:54.921
TO DO IT AT SCALE FOR           
DEVELOPMENT LIKE THIS.          
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND       

02:09:54.923 --> 02:09:57.791
DEVELOPMENT LIKE THIS.          
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND       
COMMENTS.

A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND       
COMMENTS.                       
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT       

02:09:58.794 --> 02:09:59.593
COMMENTS.                       
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT       
HASN'T BEEN TALKED ABOUT YET I  

02:09:59.595 --> 02:10:02.329
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT       
HASN'T BEEN TALKED ABOUT YET I  
DON'T THINK IN DETAIL IS THAT   

02:10:02.331 --> 02:10:03.163
HASN'T BEEN TALKED ABOUT YET I  
DON'T THINK IN DETAIL IS THAT   
THIS PROJECT IS A VERY LARGE    

02:10:03.165 --> 02:10:06.400
DON'T THINK IN DETAIL IS THAT   
THIS PROJECT IS A VERY LARGE    
ASSEMBLAGE OF PARCELS AND AS I  

02:10:06.402 --> 02:10:07.267
THIS PROJECT IS A VERY LARGE    
ASSEMBLAGE OF PARCELS AND AS I  
UNDERSTAND IT INCLUDES A LOT    

02:10:07.269 --> 02:10:10.303
ASSEMBLAGE OF PARCELS AND AS I  
UNDERSTAND IT INCLUDES A LOT    
OF PRIVATE ROADS, BIKEWAYS AND  

02:10:10.305 --> 02:10:10.971
UNDERSTAND IT INCLUDES A LOT    
OF PRIVATE ROADS, BIKEWAYS AND  
WALKWAYS THAT CREATE A LOT      

02:10:10.973 --> 02:10:11.638
OF PRIVATE ROADS, BIKEWAYS AND  
WALKWAYS THAT CREATE A LOT      
OF CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE     

02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:14.375
WALKWAYS THAT CREATE A LOT      
OF CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE     
NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND THE     

02:10:14.377 --> 02:10:15.275
OF CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE     
NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND THE     
EAST AND THE WEST WHICH IS      

02:10:15.277 --> 02:10:17.911
NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND THE     
EAST AND THE WEST WHICH IS      
AWESOME.                        

02:10:17.913 --> 02:10:18.979
EAST AND THE WEST WHICH IS      
AWESOME.                        
BUT NOW THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS  

02:10:18.981 --> 02:10:22.315
AWESOME.                        
BUT NOW THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS  
BODY FOR TWO YEARS, I HAVE SEEN 

02:10:22.317 --> 02:10:23.017
BUT NOW THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS  
BODY FOR TWO YEARS, I HAVE SEEN 
HOW OLDER DEVELOPMENTS HAVE     

02:10:23.019 --> 02:10:25.819
BODY FOR TWO YEARS, I HAVE SEEN 
HOW OLDER DEVELOPMENTS HAVE     
CREATED AMENITIES SUC AS        

02:10:25.821 --> 02:10:26.620
HOW OLDER DEVELOPMENTS HAVE     
CREATED AMENITIES SUC AS        
PATHWAYS THAT HAVE EVENTUALLY   

02:10:26.622 --> 02:10:29.991
CREATED AMENITIES SUC AS        
PATHWAYS THAT HAVE EVENTUALLY   
CRUMBLED AND THEN WHEN THEY DO  

02:10:29.993 --> 02:10:34.127
PATHWAYS THAT HAVE EVENTUALLY   
CRUMBLED AND THEN WHEN THEY DO  
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THEM     

02:10:34.129 --> 02:10:34.862
CRUMBLED AND THEN WHEN THEY DO  
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THEM     
TAKEN CARE OF APPROPRIATELY.    

02:10:34.864 --> 02:10:36.696
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THEM     
TAKEN CARE OF APPROPRIATELY.    
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING   

02:10:36.698 --> 02:10:37.765
TAKEN CARE OF APPROPRIATELY.    
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING   
IS MAYBE MORE OF A CITY STAFF   

02:10:37.767 --> 02:10:41.235
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING   
IS MAYBE MORE OF A CITY STAFF   
QUESTION IS WITH ALL OF THESE   

02:10:41.237 --> 02:10:44.638
IS MAYBE MORE OF A CITY STAFF   
QUESTION IS WITH ALL OF THESE   
BENEFITS THAT ARE COMING        

02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:45.439
QUESTION IS WITH ALL OF THESE   
BENEFITS THAT ARE COMING        
CONNECTIVITY, HOW CAN THE CITY  

02:10:45.441 --> 02:10:47.808
BENEFITS THAT ARE COMING        
CONNECTIVITY, HOW CAN THE CITY  
ENSURE THAT THEY PERSIST        

02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:48.476
CONNECTIVITY, HOW CAN THE CITY  
ENSURE THAT THEY PERSIST        
THROUGHOUT TIME LIKE WE WOULD   

02:10:48.478 --> 02:10:49.276
ENSURE THAT THEY PERSIST        
THROUGHOUT TIME LIKE WE WOULD

ARE THEY PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED

I GUESS THE HOUSING COMMISSION  
I THINK ALSO LOOKING AT THIS    
DASHBOARD IS ADDED TWO HUNDRED  

02:17:45.795 --> 02:17:47.927
I THINK ALSO LOOKING AT THIS    
DASHBOARD IS ADDED TWO HUNDRED  
ELEVEN UNITS SINCE 2015 THERE   

02:17:47.929 --> 02:17:48.662
DASHBOARD IS ADDED TWO HUNDRED  
ELEVEN UNITS SINCE 2015 THERE   
ARE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY    

02:17:48.664 --> 02:17:51.898
ELEVEN UNITS SINCE 2015 THERE   
ARE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY    
PLANNED UNITS EXPECTED TO COME  

02:17:51.900 --> 02:17:52.632
ARE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY    
PLANNED UNITS EXPECTED TO COME  
ONLINE IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. 

02:17:52.634 --> 02:17:53.634
PLANNED UNITS EXPECTED TO COME  
ONLINE IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. 
BUT JUST TO REMIND EVERYBODY    

02:17:53.636 --> 02:17:56.736
ONLINE IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. 
BUT JUST TO REMIND EVERYBODY    
YOU THE PROMISE OR YOU KNOW THE 

02:17:56.738 --> 02:17:57.437
BUT JUST TO REMIND EVERYBODY    
YOU THE PROMISE OR YOU KNOW THE 
ASPIRATION OF THE COMMUNITY     

02:17:57.439 --> 02:18:00.306
YOU THE PROMISE OR YOU KNOW THE 
ASPIRATION OF THE COMMUNITY     
WHEN WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE   

02:18:00.308 --> 02:18:01.041
ASPIRATION OF THE COMMUNITY     
WHEN WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE   
HOUSING MILLAGE WAS TO BUILD    

02:18:01.043 --> 02:18:03.610
WHEN WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE   
HOUSING MILLAGE WAS TO BUILD    
100 UNITS A YEAR GETTING TO     

02:18:03.612 --> 02:18:04.544
HOUSING MILLAGE WAS TO BUILD    
100 UNITS A YEAR GETTING TO     
2000 UNITS OVER THE LIFETIME    

02:18:04.546 --> 02:18:07.147
100 UNITS A YEAR GETTING TO     
2000 UNITS OVER THE LIFETIME    
OF THE MILLAGE IF YOU DO SOME   

02:18:07.149 --> 02:18:07.881
2000 UNITS OVER THE LIFETIME    
OF THE MILLAGE IF YOU DO SOME   
MATH WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT 

02:18:07.883 --> 02:18:10.750
OF THE MILLAGE IF YOU DO SOME   
MATH WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT 
BEHIND IN THIS TWO HUNDRED TWO  

02:18:10.752 --> 02:18:11.452
MATH WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT 
BEHIND IN THIS TWO HUNDRED TWO  
HUNDRED NEW UNITS THAT THAT     

02:18:11.454 --> 02:18:14.787
BEHIND IN THIS TWO HUNDRED TWO  
HUNDRED NEW UNITS THAT THAT     
REPRESENTS ALMOST 50 PERCENT    

02:18:14.789 --> 02:18:15.622
HUNDRED NEW UNITS THAT THAT     
REPRESENTS ALMOST 50 PERCENT    
OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN   

02:18:15.624 --> 02:18:16.689
REPRESENTS ALMOST 50 PERCENT    
OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN   
THE YOU KNOW, BE A 50 PERCENT   

02:18:16.691 --> 02:18:19.225
OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN   
THE YOU KNOW, BE A 50 PERCENT   
INCREASE ON WHAT'S EXISTING IN  

02:18:19.227 --> 02:18:19.593
THE YOU KNOW, BE A 50 PERCENT   
INCREASE ON WHAT'S EXISTING IN  
THE PIPELINE.                   

02:18:19.595 --> 02:18:22.229
INCREASE ON WHAT'S EXISTING IN  
THE PIPELINE.                   
SO THERE'S REAL COMMUNITY VALUE 

02:18:22.231 --> 02:18:25.966
THE PIPELINE.                   
SO THERE'S REAL COMMUNITY VALUE 
THERE AND REAL BENEFIT THERE.   

02:18:25.968 --> 02:18:26.967
SO THERE'S REAL COMMUNITY VALUE 
THERE AND REAL BENEFIT THERE.   
ALSO TO NOTE ON THE PARKING     

02:18:26.969 --> 02:18:29.869
THERE AND REAL BENEFIT THERE.   
ALSO TO NOTE ON THE PARKING     
JUST A PLAIN ABOUT THE ZONING.  

02:18:29.871 --> 02:18:30.971
ALSO TO NOTE ON THE PARKING     
JUST A PLAIN ABOUT THE ZONING.  
THE SLIDE SAID THAT THIS WAS    

02:18:30.973 --> 02:18:34.374
JUST A PLAIN ABOUT THE ZONING.  
THE SLIDE SAID THAT THIS WAS    
PARKED JUST SLIGHTLY OVER ONE   

02:18:34.376 --> 02:18:40.781
THE SLIDE SAID THAT THIS WAS    
PARKED JUST SLIGHTLY OVER ONE   
SPACE PER THOUSAND UNITS        

02:18:54.863 --> 02:18:56.964
                        .       
I BELIEVE THAT'S ONE STANDARD   
IS IS JUST AROUND THREE SPACES  

02:18:56.966 --> 02:18:57.564
I BELIEVE THAT'S ONE STANDARD   
IS IS JUST AROUND THREE SPACES  
PER THOUSAND UNITS.             

02:18:57.566 --> 02:18:58.031
IS IS JUST AROUND THREE SPACES  
PER THOUSAND UNITS.             
IS THAT CORRECT?                

02:18:58.033 --> 02:18:58.899
PER THOUSAND UNITS.             
IS THAT CORRECT?                
SO THIS IS COMING IN A LITTLE   

02:18:58.901 --> 02:18:59.632
IS THAT CORRECT?                
SO THIS IS COMING IN A LITTLE   
BIT UNDER THE PARKING MAXIMUM   

02:18:59.634 --> 02:19:00.367
SO THIS IS COMING IN A LITTLE   
BIT UNDER THE PARKING MAXIMUM   
OR YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY COMING IN 

02:19:00.369 --> 02:19:01.234
BIT UNDER THE PARKING MAXIMUM   
OR YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY COMING IN 
ON AS 30 PERCENT OF THE PARKING 

02:19:01.236 --> 02:19:01.802
OR YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY COMING IN 
ON AS 30 PERCENT OF THE PARKING 
MAXIMUM FOR TAXI ONE.           

02:19:01.804 --> 02:19:02.335
ON AS 30 PERCENT OF THE PARKING 
MAXIMUM FOR TAXI ONE.           
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.           

02:19:02.337 --> 02:19:03.003
MAXIMUM FOR TAXI ONE.           
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.           
YOU SAID ONE POINT SIX PER      

02:19:03.005 --> 02:19:04.070
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.           
YOU SAID ONE POINT SIX PER      
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET, THOUSAND  

02:19:04.072 --> 02:19:04.871
YOU SAID ONE POINT SIX PER      
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET, THOUSAND  
SQUARE FEET NOT UNITS BUT YES,  

02:19:04.873 --> 02:19:05.939
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET, THOUSAND  
SQUARE FEET NOT UNITS BUT YES,
