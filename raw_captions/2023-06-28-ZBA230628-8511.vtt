LIGHTS HAVE A CCTV OF AROUND    
FIVE THOUSAND K AND MY QUESTION 

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:18.943
LIGHTS HAVE A CCTV OF AROUND    
FIVE THOUSAND K AND MY QUESTION 
IS IF THAT GETS REDUCED TO      

00:33:18.945 --> 00:33:22.580
FIVE THOUSAND K AND MY QUESTION 
IS IF THAT GETS REDUCED TO      
THREE THOUSAND K IS IT WORSE OR 

00:33:22.582 --> 00:33:23.314
IS IF THAT GETS REDUCED TO      
THREE THOUSAND K IS IT WORSE OR 
BETTER FOR SENIORS OR DOESN&apos;T   

00:33:23.316 --> 00:33:26.017
THREE THOUSAND K IS IT WORSE OR 
BETTER FOR SENIORS OR DOESN&apos;T   
IT MATTER OR ARE WE JUST SAVING 

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:26.751
BETTER FOR SENIORS OR DOESN&apos;T   
IT MATTER OR ARE WE JUST SAVING 
ENERGY AND SCREWING SENIORS BY  

00:33:26.753 --> 00:33:30.021
IT MATTER OR ARE WE JUST SAVING 
ENERGY AND SCREWING SENIORS BY  
LOWERING THE LIGHT THE LIGHT IS 

00:33:30.023 --> 00:33:30.755
ENERGY AND SCREWING SENIORS BY  
LOWERING THE LIGHT THE LIGHT IS 
FIVE THOUSAND K BETTER.         

00:33:30.757 --> 00:33:36.026
LOWERING THE LIGHT THE LIGHT IS 
FIVE THOUSAND K BETTER.         
WHAT&apos;S THE ANSWER TO THIS.      

00:33:36.028 --> 00:33:40.030
FIVE THOUSAND K BETTER.         
WHAT&apos;S THE ANSWER TO THIS.      
I AM NOT I&apos;M NOT I&apos;M NOT A      

00:33:40.032 --> 00:33:40.565
WHAT&apos;S THE ANSWER TO THIS.

I WONDER IF THE APPLICANT OR    

00:33:44.404 --> 00:33:47.371
WRITING EXPERT.                 
I WONDER IF THE APPLICANT OR    
CAN EXPLAIN BETTER OF ALL THE   

00:33:47.373 --> 00:33:48.339
I WONDER IF THE APPLICANT OR    
CAN EXPLAIN BETTER OF ALL THE   
AT DOING A BIT OF IMMEDIATE     

00:33:48.341 --> 00:33:51.710

RESEARCH OK SO MY UNDERSTANDING 

00:33:51.712 --> 00:33:55.212
AT DOING A BIT OF IMMEDIATE     
RESEARCH OK SO MY UNDERSTANDING 
AND I THINK YOU ADDRESS THE     

00:33:55.214 --> 00:33:55.980
RESEARCH OK SO MY UNDERSTANDING 
AND I THINK YOU ADDRESS THE     
MAIN REASON FOR THE TWO         

00:33:55.982 --> 00:33:59.083
AND I THINK YOU ADDRESS THE     
MAIN REASON FOR THE TWO         
THOUSAND ONE AMENDMENTS WAS TO  

00:33:59.085 --> 00:34:00.184
MAIN REASON FOR THE TWO         
THOUSAND ONE AMENDMENTS WAS TO  
YOU KNOW PUSH AN ARBITRARY DARK 

00:34:00.186 --> 00:34:03.421
THOUSAND ONE AMENDMENTS WAS TO  
YOU KNOW PUSH AN ARBITRARY DARK 
SKY.                            

00:34:03.423 --> 00:34:04.356
YOU KNOW PUSH AN ARBITRARY DARK 
SKY.                            
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO AGREE     

00:34:04.358 --> 00:34:07.591
SKY.                            
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO AGREE     
WITH ME THAT ARBOR&apos;S NEVER EVER 

00:34:07.593 --> 00:34:08.225
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO AGREE     
WITH ME THAT ARBOR&apos;S NEVER EVER 
GOING TO BE DARK SKY.           

00:34:08.227 --> 00:34:11.129
WITH ME THAT ARBOR&apos;S NEVER EVER 
GOING TO BE DARK SKY.           
I MEAN YOU CAN&apos;T YOU CAN&apos;T SEE  

00:34:11.131 --> 00:34:11.663
GOING TO BE DARK SKY.           
I MEAN YOU CAN&apos;T YOU CAN&apos;T SEE  
ANY STARS HERE.                 

00:34:11.665 --> 00:34:14.265
I MEAN YOU CAN&apos;T YOU CAN&apos;T SEE  
ANY STARS HERE.                 
WHEN I WANT TO SEE STARS I GO   

00:34:14.267 --> 00:34:15.132
ANY STARS HERE.                 
WHEN I WANT TO SEE STARS I GO   
BACKPACKING IN THE ROCKIES AND  

00:34:15.134 --> 00:34:15.600
WHEN I WANT TO SEE STARS I GO   
BACKPACKING IN THE ROCKIES AND  
LOOKING OUT HERE.               

00:34:15.602 --> 00:34:18.602
BACKPACKING IN THE ROCKIES AND  
LOOKING OUT HERE.               
I CAN WALK AROUND WITHOUT A     

00:34:18.604 --> 00:34:19.270
LOOKING OUT HERE.               
I CAN WALK AROUND WITHOUT A     
HEADLAMP BECAUSE THERE&apos;S SO     

00:34:19.272 --> 00:34:19.670
I CAN WALK AROUND WITHOUT A     
HEADLAMP BECAUSE THERE&apos;S SO     
MUCH LIGHT.                     

00:34:19.672 --> 00:34:22.840
HEADLAMP BECAUSE THERE&apos;S SO     
MUCH LIGHT.                     
SO THIS REALLY ISN&apos;T GOING TO   

00:34:22.842 --> 00:34:23.575
MUCH LIGHT.                     
SO THIS REALLY ISN&apos;T GOING TO   
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ANN    

00:34:23.577 --> 00:34:26.778
SO THIS REALLY ISN&apos;T GOING TO   
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ANN    
ARBOR IN TERMS OF BEING DARK    

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.045
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ANN    
ARBOR IN TERMS OF BEING DARK    
SKY.

ARBOR IN TERMS OF BEING DARK    
SKY.                            
YOU WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH    

00:34:27.847 --> 00:34:28.179
SKY.                            
YOU WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH    
THAT.                           

00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:34.051
YOU WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH    
THAT.                           
YES, WELL I THINK WHAT ABOUT

AND I DO HAVE A PERSONAL ANSWER 
FOR YOUR FIRST QUESTION I DON&apos;T 
THINK THE INTENTION OF DARK SKY 

00:34:38.558 --> 00:34:41.592
FOR YOUR FIRST QUESTION I DON&apos;T 
THINK THE INTENTION OF DARK SKY 
IS NECESSARILY SO THAT NO PITCH 

00:34:41.594 --> 00:34:42.560
THINK THE INTENTION OF DARK SKY 
IS NECESSARILY SO THAT NO PITCH 
BLACK I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO 

00:34:42.562 --> 00:34:45.796
IS NECESSARILY SO THAT NO PITCH 
BLACK I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO 
WITH UPWARD GO THAT BELOW THE   

00:34:45.798 --> 00:34:46.464
BLACK I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO 
WITH UPWARD GO THAT BELOW THE   
LEVEL OF THE LIGHTING IT IS     

00:34:46.466 --> 00:34:48.800
WITH UPWARD GO THAT BELOW THE   
LEVEL OF THE LIGHTING IT IS     
ILLUMINATED BUT IF SAY YOU ARE  

00:34:48.802 --> 00:34:49.667
LEVEL OF THE LIGHTING IT IS     
ILLUMINATED BUT IF SAY YOU ARE  
IN AN AIRPLANE ABOVE THEN IT    

00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:52.470
ILLUMINATED BUT IF SAY YOU ARE  
IN AN AIRPLANE ABOVE THEN IT    
WOULD BE DARK FROM THE FOR      

00:34:52.472 --> 00:34:59.377
IN AN AIRPLANE ABOVE THEN IT    
WOULD BE DARK FROM THE FOR      
BIRDS AND OTHER NOCTURNAL FOR   

00:34:59.379 --> 00:35:00.544
WOULD BE DARK FROM THE FOR

MORE QUESTIONS.                 

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.115
FOLLOWING UP ON THAT I HAVE TWO 
MORE QUESTIONS.                 
THIS IS RIGHT ALONG THIS TWEET  

00:35:04.117 --> 00:35:04.716
MORE QUESTIONS.                 
THIS IS RIGHT ALONG THIS TWEET  
SORRY I CUT YOU OFF.            

00:35:04.718 --> 00:35:05.182
THIS IS RIGHT ALONG THIS TWEET  
SORRY I CUT YOU OFF.            
I APOLOGIZE.                    

00:35:05.184 --> 00:35:07.718
SORRY I CUT YOU OFF.            
I APOLOGIZE.                    
GO AHEAD.                       

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.689
I APOLOGIZE.                    
GO AHEAD.                       
WELL BUT I HAVE SOME A LITTLE   

00:35:11.691 --> 00:35:12.223
GO AHEAD.                       
WELL BUT I HAVE SOME A LITTLE   
TIDBIT FOR YOU.                 

00:35:12.225 --> 00:35:15.559
WELL BUT I HAVE SOME A LITTLE   
TIDBIT FOR YOU.                 
A THREE THOUSAND ELEVEN WILL    

00:35:15.561 --> 00:35:16.494
TIDBIT FOR YOU.                 
A THREE THOUSAND ELEVEN WILL    
PRODUCE A SOFT WHITE OR WARM    

00:35:16.496 --> 00:35:19.663
A THREE THOUSAND ELEVEN WILL    
PRODUCE A SOFT WHITE OR WARM    
WHITE OR YELLOWISH COLOR LIGHT  

00:35:19.665 --> 00:35:24.268
PRODUCE A SOFT WHITE OR WARM    
WHITE OR YELLOWISH COLOR LIGHT  
BULB PRODUCES A BRIGHT DAYLIGHT 

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.735
WHITE OR YELLOWISH COLOR LIGHT  
BULB PRODUCES A BRIGHT DAYLIGHT 
KIND OF COLOR.                  

00:35:24.737 --> 00:35:27.405
BULB PRODUCES A BRIGHT DAYLIGHT 
KIND OF COLOR.                  
SO I DON&apos;T THINK THAT THE KEY   

00:35:27.407 --> 00:35:28.038
KIND OF COLOR.                  
SO I DON&apos;T THINK THAT THE KEY   
IMPACTS THE LEVEL               

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.042
SO I DON&apos;T THINK THAT THE KEY   
IMPACTS THE LEVEL               
OF ILLUMINATION PUT CANDLES     

00:35:31.044 --> 00:35:35.946
IMPACTS THE LEVEL               
OF ILLUMINATION PUT CANDLES     
BACK IN THE WARMTH OF COLOR.    

00:35:35.948 --> 00:35:39.150
OF ILLUMINATION PUT CANDLES     
BACK IN THE WARMTH OF COLOR.    
WHAT LITTLE RESEARCH I DID I    

00:35:39.152 --> 00:35:39.951
BACK IN THE WARMTH OF COLOR.    
WHAT LITTLE RESEARCH I DID I    
UNDERSTAND THE FIVE THOUSAND K  

00:35:39.953 --> 00:35:42.821
WHAT LITTLE RESEARCH I DID I    
UNDERSTAND THE FIVE THOUSAND K  
IS CLOSER TO DAYLIGHT WHICH IS  

00:35:42.823 --> 00:35:43.754
UNDERSTAND THE FIVE THOUSAND K  
IS CLOSER TO DAYLIGHT WHICH IS  
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED K IN   

00:35:43.756 --> 00:35:46.825
IS CLOSER TO DAYLIGHT WHICH IS  
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED K IN   
THE THREE THOUSAND IS FARTHER   

00:35:46.827 --> 00:35:47.492
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED K IN   
THE THREE THOUSAND IS FARTHER   
AWAY FROM THAT BUT GLACIER      

00:35:47.494 --> 00:35:50.394
THE THREE THOUSAND IS FARTHER   
AWAY FROM THAT BUT GLACIER      
HILLS IS CLOSE TO US TWENTY     

00:35:50.396 --> 00:35:51.129
AWAY FROM THAT BUT GLACIER      
HILLS IS CLOSE TO US TWENTY     
THREE SO THERE&apos;S OBVIOUSLY A    

00:35:51.131 --> 00:35:54.399
HILLS IS CLOSE TO US TWENTY     
THREE SO THERE&apos;S OBVIOUSLY A    
LOT OF UPWARD LIGHT AND I GO BY 

00:35:54.401 --> 00:35:55.232
