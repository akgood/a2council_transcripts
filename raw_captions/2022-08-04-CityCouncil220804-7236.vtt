CHANNEL AND THE NUMBER          

00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:11.182
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WATER     
CHANNEL AND THE NUMBER          
OF IMPOUNDMENTS ALONG THE RIVER

CONTAMINANT CONTAMINATION       
ENTERED THE RIVER.              
AND THERE&amp;apos;S SO MANY VARIABLES   

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:16.988
ENTERED THE RIVER.              
AND THERE&amp;apos;S SO MANY VARIABLES   
IT&amp;apos;S REALLY DIFFICULT TO        

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.255
AND THERE&amp;apos;S SO MANY VARIABLES   
IT&amp;apos;S REALLY DIFFICULT TO        
PREDICT.

IT&amp;apos;S REALLY DIFFICULT TO        
PREDICT.                        
SO WE&amp;apos;RE HOPING THE SAMPLING    

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:20.358
PREDICT.                        
SO WE&amp;apos;RE HOPING THE SAMPLING    
EFFORT THE EAGLE IS UNDERTAKING 

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.327
SO WE&amp;apos;RE HOPING THE SAMPLING    
EFFORT THE EAGLE IS UNDERTAKING 
WILL HELP PROVIDE CLARITY.      

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:24.395
EFFORT THE EAGLE IS UNDERTAKING 
WILL HELP PROVIDE CLARITY.      
SO I WILL CHOOSE SOME OF THE    

00:08:24.397 --> 00:08:24.996
WILL HELP PROVIDE CLARITY.      
SO I WILL CHOOSE SOME OF THE    
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE

SO I WILL CHOOSE SOME OF THE    
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE         
SUBMITTED FOR ME TO ANSWER AND  

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:28.833
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE         
SUBMITTED FOR ME TO ANSWER AND  
THESE ARE I SELECTED THE ONES   

00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:31.002
SUBMITTED FOR ME TO ANSWER AND  
THESE ARE I SELECTED THE ONES   
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE SEEING PROBABLY MOST 

00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:34.305
THESE ARE I SELECTED THE ONES   
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE SEEING PROBABLY MOST 
COMMONLY FROM FROM CUSTOMERS    

00:08:34.307 --> 00:08:34.906
THAT WE&amp;apos;RE SEEING PROBABLY MOST 
COMMONLY FROM FROM CUSTOMERS    
AND THE MEDIA.

AND THE MEDIA.                  
THE FIRST QUESTION BEING IF     
CHEMICALS WERE DETECTED IN THE  

00:08:38.978 --> 00:08:39.777
THE FIRST QUESTION BEING IF     
CHEMICALS WERE DETECTED IN THE  
WATER SUPPLY, WHAT ACTION WILL  

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:43.013
CHEMICALS WERE DETECTED IN THE  
WATER SUPPLY, WHAT ACTION WILL  
THE CITY TAKE SO AGAIN, WE ARE  

00:08:43.015 --> 00:08:46.083
WATER SUPPLY, WHAT ACTION WILL  
THE CITY TAKE SO AGAIN, WE ARE  
FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT HOW THE   

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:46.884
THE CITY TAKE SO AGAIN, WE ARE  
FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT HOW THE   
TREATMENT PROCESS THAT WE       

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:50.254
FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT HOW THE   
TREATMENT PROCESS THAT WE       
CURRENTLY HAVE IN ANN ARBOR CAN 

00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:50.955
TREATMENT PROCESS THAT WE       
CURRENTLY HAVE IN ANN ARBOR CAN 
BE MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE      

00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:54.625
CURRENTLY HAVE IN ANN ARBOR CAN 
BE MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE      
REMOVING THIS NEW CHEMICAL AND  

00:08:54.627 --> 00:08:55.226
BE MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE      
REMOVING THIS NEW CHEMICAL AND  
WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE            

00:08:55.228 --> 00:08:57.562
REMOVING THIS NEW CHEMICAL AND  
WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE            
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT OVER THE 

00:08:57.564 --> 00:08:57.962
WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE            
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT OVER THE 
COMING ON.                      

00:08:57.964 --> 00:09:01.699
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT OVER THE 
COMING ON.                      
IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE  

00:09:01.701 --> 00:09:02.533
COMING ON.                      
IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE  
OF WATER IDENTIFIED THAT CAN BE 

00:09:02.535 --> 00:09:05.536
IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE  
OF WATER IDENTIFIED THAT CAN BE 
USED INSTEAD OF HERE ON RIVER?  

00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:06.437
OF WATER IDENTIFIED THAT CAN BE 
USED INSTEAD OF HERE ON RIVER?  
SO WE&amp;apos;RE WE&amp;apos;RE FORTUNATE IN ANN 

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:07.205
USED INSTEAD OF HERE ON RIVER?  
SO WE&amp;apos;RE WE&amp;apos;RE FORTUNATE IN ANN 
ARBOR TO HAVE TWO SOURCES       

00:09:07.207 --> 00:09:10.007
SO WE&amp;apos;RE WE&amp;apos;RE FORTUNATE IN ANN 
ARBOR TO HAVE TWO SOURCES       
OF WATER THE CITY WATER SYSTEM. 

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:11.042
ARBOR TO HAVE TWO SOURCES       
OF WATER THE CITY WATER SYSTEM. 
WE HAVE THE HURON RIVER AND WE  

00:09:11.044 --> 00:09:11.842
OF WATER THE CITY WATER SYSTEM. 
WE HAVE THE HURON RIVER AND WE  
ALSO HAVE WELLS LOCATED ON THE  

00:09:11.844 --> 00:09:14.212
WE HAVE THE HURON RIVER AND WE  
ALSO HAVE WELLS LOCATED ON THE  
SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN AND WE BLEND 

00:09:14.214 --> 00:09:14.946

CONTROLS IN PLACE.              

00:51:02.453 --> 00:51:03.418
LAND DOES NOT HAVE STORMWATER   
CONTROLS IN PLACE.              
AND SO WHENEVER WE HAVE A NEW   

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.153
CONTROLS IN PLACE.              
AND SO WHENEVER WE HAVE A NEW   
DEVELOPMENT OR AN EXPANSION     

00:51:04.155 --> 00:51:06.755
AND SO WHENEVER WE HAVE A NEW   
DEVELOPMENT OR AN EXPANSION     
THAT IS IN FACT AN OPPORTUNITY  

00:51:06.757 --> 00:51:07.456
DEVELOPMENT OR AN EXPANSION     
THAT IS IN FACT AN OPPORTUNITY  
FOR US TO IMPROVE THE           

00:51:07.458 --> 00:51:10.692
THAT IS IN FACT AN OPPORTUNITY  
FOR US TO IMPROVE THE           
STORMWATER CAPTURE QUALITY AND  

00:51:10.694 --> 00:51:14.830
FOR US TO IMPROVE THE           
STORMWATER CAPTURE QUALITY AND  
FLOW RATE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT    

00:51:14.832 --> 00:51:15.330
STORMWATER CAPTURE QUALITY AND  
FLOW RATE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT    
WAS THERE PRIOR.                

00:51:15.332 --> 00:51:18.834
FLOW RATE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT    
WAS THERE PRIOR.                
SO WHILE THAT CAN HAPPEN AT     

00:51:18.836 --> 00:51:19.402
WAS THERE PRIOR.                
SO WHILE THAT CAN HAPPEN AT     
TIMES WITH AN INCREASE          

00:51:19.404 --> 00:51:22.504
SO WHILE THAT CAN HAPPEN AT     
TIMES WITH AN INCREASE          
OF PERVIOUS SURFACE, TYPICALLY  

00:51:22.506 --> 00:51:23.238
TIMES WITH AN INCREASE          
OF PERVIOUS SURFACE, TYPICALLY  
WHEN A NEW INVESTMENT HAPPENS   

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.809
OF PERVIOUS SURFACE, TYPICALLY  
WHEN A NEW INVESTMENT HAPPENS   
IT RESULTS A NET IMPROVEMENT IN 

00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:27.343
WHEN A NEW INVESTMENT HAPPENS   
IT RESULTS A NET IMPROVEMENT IN 
THE STORMWATER FOR THAT         

00:51:27.345 --> 00:51:29.445
IT RESULTS A NET IMPROVEMENT IN 
THE STORMWATER FOR THAT         
PARTICULAR PROBLEM RIGHT NOW    

00:51:29.447 --> 00:51:30.545
THE STORMWATER FOR THAT         
PARTICULAR PROBLEM RIGHT NOW    
THE LAST I HEARD I THINK ABOUT  

00:51:30.547 --> 00:51:33.416
PARTICULAR PROBLEM RIGHT NOW    
THE LAST I HEARD I THINK ABOUT  
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE CITY

THE LAST I HEARD I THINK ABOUT  
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE CITY     
PROPERTY HAS FROM WATER         

00:51:34.152 --> 00:51:34.549
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE CITY

PROPERTY HAS FROM WATER         
CONTROL.
