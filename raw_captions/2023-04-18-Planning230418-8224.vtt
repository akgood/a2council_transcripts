THE STANDARDS I SAW AS A PUBLIC 
BENEFIT ELECTRIFICATION WOULD   

00:33:33.983 --> 00:33:37.752
THE STANDARDS I SAW AS A PUBLIC 
BENEFIT ELECTRIFICATION WOULD   
BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND I THINK 

00:33:37.754 --> 00:33:38.453
BENEFIT ELECTRIFICATION WOULD   
BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND I THINK 
CONSIDERATION OF EVEN MAYBE A   

00:33:38.455 --> 00:33:44.592

CONSIDERATION OF EVEN MAYBE A   
TRIANGULAR DEDICATION           

00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:00.342
                      CUT

TREES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR      

00:34:00.344 --> 00:34:01.075
THROUGH PASSED WITH SOME GREEN  
TREES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR      
BETTER CONNECTIVITY WITH BUS    

00:34:01.077 --> 00:34:01.876
TREES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR      
BETTER CONNECTIVITY WITH BUS    
STOP WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I  

00:34:01.878 --> 00:34:02.610
BETTER CONNECTIVITY WITH BUS    
STOP WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I  
WOULD FIND MORE COMFORT DOING.  

00:34:02.612 --> 00:34:03.377
STOP WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I  
WOULD FIND MORE COMFORT DOING.

00:34:03.379 --> 00:34:04.044
WOULD FIND MORE COMFORT DOING.

BUFFER LANGUAGE BUT CURRENTLY   
IF THAT LOT IS SPLIT AND        

00:35:22.658 --> 00:35:23.357
BUFFER LANGUAGE BUT CURRENTLY   
IF THAT LOT IS SPLIT AND        
RESIDENTIAL USES WOULD BECOME

PRESENT NEXT TO IT, THEN THE    

00:35:26.496 --> 00:35:27.295
RESIDENTIAL USES WOULD BECOME   
PRESENT NEXT TO IT, THEN THE    
CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER     

00:35:27.297 --> 00:35:28.063
PRESENT NEXT TO IT, THEN THE    
CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER     
WOULD IN THAT CASE APPLY BOTH   

00:35:28.065 --> 00:35:31.265
CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER     
WOULD IN THAT CASE APPLY BOTH   
TO THE NORTH AND TO THE WEST SO 

00:35:31.267 --> 00:35:34.735
WOULD IN THAT CASE APPLY BOTH   
TO THE NORTH AND TO THE WEST SO 
IT WOULD MAKE THE PARCEL VERY   

00:35:34.737 --> 00:35:38.740
TO THE NORTH AND TO THE WEST SO 
IT WOULD MAKE THE PARCEL VERY   
CHALLENGING TO DEVELOP.         

00:35:38.742 --> 00:35:40.008
IT WOULD MAKE THE PARCEL VERY   
CHALLENGING TO DEVELOP.

MUCH AS IMPACTS ARE FOR THE     
DEVELOPMENT BUT IT WOULD IT     

00:35:48.051 --> 00:35:50.251
MUCH AS IMPACTS ARE FOR THE     
DEVELOPMENT BUT IT WOULD IT     
WOULD REMOVE SOME SOME          

00:35:50.253 --> 00:35:50.652

WOULD REMOVE SOME SOME          
BUILDABLE AREA.                 

00:35:50.654 --> 00:35:55.022
WOULD REMOVE SOME SOME          
BUILDABLE AREA.

THAT&apos;S REALLY WHAT WE&apos;RE KIND   
OF STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE      

00:36:46.041 --> 00:36:49.543
THAT&apos;S REALLY WHAT WE&apos;RE KIND   
OF STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE      
OTHERWISE THIS IS JUST BIKE     

00:36:49.545 --> 00:36:49.777
OF STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE      
OTHERWISE THIS IS JUST BIKE     
RIGHT.                          

00:36:49.779 --> 00:36:50.711
OTHERWISE THIS IS JUST BIKE     
RIGHT.                          
SO WE ALL WE&apos;RE REALLY DECIDING 

00:36:50.713 --> 00:36:52.846
RIGHT.                          
SO WE ALL WE&apos;RE REALLY DECIDING 
IS DO WE WANT THEM TO START     

00:36:52.848 --> 00:36:56.083
SO WE ALL WE&apos;RE REALLY DECIDING 
IS DO WE WANT THEM TO START     
OVER OR NOT?                    

00:36:56.085 --> 00:36:56.951
IS DO WE WANT THEM TO START     
OVER OR NOT?                    
AND JUST PERSONALLY IF THAT&apos;S   

00:36:56.953 --> 00:37:00.320
OVER OR NOT?                    
AND JUST PERSONALLY IF THAT&apos;S

THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO FORCE   

00:37:01.056 --> 00:37:03.057
ALL WE&apos;RE DECIDING, I DON&apos;T     
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO FORCE   
THEM TO START OVER PERSONALLY   

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:07.594
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO FORCE   
THEM TO START OVER PERSONALLY   
BUT I THINK THIS GETS TO A      

00:37:07.596 --> 00:37:10.931
THEM TO START OVER PERSONALLY   
BUT I THINK THIS GETS TO A      
LARGER ISSUE WHICH IS THE       

00:37:10.933 --> 00:37:11.865
BUT I THINK THIS GETS TO A      
LARGER ISSUE WHICH IS THE       
NEIGHBORS IN A VERY AGREEABLE   

00:37:11.867 --> 00:37:15.503

00:37:25.948 --> 00:37:26.814
THEY COMMUNICATED THAT TO US.   
&gt;&gt; DO WE HAVE A TOOL TO REMEDY  
THAT AND HOW WOULD THAT

I AGREE THAT THE MOTION TO      
RECONSIDER PROBABLY MAKES SENSE 

00:45:20.423 --> 00:45:21.621
I AGREE THAT THE MOTION TO      
RECONSIDER PROBABLY MAKES SENSE 
BECAUSE IT DOESN&apos;T MAKE A LOT   

00:45:21.623 --> 00:45:24.591
RECONSIDER PROBABLY MAKES SENSE 
BECAUSE IT DOESN&apos;T MAKE A LOT   
OF SENSE TO JUST FORCE IT BACK  

00:45:24.593 --> 00:45:25.192
BECAUSE IT DOESN&apos;T MAKE A LOT   
OF SENSE TO JUST FORCE IT BACK  
TO THE PIECE.                   

00:45:25.194 --> 00:45:26.126
OF SENSE TO JUST FORCE IT BACK  
TO THE PIECE.                   
BUT THE QUESTION THAT I WAS

TO THE PIECE.                   
BUT THE QUESTION THAT I WAS     
ASKING ABOUT THE TOOL IS NOT    

00:45:28.464 --> 00:45:32.966
BUT THE QUESTION THAT I WAS     
ASKING ABOUT THE TOOL IS NOT    
EXCLUSIVE TO MAKING A ZONING    

00:45:32.968 --> 00:45:33.267
ASKING ABOUT THE TOOL IS NOT    
EXCLUSIVE TO MAKING A ZONING    
CHANGE.                         

00:45:33.269 --> 00:45:35.702
EXCLUSIVE TO MAKING A ZONING    
CHANGE.                         
RIGHT BECAUSE WE COULD PROPOSE  

00:45:35.704 --> 00:45:36.636
CHANGE.                         
RIGHT BECAUSE WE COULD PROPOSE  
ZONING CHANGE AND THEN GO       

00:45:36.638 --> 00:45:37.371
RIGHT BECAUSE WE COULD PROPOSE  
ZONING CHANGE AND THEN GO       
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ZONING   

00:45:37.373 --> 00:45:37.638
ZONING CHANGE AND THEN GO       
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ZONING

THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ZONING   
CHANGE.                         
BUT THAT MIGHT BE TO SPOT       

00:45:40.376 --> 00:45:40.774
CHANGE.                         
BUT THAT MIGHT BE TO SPOT       
ZONING.                         

00:45:40.776 --> 00:45:41.608
BUT THAT MIGHT BE TO SPOT

IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO MUCH

MINIMUM SIZE BUILDING THAT YOU  

02:00:22.353 --> 02:00:25.354
HOWEVER HAS BEEN NOT THE        
MINIMUM SIZE BUILDING THAT YOU  
CAN POSSIBLY GET BUT THE MAX    

02:00:25.356 --> 02:00:26.355
MINIMUM SIZE BUILDING THAT YOU  
CAN POSSIBLY GET BUT THE MAX    
THE ONE SIZE BUILDING THAT YOU  

02:00:26.357 --> 02:00:26.689

02:00:26.691 --> 02:00:27.056
THE ONE SIZE BUILDING THAT YOU

02:00:30.461 --> 02:00:32.928
I LIKE IT RIGHT NOW ALL         
OF DOWNTOWN IS WALKABLE.        
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO MOVE THAT WAY   

02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:36.532
OF DOWNTOWN IS WALKABLE.        
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO MOVE THAT WAY   
AND CHANGE THAT KIND OF VOLUME  

02:00:36.534 --> 02:00:37.066
WE&apos;RE TRYING TO MOVE THAT WAY   
AND CHANGE THAT KIND OF VOLUME  
RESTRICTION.                    

02:00:37.068 --> 02:00:37.833
AND CHANGE THAT KIND OF VOLUME  
RESTRICTION.                    
I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE THERE YET   

02:00:37.835 --> 02:00:40.903
RESTRICTION.                    
I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE THERE YET   
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHERE WE NEED TO  

02:00:40.905 --> 02:00:41.637
I DON&apos;T THINK WE&apos;RE THERE YET   
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHERE WE NEED TO  
BE ABLE TO KIND OF STOP THAT    

02:00:41.639 --> 02:00:44.573
AND SO THAT&apos;S WHERE WE NEED TO  
BE ABLE TO KIND OF STOP THAT    
MOMENTUM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 

02:00:44.575 --> 02:00:44.774
BE ABLE TO KIND OF STOP THAT    
MOMENTUM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
.                               

02:00:44.776 --> 02:00:45.708
MOMENTUM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
.                               
AND MY CONCERN IS WE&apos;LL PENCIL  

02:00:45.710 --> 02:00:49.311
.                               
AND MY CONCERN IS WE&apos;LL PENCIL  
OUT NOW MIGHT NEED TO PUT A LOT 

02:00:49.313 --> 02:00:51.414
AND MY CONCERN IS WE&apos;LL PENCIL  
OUT NOW MIGHT NEED TO PUT A LOT 
OF CARS IF YOU CAN FIT SOME     

02:00:51.416 --> 02:00:52.348
OUT NOW MIGHT NEED TO PUT A LOT 
OF CARS IF YOU CAN FIT SOME     
OF THEM IN YOUR PARKING AREA    

02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:53.216
OF CARS IF YOU CAN FIT SOME     
OF THEM IN YOUR PARKING AREA    
AND SOME OF THE HARDWARE SALES  

02:00:53.218 --> 02:00:56.285
OF THEM IN YOUR PARKING AREA    
AND SOME OF THE HARDWARE SALES  
AREA AS A CONSIDERATION.        

02:00:56.287 --> 02:00:59.722
AND SOME OF THE HARDWARE SALES  
AREA AS A CONSIDERATION.        
SO I SO I&apos;M JUST PARKING        

02:00:59.724 --> 02:01:00.389
AREA AS A CONSIDERATION.        
SO I SO I&apos;M JUST PARKING        
STRUCTURES ACCESS FOR USE.      

02:01:00.391 --> 02:01:00.722
SO I SO I&apos;M JUST PARKING        
STRUCTURES ACCESS FOR USE.      
RIGHT.                          

02:01:00.724 --> 02:01:04.193
STRUCTURES ACCESS FOR USE.      
RIGHT.                          
THAT&apos;S WHAT I HAVE TO KEEP THAT 

02:01:04.195 --> 02:01:07.129
RIGHT.                          
THAT&apos;S WHAT I HAVE TO KEEP THAT 
PARKING STRUCTURE NECESSARY IS  

02:01:07.131 --> 02:01:08.097
THAT&apos;S WHAT I HAVE TO KEEP THAT 
PARKING STRUCTURE NECESSARY IS  
IN THE DC WONDERSTRUCK WHICH    

02:01:08.099 --> 02:01:11.634
PARKING STRUCTURE NECESSARY IS  
IN THE DC WONDERSTRUCK WHICH    
MEAN THAT&apos;S JUST USE SO YOU     

02:01:11.636 --> 02:01:12.702
IN THE DC WONDERSTRUCK WHICH    
MEAN THAT&apos;S JUST USE SO YOU     
HAVE TO HAVE A PRIMARY USE AND  

02:01:12.704 --> 02:01:16.205
MEAN THAT&apos;S JUST USE SO YOU     
HAVE TO HAVE A PRIMARY USE AND  
AND I KNOW WE KIND OF HAVE GONE 

02:01:16.207 --> 02:01:16.705
HAVE TO HAVE A PRIMARY USE AND  
AND I KNOW WE KIND OF HAVE GONE 
BACK AND FORTH FOR              

02:01:16.707 --> 02:01:17.073
AND I KNOW WE KIND OF HAVE GONE 
BACK AND FORTH FOR              
CLARIFICATION.                  

02:01:17.075 --> 02:01:18.541
BACK AND FORTH FOR              
CLARIFICATION.                  
I THINK IT&apos;S PRETTY CLEAR THE   

02:01:18.543 --> 02:01:19.342
CLARIFICATION.                  
I THINK IT&apos;S PRETTY CLEAR THE   
FOOTPRINT OF VEHICULAR USE AREA 

02:01:19.344 --> 02:01:22.812
I THINK IT&apos;S PRETTY CLEAR THE   
FOOTPRINT OF VEHICULAR USE AREA 
WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE BUILDING   

02:01:22.814 --> 02:01:23.612
FOOTPRINT OF VEHICULAR USE AREA 
WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE BUILDING   
CAN BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT      

02:01:23.614 --> 02:01:24.279
WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE BUILDING   
CAN BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT      
OF THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT.      

02:01:24.281 --> 02:01:27.182
CAN BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT      
OF THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT.      
BUT ONCE YOU GET INSIDE OF THAT 

02:01:27.184 --> 02:01:30.319
OF THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT.      
BUT ONCE YOU GET INSIDE OF THAT 
FORM THAT CAN BE A BUILDING     

02:01:30.321 --> 02:01:31.254
BUT ONCE YOU GET INSIDE OF THAT 
FORM THAT CAN BE A BUILDING     
STRUCTURE AS LONG AS IT DOESN&apos;T 

02:01:31.256 --> 02:01:33.756
FORM THAT CAN BE A BUILDING     
STRUCTURE AS LONG AS IT DOESN&apos;T 
EXCEED OUR PARKING MAXIMUMS.    

02:01:33.758 --> 02:01:34.790
STRUCTURE AS LONG AS IT DOESN&apos;T 
EXCEED OUR PARKING MAXIMUMS.    
SO I CAN HAVE LIKE THREE        

02:01:34.792 --> 02:01:38.828
EXCEED OUR PARKING MAXIMUMS.    
SO I CAN HAVE LIKE THREE        
STORIES OF PARKING IN THE       

02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:39.495
SO I CAN HAVE LIKE THREE        
STORIES OF PARKING IN THE       
BUILDING TO GET UP TO MY        

02:01:39.497 --> 02:01:42.098
STORIES OF PARKING IN THE       
BUILDING TO GET UP TO MY        
PARKING MAXIMUMS EVEN IF THE    

02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:42.898
BUILDING TO GET UP TO MY        
PARKING MAXIMUMS EVEN IF THE    
SQUARE FOOTAGE OF PARKING AREA  

02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:43.566
PARKING MAXIMUMS EVEN IF THE    
SQUARE FOOTAGE OF PARKING AREA  
BETWEEN THE VEHICULAR USE AREA  

02:01:43.568 --> 02:01:45.868
SQUARE FOOTAGE OF PARKING AREA  
BETWEEN THE VEHICULAR USE AREA  
AND MY PARKING STRUCTURE IS     

02:01:45.870 --> 02:01:46.602
BETWEEN THE VEHICULAR USE AREA  
AND MY PARKING STRUCTURE IS     
MORE THAN THE FOOTPRINT OF A    

02:01:46.604 --> 02:01:46.936
AND MY PARKING STRUCTURE IS     
MORE THAN THE FOOTPRINT OF A    
BUILDING.                       

02:01:46.938 --> 02:01:49.471
MORE THAN THE FOOTPRINT OF A    
BUILDING.                       
&gt;&gt; YES AND THAT&apos;S WHAT IT SAYS  

02:01:49.473 --> 02:01:49.672
BUILDING.                       
&gt;&gt; YES AND THAT&apos;S WHAT IT SAYS

&gt;&gt; YES AND THAT&apos;S WHAT IT SAYS  
.                               
IT SAYS WE ARE LIMITING THE     

02:01:50.841 --> 02:01:54.010
.                               
IT SAYS WE ARE LIMITING THE     
SURFACE AREA DEVOTED TO PARKING 

02:01:54.012 --> 02:01:57.580
IT SAYS WE ARE LIMITING THE     
SURFACE AREA DEVOTED TO PARKING 
BUT WE ARE NOT.                 

02:01:57.582 --> 02:01:58.814
SURFACE AREA DEVOTED TO PARKING 
BUT WE ARE NOT.                 
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT IS NOT ONE IN THE   

02:01:58.816 --> 02:01:59.515
BUT WE ARE NOT.                 
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT IS NOT ONE IN THE   
SAME AS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER      

02:01:59.517 --> 02:01:59.982
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT IS NOT ONE IN THE   
SAME AS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER      
OF PARKING SPACES.              

02:01:59.984 --> 02:02:05.521
SAME AS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER      
OF PARKING SPACES.              
YEP, SO VAN I&apos;LL GO ALL THE WAY 

02:02:05.523 --> 02:02:06.322
OF PARKING SPACES.              
YEP, SO VAN I&apos;LL GO ALL THE WAY 
BACK TO REPEATING MYSELF ABOUT  

02:02:06.324 --> 02:02:09.225
YEP, SO VAN I&apos;LL GO ALL THE WAY 
BACK TO REPEATING MYSELF ABOUT  
ADAPTIVE REUSE AND PARKING      

02:02:09.227 --> 02:02:10.026
BACK TO REPEATING MYSELF ABOUT  
ADAPTIVE REUSE AND PARKING      
STRUCTURES AND HOW WE TYPICALLY 

02:02:10.028 --> 02:02:13.162
ADAPTIVE REUSE AND PARKING      
STRUCTURES AND HOW WE TYPICALLY 
IN AMERICA WELCOME THE SLIP     

02:02:13.164 --> 02:02:13.830
STRUCTURES AND HOW WE TYPICALLY 
IN AMERICA WELCOME THE SLIP     
FORCE WHICH ARE VERY HARD TO    

02:02:13.832 --> 02:02:16.866
IN AMERICA WELCOME THE SLIP     
FORCE WHICH ARE VERY HARD TO    
DEFINITELY REUSE VERSUS USING   

02:02:16.868 --> 02:02:17.800
FORCE WHICH ARE VERY HARD TO    
DEFINITELY REUSE VERSUS USING   
THEM AS PLATFORMS WITH YOU KNOW 

02:02:17.802 --> 02:02:20.803
DEFINITELY REUSE VERSUS USING   
THEM AS PLATFORMS WITH YOU KNOW

02:02:20.805 --> 02:02:24.606
THEM AS PLATFORMS WITH YOU KNOW 
LIKE SPYRO ACCESS POINTS.       
AND SO IF THERE IS              

02:02:24.608 --> 02:02:25.341
LIKE SPYRO ACCESS POINTS.       
AND SO IF THERE IS              
ALTERNATIVELY ANOTHER WAY FOR

AND SO IF THERE IS              
ALTERNATIVELY ANOTHER WAY FOR   
THIS TO KIND OF GET LEVERAGE TO 

02:02:26.343 --> 02:02:29.379
ALTERNATIVELY ANOTHER WAY FOR   
THIS TO KIND OF GET LEVERAGE TO 
REALLY I KNOW WE HAVE PARKING   

02:02:29.381 --> 02:02:30.246
THIS TO KIND OF GET LEVERAGE TO 
REALLY I KNOW WE HAVE PARKING   
MAXIMUMS BUT TO REALLY MAXIMIZE 

02:02:30.248 --> 02:02:33.115
REALLY I KNOW WE HAVE PARKING   
MAXIMUMS BUT TO REALLY MAXIMIZE 
OUR PARKING STORAGE THERE MAY   

02:02:33.117 --> 02:02:33.850

OUR PARKING STORAGE THERE MAY   
BE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT     

02:02:33.852 --> 02:02:36.752
OUR PARKING STORAGE THERE MAY   
BE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT     
WE&apos;RE SEEING PARKING STRUCTURES

SO THAT WE CAN MEASURE          

02:30:40.302 --> 02:30:43.971
THE USES DELINEATED DIFFERENTLY 
SO THAT WE CAN MEASURE          
INTENSITY DIFFERENTLY AND WHEN

WE THINK ABOUT PRIMARY USE

CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY AND      

02:31:08.531 --> 02:31:10.931
TABLE UM BECAUSE I THINK YOU    
CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY AND      
THAT&apos;S THE PRIMARY USE          

02:31:10.933 --> 02:31:11.799
CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY AND      
THAT&apos;S THE PRIMARY USE          
OF AUTOZONE THAT JUST HAPPENS   

02:31:11.801 --> 02:31:15.370
THAT&apos;S THE PRIMARY USE          
OF AUTOZONE THAT JUST HAPPENS   
TO BE SOME SUBSIDIARY THING     

02:31:15.372 --> 02:31:18.439
OF AUTOZONE THAT JUST HAPPENS   
TO BE SOME SUBSIDIARY THING     
THAT YOU DO JUST GOOD SERVICE.  

02:31:18.441 --> 02:31:22.876

AN EARLIER VEHICLE TRIPS WAS    

02:58:36.544 --> 02:58:39.145

AN EARLIER VEHICLE TRIPS WAS    
MENTIONED VEHICULAR TRIPS AND I 

02:58:39.147 --> 02:58:39.946
AN EARLIER VEHICLE TRIPS WAS

MENTIONED VEHICULAR TRIPS AND I 
THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE LESS     
ABOUT A POINT IN TIME VEHICULAR 

02:58:40.681 --> 02:58:43.115
THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE LESS     
ABOUT A POINT IN TIME VEHICULAR 
TRIPS BUT A TRAJECTORY THAT&apos;S   

02:58:43.117 --> 02:58:43.482
ABOUT A POINT IN TIME VEHICULAR 
TRIPS BUT A TRAJECTORY THAT&apos;S   
POSSIBLE.                       

02:58:43.484 --> 02:58:46.452
TRIPS BUT A TRAJECTORY THAT&apos;S   
POSSIBLE.                       
SO SOMETHING LIKE A CHRISTMAS   

02:58:46.454 --> 02:58:47.619
POSSIBLE.                       
SO SOMETHING LIKE A CHRISTMAS   
SALES LOT, YOU KNOW, IN THE     

02:58:47.621 --> 02:58:48.320
SO SOMETHING LIKE A CHRISTMAS

02:58:54.796 --> 02:58:57.663
GET YOUR TREE AND GET ONLY ONE  
YOU CAN CARRY.                  
THERE WILL NEVER BE A POINT     

02:58:57.665 --> 02:58:58.597
YOU CAN CARRY.                  
THERE WILL NEVER BE A POINT     
WHERE YOU CAN WALK INTO A CAR   

02:58:58.599 --> 02:58:59.265
THERE WILL NEVER BE A POINT     
WHERE YOU CAN WALK INTO A CAR   
DEALERSHIP AND WALK OUT WITH A  

02:58:59.267 --> 02:58:59.532
WHERE YOU CAN WALK INTO A CAR   
DEALERSHIP AND WALK OUT WITH A  
CAR.                            

02:58:59.534 --> 02:59:01.600
DEALERSHIP AND WALK OUT WITH A  
CAR.                            
YOU JUST CAN&apos;T DO IT.

CAR.                            
YOU JUST CAN&apos;T DO IT.           
SO THE TRAJECTORY THERE IS      

02:59:02.603 --> 02:59:03.336
YOU JUST CAN&apos;T DO IT.           
SO THE TRAJECTORY THERE IS      
THERE&apos;S A LIMIT LIKE YOU IT     

02:59:03.338 --> 02:59:06.138
SO THE TRAJECTORY THERE IS      
THERE&apos;S A LIMIT LIKE YOU IT     
WILL NEVER BE ZERO IN EVEN IN   

02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:06.939

UTOPIA WHATEVER BECAUSE IT&apos;S A  
VEHICLE SO IT                   

02:59:26.694 --> 02:59:28.695
              WILL HAVE SOME    
INTERACTION WITH THE CORRIDOR   
MOVING PEOPLE WHICH IS THE

MOVING PEOPLE WHICH IS THE      
PRIMARY FUNCTION OF OUR IDEAS   
TO HAVE AN EFFICIENT WAY
