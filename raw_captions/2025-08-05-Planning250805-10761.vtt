ALLOWS FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR

CURRENTLY VERY HARD TO WALK OR

EVEN DRIVE SHORT DISTANCES TO   
ANY COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES.      
I GREW UP IN PERIPHERAL ARTERY. 

00:06:38.677 --> 00:06:41.344

I GREW UP IN PERIPHERAL ARTERY. 
I DIDN'T CALL IT THAT GROWING

AND MY PARENTS STILL LIVE THERE 

00:06:45.717 --> 00:06:49.252
HIGHWAY AT NEWPORT NEWPORT WEST 
AND MY PARENTS STILL LIVE THERE 
AND WHEREVER MY DAD OR MY MOM   

00:06:49.254 --> 00:06:52.421

00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:57.026
NEED FOOD MY DAD WILL DRIVE TO  
MARKET OR KROGER EVERY SINGLE   
TIME FOR ANYTHING AND I THINK A 

00:06:57.028 --> 00:06:57.694
MARKET OR KROGER EVERY SINGLE   
TIME FOR ANYTHING AND I THINK A 
LOT OF RESIDENTS WOULD REALLY   

00:06:57.696 --> 00:06:58.361
TIME FOR ANYTHING AND I THINK A 
LOT OF RESIDENTS WOULD REALLY   
APPRECIATE IT IF THERE WAS      

00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:00.229
LOT OF RESIDENTS WOULD REALLY   
APPRECIATE IT IF THERE WAS      
COMMERCIAL CLOSER TO WHERE THEY 

00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:03.799
APPRECIATE IT IF THERE WAS      
COMMERCIAL CLOSER TO WHERE THEY 
LIVE IN THESE PERIPHERAL AREAS  

00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:04.000
COMMERCIAL CLOSER TO WHERE THEY 
LIVE IN THESE PERIPHERAL AREAS  
.                               

00:07:04.002 --> 00:07:08.137
LIVE IN THESE PERIPHERAL AREAS  
.                               
SO THAT'S THE MAIN REASON I     

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:09.005
.                               
SO THAT'S THE MAIN REASON I     
THINK ALSO IF YOU INTRODUCE A   

00:07:09.007 --> 00:07:12.141
SO THAT'S THE MAIN REASON I     
THINK ALSO IF YOU INTRODUCE A   
RESIDENTIAL CATEGORY I DO SELL  

00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:12.909
THINK ALSO IF YOU INTRODUCE A   
RESIDENTIAL CATEGORY I DO SELL  
CATEGORY I THINK THAT'S GOING   

00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:15.912
RESIDENTIAL CATEGORY I DO SELL  
CATEGORY I THINK THAT'S GOING   
TO BE CONFUSING PERHAPS AND     

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:16.879
CATEGORY I THINK THAT'S GOING   
TO BE CONFUSING PERHAPS AND     
ALSO THERE WILL THEN BE         

00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:19.649
TO BE CONFUSING PERHAPS AND     
ALSO THERE WILL THEN BE         
RESIDENTIAL.                    

00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:20.583
ALSO THERE WILL THEN BE         
RESIDENTIAL.                    
IT'S MORE THAN THREE STORIES    

00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:21.251
RESIDENTIAL.                    
IT'S MORE THAN THREE STORIES    
AND THE DEFINING PRINCIPLE SO   

00:07:21.253 --> 00:07:24.153
IT'S MORE THAN THREE STORIES    
AND THE DEFINING PRINCIPLE SO   
FAR HAS BEEN A THREE STORY.     

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:25.288
AND THE DEFINING PRINCIPLE SO   
FAR HAS BEEN A THREE STORY.     
SO I THINK THAT MIGHT CAUSE     

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.256
FAR HAS BEEN A THREE STORY.     
SO I THINK THAT MIGHT CAUSE     
CONTROVERSY AND CONFUSION AND   

00:07:27.258 --> 00:07:28.091
SO I THINK THAT MIGHT CAUSE     
CONTROVERSY AND CONFUSION AND   
ALSO IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A   

00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:31.761
CONTROVERSY AND CONFUSION AND   
ALSO IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A   
NEW RESIDENTIAL SUBCATEGORY

00:07:32.397 --> 00:07:35.231
NEW RESIDENTIAL SUBCATEGORY     
WITH CAPERING HEIGHT LIMITS     
THEN I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE 

00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:35.932
WITH CAPERING HEIGHT LIMITS     
THEN I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE 
REINVENTING THE TRANSITION      

00:07:35.934 --> 00:07:36.265
THEN I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE

ARE TWO WAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT. 
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT DISCRETE

ARE TWO WAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT. 
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT DISCRETE 
CATEGORIES, RIGHT?

YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT DISCRETE

MAYBE SOME LIKE A MISSING       
MIDDLE AND YOU KNOW THERE'S

MIDDLE AND YOU KNOW THERE'S     
THERE IS A HUGE RANGE AND I     
THINK WE ARE BEST SUITED FOR

THINK WE ARE BEST SUITED FOR    
THAT LATTER FOR THIS CONTINUOUS 

00:44:05.655 --> 00:44:09.123
THINK WE ARE BEST SUITED FOR    
THAT LATTER FOR THIS CONTINUOUS 
SPACE WHERE I MEAN AS WE HAVE

THAT LATTER FOR THIS CONTINUOUS 
SPACE WHERE I MEAN AS WE HAVE   
IT RIGHT NOW BETWEEN            

00:44:09.659 --> 00:44:12.025

IT RIGHT NOW BETWEEN            
RESIDENTIAL AND TRANSITION, THE 

00:44:12.027 --> 00:44:12.726
IT RIGHT NOW BETWEEN            
RESIDENTIAL AND TRANSITION, THE 
UPPER END OF RESIDENTIAL AND    

00:44:12.728 --> 00:44:15.696
RESIDENTIAL AND TRANSITION, THE 
UPPER END OF RESIDENTIAL AND    
THE LOWER END OF TRANSITION ARE 

00:44:15.698 --> 00:44:16.430
UPPER END OF RESIDENTIAL AND    
THE LOWER END OF TRANSITION ARE 
BASICALLY IDENTICAL IN FORM BUT 

00:44:16.432 --> 00:44:19.767
THE LOWER END OF TRANSITION ARE 
BASICALLY IDENTICAL IN FORM BUT 
IN USE IT CAN BE DIFFERENT.     

00:44:19.769 --> 00:44:20.701
BASICALLY IDENTICAL IN FORM BUT 
IN USE IT CAN BE DIFFERENT.     
WE HAVE MORE LENIENCY FOR THE   

00:44:20.703 --> 00:44:23.704
IN USE IT CAN BE DIFFERENT.     
WE HAVE MORE LENIENCY FOR THE   
COMMERCIAL, MORE ABILITY TO YOU 

00:44:23.706 --> 00:44:24.805
WE HAVE MORE LENIENCY FOR THE   
COMMERCIAL, MORE ABILITY TO YOU 
KNOW, IF I LIVE IN TRANSITION I 

00:44:24.807 --> 00:44:27.407

TO JUST HAVE EVERYBODY STEP     
BACK A MINUTE AND THINK HOW DID 
WE GET HERE?                    

00:50:38.814 --> 00:50:39.879
BACK A MINUTE AND THINK HOW DID 
WE GET HERE?                    
AND THE INITIAL PART OF THIS    

00:50:39.881 --> 00:50:42.950
WE GET HERE?                    
AND THE INITIAL PART OF THIS    
WAS TO HAVE A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 

00:50:42.952 --> 00:50:46.520
AND THE INITIAL PART OF THIS    
WAS TO HAVE A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 
WHERE YOU HAD ONE VIEW AND THE  

00:50:46.522 --> 00:50:49.857
WAS TO HAVE A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 
WHERE YOU HAD ONE VIEW AND THE  
PUBLIC WAS TOLD ANOTHER VIEW    

00:50:49.859 --> 00:50:53.660
WHERE YOU HAD ONE VIEW AND THE  
PUBLIC WAS TOLD ANOTHER VIEW    
THEN THERE WERE NO NO           

00:50:53.662 --> 00:50:54.461
PUBLIC WAS TOLD ANOTHER VIEW    
THEN THERE WERE NO NO           
NEIGHBORHOOD DISCUSSIONS AT ALL 

00:50:54.463 --> 00:50:57.597
THEN THERE WERE NO NO           
NEIGHBORHOOD DISCUSSIONS AT ALL 
THAT WERE SCIENTIFIC IN ANY WAY 

00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:58.531
NEIGHBORHOOD DISCUSSIONS AT ALL 
THAT WERE SCIENTIFIC IN ANY WAY 
WHERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY TELL   

00:50:58.533 --> 00:51:02.035
THAT WERE SCIENTIFIC IN ANY WAY 
WHERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY TELL   
WHAT YOUR BASE WANTED AND WHAT  

00:51:02.037 --> 00:51:02.770
WHERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY TELL   
WHAT YOUR BASE WANTED AND WHAT  
THE WHAT THE OTHER GENERAL      

00:51:02.772 --> 00:51:03.503
WHAT YOUR BASE WANTED AND WHAT  
THE WHAT THE OTHER GENERAL      
PUBLIC THAT MAYBE WASN'T AS     

00:51:03.505 --> 00:51:05.972
THE WHAT THE OTHER GENERAL      
PUBLIC THAT MAYBE WASN'T AS     
INFORMED ON IT.                 

00:51:05.974 --> 00:51:07.207
PUBLIC THAT MAYBE WASN'T AS     
INFORMED ON IT.                 
AND SO NOW YOU END UP WITH THIS 

00:51:07.209 --> 00:51:09.476
INFORMED ON IT.                 
AND SO NOW YOU END UP WITH THIS 
CONTENTIOUS BATTLE AND YOU CAN  

00:51:09.478 --> 00:51:10.477
AND SO NOW YOU END UP WITH THIS 
CONTENTIOUS BATTLE AND YOU CAN  
YOU CAN PUSH THROUGH WHAT YOU   

00:51:10.479 --> 00:51:11.211
CONTENTIOUS BATTLE AND YOU CAN  
YOU CAN PUSH THROUGH WHAT YOU   
WANT AND THEN COUNCIL CAN       

00:51:11.213 --> 00:51:14.081
YOU CAN PUSH THROUGH WHAT YOU   
WANT AND THEN COUNCIL CAN       
DECIDE TO RISK WHETHER THEY     

00:51:14.083 --> 00:51:15.049
WANT AND THEN COUNCIL CAN       
DECIDE TO RISK WHETHER THEY     
WANT TO RUN ON THAT OR WHETHER  

00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:15.649
DECIDE TO RISK WHETHER THEY     
WANT TO RUN ON THAT OR WHETHER  
THEY WHETHER THEY WANT TO

SIMILARLY THAT COULD BE

THAT IS THE MIDPOINT OF THE     
GABLES THAT MIGHT RESULT IN A   

01:43:14.867 --> 01:43:15.733
THAT IS THE MIDPOINT OF THE     
GABLES THAT MIGHT RESULT IN A   
THIRTY EIGHT FOOT BUILDING OR A

THIRTY EIGHT FOOT BUILDING OR A 
THIRTY NINE FOOT BUILDING IF    
THE IF THAT 30 FOOT POINT WAS

HALF OF WHATEVER THE HEIGHT     
OF THAT GAP WAS.                
SO YOU COULD IMAGINE DOING LEGO

SO YOU COULD IMAGINE DOING LEGO

INCREASING UNITS AND INFILL     
DEVELOPMENT ON A SITE THAT HAS  
TRADITIONALLY BEEN DIFFICULT    

02:49:02.243 --> 02:49:04.577
DEVELOPMENT ON A SITE THAT HAS  
TRADITIONALLY BEEN DIFFICULT    
DOES MAKE SENSE.                

02:49:04.579 --> 02:49:05.512

THERE MAY BE A SLIGHTLY         

02:49:09.417 --> 02:49:10.150
IN THE VICINITY I DO BELIEVE    
THERE MAY BE A SLIGHTLY         
NEGATIVE IMPACT TO THE SCALE    

02:49:10.152 --> 02:49:12.919
THERE MAY BE A SLIGHTLY         
NEGATIVE IMPACT TO THE SCALE    
RELATIVE TO FOLKS THAT          

02:49:12.921 --> 02:49:16.189
NEGATIVE IMPACT TO THE SCALE    
RELATIVE TO FOLKS THAT          
CURRENTLY LIVE IN THE CONDOS    

02:49:16.191 --> 02:49:17.257
RELATIVE TO FOLKS THAT          
CURRENTLY LIVE IN THE CONDOS    
BUT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT ALL 

02:49:17.259 --> 02:49:20.993
CURRENTLY LIVE IN THE CONDOS    
BUT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT ALL 
POLICY IS ABOUT TRADE OFFS AND  

02:49:20.995 --> 02:49:21.728
BUT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT ALL 
POLICY IS ABOUT TRADE OFFS AND  
I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT    

02:49:21.730 --> 02:49:24.197
POLICY IS ABOUT TRADE OFFS AND  
I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT    
AND AGAIN I LIVE HERE RIGHT     

02:49:24.199 --> 02:49:27.434
I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT    
AND AGAIN I LIVE HERE RIGHT     
LIKE THIS IS I WALK THIS PLACE  

02:49:27.436 --> 02:49:27.967
AND AGAIN I LIVE HERE RIGHT     
LIKE THIS IS I WALK THIS PLACE  
EVERY SINGLE TIME.              

02:49:27.969 --> 02:49:28.968
LIKE THIS IS I WALK THIS PLACE  
EVERY SINGLE TIME.              
I LOVE THAT SUNSET AS I WALK    

02:49:28.970 --> 02:49:31.904
EVERY SINGLE TIME.              
I LOVE THAT SUNSET AS I WALK    
THERE BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT    

02:49:31.906 --> 02:49:32.572
I LOVE THAT SUNSET AS I WALK    
THERE BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT    
THE BALANCING OF NEEDS OF THE   

02:49:32.574 --> 02:49:35.875
THERE BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT    
THE BALANCING OF NEEDS OF THE   
GENERAL POPULACE OF HOW MANY    

02:49:35.877 --> 02:49:36.609
THE BALANCING OF NEEDS OF THE   
GENERAL POPULACE OF HOW MANY    
FOLKS SHOULD LIVE IN ANN ARBOR  

02:49:36.611 --> 02:49:39.779
GENERAL POPULACE OF HOW MANY    
FOLKS SHOULD LIVE IN ANN ARBOR  
OR SHOULD HAVE DESERVE A PLACE  

02:49:39.781 --> 02:49:40.080
FOLKS SHOULD LIVE IN ANN ARBOR  
OR SHOULD HAVE DESERVE A PLACE  
TO LIVE.                        

02:49:40.082 --> 02:49:43.483
OR SHOULD HAVE DESERVE A PLACE  
TO LIVE.                        
AND SO I THINK THE ORIENTATION  

02:49:43.485 --> 02:49:44.417
TO LIVE.                        
AND SO I THINK THE ORIENTATION  
OF THE SITE FAVORS THE WESTERN  

02:49:44.419 --> 02:49:47.453
AND SO I THINK THE ORIENTATION  
OF THE SITE FAVORS THE WESTERN  
FACE AND NOT THE SOUTHEASTERN   

02:49:47.455 --> 02:49:47.854
OF THE SITE FAVORS THE WESTERN  
FACE AND NOT THE SOUTHEASTERN   
FACE.                           

02:49:47.856 --> 02:49:49.056
FACE AND NOT THE SOUTHEASTERN   
FACE.

IT IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE WHEN

OCRACOKE CONDOS.                
IT IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE WHEN

THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT IT.  

02:50:39.341 --> 02:50:40.473
KIND OF THE PULLS OF OH MAN     
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT IT.  
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO 

02:50:40.475 --> 02:50:43.342
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT IT.  
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO 
LOOK AT HOLISTIC WHAT IS IN THE 

02:50:43.344 --> 02:50:44.010
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO 
LOOK AT HOLISTIC WHAT IS IN THE 
BEST INTERESTS OF THE CITY AS

LOOK AT HOLISTIC WHAT IS IN THE

03:00:24.892 --> 03:00:28.460
OF HEAT PUMPS SO WE'RE LOOKING  
AT THAT AS A SAFETY COMPONENT.  
BUT IT'S OUR GOAL TO BE ALL     

03:00:28.462 --> 03:00:31.096
AT THAT AS A SAFETY COMPONENT.  
BUT IT'S OUR GOAL TO BE ALL

BUT IT'S OUR GOAL TO BE ALL

ELECTRIC IN THE UNITS.          
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE        
ACHIEVING FOR SOME REASON

THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE        
ACHIEVING FOR SOME REASON       
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.            

03:00:35.203 --> 03:00:36.135
ACHIEVING FOR SOME REASON       
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.            
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S GOING 

03:00:36.137 --> 03:00:38.671
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.            
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S GOING 
TO BE THE CASE.                 

03:00:38.673 --> 03:00:39.838
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S GOING 
TO BE THE CASE.                 
WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW          

03:00:39.840 --> 03:00:43.208
TO BE THE CASE.                 
WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW          
GENERATION OF HEAT PUMP THAT I  

03:00:43.210 --> 03:00:43.909
WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW          
GENERATION OF HEAT PUMP THAT I  
HOPE WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THE   

03:00:43.911 --> 03:00:46.178
GENERATION OF HEAT PUMP THAT I  
HOPE WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THE   
TIME WE START CONSTRUCTION.     

03:00:46.180 --> 03:00:49.648
HOPE WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THE   
TIME WE START CONSTRUCTION.     
THE TYPICAL HEAT PUMP HAS       

03:00:49.650 --> 03:00:50.616
TIME WE START CONSTRUCTION.     
THE TYPICAL HEAT PUMP HAS       
ELECTRIC BACKUPS TRIP THAT IS   

03:00:50.618 --> 03:00:54.487
THE TYPICAL HEAT PUMP HAS       
ELECTRIC BACKUPS TRIP THAT IS   
AN EITHER OR IT IT'S EITHER THE 

03:00:54.489 --> 03:00:58.157
ELECTRIC BACKUPS TRIP THAT IS   
AN EITHER OR IT IT'S EITHER THE 
HEAT PUMPS RUNNING OR IF IT'S   

03:00:58.159 --> 03:00:58.891
AN EITHER OR IT IT'S EITHER THE 
HEAT PUMPS RUNNING OR IF IT'S   
REALLY COLD IT SHUTS OFF THE    

03:00:58.893 --> 03:01:01.661
HEAT PUMPS RUNNING OR IF IT'S   
REALLY COLD IT SHUTS OFF THE    
ELECTRIC STRIP COMES ON THE NEW 

03:01:01.663 --> 03:01:02.595
REALLY COLD IT SHUTS OFF THE    
ELECTRIC STRIP COMES ON THE NEW 
GENERATION OF UNITS HAS A STRIP 

03:01:02.597 --> 03:01:05.064
ELECTRIC STRIP COMES ON THE NEW 
GENERATION OF UNITS HAS A STRIP 
THAT COMES ON MARGINALLY.       

03:01:05.066 --> 03:01:09.902
GENERATION OF UNITS HAS A STRIP 
THAT COMES ON MARGINALLY.       
SO THAT DEPENDS ON HEAT PUMP    

03:01:09.904 --> 03:01:10.869
THAT COMES ON MARGINALLY.       
SO THAT DEPENDS ON HEAT PUMP    
ACTIVITY FOR AS LONG AS         

03:01:10.871 --> 03:01:14.373
SO THAT DEPENDS ON HEAT PUMP    
ACTIVITY FOR AS LONG AS         
POSSIBLE AS THE TEMPERATURE     

03:01:14.375 --> 03:01:14.574
ACTIVITY FOR AS LONG AS         
POSSIBLE AS THE TEMPERATURE     
DROPS.                          

03:01:14.576 --> 03:01:18.210
POSSIBLE AS THE TEMPERATURE     
DROPS.                          
SO WE THINK THAT THAT WILL      

03:01:18.212 --> 03:01:21.614
DROPS.                          
SO WE THINK THAT THAT WILL      
ACTUALLY DELIVER A LOWER COST   

03:01:21.616 --> 03:01:22.581
SO WE THINK THAT THAT WILL      
ACTUALLY DELIVER A LOWER COST   
TO THE RESIDENT THAN THE        

03:01:22.583 --> 03:01:26.051
ACTUALLY DELIVER A LOWER COST   
TO THE RESIDENT THAN THE        
CURRENT STANDARD THAT'S OUT     

03:01:26.053 --> 03:01:26.285
TO THE RESIDENT THAN THE

THERE.

CURRENT STANDARD THAT'S OUT     
THERE.

THAT'S OUR GOAL.                
WE WANT THAT WE REALLY DO.      

03:03:48.295 --> 03:03:49.328
THAT'S OUR GOAL.                
WE WANT THAT WE REALLY DO.      
WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO TELL YOU   

03:03:49.330 --> 03:03:52.565
WE WANT THAT WE REALLY DO.      
WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO TELL YOU   
ONE THING AND DO ANOTHER.       

03:03:52.567 --> 03:03:53.499
WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO TELL YOU   
ONE THING AND DO ANOTHER.       
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.  

03:03:53.501 --> 03:03:54.300
ONE THING AND DO ANOTHER.       
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.  
I'D RATHER NOT RUN GAS LINES    

03:03:54.302 --> 03:03:56.502
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.  
I'D RATHER NOT RUN GAS LINES    
THROUGH THE BUILDING.           

03:03:56.504 --> 03:03:57.102
I'D RATHER NOT RUN GAS LINES    
THROUGH THE BUILDING.           
I REALLY WOULD.

I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

I REALLY WOULD.                 
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.          
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.          
IT'S EXPENSIVE.                 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE AWESOME

IT'S EXPENSIVE.                 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE AWESOME   
AND BECAUSE THAT'S NOT PART

03:04:15.523 --> 03:04:19.391
DIDN'T EXIST BECAUSE THERE'S NO

IT'S ACTUALLY NOT I'M GOING TO  
LEAVE THAT FOR OTHERS IF

THE OTHER THING THAT I          
TYPICALLY DO RELATED TO THIS,

REZONING IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW   

03:04:46.120 --> 03:04:49.355
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S THE        
REZONING IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW   
THE BUILDING THAT WE'RE SEEING  

03:04:49.357 --> 03:04:50.289
REZONING IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW   
THE BUILDING THAT WE'RE SEEING  
IN THE SITE PLAN COMPARES TO    

03:04:50.291 --> 03:04:53.359
THE BUILDING THAT WE'RE SEEING  
IN THE SITE PLAN COMPARES TO    
WHAT ELSE CAN BE BUILT ON THIS  

03:04:53.361 --> 03:04:57.229
IN THE SITE PLAN COMPARES TO    
WHAT ELSE CAN BE BUILT ON THIS

PARTICULAR SITE PLAN DIDN'T GET 
BUILT.                          
SO I KIND OF DID THE COMPARISON 

03:05:01.803 --> 03:05:04.737
BUILT.                          
SO I KIND OF DID THE COMPARISON 
THIS IS SHOWING A HEIGHT        

03:05:04.739 --> 03:05:07.807
SO I KIND OF DID THE COMPARISON 
THIS IS SHOWING A HEIGHT        
OF FIVE STORIES IN THIS ZONING

THIS IS SHOWING A HEIGHT

DIFFERENT IS IN THE NUMBER      
OF DWELLING UNITS SO THE        

03:05:20.988 --> 03:05:24.223
DIFFERENT IS IN THE NUMBER      
OF DWELLING UNITS SO THE        
REZONING WOULD ALLOW FOR THREE

OUTDOOR AMENITY, THINGS LIKE    

03:05:51.085 --> 03:05:54.720

OUTDOOR AMENITY, THINGS LIKE

WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO    
MEET IT WITH MORE UNITS.        
NOW IT MAY BE TRUE THAT WE      

03:06:02.363 --> 03:06:06.298
MEET IT WITH MORE UNITS.        
NOW IT MAY BE TRUE THAT WE      
COULD MEET DEPENDS HOW MANY     

03:06:06.300 --> 03:06:06.898
NOW IT MAY BE TRUE THAT WE      
COULD MEET DEPENDS HOW MANY     
BALCONIES WE PUT IN.            

03:06:06.900 --> 03:06:07.866
COULD MEET DEPENDS HOW MANY

IT DEPENDS IF WE PUT ON         
BALCONIES AT ALL.               
BUT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO GET    

03:06:11.005 --> 03:06:13.839

BUT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO GET    
CLOSE TO THAT LIMIT.            
SO THE IDEA OF BUILDING ANOTHER 

03:06:14.942 --> 03:06:18.443
CLOSE TO THAT LIMIT.            
SO THE IDEA OF BUILDING ANOTHER 
STORY WOULD HAVE TO BE STUDIED  

03:06:18.445 --> 03:06:19.378
SO THE IDEA OF BUILDING ANOTHER 
STORY WOULD HAVE TO BE STUDIED  
TO SEE THAT WE MEET THE OPEN    

03:06:19.380 --> 03:06:21.513
STORY WOULD HAVE TO BE STUDIED  
TO SEE THAT WE MEET THE OPEN    
SPACE REQUIREMENT AND I'M NOT   

03:06:21.515 --> 03:06:22.314
TO SEE THAT WE MEET THE OPEN

SURE I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD.     
YEAH.                           
SO WE DIDN'T PROPOSE THAT AND   

03:06:25.652 --> 03:06:26.385
YEAH.                           
SO WE DIDN'T PROPOSE THAT AND   
WE'RE NOT INTENDING TO DO THAT. 

03:06:26.387 --> 03:06:28.954
SO WE DIDN'T PROPOSE THAT AND   
WE'RE NOT INTENDING TO DO THAT. 
OK, I WANT THIS TO BE CLEAR.    

03:06:28.956 --> 03:06:30.021
WE'RE NOT INTENDING TO DO THAT. 
OK, I WANT THIS TO BE CLEAR.    
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO ADD       

03:06:30.023 --> 03:06:30.423
OK, I WANT THIS TO BE CLEAR.    
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO ADD       
ANOTHER STORY.

I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO ADD       
ANOTHER STORY.                  
I'M JUST MAKING CLEAR REZONING  

03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:34.025
ANOTHER STORY.                  
I'M JUST MAKING CLEAR REZONING  
THIS MEANS THAT YOU COULD IN    

03:06:34.027 --> 03:06:37.196
I'M JUST MAKING CLEAR REZONING  
THIS MEANS THAT YOU COULD IN    
ANOTHER LIKE THE RESULTING      

03:06:37.198 --> 03:06:38.063
THIS MEANS THAT YOU COULD IN    
ANOTHER LIKE THE RESULTING      
WOULD STICK WITH THE LAND THE

ANOTHER LIKE THE RESULTING      
WOULD STICK WITH THE LAND THE   
SITE PLAN CAN CHANGE AND OPEN

WOULD STICK WITH THE LAND THE   
SITE PLAN CAN CHANGE AND OPEN   
SPACE IT IS SHOWING FORTY FIVE  

03:06:45.006 --> 03:06:48.173
SITE PLAN CAN CHANGE AND OPEN   
SPACE IT IS SHOWING FORTY FIVE  
PERCENT OPEN SPACE IS WHAT'S    

03:06:48.175 --> 03:06:48.507
SPACE IT IS SHOWING FORTY FIVE  
PERCENT OPEN SPACE IS WHAT'S    
REQUIRED.

PERCENT OPEN SPACE IS WHAT'S    
REQUIRED.                       
SO IT'S QUITE NICE TO SEE WHERE 

03:06:49.476 --> 03:06:50.175
REQUIRED.                       
SO IT'S QUITE NICE TO SEE WHERE 
YOU'RE CLOSE AND SPECIALLY LIKE

YOU'RE CLOSE AND SPECIALLY LIKE 
THE ACTIVE OPEN SPACE THIS IS

SHOWING THREE TIMES MORE BIKE

I THINK THAT'S AWESOME BUT JUST 
TO BE CLEAR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO

I THINK THAT'S AWESOME BUT JUST 
TO BE CLEAR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO  
HAVE THAT MUCH BIKE LIKE SOME   

03:07:03.323 --> 03:07:04.156
TO BE CLEAR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO  
HAVE THAT MUCH BIKE LIKE SOME   
IF WE REZONE IT IN THE FUTURE

HAVE THAT MUCH BIKE LIKE SOME   
IF WE REZONE IT IN THE FUTURE   
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO

AND HEADLIGHTS WOULD BE         
FLASHING INTO PEOPLE'S YARDS    
ORIGINAL CURB CUT AND I CAN SEE

FLASHING INTO PEOPLE'S YARDS    
ORIGINAL CURB CUT AND I CAN SEE 
THAT ON THIS MAP.               

03:14:19.727 --> 03:14:20.058
ORIGINAL CURB CUT AND I CAN SEE 
THAT ON THIS MAP.               
YEAH.                           

03:14:20.060 --> 03:14:22.527
THAT ON THIS MAP.               
YEAH.                           
WAS WAS LOCAL AND THIS WAS PART 

03:14:22.529 --> 03:14:26.097
YEAH.                           
WAS WAS LOCAL AND THIS WAS PART 
OF THE PLAN WAS LOCATED I THINK 

03:14:26.099 --> 03:14:26.632
WAS WAS LOCAL AND THIS WAS PART 
OF THE PLAN WAS LOCATED I THINK 
FURTHER TO THE NORTH.           

03:14:26.634 --> 03:14:30.302
OF THE PLAN WAS LOCATED I THINK 
FURTHER TO THE NORTH.           
OK, AND WE WANTED TO MOVE IT SO 

03:14:30.304 --> 03:14:33.872
FURTHER TO THE NORTH.           
OK, AND WE WANTED TO MOVE IT SO 
THAT IT WAS NOT ON THE CURVE    

03:14:33.874 --> 03:14:34.539
OK, AND WE WANTED TO MOVE IT SO 
THAT IT WAS NOT ON THE CURVE    
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WE         

03:14:34.541 --> 03:14:35.407
THAT IT WAS NOT ON THE CURVE    
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WE         
DEFINITELY WANTED TO MOVE A     

03:14:35.409 --> 03:14:40.078
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WE         
DEFINITELY WANTED TO MOVE A     
LITTLE SOUTH WHEREAS A CURB     

03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:40.679
DEFINITELY WANTED TO MOVE A     
LITTLE SOUTH WHEREAS A CURB     
CUTS YOUR RIGHT HAND.           

03:14:40.681 --> 03:14:41.413
LITTLE SOUTH WHEREAS A CURB     
CUTS YOUR RIGHT HAND.           
IT'S THE PROPOSED ONES RIGHT    

03:14:41.415 --> 03:14:41.746
CUTS YOUR RIGHT HAND.           
IT'S THE PROPOSED ONES RIGHT    
THERE.                          

03:14:41.748 --> 03:14:44.249
IT'S THE PROPOSED ONES RIGHT    
THERE.                          
SO A PROPOSED ONE IS REALLY     

03:14:44.251 --> 03:14:44.916
THERE.                          
SO A PROPOSED ONE IS REALLY     
WHERE THE BUILDING STARTS TO    

03:14:44.918 --> 03:14:48.319
SO A PROPOSED ONE IS REALLY     
WHERE THE BUILDING STARTS TO    
ANGLE AND AS A RESULT MOST      

03:14:48.321 --> 03:14:50.455
WHERE THE BUILDING STARTS TO    
ANGLE AND AS A RESULT MOST      
OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO ARE        

03:14:50.457 --> 03:14:51.256
ANGLE AND AS A RESULT MOST      
OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO ARE        
DIRECTLY IN THE CONDOMINIUM ARE 

03:14:51.258 --> 03:14:54.859
OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO ARE        
DIRECTLY IN THE CONDOMINIUM ARE 
MORE ALONG THE LONG SIDE OF THE 

03:14:54.861 --> 03:14:55.427
DIRECTLY IN THE CONDOMINIUM ARE 
MORE ALONG THE LONG SIDE OF THE 
BACK OF THE BUILDING.           

03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:56.562
MORE ALONG THE LONG SIDE OF THE 
BACK OF THE BUILDING.           
AND I THINK THE WAY THE CARS    

03:14:56.564 --> 03:14:59.097
BACK OF THE BUILDING.           
AND I THINK THE WAY THE CARS    
COME OUT WOULD BE POINTED MORE  

03:14:59.099 --> 03:14:59.898
AND I THINK THE WAY THE CARS    
COME OUT WOULD BE POINTED MORE  
TOWARDS WHERE THE ENTRANCE TO   

03:14:59.900 --> 03:15:06.404
COME OUT WOULD BE POINTED MORE  
TOWARDS WHERE THE ENTRANCE TO   
THE PARK IS THAN TO THE TO      

03:15:06.406 --> 03:15:10.409
TOWARDS WHERE THE ENTRANCE TO

WRESTLING ROAD.                 

03:24:20.593 --> 03:24:22.526
THEY'RE GOING TO COME OFF OF AN 
WRESTLING ROAD.                 
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BY THAT

WRESTLING ROAD.                 
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BY THAT   
SHOPPING CENTER ENTRANCE SO THE 

03:24:23.263 --> 03:24:26.697

SHOPPING CENTER ENTRANCE SO THE 
BUILDING IS ORIENTED IN THAT    

03:24:26.699 --> 03:24:30.367
SHOPPING CENTER ENTRANCE SO THE 
BUILDING IS ORIENTED IN THAT    
DIRECTION IN PART FOR THE LIGHT 

03:24:30.369 --> 03:24:31.035
BUILDING IS ORIENTED IN THAT    
DIRECTION IN PART FOR THE LIGHT 
THE SUNLIGHT THAT COMES FROM    

03:24:31.037 --> 03:24:31.836
DIRECTION IN PART FOR THE LIGHT 
THE SUNLIGHT THAT COMES FROM    
THE WEST WHICH IS PREDOMINANT   

03:24:31.838 --> 03:24:34.839
THE SUNLIGHT THAT COMES FROM    
THE WEST WHICH IS PREDOMINANT   
BUT ALSO FROM THE APPROACH FROM 

03:24:34.841 --> 03:24:35.440
THE WEST WHICH IS PREDOMINANT   
BUT ALSO FROM THE APPROACH FROM 
AN OBVIOUSLY WHERE SOMEONE      

03:24:35.442 --> 03:24:37.208
BUT ALSO FROM THE APPROACH FROM 
AN OBVIOUSLY WHERE SOMEONE      
WHO'S NOT A RESIDENT IS GOING   

03:24:37.210 --> 03:24:37.608
AN OBVIOUSLY WHERE SOMEONE

03:24:38.778 --> 03:24:42.013
TO ENTER.                       
SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE THAT WAY.  
WE HAVE THE GARAGE ORIENTED TO

SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE THAT WAY.  
WE HAVE THE GARAGE ORIENTED TO

03:24:42.749 --> 03:24:45.550
WE HAVE THE GARAGE ORIENTED TO  
OPEN BECAUSE WE WANT TO SPREAD  
OUT THAT TRAFFIC.               

03:24:45.552 --> 03:24:46.351
OPEN BECAUSE WE WANT TO SPREAD  
OUT THAT TRAFFIC.               
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO    

03:24:46.353 --> 03:24:49.487
OUT THAT TRAFFIC.               
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO    
ADD TO THE CONGESTION OF THE    

03:24:49.489 --> 03:24:50.188
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO    
ADD TO THE CONGESTION OF THE    
SHOPPING CENTER TRAFFIC BY      

03:24:50.190 --> 03:24:51.055
ADD TO THE CONGESTION OF THE    
SHOPPING CENTER TRAFFIC BY      
PUTTING THE RESIDENT TRAFFIC IN

APARTMENT BUILDING KNOWING IT'S 
OLD TECHNOLOGY.                 
THEY LIKE THE IDEA THAT IT'S

BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS         
PROPOSAL AND ONE OF THE THINGS  

03:27:01.654 --> 03:27:05.223
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS         
PROPOSAL AND ONE OF THE THINGS  
IN THE ZIBA NEIGHBOR SAID THIS  

03:27:05.225 --> 03:27:08.693
PROPOSAL AND ONE OF THE THINGS  
IN THE ZIBA NEIGHBOR SAID THIS  
AREA IS A WALKER'S PARADISE AND 

03:27:08.695 --> 03:27:09.927
IN THE ZIBA NEIGHBOR SAID THIS  
AREA IS A WALKER'S PARADISE AND 
TO ME THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE A   

03:27:09.929 --> 03:27:12.963
AREA IS A WALKER'S PARADISE AND 
TO ME THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE A   
WALKER'S PARADISE WITH TWO      

03:27:12.965 --> 03:27:13.664
TO ME THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE A   
WALKER'S PARADISE WITH TWO      
GROCERY STORES WITHIN WALKING   

03:27:13.666 --> 03:27:17.201
WALKER'S PARADISE WITH TWO      
GROCERY STORES WITHIN WALKING   
DISTANCE WHICH JUST IS THE ONLY 

03:27:17.203 --> 03:27:20.672
GROCERY STORES WITHIN WALKING   
DISTANCE WHICH JUST IS THE ONLY 
PLACE REALLY IN TOWN THAT HAS

PLACE REALLY IN TOWN THAT HAS   
TWO GROCERY STORES WITHIN       

03:27:21.507 --> 03:27:24.509
PLACE REALLY IN TOWN THAT HAS   
TWO GROCERY STORES WITHIN       
WALKING DISTANCE, I I THINK     

03:27:24.511 --> 03:27:27.845
TWO GROCERY STORES WITHIN       
WALKING DISTANCE, I I THINK     
IT'S SORT OF IMPERATIVE FOR US  

03:27:27.847 --> 03:27:31.749
WALKING DISTANCE, I I THINK     
IT'S SORT OF IMPERATIVE FOR US  
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT WE    

03:27:31.751 --> 03:27:33.017
IT'S SORT OF IMPERATIVE FOR US  
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT WE    
CAN TO MAKE IT AN AREA WHERE    

03:27:33.019 --> 03:27:42.160
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT WE    
CAN TO MAKE IT AN AREA WHERE    
MORE PEOPLE CAN LIVE AND        

03:27:42.828 --> 03:27:45.963
                         YOU    
KNOW, EVERY BUILDING HAS PROS   
AND CONS.

KNOW, EVERY BUILDING HAS PROS   
AND CONS.                       
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE     

03:27:46.999 --> 03:27:47.732
AND CONS.                       
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE     
LEARNED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE 

03:27:47.734 --> 03:27:48.399
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE     
LEARNED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF BUILDINGS     

03:27:48.401 --> 03:27:50.335
LEARNED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF BUILDINGS     
THERE'S SIX STORY APARTMENT     

03:27:50.337 --> 03:27:51.102
I'VE HAD A LOT OF BUILDINGS     
THERE'S SIX STORY APARTMENT     
BUILDINGS DOWN THE STREET FROM  

03:27:51.104 --> 03:27:51.902
THERE'S SIX STORY APARTMENT     
BUILDINGS DOWN THE STREET FROM  
A FOUR STORY APARTMENT, THREE   

03:27:51.904 --> 03:27:54.304
BUILDINGS DOWN THE STREET FROM  
A FOUR STORY APARTMENT, THREE   
STORIES THE WHOLE THING         

03:27:54.306 --> 03:27:57.909
A FOUR STORY APARTMENT, THREE   
STORIES THE WHOLE THING         
CONSTRUCTION IS TERRIBLE.       

03:27:57.911 --> 03:27:58.842
STORIES THE WHOLE THING         
CONSTRUCTION IS TERRIBLE.       
I WON'T LIE ABOUT THAT AND      

03:27:58.844 --> 03:27:59.310
CONSTRUCTION IS TERRIBLE.       
I WON'T LIE ABOUT THAT AND      
THAT'S A PAIN.                  

03:27:59.312 --> 03:28:01.912
I WON'T LIE ABOUT THAT AND      
THAT'S A PAIN.                  
BUT ONCE THOSE BUILDINGS GET    

03:28:01.914 --> 03:28:02.713
THAT'S A PAIN.                  
BUT ONCE THOSE BUILDINGS GET    
BUILT, BIG APARTMENT BUILDINGS  

03:28:02.715 --> 03:28:03.414
BUT ONCE THOSE BUILDINGS GET    
BUILT, BIG APARTMENT BUILDINGS  
ARE ACTUALLY VERY QUIET AND     

03:28:03.416 --> 03:28:06.283
BUILT, BIG APARTMENT BUILDINGS  
ARE ACTUALLY VERY QUIET AND     
THEY PROTECT RESIDENTS BEHIND   

03:28:06.285 --> 03:28:09.753
ARE ACTUALLY VERY QUIET AND     
THEY PROTECT RESIDENTS BEHIND   
THEM FROM TRAFFIC NOISE AND     

03:28:09.755 --> 03:28:10.688
THEY PROTECT RESIDENTS BEHIND   
THEM FROM TRAFFIC NOISE AND     
THAT WAS AN UNEXPECTED BONUS    

03:28:10.690 --> 03:28:13.924
THEM FROM TRAFFIC NOISE AND     
THAT WAS AN UNEXPECTED BONUS    
FOR US WHEN WE HAD I LIVE SORT  

03:28:13.926 --> 03:28:17.094
THAT WAS AN UNEXPECTED BONUS    
FOR US WHEN WE HAD I LIVE SORT  
OF NEAR THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND 

03:28:17.096 --> 03:28:18.062
FOR US WHEN WE HAD I LIVE SORT  
OF NEAR THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND 
THEY PUT A FOUR STORY BUILDING  

03:28:18.064 --> 03:28:24.469
OF NEAR THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND 
THEY PUT A FOUR STORY BUILDING  
UP AND WE ACTUALLY              

03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:39.750
                   HEAR LESS    
TRAFFIC.                        
SO FROM THE TRAIN WE HEAR LESS  

03:28:39.752 --> 03:28:40.284
TRAFFIC.                        
SO FROM THE TRAIN WE HEAR LESS  
STREET TRAFFIC.                 

03:28:40.286 --> 03:28:40.985
SO FROM THE TRAIN WE HEAR LESS  
STREET TRAFFIC.                 
SO I THINK WELL IT CAN BE BAD   

03:28:40.987 --> 03:28:41.452
STREET TRAFFIC.                 
SO I THINK WELL IT CAN BE BAD   
IN SOME WAYS.                   

03:28:41.454 --> 03:28:42.320
SO I THINK WELL IT CAN BE BAD   
IN SOME WAYS.                   
I THINK THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO 

03:28:42.322 --> 03:28:43.187
IN SOME WAYS.                   
I THINK THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO 
THE AREAS BEHIND THIS BUILDING  

03:28:43.189 --> 03:28:43.854
I THINK THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO 
THE AREAS BEHIND THIS BUILDING  
ARE GOING TO BE THEY'RE GOING   

03:28:43.856 --> 03:28:44.655
THE AREAS BEHIND THIS BUILDING  
ARE GOING TO BE THEY'RE GOING   
TO FEEL VERY PROTECTED REALLY   

03:28:44.657 --> 03:28:45.689
ARE GOING TO BE THEY'RE GOING   
TO FEEL VERY PROTECTED REALLY   
FROM THE TRAFFIC OF AN          

03:28:45.691 --> 03:28:46.257
TO FEEL VERY PROTECTED REALLY   
FROM THE TRAFFIC OF AN          
OBVIOUSLY AND ROAD.             

03:28:46.259 --> 03:28:47.324
FROM THE TRAFFIC OF AN          
OBVIOUSLY AND ROAD.             
I DO THINK THAT THE FACT THAT   

03:28:47.326 --> 03:28:48.092
OBVIOUSLY AND ROAD.             
I DO THINK THAT THE FACT THAT   
WE HAVE A DEVELOPER WHO'S       

03:28:48.094 --> 03:28:51.829
I DO THINK THAT THE FACT THAT   
WE HAVE A DEVELOPER WHO'S       
WILLING TO PUT IN A TRAFFIC     

03:28:51.831 --> 03:28:52.630
WE HAVE A DEVELOPER WHO'S       
WILLING TO PUT IN A TRAFFIC     
LIGHT TRAFFIC LIGHTS ARE VERY   

03:28:52.632 --> 03:28:55.767
WILLING TO PUT IN A TRAFFIC     
LIGHT TRAFFIC LIGHTS ARE VERY   
EXPENSIVE AND THE FACT THAT WE  

03:28:55.769 --> 03:28:56.567
LIGHT TRAFFIC LIGHTS ARE VERY   
EXPENSIVE AND THE FACT THAT WE  
COULD MAYBE ACTUALLY GET A      

03:28:56.569 --> 03:28:59.937
EXPENSIVE AND THE FACT THAT WE  
COULD MAYBE ACTUALLY GET A      
FAULTY TRAFFIC LIGHT NOT JUST A 

03:28:59.939 --> 03:29:00.738
COULD MAYBE ACTUALLY GET A      
FAULTY TRAFFIC LIGHT NOT JUST A 
CROSSWALK WHICH I THINK WOULD   

03:29:00.740 --> 03:29:03.808
FAULTY TRAFFIC LIGHT NOT JUST A 
CROSSWALK WHICH I THINK WOULD   
BE SCARY HERE DEFINITELY JUST A 

03:29:03.810 --> 03:29:07.211
CROSSWALK WHICH I THINK WOULD   
BE SCARY HERE DEFINITELY JUST A 
PLAIN DRESS CROSSWALK.          

03:29:07.213 --> 03:29:08.212
BE SCARY HERE DEFINITELY JUST A 
PLAIN DRESS CROSSWALK.          
I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT.    

03:29:08.214 --> 03:29:11.181
PLAIN DRESS CROSSWALK.          
I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT.    
I HOPE THE TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT 

03:29:11.183 --> 03:29:14.385
I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT.    
I HOPE THE TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT 
ACCEPTS THAT.                   

03:29:14.387 --> 03:29:15.186
I HOPE THE TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT 
ACCEPTS THAT.                   
I THINK THE STORMWATER IS       

03:29:15.188 --> 03:29:18.255
ACCEPTS THAT.                   
I THINK THE STORMWATER IS       
PROBABLY GOING TO BE BETTER.    

03:29:18.257 --> 03:29:22.626
I THINK THE STORMWATER IS       
PROBABLY GOING TO BE BETTER.

ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT POINTS.  

03:34:53.559 --> 03:34:56.927
AND SO YEAH, YOU'RE LOOKING AT  
ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT POINTS.  
SO I SAW ONE COMMENT ABOUT THAT 

03:34:56.929 --> 03:34:58.095
ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT POINTS.  
SO I SAW ONE COMMENT ABOUT THAT 
FOR AND THIS IS WHY HEAT PUMPS  

03:34:58.097 --> 03:35:01.665
SO I SAW ONE COMMENT ABOUT THAT 
FOR AND THIS IS WHY HEAT PUMPS  
MAKES SENSE THE MODERN HEAT     

03:35:01.667 --> 03:35:02.600
FOR AND THIS IS WHY HEAT PUMPS  
MAKES SENSE THE MODERN HEAT     
PUMPS IF YOU HAVE A GAS FURNACE 

03:35:02.602 --> 03:35:05.602
MAKES SENSE THE MODERN HEAT     
PUMPS IF YOU HAVE A GAS FURNACE 
EVEN IF IT'S NINETY FIVE

PERCENT IT TAKES A BTU          
OF ENERGY AND A GAS FURNACE TO  
CREATE ONE BTU OF HEAT THE      

03:35:12.177 --> 03:35:13.009
OF ENERGY AND A GAS FURNACE TO  
CREATE ONE BTU OF HEAT THE      
MODERATE HEAT PUMPS ASSUMING    

03:35:13.011 --> 03:35:16.513
CREATE ONE BTU OF HEAT THE      
MODERATE HEAT PUMPS ASSUMING    
YOU'RE NOT BELOW THE ZERO

DELIVER THREE BTUS OF HEAT FOR  
EVERY ONE BTU OF ELECTRICAL     
INPUT THEY ARE B THEIR NATURE   

03:35:24.824 --> 03:35:28.625
EVERY ONE BTU OF ELECTRICAL     
INPUT THEY ARE B THEIR NATURE   
MORE EFFICIENT IN GAS AND IF    

03:35:28.627 --> 03:35:29.426
INPUT THEY ARE B THEIR NATURE   
MORE EFFICIENT IN GAS AND IF    
YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE PROPER 

03:35:29.428 --> 03:35:31.761
MORE EFFICIENT IN GAS AND IF    
YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE PROPER 
BUILDING ENVELOPE IT MAKES IT   

03:35:31.763 --> 03:35:35.332
YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE PROPER 
BUILDING ENVELOPE IT MAKES IT   
ONLY MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT.    

03:35:35.334 --> 03:35:36.333
BUILDING ENVELOPE IT MAKES IT   
ONLY MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT.    
I MEAN THE ECONOMIES ARE THERE  

03:35:36.335 --> 03:35:39.070
ONLY MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT.    
I MEAN THE ECONOMIES ARE THERE  
THERE'S ONLY REALLY TWO MONTHS  

03:35:39.072 --> 03:35:40.170
I MEAN THE ECONOMIES ARE THERE  
THERE'S ONLY REALLY TWO MONTHS  
OF THE YEAR WHERE IT'S A        

03:35:40.172 --> 03:35:45.976
THERE'S ONLY REALLY TWO MONTHS  
OF THE YEAR WHERE IT'S A        
CHALLENGE AND IN THE SUMMER     

03:35:45.978 --> 03:35:46.844
OF THE YEAR WHERE IT'S A        
CHALLENGE AND IN THE SUMMER     
THEY'RE MORE EFFICIENT AT       

03:35:46.846 --> 03:35:47.577
CHALLENGE AND IN THE SUMMER     
THEY'RE MORE EFFICIENT AT       
COOLING BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST

SOMEWHERE.                      
>> WELL, I DON'T LIKE PUTTING   
STUFF IN WRITING BUT BUT I WILL 

03:37:34.286 --> 03:37:36.653
>> WELL, I DON'T LIKE PUTTING   
STUFF IN WRITING BUT BUT I WILL 
TELL YOU THAT THE ENERGY STAR   

03:37:36.655 --> 03:37:40.490
STUFF IN WRITING BUT BUT I WILL 
TELL YOU THAT THE ENERGY STAR   
CRITERIA DEMANDS MORE THAN JUST 

03:37:40.492 --> 03:37:41.225
TELL YOU THAT THE ENERGY STAR   
CRITERIA DEMANDS MORE THAN JUST 
EFFICIENCY DEMANDS INDOOR AIR   

03:37:41.227 --> 03:37:45.061
CRITERIA DEMANDS MORE THAN JUST 
EFFICIENCY DEMANDS INDOOR AIR   
QUALITY AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL. 

03:37:45.063 --> 03:37:45.563
EFFICIENCY DEMANDS INDOOR AIR   
QUALITY AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL. 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE            

03:37:45.565 --> 03:37:48.632
QUALITY AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL. 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE            
UNATTRACTIVE THAN WALKING DOWN  

03:37:48.634 --> 03:37:49.532
THERE'S NOTHING MORE            
UNATTRACTIVE THAN WALKING DOWN  
A HALLWAY IN AN APARTMENT       

03:37:49.534 --> 03:37:52.736
UNATTRACTIVE THAN WALKING DOWN  
A HALLWAY IN AN APARTMENT       
COMPLEX AND SMELLING EVERYTHING 

03:37:52.738 --> 03:37:53.436
A HALLWAY IN AN APARTMENT       
COMPLEX AND SMELLING EVERYTHING 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO AIR          

03:37:53.438 --> 03:37:53.803
COMPLEX AND SMELLING EVERYTHING 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO AIR          
TURNOVER.                       

03:37:53.805 --> 03:37:57.207
BECAUSE THERE'S NO AIR          
TURNOVER.                       
SO HOW DO WE ACHIEVE HIGH       

03:37:57.209 --> 03:37:59.910
TURNOVER.                       
SO HOW DO WE ACHIEVE HIGH       
INDOOR AIR QUALITY WHICH I      

03:37:59.912 --> 03:38:00.710
SO HOW DO WE ACHIEVE HIGH       
INDOOR AIR QUALITY WHICH I      
THINK IS ESSENTIAL FOR A        

03:38:00.712 --> 03:38:01.445
INDOOR AIR QUALITY WHICH I      
THINK IS ESSENTIAL FOR A        
PROJECT LIKE THIS IF NO ONE'S   

03:38:01.447 --> 03:38:04.214
THINK IS ESSENTIAL FOR A        
PROJECT LIKE THIS IF NO ONE'S   
GOING TO COME LIVE FOR TWO      

03:38:04.216 --> 03:38:07.551
PROJECT LIKE THIS IF NO ONE'S   
GOING TO COME LIVE FOR TWO      
YEARS AND STAY THERE BEYOND TWO 

03:38:07.553 --> 03:38:08.885
GOING TO COME LIVE FOR TWO      
YEARS AND STAY THERE BEYOND TWO 
YEARS, IF IT'S SMELLY, IF IT'S  

03:38:08.887 --> 03:38:12.155
YEARS AND STAY THERE BEYOND TWO 
YEARS, IF IT'S SMELLY, IF IT'S  
STALE I'VE WALKED THROUGH SO    

03:38:12.157 --> 03:38:13.023
YEARS, IF IT'S SMELLY, IF IT'S  
STALE I'VE WALKED THROUGH SO    
MANY OF THESE TYPE OF BUILDINGS 

03:38:13.025 --> 03:38:14.724
STALE I'VE WALKED THROUGH SO    
MANY OF THESE TYPE OF BUILDINGS 
AND JUST BEEN TURNED OFF BY THE 

03:38:14.726 --> 03:38:15.092
MANY OF THESE TYPE OF BUILDINGS 
AND JUST BEEN TURNED OFF BY THE 
AIR QUALITY.                    

03:38:15.094 --> 03:38:16.293
AND JUST BEEN TURNED OFF BY THE 
AIR QUALITY.                    
SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS  

03:38:16.295 --> 03:38:19.229
AIR QUALITY.                    
SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS  
WE'RE GOING TO INSTALL IRV'S    

03:38:19.231 --> 03:38:22.666
SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS  
WE'RE GOING TO INSTALL IRV'S    
WHICH ARE THE ENERGY            

03:38:22.668 --> 03:38:23.200
WE'RE GOING TO INSTALL IRV'S    
WHICH ARE THE ENERGY            
RECOVERY VENTILATOR'S.          

03:38:23.202 --> 03:38:26.937
WHICH ARE THE ENERGY            
RECOVERY VENTILATOR'S.          
THIS ADDS TO THE SUSTAINABILITY 

03:38:26.939 --> 03:38:27.905
RECOVERY VENTILATOR'S.          
THIS ADDS TO THE SUSTAINABILITY 
OF IT BUT IT ALSO PROMOTES A    

03:38:27.907 --> 03:38:31.175
THIS ADDS TO THE SUSTAINABILITY 
OF IT BUT IT ALSO PROMOTES A    
VERY, VERY HIGH AMOUNT OF AIR   

03:38:31.177 --> 03:38:31.642
OF IT BUT IT ALSO PROMOTES A    
VERY, VERY HIGH AMOUNT OF AIR   
TURNOVER.                       

03:38:31.644 --> 03:38:34.645
VERY, VERY HIGH AMOUNT OF AIR   
TURNOVER.                       
SO YOU'RE GETTING FRESH AIR     

03:38:34.647 --> 03:38:35.446
TURNOVER.                       
SO YOU'RE GETTING FRESH AIR     
CONDITIONED TO THE TEMPERATURE  

03:38:35.448 --> 03:38:39.282
SO YOU'RE GETTING FRESH AIR     
CONDITIONED TO THE TEMPERATURE  
OF THE AMBIENT AIR INSIDE THE   

03:38:39.284 --> 03:38:45.923
CONDITIONED TO THE TEMPERATURE  
OF THE AMBIENT AIR INSIDE THE   
UNIT THROUGH THE R.V. UNIT      

03:38:59.771 --> 03:39:01.905
                           AND  
SO YOU'RE RECAPTURING BASICALLY 
SOME THAT HEAT OR COOLING AND   

03:39:01.907 --> 03:39:02.706
SO YOU'RE RECAPTURING BASICALLY 
SOME THAT HEAT OR COOLING AND   
MOISTURE CONTROL THAT THAT      

03:39:02.708 --> 03:39:03.506
SOME THAT HEAT OR COOLING AND   
MOISTURE CONTROL THAT THAT      
WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST WHEN    

03:39:03.508 --> 03:39:04.241
MOISTURE CONTROL THAT THAT      
WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST WHEN    
YOU TRY AND HAVE A TURNOVER SO  

03:39:04.243 --> 03:39:04.974
WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST WHEN    
YOU TRY AND HAVE A TURNOVER SO  
WE CAN BUILD A TYPE BUILDING    

03:39:04.976 --> 03:39:05.642
YOU TRY AND HAVE A TURNOVER SO  
WE CAN BUILD A TYPE BUILDING    
ENVELOPE ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE     

03:39:05.644 --> 03:39:06.309
WE CAN BUILD A TYPE BUILDING    
ENVELOPE ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE     
GOING TO PUT IRV'S IN AND       

03:39:06.311 --> 03:39:06.910
ENVELOPE ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE     
GOING TO PUT IRV'S IN AND       
THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER THE

GOING TO PUT IRV'S IN AND       
THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER THE       
ENERGY STAR STANDARD AGAIN, YOU

ABLE TO MAKE THIS AS            
SUSTAINABLE BY THINKING ABOUT   
ENERGY EFFICIENCY FIRST         

03:39:33.105 --> 03:39:33.970
SUSTAINABLE BY THINKING ABOUT   
ENERGY EFFICIENCY FIRST         
THINKING ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY  

03:39:33.972 --> 03:39:36.940
ENERGY EFFICIENCY FIRST         
THINKING ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY  
AND THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU 

03:39:36.942 --> 03:39:41.010
THINKING ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY  
AND THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU 
CAN HEAT IT AND PROVIDE         

03:39:41.012 --> 03:39:41.945
AND THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU 
CAN HEAT IT AND PROVIDE         
ESSENTIAL SAFETY, I THINK THAT  

03:39:41.947 --> 03:39:42.546
CAN HEAT IT AND PROVIDE         
ESSENTIAL SAFETY, I THINK THAT  
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

THING.                          

04:22:22.672 --> 04:22:23.338
>> SO THAT IS AN UNFORTUNATE    
THING.                          
THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS.       

04:22:23.340 --> 04:22:26.073
THING.                          
THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS.       
WE'RE DOING A YOU KNOW, A       

04:22:26.075 --> 04:22:26.774
THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS.

KNOW, AND SO I THINK THERE IS A 
CALL TO SAY WHAT ARE THE        

04:22:30.746 --> 04:22:33.447

CALL TO SAY WHAT ARE THE        
NUISANCE STANDARDS AND HOW CAN  

04:22:33.449 --> 04:22:37.218
CALL TO SAY WHAT ARE THE        
NUISANCE STANDARDS AND HOW CAN  
THEY HELP BUFFER A ESSENTIALLY, 

04:22:37.220 --> 04:22:38.285
NUISANCE STANDARDS AND HOW CAN  
THEY HELP BUFFER A ESSENTIALLY, 
YOU KNOW, BUFFER OR HARMONIZE   

04:22:38.287 --> 04:22:41.689
THEY HELP BUFFER A ESSENTIALLY, 
YOU KNOW, BUFFER OR HARMONIZE   
BECAUSE WE WANT MIXED USE.      

04:22:41.691 --> 04:22:42.556
YOU KNOW, BUFFER OR HARMONIZE   
BECAUSE WE WANT MIXED USE.      
WE WANT SERVICES IN             

04:22:42.558 --> 04:22:44.525
BECAUSE WE WANT MIXED USE.      
WE WANT SERVICES IN             
NEIGHBORHOODS PROBABLY WE DON'T 

04:22:44.527 --> 04:22:51.098
WE WANT SERVICES IN             
NEIGHBORHOODS PROBABLY WE DON'T 
WANT YOUR SARACENO.             

04:22:51.100 --> 04:22:51.498
NEIGHBORHOODS PROBABLY WE DON'T 
WANT YOUR SARACENO.             
RIGHT.

WANT YOUR SARACENO.             
RIGHT.

04:22:55.171 --> 04:22:56.237
RIGHT.                          
SO IT I BELIEVE THAT ALL        
OF THIS IS IN THE MIX AND IT IS 

04:22:56.239 --> 04:22:59.240
SO IT I BELIEVE THAT ALL        
OF THIS IS IN THE MIX AND IT IS 
SIMPLY A IT IS AN ISSUE THAT    

04:22:59.242 --> 04:22:59.907
OF THIS IS IN THE MIX AND IT IS 
SIMPLY A IT IS AN ISSUE THAT    
PEOPLE WANT SPECIFICITY.        

04:22:59.909 --> 04:23:00.642
SIMPLY A IT IS AN ISSUE THAT    
PEOPLE WANT SPECIFICITY.        
THEY WANT MORE SPECIFICITY THAN 

04:23:00.644 --> 04:23:02.911
PEOPLE WANT SPECIFICITY.        
THEY WANT MORE SPECIFICITY THAN 
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM AND        

04:23:02.913 --> 04:23:06.147
THEY WANT MORE SPECIFICITY THAN 
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM AND        
THEY'RE YOU KNOW, WE HEARD      

04:23:06.149 --> 04:23:06.880
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM AND        
THEY'RE YOU KNOW, WE HEARD      
EIGHT STORIES EQUATED WITH      

04:23:06.882 --> 04:23:10.351
THEY'RE YOU KNOW, WE HEARD      
EIGHT STORIES EQUATED WITH      
TRANSITION AND WE HEARD THREE   

04:23:10.353 --> 04:23:11.151
EIGHT STORIES EQUATED WITH      
TRANSITION AND WE HEARD THREE   
STORIES EQUATED WITH TRANSITION 

04:23:11.153 --> 04:23:11.819
TRANSITION AND WE HEARD THREE   
STORIES EQUATED WITH TRANSITION 
AND THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT AND  

04:23:11.821 --> 04:23:15.789
STORIES EQUATED WITH TRANSITION 
AND THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT AND  
I BELIEVE THAT BOTH OF THOSE    

04:23:15.791 --> 04:23:16.623
AND THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT AND  
I BELIEVE THAT BOTH OF THOSE    
THINGS ARE TRUE BUT IT DEPENDS  

04:23:16.625 --> 04:23:19.660
I BELIEVE THAT BOTH OF THOSE    
THINGS ARE TRUE BUT IT DEPENDS  
ON WHETHER YOU ARE IMAGINING    

04:23:19.662 --> 04:23:20.328
THINGS ARE TRUE BUT IT DEPENDS  
ON WHETHER YOU ARE IMAGINING    
THE WORST THING THAT COULD      

04:23:20.330 --> 04:23:23.197
ON WHETHER YOU ARE IMAGINING    
THE WORST THING THAT COULD      
HAPPEN TO YOU OR YOU ARE        

04:23:23.199 --> 04:23:27.001
THE WORST THING THAT COULD      
HAPPEN TO YOU OR YOU ARE        
RECOGNIZING WHAT THE PLAN IS    

04:23:27.003 --> 04:23:27.435
HAPPEN TO YOU OR YOU ARE        
RECOGNIZING WHAT THE PLAN IS    
TRYING TO SAY.                  

04:23:27.437 --> 04:23:30.604
RECOGNIZING WHAT THE PLAN IS    
TRYING TO SAY.                  
AND I THOUGHT THAT MEDLOW PUT   

04:23:30.606 --> 04:23:34.274
TRYING TO SAY.                  
AND I THOUGHT THAT MEDLOW PUT   
IT REALLY WELL WHEN THEY WERE   

04:23:34.276 --> 04:23:34.943
AND I THOUGHT THAT MEDLOW PUT   
IT REALLY WELL WHEN THEY WERE   
EXPLAINING THAT PEOPLE ARE      

04:23:34.945 --> 04:23:38.346
IT REALLY WELL WHEN THEY WERE   
EXPLAINING THAT PEOPLE ARE      
WANTING TO PUT HARD AND FAST    

04:23:38.348 --> 04:23:39.079
EXPLAINING THAT PEOPLE ARE      
WANTING TO PUT HARD AND FAST    
BARRIERS AROUND THESE THINGS    

04:23:39.081 --> 04:23:42.684
WANTING TO PUT HARD AND FAST    
BARRIERS AROUND THESE THINGS    
AND THE WAY OUR PLAN IS WORKING 

04:23:42.686 --> 04:23:43.484
BARRIERS AROUND THESE THINGS    
AND THE WAY OUR PLAN IS WORKING 
BECAUSE IT'S TRYING TO SIMPLIFY 

04:23:43.486 --> 04:23:46.253
AND THE WAY OUR PLAN IS WORKING 
BECAUSE IT'S TRYING TO SIMPLIFY 
THE CATEGORIES IS THAT THINGS   

04:23:46.255 --> 04:23:47.254
BECAUSE IT'S TRYING TO SIMPLIFY 
THE CATEGORIES IS THAT THINGS   
ARE ON A CONTINUUM AND SO       

04:23:47.256 --> 04:23:50.658
THE CATEGORIES IS THAT THINGS   
ARE ON A CONTINUUM AND SO       
THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF RIGHT IN 

04:23:50.660 --> 04:23:51.525
ARE ON A CONTINUUM AND SO       
THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF RIGHT IN 
TRANSITION AND A CONTINUUM      

04:23:51.527 --> 04:23:54.562
THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF RIGHT IN 
TRANSITION AND A CONTINUUM      
OF INTENSITY OF OF WHATEVER     

04:23:54.564 --> 04:23:55.363
TRANSITION AND A CONTINUUM      
OF INTENSITY OF OF WHATEVER     
INDUSTRIAL WHATEVER THAT MEANS  

04:23:55.365 --> 04:23:58.665
OF INTENSITY OF OF WHATEVER     
INDUSTRIAL WHATEVER THAT MEANS  
INDUSTRIAL USE.                 

04:23:58.667 --> 04:23:59.066
INDUSTRIAL WHATEVER THAT MEANS  
INDUSTRIAL USE.                 
YEAH.                           

04:23:59.068 --> 04:23:59.867
INDUSTRIAL USE.                 
YEAH.                           
SO I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING   

04:23:59.869 --> 04:24:02.236
YEAH.                           
SO I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING   
IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR      

04:24:02.238 --> 04:24:02.704
SO I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING   
IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR      
CURRENT LAND USE                

04:24:02.706 --> 04:24:05.539
IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR      
CURRENT LAND USE                
CLASSIFICATIONS, WE LOOK AT     

04:24:05.541 --> 04:24:06.273
CURRENT LAND USE                
CLASSIFICATIONS, WE LOOK AT     
WHERE THE WORD TRANSITION IS    

04:24:06.275 --> 04:24:07.075
CLASSIFICATIONS, WE LOOK AT     
WHERE THE WORD TRANSITION IS    
USED IS I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY   

04:24:07.077 --> 04:24:09.676
WHERE THE WORD TRANSITION IS    
USED IS I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY   
AN OFFICE OFFICE IS CONSIDERED  

04:24:09.678 --> 04:24:10.411
USED IS I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY   
AN OFFICE OFFICE IS CONSIDERED  
THE TRANSITION DISTRICT AND     

04:24:10.413 --> 04:24:13.815
AN OFFICE OFFICE IS CONSIDERED  
THE TRANSITION DISTRICT AND     
PARKING IS A BUFFER LIKE I      

04:24:13.817 --> 04:24:14.515
THE TRANSITION DISTRICT AND     
PARKING IS A BUFFER LIKE I      
THINK THAT LITERAL I THINK      

04:24:14.517 --> 04:24:17.284
PARKING IS A BUFFER LIKE I      
THINK THAT LITERAL I THINK      
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN OUR      

04:24:17.286 --> 04:24:18.085
THINK THAT LITERAL I THINK      
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN OUR      
STANDARDS DOCUMENT THAT YOU'VE  

04:24:18.087 --> 04:24:21.455
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN OUR      
STANDARDS DOCUMENT THAT YOU'VE  
GOT INDUSTRIAL OR FLEX LIGHT    

04:24:21.457 --> 04:24:22.356
STANDARDS DOCUMENT THAT YOU'VE  
GOT INDUSTRIAL OR FLEX LIGHT    
AND ONE LIGHT INDUSTRIAL YOU    

04:24:22.358 --> 04:24:25.826
GOT INDUSTRIAL OR FLEX LIGHT    
AND ONE LIGHT INDUSTRIAL YOU    
GOT OFFICES OF TRANSITION AND   

04:24:25.828 --> 04:24:26.594
AND ONE LIGHT INDUSTRIAL YOU    
GOT OFFICES OF TRANSITION AND   
THEN YOU GOT RISING AND SO      

04:24:26.596 --> 04:24:29.396
GOT OFFICES OF TRANSITION AND   
THEN YOU GOT RISING AND SO      
ACTUALLY OFFICE DOESN'T ALLOW   

04:24:29.398 --> 04:24:30.398
THEN YOU GOT RISING AND SO      
ACTUALLY OFFICE DOESN'T ALLOW   
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE EVEN I THINK   

04:24:30.400 --> 04:24:31.132
ACTUALLY OFFICE DOESN'T ALLOW   
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE EVEN I THINK   
RETAIL I REMEMBER I WAS TRYING  

04:24:31.134 --> 04:24:33.601
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE EVEN I THINK   
RETAIL I REMEMBER I WAS TRYING  
TO DO A JEWELER FOR EXAMPLE IN  

04:24:33.603 --> 04:24:34.335
RETAIL I REMEMBER I WAS TRYING  
TO DO A JEWELER FOR EXAMPLE IN  
ONE OF THE OFFICE BUILDINGS AND 

04:24:34.337 --> 04:24:35.069
TO DO A JEWELER FOR EXAMPLE IN  
ONE OF THE OFFICE BUILDINGS AND 
THEY WERE LIKE NO, WE DON'T     

04:24:35.071 --> 04:24:36.770
ONE OF THE OFFICE BUILDINGS AND 
THEY WERE LIKE NO, WE DON'T     
WANT THAT MANY TRIPS.           

04:24:36.772 --> 04:24:37.171
THEY WERE LIKE NO, WE DON'T     
WANT THAT MANY TRIPS.           
RIGHT.                          

04:24:37.173 --> 04:24:38.139
WANT THAT MANY TRIPS.           
RIGHT.                          
WHICH IS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT 

04:24:38.141 --> 04:24:38.339
RIGHT.                          
WHICH IS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT 
AGAIN.                          

04:24:38.341 --> 04:24:41.309
WHICH IS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT 
AGAIN.                          
SO I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE'RE  

04:24:41.311 --> 04:24:41.909
AGAIN.                          
SO I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE'RE  
HAVING RIGHT NOW FROM MY        

04:24:41.911 --> 04:24:44.712
SO I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE'RE  
HAVING RIGHT NOW FROM MY        
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT IT'S A      

04:24:44.714 --> 04:24:45.446
HAVING RIGHT NOW FROM MY        
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT IT'S A      
COLLAPSING OF THE CATEGORIES    

04:24:45.448 --> 04:24:48.583
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT IT'S A      
COLLAPSING OF THE CATEGORIES    
OF WHAT TRANSITION EXACTLY.     

04:24:48.585 --> 04:24:49.583
COLLAPSING OF THE CATEGORIES    
OF WHAT TRANSITION EXACTLY.     
THE CLARIFICATION I COULD USE   

04:24:49.585 --> 04:24:52.553
OF WHAT TRANSITION EXACTLY.     
THE CLARIFICATION I COULD USE   
IS THIS NUMBER TEN.             

04:24:52.555 --> 04:24:53.821
THE CLARIFICATION I COULD USE   
IS THIS NUMBER TEN.             
I THINK IT COMES BACK TO YOUR   

04:24:53.823 --> 04:24:54.422
IS THIS NUMBER TEN.             
I THINK IT COMES BACK TO YOUR   
POINT CONDITIONALS WHICH WAS    

04:24:54.424 --> 04:24:55.890
I THINK IT COMES BACK TO YOUR   
POINT CONDITIONALS WHICH WAS

SO AND AND JUST THE INTENT

PROCESS AND CONCERN ABOUT       

04:53:44.852 --> 04:53:48.454
THERE WAS SOME TREPIDATION,     
PROCESS AND CONCERN ABOUT       
SIMPLY TAKING WIDE SWATHS       

04:53:48.456 --> 04:53:49.322
PROCESS AND CONCERN ABOUT       
SIMPLY TAKING WIDE SWATHS       
OF OUR THREE AND OUR FOUR       

04:53:49.324 --> 04:53:52.024
SIMPLY TAKING WIDE SWATHS       
OF OUR THREE AND OUR FOUR       
ZONING DISTRICTS AND PRESUMING  

04:53:52.026 --> 04:53:52.958
OF OUR THREE AND OUR FOUR       
ZONING DISTRICTS AND PRESUMING  
A TRANSITION DISTRICT WAS THE   

04:53:52.960 --> 04:53:56.428
ZONING DISTRICTS AND PRESUMING  
A TRANSITION DISTRICT WAS THE   
RIGHT THING FOR THOSE AS WELL.  

04:53:56.430 --> 04:53:57.497
A TRANSITION DISTRICT WAS THE   
RIGHT THING FOR THOSE AS WELL.  
I THINK SOME OF THAT IS SORT    

04:53:57.499 --> 04:54:00.199
RIGHT THING FOR THOSE AS WELL.  
I THINK SOME OF THAT IS SORT    
OF IN THE VEIN OF WHAT          

04:54:00.201 --> 04:54:00.900
I THINK SOME OF THAT IS SORT    
OF IN THE VEIN OF WHAT          
COMMISSIONER BUSH WAS TALKING   

04:54:00.902 --> 04:54:01.601
OF IN THE VEIN OF WHAT          
COMMISSIONER BUSH WAS TALKING   
ABOUT IS THE AMBIVALENCE OR     

04:54:01.603 --> 04:54:03.902
COMMISSIONER BUSH WAS TALKING   
ABOUT IS THE AMBIVALENCE OR     
UNCERTAINTY THAT PEOPLE HAVE    

04:54:03.904 --> 04:54:04.536
ABOUT IS THE AMBIVALENCE OR     
UNCERTAINTY THAT PEOPLE HAVE    
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.          

04:54:04.538 --> 04:54:05.271
UNCERTAINTY THAT PEOPLE HAVE    
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.          
I MEAN THREE STORIES DOESN'T    

04:54:05.273 --> 04:54:07.606
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.          
I MEAN THREE STORIES DOESN'T    
MEAN EIGHT STORIES AND HONESTLY 

04:54:07.608 --> 04:54:08.407
I MEAN THREE STORIES DOESN'T    
MEAN EIGHT STORIES AND HONESTLY 
I CAN'T SIT HERE AND TELL YOU   

04:54:08.409 --> 04:54:11.911
MEAN EIGHT STORIES AND HONESTLY 
I CAN'T SIT HERE AND TELL YOU   
THAT I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IN    

04:54:11.913 --> 04:54:12.578
I CAN'T SIT HERE AND TELL YOU   
THAT I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IN    
THOSE PROPERTIES UNTIL WE       

04:54:12.580 --> 04:54:13.312
THAT I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IN    
THOSE PROPERTIES UNTIL WE       
DEVELOP THE ZONING AROUND THAT  

04:54:13.314 --> 04:54:15.648
THOSE PROPERTIES UNTIL WE       
DEVELOP THE ZONING AROUND THAT  
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT  

04:54:15.650 --> 04:54:15.981
DEVELOP THE ZONING AROUND THAT  
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT  
MEANS.                          

04:54:15.983 --> 04:54:19.751
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT  
MEANS.                          
AND SO ONE WAY TO APPROACH THAT 

04:54:19.753 --> 04:54:23.088
MEANS.                          
AND SO ONE WAY TO APPROACH THAT 
WOULD BE TO ADVOCATE OR TO      

04:54:23.090 --> 04:54:23.956
AND SO ONE WAY TO APPROACH THAT 
WOULD BE TO ADVOCATE OR TO      
THINK ABOUT A CERTAIN ASPECT    

04:54:23.958 --> 04:54:24.624
WOULD BE TO ADVOCATE OR TO      
THINK ABOUT A CERTAIN ASPECT    
OF THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT     

04:54:24.626 --> 04:54:27.560
THINK ABOUT A CERTAIN ASPECT    
OF THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT     
THAT IS A MULTIPLE FRIENDLY     

04:54:27.562 --> 04:54:28.360
OF THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT     
THAT IS A MULTIPLE FRIENDLY     
DISTRICT THAT MIGHT PROVIDE     

04:54:28.362 --> 04:54:30.796
THAT IS A MULTIPLE FRIENDLY     
DISTRICT THAT MIGHT PROVIDE     
SOME FRANKLY MORE MAYBE         

04:54:30.798 --> 04:54:34.400
DISTRICT THAT MIGHT PROVIDE     
SOME FRANKLY MORE MAYBE         
SUBURBAN CATEGORIES             

04:54:34.402 --> 04:54:35.334
SOME FRANKLY MORE MAYBE         
SUBURBAN CATEGORIES             
OF RESIDENTIAL THAT WE HAVE IN  

04:54:35.336 --> 04:54:38.871
SUBURBAN CATEGORIES             
OF RESIDENTIAL THAT WE HAVE IN  
A LOT OF PLACES IN THE CITY.    

04:54:38.873 --> 04:54:39.738
OF RESIDENTIAL THAT WE HAVE IN  
A LOT OF PLACES IN THE CITY.    
THEY'RE NOT EIGHT STORIES BUT   

04:54:39.740 --> 04:54:41.106
A LOT OF PLACES IN THE CITY.    
THEY'RE NOT EIGHT STORIES BUT   
THEY ARE HIGHER THAN TRY POXES  

04:54:41.108 --> 04:54:45.377
THEY'RE NOT EIGHT STORIES BUT   
THEY ARE HIGHER THAN TRY POXES  
AND DENSITY.                    

04:54:45.379 --> 04:54:50.249
THEY ARE HIGHER THAN TRY POXES  
AND DENSITY.                    
SO THAT WAS ONE OPTION AND THEN 

04:54:50.251 --> 04:54:51.183
AND DENSITY.                    
SO THAT WAS ONE OPTION AND THEN 
WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT SIMILARLY 

04:54:51.185 --> 04:54:51.817
SO THAT WAS ONE OPTION AND THEN 
WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT SIMILARLY 
WITH THE TRANSITION LAND USE    

04:54:51.819 --> 04:54:53.619
WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT SIMILARLY 
WITH THE TRANSITION LAND USE    
CATEGORY APPROACHING THAT THAT  

04:54:53.621 --> 04:54:57.522
WITH THE TRANSITION LAND USE    
CATEGORY APPROACHING THAT THAT  
SEEMED LESS IDEAL TO US.        

04:54:57.524 --> 04:54:58.557
CATEGORY APPROACHING THAT THAT  
SEEMED LESS IDEAL TO US.        
THE TRANSITION CATEGORY SEEMS   

04:54:58.559 --> 04:55:01.861
SEEMED LESS IDEAL TO US.        
THE TRANSITION CATEGORY SEEMS   
WELL SUITED TO CAREER           

04:55:01.863 --> 04:55:02.595
THE TRANSITION CATEGORY SEEMS   
WELL SUITED TO CAREER           
DEVELOPMENT AND PARTICULARLY    

04:55:02.597 --> 04:55:03.262
WELL SUITED TO CAREER           
DEVELOPMENT AND PARTICULARLY    
SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE         

04:55:03.264 --> 04:55:05.531
DEVELOPMENT AND PARTICULARLY    
SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE         
STARTING TO GET SORT OF REMOVED 

04:55:05.533 --> 04:55:08.967
SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE         
STARTING TO GET SORT OF REMOVED 
FROM CAUSE SO IT SEEMS.         

04:55:08.969 --> 04:55:12.804
STARTING TO GET SORT OF REMOVED 
FROM CAUSE SO IT SEEMS.         
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, THE        

04:55:12.806 --> 04:55:13.739
FROM CAUSE SO IT SEEMS.         
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, THE        
RESIDENTIAL MIGHT BE A BETTER   

04:55:13.741 --> 04:55:16.976
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, THE        
RESIDENTIAL MIGHT BE A BETTER   
LABORATORY TO THINK ABOUT HOW   

04:55:16.978 --> 04:55:17.777
RESIDENTIAL MIGHT BE A BETTER   
LABORATORY TO THINK ABOUT HOW   
THEY WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE  

04:55:17.779 --> 04:55:24.416
LABORATORY TO THINK ABOUT HOW   
THEY WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE  
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WE PROVIDED A 

04:55:24.418 --> 04:55:25.284
THEY WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE  
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WE PROVIDED A 
COUPLE OPTIONS I LEAN TOWARDS   

04:55:25.286 --> 04:55:27.719
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WE PROVIDED A 
COUPLE OPTIONS I LEAN TOWARDS   
PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT A       

04:55:27.721 --> 04:55:28.654
COUPLE OPTIONS I LEAN TOWARDS   
PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT A       
TIERED OR SOME APPROACH TO THE  

04:55:28.656 --> 04:55:31.390
PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT A       
TIERED OR SOME APPROACH TO THE  
RESIDENTIAL LAND USE CATEGORY   

04:55:31.392 --> 04:55:32.058
TIERED OR SOME APPROACH TO THE  
RESIDENTIAL LAND USE CATEGORY   
THAT CREATES SOMETHING THAT     

04:55:32.060 --> 04:55:32.791
RESIDENTIAL LAND USE CATEGORY   
THAT CREATES SOMETHING THAT     
RESONATES WITH THE PLANNING     

04:55:32.793 --> 04:55:35.528
THAT CREATES SOMETHING THAT     
RESONATES WITH THE PLANNING     
COMMISSION.                     

04:55:35.530 --> 04:55:39.999
RESONATES WITH THE PLANNING     
COMMISSION.                     
BUT NONE OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE   

04:55:40.001 --> 04:55:43.236
COMMISSION.                     
BUT NONE OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE   
WRONG AND HONESTLY I WAS JUST   

04:55:43.238 --> 04:55:44.103
BUT NONE OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE   
WRONG AND HONESTLY I WAS JUST   
TRYING TO GIVE YOU SOME OPTIONS 

04:55:44.105 --> 04:55:47.240
WRONG AND HONESTLY I WAS JUST   
TRYING TO GIVE YOU SOME OPTIONS 
MAYBE IT MIGHT BE RESPONSIVE TO 

04:55:47.242 --> 04:55:48.040
TRYING TO GIVE YOU SOME OPTIONS 
MAYBE IT MIGHT BE RESPONSIVE TO 
SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT  

04:55:48.042 --> 04:55:50.876
MAYBE IT MIGHT BE RESPONSIVE TO 
SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT  
YOU WERE HAVING BEFORE.         

04:55:50.878 --> 04:55:51.743
SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT  
YOU WERE HAVING BEFORE.         
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT     

04:55:51.745 --> 04:55:54.747
YOU WERE HAVING BEFORE.         
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT     
IT'S THE RIGHT PATHWAYS BUT     

04:55:54.749 --> 04:55:55.581
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT     
IT'S THE RIGHT PATHWAYS BUT     
THEY SAY YOU OFF FIND SOME WAY  

04:55:55.583 --> 04:56:01.753
IT'S THE RIGHT PATHWAYS BUT     
THEY SAY YOU OFF FIND SOME WAY  
TO THINK ABOUT THESE AREAS SO I 

04:56:01.755 --> 04:56:05.558
THEY SAY YOU OFF FIND SOME WAY  
TO THINK ABOUT THESE AREAS SO I 
HAVE BEEN LOOKING A LOT AT WHAT 

04:56:05.560 --> 04:56:09.028
TO THINK ABOUT THESE AREAS SO I 
HAVE BEEN LOOKING A LOT AT WHAT 
IS IN THE CITY AND THE THE      

04:56:09.030 --> 04:56:12.631
HAVE BEEN LOOKING A LOT AT WHAT 
IS IN THE CITY AND THE THE      
LIMITATION TO TRIPLEX POSES A   

04:56:12.633 --> 04:56:13.766
IS IN THE CITY AND THE THE      
LIMITATION TO TRIPLEX POSES A   
PROBLEM IF IT I MEAN THE WAY IT 

04:56:13.768 --> 04:56:18.137
LIMITATION TO TRIPLEX POSES A   
PROBLEM IF IT I MEAN THE WAY IT 
SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IS THAT IT 

04:56:18.139 --> 04:56:18.938
PROBLEM IF IT I MEAN THE WAY IT 
SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IS THAT IT 
IS A LIMITATION ONLY TO WHAT IS 

04:56:18.940 --> 04:56:21.273
SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IS THAT IT 
IS A LIMITATION ONLY TO WHAT IS 
CURRENTLY ZONED R ONE OR TWO SO 

04:56:21.275 --> 04:56:24.877
IS A LIMITATION ONLY TO WHAT IS 
CURRENTLY ZONED R ONE OR TWO SO 
IT MAKES LESS OF AN ISSUE.      

04:56:24.879 --> 04:56:28.447
CURRENTLY ZONED R ONE OR TWO SO 
IT MAKES LESS OF AN ISSUE.      
BUT THE FACT IS THAT IN THERE   

04:56:28.449 --> 04:56:29.247
IT MAKES LESS OF AN ISSUE.      
BUT THE FACT IS THAT IN THERE   
ARE NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE IF       

04:56:29.249 --> 04:56:29.916
BUT THE FACT IS THAT IN THERE   
ARE NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE IF       
YOU'RE GOING UP THE MOUNTAIN    

04:56:29.918 --> 04:56:33.185
ARE NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE IF       
YOU'RE GOING UP THE MOUNTAIN    
WHERE THERE WILL BE THERE'S     

04:56:33.187 --> 04:56:36.989
YOU'RE GOING UP THE MOUNTAIN    
WHERE THERE WILL BE THERE'S     
ACTUALLY AN APARTMENT THAT IS   

04:56:36.991 --> 04:56:37.690
WHERE THERE WILL BE THERE'S     
ACTUALLY AN APARTMENT THAT IS   
ORIENTED NOT TOWARDS THE STREET 

04:56:37.692 --> 04:56:41.093
ACTUALLY AN APARTMENT THAT IS   
ORIENTED NOT TOWARDS THE STREET 
BUT IT'S HALF OF A COTTAGE      

04:56:41.095 --> 04:56:47.533
ORIENTED NOT TOWARDS THE STREET 
BUT IT'S HALF OF A COTTAGE      
COURT AND IT WOULD NOT BE       

04:56:47.535 --> 04:56:48.400
BUT IT'S HALF OF A COTTAGE      
COURT AND IT WOULD NOT BE       
CORRECT IN THE PRINCIPLES       

04:56:48.402 --> 04:56:52.004
COURT AND IT WOULD NOT BE       
CORRECT IN THE PRINCIPLES       
OF THIS PLAN IN MY VIEW TO MAKE 

04:56:52.006 --> 04:56:54.806
CORRECT IN THE PRINCIPLES       
OF THIS PLAN IN MY VIEW TO MAKE 
THAT IMPOSSIBLE TO REBUILD OR   

04:56:54.808 --> 04:56:58.844
OF THIS PLAN IN MY VIEW TO MAKE 
THAT IMPOSSIBLE TO REBUILD OR   
TO TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO IT'S    

04:56:58.846 --> 04:56:59.177
THAT IMPOSSIBLE TO REBUILD OR   
TO TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO IT'S    
OLDER.                          

04:56:59.179 --> 04:56:59.912
TO TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO IT'S    
OLDER.                          
SO TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO BE      

04:56:59.914 --> 04:57:03.049
OLDER.                          
SO TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO BE      
REBUILT AS A BIGFOOT AND BUT    

04:57:03.051 --> 04:57:03.983
SO TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO BE      
REBUILT AS A BIGFOOT AND BUT    
IT'S IN YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW  

04:57:03.985 --> 04:57:07.486
REBUILT AS A BIGFOOT AND BUT    
IT'S IN YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW  
WHAT THAT PARCEL IS BUT IT IS   

04:57:07.488 --> 04:57:09.955
IT'S IN YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW  
WHAT THAT PARCEL IS BUT IT IS   
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD OF SINGLE     

04:57:09.957 --> 04:57:13.960
WHAT THAT PARCEL IS BUT IT IS   
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD OF SINGLE     
FAMILY HOUSING AND SO YOU COULD 

04:57:13.962 --> 04:57:14.926
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD OF SINGLE     
FAMILY HOUSING AND SO YOU COULD 
ARGUE THAT THE PHRASE LARGER    

04:57:14.928 --> 04:57:18.331
FAMILY HOUSING AND SO YOU COULD 
ARGUE THAT THE PHRASE LARGER    
STRUCTURES WHERE YOU KNOW THE   

04:57:18.333 --> 04:57:22.201
ARGUE THAT THE PHRASE LARGER    
STRUCTURES WHERE YOU KNOW THE   
EXISTING CONTEXT WARRANTS IT.   

04:57:22.203 --> 04:57:23.202
STRUCTURES WHERE YOU KNOW THE   
EXISTING CONTEXT WARRANTS IT.   
YOU CAN ARGUE THAT THAT TAKES   

04:57:23.204 --> 04:57:23.602
EXISTING CONTEXT WARRANTS IT.   
YOU CAN ARGUE THAT THAT TAKES   
CARE OF IT.                     

04:57:23.604 --> 04:57:25.804
YOU CAN ARGUE THAT THAT TAKES   
CARE OF IT.                     
BUT I WOULD BE A LITTLE AFRAID  

04:57:25.806 --> 04:57:26.705
CARE OF IT.                     
BUT I WOULD BE A LITTLE AFRAID  
IF THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH       

04:57:26.707 --> 04:57:29.909
BUT I WOULD BE A LITTLE AFRAID  
IF THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH       
ASSURANCE.                      

04:57:29.911 --> 04:57:31.310
IF THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH       
ASSURANCE.                      
AND SO ALSO LIKE IF YOU LOOK BY 

04:57:31.312 --> 04:57:34.479
ASSURANCE.                      
AND SO ALSO LIKE IF YOU LOOK BY 
THE CEMETERY THAT'S NEAR THE    

04:57:34.481 --> 04:57:37.083
AND SO ALSO LIKE IF YOU LOOK BY 
THE CEMETERY THAT'S NEAR THE    
AAGOT LIVERY.                   

04:57:37.085 --> 04:57:40.820
THE CEMETERY THAT'S NEAR THE    
AAGOT LIVERY.                   
YEAH, THERE IS A BUNCH          

04:57:40.822 --> 04:57:41.553
AAGOT LIVERY.                   
YEAH, THERE IS A BUNCH          
OF MULTIFAMILY HOUSING THAT'S   

04:57:41.555 --> 04:57:45.490
YEAH, THERE IS A BUNCH          
OF MULTIFAMILY HOUSING THAT'S   
NOT TALL BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S     

04:57:45.492 --> 04:57:48.927
OF MULTIFAMILY HOUSING THAT'S   
NOT TALL BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S     
MANY UNITS RIGHT.               

04:57:48.929 --> 04:57:50.129
NOT TALL BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S     
MANY UNITS RIGHT.               
>> AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO NOT 

04:57:50.131 --> 04:57:52.831
MANY UNITS RIGHT.               
>> AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO NOT 
BE APPROPRIATE.                 

04:57:52.833 --> 04:57:55.768
>> AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO NOT 
BE APPROPRIATE.                 
>> AND SO THIS IS WHERE I THINK 

04:57:55.770 --> 04:58:00.272
BE APPROPRIATE.                 
>> AND SO THIS IS WHERE I THINK 
THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE   

04:58:00.274 --> 04:58:00.806
>> AND SO THIS IS WHERE I THINK 
THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE   
TRYING TO GET AT.               

04:58:00.808 --> 04:58:04.376
THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE   
TRYING TO GET AT.               
>> AND SO IT SEEMS IT SEEMED TO

05:02:22.836 --> 05:02:23.969
JUST THROW OUT EXISTING ZONING

TAKING THIS APPROACH TO REALLY  
TRY TO SIMPLIFY IT.             

05:04:10.244 --> 05:04:13.912
TAKING THIS APPROACH TO REALLY  
TRY TO SIMPLIFY IT.             
>> I I THINK WE ARE MAKING SOME 

05:04:13.914 --> 05:04:16.915
TRY TO SIMPLIFY IT.             
>> I I THINK WE ARE MAKING SOME 
STEPS TOWARDS TRYING TO BREAK

05:04:17.852 --> 05:04:21.286
STEPS TOWARDS TRYING TO BREAK   
DOWN SOME SOME EXCLUSIONARY     
LINES BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE 

05:04:21.288 --> 05:04:22.087
DOWN SOME SOME EXCLUSIONARY     
LINES BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE 
PATCHWORK OF ZONING THAT WE'VE  

05:04:22.089 --> 05:04:25.290
LINES BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE 
PATCHWORK OF ZONING THAT WE'VE  
HAD FOR A LONG TIME AND I       

05:04:25.292 --> 05:04:26.091
PATCHWORK OF ZONING THAT WE'VE  
HAD FOR A LONG TIME AND I       
APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER WYTCHES 

05:04:26.093 --> 05:04:28.927
HAD FOR A LONG TIME AND I       
APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER WYTCHES 
BUT NEEDLING ME ON THIS YOU     

05:04:28.929 --> 05:04:29.528
APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER WYTCHES 
BUT NEEDLING ME ON THIS YOU     
KNOW, WHETHER IT'S THREE

BUT NEEDLING ME ON THIS YOU     
KNOW, WHETHER IT'S THREE        
DISTRICTS ARE 10 DISTRICTS,     

05:04:32.533 --> 05:04:36.201
KNOW, WHETHER IT'S THREE        
DISTRICTS ARE 10 DISTRICTS,     
THAT'S ALL THAT'S BREAKING DOWN 

05:04:36.203 --> 05:04:37.068
DISTRICTS ARE 10 DISTRICTS,     
THAT'S ALL THAT'S BREAKING DOWN 
A LOT OF BOUNDARIES, LITERAL    

05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:40.239
THAT'S ALL THAT'S BREAKING DOWN 
A LOT OF BOUNDARIES, LITERAL    
BOUNDARIES FROM THIRTY OR       

05:04:40.241 --> 05:04:40.972
A LOT OF BOUNDARIES, LITERAL    
BOUNDARIES FROM THIRTY OR       
ZONING DISTRICTS WHICH I THINK  

05:04:40.974 --> 05:04:41.673
BOUNDARIES FROM THIRTY OR       
ZONING DISTRICTS WHICH I THINK  
WE WILL WE WILL GET I DON'T     

05:04:41.675 --> 05:04:44.142
ZONING DISTRICTS WHICH I THINK  
WE WILL WE WILL GET I DON'T     
KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BUT I  

05:04:44.144 --> 05:04:48.680
WE WILL WE WILL GET I DON'T     
KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BUT I  
BUT BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO    

05:04:48.682 --> 05:04:51.683
KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BUT I  
BUT BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO    
SORT OF START A NEW WE'RE GOING 

05:04:51.685 --> 05:04:55.854
BUT BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO    
SORT OF START A NEW WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE TO UNLESS WE GO BACK TO 

05:04:55.856 --> 05:04:56.555
SORT OF START A NEW WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE TO UNLESS WE GO BACK TO 
A VERY PATCHWORK WE'RE GOING TO 

05:04:56.557 --> 05:04:59.324
TO HAVE TO UNLESS WE GO BACK TO 
A VERY PATCHWORK WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE TO MAKE SOME JUDGMENTS     

05:04:59.326 --> 05:04:59.724
A VERY PATCHWORK WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE TO MAKE SOME JUDGMENTS     
LIKE THAT.                      

05:04:59.726 --> 05:05:00.758
HAVE TO MAKE SOME JUDGMENTS     
LIKE THAT.                      
AND I THINK TO YOUR POINT I     

05:05:00.760 --> 05:05:03.394
LIKE THAT.                      
AND I THINK TO YOUR POINT I     
THINK YOU MIGHT WE NEED WELL    

05:05:03.396 --> 05:05:04.262
AND I THINK TO YOUR POINT I     
THINK YOU MIGHT WE NEED WELL    
IT'S JUST MAKE A TRANSITION AND 

05:05:04.264 --> 05:05:07.533
THINK YOU MIGHT WE NEED WELL    
IT'S JUST MAKE A TRANSITION AND 
THAT'S YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD SOME 

05:05:07.535 --> 05:05:08.300
IT'S JUST MAKE A TRANSITION AND 
THAT'S YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD SOME 
SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THAT WELL  

05:05:08.302 --> 05:05:11.903
THAT'S YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD SOME 
SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THAT WELL  
OR NOT OR RESIDENTIAL BUT BUT   

05:05:11.905 --> 05:05:15.307
SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THAT WELL  
OR NOT OR RESIDENTIAL BUT BUT   
BECAUSE WE ARE BECAUSE WE'RE    

05:05:15.309 --> 05:05:16.207
OR NOT OR RESIDENTIAL BUT BUT   
BECAUSE WE ARE BECAUSE WE'RE    
TAKING SOME BIG SWINGS AT THAT  

05:05:16.209 --> 05:05:19.211
BECAUSE WE ARE BECAUSE WE'RE    
TAKING SOME BIG SWINGS AT THAT  
IF WE ARE TO DO IN RESIDENTIAL  

05:05:19.213 --> 05:05:20.078
TAKING SOME BIG SWINGS AT THAT  
IF WE ARE TO DO IN RESIDENTIAL  
FOLLOW SOME OF THE WAY THAT     

05:05:20.080 --> 05:05:20.845
IF WE ARE TO DO IN RESIDENTIAL  
FOLLOW SOME OF THE WAY THAT     
THAT'S EVOLVED, I THINK IT'S    

05:05:20.847 --> 05:05:23.481
FOLLOW SOME OF THE WAY THAT     
THAT'S EVOLVED, I THINK IT'S    
CREATING SOME LIMITATIONS.      

05:05:23.483 --> 05:05:24.549
THAT'S EVOLVED, I THINK IT'S    
CREATING SOME LIMITATIONS.      
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT  

05:05:24.551 --> 05:05:27.152
CREATING SOME LIMITATIONS.      
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT  
THERE'S SPACE FOR MAYBE THERE'S 

05:05:27.154 --> 05:05:28.019
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT  
THERE'S SPACE FOR MAYBE THERE'S 
A DIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL OR      

05:05:28.021 --> 05:05:28.654
THERE'S SPACE FOR MAYBE THERE'S 
A DIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL OR      
ANOTHER LAYER OF RESIDENTIAL    

05:05:28.656 --> 05:05:32.057
A DIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL OR      
ANOTHER LAYER OF RESIDENTIAL    
THAT SAYS HEY, ALL THIS STUFF   

05:05:32.059 --> 05:05:32.791
ANOTHER LAYER OF RESIDENTIAL    
THAT SAYS HEY, ALL THIS STUFF   
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH   

05:05:32.793 --> 05:05:33.659
THAT SAYS HEY, ALL THIS STUFF   
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH   
THREE STORIES OR TRIBAL X'S OR  

05:05:33.661 --> 05:05:35.927
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH   
THREE STORIES OR TRIBAL X'S OR  
WHATEVER, THAT'S STILL REALLY   

05:05:35.929 --> 05:05:36.661
THREE STORIES OR TRIBAL X'S OR  
WHATEVER, THAT'S STILL REALLY   
APPROPRIATE FOR ONE IN TWO      

05:05:36.663 --> 05:05:39.832
WHATEVER, THAT'S STILL REALLY   
APPROPRIATE FOR ONE IN TWO      
FAMILIES AREAS OR SOME OTHER    

05:05:39.834 --> 05:05:40.365
APPROPRIATE FOR ONE IN TWO      
FAMILIES AREAS OR SOME OTHER    
GEOGRAPHY FRANKLY.              

05:05:40.367 --> 05:05:43.235
FAMILIES AREAS OR SOME OTHER    
GEOGRAPHY FRANKLY.              
BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT 

05:05:43.237 --> 05:05:43.835
GEOGRAPHY FRANKLY.              
BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT 
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR        

05:05:43.837 --> 05:05:46.838
BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT 
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR        
RESIDENTIAL THE HIGHER DENSITY  

05:05:46.840 --> 05:05:50.408
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR        
RESIDENTIAL THE HIGHER DENSITY  
AT A DIFFERENT TYPOLOGY THAT    

05:05:50.410 --> 05:05:51.276
RESIDENTIAL THE HIGHER DENSITY  
AT A DIFFERENT TYPOLOGY THAT    
MIGHT FALL SHORT OF WHAT EIGHT  

05:05:51.278 --> 05:05:54.880
AT A DIFFERENT TYPOLOGY THAT    
MIGHT FALL SHORT OF WHAT EIGHT  
STORIES, THREE STORIES          

05:05:54.882 --> 05:05:55.614
MIGHT FALL SHORT OF WHAT EIGHT  
STORIES, THREE STORIES          
TRANSITIONS MIGHT EVENTUALLY    

05:05:55.616 --> 05:05:56.415
STORIES, THREE STORIES          
TRANSITIONS MIGHT EVENTUALLY    
EVOLVE IN TRANSITION DISTRICT   

05:05:56.417 --> 05:06:01.686
TRANSITIONS MIGHT EVENTUALLY    
EVOLVE IN TRANSITION DISTRICT   
AND SO SO I APPRECIATE THAT I I

WELL, THERE HAS BEEN A THREE

05:19:21.654 --> 05:19:26.290
             SO THE ARGUMENT    
HERE IS THAT IN THESE POCKETS   
WHERE THE HEIGHT ACTUALLY IS IN

HERE IS THAT IN THESE POCKETS

THE BALLPARK OF THAT RESIDENT,  

05:19:30.129 --> 05:19:31.062
WHERE THE HEIGHT ACTUALLY IS IN

IS IT APPROPRIATE CATEGORY TO

THE BALLPARK OF THAT RESIDENT,  
IS IT APPROPRIATE CATEGORY TO   
APPLY GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY

IS IT APPROPRIATE CATEGORY TO   
APPLY GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY     
THAT EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THE

APPLY GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY     
THAT EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THE 
THE CHARACTERISTICS IF WE WRITE 

05:19:34.734 --> 05:19:37.935
THAT EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THE 
THE CHARACTERISTICS IF WE WRITE 
WE HAVE A ZONE FOR GREATER

THE CHARACTERISTICS IF WE WRITE 
WE HAVE A ZONE FOR GREATER

05:19:38.705 --> 05:19:42.106
WE HAVE A ZONE FOR GREATER      
HEIGHT AND DENSITY IN THESE     
AREAS WILL RECOMMEND THE DOWN   

05:19:42.108 --> 05:19:45.342
HEIGHT AND DENSITY IN THESE     
AREAS WILL RECOMMEND THE DOWN   
ZONE AND IT'S NOT HOW MANY      

05:19:45.344 --> 05:19:46.043
AREAS WILL RECOMMEND THE DOWN   
ZONE AND IT'S NOT HOW MANY      
OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY HEIGHT?    

05:19:46.045 --> 05:19:48.912
ZONE AND IT'S NOT HOW MANY      
OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY HEIGHT?    
>> WELL, BECAUSE A LOT OF THE   

05:19:48.914 --> 05:19:49.881
OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY HEIGHT?    
>> WELL, BECAUSE A LOT OF THE   
DENSE THINGS ARE NOT TALL.      

05:19:49.883 --> 05:19:50.415
>> WELL, BECAUSE A LOT OF THE   
DENSE THINGS ARE NOT TALL.

DENSE THINGS ARE NOT TALL.      
>> THEY'RE SURE.                
YEAH, THAT'S BUILT ENVIRONMENT. 

05:19:53.486 --> 05:19:54.085
>> THEY'RE SURE.                
YEAH, THAT'S BUILT ENVIRONMENT. 
IT'S UNQUESTIONABLE THAT OUR    

05:19:54.087 --> 05:19:57.088
YEAH, THAT'S BUILT ENVIRONMENT. 
IT'S UNQUESTIONABLE THAT OUR    
FLOOR ALLOWS FOR HIGHER THAN    

05:19:57.090 --> 05:19:57.755
IT'S UNQUESTIONABLE THAT OUR    
FLOOR ALLOWS FOR HIGHER THAN    
THAN RESIDENTIAL ALLOWS.        

05:19:57.757 --> 05:19:58.589
FLOOR ALLOWS FOR HIGHER THAN    
THAN RESIDENTIAL ALLOWS.        
SO WE WOULD BE RECOMMENDING A   

05:19:58.591 --> 05:20:00.624
THAN RESIDENTIAL ALLOWS.        
SO WE WOULD BE RECOMMENDING A   
DOWN ZONING FOR ALL OF THESE    

05:20:00.626 --> 05:20:01.392
SO WE WOULD BE RECOMMENDING A   
DOWN ZONING FOR ALL OF THESE    
POCKETS GIVEN IT WOULD BE A     

05:20:01.394 --> 05:20:04.495
DOWN ZONING FOR ALL OF THESE    
POCKETS GIVEN IT WOULD BE A     
DOWN ZONING FROM WHAT MOST

POCKETS GIVEN IT WOULD BE A     
DOWN ZONING FROM WHAT MOST      
OF THEM DON'T CURRENTLY REALIZE 

05:20:05.198 --> 05:20:08.465
DOWN ZONING FROM WHAT MOST      
OF THEM DON'T CURRENTLY REALIZE 
THAT IS CORRECT.                

05:20:08.467 --> 05:20:08.966
OF THEM DON'T CURRENTLY REALIZE 
THAT IS CORRECT.                
GOT IT.                         

05:20:08.968 --> 05:20:09.700
THAT IS CORRECT.                
GOT IT.

WOULD JUST START WITH A         

05:30:18.777 --> 05:30:19.442
THE DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS AND I   
WOULD JUST START WITH A         
REGULATORY DESCRIPTION THAT     

05:30:19.444 --> 05:30:23.046
WOULD JUST START WITH A

05:30:23.048 --> 05:30:24.114
REGULATORY DESCRIPTION THAT     
MIGHT ACCOMMODATE THOSE.        
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE SOME DOWN 

05:30:24.116 --> 05:30:26.750

I THINK IT WOULD HAVE SOME DOWN 
ZONING ON PAPER OR THAT'S A     

05:30:26.752 --> 05:30:30.220
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE SOME DOWN 
ZONING ON PAPER OR THAT'S A     
REAL DOWN ZONING BECAUSE THERE  

05:30:30.222 --> 05:30:31.221
ZONING ON PAPER OR THAT'S A     
REAL DOWN ZONING BECAUSE THERE  
WE HAVE AREAS IN THE CITY THAT

OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND     

05:30:39.465 --> 05:30:45.202
WIDE AS WE THINK BECAUSE OF OUR 
OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND     
OTHER THINGS BUT IT WOULD ALSO  

05:30:45.204 --> 05:30:46.003

OTHER THINGS BUT IT WOULD ALSO  
LIKELY NOT BE LIMITED TO THREE

05:36:30.649 --> 05:36:35.985
I FEEL LIKE PORTERING IS A      
COMPROMISE.                     
>> I I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE    

05:36:35.987 --> 05:36:36.320
COMPROMISE.                     
>> I I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE    
WITH THAT.                      

05:36:36.322 --> 05:36:37.287

05:36:43.762 --> 05:36:47.263
I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE       
CONCERN AGAIN HAS BEEN RAISED   
BECAUSE PEOPLE SEE A LOT        

05:36:47.265 --> 05:36:47.997
CONCERN AGAIN HAS BEEN RAISED   
BECAUSE PEOPLE SEE A LOT        
OF DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE IN   

05:36:47.999 --> 05:36:50.533
BECAUSE PEOPLE SEE A LOT        
OF DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE IN   
THE CATEGORY WE ARE LUMPING

05:36:58.810 --> 05:37:02.278
MAP GAY ARE SIMILAR TO          
TRANSITION AND I MAY BE WRONG I 
THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERN AND  

05:37:02.280 --> 05:37:03.046
TRANSITION AND I MAY BE WRONG I 
THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERN AND  
CONSTRAINT THAT THE COUNCIL HAS 

05:37:03.048 --> 05:37:03.846
THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERN AND  
CONSTRAINT THAT THE COUNCIL HAS 
ASKED THE PLANNING COMMISSION   

05:37:03.848 --> 05:37:05.848
CONSTRAINT THAT THE COUNCIL HAS 
ASKED THE PLANNING COMMISSION   
CAN CONSIDER IS FRANKLY MORE    

05:37:05.850 --> 05:37:06.449
ASKED THE PLANNING COMMISSION   
CAN CONSIDER IS FRANKLY MORE    
TOWARD TOWARDS TRADITIONAL      

05:37:06.451 --> 05:37:09.486
CAN CONSIDER IS FRANKLY MORE    
TOWARD TOWARDS TRADITIONAL      
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS     

05:37:09.488 --> 05:37:10.253
TOWARD TOWARDS TRADITIONAL      
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS     
THAN EVERY AREA ON THAT         

05:37:10.255 --> 05:37:13.289
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS     
THAN EVERY AREA ON THAT         
RESIDENTIAL MAP.                

05:37:13.291 --> 05:37:17.394
THAN EVERY AREA ON THAT         
RESIDENTIAL MAP.                
AND SO I I SEE THAT THERE IS AN 

05:37:17.396 --> 05:37:20.864
RESIDENTIAL MAP.                
AND SO I I SEE THAT THERE IS AN 
OPENING AND WILLINGNESS THE     

05:37:20.866 --> 05:37:21.598
AND SO I I SEE THAT THERE IS AN 
OPENING AND WILLINGNESS THE     
COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THAT        

05:37:21.600 --> 05:37:24.901
OPENING AND WILLINGNESS THE     
COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THAT        
RESIDENTIAL CATEGORY NOT        

05:37:24.903 --> 05:37:25.835

IT'S NOT JUST THE NAMES AND     
IT'S THAT I HAVE A LOT OF NEW   
BUILD IN MY WARD THAT'S DENSE   

05:38:15.353 --> 05:38:18.989
IT'S THAT I HAVE A LOT OF NEW   
BUILD IN MY WARD THAT'S DENSE   
AND HOW IT'S ACCOMPLISHED IS    

05:38:18.991 --> 05:38:22.792
BUILD IN MY WARD THAT'S DENSE   
AND HOW IT'S ACCOMPLISHED IS    
NOT THROUGH HEIGHT AND IT'S NOT 

05:38:22.794 --> 05:38:23.193
AND HOW IT'S ACCOMPLISHED IS    
NOT THROUGH HEIGHT AND IT'S NOT 
GRADED.                         

05:38:23.195 --> 05:38:26.596
NOT THROUGH HEIGHT AND IT'S NOT 
GRADED.                         
IT'S A VERY SUBURBAN STYLE      

05:38:26.598 --> 05:38:27.396
GRADED.                         
IT'S A VERY SUBURBAN STYLE      
OF DEVELOPMENT AND SO THINGS    

05:38:27.398 --> 05:38:29.766
IT'S A VERY SUBURBAN STYLE      
OF DEVELOPMENT AND SO THINGS    
ARE ATTACHED AND HOW THAT HOW   

05:38:29.768 --> 05:38:30.700
OF DEVELOPMENT AND SO THINGS    
ARE ATTACHED AND HOW THAT HOW   
YOU REALIZE THE DENSITY AS YOU  

05:38:30.702 --> 05:38:31.368
ARE ATTACHED AND HOW THAT HOW   
YOU REALIZE THE DENSITY AS YOU  
MAKE THINGS SMALLER AND YOU     

05:38:31.370 --> 05:38:41.377
YOU REALIZE THE DENSITY AS YOU  
MAKE THINGS SMALLER AND YOU     
STICK THEM TOGETHER AND SO SO   

05:38:41.379 --> 05:38:42.679
MAKE THINGS SMALLER AND YOU     
STICK THEM TOGETHER AND SO SO   
WHEN I GO TO OTHER PARTS OF THE

STICK THEM TOGETHER AND SO SO   
WHEN I GO TO OTHER PARTS OF THE 
CITY THAT ARE OLDER, THINGS ARE 

05:38:45.149 --> 05:38:46.182
WHEN I GO TO OTHER PARTS OF THE 
CITY THAT ARE OLDER, THINGS ARE 
SMALL, THEY ARE TWO BUT THEY'RE 

05:38:46.184 --> 05:38:53.089
CITY THAT ARE OLDER, THINGS ARE 
SMALL, THEY ARE TWO BUT THEY'RE 
SEPARATE AND SO IT IS YOU CAN'T 

05:38:53.091 --> 05:38:53.790
SMALL, THEY ARE TWO BUT THEY'RE 
SEPARATE AND SO IT IS YOU CAN'T 
ENVISION GREATER DENSITY THE    

05:38:53.792 --> 05:38:57.427
SEPARATE AND SO IT IS YOU CAN'T 
ENVISION GREATER DENSITY THE    
SAME WAY IN THOSE TWO KINDS     

05:38:57.429 --> 05:38:57.894
ENVISION GREATER DENSITY THE    
SAME WAY IN THOSE TWO KINDS     
OF PLACES.                      

05:38:57.896 --> 05:39:01.431
SAME WAY IN THOSE TWO KINDS     
OF PLACES.                      
AND WHAT THERE IS IN MY WARD IS 

05:39:01.433 --> 05:39:04.768
OF PLACES.                      
AND WHAT THERE IS IN MY WARD IS 
MORE LAWN THAN ANY ONE REALLY   

05:39:04.770 --> 05:39:05.569
AND WHAT THERE IS IN MY WARD IS 
MORE LAWN THAN ANY ONE REALLY   
NEEDS ALTHOUGH LOTS OF PEOPLE   

05:39:05.571 --> 05:39:07.871
MORE LAWN THAN ANY ONE REALLY   
NEEDS ALTHOUGH LOTS OF PEOPLE   
ARE ATTACHED TO IT WHICH        

05:39:07.873 --> 05:39:08.738
NEEDS ALTHOUGH LOTS OF PEOPLE   
ARE ATTACHED TO IT WHICH        
SURPRISES ME BUT I NEED TO      

05:39:08.740 --> 05:39:12.608
ARE ATTACHED TO IT WHICH        
SURPRISES ME BUT I NEED TO

BUT IT BECAUSE YOU GET YOU GET  
THINGS STUCK TOGETHER, YOU GET  

05:39:17.515 --> 05:39:19.949

>> IT'S VERY DENSE.             

05:39:20.785 --> 05:39:21.117
THERE IT'S MUCH MORE DENSE.     
>> IT'S VERY DENSE.             
RIGHT.

BUT IT'S NOT DENSE BECAUSE IT'S 
TALL.                           
I MEAN SOME OF IT IS TALLER     

05:39:24.923 --> 05:39:25.521
TALL.                           
I MEAN SOME OF IT IS TALLER     
THAN THE RANCH HOUSES.          

05:39:25.523 --> 05:39:29.292
I MEAN SOME OF IT IS TALLER     
THAN THE RANCH HOUSES.          
SO WHEN RESIDENTS LOOK AT AND   

05:39:29.294 --> 05:39:30.093
THAN THE RANCH HOUSES.          
SO WHEN RESIDENTS LOOK AT AND   
THEY HEAR THIRTY FEET THEY'RE   

05:39:30.095 --> 05:39:30.826
SO WHEN RESIDENTS LOOK AT AND   
THEY HEAR THIRTY FEET THEY'RE   
LIKE EVERYTHING AROUND THIS ONE 

05:39:30.828 --> 05:39:33.497
THEY HEAR THIRTY FEET THEY'RE   
LIKE EVERYTHING AROUND THIS ONE 
STOREY I LIVE IN A IN A         

05:39:33.499 --> 05:39:35.565
LIKE EVERYTHING AROUND THIS ONE 
STOREY I LIVE IN A IN A         
DISTRICT OF RANCH HOUSES AND SO 

05:39:35.567 --> 05:39:36.666
STOREY I LIVE IN A IN A         
DISTRICT OF RANCH HOUSES AND SO 
THEY WOULD FEEL LIKE THE IDEA   

05:39:36.668 --> 05:39:40.403
DISTRICT OF RANCH HOUSES AND SO 
THEY WOULD FEEL LIKE THE IDEA   
THAT SOMEHOW IT WOULD BE DOWN   

05:39:40.405 --> 05:39:41.137
THEY WOULD FEEL LIKE THE IDEA   
THAT SOMEHOW IT WOULD BE DOWN   
ZONING THEM TO PUT THEM AT      

05:39:41.139 --> 05:39:43.540
THAT SOMEHOW IT WOULD BE DOWN   
ZONING THEM TO PUT THEM AT      
ANYTHING LESS THAN THREE        

05:39:43.542 --> 05:39:44.407
ZONING THEM TO PUT THEM AT      
ANYTHING LESS THAN THREE        
STOREYS THEY FEEL LIKE WHAT     

05:39:44.409 --> 05:39:48.044
ANYTHING LESS THAN THREE        
STOREYS THEY FEEL LIKE WHAT     
THAT'S AN AMAZING INCREASE IN   

05:39:48.046 --> 05:39:48.445
STOREYS THEY FEEL LIKE WHAT     
THAT'S AN AMAZING INCREASE IN   
HEIGHT.                         

05:39:48.447 --> 05:39:49.579
THAT'S AN AMAZING INCREASE IN   
HEIGHT.                         
>> AND I DON'T I'M NOT I'M NOT  

05:39:49.581 --> 05:39:52.516
HEIGHT.                         
>> AND I DON'T I'M NOT I'M NOT  
SAYING THAT THEREFORE I WANT TO 

05:39:52.518 --> 05:39:53.049
>> AND I DON'T I'M NOT I'M NOT  
SAYING THAT THEREFORE I WANT TO 
BACK OFF FROM THAT.             

05:39:53.051 --> 05:39:55.585
SAYING THAT THEREFORE I WANT TO 
BACK OFF FROM THAT.             
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE WAY    

05:39:55.587 --> 05:39:56.386
BACK OFF FROM THAT.             
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE WAY    
THIS CITY HAS ACCOMPLISHED      

05:39:56.388 --> 05:39:59.855
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE WAY    
THIS CITY HAS ACCOMPLISHED      
DENSITY HAS HAPPENED            

05:39:59.857 --> 05:40:00.557
THIS CITY HAS ACCOMPLISHED      
DENSITY HAS HAPPENED            
DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT TIMES  

05:40:00.559 --> 05:40:03.326
DENSITY HAS HAPPENED            
DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT TIMES  
WHEN IT WAS BUILT AND UNDER     

05:40:03.328 --> 05:40:04.027
DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT TIMES  
WHEN IT WAS BUILT AND UNDER     
DIFFERENT ZONING REGIMES.       

05:40:04.029 --> 05:40:07.531
WHEN IT WAS BUILT AND UNDER     
DIFFERENT ZONING REGIMES.       
SO WHEN YOU HAD SMALLER PARCELS 

05:40:07.533 --> 05:40:08.331
DIFFERENT ZONING REGIMES.       
SO WHEN YOU HAD SMALLER PARCELS 
YOU ACCOMPLISH DENSITY IN ONE   

05:40:08.333 --> 05:40:11.534
SO WHEN YOU HAD SMALLER PARCELS 
YOU ACCOMPLISH DENSITY IN ONE   
WAY AND THEN YOU HAD BIGGER     

05:40:11.536 --> 05:40:12.202
YOU ACCOMPLISH DENSITY IN ONE   
WAY AND THEN YOU HAD BIGGER     
LOFT SIZE MINIMUMS WHICH ARE    

05:40:12.204 --> 05:40:15.705
WAY AND THEN YOU HAD BIGGER     
LOFT SIZE MINIMUMS WHICH ARE    
TRUE IN LOTS OF WORD ONE AND    

05:40:15.707 --> 05:40:18.341
LOFT SIZE MINIMUMS WHICH ARE    
TRUE IN LOTS OF WORD ONE AND    
LOTS OF WORK TO AND OTHER WORDS 

05:40:18.343 --> 05:40:18.642
TRUE IN LOTS OF WORD ONE AND    
LOTS OF WORK TO AND OTHER WORDS 
TOO.                            

05:40:18.644 --> 05:40:19.508
LOTS OF WORK TO AND OTHER WORDS 
TOO.                            
BUT THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT 

05:40:19.510 --> 05:40:22.078
TOO.

ABOUT ENTRENCHING BAD PATTERNS  

05:42:40.785 --> 05:42:41.517
REALLY I THINK JULIA'S COMMENT  
ABOUT ENTRENCHING BAD PATTERNS  
THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IS REALLY

MINDFUL OF THAT TOO.            
SO I KEEP COMING BACK TO EVEN   
AND THE REASON I WAS HESITATING 

05:42:52.764 --> 05:42:55.397
SO I KEEP COMING BACK TO EVEN   
AND THE REASON I WAS HESITATING 
WHAT JUST KIND OF PROFORMA      

05:42:55.399 --> 05:42:56.198

WHAT JUST KIND OF PROFORMA      
MOVING EVERYTHING ARE FOREIGN   

05:42:56.200 --> 05:42:56.866
WHAT JUST KIND OF PROFORMA      
MOVING EVERYTHING ARE FOREIGN   
TO TRANSITION WHICH WE FINALLY  

05:42:56.868 --> 05:43:00.336
MOVING EVERYTHING ARE FOREIGN

THAT IN A LONG CORRIDORS WHERE  
THAT MAKES SENSE.               
IT MAKES LESS SENSE TO ME TO DO 

05:43:04.710 --> 05:43:05.508
THAT MAKES SENSE.               
IT MAKES LESS SENSE TO ME TO DO 
IT FOR ENOUGH FOR A DISTRICT    

05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:06.776
IT MAKES LESS SENSE TO ME TO DO 
IT FOR ENOUGH FOR A DISTRICT    
THAT'S COMPLETELY RESIDENTIAL   

05:43:06.778 --> 05:43:07.777
IT FOR ENOUGH FOR A DISTRICT    
THAT'S COMPLETELY RESIDENTIAL   
JUST BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR FAVOR

05:43:32.804 --> 05:43:33.536
DILEMMA BUT YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE  
LOOKING AT THE AREAS THAT WE'RE 
LOOKING AT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE  

05:43:33.538 --> 05:43:34.303
LOOKING AT THE AREAS THAT WE'RE 
LOOKING AT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE  
ZONED OUT FOR AND THIS MAP THAT

I WOULD START WITH THESE I

THINGS OTHER THAN THE 17?       
I WOULD START WITH THESE I      
DON'T KNOW UNTIL I SORT         

06:01:37.320 --> 06:01:40.489
I WOULD START WITH THESE I      
DON'T KNOW UNTIL I SORT         
OF FIGURE OUT I'M GOING TO      

06:01:40.491 --> 06:01:41.223
DON'T KNOW UNTIL I SORT         
OF FIGURE OUT I'M GOING TO      
BUILD THAT MAP I DON'T KNOW.    

06:01:41.225 --> 06:01:42.257
OF FIGURE OUT I'M GOING TO      
BUILD THAT MAP I DON'T KNOW.    
BUT I WOULD START FOCUSING ON   

06:01:42.259 --> 06:01:44.692
BUILD THAT MAP I DON'T KNOW.    
BUT I WOULD START FOCUSING ON   
THESE BECAUSE I THINK THESE ARE 

06:01:44.694 --> 06:01:45.326
BUT I WOULD START FOCUSING ON   
THESE BECAUSE I THINK THESE ARE 
PRETTY INDICATIVE OF THE        

06:01:45.328 --> 06:01:47.996
THESE BECAUSE I THINK THESE ARE 
PRETTY INDICATIVE OF THE        
STRUGGLE THAT YOU'RE HAVING.    

06:01:47.998 --> 06:01:48.864

THEY'RE GOOD LABORATORIES TO    

06:01:48.866 --> 06:01:51.800
STRUGGLE THAT YOU'RE HAVING.    
THEY'RE GOOD LABORATORIES TO    
TRY THAT LANGUAGE OUT AND WHAT  

06:01:51.802 --> 06:01:56.537
THEY'RE GOOD LABORATORIES TO    
TRY THAT LANGUAGE OUT AND WHAT  
THIS WOULD DO BECAUSE I GUESS   

06:01:56.539 --> 06:01:59.107
TRY THAT LANGUAGE OUT AND WHAT  
THIS WOULD DO BECAUSE I GUESS   
LIKE SMARTPHONES WOULD          

06:01:59.109 --> 06:01:59.874
THIS WOULD DO BECAUSE I GUESS   
LIKE SMARTPHONES WOULD          
TRANSITION SOME OUR PHONES      

06:01:59.876 --> 06:02:03.211
LIKE SMARTPHONES WOULD          
TRANSITION SOME OUR PHONES      
WOULD BE IN THIS NEW THING      

06:02:03.213 --> 06:02:03.946
TRANSITION SOME OUR PHONES      
WOULD BE IN THIS NEW THING      
SIMILAR TO SOME OUR THREES      

06:02:03.948 --> 06:02:04.746
WOULD BE IN THIS NEW THING      
SIMILAR TO SOME OUR THREES      
WOULD BE IN TRANSITION STILL    

06:02:04.748 --> 06:02:07.181
SIMILAR TO SOME OUR THREES      
WOULD BE IN TRANSITION STILL    
SOME ARE THREES.                

06:02:07.183 --> 06:02:08.116
WOULD BE IN TRANSITION STILL    
SOME ARE THREES.                
SO IT'S REALLY LESS ABOUT THE   

06:02:08.118 --> 06:02:08.817
SOME ARE THREES.                
SO IT'S REALLY LESS ABOUT THE   
CURRENT ZONING AND MORE ABOUT   

06:02:08.819 --> 06:02:11.719
SO IT'S REALLY LESS ABOUT THE   
CURRENT ZONING AND MORE ABOUT   
THE CURRENT LAND USE AND FOR    

06:02:11.721 --> 06:02:12.221
CURRENT ZONING AND MORE ABOUT   
THE CURRENT LAND USE AND FOR    
FUTURE LAND USE TOO.            

06:02:12.223 --> 06:02:15.156

YEAH THOSE ARE RIGHT OF COURSE. 

06:02:19.029 --> 06:02:19.694

YEAH THOSE ARE RIGHT OF COURSE. 
>> OF COURSE.                   

06:02:19.696 --> 06:02:22.197
YEAH THOSE ARE RIGHT OF COURSE. 
>> OF COURSE.
