SO THE GUN ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM   

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:02.999
AND MAINTENANCE.                
SO THE GUN ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM   
THAT&apos;S BEEN REFERENCED          

01:00:03.001 --> 01:00:05.368
SO THE GUN ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM   
THAT&apos;S BEEN REFERENCED          
FREQUENTLY IS REQUIRE           

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:06.102
THAT&apos;S BEEN REFERENCED          
FREQUENTLY IS REQUIRE           
SIGNIFICANT MORE MAINTENANCE    

01:00:06.104 --> 01:00:09.872
FREQUENTLY IS REQUIRE           
SIGNIFICANT MORE MAINTENANCE    
AND OPERATIONAL COST THAN THAN  

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:13.677
SIGNIFICANT MORE MAINTENANCE    
AND OPERATIONAL COST THAN THAN  
THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM FOR A    

01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:17.179
AND OPERATIONAL COST THAN THAN  
THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM FOR A    
FACILITY OF THIS SIZE.

AND SO THE DECISION ON WHICH    
DIRECTION TO GO WITH THE SYSTEM 

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:25.321
AND SO THE DECISION ON WHICH    
DIRECTION TO GO WITH THE SYSTEM 
IS MORE ABOUT THE THE SYSTEM    

01:00:25.323 --> 01:00:28.391
DIRECTION TO GO WITH THE SYSTEM 
IS MORE ABOUT THE THE SYSTEM    
ITSELF THAN THE ACTUAL FUEL.    

01:00:28.393 --> 01:00:29.125
IS MORE ABOUT THE THE SYSTEM    
ITSELF THAN THE ACTUAL FUEL.    
SO THAT&apos;S AN ONGOING            

01:00:29.127 --> 01:00:29.526
ITSELF THAN THE ACTUAL FUEL.    
SO THAT&apos;S AN ONGOING            
DISCUSSION.

BUT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOT   
DESIGNED THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM  

01:00:36.234 --> 01:00:40.336
BUT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOT   
DESIGNED THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM  
ALTHOUGH TRADITIONALLY WE USE   

01:00:40.338 --> 01:00:41.104
DESIGNED THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM  
ALTHOUGH TRADITIONALLY WE USE   
LABORATORY WE NORMALLY USE A    

01:00:41.106 --> 01:00:43.606
ALTHOUGH TRADITIONALLY WE USE   
LABORATORY WE NORMALLY USE A    
MORE TRADITIONAL FUEL SYSTEM    

01:00:43.608 --> 01:00:44.440
LABORATORY WE NORMALLY USE A    
MORE TRADITIONAL FUEL SYSTEM    
THAT THE BANK IS MORE           

01:00:44.442 --> 01:00:47.744
MORE TRADITIONAL FUEL SYSTEM    
THAT THE BANK IS MORE

WITH MANY PROJECTS THAT HAVE    

01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:21.023
JUST SAY I&apos;VE BEEN ASSOCIATED   
WITH MANY PROJECTS THAT HAVE    
THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS.         

01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:24.194
WITH MANY PROJECTS THAT HAVE    
THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS.         
YOU HAVE A ONE STOREY BUILDING  

01:04:24.196 --> 01:04:25.261
THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS.         
YOU HAVE A ONE STOREY BUILDING  
,YOU HAVE A TON OF ROOF AREA.   

01:04:25.263 --> 01:04:27.730
YOU HAVE A ONE STOREY BUILDING  
,YOU HAVE A TON OF ROOF AREA.   
YOU HAVE AREA OF GREEN AREA IN  

01:04:27.732 --> 01:04:28.531
,YOU HAVE A TON OF ROOF AREA.   
YOU HAVE AREA OF GREEN AREA IN  
WHICH YOU COULD DO SOME SORT    

01:04:28.533 --> 01:04:31.801
YOU HAVE AREA OF GREEN AREA IN  
WHICH YOU COULD DO SOME SORT    
OF YOU KNOW, UNDERGROUND SYSTEM 

01:04:31.803 --> 01:04:32.601
WHICH YOU COULD DO SOME SORT    
OF YOU KNOW, UNDERGROUND SYSTEM 
FOR THIS TO WHETHER THEY&apos;RE A   

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:36.072
OF YOU KNOW, UNDERGROUND SYSTEM 
FOR THIS TO WHETHER THEY&apos;RE A   
LOOP SYSTEM OR WELLS AND IT     

01:04:36.074 --> 01:04:39.976
FOR THIS TO WHETHER THEY&apos;RE A   
LOOP SYSTEM OR WELLS AND IT     
GETS HARDER AS YOU GO UP AS     

01:04:39.978 --> 01:04:40.777
LOOP SYSTEM OR WELLS AND IT     
GETS HARDER AS YOU GO UP AS     
YOUR ENERGY DEMANDS GO UP AND   

01:04:40.779 --> 01:04:43.813
GETS HARDER AS YOU GO UP AS     
YOUR ENERGY DEMANDS GO UP AND   
AS YOU HAVE LESS AREA TO BE     

01:04:43.815 --> 01:04:47.350
YOUR ENERGY DEMANDS GO UP AND   
AS YOU HAVE LESS AREA TO BE     
ABLE TO SET UP SOLAR SO IT      

01:04:47.352 --> 01:04:51.687
AS YOU HAVE LESS AREA TO BE     
ABLE TO SET UP SOLAR SO IT      
SEEMS TO ME BASED ON SORT       

01:04:51.689 --> 01:04:52.388
ABLE TO SET UP SOLAR SO IT      
SEEMS TO ME BASED ON SORT       
OF READING BETWEEN THE LINES    

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:53.189
SEEMS TO ME BASED ON SORT       
OF READING BETWEEN THE LINES    
OF I GUESS I JUST SORT OF WANT  

01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:55.891
OF READING BETWEEN THE LINES    
OF I GUESS I JUST SORT OF WANT  
TO UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS TO ME    

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:56.525
OF I GUESS I JUST SORT OF WANT

TO UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS TO ME    
THAT IT&apos;S BECAUSE YOU ALL       
DIDN&apos;T KIND OF START THINKING   

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:00.196
THAT IT&apos;S BECAUSE YOU ALL       
DIDN&apos;T KIND OF START THINKING   
THAT WAY FROM THE BEGINNING     

01:05:00.198 --> 01:05:00.963
DIDN&apos;T KIND OF START THINKING   
THAT WAY FROM THE BEGINNING     
THAT YOU&apos;VE ENDED UP WHERE YOU  

01:05:00.965 --> 01:05:06.369
THAT WAY FROM THE BEGINNING     
THAT YOU&apos;VE ENDED UP WHERE YOU  
ARE RATHER THAN YOU KNOW, IT    

01:05:06.371 --> 01:05:07.470
THAT YOU&apos;VE ENDED UP WHERE YOU  
ARE RATHER THAN YOU KNOW, IT    
DIDN&apos;T SEEM LIKE THAT WAS ONE   

01:05:07.472 --> 01:05:10.506
ARE RATHER THAN YOU KNOW, IT    
DIDN&apos;T SEEM LIKE THAT WAS ONE   
OF YOUR GOALS.

DIDN&apos;T SEEM LIKE THAT WAS ONE   
OF YOUR GOALS.                  
AND I THINK THAT PART OF WHAT

PEOPLE WE ARE TRYING TO THERE&apos;S 
A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE       

01:05:30.328 --> 01:05:33.363
PEOPLE WE ARE TRYING TO THERE&apos;S 
A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE       
DIRECTION OF THIS CORRIDOR THAT 

01:05:33.365 --> 01:05:34.230
A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE       
DIRECTION OF THIS CORRIDOR THAT 
FEEL LIKE ARE JUST NOT BEING

DIRECTION OF THIS CORRIDOR THAT 
FEEL LIKE ARE JUST NOT BEING    
ADDRESSED AT ALL.               

01:05:34.766 --> 01:05:37.367
FEEL LIKE ARE JUST NOT BEING    
ADDRESSED AT ALL.               
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT   

01:05:37.369 --> 01:05:38.234
ADDRESSED AT ALL.               
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT   
THE DIRECTION OF WHERE A CITY   

01:05:38.236 --> 01:05:38.700
THERE&apos;S A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT   
THE DIRECTION OF WHERE A CITY   
WANTS TO GO.                    

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:40.236
THE DIRECTION OF WHERE A CITY   
WANTS TO GO.                    
IT FEELS LIKE IT&apos;S NOT BEING    

01:05:40.238 --> 01:05:41.037
WANTS TO GO.                    
IT FEELS LIKE IT&apos;S NOT BEING

IT FEELS LIKE IT&apos;S NOT BEING    
ADDRESSED HERE AT ALL.          
SO I&apos;VE BEEN ON PLANNING        

01:05:41.906 --> 01:05:44.874
ADDRESSED HERE AT ALL.

SO I&apos;VE BEEN ON PLANNING        
COMMISSION FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW. 
I WOULD SAY IF THIS HAD COME    

01:05:45.744 --> 01:05:46.542
COMMISSION FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW. 
I WOULD SAY IF THIS HAD COME    
THROUGH SEVEN YEARS AGO I WOULD 

01:05:46.544 --> 01:05:48.410
I WOULD SAY IF THIS HAD COME    
THROUGH SEVEN YEARS AGO I WOULD 
HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT  

01:05:48.412 --> 01:05:48.811
THROUGH SEVEN YEARS AGO I WOULD 
HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT  
IT.                             

01:05:48.813 --> 01:05:49.878
HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT  
IT.                             
BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT&apos;S JUST NOT 

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.048

MANDATE YOU TO DO THIS.         
I JUST FIND THE RESPONSE        
LACKING IN TERMS OF IS GOING TO 

01:06:35.293 --> 01:06:36.092
I JUST FIND THE RESPONSE        
LACKING IN TERMS OF IS GOING TO 
BE HARD FOR US TO TAKE CARE     

01:06:36.094 --> 01:06:36.825
LACKING IN TERMS OF IS GOING TO 
BE HARD FOR US TO TAKE CARE     
OF WHEN I KNOW OF MANY PROJECTS 

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:37.493
BE HARD FOR US TO TAKE CARE     
OF WHEN I KNOW OF MANY PROJECTS 
THAT ARE DOING JUST FINE WITH   

01:06:37.495 --> 01:06:38.293
OF WHEN I KNOW OF MANY PROJECTS 
THAT ARE DOING JUST FINE WITH   
THAT THAT ARE USING THESE KINDS 

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:38.895
THAT ARE DOING JUST FINE WITH   
THAT THAT ARE USING THESE KINDS 
OF SYSTEMS QUITE WELL.          

01:06:38.897 --> 01:06:39.562
THAT THAT ARE USING THESE KINDS 
OF SYSTEMS QUITE WELL.          
&gt;&gt; HI, I&apos;M DIANE RAMOS.         

01:06:39.564 --> 01:06:40.362
OF SYSTEMS QUITE WELL.          
&gt;&gt; HI, I&apos;M DIANE RAMOS.         
I&apos;M WITH THE UNIVERSITY         

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.598
&gt;&gt; HI, I&apos;M DIANE RAMOS.         
I&apos;M WITH THE UNIVERSITY         
OF MICHIGAN CREDIT UNION.       

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.666
I&apos;M WITH THE UNIVERSITY         
OF MICHIGAN CREDIT UNION.       
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I WANTED   

01:06:43.668 --> 01:06:46.435
OF MICHIGAN CREDIT UNION.       
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I WANTED   
TO MAKE MENTION THAT WE HAVE    

01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:47.269
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I WANTED   
TO MAKE MENTION THAT WE HAVE    
TWO LOCATIONS WHERE WE DID DO   

01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:50.038
TO MAKE MENTION THAT WE HAVE    
TWO LOCATIONS WHERE WE DID DO   
THE HEAT PUMP SYSTEM AND WE DID 

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.377
TWO LOCATIONS WHERE WE DID DO   
THE HEAT PUMP SYSTEM AND WE DID 
THAT BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND 

01:06:54.379 --> 01:06:55.043
THE HEAT PUMP SYSTEM AND WE DID 
THAT BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND 
MAYBE TWENTY EIGHTEEN.          

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:56.178
THAT BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND 
MAYBE TWENTY EIGHTEEN.          
&gt;&gt; SO IT IS A SYSTEM THAT WE    

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.647
MAYBE TWENTY EIGHTEEN.          
&gt;&gt; SO IT IS A SYSTEM THAT WE    
DID EXPLORE.                    

01:06:58.649 --> 01:06:59.581
&gt;&gt; SO IT IS A SYSTEM THAT WE    
DID EXPLORE.                    
WE WOULD CONSIDER EXPLORING IT  

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:00.316
DID EXPLORE.                    
WE WOULD CONSIDER EXPLORING IT  
AGAIN WHEN WE DID IT AT THAT    

01:07:00.318 --> 01:07:01.984
WE WOULD CONSIDER EXPLORING IT  
AGAIN WHEN WE DID IT AT THAT    
TIME THE TECHNOLOGY WASN&apos;T      

01:07:01.986 --> 01:07:02.385
AGAIN WHEN WE DID IT AT THAT    
TIME THE TECHNOLOGY WASN&apos;T      
QUITE THERE.                    

01:07:02.387 --> 01:07:03.319
TIME THE TECHNOLOGY WASN&apos;T      
QUITE THERE.                    
WE WERE FAR AHEAD AND SO THOSE  

01:07:03.321 --> 01:07:06.155
QUITE THERE.                    
WE WERE FAR AHEAD AND SO THOSE  
SYSTEMS HAVE NOT WORKED         

01:07:06.157 --> 01:07:06.855
WE WERE FAR AHEAD AND SO THOSE  
SYSTEMS HAVE NOT WORKED         
PROPERLY AND SO THAT IS WHAT    

01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:09.892
SYSTEMS HAVE NOT WORKED         
PROPERLY AND SO THAT IS WHAT    
KIND OF HAS MADE OUR DECISION   

01:07:09.894 --> 01:07:10.793
PROPERLY AND SO THAT IS WHAT    
KIND OF HAS MADE OUR DECISION   
TO GO REVERT BACK TO THE        

01:07:10.795 --> 01:07:13.596
KIND OF HAS MADE OUR DECISION   
TO GO REVERT BACK TO THE        
TRADITIONAL MECHANICAL SYSTEMS  

01:07:13.598 --> 01:07:13.796
TO GO REVERT BACK TO THE        
TRADITIONAL MECHANICAL SYSTEMS  
.                               

01:07:13.798 --> 01:07:14.663
TRADITIONAL MECHANICAL SYSTEMS  
.                               
SO IT DOESN&apos;T MEAN THAT WE&apos;RE   

01:07:14.665 --> 01:07:17.933
.                               
SO IT DOESN&apos;T MEAN THAT WE&apos;RE   
NOT WILLING TO GO THAT ROUTE    

01:07:17.935 --> 01:07:18.735
SO IT DOESN&apos;T MEAN THAT WE&apos;RE   
NOT WILLING TO GO THAT ROUTE    
AND LOOK AT IT AGAIN IF THAT&apos;S  

01:07:18.737 --> 01:07:19.268
NOT WILLING TO GO THAT ROUTE    
AND LOOK AT IT AGAIN IF THAT&apos;S  
SOMETHING THAT THE              

01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:21.370
AND LOOK AT IT AGAIN IF THAT&apos;S  
SOMETHING THAT THE              
COMMISSIONERS WOULD REQUEST     

01:07:21.372 --> 01:07:21.904
SOMETHING THAT THE              
COMMISSIONERS WOULD REQUEST     
THAT WE DO.                     

01:07:21.906 --> 01:07:23.105
COMMISSIONERS WOULD REQUEST     
THAT WE DO.                     
BUT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, WE    

01:07:23.107 --> 01:07:24.907
THAT WE DO.                     
BUT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, WE    
DID CONSIDER THAT FOR THIS      

01:07:24.909 --> 01:07:25.641
BUT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, WE    
DID CONSIDER THAT FOR THIS      
LOCATION BUT BECAUSE OF THE     

01:07:25.643 --> 01:07:28.778
DID CONSIDER THAT FOR THIS      
LOCATION BUT BECAUSE OF THE     
DIFFICULTIES WE DID HAVE IN THE 

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.578
LOCATION BUT BECAUSE OF THE     
DIFFICULTIES WE DID HAVE IN THE 
PAST IS WHY WE&apos;VE LOOKED AT     

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.948
DIFFICULTIES WE DID HAVE IN THE 
PAST IS WHY WE&apos;VE LOOKED AT     
GOING BACKWARDS SO I HOPE THAT  

01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:33.882
PAST IS WHY WE&apos;VE LOOKED AT     
GOING BACKWARDS SO I HOPE THAT  
HELPS A LITTLE BIT CLARIFY SOME 

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:36.485
GOING BACKWARDS SO I HOPE THAT  
HELPS A LITTLE BIT CLARIFY SOME 
OF THAT.                        

01:07:36.487 --> 01:07:37.687
HELPS A LITTLE BIT CLARIFY SOME 
OF THAT.

I DID FIND THAT DESCRIPTION     
OF VARIOUS MAINTENANCE AND      

01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:48.664
I DID FIND THAT DESCRIPTION

IS BEING GENERATED ON THESE     
STREETS SO THAT REDUCTION       
HAPPENS BECAUSE THOSE           

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:04.753

HAPPENS BECAUSE THOSE           
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VEHICLES    

01:17:04.755 --> 01:17:08.289
HAPPENS BECAUSE THOSE           
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VEHICLES    
ARE ALREADY TRAVELING DOWN

I I DON&apos;T PROFESS TO KNOW THE   
DETAILED HISTORY OF THIS        
OFFICE.                         

01:24:52.556 --> 01:24:53.221
DETAILED HISTORY OF THIS        
OFFICE.                         
WE HEARD SOME CALLERS WHO HAVE  

01:24:53.223 --> 01:24:55.424
OFFICE.                         
WE HEARD SOME CALLERS WHO HAVE  
EXPERIENCED THAT MY PERCEPTION  

01:24:55.426 --> 01:24:56.358
WE HEARD SOME CALLERS WHO HAVE  
EXPERIENCED THAT MY PERCEPTION  
IS THAT OFFICE HAS NOT BEEN     

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.627
EXPERIENCED THAT MY PERCEPTION  
IS THAT OFFICE HAS NOT BEEN     
USED TO ITS FULL CAPACITY FOR   

01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:59.561
IS THAT OFFICE HAS NOT BEEN     
USED TO ITS FULL CAPACITY FOR   
SOME TIME AND SO EVEN THOUGH    

01:24:59.563 --> 01:25:02.597
USED TO ITS FULL CAPACITY FOR   
SOME TIME AND SO EVEN THOUGH    
THIS IS A SMALLER BUILDING WHEN 

01:25:02.599 --> 01:25:03.397
SOME TIME AND SO EVEN THOUGH    
THIS IS A SMALLER BUILDING WHEN 
COMPARING SOME OF THAT DATA     

01:25:03.399 --> 01:25:06.601
THIS IS A SMALLER BUILDING WHEN 
COMPARING SOME OF THAT DATA     
THAT DATA IS SOMEWHAT BLYER TO  

01:25:06.603 --> 01:25:07.402
COMPARING SOME OF THAT DATA     
THAT DATA IS SOMEWHAT BLYER TO  
THE ACTUAL UTILIZATION OF THAT  

01:25:07.404 --> 01:25:07.802
THAT DATA IS SOMEWHAT BLYER TO  
THE ACTUAL UTILIZATION OF THAT  
OFFICE.                         

01:25:07.804 --> 01:25:10.538
THE ACTUAL UTILIZATION OF THAT  
OFFICE.                         
IT IS AN OFFICE SQUARE FOOTAGE  

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.672
OFFICE.                         
IT IS AN OFFICE SQUARE FOOTAGE  
NUMBER THAT IS APPLIED FROM US  

01:25:11.674 --> 01:25:18.579
IT IS AN OFFICE SQUARE FOOTAGE  
NUMBER THAT IS APPLIED FROM US  
TRYING TO FIND MEASURABLE DATA  

01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:19.381
NUMBER THAT IS APPLIED FROM US  
TRYING TO FIND MEASURABLE DATA  
TO CONSIDER WHETHER THAT OFFICE 

01:25:19.383 --> 01:25:22.818
TRYING TO FIND MEASURABLE DATA  
TO CONSIDER WHETHER THAT OFFICE 
FRANKLY IS FULLY OCCUPIED OR    

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:23.618
TO CONSIDER WHETHER THAT OFFICE 
FRANKLY IS FULLY OCCUPIED OR    
IT&apos;S A TENTH OCCUPIED BECAUSE   

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.688
FRANKLY IS FULLY OCCUPIED OR    
IT&apos;S A TENTH OCCUPIED BECAUSE   
THE POTENTIAL IS THERE.         

01:25:26.690 --> 01:25:27.622
IT&apos;S A TENTH OCCUPIED BECAUSE   
THE POTENTIAL IS THERE.         
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER PIECE OF IT   

01:25:27.624 --> 01:25:28.290
THE POTENTIAL IS THERE.         
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER PIECE OF IT   
WHEN YOU&apos;RE COMPARING THIS,     

01:25:28.292 --> 01:25:29.624
SO THAT&apos;S ANOTHER PIECE OF IT   
WHEN YOU&apos;RE COMPARING THIS,     
THERE ARE SOME CHANGES INTO     

01:25:29.626 --> 01:25:30.759
WHEN YOU&apos;RE COMPARING THIS,     
THERE ARE SOME CHANGES INTO     
BOTH THE INFO, THE PEAKS, BUT   

01:25:30.761 --> 01:25:33.928
THERE ARE SOME CHANGES INTO     
BOTH THE INFO, THE PEAKS, BUT   
YOU&apos;RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT A LOT 

01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:34.663
BOTH THE INFO, THE PEAKS, BUT   
YOU&apos;RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT A LOT 
SMALLER SQUARE FOOTAGE JUST FOR 

01:25:34.665 --> 01:25:37.866
YOU&apos;RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT A LOT 
SMALLER SQUARE FOOTAGE JUST FOR 
THIS PORTION OF THE SITE.       

01:25:37.868 --> 01:25:38.934
SMALLER SQUARE FOOTAGE JUST FOR 
THIS PORTION OF THE SITE.       
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S COMPLEX THAT GETS TO 

01:25:38.936 --> 01:25:41.869
THIS PORTION OF THE SITE.       
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S COMPLEX THAT GETS TO 
THE NEXT PART THAT I LIKE THE   

01:25:41.871 --> 01:25:42.704
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S COMPLEX THAT GETS TO 
THE NEXT PART THAT I LIKE THE   
NEXT CASE THAT I WAS MAKING.    

01:25:42.706 --> 01:25:43.638
THE NEXT PART THAT I LIKE THE   
NEXT CASE THAT I WAS MAKING.    
AND SO JUST FOR PEOPLE TOO WHO  

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.373
NEXT CASE THAT I WAS MAKING.    
AND SO JUST FOR PEOPLE TOO WHO  
MAY NOT HAVE A STUDY LIKE IT&apos;S  

01:25:45.375 --> 01:25:48.543
AND SO JUST FOR PEOPLE TOO WHO  
MAY NOT HAVE A STUDY LIKE IT&apos;S  
COMPARING IT&apos;S SUGGESTING THAT  

01:25:48.545 --> 01:25:49.644
MAY NOT HAVE A STUDY LIKE IT&apos;S  
COMPARING IT&apos;S SUGGESTING THAT  
OVER THE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR   

01:25:49.646 --> 01:25:53.281
COMPARING IT&apos;S SUGGESTING THAT  
OVER THE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR   
PERIOD GENERAL OFFICE AT THE    

01:25:53.283 --> 01:25:54.082
OVER THE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR   
PERIOD GENERAL OFFICE AT THE    
SIZE OF WHAT&apos;S CURRENTLY ON THE 

01:25:54.084 --> 01:25:56.651
PERIOD GENERAL OFFICE AT THE    
SIZE OF WHAT&apos;S CURRENTLY ON THE 
SITE GENERATES FOUR HUNDRED AND 

01:25:56.653 --> 01:26:00.922
SIZE OF WHAT&apos;S CURRENTLY ON THE 
SITE GENERATES FOUR HUNDRED AND 
THIRTY SIX TRIPS WHERE AS FOR   

01:26:00.924 --> 01:26:01.790
SITE GENERATES FOUR HUNDRED AND 
THIRTY SIX TRIPS WHERE AS FOR   
THE BANK IT&apos;S FOUR HUNDRED AND  

01:26:01.792 --> 01:26:02.524
THIRTY SIX TRIPS WHERE AS FOR   
THE BANK IT&apos;S FOUR HUNDRED AND  
SEVENTY SIX LOOK REALLY CLOSE   

01:26:02.526 --> 01:26:05.193
THE BANK IT&apos;S FOUR HUNDRED AND  
SEVENTY SIX LOOK REALLY CLOSE   
BUT BECAUSE THE THE BUILDING IS 

01:26:05.195 --> 01:26:05.960
SEVENTY SIX LOOK REALLY CLOSE   
BUT BECAUSE THE THE BUILDING IS 
SO MUCH SMALLER LIKE THAT&apos;S     

01:26:05.962 --> 01:26:11.666
BUT BECAUSE THE THE BUILDING IS 
SO MUCH SMALLER LIKE THAT&apos;S     
WHERE OVERALL THIS IS A VERY    

01:26:11.668 --> 01:26:15.637
SO MUCH SMALLER LIKE THAT&apos;S     
WHERE OVERALL THIS IS A VERY    
TRIP INTENSIVE USE AND          

01:26:15.639 --> 01:26:16.571
WHERE OVERALL THIS IS A VERY    
TRIP INTENSIVE USE AND          
PARTICULARLY LIKE I JUST THINK  

01:26:16.573 --> 01:26:20.308
TRIP INTENSIVE USE AND          
PARTICULARLY LIKE I JUST THINK  
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO   

01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.642
PARTICULARLY LIKE I JUST THINK  
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO   
NAME HERE.                      

01:26:20.644 --> 01:26:24.011
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO   
NAME HERE.                      
IT&apos;S A WORK WE HAVE LESS SQUARE 

01:26:24.013 --> 01:26:24.680
NAME HERE.                      
IT&apos;S A WORK WE HAVE LESS SQUARE 
FOOTAGE NOW BUT IT JUST TENDS   

01:26:24.682 --> 01:26:27.915
IT&apos;S A WORK WE HAVE LESS SQUARE 
FOOTAGE NOW BUT IT JUST TENDS   
TO BE A YOUTH THAT GENERATES    

01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:30.952
FOOTAGE NOW BUT IT JUST TENDS   
TO BE A YOUTH THAT GENERATES    
MORE TRIPS.                     

01:26:30.954 --> 01:26:31.920
TO BE A YOUTH THAT GENERATES    
MORE TRIPS.                     
AND SO THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS 

01:26:31.922 --> 01:26:32.520
MORE TRIPS.                     
AND SO THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT I&apos;M THINKING               

01:26:32.522 --> 01:26:35.190
AND SO THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT I&apos;M THINKING               
OF PARTICULARLY IN THIS SITE.   

01:26:35.192 --> 01:26:36.390
THAT I&apos;M THINKING               
OF PARTICULARLY IN THIS SITE.   
I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT&apos;S  

01:26:36.392 --> 01:26:39.261
OF PARTICULARLY IN THIS SITE.   
I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT&apos;S  
RELATED TO KIND OF TRAFFIC      

01:26:39.263 --> 01:26:39.861
I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT&apos;S  
RELATED TO KIND OF TRAFFIC      
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IS WAS     

01:26:39.863 --> 01:26:42.930
RELATED TO KIND OF TRAFFIC      
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IS WAS     
THERE ANY CONSIDERATION GIVEN   

01:26:42.932 --> 01:26:43.865
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IS WAS     
THERE ANY CONSIDERATION GIVEN   
TO CLOSE GIVEN TO CLOSING THE   

01:26:43.867 --> 01:26:47.502
THERE ANY CONSIDERATION GIVEN   
TO CLOSE GIVEN TO CLOSING THE   
PRAIRIE ROAD STREET WHAT IS IT  

01:26:47.504 --> 01:26:51.172
TO CLOSE GIVEN TO CLOSING THE   
PRAIRIE ROAD STREET WHAT IS IT  
EXIT ENTRANCE SINCE YOU HAVE    

01:26:51.174 --> 01:26:51.806
PRAIRIE ROAD STREET WHAT IS IT  
EXIT ENTRANCE SINCE YOU HAVE    
THE ONE OFF OF PLIMOTH.         

01:26:51.808 --> 01:26:58.347
EXIT ENTRANCE SINCE YOU HAVE    
THE ONE OFF OF PLIMOTH.         
&gt;&gt; SO I THINK                   

01:27:11.394 --> 01:27:14.429
              IT GOES BACK TO   
ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT MR.    
LINNETT HAD LEONARD HAD ALLUDED 

01:27:14.431 --> 01:27:15.229
ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT MR.    
LINNETT HAD LEONARD HAD ALLUDED 
TO IS THAT YOU KNOW, THAT NOT   

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:15.764
LINNETT HAD LEONARD HAD ALLUDED 
TO IS THAT YOU KNOW, THAT NOT   
ONLY THE TRIPS AND THE          

01:27:15.766 --> 01:27:16.498
TO IS THAT YOU KNOW, THAT NOT   
ONLY THE TRIPS AND THE          
GENERATION RATE BUT THE CURB    

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:17.231
ONLY THE TRIPS AND THE          
GENERATION RATE BUT THE CURB    
CUTS THE LOCATIONS AND THINGS   

01:27:17.233 --> 01:27:17.966
GENERATION RATE BUT THE CURB    
CUTS THE LOCATIONS AND THINGS   
LIKE MULTIPLE ACCESS POINTS FOR 

01:27:17.968 --> 01:27:18.767
CUTS THE LOCATIONS AND THINGS   
LIKE MULTIPLE ACCESS POINTS FOR 
EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND SAFETY.  

01:27:18.769 --> 01:27:19.367
LIKE MULTIPLE ACCESS POINTS FOR 
EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND SAFETY.  
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S ANOTHER       

01:27:19.369 --> 01:27:20.101
EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND SAFETY.  
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S ANOTHER       
REASON WHY THAT SECOND CURB CUT 

01:27:20.103 --> 01:27:24.673
SO I THINK THAT&apos;S ANOTHER       
REASON WHY THAT SECOND CURB CUT 
WAS MAINTAINED AND THEN AGAIN   

01:27:24.675 --> 01:27:25.474
REASON WHY THAT SECOND CURB CUT 
WAS MAINTAINED AND THEN AGAIN   
BACK TO THE OPTIONS.            

01:27:25.476 --> 01:27:25.940
WAS MAINTAINED AND THEN AGAIN   
BACK TO THE OPTIONS.            
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.                       

01:27:25.942 --> 01:27:29.277
BACK TO THE OPTIONS.            
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.                       
SO PUTTING EVERYTHING OUT INTO  

01:27:29.279 --> 01:27:32.780
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.                       
SO PUTTING EVERYTHING OUT INTO  
ONE AND ONTO ONE ACCESS POINT   

01:27:32.782 --> 01:27:33.582
SO PUTTING EVERYTHING OUT INTO  
ONE AND ONTO ONE ACCESS POINT   
ON ONE STREET REALLY MAKES      

01:27:33.584 --> 01:27:36.684
ONE AND ONTO ONE ACCESS POINT   
ON ONE STREET REALLY MAKES      
THINGS A LOT MORE CONGESTED     

01:27:36.686 --> 01:27:37.519
ON ONE STREET REALLY MAKES      
THINGS A LOT MORE CONGESTED     
WITH THE TWO ACCESS POINTS.     

01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:41.289
THINGS A LOT MORE CONGESTED     
WITH THE TWO ACCESS POINTS.     
YES, PEOPLE MIGHT BE AND        

01:27:41.291 --> 01:27:45.493
WITH THE TWO ACCESS POINTS.     
YES, PEOPLE MIGHT BE AND        
PROBABLY ARE MORE INCLINED TO   

01:27:45.495 --> 01:27:46.228
YES, PEOPLE MIGHT BE AND        
PROBABLY ARE MORE INCLINED TO   
COME OFF A PRAIRIE TO USE THE   

01:27:46.230 --> 01:27:48.897
PROBABLY ARE MORE INCLINED TO   
COME OFF A PRAIRIE TO USE THE   
DRIVE THROUGH BUT CERTAINLY     

01:27:48.899 --> 01:27:49.831
COME OFF A PRAIRIE TO USE THE   
DRIVE THROUGH BUT CERTAINLY     
HAVE THE OPTION OF GOING OUT TO 

01:27:49.833 --> 01:27:50.598
DRIVE THROUGH BUT CERTAINLY     
HAVE THE OPTION OF GOING OUT TO 
PLYMOUTH RATHER THAN GOING BACK 

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:55.069
HAVE THE OPTION OF GOING OUT TO 
PLYMOUTH RATHER THAN GOING BACK 
OUT TO PRAIRIE.                 

01:27:55.071 --> 01:27:56.137
PLYMOUTH RATHER THAN GOING BACK 
OUT TO PRAIRIE.                 
&gt;&gt; SO THERE&apos;S A FEW THINGS THAT 

01:27:56.139 --> 01:27:59.140
OUT TO PRAIRIE.                 
&gt;&gt; SO THERE&apos;S A FEW THINGS THAT 
YEAH AND I I WAS SO I GUESS     

01:27:59.142 --> 01:28:00.074
&gt;&gt; SO THERE&apos;S A FEW THINGS THAT 
YEAH AND I I WAS SO I GUESS     
THIS IS A QUESTION TO FIRST OFF 

01:28:00.076 --> 01:28:03.244
YEAH AND I I WAS SO I GUESS     
THIS IS A QUESTION TO FIRST OFF 
IF YOU KNOW MR. CHENG, IF       

01:28:03.246 --> 01:28:04.044
THIS IS A QUESTION TO FIRST OFF 
IF YOU KNOW MR. CHENG, IF       
DURING CONVERSATION ARE THE TWO 

01:28:04.046 --> 01:28:07.114
IF YOU KNOW MR. CHENG, IF       
DURING CONVERSATION ARE THE TWO 
CURB CUTS SOMETHING THAT FIRE   

01:28:07.116 --> 01:28:10.285
DURING CONVERSATION ARE THE TWO 
CURB CUTS SOMETHING THAT FIRE   
DEPARTMENT S REQUESTS LIKE HOW  

01:28:10.287 --> 01:28:11.085
CURB CUTS SOMETHING THAT FIRE   
DEPARTMENT S REQUESTS LIKE HOW

01:28:11.087 --> 01:28:11.686
DEPARTMENT S REQUESTS LIKE HOW

WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE?           

01:28:11.688 --> 01:28:14.622
DOES WHAT DOES THAT TELL US     
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE?           
I DIDN&apos;T ASK THAT SPECIFIC      

01:28:14.624 --> 01:28:15.357
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE?           
I DIDN&apos;T ASK THAT SPECIFIC      
QUESTION TO THE FIRE MARSHAL AS 

01:28:15.359 --> 01:28:18.025
I DIDN&apos;T ASK THAT SPECIFIC      
QUESTION TO THE FIRE MARSHAL AS

01:28:18.027 --> 01:28:18.893
QUESTION TO THE FIRE MARSHAL AS

I DID HAVE AN EXTENSIVE         

01:28:18.895 --> 01:28:21.863
FAR AS ACCESS AROUND THE SITE.  
I DID HAVE AN EXTENSIVE         
CONVERSATION WITH THE           

01:28:21.865 --> 01:28:22.597
I DID HAVE AN EXTENSIVE         
CONVERSATION WITH THE           
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER TODAY   

01:28:22.599 --> 01:28:23.264
CONVERSATION WITH THE           
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER TODAY   
AND I THINK MR. LEONARD         

01:28:23.266 --> 01:28:25.734
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER TODAY   
AND I THINK MR. LEONARD         
ACTUALLY COVERED A LOT OF THE   

01:28:25.736 --> 01:28:26.834
AND I THINK MR. LEONARD         
ACTUALLY COVERED A LOT OF THE   
ITEMS THAT I SPOKE WITH WITH    

01:28:26.836 --> 01:28:30.238
ACTUALLY COVERED A LOT OF THE   
ITEMS THAT I SPOKE WITH WITH    
THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER AND 

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.774
ITEMS THAT I SPOKE WITH WITH    
THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER AND 
I&apos;M GOING TO GENERALIZE THIS    

01:28:32.776 --> 01:28:33.842
THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER AND 
I&apos;M GOING TO GENERALIZE THIS    
BUT THE CURB CUT OFF PLYMOUTH   

01:28:33.844 --> 01:28:37.311
I&apos;M GOING TO GENERALIZE THIS    
BUT THE CURB CUT OFF PLYMOUTH   
ROAD WILL OPERATE SIMILARLY AS  

01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:37.779
BUT THE CURB CUT OFF PLYMOUTH   
ROAD WILL OPERATE SIMILARLY AS  
IT DOES NOW.                    

01:28:37.781 --> 01:28:38.579
ROAD WILL OPERATE SIMILARLY AS  
IT DOES NOW.                    
SO THEY HAVE MOVED IT ONE       

01:28:38.581 --> 01:28:41.048
IT DOES NOW.                    
SO THEY HAVE MOVED IT ONE       
HUNDRED FEET TO THE EAST.       

01:28:41.050 --> 01:28:41.950
SO THEY HAVE MOVED IT ONE       
HUNDRED FEET TO THE EAST.       
HE SAYS THAT THAT&apos;S GOING TO    

01:28:41.952 --> 01:28:42.484
HUNDRED FEET TO THE EAST.       
HE SAYS THAT THAT&apos;S GOING TO    
OPERATE SIMILARLY.              

01:28:42.486 --> 01:28:45.420
HE SAYS THAT THAT&apos;S GOING TO    
OPERATE SIMILARLY.              
HE ALSO STATED IT&apos;S A FAIR      

01:28:45.422 --> 01:28:46.087
OPERATE SIMILARLY.

SO I THINK THAT THOSE THINGS

&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS    
FOR THE FUTURE AND IDLING CARS  

01:45:55.584 --> 01:45:56.716
&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS    
FOR THE FUTURE AND IDLING CARS  
AND A DENSITY OF ONE ONE CAR    

01:45:56.718 --> 01:46:00.353
FOR THE FUTURE AND IDLING CARS  
AND A DENSITY OF ONE ONE CAR    
TRIP PER 10 SQUARE FEET IS NOT  

01:46:00.355 --> 01:46:03.423
AND A DENSITY OF ONE ONE CAR    
TRIP PER 10 SQUARE FEET IS NOT  
THE FUTURE.

01:47:00.415 --> 01:47:01.081
HALF INCHES I THINK THAT&apos;S A    
TYPO BUT IT SHOWS THE LACK      
OF THOROUGHNESS OF THIS PROJECT 

01:47:01.083 --> 01:47:03.550
TYPO BUT IT SHOWS THE LACK      
OF THOROUGHNESS OF THIS PROJECT 
BOTH IN UNDERSTANDING COMMUNITY 

01:47:03.552 --> 01:47:04.218
OF THOROUGHNESS OF THIS PROJECT 
BOTH IN UNDERSTANDING COMMUNITY 
GOALS AND ENGINEERING.          

01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:07.154
BOTH IN UNDERSTANDING COMMUNITY 
GOALS AND ENGINEERING.          
&gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE TWENTY TWO AND A  

01:47:07.156 --> 01:47:07.955
GOALS AND ENGINEERING.          
&gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE TWENTY TWO AND A  
HALF INCHES FEET OF INGRESS,    

01:47:07.957 --> 01:47:11.325
&gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE TWENTY TWO AND A  
HALF INCHES FEET OF INGRESS,    
EGRESS ON THE EASTERN SIDE      

01:47:11.327 --> 01:47:11.792
HALF INCHES FEET OF INGRESS,    
EGRESS ON THE EASTERN SIDE      
OF THE PARCEL.                  

01:47:11.794 --> 01:47:14.961
EGRESS ON THE EASTERN SIDE      
OF THE PARCEL.                  
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE DO NOT   

01:47:14.963 --> 01:47:15.863
OF THE PARCEL.                  
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE DO NOT   
HAVE A CURB CUT FOR PARCEL TO   

01:47:15.865 --> 01:47:19.199
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE DO NOT   
HAVE A CURB CUT FOR PARCEL TO   
PARCEL TO IF THE REASONING IS   

01:47:19.201 --> 01:47:22.770
HAVE A CURB CUT FOR PARCEL TO   
PARCEL TO IF THE REASONING IS   
SIMILAR TO THIS PARCEL MAY NEED 

01:47:22.772 --> 01:47:23.503
PARCEL TO IF THE REASONING IS   
SIMILAR TO THIS PARCEL MAY NEED 
TO CURB CUTS BUT THE INGRESS    

01:47:23.505 --> 01:47:25.973
SIMILAR TO THIS PARCEL MAY NEED 
TO CURB CUTS BUT THE INGRESS    
EGRESS DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE   

01:47:25.975 --> 01:47:26.506
TO CURB CUTS BUT THE INGRESS    
EGRESS DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE   
PRAIRIE KAPUTT.                 

01:47:26.508 --> 01:47:27.241
EGRESS DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE   
PRAIRIE KAPUTT.                 
SO IF WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT HOW   

01:47:27.243 --> 01:47:30.143
PRAIRIE KAPUTT.                 
SO IF WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT HOW   
TRASH AND FIRE TRUCKS NEED TO   

01:47:30.145 --> 01:47:30.944
SO IF WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT HOW   
TRASH AND FIRE TRUCKS NEED TO   
MOVE THAT INGRESS EGRESS NEEDS  

01:47:30.946 --> 01:47:33.414
TRASH AND FIRE TRUCKS NEED TO   
MOVE THAT INGRESS EGRESS NEEDS  
TO CONTINUE ALL THE WAY AROUND  

01:47:33.416 --> 01:47:34.380
MOVE THAT INGRESS EGRESS NEEDS  
TO CONTINUE ALL THE WAY AROUND  
SO IT&apos;S SHORT SIGHTED THAT      

01:47:34.382 --> 01:47:38.552
TO CONTINUE ALL THE WAY AROUND  
SO IT&apos;S SHORT SIGHTED THAT      
PARCEL IF WE DO IF WE DO REZONE 

01:47:38.554 --> 01:47:45.025
SO IT&apos;S SHORT SIGHTED THAT      
PARCEL IF WE DO IF WE DO REZONE 
TO TAKE ONE PARCEL TO           

01:47:58.473 --> 01:48:00.541
                      NOW HAS A 
CONFLICTING LAND USE SANDWICHED 
BETWEEN TWO DRIVE THRU          

01:48:00.543 --> 01:48:01.008
CONFLICTING LAND USE SANDWICHED 
BETWEEN TWO DRIVE THRU          
BUILDINGS.

BETWEEN TWO DRIVE THRU          
BUILDINGS.                      
SO WE HAVE 15 FOOT CONFLICTING  

01:48:01.743 --> 01:48:02.409
BUILDINGS.                      
SO WE HAVE 15 FOOT CONFLICTING  
LAND USE ON THE EAST SIDE AND   

01:48:02.411 --> 01:48:02.942
SO WE HAVE 15 FOOT CONFLICTING  
LAND USE ON THE EAST SIDE AND   
THE WEST SIDE.                  

01:48:02.944 --> 01:48:03.710
LAND USE ON THE EAST SIDE AND   
THE WEST SIDE.                  
WE&apos;VE GOT A 30 FOOT BUFFER IN   

01:48:03.712 --> 01:48:04.378
THE WEST SIDE.                  
WE&apos;VE GOT A 30 FOOT BUFFER IN   
THE BACK PLUS YOU&apos;VE ALREADY

OVERLAID A TEN FOOT EASEMENT    

01:48:05.114 --> 01:48:05.912
THE BACK PLUS YOU&apos;VE ALREADY    
OVERLAID A TEN FOOT EASEMENT    
MAINTENANCE SO THAT ADDS UP TO  

01:48:05.914 --> 01:48:06.713
OVERLAID A TEN FOOT EASEMENT    
MAINTENANCE SO THAT ADDS UP TO  
40 FEET ALONG A NARROW PARCEL   

01:48:06.715 --> 01:48:07.381
MAINTENANCE SO THAT ADDS UP TO  
40 FEET ALONG A NARROW PARCEL   
THAT IS UNDEVELOPED DEVELOPABLE 

01:48:07.383 --> 01:48:08.114
40 FEET ALONG A NARROW PARCEL   
THAT IS UNDEVELOPED DEVELOPABLE 
IF WE PRIORITIZE RESIDENTIAL    

01:48:08.116 --> 01:48:08.849
THAT IS UNDEVELOPED DEVELOPABLE 
IF WE PRIORITIZE RESIDENTIAL

I DREW THIS THING IT TOOK ME    
THIRTY MINUTES TO NOT TAKE A    

01:48:33.241 --> 01:48:33.974
I DREW THIS THING IT TOOK ME    
THIRTY MINUTES TO NOT TAKE A    
LOT OF EFFORT TO SAY WHAT DOES

MAKE ME FIT IN THE GROUND AND   
THEN MAYBE COULD THE            
DRIVESAVERS GO AND LIKE THROUGH

DOWN AGAIN BASED ON OUR GOALS   
ARE PUBLISHED GOALS THAT WE&apos;VE  

01:48:59.168 --> 01:48:59.867
DOWN AGAIN BASED ON OUR GOALS   
ARE PUBLISHED GOALS THAT WE&apos;VE  
ADOPTED FOR YEARS AND THAT IT   

01:48:59.869 --> 01:49:02.936
ARE PUBLISHED GOALS THAT WE&apos;VE  
ADOPTED FOR YEARS AND THAT IT   
DOESN&apos;T DESERVE AN EXCEPTION.   

01:49:02.938 --> 01:49:06.039
ADOPTED FOR YEARS AND THAT IT   
DOESN&apos;T DESERVE AN EXCEPTION.   
THIS IS NOT EXCEPTIONAL AND I   

01:49:06.041 --> 01:49:06.807
DOESN&apos;T DESERVE AN EXCEPTION.   
THIS IS NOT EXCEPTIONAL AND I   
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING

REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING   
USES THAT BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY 
ON THE SITE                     

01:49:16.484 --> 01:49:28.628

I THINK MY SECOND SPECIAL       
EXCEPTION USE CASE AND SO AGAIN 

01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:29.897
I THINK MY SECOND SPECIAL

THE POINTS BUT I WONDER IF      

01:49:36.905 --> 01:49:40.474
UDC PULLED UP AND I READ ALL    
THE POINTS BUT I WONDER IF      
THOSE WOULD BE IF SOMEONE COULD 

01:49:40.476 --> 01:49:43.944
THE POINTS BUT I WONDER IF      
THOSE WOULD BE IF SOMEONE COULD 
PUT THEM IN OTHER WORDS THEN    

01:49:43.946 --> 01:49:48.047
THOSE WOULD BE IF SOMEONE COULD

THESE ARE GREAT ANSWERS.        
THEY MAY BE BLACK AND WHITE TO

YOU ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER    
BUT I DON&apos;T THINK THAT THEY ARE 
DATA DRIVEN ANSWERS THE WAY     

01:50:24.119 --> 01:50:26.586
BUT I DON&apos;T THINK THAT THEY ARE

SITE IS IS THE BUILDING MEETING 
THE SET BACK IS THE BUILDING    

01:50:27.388 --> 01:50:30.123
SITE IS IS THE BUILDING MEETING 
THE SET BACK IS THE BUILDING    
PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE CURB  

01:50:30.125 --> 01:50:30.824
THE SET BACK IS THE BUILDING

02:31:49.035 --> 02:31:51.235
VARIOUS SHADES OF PINK ARE      
PROPERTIES THAT ARE ZONED D ONE 
OR TWO BUT THEY ARE INELIGIBLE  

02:31:51.237 --> 02:31:51.702
PROPERTIES THAT ARE ZONED D ONE

FOR PREMIUMS AND THAT ACTUALLY  

02:32:11.424 --> 02:32:14.826
ONE OR D TWO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE   
FOR PREMIUMS AND THAT ACTUALLY  
EQUATES OVER FIFTY PERCENT      

02:32:14.828 --> 02:32:15.926
FOR PREMIUMS AND THAT ACTUALLY  
EQUATES OVER FIFTY PERCENT      
OF THE TOTAL LAND AREA IN THE

EQUATES OVER FIFTY PERCENT      
OF THE TOTAL LAND AREA IN THE   
DOWNTOWN AND SO WE&apos;RE NOT       

02:32:18.864 --> 02:32:22.733

WHAT&apos;S GOING ON IN THAT WE      

02:35:27.486 --> 02:35:30.821
THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS CAPTURE  
WHAT&apos;S GOING ON IN THAT WE      
AGREE THAT WE&apos;RE WORKING OFF    

02:35:30.823 --> 02:35:31.255
WHAT&apos;S GOING ON IN THAT WE

LIST THAT I READ OUT AND THAT&apos;S 
BEEN PRESENTED TO YOU THAT YOU  
DO NOT AGREE WITH?              

02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:46.069
BEEN PRESENTED TO YOU THAT YOU  
DO NOT AGREE WITH?              
OK, SO YOU WANT TO CALL OR YOU  

02:35:46.071 --> 02:35:46.603
DO NOT AGREE WITH?              
OK, SO YOU WANT TO CALL OR YOU  
WANT ME TO GO?

OK, SO YOU WANT TO CALL OR YOU  
WANT ME TO GO?                  
NO, YOU GO AHEAD.

NO, YOU GO AHEAD.               
OK, GO AHEAD.                   
YEAH, I SAW COMMISSIONER ONE    

02:35:49.008 --> 02:35:50.274
OK, GO AHEAD.                   
YEAH, I SAW COMMISSIONER ONE    
OF THESE HANDS FIRST AND THEN I 

02:35:50.276 --> 02:35:51.008
YEAH, I SAW COMMISSIONER ONE    
OF THESE HANDS FIRST AND THEN I 
SAW TO SO WE&apos;RE GOING TO WORK   

02:35:51.010 --> 02:35:57.915
OF THESE HANDS FIRST AND THEN I 
SAW TO SO WE&apos;RE GOING TO WORK   
THIS WAY A OK I HAD A I GUESS   

02:35:57.917 --> 02:35:58.849
SAW TO SO WE&apos;RE GOING TO WORK   
THIS WAY A OK I HAD A I GUESS   
THE FIRST ONE WAS THE BALANCE   

02:35:58.851 --> 02:35:59.517
THIS WAY A OK I HAD A I GUESS   
THE FIRST ONE WAS THE BALANCE   
OF LAND USES AND THE TERM       

02:35:59.519 --> 02:36:02.319
THE FIRST ONE WAS THE BALANCE   
OF LAND USES AND THE TERM       
BALANCE AND WAS INTENDED BY     

02:36:02.321 --> 02:36:06.189
OF LAND USES AND THE TERM       
BALANCE AND WAS INTENDED BY     
THAT SO THE IDEA OF BALANCE IS  

02:36:06.191 --> 02:36:09.760
BALANCE AND WAS INTENDED BY     
THAT SO THE IDEA OF BALANCE IS  
THAT THERE&apos;S A VARIETY AND THAT 

02:36:09.762 --> 02:36:10.861
THAT SO THE IDEA OF BALANCE IS  
THAT THERE&apos;S A VARIETY AND THAT 
THEY WORK AND THEY WORK IN      

02:36:10.863 --> 02:36:13.263
THAT THERE&apos;S A VARIETY AND THAT 
THEY WORK AND THEY WORK IN      
SYNCHRONICITY WITH ONE ANOTHER  

02:36:13.265 --> 02:36:13.998
THEY WORK AND THEY WORK IN      
SYNCHRONICITY WITH ONE ANOTHER  
AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE     

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.667
SYNCHRONICITY WITH ONE ANOTHER  
AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE     
RIGHT BALANCE FOR THE DOWNTOWN  

02:36:16.669 --> 02:36:17.601
AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE     
RIGHT BALANCE FOR THE DOWNTOWN  
TO WORK WELL AND RESIDENTIAL IS 

02:36:17.603 --> 02:36:18.268
RIGHT BALANCE FOR THE DOWNTOWN  
TO WORK WELL AND RESIDENTIAL IS 
A CORE COMPONENT OF THAT.       

02:36:18.270 --> 02:36:20.971
TO WORK WELL AND RESIDENTIAL IS 
A CORE COMPONENT OF THAT.       
&gt;&gt; SO DOES THAT MEAN LIKE KIND  

02:36:20.973 --> 02:36:21.739
A CORE COMPONENT OF THAT.       
&gt;&gt; SO DOES THAT MEAN LIKE KIND  
OF ON A METRIC SCALE LIKE THE   

02:36:21.741 --> 02:36:24.708
&gt;&gt; SO DOES THAT MEAN LIKE KIND  
OF ON A METRIC SCALE LIKE THE   
THERE&apos;S RATIOS TO THE AMOUNT    

02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:25.642
OF ON A METRIC SCALE LIKE THE   
THERE&apos;S RATIOS TO THE AMOUNT    
OF OFFICE COMMERCIAL LIKE IS AN 

02:36:25.644 --> 02:36:27.845
THERE&apos;S RATIOS TO THE AMOUNT    
OF OFFICE COMMERCIAL LIKE IS AN 
INDUSTRY PRACTICE THAT BALANCES 

02:36:27.847 --> 02:36:28.645
OF OFFICE COMMERCIAL LIKE IS AN 
INDUSTRY PRACTICE THAT BALANCES 
OUT SO THEY WORK.               

02:36:28.647 --> 02:36:29.045
INDUSTRY PRACTICE THAT BALANCES 
OUT SO THEY WORK.               
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        

02:36:29.047 --> 02:36:32.516
OUT SO THEY WORK.               
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
AND THE OFFICE SNAPSHOT THE     

02:36:32.518 --> 02:36:33.284
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
AND THE OFFICE SNAPSHOT THE     
DOWNTOWN SNAPSHOT THAT YOU HAVE 

02:36:33.286 --> 02:36:35.986
AND THE OFFICE SNAPSHOT THE     
DOWNTOWN SNAPSHOT THAT YOU HAVE 
THE WORK SESSION ON YOUR NEXT   

02:36:35.988 --> 02:36:37.020
DOWNTOWN SNAPSHOT THAT YOU HAVE 
THE WORK SESSION ON YOUR NEXT   
MEETING THAT REPORT WE GET A    

02:36:37.022 --> 02:36:40.157
THE WORK SESSION ON YOUR NEXT   
MEETING THAT REPORT WE GET A    
PREVIEW OF IT THAT WILL DIG     

02:36:40.159 --> 02:36:40.958
MEETING THAT REPORT WE GET A    
PREVIEW OF IT THAT WILL DIG     
INTO THAT AND ACTUALLY IF YOU   

02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:44.328
PREVIEW OF IT THAT WILL DIG     
INTO THAT AND ACTUALLY IF YOU   
LOOK INTO THAT WHAT THEY SAY IS 

02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:47.564
INTO THAT AND ACTUALLY IF YOU   
LOOK INTO THAT WHAT THEY SAY IS 
THAT RESIDENTIAL AND DOWNTOWN   

02:36:47.566 --> 02:36:48.265
LOOK INTO THAT WHAT THEY SAY IS 
THAT RESIDENTIAL AND DOWNTOWN   
ANN ARBOR AS COMPARED TO        

02:36:48.267 --> 02:36:50.634
THAT RESIDENTIAL AND DOWNTOWN   
ANN ARBOR AS COMPARED TO        
SEVERAL OTHER COLLEGE CITIES    

02:36:50.636 --> 02:36:51.668
ANN ARBOR AS COMPARED TO        
SEVERAL OTHER COLLEGE CITIES    
DOWNTOWNS THE CITY DOES NOT     

02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:55.539
SEVERAL OTHER COLLEGE CITIES    
DOWNTOWNS THE CITY DOES NOT     
HAVE THE SAME RATIO A LOWER     

02:36:55.541 --> 02:36:59.110
DOWNTOWNS THE CITY DOES NOT     
HAVE THE SAME RATIO A LOWER     
RATIO OF RESIDENTIAL THAN MOST  

02:36:59.112 --> 02:36:59.710
HAVE THE SAME RATIO A LOWER     
RATIO OF RESIDENTIAL THAN MOST  
OF THESE OTHER TOWNS.           

02:36:59.712 --> 02:37:03.346
RATIO OF RESIDENTIAL THAN MOST  
OF THESE OTHER TOWNS.           
SO THE MAKES RESIDENTIAL THAT&apos;S 

02:37:03.348 --> 02:37:07.351
OF THESE OTHER TOWNS.           
SO THE MAKES RESIDENTIAL THAT&apos;S 
WHY WE SAID IT&apos;S A CORE USE IN  

02:37:07.353 --> 02:37:08.219
SO THE MAKES RESIDENTIAL THAT&apos;S 
WHY WE SAID IT&apos;S A CORE USE IN  
THE DOWNTOWN AND THEREFORE WHEN 

02:37:08.221 --> 02:37:10.621
WHY WE SAID IT&apos;S A CORE USE IN  
THE DOWNTOWN AND THEREFORE WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT THAT DATA YOU MIGHT 

02:37:10.623 --> 02:37:11.555
THE DOWNTOWN AND THEREFORE WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT THAT DATA YOU MIGHT 
ALSO BE SAYING TO YOURSELF      

02:37:11.557 --> 02:37:12.289
YOU LOOK AT THAT DATA YOU MIGHT 
ALSO BE SAYING TO YOURSELF      
MAYBE THEN THIS IS WHAT WE NEED 

02:37:12.291 --> 02:37:15.326
ALSO BE SAYING TO YOURSELF      
MAYBE THEN THIS IS WHAT WE NEED 
TO CONCENTRATE ON IN TERMS      

02:37:15.328 --> 02:37:18.996
MAYBE THEN THIS IS WHAT WE NEED 
TO CONCENTRATE ON IN TERMS      
OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT USES   

02:37:18.998 --> 02:37:19.729
TO CONCENTRATE ON IN TERMS      
OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT USES   
THE BALANCE OF THE USES IS      

02:37:19.731 --> 02:37:20.064
OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT USES   
THE BALANCE OF THE USES IS      
RIGHT.                          

02:37:20.066 --> 02:37:23.467
THE BALANCE OF THE USES IS      
RIGHT.                          
&gt;&gt; OK, I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY   

02:37:23.469 --> 02:37:24.135
RIGHT.                          
&gt;&gt; OK, I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY   
THAT I GUESS THERE&apos;S TWO        

02:37:24.137 --> 02:37:25.736
&gt;&gt; OK, I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY   
THAT I GUESS THERE&apos;S TWO        
CONCERNS.                       

02:37:25.738 --> 02:37:26.737
THAT I GUESS THERE&apos;S TWO        
CONCERNS.                       
I THINK THE BALANCE ON THE      

02:37:26.739 --> 02:37:27.738
CONCERNS.                       
I THINK THE BALANCE ON THE      
METRIC TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE IS 

02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:29.773
I THINK THE BALANCE ON THE      
METRIC TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE IS 
GOOD.                           

02:37:29.775 --> 02:37:30.675
METRIC TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE IS 
GOOD.                           
I THINK THE OTHER ASSUMPTION AT 

02:37:30.677 --> 02:37:31.809
GOOD.                           
I THINK THE OTHER ASSUMPTION AT 
LEAST FOR ME SO KIND OF OPEN TO 

02:37:31.811 --> 02:37:34.445
I THINK THE OTHER ASSUMPTION AT 
LEAST FOR ME SO KIND OF OPEN TO 
DISCUSSION IS IF WE&apos;RE TRYING   

02:37:34.447 --> 02:37:38.315
LEAST FOR ME SO KIND OF OPEN TO 
DISCUSSION IS IF WE&apos;RE TRYING   
TO MAKE ELIGIBLE BUILDING TO    

02:37:38.317 --> 02:37:42.286
DISCUSSION IS IF WE&apos;RE TRYING   
TO MAKE ELIGIBLE BUILDING TO    
KIND OF RIGHT SIZE THE ONE      

02:37:42.288 --> 02:37:42.820
TO MAKE ELIGIBLE BUILDING TO    
KIND OF RIGHT SIZE THE ONE      
MISSING PIECE INSTEAD           

02:37:42.822 --> 02:37:45.756
KIND OF RIGHT SIZE THE ONE      
MISSING PIECE INSTEAD           
OF LETTING EVERYTHING KIND      

02:37:45.758 --> 02:37:46.490
MISSING PIECE INSTEAD           
OF LETTING EVERYTHING KIND      
OF GROW IN BALANCE TOGETHER.    

02:37:46.492 --> 02:37:49.693
OF LETTING EVERYTHING KIND      
OF GROW IN BALANCE TOGETHER.    
&gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT  

02:37:49.695 --> 02:37:50.361
OF GROW IN BALANCE TOGETHER.    
&gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT  
WE&apos;RE NOT SAYING LIKE JUST      

02:37:50.363 --> 02:37:53.697
&gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT  
WE&apos;RE NOT SAYING LIKE JUST      
ENOUGH TO GET IT BALANCED BUT   

02:37:53.699 --> 02:37:54.631
WE&apos;RE NOT SAYING LIKE JUST      
ENOUGH TO GET IT BALANCED BUT   
MAYBE THAT WE&apos;RE OK WITH A      

02:37:54.633 --> 02:37:57.667
ENOUGH TO GET IT BALANCED BUT   
MAYBE THAT WE&apos;RE OK WITH A      
LITTLE BIT MORE OF EVERYTHING   

02:37:57.669 --> 02:37:58.469
MAYBE THAT WE&apos;RE OK WITH A      
LITTLE BIT MORE OF EVERYTHING   
AS LONG AS IT&apos;S CONSISTENTLY    

02:37:58.471 --> 02:38:01.571
LITTLE BIT MORE OF EVERYTHING   
AS LONG AS IT&apos;S CONSISTENTLY    
WORKING TOWARDS LIKE BALANCED   

02:38:01.573 --> 02:38:02.306
AS LONG AS IT&apos;S CONSISTENTLY    
WORKING TOWARDS LIKE BALANCED   
ZONING, INCENTIVIZING KIND

WORKING TOWARDS LIKE BALANCED   
ZONING, INCENTIVIZING KIND      
OF ALL THE DIFFERENT USES       

02:38:03.042 --> 02:38:04.975
ZONING, INCENTIVIZING KIND      
OF ALL THE DIFFERENT USES       
TOGETHER IF THAT MAKES SENSE.   

02:38:04.977 --> 02:38:06.476
OF ALL THE DIFFERENT USES       
TOGETHER IF THAT MAKES SENSE.   
&gt;&gt; OK, WHICH KIND OF LEADS ME   

02:38:06.478 --> 02:38:09.546

&gt;&gt; OK, WHICH KIND OF LEADS ME   
TO MY SECOND ONE I HAVE         

02:38:09.548 --> 02:38:10.247
&gt;&gt; OK, WHICH KIND OF LEADS ME   
TO MY SECOND ONE I HAVE         
CONCERNS ABOUT WHICH IS THE     

02:38:10.249 --> 02:38:12.883
TO MY SECOND ONE I HAVE         
CONCERNS ABOUT WHICH IS THE     
MARKET AND MISSING MIDDLE AND   

02:38:12.885 --> 02:38:13.684
CONCERNS ABOUT WHICH IS THE     
MARKET AND MISSING MIDDLE AND   
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE MISSING MIDDLE 

02:38:13.686 --> 02:38:16.720
MARKET AND MISSING MIDDLE AND   
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE MISSING MIDDLE 
I DON&apos;T THINK IS THE DENSITY    

02:38:16.722 --> 02:38:17.688
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE MISSING MIDDLE 
I DON&apos;T THINK IS THE DENSITY    
ALL OF DOWNTOWN BETWEEN D1, D2  

02:38:17.690 --> 02:38:21.391
I DON&apos;T THINK IS THE DENSITY    
ALL OF DOWNTOWN BETWEEN D1, D2  
AND THEN TCW AND I THINK        

02:38:21.393 --> 02:38:22.293
ALL OF DOWNTOWN BETWEEN D1, D2  
AND THEN TCW AND I THINK        
MISSING FROM ALL OF THAT SPACE  

02:38:22.295 --> 02:38:24.961
AND THEN TCW AND I THINK        
MISSING FROM ALL OF THAT SPACE  
IN BETWEEN IT BECAUSE MISSING   

02:38:24.963 --> 02:38:27.798
MISSING FROM ALL OF THAT SPACE  
IN BETWEEN IT BECAUSE MISSING   
AT LEAST MY DEFINITION IS KIND  

02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:28.399
IN BETWEEN IT BECAUSE MISSING   
AT LEAST MY DEFINITION IS KIND  
OF LOW DENSITY MULTIFAMILY      

02:38:28.401 --> 02:38:32.236
AT LEAST MY DEFINITION IS KIND  
OF LOW DENSITY MULTIFAMILY      
HOUSING WHERE I THINK WHAT      

02:38:32.238 --> 02:38:32.970
OF LOW DENSITY MULTIFAMILY      
HOUSING WHERE I THINK WHAT      
WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT IS MORE     

02:38:32.972 --> 02:38:36.006
HOUSING WHERE I THINK WHAT      
WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT IS MORE     
HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT IN THE 

02:38:36.008 --> 02:38:36.774
WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT IS MORE     
HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
DOWNTOWN AND THEN KIND OF MID   

02:38:36.776 --> 02:38:39.976
HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
DOWNTOWN AND THEN KIND OF MID   
TO HIGH IN THE SUWON.           

02:38:39.978 --> 02:38:40.911
DOWNTOWN AND THEN KIND OF MID   
TO HIGH IN THE SUWON.           
SO THAT&apos;S AT LEAST A CONCERN    

02:38:40.913 --> 02:38:41.311
TO HIGH IN THE SUWON.           
SO THAT&apos;S AT LEAST A CONCERN    
FOR ME.                         

02:38:41.313 --> 02:38:44.347
SO THAT&apos;S AT LEAST A CONCERN    
FOR ME.                         
SO I WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE    

02:38:44.349 --> 02:38:45.182
FOR ME.                         
SO I WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE    
TABLE FOR DISCUSSION AS WELL AS 

02:38:45.184 --> 02:38:48.352
SO I WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE    
TABLE FOR DISCUSSION AS WELL AS 
HIGH END RESIDENTIAL AND I

HIGH END RESIDENTIAL AND I      
THINK THIS IS THE WORD THAT     

02:38:49.154 --> 02:38:51.721
HIGH END RESIDENTIAL AND I      
THINK THIS IS THE WORD THAT     
GETS THROWN AROUND A LOT.       

02:38:51.723 --> 02:38:52.723
THINK THIS IS THE WORD THAT     
GETS THROWN AROUND A LOT.       
&gt;&gt; I ACTUALLY DON&apos;T SEE MUCH    

02:38:52.725 --> 02:38:55.659
GETS THROWN AROUND A LOT.

HERE THAT I THINK WE CAN AGREE  
ON AS A BODY THAT WE SHOULD     
MAKE EXPLICIT TO EVERYONE ELSE  

03:04:34.432 --> 03:04:35.431
ON AS A BODY THAT WE SHOULD     
MAKE EXPLICIT TO EVERYONE ELSE  
IS THAT WE THINK THIS REGION IS 

03:04:35.433 --> 03:04:37.899

ARBOR PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS 
THAT ARE BEST WALKABLE IS       
MORSES DANIMAL THAN ELSEWHERE.  

03:04:48.979 --> 03:04:53.648
THAT ARE BEST WALKABLE IS       
MORSES DANIMAL THAN ELSEWHERE.  
OK, I WOULD ADD THAT THIS       

03:04:53.650 --> 03:04:57.453

LAST TIME AROUND WERE WE TALKED 
NOT ONLY ENERGY EFFICIENCY      

03:06:10.561 --> 03:06:13.629
LAST TIME AROUND WERE WE TALKED 
NOT ONLY ENERGY EFFICIENCY      
BUILDING BY BUILDING, WE TALKED 

03:06:13.631 --> 03:06:14.229
NOT ONLY ENERGY EFFICIENCY      
BUILDING BY BUILDING, WE TALKED 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE        

03:06:14.231 --> 03:06:17.666
BUILDING BY BUILDING, WE TALKED 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE        
DOWNTOWN OVERALL AND REMEMBER A 

03:06:17.668 --> 03:06:18.333
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE        
DOWNTOWN OVERALL AND REMEMBER A 
LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ABOUT     

03:06:18.335 --> 03:06:20.736
DOWNTOWN OVERALL AND REMEMBER A 
LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ABOUT     
DIFFERENT OPTIONS ON THOSE.     

03:06:20.738 --> 03:06:21.803
LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ABOUT     
DIFFERENT OPTIONS ON THOSE.     
AND SO IF THAT&apos;S PART OF A GOAL 

03:06:21.805 --> 03:06:24.339
DIFFERENT OPTIONS ON THOSE.

.                               
YOU COULD USE THOSE FRAME SAME  
FRAMES.                         

03:06:33.718 --> 03:06:36.384
YOU COULD USE THOSE FRAME SAME  
FRAMES.                         
IS IT BUILDING BY BUILDING OR   

03:06:36.386 --> 03:06:37.252
FRAMES.                         
IS IT BUILDING BY BUILDING OR   
IS IT THE DOWNTOWN OVERALL AND  

03:06:37.254 --> 03:06:40.556
IS IT BUILDING BY BUILDING OR   
IS IT THE DOWNTOWN OVERALL AND  
HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT&apos;S 

03:06:40.558 --> 03:06:41.356
IS IT THE DOWNTOWN OVERALL AND  
HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT&apos;S 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENERGY   

03:06:41.358 --> 03:06:44.359
HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT&apos;S 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENERGY   
EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY.  

03:06:44.361 --> 03:06:45.227
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENERGY   
EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY.  
SO WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY       

03:06:45.229 --> 03:06:45.961
EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY.  
SO WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY       
YOU&apos;RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE    

03:06:45.963 --> 03:06:49.197
SO WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY       
YOU&apos;RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE    
MEASURES OF THE EFFICIENCY      

03:06:49.199 --> 03:06:49.999
YOU&apos;RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE    
MEASURES OF THE EFFICIENCY      
OF THE ENERGY USE EITHER IN THE 

03:06:50.001 --> 03:06:52.468
MEASURES OF THE EFFICIENCY      
OF THE ENERGY USE EITHER IN THE 
DOWNTOWN OR IN THE BUILDING     

03:06:52.470 --> 03:06:52.868
OF THE ENERGY USE EITHER IN THE 
DOWNTOWN OR IN THE BUILDING     
ITSELF.                         

03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:53.335
DOWNTOWN OR IN THE BUILDING     
ITSELF.                         
WHEN YOU GET INTO               

03:06:53.337 --> 03:06:54.002
ITSELF.                         
WHEN YOU GET INTO               
SUSTAINABILITY YOU&apos;RE ALSO      

03:06:54.004 --> 03:06:56.572
WHEN YOU GET INTO               
SUSTAINABILITY YOU&apos;RE ALSO      
TALKING ABOUT LOCATION.         

03:06:56.574 --> 03:06:57.506
SUSTAINABILITY YOU&apos;RE ALSO      
TALKING ABOUT LOCATION.         
YOU&apos;RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT GREEN 

03:06:57.508 --> 03:07:01.176
TALKING ABOUT LOCATION.         
YOU&apos;RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT GREEN 
INFRASTRUCTURE.

YOU&apos;RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT       
TRANSIT.                        
SO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS    

03:07:05.182 --> 03:07:06.048
TRANSIT.                        
SO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS    
CAN COME INTO SUSTAINABILITY    

03:07:06.050 --> 03:07:06.815
SO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS    
CAN COME INTO SUSTAINABILITY    
OF WHICH ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS A 

03:07:06.817 --> 03:07:08.217
CAN COME INTO SUSTAINABILITY    
OF WHICH ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS A 
PART.                           

03:07:08.219 --> 03:07:09.552
OF WHICH ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS A 
PART.                           
BUT SO YOU COULD HAVE A GOAL    

03:07:09.554 --> 03:07:13.422
PART.                           
BUT SO YOU COULD HAVE A GOAL    
THAT AROUND ENERGY EFFICIENCY   

03:07:13.424 --> 03:07:16.859
BUT SO YOU COULD HAVE A GOAL    
THAT AROUND ENERGY EFFICIENCY   
AND AROUND SUSTAINABILITY AND   

03:07:16.861 --> 03:07:17.793
THAT AROUND ENERGY EFFICIENCY   
AND AROUND SUSTAINABILITY AND   
THOSE COULD BE LINKED BUT       

03:07:17.795 --> 03:07:18.527
AND AROUND SUSTAINABILITY AND   
THOSE COULD BE LINKED BUT       
THEY&apos;RE ACTUALLY PRETTY         

03:07:18.529 --> 03:07:20.495
THOSE COULD BE LINKED BUT       
THEY&apos;RE ACTUALLY PRETTY         
DIFFERENT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU&apos;RE 

03:07:20.497 --> 03:07:21.263
THEY&apos;RE ACTUALLY PRETTY         
DIFFERENT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU&apos;RE 
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT MEASURES.  

03:07:21.265 --> 03:07:25.534
DIFFERENT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU&apos;RE 
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT MEASURES.  
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE THREE REFLECTING ON 

03:07:25.536 --> 03:07:28.704
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT MEASURES.  
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE THREE REFLECTING ON 
YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND   

03:07:28.706 --> 03:07:32.441
&gt;&gt; SO THOSE THREE REFLECTING ON 
YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND   
IN TALKING TO STAFF SEEMED LIKE 

03:07:32.443 --> 03:07:33.442
YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND   
IN TALKING TO STAFF SEEMED LIKE 
THOSE ROSE TO THE TOP THAT      

03:07:33.444 --> 03:07:36.545
IN TALKING TO STAFF SEEMED LIKE 
THOSE ROSE TO THE TOP THAT      
THOSE WERE THREE THINGS THAT WE 

03:07:36.547 --> 03:07:40.349
THOSE ROSE TO THE TOP THAT      
THOSE WERE THREE THINGS THAT WE 
KNEW WERE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR   

03:07:40.351 --> 03:07:40.616
THOSE WERE THREE THINGS THAT WE 
KNEW WERE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR   
YOU.                            

03:07:40.618 --> 03:07:44.052
KNEW WERE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR   
YOU.                            
THESE OTHER THINGS CAME UP      

03:07:44.054 --> 03:07:44.887
YOU.                            
THESE OTHER THINGS CAME UP      
EITHER THAT YOU INCENTIVIZE     

03:07:44.889 --> 03:07:47.322
THESE OTHER THINGS CAME UP      
EITHER THAT YOU INCENTIVIZE     
THEM NOW THEIR GOAL NOW OR THEY 

03:07:47.324 --> 03:07:48.256
EITHER THAT YOU INCENTIVIZE     
THEM NOW THEIR GOAL NOW OR THEY 
WERE IN CASE STUDIES THAT WE    

03:07:48.258 --> 03:07:51.460
THEM NOW THEIR GOAL NOW OR THEY 
WERE IN CASE STUDIES THAT WE    
LOOKED AT PEDESTRIAN AMENITIES  

03:07:51.462 --> 03:07:52.260
WERE IN CASE STUDIES THAT WE    
LOOKED AT PEDESTRIAN AMENITIES  
AND ACTIVITIES THAT COULD BE    

03:07:52.262 --> 03:07:55.330
LOOKED AT PEDESTRIAN AMENITIES  
AND ACTIVITIES THAT COULD BE    
THE AMENITIES THAT YOU THAT     

03:07:55.332 --> 03:07:58.266
AND ACTIVITIES THAT COULD BE    
THE AMENITIES THAT YOU THAT     
THAT YOU INCENTIVIZE RIGHT NOW  

03:07:58.268 --> 03:07:59.168
THE AMENITIES THAT YOU THAT     
THAT YOU INCENTIVIZE RIGHT NOW  
MORE IT COULD BE ACTIVE FIRST   

03:07:59.170 --> 03:07:59.968
THAT YOU INCENTIVIZE RIGHT NOW  
MORE IT COULD BE ACTIVE FIRST   
FLOOR USE WHICH GETS TO SOME    

03:07:59.970 --> 03:08:02.404
MORE IT COULD BE ACTIVE FIRST

A LOT OF THESE IT&apos;S LIKE        

03:16:39.790 --> 03:16:42.657
PRESERVATION.                   
A LOT OF THESE IT&apos;S LIKE        
HOUSING WE WANT ENERGY          

03:16:42.659 --> 03:16:43.058
A LOT OF THESE IT&apos;S LIKE        
HOUSING WE WANT ENERGY          
EFFICIENCY.                     

03:16:43.060 --> 03:16:43.992
HOUSING WE WANT ENERGY          
EFFICIENCY.                     
WHAT IS WHAT IS THE HISTORIC    

03:16:43.994 --> 03:16:47.062
EFFICIENCY.                     
WHAT IS WHAT IS THE HISTORIC    
PRESERVATION COMPONENT OF SO IT 

03:16:47.064 --> 03:16:50.264
WHAT IS WHAT IS THE HISTORIC    
PRESERVATION COMPONENT OF SO IT 
WAS A METHOD TO HAVE HISTORIC   

03:16:50.266 --> 03:16:51.033
PRESERVATION COMPONENT OF SO IT 
WAS A METHOD TO HAVE HISTORIC   
BUILDINGS THERE OUTSIDE OF THE

WAS A METHOD TO HAVE HISTORIC   
BUILDINGS THERE OUTSIDE OF THE  
HISTORIC DISTRICT TO BE         

03:16:54.304 --> 03:16:58.005
BUILDINGS THERE OUTSIDE OF THE  
HISTORIC DISTRICT TO BE         
PRESERVED.                      

03:16:58.007 --> 03:16:58.940
HISTORIC DISTRICT TO BE         
PRESERVED.                      
SO THE EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE     

03:16:58.942 --> 03:16:59.741
PRESERVED.                      
SO THE EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE     
MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE OF WHERE 

03:16:59.743 --> 03:17:02.377
SO THE EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE     
MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE OF WHERE 
IT WAS USED IS A HOTEL WHERE    

03:17:02.379 --> 03:17:07.816
MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE OF WHERE 
IT WAS USED IS A HOTEL WHERE    
ZINGERMAN&apos;S AND THE BUSCOMBE    

03:17:07.818 --> 03:17:08.783
IT WAS USED IS A HOTEL WHERE    
ZINGERMAN&apos;S AND THE BUSCOMBE    
SOME IT WAS EXPRESSED TO ME     

03:17:08.785 --> 03:17:12.086
ZINGERMAN&apos;S AND THE BUSCOMBE    
SOME IT WAS EXPRESSED TO ME     
WHEN I WAS HELPING WITH THIS IN 

03:17:12.088 --> 03:17:15.957
SOME IT WAS EXPRESSED TO ME     
WHEN I WAS HELPING WITH THIS IN 
2013 SAME KIND OF PROCESS MANY  

03:17:15.959 --> 03:17:16.658
WHEN I WAS HELPING WITH THIS IN 
2013 SAME KIND OF PROCESS MANY  
HISTORIC PRESERVATION ADVOCATES 

03:17:16.660 --> 03:17:20.195
2013 SAME KIND OF PROCESS MANY  
HISTORIC PRESERVATION ADVOCATES 
FELT THAT THEY CALLED IT A      

03:17:20.197 --> 03:17:21.162
HISTORIC PRESERVATION ADVOCATES 
FELT THAT THEY CALLED IT A      
FACADE ECTOMY AND IT WAS NOT A  

03:17:21.164 --> 03:17:23.031
FELT THAT THEY CALLED IT A      
FACADE ECTOMY AND IT WAS NOT A  
TERM.                           

03:17:23.033 --> 03:17:26.768
FACADE ECTOMY AND IT WAS NOT A  
TERM.                           
SO THAT&apos;S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW I   

03:17:26.770 --> 03:17:27.369
TERM.                           
SO THAT&apos;S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW I   
HAVE BEEN USED.                 

03:17:27.371 --> 03:17:28.469
SO THAT&apos;S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW I   
HAVE BEEN USED.                 
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH STRONG   

03:17:28.471 --> 03:17:31.272
HAVE BEEN USED.                 
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH STRONG   
HISTORIC PRESERVATION RULES IN  

03:17:31.274 --> 03:17:31.940
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH STRONG   
HISTORIC PRESERVATION RULES IN  
YOUR HISTORIC DISTRICTS, I      

03:17:31.942 --> 03:17:34.609
HISTORIC PRESERVATION RULES IN  
YOUR HISTORIC DISTRICTS, I      
WOULD SAY THAT ITS TRACK RECORD 

03:17:34.611 --> 03:17:35.077
YOUR HISTORIC DISTRICTS, I      
WOULD SAY THAT ITS TRACK RECORD 
HAS BEEN SPOTTY.                

03:17:35.079 --> 03:17:38.179
WOULD SAY THAT ITS TRACK RECORD 
HAS BEEN SPOTTY.                
ALSO THE PREMIUM THAT WAS       

03:17:38.181 --> 03:17:38.980
HAS BEEN SPOTTY.                
ALSO THE PREMIUM THAT WAS       
OFFERED FOR IT WAS PRETTY       

03:17:38.982 --> 03:17:42.450
ALSO THE PREMIUM THAT WAS       
OFFERED FOR IT WAS PRETTY       
MINIMAL AND SO IT WASN&apos;T VERY   

03:17:42.452 --> 03:17:43.118
OFFERED FOR IT WAS PRETTY       
MINIMAL AND SO IT WASN&apos;T VERY   
OFTEN TAKEN SO THAT SOME        

03:17:43.120 --> 03:17:46.454
MINIMAL AND SO IT WASN&apos;T VERY   
OFTEN TAKEN SO THAT SOME        
BACKGROUND ON THAT I MEAN I     

03:17:46.456 --> 03:17:47.055
OFTEN TAKEN SO THAT SOME        
BACKGROUND ON THAT I MEAN I     
WOULDN&apos;T PRIORITIZE THAT.       

03:17:47.057 --> 03:17:53.428
BACKGROUND ON THAT I MEAN I     
WOULDN&apos;T PRIORITIZE THAT.       
OK, WELL MAYBE OK CONTEXT SURE. 

03:17:53.430 --> 03:17:57.432
WOULDN&apos;T PRIORITIZE THAT.       
OK, WELL MAYBE OK CONTEXT SURE. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE MOST SALIENT     

03:17:57.434 --> 03:18:01.135
OK, WELL MAYBE OK CONTEXT SURE. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE MOST SALIENT     
BOILED DOWN VERSION IS          

03:18:01.137 --> 03:18:01.803
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE MOST SALIENT     
BOILED DOWN VERSION IS          
SUSTAINABILITY, AFFORDABILITY,  

03:18:01.805 --> 03:18:05.406
BOILED DOWN VERSION IS          
SUSTAINABILITY, AFFORDABILITY,  
EQUITY QUALITY IN THE BUILT     

03:18:05.408 --> 03:18:05.807
SUSTAINABILITY, AFFORDABILITY,  
EQUITY QUALITY IN THE BUILT     
ENVIRONMENT.                    

03:18:05.809 --> 03:18:08.910
EQUITY QUALITY IN THE BUILT     
ENVIRONMENT.                    
THE ELEMENTS THAT I FIND        

03:18:08.912 --> 03:18:09.711

IS ONE THAT&apos;S NOT ON ITS LIST   

03:18:13.316 --> 03:18:14.116
SOMEWHAT MISSING HERE ACTUALLY  
IS ONE THAT&apos;S NOT ON ITS LIST   
WHICH IS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT   

03:18:14.118 --> 03:18:16.918
IS ONE THAT&apos;S NOT ON ITS LIST   
WHICH IS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT   
AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS    

03:18:16.920 --> 03:18:20.021
WHICH IS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT   
AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS    
THESE FOLKS NEED SOMEWHERE TO   

03:18:20.023 --> 03:18:20.721
AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS    
THESE FOLKS NEED SOMEWHERE TO   
GENERATE THEY NEED JOBS.        

03:18:20.723 --> 03:18:21.156
THESE FOLKS NEED SOMEWHERE TO   
GENERATE THEY NEED JOBS.

GENERATE THEY NEED JOBS.        
&gt;&gt; RIGHT?                       
I MEAN LIKE WE CAN BUILD ALL

03:18:32.136 --> 03:18:32.934
KNOW, WE&apos;LL TALK ABOUT THE      
PEDESTRIAN AMENITIES ACTIVITIES 
BECAUSE I TALKED ABOUT DOWNTOWN

03:36:49.064 --> 03:36:51.932
THERE WAS NO HEIGHT LIMIT IN    
THE DOWNTOWN THOSE DISTRICTS UP 
UNTIL 2009 AND MR. LEONARD WAS  

03:36:51.934 --> 03:36:55.668
THE DOWNTOWN THOSE DISTRICTS UP 
UNTIL 2009 AND MR. LEONARD WAS  
IS CORRECT THAT THE FIRST       

03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:58.705
UNTIL 2009 AND MR. LEONARD WAS  
IS CORRECT THAT THE FIRST       
OF THE MOST ITERATIONS OF D1    

03:36:58.707 --> 03:37:02.242
IS CORRECT THAT THE FIRST       
OF THE MOST ITERATIONS OF D1    
AND D2 HAD ALSO HAD NO HEIGHT   

03:37:02.244 --> 03:37:06.546
OF THE MOST ITERATIONS OF D1    
AND D2 HAD ALSO HAD NO HEIGHT   
LIMIT AND THE WAY THAT WE HAVE  

03:37:06.548 --> 03:37:10.150
AND D2 HAD ALSO HAD NO HEIGHT   
LIMIT AND THE WAY THAT WE HAVE  
A UNIQUE HYBRID KIND OF FORM BY 

03:37:10.152 --> 03:37:11.017
LIMIT AND THE WAY THAT WE HAVE  
A UNIQUE HYBRID KIND OF FORM BY 
ZONING BUT NOT REALLY FORM      

03:37:11.019 --> 03:37:13.220
A UNIQUE HYBRID KIND OF FORM BY 
ZONING BUT NOT REALLY FORM      
BASED ZONING FOR OUR D1 AND D2  

03:37:13.222 --> 03:37:14.421
ZONING BUT NOT REALLY FORM      
BASED ZONING FOR OUR D1 AND D2  
THE D1 AND D2 BASE ZONING       

03:37:14.423 --> 03:37:18.691
BASED ZONING FOR OUR D1 AND D2  
THE D1 AND D2 BASE ZONING       
DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED THE       

03:37:18.693 --> 03:37:19.459
THE D1 AND D2 BASE ZONING       
DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED THE       
PERMITTED USES THAT YOU CAN DO  

03:37:19.461 --> 03:37:22.129
DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED THE       
PERMITTED USES THAT YOU CAN DO  
AND SO THAT&apos;S FAIRLY UNIFORM    

03:37:22.131 --> 03:37:22.996
PERMITTED USES THAT YOU CAN DO  
AND SO THAT&apos;S FAIRLY UNIFORM    
BECAUSE THOSE ARE FAIRLY BROAD  

03:37:22.998 --> 03:37:26.099
AND SO THAT&apos;S FAIRLY UNIFORM    
BECAUSE THOSE ARE FAIRLY BROAD  
DOWNTOWN AND IT ESTABLISHES THE 

03:37:26.101 --> 03:37:27.034
BECAUSE THOSE ARE FAIRLY BROAD  
DOWNTOWN AND IT ESTABLISHES THE 
THE FLOOR AREA RATIO OF THE     

03:37:27.036 --> 03:37:30.270
DOWNTOWN AND IT ESTABLISHES THE 
THE FLOOR AREA RATIO OF THE     
SITE AND AND THEN THAT&apos;S THE    

03:37:30.272 --> 03:37:34.074
THE FLOOR AREA RATIO OF THE     
SITE AND AND THEN THAT&apos;S THE    
CHARACTER AREAS THAT KIND OF DO 

03:37:34.076 --> 03:37:37.744
SITE AND AND THEN THAT&apos;S THE    
CHARACTER AREAS THAT KIND OF DO 
THE FORM OF THAT AMOUNT         

03:37:37.746 --> 03:37:41.147
CHARACTER AREAS THAT KIND OF DO 
THE FORM OF THAT AMOUNT         
OF FLOOR AREA THAT YOU CAN DO   

03:37:41.149 --> 03:37:42.015
THE FORM OF THAT AMOUNT         
OF FLOOR AREA THAT YOU CAN DO   
AND THE CHARACTER AREAS THAT&apos;S  

03:37:42.017 --> 03:37:45.518
OF FLOOR AREA THAT YOU CAN DO   
AND THE CHARACTER AREAS THAT&apos;S  
WHAT HAS THE HEIGHT LIMIT.      

03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:48.354
AND THE CHARACTER AREAS THAT&apos;S  
WHAT HAS THE HEIGHT LIMIT.      
SOME OF THEM HAVE A MAXIMUM     

03:37:48.356 --> 03:37:49.389
WHAT HAS THE HEIGHT LIMIT.      
SOME OF THEM HAVE A MAXIMUM     
DIAGONAL AND THAT&apos;S THE SIDE    

03:37:49.391 --> 03:37:53.159
SOME OF THEM HAVE A MAXIMUM     
DIAGONAL AND THAT&apos;S THE SIDE    
AND YOUR SETBACKS AND THEN OUR  

03:37:53.161 --> 03:37:53.860
DIAGONAL AND THAT&apos;S THE SIDE    
AND YOUR SETBACKS AND THEN OUR  
FRONT SET BACKS ARE BASED ON    

03:37:53.862 --> 03:37:56.563
AND YOUR SETBACKS AND THEN OUR  
FRONT SET BACKS ARE BASED ON    
THE STREET CLASSIFICATION.      

03:37:56.565 --> 03:37:57.364
FRONT SET BACKS ARE BASED ON    
THE STREET CLASSIFICATION.      
SO THERE&apos;S THREE DIFFERENT      

03:37:57.366 --> 03:38:00.567
THE STREET CLASSIFICATION.      
SO THERE&apos;S THREE DIFFERENT      
SPOTS BUT WE HAVE A WE REGULATE 

03:38:00.569 --> 03:38:03.403
SO THERE&apos;S THREE DIFFERENT      
SPOTS BUT WE HAVE A WE REGULATE 
FAAT SO THAT&apos;S NOT FORMED BY    

03:38:03.405 --> 03:38:04.271
SPOTS BUT WE HAVE A WE REGULATE 
FAAT SO THAT&apos;S NOT FORMED BY    
ZONING VERY MUCH LIKE BUT WE    

03:38:04.273 --> 03:38:05.071
FAAT SO THAT&apos;S NOT FORMED BY    
ZONING VERY MUCH LIKE BUT WE    
ALSO HAVE CHARACTER AREAS THAT  

03:38:05.073 --> 03:38:08.075
ZONING VERY MUCH LIKE BUT WE    
ALSO HAVE CHARACTER AREAS THAT  
TELL HOW YOU MOWHOUSH AND SHAPE 

03:38:08.077 --> 03:38:11.945
ALSO HAVE CHARACTER AREAS THAT  
TELL HOW YOU MOWHOUSH AND SHAPE 
THAT DEVELOPMENT AND BUT THE AS 

03:38:11.947 --> 03:38:15.515
TELL HOW YOU MOWHOUSH AND SHAPE 
THAT DEVELOPMENT AND BUT THE AS 
MR. LEONARD MENTIONED THE SORT  

03:38:15.517 --> 03:38:16.450
THAT DEVELOPMENT AND BUT THE AS 
MR. LEONARD MENTIONED THE SORT  
OF KILLER IS THEN WE PUT A      

03:38:16.452 --> 03:38:19.452
MR. LEONARD MENTIONED THE SORT  
OF KILLER IS THEN WE PUT A      
HEIGHT LIMIT ON TOP OF THAT AND 

03:38:19.454 --> 03:38:22.489
OF KILLER IS THEN WE PUT A      
HEIGHT LIMIT ON TOP OF THAT AND 
THAT WAS ADDED VERY LATE BUT    

03:38:22.491 --> 03:38:26.493
HEIGHT LIMIT ON TOP OF THAT AND 
THAT WAS ADDED VERY LATE BUT    
IT&apos;S HERE.                      

03:38:26.495 --> 03:38:31.165
THAT WAS ADDED VERY LATE BUT    
IT&apos;S HERE.                      
SO UM THAT I WOULD JUST JUMP IN 

03:38:31.167 --> 03:38:33.666
IT&apos;S HERE.                      
SO UM THAT I WOULD JUST JUMP IN 
ONE MORE TIME.                  

03:38:33.668 --> 03:38:34.067
SO UM THAT I WOULD JUST JUMP IN
