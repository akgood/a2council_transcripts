NOTHING BUT INCREASE AND WE     

00:26:48.395 --> 00:26:51.396
UTILITY RATES ARE GOING TO DO   
NOTHING BUT INCREASE AND WE     
ACTUALLY THINK WE HAVE A        

00:26:51.398 --> 00:26:52.030
NOTHING BUT INCREASE AND WE     
ACTUALLY THINK WE HAVE A        
SOLUTION HERE TO MANAGE THOSE   

00:26:52.032 --> 00:26:52.764
ACTUALLY THINK WE HAVE A        
SOLUTION HERE TO MANAGE THOSE   
TO A GREAT DEGREE AND THAT'S    

00:26:52.766 --> 00:26:55.300
SOLUTION HERE TO MANAGE THOSE   
TO A GREAT DEGREE AND THAT'S    
IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL.        

00:26:55.302 --> 00:26:55.901
TO A GREAT DEGREE AND THAT'S    
IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL.        
CAN YOU DO THAT?                

00:26:55.903 --> 00:26:58.770
IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL.        
CAN YOU DO THAT?                
I YEAH.

CAN YOU DO THAT?                
I YEAH.                         
CAN YOU ACTUALLY SEE IF IT      

00:26:59.773 --> 00:27:00.239
I YEAH.                         
CAN YOU ACTUALLY SEE IF IT      
WORKS AGAIN?                    

00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:02.141
CAN YOU ACTUALLY SEE IF IT      
WORKS AGAIN?                    
YEAH.                           

00:27:02.143 --> 00:27:03.075
WORKS AGAIN?                    
YEAH.                           
>> OK, THERE WE GO.

FARMING OPERATORS AND I'M GOING 

00:27:56.831 --> 00:28:00.699
THROUGH CONTRACTING WITH        
FARMING OPERATORS AND I'M GOING 
TO TALK IN THE NEXT SLIDE ABOUT 

00:28:00.701 --> 00:28:01.333
FARMING OPERATORS AND I'M GOING 
TO TALK IN THE NEXT SLIDE ABOUT 
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE            

00:28:01.335 --> 00:28:03.234
TO TALK IN THE NEXT SLIDE ABOUT 
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE            
SPECIFICALLY.                   

00:28:03.236 --> 00:28:04.168
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE            
SPECIFICALLY.                   
BUT THE OUTCOMES WHAT WE'RE     

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:04.803
SPECIFICALLY.                   
BUT THE OUTCOMES WHAT WE'RE     
TRYING TO SUPPORT ARE           

00:28:04.805 --> 00:28:07.272
BUT THE OUTCOMES WHAT WE'RE     
TRYING TO SUPPORT ARE           
CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION.     

00:28:07.274 --> 00:28:08.340
TRYING TO SUPPORT ARE           
CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION.     
SO BY OUR MEASUREMENT WE THINK  

00:28:08.342 --> 00:28:11.376
CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION.     
SO BY OUR MEASUREMENT WE THINK  
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THE 

00:28:11.378 --> 00:28:15.580
SO BY OUR MEASUREMENT WE THINK  
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THE 
AMOUNT OF CO2 OR GREENHOUSE GAS 

00:28:15.582 --> 00:28:19.050
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THE 
AMOUNT OF CO2 OR GREENHOUSE GAS 
THAT THAT'S PUT OUT INTO THE    

00:28:19.052 --> 00:28:19.884
AMOUNT OF CO2 OR GREENHOUSE GAS 
THAT THAT'S PUT OUT INTO THE    
ENVIRONMENT BY ABOUT 7000

BY THE FUEL CELL.               
ONE THING THAT'S REALLY         

00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:25.350
BY THE FUEL CELL.               
ONE THING THAT'S REALLY         
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THIS IS A  

00:29:25.352 --> 00:29:25.817
ONE THING THAT'S REALLY         
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THIS IS A  
TRANSITIONAL PLAN.              

00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:28.753
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THIS IS A  
TRANSITIONAL PLAN.              
OBVIOUSLY OUR OBJECTIVE WOULD   

00:29:28.755 --> 00:29:29.421
TRANSITIONAL PLAN.              
OBVIOUSLY OUR OBJECTIVE WOULD   
BE TO USE EITHER EVEN MORE      

00:29:29.423 --> 00:29:32.991
OBVIOUSLY OUR OBJECTIVE WOULD   
BE TO USE EITHER EVEN MORE      
SUSTAINABLE, MORE RENEWABLE     

00:29:32.993 --> 00:29:33.791
BE TO USE EITHER EVEN MORE      
SUSTAINABLE, MORE RENEWABLE

00:29:33.793 --> 00:29:34.726
SUSTAINABLE, MORE RENEWABLE     
FUEL OR SYNTHETIC FUEL.         
BUT THE OIL COMPANIES ARE       

00:29:34.728 --> 00:29:37.729
FUEL OR SYNTHETIC FUEL.         
BUT THE OIL COMPANIES ARE       
CALLING MOLECULAR FUEL TO FUEL  

00:29:37.731 --> 00:29:40.598
BUT THE OIL COMPANIES ARE       
CALLING MOLECULAR FUEL TO FUEL  
THESE FUEL CELLS AND AN         

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.299
CALLING MOLECULAR FUEL TO FUEL  
THESE FUEL CELLS AND AN         
IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW ABOUT   

00:29:41.301 --> 00:29:44.202
THESE FUEL CELLS AND AN         
IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW ABOUT   
AS WE MAKE THIS TRANSITION IS   

00:29:44.204 --> 00:29:45.170
IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW ABOUT   
AS WE MAKE THIS TRANSITION IS   
THAT THE FUEL CELLS THEMSELVES  

00:29:45.172 --> 00:29:45.570
AS WE MAKE THIS TRANSITION IS   
THAT THE FUEL CELLS THEMSELVES  
STAY IN PLACE.                  

00:29:45.572 --> 00:29:48.606
THAT THE FUEL CELLS THEMSELVES  
STAY IN PLACE.                  
THE THE FILTERS ARE TYPICALLY   

00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:49.307
STAY IN PLACE.                  
THE THE FILTERS ARE TYPICALLY   
CHANGED PERIODICALLY SO EVERY   

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:53.211
THE THE FILTERS ARE TYPICALLY   
CHANGED PERIODICALLY SO EVERY   
FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS THOSE       

00:29:53.213 --> 00:29:54.045
CHANGED PERIODICALLY SO EVERY   
FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS THOSE       
FILTERS GET CHANGED AND THE     

00:29:54.047 --> 00:29:57.215
FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS THOSE       
FILTERS GET CHANGED AND THE     
CHEMISTRY INSIDE THE FILTERS IS 

00:29:57.217 --> 00:29:57.816
FILTERS GET CHANGED AND THE     
CHEMISTRY INSIDE THE FILTERS IS 
BASICALLY CUSTOMIZED TO         

00:29:57.818 --> 00:30:01.052
CHEMISTRY INSIDE THE FILTERS IS 
BASICALLY CUSTOMIZED TO         
WHATEVER THE FUEL SOURCE IS.    

00:30:01.054 --> 00:30:05.056
BASICALLY CUSTOMIZED TO         
WHATEVER THE FUEL SOURCE IS.    
SO IF WE FOR EXAMPLE, WENT FROM 

00:30:05.058 --> 00:30:05.657
WHATEVER THE FUEL SOURCE IS.    
SO IF WE FOR EXAMPLE, WENT FROM 
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS TO        

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:06.324
SO IF WE FOR EXAMPLE, WENT FROM 
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS TO        
HYDROGEN THERE WOULD BE         

00:30:06.326 --> 00:30:08.926
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS TO        
HYDROGEN THERE WOULD BE         
DIFFERENT CHEMISTRY INSIDE THE  

00:30:08.928 --> 00:30:09.661
HYDROGEN THERE WOULD BE         
DIFFERENT CHEMISTRY INSIDE THE  
FILTERS BUT WE WOULD USE THE    

00:30:09.663 --> 00:30:10.128
DIFFERENT CHEMISTRY INSIDE THE  
FILTERS BUT WE WOULD USE THE    
SAME FUEL CELLS.                

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.164
FILTERS BUT WE WOULD USE THE    
SAME FUEL CELLS.                
SO IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO BE    

00:30:13.166 --> 00:30:13.965

GAS GOES THROUGH ITS OWN        
FILTERING AS PART OF THAT       
DIGESTION SYSTEM IT GETS        

00:31:21.134 --> 00:31:23.668
FILTERING AS PART OF THAT

INJECTED INTO THE FUEL SYSTEM.  

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.872
DIGESTION SYSTEM IT GETS        
INJECTED INTO THE FUEL SYSTEM.  
THE THE GAS IS PURIFIED FROM    

00:31:27.874 --> 00:31:28.739
INJECTED INTO THE FUEL SYSTEM.  
THE THE GAS IS PURIFIED FROM    
THERE THEY TAKE OUT ALL THE     

00:31:28.741 --> 00:31:29.474
THE THE GAS IS PURIFIED FROM    
THERE THEY TAKE OUT ALL THE     
NOXIOUS GASES AND THEY INCREASE 

00:31:29.476 --> 00:31:32.177
THERE THEY TAKE OUT ALL THE     
NOXIOUS GASES AND THEY INCREASE 
IT TO GREATER METHANE CONTENT   

00:31:32.179 --> 00:31:33.044
NOXIOUS GASES AND THEY INCREASE 
IT TO GREATER METHANE CONTENT   
WHICH IS ABOUT 90 PERCENT PURE. 

00:31:33.046 --> 00:31:36.314
IT TO GREATER METHANE CONTENT   
WHICH IS ABOUT 90 PERCENT PURE. 
SO WHY IS THIS RENEWABLE?       

00:31:36.316 --> 00:31:37.115
WHICH IS ABOUT 90 PERCENT PURE. 
SO WHY IS THIS RENEWABLE?       
WELL, IT ABSORBS MORE           

00:31:37.117 --> 00:31:39.451
SO WHY IS THIS RENEWABLE?       
WELL, IT ABSORBS MORE           
GREENHOUSE GAS THAN IT EMITS    

00:31:39.453 --> 00:31:40.651
WELL, IT ABSORBS MORE
