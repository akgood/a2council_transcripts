00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:48.059
SOMETHING YOU SAID MADE ME HAVE 
ANOTHER QUESTION.               
SO IS                           

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:04.007
      THE IS THE VARIANCE THE   
CAPACITY OF THE FENCE OR IS IT  
THE DISTANCE FROM THE LIKE THE  

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.341
CAPACITY OF THE FENCE OR IS IT  
THE DISTANCE FROM THE LIKE THE  
FRONTAGE?                       

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:05.143
THE DISTANCE FROM THE LIKE THE  
FRONTAGE?                       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S BOTH A HEIGHT BECAUSE   

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:05.876
FRONTAGE?                       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S BOTH A HEIGHT BECAUSE   
IT CAN ONLY BE FOUR FEET HIGH   

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:06.543
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;apos;S BOTH A HEIGHT BECAUSE   
IT CAN ONLY BE FOUR FEET HIGH   
AND IT CAN ONLY BE FIFTY        

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:06.944
IT CAN ONLY BE FOUR FEET HIGH   
AND IT CAN ONLY BE FIFTY        
PERCENT OPAQUE.                 

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:07.745
AND IT CAN ONLY BE FIFTY        
PERCENT OPAQUE.                 
SO THEY WOULD NEED A VARIANCE   

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:08.413
PERCENT OPAQUE.                 
SO THEY WOULD NEED A VARIANCE   
BOTH BECAUSE OF THE FENCE RIGHT 

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:09.080
SO THEY WOULD NEED A VARIANCE   
BOTH BECAUSE OF THE FENCE RIGHT 
NOW SIX FEET HIGH IN ONE        

00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:09.947
BOTH BECAUSE OF THE FENCE RIGHT 
NOW SIX FEET HIGH IN ONE        
HUNDRED PERCENT OPAQUE SO THEY  

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:10.715
NOW SIX FEET HIGH IN ONE        
HUNDRED PERCENT OPAQUE SO THEY  
NEED A VARIANCE OF TWO FEET TO  

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.448
HUNDRED PERCENT OPAQUE SO THEY  
NEED A VARIANCE OF TWO FEET TO  
ALLOW THEM TO GO TO SIX FEET    

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.116
NEED A VARIANCE OF TWO FEET TO  
ALLOW THEM TO GO TO SIX FEET    
AND BASICALLY FIFTY PERCENT     

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:12.850
ALLOW THEM TO GO TO SIX FEET    
AND BASICALLY FIFTY PERCENT     
CAPACITY TO ALLOW TO GO TO 100  

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:13.584
AND BASICALLY FIFTY PERCENT     
CAPACITY TO ALLOW TO GO TO 100  
PERCENT CAPACITY SO THE ENTIRE  

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:14.252
CAPACITY TO ALLOW TO GO TO 100  
PERCENT CAPACITY SO THE ENTIRE  
FRONT YARD HAS TO BE SO         

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:14.986
PERCENT CAPACITY SO THE ENTIRE  
FRONT YARD HAS TO BE SO         
EVERYTHING BASICALLY THEIR      

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:15.720
FRONT YARD HAS TO BE SO         
EVERYTHING BASICALLY THEIR      
BACKYARD IS REALLY IS ALMOST AN 

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.587
EVERYTHING BASICALLY THEIR      
BACKYARD IS REALLY IS ALMOST AN 
ENTIRE FRONT YARD AWAY THE WAY  

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:17.121
BACKYARD IS REALLY IS ALMOST AN 
ENTIRE FRONT YARD AWAY THE WAY  
THE ZONING WORKS.               

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.857
ENTIRE FRONT YARD AWAY THE WAY  
THE ZONING WORKS.               
SO ON THIS PICTURE THE FRONT    

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:20.624
THE ZONING WORKS.               
SO ON THIS PICTURE THE FRONT    
LIKE THAT HOUSE IS SITUATED     

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:23.827
SO ON THIS PICTURE THE FRONT    
LIKE THAT HOUSE IS SITUATED     
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET OR A

OF COURSE, YOU KNOW IT&amp;apos;S NOT    

00:26:34.393 --> 00:26:36.226
IT&amp;apos;S SLIGHTLY SKEWED.           
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW IT&amp;apos;S NOT    
EXACT BUT THAT&amp;apos;S THE PROPERTY.  

00:26:36.228 --> 00:26:37.227
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW IT&amp;apos;S NOT    
EXACT BUT THAT&amp;apos;S THE PROPERTY.  
SO OBVIOUSLY ANY SIDEWALK WOULD 

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:37.828
EXACT BUT THAT&amp;apos;S THE PROPERTY.  
SO OBVIOUSLY ANY SIDEWALK WOULD 
GO TYPICALLY PUBLIC SIDEWALKS   

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.630
SO OBVIOUSLY ANY SIDEWALK WOULD 
GO TYPICALLY PUBLIC SIDEWALKS   
ARE ONE FOOT OFF OF THAT        

00:26:40.632 --> 00:26:41.431
GO TYPICALLY PUBLIC SIDEWALKS   
ARE ONE FOOT OFF OF THAT        
PROPERTY RIGHTS WOULD BE ONE    

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.099
ARE ONE FOOT OFF OF THAT        
PROPERTY RIGHTS WOULD BE ONE    
FOOT CLOSER TO DEXTRAN HARBOR   

00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.167
PROPERTY RIGHTS WOULD BE ONE    
FOOT CLOSER TO DEXTRAN HARBOR   
ROAD.                           

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:45.235
FOOT CLOSER TO DEXTRAN HARBOR   
ROAD.                           
SO NO, THAT FENCE WOULDN&amp;apos;T BUT  

00:26:45.237 --> 00:26:48.004
ROAD.                           
SO NO, THAT FENCE WOULDN&amp;apos;T BUT  
IT COULD BE WITHIN IF THEY IF   

00:26:48.006 --> 00:26:48.938
SO NO, THAT FENCE WOULDN&amp;apos;T BUT  
IT COULD BE WITHIN IF THEY IF   
THE SIDEWALK WAS EVER TO GO     

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.673
IT COULD BE WITHIN IF THEY IF   
THE SIDEWALK WAS EVER TO GO     
THERE AGAIN, IT WOULD PROBABLY  

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:52.476
THE SIDEWALK WAS EVER TO GO     
THERE AGAIN, IT WOULD PROBABLY  
BE USUALLY ONE FOOT OFF THAT    

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:53.343
THERE AGAIN, IT WOULD PROBABLY  
BE USUALLY ONE FOOT OFF THAT    
PROPERTY LINE SO THERE COULD BE 

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:54.010
BE USUALLY ONE FOOT OFF THAT    
PROPERTY LINE SO THERE COULD BE 
ONE FOOT BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK   

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:55.378
PROPERTY LINE SO THERE COULD BE 
ONE FOOT BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK   
AND THEN THE THAT&amp;apos;S OK.         

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.148
ONE FOOT BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK   
AND THEN THE THAT&amp;apos;S OK.         
AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS   

00:26:59.150 --> 00:26:59.983
AND THEN THE THAT&amp;apos;S OK.         
AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS   
IT&amp;apos;S ONLY THAT IS IT THAT&amp;apos;S     

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:00.650
AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS   
IT&amp;apos;S ONLY THAT IS IT THAT&amp;apos;S     
JUST THAT SOUTHERN SECTION      

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:03.820
IT&amp;apos;S ONLY THAT IS IT THAT&amp;apos;S     
JUST THAT SOUTHERN SECTION      
OF THE FENCE THAT IS TOO TALL   

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:04.554
JUST THAT SOUTHERN SECTION      
OF THE FENCE THAT IS TOO TALL   
AND TOO OPAQUE OR IS IT THE     

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:07.157
OF THE FENCE THAT IS TOO TALL   
AND TOO OPAQUE OR IS IT THE     
SIDE SECTIONS AS WELL?          

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:08.158
AND TOO OPAQUE OR IS IT THE     
SIDE SECTIONS AS WELL?          
IT&amp;apos;S THE SIDE SECTIONS AS WELL  

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.025
SIDE SECTIONS AS WELL?          
IT&amp;apos;S THE SIDE SECTIONS AS WELL  
FOR TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM THE   

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:11.627
IT&amp;apos;S THE SIDE SECTIONS AS WELL  
FOR TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM THE   
PROPERTY LINE IN TOWARDS THE    

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:12.395
FOR TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM THE   
PROPERTY LINE IN TOWARDS THE    
HOUSE IS CONSIDERED THE FRONT   

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:16.032
PROPERTY LINE IN TOWARDS THE    
HOUSE IS CONSIDERED THE FRONT   
SO IT WOULD BE SIDE SECTIONS AS 

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:16.700
HOUSE IS CONSIDERED THE FRONT   
SO IT WOULD BE SIDE SECTIONS AS 
WELL AS THE SECTION ALONG HERE  

00:27:16.702 --> 00:27:19.502
SO IT WOULD BE SIDE SECTIONS AS 
WELL AS THE SECTION ALONG HERE  
AND AGAIN OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS    

00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:20.303
WELL AS THE SECTION ALONG HERE  
AND AGAIN OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS    
THE INTENT IS TO GIVE CORNERS   

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:20.837
AND AGAIN OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS    
THE INTENT IS TO GIVE CORNERS   
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.           

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:23.306
THE INTENT IS TO GIVE CORNERS   
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.           
YOU CAN HAVE THAT VISIBILITY AT 

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:24.241
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.           
YOU CAN HAVE THAT VISIBILITY AT 
THAT CORNER SO NO IT&amp;apos;S NOT JUST 

00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:25.041
YOU CAN HAVE THAT VISIBILITY AT 
THAT CORNER SO NO IT&amp;apos;S NOT JUST 
THE FRONTAGE ALONG THERE.       

00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:27.610
THAT CORNER SO NO IT&amp;apos;S NOT JUST 
THE FRONTAGE ALONG THERE.       
IT WOULD BE REQUIRED AGAIN IN   

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:28.311
THE FRONTAGE ALONG THERE.       
IT WOULD BE REQUIRED AGAIN IN   
THE PICTURE WE&amp;apos;LL SHOW YOU SO   

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:31.314
IT WOULD BE REQUIRED AGAIN IN

IT&amp;apos;S NOT BUT BUT IT&amp;apos;S NOT THE   
WHOLE LENGTH OF THE SIDE.       
IT&amp;apos;S LIKE TO THE CORRECT TO BE  

00:27:39.525 --> 00:27:40.323
WHOLE LENGTH OF THE SIDE.       
IT&amp;apos;S LIKE TO THE CORRECT TO BE  
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM THIS FROM 

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:42.992
IT&amp;apos;S LIKE TO THE CORRECT TO BE  
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM THIS FROM 
THE EDGE OF THE EDGE BUT FROM   

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:43.727
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM THIS FROM 
THE EDGE OF THE EDGE BUT FROM   
THE PROPERTY LINE BASICALLY IN  

00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:46.996
THE EDGE OF THE EDGE BUT FROM   
THE PROPERTY LINE BASICALLY IN  
SO I&amp;apos;M NOT SURE HOW WIDE THOSE  

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:47.663
THE PROPERTY LINE BASICALLY IN  
SO I&amp;apos;M NOT SURE HOW WIDE THOSE  
INDIVIDUAL PANELS ARE EIGHT     

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:50.733
SO I&amp;apos;M NOT SURE HOW WIDE THOSE  
INDIVIDUAL PANELS ARE EIGHT     
FEET OR SO SO COULD BE ALMOST   

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:51.535
INDIVIDUAL PANELS ARE EIGHT

HAVE DECIDED ON SOME PETITIONS  
THAT WERE SIMILAR TO THIS.      
I THINK I REMEMBER ONE ON THE

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:58.401
I&amp;apos;M JUST BUILDING A LITTLE BIT  
ON THAT AS WELL THAT THE SCALE  
OF DEXTER ROAD AT THIS SPOT     

00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:58.969
ON THAT AS WELL THAT THE SCALE  
OF DEXTER ROAD AT THIS SPOT     
IT&amp;apos;S ONLY TWO LANES.            

00:28:58.971 --> 00:28:59.335
OF DEXTER ROAD AT THIS SPOT     
IT&amp;apos;S ONLY TWO LANES.            
RIGHT.                          

00:28:59.337 --> 00:29:02.572
IT&amp;apos;S ONLY TWO LANES.            
RIGHT.                          
SO IT IS NARROW.                

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:06.175
RIGHT.

I MEAN IT&amp;apos;S NOT A FOUR LANE     
ROAD WHERE MAYBE A SOLID FENCE  

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:11.014
I MEAN IT&amp;apos;S NOT A FOUR LANE     
ROAD WHERE MAYBE A SOLID FENCE  
LINE WOULD BE MAYBE MORE        

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:14.284
ROAD WHERE MAYBE A SOLID FENCE  
LINE WOULD BE MAYBE MORE        
ACCEPTABLE THAT JUST I&amp;apos;M        

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:14.784
LINE WOULD BE MAYBE MORE        
ACCEPTABLE THAT JUST I&amp;apos;M        
LOOKING AT IT.                  

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:17.253
ACCEPTABLE THAT JUST I&amp;apos;M        
LOOKING AT IT.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO GOING BACK TO WHAT DAVID  

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.121
LOOKING AT IT.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO GOING BACK TO WHAT DAVID  
SAID ABOUT THE PEDESTRIAN SCALE 

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:22.024
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO GOING BACK TO WHAT DAVID  
SAID ABOUT THE PEDESTRIAN SCALE 
AND IF THERE IN THE FUTURE IF   

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:25.628
SAID ABOUT THE PEDESTRIAN SCALE 
AND IF THERE IN THE FUTURE IF   
THERE&amp;apos;S PLANS TO HAVE A         

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.363
AND IF THERE IN THE FUTURE IF   
THERE&amp;apos;S PLANS TO HAVE A         
SIDEWALK, YOU KNOW THAT JUST    

00:29:26.365 --> 00:29:27.097
THERE&amp;apos;S PLANS TO HAVE A         
SIDEWALK, YOU KNOW THAT JUST    
HELPS THE TRANSPARENCY          

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:29.865
SIDEWALK, YOU KNOW THAT JUST    
HELPS THE TRANSPARENCY          
OF EXPERIENCE AND WALKING DOWN  

00:29:29.867 --> 00:29:33.436
HELPS THE TRANSPARENCY          
OF EXPERIENCE AND WALKING DOWN  
THE STREET EVEN AS A DRIVER IN  

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.404
OF EXPERIENCE AND WALKING DOWN  
THE STREET EVEN AS A DRIVER IN  
A CAR I THINK BECAUSE OF THE    

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:37.674
THE STREET EVEN AS A DRIVER IN  
A CAR I THINK BECAUSE OF THE    
WIDTH IS IS IT FEELS LIKE A     

00:29:37.676 --> 00:29:38.408
A CAR I THINK BECAUSE OF THE    
WIDTH IS IS IT FEELS LIKE A     
RESIDENTIAL STREET AND IT&amp;apos;S     

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:44.180
WIDTH IS IS IT FEELS LIKE A

AS A FRONT SET BACK?            
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TWENTY FIVE FEET IS THE      
FRONT STEP BACK SO IT WOULD BE  

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:57.046
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TWENTY FIVE FEET IS THE      
FRONT STEP BACK SO IT WOULD BE  
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM BOTH      

00:41:57.048 --> 00:41:59.715
FRONT STEP BACK SO IT WOULD BE  
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM BOTH      
ROBIN AND TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM 

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:00.182
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM BOTH      
ROBIN AND TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM 
FOUNTAIN.                       

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:03.185
ROBIN AND TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM 
FOUNTAIN.

WITH THE TWENTY FIVE FOOT NOT   
THE AVERAGE THE EXISTING HOUSE  

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:10.993
WITH THE TWENTY FIVE FOOT NOT   
THE AVERAGE THE EXISTING HOUSE  
WOULD BE NONCONFORMING ALONG    

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:14.530
THE AVERAGE THE EXISTING HOUSE  
WOULD BE NONCONFORMING ALONG    
THE FOUNTAIN AND THEN A NEW     

00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:18.100
WOULD BE NONCONFORMING ALONG    
THE FOUNTAIN AND THEN A NEW     
ADDITION THAT THEY&amp;apos;RE PROPOSING 

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:18.333
THE FOUNTAIN AND THEN A NEW     
ADDITION THAT THEY&amp;apos;RE PROPOSING 
.                               

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:19.568
ADDITION THAT THEY&amp;apos;RE PROPOSING

BACK OFF OF HOME THAT BACK      

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:23.271
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HOW MANY FEET IS THAT SET    
BACK OFF OF HOME THAT BACK      
TWENTY SEVEN AND A HALF FEET SO 

00:42:23.273 --> 00:42:23.939
BACK OFF OF HOME THAT BACK      
TWENTY SEVEN AND A HALF FEET SO 
THAT WOULD CONFORM TO THE FRONT 

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:26.408
TWENTY SEVEN AND A HALF FEET SO 
THAT WOULD CONFORM TO THE FRONT 
STEP BACK A FOUNTAIN.           

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.543
THAT WOULD CONFORM TO THE FRONT 
STEP BACK A FOUNTAIN.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, AND I NOTE THAT THE      

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:30.445
STEP BACK A FOUNTAIN.           
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, AND I NOTE THAT THE      
AVERAGING IS BECAUSE ALL THESE  

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:34.316
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, AND I NOTE THAT THE      
AVERAGING IS BECAUSE ALL THESE  
HOMES ON CRISFIELD ARE THERE&amp;apos;S  

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:35.050
AVERAGING IS BECAUSE ALL THESE  
HOMES ON CRISFIELD ARE THERE&amp;apos;S  
A LONG DISTANCE SO THEY&amp;apos;RE      

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:35.651

IS THE REAR SETBACK BACK LINE   
THIS AND THEN ALSO GOES UP TO   

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.277
IS THE REAR SETBACK BACK LINE   
THIS AND THEN ALSO GOES UP TO   
THE FRONT SET BACK LINE THE     

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:35.577
THIS AND THEN ALSO GOES UP TO   
THE FRONT SET BACK LINE THE     
AVERAGE.

STILL SEE THAT IT DOES CONFORM  
TO THE SIDE YARD SET BACK WHICH 
IS FIVE FEET THAT DASH LINE     

00:43:49.993 --> 00:43:50.692
TO THE SIDE YARD SET BACK WHICH 
IS FIVE FEET THAT DASH LINE     
THAT&amp;apos;S KIND OF I THINK THAT&amp;apos;S
