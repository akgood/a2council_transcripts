SO I'VE I'VE BEEN TO THIS YEAR  

00:31:46.603 --> 00:31:50.838
WORSE.                          
SO I'VE I'VE BEEN TO THIS YEAR  
I'VE BEEN TO 11 OF THE 13 SITES 

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.539
SO I'VE I'VE BEEN TO THIS YEAR  
I'VE BEEN TO 11 OF THE 13 SITES 
WHERE PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR     

00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:54.876
I'VE BEEN TO 11 OF THE 13 SITES 
WHERE PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR     
SERIOUSLY INJURED AND I'VE BEEN 

00:31:54.878 --> 00:31:58.179
WHERE PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR     
SERIOUSLY INJURED AND I'VE BEEN 
TO THE OTHER TWO BECAUSE THOSE  

00:31:58.181 --> 00:31:59.047
SERIOUSLY INJURED AND I'VE BEEN 
TO THE OTHER TWO BECAUSE THOSE  
MOST TOO RECENT WERE REPEATS.   

00:31:59.049 --> 00:32:00.014
TO THE OTHER TWO BECAUSE THOSE  
MOST TOO RECENT WERE REPEATS.   
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THEM THIS     

00:32:00.016 --> 00:32:02.851
MOST TOO RECENT WERE REPEATS.   
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THEM THIS     
YEAR BUT I WENT TO THEM THE     

00:32:02.853 --> 00:32:05.319
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THEM THIS     
YEAR BUT I WENT TO THEM THE     
LAST TIME THAT THEY HAD CRASH   

00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:10.558
YEAR BUT I WENT TO THEM THE     
LAST TIME THAT THEY HAD CRASH   
AND I'VE SEEN THEY TREND TEN    

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.325
LAST TIME THAT THEY HAD CRASH   
AND I'VE SEEN THEY TREND TEN    
OF THE THIRTEEN SERIOUS AND     

00:32:11.327 --> 00:32:14.029
AND I'VE SEEN THEY TREND TEN    
OF THE THIRTEEN SERIOUS AND     
FATAL CRASHES THAT WE'VE HAD    

00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:14.762
OF THE THIRTEEN SERIOUS AND     
FATAL CRASHES THAT WE'VE HAD    
THIS YEAR WERE SUFFERED BY      

00:32:14.764 --> 00:32:17.165
FATAL CRASHES THAT WE'VE HAD    
THIS YEAR WERE SUFFERED BY      
PEDESTRIANS IN CROSSWALKS WHERE 

00:32:17.167 --> 00:32:17.732
THIS YEAR WERE SUFFERED BY      
PEDESTRIANS IN CROSSWALKS WHERE 
DRIVERS DIDN'T YIELD.           

00:32:17.734 --> 00:32:19.033
PEDESTRIANS IN CROSSWALKS WHERE 
DRIVERS DIDN'T YIELD.           
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, THESE ARE 

00:32:19.035 --> 00:32:22.070
DRIVERS DIDN'T YIELD.           
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, THESE ARE 
THE ACTIONS THAT I THINK WE CAN 

00:32:22.072 --> 00:32:22.738
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, THESE ARE 
THE ACTIONS THAT I THINK WE CAN 
TAKE RIGHT NOW TO EFFECT THESE  

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.540
THE ACTIONS THAT I THINK WE CAN 
TAKE RIGHT NOW TO EFFECT THESE  
CRASHES IN THE SHORT TERM IN    

00:32:25.542 --> 00:32:26.474
TAKE RIGHT NOW TO EFFECT THESE  
CRASHES IN THE SHORT TERM IN    
THE REST OF THIS YEAR TARGETED  

00:32:26.476 --> 00:32:29.111
CRASHES IN THE SHORT TERM IN    
THE REST OF THIS YEAR TARGETED  
ENFORCEMENT AT CROSSWALKS AND   

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:29.577
THE REST OF THIS YEAR TARGETED  
ENFORCEMENT AT CROSSWALKS AND   
INTERSECTIONS.                  

00:32:29.579 --> 00:32:30.445
ENFORCEMENT AT CROSSWALKS AND   
INTERSECTIONS.                  
LET'S ADD THAT INTO THE SAFETY  

00:32:30.447 --> 00:32:30.912
INTERSECTIONS.                  
LET'S ADD THAT INTO THE SAFETY  
CORRIDOR PROGRAM.               

00:32:30.914 --> 00:32:32.713
LET'S ADD THAT INTO THE SAFETY  
CORRIDOR PROGRAM.               
LET'S MEASURE AND REPORT DRIVER 

00:32:32.715 --> 00:32:33.314
CORRIDOR PROGRAM.               
LET'S MEASURE AND REPORT DRIVER 
COMPLIANCE AT CROSSWALKS.       

00:32:33.316 --> 00:32:36.484
LET'S MEASURE AND REPORT DRIVER 
COMPLIANCE AT CROSSWALKS.       
LET'S DEACTIVATE FLASHING       

00:32:36.486 --> 00:32:37.085
COMPLIANCE AT CROSSWALKS.       
LET'S DEACTIVATE FLASHING       
ARROWS AT THE REMAINING         

00:32:37.087 --> 00:32:37.953
LET'S DEACTIVATE FLASHING       
ARROWS AT THE REMAINING         
INTERSECTIONS THAT STILL DIRECT 

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:40.588
ARROWS AT THE REMAINING         
INTERSECTIONS THAT STILL DIRECT 
LEFT TURNING TRAFFIC THROUGH    

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.289
INTERSECTIONS THAT STILL DIRECT 
LEFT TURNING TRAFFIC THROUGH    
ACTIVE CROSSWALKS AND LET'S     

00:32:41.291 --> 00:32:41.890
LEFT TURNING TRAFFIC THROUGH    
ACTIVE CROSSWALKS AND LET'S     
IMPLEMENT LEADING PEDESTRIAN    

00:32:41.892 --> 00:32:45.393
ACTIVE CROSSWALKS AND LET'S     
IMPLEMENT LEADING PEDESTRIAN    
INTERVALS AT INTERSECTIONS IN   

00:32:45.395 --> 00:32:46.094
IMPLEMENT LEADING PEDESTRIAN    
INTERVALS AT INTERSECTIONS IN   
MAINE WHERE PEDESTRIAN WAS      

00:32:46.096 --> 00:32:48.329
INTERVALS AT INTERSECTIONS IN   
MAINE WHERE PEDESTRIAN WAS      
SERIOUSLY INJURED THIS YEAR BY

MAINE WHERE PEDESTRIAN WAS      
SERIOUSLY INJURED THIS YEAR BY  
TURNING VEHICLE.                

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:52.834
SERIOUSLY INJURED THIS YEAR BY  
TURNING VEHICLE.                
SO TO THOSE LAST TWO, TWO       

00:32:52.836 --> 00:32:53.468
TURNING VEHICLE.                
SO TO THOSE LAST TWO, TWO       
OF THE TEN CRASHES AT           

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.404
SO TO THOSE LAST TWO, TWO       
OF THE TEN CRASHES AT           
CROSSWALKS WOULD LIKELY HAVE    

00:32:56.406 --> 00:32:57.238
OF THE TEN CRASHES AT           
CROSSWALKS WOULD LIKELY HAVE    
BEEN PREVENTED BY THESE CHANGES 

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.039
CROSSWALKS WOULD LIKELY HAVE    
BEEN PREVENTED BY THESE CHANGES 
TO FLASHING YELLOW ARROWS AND   

00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:00.508
BEEN PREVENTED BY THESE CHANGES 
TO FLASHING YELLOW ARROWS AND   
LEADING PEDESTRIAN INTERVALE
