WE'VE GOT SOME WHITE OAKS AND

00:13:54.223 --> 00:13:57.791
WE'VE GOT SOME WHITE OAKS AND   
SOME ELMS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT 
HARDER TO SEE ON THE AERIAL BUT 

00:13:57.793 --> 00:14:00.961
SOME ELMS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT 
HARDER TO SEE ON THE AERIAL BUT 
YOU SAW IT IN THE PHOTOGRAPH    

00:14:00.963 --> 00:14:01.929
HARDER TO SEE ON THE AERIAL BUT 
YOU SAW IT IN THE PHOTOGRAPH

00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:04.599
YOU SAW IT IN THE PHOTOGRAPH    
AND IT'S THOSE CONTINUE TO GROW 
AND LEAF OUT THAT SORT OF FILL  

00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:05.332
AND IT'S THOSE CONTINUE TO GROW 
AND LEAF OUT THAT SORT OF FILL  
IN THAT AREA BEHIND OUR         

00:14:05.334 --> 00:14:08.635
AND LEAF OUT THAT SORT OF FILL  
IN THAT AREA BEHIND OUR         
PROPERTY BEFORE GETTING TO THE  

00:14:08.637 --> 00:14:09.470
IN THAT AREA BEHIND OUR         
PROPERTY BEFORE GETTING TO THE  
HEART VILLAGE PROPERTY TO THE   

00:14:09.472 --> 00:14:12.306
PROPERTY BEFORE GETTING TO THE  
HEART VILLAGE PROPERTY TO THE

HEART VILLAGE PROPERTY TO THE   
NORTH.                          
I THINK THAT GRANTING THE       

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:17.144
NORTH.                          
I THINK THAT GRANTING THE       
VARIANCE WOULD RESULT IN A      

00:14:17.146 --> 00:14:20.848
I THINK THAT GRANTING THE       
VARIANCE WOULD RESULT IN A      
LITTLE DISRUPTION TO OUR REAR   

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.618
VARIANCE WOULD RESULT IN A      
LITTLE DISRUPTION TO OUR REAR   
NEIGHBOR BECAUSE OF THAT COMMON 

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.521
LITTLE DISRUPTION TO OUR REAR   
NEIGHBOR BECAUSE OF THAT COMMON 
AREA AND THE BUFFER IS PART     

00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:31.191
NEIGHBOR BECAUSE OF THAT COMMON 
AREA AND THE BUFFER IS PART     
OF THE TERRAIN.                 

00:14:31.193 --> 00:14:32.260
AREA AND THE BUFFER IS PART     
OF THE TERRAIN.                 
AND SO THAT WOULD GRANTING THE  

00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:35.730
OF THE TERRAIN.                 
AND SO THAT WOULD GRANTING THE  
VARIANCE WOULD ENSURE THAT OUR  

00:14:35.732 --> 00:14:39.466
AND SO THAT WOULD GRANTING THE  
VARIANCE WOULD ENSURE THAT OUR  
NEIGHBORS CAN STILL ENJOY THEIR 

00:14:39.468 --> 00:14:43.037
VARIANCE WOULD ENSURE THAT OUR  
NEIGHBORS CAN STILL ENJOY THEIR 
PROPERTY WHICH IS THE PURPOSE   

00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:44.172
NEIGHBORS CAN STILL ENJOY THEIR

OF HAVING THE 40 FOOT SET BACK  

00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:47.475

OF HAVING THE 40 FOOT SET BACK  
IN IN THE FIRST INSTANCE.       

00:14:47.477 --> 00:14:48.342
OF HAVING THE 40 FOOT SET BACK  
IN IN THE FIRST INSTANCE.       
I THINK THE GRANTING THIS       

00:14:48.344 --> 00:14:51.412
IN IN THE FIRST INSTANCE.       
I THINK THE GRANTING THIS       
VARIANCE WOULD BE CONSISTENT    

00:14:51.414 --> 00:14:52.146
I THINK THE GRANTING THIS       
VARIANCE WOULD BE CONSISTENT    
WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE         

00:14:52.148 --> 00:14:52.680

00:42:50.892 --> 00:42:51.624
RECTANGULAR BUILDING.           
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT       
DIAGRAM IN FRONT OF YOU, YOU    

00:42:51.626 --> 00:42:52.391
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT       
DIAGRAM IN FRONT OF YOU, YOU    
SEE THAT'S LIKE THE DEFINITION  

00:42:52.393 --> 00:42:53.125
DIAGRAM IN FRONT OF YOU, YOU    
SEE THAT'S LIKE THE DEFINITION  
OF A RECTANGLE KIND OF LIKE A   

00:42:53.127 --> 00:42:53.659
SEE THAT'S LIKE THE DEFINITION  
OF A RECTANGLE KIND OF LIKE A   
DIRECT ANGULAR LOT.             

00:42:53.661 --> 00:42:57.262
OF A RECTANGLE KIND OF LIKE A   
DIRECT ANGULAR LOT.             
WELL, HERE WE HAVE AN IRREGULAR 

00:42:57.264 --> 00:42:58.264
DIRECT ANGULAR LOT.             
WELL, HERE WE HAVE AN IRREGULAR 
SHAPED LOT AND WE HAVE A        

00:42:58.266 --> 00:43:01.166
WELL, HERE WE HAVE AN IRREGULAR 
SHAPED LOT AND WE HAVE A        
BUILDING IN THE SHAPE OF A C    

00:43:01.168 --> 00:43:02.201
SHAPED LOT AND WE HAVE A        
BUILDING IN THE SHAPE OF A C    
NOT REALLY A RECTANGLE BUT THE  

00:43:02.203 --> 00:43:05.370
BUILDING IN THE SHAPE OF A C    
NOT REALLY A RECTANGLE BUT THE  
SIDES SET BACK IS CALCULATION   

00:43:05.372 --> 00:43:06.238
NOT REALLY A RECTANGLE BUT THE  
SIDES SET BACK IS CALCULATION   
AND A PORTION OF THAT SIDE      

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.942
SIDES SET BACK IS CALCULATION   
AND A PORTION OF THAT SIDE      
SETBACK REQUIREMENT IS BASED ON 

00:43:09.944 --> 00:43:12.411
AND A PORTION OF THAT SIDE      
SETBACK REQUIREMENT IS BASED ON 
THIS KIND OF WEIRD DEFINITION   

00:43:12.413 --> 00:43:13.212
SETBACK REQUIREMENT IS BASED ON 
THIS KIND OF WEIRD DEFINITION   
OF THE LENGTH OF THE OF THE     

00:43:13.214 --> 00:43:16.548
THIS KIND OF WEIRD DEFINITION   
OF THE LENGTH OF THE OF THE     
BUILDING.                       

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.883
OF THE LENGTH OF THE OF THE     
BUILDING.                       
YEAH.                           

00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:20.953
BUILDING.                       
YEAH.                           
SO ANYWAYS IN THIS CASE THE     

00:43:20.955 --> 00:43:21.987
YEAH.                           
SO ANYWAYS IN THIS CASE THE     
LENGTH YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IS   

00:43:21.989 --> 00:43:24.790
SO ANYWAYS IN THIS CASE THE     
LENGTH YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IS   
LONGER THAN THE BUILDING        

00:43:24.792 --> 00:43:25.458
LENGTH YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IS   
LONGER THAN THE BUILDING        
BECAUSE THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT 

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.860
LONGER THAN THE BUILDING        
BECAUSE THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT 
CODE DEFINES THREE HUNDRED AND  

00:43:27.862 --> 00:43:28.261
BECAUSE THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT 
CODE DEFINES THREE HUNDRED AND  
THIRTY TWO FEET.                

00:43:28.263 --> 00:43:32.498
CODE DEFINES THREE HUNDRED AND  
THIRTY TWO FEET.                
YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THAT   

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.298
THIRTY TWO FEET.                
YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THAT   
DEFINITION THAT LEADS TO THAT   

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.868
YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THAT   
DEFINITION THAT LEADS TO THAT   
IS A BAD DEFINITION AND WE      

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:36.569
DEFINITION THAT LEADS TO THAT   
IS A BAD DEFINITION AND WE      
BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL TO THE    

00:43:36.571 --> 00:43:39.872
IS A BAD DEFINITION AND WE      
BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL TO THE    
ACTUAL LENGTH ALONG SIDE OF THE 

00:43:39.874 --> 00:43:40.573
BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL TO THE    
ACTUAL LENGTH ALONG SIDE OF THE 
BUILDING ALONG THAT SIDE STEP   

00:43:40.575 --> 00:43:43.842
ACTUAL LENGTH ALONG SIDE OF THE 
BUILDING ALONG THAT SIDE STEP   
BACK HAS ONE NINETY TWO FEET    

00:43:43.844 --> 00:43:47.079
BUILDING ALONG THAT SIDE STEP   
BACK HAS ONE NINETY TWO FEET    
AND IF THE UNIT DEVELOPMENT     

00:43:47.081 --> 00:43:47.880
BACK HAS ONE NINETY TWO FEET    
AND IF THE UNIT DEVELOPMENT     
CODE INTERPRETED THAT AS THE    

00:43:47.882 --> 00:43:48.614
AND IF THE UNIT DEVELOPMENT     
CODE INTERPRETED THAT AS THE    
LENGTH OF THE BUILDING WE WOULD 

00:43:48.616 --> 00:43:53.418
CODE INTERPRETED THAT AS THE    
LENGTH OF THE BUILDING WE WOULD 
NOT BE HERE TONIGHT.            

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.456
LENGTH OF THE BUILDING WE WOULD 
NOT BE HERE TONIGHT.            
SO WITH THE CALCULATIONS ASIDE  

00:43:57.458 --> 00:43:58.524
NOT BE HERE TONIGHT.            
SO WITH THE CALCULATIONS ASIDE  
SET BACK AS YOU SEE THERE RIGHT 

00:43:58.526 --> 00:44:01.894
SO WITH THE CALCULATIONS ASIDE  
SET BACK AS YOU SEE THERE RIGHT 
ON THE TOP THE REQUIRED STEP    

00:44:01.896 --> 00:44:02.695
SET BACK AS YOU SEE THERE RIGHT 
ON THE TOP THE REQUIRED STEP    
BACK IS FIFTY ONE POINT TWO     

00:44:02.697 --> 00:44:05.097
ON THE TOP THE REQUIRED STEP    
BACK IS FIFTY ONE POINT TWO     
FEET AND THAT'S EXCESSIVE.      

00:44:05.099 --> 00:44:08.901
BACK IS FIFTY ONE POINT TWO     
FEET AND THAT'S EXCESSIVE.      
WE BELIEVE THIS PRESENTS A      

00:44:08.903 --> 00:44:12.471
FEET AND THAT'S EXCESSIVE.      
WE BELIEVE THIS PRESENTS A      
HARDSHIP TO THE SITE BECAUSE    

00:44:12.473 --> 00:44:13.472
WE BELIEVE THIS PRESENTS A      
HARDSHIP TO THE SITE BECAUSE    
OUR SITES AND IRREGULAR SHAPE A 

00:44:13.474 --> 00:44:16.943
HARDSHIP TO THE SITE BECAUSE    
OUR SITES AND IRREGULAR SHAPE A 
LOT OF IT HAS TWO FRONT YARDS   

00:44:16.945 --> 00:44:20.846
OUR SITES AND IRREGULAR SHAPE A 
LOT OF IT HAS TWO FRONT YARDS   
AND ACTUALLY IT'S KIND OF A     

00:44:20.848 --> 00:44:24.250
LOT OF IT HAS TWO FRONT YARDS   
AND ACTUALLY IT'S KIND OF A     
TRIANGULAR SHAPED LOT IS THE    

00:44:24.252 --> 00:44:25.317
AND ACTUALLY IT'S KIND OF A     
TRIANGULAR SHAPED LOT IS THE    
GEOMETRY WHICH WE CONSIDER TO   

00:44:25.319 --> 00:44:27.753
TRIANGULAR SHAPED LOT IS THE    
GEOMETRY WHICH WE CONSIDER TO   
BE UNIQUE.                      

00:44:27.755 --> 00:44:28.787
GEOMETRY WHICH WE CONSIDER TO   
BE UNIQUE.                      
AS YOU CAN SEE THE BUILDING     

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:31.857
BE UNIQUE.                      
AS YOU CAN SEE THE BUILDING     
AREA ON THAT SITE IS LIMITED.   

00:44:31.859 --> 00:44:35.827
AS YOU CAN SEE THE BUILDING     
AREA ON THAT SITE IS LIMITED.   
YOU KNOW, YOU DID ASK ABOUT THE

RESTRICTS THE THE USE ON THE    
SITE THAT STORMWATER BASED AND  

00:44:43.738 --> 00:44:44.670
RESTRICTS THE THE USE ON THE    
SITE THAT STORMWATER BASED AND  
THAT YOU SEE THERE AT OAK BROOK

AS AN OFFICE LIKE IT IS NOW     

00:46:46.627 --> 00:46:47.326
REZONING AND THIS WAS DEVELOPED 
AS AN OFFICE LIKE IT IS NOW     
THERE WOULD BE ZERO SETBACK     

00:46:47.328 --> 00:46:51.029
AS AN OFFICE LIKE IT IS NOW     
THERE WOULD BE ZERO SETBACK     
REQUIRED IF WE REZONE THIS TO A

THERE WOULD BE ZERO SETBACK     
REQUIRED IF WE REZONE THIS TO A 
MIXED USE AND TOOK ADVANTAGE

AND STUFF SO THAT ALL THAT      

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.099
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE GRILLS    
AND STUFF SO THAT ALL THAT      
NOISE IS GOING TO AFFECT OAK    

00:58:01.101 --> 00:58:04.369
AND STUFF SO THAT ALL THAT

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:19.584
OF AFFORDABILITY AND            
SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITABILITY 
IF THIS PROJECT GETS BUILT, THE 

00:58:19.586 --> 00:58:20.318
SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITABILITY 
IF THIS PROJECT GETS BUILT, THE 
CITY WOULD NOT BE ADHERING TO

00:58:26.893 --> 00:58:27.759
THIS PROJECT.                   
I THINK THAT THE PRUDENT THING  
TO DO BEFORE ADDING MORE        

00:58:27.761 --> 00:58:28.560
I THINK THAT THE PRUDENT THING  
TO DO BEFORE ADDING MORE        
HOUSING UNITS TO ANN ARBOR IS   

00:58:28.562 --> 00:58:31.430
TO DO BEFORE ADDING MORE
