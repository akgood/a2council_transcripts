&gt;&gt; IS THERE SOME SORT           

00:29:43.926 --> 00:29:44.591
NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT?        
&gt;&gt; IS THERE SOME SORT

00:29:44.593 --> 00:29:46.559
&gt;&gt; IS THERE SOME SORT           
OF NEGOTIATION ON IF THERE      
NEEDS TO BE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE  

00:29:46.561 --> 00:29:46.760
OF NEGOTIATION ON IF THERE      
NEEDS TO BE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE  
?                               

00:29:46.762 --> 00:29:47.427
NEEDS TO BE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE  
?                               
I THINK SO.                     

00:29:47.429 --> 00:29:48.161
?                               
I THINK SO.                     
I THINK THAT IT&apos;S FAIRLY        

00:29:48.163 --> 00:29:48.562
I THINK SO.                     
I THINK THAT IT&apos;S FAIRLY        
TYPICAL.                        

00:29:48.564 --> 00:29:50.764
I THINK THAT IT&apos;S FAIRLY        
TYPICAL.                        
I MEAN THIS IS A MAJOR          

00:29:50.766 --> 00:29:51.698
TYPICAL.                        
I MEAN THIS IS A MAJOR          
DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ADDING A    

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.634
I MEAN THIS IS A MAJOR          
DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ADDING A    
LOT OF NEW BEDS TO AN AREA THAT 

00:29:54.636 --> 00:29:57.937
DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ADDING A    
LOT OF NEW BEDS TO AN AREA THAT 
ALREADY HAD LIMITED CAPACITY.   

00:29:57.939 --> 00:30:01.474
LOT OF NEW BEDS TO AN AREA THAT 
ALREADY HAD LIMITED CAPACITY.   
SO I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S TYPICAL   

00:30:01.476 --> 00:30:02.476
ALREADY HAD LIMITED CAPACITY.   
SO I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S TYPICAL   
WE WOULDN&apos;T WANT TO I GUESS SET 

00:30:02.478 --> 00:30:03.276
SO I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S TYPICAL   
WE WOULDN&apos;T WANT TO I GUESS SET 
THE EXPECTATION THAT WITH ANY   

00:30:03.278 --> 00:30:06.045
WE WOULDN&apos;T WANT TO I GUESS SET 
THE EXPECTATION THAT WITH ANY   
NEW DEVELOPMENT THIS LEVEL      

00:30:06.047 --> 00:30:06.712
THE EXPECTATION THAT WITH ANY   
NEW DEVELOPMENT THIS LEVEL      
OF SANITARY INFRASTRUCTURE      

00:30:06.714 --> 00:30:09.916
NEW DEVELOPMENT THIS LEVEL      
OF SANITARY INFRASTRUCTURE      
UPGRADE IS GOING TO BE NEEDED.  

00:30:09.918 --> 00:30:11.118
OF SANITARY INFRASTRUCTURE      
UPGRADE IS GOING TO BE NEEDED.

BUT THIS HAD A LOT TO DO WITH   
THE PART OF TOWN THAT IT WAS IN 

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.319
BUT THIS HAD A LOT TO DO WITH   
THE PART OF TOWN THAT IT WAS IN 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THE         

00:30:13.321 --> 00:30:14.054
THE PART OF TOWN THAT IT WAS IN

IT&apos;S NOT ALWAYS WORST.          
FIRST YOU DO YOU NEED A MIX     

00:37:20.315 --> 00:37:23.049
IT&apos;S NOT ALWAYS WORST.          
FIRST YOU DO YOU NEED A MIX

IT HELPS EXTEND THE LIFE        
OF ASSETS AT A MUCH LOWER COST  

00:37:30.558 --> 00:37:31.491
IT HELPS EXTEND THE LIFE

PRESENTS TO ME IS THERE THERE&apos;S 
THE MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING     
CROSSWALK.                      

00:43:05.693 --> 00:43:06.659
THE MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING     
CROSSWALK.                      
THERE IS THE IDENTIFICATION AND 

00:43:06.661 --> 00:43:10.129
CROSSWALK.                      
THERE IS THE IDENTIFICATION AND 
REPAIR OF CROSSWALKS WHEN THERE 

00:43:10.131 --> 00:43:13.632
THERE IS THE IDENTIFICATION AND 
REPAIR OF CROSSWALKS WHEN THERE 
IS SIGNIFICANT RESTRUCTURING    

00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:14.300
REPAIR OF CROSSWALKS WHEN THERE 
IS SIGNIFICANT RESTRUCTURING    
OF A ROADWAY BUT THERE DOESN&apos;T  

00:43:14.302 --> 00:43:18.036
IS SIGNIFICANT RESTRUCTURING    
OF A ROADWAY BUT THERE DOESN&apos;T  
SEEM TO BE A CATCH OR A PLACE   

00:43:18.038 --> 00:43:22.408
OF A ROADWAY BUT THERE DOESN&apos;T  
SEEM TO BE A CATCH OR A PLACE   
FOR THE ADDITION OF CROSSWALK   

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:23.342
SEEM TO BE A CATCH OR A PLACE   
FOR THE ADDITION OF CROSSWALK   
IN PLACES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED. 

00:43:23.344 --> 00:43:26.979
FOR THE ADDITION OF CROSSWALK   
IN PLACES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED. 
AND I WONDER HOW WE AT PLANNING 

00:43:26.981 --> 00:43:29.748
IN PLACES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED. 
AND I WONDER HOW WE AT PLANNING 
WOULD BRING THAT FORWARD AND    

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:30.783
AND I WONDER HOW WE AT PLANNING 
WOULD BRING THAT FORWARD AND    
ARE WE THE RIGHT BODY TO DO     

00:43:30.785 --> 00:43:31.117
WOULD BRING THAT FORWARD AND    
ARE WE THE RIGHT BODY TO DO     
THAT?                           

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:34.153
ARE WE THE RIGHT BODY TO DO     
THAT?                           
IS THAT SOMETHING WE JUST NOTE  

00:43:34.155 --> 00:43:34.854
THAT?                           
IS THAT SOMETHING WE JUST NOTE  
SEND IT TO PLANNING STAFF AND   

00:43:34.856 --> 00:43:38.257
IS THAT SOMETHING WE JUST NOTE  
SEND IT TO PLANNING STAFF AND   
THEN THEY SEND IT TO THE RIGHT  

00:43:38.259 --> 00:43:38.657
SEND IT TO PLANNING STAFF AND   
THEN THEY SEND IT TO THE RIGHT  
DEPARTMENT.                     

00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:39.325
THEN THEY SEND IT TO THE RIGHT  
DEPARTMENT.                     
THAT PERSON TAKES RECEIPT OF IT 

00:43:39.327 --> 00:43:42.161
DEPARTMENT.                     
THAT PERSON TAKES RECEIPT OF IT 
AND THEN COMES TO YOU THROUGH   

00:43:42.163 --> 00:43:44.530
THAT PERSON TAKES RECEIPT OF IT 
AND THEN COMES TO YOU THROUGH   
THAT MECHANISM OR DOES IT COME  

00:43:44.532 --> 00:43:45.097
AND THEN COMES TO YOU THROUGH   
THAT MECHANISM OR DOES IT COME  
FROM THIS TABLE?                

00:43:45.099 --> 00:43:48.800

SO THE QUESTION IS SOMETHING    
THAT MIGHT BE MISSING THAT      

00:43:49.603 --> 00:43:53.005
SO THE QUESTION IS SOMETHING    
THAT MIGHT BE MISSING THAT
