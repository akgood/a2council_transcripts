SAME PLUMBING ARRANGEMENT?      
YES.                            
SO I GUESS WHERE I GOT A LITTLE 

00:16:48.537 --> 00:16:52.172
YES.                            
SO I GUESS WHERE I GOT A LITTLE 
BIT CONFUSED IN THE PACKAGE WAS 

00:16:52.174 --> 00:16:55.977
SO I GUESS WHERE I GOT A LITTLE 
BIT CONFUSED IN THE PACKAGE WAS 
THAT THE PLUMBING INSPECTOR WAS 

00:16:55.979 --> 00:16:58.846
BIT CONFUSED IN THE PACKAGE WAS 
THAT THE PLUMBING INSPECTOR WAS 
OFFERING A CODE PAFF TO SOMEHOW 

00:16:58.848 --> 00:17:06.354
THAT THE PLUMBING INSPECTOR WAS 
OFFERING A CODE PAFF TO SOMEHOW 
MAKE THIS WORK AND IT HAD TO DO 

00:17:06.356 --> 00:17:07.621
OFFERING A CODE PAFF TO SOMEHOW 
MAKE THIS WORK AND IT HAD TO DO 
IT HAD TO DO WITH HAVING A      

00:17:07.623 --> 00:17:10.090
MAKE THIS WORK AND IT HAD TO DO 
IT HAD TO DO WITH HAVING A      
VACUUM BREAK FROM THE FIXTURE   

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:13.727
IT HAD TO DO WITH HAVING A      
VACUUM BREAK FROM THE FIXTURE   
TO THE DRAINAGE POINT.          

00:17:13.729 --> 00:17:14.928
VACUUM BREAK FROM THE FIXTURE   
TO THE DRAINAGE POINT.          
BUT IT ALSO HAD A MAXIMUM       

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.065
TO THE DRAINAGE POINT.          
BUT IT ALSO HAD A MAXIMUM       
CALCULATION OF D.F. USE PER     

00:17:18.067 --> 00:17:21.969
BUT IT ALSO HAD A MAXIMUM       
CALCULATION OF D.F. USE PER     
EIGHT FEET OF DRAINAGE LENGTH.  

00:17:21.971 --> 00:17:26.174
CALCULATION OF D.F. USE PER     
EIGHT FEET OF DRAINAGE LENGTH.  
SO IS THAT EIGHT FEET WITHIN    

00:17:26.176 --> 00:17:30.511
EIGHT FEET OF DRAINAGE LENGTH.  
SO IS THAT EIGHT FEET WITHIN    
THE RUN OUT IN THE IN THE SPACE 

00:17:30.513 --> 00:17:30.911
SO IS THAT EIGHT FEET WITHIN    
THE RUN OUT IN THE IN THE SPACE

THEY CAN STILL BE TWO INCHES    
THAT STILL CAN CARRY THE DFI

I SO I'M I'M NOT I'M PUTTING    

00:23:30.773 --> 00:23:31.638
THERE.                          
I SO I'M I'M NOT I'M PUTTING    
THAT TO THAT BUILDING           

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.872
I SO I'M I'M NOT I'M PUTTING    
THAT TO THAT BUILDING           
DEPARTMENT.                     

00:23:32.874 --> 00:23:33.407
THAT TO THAT BUILDING           
DEPARTMENT.                     
>> YEAH.                        

00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:39.380
DEPARTMENT.                     
>> YEAH.                        

00:23:42.918 --> 00:23:48.855
I KNOW.                         
THERE WE GO.                    
SO I DON'T KNOW FROM FROM WHAT  

00:23:48.857 --> 00:23:51.524
THERE WE GO.                    
SO I DON'T KNOW FROM FROM WHAT  
THE INSPECTOR STATED, I THINK   

00:23:51.526 --> 00:23:52.359
SO I DON'T KNOW FROM FROM WHAT  
THE INSPECTOR STATED, I THINK   
THAT HIS CONCERN IS ADDITIONAL  

00:23:52.361 --> 00:23:55.562
THE INSPECTOR STATED, I THINK   
THAT HIS CONCERN IS ADDITIONAL  
UNKNOWNS OF THE PLUMBING SYSTEM 

00:23:55.564 --> 00:23:59.366
THAT HIS CONCERN IS ADDITIONAL  
UNKNOWNS OF THE PLUMBING SYSTEM 
TO SORT OF PUT LIKE A NUTSHELL  

00:23:59.368 --> 00:24:00.300
UNKNOWNS OF THE PLUMBING SYSTEM 
TO SORT OF PUT LIKE A NUTSHELL  
IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IS   

00:24:00.302 --> 00:24:03.336
TO SORT OF PUT LIKE A NUTSHELL  
IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IS   
GOING INTO THIS LINE.           

00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:04.404
IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IS   
GOING INTO THIS LINE.           
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS OPENED  

00:24:04.406 --> 00:24:05.238
GOING INTO THIS LINE.           
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS OPENED  
UP WAS THE STUFF ON THE         

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.608
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS OPENED  
UP WAS THE STUFF ON THE         
BATHROOM SIDE OF THIS ONE UNIT. 

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.411
UP WAS THE STUFF ON THE         
BATHROOM SIDE OF THIS ONE UNIT. 
SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS    

00:24:11.413 --> 00:24:12.179
BATHROOM SIDE OF THIS ONE UNIT. 
SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS    
PART OF THE INSPECTORS CONCERN. 

00:24:12.181 --> 00:24:15.649
SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS    
PART OF THE INSPECTORS CONCERN. 
SO THE WAY THE DRAWING LOOKS,   

00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:16.383
PART OF THE INSPECTORS CONCERN. 
SO THE WAY THE DRAWING LOOKS,   
YOU'VE GOT THE WASHING MACHINE  

00:24:16.385 --> 00:24:19.619
SO THE WAY THE DRAWING LOOKS,   
YOU'VE GOT THE WASHING MACHINE  
GOING INTO ONE SERVICE THAT     

00:24:19.621 --> 00:24:20.053
YOU'VE GOT THE WASHING MACHINE  
GOING INTO ONE SERVICE THAT     
HITS THE STACK.                 

00:24:20.055 --> 00:24:23.157
GOING INTO ONE SERVICE THAT     
HITS THE STACK.                 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SINK IS       

00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:24.024
HITS THE STACK.                 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SINK IS       
ACTUALLY A SEPARATE DRAIN THAT  

00:24:24.026 --> 00:24:26.627
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SINK IS       
ACTUALLY A SEPARATE DRAIN THAT  
GOES TO THE STACK AND THEN      

00:24:26.629 --> 00:24:27.361
ACTUALLY A SEPARATE DRAIN THAT  
GOES TO THE STACK AND THEN      
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THE TOILET    

00:24:27.363 --> 00:24:28.094
GOES TO THE STACK AND THEN      
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THE TOILET    
SOMEWHERE THAT GETS TO THE      

00:24:28.096 --> 00:24:30.864
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THE TOILET    
SOMEWHERE THAT GETS TO THE      
STACK AND IS THERE ANYBODY UP

00:25:37.933 --> 00:25:38.599
IS NOT PRETTY YOU KNOW I WELL I 
MEAN THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD IT IS 
THAT BY DISCHARGING INTO THE    

00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:41.935
MEAN THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD IT IS 
THAT BY DISCHARGING INTO THE    
SINK THERE'S A BIGGER VESSEL TO 

00:25:41.937 --> 00:25:45.105
THAT BY DISCHARGING INTO THE    
SINK THERE'S A BIGGER VESSEL TO 
HOLD THE WATER TO SLOW THE      

00:25:45.107 --> 00:25:48.876
SINK THERE'S A BIGGER VESSEL TO 
HOLD THE WATER TO SLOW THE      
DRAINAGE IMPACT AND SO YOU      

00:25:48.878 --> 00:25:49.809
HOLD THE WATER TO SLOW THE      
DRAINAGE IMPACT AND SO YOU      
COULD BE COULD BE COULD BE A    

00:25:49.811 --> 00:25:52.879
DRAINAGE IMPACT AND SO YOU      
COULD BE COULD BE COULD BE A    
DRAIN IN THE BOTTOM KNOW I MEAN

TO KNEW IT WOULD BE A LAUNDRY   
SINK.                           
SO IT I MEAN THERE ARE MULTIPLE 

00:26:03.793 --> 00:26:07.628

PROBLEMS HERE.                  
ONE IS THE CODE IS THE CODE I   
MEAN THE BUILDING IS CLASSIFIED 

00:26:11.634 --> 00:26:12.366
ONE IS THE CODE IS THE CODE I   
MEAN THE BUILDING IS CLASSIFIED 
AS AN R TO YEAH.

COMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL BUILDING 
AND THAT'S THAT'S IT.           
THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NOTHING

00:35:08.637 --> 00:35:12.071
LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF THE     
TOTAL DIFFUSE THAT MIGHT BE ON  
ON A LINE BECAUSE AGAIN HE'S    

00:35:12.073 --> 00:35:16.342
TOTAL DIFFUSE THAT MIGHT BE ON  
ON A LINE BECAUSE AGAIN HE'S    
REFERENCING YOU KNOW, THAT YOU  

00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:17.343
ON A LINE BECAUSE AGAIN HE'S    
REFERENCING YOU KNOW, THAT YOU  
CAN ONLY A TWO INCH STACK CAN   

00:35:17.345 --> 00:35:20.013
REFERENCING YOU KNOW, THAT YOU  
CAN ONLY A TWO INCH STACK CAN   
ONLY RECEIVE SIXTY F USE IN A   

00:35:20.015 --> 00:35:23.250
CAN ONLY A TWO INCH STACK CAN

IN A ONE BRANCH INTERVAL.       
EVERY EIGHT FEET OF PIPE IS     

00:35:24.119 --> 00:35:27.254
IN A ONE BRANCH INTERVAL.       
EVERY EIGHT FEET OF PIPE IS     
CONSIDERED A BRANCH INTERVALE.  

00:35:27.256 --> 00:35:30.990
EVERY EIGHT FEET OF PIPE IS     
CONSIDERED A BRANCH INTERVALE.  
SO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT    

00:35:30.992 --> 00:35:31.825
CONSIDERED A BRANCH INTERVALE.  
SO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT    
HORIZONTAL RUN WITHIN THE UNIT  

00:35:31.827 --> 00:35:34.694
SO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT    
HORIZONTAL RUN WITHIN THE UNIT  
IS EIGHT FEET OR THE TOTAL      

00:35:34.696 --> 00:35:39.231
HORIZONTAL RUN WITHIN THE UNIT  
IS EIGHT FEET OR THE TOTAL      
HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL RUN     

00:35:39.233 --> 00:35:42.402
IS EIGHT FEET OR THE TOTAL      
HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL RUN     
OF A I MEAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T  

00:35:42.404 --> 00:35:46.205
HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL RUN     
OF A I MEAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T  
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S      

00:35:46.207 --> 00:35:47.140

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S      
PROBABLY CONNECTING TO A LARGER 

00:35:47.142 --> 00:35:50.543
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S      
PROBABLY CONNECTING TO A LARGER 
PIPE BUT IF HE WERE IF THE      

00:35:50.545 --> 00:35:51.244
PROBABLY CONNECTING TO A LARGER 
PIPE BUT IF HE WERE IF THE      
CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S GOING   

00:35:51.246 --> 00:35:53.045
PIPE BUT IF HE WERE IF THE      
CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S GOING   
TO BE A PROBLEM ON THE LOWER    

00:35:53.047 --> 00:35:58.250
CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S GOING   
TO BE A PROBLEM ON THE LOWER

THAT APPLY TO THAT STRUCTURE.   
SO AT SOME POINT THE CODE MUST  

00:44:06.207 --> 00:44:06.872
THAT APPLY TO THAT STRUCTURE.   
SO AT SOME POINT THE CODE MUST  
HAVE CHANGED BECAUSE IF THERE'S

SO AT SOME POINT THE CODE MUST  
HAVE CHANGED BECAUSE IF THERE'S

00:51:21.609 --> 00:51:22.474
SOLUTION FOR YOU.               
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT        
REQUIRES MAKING SURE THAT YOU
