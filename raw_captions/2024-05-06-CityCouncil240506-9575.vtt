FOR THIS BUILDING BUT A FEW     

00:51:42.536 --> 00:51:44.236
REFERENCED AS A HEIGHT MATCH    
FOR THIS BUILDING BUT A FEW     
BLOCKS BETWEEN SEVEN-ELEVEN     

00:51:44.238 --> 00:51:45.104
FOR THIS BUILDING BUT A FEW     
BLOCKS BETWEEN SEVEN-ELEVEN     
CHURCH AND 536 ARE FORCED TO    

00:51:45.106 --> 00:51:48.440
BLOCKS BETWEEN SEVEN-ELEVEN     
CHURCH AND 536 ARE FORCED TO    
MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE.   

00:51:48.442 --> 00:51:49.441
CHURCH AND 536 ARE FORCED TO    
MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE.   
AND I I GUESS I DON'T REALLY    

00:51:49.443 --> 00:51:50.108
MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE.   
AND I I GUESS I DON'T REALLY    
UNDERSTAND WHY IF 17 STOREYS    

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.778
AND I I GUESS I DON'T REALLY    
UNDERSTAND WHY IF 17 STOREYS    
WAS A FINANCIAL AND ESTHETIC    

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.445
UNDERSTAND WHY IF 17 STOREYS    
WAS A FINANCIAL AND ESTHETIC    
GOAL FOR THIS BUILDING, WHY     

00:51:53.447 --> 00:51:54.213
WAS A FINANCIAL AND ESTHETIC    
GOAL FOR THIS BUILDING, WHY     
THEY DIDN'T SEEK A PARCEL THAT  

00:51:54.215 --> 00:51:57.015
GOAL FOR THIS BUILDING, WHY     
THEY DIDN'T SEEK A PARCEL THAT  
WAS ALREADY IN THE D ONE AREA I 

00:51:57.017 --> 00:52:00.419
THEY DIDN'T SEEK A PARCEL THAT  
WAS ALREADY IN THE D ONE AREA I 
SEE LIKE VACANT LOTS ALONGSIDE  

00:52:00.421 --> 00:52:01.353
WAS ALREADY IN THE D ONE AREA I 
SEE LIKE VACANT LOTS ALONGSIDE  
WITH YOU THAT NEED TO BE BUILT  

00:52:01.355 --> 00:52:04.189
SEE LIKE VACANT LOTS ALONGSIDE  
WITH YOU THAT NEED TO BE BUILT  
ON AND OTHER AREAS WHERE IT     

00:52:04.191 --> 00:52:05.056
WITH YOU THAT NEED TO BE BUILT  
ON AND OTHER AREAS WHERE IT     
SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD MAKE MORE 

00:52:05.058 --> 00:52:05.391
ON AND OTHER AREAS WHERE IT     
SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD MAKE MORE 
SENSE.                          

00:52:05.393 --> 00:52:08.894
SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD MAKE MORE 
SENSE.                          
SO I CERTAINLY THINK THAT A     

00:52:08.896 --> 00:52:09.695
SENSE.                          
SO I CERTAINLY THINK THAT A     
DEVELOPMENT ON THE SITE MAKES   

00:52:09.697 --> 00:52:12.831
SO I CERTAINLY THINK THAT A     
DEVELOPMENT ON THE SITE MAKES   
SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE     

00:52:12.833 --> 00:52:13.632
DEVELOPMENT ON THE SITE MAKES   
SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE     
GROWING UNIVERSITY STUDENT BODY 

00:52:13.634 --> 00:52:16.568
SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE     
GROWING UNIVERSITY STUDENT BODY 
AND AN EXPANDING DOWNTOWN AREA  

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:17.503
GROWING UNIVERSITY STUDENT BODY 
AND AN EXPANDING DOWNTOWN AREA  
SO THAT WE CAN MEET THE HOUSING 

00:52:17.505 --> 00:52:19.371
AND AN EXPANDING DOWNTOWN AREA  
SO THAT WE CAN MEET THE HOUSING 
NEEDS IN ANN ARBOR.             

00:52:19.373 --> 00:52:20.372
SO THAT WE CAN MEET THE HOUSING 
NEEDS IN ANN ARBOR.             
BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE      

00:52:20.374 --> 00:52:21.040
NEEDS IN ANN ARBOR.             
BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE      
HEIGHT OF THIS STRUCTURE IS     

00:52:21.042 --> 00:52:23.375
BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE      
HEIGHT OF THIS STRUCTURE IS     
DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE         

00:52:23.377 --> 00:52:24.009
HEIGHT OF THIS STRUCTURE IS     
DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE         
NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS AND       

00:52:24.011 --> 00:52:24.410
DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE         
NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS AND       
BLOCKS.                         

00:52:24.412 --> 00:52:27.712
NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS AND       
BLOCKS.                         
AS I WAS TRYING TO READ THROUGH 

00:52:27.714 --> 00:52:28.447
BLOCKS.                         
AS I WAS TRYING TO READ THROUGH 
THE PRETTY REGULATIONS IT SEEMS 

00:52:28.449 --> 00:52:31.450
AS I WAS TRYING TO READ THROUGH 
THE PRETTY REGULATIONS IT SEEMS 
LIKE THAT REQUIREMENT IS TWO    

00:52:31.452 --> 00:52:32.318
THE PRETTY REGULATIONS IT SEEMS 
LIKE THAT REQUIREMENT IS TWO    
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN FEET TALL 

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.118
LIKE THAT REQUIREMENT IS TWO    
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN FEET TALL 
AND THIS ONE SEEMS LIKE IT WILL 

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.954
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN FEET TALL 
AND THIS ONE SEEMS LIKE IT WILL 
BE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THE   

00:52:35.956 --> 00:52:38.724
AND THIS ONE SEEMS LIKE IT WILL 
BE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THE   
STEPPING DOWN THAT THE          

00:52:38.726 --> 00:52:39.524
BE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THE   
STEPPING DOWN THAT THE          
DEVELOPERS INDICATED THAT THEY  

00:52:39.526 --> 00:52:42.728
STEPPING DOWN THAT THE          
DEVELOPERS INDICATED THAT THEY  
WERE GOING TO INCORPORATE INTO  

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:43.562
DEVELOPERS INDICATED THAT THEY  
WERE GOING TO INCORPORATE INTO  
THE DESIGN FROM SEVENTEEN TO    

00:52:43.564 --> 00:52:47.065
WERE GOING TO INCORPORATE INTO  
THE DESIGN FROM SEVENTEEN TO    
TWELVE STORIES IT DOESN'T       

00:52:47.067 --> 00:52:47.700
THE DESIGN FROM SEVENTEEN TO    
TWELVE STORIES IT DOESN'T       
REALLY CHANGE THE VERTICAL      

00:52:47.702 --> 00:52:48.433
TWELVE STORIES IT DOESN'T       
REALLY CHANGE THE VERTICAL      
FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING.      

00:52:48.435 --> 00:52:50.468
REALLY CHANGE THE VERTICAL      
FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING.      
SO THE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT WILL  

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:51.236
FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING.      
SO THE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT WILL  
BE REALLY IT'LL BE TOTALLY      

00:52:51.238 --> 00:52:51.970
SO THE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT WILL  
BE REALLY IT'LL BE TOTALLY      
BLOCKED FROM THE CHILDREN'S     

00:52:51.972 --> 00:52:54.873
BE REALLY IT'LL BE TOTALLY      
BLOCKED FROM THE CHILDREN'S     
CENTER AND ALSO FROM OTHER      

00:52:54.875 --> 00:52:57.709
BLOCKED FROM THE CHILDREN'S     
CENTER AND ALSO FROM OTHER      
AREAS AROUND IT.                

00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:02.314
CENTER AND ALSO FROM OTHER      
AREAS AROUND IT.                
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF    

00:53:02.316 --> 00:53:03.048
AREAS AROUND IT.                
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF    
IT'S POSSIBLE TO NEGOTIATE A    

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:03.716
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF    
IT'S POSSIBLE TO NEGOTIATE A    
MORE MODERATE HEIGHT PERHAPS TO 

00:53:03.718 --> 00:53:05.985
IT'S POSSIBLE TO NEGOTIATE A    
MORE MODERATE HEIGHT PERHAPS TO

QUALITATIVE MEASURE             

02:25:42.003 --> 02:25:46.372
SO LEVEL OF SERVICE IS A        
QUALITATIVE MEASURE             
OF MOTORISTS DELAY AND IT WAS   

02:25:46.374 --> 02:25:47.139
QUALITATIVE MEASURE             
OF MOTORISTS DELAY AND IT WAS   
FIRST DEVELOPED FOR HIGHWAYS IN

OF MOTORISTS DELAY AND IT WAS   
FIRST DEVELOPED FOR HIGHWAYS IN

IT'S REALLY KIND OF CONSIDERED  

02:25:53.781 --> 02:25:54.580

IT'S REALLY KIND OF CONSIDERED  
AN OUTDATED MEASURE FOR SEVERAL 
KEY REASONS.                    

02:25:57.418 --> 02:25:58.318
AN OUTDATED MEASURE FOR SEVERAL 
KEY REASONS.                    
SO FIRST IT DOESN'T SOLVE FOR   

02:25:58.320 --> 02:25:58.785
KEY REASONS.                    
SO FIRST IT DOESN'T SOLVE FOR   
THE PROBLEM.                    

02:25:58.787 --> 02:26:01.554
SO FIRST IT DOESN'T SOLVE FOR   
THE PROBLEM.                    
IT WAS DESIGNED TO SOLVE        

02:26:01.556 --> 02:26:01.888
THE PROBLEM.                    
IT WAS DESIGNED TO SOLVE        
CONGESTION.                     

02:26:01.890 --> 02:26:04.490
IT WAS DESIGNED TO SOLVE        
CONGESTION.                     
SECOND, CONGESTION IS A PRETTY  

02:26:04.492 --> 02:26:08.295
CONGESTION.                     
SECOND, CONGESTION IS A PRETTY  
POOR MEASURE OF HARM AND THIRD  

02:26:08.297 --> 02:26:09.095
SECOND, CONGESTION IS A PRETTY  
POOR MEASURE OF HARM AND THIRD  
AND IT FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON   

02:26:09.097 --> 02:26:12.665
POOR MEASURE OF HARM AND THIRD  
AND IT FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON   
HARMS RATHER THAN BENEFITS AND  

02:26:12.667 --> 02:26:13.466
AND IT FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON   
HARMS RATHER THAN BENEFITS AND  
SO IT BIASES TO NEGATIVE        

02:26:13.468 --> 02:26:13.866
HARMS RATHER THAN BENEFITS AND  
SO IT BIASES TO NEGATIVE        
EVALUATIONS.                    

02:26:13.868 --> 02:26:17.204
SO IT BIASES TO NEGATIVE

WHAT DRIVES THIS DECISION IS    

02:52:04.218 --> 02:52:07.118
DECISION.                       
WHAT DRIVES THIS DECISION IS    
THE STANDARDS OF THE PD AND     

02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:08.053
WHAT DRIVES THIS DECISION IS    
THE STANDARDS OF THE PD AND     
THAT IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS BUT 

02:52:08.055 --> 02:52:08.720
THE STANDARDS OF THE PD AND     
THAT IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS BUT 
NOT THE ONLY THOUGH THE         

02:52:08.722 --> 02:52:11.690
THAT IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS BUT 
NOT THE ONLY THOUGH THE         
QUESTION WAS RAISED AND THE     

02:52:11.692 --> 02:52:12.424
NOT THE ONLY THOUGH THE         
QUESTION WAS RAISED AND THE     
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE      

02:52:12.426 --> 02:52:15.761
QUESTION WAS RAISED AND THE     
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE      
RIGHT NOW IS BRINGING IN JUST   

02:52:15.763 --> 02:52:18.363
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE      
RIGHT NOW IS BRINGING IN JUST   
OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 

02:52:18.365 --> 02:52:19.164
RIGHT NOW IS BRINGING IN JUST   
OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 
AND SO THAT CONTRIBUTION IS     

02:52:19.166 --> 02:52:22.767
OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 
AND SO THAT CONTRIBUTION IS     
LIKE ANOTHER YEAR AND AS OTHERS 

02:52:22.769 --> 02:52:26.337
AND SO THAT CONTRIBUTION IS     
LIKE ANOTHER YEAR AND AS OTHERS 
HAVE SAID, IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T  

02:52:26.339 --> 02:52:27.171
LIKE ANOTHER YEAR AND AS OTHERS 
HAVE SAID, IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T  
TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO DOLLARS 

02:52:27.173 --> 02:52:30.642
HAVE SAID, IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T  
TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO DOLLARS 
OF UH THE DOLLARS DON'T         

02:52:30.644 --> 02:52:31.442
TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO DOLLARS 
OF UH THE DOLLARS DON'T         
TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO UNITS   

02:52:31.444 --> 02:52:34.979
OF UH THE DOLLARS DON'T         
TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO UNITS   
BECAUSE THOSE DOLLARS WILL BE   

02:52:34.981 --> 02:52:38.716
TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO UNITS   
BECAUSE THOSE DOLLARS WILL BE   
LEVERAGED TO GET FEDERAL AND    

02:52:38.718 --> 02:52:39.717
BECAUSE THOSE DOLLARS WILL BE   
LEVERAGED TO GET FEDERAL AND    
STATE GRANTS AS WELL AS PRIVATE 

02:52:39.719 --> 02:52:41.453
LEVERAGED TO GET FEDERAL AND    
STATE GRANTS AS WELL AS PRIVATE 
MONEY.

STATE GRANTS AS WELL AS PRIVATE 
MONEY.                          
AND SO SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS    

02:52:42.555 --> 02:52:45.890
MONEY.                          
AND SO SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS    
MAY BE WORTH TWENTY ONE TO      

02:52:45.892 --> 02:52:46.691
AND SO SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS    
MAY BE WORTH TWENTY ONE TO      
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION WHEN WE'RE 

02:52:46.693 --> 02:52:49.561
MAY BE WORTH TWENTY ONE TO      
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION WHEN WE'RE 
DONE USING IT TO GET GRANTS.    

02:52:49.563 --> 02:52:50.495
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION WHEN WE'RE 
DONE USING IT TO GET GRANTS.    
>> SO THAT'S A LOT.             

02:52:50.497 --> 02:52:53.665
DONE USING IT TO GET GRANTS.    
>> SO THAT'S A LOT.             
UM, YOU ASKED ABOUT SHEILD.

I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT  
A NINETEEN STOREY BUILDING IS   

02:52:57.003 --> 02:52:57.935
I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT  
A NINETEEN STOREY BUILDING IS   
WHAT THEY CAME IN WITH FIRST    

02:52:57.937 --> 02:53:01.139
A NINETEEN STOREY BUILDING IS   
WHAT THEY CAME IN WITH FIRST    
AND IN RESPONSE TO I THINK      

02:53:01.141 --> 02:53:04.509
WHAT THEY CAME IN WITH FIRST    
AND IN RESPONSE TO I THINK      
ENTIRELY REASONABLE CONCERNS    

02:53:04.511 --> 02:53:05.376
AND IN RESPONSE TO I THINK      
ENTIRELY REASONABLE CONCERNS    
AND QUESTIONS ABOUT TRADE THEY  

02:53:05.378 --> 02:53:08.980
ENTIRELY REASONABLE CONCERNS    
AND QUESTIONS ABOUT TRADE THEY  
DROPPED TWO STORIES AT THE      

02:53:08.982 --> 02:53:12.383
AND QUESTIONS ABOUT TRADE THEY  
DROPPED TWO STORIES AT THE      
NORTH END AND THEY STEPPED DOWN 

02:53:12.385 --> 02:53:13.251
DROPPED TWO STORIES AT THE      
NORTH END AND THEY STEPPED DOWN 
TO TWELVE STORIES AT THE SOUTH  

02:53:13.253 --> 02:53:16.687
NORTH END AND THEY STEPPED DOWN 
TO TWELVE STORIES AT THE SOUTH  
END TO PRECISELY TO REDUCE      

02:53:16.689 --> 02:53:17.556
TO TWELVE STORIES AT THE SOUTH  
END TO PRECISELY TO REDUCE      
SHADING ON THE TOWNSLEY CENTER. 

02:53:17.558 --> 02:53:19.891
END TO PRECISELY TO REDUCE      
SHADING ON THE TOWNSLEY CENTER. 
SO THEY STEPPED DOWN SEVEN      

02:53:19.893 --> 02:53:23.928
SHADING ON THE TOWNSLEY CENTER. 
SO THEY STEPPED DOWN SEVEN      
STORIES TO TWELVE ON THE ON THE 

02:53:23.930 --> 02:53:24.795
SO THEY STEPPED DOWN SEVEN      
STORIES TO TWELVE ON THE ON THE 
SOUTH END AND THAT REDUCED THE  

02:53:24.797 --> 02:53:27.866
STORIES TO TWELVE ON THE ON THE 
SOUTH END AND THAT REDUCED THE  
NUMBER OF UNITS FROM 350 TO TWO 

02:53:27.868 --> 02:53:28.533
SOUTH END AND THAT REDUCED THE  
NUMBER OF UNITS FROM 350 TO TWO 
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE.      

02:53:28.535 --> 02:53:29.267
NUMBER OF UNITS FROM 350 TO TWO 
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE.      
SO THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT       

02:53:29.269 --> 02:53:31.769
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE.      
SO THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT       
CHANGE IN THE PROJECT.

03:28:10.448 --> 03:28:11.246
SO THE PROJECT WILL BE TWO      
POINT SIX TIMES THE UNDERLYING  
DENSITY OF THE EXISTING ZONING  

03:28:11.248 --> 03:28:14.717
POINT SIX TIMES THE UNDERLYING  
DENSITY OF THE EXISTING ZONING  
WHICH IS CURRENTLY THREE        

03:28:14.719 --> 03:28:15.417
DENSITY OF THE EXISTING ZONING  
WHICH IS CURRENTLY THREE

03:28:15.419 --> 03:28:18.821
WHICH IS CURRENTLY THREE        
HUNDRED FLOOR AREA RATIO.       
THIS PROJECT WOULD BE 795 FLOOR 

03:28:18.823 --> 03:28:19.689
HUNDRED FLOOR AREA RATIO.       
THIS PROJECT WOULD BE 795 FLOOR 
AREA RATIO SO TWO POINT SIX     

03:28:19.691 --> 03:28:20.290
THIS PROJECT WOULD BE 795 FLOOR 
AREA RATIO SO TWO POINT SIX     
TIMES IT WILL DELIVER.          

03:28:20.292 --> 03:28:23.225
AREA RATIO SO TWO POINT SIX     
TIMES IT WILL DELIVER.          
HOWEVER THREE HUNDRED AND       

03:28:23.227 --> 03:28:26.829
TIMES IT WILL DELIVER.          
HOWEVER THREE HUNDRED AND       
SEVENTY SIX UNITS OF HOUSING    

03:28:26.831 --> 03:28:27.896
HOWEVER THREE HUNDRED AND       
SEVENTY SIX UNITS OF HOUSING    
WHICH IS MORE THAN TEN TIMES    

03:28:27.898 --> 03:28:30.266
SEVENTY SIX UNITS OF HOUSING    
WHICH IS MORE THAN TEN TIMES    
THE NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS    

03:28:30.268 --> 03:28:31.066
WHICH IS MORE THAN TEN TIMES    
THE NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS    
THAT THE PARCELS CURRENTLY      

03:28:31.068 --> 03:28:35.271
THE NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS    
THAT THE PARCELS CURRENTLY      
PROVIDE WHICH IS THIRTY THREE   

03:28:35.273 --> 03:28:38.907
THAT THE PARCELS CURRENTLY      
PROVIDE WHICH IS THIRTY THREE   
THIRTY THREE DWELLING UNITS.    

03:28:38.909 --> 03:28:39.976
PROVIDE WHICH IS THIRTY THREE   
THIRTY THREE DWELLING UNITS.    
SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD RATIO     

03:28:39.978 --> 03:28:42.277
THIRTY THREE DWELLING UNITS.    
SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD RATIO     
OF DENSITY INCREASE TO HOUSING  

03:28:42.279 --> 03:28:42.645
SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD RATIO     
OF DENSITY INCREASE TO HOUSING  
UNIT INCREASE.                  

03:28:42.647 --> 03:28:45.715
