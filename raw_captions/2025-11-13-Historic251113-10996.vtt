BELIEVED THAT THAT A DOME       
COVER OVER ABOVE THAT WOULD BE  

00:25:50.004 --> 00:25:53.038
BELIEVED THAT THAT A DOME       
COVER OVER ABOVE THAT WOULD BE  
NECESSARY TO PROTECT WATER FROM

WHAT I THINK IRISH COMPANIES    

00:25:57.311 --> 00:25:58.143
PROTECT FROM WATER.             
WHAT I THINK IRISH COMPANIES    
HAVE FOUND OVER THE YEARS IS    

00:25:58.145 --> 00:26:00.812
WHAT I THINK IRISH COMPANIES    
HAVE FOUND OVER THE YEARS IS    
THAT THE METAL GRATES ALLOW A   

00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:01.579
HAVE FOUND OVER THE YEARS IS    
THAT THE METAL GRATES ALLOW A   
LOT OF DEBRIS TO FALL IN THERE  

00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:03.915
THAT THE METAL GRATES ALLOW A   
LOT OF DEBRIS TO FALL IN THERE  
WHICH A LOT MAKES YOU HAVE TO   

00:26:03.917 --> 00:26:04.883
LOT OF DEBRIS TO FALL IN THERE  
WHICH A LOT MAKES YOU HAVE TO   
GO DOWN IN THERE AND DIG IT

WHICH A LOT MAKES YOU HAVE TO   
GO DOWN IN THERE AND DIG IT     
OUT.                            

00:26:05.252 --> 00:26:07.919
GO DOWN IN THERE AND DIG IT     
OUT.                            
IT DOES STOP SOME RAIN.

IT DOES STOP SOME RAIN.         
IT DOESN'T STOP ONE HUNDRED     

00:26:08.756 --> 00:26:09.654
IT DOES STOP SOME RAIN.         
IT DOESN'T STOP ONE HUNDRED     
PERCENT BUT IT DOES STOP NINETY 

00:26:09.656 --> 00:26:12.357
IT DOESN'T STOP ONE HUNDRED     
PERCENT BUT IT DOES STOP NINETY 
NINE PERCENT OF ALL THE DEBRIS  

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:13.224
PERCENT BUT IT DOES STOP NINETY 
NINE PERCENT OF ALL THE DEBRIS  
LEAVES LIKE YOU SEE IN FRONT    

00:26:13.226 --> 00:26:13.759
NINE PERCENT OF ALL THE DEBRIS  
LEAVES LIKE YOU SEE IN FRONT    
OF THE WINDOW THERE.            

00:26:13.761 --> 00:26:16.194
LEAVES LIKE YOU SEE IN FRONT    
OF THE WINDOW THERE.            
NOW THAT LEAVES FALLING FROM    

00:26:16.196 --> 00:26:16.895
OF THE WINDOW THERE.            
NOW THAT LEAVES FALLING FROM    
ABOVE WOULD FALL ONTO IT.       

00:26:16.897 --> 00:26:19.164
NOW THAT LEAVES FALLING FROM    
ABOVE WOULD FALL ONTO IT.       
IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR SMALL      

00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:20.065
ABOVE WOULD FALL ONTO IT.       
IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR SMALL      
CHILDREN TO PUSH THE COVER OFF  

00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:23.035
IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR SMALL

00:33:55.488 --> 00:33:56.254
SEE IS MAYBE THE FEWEST         
MATERIALS POSSIBLE IN THIS      
LOCATION SO THAT YOUR EYE IS    

00:33:56.256 --> 00:33:58.556
MATERIALS POSSIBLE IN THIS      
LOCATION SO THAT YOUR EYE IS    
NOT DRAWN TO IT AND I THINK     

00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:03.228
LOCATION SO THAT YOUR EYE IS    
NOT DRAWN TO IT AND I THINK     
THAT, YOU KNOW, FILLING IN AN   

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.596
NOT DRAWN TO IT AND I THINK     
THAT, YOU KNOW, FILLING IN AN   
IN FILLING SOMETHING WITH GLASS 

00:34:05.598 --> 00:34:06.431
THAT, YOU KNOW, FILLING IN AN   
IN FILLING SOMETHING WITH GLASS 
BLOCK I THINK IS IS MORE OR

STANDARDS.                      
BUT I THINK IT'S JUST THE       
COMBINATION OF GLASS BLOCK PLUS 

00:34:10.804 --> 00:34:13.672
BUT I THINK IT'S JUST THE       
COMBINATION OF GLASS BLOCK PLUS 
WINDOW PLUS UNTREATED LUMBER    

00:34:13.674 --> 00:34:14.772
COMBINATION OF GLASS BLOCK PLUS
