METHODOLOGY THE STANDARDS ARE   
SO FLEXIBLE.                    

00:55:24.786 --> 00:55:25.652
METHODOLOGY THE STANDARDS ARE   
SO FLEXIBLE.

00:55:28.223 --> 00:55:29.189
I THINK IT&apos;S SO LATE YOU HAVE   
TO PICK THE STANDARDS THAT FIT  
BEST AND I THINK THAT IS THAT   

00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:31.491
TO PICK THE STANDARDS THAT FIT  
BEST AND I THINK THAT IS THAT   
WOULD YOU MEAN THAT IS IN

FOR ADDITIONS FIT THIS THE BEST 

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:39.065
ADDITION BASICALLY THE STANDARD 
FOR ADDITIONS FIT THIS THE BEST 
SO THEREFORE IT IS ADDING FLOOR 

00:55:39.067 --> 00:55:40.333
FOR ADDITIONS FIT THIS THE BEST 
SO THEREFORE IT IS ADDING FLOOR 
AREA TO THE HOUSE THAT DOES NOT 

00:55:40.335 --> 00:55:46.440
SO THEREFORE IT IS ADDING FLOOR 
AREA TO THE HOUSE THAT DOES NOT 
EXIST CURRENTLY                 

00:56:00.288 --> 00:56:07.894

WOULD YOU THAT&apos;S THE MINIMUM    

01:37:05.851 --> 01:37:06.584
SO AT A MINIMUM THAT&apos;S WHAT     
WOULD YOU THAT&apos;S THE MINIMUM    
THAT WOULD MAKE WHAT&apos;S THERE    

01:37:06.586 --> 01:37:11.723
WOULD YOU THAT&apos;S THE MINIMUM    
THAT WOULD MAKE WHAT&apos;S THERE    
NOW LEGAL.                      

01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:12.923
THAT WOULD MAKE WHAT&apos;S THERE
