&gt;&gt; MY SECOND QUESTION IS WHY    
ISN&apos;T THIS SIMPLY AN ALTERATION 
TO A NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE IF 

00:12:24.307 --> 00:12:24.972
ISN&apos;T THIS SIMPLY AN ALTERATION 
TO A NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE IF 
YOU&apos;RE TAKING THE EXISTING

AN EIGHTY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE 
AN ALTERATION AND WOULD NOT     
MAKE THIS A CONFORMING          

00:12:37.453 --> 00:12:38.119
AN ALTERATION AND WOULD NOT     
MAKE THIS A CONFORMING          
STRUCTURE, THE ONLY THE

SO GO AHEAD, DAVE.              

00:13:06.749 --> 00:13:07.347
ALL RIGHT.                      
SO GO AHEAD, DAVE.              
&gt;&gt; ONE MORE QUESTION.           

00:13:07.349 --> 00:13:08.082
SO GO AHEAD, DAVE.              
&gt;&gt; ONE MORE QUESTION.           
SO THE 35 PERCENT AREA DOES     

00:13:08.084 --> 00:13:08.850
&gt;&gt; ONE MORE QUESTION.           
SO THE 35 PERCENT AREA DOES     
THAT COUNT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT    

00:13:08.852 --> 00:13:11.019
SO THE 35 PERCENT AREA DOES     
THAT COUNT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT    
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE GARAGE IN 

00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:14.889
THAT COUNT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT    
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE GARAGE IN 
THE HOME KNOW THE THIRTY FIVE   

00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:15.756
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE GARAGE IN 
THE HOME KNOW THE THIRTY FIVE   
PERCENT IS THE REAR SET BACK    

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:18.358
THE HOME KNOW THE THIRTY FIVE   
PERCENT IS THE REAR SET BACK    
AREA WHICH IS THE WIDTH OF THE  

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.995
PERCENT IS THE REAR SET BACK    
AREA WHICH IS THE WIDTH OF THE  
REAR LOT LINE TIMES UP BY       

00:13:21.997 --> 00:13:22.763
AREA WHICH IS THE WIDTH OF THE  
REAR LOT LINE TIMES UP BY       
TWENTY FEET WHICH IS THE SET    

00:13:22.765 --> 00:13:23.097
REAR LOT LINE TIMES UP BY       
TWENTY FEET WHICH IS THE SET    
BACK.                           

00:13:23.099 --> 00:13:25.833
TWENTY FEET WHICH IS THE SET    
BACK.                           
SO ANY STRUCTURE FROM THAT 20   

00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:26.667
BACK.                           
SO ANY STRUCTURE FROM THAT 20   
FOOT SET BACK TOWARDS THE REAR  

00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:29.870
SO ANY STRUCTURE FROM THAT 20   
FOOT SET BACK TOWARDS THE REAR  
OF THE HOME I&apos;LL SHOW YOU MY    

00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:30.671
FOOT SET BACK TOWARDS THE REAR  
OF THE HOME I&apos;LL SHOW YOU MY    
WITH MY CURSOR ON THE SCREEN.   

00:13:30.673 --> 00:13:33.474
OF THE HOME I&apos;LL SHOW YOU MY    
WITH MY CURSOR ON THE SCREEN.   
SO FROM THAT DASHED LINE TO THE 

00:13:33.476 --> 00:13:37.278
WITH MY CURSOR ON THE SCREEN.   
SO FROM THAT DASHED LINE TO THE 
HOME THAT AREA IS NOT COUNTED.  

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.347
SO FROM THAT DASHED LINE TO THE 
HOME THAT AREA IS NOT COUNTED.  
IT&apos;S THIS SECTION RIGHT HERE    

00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:41.182
HOME THAT AREA IS NOT COUNTED.  
IT&apos;S THIS SECTION RIGHT HERE    
THAT YOU CAN&apos;T EXCEED THIRTY    

00:13:41.184 --> 00:13:43.584
IT&apos;S THIS SECTION RIGHT HERE    
THAT YOU CAN&apos;T EXCEED THIRTY    
FIVE PERCENT WITH THE STRUCTURE 

00:13:43.586 --> 00:13:43.785
THAT YOU CAN&apos;T EXCEED THIRTY    
FIVE PERCENT WITH THE STRUCTURE 
.                               

00:13:43.787 --> 00:13:44.652
FIVE PERCENT WITH THE STRUCTURE 
.                               
THAT&apos;S HOW IT&apos;S DETERMINED IN   

00:13:44.654 --> 00:13:47.722
.                               
THAT&apos;S HOW IT&apos;S DETERMINED IN   
THE SECTION IN THE CODE .

THAT&apos;S HOW IT&apos;S DETERMINED IN   
THE SECTION IN THE CODE .       
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S KIND OF WEIRD.       

00:13:48.824 --> 00:13:51.625
THE SECTION IN THE CODE .       
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S KIND OF WEIRD.       
IT&apos;S CALLED YOUR BACK AREA.     

00:13:51.627 --> 00:13:52.627
&gt;&gt; SO IT&apos;S KIND OF WEIRD.       
IT&apos;S CALLED YOUR BACK AREA.     
I KNOW THIS IS ALREADY BUILT    

00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:55.296
IT&apos;S CALLED YOUR BACK AREA.     
I KNOW THIS IS ALREADY BUILT    
BUT HYPOTHETICALLY IF IT        

00:13:55.298 --> 00:13:56.230
I KNOW THIS IS ALREADY BUILT    
BUT HYPOTHETICALLY IF IT        
WEREN&apos;T IN THEY WERE COMING TO  

00:13:56.232 --> 00:13:59.633
BUT HYPOTHETICALLY IF IT        
WEREN&apos;T IN THEY WERE COMING TO  
US TO BUILD IT.

WEREN&apos;T IN THEY WERE COMING TO  
US TO BUILD IT.                 
IF THEY PUT THE THIS HASHED     

00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:06.207
US TO BUILD IT.                 
IF THEY PUT THE THIS HASHED     
AREA THE FLAT ROOF AREA BETWEEN

IF THEY PUT THE THIS HASHED     
AREA THE FLAT ROOF AREA BETWEEN 
ATTACHED TO THE GARAGE BUT      

00:14:07.077 --> 00:14:07.742
AREA THE FLAT ROOF AREA BETWEEN 
ATTACHED TO THE GARAGE BUT      
BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE

&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        

00:14:11.848 --> 00:14:14.715
HOUSE ON THE SOUTH SIDE.        
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
WOULD THEY NEED IT.             

00:14:14.717 --> 00:14:17.618
&gt;&gt; YEAH.                        
WOULD THEY NEED IT.

WOULD THEY NEED IT.             
&gt;&gt; THEY WOULD NOT BUT LIKE I    
SAID, THIS WASN&apos;T PART OF THE   

00:14:18.621 --> 00:14:19.353
&gt;&gt; THEY WOULD NOT BUT LIKE I    
SAID, THIS WASN&apos;T PART OF THE   
ORDINANCE IN NINETEEN SIXTY     

00:14:19.355 --> 00:14:24.758
SAID, THIS WASN&apos;T PART OF THE   
ORDINANCE IN NINETEEN SIXTY     
SEVEN I UNDERSTOOD.             

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.529
ORDINANCE IN NINETEEN SIXTY     
SEVEN I UNDERSTOOD.             
&gt;&gt; RIGHT SO IS THERE A REASON   

00:14:28.531 --> 00:14:29.530
SEVEN I UNDERSTOOD.             
&gt;&gt; RIGHT SO IS THERE A REASON   
WHY THE 80S ARE REQUIRED TO BE  

00:14:29.532 --> 00:14:32.833
&gt;&gt; RIGHT SO IS THERE A REASON   
WHY THE 80S ARE REQUIRED TO BE  
IN A CONFORMING STRUCTURE LIKE  

00:14:32.835 --> 00:14:33.668
WHY THE 80S ARE REQUIRED TO BE  
IN A CONFORMING STRUCTURE LIKE  
I&apos;M JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHY  

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.971
IN A CONFORMING STRUCTURE LIKE  
I&apos;M JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHY  
THAT&apos;S THE CASE AND SINCE THIS  

00:14:36.973 --> 00:14:37.705
I&apos;M JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHY  
THAT&apos;S THE CASE AND SINCE THIS  
IS AN EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT&apos;S 

00:14:37.707 --> 00:14:40.007
THAT&apos;S THE CASE AND SINCE THIS  
IS AN EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT&apos;S 
ALREADY THERE, WHY IS IT JUST   

00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.641
IS AN EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT&apos;S 
ALREADY THERE, WHY IS IT JUST   
SO YOU ORDINANCE FOR THE CITY   

00:14:40.643 --> 00:14:41.375
ALREADY THERE, WHY IS IT JUST   
SO YOU ORDINANCE FOR THE CITY   
THAT WAS ADOPTED IN TWO         

00:14:41.377 --> 00:14:44.244
SO YOU ORDINANCE FOR THE CITY   
THAT WAS ADOPTED IN TWO         
THOUSAND TO EIGHTEEN AND SO     

00:14:44.246 --> 00:14:48.115
THAT WAS ADOPTED IN TWO         
THOUSAND TO EIGHTEEN AND SO     
GENERALLY ALL OF THEM ARE MOST  

00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:48.950
THOUSAND TO EIGHTEEN AND SO     
GENERALLY ALL OF THEM ARE MOST  
OF THEM ARE OUR NEW STRUCTURES. 

00:14:48.952 --> 00:14:52.086
GENERALLY ALL OF THEM ARE MOST  
OF THEM ARE OUR NEW STRUCTURES. 
AND SO WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW     

00:14:52.088 --> 00:14:52.887
OF THEM ARE OUR NEW STRUCTURES. 
AND SO WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW     
STRUCTURE THAT WE CONFORM AND   

00:14:52.889 --> 00:14:53.755
AND SO WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW     
STRUCTURE THAT WE CONFORM AND   
IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN A    

00:14:53.757 --> 00:14:56.190
STRUCTURE THAT WE CONFORM AND   
IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN A    
NOT CONFORMING STRUCTURE, THEY  

00:14:56.192 --> 00:14:56.990
IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN A    
NOT CONFORMING STRUCTURE, THEY  
EITHER HAVE TO MAKE THEM        

00:14:56.992 --> 00:14:59.626
NOT CONFORMING STRUCTURE, THEY
