ABOUT DOING A ACCESSIBLE WALK   
THROUGH ACCESSIBLY WALK THROUGH 

00:18:28.558 --> 00:18:29.290
ABOUT DOING A ACCESSIBLE WALK   
THROUGH ACCESSIBLY WALK THROUGH 
IN ANN ARBOR WHERE THEY HAD     

00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:32.192
THROUGH ACCESSIBLY WALK THROUGH 
IN ANN ARBOR WHERE THEY HAD     
SOME PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WALKING  

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:33.126
IN ANN ARBOR WHERE THEY HAD     
SOME PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WALKING  
AROUND AND THEY MENTIONED THAT  

00:18:33.128 --> 00:18:36.530
SOME PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WALKING  
AROUND AND THEY MENTIONED THAT  
SOME OF OUR CROSSWALKS WERE NOT 

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:37.331
AROUND AND THEY MENTIONED THAT  
SOME OF OUR CROSSWALKS WERE NOT 
FULLY ACCESSIBLE, FOR EXAMPLE,  

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:40.634
SOME OF OUR CROSSWALKS WERE NOT 
FULLY ACCESSIBLE, FOR EXAMPLE,  
LIKE LIGHTS OR NOISE AND THEY   

00:18:40.636 --> 00:18:41.302
FULLY ACCESSIBLE, FOR EXAMPLE,  
LIKE LIGHTS OR NOISE AND THEY   
WERE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO   

00:18:41.304 --> 00:18:44.471
LIKE LIGHTS OR NOISE AND THEY   
WERE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO   
MAY HAVE A VISUAL DISABILITY.   

00:18:44.473 --> 00:18:45.573
WERE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO   
MAY HAVE A VISUAL DISABILITY.   
SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THOSE  

00:18:45.575 --> 00:18:48.642
MAY HAVE A VISUAL DISABILITY.   
SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THOSE  
SORT OF FEATURES ARE BEING ARE  

00:18:48.644 --> 00:18:49.043
SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THOSE  
SORT OF FEATURES ARE BEING ARE  
BEING MADE.                     

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:52.279
SORT OF FEATURES ARE BEING ARE  
BEING MADE.                     
DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S PRETTY WIDE 

00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:53.213
BEING MADE.                     
DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S PRETTY WIDE 
SPREAD IN THE CITY THAT WE HAVE 

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:56.183
DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S PRETTY WIDE 
SPREAD IN THE CITY THAT WE HAVE 
CROSSWALKS OR OTHER PEDESTRIAN  

00:18:56.185 --> 00:18:56.950
SPREAD IN THE CITY THAT WE HAVE 
CROSSWALKS OR OTHER PEDESTRIAN

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.858
OF UP TO ADA OR BEYOND ADA      
STANDARDS?                      
WE WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT  

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.062
STANDARDS?                      
WE WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT  
AS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT       

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:08.930
WE WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT  
AS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT       
FEATURES AND THAT'S THE FIRST   

00:19:08.932 --> 00:19:09.597
AS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT       
FEATURES AND THAT'S THE FIRST   
THING TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN       

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:11.765
FEATURES AND THAT'S THE FIRST   
THING TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN       
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM AS 

00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:16.103
THING TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN       
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM AS 
A WHOLE WHERE WE HAVE EXCELLED  

00:19:16.105 --> 00:19:19.640
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM AS 
A WHOLE WHERE WE HAVE EXCELLED  
IS IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR      

00:19:19.642 --> 00:19:20.708
A WHOLE WHERE WE HAVE EXCELLED  
IS IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR      
RAMPS ARE ALWAYS UP TO ADA      

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.745
IS IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR      
RAMPS ARE ALWAYS UP TO ADA      
COMPLIANCE WHENEVER WE'RE DOING 

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:28.549
RAMPS ARE ALWAYS UP TO ADA      
COMPLIANCE WHENEVER WE'RE DOING 
PROJECTS WE ALSO DO A PRETTY    

00:19:28.551 --> 00:19:31.418
COMPLIANCE WHENEVER WE'RE DOING 
PROJECTS WE ALSO DO A PRETTY    
GOOD JOB OF MAINTAINING OUR     

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.253
PROJECTS WE ALSO DO A PRETTY    
GOOD JOB OF MAINTAINING OUR     
SIDEWALKS AND IT'S NOT PERFECT  

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:35.422
GOOD JOB OF MAINTAINING OUR     
SIDEWALKS AND IT'S NOT PERFECT  
BUT WE DO HAVE A MAINTENANCE    

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:36.123
SIDEWALKS AND IT'S NOT PERFECT  
BUT WE DO HAVE A MAINTENANCE    
PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HAVE THE     

00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:39.260
BUT WE DO HAVE A MAINTENANCE    
PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HAVE THE     
KNOWLEDGE THAT FUNDS SIDEWALK   

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:39.660
PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HAVE THE     
KNOWLEDGE THAT FUNDS SIDEWALK   
MAINTENANCE.                    

00:19:39.662 --> 00:19:42.562
KNOWLEDGE THAT FUNDS SIDEWALK   
MAINTENANCE.                    
WE ARE ROUTINELY EVALUATING FOR 

00:19:42.564 --> 00:19:43.231
MAINTENANCE.                    
WE ARE ROUTINELY EVALUATING FOR 
HAZARDS AND DEVIATIONS IN THE   

00:19:43.233 --> 00:19:44.031
WE ARE ROUTINELY EVALUATING FOR 
HAZARDS AND DEVIATIONS IN THE   
SIDEWALK THAT ARE OUTSIDE       

00:19:44.033 --> 00:19:47.668
HAZARDS AND DEVIATIONS IN THE   
SIDEWALK THAT ARE OUTSIDE       
OF COMPLIANCE CORRECTING THOSE. 

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.735
SIDEWALK THAT ARE OUTSIDE       
OF COMPLIANCE CORRECTING THOSE. 
SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE 

00:19:48.737 --> 00:19:51.672
OF COMPLIANCE CORRECTING THOSE. 
SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE 
DO REALLY, REALLY WE HAVE       

00:19:51.674 --> 00:19:54.275
SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE 
DO REALLY, REALLY WE HAVE       
ACCESSIBLE PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS   

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:55.342
DO REALLY, REALLY WE HAVE       
ACCESSIBLE PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS   
IN A LOT OF LOCATIONS, PLACES   

00:19:55.344 --> 00:20:01.449
ACCESSIBLE PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS   
IN A LOT OF LOCATIONS, PLACES   
WHERE WE'RE                     

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.898
            A LITTLE BIT BEHIND 
IN HAVING THOSE ACCESSIBLE      
PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS IS ACTUALLY  

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.632
IN HAVING THOSE ACCESSIBLE      
PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS IS ACTUALLY  
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE THOSE SIGNALS  

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.367
PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS IS ACTUALLY  
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE THOSE SIGNALS  
RUN AS FREE TIME SIGNALS FOR A  

00:20:20.369 --> 00:20:21.068
DOWNTOWN BECAUSE THOSE SIGNALS  
RUN AS FREE TIME SIGNALS FOR A  
LONG TIME AND DID NOT HAVE      

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.869
RUN AS FREE TIME SIGNALS FOR A  
LONG TIME AND DID NOT HAVE      
PUSHBUTTONS AND THAT IS AN AREA 

00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:22.670
LONG TIME AND DID NOT HAVE      
PUSHBUTTONS AND THAT IS AN AREA 
WHERE WE ARE CATCHING UP AS WE  

00:20:22.672 --> 00:20:23.070
PUSHBUTTONS AND THAT IS AN AREA 
WHERE WE ARE CATCHING UP AS WE  
DO PROJECTS.                    

00:20:23.072 --> 00:20:24.071
WHERE WE ARE CATCHING UP AS WE  
DO PROJECTS.                    
SO WE DO HAVE A SET ASIDE FOR A 

00:20:24.073 --> 00:20:24.805
DO PROJECTS.                    
SO WE DO HAVE A SET ASIDE FOR A 
BUDGET TO INSTALL ACCESSIBLE    

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:26.506
SO WE DO HAVE A SET ASIDE FOR A 
BUDGET TO INSTALL ACCESSIBLE    
PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS AND WE DO    

00:20:26.508 --> 00:20:27.207
BUDGET TO INSTALL ACCESSIBLE    
PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS AND WE DO    
INSTALL ACCESSIBLE PEDESTRIAN   

00:20:27.209 --> 00:20:30.077
PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS AND WE DO    
INSTALL ACCESSIBLE PEDESTRIAN   
SIGNALS PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR. 

00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:33.781
INSTALL ACCESSIBLE PEDESTRIAN   
SIGNALS PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR. 
A LOT OF TIMES WE WILL DO THOSE 

00:20:33.783 --> 00:20:34.448
SIGNALS PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR. 
A LOT OF TIMES WE WILL DO THOSE 
AS PART OF THE CAPITAL
