THERE YOU SEE ON YOUR SCREEN    
WHICH WE&amp;apos;RE A LOT MORE SOLAR    
PANELS.                         

00:23:42.608 --> 00:23:43.807
WHICH WE&amp;apos;RE A LOT MORE SOLAR    
PANELS.                         
BUT AGAIN, AS FOR THE RESEARCH  

00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:45.809
PANELS.                         
BUT AGAIN, AS FOR THE RESEARCH  
AND AS THE POSITION, I ASSUME   

00:23:45.811 --> 00:23:46.710
BUT AGAIN, AS FOR THE RESEARCH  
AND AS THE POSITION, I ASSUME   
HAS GONE THROUGH THE BACKGROUND 

00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:47.511
AND AS THE POSITION, I ASSUME   
HAS GONE THROUGH THE BACKGROUND 
TO PREPARE IT THAT THEY FOUND   

00:23:47.513 --> 00:23:49.646
HAS GONE THROUGH THE BACKGROUND 
TO PREPARE IT THAT THEY FOUND   
OUT THAT THE ROOF CAN&amp;apos;T SUPPORT 

00:23:49.648 --> 00:23:49.847
TO PREPARE IT THAT THEY FOUND   
OUT THAT THE ROOF CAN&amp;apos;T SUPPORT 
.                               

00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:50.647
OUT THAT THE ROOF CAN&amp;apos;T SUPPORT 
.                               
SO WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL        

00:23:50.649 --> 00:23:51.381
.                               
SO WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL        
DOCUMENT DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE  

00:23:51.383 --> 00:23:54.318
SO WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL        
DOCUMENT DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE  
OBVIOUSLY IT IS A REQUIREMENT   

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.051
DOCUMENT DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE  
OBVIOUSLY IT IS A REQUIREMENT   
SINCE IT IS PART OF HIS ONLY    

00:23:55.053 --> 00:23:55.452
OBVIOUSLY IT IS A REQUIREMENT   
SINCE IT IS PART OF HIS ONLY    
REQUIREMENT.                    

00:23:55.454 --> 00:23:58.355
SINCE IT IS PART OF HIS ONLY    
REQUIREMENT.                    
IT IS SUBJECT OBVIOUSLY TO A    

00:23:58.357 --> 00:23:59.022
REQUIREMENT.                    
IT IS SUBJECT OBVIOUSLY TO A    
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS         

00:23:59.024 --> 00:23:59.356
IT IS SUBJECT OBVIOUSLY TO A    
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS         
VARIANCE.                       

00:23:59.358 --> 00:24:01.558
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS         
VARIANCE.                       
BUT I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S THE FIRST    

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.292
VARIANCE.                       
BUT I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S THE FIRST    
ONE THAT YOU&amp;apos;VE SEEN.           

00:24:02.294 --> 00:24:03.093
BUT I BELIEVE IT&amp;apos;S THE FIRST    
ONE THAT YOU&amp;apos;VE SEEN.           
SO THIS IS TRUE.                

00:24:03.095 --> 00:24:06.329
ONE THAT YOU&amp;apos;VE SEEN.           
SO THIS IS TRUE.                
IT&amp;apos;S UNIQUE.                    

00:24:06.331 --> 00:24:07.398
SO THIS IS TRUE.                
IT&amp;apos;S UNIQUE.                    
THIS IS THE ONLY TYPE OF USE    

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.500
IT&amp;apos;S UNIQUE.                    
THIS IS THE ONLY TYPE OF USE    
THAT WE REQUIRE THAT IN THE     

00:24:10.502 --> 00:24:11.201
THIS IS THE ONLY TYPE OF USE    
THAT WE REQUIRE THAT IN THE     
ZONING CODE AS PART OF THE      

00:24:11.203 --> 00:24:13.003
THAT WE REQUIRE THAT IN THE     
ZONING CODE AS PART OF THE      
SOLAR THAT THEY NEED TO         

00:24:13.005 --> 00:24:13.803
ZONING CODE AS PART OF THE      
SOLAR THAT THEY NEED TO         
GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT   

00:24:13.805 --> 00:24:14.538
SOLAR THAT THEY NEED TO         
GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT   
OF THEIR WELL NOT SIGNIFICANT   

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.138
GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT   
OF THEIR WELL NOT SIGNIFICANT   
BUT 10 PERCENT OF THEIR         

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.042
OF THEIR WELL NOT SIGNIFICANT   
BUT 10 PERCENT OF THEIR         
ENERGIES FROM SOLAR.            

00:24:18.044 --> 00:24:19.109
BUT 10 PERCENT OF THEIR         
ENERGIES FROM SOLAR.            
SO THAT THAT IS A UNIQUE        

00:24:19.111 --> 00:24:25.382
ENERGIES FROM SOLAR.            
SO THAT THAT IS A UNIQUE        
REQUIREMENT OF THIS USE         

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.064
                       .        
SO AGAIN, THE BOTTOM IMAGE HERE 
IS WHAT WAS KIND OF ORIGINALLY  

00:24:41.066 --> 00:24:41.798
SO AGAIN, THE BOTTOM IMAGE HERE 
IS WHAT WAS KIND OF ORIGINALLY  
PROPOSED AND ABLE TO GET UP TO  

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.332
IS WHAT WAS KIND OF ORIGINALLY  
PROPOSED AND ABLE TO GET UP TO  
THAT 10 PERCENT.                

00:24:42.334 --> 00:24:43.000
PROPOSED AND ABLE TO GET UP TO  
THAT 10 PERCENT.                
BUT THROUGH THE STUDY THAT WE   

00:24:43.002 --> 00:24:43.800
THAT 10 PERCENT.                
BUT THROUGH THE STUDY THAT WE   
COMMISSIONED, THE RESULTS ARE I 

00:24:43.802 --> 00:24:44.468
BUT THROUGH THE STUDY THAT WE   
COMMISSIONED, THE RESULTS ARE I 
BELIEVE THE FULL STUDY IS IN    

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.868
COMMISSIONED, THE RESULTS ARE I 
BELIEVE THE FULL STUDY IS IN    
YOUR PACKET.                    

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.736
BELIEVE THE FULL STUDY IS IN    
YOUR PACKET.                    
THE REST OF THAT FLAT ROOF, AS  

00:24:45.738 --> 00:24:46.370
YOUR PACKET.                    
THE REST OF THAT FLAT ROOF, AS  
I SAID, WOULD NOT SUPPORT THOSE 

00:24:46.372 --> 00:24:46.837
THE REST OF THAT FLAT ROOF, AS  
I SAID, WOULD NOT SUPPORT THOSE 
SOLAR PANELS.                   

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:47.571
I SAID, WOULD NOT SUPPORT THOSE 
SOLAR PANELS.                   
SO THAT IS WHY THERE BEFORE YOU 

00:24:47.573 --> 00:24:48.371
SOLAR PANELS.                   
SO THAT IS WHY THERE BEFORE YOU 
HERE TONIGHT IS WHAT THEY CAN   

00:24:48.373 --> 00:24:49.039
SO THAT IS WHY THERE BEFORE YOU 
HERE TONIGHT IS WHAT THEY CAN   
GENERATE FROM THE SOLAR ON THE  

00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:49.773
HERE TONIGHT IS WHAT THEY CAN   
GENERATE FROM THE SOLAR ON THE  
FRONT PART OF THAT BUILDING.    

00:24:49.775 --> 00:24:50.507
GENERATE FROM THE SOLAR ON THE  
FRONT PART OF THAT BUILDING.    
DO YOU SEE AGAIN IN THE TOP     

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:51.241
FRONT PART OF THAT BUILDING.    
DO YOU SEE AGAIN IN THE TOP     
IMAGE THERE OF THE SOLAR PANELS 

00:24:51.243 --> 00:24:51.975
DO YOU SEE AGAIN IN THE TOP     
IMAGE THERE OF THE SOLAR PANELS 
ALSO ON THIS SCREEN RIGHT HERE  

00:24:51.977 --> 00:24:52.643
IMAGE THERE OF THE SOLAR PANELS 
ALSO ON THIS SCREEN RIGHT HERE  
THAT RECTANGLE TO THE KIND      

00:24:52.645 --> 00:24:53.377
ALSO ON THIS SCREEN RIGHT HERE  
THAT RECTANGLE TO THE KIND      
OF TO THE BE ON THE BOTTOM      

00:24:53.379 --> 00:24:54.111
THAT RECTANGLE TO THE KIND      
OF TO THE BE ON THE BOTTOM      
OF THE BUILDING AS WELL AS ON   

00:24:54.113 --> 00:24:54.511
OF TO THE BE ON THE BOTTOM      
OF THE BUILDING AS WELL AS ON   
THE IMAGE.                      

00:24:54.513 --> 00:24:55.312
OF THE BUILDING AS WELL AS ON   
THE IMAGE.                      
SO THAT&amp;apos;S THE AREA THAT WILL BE 

00:24:55.314 --> 00:24:56.046
THE IMAGE.                      
SO THAT&amp;apos;S THE AREA THAT WILL BE 
FILLED WITH SOLAR PANELS AND    

00:24:56.048 --> 00:24:56.647
SO THAT&amp;apos;S THE AREA THAT WILL BE 
FILLED WITH SOLAR PANELS AND    
WILL GENERATE ABOUT FOUR        

00:24:56.649 --> 00:24:57.447
FILLED WITH SOLAR PANELS AND    
WILL GENERATE ABOUT FOUR        
PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL ENERGY   

00:24:57.449 --> 00:24:57.714
WILL GENERATE ABOUT FOUR        
PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL ENERGY   
USE.                            

00:24:57.716 --> 00:24:59.182
PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL ENERGY   
USE.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.            
SO WHAT IS SACRED ABOUT THE TEN 
PERCENT AND I GUESS THE GENERAL 

00:25:35.888 --> 00:25:36.853
SO WHAT IS SACRED ABOUT THE TEN 
PERCENT AND I GUESS THE GENERAL 
QUESTION WHY WAS THE TEN        

00:25:36.855 --> 00:25:37.688
PERCENT AND I GUESS THE GENERAL 
QUESTION WHY WAS THE TEN        
PERCENT PUT IN AND ALSO LIKE TO 

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.424
QUESTION WHY WAS THE TEN        
PERCENT PUT IN AND ALSO LIKE TO 
KNOW THE DATE THAT THE          

00:25:40.426 --> 00:25:41.091
PERCENT PUT IN AND ALSO LIKE TO 
KNOW THE DATE THAT THE          
ORDINANCE FIRST BECAME          

00:25:41.093 --> 00:25:47.130
KNOW THE DATE THAT THE          
ORDINANCE FIRST BECAME          
EFFECTIVE WITH A DATE I&amp;apos;D HAVE  

00:25:47.132 --> 00:25:48.065
ORDINANCE FIRST BECAME          
EFFECTIVE WITH A DATE I&amp;apos;D HAVE  
I WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH THE     

00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:50.934
EFFECTIVE WITH A DATE I&amp;apos;D HAVE  
I WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH THE     
ORIGINAL DRAFTING OF THE        

00:25:50.936 --> 00:25:51.768
I WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH THE     
ORIGINAL DRAFTING OF THE        
CODE SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SPEAK           

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:52.402
ORIGINAL DRAFTING OF THE        
CODE SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SPEAK           
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT TEN        

00:25:52.404 --> 00:25:55.773
CODE SO I CAN&amp;apos;T SPEAK           
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT TEN        
PERCENT NUMBER AND WHY THAT     

00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:56.573
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT TEN        
PERCENT NUMBER AND WHY THAT     
NUMBER BUT I KNOW IS WHEN WE    

00:25:56.575 --> 00:25:59.442
PERCENT NUMBER AND WHY THAT     
NUMBER BUT I KNOW IS WHEN WE    
INITIALLY DRAFTED CODES DEALING 

00:25:59.444 --> 00:26:00.110
NUMBER BUT I KNOW IS WHEN WE    
INITIALLY DRAFTED CODES DEALING 
WITH MARIJUANA TYPE BUSINESSES  

00:26:00.112 --> 00:26:03.046
INITIALLY DRAFTED CODES DEALING 
WITH MARIJUANA TYPE BUSINESSES  
WAS ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS    

00:26:03.048 --> 00:26:04.281
WITH MARIJUANA TYPE BUSINESSES  
WAS ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS    
AGO OR SO IT WAS LOOKED AT LIKE 

00:26:04.283 --> 00:26:05.014
WAS ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS    
AGO OR SO IT WAS LOOKED AT LIKE 
SOME TYPES OF BUSINESSES WOULD  

00:26:05.016 --> 00:26:07.584
AGO OR SO IT WAS LOOKED AT LIKE 
SOME TYPES OF BUSINESSES WOULD  
REQUIRE MORE ENERGY, GROW       

00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:08.285
SOME TYPES OF BUSINESSES WOULD  
REQUIRE MORE ENERGY, GROW       
BUSINESSES, THINGS LIKE THAT.   

00:26:08.287 --> 00:26:11.955
REQUIRE MORE ENERGY, GROW       
BUSINESSES, THINGS LIKE THAT.   
SO AS A RESULT THIS IS KIND     

00:26:11.957 --> 00:26:12.623
BUSINESSES, THINGS LIKE THAT.   
SO AS A RESULT THIS IS KIND     
OF A MICRO BUSINESS WHICH MEANS 

00:26:12.625 --> 00:26:15.158
SO AS A RESULT THIS IS KIND     
OF A MICRO BUSINESS WHICH MEANS 
THEY CAN GROW PROCESS RETAIL    

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.059
OF A MICRO BUSINESS WHICH MEANS 
THEY CAN GROW PROCESS RETAIL    
ALL AT THE SAME LOCATION THAT   

00:26:16.061 --> 00:26:18.328
THEY CAN GROW PROCESS RETAIL    
ALL AT THE SAME LOCATION THAT   
THEY BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S A SPECIAL     

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.129
ALL AT THE SAME LOCATION THAT   
THEY BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S A SPECIAL     
EXCEPTION USE THEY CAN DO A     

00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:22.132
THEY BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S A SPECIAL     
EXCEPTION USE THEY CAN DO A     
LITTLE BIT MORE TO              

00:26:22.134 --> 00:26:22.933
EXCEPTION USE THEY CAN DO A     
LITTLE BIT MORE TO              
SUSTAINABILITY PURPOSES BECAUSE 

00:26:22.935 --> 00:26:26.036
LITTLE BIT MORE TO              
SUSTAINABILITY PURPOSES BECAUSE 
THEY&amp;apos;RE TYPICALLY LARGER ENERGY 

00:26:26.038 --> 00:26:26.970
SUSTAINABILITY PURPOSES BECAUSE 
THEY&amp;apos;RE TYPICALLY LARGER ENERGY 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS AGAIN A        

00:26:26.972 --> 00:26:27.638
THEY&amp;apos;RE TYPICALLY LARGER ENERGY 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS AGAIN A

ALTHOUGH THIS IS AGAIN A        
SMALLER TYPE OF BUSINESS.       
I THINK WHAT THE CODE MAY HAVE  

00:26:30.042 --> 00:26:31.107
SMALLER TYPE OF BUSINESS.       
I THINK WHAT THE CODE MAY HAVE  
ENVISIONED IS A LITTLE BIT      

00:26:31.109 --> 00:26:31.775
I THINK WHAT THE CODE MAY HAVE  
ENVISIONED IS A LITTLE BIT      
LARGER OF A WAREHOUSE TYPE      

00:26:31.777 --> 00:26:34.344
ENVISIONED IS A LITTLE BIT      
LARGER OF A WAREHOUSE TYPE      
FACILITY.                       

00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:35.345
LARGER OF A WAREHOUSE TYPE      
FACILITY.

BECAUSE YOU DON&amp;apos;T HAVE THE

WHILE WE WORK OUT THE SOLAR     

00:36:12.791 --> 00:36:13.122
APPROVAL WHILE WE WHILE WE      
WHILE WE WORK OUT THE SOLAR     
PANEL.                          

00:36:13.124 --> 00:36:13.656
WHILE WE WORK OUT THE SOLAR     
PANEL.                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT&amp;apos;S CORRECT.              

00:36:13.658 --> 00:36:14.124
PANEL.                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT&amp;apos;S CORRECT.              
I CAN VERIFY.                   

00:36:14.126 --> 00:36:14.324
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT&amp;apos;S CORRECT.              
I CAN VERIFY.                   
RIGHT.                          

00:36:14.326 --> 00:36:16.292
I CAN VERIFY.                   
RIGHT.                          
SO THEY&amp;apos;RE IN ZONING COMPLIANCE 

00:36:16.294 --> 00:36:16.493
RIGHT.                          
SO THEY&amp;apos;RE IN ZONING COMPLIANCE 
.                               

00:36:16.495 --> 00:36:17.494
SO THEY&amp;apos;RE IN ZONING COMPLIANCE 
.                               
SO AGAIN IT&amp;apos;LL BE IF VARIANCE   

00:36:17.496 --> 00:36:21.230
.                               
SO AGAIN IT&amp;apos;LL BE IF VARIANCE   
IS NOT GRANTED AND WE WON&amp;apos;T BE  

00:36:21.232 --> 00:36:22.031
SO AGAIN IT&amp;apos;LL BE IF VARIANCE   
IS NOT GRANTED AND WE WON&amp;apos;T BE  
ABLE TO CERTIFY THEIR NEXT ONE  

00:36:22.033 --> 00:36:23.432
IS NOT GRANTED AND WE WON&amp;apos;T BE  
ABLE TO CERTIFY THEIR NEXT ONE

ABLE TO CERTIFY THEIR NEXT ONE  
IN COMPLIANCE.                  
SO THEN THEY WOULD NOT BE IN    

00:36:24.502 --> 00:36:25.068
IN COMPLIANCE.                  
SO THEN THEY WOULD NOT BE IN    
CONFIRMATION FOR ZONING.        

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:25.669
SO THEN THEY WOULD NOT BE IN    
CONFIRMATION FOR ZONING.        
BUT RIGHT NOW AGAIN WHILE       

00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:27.870

THEY&amp;apos;VE BEEN ALLOWED TO         
CONTINUE OPERATING.             
SO IF YOU DON&amp;apos;T GET THE         

00:36:32.243 --> 00:36:35.678
CONTINUE OPERATING.             
SO IF YOU DON&amp;apos;T GET THE         
VARIANCE, HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE   

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.915
SO IF YOU DON&amp;apos;T GET THE

THEY&amp;apos;RE THEY&amp;apos;RE MUCH MUCH LESS  
EFFICIENT AND THEY HAD TO BE    
SPACED OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO 

00:41:37.382 --> 00:41:38.114
EFFICIENT AND THEY HAD TO BE    
SPACED OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO 
AND THEY REQUIRE EXTRA EXTRA    

00:41:38.116 --> 00:41:41.084
SPACED OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO 
AND THEY REQUIRE EXTRA EXTRA    
WEIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY     

00:41:41.086 --> 00:41:41.718
AND THEY REQUIRE EXTRA EXTRA    
WEIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY     
HAVE TO BE ANGLED UP.           

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.987
WEIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY     
HAVE TO BE ANGLED UP.           
I&amp;apos;M NOT A SOLAR EXPERT BUT WHEN 

00:41:44.989 --> 00:41:50.660
HAVE TO BE ANGLED UP.           
I&amp;apos;M NOT A SOLAR EXPERT BUT WHEN 
WHEN ENGINEER REVIEWED THE ROOF 

00:41:50.662 --> 00:41:51.394
I&amp;apos;M NOT A SOLAR EXPERT BUT WHEN 
WHEN ENGINEER REVIEWED THE ROOF 
OF THOSE INSTALLATION, ONE      

00:41:51.396 --> 00:41:52.161
WHEN ENGINEER REVIEWED THE ROOF 
OF THOSE INSTALLATION, ONE      
OF THE THOSE INSTALLATIONS THE  

00:41:52.163 --> 00:41:55.465
OF THOSE INSTALLATION, ONE      
OF THE THOSE INSTALLATIONS THE  
ROOF WASN&amp;apos;T ABLE TO HOLD THAT   

00:41:55.467 --> 00:41:59.135
OF THE THOSE INSTALLATIONS THE  
ROOF WASN&amp;apos;T ABLE TO HOLD THAT   
WEIGHT AND THAT&amp;apos;S WHEN IN 2016  

00:41:59.137 --> 00:42:02.638
ROOF WASN&amp;apos;T ABLE TO HOLD THAT   
WEIGHT AND THAT&amp;apos;S WHEN IN 2016  
WHEN WE TOOK WHEN WE STARTED UP 

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.372
WEIGHT AND THAT&amp;apos;S WHEN IN 2016  
WHEN WE TOOK WHEN WE STARTED UP 
WITH THE BUILDING WE HAD TO     

00:42:03.374 --> 00:42:04.106
WHEN WE TOOK WHEN WE STARTED UP 
WITH THE BUILDING WE HAD TO     
REINFORCE THE ROOF JUST TO      

00:42:04.108 --> 00:42:05.874
WITH THE BUILDING WE HAD TO     
REINFORCE THE ROOF JUST TO      
SUPPORT THOSE AIR CONDITIONERS  

00:42:05.876 --> 00:42:06.108
REINFORCE THE ROOF JUST TO      
SUPPORT THOSE AIR CONDITIONERS  
.                               

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.176
SUPPORT THOSE AIR CONDITIONERS  
.                               
AND SO IT WAS IT&amp;apos;S JUST BARELY  

00:42:07.178 --> 00:42:10.179
.                               
AND SO IT WAS IT&amp;apos;S JUST BARELY  
YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S NOT SAFE BUT     

00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:10.880
AND SO IT WAS IT&amp;apos;S JUST BARELY  
YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S NOT SAFE BUT     
IT&amp;apos;S NOT ABLE TO HANDLE THE     

00:42:10.882 --> 00:42:14.283
YOU KNOW, IT&amp;apos;S NOT SAFE BUT     
IT&amp;apos;S NOT ABLE TO HANDLE THE     
ADDITIONAL WEIGHT OF THOSE THE  

00:42:14.285 --> 00:42:15.050
IT&amp;apos;S NOT ABLE TO HANDLE THE     
ADDITIONAL WEIGHT OF THOSE THE  
THE STRUCTURE AND AND THE       

00:42:15.052 --> 00:42:15.551
ADDITIONAL WEIGHT OF THOSE THE

THE STRUCTURE AND AND THE       
PANELS THEMSELVES.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THOUGHT THERE IS AN        

00:42:18.356 --> 00:42:19.021
PANELS THEMSELVES.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THOUGHT THERE IS AN        
ADDITIONAL STUDY THOUGH         

00:42:19.023 --> 00:42:19.755
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THOUGHT THERE IS AN        
ADDITIONAL STUDY THOUGH         
ELSEWHERE ON THE SITE LIKE AT   

00:42:19.757 --> 00:42:21.824
ADDITIONAL STUDY THOUGH         
ELSEWHERE ON THE SITE LIKE AT   
GRADE THAT COULD ALSO BE A      

00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:22.391
ELSEWHERE ON THE SITE LIKE AT   
GRADE THAT COULD ALSO BE A      
COVER FOR PARKING.              

00:42:22.393 --> 00:42:25.394
GRADE THAT COULD ALSO BE A      
COVER FOR PARKING.              
I THOUGHT I READ THAT BUT MAYBE 

00:42:25.396 --> 00:42:26.361
COVER FOR PARKING.              
I THOUGHT I READ THAT BUT MAYBE 
NOT MAYBE I HAVE A POOR MEMORY  

00:42:26.363 --> 00:42:29.866
I THOUGHT I READ THAT BUT MAYBE

00:42:29.868 --> 00:42:30.500
NOT MAYBE I HAVE A POOR MEMORY  
BUT NOWHERE ELSE ON THE SITE    
COULD SOLAR PANELS WORK         

00:42:30.502 --> 00:42:33.236
BUT NOWHERE ELSE ON THE SITE    
COULD SOLAR PANELS WORK         
ESSENTIALLY, RIGHT?             

00:42:33.238 --> 00:42:34.436
COULD SOLAR PANELS WORK         
ESSENTIALLY, RIGHT?             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, I DIDN&amp;apos;T SEE THAT.     

00:42:34.438 --> 00:42:37.640
ESSENTIALLY, RIGHT?             
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, I DIDN&amp;apos;T SEE THAT.     
I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW MAYBE I MISSED

JUST ADD TO THAT I THINK WHICH  
MAY HELP CLARIFY THE SO SOLAR   
GROUND BASED SOLAR STRUCTURES   

00:42:52.657 --> 00:42:53.389
MAY HELP CLARIFY THE SO SOLAR   
GROUND BASED SOLAR STRUCTURES   
ARE CONSIDERED ACCESSORY        

00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:55.591
GROUND BASED SOLAR STRUCTURES   
ARE CONSIDERED ACCESSORY

TO INVEST THIS MUCH MONEY IN    
THE STRUCTURE?                  
MAYBE THIS IS A DUMB QUESTION.  

00:43:38.302 --> 00:43:39.168
THE STRUCTURE?                  
MAYBE THIS IS A DUMB QUESTION.  
I&amp;apos;M REALLY PUZZLED BY THAT LIKE 

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.501
MAYBE THIS IS A DUMB QUESTION.  
I&amp;apos;M REALLY PUZZLED BY THAT LIKE

WHAT IS THE NEGOTIATION WITH    
YOUR LANDLORD TO INSTALL ALL    

00:43:42.573 --> 00:43:45.508
WHAT IS THE NEGOTIATION WITH    
YOUR LANDLORD TO INSTALL ALL    
THESE SOLAR PANELS AND I GUESS  

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:48.077
YOUR LANDLORD TO INSTALL ALL    
THESE SOLAR PANELS AND I GUESS  
I&amp;apos;M CURIOUS LIKE YOU ARE        

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:49.244
THESE SOLAR PANELS AND I GUESS  
I&amp;apos;M CURIOUS LIKE YOU ARE        
RENTING A LOT OF MONEY TO PUT   

00:43:49.246 --> 00:43:49.946

RENTING A LOT OF MONEY TO PUT   
ALL THESE SOLAR PANELS ON.      

00:43:49.948 --> 00:43:52.682
RENTING A LOT OF MONEY TO PUT   
ALL THESE SOLAR PANELS ON.      
HOW DOES THAT WORK WELL AND     

00:43:52.684 --> 00:43:53.282
ALL THESE SOLAR PANELS ON.      
HOW DOES THAT WORK WELL AND     
RENTAL AGREEMENT?               

00:43:53.284 --> 00:43:54.017
HOW DOES THAT WORK WELL AND     
RENTAL AGREEMENT?               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, YEAH, MY RENTAL        

00:43:54.019 --> 00:43:56.886
RENTAL AGREEMENT?               
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, YEAH, MY RENTAL        
AGREEMENT ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT  

00:43:56.888 --> 00:44:00.289
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELL, YEAH, MY RENTAL        
AGREEMENT ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT  
IN THE BUILDING EVEN IF         

00:44:00.291 --> 00:44:00.990
AGREEMENT ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT  
IN THE BUILDING EVEN IF         
PERMANENT INSTALLATION I WILL   

00:44:00.992 --> 00:44:04.293
IN THE BUILDING EVEN IF         
PERMANENT INSTALLATION I WILL   
RETAIN WHEN THE LEASE IS OVER.  

00:44:04.295 --> 00:44:04.927
PERMANENT INSTALLATION I WILL   
RETAIN WHEN THE LEASE IS OVER.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OH OK.                       

00:44:04.929 --> 00:44:05.928
RETAIN WHEN THE LEASE IS OVER.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OH OK.                       
SO THE IDEA IS THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE      

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:06.595
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OH OK.                       
SO THE IDEA IS THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE      
INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS BUT YOU 

00:44:06.597 --> 00:44:07.964
SO THE IDEA IS THAT YOU&amp;apos;RE      
INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS BUT YOU 
COULD JUST LIKE TAKE THEM AWAY  

00:44:07.966 --> 00:44:08.498
INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS BUT YOU 
COULD JUST LIKE TAKE THEM AWAY  
AND THEY&amp;apos;RE YOURS.              

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.767
COULD JUST LIKE TAKE THEM AWAY  
AND THEY&amp;apos;RE YOURS.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY&amp;apos;RE YOURS IF YOU DIDN&amp;apos;T  

00:44:11.769 --> 00:44:12.501
AND THEY&amp;apos;RE YOURS.              
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY&amp;apos;RE YOURS IF YOU DIDN&amp;apos;T  
RENEW YOUR LEASE LIKE THOSE     

00:44:12.503 --> 00:44:15.171
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY&amp;apos;RE YOURS IF YOU DIDN&amp;apos;T  
RENEW YOUR LEASE LIKE THOSE     
SOLAR PANELS ARE YOURS TO JUST  

00:44:15.173 --> 00:44:16.305
RENEW YOUR LEASE LIKE THOSE     
SOLAR PANELS ARE YOURS TO JUST  
TAKE OFF AND THEN I SUPPOSE     

00:44:16.307 --> 00:44:18.741
SOLAR PANELS ARE YOURS TO JUST  
TAKE OFF AND THEN I SUPPOSE     
THAT WOULD BE THE THE           

00:44:18.743 --> 00:44:19.676
TAKE OFF AND THEN I SUPPOSE     
THAT WOULD BE THE THE           
PRESUMABLY YOU DO NOT WANT TO   

00:44:19.678 --> 00:44:20.075
THAT WOULD BE THE THE           
PRESUMABLY YOU DO NOT WANT TO   
DO THAT.                        

00:44:20.077 --> 00:44:20.909
PRESUMABLY YOU DO NOT WANT TO   
DO THAT.                        
I MEAN I&amp;apos;M SURE BECAUSE IN      

00:44:20.911 --> 00:44:23.145
DO THAT.                        
I MEAN I&amp;apos;M SURE BECAUSE IN      
ORDER TO IN ORDER FOR THIS FOR  

00:44:23.147 --> 00:44:23.879
I MEAN I&amp;apos;M SURE BECAUSE IN      
ORDER TO IN ORDER FOR THIS FOR  
THE BUILDING TO OPERATE AS A    

00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:26.883
ORDER TO IN ORDER FOR THIS FOR  
THE BUILDING TO OPERATE AS A    
MICRO BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE    

00:44:26.885 --> 00:44:27.649
THE BUILDING TO OPERATE AS A    
MICRO BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE    
THAT WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT.    

00:44:27.651 --> 00:44:28.350
MICRO BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE    
THAT WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT.    
SO I MEAN TECHNICALLY THAT      

00:44:28.352 --> 00:44:30.720
THAT WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT.    
SO I MEAN TECHNICALLY THAT      
WOULD BE THE CASE.              

00:44:30.722 --> 00:44:31.788
SO I MEAN TECHNICALLY THAT

EXISTING GARAGE IS OUTLINED     
HERE.                           
IT DOES CONFORM TO THE HEIGHT.

LOOKING DIRECTLY OBVIOUSLY AT   
THIS OBJECT STRUCTURE, THE THE  

01:12:24.326 --> 01:12:25.092
LOOKING DIRECTLY OBVIOUSLY AT   
THIS OBJECT STRUCTURE, THE THE  
DOORWAY TO THE LEFT THAT

KIND OF THE NEWER AREA.         

01:12:29.165 --> 01:12:31.932
ADDITIONAL AREA FROM HERE IS    
KIND OF THE NEWER AREA.         
THE ADDITIONAL ABOUT FOUR FEET  

01:12:31.934 --> 01:12:32.900
KIND OF THE NEWER AREA.         
THE ADDITIONAL ABOUT FOUR FEET  
OR SO I&amp;apos;D SAY SOME PICTURES     

01:12:32.902 --> 01:12:35.102
THE ADDITIONAL ABOUT FOUR FEET  
OR SO I&amp;apos;D SAY SOME PICTURES

OR SO I&amp;apos;D SAY SOME PICTURES     
OF A SUBJECT SITE.              
SO AGAIN THIS EXPANSION WOULD   

01:12:35.938 --> 01:12:38.873
OF A SUBJECT SITE.              
SO AGAIN THIS EXPANSION WOULD   
BE TO THE LEFT.                 

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:40.140
SO AGAIN THIS EXPANSION WOULD   
BE TO THE LEFT.                 
SO HERE IS THE LOOKING AT THE   

01:12:40.142 --> 01:12:43.144
BE TO THE LEFT.                 
SO HERE IS THE LOOKING AT THE   
REAR OF THE GARAGE KIND OF THIS 

01:12:43.146 --> 01:12:43.944
SO HERE IS THE LOOKING AT THE   
REAR OF THE GARAGE KIND OF THIS 
IS THEIR SIDE PROPERTY LINE.    

01:12:43.946 --> 01:12:47.048
REAR OF THE GARAGE KIND OF THIS 
IS THEIR SIDE PROPERTY LINE.    
SO THIS AREA HERE OF THE        

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:47.681
IS THEIR SIDE PROPERTY LINE.    
SO THIS AREA HERE OF THE        
EXPANSION WOULD KIND            

01:12:47.683 --> 01:12:49.984
SO THIS AREA HERE OF THE        
EXPANSION WOULD KIND            
OF CONTINUE THIS ONE I THINK IS 

01:12:49.986 --> 01:12:50.918
EXPANSION WOULD KIND            
OF CONTINUE THIS ONE I THINK IS 
TWO POINT EIGHT FEET ON THIS    

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.252
OF CONTINUE THIS ONE I THINK IS 
TWO POINT EIGHT FEET ON THIS    
THIS SIDE.                      

01:12:51.254 --> 01:12:53.788
TWO POINT EIGHT FEET ON THIS    
THIS SIDE.                      
SO IT WOULD CONTINUE OUT IN     

01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:54.522
THIS SIDE.                      
SO IT WOULD CONTINUE OUT IN     
THIS DIRECTION AGAIN GOING      

01:12:54.524 --> 01:12:58.025
SO IT WOULD CONTINUE OUT IN     
THIS DIRECTION AGAIN GOING      
TOWARDS THE HOUSE.              

01:12:58.027 --> 01:12:58.859
THIS DIRECTION AGAIN GOING      
TOWARDS THE HOUSE.              
SO THE ADDITION IS NOT          

01:12:58.861 --> 01:13:01.929
TOWARDS THE HOUSE.              
SO THE ADDITION IS NOT          
INCREASING THE NONCONFORMING    

01:13:01.931 --> 01:13:05.766
SO THE ADDITION IS NOT          
INCREASING THE NONCONFORMING    
THIS IS LOOKING DIRECTLY FROM

REAR.                           
SO AGAIN NOT GOING IT WOULD NOT 
ENCROACH ANY CLOSER TO THE LEFT 

01:13:12.942 --> 01:13:13.874
SO AGAIN NOT GOING IT WOULD NOT 
ENCROACH ANY CLOSER TO THE LEFT
