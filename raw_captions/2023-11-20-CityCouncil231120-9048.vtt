CONSIDER DOING IT THE SAME      
TONIGHT TO CLARIFY WHAT THE     

01:26:33.808 --> 01:26:37.276
CONSIDER DOING IT THE SAME      
TONIGHT TO CLARIFY WHAT THE     
ORDINANCE IS IS THAT GAS LEAF   

01:26:37.278 --> 01:26:38.144
TONIGHT TO CLARIFY WHAT THE     
ORDINANCE IS IS THAT GAS LEAF   
BLOWERS WOULD BE BANNED IN THE  

01:26:38.146 --> 01:26:40.414
ORDINANCE IS IS THAT GAS LEAF   
BLOWERS WOULD BE BANNED IN THE  
CITY IN A PHASED IN APPROACH.   

01:26:40.416 --> 01:26:41.347
BLOWERS WOULD BE BANNED IN THE  
CITY IN A PHASED IN APPROACH.   
THIS WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE BAN  

01:26:41.349 --> 01:26:44.584
CITY IN A PHASED IN APPROACH.   
THIS WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE BAN  
DURING OFF SEASON WHILE GAS     

01:26:44.586 --> 01:26:45.285
THIS WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE BAN  
DURING OFF SEASON WHILE GAS     
LEAF BLOWERS WILL STILL BE      

01:26:45.287 --> 01:26:48.121
DURING OFF SEASON WHILE GAS     
LEAF BLOWERS WILL STILL BE      
ALLOWED TO BE USED IN THE CITY  

01:26:48.123 --> 01:26:48.988
LEAF BLOWERS WILL STILL BE      
ALLOWED TO BE USED IN THE CITY  
FROM OCTOBER 1ST TO MAY 30TH    

01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:49.656
ALLOWED TO BE USED IN THE CITY  
FROM OCTOBER 1ST TO MAY 30TH    
THROUGH THE YEAR OF TWENTY      

01:26:49.658 --> 01:26:52.291
FROM OCTOBER 1ST TO MAY 30TH    
THROUGH THE YEAR OF TWENTY      
TWENTY SEVEN.                   

01:26:52.293 --> 01:26:53.459
THROUGH THE YEAR OF TWENTY      
TWENTY SEVEN.                   
AND THE IDEA FOR THIS WAS NOT   

01:26:53.461 --> 01:26:55.194
TWENTY SEVEN.                   
AND THE IDEA FOR THIS WAS NOT   
TO CREATE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP    

01:26:55.196 --> 01:26:55.895
AND THE IDEA FOR THIS WAS NOT   
TO CREATE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP    
FOR HOMEOWNERS OR FOR           

01:26:55.897 --> 01:26:56.396
TO CREATE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP    
FOR HOMEOWNERS OR FOR           
COMMERCIAL OPERATORS.           

01:26:56.398 --> 01:27:00.033
FOR HOMEOWNERS OR FOR           
COMMERCIAL OPERATORS.           
SO THE IDEA IS THAT ESPECIALLY  

01:27:00.035 --> 01:27:03.103
COMMERCIAL OPERATORS.           
SO THE IDEA IS THAT ESPECIALLY  
THOSE COMMERCIAL OPERATORS      

01:27:03.105 --> 01:27:03.904
SO THE IDEA IS THAT ESPECIALLY  
THOSE COMMERCIAL OPERATORS      
MONOPOD BUSINESSES THAT THEY    

01:27:03.906 --> 01:27:04.804
THOSE COMMERCIAL OPERATORS      
MONOPOD BUSINESSES THAT THEY    
WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO USE      

01:27:04.806 --> 01:27:07.808
MONOPOD BUSINESSES THAT THEY    
WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO USE      
THEIR LEAF BLOWERS GAS DURING   

01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:08.475
WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO USE      
THEIR LEAF BLOWERS GAS DURING   
THE BUSY SEASON AND THEN        

01:27:08.477 --> 01:27:11.278
THEIR LEAF BLOWERS GAS DURING   
THE BUSY SEASON AND THEN        
AMORTIZE THE EQUIPMENT OVER     

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.078
THE BUSY SEASON AND THEN        
AMORTIZE THE EQUIPMENT OVER     
TIME WHILE INTEGRATING ELECTRIC 

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.081
AMORTIZE THE EQUIPMENT OVER     
TIME WHILE INTEGRATING ELECTRIC 
INTO THEIR OPERATIONS.          

01:27:15.083 --> 01:27:19.519
TIME WHILE INTEGRATING ELECTRIC 
INTO THEIR OPERATIONS.          
I THINK WE&apos;RE WHEN WE CONSIDER  

01:27:19.521 --> 01:27:20.319
INTO THEIR OPERATIONS.          
I THINK WE&apos;RE WHEN WE CONSIDER
