00:23:17.516 --> 00:23:18.382
BE MORE.                        
NOW TO BE FAIR, ANN ARBOR HAS   
DONE SOME GOOD THINGS THE RATE  

00:23:18.384 --> 00:23:20.584
NOW TO BE FAIR, ANN ARBOR HAS   
DONE SOME GOOD THINGS THE RATE  
OF SEVERE PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE   

00:23:20.586 --> 00:23:21.384
DONE SOME GOOD THINGS THE RATE  
OF SEVERE PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE   
CRASHES HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY  

00:23:21.386 --> 00:23:24.521
OF SEVERE PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE   
CRASHES HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY  
ACROSS THE US WHILE IN THE CITY 

00:23:24.523 --> 00:23:25.322

ACROSS THE US WHILE IN THE CITY 
IT'S REALLY REMAINED BASICALLY  

00:23:25.324 --> 00:23:27.624
ACROSS THE US WHILE IN THE CITY 
IT'S REALLY REMAINED BASICALLY  
FLAT THAT SORT OF POSITIVE SIGN 

00:23:27.626 --> 00:23:28.359
IT'S REALLY REMAINED BASICALLY  
FLAT THAT SORT OF POSITIVE SIGN 
WE'RE DOING LESS BADLY THAN     

00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:31.261
FLAT THAT SORT OF POSITIVE SIGN 
WE'RE DOING LESS BADLY THAN     
MOST BUT ALSO NOT ENOUGH NOT    

00:23:31.263 --> 00:23:31.695
WE'RE DOING LESS BADLY THAN

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.664
THE GROUND IMPROVEMENTS TO      
ACTUALLY SHOW FOR IT.           
NOW YES, WE NEED TO DO PLANNING
