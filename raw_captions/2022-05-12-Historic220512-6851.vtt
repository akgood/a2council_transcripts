00:25:39.177 --> 00:25:39.910
FROM THE DRIVEWAY SIDE WHICH IS 
ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE VISIBLE  
COMING DOWN JEFFERSON I THINK   

00:25:39.912 --> 00:25:43.313
ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE VISIBLE  
COMING DOWN JEFFERSON I THINK   
HAVING THE LITTLE NOTCH IN THE  

00:25:43.315 --> 00:25:44.247
COMING DOWN JEFFERSON I THINK   
HAVING THE LITTLE NOTCH IN THE  
BACK WHERE THE CLOSET IS ON THE 

00:25:44.249 --> 00:25:45.982
HAVING THE LITTLE NOTCH IN THE  
BACK WHERE THE CLOSET IS ON THE 
INSIDE REALLY HELPS DISTINGUISH 

00:25:45.984 --> 00:25:46.916
BACK WHERE THE CLOSET IS ON THE 
INSIDE REALLY HELPS DISTINGUISH 
THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT       

00:25:46.918 --> 00:25:50.386
INSIDE REALLY HELPS DISTINGUISH 
THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT       
DIFFERENT FROM FROM THE REST    

00:25:50.388 --> 00:25:50.754
THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT       
DIFFERENT FROM FROM THE REST    
OF THE HOUSE.                   

00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:51.888
DIFFERENT FROM FROM THE REST    
OF THE HOUSE.                   
UM, THE MAIN POINT THAT THE     

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.558
OF THE HOUSE.                   
UM, THE MAIN POINT THAT THE     
ARCHITECT WANTED TO MAKE WAS    

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.359
UM, THE MAIN POINT THAT THE     
ARCHITECT WANTED TO MAKE WAS    
THAT IT&amp;apos;S COMPATIBLE BUT THAT   

00:25:55.361 --> 00:25:58.261
ARCHITECT WANTED TO MAKE WAS    
THAT IT&amp;apos;S COMPATIBLE BUT THAT   
YOU CAN STILL START TO          

00:25:58.263 --> 00:25:58.662

DISTINGUISH.

YOU CAN STILL START TO          
DISTINGUISH.                    
SO I THINK MAKING THOSE CHANGES 

00:25:59.465 --> 00:26:02.098
DISTINGUISH.                    
SO I THINK MAKING THOSE CHANGES

THE STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES    

00:43:16.467 --> 00:43:17.467

00:45:37.075 --> 00:45:37.707
DRIVEWAY A LITTLE BIT MORE?     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK IT&amp;apos;S INTERESTING     
BECAUSE THERE&amp;apos;S A FENCE THAT    

00:45:37.709 --> 00:45:39.908

BECAUSE THERE&amp;apos;S A FENCE THAT    
GOES BETWEEN HIS HOUSE AND THE  

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:40.643

SUBSEQUENTLY TO THAT WE HAD     
SOME ARBORIST COME OUT OVER AND

00:49:19.763 --> 00:49:23.799
WE SPOKE TO ALSO WASN&amp;apos;T THAT    
CONCERNED ABOUT THE TREES DYING 
BUT AND AND THEN WE ALSO WERE   

00:49:23.801 --> 00:49:27.569
CONCERNED ABOUT THE TREES DYING 
BUT AND AND THEN WE ALSO WERE   
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A        

00:49:27.571 --> 00:49:28.371
BUT AND AND THEN WE ALSO WERE   
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A        
SOLUTION SO THAT WE COULD STILL 

00:49:28.373 --> 00:49:31.706
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A        
SOLUTION SO THAT WE COULD STILL 
PROCEED AND WE WERE THINKING    

00:49:31.708 --> 00:49:34.309
SOLUTION SO THAT WE COULD STILL

PROCEED AND WE WERE THINKING    
OF DOING A CRAWL SPACE ON THE   
SIDE AND THE OR ANOTHER         

00:49:34.979 --> 00:49:38.146
OF DOING A CRAWL SPACE ON THE   
SIDE AND THE OR ANOTHER         
ARBORIST THAT THAT THAT WOULD   

00:49:38.148 --> 00:49:38.947
SIDE AND THE OR ANOTHER         
ARBORIST THAT THAT THAT WOULD   
BE SUFFICIENT TO HELP PROTECT   

00:49:38.949 --> 00:49:42.618
ARBORIST THAT THAT THAT WOULD   
BE SUFFICIENT TO HELP PROTECT   
THE TREES AND NOT DIG SO CLOSE  

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.088
BE SUFFICIENT TO HELP PROTECT   
THE TREES AND NOT DIG SO CLOSE  
TO THE TREE.                    

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:47.189
THE TREES AND NOT DIG SO CLOSE  
TO THE TREE.                    
BUT THEN AS WE ARE TALKING, YOU 

00:49:47.191 --> 00:49:47.923
TO THE TREE.                    
BUT THEN AS WE ARE TALKING, YOU 
KNOW, THAT REMOVES A            

00:49:47.925 --> 00:49:49.625
BUT THEN AS WE ARE TALKING, YOU 
KNOW, THAT REMOVES A            
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BASEMENT 

00:49:49.627 --> 00:49:53.261
KNOW, THAT REMOVES A            
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BASEMENT 
SPACE AND LIVABLE SPACE FOR US. 

00:49:53.263 --> 00:49:54.563
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BASEMENT 
SPACE AND LIVABLE SPACE FOR US. 
AND SO THE HOUSE LEFT ARE ALSO  

00:49:54.565 --> 00:49:57.399
SPACE AND LIVABLE SPACE FOR US. 
AND SO THE HOUSE LEFT ARE ALSO  
SUGGESTED AFTER WE&amp;apos;VE LIFTED    

00:49:57.401 --> 00:49:58.333
AND SO THE HOUSE LEFT ARE ALSO  
SUGGESTED AFTER WE&amp;apos;VE LIFTED    
THE HOUSE MOVING THE HOUSE FOUR 

00:49:58.335 --> 00:50:01.704
SUGGESTED AFTER WE&amp;apos;VE LIFTED    
THE HOUSE MOVING THE HOUSE FOUR 
FEET AWAY FROM THE TREES WHICH  

00:50:01.706 --> 00:50:04.773
THE HOUSE MOVING THE HOUSE FOUR 
FEET AWAY FROM THE TREES WHICH  
WOULD ALSO PRESERVE THE TREES   

00:50:04.775 --> 00:50:08.076
FEET AWAY FROM THE TREES WHICH  
WOULD ALSO PRESERVE THE TREES   
AND THEN ALLOW US TO PUT IT AND 

00:50:08.078 --> 00:50:08.677
WOULD ALSO PRESERVE THE TREES   
AND THEN ALLOW US TO PUT IT AND 
A COMPLETE BASEMENT.            

00:50:08.679 --> 00:50:09.644
AND THEN ALLOW US TO PUT IT AND 
A COMPLETE BASEMENT.            
SO WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A MORE   

00:50:09.646 --> 00:50:12.648
A COMPLETE BASEMENT.            
SO WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A MORE   
ELEGANT SOLUTION TO OUR THREE   

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:16.518
SO WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A MORE   
ELEGANT SOLUTION TO OUR THREE   
PROBLEM AND IT PRESERVED THE    

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.252
ELEGANT SOLUTION TO OUR THREE   
PROBLEM AND IT PRESERVED THE    
UTILITY AND SPACE OF THE        

00:50:17.254 --> 00:50:20.923
PROBLEM AND IT PRESERVED THE    
UTILITY AND SPACE OF THE        
BASEMENT AND IN SOME RESPECTS   

00:50:20.925 --> 00:50:24.092
UTILITY AND SPACE OF THE        
BASEMENT AND IN SOME RESPECTS   
IT PROBABLY PRESERVED THE LIFE  

00:50:24.094 --> 00:50:25.093
BASEMENT AND IN SOME RESPECTS   
IT PROBABLY PRESERVED THE LIFE  
OF THE TREES A LITTLE BIT       

00:50:25.095 --> 00:50:25.761
IT PROBABLY PRESERVED THE LIFE  
OF THE TREES A LITTLE BIT       
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CLOSE TO    

00:50:25.763 --> 00:50:28.564
OF THE TREES A LITTLE BIT       
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CLOSE TO    
THE HOUSE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S A        

00:50:28.566 --> 00:50:32.234
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CLOSE TO    
THE HOUSE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S A        
CONCERN ABOUT BRANCHES AND      

00:50:32.236 --> 00:50:33.101
THE HOUSE THAT THERE&amp;apos;S A        
CONCERN ABOUT BRANCHES AND      
OTHER OTHER THINGS LIVING       

00:50:33.103 --> 00:50:36.638
CONCERN ABOUT BRANCHES AND      
OTHER OTHER THINGS LIVING       
REALLY UNDERNEATH A REALLY BIG  

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:36.872
OTHER OTHER THINGS LIVING       
REALLY UNDERNEATH A REALLY BIG  
TREE.                           

00:50:36.874 --> 00:50:40.108
REALLY UNDERNEATH A REALLY BIG  
TREE.                           
SO MIGHT KEEP THEM ALIVE A      

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:40.976
TREE.                           
SO MIGHT KEEP THEM ALIVE A      
LITTLE LONGER AND I&amp;apos;M HAVING TO 

00:50:40.978 --> 00:50:43.679
SO MIGHT KEEP THEM ALIVE A      
LITTLE LONGER AND I&amp;apos;M HAVING TO 
CUT THEM DOWN FOR OTHER REASONS 

00:50:43.681 --> 00:50:47.082
LITTLE LONGER AND I&amp;apos;M HAVING TO 
CUT THEM DOWN FOR OTHER REASONS 
WITH RESPECT TO THE CORNER AND  

00:50:47.084 --> 00:50:48.116
CUT THEM DOWN FOR OTHER REASONS 
WITH RESPECT TO THE CORNER AND  
I THINK JILL SHOWED PHOTOS THAT 

00:50:48.118 --> 00:50:48.817
WITH RESPECT TO THE CORNER AND  
I THINK JILL SHOWED PHOTOS THAT 
WE OBTAINED FROM THE PREVIOUS   

00:50:48.819 --> 00:50:51.686
I THINK JILL SHOWED PHOTOS THAT 
WE OBTAINED FROM THE PREVIOUS   
OWNER SHOWING THAT THE          

00:50:51.688 --> 00:50:52.354

CHATEAUNEUF EDITION WAS         
COMPLETELY REMOVED IN THE EARLY 

00:50:55.692 --> 00:50:59.828
CHATEAUNEUF EDITION WAS         
COMPLETELY REMOVED IN THE EARLY 
90S AND THE ADDITION WAS ADDED  

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:03.399
COMPLETELY REMOVED IN THE EARLY 
90S AND THE ADDITION WAS ADDED  
WITH A CORNER IN FACT THAT IS A

00:51:07.171 --> 00:51:08.204
PARENT.                         
AND SO WE WERE KIND OF HOPING   
TO NOT HAVE TO DO IN ANOTHER    

00:51:08.206 --> 00:51:11.040
AND SO WE WERE KIND OF HOPING   
TO NOT HAVE TO DO IN ANOTHER    
CORNER INSET IN THE FOUNDATION  

00:51:11.042 --> 00:51:15.511
TO NOT HAVE TO DO IN ANOTHER

ASSUMING THIS IS BASED ON THE   
EXPERIENCE OF THAT HOUSE LEFTER 
AND I&amp;apos;M SURE THEY HAD TO DIG    

00:55:24.161 --> 00:55:28.163
EXPERIENCE OF THAT HOUSE LEFTER 
AND I&amp;apos;M SURE THEY HAD TO DIG    
NEAR TREES BEFORE BUT THEY&amp;apos;RE

,THE ONE RIGHT AT THE FRONT     

01:04:47.891 --> 01:04:48.556
WAY THAT THE PICTURE IS VIEWED  
,THE ONE RIGHT AT THE FRONT     
EDGE OF THE HOUSE, THE TIP      

01:04:48.558 --> 01:04:50.624
,THE ONE RIGHT AT THE FRONT     
EDGE OF THE HOUSE, THE TIP      
OF THE ROOF IS THE MIDDLE       

01:04:50.626 --> 01:04:51.125
EDGE OF THE HOUSE, THE TIP

01:04:51.127 --> 01:04:54.062
OF THE ROOF IS THE MIDDLE

YEAH MY SCREEN TURNED OK AND    

01:04:54.064 --> 01:04:55.162
OF THIS ONE TREE.

THEN THE ONE RIGHT NEXT TO IT   

01:04:55.164 --> 01:04:58.499

THEN THE ONE RIGHT NEXT TO IT   
IN BACK IS THE MOMENT OK OK     

01:04:58.501 --> 01:04:59.134
THEN THE ONE RIGHT NEXT TO IT   
IN BACK IS THE MOMENT OK OK     
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE   

01:04:59.136 --> 01:05:02.203
IN BACK IS THE MOMENT OK OK     
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE   
ALL THREE OF THESE TREES ARE    

01:05:02.205 --> 01:05:05.306
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE   
ALL THREE OF THESE TREES ARE    
ROUGHLY THE SAME SIZE ANYWAY SO 

01:05:05.308 --> 01:05:09.711
ALL THREE OF THESE TREES ARE

THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WOULD BE    

01:05:20.323 --> 01:05:23.658
FOUR FEET BUT I DO THINK THAT   
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WOULD BE    
CHANGED AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE  

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:28.329
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WOULD BE    
CHANGED AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE  
WHETHER THAT&amp;apos;S TOO MUCH OF A    

01:05:28.331 --> 01:05:31.031
CHANGED AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE  
WHETHER THAT&amp;apos;S TOO MUCH OF A    
CHANGE OR WHETHER IT&amp;apos;S

MORE LIVING SPACE BELOW GRADE   
IN THE HOUSE.                   

01:05:39.443 --> 01:05:40.508
MORE LIVING SPACE BELOW GRADE   
IN THE HOUSE.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, OK.                      
NOW I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE DESIGN.                     

01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:12.644
NOW I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE DESIGN.                     
CAN YOU EXPLAIN I GUESS TWO     

01:40:12.646 --> 01:40:16.282
THE DESIGN.                     
CAN YOU EXPLAIN I GUESS TWO     
THINGS EXPLAIN IN THE PREVIOUS  

01:40:16.284 --> 01:40:17.449
CAN YOU EXPLAIN I GUESS TWO     
THINGS EXPLAIN IN THE PREVIOUS  
VERSIONS WE SAW THIS WAS NOT AS 

01:40:17.451 --> 01:40:20.620
THINGS EXPLAIN IN THE PREVIOUS  
VERSIONS WE SAW THIS WAS NOT AS 
TALL AS THE NEIGHBORING         

01:40:20.622 --> 01:40:21.487
VERSIONS WE SAW THIS WAS NOT AS 
TALL AS THE NEIGHBORING         
BUILDING AND ON MAIN STREET AND 

01:40:21.489 --> 01:40:24.389
TALL AS THE NEIGHBORING         
BUILDING AND ON MAIN STREET AND 
NOW IT DOES APPEAR THAT IT&amp;apos;S    

01:40:24.391 --> 01:40:25.258
BUILDING AND ON MAIN STREET AND 
NOW IT DOES APPEAR THAT IT&amp;apos;S    
ACTUALLY TALLER THAN THAT THAT  

01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:27.860
NOW IT DOES APPEAR THAT IT&amp;apos;S    
ACTUALLY TALLER THAN THAT THAT  
THAT BUILDING I GUESS PLEASE    

01:40:27.862 --> 01:40:31.130
ACTUALLY TALLER THAN THAT THAT  
THAT BUILDING I GUESS PLEASE    
EXPLAIN THE THINKING THERE AND  

01:40:31.132 --> 01:40:35.167
THAT BUILDING I GUESS PLEASE    
EXPLAIN THE THINKING THERE AND  
AND ALSO THE YOU&amp;apos;VE HEARD ABOUT 

01:40:35.169 --> 01:40:36.335
EXPLAIN THE THINKING THERE AND  
AND ALSO THE YOU&amp;apos;VE HEARD ABOUT 
THE STORE FRONT THE THE FORTY   

01:40:36.337 --> 01:40:39.505
AND ALSO THE YOU&amp;apos;VE HEARD ABOUT 
THE STORE FRONT THE THE FORTY   
STOREFRONT THAT THAT IS         

01:40:39.507 --> 01:40:46.079
THE STORE FRONT THE THE FORTY   
STOREFRONT THAT THAT IS         
HISTORIC AND YOU&amp;apos;RE YOU&amp;apos;RE      

01:41:00.627 --> 01:41:02.829
PROPOSING TO MODIFY IT.         
SO I GUESS THOSE TWO THINGS I&amp;apos;D 
LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE     

01:41:02.831 --> 01:41:03.596
SO I GUESS THOSE TWO THINGS I&amp;apos;D 
LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE     
THINKING BEHIND SO SO WITH THE  

01:41:03.598 --> 01:41:04.329
LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE     
THINKING BEHIND SO SO WITH THE  
HEIGHT WE REALLY WANTED TO GO   

01:41:04.331 --> 01:41:04.997
THINKING BEHIND SO SO WITH THE  
HEIGHT WE REALLY WANTED TO GO   
ABOVE WHAT EXACTLY WHAT&amp;apos;S       

01:41:04.999 --> 01:41:05.398
HEIGHT WE REALLY WANTED TO GO   
ABOVE WHAT EXACTLY WHAT&amp;apos;S       
EXISTING TODAY.                 

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.132
ABOVE WHAT EXACTLY WHAT&amp;apos;S       
EXISTING TODAY.                 
SO THAT KIND OF DROVE SOME      

01:41:06.134 --> 01:41:06.865
EXISTING TODAY.                 
SO THAT KIND OF DROVE SOME      
OF THAT FLOOR HEIGHT UP TO      

01:41:06.867 --> 01:41:07.533
SO THAT KIND OF DROVE SOME      
OF THAT FLOOR HEIGHT UP TO      
WHERE JUST WE STARTED THE       

01:41:07.535 --> 01:41:08.267
OF THAT FLOOR HEIGHT UP TO      
WHERE JUST WE STARTED THE       
SECOND FLOOR AND CONSEQUENTLY   

01:41:08.269 --> 01:41:08.934
WHERE JUST WE STARTED THE       
SECOND FLOOR AND CONSEQUENTLY   
THE ADDITIONAL FLOORS ABOVE,    

01:41:08.936 --> 01:41:09.602
SECOND FLOOR AND CONSEQUENTLY   
THE ADDITIONAL FLOORS ABOVE,    
YOU KNOW, MOVED UP IN           

01:41:09.604 --> 01:41:10.335
THE ADDITIONAL FLOORS ABOVE,    
YOU KNOW, MOVED UP IN           
CONJUNCTION WHEN WE FIRST CAME  

01:41:10.337 --> 01:41:11.004
YOU KNOW, MOVED UP IN           
CONJUNCTION WHEN WE FIRST CAME  
BEFORE YOU GUYS WE HAD ALIGNED  

01:41:11.006 --> 01:41:11.737
CONJUNCTION WHEN WE FIRST CAME  
BEFORE YOU GUYS WE HAD ALIGNED  
IT WITH THE BUILDING TO THE     

01:41:11.739 --> 01:41:12.471
BEFORE YOU GUYS WE HAD ALIGNED  
IT WITH THE BUILDING TO THE     
DIRECTLY TO THE NORTH OF US.    

01:41:12.473 --> 01:41:13.238
IT WITH THE BUILDING TO THE     
DIRECTLY TO THE NORTH OF US.    
BUT IN JUST THROUGH THAT EXTRA  

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.440
DIRECTLY TO THE NORTH OF US.    
BUT IN JUST THROUGH THAT EXTRA  
DEVELOPMENT AND TRYING TO       

01:41:14.442 --> 01:41:15.274
BUT IN JUST THROUGH THAT EXTRA  
DEVELOPMENT AND TRYING TO       
PRESERVE EXACTLY WHAT WAS THERE 

01:41:15.276 --> 01:41:16.041
DEVELOPMENT AND TRYING TO       
PRESERVE EXACTLY WHAT WAS THERE 
ON THE GROUND FLOOR, EVERYTHING 

01:41:16.043 --> 01:41:18.043
PRESERVE EXACTLY WHAT WAS THERE 
ON THE GROUND FLOOR, EVERYTHING 
KIND OF ROSE UP A LITTLE BIT    

01:41:18.045 --> 01:41:18.311
ON THE GROUND FLOOR, EVERYTHING 
KIND OF ROSE UP A LITTLE BIT    
HIGHER.                         

01:41:18.313 --> 01:41:21.580
KIND OF ROSE UP A LITTLE BIT    
HIGHER.                         
THE CLIENT ALSO HAD A A DESIRE  

01:41:21.582 --> 01:41:22.581
HIGHER.                         
THE CLIENT ALSO HAD A A DESIRE  
TO MAKE THIS A GREEN AND VERY   

01:41:22.583 --> 01:41:23.216
THE CLIENT ALSO HAD A A DESIRE  
TO MAKE THIS A GREEN AND VERY   
SUSTAINABLE BUILDING AND THE    

01:41:23.218 --> 01:41:25.885
TO MAKE THIS A GREEN AND VERY   
SUSTAINABLE BUILDING AND THE    
ADDITION OF THE GREEN ROOF ON   

01:41:25.887 --> 01:41:26.685
SUSTAINABLE BUILDING AND THE    
ADDITION OF THE GREEN ROOF ON   
THE TOP REQUIRED A LITTLE BIT   

01:41:26.687 --> 01:41:29.889
ADDITION OF THE GREEN ROOF ON   
THE TOP REQUIRED A LITTLE BIT   
MORE DEPTH OR HEIGHT ON THAT    

01:41:29.891 --> 01:41:30.356
THE TOP REQUIRED A LITTLE BIT   
MORE DEPTH OR HEIGHT ON THAT    
UPPER LEVEL.                    

01:41:30.358 --> 01:41:32.491
MORE DEPTH OR HEIGHT ON THAT    
UPPER LEVEL.                    
SO SO WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP    

01:41:32.493 --> 01:41:33.392
UPPER LEVEL.                    
SO SO WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP    
BEFORE THE RAILING STARTS TO    

01:41:33.394 --> 01:41:36.428
SO SO WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP    
BEFORE THE RAILING STARTS TO    
THAT ROOFLINE THAT GREEN ROOF   

01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:37.530
BEFORE THE RAILING STARTS TO    
THAT ROOFLINE THAT GREEN ROOF   
LINE TO BE JUST ABOUT EVEN WITH 

01:41:37.532 --> 01:41:40.833
THAT ROOFLINE THAT GREEN ROOF   
LINE TO BE JUST ABOUT EVEN WITH 
THE EXISTING BUILDING TO THE    

01:41:40.835 --> 01:41:41.400
LINE TO BE JUST ABOUT EVEN WITH 
THE EXISTING BUILDING TO THE    
NORTH OF IT THAT WAS            

01:41:41.402 --> 01:41:44.503
THE EXISTING BUILDING TO THE    
NORTH OF IT THAT WAS            
HISTORICALLY PREVIOUS TO THE

HISTORICALLY PREVIOUS TO THE    
MODIFICATION TO THE BUILDING

SO THE THE THOUGHT THERE WAS    
AGAIN DUE TO THE LIMITED NATURE 
OF THE FOUR PLATE ITSELF IF WE  

01:42:06.528 --> 01:42:07.626
AGAIN DUE TO THE LIMITED NATURE 
OF THE FOUR PLATE ITSELF IF WE  
PULLED THAT STAIR AND THAT THAT 

01:42:07.628 --> 01:42:10.696
OF THE FOUR PLATE ITSELF IF WE  
PULLED THAT STAIR AND THAT THAT 
ELEVATOR CORE UP SLIGHTLY BUT   

01:42:10.698 --> 01:42:11.664
PULLED THAT STAIR AND THAT THAT

OWN RIGHT WILL BE RETAINED AND  
PRESERVED.                      
SO IT IS THAT THE STANDARD THAT 

01:50:24.225 --> 01:50:27.959

ESTABLISHING AND ALSO WITH THE  
SURVEY ESTABLISHING THIS SINGLE 
STOREY BUILDING AS THE          

01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:40.725
SURVEY ESTABLISHING THIS SINGLE 
STOREY BUILDING AS THE

WE&amp;apos;RE REACTING AGAINST RIGHT    
NOW IS CRITICAL.                
I THINK THE OTHER PIECE ABOUT   

01:52:45.298 --> 01:52:47.266
NOW IS CRITICAL.                
I THINK THE OTHER PIECE ABOUT   
WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING OR THE POINT 

01:52:47.268 --> 01:52:48.067
I THINK THE OTHER PIECE ABOUT   
WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING OR THE POINT 
YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING, BOB, IS THAT     

01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:49.000
WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING OR THE POINT 
YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING, BOB, IS THAT     
THERE WELL, THIS WAS A THREE    

01:52:49.002 --> 01:52:52.036
YOU&amp;apos;RE MAKING, BOB, IS THAT     
THERE WELL, THIS WAS A THREE    
STOREY STRUCTURE AT VARIOUS     

01:52:52.038 --> 01:52:54.572
THERE WELL, THIS WAS A THREE    
STOREY STRUCTURE AT VARIOUS     
POINTS HISTORICALLY IT HAD      

01:52:54.574 --> 01:52:55.307
STOREY STRUCTURE AT VARIOUS     
POINTS HISTORICALLY IT HAD      
DIFFERENT ITERATIONS ITALIANATE 

01:52:55.309 --> 01:52:59.010
POINTS HISTORICALLY IT HAD      
DIFFERENT ITERATIONS ITALIANATE 
IT CHANGED ITS WINDOWS.         

01:52:59.012 --> 01:52:59.945
DIFFERENT ITERATIONS ITALIANATE 
IT CHANGED ITS WINDOWS.         
IT HAD DIFFERENT PATTERNS.      

01:52:59.947 --> 01:53:00.679
IT CHANGED ITS WINDOWS.         
IT HAD DIFFERENT PATTERNS.      
SO I THINK IN THE WORKING       

01:53:00.681 --> 01:53:01.880
IT HAD DIFFERENT PATTERNS.      
SO I THINK IN THE WORKING       
SESSION THERE INITIALLY THERE   

01:53:01.882 --> 01:53:06.618
SO I THINK IN THE WORKING       
SESSION THERE INITIALLY THERE   
WAS A A DESIGN THAT KIND        

01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:09.888
SESSION THERE INITIALLY THERE   
WAS A A DESIGN THAT KIND        
OF RESTORED ONE ITERATION       

01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:10.388
WAS A A DESIGN THAT KIND        
OF RESTORED ONE ITERATION       
OF THAT BUILDING.               

01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:11.523
OF RESTORED ONE ITERATION       
OF THAT BUILDING.               
SO THAT BROUGHT UP TO US AS A   

01:53:11.525 --> 01:53:13.491
OF THAT BUILDING.               
SO THAT BROUGHT UP TO US AS A   
COMMISSION AND THE QUESTION     

01:53:13.493 --> 01:53:14.292
SO THAT BROUGHT UP TO US AS A   
COMMISSION AND THE QUESTION     
OF WHICH WHICH RESOURCE IS      

01:53:14.294 --> 01:53:18.664
COMMISSION AND THE QUESTION     
OF WHICH WHICH RESOURCE IS      
REALLY THE ONE TO TO PRESERVE   

01:53:18.666 --> 01:53:19.231
OF WHICH WHICH RESOURCE IS      
REALLY THE ONE TO TO PRESERVE   
OR TO RECONSTRUCT AND THAT THAT 

01:53:19.233 --> 01:53:21.165
REALLY THE ONE TO TO PRESERVE   
OR TO RECONSTRUCT AND THAT THAT 
ITSELF BROUGHT UP AN ISSUE      

01:53:21.167 --> 01:53:21.999
OR TO RECONSTRUCT AND THAT THAT 
ITSELF BROUGHT UP AN ISSUE      
OF LIKE WHICH WHICH IS THE      

01:53:22.001 --> 01:53:22.234
ITSELF BROUGHT UP AN ISSUE      
OF LIKE WHICH WHICH IS THE      
THING.                          

01:53:22.236 --> 01:53:25.570
OF LIKE WHICH WHICH IS THE      
THING.                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK I DON&amp;apos;T TO ME     

01:53:25.572 --> 01:53:28.874
THING.                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK I DON&amp;apos;T TO ME     
IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT LESS     

01:53:28.876 --> 01:53:32.677
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I THINK I DON&amp;apos;T TO ME     
IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT LESS     
OF THE THE THREE STORY IN TOTAL 

01:53:32.679 --> 01:53:33.679
IT&amp;apos;S IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT LESS     
OF THE THE THREE STORY IN TOTAL 
BUT THE I THINK RIGHT NOW THE   

01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:36.214
OF THE THE THREE STORY IN TOTAL 
BUT THE I THINK RIGHT NOW THE   
AS PROPOSED IN ITS DESIGN THE   

01:53:36.216 --> 01:53:37.148
BUT THE I THINK RIGHT NOW THE   
AS PROPOSED IN ITS DESIGN THE   
THINGS THAT I&amp;apos;M READING AS FAR  

01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:43.789
AS PROPOSED IN ITS DESIGN THE   
THINGS THAT I&amp;apos;M READING AS FAR  
AS THE THE MAJORITY OF THE      

01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:44.656
THINGS THAT I&amp;apos;M READING AS FAR  
AS THE THE MAJORITY OF THE      
GUIDELINES TALK ABOUT STEP BACK 

01:53:44.658 --> 01:53:47.959
AS THE THE MAJORITY OF THE      
GUIDELINES TALK ABOUT STEP BACK 
FROM THE BUILDING FACADE NOT    

01:53:47.961 --> 01:53:48.693
GUIDELINES TALK ABOUT STEP BACK 
FROM THE BUILDING FACADE NOT    
OVERSHADOWING THE CONTRIBUTING  

01:53:48.695 --> 01:53:51.996
FROM THE BUILDING FACADE NOT    
OVERSHADOWING THE CONTRIBUTING  
RESOURCE.                       

01:53:51.998 --> 01:53:56.101
OVERSHADOWING THE CONTRIBUTING  
RESOURCE.                       
AND IF I LOOK I THINK FOR FOR   

01:53:56.103 --> 01:53:59.237
RESOURCE.                       
AND IF I LOOK I THINK FOR FOR   
ME THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS  

01:53:59.239 --> 01:54:00.005
AND IF I LOOK I THINK FOR FOR   
ME THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS  
TO LOOK AT IN THIS DESIGN AND   

01:54:00.007 --> 01:54:00.739
ME THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS  
TO LOOK AT IN THIS DESIGN AND   
MAYBE THE PREVIOUS ITERATION    

01:54:00.741 --> 01:54:04.342
TO LOOK AT IN THIS DESIGN AND   
MAYBE THE PREVIOUS ITERATION    
OF THIS DESIGN WHICH IS VERY    

01:54:04.344 --> 01:54:05.009
MAYBE THE PREVIOUS ITERATION    
OF THIS DESIGN WHICH IS VERY    
SIMILAR TO WORKING SESSION      

01:54:05.011 --> 01:54:07.679
OF THIS DESIGN WHICH IS VERY    
SIMILAR TO WORKING SESSION      
NUMBER THREE, THERE WAS A LOT   

01:54:07.681 --> 01:54:10.815
SIMILAR TO WORKING SESSION      
NUMBER THREE, THERE WAS A LOT   
MORE CONSIDERATION ABOUT        

01:54:10.817 --> 01:54:11.783
NUMBER THREE, THERE WAS A LOT   
MORE CONSIDERATION ABOUT        
STEPPING BACK IN AND PLAYING    

01:54:11.785 --> 01:54:15.320
MORE CONSIDERATION ABOUT        
STEPPING BACK IN AND PLAYING    
FROM THAT THAT FRONT WALL       

01:54:15.322 --> 01:54:19.157
STEPPING BACK IN AND PLAYING    
FROM THAT THAT FRONT WALL       
FACADE THAT I THINK MACING WISE 

01:54:19.159 --> 01:54:19.991
FROM THAT THAT FRONT WALL       
FACADE THAT I THINK MACING WISE 
WAS A LITTLE IT BECAME ALMOST   

01:54:19.993 --> 01:54:23.161
FACADE THAT I THINK MACING WISE 
WAS A LITTLE IT BECAME ALMOST   
MORE APPROPRIATE OR MORE

BUT IF YOU LOOK AT A PART EIGHT 
,IT&amp;apos;S HARD TO IT&amp;apos;S HARD TO SEE  
HOW A ADDITIONS LIKE ANY

02:05:21.221 --> 02:05:22.120
EDITION SHOULD BE SUBORDINATE   
AND SIZE AND DESIGN ARE

02:05:22.122 --> 02:05:22.953
AND SIZE AND DESIGN ARE         
DESIGNED TO THE OUR BUILDING.   
THE ADDITIONS SHOULD BE         

02:05:22.955 --> 02:05:25.323
DESIGNED TO THE OUR BUILDING.   
THE ADDITIONS SHOULD BE         
MINIMALLY VISIBLE.              

02:05:25.325 --> 02:05:26.256
THE ADDITIONS SHOULD BE         
MINIMALLY VISIBLE.              
THE ROOFTOP EDITION SHOULD BE   

02:05:26.258 --> 02:05:29.893
MINIMALLY VISIBLE.              
THE ROOFTOP EDITION SHOULD BE

02:05:34.567 --> 02:05:41.038
THE ADDITIONS SHOULD NOT BE     
MORE THAN ONE STORY IN HEIGHT.  
SO I MEAN WITH THAT EXTRA       

02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:41.572
MORE THAN ONE STORY IN HEIGHT.  
SO I MEAN WITH THAT EXTRA       
EXPLANATION FROM THE            

02:05:41.574 --> 02:05:42.273
SO I MEAN WITH THAT EXTRA       
EXPLANATION FROM THE            
PRESERVATION BRIEF IT JUST      

02:05:42.275 --> 02:05:47.679
EXPLANATION FROM THE            
PRESERVATION BRIEF IT JUST      
SEEMS THAT THE STANDARDS BECOME 

02:05:47.681 --> 02:05:51.849
PRESERVATION BRIEF IT JUST      
SEEMS THAT THE STANDARDS BECOME 
MUCH CLEARER AS TO WHAT IS      

02:05:51.851 --> 02:05:54.485
SEEMS THAT THE STANDARDS BECOME 
MUCH CLEARER AS TO WHAT IS      
POSSIBLE HERE IF WE ARE SAYING  

02:05:54.487 --> 02:05:55.386
MUCH CLEARER AS TO WHAT IS      
POSSIBLE HERE IF WE ARE SAYING  
I MEAN THE STAFF REPORT TO BE   

02:05:55.388 --> 02:05:58.722
POSSIBLE HERE IF WE ARE SAYING  
I MEAN THE STAFF REPORT TO BE   
FAIR ALSO SAYS THAT IT DOES DO  

02:05:58.724 --> 02:05:59.323
I MEAN THE STAFF REPORT TO BE   
FAIR ALSO SAYS THAT IT DOES DO  
CERTAIN THINGS FROM THE         

02:05:59.325 --> 02:06:02.192
FAIR ALSO SAYS THAT IT DOES DO  
CERTAIN THINGS FROM THE         
PRESERVATION BRIEF BUT          

02:06:02.194 --> 02:06:05.629
CERTAIN THINGS FROM THE         
PRESERVATION BRIEF BUT          
OF COURSE WE YOU HAVE TO MEET   

02:06:05.631 --> 02:06:06.230
PRESERVATION BRIEF BUT          
OF COURSE WE YOU HAVE TO MEET   
ALL THE STANDARDS RIGHT.        

02:06:06.232 --> 02:06:07.164
OF COURSE WE YOU HAVE TO MEET   
ALL THE STANDARDS RIGHT.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOT JUST SOME OF THE         

02:06:07.166 --> 02:06:09.433
ALL THE STANDARDS RIGHT.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOT JUST SOME OF THE

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOT JUST SOME OF THE         
STANDARDS.                      
SO THE DESIGN IS DISTINGUISHED  

02:06:13.272 --> 02:06:14.071
STANDARDS.                      
SO THE DESIGN IS DISTINGUISHED  
FROM IN DESIGN AND MATERIALS    

02:06:14.073 --> 02:06:14.739
SO THE DESIGN IS DISTINGUISHED  
FROM IN DESIGN AND MATERIALS    
FROM THE HISTORIC BUILDING      

02:06:14.741 --> 02:06:17.541
FROM IN DESIGN AND MATERIALS    
FROM THE HISTORIC BUILDING      
CERTAINLY AT CONSTRUCTION       

02:06:17.543 --> 02:06:18.209
FROM THE HISTORIC BUILDING      
CERTAINLY AT CONSTRUCTION       
MATERIALS ARE MODERN BUT        

02:06:18.211 --> 02:06:21.846
CERTAINLY AT CONSTRUCTION       
MATERIALS ARE MODERN BUT        
HARMONIOUS AND THIS ONE         

02:06:21.848 --> 02:06:24.715
MATERIALS ARE MODERN BUT        
HARMONIOUS AND THIS ONE         
ADJACENT BUILDINGS ARE          

02:06:24.717 --> 02:06:25.450
HARMONIOUS AND THIS ONE         
ADJACENT BUILDINGS ARE          
CURRENTLY TALLER THAN THIS ONE  

02:06:25.452 --> 02:06:28.252
ADJACENT BUILDINGS ARE          
CURRENTLY TALLER THAN THIS ONE  
AND THE RESULTING BUILDING      

02:06:28.254 --> 02:06:29.120
CURRENTLY TALLER THAN THIS ONE  
AND THE RESULTING BUILDING      
WOULD BE SIMILAR SIZE TO        

02:06:29.122 --> 02:06:29.653
AND THE RESULTING BUILDING      
WOULD BE SIMILAR SIZE TO        
ADJACENT BUILDINGS.             

02:06:29.655 --> 02:06:32.423
WOULD BE SIMILAR SIZE TO        
ADJACENT BUILDINGS.             
SO THAT&amp;apos;S THAT&amp;apos;S MAYBE ONE THAT 

02:06:32.425 --> 02:06:33.224
ADJACENT BUILDINGS.

ALMOST DOING THE FIRST SESSION

IT&amp;apos;S NOT QUITE DOING IT&amp;apos;S       
ALMOST DOING THE FIRST SESSION  
IT DID MEET THAT STANDARD IF    

02:06:43.370 --> 02:06:44.468
ALMOST DOING THE FIRST SESSION  
IT DID MEET THAT STANDARD IF    
YOU LOOK ON PAGE ELEVEN AND YOU 

02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:45.169
IT DID MEET THAT STANDARD IF    
YOU LOOK ON PAGE ELEVEN AND YOU

02:06:45.171 --> 02:06:46.637
YOU LOOK ON PAGE ELEVEN AND YOU 
LOOK AT THE BUILDING WELL IT    
WAS MORE THAN ONE STORY IN      

02:06:46.639 --> 02:06:49.506
LOOK AT THE BUILDING WELL IT    
WAS MORE THAN ONE STORY IN

ONE STORY.                      
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH.                        

02:06:58.485 --> 02:07:08.459

POINT JUST OF ORDER.            
SO THE MOTION ON THE FLOOR WAS
