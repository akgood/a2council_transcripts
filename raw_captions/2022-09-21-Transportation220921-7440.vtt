00:20:56.998 --> 00:21:00.799
MOVING TOGETHER TO LEARN ABOUT  
OUR VISION ZERO.                
SO HOW WOULD THE STREETS CHANGE 

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:01.133
OUR VISION ZERO.                
SO HOW WOULD THE STREETS CHANGE 
AGAIN?                          

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.167
SO HOW WOULD THE STREETS CHANGE 
AGAIN?                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS JUST THE EXISTING    

00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:05.571
AGAIN?                          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS JUST THE EXISTING    
CONDITIONS HERE THE STREET AND  

00:21:05.573 --> 00:21:09.441
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS JUST THE EXISTING    
CONDITIONS HERE THE STREET AND  
CURRENTLY IT&amp;apos;S BEING USE A      

00:21:09.443 --> 00:21:10.308
CONDITIONS HERE THE STREET AND  
CURRENTLY IT&amp;apos;S BEING USE A      
CROSS SECTION OF THE FULL WIDTH 

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.844
CURRENTLY IT&amp;apos;S BEING USE A      
CROSS SECTION OF THE FULL WIDTH 
WHICH IS ABOUT FORTY TWO FEET.  

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:13.446
CROSS SECTION OF THE FULL WIDTH 
WHICH IS ABOUT FORTY TWO FEET.  
IT&amp;apos;S NOT LARGE.                 

00:21:13.448 --> 00:21:16.615
WHICH IS ABOUT FORTY TWO FEET.  
IT&amp;apos;S NOT LARGE.                 
SO WE HAVE PARKING ON BOTH      

00:21:16.617 --> 00:21:17.149
IT&amp;apos;S NOT LARGE.                 
SO WE HAVE PARKING ON BOTH      
SIDES OF THE ROAD.              

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:18.116
SO WE HAVE PARKING ON BOTH      
SIDES OF THE ROAD.              
WE HAVE SIDEWALK ON BOTH SIDES  

00:21:18.118 --> 00:21:20.752
SIDES OF THE ROAD.              
WE HAVE SIDEWALK ON BOTH SIDES  
SEPARATED BY A BIT OF AN        

00:21:20.754 --> 00:21:24.222
WE HAVE SIDEWALK ON BOTH SIDES  
SEPARATED BY A BIT OF AN        
EASEMENT AND THE BIKES AND THE  

00:21:24.224 --> 00:21:24.890
SEPARATED BY A BIT OF AN        
EASEMENT AND THE BIKES AND THE  
CARS SUPPOSEDLY SHARE THE ROAD  

00:21:24.892 --> 00:21:30.629
EASEMENT AND THE BIKES AND THE  
CARS SUPPOSEDLY SHARE THE ROAD  
IN BETWEEN PARKING AND THERE&amp;apos;S  

00:21:30.631 --> 00:21:34.133
CARS SUPPOSEDLY SHARE THE ROAD  
IN BETWEEN PARKING AND THERE&amp;apos;S  
VERY WIDE WE CAN DEFINITELY     

00:21:34.135 --> 00:21:34.667
IN BETWEEN PARKING AND THERE&amp;apos;S  
VERY WIDE WE CAN DEFINITELY     
PROVIDE SOME SAFE               

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:37.769
VERY WIDE WE CAN DEFINITELY     
PROVIDE SOME SAFE               
TRANSPORTATION FOR THE CYCLISTS 

00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:41.173
PROVIDE SOME SAFE               
TRANSPORTATION FOR THE CYCLISTS 
I BELIEVE HOWEVER THIS BECAUSE  

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:42.174
TRANSPORTATION FOR THE CYCLISTS 
I BELIEVE HOWEVER THIS BECAUSE  
OF THE CLASS OF THE ROAD, THE   

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:45.978
I BELIEVE HOWEVER THIS BECAUSE  
OF THE CLASS OF THE ROAD, THE   
SPEED AND THE FACT THAT IT&amp;apos;S SO 

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.415
OF THE CLASS OF THE ROAD, THE   
SPEED AND THE FACT THAT IT&amp;apos;S SO 
LOCAL RESIDENTIAL WHAT THEY     

00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:52.952
SPEED AND THE FACT THAT IT&amp;apos;S SO 
LOCAL RESIDENTIAL WHAT THEY     
HAVE EXISTING SATISFIES ALL     

00:21:52.954 --> 00:21:53.819
LOCAL RESIDENTIAL WHAT THEY     
HAVE EXISTING SATISFIES ALL     
AGES AND ABILITIES GUIDELINES.  

00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:56.388
HAVE EXISTING SATISFIES ALL     
AGES AND ABILITIES GUIDELINES.  
HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME FURTHER 

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.655
AGES AND ABILITIES GUIDELINES.  
HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME FURTHER 
OPTIONS.                        

00:21:56.657 --> 00:21:57.456
HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME FURTHER 
OPTIONS.                        
SO RIGHT NOW THIS IS CHERYL.    

00:21:57.458 --> 00:22:00.592
OPTIONS.                        
SO RIGHT NOW THIS IS CHERYL.    
WE COULD IMPROVE THIS JUST BY   

00:22:00.594 --> 00:22:03.829
SO RIGHT NOW THIS IS CHERYL.    
WE COULD IMPROVE THIS JUST BY   
USING THE SAME USE BUT          

00:22:03.831 --> 00:22:04.430
WE COULD IMPROVE THIS JUST BY   
USING THE SAME USE BUT          
PROVIDING SOME PAVEMENT         

00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:05.364
USING THE SAME USE BUT          
PROVIDING SOME PAVEMENT         
MARKINGS AND THAT WAY WE COULD  

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:08.834
PROVIDING SOME PAVEMENT         
MARKINGS AND THAT WAY WE COULD  
ALSO MAKE THE LANE A BIT        

00:22:08.836 --> 00:22:09.502
MARKINGS AND THAT WAY WE COULD  
ALSO MAKE THE LANE A BIT        
SMALLER THAN WHAT PEOPLE        

00:22:09.504 --> 00:22:12.705
ALSO MAKE THE LANE A BIT        
SMALLER THAN WHAT PEOPLE        
POWERCOR CURRENTLY USE BECAUSE  

00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:13.439
SMALLER THAN WHAT PEOPLE        
POWERCOR CURRENTLY USE BECAUSE  
NORMALLY THE PARKING IS ONLY    

00:22:13.441 --> 00:22:16.775
POWERCOR CURRENTLY USE BECAUSE  
NORMALLY THE PARKING IS ONLY    
SEVEN FEET SO WE KIND OF MARK   

00:22:16.777 --> 00:22:17.543
NORMALLY THE PARKING IS ONLY    
SEVEN FEET SO WE KIND OF MARK   
IT SO IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT WIDER   

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:20.078
SEVEN FEET SO WE KIND OF MARK   
IT SO IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT WIDER   
SO THE LANES ARE A BIT SMALLER  

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.913
IT SO IT&amp;apos;S A LITTLE BIT WIDER   
SO THE LANES ARE A BIT SMALLER  
SO PEOPLE MAY GO SLOWER.        

00:22:20.915 --> 00:22:24.316
SO THE LANES ARE A BIT SMALLER  
SO PEOPLE MAY GO SLOWER.        
THIS IS JUST TO MARK WHAT       

00:22:24.318 --> 00:22:25.184
SO PEOPLE MAY GO SLOWER.        
THIS IS JUST TO MARK WHAT       
THEY&amp;apos;RE CURRENTLY USING THAT WE 

00:22:25.186 --> 00:22:27.252
THIS IS JUST TO MARK WHAT       
THEY&amp;apos;RE CURRENTLY USING THAT WE 
THINK THEY&amp;apos;RE USEFUL.           

00:22:27.254 --> 00:22:31.523
THEY&amp;apos;RE CURRENTLY USING THAT WE 
THINK THEY&amp;apos;RE USEFUL.           
THEY&amp;apos;RE THE OPTIONS THAT WE     

00:22:31.525 --> 00:22:32.491
THINK THEY&amp;apos;RE USEFUL.           
THEY&amp;apos;RE THE OPTIONS THAT WE     
DISCUSSED NOW IS TO TAKE OUT A  

00:22:32.493 --> 00:22:35.661
THEY&amp;apos;RE THE OPTIONS THAT WE     
DISCUSSED NOW IS TO TAKE OUT A  
SHARED USE SPACE FOR BIKES AND  

00:22:35.663 --> 00:22:36.461
DISCUSSED NOW IS TO TAKE OUT A  
SHARED USE SPACE FOR BIKES AND  
MOTORISTS AND CREATE EITHER A   

00:22:36.463 --> 00:22:39.931
SHARED USE SPACE FOR BIKES AND  
MOTORISTS AND CREATE EITHER A   
DESIGNATED BIKE LANE WHICH IS   

00:22:39.933 --> 00:22:40.565
MOTORISTS AND CREATE EITHER A   
DESIGNATED BIKE LANE WHICH IS   
YOUR STANDARD BIKE LANE.        

00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:41.167
DESIGNATED BIKE LANE WHICH IS   
YOUR STANDARD BIKE LANE.        
IT&amp;apos;S FIVE FEET WIDE.            

00:22:41.169 --> 00:22:44.169
YOUR STANDARD BIKE LANE.        
IT&amp;apos;S FIVE FEET WIDE.            
WE COULD ALSO DO A BUFFORD BIKE 

00:22:44.171 --> 00:22:44.903
IT&amp;apos;S FIVE FEET WIDE.            
WE COULD ALSO DO A BUFFORD BIKE 
LANE THAT WOULD BE A THREE FOOT 

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:47.873
WE COULD ALSO DO A BUFFORD BIKE 
LANE THAT WOULD BE A THREE FOOT 
WIDE BUFFER SPACE AND THEN DOWN 

00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:51.343
LANE THAT WOULD BE A THREE FOOT 
WIDE BUFFER SPACE AND THEN DOWN 
THE ROAD OR EVEN POSSIBLY IN    

00:22:51.345 --> 00:22:55.280
WIDE BUFFER SPACE AND THEN DOWN 
THE ROAD OR EVEN POSSIBLY IN    
THE NEAR FUTURE WE WILL BE ABLE 

00:22:55.282 --> 00:22:56.282
THE ROAD OR EVEN POSSIBLY IN    
THE NEAR FUTURE WE WILL BE ABLE 
TO MAINTAIN BIKE LANES THAT ARE 

00:22:56.284 --> 00:22:59.618
THE NEAR FUTURE WE WILL BE ABLE 
TO MAINTAIN BIKE LANES THAT ARE 
ONLY FIVE FEET WIDE.            

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.719
TO MAINTAIN BIKE LANES THAT ARE 
ONLY FIVE FEET WIDE.            
SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT      

00:23:00.721 --> 00:23:04.056
ONLY FIVE FEET WIDE.            
SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT      
BOLLARDS OF IN THE SPACE AND    

00:23:04.058 --> 00:23:07.426
SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT      
BOLLARDS OF IN THE SPACE AND    
HAVE A SEPARATE BIKE LANE THAT  

00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:08.127
BOLLARDS OF IN THE SPACE AND    
HAVE A SEPARATE BIKE LANE THAT  
WOULD BE EVEN MORE SAFE.        

00:23:08.129 --> 00:23:11.329
HAVE A SEPARATE BIKE LANE THAT  
WOULD BE EVEN MORE SAFE.        
SO THESE WERE OPPOSITE IT TO    

00:23:11.331 --> 00:23:11.663
WOULD BE EVEN MORE SAFE.        
SO THESE WERE OPPOSITE IT TO    
EVERYBODY.                      

00:23:11.665 --> 00:23:14.800
SO THESE WERE OPPOSITE IT TO    
EVERYBODY.                      
THIS EXAMPLE IS JUST A FORWARD  

00:23:14.802 --> 00:23:15.600
EVERYBODY.                      
THIS EXAMPLE IS JUST A FORWARD  
SECTION WITH A DESIGNATED BIKE  

00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:18.603
THIS EXAMPLE IS JUST A FORWARD  
SECTION WITH A DESIGNATED BIKE  
LANE SO THE PARKING WOULD STILL 

00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:19.605
SECTION WITH A DESIGNATED BIKE  
LANE SO THE PARKING WOULD STILL 
BE AT THE EDGE OF THE CURBS.    

00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.573
LANE SO THE PARKING WOULD STILL 
BE AT THE EDGE OF THE CURBS.    
WE WOULD HAVE A TEN FOOT LANES  

00:23:21.575 --> 00:23:22.674
BE AT THE EDGE OF THE CURBS.    
WE WOULD HAVE A TEN FOOT LANES  
FOR THE MOTORIST AND FIVE FOOT  

00:23:22.676 --> 00:23:29.381
WE WOULD HAVE A TEN FOOT LANES  
FOR THE MOTORIST AND FIVE FOOT  
BIKE NOW IF WE DECIDED TO       

00:23:29.383 --> 00:23:34.053
FOR THE MOTORIST AND FIVE FOOT  
BIKE NOW IF WE DECIDED TO       
BUTTON BIKE LANES WE WOULD HAVE 

00:23:34.055 --> 00:23:34.854
BIKE NOW IF WE DECIDED TO       
BUTTON BIKE LANES WE WOULD HAVE 
TO REMOVE PARKING ON ONE SIDE   

00:23:34.856 --> 00:23:37.123
BUTTON BIKE LANES WE WOULD HAVE 
TO REMOVE PARKING ON ONE SIDE   
BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T SPACE FOR THAT 

00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:37.823
TO REMOVE PARKING ON ONE SIDE   
BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T SPACE FOR THAT 
EXTRA SIX FEET THAT WE ARE      

00:23:37.825 --> 00:23:40.759
BECAUSE WE DON&amp;apos;T SPACE FOR THAT 
EXTRA SIX FEET THAT WE ARE      
OFFERING FOR THE BUFFER.        

00:23:40.761 --> 00:23:41.760
EXTRA SIX FEET THAT WE ARE      
OFFERING FOR THE BUFFER.        
SO YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TEN     

00:23:41.762 --> 00:23:42.461
OFFERING FOR THE BUFFER.        
SO YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TEN     
FOOT LANES, FIVE FOOT BIKE      

00:23:42.463 --> 00:23:44.529
SO YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TEN     
FOOT LANES, FIVE FOOT BIKE      
LANES, YOU&amp;apos;D HAVE THE THREE     

00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:45.531

00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:49.534
HAVE PARKING ON ONE SIDE OF THE

THIS IS THE FUTURE IF IT MIGHT  
BE A SEPARATED BIKE LANE WE     

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:03.849
THIS IS THE FUTURE IF IT MIGHT  
BE A SEPARATED BIKE LANE WE     
WOULD PUT SOME VERTICAL         

00:24:03.851 --> 00:24:07.852
BE A SEPARATED BIKE LANE WE     
WOULD PUT SOME VERTICAL         
SEPARATION ELEMENTS THERE TO    

00:24:07.854 --> 00:24:08.620
WOULD PUT SOME VERTICAL

KEEP BICYCLISTS FEELING EVEN    
SAFER.                          
THE OTHER CROSS SECTIONS ARE    

00:24:15.096 --> 00:24:15.927
SAFER.                          
THE OTHER CROSS SECTIONS ARE    
GOING TO BE COMING WHEN YOU     

00:24:15.929 --> 00:24:19.164
THE OTHER CROSS SECTIONS ARE    
GOING TO BE COMING WHEN YOU     
APPROACH INTERSECTION OR A MID

BLOCK CROSSING WHERE WE&amp;apos;RE      
GOING TO PROPOSE BUMP OUT ON    
SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS HAVE    

00:24:23.404 --> 00:24:24.269
GOING TO PROPOSE BUMP OUT ON    
SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS HAVE    
BUMP OUTS ONLY ON THE ONE SIDE  

00:24:24.271 --> 00:24:26.004
SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS HAVE    
BUMP OUTS ONLY ON THE ONE SIDE  
THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF INTERSECTIONS  

00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:26.739
BUMP OUTS ONLY ON THE ONE SIDE  
THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF INTERSECTIONS  
OUT THERE ALONG SIDE SEVEN BUT  

00:24:26.741 --> 00:24:31.043
THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF INTERSECTIONS  
OUT THERE ALONG SIDE SEVEN BUT  
WE DO PROPOSE A BLOCK CROSSING  

00:24:31.045 --> 00:24:34.613
OUT THERE ALONG SIDE SEVEN BUT  
WE DO PROPOSE A BLOCK CROSSING  
ABOUT ON GREENVIEW AS IT ENTERS 

00:24:34.615 --> 00:24:40.685
WE DO PROPOSE A BLOCK CROSSING  
ABOUT ON GREENVIEW AS IT ENTERS 
THE PARK FOR THE SCHOOL.        

00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:44.989
ABOUT ON GREENVIEW AS IT ENTERS 
THE PARK FOR THE SCHOOL.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO HERE ARE GOOSEBUMP ABOUT  

00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:45.891
THE PARK FOR THE SCHOOL.        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO HERE ARE GOOSEBUMP ABOUT  
LOCATIONS AS I SAID I THINK DO  

00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:49.294
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO HERE ARE GOOSEBUMP ABOUT  
LOCATIONS AS I SAID I THINK DO  
THERE YOU HAVE TO THE SCHOOL ON 

00:24:49.296 --> 00:24:52.598
LOCATIONS AS I SAID I THINK DO  
THERE YOU HAVE TO THE SCHOOL ON 
THE INTERSECTION AND GREENVIEW  

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.902
THERE YOU HAVE TO THE SCHOOL ON 
THE INTERSECTION AND GREENVIEW  
AND S7 WE HAVE BUMP OUTS ON ALL 

00:24:56.904 --> 00:24:57.769
THE INTERSECTION AND GREENVIEW  
AND S7 WE HAVE BUMP OUTS ON ALL 
FOUR QUADRANTS THEN THE TWO     

00:24:57.771 --> 00:25:01.406
AND S7 WE HAVE BUMP OUTS ON ALL

00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:06.078
SIDE INTERSECT LANDS WAY AND    
BRAESIDE PLACE ARE KEY          
INTERSECTIONS AND SO THEY WOULD 

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.914
BRAESIDE PLACE ARE KEY          
INTERSECTIONS AND SO THEY WOULD 
ONLY HAVE THE VOTES ON THE SIDE 

00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:16.521
INTERSECTIONS AND SO THEY WOULD 
ONLY HAVE THE VOTES ON THE SIDE 
STREET SIDE SO IN ONE OF THOSE  

00:25:16.523 --> 00:25:17.189
ONLY HAVE THE VOTES ON THE SIDE 
STREET SIDE SO IN ONE OF THOSE  
CROSS SECTIONS WHEN IT&amp;apos;S ON     

00:25:17.191 --> 00:25:20.125

CROSS SECTIONS WHEN IT&amp;apos;S ON     
THAT P INTERSECTION WITH JUST A

00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:23.061
THAT P INTERSECTION WITH JUST A 
SINGLE BUMP OUT THE SHARED      
SPACE WITH MOTORISTS WOULD LOOK 

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:27.332
SINGLE BUMP OUT THE SHARED      
SPACE WITH MOTORISTS WOULD LOOK 
LIKE THIS OBVIOUSLY BEHIND THAT 

00:25:27.334 --> 00:25:30.902
SPACE WITH MOTORISTS WOULD LOOK 
LIKE THIS OBVIOUSLY BEHIND THAT 
TREE FURTHER DOWN IN STATIONING 

00:25:30.904 --> 00:25:31.636
LIKE THIS OBVIOUSLY BEHIND THAT 
TREE FURTHER DOWN IN STATIONING 
FURTHER UP YOU&amp;apos;D HAVE PARKING   

00:25:31.638 --> 00:25:32.371
TREE FURTHER DOWN IN STATIONING 
FURTHER UP YOU&amp;apos;D HAVE PARKING   
SO YOU&amp;apos;D STILL HAVE THE PARKING 

00:25:32.373 --> 00:25:35.374
FURTHER UP YOU&amp;apos;D HAVE PARKING   
SO YOU&amp;apos;D STILL HAVE THE PARKING 
ON BOTH SIDES ONLY NOT WHEN     

00:25:35.376 --> 00:25:39.210
SO YOU&amp;apos;D STILL HAVE THE PARKING 
ON BOTH SIDES ONLY NOT WHEN     
IT&amp;apos;S AT THE INTERSECTION AND    

00:25:39.212 --> 00:25:39.944
ON BOTH SIDES ONLY NOT WHEN

INCIDENTALLY INTERSECTION BUMPS 
DO NOT TAKE AWAY ANY LEGAL

00:25:44.351 --> 00:25:47.452
DO NOT TAKE AWAY ANY LEGAL

BECAUSE YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT SUPPOSED TO  

00:25:47.454 --> 00:25:48.120

BECAUSE YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT SUPPOSED TO  
PARK NEAR INTERSECTIONS THE     

00:25:48.122 --> 00:25:50.889
BECAUSE YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT SUPPOSED TO  
PARK NEAR INTERSECTIONS THE     
LENGTH OF THE BUMBO ANYWAY THE  

00:25:50.891 --> 00:25:54.058
PARK NEAR INTERSECTIONS THE     
LENGTH OF THE BUMBO ANYWAY THE  
THE ONE BUMP OUT THAT MAY CAUSE

LENGTH OF THE BUMBO ANYWAY THE  
THE ONE BUMP OUT THAT MAY CAUSE 
THE ELIMINATION ON STREET       

00:25:54.729 --> 00:25:55.861
THE ONE BUMP OUT THAT MAY CAUSE 
THE ELIMINATION ON STREET       
PARKING IS ABOUT FOUR SPACES ON 

00:25:55.863 --> 00:26:01.399
THE ELIMINATION ON STREET       
PARKING IS ABOUT FOUR SPACES ON 
GREENVIEW OK BECAUSE CURRENTLY  

00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:02.233
PARKING IS ABOUT FOUR SPACES ON 
GREENVIEW OK BECAUSE CURRENTLY  
THERE IS LEGAL PARKING AT THAT  

00:26:02.235 --> 00:26:07.906
GREENVIEW OK BECAUSE CURRENTLY  
THERE IS LEGAL PARKING AT THAT  
LOCATION IF WE HAVE DESIGNATED  

00:26:07.908 --> 00:26:08.874
THERE IS LEGAL PARKING AT THAT  
LOCATION IF WE HAVE DESIGNATED  
BIKE LANE THAT SINGLE LOCATION  

00:26:08.876 --> 00:26:12.010
LOCATION IF WE HAVE DESIGNATED  
BIKE LANE THAT SINGLE LOCATION  
WOULD LOOK A BIT LIKE THIS.     

00:26:12.012 --> 00:26:12.944
BIKE LANE THAT SINGLE LOCATION  
WOULD LOOK A BIT LIKE THIS.     
WE WOULD HAVE THE PARKING TO    

00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:16.615
WOULD LOOK A BIT LIKE THIS.     
WE WOULD HAVE THE PARKING TO    
BIKE LANES IN TWO TEN DRIVES    

00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:17.482
WE WOULD HAVE THE PARKING TO    
BIKE LANES IN TWO TEN DRIVES    
AND OF COURSE LIKE I SAID       

00:26:17.484 --> 00:26:18.450
BIKE LANES IN TWO TEN DRIVES    
AND OF COURSE LIKE I SAID       
BEHIND THAT TREE CONTINUES TO   

00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:22.120
AND OF COURSE LIKE I SAID       
BEHIND THAT TREE CONTINUES TO   
BE PARK.                        

00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:26.524
BEHIND THAT TREE CONTINUES TO   
BE PARK.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE HAD A BUMPER BIKE LANE 

00:26:26.526 --> 00:26:27.559
BE PARK.                        
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE HAD A BUMPER BIKE LANE 
AS I SAID EARLIER PARKING WOULD 

00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:30.562
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE HAD A BUMPER BIKE LANE 
AS I SAID EARLIER PARKING WOULD 
BE ELIMINATED ON ONE SIDE       

00:26:30.564 --> 00:26:31.229
AS I SAID EARLIER PARKING WOULD 
BE ELIMINATED ON ONE SIDE       
ALREADY WE WOULD HAVE THE       

00:26:31.231 --> 00:26:34.566
BE ELIMINATED ON ONE SIDE       
ALREADY WE WOULD HAVE THE       
BUFFER BIKE LANE OF A TOTAL     

00:26:34.568 --> 00:26:35.433
ALREADY WE WOULD HAVE THE

OF EIGHT FEET TEN FOOT LANES    

00:26:35.435 --> 00:26:38.870
BUFFER BIKE LANE OF A TOTAL     
OF EIGHT FEET TEN FOOT LANES    
AND THEN BEHIND THAT TREE       

00:26:38.872 --> 00:26:42.140
OF EIGHT FEET TEN FOOT LANES    
AND THEN BEHIND THAT TREE       
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE PARKING.

AND THEN BEHIND THAT TREE       
WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE PARKING.          
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW IN THOSE SECTIONS        

00:27:03.329 --> 00:27:05.164

00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:06.031
MIDPOINT CROSSING WELL NOT      
NECESSARILY IN OUR CROSSING     
BECAUSE GREENVILLE IS NOT GOING 

00:27:06.033 --> 00:27:06.732

00:27:09.102 --> 00:27:09.735
GREENVIEW AND 7TH WHEN WE HAVE  
SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES THIS IS     
WHAT THE SHARED SPACES WOULD    

00:27:09.737 --> 00:27:10.469
SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES THIS IS     
WHAT THE SHARED SPACES WOULD    
LOOK LIKE IF WE KEEP THAT       

00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:11.136
WHAT THE SHARED SPACES WOULD    
LOOK LIKE IF WE KEEP THAT       
TWELVE AND A HALF FOOT LANES    

00:27:11.138 --> 00:27:12.004

THAT WOULD PROMOTE SLOWER       

00:27:12.606 --> 00:27:13.338
IT&amp;apos;S NOT AS NARROW AS TEN FOOT  
THAT WOULD PROMOTE SLOWER       
SPEEDS BUT IT IS QUITE MORE     

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:13.939
THAT WOULD PROMOTE SLOWER       
SPEEDS BUT IT IS QUITE MORE     
NARROW THAN WHAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY    

00:27:13.941 --> 00:27:14.606
SPEEDS BUT IT IS QUITE MORE     
NARROW THAN WHAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY    
BEING USED.                     

00:27:14.608 --> 00:27:15.807
NARROW THAN WHAT&amp;apos;S CURRENTLY    
BEING USED.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE HAD THE DESIGNATED     

00:27:15.809 --> 00:27:18.276
BEING USED.                     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE HAD THE DESIGNATED     
BIKE LANE WE COULD STILL GET    

00:27:18.278 --> 00:27:19.244
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF WE HAD THE DESIGNATED     
BIKE LANE WE COULD STILL GET    
THAT CROSS SECTION THROUGH THE  

00:27:19.246 --> 00:27:22.915
BIKE LANE WE COULD STILL GET    
THAT CROSS SECTION THROUGH THE  
TOOLBAR BUT WE HAVE TWO LANES   

00:27:22.917 --> 00:27:25.817
THAT CROSS SECTION THROUGH THE  
TOOLBAR BUT WE HAVE TWO LANES   
IN TWO DESIGNATED CYCLING AND   

00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:27.319
TOOLBAR BUT WE HAVE TWO LANES   
IN TWO DESIGNATED CYCLING AND   
THEN YOU HAVE PARKING BEYOND    

00:27:27.321 --> 00:27:31.990
IN TWO DESIGNATED CYCLING AND   
THEN YOU HAVE PARKING BEYOND    
THOSE TREES THE BUMPER BIKE     

00:27:31.992 --> 00:27:35.594
THEN YOU HAVE PARKING BEYOND    
THOSE TREES THE BUMPER BIKE     
LANE.                           

00:27:35.596 --> 00:27:36.662
THOSE TREES THE BUMPER BIKE     
LANE.                           
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO   

00:27:36.664 --> 00:27:39.598
LANE.                           
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO   
CARRY THE BUFFER THROUGH THE    

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.399
WE DON&amp;apos;T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO   
CARRY THE BUFFER THROUGH THE    
INTERSECTION WHERE THERE&amp;apos;S LOTS 

00:27:40.401 --> 00:27:44.135
CARRY THE BUFFER THROUGH THE    
INTERSECTION WHERE THERE&amp;apos;S LOTS 
OF BOTH SIDES BUT WE WOULD BE   

00:27:44.137 --> 00:27:44.803
INTERSECTION WHERE THERE&amp;apos;S LOTS 
OF BOTH SIDES BUT WE WOULD BE   
ABLE TO TRANSITION THE BUFFER   

00:27:44.805 --> 00:27:46.972
OF BOTH SIDES BUT WE WOULD BE   
ABLE TO TRANSITION THE BUFFER   
DOWN TO A DESIGNATED BIKE LANE  

00:27:46.974 --> 00:27:47.772
ABLE TO TRANSITION THE BUFFER   
DOWN TO A DESIGNATED BIKE LANE  
JUST THROUGH THAT INTERSECTION  

00:27:47.774 --> 00:27:54.113
DOWN TO A DESIGNATED BIKE LANE  
JUST THROUGH THAT INTERSECTION  
AND THIS IS HOW THAT WILL       

00:27:54.647 --> 00:28:01.519
BACKSPACE THIS THIS SAYS        
BUFFER.                         
BUT THIS SLIDE WOULD BE         

00:28:01.521 --> 00:28:06.258
BUFFER.                         
BUT THIS SLIDE WOULD BE         
SEPARATED SO IT WOULD LOOK THE  

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:06.591
BUT THIS SLIDE WOULD BE         
SEPARATED SO IT WOULD LOOK THE  
SAME.                           

00:28:06.593 --> 00:28:07.393
SEPARATED SO IT WOULD LOOK THE  
SAME.                           
WE&amp;apos;D HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT    

00:28:07.395 --> 00:28:10.195
SAME.                           
WE&amp;apos;D HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT    
BUFFER AND THE THE THE VERTICAL 

00:28:10.197 --> 00:28:12.430
WE&amp;apos;D HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT    
BUFFER AND THE THE THE VERTICAL 
FEATURES THROUGH THE            

00:28:12.432 --> 00:28:16.901
BUFFER AND THE THE THE VERTICAL 
FEATURES THROUGH THE            
INTERSECTION.                   

00:28:16.903 --> 00:28:17.969
FEATURES THROUGH THE            
INTERSECTION.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE PRESENTED THIS TO      

00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:18.303
INTERSECTION.                   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE PRESENTED THIS TO      
THEM.                           

00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:20.972
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WE PRESENTED THIS TO      
THEM.                           
THERE WAS A SURVEY ONLINE TWO   

00:28:20.974 --> 00:28:21.707
THEM.                           
THERE WAS A SURVEY ONLINE TWO   
WEEKS PRIOR TO THE MEETING AND  

00:28:21.709 --> 00:28:22.574
THERE WAS A SURVEY ONLINE TWO   
WEEKS PRIOR TO THE MEETING AND  
IT DIDN&amp;apos;T CLOSE UNTIL A WEEK    

00:28:22.576 --> 00:28:24.843
WEEKS PRIOR TO THE MEETING AND  
IT DIDN&amp;apos;T CLOSE UNTIL A WEEK    
AFTER.                          

00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:25.777
IT DIDN&amp;apos;T CLOSE UNTIL A WEEK    
AFTER.                          
SO IT CLOSED LAST NIGHT AT      

00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:26.478
AFTER.                          
SO IT CLOSED LAST NIGHT AT      
MIDNIGHT ACTUALLY I THINK WE    

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.379
SO IT CLOSED LAST NIGHT AT      
MIDNIGHT ACTUALLY I THINK WE    
DIDN&amp;apos;T GET CLOSE TILL THIS      

00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:29.081
MIDNIGHT ACTUALLY I THINK WE    
DIDN&amp;apos;T GET CLOSE TILL THIS      
MORNING BUT THERE WERE A BIT    

00:28:29.083 --> 00:28:32.951
DIDN&amp;apos;T GET CLOSE TILL THIS      
MORNING BUT THERE WERE A BIT    
MORE INFORMATION PROVIDED THAN  

00:28:32.953 --> 00:28:33.752
MORNING BUT THERE WERE A BIT    
MORE INFORMATION PROVIDED THAN  
WHAT WE LOOKED AT YESTERDAY.    

00:28:33.754 --> 00:28:36.555
MORE INFORMATION PROVIDED THAN  
WHAT WE LOOKED AT YESTERDAY.    
SO WE HAVE THE PROJECT WEBSITE  

00:28:36.557 --> 00:28:37.356
WHAT WE LOOKED AT YESTERDAY.    
SO WE HAVE THE PROJECT WEBSITE  
THAT TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT HOW  

00:28:37.358 --> 00:28:40.692
SO WE HAVE THE PROJECT WEBSITE  
THAT TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT HOW  
THIS PROJECT IS BEING FUNDED ON 

00:28:40.694 --> 00:28:43.862
THAT TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT HOW  
THIS PROJECT IS BEING FUNDED ON 
SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVE YOU     

00:28:43.864 --> 00:28:44.663
THIS PROJECT IS BEING FUNDED ON 
SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVE YOU     
KNOW, THE ACTIVE PRECIPITATION  

00:28:44.665 --> 00:28:47.499
SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVE YOU     
KNOW, THE ACTIVE PRECIPITATION  
FEATURES THAT WE&amp;apos;RE DISCUSSING  

00:28:47.501 --> 00:28:48.500
KNOW, THE ACTIVE PRECIPITATION  
FEATURES THAT WE&amp;apos;RE DISCUSSING  
HOW WE WANT TO USE THEIR

GET THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED WE 

00:28:59.546 --> 00:29:03.215
ON THE WEBSITE SOON AFTER WE    
GET THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED WE 
HAD THE VIRTUAL INFORMATION     

00:29:03.217 --> 00:29:03.816
GET THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED WE 
HAD THE VIRTUAL INFORMATION     
SESSION LAST WEEK IN WHICH      

00:29:03.818 --> 00:29:04.483
HAD THE VIRTUAL INFORMATION

PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS AND WE     
WERE ABLE TO ALSO INCLUDE THOSE 
QUESTIONS IN THE Q&amp;amp;A AND THEN   

00:29:11.091 --> 00:29:14.793
WERE ABLE TO ALSO INCLUDE THOSE 
QUESTIONS IN THE Q&amp;amp;A AND THEN   
HOW WILL THEIR FEEDBACK BE USED 

00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:15.127
QUESTIONS IN THE Q&amp;amp;A AND THEN   
HOW WILL THEIR FEEDBACK BE USED 
?                               

00:29:15.129 --> 00:29:16.161
HOW WILL THEIR FEEDBACK BE USED 
?                               
SO AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING,

?                               
SO AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING,  
ANY OF THESE BIKE NETWORKS      

00:29:21.035 --> 00:29:24.535
SO AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING,  
ANY OF THESE BIKE NETWORKS      
WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE           

00:29:24.537 --> 00:29:25.437
ANY OF THESE BIKE NETWORKS      
WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE           
GUIDELINES SET BY ALL AGES AND  

00:29:25.439 --> 00:29:29.540
WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE           
GUIDELINES SET BY ALL AGES AND  
ABILITIES NETWORK AND ALSO WHAT 

00:29:29.542 --> 00:29:30.175
GUIDELINES SET BY ALL AGES AND  
ABILITIES NETWORK AND ALSO WHAT 
THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN HAS

THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN HAS     
RECOMMENDED FOR THIS QUARTER.   

00:29:32.779 --> 00:29:36.848
THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN HAS     
RECOMMENDED FOR THIS QUARTER.   
BUT WE DID OFFER TO DO SAME AS  

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.351
RECOMMENDED FOR THIS QUARTER.   
BUT WE DID OFFER TO DO SAME AS  
DO WITH SOMETHING LIKE A

STANDARD YOU HAVE YOUR OWN      
SPACE.                          
YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT QUITE SEPARATED FROM 

00:29:45.192 --> 00:29:45.957
SPACE.                          
YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT QUITE SEPARATED FROM 
THE TRAVELING PUBLIC THEN YOU&amp;apos;D 

00:29:45.959 --> 00:29:48.760
YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT QUITE SEPARATED FROM 
THE TRAVELING PUBLIC THEN YOU&amp;apos;D 
HAVE THE OFFER WHERE YOU HAVE

00:29:49.629 --> 00:29:52.797
HAVE THE OFFER WHERE YOU HAVE   
THREE FEET OF SPACE AND THEN    
FINALLY YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE IT 

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:53.565
THREE FEET OF SPACE AND THEN    
FINALLY YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE IT 
WHERE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A 

00:29:53.567 --> 00:29:55.600
FINALLY YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE IT 
WHERE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A 
VERTICAL BARRIER BETWEEN YOU    

00:29:55.602 --> 00:29:59.937
WHERE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A 
VERTICAL BARRIER BETWEEN YOU    
AND SO THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT 

00:29:59.939 --> 00:30:03.875
VERTICAL BARRIER BETWEEN YOU    
AND SO THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT 
FROM THE SURVEY I ONLY JUST PUT 

00:30:03.877 --> 00:30:04.476
AND SO THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT 
FROM THE SURVEY I ONLY JUST PUT 
THIS IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS        

00:30:04.478 --> 00:30:07.311
FROM THE SURVEY I ONLY JUST PUT 
THIS IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS        
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S AN ALL AGE AND     

00:30:07.313 --> 00:30:08.180
THIS IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS        
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S AN ALL AGE AND     
ABILITIES I COULD JUST BRING    

00:30:08.182 --> 00:30:12.517
BECAUSE IT&amp;apos;S AN ALL AGE AND     
ABILITIES I COULD JUST BRING    
OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THAT   

00:30:12.519 --> 00:30:13.318
ABILITIES I COULD JUST BRING    
OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THAT   
INFORMATION ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC  

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:13.651
OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THAT   
INFORMATION ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC  
QUESTIONS.                      

00:30:13.653 --> 00:30:15.821
INFORMATION ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC  
QUESTIONS.                      
BUT I DID NOTICE THAT FORTY SIX 

00:30:15.823 --> 00:30:16.688
QUESTIONS.                      
BUT I DID NOTICE THAT FORTY SIX 
PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE 

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.025
BUT I DID NOTICE THAT FORTY SIX 
PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE 
GREATER THAN FIFTY AND I THINK  

00:30:20.027 --> 00:30:20.758
PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE 
GREATER THAN FIFTY AND I THINK  
THAT QUALIFIES AS A SENIOR AT   

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.594
GREATER THAN FIFTY AND I THINK  
THAT QUALIFIES AS A SENIOR AT   
LEAST THROUGH OUR GROUP.        

00:30:23.596 --> 00:30:24.529
THAT QUALIFIES AS A SENIOR AT   
LEAST THROUGH OUR GROUP.        
AND THEN ALTHOUGH IT WASN&amp;apos;T     

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:27.799
LEAST THROUGH OUR GROUP.        
AND THEN ALTHOUGH IT WASN&amp;apos;T     
REPORTED IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS    

00:30:27.801 --> 00:30:28.533
AND THEN ALTHOUGH IT WASN&amp;apos;T     
REPORTED IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS    
BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE HAD TO     

00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:30.602
REPORTED IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS    
BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE HAD TO     
RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS BUT  

00:30:30.604 --> 00:30:31.669
BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE HAD TO     
RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS BUT  
THE ONLY OF ONE HUNDRED AND     

00:30:31.671 --> 00:30:32.337
RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS BUT  
THE ONLY OF ONE HUNDRED AND     
FIFTY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED    

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:38.043
THE ONLY OF ONE HUNDRED AND     
FIFTY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED    
AND FORTY SIX TOTAL RESPONDENTS 

00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:38.709
FIFTY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED    
AND FORTY SIX TOTAL RESPONDENTS 
ANSWERED THE DEMOGRAPHIC        

00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:39.111
AND FORTY SIX TOTAL RESPONDENTS 
ANSWERED THE DEMOGRAPHIC        
QUESTION OF AGE.

ANSWERED THE DEMOGRAPHIC        
QUESTION OF AGE.                
BUT IN THE THE ORIGINAL SURVEY  

00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:45.650
QUESTION OF AGE.                
BUT IN THE THE ORIGINAL SURVEY  
I WAS ABLE TO GET THE           

00:30:45.652 --> 00:30:46.284
BUT IN THE THE ORIGINAL SURVEY  
I WAS ABLE TO GET THE           
INFORMATION THAT ABOUT FOUR     

00:30:46.286 --> 00:30:49.687
I WAS ABLE TO GET THE           
INFORMATION THAT ABOUT FOUR     
POINT SEVEN PERCENT SURVEY WERE

00:35:29.703 --> 00:35:32.470
THAT HAS THE ISLAND THAT WAS    
INSTALLED IN ANOTHER PROJECT    
AND BECAUSE OF ITS WIDTH AND    

00:35:32.472 --> 00:35:33.370
INSTALLED IN ANOTHER PROJECT    
AND BECAUSE OF ITS WIDTH AND    
ITS PERMANENT SEAT AT THE       

00:35:33.372 --> 00:35:36.841
AND BECAUSE OF ITS WIDTH AND    
ITS PERMANENT SEAT AT THE       
CENTER OF ANY KIND OF BIKE LANE 

00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:39.811
ITS PERMANENT SEAT AT THE       
CENTER OF ANY KIND OF BIKE LANE 
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT SHARED USE WOULD     

00:35:39.813 --> 00:35:40.478
CENTER OF ANY KIND OF BIKE LANE 
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT SHARED USE WOULD     
REQUIRE THE ELIMINATION         

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.948
THAT&amp;apos;S NOT SHARED USE WOULD     
REQUIRE THE ELIMINATION         
OF PARKING ON THAT FIRST BLOCK. 

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.918
REQUIRE THE ELIMINATION         
OF PARKING ON THAT FIRST BLOCK. 
FORTUNATELY THREE OF THE FOUR   

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.255
OF PARKING ON THAT FIRST BLOCK. 
FORTUNATELY THREE OF THE FOUR   
HOMEOWNERS THERE HAVE ACCESS TO 

00:35:51.257 --> 00:35:52.190
FORTUNATELY THREE OF THE FOUR   
HOMEOWNERS THERE HAVE ACCESS TO 
THEIR HOUSE THROUGH A SIDE      

00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:56.127
HOMEOWNERS THERE HAVE ACCESS TO 
THEIR HOUSE THROUGH A SIDE      
STREET AND THIS IS NOT MORE

THEIR HOUSE THROUGH A SIDE      
STREET AND THIS IS NOT MORE     
THAN ONE BLOCK OF ENTRY PARKING 

00:35:59.632 --> 00:36:00.931
STREET AND THIS IS NOT MORE     
THAN ONE BLOCK OF ENTRY PARKING 
SO WE WOULD NOT NEED TO GO TO   

00:36:00.933 --> 00:36:02.834
THAN ONE BLOCK OF ENTRY PARKING 
SO WE WOULD NOT NEED TO GO TO   
CITY COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL.      

00:36:02.836 --> 00:36:03.734
SO WE WOULD NOT NEED TO GO TO   
CITY COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL.      
THE LAST SCENARIO WOULD BE IF   

00:36:03.736 --> 00:36:07.104
CITY COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL.      
THE LAST SCENARIO WOULD BE IF   
WE PUT IN A BUFFER BIKE LANE OR 

00:36:07.106 --> 00:36:07.839
THE LAST SCENARIO WOULD BE IF   
WE PUT IN A BUFFER BIKE LANE OR 
A SEPARATE BIKE LANE WE WOULD   

00:36:07.841 --> 00:36:10.375
WE PUT IN A BUFFER BIKE LANE OR 
A SEPARATE BIKE LANE WE WOULD   
HAVE TO ELIMINATE STREET        

00:36:10.377 --> 00:36:11.542
A SEPARATE BIKE LANE WE WOULD   
HAVE TO ELIMINATE STREET        
PARKING ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD 

00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:15.113
HAVE TO ELIMINATE STREET        
PARKING ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE    

00:36:15.115 --> 00:36:15.513
PARKING ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE    
PROJECT.

FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE    
PROJECT.                        
SO WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED IS     

00:36:18.585 --> 00:36:19.383
PROJECT.

TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE      
TIME.                           

00:39:58.338 --> 00:40:01.005
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE      
TIME.                           
SO THOSE ANSWERS CHANGE AS THEY 

00:40:01.007 --> 00:40:01.272
TIME.                           
SO THOSE ANSWERS CHANGE AS THEY 
ARE.                            

00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:02.073
SO THOSE ANSWERS CHANGE AS THEY 
ARE.                            
IT WAS VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE     

00:40:02.075 --> 00:40:04.442
ARE.                            
IT WAS VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE     
THAT THEY NEVER CEASE OF BEING  

00:40:04.444 --> 00:40:05.310
IT WAS VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE     
THAT THEY NEVER CEASE OF BEING  
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ON TIME BUT 

00:40:05.312 --> 00:40:05.910
THAT THEY NEVER CEASE OF BEING  
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ON TIME BUT 
THEN WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO       

00:40:05.912 --> 00:40:08.580
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ON TIME BUT 
THEN WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO       
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME 

00:40:08.582 --> 00:40:09.314
THEN WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO       
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME 
YOU GET LESS NEIGHBORS.         

00:40:09.316 --> 00:40:12.584
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME 
YOU GET LESS NEIGHBORS.         
PEOPLE DO SEE CARS THERE.       

00:40:12.586 --> 00:40:15.519
YOU GET LESS NEIGHBORS.         
PEOPLE DO SEE CARS THERE.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH I MEAN YEAH IT IS A     

00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:16.320
PEOPLE DO SEE CARS THERE.       
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH I MEAN YEAH IT IS A     
VERY DENSE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH    

00:40:16.322 --> 00:40:19.890
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH I MEAN YEAH IT IS A     
VERY DENSE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH    
EVERY HOUSE HAS A DRIVEWAY SO I 

00:40:19.892 --> 00:40:20.625
VERY DENSE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH    
EVERY HOUSE HAS A DRIVEWAY SO I 
APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE     

00:40:20.627 --> 00:40:21.292
EVERY HOUSE HAS A DRIVEWAY SO I 
APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE     
PROPOSING IS A COMPROMISE.      

00:40:21.294 --> 00:40:23.361
APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU&amp;apos;RE     
PROPOSING IS A COMPROMISE.      
I JUST WONDERED THERE COULD BE  

00:40:23.363 --> 00:40:24.162
PROPOSING IS A COMPROMISE.      
I JUST WONDERED THERE COULD BE  
SOME MORE JUSTIFICATION FOR     

00:40:24.164 --> 00:40:26.864
I JUST WONDERED THERE COULD BE  
SOME MORE JUSTIFICATION FOR     
KEEPING PARKING AT BOTH SIDES   

00:40:26.866 --> 00:40:27.798
SOME MORE JUSTIFICATION FOR     
KEEPING PARKING AT BOTH SIDES   
BUT THERE IS STILL THE QUESTION 

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.532
KEEPING PARKING AT BOTH SIDES   
BUT THERE IS STILL THE QUESTION 
ABOUT HOW DO WITH VERTICAL      

00:40:28.534 --> 00:40:31.469
BUT THERE IS STILL THE QUESTION 
ABOUT HOW DO WITH VERTICAL      
ELEMENTS INTERACT WITH CARS     

00:40:31.471 --> 00:40:32.203
ABOUT HOW DO WITH VERTICAL      
ELEMENTS INTERACT WITH CARS     
PARKING GETTING IN AND OUT?     

00:40:32.205 --> 00:40:35.506
ELEMENTS INTERACT WITH CARS     
PARKING GETTING IN AND OUT?     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MAYBE RAYMOND COULD HELP   

00:40:35.508 --> 00:40:39.510
PARKING GETTING IN AND OUT?     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MAYBE RAYMOND COULD HELP   
ME WITH THIS ANSWER BECAUSE I   

00:40:39.512 --> 00:40:40.311
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I MAYBE RAYMOND COULD HELP   
ME WITH THIS ANSWER BECAUSE I   
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THE DISTANCE BETWEEN 

00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:42.847
ME WITH THIS ANSWER BECAUSE I   
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THE DISTANCE BETWEEN 
THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS.        

00:40:42.849 --> 00:40:43.848
DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THE DISTANCE BETWEEN 
THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS.        
I&amp;apos;VE SEEN THEM INSTALLED AROUND 

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:44.548
THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS.        
I&amp;apos;VE SEEN THEM INSTALLED AROUND 
THE CITY AND I KNOW THERE&amp;apos;S     

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:47.485
I&amp;apos;VE SEEN THEM INSTALLED AROUND 
THE CITY AND I KNOW THERE&amp;apos;S     
PARKING BEHIND THEM SO I KNOW   

00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:48.318
THE CITY AND I KNOW THERE&amp;apos;S     
PARKING BEHIND THEM SO I KNOW   
CARS CAN GET IN THERE AND       

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.455
PARKING BEHIND THEM SO I KNOW   
CARS CAN GET IN THERE AND       
PARALLEL PARK I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THE  

00:40:51.457 --> 00:40:55.025
CARS CAN GET IN THERE AND       
PARALLEL PARK I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THE  
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WELL AND   

00:40:55.027 --> 00:40:55.959
PARALLEL PARK I DON&amp;apos;T KNOW THE  
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WELL AND   
TO CLARIFY TO JANE AND BRAD MY  

00:40:55.961 --> 00:40:58.596
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WELL AND   
TO CLARIFY TO JANE AND BRAD MY  
UNDERSTANDING IS THE THE OPTION 

00:40:58.598 --> 00:41:02.867
TO CLARIFY TO JANE AND BRAD MY  
UNDERSTANDING IS THE THE OPTION 
THAT IS THE SEPARATED OR        

00:41:02.869 --> 00:41:03.601
UNDERSTANDING IS THE THE OPTION 
THAT IS THE SEPARATED OR        
PROTECTED BIKE LANE WHICH WOULD 

00:41:03.603 --> 00:41:06.004
THAT IS THE SEPARATED OR        
PROTECTED BIKE LANE WHICH WOULD 
INCLUDE THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS 

00:41:06.006 --> 00:41:06.938
PROTECTED BIKE LANE WHICH WOULD 
INCLUDE THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS 
THERE WOULD NOT BE ON STREET    

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.474
INCLUDE THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS 
THERE WOULD NOT BE ON STREET    
PARKING ON THOSE SIDES THAT     

00:41:10.476 --> 00:41:11.209
THERE WOULD NOT BE ON STREET    
PARKING ON THOSE SIDES THAT     
HAVE THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS.   

00:41:11.211 --> 00:41:11.542
PARKING ON THOSE SIDES THAT     
HAVE THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       

00:41:11.544 --> 00:41:14.678
HAVE THOSE VERTICAL ELEMENTS.   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       
SO IT IT YEAH.                  

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.679
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.                       
SO IT IT YEAH.                  
SO THERE WOULD BE SPACES FOR    

00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:16.380
SO IT IT YEAH.                  
SO THERE WOULD BE SPACES FOR    
THE DRIVEWAYS BETWEEN THOSE     

00:41:16.382 --> 00:41:18.282
SO THERE WOULD BE SPACES FOR    
THE DRIVEWAYS BETWEEN THOSE     
DELINEATE AREAS.                

00:41:18.284 --> 00:41:19.216
THE DRIVEWAYS BETWEEN THOSE     
DELINEATE AREAS.                
THERE WOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES    

00:41:19.218 --> 00:41:19.884
DELINEATE AREAS.                
THERE WOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES    
AND IF THERE WERE ON STREET     

00:41:19.886 --> 00:41:22.419
THERE WOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES    
AND IF THERE WERE ON STREET     
PARKING WE COULD SPACE THE      

00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:23.253
AND IF THERE WERE ON STREET     
PARKING WE COULD SPACE THE      
DELINEATOR IN SUCH A WAY THAT   

00:41:23.255 --> 00:41:24.055
PARKING WE COULD SPACE THE      
DELINEATOR IN SUCH A WAY THAT   
VEHICLES COULD PULL IN AND PULL 

00:41:24.057 --> 00:41:26.257
DELINEATOR IN SUCH A WAY THAT   
VEHICLES COULD PULL IN AND PULL 
OUT.                            

00:41:26.259 --> 00:41:27.191
VEHICLES COULD PULL IN AND PULL 
OUT.                            
BY AND LARGE THE THAT&amp;apos;S WHY     

00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:30.061
OUT.                            
BY AND LARGE THE THAT&amp;apos;S WHY     
PARKING WOULD HAVE TO BE        

00:41:30.063 --> 00:41:30.994
BY AND LARGE THE THAT&amp;apos;S WHY     
PARKING WOULD HAVE TO BE        
REMOVED AND THAT WAS AN OPTION  

00:41:30.996 --> 00:41:31.528
PARKING WOULD HAVE TO BE        
REMOVED AND THAT WAS AN OPTION  
FOR THOSE VERTICAL              

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.131
REMOVED AND THAT WAS AN OPTION  
FOR THOSE VERTICAL              
DENOMINATOR&amp;apos;S.                  

00:41:34.133 --> 00:41:35.299
FOR THOSE VERTICAL              
DENOMINATOR&amp;apos;S.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I&amp;apos;M GOING TO JUST SHARE   

00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:38.736
DENOMINATOR&amp;apos;S.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I&amp;apos;M GOING TO JUST SHARE   
MY SCREEN AGAIN AND GO BACK TO  

00:41:38.738 --> 00:41:39.270
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO I&amp;apos;M GOING TO JUST SHARE   
MY SCREEN AGAIN AND GO BACK TO  
THAT ONE SLIDE.                 

00:41:39.272 --> 00:41:40.872
MY SCREEN AGAIN AND GO BACK TO  
THAT ONE SLIDE.                 
I THINK THAT WAS MISLEADING     

00:41:40.874 --> 00:41:47.645
THAT ONE SLIDE.                 
I THINK THAT WAS MISLEADING     
AFTER WHAT RAYMOND JUST SAID    

00:41:47.979 --> 00:41:57.789
HOOPSTER STEPPED                

00:42:13.906 --> 00:42:21.813
                 THOUGH IN THIS 
EXAMPLE, RAYMOND, YOU&amp;apos;RE SAYING 
THAT IT WOULD ONLY BE THAT      

00:42:21.815 --> 00:42:22.613
EXAMPLE, RAYMOND, YOU&amp;apos;RE SAYING 
THAT IT WOULD ONLY BE THAT      
VERTICAL ELEMENT WOULD ONLY BE  

00:42:22.615 --> 00:42:26.117
THAT IT WOULD ONLY BE THAT      
VERTICAL ELEMENT WOULD ONLY BE  
INSTALLED IN THE BUFFORD AREA   

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:30.654
VERTICAL ELEMENT WOULD ONLY BE  
INSTALLED IN THE BUFFORD AREA   
AND LET&amp;apos;S SAY THE THE LEFT SIDE 

00:42:30.656 --> 00:42:33.690
INSTALLED IN THE BUFFORD AREA   
AND LET&amp;apos;S SAY THE THE LEFT SIDE 
OF THE SCREEN AND THEN ON THE   

00:42:33.692 --> 00:42:34.358
AND LET&amp;apos;S SAY THE THE LEFT SIDE 
OF THE SCREEN AND THEN ON THE   
RIGHT WHERE THERE ARE STILL     

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.025
OF THE SCREEN AND THEN ON THE   
RIGHT WHERE THERE ARE STILL     
GOING TO BE PARKING, WE         

00:42:35.027 --> 00:42:37.428
RIGHT WHERE THERE ARE STILL     
GOING TO BE PARKING, WE         
WOULDN&amp;apos;T BE ABLE TO PUT THAT    

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.296
GOING TO BE PARKING, WE         
WOULDN&amp;apos;T BE ABLE TO PUT THAT    
VERTICAL ELEMENT WELL, WE COULD 

00:42:38.298 --> 00:42:41.432
WOULDN&amp;apos;T BE ABLE TO PUT THAT    
VERTICAL ELEMENT WELL, WE COULD 
PUT SOME PERIODICALLY BUT       

00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:42.366
VERTICAL ELEMENT WELL, WE COULD 
PUT SOME PERIODICALLY BUT       
THEY&amp;apos;D HAVE TO BE SPACED VERY   

00:42:42.368 --> 00:42:43.100
PUT SOME PERIODICALLY BUT       
THEY&amp;apos;D HAVE TO BE SPACED VERY   
FAR APART TO BE ALLOW VEHICLES  

00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:48.572
THEY&amp;apos;D HAVE TO BE SPACED VERY   
FAR APART TO BE ALLOW VEHICLES  
TO PULL IN AND PULL OUT THIS AS 

00:42:48.574 --> 00:42:49.173
FAR APART TO BE ALLOW VEHICLES  
TO PULL IN AND PULL OUT THIS AS 
YOU ALL KNOW, WE&amp;apos;VE             

00:42:49.175 --> 00:42:51.776
TO PULL IN AND PULL OUT THIS AS 
YOU ALL KNOW, WE&amp;apos;VE             
EXPERIMENTED WITH FLOATING      

00:42:51.778 --> 00:42:52.543
YOU ALL KNOW, WE&amp;apos;VE             
EXPERIMENTED WITH FLOATING      
PARKING LANE ON DIVISION WHICH  

00:42:52.545 --> 00:42:53.411
EXPERIMENTED WITH FLOATING      
PARKING LANE ON DIVISION WHICH  
WAS MEANT TO KIND OF ELIMINATE  

00:42:53.413 --> 00:42:56.080
PARKING LANE ON DIVISION WHICH  
WAS MEANT TO KIND OF ELIMINATE  
THIS KIND OF SITUATION BUT IT   

00:42:56.082 --> 00:42:56.714
WAS MEANT TO KIND OF ELIMINATE  
THIS KIND OF SITUATION BUT IT   
DIDN&amp;apos;T WORK OUT PARTICULARLY    

00:42:56.716 --> 00:42:57.048
THIS KIND OF SITUATION BUT IT   
DIDN&amp;apos;T WORK OUT PARTICULARLY    
WELL.                           

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.084
DIDN&amp;apos;T WORK OUT PARTICULARLY    
WELL.                           
SO I UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE      

00:43:00.086 --> 00:43:03.253
WELL.                           
SO I UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE      
INTRODUCING THIS CONCEPT BUT    

00:43:03.255 --> 00:43:03.588
SO I UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE      
INTRODUCING THIS CONCEPT BUT    
YEAH.                           

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.925
INTRODUCING THIS CONCEPT BUT    
YEAH.                           
SO THAT DELINEATOR TO THE RIGHT 

00:43:07.927 --> 00:43:08.425
YEAH.                           
SO THAT DELINEATOR TO THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE ROAD.               

00:43:08.427 --> 00:43:09.359
SO THAT DELINEATOR TO THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE ROAD.               
YEAH, RIGHT THERE WE&amp;apos;RE JANE&amp;apos;S  

00:43:09.361 --> 00:43:11.162
SIDE OF THE ROAD.               
YEAH, RIGHT THERE WE&amp;apos;RE JANE&amp;apos;S  
CURSOR IS WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE 

00:43:11.164 --> 00:43:15.699
YEAH, RIGHT THERE WE&amp;apos;RE JANE&amp;apos;S  
CURSOR IS WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE 
TO BE MUCH LESS DENSE ON THE    

00:43:15.701 --> 00:43:16.167
CURSOR IS WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE 
TO BE MUCH LESS DENSE ON THE    
OPPOSITE SIDE.                  

00:43:16.169 --> 00:43:17.434
TO BE MUCH LESS DENSE ON THE    
OPPOSITE SIDE.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT 

00:43:17.436 --> 00:43:19.069
OPPOSITE SIDE.                  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT 
CLEAR BECAUSE I WASN&amp;apos;T AWARE    

00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:26.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK, I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT 
CLEAR BECAUSE I WASN&amp;apos;T AWARE    
THAT ANY OTHER FEEDBACK.        

00:43:26.612 --> 00:43:29.547
CLEAR BECAUSE I WASN&amp;apos;T AWARE    
THAT ANY OTHER FEEDBACK.        
JULIE YEAH.

JULIE YEAH.                     
SO I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS  

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:34.285
JULIE YEAH.                     
SO I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS  
A ONE WAS ARE THE RESIDENTS     

00:43:34.287 --> 00:43:37.722
SO I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS  
A ONE WAS ARE THE RESIDENTS     
CONCERNED ABOUT SPEEDS ON THOSE 

00:43:37.724 --> 00:43:38.589
A ONE WAS ARE THE RESIDENTS     
CONCERNED ABOUT SPEEDS ON THOSE 
STREETS AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT    

00:43:38.591 --> 00:43:41.658
CONCERNED ABOUT SPEEDS ON THOSE 
STREETS AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT    
THE SPEEDS ARE?                 

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.463
STREETS AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT    
THE SPEEDS ARE?                 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, WE HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, WE HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY    
KEY OR SPEED.                   
WE DO HAVE PEOPLE REQUESTING A  

00:43:52.738 --> 00:43:53.805
KEY OR SPEED.                   
WE DO HAVE PEOPLE REQUESTING A  
SPEED LIMIT TO BE LOWERED AT    

00:43:53.807 --> 00:43:57.207
WE DO HAVE PEOPLE REQUESTING A  
SPEED LIMIT TO BE LOWERED AT    
THIS POINT IS AN ENFORCEMENT    

00:43:57.209 --> 00:43:57.475
SPEED LIMIT TO BE LOWERED AT    
THIS POINT IS AN ENFORCEMENT    
ISSUE.                          

00:43:57.477 --> 00:44:00.845

IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I      
THINK WE CONTEMPLATED EARLIER   

01:01:20.185 --> 01:01:20.717
IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I      
THINK WE CONTEMPLATED EARLIER   
IN THE DESIGN.                  

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:23.787
THINK WE CONTEMPLATED EARLIER   
IN THE DESIGN.                  
IT&amp;apos;S JUST WHEN YOU GET TO CYO   

01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:24.887
IN THE DESIGN.                  
IT&amp;apos;S JUST WHEN YOU GET TO CYO   
TO THEN TRANSITION ALL THE WAY  

01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:28.324
IT&amp;apos;S JUST WHEN YOU GET TO CYO   
TO THEN TRANSITION ALL THE WAY  
ACROSS ESPECIALLY AT SECTION    

01:01:28.326 --> 01:01:29.092
TO THEN TRANSITION ALL THE WAY  
ACROSS ESPECIALLY AT SECTION    
SEVEN TO SO WIDE BECAUSE YOU    

01:01:29.094 --> 01:01:30.226
ACROSS ESPECIALLY AT SECTION    
SEVEN TO SO WIDE BECAUSE YOU    
HAVE THE MEAT IN IT WOULD BE A  

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:33.229
SEVEN TO SO WIDE BECAUSE YOU    
HAVE THE MEAT IN IT WOULD BE A  
VERY, VERY BAD TRANSITION.      

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:33.696
HAVE THE MEAT IN IT WOULD BE A  
VERY, VERY BAD TRANSITION.      
ALL RIGHT.                      

01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:39.603
VERY, VERY BAD TRANSITION.      
ALL RIGHT.                      

01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:48.444

WHERE THERE&amp;apos;S SOME SOME PARKING 
IS REMOVED BUT NOT ALL THE

THEIR BIKE ROUTES WERE          
ADMITTEDLY FALLING SHORT AND I  
THINK MANY YOU&amp;apos;RE AWARE THAT

ADMITTEDLY FALLING SHORT AND I  
THINK MANY YOU&amp;apos;RE AWARE THAT    
THE PLAN CALLS FOR FIVE MILES   

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:34.309
THINK MANY YOU&amp;apos;RE AWARE THAT    
THE PLAN CALLS FOR FIVE MILES   
PLUS OF PROTECTED BIKE LANES    

01:09:34.311 --> 01:09:34.710
THE PLAN CALLS FOR FIVE MILES

EVERY YEAR.                     
THIS WOULD IMPLEMENT UPWARDS    
OF TWENTY THREE MILES BUT THE   

01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:39.248
THIS WOULD IMPLEMENT UPWARDS    
OF TWENTY THREE MILES BUT THE   
TARGET IS SIXTY FIVE.           

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:41.350
OF TWENTY THREE MILES BUT THE   
TARGET IS SIXTY FIVE.           
SO IT IS FALLING SHORT          

01:09:41.352 --> 01:09:41.750
TARGET IS SIXTY FIVE.           
SO IT IS FALLING SHORT          
ADMITTEDLY.                     

01:09:41.752 --> 01:09:44.820
SO IT IS FALLING SHORT          
ADMITTEDLY.                     
BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE FOUR       

01:09:44.822 --> 01:09:45.488
ADMITTEDLY.

INTERSECTIONS WE WOULD ADDRESS  

01:09:45.490 --> 01:09:46.222
BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE FOUR       
INTERSECTIONS WE WOULD ADDRESS  
SIXTY SIX INTERSECTIONS WHERE   

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:49.358
INTERSECTIONS WE WOULD ADDRESS  
SIXTY SIX INTERSECTIONS WHERE   
THE PLAN HAS A TARGET           

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:49.691
SIXTY SIX INTERSECTIONS WHERE   
THE PLAN HAS A TARGET           
OF TWENTY.

THE PLAN HAS A TARGET           
OF TWENTY.                      
SO THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT THERE NOW      

01:09:53.097 --> 01:09:53.796
OF TWENTY.                      
SO THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT THERE NOW      
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT

SO THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT THERE NOW      
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT           
OF STICKER SHOCK AT THE BOTTOM  

01:09:56.034 --> 01:09:57.032
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT           
OF STICKER SHOCK AT THE BOTTOM  
YOU CAN SEE THAT ROUGHLY FORTY  

01:09:57.034 --> 01:10:00.269
OF STICKER SHOCK AT THE BOTTOM  
YOU CAN SEE THAT ROUGHLY FORTY  
THREE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS  

01:10:00.271 --> 01:10:01.036
YOU CAN SEE THAT ROUGHLY FORTY  
THREE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS  
NOT PROGRAMS IN ANY BUDGET YET  

01:10:01.038 --> 01:10:04.273
THREE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS  
NOT PROGRAMS IN ANY BUDGET YET  
SO THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF WORK TO TO  

01:10:04.275 --> 01:10:05.040
NOT PROGRAMS IN ANY BUDGET YET  
SO THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF WORK TO TO  
DO IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW   

01:10:05.042 --> 01:10:07.309
SO THERE&amp;apos;S A LOT OF WORK TO TO  
DO IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW   
WE WOULD PAY FOR THAT.          

01:10:07.311 --> 01:10:08.210
DO IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW   
WE WOULD PAY FOR THAT.          
BUT AS I MENTIONED WE DID       

01:10:08.212 --> 01:10:08.878
WE WOULD PAY FOR THAT.          
BUT AS I MENTIONED WE DID       
CEMENT THE SAFE STREETS FOR

THAT LAST MONTH SO THAT COULD   
GET US PART OF THE WAY IF NOT A 

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.152
THAT LAST MONTH SO THAT COULD   
GET US PART OF THE WAY IF NOT A 
GOOD GOOD PART OF THE WAY THERE 

01:10:16.154 --> 01:10:18.754
GET US PART OF THE WAY IF NOT A 
GOOD GOOD PART OF THE WAY THERE 
IF WE GET THAT FEDERAL FUNDING  

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:22.624
GOOD GOOD PART OF THE WAY THERE 
IF WE GET THAT FEDERAL FUNDING  
THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES       

01:10:22.626 --> 01:10:23.393
IF WE GET THAT FEDERAL FUNDING  
THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES       
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AND KIND    

01:10:23.395 --> 01:10:24.060
THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES       
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AND KIND    
OF CONTEMPLATE SOME OF THE      

01:10:24.062 --> 01:10:26.628
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AND KIND    
OF CONTEMPLATE SOME OF THE      
CONCEPTS THAT MIGHT BE HERE AND 

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:27.396
OF CONTEMPLATE SOME OF THE      
CONCEPTS THAT MIGHT BE HERE AND 
NOW THIS IS JUST A PRELIMINARY  

01:10:27.398 --> 01:10:27.730
CONCEPTS THAT MIGHT BE HERE AND 
NOW THIS IS JUST A PRELIMINARY  
SCAN.                           

01:10:27.732 --> 01:10:30.700
NOW THIS IS JUST A PRELIMINARY  
SCAN.                           
SO WHEN YOU SEE THESE DRAWINGS

SCAN.                           
SO WHEN YOU SEE THESE DRAWINGS  
I THINK THIS IS THE STARTING    

01:10:31.803 --> 01:10:34.470
SO WHEN YOU SEE THESE DRAWINGS  
I THINK THIS IS THE STARTING    
POINT FOR THE DISCUSSION.       

01:10:34.472 --> 01:10:35.471
I THINK THIS IS THE STARTING    
POINT FOR THE DISCUSSION.       
DON&amp;apos;T TAKE THIS AS GOSPEL.      

01:10:35.473 --> 01:10:35.804
POINT FOR THE DISCUSSION.       
DON&amp;apos;T TAKE THIS AS GOSPEL.      
RIGHT.

RIGHT.                          
SO THE IDEA IS THE CONSULTANT   

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:38.974
RIGHT.                          
SO THE IDEA IS THE CONSULTANT   
HELPED US IDENTIFY WHAT ARE     

01:10:38.976 --> 01:10:39.709
SO THE IDEA IS THE CONSULTANT   
HELPED US IDENTIFY WHAT ARE     
SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN

OTHER ELEMENTS AS WELL FOR      
MILLER THE IDEA WOULD BE TO     
LOOK SOME OF THOSE EXISTING     

01:11:12.777 --> 01:11:13.476
MILLER THE IDEA WOULD BE TO     
LOOK SOME OF THOSE EXISTING     
CROSSWALKS AND HOW CAN WE MAKE  

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:16.178
LOOK SOME OF THOSE EXISTING     
CROSSWALKS AND HOW CAN WE MAKE  
UPGRADES WHERE WE JUST HAVE     

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:16.579
CROSSWALKS AND HOW CAN WE MAKE  
UPGRADES WHERE WE JUST HAVE     
STATIC SIGNAGE?                 

01:11:16.581 --> 01:11:17.813
UPGRADES WHERE WE JUST HAVE     
STATIC SIGNAGE?                 
MAYBE WE CAN UPGRADE THOSE TWO  

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.449
STATIC SIGNAGE?                 
MAYBE WE CAN UPGRADE THOSE TWO  
RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING      

01:11:20.451 --> 01:11:20.717
MAYBE WE CAN UPGRADE THOSE TWO

RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING      
BEACONS.                        
WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT BETTER BIKE 

01:11:23.655 --> 01:11:28.424
BEACONS.                        
WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT BETTER BIKE 
FACILITIES, BIKE LANES WITH     

01:11:28.426 --> 01:11:29.091
WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT BETTER BIKE 
FACILITIES, BIKE LANES WITH     
GREEN PAVEMENT MARKING MAKE     

01:11:29.093 --> 01:11:31.527

THAT GO INTO THE CONSIDERATION. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WON&amp;apos;T GO THROUGH ALL       
OF THESE AND A LOT OF DETAIL.   

01:16:20.818 --> 01:16:21.817
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I WON&amp;apos;T GO THROUGH ALL       
OF THESE AND A LOT OF DETAIL.   
I THINK A LOT OF THESE CONCEPTS 

01:16:21.819 --> 01:16:23.886
OF THESE AND A LOT OF DETAIL.   
I THINK A LOT OF THESE CONCEPTS 
WILL BE FAMILIAR TO MANY OF YOU 

01:16:23.888 --> 01:16:24.620
I THINK A LOT OF THESE CONCEPTS 
WILL BE FAMILIAR TO MANY OF YOU 
BECAUSE THEY&amp;apos;RE VERY SIMILAR TO 

01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:25.488
WILL BE FAMILIAR TO MANY OF YOU 
BECAUSE THEY&amp;apos;RE VERY SIMILAR TO 
WHAT WE USE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:27.523
BECAUSE THEY&amp;apos;RE VERY SIMILAR TO 
WHAT WE USE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 
TRAFFIC COMING PROGRAM BUT      

01:16:27.525 --> 01:16:28.324
WHAT WE USE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 
TRAFFIC COMING PROGRAM BUT      
THEY&amp;apos;RE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT TO    

01:16:28.326 --> 01:16:31.526
TRAFFIC COMING PROGRAM BUT      
THEY&amp;apos;RE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT TO    
ACCOMMODATE BIGGER STREETS,     

01:16:31.528 --> 01:16:31.927
THEY&amp;apos;RE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT TO    
ACCOMMODATE BIGGER STREETS,     
MAJOR STREETS.

ACCOMMODATE BIGGER STREETS,     
MAJOR STREETS.                  
SO CHICANES THE IDEA IS THAT    

01:16:33.063 --> 01:16:36.265
MAJOR STREETS.                  
SO CHICANES THE IDEA IS THAT    
THINGS THAT YOU KIND OF DRIVE   

01:16:36.267 --> 01:16:36.932
SO CHICANES THE IDEA IS THAT    
THINGS THAT YOU KIND OF DRIVE   
AROUND KIND OF BREAKS A         

01:16:36.934 --> 01:16:39.368

LITTLE BUCKET OF MONEY AND THIS 

01:28:35.285 --> 01:28:36.218
TRANSPORTATION IS ITS OWN       
LITTLE BUCKET OF MONEY AND THIS 
WOULD MEAN THAT IT&amp;apos;S IN EVERY

LITTLE BUCKET OF MONEY AND THIS 
WOULD MEAN THAT IT&amp;apos;S IN EVERY

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:43.892
WOULD MEAN THAT IT&amp;apos;S IN EVERY   
ROAD PROJECT THAT WE DO         
POTENTIALLY SO THESE ARE MY     

01:28:43.894 --> 01:28:44.358
ROAD PROJECT THAT WE DO         
POTENTIALLY SO THESE ARE MY     
SWIRLY IDEAS.                   

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.193
POTENTIALLY SO THESE ARE MY     
SWIRLY IDEAS.

JOB FRAMING IT AND I&amp;apos;LL JUST    
GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT    

01:29:14.525 --> 01:29:15.523
JOB FRAMING IT AND I&amp;apos;LL JUST    
GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT    
FOR EXAMPLE TO IT SO A LOT      

01:29:15.525 --> 01:29:16.191
GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT    
FOR EXAMPLE TO IT SO A LOT      
OF OUR EXISTING BIKE NETWORK    

01:29:16.193 --> 01:29:16.992
FOR EXAMPLE TO IT SO A LOT      
OF OUR EXISTING BIKE NETWORK    
ARE JUST A SINGLE STRIPE ON THE 

01:29:16.994 --> 01:29:17.793
OF OUR EXISTING BIKE NETWORK    
ARE JUST A SINGLE STRIPE ON THE 
ROAD AND FOR PLOWING AND        

01:29:17.795 --> 01:29:18.660
ARE JUST A SINGLE STRIPE ON THE 
ROAD AND FOR PLOWING AND        
SWEEPING WHAT PUBLIC WORKS DOES 

01:29:18.662 --> 01:29:19.327
ROAD AND FOR PLOWING AND        
SWEEPING WHAT PUBLIC WORKS DOES 
IS THEY JUST TAKEAR             

01:29:19.329 --> 01:29:20.061
SWEEPING WHAT PUBLIC WORKS DOES 
IS THEY JUST TAKEAR             
EQUIPMENT AND RUN FROM CURB TO  

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:20.729
IS THEY JUST TAKEAR             
EQUIPMENT AND RUN FROM CURB TO  
CURB SO THEY ARE SWEEPING AND   

01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:22.330
EQUIPMENT AND RUN FROM CURB TO  
CURB SO THEY ARE SWEEPING AND   
PLOWING THE BIKE LANE AS THEY   

01:29:22.332 --> 01:29:25.566
CURB SO THEY ARE SWEEPING AND   
PLOWING THE BIKE LANE AS THEY   
SWEEP AND PLOW THE ROAD AND SO  

01:29:25.568 --> 01:29:25.967
PLOWING THE BIKE LANE AS THEY   
SWEEP AND PLOW THE ROAD AND SO  
THAT&amp;apos;S WORKED.                  

01:29:25.969 --> 01:29:30.438
SWEEP AND PLOW THE ROAD AND SO  
THAT&amp;apos;S WORKED.                  
YOU KNOW, AND WE WON&amp;apos;T GO DOWN  

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.106
THAT&amp;apos;S WORKED.                  
YOU KNOW, AND WE WON&amp;apos;T GO DOWN  
A RABBIT HOLE ABOUT WHETHER     

01:29:31.108 --> 01:29:34.109
YOU KNOW, AND WE WON&amp;apos;T GO DOWN  
A RABBIT HOLE ABOUT WHETHER     
THAT HAS BEEN DONE WELL OR EVEN 

01:29:34.111 --> 01:29:34.776
A RABBIT HOLE ABOUT WHETHER     
THAT HAS BEEN DONE WELL OR EVEN 
IF THOSE FACILITIES ARE         

01:29:34.778 --> 01:29:35.243
THAT HAS BEEN DONE WELL OR EVEN 
IF THOSE FACILITIES ARE         
ADEQUATE OR NOT.                

01:29:35.245 --> 01:29:38.179
IF THOSE FACILITIES ARE         
ADEQUATE OR NOT.                
BUT THAT WAS OUR PRACTICE.      

01:29:38.181 --> 01:29:41.483
ADEQUATE OR NOT.                
BUT THAT WAS OUR PRACTICE.      
BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE THE        

01:29:41.485 --> 01:29:42.283
BUT THAT WAS OUR PRACTICE.      
BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE THE        
TRANSPORTATION PLAN WHICH CALLS 

01:29:42.285 --> 01:29:43.117
BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE THE        
TRANSPORTATION PLAN WHICH CALLS 
FOR AN ALL AGES AND ABILITIES   

01:29:43.119 --> 01:29:46.088
TRANSPORTATION PLAN WHICH CALLS

FOR AN ALL AGES AND ABILITIES   
NETWORK WHICH LARGELY LEANS     
TOWARDS PROTECTED BIKE LANES    

01:29:49.793 --> 01:29:52.460

TOWARDS PROTECTED BIKE LANES    
WITH VERTICAL SEPARATION FROM   

01:29:52.462 --> 01:29:56.931
TOWARDS PROTECTED BIKE LANES    
WITH VERTICAL SEPARATION FROM   
MOVING VEHICLES WE HAVE THE     

01:29:56.933 --> 01:29:57.698
WITH VERTICAL SEPARATION FROM   
MOVING VEHICLES WE HAVE THE     
FACILITIES DOWNTOWN THAT DAY IS 

01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:01.169
MOVING VEHICLES WE HAVE THE     
FACILITIES DOWNTOWN THAT DAY IS 
PUT IN THE CYCLE TRACKS THE TWO 

01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:01.837
FACILITIES DOWNTOWN THAT DAY IS 
PUT IN THE CYCLE TRACKS THE TWO 
CYCLE TRACKS ON DIVISION        

01:30:01.839 --> 01:30:05.239
PUT IN THE CYCLE TRACKS THE TWO

WILLIAM FIRST AND THEN THERE&amp;apos;S  
ONE GOING IN AS WE SPEAK ON     

01:30:06.076 --> 01:30:08.342
WILLIAM FIRST AND THEN THERE&amp;apos;S  
ONE GOING IN AS WE SPEAK ON     
MILLER CATHERINE, THE REASON    

01:30:08.344 --> 01:30:11.479
ONE GOING IN AS WE SPEAK ON     
MILLER CATHERINE, THE REASON    
WHY THOSE WORK OR EXISTING      

01:30:11.481 --> 01:30:12.480
MILLER CATHERINE, THE REASON    
WHY THOSE WORK OR EXISTING      
MAINTENANCE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE 

01:30:12.482 --> 01:30:13.347
WHY THOSE WORK OR EXISTING      
MAINTENANCE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
THE WIDTH OF A ROADWAY, A LANE  

01:30:13.349 --> 01:30:16.317
MAINTENANCE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
THE WIDTH OF A ROADWAY, A LANE  
OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO 

01:30:16.319 --> 01:30:19.921
THE WIDTH OF A ROADWAY, A LANE  
OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO 
FIVE FOOT BIKE SIDE BY SIDE AND 

01:30:19.923 --> 01:30:20.756
OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO 
FIVE FOOT BIKE SIDE BY SIDE AND 
THEN THE CURVE AND SO THEY CAN  

01:30:20.758 --> 01:30:21.823
FIVE FOOT BIKE SIDE BY SIDE AND 
THEN THE CURVE AND SO THEY CAN  
RUN A FULL SIZED PLOW OR A FULL 

01:30:21.825 --> 01:30:24.058
THEN THE CURVE AND SO THEY CAN  
RUN A FULL SIZED PLOW OR A FULL 
SIZED SWEEPER DOWN THOSE.       

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:24.926
RUN A FULL SIZED PLOW OR A FULL 
SIZED SWEEPER DOWN THOSE.       
BUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE CAN&amp;apos;T 

01:30:24.928 --> 01:30:27.763
SIZED SWEEPER DOWN THOSE.       
BUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE CAN&amp;apos;T 
PUT IN CYCLE TRACKS EVERYWHERE  

01:30:27.765 --> 01:30:28.863
BUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE CAN&amp;apos;T 
PUT IN CYCLE TRACKS EVERYWHERE  
IN PART JUST BECAUSE OF CERTAIN 

01:30:28.865 --> 01:30:31.833
PUT IN CYCLE TRACKS EVERYWHERE  
IN PART JUST BECAUSE OF CERTAIN 
CONSTRAINT ROADWAY              

01:30:31.835 --> 01:30:32.633
IN PART JUST BECAUSE OF CERTAIN 
CONSTRAINT ROADWAY

THAN PERHAPS A PROTECTED SINGLE 
LANE BIKE LANE WITH VERTICAL    

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:43.378
THAN PERHAPS A PROTECTED SINGLE

SEPARATION THAT WOULD MEAN WE   

01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.379
LANE BIKE LANE WITH VERTICAL    
SEPARATION THAT WOULD MEAN WE   
WOULD HAVE A FIVE FOOT ISH BIKE 

01:30:44.381 --> 01:30:48.449
SEPARATION THAT WOULD MEAN WE   
WOULD HAVE A FIVE FOOT ISH BIKE 
LANE WITH THE BUFFER PROTECTED  

01:30:48.451 --> 01:30:48.717
WOULD HAVE A FIVE FOOT ISH BIKE

THAT&amp;apos;S A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT   
THAT DOES THAT.                 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I KIND     

01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:22.783
THAT DOES THAT.                 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I KIND     
OF FEEL THEIR PAIN A LITTLE

WORKS, I THINK THERE&amp;apos;S SEVERAL  
CHALLENGES.                     
THE FIRST IS THERE IS AN ORDER  

01:34:59.368 --> 01:35:02.003
CHALLENGES.                     
THE FIRST IS THERE IS AN ORDER

01:35:02.005 --> 01:35:05.840
THE FIRST IS THERE IS AN ORDER  
OF MAGNITUDE COST DIFFERENTIAL  
BETWEEN A GASOLINE POWERED      

01:35:05.842 --> 01:35:10.144

MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE COULD    
GET A SORT OF LIKE A BOBCAT     

01:35:13.816 --> 01:35:18.285
MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE COULD    
GET A SORT OF LIKE A BOBCAT     
STYLE MACHINE THAT COULD WORK   

01:35:18.287 --> 01:35:19.287
GET A SORT OF LIKE A BOBCAT     
STYLE MACHINE THAT COULD WORK   
IN A BIKE LANE FOR LESS THAN    

01:35:19.289 --> 01:35:21.089
STYLE MACHINE THAT COULD WORK   
IN A BIKE LANE FOR LESS THAN    
ONE THOUSAND.                   

01:35:21.091 --> 01:35:22.056
IN A BIKE LANE FOR LESS THAN    
ONE THOUSAND.                   
BUT THE ELECTRIC VERSION IS     

01:35:22.058 --> 01:35:22.724
ONE THOUSAND.                   
BUT THE ELECTRIC VERSION IS     
LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY      

01:35:22.726 --> 01:35:24.993
BUT THE ELECTRIC VERSION IS     
LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY      
THOUSAND SOMEWHERE THEREABOUTS  

01:35:24.995 --> 01:35:25.192
LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY      
THOUSAND SOMEWHERE THEREABOUTS  
.                               

01:35:25.194 --> 01:35:28.797
THOUSAND SOMEWHERE THEREABOUTS  
.                               
THE OTHER THING IS THE SUPPLY   

01:35:28.799 --> 01:35:29.397
.                               
THE OTHER THING IS THE SUPPLY   
ISSUE IS REAL.                  

01:35:29.399 --> 01:35:30.431
THE OTHER THING IS THE SUPPLY
